        "text": "The former “Heavenly King’s Wife,” Gaile Lok (乐基儿), has reemerged in the public eye, looking radiant and confident despite a slight gain in weight after her second divorce. The custody of her child went to her ex-husband, but Lok hasn’t let this phase her, showing no signs of a post-divorce slump on social media, where she freely enjoys life in sheer dresses.\n\nGaile Lok’s carefree spirit remains unchanged, having been untroubled by love in her marriage to Leon Lai (黎明) or her subsequent marriage to a businessman. Now, she expresses no urgency to dive back into dating, focusing on dignity post-divorce and dedicating more time to her child.\n\nLabeled the “bad girl,” if not for Leon Lai, Gaile Lok would have been just another model. Her rise to the “Heavenly King’s Wife” came after starring in a music video for Lai and stepping into the spotlight following his breakup with Shu Qi (舒淇). This title gained popularity around 2006 when Lai and Lok were spotted dating in Tokyo, marking a departure from Lai’s previously reserved public persona.\n\nGaile Lok’s marriage to Lai and her vibrant life as a “Heavenly King’s Wife” contrasted sharply with the quiet love stories of other celebrities like Lynn Hung (熊黛林) with Aaron Kwok (郭富城). Lok’s rebellious streak and high-profile lifestyle often sparked rumors, but Lai’s unconditional support for her, even in the face of scandal, underscored their bond.\n\nHowever, their contrasting personalities led to their divorce in 2012, after which Lok quickly moved on, sparking new romances. Her relaxed attitude post-divorce from Lai and her marriage to businessman Ian Chu (朱智豪) in 2017 showed her resilience and independence, despite facing financial controversies and gossip.\n\nFollowing her second divorce in 2023, Lok has maintained her composure, choosing to focus on her child rather than rushing into another relationship. Her journey from celebrity spouse to a single mother and entrepreneur highlights her strength and refusal to conform to societal expectations, making her a distinctive figure in the entertainment world.\n\nNow, as Gaile Lok embarks on a new chapter, she proves that life after love can be just as fulfilling, marking a return to the fashion scene and reaffirming her independence. Whether as a star wife or a businesswoman’s spouse, Lok has consistently shown that her identity is defined by her choices, not her partners, making her a unique and spirited presence in the entertainment industry."
