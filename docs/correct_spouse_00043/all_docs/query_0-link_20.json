        "text": "The rumors of divorce between 45-year-old Leon Lai (黎明) and his 32-year-old wife Gaile Lok (樂基兒) have been spreading like a wild fire. Gaile was rumored to have fallen for another man. Photos emerged in which Gaile was seen riding on her new boyfriend’s motorcycle. Sprawled on a bed, Gaile’s photo even revealed her underwear briefs, indicating the intimacy she had with the mysterious man and finally show evidence of the end of the marriage with Leon.\n\nSince Gaile reportedly had a miscarriage earlier this year, her divorce rumors with Leon have been nonstop. Possessing a great figure and a pretty face, Gaile also possessed a wild streak and easy flirtatious attitude with men. Earlier, Gaile was once again linked to former boyfriend, Ray Ng (吳承浚). Although Gaile admitted to investing money in opening a Mexican restaurant with Ray, she drew the line at romantic speculations\n\nThe identity of Gaile’s new boyfriend from New Zealand, Cuz, finally emerged with the publication of a scandalous photo of Gaile in her underwear. Gaile reportedly left her husband behind one month ago while vacationing in Bali with her new love. Cuz even uploaded a few photos on Instagram, in which Gaile laid on a bed with her underwear peeking out from her dress. The photo caption said that she was his “homie.”\n\nHowever, Cuz’s Instagram account is now closed and the pictures have been removed.\n\nIt was reported that Gaile and Leon have already filed for divorce. Leon felt deeply hurt and hid from everyone in his hometown, Beijing. He is too embarrassed and hurt to give a statement about the divorce. It was also reported Leon had tried very hard to save the marriage with multi-million dollar gifts, but the four-year marriage is now over.\n\nWhile Gaile insisted on the divorce, she did not wish to embarrass Leon any further. In an agreement with Leon, Gaile reportedly agreed not to unilaterally comment on the status of her marriage publicly\n\nRe: Leon Lai divorce Gaile Lok\n\nIt was reported earlier this month that 45-year-old “Heavenly King” Leon Lai (黎明) and his 32-year-old wife of four years, Gaile Lok(樂基兒), are going through a divorce. Both parties neither denied nor confirmed the rumor, but recent evidence suggests that the rumor may be true.\n\nAfter getting married in Las Vegas in 2008, Leon’s workload increased. Tabloids suggested that it is their lack of time together which has caused the couple to grow farther apart throughout the years. Earlier this year, Leon and Gaile spent a few weeks in San Francisco, hoping for a chance to salvage their dying marriage. Leon also gifted Gaile with three houses in San Francisco, costing over $110 million HKD. However, the couple still decided to file for divorce.\n\nAn American friend of Gaile said, “They are basically from two different worlds. Their lifestyle is completely different! Leon is materialistic and enjoys the luxuries of life. After all, he did buy his own yacht and personal jet. He likes to eat at high-class restaurants, while Gaile likes to live a simpler life. Even if she had to eat McDonald’s her entire life, she would be fine with it. Gaile tried to convince Leon to change, but he wouldn’t, so that’s why they have separated.”\n\nGaile’s Divorce Assets\n\nAccording to the divorce law of the United States, assets acquired before marriage are considered to be individual. As a result, assets in their divorce will not be divided equally. It was also alleged that Gaile was not interested in having Leon to provide for her every month. The price in Gaile’s “divorce agreement” is set firm, which is $50 million HKD in cash and three houses. Currently, Gaile owns six houses that cost over $200 million HKD.\n\nIn the Midst of a Divorce? Leon Lai Gave Gaile Lok Over $100 Million of Gifts | JayneStars.com"
