        "text": "from jaynestars.com:\n\nSelena Lee Joins Charmaine Sheh in “News Anchorwoman”​\n\nCharmaine Sheh (佘詩曼) is confirmed to star in TVB’s News Anchorwoman < NEWS新聞女王>. Rounding out the powerful cast will be Kenneth Ma (馬國明) and Shaun Tam (譚俊彥). Selena Lee (李施嬅), Samantha Ko (高海寧), and Regina Ho (何依婷) will portray anchorwomen fighting for the primetime spot.\n\nProduced by Chung Cheng (鍾澍佳), filming will start in March, lasting about half a year. Dramas revolving around the news network are often seen in South Korea and the United States, but this is the first time TVB is embracing the genre. No stone is left unturned in regards to the script and costume design. TVB will also hire a movie crew to help with art direction and lighting. As it is a collaboration with China, the filming method will follow their standards.\n\nShaun will portray Charmaine’s love interest, while Kenneth plays Charmaine’s news partner in the primetime slot. Kenneth’s character is witty and very adept at building his network connections, so he often competes with Charmaine. As filming for the drama will not start until March, he is currently planning and doing a lot of research for his own wedding with Roxanne Tong (湯洛雯). The couple is happy that a lot of wedding sponsors have approached them.\n\nSamantha will play an intelligent and cheerful morning news anchor. As Kenneth’s protégé, she is trained by him to become Charmaine’s replacement. As her character does not have any financial backing from her family, she can only rely on herself to get what she wants. “Every industry will have interpersonal conflicts. The drama will show the good and malicious side of humans, so it’ll be fun!”\n\nSelena plays Kenneth’s ex-girlfriend, who has an honest personality with a tough exterior. Although she is passionate about work and has strong moral principles, things change as events unfold. Experiencing a health scare with a severely weakened immune system, Selena had stopped work completely last year. “It was really scary and I was very anxious. Now, I will try my best to schedule work accordingly and relax. Knowing that Chung Cheng is the producer makes me relieved, as we won’t have overnight filming and we’ll have enough time to rest. Even now, I am still monitoring my health.” Selena looks forward to working with the producer for the first time. “\n\nAnother reason why Selena agreed to the role was the chance to work with Charmaine again. They had worked together in When Easterly Showers Fall on the Sunny West <東山飄雨西關晴>, Can’t Buy My Love <公主嫁到>, and Beyond the Realm of Conscience <宮心計>. Currently on vacation with her husband Anson Cha, Selena is still reading through the script to prepare for her new role.\n\nfrom jaynestars.com:\n\nRosita Kwok’s Thanks Andrew Lam for His Mentorship​\n\nGet On a Flat <下流上車族> was TVB’s sleeper hit of 2022, winning multiple drama and acting accolades such as Yahoo Asia Multiverse Buzz Awards and TVB Anniversary Awards. Rosita Kwok (郭柏妍) was one of the biggest breakout stars last year, which she thanks veteran artiste Andrew Lam (林敏聪) for his mentorship on set in helping her acting improvement.\n\nWhen Rosita won TVB Most Improved Actress, Andrew was one of the happiest people that night. Portraying father and daughter in Get On a Flat, they were praised for their realistic interactions as a family. Initially on set, Andrew found Rosita as dry as a “piece of chicken” and “she couldn’t cry.” However, the actor found Rosita to be a quick learner. “After I gave her some tips, she improved a lot. There was a scene where I went over to her new home to visit, and all three takes were useable! She’s now ready for any drama set.”\n\nAlthough Andrew had injured his leg and did not want to go to the TVB Anniversary Awards, he attended with a cane. Andrew replied that he had especially come to support Rosita, otherwise he would not have attended the ceremony.\n\nPossessing a bubbly excitement and vitality, Rosita has a very likable personality and has formed close friendships with the cast and crew of Get on a Flat. She is grateful for producer Kwan Man Sum (關文深) in casting her, and the support and encouragement she received from Andrew, whose acting made Rosita realize “the need to continue learning.” She added, “Elena Kong (江美儀) has always treated me as a daughter on and off cameras, so I am very thankful for her advice.”\n\nCurrently filming police drama Death Reminder <奪命提示>, Rosita will be working with former costar and rumored boyfriend Karl Ting (丁子朗) again. With lots of action scenes and a romantic storyline with Karl, Rosita hopes to show a new side of herself onscreen as her new year is off to a fast start.\n\nfrom jaynestars.com:\n\nCecca Xu Walking Away from Miss Hong Kong 2022 Runner Up Title?​\n\nAfter winning Miss Hong Kong 2022 runner-up, Cecca Xu (許子萱) has rarely attend TVB promotional events. The reason is being reported that Cecca is unable to stand the pressure of being in the entertainment industry and is in negotiation with TVB to break her contract.\n\nOnce considered a hot favorite to win the pageantry, Cecca was accused of making a sour expression when she accepted her runner-up award. Although Cecca insisted that she was happy with the result, she stopped appearing in public events since November and did not appear in the Lunar New Year Gala.\n\nAs Cecca had difficult time since the pageantry, the beauty queen had been taking frequent trips to destress and asked TVB to terminate her contract. In response, TVB allegedly approved her absence as long as Cecca fulfills her runner-up duties and pass off her crown in this year’s pageantry. According to insiders, TVB did not want to find a substitute for the coronation event as it may hurt the pageantry’s image.\n\nCecca allegedly already made up her mind to cut off ties with the pageantry and is looking forward to regaining her freedom. A rumor is circulating that Cecca is heading to Mainland for a project and TVB is compelled to respect Cecca’s decision. As a result, Cecca and TVB agreed that Cecca is only required to attend lucrative events otherwise, she is not required to show up.\n\nCecca and Netizens Had a Heated Exchange\n\nMany netizens have noticed Cecca’s absence and left messages on her social media page, “Why are you missing from TVB events when all the other three Miss Hong 2022 winners are there? Are you taking a long vacation?”\n\nSome netizens criticized Cecca for her poor work ethics and chided her inability to fulfill her Miss Hong Kong runner-up duties, “Poor character! TVB was right to not crown you as the champion.”\n\nCecca did not stay silent and gave a sharp response, “Anti-fans are not welcome here. If you don’t like it, you can leave.”\n\nUnfortunately, Cecca’s response only fueled netizens’ energy and they responded, “Hahaha, did I hit the target? You failed your obligations. Such poor character!”\n\nThe media tried to contact Cecca and TVB for a response but neither responded to the request.\n\nfrom jaynestars.com:\n\nHow Shiga Lin Keeps Her Romance With Carlos Chan Fresh​\n\nDespite being busy preparing for her wedding in April, Shiga Lin (連詩雅) released her new song “He is Not You”<他不是你>. Asked about her perspective on relationships, Shiga believes it is critical to show gratitude and never take a significant other for granted.\n\n“It doesn’t matter how long you’ve been together. Don’t forget to be grateful for everything he’s done for you. Don’t take things for granted…. You have to try to give romantic surprises to the other person. You don’t have to do it all the time or go all out, but it’s a way to keep things fresh,” Shiga advised.\n\nFriends are excited for Shiga and Carlos Chan’s (陳家樂) next milestone in life. At an earlier event, Alice Chan (陳煒) seemed especially protective towards Shiga and wrapped her arms around Shiga’s waist when they were taking photos, which prompted pregnant speculations that she quickly denied.\n\nAlice joked, “It’ll be easy for her to get pregnant. The feng shui master said to expedite things, she should not call her cats and dogs as her children. She needs to give them a name and leave some quota for herself!”\n\nShiga shared that the feng shui master had reminded her that the kitchen is very important for the female owner of the house as it will affect their financial luck, so the kitchen must have a rice container. “A lot of times I don’t wash my dishes right away and leave it until a few days later, so I will pay more attention to this in the future.”\n\nAsked if she sought advice on how to conceive, Shiga said she did not ask the feng shui master. Instead, she asked him when she can hold a concert and he said that there is a chance she will venture outside Hong Kong in 2023. When asked if she prefers to get married first or hold a concert, she replied that she wants to hold a concert first and have Carlos can be her guest performer.\n\nfrom jaynestars.com:\n\nKate Tsui Spotted on London Subway​\n\nKate Tsui (徐子珊), 43, officially announced her departure from the entertainment industry in 2019, ending a 15-year career to pursue a PhD degree in Psychology in Europe. Just as fans wondered about the actress’ recent whereabouts, Kate was sighted in London.\n\nAfter winning Miss Hong Kong 2004, Kate quickly became one of TVB’s hotly promoted fadans. In 2015, she enrolled in a professional design and gemology course, creating her own brand of jewelry. She later completed a Master’s of Psychology degree from the University of Hong Kong while working. She graduated in 2019 and announced her plans to leave the entertainment industry..\n\nSelling her home in Residence Bel-Air for $17.6 million Hong Kong dollars, Kate seemed resolute in leaving Hong Kong for good. However Kate’s plans were delayed when the pandemic hit.\n\nShe has since turned her Facebook and Instagram accounts to private status, and has not updated her Weibo since June 2019. The last time she was seen in public was a rare public appearance at a charity fundraising gala in Malaysia last April. Wearing a strapless black dress, Kate still has the fit physique and charisma of a celebrity.\n\nRecently, a netizen excitedly shared that they bumped into Kate on the London subway, “I was on the subway and suddenly found myself staring at Kate Tsui when I looked up! We held eye contact for a few seconds. She was very tall and beautiful; my heart was beating like crazy the entire time!” Kate was with a friend at the time, and she was dressed casually but this did not hide her fit physique.\n\nKate’s fans continue to miss her dearly, and diligently leave comments every year wishing her a happy birthday. Quoting the ending song of her drama Highs and Lows <雷霆掃毒>, fans wistfully asking her, “Have you been happy these past thousand days? Have you been busy every day?”\n\nfrom jaynestars.com:\n\nKaty Kung and Boyfriend Open Bakery Together​\n\nActress Katy Kung (龔嘉欣) has remained single these years while watching good friends Grace Chan (陳凱琳) and Zoie Tam (譚凱琪) surpass her in marriage and parenthood milestones. Revitalized by a new romance, the Treasures of Destiny <新四十二章> actress recently hinted at finally leaving singlehood behind!\n\nCan’t Wait to Answer Maternal Longings\n\nWhile she remains tight-lipped about her new boyfriend’s identity, likely to protect the budding romance, the 33-year-old went as far as saying that she hopes to have a baby in the year of the rabbit, which naturally evoked much speculation from the public!\n\nWorking on her career for the past fourteen years, Katy’s acting abilities have been acknowledged in productions such as Death By Zero <殺手> and Brutally Young 2.0 <十八年後的終極告白2.0>. Despite gaining greater recognition in the current fadan drought at TVB, Katy missed an opportunity to earn a TV Queen nomination for her meaty role in Treasures of Destiny last year, when the drama was switched out at the last minute.\n\nThings might be looking better in the romance department for the actress, as recent Chinese New Year gathering video shared by good friend Grace Chan saw Katy standing close to an unidentified man in a red shirt. The two did not shy away from posing together in the reunion photo taken at the same meetup. All smiles, Katy held on to Grace’s newborn while her companion stood closely behind, flashing a huge grin with a victory sign.\n\nHelped Finance Boyfriend’s New Patisserie Outlet\n\nWith netizens hot on his heels, the man’s identity was quickly nailed down as Japanese patisserie chef Tetsuya Matsuoka (松岡哲也), a former model-turned-chef who grew up in Nagasaki, with prior modelling experience in Tokyo. Tetsuya eventually stayed on in Hong Kong after a modelling gig in 2013, when he got to know fellow Japanese who were keen to start a cake business locally by coincidence. Doing well, his cake business now has a presence of two branches in Causeway Bay and Tsim Tsha Tsui, with a collaboration with departmental chain store Sogo.\n\nAccording to insider sources, Katy had not only forked out money for a new bakery outlet with Tetsuya, but would also head down to the shop personally to help with desserts-making! The sweet girlfriend would also brew nutritious soups for Tetsuya, who spends up to 12 to 15 hours daily in the kitchen as patisserie chef. Grace was said to have introduced the two, while it is rumored that the tall and suave Tetsuya has previously dated actress Angel Chiang (蔣家旻) before Katy.\n\nfrom jaynestars.com:\n\nJacqueline Wong is Making a Comeback on Valentine’s Day​\n\nHong Kong actress Jacqueline Wong (黃心穎) has largely disappeared from the entertainment industry following her cheating scandal with Andy Hui (許志安). After a long break that includes ending her contract with TVB, the actress makes a surprise announcement that she is releasing a new song “Crown Me” and shares a 20-second trailer.\n\nWith her damaged image, Jacqueline’s announcement on her social media caught netizens by surprise. The music video trailer shows that Jacqueline has opted for a sexy image as she dances in a slip dress behind the backdrop of an auction house. The short trailer ends with a snapshot of the music label’s name, Sumthing – a play on words on Jacqueline’s Chinese name and suggests that Jacqueline may have created her own music label.\n\nAs many netizens wait to see Jacqueline’s comeback, netizens have discovered that Jacqueline has deleted most of her old photos on her Instagram page. Leaving just 10 photos on her page, many netizens believe that Jacqueline is signaling that she wants a fresh start with her comeback.\n\nJacqueline’s upcoming comeback follows Andy Hui’s return to the entertainment industry. Although Andy Hui’s image also took a nosedive after the scandal, the singer signed with Universal Studio last year to resume his singing career.\n\nfrom jaynestars.com:\n\nTony Leung is Grateful to Have Carina Lau As His Manager​\n\nHong Kong crime thriller When the Wind Blows <風再起時> was first announced in 2017 and it made many fans excited to see Tony Leung (梁朝偉) and Aaron Kwok (郭富城) appearing on the silver screen together. While the film was ultimately delayed several times, Tony was not bothered and depends on his wife Carina Lau (劉嘉玲) as his manager.\n\nAlthough Tony merges his personal life and professional life by working closely with Carina, Tony believes there are benefits to this arrangement, “She knows exactly what I like. Communication is easier.”\n\nTony shares that the two have a tacit understanding when they are choosing a script, “Sometimes when she receives the script, she will email it to me. If I like it, I will film it. If I don’t like it, I will drop it. I only either like or dislike the script. Since there is rarely any middle ground, we rarely argue.”\n\nTony on Finding the Right Script\n\nAs an established actor, Tony is often on the hunt for well-written script and admits having to turn down many scripts in recent years, “Sometimes I can’t read the script after a few pages or sometimes I don’t like the story at all. I always think filming is due to fate and I don’t know when I will come across something I really like. However, lately, I have accepted more movies because there are things I want to try.”\n\nWith a relaxed mindset, Tony shares that it was fate that brought him to the cast of When the Wind Blows. Tong explains, “When deciding whether to accept the project, I often talk to the director first. If I feel good about it, I would want to give it a try. I need to be able to trust the director. “\n\nTony continues, “This time, I read the script first and then told director Yung Tsz Kwong (翁子光) that I wanted to his work. I then watched his work, Port of Call <踏血尋梅> I thought it was quite interesting and that his story about a police officer in the 60’s would also be very unique.”\n\nIn When the Wind Blows, it follows the power struggles between two police officers played by Aaron and Tony. The characters are based on real life people and inspired a film. However, Tony shares that he deliberately charted his own interpretation of the character and did not deliberately compare to any previous works.\n\nConnecting with the Character\n\nTony reveals that he enjoys revisiting a different time period and finds a connection through his character, “My character does not have big ambition. He likes to play the piano and shoots guns. He loves a woman but never expresses it. These moods are similar to mine so it was hard not to get invested in the role.”\n\nTony also likes how the film shows a glimpse of Hong Kong’s past and provides a journey to revisit time, I think this film has such intentions. It writes about the experiences of people in this era. Through some special edit, it comes together like pieces of a dream. The director has his own unique style. The characters are neither black or white. Everyone is just trying to survive in this era.”\n\nfrom jaynestars.com:\n\nKelly Cheung Shares How She Pursued Her Boyfriend​\n\nProduced by Virginia Lok (樂易玲) in collaboration with Shaw Brothers, variety show A Foreign Lover (搵鬼做情人) will cover multicultural relationships.

In theaters for four weeks, the film grossed over $100 million Hong Kong dollars and broke records as the highest grossing local film in Hong Kong box office history.\n\nThe stellar results show the local audience’s eagerness for high quality Hong Kong productions, despite recent years of stagnant growth. Director and screenwriter Jack Ng (吳煒倫), who was also behind 2021’s biopic Anita which was based on the life of Anita Mui (梅艷芳), said, “My biggest wish is for there to be another Hong Kong film soon that will break the record we set. Records are not meant to be kept, but rather to be broken. This proves that audiences can regain their faith and belief in the Hong Kong film industry. I hope that more people will go support and watch Hong Kong films in theaters.”\n\nAs the leading actor for A Guilty Conscience, Dayo shared his sentiments, “A Guilty Conscience has become the box office leading film of all time in Hong Kong history. How did that happen? I never thought this could happen in my entire life. I’ve imagined someone handing me a bag full of cash randomly on the streets, or giving me a brand new car, or even the deed to a property. However, I never imagined that I would be given the opportunity to star in a film that would make history and set records. It will take me some time to fully understand how I’m feeling. It feels like I grew wings.”\n\nStill digesting on why viewers love A Guilty Conscience, Dayo said, “Why is the film so well-received? I read an online comment which shocked me. This person said he had never watched a Hong Kong film before seeing A Guilty Conscience. We were able to attract him to go see the film. It’s difficult to attract viewers like that. I hope we will be able to attract more people to give Hong Kong films a chance. I’m very grateful to the audience.”\n\nOther casts members of the record-breaking film also expressed their gratitude for viewers’ support, including Tse KwanHo (謝君豪), Louise Wong (王丹妮), Fish Liew (廖子妤), and Renci Yeung (楊偲泳).\n\nfrom jaynestars.com:\n\nMat Yeung Promises to Take Care of Lisa Chong​\n\nSticking together through life’s ups and downs, actor Mat Yeung (楊明) and long-time girlfriend Lisa Chong (莊鍶敏) were said to have delayed their marriage plans when Lisa’s father Ch’ng Chong Poh (莊寶) was hospitalized this year.\n\nMaking known her father’s peaceful passing on Instagram in a recent post, Lisa expressed her gratitude to the team of doctors and staff who cared for her dad in his final days and announced that the funeral proceedings will take place on March 9.

The trailer looks exhilarating and rivals effects from local action movies!\n\nNatalie, who often stars in soft-spoken and demure roles, will portray a feisty officer and have a romantic storyline with Kenneth. On the other hand, Kenneth, who has always starred in morally righteous roles, will portray a complex character with an abundance of action scenes. Although this will be their fifth time collaborating, the distinct change in their roles will bring new surprises to their onscreen chemistry.\n\nCiting the biggest difficulty being his action scenes, Kenneth exclaimed, “The action scenes are quite intense, with each punch hitting the flesh. It’s real fighting. It’s safe to say that the audience has not seen me in this kind of role before. These past few years, I’ve primarily starred in professional roles such as doctors and police officers. I hope that my character in Invisible Clan will bring a sense of freshness.”\n\nJoel, who stars as the captain of the police tactical unit, will share a romantic storyline with Tiffany Lau (劉穎鏇). Due to his action-heavy scenes, Joel spent half a year undergoing special physical training for the role. Although he has always been fit, Joel gained increased muscle mass and a bulkier frame. Joel shared, “I had to gain weight, so I trained to increase my muscles. In addition to a larger frame, my neck has also bulked up. Although having to wear heavy uniform in the summer is quite challenging, most importantly, the effects come out great and believable.”"
