        "text": "Gaile Lai (simplified Chinese: 乐基儿; traditional Chinese: 樂基兒; pinyin: Lè Jīér; Cantonese Yale: Lok6 Gei1 Yan4), born Lai Ga Yi (simplified Chinese: 黎嘉仪; traditional Chinese: 黎嘉儀; pinyin: Lí Jiāyí; Cantonese Yale: Lai4 Ga1 Yi4) on 22 August 1980, better known as Gaile Lok, is a Hong Kong actress and model. She was born in Macau to a Chinese father and a Vietnamese mother. Gaile studied in the United States.\n\nBackground\n\nGaile Lok is of Chinese-Vietnamese descent as her mother is Kinh Vietnamese. She was born in Macau but grew up in USA. She made her film debut starring in the 2000 romantic film, I Do, and subsequently appeared in another film entitled My Sweetie in 2004. When she made her debut, some Hong Kong entertainment information magazines had compared her likeness to that of Shu Qi, a Taiwanese actress.\n\nPersonal life\n\nAs of 2006, Gaile was dating Leon Lai, a Hong Kong actor and singer. With this relationship, she became a target of paparazzi and the media. In 2006, a magazine published an article and intimate photographs of her with Leon Lai at the latter's residence, prompting the Hong Kong Actors Guild to protest \"irresponsibility\" on the part of the magazine.\n\nIn 2009, Lok and Lai were secretly married in Las Vegas at the Wynn Hotel, with his manager and assistant acting as witnesses.\n\nOn 3 October 2012 the couple announced the end of their four-year marriage. Their joint statement stated that there were \"different philosophies in life\" which caused the divorce. Leon Lai's manager stated that there was not a third party that lead the couple to divorce.\n\nLok married businessman Ian Chu in 2017. Their son, Hunter, was born on 29 April 2019."
