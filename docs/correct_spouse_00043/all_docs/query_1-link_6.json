        "text": "Leon Lai\n\nIn order to bring in new excitements for his music, he invited a famous music producer Jonathan Lee from Taiwan in 2005 to produce his new mandarin album \"A Story\". He returned to the Hong Kong Coliseum on in April 2007 to perform in his one-night-only \"Leon 4 in Love Concert\" where he performed not only his own hits but also hits of the other three heavenly kings namely Aaron, Andy and Jacky. He performed a total of 18 songs.\n\nIn the period before he participated in the New Talent Singing Awards, he enrolled in the ATV actor training class, however he did not complete the training with no apparent reason. Then, he applied for admission to the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts but his application was rejected.\n\nAfter the New Talent Singing Awards, he had some opportunities to star in a few TV series. On one occasion, he went for filming of a romantic series in Taiwan. There was a stark contrast in height between him and the popular lead actress who is only 1.60 cm in height. The actress then demanded that he squatted while filming so as to make up for the height differences. He had to act through all the scenes with the actress while squatting but he had to endure it, as he was not popular at the time. However not long afterwards his new TV series, \"The Breaking Point\", turned out to be a resounding success and propel him to widespread fame in Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\nA versatile performer, he has achieved sensational success in both singing and acting. He has also shown his talents behind the camera, directing several of his own music videos throughout the years, mixing contemporary settings with special effects. In 2007, he wrote and directed a musical film titled \"A Melody Looking\" shot in New York. It features him and the rest of the A Music family of singers. This film marks his debut as a director.\n\nIn the recent years, he has participated in many charity events. His contribution to children is further recognized by being appointed as UNICEF Special Representative to Youth at UNICEF Headquarters in New York. He also occasionally helps other non-profit organizations to raise funds. His tryst with serious charity work started when his father had carcinoma of the rectum at an advanced stage. The doctors said he was incurable. But when his father went through an operation, he prayed to the Buddha to let the operation be successful and he will do a lot of good things to thank heaven. The operation was successful and his father got cured. So when the cancer foundation and the U.N. organization approached him for help, he started getting involved in charity work actively.\n\nHe has been elected as one of The Ten Outstanding Young Persons (TOYP) in 1997, giving him a formal recognition of his professional endeavors and commitment to the community. He was also awarded the Medal of Honor (M.H.) in October 2003.\n\nHe has been associated with many female celebrities since he began his career. One of his most famous rumored ex-girlfriends is Hsu Chi. He is currently in a relationship with one of the famous models in HK named Gaile Lok.\n\nHe is hot, cool, handsome, awesome, fantastic, excellent, fabulous, great and terrific! Many of his fans see him as their \"Prince Charming\" or their \"Knight in Shining Armor.\" His \"electric\" eyes and cute smile can easily freeze a girl in her path and his \"sweet and warm smile\" can melt people!\n\nEditor:Yang Jie"
