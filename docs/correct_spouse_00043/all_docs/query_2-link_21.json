        "text": "This was recently highlighted when his luxury duplex at The Somerset in Repulse Bay was reportedly put up for sale on June 29. The flat that Cheung and his wife – former Hong Kong actress May Lo – are selling, was originally two separate units and is 4,655 sq ft. The couple bought the first unit in 1993 and the second in 2004, for a total of US$5.7 million (HK$46.3 million).\n\nThe selling price of this property today is US$55 million (HK$430 million). Yes, more than nine times their purchase price. The flat comes with four parking spaces and the building has a shared swimming pool and playground.\n\nThe couple has already moved into their new home, which is the reason they are selling this duplex that they, along with their daughters – Zoe, 20 and Zie, 15 – have lived in since it was refurbished.\n\nThe “God of Songs”, or as some are calling him now, “God of Property”, is said to own at least five units there. The total market value of his portfolio is around HK$800 million. All the property he owns is rented out, excepting the one his family lives in, earning him at least HK$1 million every month.\n\nForbes included him in their list of richest Chinese stars in 2017. Fan Bingbing topped that list with 300 million yuan, with Cheung at No 57, with an estimated net worth of 120 million yuan. His net worth is certainly much greater than that now.\n\nHis other properties are said to be a penthouse in Repulse Bay, a flat in Elm Tree Towers at Jardine’s Lookout, and two units in Paramount Building in Chai Wan, which is industrial and non-residential. The industrial units were priced at HK$13.8 million when he bought them in 2017.\n\nA unit in Elm Tree Towers sells for about HK$42.5 million, with a monthly rent of HK$70,000, while a penthouse in Repulse Bay could go for up to HK$178 million.\n\nCheung has been investing in properties since the early 1990s. Though there have been reports that he was bankrupt at one time, due to an investment linked to Lehman Brothers, he reportedly always paid in cash for his properties. His wife, Lo, is the one who manages his property portfolio."
