These days when she’s not on a surfboard she’s working on her jewelry line Smoky Roses, which launched earlier this year. She talks to Andrea Lo about moving to Bali, her marriage to ex-husband and Cantopop legend Leon Lai, and why she no longer considers herself a model.",

        "text": "I was born in Macau. I’m part-Chinese, part-Vietnamese. We emigrated to America when I was 7 months old.\n\nI grew up in San Francisco. I love it there because there are so many different cultures. Schools educate you about the different holidays: everyone celebrates Martin Luther King Day and Chinese New Year.\n\nGrowing up in such a diverse environment, I loved being creative.\n\nI was already modeling in America, and when I came back here one summer, I left one of my composite cards behind. An agency called me one day and said there was a commercial that it wanted me to come back for.\n\nI didn’t feel culture shock here, because I’m Chinese—but I felt very lost in the city. Finding a building here seems impossible.\n\nMy home will always be San Francisco because of my family being there, but I am able to easily adapt anywhere.\n\nAfter my divorce, I was traveling to a lot of places. I was in London, New York, then back in San Francisco.\n\nI had a three-week break. My friend in Bali told me to visit, so I went there. I fell in love with the place.\n\nEvery year I spend three months in Bali, three months in San Francisco and about six months here.\n\nOne day, I was looking at jewelry and the idea came spontaneously. I had a friend teach me how to create jewelry, and it all just happened.\n\nI love standing on the beach, looking at stuff and finding inspiration. The minute my business partner tells me to go to meetings or talk to buyers, I have no idea.\n\nWhat I loved about being a model, more than the clothes, the photography and all that—is being able to go to all these amazing places that I wouldn’t have gone to otherwise.\n\nModeling is always a challenge. There is always criticism. You’re here for a reason—you have to believe in that and not let people try to make your day a bad one.\n\nI try not to think of myself as a model. I’m a creative person and I don’t want to be labeled.\n\nI’ve been surfing for two years now. I can get up on my own—I don’t need people to push me anymore. I call myself a surfer, because I’ve been in a Japanese surf magazine!\n\nOnce, I was buying something at the airport. The woman at the cashier said, “You’re Shu Qi.” I didn’t say anything and smiled. She kept asking, “Are you sure you’re not? You really are.”\n\nThe third time she said it, the person lining up behind me said, “Oh my God, lady, that’s Gaile Lok. Do you not even know who she is?”\n\nI have met Shu Qi before and think she’s a wonderful actress. I don’t think we look alike—but at least [people are comparing me to] someone who looks amazing.\n\nI still go out, because I remain a shareholder in some of the clubs. I like to go and enjoy myself. And I’m single, so why not?\n\nI don’t think it’s hard to date. I’ve enjoyed every relationship, good and bad.\n\nNow I have time for myself, and I’m really enjoying it.\n\nI’m not usually in contact with people I’ve dated before, but there are no hard feelings, bad emails or name-calling. We are all adults.\n\nMy marriage to Leon was a chapter in my life, and I’ve learned so much. We’ve both been through a lot. I wish him all the best, and I’m fine as well, so that’s it.\n\nI do believe in love. I just do not believe that love happens for everyone. People ask me if I’m going to get married again—it might happen, it might not.\n\nEveryone has regrets. I try not to think about it. Looking back to 10 or 15 years ago, I would never have guessed that I would be like this.\n\nI’ve been through a lot of dark times, but I’ve managed to always pull out of them."
