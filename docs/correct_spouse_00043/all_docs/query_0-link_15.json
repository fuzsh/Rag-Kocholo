        "text": "Leon Lai and Gaile Lok, seen in this undated photo, held their wedding ceremony in the Maldives on Thursday, March 13, 2008, news portal Web site Sina.com.cn reported on Saturday. [File Photo: ent.sina.com.cn]\n\nHong Kong pop star Leon Lai and his girlfriend, model Gaile Lok, got married on Thursday in a low-key wedding ceremony held in the Maldives, news portal Web site Sina.com.cn reported on Saturday.\n\nOnly a few close friends were invited to the ceremony, the report says.\n\nThe couple traveled to the Maldives by air two days before the wedding ceremony to make preparations. A friend attending the ceremony revealed that the couple chose the Maldives as their wedding place after being impressed by the romantic local scenery during a trip there last year.\n\nLeon and Gaile first met years ago after the pop king invited the fashion model to shoot a promo for his Web site, LeonStarEast.com. But the Romeo and Juliet couple waited several years to fall in love, being brought together again by their common interest in red wine.\n\nLeon will not be interrupting his honeymoon to attend the premiere of a new film next week but he did find time to finish the promotional campaign for the upcoming blockbuster before the start of the honeymoon, the Sina report says.\n\n(CRI March 17, 2008)"
