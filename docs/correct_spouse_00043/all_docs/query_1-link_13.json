According to insider news, the TV Queen battle is between Kate Tsui and Tavia Yeung.This isn't Kate's first year nominated for TV Queen, but when the media and audience think she's qualified for the award, there will bound to be many gossips and rumors spreading around. Basically, the actresses who are lucky enough to be on the headlines are either first line FaDans or those seen as good actresses.To some extent, even if the FaDan ends up losing the award, they still won the opportunity for more exposure and momentum.Kate said honestly: \"In the recent year, I haven't had too many gossips, but that means I don't have anything to do. There will only jobs when you have more news! It was rumored Tavia and I don't get along, but will that really make me popular? If so, then I don't mind the rumor!\"Many artists have said before, \"It doesn't matter whether if I'm popular or not. The most important is that there is always a role for me and songs for me to sing.\" Do you believe this? Raymond Lam came from a wealthy background, but he's still working real hard to gain recognition from the audience.Kate is very frank, she wants both the fame and awards. Since Highs and Lows began broadcasting, there has been a lot of positive reaction in the public and many are complimenting Kate's performance. In the series, she plays a Drug Queen, which is rarely seen in TV series. There were several beyond television-scale scenes that appeared in this series, such as Kate injecting drugs and getting gang raped. This is considered quite risky to an actress' reputation. She said, \"Telling an actress to go do drugs, not everyone can accept it. Audience will either like it or won't like it.\"Earlier Raymond Lam said in an interview that no other actress fits this role as much as Kate does. It is clear that Raymond is her supporter. Kate helplessly said: \"Many people have been telling me the same thing within these last two or three years. Actually, it's kinda difficult on me. Every time I play such an extreme character, yes there is a lot of room for development, but I will never be liked by audience. On average, audience like to see more of the Linda Chung types, the good girls.\"Tavia Yeung Cries AmazinglyIt's only two months left before the TVB anniversary awards, Kate and Tavia's news and rumors have already started popping up on the headlines.\"I really enjoy being on the list because it's quite nice that people are talking about me. If you're not too stubborn about it, those fabricated news are actually beneficial to artists. I just want some noise! Every year at the awards ceremony, I'm just sitting there. If there is an opportunity for me to say a few words, I would be happy even if it was just one or two camera shots. I'm dressed so nicely for the ceremony, don't let it go to waste!\"Tavia has been in the industry for 13 years, and it's only been 8 years for Kate. Based on qualification and seniority, Kate loses to Tavia, but recently Tavia's \"car shaking\" news has really damaged her image. Perhaps Heaven is trying to help Kate, her chances of becoming TV Queen suddenly jumped.\"It's not calculated like that. My image had never been that good either! Before I entered the industry, I already liked watching Ah Yi (Tavia) in costume dramas because I thought she really fits with the ancient feel. I've watched her acting in the studio next door before. Wah! She was continuously doing a crying scenes for 3 takes and her tears still came out like a faucet! She's seriously amazing. I'm still training myself, my goal is to be able to control my tears.\"Tears, indeed requires practice. Actually, a normal person living a happy life won't just start crying out of the blue, but as an artist, it is necessary for them to control their emotions just as if they are controlling their hands and feet.\"When I was young, my nickname was 'Crybaby Kate'. My dad was fierce, he would beat me until I stop crying. He disciplined me like I was a boy. The first few years after my debut, crying scenes gave me a headache. I remember back when I was shooting Price of Greed, we were shooting some 10 scenes a day, and I had to be crying in 5-6 of those scenes. If I couldn't cry, then I get yelled at! The staff would stand next to you and nag in your ears, 'Hey it's time to eat, are you done? Still can't cry? Are you serious!' One time, someone stood in front of me and started yelling at me, using profanity too, but I knew they were just trying to help me.\"Now that Kate's older and has more experience, she can just cry when she's asked to. In Highs and Lows, she is the drug queen Chan Ka Bik, a girl coming from a pitiful background. Kate got too into character that she actually did feel down emotionally: \"When I drive home after work, I would just start thinking that the lives of humans are so hard, then I start crying.\"Newcomer Award BackfiredIn regards to awards, it's not like Kate hasn't won one before. In 2004, she entered the industry as a four-award Miss HK winner. She truly understands that it's all based on the right timing, so she will first have to do the best on her own part. \"When I was participating in Miss HK, I thought to myself, its either I don't get any award, or I get it all. You have to understand the Miss HK system, we start by signing a contract, if you get an award, then you have to stay with TVB for a year. As for the salary, it is based on how many awards you win! My first award was the sponsored, Fitness Award, if I couldn't get the other awards, then my monthly salary would have been a few thousand dollars. How will I be able to survive? I told myself, 'No that won't do, work harder!'\"The so-called hard work, is to treat yourself like a good student and the Miss HK personal assistant is your instructor. If they tell you to walk left, then you must not walk right.\"Must handle everything seriously. Attendance is taking daily, so I tried my best not to get a tardy. One time, we were suddenly given an assignment, which was to write a 200 word self-introduction. I first wrote a draft and counted exactly 200 words, no more, no less, before turning it in.\"In 2007, she cut her hair really short for On the First Beat, but people heavily criticized her for looking ugly, having a swollen face and poor acting. Fortunately in 2008, she participated in Johnny To's Eye In the Sky working alongside Film Kings Simon Yam and Tony Leung. She gained recognition and won the 'Best New Performer' at the 27th Hong Kong Film Awards.You would think Kate helped TVB win an honor, but will her colleagues really be happy for her? Sorry, people weren't waiting to congratulate her, but to give her the cold shoulder.\"Actually the experience the award brought me was greater than expected. To me, the newcomer award is given to the newcomer that had expectional performance, but it wasn't that simple. Although you gained recognition in the film circle, but back in the TV circle, people had higher expectations on you. They would say, 'You're great, won the award, why are you back here shooting TV series?' There were a lot of nasty comments behind my back. There was actually a director that once said to me, 'I believe you came back thinking you know everything and now you're not listening to what you're being told to do!'\"\"My work ethics was the same as before, but people thought I turned cocky. Then later I realized after I got the award, I have to be even more modest, low-profile and look down on myself more than before.\"Even if this year, Kate is a hot favorite for TV Queen, she said: \"I have a shadow, I'm really afraid what happened before will happen again because there will always be people that think I don't deserve the award.\"\n\nclass=\"ipsType_pagetitle\" style=\"font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 26px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.3; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(50, 50, 50); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); \"Audience Complains Kate Tsui's 1 Second Gang Rape SceneFriday October 26, 2012 Hong KongSource: Oriental Daily, Mingpao (images)Translated by: aZnangel @ http://asianuniverse.net/forums/\n\nIn the latest TVB series, Highs and Lows, Kate Tsui puts her Miss HK image behind her and played a tragic character. She had to play a drug addict and get gang raped by 4 men. She is now a hot favorite for the TV Queen title based on her role in this series. Last night, the infamous gang rape scene broadcasted, but it was a huge disappointment for audience. The scene was about Lee Ka Ding injecting drugs into Kate, making her lose consciousness and then four men start laughing, \"When is it my turn?\" In that whole scene, there was no place that allowed Kate to develop her character and the entire gang rape scene was just a few seconds. The viewers who have been watching 22 episodes of the series were very disappointed. Yesterday the OPCA received 3 complaints on the related scene.Yesterday Kate was in Shanghai to attend an auto race event. She accepted an interview over the phone and expressed she's grateful to have everyone's attention. She said: \"Don't be upset. When I was filming that scene, I gave it all I got and followed what the director told me to do. The edited version gave audience room for some imagination. After all, there are limitations on television. Actually, the message behind the whole scene is the most important. We want to promote anti-drugs and show what drugs can lead to as a consequence. So that scene just touched on it. I think it's good to leave some room for imagination. Aiya! It's not nice to see me take off my clothing either! (You just turned into a victim out of nowhere?) Didn't think about it. (Netizens praised your acting improved a lot?) I'm very happy. Well then, I'll have to drive faster in the race, hope everyone will watch until the finale!\" As a result, Kate ended the race in 5th place, her time was 3 minutes 14 seconds. First place was Chin Kar Lok, 3 minutes 7 seconds.Producer Lam Chi Wah expressed it is related to the television scale, and to take the audience's feelings into account. They didn't want the audience to feel disturbed, therefore how that scene was explained was reasonable. He said: \"We didn't cut that scene, Netizens have been focused too much on the gang rape scene, that they are thinking too much. We did say before that the story will indirectly explain that the rape happened, but won't show the process. (But Fala Chen's bra-revealing scene was broadcasted!) That scene won't make people feel uncomfortable in reality.\" Netizens wanted a 'refund'? The producer expressed he will continue to make more good series to repay the audience.Ella Koon responded to audience's disappointment of the gang rape, she said: \"Really? Her acting is great, every one of us had a lot of room to develop the roles. That scene was suppose to promote anti-drugs. Why are the audience so psycho and want to watch gang rape?\" But Ella supported Kate, \"Perhaps it's an issue of television scale and editing, the scene wasn't used after all, that is a little disappointing.\"\n\nclass=\"ipsType_pagetitle\" style=\"font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 26px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.3; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(50, 50, 50); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); \"Kate Tsui Denies the Rumors with Leon Lai & Bosco Wong\n\nTVB series Highs and Lows starring Kate Tsui, Raymond Lam and Michael Miu has been doing very well in the TV ratings. Kate especially hosted a celebration dinner with the entire cast and crew.Recently, Kate's gang rape scene has been getting heated response on the internet and Netizens have been actively discussing. Kate's recent rumors are also pretty shocking as well! A magazine reported that the divorced Leon Lai sparked love with Kate while working in Mainland. Another magazine reported that she hooked up with Bosco Wong, who had just fallen out of love. That day, Kate laughed off both rumors. She said she hasn't seen Leon since they collaborated in a commercial many years ago. It was also said Leon had fallen in love with women with thick lips? Kate refused to admit that she has thick lips. She laughed: \"I haven't been following the news, the magazine are trying to categorize those women, I don't think I have thick lips, I really don't think so!\"As for Bosco, she said she encountered him a few days ago at the car racing competition in Shanghai. Kate said she was busy partying with her fans in Shanghai and basically had no time to be with Bosco. As for the photo published on the magazine of her hugging Bosco after winning the race? Kate said: \"I hugged everyone when I won the race. They (the media) just took that one photo and published it. That's it.\" She revealed in the next film she's shooting, she and Bosco are going to be a pair again. Perhaps that was to prepare the start of the rumors. She is mentally prepared for that, \"I can't help it. It will keep coming, and this isn't the first time. We all understand, basically there is no such thing, so I just laugh it off and move one.\" When asked if she had comforted Bosco after his break up? She said coldly: \"Bosco, I didn't care about him, nor do is it necessary. He's a big man, he doesn't need me to care about him.\"_________________________________________________________Source: Mingpao, Oriental Daily, CSM (by wacow)Translated by: aZnangel @ http://asianuniverse.net/forums/\n\nTVB Rating Reports (22/10/2012 - 28/10/2012)\n\nDramasSilver Spoon Sterling Shackles - 名媛望族 (EPS 01-06) - 29 PTS (Peaking at 35 PTS)\n\nHighs and Lows - 雷霆掃毒 (EPS 20-23) - 29 PTS\n\nCome Home Love - 爱·回家 (EPS 114-118) - 25 PTS\n\n(CSM Media Research: 1 point represents 64,070 viewers)\n\nComplaints- SSSS: 32 complaints.

There were over a thousand fans that went to support Raymond, jamming both sides of the location. When Raymond appeared, the fans were out of control screaming loudly. Raymond was surrounded by the security, but fans tried hard reaching out to get close interaction with their idol. Raymond enthusiastically stopped and shook hands with fans.\n\nAs Ernest Borel's spokesman, Raymond frankly expressed he has never worn matching watches with a girlfriend because he never gave couple watches to her. Actually he has given one to his mother and younger sister. When speaking of the Highs and Lows finale last night, he laughed: \"Actually I will be attending the finale event tonight (last night), but I lied to 3 Gor (Michael Miu) that I wouldn't make it, even the producer won't know that I'm going. (Do you have confidence on the ratings?) Actually I already know just reading the feedback online. I really thank you all for the support, many people are calling me by my character name now.\"\n\nAs the series is so popular, Raymond frankly expressed he has confidence to to become this year's TV King. \"I've been nominated for many years, since I was 20 something, I was already nominated. (This year Damian Lau is your greatest competitor?) There are many strong competitors every year, I really hope I'm part of it. Currently, I'm only doing one series per year, so I really hope Happy Sir can get it. This was a very serious production. (Get TV King and Queen with Kate?) I hope so. When Kate first heard of the story, she was thinking how will people react to her Drug Queen role? How would the outcome be? I told her, I can't think of anyone else that could be more suitable for this role than you.\" When speaking of the year-end music awards, Raymond said: \"Is it public voting? I have confidence too, public voting will be more interactive for the audience and fans.

The ambitious Ben tried working elsewhere without hesitation, such as in Mainland and ATV. However, after all the switching around, he finally ended back at his 'maternal home' (TVB). In the first few years, he was pretty much getting ignored. Feeling discouraged, Ben went and complained to Virgina Lok: \"You said I can't do it when you didn't even give me a chance to do it. That isn't fair to me!\" It wasn't until his role as 'Spicy Ginger' (Lak Geung) in Lives of Omission when he won recognition again!\n\nBEN: When I left TVB, I was very ambitious, I thought there was a need for me to work elsewhere and make a breakthrough. I've collaborated with many different actors from several different places, from Mainland to Taiwan to Singapore. I've filmed series for a different market. At the time once I left TVB, the first person I got to work with was golden scriptwriter Wai Ka Fai and co-starred Sean Lau and Adam Cheng. Was I feeling proud? Yes I was! You can say whatever about me, but I was very happy to be able to be in a Wai Ka Fai script! I spent a few years shooting TV series in Mainland, yes I did earn money, but I wasn't getting anywhere. Casting was not made just for you, unless you go fight for it with someone, but I didn't want to leave my hometown and be like that! HK doesn't broadcast Mainland series, so the people in HK would think you disappeared or went to ATV!\n\n\"I Have Family To Raise\"\n\nBack at TVB, I believed they never saw my performances, like I was still on probation to them. You have to endure through the process, earn that trust back and let people know that you can still withstand this! Before the 'Spicy Ginger' role, my position was sometimes high and low at other times. When you are asked to make a guest appearance, the producer will tell you, 'there is a story, and I want you to do it, but it's only three episodes.' That just means you recognize my abilities, but you don't have the courage to actually let me go do it. That's really strange. Sometimes, I'm only participating in 3 episodes, but they hold me on the schedule as if its a 20 episode series. How will I make a living then? I'm not an actor who owns a [Mercedes] Benz and have my own driver, I actually really do have to raise a family! You hold me on the schedule as if it was a 20 episode series, but just give me the money for doing 3 episodes, then that really is a setback for me.\n\n\"It's Unfair\"\n\nIf you have persistence, then you will bound to gain some trust. But my persistence left me discouraged, then why don't I just leave! If I'm not working at TVB, then I can work elsewhere. However, you must insist and have faith. I just didn't know how long I had to wait! I'm rather optimistic, I would say: \"Just get through it!\" It wouldn't be good for me to say, \"Hey if you don't use me, it's your loss!\", right? I remember I told Miss Lok (Virgina Lok), you let me do it and I will show you I can do it! You didn't give me a chance to do it, and say I can't, that is unfair to me! Later, my manager at the time helped me get the 'Spicy Ginger' role and I'm really grateful.

The report stated Kate was the main person who caused Bosco Wong and Myolie Wu's break up. Last night, Kate attended the finale celebration dinner for TVB series Highs and Lows with the other cast Raymond Lam, Michael Miu, Ben Wong and Ella Koon. The report clearly caused a great impact on her. When she mentioned about the related report, there was tears glowing in her eyes, \"Now that the series is over, I hope these terrifying headlines will stop. I am indeed unhappy about this. Seriously, I want to clarify once again that there is absolutely nothing between Bosco and I. These reports does not only damage my reputation, but also affects my friendships. It is nonsense, worthless and shouldn't be happening.\"\n\nKate frankly expressed the rumor has affected her friendship: \"I'm saying this for the last time, Bosco and I are unrelated. There is no such thing, we are just colleagues at work. These reports makes me feel terrible.\" Kate said the magazine labeled her as the 'sl*t Goddess', she honestly feels helpless: \"I am indeed upset, I just feel so wronged because I never done such thing. I didn't do anything wrong, my conscience is clear.\"\n\nWhen asked if she's afraid the report will affect her votes for TV Queen? She said: \"I hope everyone won't get affected by fabricated reports. I really used my heart in the performance.\" Kate smiled and said when she was buying coffee, the cashier wrote her character name \"Chan Ka Bik\" on the coffee cup. She said: \"I'm so grateful, very pleased with the results and I hope the ratings can reach near 40 points.\"\n\nRaymond and Michael paid for the dinner that night. Raymond was asked about the artists in The Confidant and Silver Spoon Sterling Shackles becoming the hot favorites for anniversary awards? He said: \"I'm banished to work in Hengdian, and couldn't even watch my own series until the next day. I don't have time to worry about the others.\" Raymond will rely on his fans to help him pull in more votes. When asked who he supports for TV Queen this year? He said: \"I will support Kate. She is the only one who can do this character.\" When speaking of the great disappointment in Kate Tsui's gang rape scene ended up being only 1 second? Raymond said: \"From my understanding, it was not 1 second. If we get the Best Series award, I will tell the director to make a Director's Cut for the series!\""
