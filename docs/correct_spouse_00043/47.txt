Last week, news broke that Leon Lai Ming and model girlfriend, Gaile Lok got married in the Maldives. The couple arrived separately at Hong Kong and Taiwan airports yesterday amidst a large crowd of reporters.

Hong Kong pop king Leon Lai and his girlfriend, model Gaile Lok, got

married on Thursday in a low-key wedding ceremony held in the Maldives.

Regarding the marriage rumors, both Leon and Gaile answered, "No comment." However, both Leon and Gaile appeared to be in especially high spirits and could not mask the new joys of marriage.

Since Gaile had to appear at a Chloe fashion show in Taiwan, Leon sent an assistant from his production company to aid Gaile. Like Leon, Gaile was not spotted wearing a wedding ring. Asked whether she and Leon got married in the Maldives, she only smiled and responded in English, "No comment!"

While attending a Chloe show later in the evening, Gaile said, "I am not pregnant. I did not get married, otherwise my parents would know. However, Leon would be the ideal man to propose to me."
