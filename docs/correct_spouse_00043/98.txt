4 Oct – Leon Lai may have refused to make any comments about his divorce and Gaile Lok may be avoiding it without a straight answer, but the latest report of her alleged New Zealand beau may have been answer enough for the state of their marriage.

Popular Asians website reported that according to the latest buzz, Gaile Lok has found a new man in the form of a 35-year-old New Zealander known as Cuz.

Sources revealed that Lok and Cuz were introduced by a mutual friend and their relationship quickly developed after Lok's frequent visits to Bali. The model was also spotted heading to Bali last week, where she was snapped by paparazzi, while waiting for her beau on a motorbike.

Cuz also uploaded a few photos of Lok on Instagram, showing Leon Lai's wife lying on a bed, exposing her underwear to the camera while cuddling up to Cuz's pet dog, fuelling speculations about their relationship. The photo had since been deleted.

The new beau is just one the many reports about Lok after her miscarriage earlier this year prompting rumours of her divorce with Leon Lai. The model was also rumoured to be reconciling with former boyfriend Ray Ng after investing money in Ray's Mexican restaurant and was reported to have been discussing her divorce settlement – with Lok denying both rumours since then.

Meanwhile, 41-year-old Leon Lai is still laying low in Beijing and refused to comment on the subject. However, an insider stated that the actor has finally given up and is intending to make an official announcement about their situation soon.
