HONG KONG: Hong Kong pop star Leon Lai's model ex-wife Gaile Lok has remarried, tying the knot in an intimate ceremony in California last weekend with businessman Ian Chu.

Dressed in a bejewelled white and gold V-neck gown, her ceremony was attended by about 50 of the couple's closest family and friends.
