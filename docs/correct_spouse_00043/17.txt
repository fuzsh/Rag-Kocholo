Hong Kong model Gaile Lok is officially a hot mama.

Gaile, ex-wife of Canto-pop star Leon Lai, took to Instagram on Sunday (April 28) to announce the arrival of her newborn son.

In the photo, Gaile was all smiles and overflowing with motherly love, as she held onto her baby to pose for the 'gram.

The 38-year-old mother also said that she will be taking time off from social media for a while to enjoy her time with her new born.

"I cannot imagine a life without you. Your little hands stole my heart and your little feet walked away with it. You are the best thing that ever happened in my life. I love you baby Hunter E. Chu, and can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you," she wrote.

The fitness enthusiast also thanked nurses, doctors and all the mums on Instagram who have supported her through her pregnancy journey.

Gaile, who married businessman Ian Chu in 2017, revealed her pregnancy last November, and also asked for birthing tips via her Instagram.

The first-time mother wrote: "My (pregnancy) journey isn't over yet, and is just about to start another chapter. It is a time to only bond and connect with my baby and family, so I won't be updating my Instagram for awhile as this is the time to tune off!

"Confinement month here I come, and see you all when I can!"
