[Update April 24, 2018] Leon Lai has quietly welcomed a daughter with girlfriend Wing Chan.

She delivered a 2.3kg baby girl on Monday (April 23), a few weeks ahead of her due date in May, Apple Daily Hong Kong reported.

In a Facebook post on Tuesday (April 24) afternoon, Lai thanked the medical team who helped deliver his child and praised them for their professionalism.

Despite efforts to keep the birth secret, a news leak caused reporters to swarm the hospital.

Lai did not take kindly to the incident, saying that media presence had disturbed staff and patients there.

Addressing the media, Lai said that he will not be making another appearance at the hospital.

As parents of a preemie, they have to focus on caring for the baby under the doctor's guidance, he wrote.

Leon Lai's finally becoming a dad.

He is the latest of Hong Kong's Four Heavenly Kings to welcome a baby.

The 51-year-old singer announced the good news in a Facebook post on Monday (March 19), putting recent baby rumours to rest.

Lai wrote: "It is a kind of fate for two divorcees to have a chance to be together."

"With the baby, I'll be entering a new phase of life. As a father, I need to protect my family by not exposing them to the public eye."

"As for our future, only time will tell."

Lai was reported to be dating 32-year-old Wing Chan who works as a sales manager in his record label Amusic.

Speculations of him becoming a dad surfaced after Chan was spotted with a baby bump.

She has now cut down on work to rest at home - a HKD60 million (S$10 million) mansion in Hong Kong's New Territories that she shares with Lai, Oriental Sunday reported.

According to Apple Daily Hong Kong, she is expecting a baby girl who is due in May.

Chan has been said to bear a resemblance to Lai's ex-wife Gaile Lok. They parted ways in 2012 after a four-year marriage. The model wed businessman Ian Chu last year.

With a baby on the way, we wonder when wedding bells will ring for Leon Lai.
