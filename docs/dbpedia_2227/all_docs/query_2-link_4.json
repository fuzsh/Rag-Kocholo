        "text": "On Monday, the former lawyer of the late Deborah Jeane Palfrey—known as the “D.C. Madam”—released some names of the government agencies, companies, and groups that purportedly called Palfrey’s escort service between 2000 and 2006.\n\nIn the court filing, lawyer Montgomery Blair Sibley listed 174 entities that had dialed the service, Pamela Martin & Associates. The roster includes the FBI, State Department, Department of Commerce, Department of Health and Human Services, IRS, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, and U.S. Coast Guard.\n\nSo far, no names of specific individuals from this list of 174 have been released. (Since February, Sibley has been trying to void a 2007 restraining order, which reportedly bars him from releasing records Palfrey gave him prior to her death.)\n\n“I am not releasing any individual names … yet,” Sibley assured reporters in an email. When asked by The Daily Beast when such names would be released and what his next steps are, Sibley simply replied, \"Not sure on all questions.\"\n\nSibley had previously appeared on The Alex Jones Show (a hotbed of conspiracy-theory-mongering that has been suggesting that the D.C. Madam records could very well contain information damaging to Ted Cruz) on Friday afternoon. Sibley insists that the information he has from the Verizon Wireless records is “relevant to the upcoming presidential election.”\n\nHe would not specify how or why, and has remained vague throughout. In the summer of 2007, Republican senator David Vitter admitted that he had been a client of the D.C. Madam prostitution service."
