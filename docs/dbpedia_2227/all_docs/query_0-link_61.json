The raw image documents (not searchable) were released in 2007 and an on-line (unreleased) database of the material was constructed by four University of Brandeis students. However, since the suicide of \"Madame\" Palfrey following a court conviction, her website has been changed to read (11 May 2008) \"deborahjeanepalfrey.com is off line until further notice.\" and the Brandeis site \"We are saddened to learn of Ms. Palfrey's death and hope that her friends and family can find comfort at a difficult time. We have decided to permanently retire the site in the coming days\"\n\nSee wikipedia:Deborah Jeane Palfrey for further context.\n\nContext\n\nUnited States\n\nPrimary language\n\nFile size in bytes\n\n2192438\n\nFile type information\n\nPDF document, version 1.7\n\nCryptographic identity\n\nSHA256 01f8a2e38f6888ee21e7fdb49b3846fd1fa2cda0a11f034c8dda9b9c0475ba8c"
