        "text": "The mighty and wealthy of Washington were braced for scandal yesterday after the woman known as the DC Madam said she hoped to expose dozens of clients of her exclusive escort service at her trial. Deborah Jeane Palfrey appeared in court on charges of running a prostitution ring that operated among the upper echelons of the US capital for 13 years.\n\nThe scandal has already claimed its first scalp in political Washington, with the resignation last Friday of Randall Tobias, who headed the US Agency for International Development.\n\nMs Palfrey told reporters she felt sorry for Mr Tobias, but chided him for not coming foward earlier because it might have helped her defence. \"Had he done so earlier, along with many, many others who have used my company's services throughout the years, I most likely would not be in my current predicament,\" she said after her court appearance.\n\nMr Tobias confirmed to ABC television that he used the services of the DC Madam, but insisted these did not include sex, only massages. That line suits Ms Palfrey, who argues in her defence that she had no idea the women she employed as escorts were engaged in prostitution.\n\nShe claims her company, Pamela Martin & Associates, was a \"sexual, albeit legal, business\". It offered what it described as exclusive escort services to high profile clients, employing only women with college degrees. She says her firm had a client list of more than 10,000, including political officials, chief executive officers and other members of the Washington elite.\n\nThe prosecution says she ran more than 132 prostitutes out of her California home, charging $300 an hour for their services.\n\nThe DC Madam's looming legal costs appear paramount in her deliberations about her telephone records. She earlier sought to sell the list of numbers, which she claims weighs in at 46lb (21kg). After the federal judge barred the sale, she decided to hand them over to ABC television. It went on to out Mr Tobias.\n\nThe network is producing a show on the other names it has gleaned from the records later this week. \"My hope that defence witnesses could be found by combing through the information indeed is being realised,\" she said."
