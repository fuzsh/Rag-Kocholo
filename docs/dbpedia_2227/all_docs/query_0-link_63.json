        "text": "\"If taken into custody, my physical safety and most probably my very life would be jeopardized,\" she wrote in August 1991 following an attempt to bring her to trial, \"Rape, beating, maiming, disfigurement and more than likely murder disguised in the form of just another jailhouse accident or suicide would await me,\" said Palfrey in a handwritten letter to the judge accusing the San Diego police vice squad of having a vendetta against her.\n\nDuring several recent appearances on The Alex Jones Show, Palfrey also said that she was at risk of being killed and that authorities would make it look like suicide. She made it clear that she was not suicidal and if she was found dead it would be murder.\n\nPalfrey had threatened to release the names of well-known clients of her upscale call girl ring in the nation's capitol, and had indicated that Dick Cheney may be one of them.\n\n\"No I'm not planning to commit suicide,\" Palfrey told The Alex Jones Show on her last appearance, \"I'm planning on going into court and defending myself vigorously and exposing the government,\" she said.\n\n\"This is a woman who was divorced, who was trying to raise two, ah, high-school children, college-age children,\" Palfrey said. \"Great job title, the great position, all the respect in the world, but she wasn't making enough money. So she decided to do a little moonlighting.\"\n\nPalfrey added, \"And she was publicly outed, is a good way to put it, she was absolutely humiliated. Ah, she couldn't take the humiliation. Her whole life was destroyed. And she, she just, ah, ultimately committed suicide.\""
