        "text": "WASHINGTON — The former lawyer of Deborah Jeane Palfrey — dubbed the “D.C. Madam” — has filed a motion to allow the release of her escort services’ records, saying they “may contain information relevant to the upcoming presidential election.”\n\nPalfrey committed suicide in 2008 following a racketeering conviction.\n\nMontgomery Blair Sibley, whose legal strategies and motions often included antagonizing opposing counsel and judges, has filed a judicial conduct complaint against Chief Judge Richard Roberts, of the District Court of the District of Columbia.\n\nSibley, whose license to practice law was suspended in 2008 for three years by the D.C. Court of Appeals, remains under several 2007 restraining orders, which prohibited him from releasing Palfrey’s records.\n\nSibley won’t say how the records could affect the election.\n\n“I believe the information in my possession from the subpoena returns in the ‘D.C. Madam’ case may be relevant to the upcoming election,” Sibley told WTOP in an email. “As I am presently restrained by Court Order from releasing that information, I feel obligated to seek release from those restraining orders.”\n\nPalfrey’s escort service, Pamela Martin and Associates, operated in the nation’s capital from 1996 through 2007.\n\nSibley claims to have “815 names and 40 escort agency records,” which have remained under seal.\n\nIn July 2007, Palfrey and her attorney released her phone records for public viewing. After the release of the phone numbers, Louisiana Sen. David Vitter acknowledged being a customer of Palfrey’s service.\n\nJudge Gladys Kessler ordered Palfrey and her attorney to cease distributing her bookkeeping records.\n\nIn April 2008, a federal jury in Washington found Palfrey guilty of racketeering, money laundering, and mail fraud.\n\nPalfrey faced a maximum of 55 years in prison. Two weeks after her conviction, she committed suicide in Florida, in her mother’s shed.\n\nSibley, who in recent years has achieved a Masters Degree in Cyber Security Policy, and is the manager of Privacy Compliance Consulting, is representing himself in his attempt to be released from the restraining order.\n\nIn his recent complaint, Sibley claims Roberts prohibited his filing a motion about the judicial order.\n\n“Chief Judge Richard W. Roberts had physical possession of the Motion and had directed the Clerk’s Office to refused (sic) to file it,” Sibley wrote.\n\nA spokesperson for Roberts declined comment."
