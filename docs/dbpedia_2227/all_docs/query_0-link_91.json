        "text": "The so-called \"D.C. Madam\" apologized to her mother and sister in suicide notes released Monday, telling them she couldn't bear going to prison for running an elite Washington prostitution ring and saw killing herself as the only \"exit strategy.\"\n\n\"I cannot live the next 6-8 years behind bars for what you and I have come to regard as this 'modern day lynching,' only to come out of prison in my late '50s a broken, penniless and very much alone woman,\" Deborah Jeane Palfrey wrote in the note to her 76-year-old mother, Blanche.\n\nPalfrey, 52, hanged herself with a nylon rope Thursday in a shed outside her mother's mobile home in Tarpon Springs. Her mother discovered the body."
