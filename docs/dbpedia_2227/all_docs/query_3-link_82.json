        "text": "The alleged “D.C. Madam” revealed that one of her clients was the military strategist who helped invent the “shock and awe” war strategy – and her lawyer said more names are bound to come out.\n\nDeborah Jeane Palfrey said Harlan Ullman, a senior associate with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, was “one of the regular customers” of the Washington-based “erotic fantasy service” she ran for 13 years.\n\nUllman, a former U.S. Navy commander, ridiculed the claim.\n\n“The allegations are beneath the dignity of a comment,” he told The Associated Press.\n\nPalfrey, 50, claims she has the names of more than 10,000 clients. After she was indicted last month on charges of running a call-girl ring, she threatened to raise a defense fund by selling phone records that would reveal the names.\n\nHer civil lawyer told The Post the names of more alleged clients will appear in upcoming court documents.\n\n“Other people will be identified” as the case unfolds, Montgomery Blair Sibley said.\n\nProsecutors said Palfrey ran her business, Pamela Martin and Associates, from her Vallejo, Calif., home. They said she employed more than 130 women over the years, charged clients $200 to $300 a session, and generated more than $2 million.\n\nBut Palfrey denied she was in the prostitution business. Her court papers said she offered “legal sexual and erotic services across the spectrum of sexual behavior.”\n\nUllman is a regular columnist for the Washington Times and wrote analyses of the Iraq war for the New York Post during the opening weeks of combat.\n\nWith Post Wire Services"
