Thirteen former escorts and three former clients testified at her trial.[1][2][3] The witnesses were compelled to testify, after being granted immunity from prosecution. She was defended by Montgomery Blair Sibley.

Sibley countered with the final judicial remedy he can seek, invoking Supreme Court Rule 22.4[4], a plea to a second associate justice other than the one of original jurisdiction. He chose to file a plea to Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Clarence Thomas.[5]
