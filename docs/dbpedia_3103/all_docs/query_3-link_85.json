        "text": "After writing a long string of record-setting bestsellers, Patrick Dennis found himself no longer in fashion and struggling with a separation from his wife and family due to his repressed sexuality. He was quite a famous celebrity, and decided a bit of obscurity wouldn't be amiss. He sought domestic service jobs among the very rich (why give up on the lifestyle to which he had become accustomed?) working at last under his real name, Edward Tanner. (Patrick Dennis was a nom de plume. He also wrote several novels under the name Virginia Rowans.) He was immediately successful and popular as a butler -correct, witty, and able to provide social guidance when needed. Sadly, he became ill with pancreatic cancer. He returned to his wife, who nursed him through the end. There's an excellent biography of his life, Uncle Mame: The Life of Patrick Dennis, , by Eric Myers.\n\nDennis had a genius for writing gay camp, and passing off onto unsuspecting Scarsdale matrons. There are many gay characters in his books -Though often they are con men who take advantage of wealthy men. Try reading Genius, or Tony, or Paradise. The first is still in print and available in eBook formats. One of his best. For a political satire that will seem like it's ripped from today's headlines try to find a copy of First Lady: My Thirty Days Upstairs at the White House.\n\nEdward Tanner's real-life aunt, Marian Tanner, claimed to be the inspiration for the character -Something her nephew flatly denied. She never raised him, but she did blow through a fortune and a couple of husbands, and was known to be quite outspoken. Tanner, as Patrick Dennis, encouraged people to think it a true story as he was a total celebrity hound. When Auntie Mame was adapted for the Broadway stage, starring Rosalind Russell, he began to suggest that she herself was his inspiration, if not is real aunt.\n\nOne thing to love about DataLounge... a man like Tanner gets mentioned and his \"due\" from a few souls who know his work(s) and appreciate him.\n\nI read Auntie Mame years ago, adore the movie with Roz Russell, have never subjected myself to the film with Lucy... I never take Gary's advice either!\n\nI tried finding more of Dennis' works years ago and it was difficult (maybe a trip to The Strand in NYC now that restrictions have been lifted is warranted)?\n\nPerhaps I'll find some works by Olive Higgins Prouty as well - I've always wanted to read about the Vale family (you know, the Vales's of Boston and not just a lesser Vale like Charlotte)\n\nAs a very young gayling, i loved Auntie Mame the movie and started collecting his books, buying them at used book stores for a dollar or two, so i believe i had every book that Patrick Dennis published by my Sr. Year, 1981. I have them somewhere. After Auntie Mame, my favorite was How Firm a Foundation, but have never made it through First Lady, thereâ€™s a bunch of funny satirical photos, but the story, meh."
