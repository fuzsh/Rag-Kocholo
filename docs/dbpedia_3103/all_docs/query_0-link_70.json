Not in this Blogathon baby!\n\nFrom the heyday of Silent film and the advent of talking pictures to the late ‘20s to 1934 Pre-Code Hollywood, films were rife with provocative and suggestive images, where women were kicking up a storm on screen… The end of the code during the early 60s dared to offer social commentary about race, class, gender, and sexuality! That’s our party!\n\nIn particular, these bold women and the screen roles they adopted have become legendary. They sparked catchy dialogue, inspired fashion trends, or just plain inspired us… Altogether there are 111 of SOME of the most determined, empowered, and uniquely fortified femmes of classic film…!\n\nFirst of course I consulted the maven of all things splendid, shimmery, and SILENT for her take on silent film actresses and the parts that made them come alive on the immortal screen…. Fritzi at Movies Silently has summoned up these fabulous femmes…\n\nNow to unleash the gust of gals from my tornadic mind filled with favorite actresses and the characters that have retained an undying sacred vow to heroine worship… In their private lives, their public persona and the mythological stardom that has & still captivates generations of fans, the roles they brought to life, and the lasting influence that refuses to go away…!\n\nBecause they have their own unique rhythm to the way they moved through the world… a certain kind of mesmerizing allure, and/or they just didn’t give a hoot, a damn… nor a flying fig!\n\n“The most courageous act is still to think for yourself. Aloud”-Coco Chanel\n\nStars like Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Crawford, and Ida Lupino managed to keep re-inventing themselves. They became spirited women with an inner reserve of strength and a passion for following their desires!\n\nThe following actresses and their immortal characters are in no particular order…!\n\nGrande Dames/Guignol Cinema: Robert Aldrich’s Hag Cinema Part II: What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? 1962: “You mean all this time we could have been friends?”\n\nhttps://thelastdrivein.com/2013/07/21/edward-dmytryks-walk-on-the-wild-side-1962-at-the-doll-house-when-people-are-kind-to-each-other-why-do-they-have-to-find-a-dirty-word-for-it/\n\nThe Dark Drawer: Four Obscurely Fabulous Film Noir Fare…\n\nhttps://thelastdrivein.com/2014/04/23/when-the-spider-woman-looks-two-glorias-wicked-love-close-ups-old-jewels-the-sympathetically-tragic-villainesses-of-sunset-blvd-1950-and-draculas-daughter-1936/\n\nhttps://thelastdrivein.com/2021/11/27/31-flavors-of-noir-on-the-fringe-to-lure-you-in-part-2/\n\nSam Fuller’s The Naked Kiss (1965): Part I: “There’ll be no later, this town is clean”\n\nThe Bride Wore Black 1968: Jeanne Moreau… Goddess of the Hunt\n\nChapter 3 – Queers and Dykes in the Dark: Classic, Noir & Horror Cinema’s Coded Gay Characters:\n\nhttps://thelastdrivein.com/2011/01/05/phantom-ladyforgotten-cerebral-noir/\n\nSam Fuller’s The Naked Kiss (1965): Part I: “There’ll be no later, this town is clean”\n\nGrande Dame/Guignol Cinema: Robert Aldrich’s Hag Cinema Part V: Hush…Hush, Sweet Charlotte 1964 “You’re my favorite living mystery” “Have you ever solved me?”\n\nContinue reading “Enduring Empowerment : Women Who didn’t Give a Damn! …in Silent & Classic film!” →\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
