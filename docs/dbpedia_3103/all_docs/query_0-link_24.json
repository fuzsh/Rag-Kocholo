        "text": "Pretty sure I saw Napoleon Dynamite in theaters five times when it came out. I’m also relatively certain that my high school bestie and I ruined the experience for everyone else by laughing so hard. The goofball dick bf watching in the auditorium got us …\n\nThe NeverEnding Story is one of those perfectly messed up childhood movies that you watch now and feel like you belong to a special club. Because it’s a REALLY good 80’s movie. Based on a bonkers German fantasy novel by Michael Ende, The NeverEnding Story …\n\n30 years after its release (omg I’m OLD), Forrest Gump still holds up. Parts may not necessarily be as PC as they were once thought to be, but it’s still an A+ film that deserved all six of its Academy Award wins. That doesn’t even …\n\nHoney, I Shrunk the Kids– a classic family film that made every child in the 1980’s crave Little Debbie’s. Also the movie that made me realize grown ups should ALWAYS listen to their pets. QUARK KNEW EVERYTHING THE ENTIRE TIME SZALINSKI. Set in an unspecified …\n\nPost Indiana Jones, 1999’s The Mummy might be one of the best adventure films made. If you feel compelled at any time to watch the sequel tho (or the crap retry with Tom Cruise), think again. But this one is aces. Set in 1920’s Egypt, …\n\nAt some point I’ll have a series of menus based on movies from the 90’s that are actually based on literature– there were THREE in 1999 alone!

Loosely based on Shakespeare’s …\n\nBoondock Saints: “A juvenile, ugly movie that represents the worst tendencies of directors channeling Tarantino.” Fair enough. But it’s still a fun ride and Sean Patrick Flanery is feckin’ hot. If you grew up in the 90’s, you’ve likely seen Boondock Saints and have since …\n\nStarring the incomparable Rosalind Russell (ie the star of His Girl Friday and many other fast talking classics), Auntie Mame is a long time personal favorite. Initially set during the Prohibition era, the film follows bohemian socialite Mame Dennis, who is granted custody of her …\n\nA film by Jon Favreau, Elf has become a holiday staple in American households. I have to be honest– I was not initially a fan (I’m a bit of a Christmas movie snob). But I’m now happy to say that I’m no longer a cotton …\n\nIt’s almost Christmas as I write this, so Love Actually is, actually, all around. Thankfully, it’s a delightful movie full of relatable characters (except Kyra Knightly, who always sucks) and poignant moments that still make me ugly happy cry 20 yrs later. I have to …"
