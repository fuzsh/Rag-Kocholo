        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\n213 Chapter 10  Down South at Peckerwood: Mom, Anti-Mom, and Queer Pedagogy in Auntie Mame Jeff Solomon A Climax in North Hollywood On June 16, 2016, a warm Thursday night, I saw the 1958 film Auntie Mame at the Laemmle North Hollywood, where it had been featured as part of a Summer Camp series.1 The film sold out unexpectedly and was moved to a larger theater—221 seats—that sold out as well. The film is frequently programmed in Los Angeles, and Outfest, the Los Angeles LGBTQ film festival, shows Auntie Mame during the holidays each year. Since 2002, these shows have been in concert with the American Cinematheque, which usually sells out the 616-seat Lloyd E. Rigler Theatre. Often, extra holiday screenings are added. All this Auntie Mame is not the work of one rabid fan on a programming board: there is an annual “Homo for the Holidays” showing in Seattle, where the Three-Dollar Bill Cinema not only shows Auntie Mame but also offers an annual “pre-film soirée.” A cursory search finds Auntie Mame programmed in many American cities, usually in the context of a gay series, or for the holidays, or both. In short, Auntie Mame still holds a queer audience, more than sixty years after its premiere. What may be said about this continued appeal besides its association with homosexuality and the holidays? And why is the South essential to this movie otherwise set in New York and environs , and why is the South integral to its use for a queer audience? Novel, play, movie, musical, movie musical: men who had sex with men were essential to all five versions of Auntie Mame, except for the second movie, a notorious flop, and I am tempted to see the relative dearth of queer men among its creators as a proximate cause of its failure. Although the original author, Edward Everett Tanner III, is often called bisexual, he called him- 214 jeff solomon self homosexual, and he eschewed female partners after he left his wife for a man. Jerome Lawrence, half of the team who wrote the play, most of the first screenplay, and the book of the musical, was a self-identified gay man, as was Jerry Herman, who wrote the music and lyrics for the musicals. Morton DaCosta, who directed both the play and the first movie, was gay,2 as was the costumer for this extremely fashion-conscious movie, Orry-Kelly, and the set decorator, George James Hopkins. These queer men created a multivalent text that never directly features male homosexuality but works as a type of gay fairy tale that could both find mass-market success and still appeal to gay viewers to this day. The film is a close adaptation of the original novel, Auntie Mame: An Irreverent Escapade,3 and many viewers had been readers. The book topped the New York Times best-seller list for five weeks in 1955, spent more than two years in the top fifteen, and was one of the ten best-selling novels of both 1955 and 1956. Auntie Mame itself was an adaptation of a collection of short stories about “Patrick Dennis,” the narrator, who writes a “memoir” of his relationship with his aunt. Tanner was so frequently taken as the hero of Auntie Mame that he often took his character’s name as his own.4 To spare my reader, I shall refer to the author as “Tanner” and the character as “Patrick.” In 1955, as now, short story collections were hard to sell, and Tanner’s editor suggested that he link the stories into a novel through the conceit of comparing Auntie Mame to a more traditional “auntie,” supposedly from Reader ’s Digest’s “Admirable People I Have Known.” Each chapter/story now began with a description of the “sweet little New England spinster” who had found a baby on her doorstep and proceeded to raise him,5 with her good works then countered with Mame’s escapades. These adventures were broadly queer— not necessarily in terms of sexuality, but contrary to hegemonic values—while illustrating the principle at hand, such as “charity.” Mame offers a fabulous alternative to traditional parenting, and her greater success repudiates the traditional values that the spinster represents. Throughout his career, Tanner either actively resisted or crumbled under the strain of novelistic structure, and more than once he left the final pages of his novels to others. These difficulties prevented him from successfully adapting..."
