        "text": "Movie watching is my favorite past time, especially old movies. I love to escape to a different world and time more glamorous and exciting than the world I sometimes find myself. I love to explore and watch classic pieces of cinema I have never seen before, that is one of the reasons why I started my classic movie podcast, The Vintage Millennial, but there are some movies I love to watch over and over again, especially during the holiday season. There are so many movies that are especially wonderful to watch between Thanksgiving and New Year’s, that it can be hard to navigate, so I thought it would be helpful to make a list of a few of my favorite films to watch when the snow is falling.\n\nOf any movie I love to go back to during the holiday season, I always return to 1944’s Meet Me in St. Louis. In fact, I watch this every Christmas eve. This movie is the ultimate holiday film, because this is first and foremost about a family sticking together, through the good, the bad, and all Margaret O’Brien’s mischief, which is what the holiday season should be about. Also, this is the first time we see the imagination and creativity of Vincente Minnelli and the talent and beauty of Judy Garland come together, which is magical during anytime of the year, but especially during these cold months.\n\nIf you’re looking for a movie to cure your seasonal depression, look no further than the 1958 comedy, Auntie Mame. To say this movie is charming is an understatement. Auntie Mame herself is like gay Santa. She gives us hope, cheer, and a reason to keep pushing and moving, or as Auntie Mame would say “live, live, live!” She also gives us biting wit, an ever changing decor in her apartment, that has now become Pinterest goals, and costumes from the great Orry- Kelly that are just absolutely delicious! There is no way this movie won’t leave you feeling simply divine!\n\nThe closest thing we have to a Hanukkah movie is 1971’s, Fiddler on the Roof. This is somewhat insane to me, especially since all the Christmas music is mostly written by Jewish writers and composers, so you’d think one of them could’ve cooked up a Hanukkah time musical starring Streisand, but I digress. This movie has nothing to do with Hanukkah, but this movie captures the rich music, struggles, and dare I say traditions, of the Jewish people as beautifully as the stage musical did and still does. Until I get my Hanukkah musical starring Babs, I will continue to watch this every holiday season, while feeling the guilt of my ancestors, cause that’s part of my Jewish traditions.\n\nNow, if you are like me, you are eagerly awaiting the most recent adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s classic novel, Little Women. I know for sure I will be seeing the latest remake on Christmas day, but until then I will be revisiting the other three adaptations of this American classic, because all of the movies are splendid. If you haven’t seen any of the original three, I’d recommend my favorite version of Little Women, which is the 1949 version. This version is my favorite, because it’s just one of those all star MGM movies that just give you the ultimate old movie magic. Also June Allyson’s raspy voice really lends something to Jo March, that I just adore.\n\nThere is no movie more beloved by most humans during the holiday season then 1946’s It’s a Wonderful Life, and I am no exception to this phenomenon. What could arguably be Frank Capra’s crowning achievement, this movie captures almost every human emotion with such sweetness and charisma that you can not help but fall hard and fast for this seasonal classic. Also, the teaming of James Stewart and Donna Reed is absolutely perfect, because you believe them through everything they go through. This captures the highs and lows of the holiday season that ultimately leaves you feeling nothing but the holiday spirit.\n\nEven if you have seen all five of these epic classics, they all deserve to be revisited once in a while because they all capture a time in Hollywood and filmmaking that was new and exciting and still hold up to this day. I hope you have found this list helpful and if you want more old movie content, go give my podcast The Vintage Millennial, a listen!
