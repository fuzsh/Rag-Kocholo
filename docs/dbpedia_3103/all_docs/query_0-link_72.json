        "text": "Auntie Mame: An Irreverent Escapade by Patrick Dennis\n\nFIRST EDITION [1955] NEW YORK VANGUARD PRESS\n\n32nd Printing of this rare first edition.\n\nHardcover with dust jacket in beautiful condition.\n\nDust jacket is in excellent shape w/ minimal wear; some worn edges / corners; otherwise sharp, clean, thick and in tact. Clipped price on front panel.\n\nBook is also in wonderful condition. Attractive with a cute pink text block at top. A few nicked edges to cover. Otherwise like new!\n\nWildly successful when it was first published in 1955, Patrick Dennis' Auntie Mame was made into a Broadway play as well as a Hollywood musical, and a fabulous movie starring Rosalind Russell. Since then, Mame has taken her rightful place in the pantheon of Great and Important People as the world's most beloved, madcap, devastatingly sophisticated, and glamorous aunt. She is impossible to resist, and this hilarious story of an orphaned ten-year-old boy sent to live with his aunt is as delicious a read in the twenty-first century as it was in the 1950s."
