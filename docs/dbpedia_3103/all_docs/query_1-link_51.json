        "text": "This post is written in conjunction with the LAMB Acting School 101 hosted by the Large Association of Movie Blogs.\n\nRosalind Russell has been one of my favorite actresses ever since I first saw her in THE WOMEN and HIS GIRL FRIDAY. I love the verve, energy, wit, and confidence that she expresses on screen in all her films. She was a talented actress who could perform well in all genres, though comedy was hr undeniable forte. Below is a list of the Rosalind Russell films I would recommend for any classic movie fan. What are your favorite Rosalind Russell movies and how would your list compare to mine?\n\n(In reverse chronological order)\n\n1.) MRS. POLLIFAX, SPY (Leslie H. Martinson, 1971)\n\nA widow woman with grown children who no longer need her, Mrs. Pollifax volunteers her services as a secret agent. However, hr first mission for the CIA doesn’t go exactly to plan. She’s picked up by the enemy and shipped off to an Albanian prison with another American spy (the very handsome Darren McGavin). With her usual wit and charm, Russell concocts fantastic escape plans. I really enjoyed Rosalind Russell’s last film. It is simple, yet endearingly amusing.\n\n2.) THE TROUBLE WITH ANGELS (Ida Lupino, 1966)\n\nHayley Mills gives Mother Superior (Russell) a hell of a time at St. Francis Academy for Girls. Mary Wickes also makes an appearance as a nun, a role she would reprise in the SISTER ACT (1992/3) movies. I liked this movie, but Hayley Mills comes over as a bit of a brat, frankly.\n\n3.) GYPSY (Mervyn LeRoy, 1962)\n\nNatalie Wood and Rosalind Russell as Mama Rose\n\nOne of Russell’s most famous performances as Mama Rose, stage mother of famed burlesque dancer Gypsy Rose Lee. Love the songs from this movie musical – it’s almost too bad Russell wasn’t allowed to sing her own part. Still, her comic genius makes this a great film. The real Gypsy Rose Lee appeared with Russell in THE TROUBLE WITH ANGELS (1966).\n\n4.) AUNTIE MAME (Morton DaCosta, 1958)\n\nMy absolute favorite Russell screen performance from Patrick Dennis’s novel about his eccentric Bohemian aunt. Russell was nominated for an Oscar for her role as Auntie Mame, a nomination I think she should have won!\n\n“Life’s a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death!”\n\n“That’s a B. It’s the first letter of a seven-letter word that means your father.”\n\n“She’s not English, darling. She’s from Pittsburgh.” “She sounded English.” “Well, when you’re from Pittsburgh, you have to do something.”\n\n“Please dear, your Auntie Mame’s hung.”\n\n5.) PICNIC (Joshua Logan, 1955)\n\nNot my favorite movie – pretty traditional female roles. Russell plays the desperate almost old maid spinster school teacher role. But apparently it’s a very popular film.\n\n6.) WONDERFUL TOWN (Mel Ferber and Herbert Ross, 1958) and MY SISTER EILEEN (Alexander Hall, 1942)\n\n“Some interesting people live on Christopher Street!”\n\nRussell won a Tony for her Broadway performance as Ruth Sherwood, a role she premiered in the original movie MY SISTER EILEEN (1942), a story about two sisters who move to Greenwich Village to try and make it in the Big Apple.\n\n7.) HIS GIRL FRIDAY (Howard Hawks, 1940)\n\nRosalind Russell gives Cary Grant (Walter) a run for his money as hard-core journalist Hildy Johnson. Although Walter and Hildy have been divorced for some time, he will go to any lengths to keep her from marrying her fiance, dull insurance agent Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy). This movie will have you rolling on the floor with laughter. Russell’s portrayal of Hildy is intelligently executed. Although she is manipulated by Walter, and ultimately remarries him, the whole point of the story is that Hildy cannot live without her work. If she marries Bruce she will inevitably become a “little woman” stuck in the kitchen slaving for her man. But if she marries Walter, she can return to the job she is loves and is really good at – journalist. I cannot recommend this film enough!\n\n8.) THE WOMEN (George Cukor, 1939)\n\nRussell takes her place as Sylvia Fowler in this star-studded film directed by George Cukor. Although the film is cast entirely with women (including the animals and musicians), it’s all about men and marriage and divorce and men. The women are catty, jealous, and artificial, and yet this is possibly the best non-Katharine Hepburn film I’ve EVER seen (except for MARY POPPINS)! The dialogue is fast and brilliantly witty. The characters are drawn with a lot of depth. The plot has a great deal of intelligent complexity. Russell’s performance in particular is worth noting – she is possibly the worst character in the film, and yet she plays it with an amazing dexterity. Another film I cannot recommend enough.\n\nNot only was Rosalind Russell an amazing actress, she was also very involved in charitable causes in Hollywood, throwing herself into humanitarian efforts in and around Hollywood. Below is a video of her receiving the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award from Frank Sinatra at the 1973 Academy Awards.\n\nI would like to leave you with this clip of Roz on the wonderful 1950s/60s TV show “What’s My Line.” She’s one of the funniest mystery guests I’ve seen on the show, so I hope you enjoy it and her!\n\nhttp://feministguidetohollywood.blogspot.com/\n\nFeminist personas of classic Hollywood come in many shapes and sizes. Some, like the great Katharine Hepburn, found profound new ways to represent strong women on the big screen. Others more subtly broke new ground in their private lives. There is no set way to define a feminist icon, but there are some ways you can measure how progressive the stars’ personas could be. For one, all of these women are professionals who get paid (a lot) for their talent and hard work. Secondly, stars who were aware of their desire to present a progressive view of women often chose films which would showcase these strengths.\n\nProgressive film texts help to support a feminist star persona. Feminist icons often pursue roles in which the female protagonist both actively and passively rejects gender stereotypes. These stereotypes include, but are not limited to:\n\n1.) Women as passive objects of male desire\n\n2.) as passive subjects of the voyeuristic male gaze\n\n3.) bound in traditional gender roles as wife and mother\n\n4.) portrayed as essentially feminine – pure, humble, patient, self-immolating, as healers and as the moral and ethical conscience of the male characters\n\n5.) portrayed as essentially female – catty, jealous of other women, talkative, hysterical, over-wrought, bitter\n\n6.) with few lines, making few personal decisions or simply indecisive\n\nThe cast of George Cukor’s THE WOMEN (1939)\n\nProgressive films can deconstruct these stereotypes in a number of ways:\n\n1.) women with an expressed sexual desire for men (surprisingly unusually\n\n2.) as decisive go-getters who know what they want and how to get it\n\n3.) women professionals, often though not necessarily in non-traditional occupations (not secretary, nurse, or teacher)\n\n4.) portrayed with somewhat masculine traits – courage, self-sufficiency, confidence, intelligence, intellectual, athletic, strong, independent\n\n5.) has a major speaking part with many lines\n\n6.) the female character progresses the story by making intelligent personal decisions that aren’t inspired by, nor motivated by, a male character\n\n7.) passes the Bechdel Test\n\nI have constructed this list of feminist star personas of old Hollywood based on the criteria listed above. Although some of these names might surprise you in a list of feminists, take a closer look at the many ways a progressive feminist thought can be manifested. In many cases, the star persona presented a stronger feminist ideal than the film texts of the time could support, so strong women were cast as weak feminine characters. Who would you have on your list of feminist icons? How would it compare to my list?\n\nBitchy or assertive? I say assertive, strong, intelligent, independent, and very talented.\n\nAuntie Mame did things her way and Hildy Johnson was one heck of a newspaperwoman.\n\nCould out-sass, out-class, and out-dance Fred Astaire any day!\n\nChorus-girl, then comedienne, then businesswoman. Seriously, was there anything this woman couldn’t do?\n\nThis wisecracking broad from Brooklyn didn’t take any bologna from nobody, not no how.\n\nThis songstress may have a had a tough life, but they don’t come any stronger than Judy.\n\nIf Mary Poppins isn’t a progressive feminist, I don’t know who is!\n\nShe never let William Powell boss her around, no sir!\n\n“Marriage is a great institution. I’m not ready for an institution.”\n\n“I’m no model lady. A model is just an imitation of the real thing.”\n\n“I wrote the story myself. It’s all about a girl who lost her reputation but never missed it.”\n\n“I freely chose the kind of life I led because I was convinced a woman has as much right as a man to live the way she does if she does no actual harm to society.”\n\nPut her in a catsuit and stand back! As Emma Peel, she made Steed look like a ninny in THE AVENGERS. Mrs. Peel was also a chemistry genius.\n\nAfter a successful career as a child star, she worked to save the world as an ambassador to Ghana and Czechoslovakia\n\nThis character actress may not have been a glamour-puss, but did you know that this comedienne holds a degree in political science from Washington University in St. Louis?\n\nThis post was written for the annual Classic Hollywood Writing Contest hosted by Film-Classics."
