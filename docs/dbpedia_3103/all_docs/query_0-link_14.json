        "text": "The 1958 movie Auntie Mame is considered a classic, and it’s a kick to watch for the constantly changing, over-the-top sets and costumes.\n\nIt was based on a popular stage play starring the fabulous Rosalind Russell, who reprised her role in the film.\n\nIt opens in 1928 when her young nephew Patrick arrives at her doorstep as an orphan, in need of a guardian. His Auntie Mame isn’t the model parental figure, however (*understatement*).\n\nLet’s take a look back at the sets they created for the movie!\n\nThe Sets from “Auntie Mame”\n\nWhen Patrick and his caretaker Norah arrive at Mame’s apartment for the first time,\n\nthey’re a little startled by the “unique” hallway decor:\n\nNorah remarks that the hallways resembles “The ladies’ room at the Oriental theater.”\n\nWhen they ring the doorbell, steam shoots out of the dragon’s nostrils and the eyes move:\n\nInside the apartment, a party (which in 1958 may have seemed wildly hedonistic,\n\nbut now looks kind of stuffy with mostly older people standing around in suits) is in full swing:\n\nMame makes her appearance at the top of the stairs:\n\nWhen they shot the first scene with her running down the curved staircase,\n\nRosalind Russell tripped and broke her ankle. Filming was delayed until she recovered.\n\nAuntie Mame has lots of memorable lines, including the famous, “Life is a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death!”\n\nIt was voted as the #93 movie quote by the American Film Institute.\n\nIt was adapted from the stage play, in which she said, “most poor sons-of-bitches are starving to death,” but the language was deemed too racy for film.\n\nThe play and movie were based on a popular novel by Patrick Dennis,\n\nwho was reportedly inspired by his own real-life Aunt Marian.\n\nMame takes Patrick to the dining room where a buffet has been set up behind an ornate set of metal doors:\n\nThe bedroom she gives Patrick to sleep in is called “The Marie Antoinette Room:”\n\nMame’s Bedroom:\n\nNorah complains that in the 14 days they’ve been living there,\n\nMame has thrown 13 parties (one was canceled “because the bootlegger didn’t show”).\n\nMame’s apartment is redecorated at least 6 times during the course of the film.\n\nEven though the majority of the action takes place in the same set, it is constantly changing.\n\nAfter the first redesign, the walls are now gray.\n\nThe furniture, pillows, and lamps are in shades of blue and purple.\n\nThe staircase is even different with a new metal railing.\n\nIt’s fun to try to spot all the little changes from scene to scene.\n\nI got a kick out of how they painted Mame’s radio and cart to match the rest of the room:\n\nMakeover #3:\n\nThe new entry is flanked by fake palm trees:\n\nThe mantel has gone from being sleek and modern to ornate and traditional:\n\nRussell was nominated for a Tony Award in 1957 for her role in the stage play and was nominated for an Oscar for the movie version.\n\nShe also had a scene-stealing turn as Sylvia in The Women, but my favorite Russell movie has to be the hilarious screwball comedy His Girl Friday with Cary Grant.\n\nApartment Makeover #4:\n\nThis version of the apartment is very sedate and traditional with shades of brown and tan:\n\nEven the books in the bookshelves have been given brown and off-white covers to match the rooms:\n\nAnd Mame, as always, is dressed to match her decor.\n\nEven her hair changes colors with each apartment (it was red during this period).\n\nRemember those ornate doors leading into the dining room at the beginning of the movie?\n\nThey’ve been replaced by traditional French doors:\n\nWhen Patrick tells Mame he’s going to bring his future in-laws to her house, she goes all out on the apartment, redecorating it once again.\n\nThis time, she’s got an ulterior motive behind it, however.\n\nShe doesn’t like his fiancee or her snooty parents, so she decides to shake them up a bit, starting with the odd fishbowl light fixture in the hall:\n\nPatrick’s fiancee Gloria was played by Joanna Barnes,\n\nwho you may recognize from The Parent Trap.\n\nThe movie was remade in 1974 as a musical starring Lucille Ball.\n\nThe beautiful woodwork has been taken down and the stairs now have brown carpet on them:\n\nMame feeds the fish that swim under the new sculpture:\n\nImagine her guests’ surprise when Mame shows them\n\nthat the benches they’re sitting on are adjustable!\n\nWhen the movie ends, her apartment has been transformed again — this time with a Far East vibe:\n\nThis set was used countless times for different movies. It’s fun to play “spot that staircase.”\n\nA reader named Richard actually compiled a video with clips of the set from various films that you can see here.\n\nHe says that during World War II materials were so scarce that they were unable to build new sets for every movie, so they got creative with “recycling” them!"
