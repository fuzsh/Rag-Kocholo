        "text": "Just Marvelous!\n\nChristopher Lane gives a captivating narration of this timeless novel drawing forth laughter and sometimes tears. I truly didn't want the story to end.\n\nStill holds up!\n\nGrew up with the film and thought I'd give this a try. I was not disappointed. I'll definitely listen to the sequel.\n\nA CLASSIC!\n\nThe story of Auntie Mame has long been a classic for good reason. Of course it will make you laugh…out loud! Likewise will it make you cry, too. It does me, every time I read it.\n\nShe believed life was a banquet. And it was about living to the fullest and not putting up with pretentious snobbery. You’re going to have so much fun with Auntie Mame! Dive right in!\n\nA Family Favorite\n\nI saw the movie first. Ms. Russell did it best. I read a different version in college. I really enjoyed hearing about the other things they did that is in this audiobook. I recommend listening to it. you'll love it.\n\nEnjoyable\n\nAuntie Mame was an enjoyable light hearted read. I can see how it’s still a favorite after all these years. Plus we all need a little Auntie Mame in our lives.\n\nLaugh out loud book!!\n\nI’ve seen the movie many times but the book was soooo much better. I’m sure people watching me laugh like crazy while driving listening to this book, we’re shaking their head. I truly LOVED this audible ❣️\n\nExcellent Book\n\nBest book I have read in years .. Very well written ann narrated ...will check his other books .\n\nExcellent narration saved story in places\n\nMaybe I really am too much of a curmudgeon? While parts of the story were, indeed, very funny, I detested some sections as well (Alice Gooch for one). Then again, I really liked the nasty little boy in Georgia a lot. Patrick wasn't very likeable to me, nor particularly bright, but a rich kid with limited common sense. Right off the bat, I had trouble swallowing disbelief that Mame didn't attend Patrick's dad's funeral in Chicago, which would've minimized the boy's unexpected appearance in New York later I suppose. Another point where I had trouble concerned Patrick's trip to visit Mame in Maine. I inferred that she knew the truth about the sisters, yet she let Patrick have his pursuit? Again, reality set aside for the sake of the (comedic) plot. I recommend the audiobook, which really helped carry the parts with which I had trouble; narrator did a great job handling all the voices, especially Mame!"
