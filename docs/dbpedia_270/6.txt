History

The call letters for WFDM were assigned to Fairleigh Dickenson University Madison, New Jersey Campus carrier current radio station in 1966(?). The call letters are still used by that university for their Madison Campus. In 1975 the station went "airwave" without license from the FCC thanks to the work of a very industrious student engineer. The station served the Madison, Morristown,Florham Park, Convent Station area from 1975 until it was pulled off air in 1976 by the FCC.

The station was first assigned the call sign WNUE, which was changed to WFAV on September 19, 1994. On January 31, 2002 the call sign was changed to WJGC which was then changed to WBAU on July 21, 2004.

On June 30, 2006, the call sign was changed to WTKE and the station started simulcasting the sports radio format on WTKE-FM as "100.3 The Ticket". The call sign was changed to WZFN and the station was branded "1400 Z Fan", retaining the sports talk format. November 22, 2011 the call sign changed to WFDM. There is a WFDM-FM in Franklin, IN but there is no owner relation.
