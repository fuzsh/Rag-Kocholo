Hmmm. I'm not convinced. No, amateur radio didn*t gradu- ally die off. It was killed with one blow back in 1963. Before that it had been growing at 11% per year for 17 years, right on up through the evolution of televi- sion. TV never even stowed it down. My first exposure to amateur radio must have made a strong impression, because after 50 years I still remember it. Yep, sonny, I was a shaver of ten and while visiting the best friends of my grandparents In Bethlehem, New Hampshire, I met Harry Stevenson WiCUN. His mother, along with Johnny Macauley, ran the Valley Vrew Inn. That was back in the heyday of hotels in Bethlehem. . .30 hotels and 100 rooming houses, the bill- board at the entry to town said, Harry was sitting there laconi- cally talking on a 75m rig. . .a breadboard construction with a big copper tube final coil He didn't pay a lot of attention to the visiting kid. It didn't occur to me, at ten, that I might ever be able to understand the wizardry of Ihat mass of wires and tubes. HOME-BREW CONTEST WINNERS • 1st place, $250 prize: '*Smart Squelch for SingleSideband Receivers\" by Frank Reid W9MKV and David Link W9YAN, both of Bloomington IN. • 2nd place, $100 priie: '*SjX'Meler Double-Sideband QRP Transmitter\" by Larry Jack KL7GLK of Annapolis MD. • Honofable mention, S50 each: \"MB-1 Function Circuit\" by Mike Strange WA2BHe. Pine Hill NJ. \"Splattomeler\" by Penn Glower W1BG. Andover MA, and ^Weather Converter for Your Two-Meter Rig\" by Paul Danzer N1II, Norwalk CT. We're sure you have heard it said that \"hams are not build- ing anymore; they're |ust appliance operators.\" Well, 73's Home-brew Contest proves that rumor to be baloney. We were literally buried with entries. The winning projects show that hams are not only building, but that they are still innovatmg, too. Our editorial staff burned the midnight oil in early April, choosing five finalists from more than 100 entries. The win- ners were then picked by three of 75's veteran home-brewers: AG9V, K1XR. and W1Xa The Home brew Contest winners will be published in future issues of 73. In the meantime, keep your soldering iron hot — 73 is having another contest. This time there will be a $50 limit for the projecfs parts. Like a time bomb ticking away, that experience fay hid- den, waiting for the spark of pu- berty to set it off. By 14, 1 was a!* ready familiar with the excite- ment of the police calls at the top of the broadcast radio dial. Then all it took was an exposure to a fantastic radio my grand- father in Littleton. Hew Hamp- shire had. . .with a shortwave band on It! Wow! There were all those foreign broadcast sta- tions. . .and a myriad of hams. I was a roly-poly kid. but the fami- ly still had trouble tearing me away from the twenty-meter ham band to eat. It was at just this juncture that some fiend dumped a box of radio parts in my lap one Sun- day at church. Most of the parts were brand new and in their orig- inal cartons, so 1 couldn't just throw them away. Oh, f tried to sell them to the local radio re* pairman (now gone the way of the ice man}, but he sneered at the parts as antiques. Popular Mechanics had a radio con- struction project each month, many of them using parts |ust like those in my collection, so 1 put together a radio in an old ci* gar box. . .and unfortunately It worked. I was hooked. %l HOME-BREW II CONTEST SS Between now and October 1, well be looking for articles de- scribing the best home-brew projects in the land for under $50.

This article describes a microprocessor-con- trolled vfo which may be used as a remote vfo for ex- isting stations or incorpo- rated into new radio-system designs. The vfo features ten battery-backed'Up memories, keypad entry of frequency, up/down scan- ning, a real-time clock, plus a liquid crystal display- As a remote, the vfo tunes from 5 to 6 MHz in 100-Hz increments and is di- rectly compatible with ra- dios which use a 5-to-5.5- MHz internal vfo (e.g., FT'107. FT-707. etc.}. If us^ ing one of these radios, only small modifications within the radio are required to al- low the remote vfo to change bands at the touch of a finger! Microprocessor Selection The vfo is designed a- round Motorola's MC6805T2 microprocessor. Within this multi-function chip (now called a microcomputing unit — MCU — because of all the integrated functions on board), I/O plays a very important part. This is the portion of the MCU which does the actual com muni* eating with switches, LEDs, bells, and whistles. The MC6805T2 MCU used in this project (we will refer to it as the ''JD has a small amount of RAM, ROM (2.5 K bytes), a timer, parallel I/O lines, and one other fea- ture that makes it idea! in the radio environment— a built-in frequency synthe- sizer A block diagram of the synthesizer is shown in Fig.l(a); Fig.l(b) is a block diagram of the entire vfo. The vco signal which is fed back into the T2 may have an amplitude as low as one-half volt and be as fast as 16 MHz. With exter- nal pre sea I ing, the vco fre- quency may be consider- ably higher. However, any external prescaling will multiply the step size by the prescaling factor- In addition to its on-chip synthesizer, the T2 contains enough ROM to hold all the software needed for the vfo control program. In fact, the T2 with the vfo program in ROM is available from any Motorola distributor. An alternative to the T2 is the MC68705P3 MPU. The P3 is very similar to the T2 except that it requires an external synthesizer and it contains on-board EPROM instead of ROM. The EPROM on the P3 is user- programmable, so you should use the P3 if you need a control program other than the one avail- 12 73 Magazine • June, 1982 able in ROM on the T2. See the box for further informa- tion on programming and use of the P3. The circuit-board layouts given in this article can be jumpered for use with ei- ther MPU. The figures and text explain where differ- ences occur For those who prefer not to etch their own boardSp a source for boards as well as components is given in the small box. Using the Vfo Upon power-up, the MCU reads the last-entered frequency from the RAM on board a battery-backed- up MC146818 clock chip. enters it into the synthesiz- er, and displays it. If power- ing up from a \"dead'' sys- tem (no battery backup), garbage will be both dis- played and entered into the PLL system After the powerup se- quence is completed, num- bers for a different frequen- cy may be entered via the keyboard When the dis- play shows the frequency desired, depress ''enter\" and the PLL system wit! be set up. By entering the fre- quency in this manner, it is also stored in RAM so that if a power failure should oc- cur, the correct frequency will be read from the bat- tery-backed-up system and the PLL restored- If the displayed frequen- cy is to be stored into mem- ory for later recall, press \"memory\" followed by a digit, 0-9. To retrieve a pre- viously stored frequency, press \"recall\" followed by the desired digit All of these memories have bat- tery backup. If you want to move up in frequency, press and hold the ''up\" button. If you want to go up fast, press and hold the \"fast\" button at the same time. The fre- quency will go up until it reaches XX,999.9, at which time it will roll over to XX 000.0. To make the sys- tem go down in frequency, the same procedure may be SYSTEW CLOCK r 1 I OSCltL*TOi* a DIVIDE, ar 4 I&-HT fltFr- PHASE/ FREOU Elicit COHPAAATOn LOW f»A$S FILTER \"^ Jl- FREauENCV OUT ^rt^ i* • \"^ VOLTACC cmTROLLte OSClLLtTOR: PART or MceaosTE tJlVlUt-BY-N ^[ :irzi::_J I OPttQHAL L I Fig. l(al Block diagram of synthesizer on MC6805T2 MCU chip. followed using the \"down\" key. To set the time, press ''recall\" followed by ^'memory/' At this time, the display wilt show EEEEEE, signifying that the time may now be entered. Enter the time in 2'4-hour format and when satisfied with the dis- play, press \"enter.\" At this time, the data will be placed into the clock chip's registers and time-keeping will commence. When ''en- ter\" is depressed, the fre- quency that was on the dis- play before setting the clock will be restored to the display. The actual PLL sys- tems are not disturbed by entering into either this mode or the time-display mode. To display the time with an update every second, press \"recall\" followed by \"enter/' You may exit this mode by pressing any key, which will return the dis- play to the previous fre- quency. As you can see, the com- bination of the MC6805T2 MCU and the MCI 4681 8 clock chip provides the ra- dio designer with capabili- ties that far surpass the pre- viously acceptable meth- ods of frequency control. The 6818 may be omitted, but the clock feature, stored frequencies, and the battery backup of them will also be deleted.

By using four of the I/O lines from the MCU for a voltage-sum- ming network, 100-Hz step- ping increments may be re- alized. The output of the sunnming network is used as an ''offset'' voltage to shift the frequency of the vfo. Because the frequency will be locked (basically to it- self), changing the main vco frequency would achieve nothing. There are, how- ever, two methods of PARTS AVAILABILITY The varactor diodes {02 and D3) and most of the integrated circuits used m this project are Motorola devices and are available from Motorola distributors. In many parts of the country » Hamrlton-Avnet Electronics is a source for these parts. Excludrng the LCD unit, a set of ICs for this project should cost between $45 and S70, depending on which micro- processor you select for your version. The f^Dl08 double-balanced mixer is available for $12 post- pafd from ANZAC, 180 Cambridge St., Burlington MA 01803. A good selection of coils and forms can be found at RADIOKIT, Box 411 S, Greenville NH 03048. Parts, as well as circuit boards, are also available from Con- version Dynamics, 2218 Old Middlefieid Way, Suite N, Moun- tain View CA 94043.

The first method was tried initially, but due to the low frequency of the crys- tal, I could not pull the os- ctilator far enough off fre- quency to provide the 100-Hz shift and still have provisions for RIT. So the second method, of an auxil- iary vxov was tried. The main vco tunes from 1236 to 13.36 MHz and is then mixed with 18 36 MHz from the vxo to provide the nec- essary 5-to-6-MHz signal This method of shifting through 100-Hz steps may seem a bit crude, but sever- 14 73Magazine • June, 1982 Fig. 2. Rf circuitry of vfo. al commercial transceivers use this method. In fact. I corn's IC-730 uses this method to generate 10-Hz steps! Fig. 4, a spectrum an- alyzer photo, shows the ac- tual vfo output. The 18 360-MHz vxo crystal (Y4) was chosen be- cause t had one; it is a 146.8B-MHz transmit crys- tal for an HT-144 Either of two crystals may be used in the oscillator. An 18360- MHz or an 18.860-MHz crystal may be selected by a jumper and a pultup/pull- down resistor on pin 27 of I CI (see Fig 3). The vco must be adjusted for the crystal you choose. If a different frequency range is to be covered by the vfo, the frequency of the vxo crystal must be changed, and appropriate modifications in the filters should be made From this, it may be seen that almost any frequency may be gen- erated from the vfo by sim- ply changing the vxo crys- tal. The MCU and Clock Circuit A version of the MC6805T2 is available from Motorola which already contains in ROM the program neces- sary to function as a vfo, This part is called an MC6805T2L2. The L2 signi- fies a specific program within a ceramic part in this case, the vfo software The MCU is used to gather data from the keyboard and execute any function which is \"called up.\" The tines used for I/O are represented by PA0-PA7. PB0'PB7, and PCO-PCl. Port A is used for both the keyboard and rrv lerf ace to the MCI 4681 8 clock chip. In this applica- tion, the clock chip is bat- tery-backed-up, and when powered down draws only 300-400 microamperes from a four'and-one-half- voft source. The B port is used to con- trol the four bits of the voit- age-summing network plus the read/write and control lines of the clock. The C port is used to control the clock and data lines of the liquid crystal display (LCD). Only two crystals are re- quired in this part of the vfo — a 4 096 MHz for the MCU, and a 4.194 MHz for the clock chip. These fre- quencies are divided down by their respective hosts for internal timing. All of the peripherals with the exception of the 6818 are serial devices. This means that the digital data which goes to each part re- quires only two lines, a data line and a clock line In the MCU environment, I/O lines are at a premium; that is why data lines are com* mon to all parts and only the clock or enable lines are separated from the rest. The Display The display portion of the system uses the MCI 45000 multiplexed LCD driver and an 8-digit LCD, although only six digits are used. The MCI 45000 requires a total of four lines — power, ground, clock, and data. This means that the display may be located away from the main PC board. This makes for a lot easier con- struction of the total proj- ect! Since this is digital data on two of the lines, use no more than about a foot of cable. Current consump- tion is quite low with this CMOS device— about 75 microamperes. As data is shifted into the 145000, every 8 bits will shift over one character from left to right.

Using the MC745155 CMOS synthesizer Using the P3 Although designed tor me MC6805T2. the vfo software was given the capability of using the MC68705P3 as a host MCU. This MCU is identical to the T2 with the following exceptions: • The P3 does not contain a PLL • The P3 is an EPROM type part which programs itself. In the early stages of the design, a T2 was not available and a '*simulation\" was made by usmg a P3 and an MC145155 CMOS synihesizer. If changes to the program are desired, yoti may use a P3 plus an MC145155 CMOS synthesizer to sirrru- late the T2, as shown in Figs. A and B. This allows you to use the same basic core of the program and add enhancements that might be useful. The actuat software listing for the system is available from me on receipt of a targe SASE plus $3.00 to cover copying Fig. &. 6805 T2 vs. P3 diff&rences^ costs. It may be entered into an MCM2716 2K by 8 EPROM for programming ot the MC68705P3, Fig. C Is a schematic for the programmer. The MC68705P3 MCU has the capability of programming it* self. By adding only one additional part (MC14040B), the P3 can read data from a 2K by 8 EPROM and program itself from it. Two LEDs are used, which signify that the device has been 1 -programmed, and 2-vefified. Because the hardware required to program the P3 ts so small, even the casual amateur/hobbyist may build a pro- grammer to take advantage of the MCU's capabitittes. Either the T2 or the P3 with the MCI 451 55 can be used with the circuit board presented in this article. If the T2 is used^ the MG145155 is not needed and two jumper connections should be made at the MC1 45155 socket- See Fig. A.

Vfo output displayed on spectrum analyzer. te TSMagazinG • Junej982 also contains 50 bytes of CMOS RAM. This makes the device an excellent choice, since data in the RAM may easily be saved in a power-down condition. The 6818 has a clock gen- eration circuit on chip which requires only a crys- tal, resistor, and two small capacitors to generate not only the time clock source, but also a clock signal for the rest of the system if de- sired. If the crystal mode is not chosen, the 6818 may be driven with an external frequency of 4*195 MHz, r048 MHz, or 32.768 kHz An interna] register tells the 6818 which frequency it is on. I have found that the 6818 draws less power when operating at the low- est frequency— 32.768 kHz.

The empty socket at left is for the plug-in ca- ble to the keypad At upper right is a metal can containing the double-balanced mixer. clock chip is not designed to have any I/O pins, there is one way in which a single output bit may be \"con- structed,\" The SQW pin is a software-programmable clock output pin whose'f re- quency is a derivative of the 681 8's clock. The inter- nal register which controls the frequency of the SQW pin can not only change the frequency of the pin, but it may also turn it off. By set- ting the frequency of the SQW to some relatively high frequency (it is not really that important) and providing some external fil- tering, when the clock is on, the output of the filter represents a \"one\" condi- tion, and when off, rep re* sents a \"zero\" condition! This provides an extra I/O pin. Power Supply To supply the MCI 4681 8 with voltage both when the main system is off and on, there need to be a few smarts involved. See Fig. 7, The trick required is to use D6 to initially raise the 5 volts from IC7 one diode drop higher (.7 VJ, then drop the supply voltage (Vcc) to both MCU and 6818 by sefh arate diodes {D4 and D7}. This ensures that both parts 20 73Magazine • June. 1982 are operating at basically the same voltage. For battery-backup operation, D5 is inserted from the plus lead of the battery to pin 20 of the 6818. This isolates the batteries from the rest of the system and doesn't allow any current to flow back into them when the main Vcc is on. If you are using nicads, a resistor of appropriate value could replace the diode to allow charging during on time. The value of this resistor is of little consequence to the 6818 when the main power is off because the current consumption of the 6818 is so low. In addition to the voltage differential, there is another consideration regarding the chip enable (CE) line of the 6818. When the system is powered down (main pow- er), the CE line of the 6818 should be brought high to ensure that the part is dese- lected. This is easily accom- plished by using a transistor (Q5 in Fig. 3) in the classical inverter style. The base is tied to the MCU Vcc (through an appropriate re- sistor), and the collector re- sistor is tied to the 6818 Vcc. When the system is on, the collector is low, en- abling the 6818, but it goes 0 QQ 13 14 6tT£S QD 14 SO BYTES ys£R HAM oe; «3 sr 0 SECO*iDS 01 OZ 03 Oa OS 06 07 OS 09 , Oi.

The Keyboard Because I/O lines are so valuable, each one com- monly is given more than one function. Of course, every effort has been made to keep the number of lines required to a minimum (by using serial-type devices), but there are instances where large numbers of I/O pins are required. For in- stance, the 4X4 keypad re- quires eight lines just to de- code the proper key. Yes, a two-to-four decoder could have been placed external to the MCU which would free up two additional tines, but it also would have re- quired an external device to perform that function.

Most of these components mount on the main circuit board. band transceiver, some method must be provided to tell the external PLL sys- tem which MHz segment it IS on. This function is imple- mented as follows. Whenever the frequency is sent to the on-board syn- thesizer, the two most sig- nificant digits (MHz) are sent serially to the data pin (PCO), If operating on 5 MHz, the sequence of events is: (1) set up the 5-6-MHz synthesizer, (2) pulse the SQW pin of the 6818 (resets the external counter), (3) set the clock enable pin (allows clock tine to increment counter), (4) send out five pulses (for 5 MHz), (5) clear the clock enable pin, and [b) continue with program. The circuit for a simple decoding scheme using the MC1451fi dual BCD count- er is shown m Fig 8. One use for the outputs from the counter is to provide auto- matic bandswitching. References were made earlier to bandswitching on an FT407 or FT-707. Fig 9[a) shows how it may be ac- complished By taking the outputs of the binary de- coder of Fig, 8 and running them into a 74LS470 Pro- grammable Read Only Memory (PROM), certain combinations of frequen- cies may be turned into levels which may drive cir- cuitry to change bands. The PROM must be pro- grammed as per Fig. 9(b). Unlike older transceivers, the FT-107 and 707 do not use a bandswitch which runs the entire depth of the rig. The actual switch is on- ly a double-pole type which switches relays within the radio By placing this switch in an unused position and adding appropriate drivers, the remote vfo can switch bands, too! I originally used this vfo with a simple home-brew transceiver that operates on both 80 and 20 meters, with no external hetero- dyne oscillator This single- conversion radio provides an excellent \"simple\" radio, with the T2 controlling everything, including the bandswitching of the filters. Fig, TO shows a block dia- gram of this radio. The vfo provides the ac- tual frequency selection, with the display presenting the operator with the car- rier frequency. If you are upgrading a standard radio such as Heath or Collins where there was an analog method of readout there will be no problem in con- version. But it you are already using a digital readout that displays not the carrier frequency, but the actual \"talk frequen- cy/' then an additional modification must be made to the system.

Construction and Alignment I recommend that the vco be built first, This is the most difficult portion of the vfo, and the rest comes easily once this is com- pleted. After the vco is built, check its frequency range by turning the slug in coil L2. It should encom- pass the 1 2 J6-1 3.36-MHz range required. After this has been built, build the rest of the rf section (IB-MHz VXD and filters). Only after you have 5 to 6 MHz coming out of the fil- ter stage should you pro- ceed with the digital sec- tion.

First, check the jumpers and power sup- plies. Next check to see that the oscillators are functioning properly. If the unit seems to operate properly but the vco will not track, be sure that the loop filter is prop- erly built and that there is a feedback frequency back to the PLL.

P/easanf HitI Bhd Des ^foJ^es tA S0S17 Surviving the Unthinkable part II: some practical ideas In part I, I talked about the idea of emergency communications after a nuclear attack and the benefits the Amateur Ser vice might provide. In this part, we'll talk about specific steps that each of us can take First, though, let's set the stage: Imagine this situation for a moment: The most incom- petent of operators walked into your shack and for a fraction of an instant con- nected your receiver's an- tenna terminals to a high- voltage distribution line. The result was a 40-kV, 1,000-Amp shock to the in- put of your receiver. There wouldn't be very much left of your sensitive input cir- cuits, to say the least This sounds like an im- possible situation. I only wish that it were truly im- possible. But in today's cri- ANT|I4«^4 FESO CABLE 403 LVN WASHER PIER GROUND EARTH AMDREWS GROyfiDiH^ KIT Fig. 1. Recommended ground connections at tower base. 30 73 Magazine • June, 1982 sis-oriented world, the situ- ation is indeed within the realm of possibility. The 40-kV shock is what civil-de- fense experts say would be the result of a nuclear blast in the vicinity of most any piece of unshielded wire, in- cluding telephone wires, power lines, antennas, and feedlines. The phenomenon is commonly referred to as a nuclear electromagnetic pulse (EMP or NEMP). This kind of pulse is so ex- treme in amplitude that many normal lightning pro- tectors are useless. For ex- ample, a typical lightning pulse has about a lOOmi- crosecond duration, with a 5-microsecond rise to its peak. A high-altitude EMP pulse can be expected to have a 1 -microsecond dura- tion and a 10-nanosecond rise to its peak, That's not enough time for many com- mon lightning arrestors to work. In the following pages we'll talk about some of the EMP protective measures which should be taken on your equipment Without protection, sensitive semi- conductors would be most likely to fail and put you out of business when your services may be needed most. But, first, why should we even be concerned about protection? After all, any nuclear exchange seems to be so outrageously incom- petent on the part of world leaders that it seems that it never could happen. Unfor- tunately, however, we've seen in the last few years that many improbable things such as revolutions, hostage taking, etc., have actually occurred. Even though we all hope and pray that a nuclear ex- change does not occur, let us not underestimate the devastating and paralyzing effects of such an ex- change. Simply imagine, for a moment, a world with hundreds of mitlions of US and Russian citizens killed and tens of mi! lions more severely and untreatably burned, near death, and starving. Major cities, with their sophisticated hospi- tals, police, telephone com- munication systems, radio and television stations, transportation, food dis- tribution networks, finan- cial centers, and manufac- turing centers all eliminat- ed—gone—not much us- able left, and most likely too radioactive to ap- proach for many years to come. The situation might be reminiscent of the Cam- bodian experience of re- cent years, where a ruthless and irresponsible leader- ship evacuated the cities and forced an entire coun- try into an unnecessary di* saster. Imagine that situa- tion in your community, among your friends — per- haps worldwide! However, even in the worst of disasters, there will be some survivors. If not us, then our friends or rela- tives. Perhaps our children or grandchildren will be among those fortunate sur- vivors- There also will be some amateur radio opera- tors. Perhaps the best thing that w.^ can do for these people faced with a com- pletely unknown and hos- tile environment is to en- sure that they have every possible assistance avail- able to help them through the crisis. In communications, that assistance means that in a world where the estab- lished public system is no longer available, the technical preparations of amateur radio operators may make the difference between life and death for countless hundreds of thou- sands. It could be the final foothold in their struggle for survival. After all, assis- tance during disasters is one of our key elements, and a justification for an Amateur Radio Service. On- ly amateur radio operators can supply an organized communication system from almost every commu- nity in this country. Only amateur radio operators can supply this system with a substantial portion of the surviving equipment easily made operational after the shock of a nuclear explo- sion.

The job of amateur radio equipment protection is easy once we realize that it does not need to be diffi- cult or complex. Most any technical or non-technical operator can accomplish some EMP protection on short notice, with a very small outlay of money. The objective is to safely bypass your equipment and any in- coming connections when they are presented with an EMP signal composed of 40 to 50 kV and current in the order of 1,000 Amperes. (t is interesting to note that much of the EMP pro- tective equipment avail- able today has been de- signed since our country stopped testing nuclear weapons. As a result, none of it has received the only true test of reliability — on-the-job testing — al- though EMP simulators are used. Because of the lack of widespread testing capa- bilities, the only really prov- en method of protection is also the simplest Under this approach, all equip- ment to be protected should be disconnected from all external wires and AT RECEIVER TO ANTENNA* PANEL PEN£TRATIC>N ymmnji, &W\\li^^(!i CONVENIENCE BOX DIODE BRIDGE SERIES 450 FCC PROTECTOR^ OR EQUIVALENT \\ RF GASKET AfiO BOLTEO COVER SHIELDED ENCLOSURE fig. 3.

But a smart operator would keep a longwire and tuner stored as if to be used for Field Day for, in any emergency, the antennas can be expect- ed to take the brunt of the effects and may need to be replaced in the fastest time possible. The Department of De- fense publication EMP Pro- tective Systems suggests several approaches which should be used if you're go- ing to shut down for a while in anticipation of an attack. First you should open the master power switch at your service entrance. Second, all circuit breakers should be opened and all critical equipment should be turned off or disconnected. When the equipment and power are to be restored, all circuits should be checked for arc-overs or damage be- fore power is restored Be sure to disconnect tele* phone and cable television connections, because the advice indicates that there The response to our S100 Cash Rebate on Robot 400 Scan Converters and Model 800 Super Terminals was truly impressive.

Since the EMP energy in long overhead wires can be extremely hazardous, be sure people stay away from these wires during a time of possible at- tack. If you must have some radio equipment operating, dig out your old tube-type equipment and use it. Tubes are much less sensi- tive to high-voltage shocks and are more likely to re- cover It is felt that less protective shielding is nec- essary for broadcast receiv- ers with loopstick antennas or receivers with short an- tennas, including two-meter equipment. Again, how- ever, because there are so many unknowns, a wise op- erator would most likely consider any equipment in full use to be vulnerable. More advanced EMP pro- tective measures which allow more operating versa- tility also have been pub- lished under the name of the Defense Civil Prepared- ness Agency and may be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Washington, DC (ask for publication TR-61- B). These approaches to the problem center around the use of gas-gap arrestors, metal -oxide varistors (MOVs), coaxial tee pro- tectors for antenna cables, and improved grounding. Some of their suggestions are described here, so you can start on your protection right away. The approach requires some expense and would be used if you would anticipate operating during a nuclear threat. Improved grounding of a tower is extremely impor- tant for supplying a low- impedance path to ground for EMP current. The sug- gested way to accomplish this is shown in Fig, 1. The tower should be connected to the ground rods using 4/0 wire, An alternative is to install 20 radials about 12 to 18 34 73 Magazine • June, 1982 U] m 1 *^^ --* 1 ( 1 1 1 f-i n F-. 1 L U A U U\\ tbi AC tet it e- FIRING' CrRCUlT z SCR LOAD Fig. 10.

The approach could get very expensive at today's copper prices but would provide an undisputably super ground for your ver- tical. Be sure to connect the outside of your antenna feed cable shields to the ground. Any control cables going up the tower should be shielded in threaded conduit so there is a perfect conductive shield all along the. .line. A particularly sensitive part of an antenna circuit is a balun at the antenna feed- point. The best way to pro- tect a balun is to provide \"zero reaction time'' gas- gap arresters in parallel with all balun capacitors and inductors. Be sure to have the breakdown volt- age of the gas gap higher than that which you would expect under normal opera- tions, even under unusually high swr conditions. Gaps can have breakdown volt- ages ranging from 220 volts to 30 kV and have current ratings ranging from 3,000 Amps on up. The amount of time that any one gap arcs over is a factor to be considered when selecting the gap. Almost any gap can sustain a large number of low-cur- rent arc-overs, but only a few very-large-current arc- overs during its life. The specifications for each gap should be consulted if it is also to handle lightning-ar- resting chores in addition to EMP protection. Also, most gaps capable of EMP pro- tection are labeled as such.

Use 1N3653S and a 0.1-piF, 500-volt capacitor. considerable importance in rf circuits since the inter- electrode capacitance be- tween gap electrodes can cause additional capaci- tance to be put into the cir- cuit along with the gas gap. This capacitance can be on the order of 2 to 15 pF or more, depending on the type of gap. The capaci- tance can be reduced by connecting two gaps in series. If you use that ap- proach, be sure to put a 1 -megohm or higher resistor (about 1 Watt) across each gap to equalize the voltage between gaps Keep in mind, too, that connecting two gaps in series roughly doubles their breakdown voltage An example of the use of gas gaps in an anten- na balun is shown in Fig. 2. At the transmitter or re- ceiver you may use a gas gap or tee protector as shown in Fig. 3. The diode shown here is a silicon type. While this diode has a fast reaction time, it may not be able to sustain the needed current, and should be pre- ceded by a gas gap at a point closer to the antenna. Fig 4 shows a gas gap con- nected in a transmitter cir- cuit If you want to go first class and prepare the entire shack (Fig, 5X you could be in for a very expensive proj- ect, which may not be nec- essary if you can shut down your equipment as dis- cussed above However, if you wish to take that step, the FEMA recommends that the shack should be completelY encased in 18- to 2Crgauge galvanized sheet metal! To provide com- plete protection, the treat- ment includes the door and ventilation facilities. The 36 73 Magazine • JuneJ982 sheet metal should be fold- ed at the seams and sol- dered, with a strip of tinned- metal tape covering the seam. Telephone landlines should be brought into the shack via 50 to 300 feet of conductive conduit which is welded to the enclosure at the point of entry. The lines should be terminated in gas gaps, metal-oxide varistors, or both. Fig. 6 shows an example. Even your lighting system should have MOV protection as shown in Fig. 7\\ Ac power supply lines should have MOVs at all critical points, FEMA recommends that MOV rat- ings should exceed the stored inductive energy of the preceding transformer and also should exceed the no-load transformer cur- rent. Typical varistors have ratings of 40 joules (some are in the range of 10 to 200 joules] and should be in- stalled at 40 joules per phase of the ac line. Four lO-joule varistors connect* ed in parallel will provide the needed 40-jou!e protec- tion. Electrical distribution boxes and control boxes, of course, should be thorough- ly shielded FEMA recom- mends that doors and open- ings should b"
