S. Naval Reserve, thus overruling a special review board set up to consider the case of the 21-year-old honor graduate of the Merchant Marine Academy. Landy stood second, in his graduating class at the Kings Point, N. Academy last August, when the Navy denied him the commission normally granted academy graduates .\n\nBIT, THOMAS said. Navy instructions also state a security case decision \"must be based upon an overall common sense evaluation of al) available information concerning an individual.\" And his \"common sense evaluation,\" the secretary said, was that \"Landy's association with his mother was the natural relationship of mother and thev had looked at manv sites in Northeastern Ohio.
