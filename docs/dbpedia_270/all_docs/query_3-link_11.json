        "text": "Berkand Beck Bayram\n\nThomas was like a brother to me. He was such an amazing bloke and it is so sad that he was taken far too early from us. We first meet when we were 16 at college. I think both being Cypriots we had a natural connection with one another and though from opposite sides of the Turkish Greek divide sparked up a great friendship. During our first week at college, we had to work in pairs to learn how to use the photocopier by making different size of £5 or £10 notes. Tommy and I were partnered up and that was the start of our friendship. Over the next few years, we spent a lot of time together. He was great company. A funny, kind bloke. Some of the memories I have of Thomas are of him being the best man at my wedding and misplacing the wedding rings. He did also get to drive a Porsche for two days as my wife to be had hired one as a surprise to take me to the wedding, and he said he had a great time cruising from North London to Kent. How much he loved Prince, we saw him perform at Brixton Academy and I remember him dragging me along when he had a shop at Camden Town in the rare hope we may see him. Us being in the audience for a TV chat discussion show together – the Time and the Place – with Tommy being asked to sit in the front row, with the rest of us from college, helping to give the audience an ethnic mix sitting in the back rows. One eventful New Years’ eve, where we broke down in his car on the north circular in a really bad spot. We were not popular with many drivers that evening. Him crashing his car when he spotted a spider crawling up his leg! Him liking to remind me when he didn’t find me funny that I was only a visitor in his country and could easily be removed. Over the years we saw less of each other, but our friendship remained strong and it was always such a great pleasure to see or talk to Tommy. I’m so sorry I was not there for you more Tommy in the later years of your life, but you will always have a special place in my heart my Cypriot brother. I look forward to meeting you again in heaven where I have no doubt you and Prince are hanging out.\n\nMore...\n\nAndrea Kounis\n\nMy Cousin Tommy AKA Crispy Here are my memories of my cousin Tommy. When I first met my cousin, he was introduced to me as Crispy… a name that Eleni adopted for him (I believe after Golden Wonder Crisps). This name stayed with him amongst the cousins. Growing up, I had a special relationship with my cousin Crispy. We looked very similar because of our fair hair and our light coloured eyes….traits that we inherited from our Pappou Thomas. We were both quite quirky and we both shared an love for Prince. Growing up, Crispy had his own style which was testimony of his individualistic nature…. I remember when he would insist on wearing socks and trainers to the beach. He had a cheeky laugh and a dry sense of humour. He didn’t suffer fools….the roll of the eyes letting you know he had just encountered one! He was very principled and very strong willed and he never complained about his ailments. He was a very proud man and especially proud of his son. He liked to maintain himself and always looked good….Even in the hospice I remember how particular he was when I would cut his hair. He was very caring. He would always ask about others and put others first. I wasn’t around when he met Nina but I remember speaking to him and I could hear how happy he was in his voice. He was a family man. He loved his mum and brother to bits. He then went on to create his own family with Nina and Estella which completed him as a man. When Rafi was born, this was the pinnacle for him. I know that Crispy Rests in Peace knowing that his Legacy will continue with Rafi. I spent a lot of time with Crispy towards the end. We became so close. I will cherish this time that we had together and I am grateful that he let me in and allowed me to care for him, despite how proud he was. I love you Tommy. You will always be in my Heart, My Prayers and my Thoughts! Your Cuz Andri xxx\n\nMore...\n\nAndroula Theodosiou\n\nOne of the early memories I have of my nephew Tom is when he was around eight years old and was staying over with us. At around 11 o’clock at night he came and woke me up telling me he was hungry. I thought I’d quickly make him a toast but no, because Tom loved chips and wanted chips, and as there was no such thing as oven chips back then I had no choice but to make him proper chips. He also loved my koubebia and every time he asked, I would make them for him, even when he was unwell and in hospital that’s all he wanted me to take him. Tom also had a style all of his own and I can’t remember how many times I made his shirts more fitted and stylised to his specifications. Once, he bought a coat but was not sure if he liked it enough to keep, but it didn’t stop him from wanting it more fitted, after I altered it he wore it to work a week or so then decided he didn’t like it and sent it back and got a refund. Then there was a pair of jeans he wanted taken in, he pinned them himself to make sure I took them in enough, I told him they’ll be too tight but I still did what he wanted and surprise surprise a few days later he phoned and asked me if I could make them wider again as they were difficult to take off. Tom was such a character, kind and caring, and I really miss the times we spent together chatting and the funny and witty stories he would tell. He loved being around family and deep down he loved family life. He was the happiest when he married Nina, his rock, and together with his beautiful stepdaughter Estella and his beloved son Rafi his life was perfect. But life is never fair because Tom has left us too soon, and now memories of him have taken his place. Tom lived life to the full and even though he faced many hurdles and challenges he never complained and faced the end with indomitable heroism, courage and dignity. Rest in peace our Tom. Love you, till we meet again. XXX\n\nMore...\n\nEfty Mateides\n\nMy brother never really spoke too much about his feelings but I always knew how he felt about our relationship. Never more so when I went to visit my Dad in the US. I was there a week or so and had a phone call from Nina to tell me he felt vulnerable when I was not around. It is funny to think that he wanted me around so much because my life was never complete unless he was around too. One of my fondest memories about Tommy was his susceptibility to be easily swayed, especially when it came to buying cars. Tommy passed his driving test first time when he was 17 years old. 33 years a driver and an amazing 23 different cars over the years. Many were repeat buys! Four Supras, four Audi TTs, three MG BGTs, an MGB roadster, two MR2s, three Astra GTEs, two Golf VR6s, two Mini Cooper S, and I am sure I have missed a few. We travelled far and wide to buy cars. At first it was relatively close. Lakeside sticks in my mind (he swapped his first MR2 for a Golf VR6). On the way home I commented on how ‘boxy’ it was compared to the 2 seat sports car he had just swapped it for. He swore at me and said I had just planted a seed of doubt in his mind and by the time we arrived back at his house he had decided to sell it. He swore he would never go car shopping with me again. Of course we did and I had to promise before each trip I would keep my mouth shut. Of course I tried to abide. The most epic trip however was a few years ago when he had sourced what would have been his fourth Supra in Ayr, Scotland. The trip excited him. He had planned it all. George would drive us to Stanstead, we would fly up to Glasgow and get a train to Ayr. Due to track problems we had to change for a bus service in St Johnston. Ayr in January is freezing. Tom and I were huddled next to each other on the bus trying to keep warm when we saw a local walking about in a T-shirt and shorts. We looked at each other and Tom’s face said it all!! When we arrived after a five hour trip that started at 7am, he made me promise not to force him into buying it. I didn’t need to. After deliberating over lunch, he decided he didn’t want it. We were in Ayr with no plan on how to get back to London. The reverse trip must have cost him a lot but the look on George’s face when he came to pick us up from Heathrow was priceless! He did eventually buy Supra No.4 – from a farmer in Yorkshire. I drove it once and told him it was rubbish. He sold it and bought his fourth and final Audi TT. I miss him every day but am glad I have so many fond memories of this wonderful man it was my honour to call ‘Brother’. So many people have commented on how ‘cool’ Tommy was. He was unique and his ‘coolness’ was absolutely effortless. He didn’t have to try. He was just Tom - my wonderful, perfect brother.\n\nMore...\n\nEleni Haralambous\n\nMy Tommy was a little bit of a mother’s boy. One of the things I miss the most is his phone calls. He used to call me at least 3 times a day, just to check I was OK . He was always thinking of other people. He had his own way of expressing himself, a dry sense of humour and also his own style. As a young adult, he’d wear a bandana and an earring in one ear, which deep down I did like but I never told him that - truth be told, it really did suit him. He was different and I loved that about him. One day, I remember we went to see my parents and Tommy was wearing a pair of jeans that were ripped at the knees. My mum told him to take his trousers off so that she could sew them back together and he said “Yiayia, I bought them like that, it’s the fashion!” That was Tommy all over. As an adult, he was a very loving person, who mostly spoke softly and quietly. He had a cheeky smile and a memorable laugh. Tommy was very close with his brother. He would always ask him to help with certain things, especially when looking for a new car, which in Tommy’s case was often! Another memory of Tommy was his fear of spiders. One day he took my car and within a couple of minutes he was back, telling me he’d crashed it into a parked car down the road. He’d seen a spider on the windscreen and panicked. There are a lot of little incidents like that - too many to mention! Despite suffering with Crohns from a very young age he never let it stop him enjoying life. He had missed so much school because of his illness I was so proud that he took it upon himself to get enrolled at College and achieve his diploma. Even when he was ill, he didn’t want to stop working because he didn’t want to let anyone down. That said, he often did things his own unique way. When Tommy told me he had met somebody from Cardiff, he told me “mum, she looks like Kylie Minogue”. I liked Nina straight away and the got married in 2010. At the time he really wanted a dog so of course, the wedding invitations were of two bulldogs dressed up as a bride and groom. They were even on the wedding cake! Tommy and Nina’s wedding was never going to be like anyone else’s - they had their party on a boat along the River Thames, which Tommy would have described as ‘the nuts’! The only thing that could have made Tommy’s life any better was the day Nina gave birth to Rafael. Having Rafael was the best gift Tommy could have wished for and it made him the happiest man in the world. He’d waited a long time to have a child of his own and ever since Rafael was born, Tommy always had a smile on his face. He often said to me about Rafael, “mum, he’s the best”. Ever the unique person he was, he customised the last car he bought, (it was his fourth Audi TT) by adding his name to the driver’s door and Rafael’s on the passenger side. I know his only regret was that he couldn’t have more time with his son. I was able to share one last holiday with Tommy, Nina and the kids in 2019. It was the first time I went with them as a family. Tommy enjoyed it so much and it was nice to see everyone playing in the swimming pool, especially Rafael. Tommy left behind a beautiful family. He brought so much happiness into our lives. I love you so much and I miss you more each day. I know we will be together again one day. Rest in peace. Love mum xxx\n\nMore...\n\nThomas Theodosiou\n\nIt was from a young age that me and my cousin Tom formed a strong bond. We were close throughout our lives but it was when we were kids, especially during our early teenage years that we grew to be the best of friends. We’d meet up practically every Saturday and we always got up to so much. We were always out and about and would always be doing something different each week. If we weren’t hanging around in the park we were either ice skating, playing pool, playing tennis, one touch football, badminton or swimming. Sometimes we’d go and play golf at the New River sports centre and on one occasion we thought it was more fun sliding along on the damp greens, wrecking most of them. We also went to the cinema a lot and occasionally after we’d watched our film we would casually wonder into another screen to see what was playing and somehow end up watching that film too..!! We also spent a lot of time and all of our pocket money playing arcade games in the arcade round the corner from my mums, we were only eleven at the time and way too young to be there so it wasn’t long before we got rumbled, not just once but twice we got caught out by my dad who embarrassingly dragged us out by our ears, that said we still carried on going...!! Another regular routine we had was going for lunch to the local Wimpy restaurant where we would always sit at the same two seater table, the owner got to know us well and started reserving the table for us and would give us a strawberry milkshake on the house, we loved that. I won’t say we were naughty more mischievous, Tom a little more than me. One time when we were about 12 maybe 13 Tom came round and brought his new air pellet gun with him. We started off by shooting at targets in the garden but we soon got bored with that so without thinking of the consequences we stupidly decided to go up to my room and start shooting at passing cars. We managed to hit a couple and even managed to get one driver to stop and get out of his car to check his windscreen which we thought was really funny, this should really have been our cue to stop but no because (and I’m pretty sure it was more Tom’s idea) we stupidly decided to take it a step further and decided to start shooting at people walking by. Crazy now thinking back, but we did take health and safety seriously because we were only going to aim at the lower half of the body. Luckily our shooting skills were a bit off that day so we didn’t manage to hit anyone except our last target where we had a direct hit. Tom and me found it so funny that we just rolled around laughing hysterically, that was until we heard the front door bell ring, my mum opening the door and the guy we just hit angrily telling my mum someone upstairs has just shot him with a gun. Let’s just say the laughter suddenly stopped. Luckily we didn’t injure the guy much and with a bit of convincing from my mum he realised we were just silly kids and didn’t take things further, otherwise me and Tom could have been in BIG trouble. As for the gun it was never seen again...!!! Or was it…??? Whenever Tom and me got bored we just started doing very random things, like the time we decided to climb over the fence to the allotments at the back of my aunts garden to help ourselves to a few apples and blackberries. Did we get caught, yes we did, did we get marched out by a little old man, yes we did. Then there was the time when at the age of fourteen we somehow managed to buy fireworks and rockets and had our own Saturday afternoon fireworks party in my aunts garden. I won’t go in to too much detail except that we decided to carry out a few experiments like, what would happen if we put a firework in a half filled paint pot with the lid closed.? How high up can a rocket go with a small bucket attached to it.? What would happen if we taped a couple of fireworks to a rocket.? and so on... I think we rolled our luck that day because I’m amazed that we didn’t damage anything or accidentally start a fire…!!! When we were a bit older we loved going down to Camden market and the West End where we would always pop in to HMV, mainly it was to see if Prince had released any new music because as anyone who knew Tom, knows what a huge Prince fan he was, I was a big fan too and remember how excited we both were when we went to our first ever Prince concert together. It was just Tom and me. It was a brilliant night and I’m so happy to have shared that moment with him. We had so many other great times together throughout our lives but it was those early years that I spent with Tom that were very special to me and that I will always cherish so much. There is a big void in our lives now that Tom is no longer here but Tom’s legacy lives on, not only in our thoughts but in his beautiful boy Rafi. It is such an honour that Tom and Nina chose me and Andreas to be Godfathers. I see so much of Tom in Rafi and when he is a little older I will make sure he knows just how great, inspirational, funny and brilliant Tom was. Tom I am so grateful that I shared some of the best moments and memorable times in my life with you. Memories that I will never forget and always look back on with a big smile. You touched the lives of everyone, especially mine. You will always be in all our hearts and minds. Love you, miss you T.\n\nMore..."
