Brown, former public rela¬ tions adviser to Premier Ben¬ nett when he was opposition leader, had been hired by the Social Oedk government at $150 a day to do an in-depth study of the government’s in- lorniation systems. The report, • released IVi- d«y, recommends that a com- munications planning adviser be hired to co-ordinate inform mation services in govern¬ ment. Pix)vinciaJ Secretary Grace MttCarthy announced that Brown had been hired as the adviser. She said Brown’s study re¬ vealed “an incredible lack of information’’ ainuixg govern¬ ment departments. She said people ip one de¬ partment had no idea what was going on in adjacent de¬ partments and many of Brown’s rec ommendations dealt with ways IcT impnwe the situatitHi. Brown says many public servants learn of new govem- ntent iirograms through the new's media and this has a demoralizing effect. Senior i^eraonnel, he says, should be encouraged to meet with their counterparts in other departments, “both to gain an awreciation of each othei'’s activities and prob¬ lems and to dull the edge of the rivalries and jealousies \\Vhich exist between depart¬ ments.” “Walls of Ignorance or in¬ difference” have been allowed to separate deptirtmenta ^nd have resulted in duplication of facilities, equipment and human skills,^ Brown said. He recommends that all fu¬ ture programs presented for cabinet consideration be re¬ quired to include an outline of the communications proposed and their costs. The provincial government had allowed its image to be¬ come badly diffused, Brown said, and he recommended that the government under- , take a “visual identity pro¬ gram” which would see the development of one logo and letterhead for all government news releases. Each department now hM its own logo. The report also recom¬ mends that the Queen’s Print¬ er operaticffi move towards conversion to an offset sys¬ tem. Mrs McCarthy said talks had already bewi held about the technological change, ad¬ ding the cabinet had already accepted Brown’s recommen¬ dations. Brown said he had talked to union officials about the change and had assured Biem no employees would be dislo¬ cated.

(CP) — Clarence Wilkins, 62, thief of correctional services for the Northwest Teiritories since the fall of 1S67, said Friday he would resign be¬ cause of a Yellowknife jail training manual which drew an apology from the terri- lorUl government Thursday. He admitted ultimate i-e- sponsibility for the now- defunct Yellowknife Oorret- tional Institute training manu¬ al which waft criticized by the National Indian Broth¬ erhood Convention in White- horsd on Wednesday. A 13-page section In the manual made various dis¬ paraging comments about the psychological makei^) of In¬ dian, Metia and Eskimo pris¬ oners. Peter Ernerk, K.W.T. social development minister and an Eskimo. N.W.T.

Part of toe material came from a draft report by Ken • McReynoIds, then the territo¬ rial architectural consultant appointed to redesign the Yel¬ lowknife jail. In Toronto, McReynoIds said Friday toat he never said Indians were negative in their attitude toward improvement or lacking in pride.

Kissinger-Vorster talks open amid riots, deaths Colonist Nows Sorvict PRETORIA, South Africa — Secretary of State Henry Kissinger carried black Afri¬ ca’s demands for majority rule in Rhodesia to the capital of segregated South Africa Friday and proclaimed U.S. “responsibility” to help hlacks get independence. As Ki.ssinger arrived, at least eight blacks, six of them school children, were shot and killed by police Friday in an¬ ti-government violence that witnesses said began with an¬ ti-Kissinger demonstrations. The slayings occurred in the all-black Soweto township, 15 miles south of Johannesburg, Riot police fired into crowxls of schoolchildren demon¬ strating against Kissinger and chased them hack into their vlassrboms, clubbing them with rifle butts. Kissinger began his talks with Prime Minister John Vorster at the prime min¬ ister’s residence, Libertas, with a 2’2-hour private nject- ing before they w^re joined by officials and advisers for a working dinner which lasted until 10:30 p.m. Vorster reported primarily on his prior talks with Rhode¬ sian Prime Minister Ian Smith. Kissinger spokesman Laurence Egel^rger charac¬ terized the discussions as \"constructive” but did not elaborate. Another working dinner wa.s arranged for Satui^y night. Smith also was flying to South Africa over the week¬ end and said he hoped to talk with Kissinger, However, Kis¬ singer said en route to Pre¬ toria he had no plans to meet Smith. “I staled last Saturday be¬ fore I left Washington that I would meet Smith only under the condition that this was the final element in reaching a satisfactory conclusion,” Kis¬ singer said. “I do not have this knowledge today and therefore there is no basis for such a meeting.” Kissinger’s plane made a. wide detour on its flight from Lusaka, Zambia, to avoid Rhodesian airspace, flying in¬ stead over Mozambique, Por¬ tugal’s former colony in east¬ ern Africa. The United States does not recognize the Salis¬ bury regime in Rhodesia. Speaking before his depar¬ ture from Zambia, Kissinger C’/ontinned on Page t Open-shop resolution endorsed by UBCM VANCDL’VER (CP) — A resolutiim denounced by its opponents as approving “the ri^t to scab” was endorsed Friday by delegates to the Union, of B.C. Municipalities in Vancouver. 'The resolution, introduced by Vernon, states that no per¬ son should be denied employ¬ ment because of non-mem¬ bership in a labor organiza¬ tion. It also calls on the provin¬ cial government to stop enter¬ ing into any ^reement which excludes people from employ¬ ment because they ai*e non¬ union members. “This idea is dubbed cor- Gardom appeals for 40-hour week.

McKnighfs microirfionc ot toe convention floor was cut off on instructions of toe ses¬ sion chairman, Ald.'Alf Hood of Victoria, when he warned that the UBCM would be lead¬ ing itself into a major con¬ frontation with toe labor movement if it endorsed the resolution. Supporters of toe motion contended they were only try¬ ing to protect people’s free¬ dom of choice to be unionized or not be if they so desired. Those opposed said toat people have the freedom al¬ ready to not join unions,.al¬ though they must still pay union dues if working at an organized labor position. Aid. Mike Harcourt of Van¬ couver said the UBCM should have nothinig to do with “such a flagrantly anti-labor resolu¬ tion.” If workers are not happy with their union or a closed shop, they have the power Continued on Page S Tlie pi'Ofx)sed legislation, which was easily approved by a House of Representatives committee Thursday, aims at bi'eaking the Arab boycott of Israel by preventing U.S. cor¬ porations from dealing with the Arabs. It could have a drastic ef¬ fect in Canada which has a high proportion of U.S.-owned industry, and which takes about 35 per cent of its im¬ ported oil from Arab coun¬ tries. ' But e.xternal affairs and trade department spokesmen had no comment Friday on the proposal, saying they were awaiting copies of the amendment from Washington. “This is certainly an issue that’s very much in the fore¬ front for us,” one official said, “It is of direct concern for Canada.” He added that Canadian of¬ ficials do not have details of the legislation yet and it was premature to say anything. Minasters in both toe trade and external affairs portfolios were only appointed during a cabinet shuffle Tuesday and spokesmen said they probably have not yet been briefed on the issue. The two are E.\\ternal Af¬ fairs Minister Don Jamieson and Trade Minister Jean Chretien. A probable concern of the government would be toat the proposal would raise ques- ti(ms about extra-territorial application of U.S. laws. Simi¬ lar Issues have led to resent¬ ment in Canada in the past. The legislation would forbid U.S. companies from trading with countries engaged in a boycott. Foreign branches of toe companies would also be included under the House of Representatives proposal. Greyhound stork delivers^ surprise SEATTLE (AP) - When Cireyhound bus driver Richard Matzdorf pulled out of Vancouver for his non¬ stop run to Seattle, “toere were no babies on toe bus.” he said. But 150 miles later, as he was pulling into the Seat¬ tle terminal, a seven-pound, four-ounce girl had ap¬ peared. The driver still didn’t know'anything about it as he helfjed passengers from the, bus. “You better get help for that kdy.” a departing (>assenger told him. “She just had a baby.” The mother, 38, from Vancouver, had apparently delit^d toe baby herself in the restnx>m. Other passengers said they heard “crying from the restroom, and the girl came out and there was a new¬ born baby,” said Matzdorf. The young mother, who was travelling with her mother, and the baby were taken to University Hospital where both were reported in good condition. Name* were not released.

Prime Minister 'Trudeau said Friday he and his new calnnet must do a major selling job to regain support among skep¬ tical and uncertain (Tanadi- ans.

Trudeau said he'and his r^oiganized cabinet pondered the unhappy mood of the country and the unpopular state of the Liberal party fnr eight hours in toe seclusion of the Gatineau Hills north Ot¬ tawa but could not isolate a single over-riding reason for their recent drastic plunge in public support. When the meeting ended he told reporters toat his own credibility was “obviously very much a part of toe non¬ popularity our govemmeot is facing today.” He said he might have gen¬ erated new feelings of skep¬ ticism among the people over toe government’s ll-month- old anti-inflation program “but if I have, the ministers here knew it was the govern¬ ment’s cfedibility that wes lost.” Trudeau >a380 rejected sug- geations that former Post¬ master-General Bryce Macka- sey quit the cabinet in a huff Tuesday and said he still wants to bring back former consumer affairs minister Andre OueUet wbo resigned last spring at the height of the so'CaUed \"judges affair.” Almost all of toe 31-xnember cabinet attended the annual strategy session in the living- room of an opiilenrt wood-ond- stone mansion overlooking Meach Lake, about 20 m^es north of Ottawa.

I^en Guy, secretary- treasurer of the B.C..Federa¬ tion of Labor, said the labor movement -would fight any at¬ tempt to introduce right-to- work leid.slation.

Gardom and Vander Zalm both toM UBCM delegates that Canada’s economy was threatened Iby dropping pro¬ ductivity and increasing costs of doing business.

Shortly after arriving from Paris, he was confronted with fnterview mquests from the BBC — the state’s prestige television network — and the popular Daily Express, The newspaper asked for an exclusive interview with the .T7-year-old Conservative lead¬ er and his wife.

The F-14 would be such a military intelligence prize for the Soviets that it might gi\\e the Soviets better information than that gotten by U.S. investigators from the Soviet MiG 25 Foxbat fknvn to Japan by a defecting Soviet pilot. 'The F-14 now at the bottom of the Atlantic carried a .^500,000 Phoenix missile and equipment so secret that na¬ tions. such as Iran whach has ordered 80 F-14’6, cannot get it when they buy the aircraft, officials said. When the plane went Into the water Tuesday during NATO maneuvers, a Soviet Kresta class guided missile destroyer was a few miles away and its crew watched the accident. At least five Russian ships, two of the cruisers and the rest designed for surveillance, had been following the NA’TO ships. As the NA'TO convoy moved northward, wie of the Soviet ships stayed behind, circling where the F-14 went in. \"Obviously, they (the Rus¬ sians) are going to try to get it up.” Lt. Gen. Samuel V. Wilson, director of the de¬ fence intelligence agency, said. “It is generally known that they have salvage equipment closer to the area than we have,” he said- referring to the Soviet naval base at Mur¬ mansk. The F-14 can climb above 80,(HX) feet and its Phoenix missile can destroy an enemy more than 1)00 miles awray while it can track six Incom¬ ing missiles and fire its own weapons almost simulta¬ neously. The navy said It would try to keep the Russians from re¬ covering the F’-14, and w'ould i onsider destroying it with ex¬ plosives \"If it could not be ' raised.

Member Audit Bureau of Circulation RI^H.^RD BOWER - Publisher and Editor-In-Chief 1976 PAGE 4 SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 18. l»7f There will be howls C RIME STATISTICS niSn,OSED in the R.C, Police Commission’s annual report show that British Columbia faces risks and losses greater than anyone suspected. Not only has this province the highest crime rale of any in Canada, the ratio of solutions is the lowest in the country. And while, the commission’s shocking report was being studied, a panel of provincial court judge* pondered statistics showing heroin addicts were responsible for half the major robberies in the dreater Vancouver area in 1975, and discussed the advisability of making addiction a crime. It is an offence if a person is found with heroin in his pocket, or otherwise “in his possession, ” but not if he is running about with it in his bloodstream. The judges were told of Japan s approach to the problem of addiction, a matter of common knowledge for some years. A person with heroin in his body is con¬ sidered guilty of a crime'^nd can be compulsorily hospitalized for six months. There has been no sign of an increase in Japan's drug population since 1968. The panel, however, reached no firm conclusion — except, perhaps, that something should be done. And soon, it is to be hoped, even if it involve collisidn with civil righU groups. As for the crime rate, it is difficult to argue that law enforcement officers are too few or that the courts are too lenient. Nor would it be fair to suggest that the professional qualities of B C. policemen are inferior The crime figures only prove that lawlessness is increasingly a problem and that the juvenile ele¬ ment’s growing contribution in crimes of all kinds adds to the urgency of finding a solution. ^ Because of the over-extension of police forces last year, 300 nwre RCMP officers were recruited and there were “significant increases’’ in municipal forces. But still the crime rate remained highest in Canada. And itill juveniles in increasing proportion — one in three — were coming before the courts. This, so to speak, was only the tip of the iceberg. “Almost as many juveniles are diverted from the court process as are charged,” says the commision. And it predicted the time was approaching when juveniles would comprise two-thirds of the iden¬ tifiable criminal population. One is bound to conclude that permissiveness of our society is largely to blame for this state of affairs. It was a mistake, perhaps, to abandon the woodshed diplomacy, the school strap and the police birch. And having uttered the suggestion one can an¬ ticipate the howls. Seagoing shortcomings The major functions of what is called in Canada the Maritime Command are outlined in a defence department booklet in two languages as fol¬ lows: To maintain ( anada’s sovereignty by surveillance of coastal waters and adjoining ocean areas, including the Arctic archipelago; To contribute to collective alliance in the defence of North America and the North Atlantic; To contribute forces to international peace¬ keeping operations; To provide emergency communications, quick¬ reacting transportation, manpower and technical or scientific knowledge in the event of national emergen¬ cies or disasters; To provide training in maritime sea (sic) specialties; To command and tram the naval reserves stationed in 18 divisions from coast to coast; and To command and control assigned units of the Canadian Rangers. How many millions of square miles of patrol and surveillance or other activity this ambitious program Involves it is a little difficult to estimate. Canada’s coastline, according to the Columbia Lippincott Gazet¬ teer. is 14,820 miles in length. And that, multiplied by the 200-mile range of offshore responsibility amounts to a very substantial area. To do the multitudinous jobs, the naval forces pos¬ sess, so they claim, 23 “combattant ships.’’ But of these 23, three are supply ships of the Provider class, whose hitting capacity corr^ponds to that of a boy with an air gun; and three more are destroyer escorts of “C” classification, the Columbia, Chaudiere and St. Croix. These old ships are still afloat and that is all that can be said for them. It is claimed they could be refitted and recommissiofted in a matter of months. How many months, or how their fighting ef¬ ficiency would compare with newer, more modern, far faster and better armed vessels which they might be called upon to engage, are questions unlikely to get an encouraging answer. So, we are left with just 17 effectives: four Tribal Class destroyers with excellent strike capacity — they carry helicopters — eight destroyer escorts of fairly recent construction, four more of Ahe Restigouche class and four of the Mackenzie. And there are three patrol submarines, armed with standard 21-inch torpedoes, capable of 17 knots sub¬ merged and only 12 on the surface. * These are the vessels required to do all those jobs earlier ennumerated. Even with the additional patrol capacity of the Coast Guard and the little RCMP launches, Canada’s naval strength has never been so totally inadequate. It is reminiscent of the First World War period when the ancient cruiser Rainbow was Canada's sole defence against a German cruiser squadron rampag¬ ing in the Pacific. It was at this time that B.C.'s Premier Sir Richard McBride angered and humiliated the federal government by purchasing two sub¬ marines. What it will take to slap some sense of respon¬ sibility into Ottawa heads it is too sad to imagine. Nothing short of catastrophe will demonstrate the gravity of what might be called seagoing shortcomings to this government, it must be presumed. And by then, of course, it will be too late. In Latin America Tension in church-state relations ( Tlie Roman Catholic Church is increasingly at odds with a number of governments in Latin America. ’The signs are many: When three Chilean Cathobc bishops, returning from a church conference in Ecuador last month, were hostilely greeted by crowds at San¬ tiago’s Pudahuel Airport, that country’s Catholic hierarchy accus^ the government of authoring the violent demonstration. It also excom¬ municated four government of¬ ficials. Earlier in August at the ses¬ sion in the Ecuadorian city of Riobamba. 97 churchmen from around Latin America were ar¬ rested, detained overnight, and then expelled from the country for taking part in what the government termed \"a subver¬ sive plot.” Ecuador’s church hierarchy promptly accused the government M illegally in- terferring in church activities. Argentina in recent months has been arreatii^ churchmen and young aeminarians. in¬ cluding one United States priest, on chargee of subver- sion and of poeeeasing Marxist- Lenlnist literature. The U S. clergyman was released, but the fate of 11 others Is unknown and the Argentine hierarchy has issued a series of protests. WWW Meanwhile, Brazil's Dorn Helder Camara, a longtime op¬ ponent of the Brazilian govern¬ ment and bishop of Recife and Olinda, issued a new chtici.sm of governments in Latin America saying they “no longer serve the people.” By JAMES NELSON GOOD 6 ELL Behind these and other developments is a sharp ideological dispute that has led to the most serious deteriora¬ tion in church-state relations in years. Not since Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro tangled with that country’s Roman Catholic hierarchy has there been such a church-state clash. In that struggle, which even¬ tually resulted in a standoff, the church took a basically con¬ servative approach. Dr. (^stro a much more liberal or radical one. WWW The current church-state cleavage in at least six nations reverses the positions of churchmen and governments. It is not lost on observers also that the governments in question are all rightist military regimes. The Catholic Church In Argentina, Brazil, Chile. Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay is on the liberal aide, the state on the conservative, even reactionary side — although the dispute is not be¬ ing stated in such terms. Part of the confrontatioB in¬ volves a new militancy on the part of the churchmen who believe they have the right, even the duty, to speak out on national issues, particularly those relating to human rights and political liberties. This certainly is the case in Chile where the Roman Catholic hierarchy is in¬ creasingly opposed to the hard¬ line, conservative tactics of Gen Augusto Pinochet Ugarte’s military-dominated government. Chile’s influen¬ tial Raul Cardinal Silva Henrii- quez, the Archbishop of San¬ tiago and Chile’s leading churchman, has frequently tangled with General Pinochet While he has tried to keep the dispute out of public view, their disagreements are becoming common knowledge. Excommunication of four Chileans, one of them a govern¬ ment official, for the airport harassment of three returning bishops was a clear sign of Car¬ dinal Silva Henriiquez’s at¬ titude. A statement, accom¬ panying. the excommunication order and issued with the Cardinal’s approval, warned against the danger of abuses under the military regime and of “omnipotent police state’’ governments across Latin America. WWW That also seems the preoc¬ cupation of Dorn Helder, the Brazilian bishop who has long chafed under the restraints placed on him by fellow churchmen who did not want to rock the boat of church-state relations in Brazil. But more and more bishops and archbishops in Brazil are protesting repressive measures by their country's military-dominated govern¬ ment. This repression, often aimed at leftists, has meant large- scale abridgements of civil rights in the countries with military govenunents. IVE I>ECIl>E> to M5/E My AFFILE rOTllEAAAINLANit>.. UIE FERRY FARES AREKILLlMGWEf Radical aid changes More help for the wretched Churchmen meeting In Ecuador at the pastoral con¬ ference in Riobamba, were in fact discussing this issue — hence, the Ecuadorian govern¬ ment charge that the con¬ ferees were engaged in sub¬ versive activities. An Ecuadorian government source, explaining the arrests and deportations of the foreign bishops, said that “the clergy must abide by the laws of the nation and to question govern¬ ment actions is a crime.” This goes along with an Interior Ministry statement in Argentina, following the ar¬ rests in Ecuador: “When priests have been detained it has been for fully justified reasons” But churchmen, while not disagreeing with the philosophy that they are sub¬ ject to arrest, argue that repressive military govern¬ ments do not have legitimate cause for many of their ac¬ tivities. This increaslnf social and political orientation of the Roman Catholic clergymen Is what arouses the Ire of govern¬ ments. particularly military regimes, and the outlook for the future is for increasing ten¬ sion in church-state relations. The 31st session of the United Nations General Assembly, meeting in late September, will have before it a report which hopes to put a human face on development work. If the assembly approves and governments of developing countries implement it. the minimal needs of human life such as safe drinking water, rudimentary health care, bel¬ ter food, elementary education and essential welfare services will be brought to the 900 mil¬ lion people who live, without them now. The report by the 30-natlon Executive Boai^ of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), which met last May, is based on a document UNICEF prepared in consulta¬ tion with several other UN agencies. It would take a 15-year period, for the purposes of planning, to achieve this enor¬ mous task. Implementation, however, could take longer. Estimated cost . $8,000 million in external assistance. As it stands, it means an average of about $500 million a year in external assistance with an equivalent investment from participating countries. The concept, known as Basic Services, is a broad-based ef¬ fort to stimulate self-help. Peo¬ ple would be trained to cope with problems that confront their own communities. It aims to bridge the gap between services and their availability—not as an alter¬ native to existing services but as a way of extending their reach. TTie approach results from a growing concern in developed and developing nations that the huge sums of money poured into development over the years has brought no noticeable improvement in the lives of most people of develop¬ ing countries. Big projects such as dams, bridges, universities and hospitals hsve brought a measure of prosperity and helped to Improve the quality of life for some people, but a vast and growing majority re¬ main deprived of basic neces¬ sities. A few statistics prove the point; • Under 10 per cent (203 mil¬ lion) of the rural population of developing countries (2,032 million) is within walking dis¬ tance (10 km.) of a national health facility of any kind. • A World Health Organiza¬ tion (WHO) study of 91 less- developed countries showed that 85 per cent of the rural population has no access to safe-drinking water. • WHO estimates that three per cent, or about 10 million, of children under five in develop¬ ing countries suffer from By MEHR KAMAL from New York protein-calorie malnutrition and another 80 million from moderate level of malnutrition. • Nutritional deficiency diseases afflict large numbers of persons; goitcfi.400 million; anaemia 300 million; xeropthalmia 100 million. UNICEF is particularly con¬ cerned because, in a situation of deprivation, children and mothers are the most vulnerable. In developing countries 25 to 30 per cent of the children die before their fifth birthday. In many countries, deaths under five years of age may equal 50 per cent of total deaths. Those who survive this period can usually look forward only to a marginal existence. Prospects for them are bleak, with continuing denial and deprivation of health protec¬ tion, of adequate nutrition, of educational opportunity, of social emancipation. ★ ★ ★ In spite of efforts by develop¬ ing countries to change the situation, it is likely to continue unless there is a change in development strategy. Developing countries have limited resources both in finances and trained manpower which makes it difficult, if not impossible, to provide all these services to their people. The basic services, which the (General Assembly is being asked to urge developing coun¬ tries to incorporate in their national development strategies, are simple, low-cost and community-oriented. The approach involves the active participation of the com¬ munity itself in a group of ‘interrelated, mutually- supportive activities” ranging from maternal and child health care, including family plann¬ ing. safe water supply and waste disposal to production and consumption of better foods, basic education and sim¬ ple technologies to lighten the daily tasks of women and girls. ★ ★ ★ The community would be in¬ volved in this task at all stages from the initial identification of needs to the planning and im¬ plementation. Suitably trained, locally selected people would work as primary-level workers, part or full-time, within the community. They would be the “front-line” oif basic services delivery and would have an important motivational role. Existing national social ser¬ vices networks would be used and many more auxiliaries ad¬ ded who would provide a link between the national services and the “front-line’’ workers in villages and urban shan¬ tytowns. By enlarging these aux¬ iliaries' responsibilities the country’s skilled professionals would be freed to concentrate on training, supervision and other broader responsibilities. Several countries are already experimenting with this approach on a small scale. In health care, auxiliaries are being increasingly used to make services more generally available at lower costs. Even in developed countries like the United States, the use of midwives and an enlarge¬ ment of their responsibilities is increasing in some areas in¬ cluding New York State. In schools, the use of teachers’ assistants is increas¬ ing. In some districts of Sweden, .school is open on alter¬ nate weeks, thus putting more responsibility on the family’s self-help activity. The Basic Services approach is. therefore, not novel. It is be¬ ing described as a “new dimen- sion ” in development work because for the first time, a large-scale and Integrated im¬ plementation of such a wide range of activities with popular participation is being ad¬ vocated. ★ ★ ★ The report calls for decentralize planning and the concept of doing things with people rather than for them. It states that, successfully organized as a first-stage developmental operation, this could be the way to a progres¬ sive advancement by rural and urban communities to an im¬ proved quality of life. It invites bilateral donors, in¬ ternational aid-giving agencies and all authorities “interested in promoting programs of human development ” to con¬ sider and adopt this strategy.

A civil servant can retire at 55 if he has at least 30 years of ser¬ vice. His pension in that case would be 60 per cent of the average of his higher .Aarning years. He can. by working 95 years, attain the maximum of per cent of his higher earn¬ ings. And his pension benefits are hitched to thecost of living, so that if it rises, so does his pension. ITiese are far richer pensions than most private employers and employees can afford. In fact, a private company and its workers would have to pay $1 of each $8 of an employee's pay to reach such a standard. Few do so. C. L. Lockhart, president of The Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, estimated in June that 70 per cent of private sector From The Globe and Mail employees have no retirement pension at all to lo(A forward to except the (\"anada or Quebec Pension Plans. Private companies have to be cautious about the pension agreements they make with their workers because they have to be able to afford them. If they prejudiced too much of future profits to pensions they would go broke. This is an inhibition to which governments are paying alar¬ mingly little heed. The share of the federal pension p^in will be less and less paid by civil ser¬ vants, and more and more paid by the taxpayers (who have no such riches to look forward to themselves). But. the bad ef¬ fects lie chiefly in the future, so governments do not weigh them. Britain is finding that the ab¬ solute cost of government pen¬ sions is beyond its means. It has a million civil servants on pension; their pensions are in¬ dexed to the rise in the cost of living; without a change in the law this would give Uunn a 15 per cent increase in December—more than twice the permitted increase in British wages—and would come on top of a 26 per eeift in- crease last Decepnber. Or¬ dinary wage-earners and tax¬ payers. with no such pehsiona, are furious at the coat: and the staggering British economy cannot afford it. That is one danger. The bill can become so heavy that the taxpayers refuse to pay it or the economy collapses. There is another danger. The taxpayers will demand pen¬ sions as good as those they are subsidizing for civil servants. They will want their penskms to be aa big. They wiM want them to be indexed to the cost of living. They will want to be able to collect them at 60, then at 55, then—aa now with the TTC—at between 50 and 55. And that way lies certain dis¬ aster It is people in the work force who produce all the goods and services that are consumed. The government has projected that by 2025 there will be 223 per cent more Canadians over 65 But the total population will have grown by only 85 per cent. Even without enlarged pen¬ sions and a lowered pension age, the burden on the workers would be enormous. But add to the pmsioned all those who, like the TTC workers, will be taking retire¬ ment much earlier than 65, and the burden on the workers would be intolerable. In fact, it would not be tolerated by the gn;>up of Canadians sandwi^ed between the late school leaver* and those taking early retire¬ ment. They wouldn’t work. We are already close to pricing ourselves out of world and domestic markets. In such cir¬ cumstances, we would certain¬ ly do so. Governments and govern¬ ment bodies like the TTC yield to such demands because they are paid out of what they con¬ sider the bottomless govern¬ ment purse. In the federal case, self-interest was added: MPs themselves benefitted. Michael Warren. TTC chief general manager, tried to hold out for a settlement that would bring TTC costs under better control. But he was under pres¬ sure to settle from the provin¬ cial government. He seenis to be one of the few people in government service—elected or appointed—who can see the dangers down the road. But the dangers are there, and the TTC settlement brings them closer. SDflil]? C0l0nifi(t .Victoria, B.C.,'Saturday, Sept. 18, 1976 5 conform—after first deciding to be By MELVIN MADDOCKS from New York non-conformist iy Not long ago the New York :$ Times ran a story on $ motorocyclists, headed; “From Wild Ones to Mild Ones.\" 1110 law of cliches goes like $ this: When you’ve pushed a J: cliche as far as it will go, you $ reverse it and push it a little further. And so, after all these years of identifying motor- cyclists as Hell’s Angels and Easy Riders, the idea is to pre- sent bikies as bank vice- presidents, professors of Medieval Latin, and so on — the tiger as pussycat. •ij If one puts together the sam- pies cited by the Times into a composite portrait of the new bikie, one comes up purring with something like a 2&‘year- old woman theologian in a Pierre Cardin suit and a •‘muted-rose’’ helmet. Deliver us from our bike stereotypes! — in either direction. The only generalization to be derived from all this is that people have become a lot more conformist in the past 10 or 1 S’ years, since they decided to be non-conformist. Well, there’s got to be one more generalization, of course. Big Sweeper No. 2 reads: Hiis conforming nonconformity has. a little pathetically, taken place on the edges rather than in the centre of life, manifesting itself mostly as an after-five and only-on- weekends phenomenon. “Life-style ” is what we have chosen to call it, with the emphasis on style. It has been a branch of fashion rather than, philosohy. Who needs another rundown of the co-opting of the counter¬ culture which has, at different times, left John Lennon and Ringo Starr shaving their heads in a despairing reaction against the total success of the Beatles’ long-hair look’’ When did the reversal of cliches begin dooming the old minority to become merely the; first members of the new ma¬ jority? Historians who date by documents may trace the pop¬ ularity of non-conformity back to Norman Mailer’s 1957 essay. The Hip and the Square. (falling his hero variously a •hipster.” a \"White Negro,\" a • wise primitive, ” a “psycho¬ path, and not a psycho¬ path, \" Mailer, with hg| flail¬ ing, wade-in style, was at¬ tempting to give the coup de grace to the artist’s old alleged enemy, the uptight bourgeois. He set up one of the first of the charts-of-chic to distinguish between the \"hip\" and the \"square.\" The “square.” Mailer decreed, was to be associated with dull words like \"prac¬ tical,\" \"logic,” \"orderly, ” \"pious, ” \"the past.” The \"hip\" was to be connected with glamorous words like \"wild,\" \"romantic,” \"instinct.” \"spon¬ taneous.” \"rebel,” “the present,'■ and—yes!—“mo¬ torcycle.\" So we are about to celebrate the 20th anniversary (more or ^ less) of the Age of Non- (-onformity. And where can we possibly fit all the “ wild, •romantic.\" \"spontaneous’ folks, who are now a dime-a- dozen? What Mailer had not counted upon was how quickly and ef¬ ficiently his concept of a new elite could turn into mass- merchandise. The children and grandchildren of Babbitt have become ““hipsters” by the wlf- parodying millions — with •homes in the'suburbs and the most prudent insurance policies they can obtain on their motorycycles. It is time for new lists. If they were \"squares.\" puritaas for too long, they have now been ‘ hipsters,\" ahti-purltans for too long as well. We are trapped and diminished by our conspicuous non-conformity as much as our fathers afid mothers were by their con¬ spicuous conformity. For 200 years now, from pious Benjamin Franklin to im¬ pious Norman Mailer, we've been more or less publicly pur¬ suing (iood Old Individualism. Perhaps we should try a private approach — give up the contradictory and self- defeating notion that rugged in¬ dividualism doesn’t count un¬ less everybody is watching and applauding. Alternatives are, in fact, available. \"The Soul selects her own Society.” Emily Dickinson wrote. “Then shuts the door. To her divine majority — Present nO more. Nothing very • wild\" or \"romantic” here. But was there ever a more accurate, more intense statement of what individualism — in all its exultation, in all its terror - reallv means (opyrighl I97ft- rhr Chrialiaa .S<'iMire PuhliKhing Sot-irly Connaliv, Reagan and Rockefeller Men Ford roughed up still ”Come November, 1 think we can add the destruction of the Republican Party.” May 1 take this opportunity to explain why 1 made a com¬ plaint to the deputy chief of police regarding the play Equus as reported in your paper. Firstly, 1 did so as a member of the Victoria Council of Churches which is actively engaged in the problem of por¬ nography and violence in many aspects of the media. The committee was first concerned when the play was originally advertised with a warning that there was \"some nudity and explicit sex. \" This was later changed to implicit Why do Messrs. Connally, Reagan, and Rockefeller press on? Each had been roughed up by President Ford or those around him. Yet they all are working for Ford in the cam¬ paign. Why wouldn’t they decide to nurse their bruises and sit on the sidelines? For each there is a different answer. For Connally. a close friend of the Texan tells us. his decision to go out and work for the party and the president is simply part of his own continuing campaign to “regain credibility.” Connally“s main goal in life now. we are told, is to erase the stain on his reputation that remains from his alleged tie to the milk-fund scandal. Connally won his acquittal. But. as he knows better than anyone else, his public image was severely damaged by the charges leveled against him. Connally, lUs friend assures us. is much more interested today in achieving respectability than in gaining any public office. Thus he realy wasn’t that disappointed when he wasn’t chosen for Ford’s No. 2 man. But Connally does feel that aides of Ford knifed him and failed to level with him during those last weeks before the convention. In other moments in his career this of itself might have persuaded Connally to drop off the boat. But not this time. He is pictured as being gratified that the president and (X)P con¬ gressional candidates in all sections of the United States now are asking for help. • Remember.\" his friend said. \"ho\\y low Connally was not too long ago in public opinion — and htjW low Cohnally's spirits were. too. Now Connally is being told by politicians that his campaigning for them is an asset. It makes him feel very good, this evidence that his image is improving. It’s what he wants out of life right now. ” Now to Ronald Reagan. Who. one must ask, would be more justified than he in sitting this one out? But now has as¬ sured the president that he will jump in and help him. Further, one of Reagan's top aides says there are \"compelling reasons \" why Reagan is willing to get out and work for Ford. By GODFREY SPERLING Jr. from Washington “ To begin with.\" the aide says, \"Reagan isn’t the kind of perswi who sulks in his tent. But beyond that Ylon knows that he can hurt himself with Republicans here in California and all over the country if he doesn’t help Ford. They could sour on him. “ Now Reagan probably won’t ever seek public office again. But he would like to pick up the leadership of the party — hopefully all over the country but, certainly, right here in I. back him California. And he knows that he will forfeit any chance of achieving such a goal if he stays on the sidelines now.” The Reagan side also says that if Reagan can help win (California for Ford, this could be a big political plus for the former California governor, particularly if Ford should lose the general election. \"Under those circumstances,” he says, Reagan — not the defeated Ford — would become the titular leader of the Republican Party.” Finally, what about Rockefeller, who was badly bashed and embarrassed by his party and by some of those around the president during the last 12 months? Rockefeller, like Reagan, could well say to Fond. “ You didn’t fight to keep me on the ticket and you let some of your aides cut me up — so I’m saying goodbye.” But a close observer of Rockefeller’s ways says. \"Rocky IS going to go all-out for the president. And why? Well, he has maintained his friendship with Ford. But, beyond that. Rocky synply Isn’t finished with government. He’s not ready to hang it up. \"Rocky loves to be in the middle of things.’’ the observer says. “‘That’s what life is all about for him. He even kind of likes a scuffle. And he takes.the kind of beating he had in the vice-presidency with real aplomb. He didn’t like it. But he knows that this is just politics. \"So Rocky will do anything the president asks. He’ll stump for him. go on television for him. anything. Rocky would like to see Ford win because he thinks it would be bet¬ ter lor the country for Ford to win. But he would also like a top appointment. And that, he knows, would only come from Ford. \"He'd like a cabinet post — preferably state or defence. But he would settle for ambassador to the UN or to Great Britain. \"Rocky isn't ambitious. He’s had about everything ex¬ cept the presidency — and his search for that is over. But he still needs to be in the midst of the action. That’s what keeps him from fading quietly into anonymity now. ” Copyright—II7S.

It would appear that the Criminal Ckide is inade¬ quate to cover these extremes. There are many who feel as 1 do that section 150 of the code needs revision to ensure that further deterioration does not occur. However, what needs to be done is far more radical and far reaching than reform of the law and the increase of restraints. As T. S.

But in a different vision That vision 1 contend will only be realized when we recognize that we are living in an age of God's judgment and that we need to repent df our wickedness and seek God s forgiveness. No doubt as the natural catastrophes of this apocalyp¬ tic age increase many will cry out and say, why is the God of Love allowing this to happen? But God would raise counter questions: Who is responsible for pollution? Who is responsi¬ ble for terrorism? Who made fhe nuclear weapons? Who is responsible for perversion in its many forms'?

New role mystery for Mao's widow By JACQUES LESLIE from Hong Kong When a grief-stricken Chiang C]!hing ar¬ rived at Peking’s Great Hall of the People last Saturday to mourn the death of her hus¬ band, Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung, many Chinese officials undoubtedly hoped she was beginning her last series of public ap¬ pearances. For 61-year-old Chiang Ching (pronounced jyang cheeng) is not merely Mao’s widow She is now the fifth-ranking member of the (liinese (’ommunist Party and a leader of the \"radical” faction which has held sway over Chinese politics intermittently during the last decade. Because of her sometimes vituperative manner and her riseHo power bas^ on her relationship to Mao, she often has been compared to the Emress Dowager Tzu-Hsi. the strong-willed ex-concubine who ruthlessly ruled China at the turn of the cen¬ tury. bn a television broadcast of last Satur¬ day's mourning ceremony, Chiang Ching ap¬ peared with other memb^-s of the Com¬ munist party politburo. She looked pale and exhausted, ^e wore a silk scarf on her head and a black trouser-suit. • A wreath placed inside the hall was in¬ scribed, \"deeply mourn the esteemed great teacher. Chairman Mao Tse-tung.” It was sent by \"your student and comrade-in¬ arm Ching,” and other members of Mao's family. Chiang Ching again attended mourning ceremonies Sunday, but has not appeared since. Because the chief source of Chiang Ching’s power was her ability to act as Mao’s spokesman and messenger, his death probably will result in the decline of her in¬ fluence. John Fairbank, the well-known scholar of modem China, recently predicted that she would quietly go to teach school somewhere” after Mao died, and a few other Western observers already have written their political obituaries of her. But all that seems at least premature. \"The fact that she has continued in her Politburo rank during the mourning period indicates her acceptance as a member of the group,” one Western diplomat.said. \"But that could be short term.” Apparently in anticipation of Mao’s death and the unrest it could provoke. China’s leadership began a month ago to stress the need for national unity. That theme was reiterated as late as Thursday, a week after Mao’s death, in an editorial appearing jointly in three major Chinese government organs It thus appears unlikely that any major realignment will be made in the nation's leaderhip soon. While Chiang Ching probably has the most enemies of any high-ranking of¬ ficial. her removal from power undoubtedly would antagonize the \"radical\" faction that she supports. Most Of the. other leading radicals in-' eluding Politburo standing committee members Wang Hung-wen and Chang Chun- Chiao probably could easily survive Chiang (thing’s departure. But at least one. Shanghai propagandist Yao Wen-Yuan, might find his position weaker without her support. On the other hand, it is assumed that China’s \"moderates” would like to see her out of power. Ousted first vice^premier Ten Hsiao-ping, previously considered the moderates’ leader, was attacked in the radical-controlled press for criticizing her. After years of political obscurity as Mao’s wife. Chiang Ching began to show an interest in cultural productions in 1963. Encouraged by Mao. she rose to prominence during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s, became a member of the party Politburo and was placed in charge of the na¬ tion's cultural affairs. (Considering the emphasis which (Thina’s \" radicals put on nationalism and self reliance, (’hiahg Ching in 1972 acted un¬ characteristically : She surprisingly agreed to an American Sinologist’s request for an audience, and then gave an interview that lasted more than 60 hours over a one-week period Those discussions are the foundation of a book which is to be published this year. Though contents of the book are still un¬ known. the author, Roxanne Witke. an as¬ sociate professor of history at the State University of New York,, implied recently that the book would offer clues as to Chiang (Ching’s intentions after Mao's death. \"She was very aware that few Chinese women have risen to power and even those that did, after they have fallen, have usually become objects of recrimination.\" Ms. Witke was quoted as saying. She felt this very un¬ fair. \"She might become in effect dowager empress in a period of transition. The prece¬ dent is there in (China’s past. But these days, of course, communist purists don’t want to see themselves as being moved by the same structural imperatives as obtained in the im¬ perial eras gone by.” Chiang Ching’s fate may depend on the ability of CChina’s leaders to diffuse the ten¬ sion that exists among political factions. If they are successful, she might remain because of the indirect prestige she com¬ mands as the widow of the venerable chairman. But it is also unclear whether she has the will to stay active politically following Mao’t death. Chiang Ching’s background hardly sug¬ gests her future leadership role. She was born to a family of modest means in 1914. Her father died soon after and, according to one unverified a^ccount. her mother tried to sell her to a prostitution ring. She later emerged in Shanghai a.s a bit player in movies. She was then known as Lan Ping. After an unsuccessful marriage, in the late 1930s she went to the communist enclave in the city of Venan in northern China, met Mao and eventually bet ame his fourth wile. The Let Angeles Times Now!

Tool Town will oNer Victoria shoppers 8.000 square feet of retail space with departments catering to everything from hand tools and hardware to work clothes. Wayne Ford. 33. formerly assistant manager of the Kelowna T 09 I Town store, will manage the chain s Victoria store. Ford joirred the organization five years ago as a salesman in the Vancouver store and moved up the ladder within the chain. He II staff his store with Victoria personnel who will serve customers during the store's convenient hours of 8 a m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday to Saturday. Many professional builders are so impressed by the list of merchandise carried by Tool Town stores that they have made the chain their centre for building supplies. Many spieclallzed items that are hard to find are stocked on Tool Town's shelves. Commodities like soss hinges and locks, heavy-duty dead bolts and patio door hardware can be purchase easily with one quick trip to Tool Town. Home Improvement centres are often overwhelming places to the beginning home handymen who are still a lit- tfe wary about how to use the myriad of equipment lining the shelves. But at Tool Town even the novice can feel at home since every department is staffed with a specialist to assist and advise shoppers on their chosen protects. tn most cases. Tool Town deals direct with the factories, ordering in bulk quantities to obtain better prices for the consumer. Wherever possible it avoids fancy packaging and passes the savings onto you But while Tool Town cuts down on the unnecessary frills to bring prices lower, it never scrimps on service Someone is always there to answer questions or help with a purchase. Originated in 1955. Tool Town is the summation of a plan to provide a distribution service at a competitive price to housebuilders. Over the years it enlarged its activities into larger stores to cater to the do-it-yourself market Tool Town IS the direct distributor lor national brand lines like Nutone. Stanley tools and hardware. Bockwell. Black and Decker. Sandvik. Ajax. Acme. General Electric. Admiral.

Allan suspended sentence, putting Smith on probation tor six months, and then ex¬ plained what eveiy judge must say when probation is ordered. A person who violates pro¬ bation by committing a crime can be charged with the crime and with a breach of prctoation. ihi addition, he can be brought back and sen¬ tenced on the original offence for which he received proba¬ tion. This has hai>pened only a few times in the past seven years in Victoria court. Victor Maurice Turchynskl, 32. of 2284 Harbour, Sidney, appeared before Allan on six charges and was remanded one week, at the request of Legal Aid duty coiin^l Wil¬ liam MoCallum, for a bail hearing and xxMsible pleas. Turchynskl appeared on bench warrants on four Sid¬ ney charges -r- one each of impaired driving and driving with a blood-alcohol reading above .08 per cent June 29, 1975, and Oct. 17, 1975, and two dated Nov. 5,1975, of fail¬ ing to remain at an accident and wilful damage. Two new Victoria charges were read, of failing to ap¬ pear In th« Victoria court Feb. II and Feb. 23 this year. Vancouver resident Brant Sidney Hodson, 26, was chaiged with being unlawfully at large July 3 from the Wil¬ liam Head institution and re¬ manded at his request to Wednesday for further hear- ihg. Ctolwood RICMP announced earlier this week Hodson, who had been reported July 4 as failing to return from a pass to a correctional centre on Pandora, had been appre¬ hended In Prince Albert, Sask. Prosecutor Hobert Mulligan said bail would not be at Issue because Hodson was serving a prison term. Police had stated Hodson was serving four years tor robbery. Detention in custody with¬ out bail was ordered by Allan for Roderick Edmund Tate- ham, 18, of 710 Fort, on two Victoria charges — one of theft and possession of krawn stolen property and the other of carrying a concealed weap¬ on and possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace. At the re¬ quest of defence lawyer Ni¬ cholas Lott, Allan prohibited publication or broadcast of bail-hearing details. The case was remanded one week for further hearing. Douglas Michael Reeves, 18, of 2034 Chaucer, was or¬ dered by Allan to face trial in a higher couit. The qtj ter fol¬ lowed a prelimina^iwraring of a charge of possession of marijuana June 8 in Victoria for the purpose of trafficking.
