HIS BELOVED TEACHER AND FATHERLY FRIEND, THIS WORK IS DEDICATED, AS A SMALL TOBIEN OF THANKFUL LOVE, BY THE AUTHOR. PREFACE FIRST VOLUME. The present work forms the beginning of a series of critical researches respecting the history and doc- trines of the ancient Churchy which hare for several years engaged the author's close attention, and which, should life and health be continued, he intends, from time to time, to lay before the public. He has a two- fold object in view, partly religious and partly critical, in publishing them. He wishes, in the first instance, to contribute his mite, by the most faithful description in his power, of the spirit and efforts of the Church, in the primitive age, towards the revival of that genu- ine fellowship, of feeling and views in the church of Christ, which, in the present times, is so much im- paired. It has proved not only a personal comfort to the author, to be able to take refuge from the theolo- gical s^tations and party spirit of the age, in the haven of by gone times, when the inspiration of faith and love existed in youthful vigour; — he has not only derived a double personal benefit from these labours, in the field of primitive Christianity ; on the one Vlll PREFACE TO THE FIRST VOLUME. hand, by increasing his attachment to divine truth and its conveying medium, the Church ; and on the other, by preserving his mind from the shallowness of those who, by a pretended refinement of Christianity, eva- porate its spirit, — and from the micrological scrupulous- ness of those who cling to the letter, and fancy that the existence of Christianity is threatened by the omission of an iota ; — but he cherishes, likewise, the decided conviction, that the pangs and throes attend- ing the regeneration of the life of the Church, with which, after a long torpidity, the Present appears to be in labour, might be in some measure relieved and ac- celerated, by calling in the aid of the original Chris- tianity of the Past. Every attempt, therefore, to set clearly before the eyes of the present generation, the spirit of the church in the Ante-Nicene period, in its full vigour and freshness, if it be not an entire failure, has, in the author's opinion, an undeniable merit. It matters here but little whether the portraiture of the ancient Church be given in its totality, or only in some isolated sections : for, in order to render the delineation of the whole effective, it is necessary to individualize ; and if the point selected be one of prominent impor- tance in the development of the Church, it will serve to reflect the collective peculiarities of its formation and progress. Besides this ecclesiastical interest, a scientific motive determined the author to publish the present work, and will instigate him to lay before the world other researches, which are completed, or in progress. It is generally acknowledged that many parts of the most ancient Church history are still in- volved in obscurity ; that the ancient Church has al- ways served as a mine and stronghold for many partial PRUFACB TO THE FIRST VOLrME. IX and arbitrary opinions, and that, in particular, the re- presentations of the dogmatics of the Fathers hare been most contradictory and perplexing. This- con* fusion, in the author's opinion, can only be gnidaaliy remitved, by well digested monographs. For such a purpose, works which take in the whole extent of Church history and dogmatics, are har less serricable. For either, as, alas ! is too often the case, they are not founded on the study of the original sources, and are nothing better than a heap of superannuated prejudi- ces, or the organs of party views, or if constructed on better principles^ and the result of inrestigation among the original sources, the space allotted to individuai points of inquiry is necessarily too limited. Though error may be removed by the mere statement of truth, yet it frequently requires a direct confutation ; more especially when the object is to remove deeply rooted errors, Truth must be accompanied by its vouchers. Works of the comprehensive character to which we have alluded, even when founded on a direct appeal to the proper authorities, are necessarily somewhat su- perficial ; since it is impossible for the most perse- vering and industrious author to read all the original documents; and the multiplicity of images which history, on a large scale, presents, bewilders the great- est acuteness and circumspection, so that the observer is unable to mark and delineate all the essential features which belong to each individual portrait: Consequently, it cannot be the highest and final ob- ject of general Church- history, to depict only single columns and pillars belonging to the venerable pile ; on the contrary, he must be regarded as a master- builder in Church-history, who has the ability of pre- X PREFACE TO THE FIRST VOLUME. senting to our view, the whole Church edifice in its rise and gradual progress towards completion, in its beauty and deformity, with the strictest histori- cal accuracy. An approximation to such a master- piece, can only be made, as far as the necessary materials are prepared for it, in works devoted to special sections in the history of the Church and of dogmatics. As a preliminary contribution of this kind, the author regards the present Sketch of the life, labours, and doctrines of Justin Martyr. A further and laboured justification of the work will not, he hopes, be thought necessary. Both in an ecclesiasti- cal and dogmatic point of view, Justin merits, in the highest degree, a work specially devoted to himself, though none has yet made its appearance which is adapt- ed to the present position of scientific Protestanism. The earlier works on this Father are mostly unsatisfac- tory ; partly incomplete and superficial, partly written in such a strong spirit of Catholicism as to render even the learning and profundity displayed in them service- able only to the cause of Catholicism. The modern writings on Justin, with all their unquestionable merits, are still too fragmentary or deficient in critical accuracy. Whether the present treatise will satisfy the just de- mands of the public, competent judges must decide. All that the author ventures to affirm is, that he has prosecuted his subject as a labour of love, and has spared no pains to render it as complete as his abilities will allow. That he has, on all occasions, betaken himself to the original source of information will be at once perceived. For the rest, he relies on the can- dour of his readers, who must be aware how frequent- ly the execution of a work falls short of its conception, PREFACE TO THE FIRST TOLCME* XI and how difficult it is to answer questions in a manner completely satisfactory to other minds, where the pe- culiarities of the writer's own mind mingle uncon- sciously, or even against his wiU, with the current of his inrestigations. The author deemed it adriseable to divide the work into two parts. The first and present part contains the life of Justin, — an examination of the writings to which his name has been attached, in which his genuine productions are carefully distinguished from such as are spurious, — and a delineation of his general cha- racteristics, both as a man and an author. The second part will be deroted solely to his doctrines, in which his labours in the sereral departments of Exegesis, Apologetics, and Dogmatics, will pass under review. After the completion of the present work, the author proposes to compose a Monograph on the evangelical writings which Justin made use of under the title of tt<ffofiv7ifj,6viUfiaTa tuv airotfroXuv ; a work for which he has collected the requisite materials, and which would have been published before, if the author had not found himself obliged to discuss subjects in the pre- sent work, the results of which form a foundation for the other. But it is time to close these prefatory remarks. The author thinks it may be acceptable to his readers to give a list of the editions of the Fathers from whieh he has made his quotations. The best known and most useful editions of Justin Martyr are those of Sylbergius and Pnidentius Maranus. The numerals enclosed in brackets give the pages of the Sylburgian edition, (Paris, 1636,) and the figures which precede them denote the corresponding chapter and page of XU PREFACE TO THE FIRST VOLUME. the Benedictine (Hag. Com.^ 1742.) Both edi-, tions include the apologetic writings of Tatian, Athe- nagoras, Theophilus of Antioch, and Hermias, to which, therefore, the references of the quotations from these authors are also made. The Fragment on the Resurrection is not given hy Sylburgius, consequently the references are made only to the edition of Pru- dentius Maranus.

The delay has been partly owing to a serere illness of several months, but chiefly to his dissatisfaction with the plan that he had originally sketched ; and which at length deter- mined him to go oyer the ground once more, and to recast the work as much as possible^ in accordance with his new conceptions of the subject. One advan- tage has visibly resulted to the work from this delay, — it has enabled the author to consult the numerous publications on the history of Dogmatics, which is- sued from the press at the close of the last, and the beginning of the present year. The author, never- theless, cannot help lamenting that the work, even in its present re-modelled form, still falls far short of the ideal which filled his mind previous to its execution. Indeed, he frankly declares that he would, without hesitation, have destroyed the form of this Part a se- cond time, if he could have only entertained the hope XVI PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME. of finally approximating to his favourite ideal. Yet, in two points, he trusts that he has in some measure been successful, — in the objective form v^hich he has endeavoured to give to Justin's doctrines, and the genetic process of development, ( genetischen Ent- wickelungsweise), in reference to particular doctrines which he has endeavoured to trace out. In no de- partment has truth been more grossly injured by ec- clesiastical or personal biasses, than in that of the doc- trines of primitive Christianity ; and in none is there more danger of modelling objective history by the compulsory standard of subjective partialities. The author has, therefore, paid the greatest attention to this point, and laid it down as an inviolable law for himself, not to be in the least influenced by profes- sional or personal predilections, but to make his sketches bear the impress, (whether good or bad,) as closely as possible, of their original. His own doctri- nal convictions he has everywhere kept in the back- ground. Party-influence he has decidedly rejected and opposed: on critical questions he has not con- sciously violated, in a single instance, the principles of Philology. Nor has he been less anxious carefully to keep his representations free from rhapsodical or insignificant digressions — a fault which so easily at- taches to monographic sketches of doctrinal systems. He has endeavoured, as far as it has been practicable, always to conceive Justin's dogmatic notions, in their connection with the general dogmatic views of the ancient Church. Wherever he possessed adequate data, be has compared Justin's individual doctrines with the views of contemporary or later Church- teachers ; and has prefixed to each doctrine a general PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME. XVll description of its process of derelopment, from its rise to the condttsion of the first dogmatic period of the Church. If it be allowed that the author has not en- tirely failed in his twofold object, and that, if he has not perfectly performed his task, he has at least in some tolerable measure succeeded, he will consider this acknowledgment as an adequate reward for the many years of toil which hare been deyoted to the work, and indulges the hope that it will not be en- tirely useless to the philosophical inquirer.^ Tbebnitz, September 29, 1841. 1 This Preface, in the original work, is placed at the begin- ning of Book IV., with which the second volume commences. In the translation a different division has been adopted, in order to equalise the size of the volumes [Tb.] CONTENTS OF VOL. I. PKgC Intboductort Bemabks, • • 1 Book I — The Life of Justin Mabttb.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. Justin^ the philosopher and martyr, has always ranked among the most remarkable and distinguished Christian teachers in the first age of the Church. Even had his personal character not possessed that importance which, in the judgment of every impartial person, really be- longs to it, yet a special consequence attaches to him, from the circumstance that he makes his appearance at a time which, in more than one respect, was a cri- tical point in the developement and formation of the Christian Church, — ^that he is the most ancient Chris* tian teacher, of whom we possess any considerable written memorials, — and that in those records the ecclesiastical usages of his times are depicted in a manner that, to a certain extent, makes up for the loss of other Christian writings which are not come down to us. Justin flourished at an epoch when Christianity, af^er having been for many years mingled and associated with Judaism, asserted its independence, and began to be dreaded by Hellenism as a power by which its very existence was endangered, — when that mighty conflict between Heathenism and Chris> tianity commenced in right earnest, which was carried on for more than a century, partly by physical force, partly by the weapons of philosophy, tiU at length the passing over of the civil power to the new faith a- chieved the victory for Christianity. It was an epoch when the fellowship of Christians had acquired a more settled form ; — when the Christian communities had advanced from a state of isolation to a closer union ; and, in the provinces at least, an ecclesiastical system began to be formed; when the details of public worship B 3 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. assumed a more regular shape^ and adyanced from their originally local casualty to a more universal definite- ness: and Yfhen the Christian faith corahined itself with the elements of philosophy ; for owing to the op- position of learned heathens to Christianity^ as well as the conversion of educated Greeks or of professed philosophers, the necessity arose of moulding the simple religious faith into a theology. It was natural for Justin to sympathize deeply with all these struggles and movements : — he entered, indeed, as an essential factor into the process hy which a new order of things was forming ; and his writings are, for the greater part, almost our only guides in tracing the progress of this new creation. Hence the strong claims of Justin JVrartyr on the student of Ecclesiastical history are Eufficiently evident ; and it is somewhat strange that, among modem writers, no one has been found to make the agency of Justin Martyr the special subject of a biographical representation. We believe that, in attempting to perform this task, we are meeting a want of the present times. Of preceding writers who have either treated of the whole life and agency of Justin Martyr, or have only discussed particular points, besides the well known literary or ecclesiastical histories, the following may be mentioned as the most important : — I.

Provoked by such grovelling meanness^ Justin immediately quitted this preten4ed philosopher. But these untoward events in no degree weakened his attachment to philosophy. On the contrary, with the same confiding spirit as at first, he betook himself to the school of a Pythagorean, whose reputation for philosophic depth and refinement was not inferior to his own high self-estimation. Here, again, Justin's hopes were deceived, and the truth he sought for was still involved in darkness. The philosopher launched out into the praises of music, geometry, and astrono- my, and prescribed an acquaintance with these sciences as the indispensable preliminary of all philo- sophic inquiry, as the best means of withdrawing the earnest moral writers of that age are unanimous.

And here, indeed, hia wishes were gratified eren beyond his expectations. The conversations with the philosopher furnished his inquisitiTe mind with the richest materials ; the Platonic philosophj, and especially the doctrine of ideas, powerfully impressed him; his philosophic knowleage increased daily ; and he now befiered him- self on the TCTge of the consummating height of the Platonic philosophy, the intuition of the deity ; when a seeming accident gare an entirely di£ferent direction to his energies, and, from a contemplatiTe Platonist, changed him into a happy Christian believer.

On the other hand, Origen also taught those whom he wished to induct into philosophy, in the first place, arithmetic and geometry, (Euseb. hist, eccles. 6, T8. T.

But scarcely had he hegun to he ahsorhed in the speculation to which his thoughts were turned, when happening to look hack, he saw coming behind him, an aged man of gentle* venerable^ aspect. Surprised at this unex- pected and unwished for meeting, he stopped till the stranger came up to him, and found, on inquiry, that he had come down to the heach, to wait for some ab- sent relations, whose return he was anxiously expect- ing. Justin could not help giving an explanation of his own presence on that spot, and after stating that he had chosen that place for the purpose of speculation, he was not a little astonished, when the aged man said in reply ; pXoXoyog ovv r/g eJ cri), ^sXs^hi de ohbafiuti ouds ^/XaX^^Tjg ; ohbs ^ei^qi ^^axTixbg sTvai fiaKkov ^ (To- ^itfr^g ; \" You are then a lover of discourse, but no lover of deeds, nor of truth, nor do you attempt to be a man of action, so much as a clever disputant V** — To 1 Halloix {Fit. et document, Juatin, p. 17* and 286,)— is doubtful, whether this aged person might not be an incarnate angel, but at last decides in favour of the opinion, that he might be one of the saints living at that time, who was brought to this interview with Justin, by a divine impulse, or rather by the actual guidance of an angel.

HIS COMYERSION TO CHRI8TIAKITY. 13 this unjust and unfair judgment, (as it appeared t him,) passed on his philosophical studies, Justin re- plied, that, in his opinion, no employment could be more worthy and urgent, than to make it manifest, that intelligence was the presiding principle of all things, and by means of this intelligence, to discern the erroneous, and the undirine, in all other pursuits. Without philosophy there could be no clear under- standing, or prudence. Philosophical knowledge, ought, therefore, to be an object of unirersal atten- tion ;^ all other pursuits should retire into the back- ground before it, — or be altogether renounced, if they could not be brought into connection with philosophy. After this enthusiastic eulogium on philosophy, the aged man inquired, whether philosophy led to happi- ness, and what was the proper definition of philosophy; he was told that ^* Philosophy was the science of being, and the knowledge of truth, — but that happiness was the reward of this knowledge and wisdom.\" He then endeavoured to conyince this eloquent advocate, that philosophy, as long as it depended purely on its own resources, was utterly incapable of solving such a prob- lem. For a knowledge of God, who is the highest object of all, and especially of Platonic speculation, could not be acquired by an empirical method, or by discursive contemplation, like the knowledge of Music, Arithmetic and Astronomy, or an acquaintance with the healing art and military tactics. Only that know- Compare K5pke de sicUu ei eondiiione chrisHanorum iuh tm- peraioribtu Romanis aUernu post Christum seeuH (Berol. 1828) p.

But to such an origin, philosophy in all its extent could make no pretensions. For when the Platonic philosophy asserted, that a power resided in the human reason, (vovg) to rise to this vision of God^ the assertion was a mere postulate without any foundation. Reason might certainly ascertain hy itself, the reality of the divine existence, and moral principles, — hut could not hehold the essence of God. If the latter were the case, a vision of the divine essence would be possible for the souls of beasts, since these, according to their measure, are not specifically different from human souls. Besides, this postulate of the Platonic philosophy would be overturned by another maxim of the same philosophy, that not every man, but only the righteous and the pure, can attain to the actual vision of God ; for, according to this, the actual attainment of this vision, would depend, not on the intellectual power inherent to man by nature, but on his moral capabi- lity. But as to beasts, this subterfuge in reference to moral considerations, fkils at once. For it cannot be asserted of them, that they are unrighteous. But if their corporeal organization be available as a ground of hindrance, that they cannot attain to a vision of God, it becomes a question, whether, if they had the power of speech, they might not with greater justice, depreciate human bodies, rather than men theirs.^ Afler the aged man, by this line of argument, had ' No sooner had the ac^ed man forced Justin to acknowledge the incapability of haman reason to behold God in and by it> self, than he also set before him the unimportance of such a beholding. For, since it was the express doctrine of the Pla- tonic system, that the soul no more remembers these visions of the deity, as soon as it enters into another human body, after the preceding release from its body ; it would be a matter of perfect indifference to the individual, whether a vision of God had ever been imparted to him or not; in the one case it would be no distinction, and iii the other no loss.

In reference to the former, he directed his attention to the complete uselessness of the doctrine. Since it maintained, that the souls doomed to inhabit the bodies of beasts, had neither the consciousness of their former aberrations^' nor a sense of their degradation in the present state, — the doctrine was divested of the only consideration which could give it any colour of probability, that, namely, of moral retribution. But the Platonic doctrine of the immortality of the soul, so far was open to censure, that it Tie wed this immortality as absolute, and neces* sarily founded in the essential constitution of the soul. That originati<m in time, which the soul shared in connexion with the world, rather involved the possi- bility of its destruction. Yet it could not really be affirmed, that it would ever be destroyed ; on the con- trary, it endures, (in order to realize the idea of retribution), not only from its own nature, but through the will and power of him, who gave it existence. These statements and reasonings of the eloquent old man, failed not to make a due impression on a mind so susceptible and open to conviction as Justin's. The unwavering confidence which he had hitherto placed in the correctness of the Platonic theorem was shak- en, and he broke out into the bitter exclamation, — rm ovv in ri; ^pritraiTO dida(fxdX(f) ij ^^S¥ di^s\\r)^uri \"f, Si fifids ev rovToti rh aX»j^sg sar/v ; — \" On what teacher can we rely, or to what quarter can we look for aid, if these are not the doctrines that contain the Truth ?'* — Dial. c.

The ancient pillars of philoso- phical science hitherto deemed immoveahle, were shat- tered^ and the confidence they had inspired was sue- ceeded by a yearning after some substitute: a con- sciousness of the insecurity and uncertainty of all mere human investigation was awakened, and gave rise to anxiety for new and satisfactory instruction. Happily, the venerable man knew how to turn to good account these feelings of the perplexed philosopher. He in- dicated to him by brief hints, that if he would only apply to the right source, he might easily find the Truth which he had hitherto longed for so intensely, but had sought in vain among the Hellenic philosophers. He stated, that, in remote ages, there had appeared men, called Prophets, distinguished above all the phi- losophers by their antiquity and sanctity, and accredit- ed by miracles and prophecies, as organs of the divine Spirit, in whose extant writings were deposited the choicest treasures of infallible religious truth. If he turned to these records^ in them he would find the amplest information respecting the first principles and design of all things, — the most satisfactory explanation on {Ul the points which it behoved a philosopher to know. Having thus spoken, the stranger went his way, and Justin saw him no more. But his words had kindled a flame in Justin's heart which nothing could extinguish. He attentively revolved the infor- mation he had received : he seized with eagerness the writings of the Prophets : he anxiously sought the ac- quaintance of those persons who were known by him to be the friends of Christ : and the result of this three- fold effort was his passing over to the Christian Church.^ The quickness with which this transition was made, ^ It is worthy of notice, that the study of the Old Testa- ment, and especially of the Prophets, was the means of leading to the Christian faith, Tatian, {Orai. c.

This illusion once broken up^ the last ties were snapt asunder which had hitherto kept him from joining the Christian com« munity.

The intrepidity and cheerfulness with which Christians maintained their fidth under all the tortures which the rage and cruelty of their heathen adversaries were ready to inflict upon them ; the ready determination with which they met death itself for their profession, had impressed him with the conviction that it could not consist with the secret vices and crimes of which the Christians were accused — since sensual indulgence, and joy in the prospect of death, form the most direct Antipodes — xaiya^avrhg tycit roT; JlXdrum^ ^a/^uviiddyfjMtrif d/a^a>.- xai iravra ra aXXa wfii^ofisva ^o^t^dy g¥t¥6ou¥ ddvtarw ilvat sv xax/q^ xai ^/X«}doy/(f v^d^^tiv avrovg.

A voluptuary — a man without self-control — one who could reckon it a luxury to feed on human flesh — how could such a man embrace death, which would deprive him of his indul- gences: would he not rather attempt, by every means, to prolong his existence in this world, and avoid fall- ing into the hands of the magistrate ? Least of all, c 18 BIS CONTERSION TO CERISTIANITT* would he by self-impeadimeiit, expose himself to capi- tal punishment.'' But after diis sentiment had once taken root in Justin's mind, it needed in fact, only a confirmed scepticism in Ihe sufficiency of die philoso- phic doctrines of the Greeks, and the conyiction^ that Christians^ in reference to religious knowledge, were at least, not behind the Greeks, to destroy the laist bul- wark of heathenism which still reniahied in his breast ; and, thus, it may be Tny naturally ezplaiHed, how Jtistin's accidental conyersation with the aged stranger produced the astonishing effect of converting tke en- thusiastic iriend and adyocate of the Platonic plnloso- phy, as if by magic, into the e^ally decided friend and advocate of the Christian doctrine.^ But in modem times* this whole narrative of Jus- tin respecting the means of bis conversion to Chris- tianity, has been treated as a mere fictioii, which was simply designed to give interest and point to his apo- logy. But this supposition is itself nothing more than an arbitrazy fiction ; for we cannot conceive on what grounds this historical credibility of this namitive can be rejected.^ It has no internal marks whatever of unlikelihood^ and finds an outward support in several analogous events of that period. Justin was far from being the only individual of his times, who found the truth in Christ after manifeld wanderings in the laby- rinth of a barren speculation.

In answer to the question proposed by the Piiefect before whom he was brought to trial, 'jromg \\6yovg fisra^e/^i^sig ; \" what set of doctrines have you been conversant with ?** — Jus- that the '' Acts** of Justin Martyr did not proceed from Si- meon, but might have been an apocryphal production, since their fabrication might have occurred in the earliest ages of Christian antiquity, has not much in its behalf. For if the \" Martyr's Acts\" were the apocryphal production of a mis- taken Christian bias, such a bins must have in some way or other shown itself. But throughout no other Mhs is apparent than that of historical truth. The narrative is, from beginning to end, simple and unadorned, free from all legendary garnish- ing with miracles, from all artificial glorification of its princi- pal subject. The questions and answers which the narrative puts in the mouth of the Roman Prefect, and of the Martyrs, have such an air of naturalness and internal truth, as would be hardly possible in a mere fiction. The ecclesiastical allu- sions, more especially those belonging to public worship, bear the impress of a time when the Christian Church, considered as a social religious institution, was still destitute of a fixed basis and of a definite organic form, and this imperfect state is the acknowledged character of the second century.

This inquiry may at first sight appear rather an idle one, hut it is not without its importance. Many learned men are of opinion that' Justin first heeame intimately acquainted with Christianity at his birth place, Flayia Neapolis, and connect consequences 'with this supposition, which are not without further influ- ence. By this means Credner would explain Justin's supposed leaning to the tone f^ thinking preyalent among the heretical Jewish Christians. Btroth would make use of it to support his hypothesis, that the Acts of the Apostles made use of by Justin was no other than the Apocryphal Gospel of the Hebrews.^ Ret- tig would derive from it an argument for eombating the genuineness of the New Testament Ap©calypse.* Were we to enquire what, from an a priori considera- tion of the question, would appear most jHrobahle, we should be led least of all to fix on Flavia Neapolis. We cannot suppose that in a city so inconsiderable, all the philosophical schools which Justin visited in succes- sion, eoukt have established themselves. This state of the ease would, therefore, confirm the supposition that Justin, soon after the need of settled religious convictions had been awakened in his mind, left his of an apoerypbal narrative of Juiitin's death ; it appears there>- fore wholly inadmissible to indulge any further doubts on the authentieity and originality of the martyrologry.

This supposition is fayoured bj the customs prera- lent among educated persons in the heathen world, which rendered it incumbent on all who belonged to the higher circles of society, to risit the most re- nowned foreign institutions, and particularly philoso- phical schools. And what an ^ priori riew of the case would render most probable is confirmed and establish- ed by Justin*s own testimony. His own words, which haye been already quoted, ^^ For I myself, when an adherent of the Platonic school,\" &c. (p. 17). suffi- ciently indicate that, at that time, when he still adher- ed to the Platonic school, he was absent from his na- tiye land. For, during Hie reign of the Emperor Ha- drian, Palestine could hardly afford him an opportu- nity to conyince himself of the morel integrity of Christians, in opposition to the calumnies which the popular hatred of the heathens heaped upon them, by means of personally beholding the intrepidity and cheerfulness yrith which they met death. In Greece and Lesser Asia^ it is true, but not in Palestine, bloody persecution of the Christians, on the part of the hea- then, occurred in Hadrian's time. But a passage in the Dialogue with Trypho testifies still more than this indirect eyidence, that Justin's conyersion took place beyond the bounds of Palestine.

For if the phrase rrj Tj/t^sr^cf voXsi^ &c. refer- red to Justin's native place, Justin would not have spoken of himself in the singular (ttwdtsT^i^ov — flr|ogxo- -Trov) or in case he wished to have used exactly this ^^™' ^? must have also said fMtu rfj voXn instead of rp ^/i3TSP(f woXsi, But the farther notice which Jus- tin gives in a subsequent passage that the aged Chris- tian met with him during his solitary walk near the sea (ov fiax^av ^aXd(fffr)g) does not suit Flavia Neapolis. This town was situated, not near any water, but al- most five miles from the Mediterranean Sea. Should any one attempt, with Rettig, to obviate this difficulty, by the supposition that Justin did not mean a literal ■walking on the sea-shore when he met with the aged Christian, but rather had a view to the love of specu- lation — a longer sojourn in the quietness of a solitary shore ; he would have the clear sense of the passage in the Dialogue against him, and do violence to the text. The words are the following, — xai .aoD oUrw; dtaxti/ihouy s^ii iho^i 'jTOTi 'rroXKrig r^^ifj^iai ifKp^rl^nvai xai rhv tuv av^^ut'irm aXsiTvai vdrov, im^ivo/iniv sig ri xoi^iov^ oh fia- xoav ^aXdffffTjg, ^Xjjtf/oy dk fiov ysvofiivov sxsivov rov ro^ow, h^a SfieXXov dtptxofisvog 'zphg ifiavrf gtfgffSow, waXatog rig croeapsvriig hXiyov airohiOiv fj^ov^ flra- §ei<TSTo, *' Such being my state of mind since I was disposed to indulge in much solitude, and to shun the footsteps of men, I went into a certain district, not far from the sea, and when I was getting near the place where I expected to be alone, an ancient man fol- lowed me at a little distance.\"— Dial. c.

JUSTIN'S LABOURS IN THE CAUSE OF CHRISTIANITY. The new faith, to which, in so natural, and jet so wonderful a manner, the philosopher had heen led, from this moment hecame the mainspring and centre point of all his efforts. To building up the Christian Church, both inwardly and outwardly, his life was henceforward dedicated. It was his desire, that the light which had risen on his own mind, should shine also on others ; that the repose and peace which he had foimd, might also make others happy.* Justin considered himself laid under a religious obligation to devote himself to the immediate, incessant propagation of the gospel. He expressly declares,' that \" every one who is able to speak the truth, and does not speak it, will be condemned by God.\" After quoting Ezek. iii. 17 — 19, he adds \" Therefore we being moved by fear, we apply ourselves to address ^men,j according to the Scriptures, not actuated by the love of gain, or of reputation, or of pleasure ; for, of these motives, no * In accordance with this result* Bretsclineider says, (Pro- habilia de evangelii ei epistolarum Joanne* ApotL indole et origine.

That Justin as a Chrisdan, chose for himself the calling of an itineiant oTangelist, may be explained, partly from his natuial tnm of mind, which found sa- tis&ction im a personal acquaintance with interest- ing localities and memorials — partly from the ob* stacles of the times, which rendered it almost impos- nble to gain an intimate acqoaintance with the affairs of the church, excepting by personal risits to indiri- dual religioas communities—- and lastly, another rea- son might be, that Justin beliered he could thus* in accordance with his own mental peculiarities, most adyantageoQsly propagate that Gospel which he had reeeiyed and h^ with such great enthusiasm.

Prudentius Maranus (Prolegomena, 3, 2, 1. p. UviiL) and Lumper (De vita acriptU atgue tlodrma, t. » ptUrum, t. I. p. 55) have made Justin an ordained Presbyter. Compare also, Mdhler Patrologie I. s. 191. Prudeotius Maranus speaks of him also, as leading at the same time the life of an Ascetic. 28 Justin's labours in other incalculable and essential advantage. His Chris- tian conviction, which had marked out for him this line of life, developed itself most distinctly under per- secution, and gained its full power in overcoming martyrdom ana death. Justin, in his travels, neces- sarily became acquainted with all the varied forms in which the Christian life expressed itself, in the diffe- rent situations and offices of society ; he thus gained the experience, that the Gospel is everywhere another and yet the same; that admitting of the greatest mani- foldness and difference in the factors under which the life in Christ presents itself, the products in all essen- tial points, are everywhere equal. As he beheld Chris- tianity embodied in individual instances, he learned how deeply founded in its essential nature were its claims to universality,^ and this perception could not fail to kindle in his heart, the same enthusiasm with which the unknown author of the Epistle to Diognetus has presented this aspect of the Christian life with so much sober truth, and yet with so much eloquence. But in this enthusiasm, the wish must have found the strongest aliment, to assist according to his ability to promote this universal tendency of Christianity. And for the correctness of the opinion, that the information which Justin gives respecting the Life of the Church and its efforts during his time, possesses not merely local, but universal truth, we have a certain pledge in that constant change of residence which his vocation involved. Justin visited one after another, the most eonsiderable societies which then existed in the Chris- ^ This aspect of the new Institution would indeed be least dearly discerned by the heathen opponents of Christianity. Celsus held it to be unreasonable to suppose that all the nations of Asia, Europe, and Lybia, Greeks and barbarians, could be united to the end of the world, under one faith. Orioen, c.

Justin visited Egypt, and heheld in the Isle of Pha- ros^ near Alexandna^ the remains of the cells in which the Seventy Interpreters, according to the sacred legend, separately translated into Greeks the hooks of the Old Testament, and yet^ with a literal agreement ;^ at Ephe* sus, he met with Trypho the Jew,' and entered into that conversation on religion with him, the substance' of which^ though modifi^ here and there^ is contained in the dial<^e now extant.

THE CAUSB OP CHRISTIANITY. 31 writings are k>8t ; yet the meiBeriak «f k slitt in ex- istence are sufficient to prore its importance* In oon- famity to the kitemal stages of deTslopement on which the Christian Church stood in the first half of the second centnrj, and not less in conformity to its outward position, Justins agency concentrated itself chiefly in opposition to error. Yet the titles that are still left of some of his lost writings, show us that he did not neglect the promotion of the Christian cause by the positive representation and deyelopement of Quristian doctrine ; and, according to the account of the ancient Martyrology,^ he opened a school at Rome, in which he instructed in the saving truths of Christianity all who were led to htm by a sense of their moral necessities ; bat the most prominent fea- ture of his agency was the polemical and apologeti- cal. A three- fold opposition claimed the attention of Justin. Considered in relation to its origin, Judaism^ from whose bosom Christianity proceeded, and under whose name it might have gained a footing* in the heathen wcffld, without exciting any violent opposi- tion—presented itself to Justin as the nearest object of controversy. The reaction which Judaism had from the first maintained against Christianity, was in Justin's days more fierce and bitter than ever. The daily encreasing spread of the Christian faith kept alive the Jewish enmity; the political oppression mi- der which, especially since the destruction of Jerusa- lem, the Jews groaned, contributed to render this enmity nMure intense. They gave vent to their feel^ ings by regular imprecations on the Christians in their synagogues,' and showed the greatest zeal in propa> 1 Tertall. ap^og. e. 21, T.

But with greater zeal than against Judaism, Justin, from the circumstances in which he was placed, was excited to vigorous opposition to Heathenism.
