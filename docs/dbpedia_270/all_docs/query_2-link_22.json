Digitized by Google MA Digitized by Google ^ PREFACE. Sir Charles Newton, in the course of his admirable articles on Greek inscriptions*, remarks that \"what is now wanted is a popular work, giving a classification of Greek inscriptions according to their age, country, and subject, and a selection of texts by way of samples, under each class.\" The present work represents an attempt to supply the need indicated by the words which I have quoted. The scope of the book will be best understood if it be described as an Introduction or Hand- book to a Corpus Inscriptionvmi Oraecarum, imagined, if that were possible, to be complete at the time of publication. But completeness is quite beyond reach in the present condition of epigraphical science and epigraphical discovery. If all ex- ploration and research on ancient classical sites were to be stopped for a period of years, it might be possible indeed to issue a Corpus, which should contain all extant known Greek inscriptions ; but on the day which maiked the resumption of exploration a supplementary volume would be needed. Such a supplementary volume had in the first instance been contemplated by August Boeckh, the original editor of the Corpus Inscriptionum Qraecarwm\\ but so vast have been the additions to the number of Greek inscriptions since Boeckh's first volume was published in 1828, that the scholars who suc- ceeded to his task abandoned the idea of completing Boeckh's work in the sense originally intended ; the 'supplement' would in fact have exceeded in bulk the work to which it was to form an adjunct. This and other considerations led the Academy of Berlin to undertake the gigantic enterprise of ' Exsays on Art and Archaeology^ by C. T. Newton. London, 1880. R. b Digitized by Google viii PREFACE. publishing a new Gmyus, of which the three volumes of the Corpus Inscriptionum Atticarum may be regarded as a first instalment. A few instances may suflSce to demonstrate the difficulty of keeping pace with the activity of discovery and excavation. The opening pages (1 â€” 60) of Boeckh's Corpus contain forty- three inscriptions, which, in violation of the otherwise strictly geographical classification, are placed first as Tituli antiquissima scripturae forma insigniores. These, which we may provision- ally group under the 'archaic' section, had in 1882 (so far aa concerns the inscriptions not found in Attica) expanded into the six hundred or more inscriptions collected in H. Roehl's Inscrip- Hones Graecae antiquissimae praeter Atticas in Attica repertas. No sooner had that work appeared than news came of the most extensive epigraphical discovery ever made, that of the immense twelve-column long inscription found at Gortyn in Crete. And a few months ago, when the first sheets of the present work had all but undergone final revision, the discovery of yet older Cretan inscriptions necessitated the rewriting of the whole Cretan section*. Again, since the appearance of Boeckh's first volume, the Attic inscriptions, numbering in the Corpus about 1000, have grown into the 5000 and upwards of the Corpus Inscriptionum Atticarum, with probably hundreds of others scattered in various periodicals. The present volume, or Part I, containing the 'archaic* in- scriptions, corresponds to the section in the Corpus Inscriptio- num Oraecarum which is devoted to the Tituli antiquissima scrip- turae forma insigniores. An apology is perhaps due for the use of the word 'archaic*; the term is applied conveniently, albeit 1 Every effort has been made to keep au courant with the periodical literature, but some of the more recent epigraphical information could find a place only in the Addenda and Addenda nova. While the last sheets are being printed off, I read in the latest namber of the Wiener Studien (1887, p. 223 sqq.) A. Bauer's opinion that neither the Delphian tripod with intertwined serpents (no. 269) nor the memorial at Olympia (see p. 260) was intended to com- memorate especially the battle of Plataeae. He contends that Pausanias (v. 28. If X. 18. 9) was the first to refer it to Plataeae : the other writers quoted by Boehl (IGA 70) represent both as memorials erected by the Greeks generally who fought against the Persians, and especially by those whose names appear on them, and who must have been contributors to the expense of erecting them. I Digitized by Google PREFACE, ix somewhat arbitrarily, to inscriptions before about 400 B.C., and inscriptions written in the non-Ionic alphabet, which in the vast majority of cases will be found to be anterior to 403 B.C., when the Ionic alphabet was formally adopted in public docu- ments at Athens. For the proper understanding of these in- scriptions a knowledge of the history and changes of the Greek alphabet is indispensable. The plan has been adopted of ap- pending to each group of inscriptions, arranged geographically, an account of the alphabet used from the earliest times in the locality from which they come. In every case the inscriptions in the original character are followed by a minuscule transcript, and where it appeared necessary, notes or short commentaries on the subject-matter have been subjoined ; but in some instances, in order to avoid overloading the text, the commentary has been relegated to the Appendix. Wherever it seemed ad- visable, and wherever it was impossible approximately to represent the peculiarities of the original characters by other means, recourse has been had to reduced facsimile reproduc- tions, obtained, it is hoped, from the best available sources. Where however the letters suflBciently conformed to well marked types, characteristic of periods or localities, the ori- ginals have been given in the text with approximate accuracy by means of special founts cast for the purpose. The student will therefore carefully distinguish between actual facsimiles and type-copies, and will not draw inferences from an inspec- tion of the latter which would be justified only by an exami- nation of the former, or, it may be, only by access to the original documents themselves. It is intended that the arrangement adopted in Part II shall be in the main geographical, with subordinate divisions determined by chronology and subject-matter. An attempt will be made to give a selection of representative inscriptions from the most diverse localities of the Hellenic world. The choice will be guided by consideration of subject, dialect, and period. The inscriptions in Part II will naturally for the most part be drawn from the period beginning with the fourth century B.C. and reâ‚¬tching to the latest times ; but many im- portant inscriptions will be found which date from the 'archaic' 52 Digitized by Google X PREFACE. period, b\\it which, as not being especially needed to illustrate the development of the Greek alphabet, are not included in Part I. The texts in Part II will be printed only in minus- cule; but care will be taken to indicate the period in the ' history of the alphabet to which they severally belong. The present volume contains, without counting coin- legends, about 500 * inscriptions, nearly all of which are adduced with the object of illustrating the gradual development of the Greek alphabet. In the transcription the restored portions are de- noted not only by enclosure within square brackets, but also by the use of a different type. A letter, of which traces re- main in the original, is included in the square brackets, but printed in ordinary type*. A superfluous letter is denoted by angular brackets. A letter which is needed for the transcrip- tion but not intended to be present in the original, appears within curved brackets. The most important authorities and sources of information have in general been cited at the head of the inscriptions : in the case of some inscriptions which have been often published it has been deemed better, regard being had to limits of space, to refer to more exhaustive lists in the Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum or other similar works. Of all authorities however the one to whom my debt is greatest â€” das verstekt sick von selhst â€” is Professor A. Kirchhoff, whose Studieii zur Geschichte des griechischen Alphabets no writer on the earlier Greek in- scriptions can dispense with, and from whose conclusions no student of epigraphy can lightly dissent. It is therefore with considerable hesitation that I feel myself compelled at present to maintain an attitude of suspense in the controversy, to which Prof. Kirchhoff has devoted three pages in the fourth I edition of his Studien*, concerning the claims of the Abou- 1 The actual numeration runs from 1 to 811, but frequently two or more inscriptions are included under one number. ' Occasionally where there was no doubt whatever about the reading but where owing to fracture of the stone or other cause individual letters or a series of letters are imperfect, the device has been adopted of a line of dots beneath the letters ; see, e.g., nos. 183, 147. > This edition fortunately appeared just in time to enable me to correct the references to the Shtdien throughout the work and to modify parts of it in Digitized by Google PREFACE, xi Symbel inscriptions to be the oldest specimens in existence of the Ionic alphabet*. However the question may be decided, it furnishes an example of those numerous diflSculties, which give force to Kirchhoflf's observation, repeated in this fourth and last edition, that the time has not yet come to write a 'history' of the Greek alphabet, though the discoveries of the last ten years appear to have brought us appreciably nearer to the desired end. An editor, who offers to students of Greek epigraphy a volume of ' Selections,' ipso facto invites a comparison between his work and other recent essays in the same field. I am fully aware that if I follow in the steps of such well-tried and experienced scholars as P. Cauer, W. Dittenberger, and E. L. Hicks, I cannot aspire to rank after them unless it be longo intervallo. But the scheme of the present volume, as de- scribed above, is entirely different from that of any which have preceded it, and on this ground alone it may perhaps prove to be no less useful to the student of Greek epigraphy in general than are the works of the three scholars named for the study of a special department. The 'Delectus' of P. Cauer deals with inscriptions from the point of view of dialect alone; the 'Sylloge' of W. Dittenberger treats of inscriptions which illustrate Hellenic political and social life ; the ' Manual ' of R L. Hicks contains those inscriptions only which are of im- portance for historical research. And in speaking of Selec- tions, no English student can without ingratitude omit a reference to the work of Hugh James Rose, whose volume en- titled Inscriptiones Graecae vettcstissimae appeared some three years before the first volume of the Corpus was published ; and again no student of epigraphy can forget that the Elenienta Epigraphices Chraecae of J. Franz, published in 1839, was the accordance with Kirchhoff's changed views or newly obtained information. |\\ Another important work which I was similarly able to use for the earliest sheets wasB. V. Head's Historia Numorum. ' See the article on the Early Ionic Alphabet, in the Journal of Hellenic Studies^ vn. 220 sqq., by E. A. Gardner; Kirchhoff, Studien, rfc, Ed. 4,44sqq. ; the article by G. Hirschfeld on Naukratis in the Kheinisches Museum^ xlii. 200 sqq., and letters in the Academy, by E. A. Gardner, G. Hirschfuld and W. M. F. Petrie, 1887, May 14, July 9 and 10, Aug. 20 and 27. Digitized by Google xii PREFACE, only text-book in use for nearly half a century. It contained on the one hand a selection of inscriptions taken mainly from the first two volumes of the Corpus and on the other a mass of information touching the history, the forms, and the pecu- liarities of Greek inscriptions, the compilation of which argued such a breadth of learning and grasp of the subject on the part of the author that, when copies of the work became rare, scholars shrank from the responsibility of undertaking a new edition*, A ready welcome therefore awaited the recently published TraiU de tipigraphie grecque of Mons. S. Reinach, who has very wisely decided that selections of inscriptions may best be left to separate treatises, and has confined himself to the task of making a really useful work of reference, dealing with all aspects of Greek epigraphy. Lastly, the concise and valuable summary forming the section Griechische Epigraphik, in I. MUller's Handhuch der klassiachen Alterthumswissen^chaft, may help us to estimate the great loss which epigraphieal science has sustained in the untimely death of its author, Gustav Hinrichs. My acknowledgments to fellow-students, pupils, and other friends, who have ungrudgingly lent me their aid in the pre- paration of this work, are too numerous to detail. But in particular I owe a deep debt of gratitude to Professor W. Ridgeway, whose vigorous criticism of the earlier proof sheets was invaluable; and to Mr K A. Gardner, who not only under- ^ For the more detailed bibliography, whether as concerns * collections ' or ' selections* of Greek insenplions, the reader is referred to the Corpus Inscrip- tionum graeearum^ pp. viii. sqq., Westermann, art.

The information which led me ** as in private duty bound \" to commemorate on the dedicatory page one of the earliest masters in epigraphieal lore is found in the following extract from the Liber Matriculationis of GonviUe and Caius College, bearing date 1577: Johannes Oruter filius Gualter civis et mercatoris Antverpiensis natus Antverpie in Brabantia educatus in Norwico sub doctore Matthias adolescens anno 19 in nostrum collegium admissus est pensionaritis minor ordinis primi litterarum gratid 11 Junii 1677.

In oflfering my sincere thanks to the Syndics of the Uni- versity Press for the trust they placed in ray hands some years ago, I cannot but feel that they would never have done so if they had foreseen the delays and hindrances to publication which were destined inevitably to result from my continuous and heavy oflScial duties. Lastly I have to thank the authorities of the University Press for their courtesy and readiness in overcoming the numerous typographical diflBculties which from time to time presented themselves, and for the accuracy, beyond all praise, with which their readers detected and eliminated the minutest errors. While I venture to anticipate that this Introduction to Greek Epigraphy will be a real help to an increasing number of students both in this country and in America, I do not look forward without some misgiving to the searching, but I trust kindly, criticism which the work is likely to encounter. That its imperfections are neither few nor slight no one can be more conscious than the author himself. E. S. ROBERTS. GONYILLE AND CaTOS GoLLEOE, GaMBRIOOE, Septeiiiber, 1887.

The first part of the undertaking is the more complex; the student must thread the maze of ramifications from one mother-alphabet down to the date when all other varieties gave place to that with , which we are most familiar, the alphabet first adopted by the lonians of Asia Minor. This date is marked at least in Athens by the archonship of Euclides, b.c. 403, when, according to Theopompus*, by a decree of Archinus it was ordained that in future all public acts should be written in the Ionic characters, which indeed had been in literary and private use in Attica*, and also in public use elsewhere', for some time previously. From this point onwards the task becomes simpler, and consists merely in registering unimportant changes in a universally spread Hellenic alphabet, instead of having to deal with essentially different divisions or perplexing local variar tions. The importance to the student of Greek epigraphy of an accurate acquaintance with the history of the Greek alphabet can hardly be overrated. Not only may the occurrence of a single form in an inscription suffice to determine the place of origin of the docu- ment*, but the appearance or disappearance of a given form or group of forms may serve to limit the date actually or approximately to a period of years*. ^ Theopomp. ap.

It is plain that the data for the history of the Greek alphabet must be based upon either (i) Tradition or (ii) the Inscriptional records themselves. (i) Tradition, except on one point, proves upon closer exami- nation to be altogether inadmissible as evidence, not only because in most cases it depends upon the statements of later grammarians, whose relation to their sources of information we are no longer in a position to check, but also because their statements on the one hand bear a decidedly mythical stamp and on the other hand are found to be almost irreconcilably inconsistent with the evidence of contemporary inscriptions. When, for instance, tradition makes Simonides of Ceos inventor of the signs for 17 and w, monuments prove the existence of these forms at least a generation before the poet was bom*. When tradition ascribes to Epicharmus the inven- tion of ^ and ^, monimients again show that these characters were in use at Miletus at a date nearly half a century before the reputed year of Epicharmus' birth. It has indeed been suggested that the poems of Simonides may have helped to familiarise the Athenians with these new letters and that the attribution of 'invention' to an Epicharmus or a Simonides is only one of the not uncommon instances where the name of ' inventor ' has been given to those who only popularised what was known before. Tradition however sup- plies one real historical fact, that the Greek alphabet is derived from the Phoenician ; but even this statement could not have been accepted without proof; and here too it is the knowledge of the Phoenician alphabet itself and not tradition which has made and can alone make the fact certain. (ii) Tradition then must be treated as though it did not exist ; and the investigation must be based upon the evidence, not indeed always sufficient, but throughout admissible, of Inscriptional records. But of these last those belonging to the periods anterior to the end of the Peloponnesian war will principally occupy our attention. For with the general adoption of the Ionic variety, which more completely than the rest represents the Greek sound-system, the history of the Greek alphabet is practically concluded and the sub- sequent modifications and changes may be summed up in a few words. ^ Of. the remarks on the o-sounds, Â§ 5 infra.

They wlU be fonnd discussed by Franz, EUm, epigr, Oraec, Chap. in. and by Lenormant in Darem- berg and Saglio's Dictionnaire Art. Alphabet , where copious references to authori- ties are given. The legends variously relate : (1) that the Phoenician writing was introduced into Greece by the colony of Cadmus (hence the terms * ^wpur/iui ypAfifMTa* Hesych., cf. Hdt. v. 68 and infr. 142 b 37 * Kai/Ai}ia yp6fifiara^ RAi, V. 59 ; ' iK<pom^^ Hesych.) ; this is the account which finds most favour with Greek writers; (2) that the Greek alphabet was invented by Prometheus, by Orpheus, by Musaeus, or by Linus; (8) that Palamedes was the inventor; several monuments of art prove the high antiquity of this view (Ch. Lenorm. and De Witte, Elite des monuments eSramographtqueSf Vol. i. p. 258); other accounts make Palamedes only the adapter of the Phoenician letters to Greek usage, and state that he added four new letters (, 0, v, ^; (4) that Epicharmus invented { and f , and (5) Simonides rf and a> (see above, p. 2). Â§ 3. Geographical and chronological division of the subject. We proceed now to give a comprehensive sketch. This will be in fact a summary of the results arrived at by the detailed ex- amination of the individual varieties of alphabet spread over the Hellenic world prior to a date which we may fix provisionally at B.C. 403. The periods which ended and began with this date we shall frequently find it convenient to denote as pre-Euclidean and post-Euclidean respectively. The reader is recommended to bear in mind that the statements in this anticipatory sketch are justified only so far as they can one and all be proved or reasonably inferred from the series of inscriptions adduced to exemplify the phases of the alphabet in successive periods and different localities. It will be I sought in the course of the investigation to establish the following ^ facts, a statement of which thus early will conduce to a readier j appreciation of the exposition : these facts are (i) the existence in the } * pre-Euclidean' period of two well-marked divisions of the alphabet, ' conveniently termed the Eastebn and the Western group, inter- secting each other in Hellas proper, and separated from each other . by specific peculiarities; (ii) a subordinate division of the Eastern group into the alphabets in use-, (a) in the Islands of the Aegean Sea, (b) at a few spots on the mainland of Hellas, (c) in the coast-towns of Asia Minor : the Western group comprising the alphabets spread over the mainland of Hellas generally, together with Euboea ; (iii) the existence of what is called the 'Ionian alphabet' (a branch of the Eastern group) in full development as early as B.a 453, as it . appears in (e.g.) an inscription from Halicamassus (no. 145) ascer- tained to be not later than that date ; (iv) the official adoption of 1â€”2 Digitized by Google 4 OREEK EPIORAPHY. PART L Â§ 3 this alphabet in public dociiments at Athens in the year rc. 403, in the archonship of Euclides ; (v) its subsequent extension through the whole of the Hellenic world over which it prevailed with un- essential modifications down to the latest periods. The diyision of the alphabets here adopted is that of Kirohhoff. The princi- pal classifications attempted by other scholars are those of Franz (Elem, Ep. Or.), Mommsen {Unterital. DiaUcten), and Lenormant (Dar. and Sagl., Art. Alphabet). Franz distinguishes three Greek alphabets : (1) the AeolO'Doriarif consisting of 25 letters, (2) the Attic, consisting of 21 letters, (3) the lofde, consisting of 24 letters. Against the vague use of the term * Dorian' and the conception of a * Dorian' alphabet Eirchhoff {Stud.* 122) enters a protest. See farther Â§ 86 below, on the Chalcidian and other vase-inscriptions. Mommsen (whose classification is essentially chronological) admits the exist- ence in Greece of only two successive alphabets : (1) a primitive alphabet of 23 letters, represented by the inscriptions of Thera ; of this according to his view the Ionic and Attic alphabets of Franz are merely varieties ; (2) a later or secondary alphabet of 26 letters, which he subdivides into two principal varieties, (a) the Corcyrean, (b) the Dorico-Chalcidian alphabet. To these he joins two other varieties, the Argive and the Eleo-Arcadian, which he considers as the product of the combination of the second alphabetic system with the first. Lenormant adheres essentially to the division of Franz, which he modifies by classifying as follows: (1) the Aeolo-Dorian alphabet, to which belong two secondary and distinct sub-varieties, the Corinthian and the Argive alphabet, (2) the Attic alphabet, (3) the alphabet of the Islands, (4) the Ionian alphabet. Lastly, Dr Taylor {Alphabet, ii. 64), while apparently adopting Eirchhoff 's arrangement, hardly improves upon it by enumerating seven groups, dis- tinguished as (1) the Ionian, (2) the Aegean, (3) the Corinthian, (4) the Argive, (5) the Attic, (6) the Etiboean, (7) the Peloponnesian, Â§ 4. Derivation of the alphabets firom a Phoenician sonrce. Direction of writing. The Greek alphabets are modifications and to some extent individual expansions of one and the same original alphabet derived from the Phoenician of 22 signs. These 22 signs were adopted without exception in the Phoenician order, and, as far as the oldest extant inscriptions entitle us to an inference, nearly in the forms indicated below : IS 8 4 6 Â« 7 8 9 10 11 IS 18 14 15 16 17 18 19 SO SI 3S T M 9 1 J T No attempt is here made at reproducing the form of the letters with exact- ness. They neoessarily vary in detail in different and even in the same inscrip- Digitized by Google Â§4 ALPHABET: HISTORICAL SKETCH tions. For the exact representation of the most ancient Greek inscriptional types the student is referred to the inscriptions given later in facsimile. Below we subjoin for the sake of comparison the parent Phoenician forms, as taken from the two most ancient Phoenician monmnents hitherto brought to light ; these are (1) the inscriptions on fragments of the sacred vessels from the Temple of Baal Lebanon; (2) the inscription on the famons stele of Mesha, king of Moab, (the 'Moabite stone ') dated approximately at 890 b.c* On palaeographical grounds the priority in age has been assigned to the Baal Lebanon fragments. For convenience of future reference we have given also the Hebrew names of the letters and in the next column their numerical values.

(Harpocr. d KoroiOev vd/Lto?); to the same period belong the povarpo^-qhov inscriptions of the Greek mercenaries at Abou Symbel (no. 130); and early in the same century we have the inscriptions found on the Sacred Way at Branchidae (nos. 133 sqq.). It would appear then that in the sixth century the PovaTpo<f>7jS6v style prevailed so far as to be characteristic. It was not till the beginning of the fifth century that the change from the retrograde to the PovaTpo<lyr)86v method brought about as a natural consequence the complete adoption of the left to right direc- tion.

Immediate modiflcations necessary. The vowel signs. An alphabetic system of Semitic origin was obviously inadequate without considerable adaptation to meet the phonetic requirements of an essentially different language. To some of the signs there- fore immediately after their adoption by the Greeks, and to others in the course of individual development, a value different from the Phoenician was given. The first need, which was doubtless felt at once, was to find special expressions for the vowel sounds, which the mother alphabet did not supply. These were obtained by uti- lising the signs 1, 6, 10, 16 (the Phoenician aleph, he, yod, at/in), which from a Greek point of view were superfluous, to denote the ^ The comparison of writing to the action of ploughing appears again in the use of aXoc/fetr (Aristoph. Vesp, 860) and the Latin exarare litteras. Doubtless between the strictly retrograde and the regular povtrrpotpTidoy there were many varieties; cf.

Thus we are assured by the Scholiast on Dionysias Thrax (Bekk.

The need of distinctive signs for long and short vowels was not felt at first; 5 and 16 (Ae and ayin) were even used to express the pseudo-diphthongs ct and ov. The last sound indeed continued to be expressed by a single sign till quite late in the history of the alphabet, and it was not till several decades after the general reception of the Ionic alphabet that this monopthongal ov was universally expressed by Ujoo separate vowel signs in the same way as genuine diph- thongs. The history of the e-sounds is briefly this. At a very early period, and probably before 600 B.a, the desire was felt in the Eastern part of Hellas to distinguish long and short* e, and in these regions no. 8, which at first denoted the spiritits aspevy began to be used as an expression of long e, while to no. 5 {he) were left the functions of short e and the pseudo-diphthong. In Ionic this usage became dominant; there was naturally at first a transition period during which the spi/ritus asper gradually ceased to be expressed by a written s3rmbol. The remaining alphabets with very slight excep- tions adhered to the older usage, which in this and other respects was finaUy supplanted only by the general reception of the Ionic alphabet. Contemporaneously with the introduction of two signs for the 0-sounds, and perhaps even earlier â€” ^before the end of the 7th century b.c. â€” (see the remarks in Â§ 22, p. 38 and Â§ 67, p. 164), a need was experienced for distinguishing tlie long and short o-sounds in the written character, and hence arose at several spots in these regions a second innovation. Of the various modes attempted, that of the lonians eventually prevailed ; by differentiation from the old sign O', to which was left the value o and ov, they obtained a new sign Q, which was destined to mark the long o-sound, and was assigned the last place in the alphabet The history of the fifth vowel u (v) is more obscure. We have seen that aleph, he and ayin were turned without difficulty into a, c and o: yod too readily became t, a fact which seems to show that the semi-vowel y had even at that early period totally disappeared from Greece : on the same principle vau (no. 6) might have served to express v, but as the older language still generally separated consonantal and vocalic u, it became necessary to invent a new sign Y or V for the vowel, which took its place at the end of the series of the Phoenician characters. 1 Or, more properly perhaps, â™¦open* and â€¢dose* e.

PART L Â§ 5 But from what source the Greeks took their Y (V) it is impossible to tell '. All we can say is that there is no known Greek alphabet which had not this sign and therefore did not at least consist of 23 signs. It seems then on this and other grounds highly probable that the invention or adoption of the v was contemporaneous with the reception of the Phoenician alphabet by the Greeks; and that consequently the original Greek alphabet consisted of 23 signs, and (apart from minor details, which must be regarded as the innovations of a later time) is essentially the same as that which we find on the oldest inscriptions of Thera, Melos and Crete. Â§ 6. The sibilants^ But of the 23 signs, which must thus have been adopted en bloc at or before the period to which these old inscriptions belong, only 21 can have been in actual use; for the rich supply of sibilanta, by which the Phoenician alphabet was characterised, the Greek, dependent herein upon the phonetic cha- racteristics of the language, was unable to take over in full for any individual dialect or locality. These sibilants, the soft, zayin (no. 7), the hard, samekh (no. 15), the lingual, tsade (no. 18), the palatal, shin (no. 21), are believed to have had the values cfo, Â«, ts, sh, respectively. One of the signs, that for tsadey though formerly thought to occur on no Greek inscription, has now been identified with the 18th letter, M*, on the recently discovered alphabet of Formello (Â§ 12), where it stands between TT and ?; thus occupying the same relative position as in the Phoenician alphabet. But the name of taade recalls zeta too clearly for the resemblance to be accidental. The shape of zeta however (always X) is unquestionably that of zayin, and za^n occupies the same relative place in the alphabet as zeia, A similar uncer- tainty prevails in regard to the disposal and identification of the two remaining Phoenician signs samekh and shin. Though sigma ^ Professor Key thinks that it is the Hebrew form of ayin (y), which differs muoh in shape from the nearly perfect circle of the old Phoenician. But Prof. Key's remark is applicable only to the later Hebrew form of ayin; if any form had been borrowed it would surely have been the earlier. Eirchhoff, Stttd,* 170 regards as accidental the resemblance of the vau on the Mesha inscription (y) with the Greek Y.

On the other hand, in Ionic inscriptions as early as the 6th century, we find the form of the 15 th Phoenician letter samekh utilised for the 15th Greek letter a^ Further, on the older Dorian inscriptions, and even on the Ionic (1) jSovorpo^iySov inscrip- tion of Ohalcis (no. 167), the sign for sigma is not $ or t, but M. Several difficulties then present themselves for solution. (1) If zeta has the sign of ziÂ»t/in but the name of tsade, what became of the sign for tsade ? (2) If $ or ? represents the sign for shin but the name of samekh, while samekh itself was used for the compound od = ks, whence came the sign M, known as sigma, on the older Dorian inscriptions? (3) How is the want of corres- pondence between name and sign in each case to be explained 1 It seems highly probable (i) that the Greeks once had the sign, if not the sound, of a fourth sibilant, (ii) that it was once known as sam,, (iii) that this san represented the form, though not the name, of the 18th Phoenician letter tsade, (iv) that san was in fact no other than the sign M, (v) that this M coexisted in one branch of the alphabet with J or ^ in the other, the two branches having each selected a different Phoenician sign to denote the sound or sounds which after- wards at least became s. Thus we find that in the 5th century B.C. a fourth sibilant still survived in dialectic use. According to Herodotus' the names of the Persians \"all end with the same letter â€” the letter which is called sam, by the Dorians and sigm>a by the lonians.\" Herodotus indeed says nothing about a difference of form, but his mention of a distinctive Dorian and Ionian usage makes it highly probable that we have in the M of the older Dorian 1 Â« The name samekh, with the normal addition of the emphatic aUph, would become samekha or samega and then sigma by metathesis of the labial and the gnttaral,\" Taylor, Alph, n. 98.

Again, the numerical powers of the first seventeen Phoenician and Greek letters correspond; the 17th, p, represents 80 in both alpha- bets, but the 19th, q, stands for 100 in the Phoenician and for 90 in the Greek. The 18th Phoenician letter, a sibilant, which stood for 90, disappeared from the Greek alphabet, and may be identified with the lost scm. This conjectural explanation is fully confirmed by the ancient abecedaria from Italy ; for in these the place next after p is occupied by M in the alphabets of Formello, Bomarzo and Grosseto, and VI* in the older alphabet of Caere (see p. 17). Lastly, on the want of correspondence between the Phoenician and the Greek names, Dr Taylor, rejecting all former solutions as disproved by the recently discovered abecedaria, remarks (AlpJiahety ii. 99) that the ^hole difficulty will disappear if we assume that a confusion and exchange of names took place between the two dental sibilants, zayin and tsadef which represented approximate sounds, and also between the two *open' sibilants, aomfhekh and shin. He explains the inter- change of names as the result of the amalgamation of contiguous local alphabets in which the primitive characters had acquired different forms. \" The literature of the more cultured but less numerous people becoming known to the other race, they would employ the characters of the literary alphabet, designating them however by the familiar names of the characters expressing the same sounds in their own alphabet. If, for instance, the s in one alphabet had been originally obtained from aamekhy and in tlie other from shin, those who had been accustomed to call the hard sibilant sigma, would continue to apply this name to the character which expressed the same sound in the supplanting alphabet.\" ^ Dr Taylor (Alphabet ^ ii. 95) notes that this oonolnsion is confirmed by the name and form of the numeral sampi {<rav+iri). The name is modem and seems to have been suggested by the resemblance to jt of the 15th century form^ . This however may be traced back through the minusonle numeral /ft (9th century MS), the uncial n\\ (which stands for 900 on a Greek 2nd century papyrus), and the numismatic T (^)t found on coins of Mesembria from the 5th to the 2nd century b.o.

The hoppa at first universally used before the vowels o and v was at a later period in most localities given up as entirely superfluous, and was retained in the general Greek alphabet only as a numeral sign with the value 90. The same was the case with the vow, the sound of which (though origi- nally so rooted in the language that so far from its being utilized for a vowel sign an entirely new vowel sign was invented) neverthe- less later in the different dialects under different circumstances and at different times gradually died out In some regions however (see pp. 50, 271) it outlived for a considerable period the reception of the Ionic alphabet in which it had first of all begun to lose its life as a sound. The sign which thus became superfluous continued to be used as an expression for the number 6. Â§ 8. Changes of form in the letters, (i) temporal, (ii) local. The other changes, which in the course of time the 23 original letters underwent, concern more particularly not their value but their form, and are of no essential significance. One obvious change was in the position of the letters. At first, as we have seen (Â§ 4), the universal direction of writing was from right to left or retrograde ; this was varied after a time by the ^owrrpo^rihov style ; but with the disuse of these two styles and the gradual prevalence of the right to left direction of writing, the alteration in the position of the letters became permanent Again, as the use of writing became more general the several signs assumed a more regular and clearly marked character ; the forms were simplified, as was notably the case with the toto, originally crooked like its Phoenician predecessor, the yorf, but afterwards straight. Thus there arose during these periods of transition many slightly varying formations, which are mostly of temporary value and of no decisive and specific importance for any one of the individual alphabets. They rather characterise the time during which they were in force than stamp any particular locality ; e.g. A, f, Â©, are nearly always* of greater antiquity than A, E, O, and the same may be said of thw respective relations in whatever locality they occur. On the other hand a few of these forms have an exclusively local value, e.g. the 6eto-form C of the ^ In fact it is only in the veiy late times that we find used indisoriminatelj at the same period, and even in one and the same inscription, forms properly eharacteristio of dififerent periods, such as A, A, A ; E, â‚¬ ; O, Â©^ O. 2â€”2 Digitized by Google 12 GREEK EPIGRAPHY, PARTI.

This older alphabet of 23 signs did not long suffice for its requirements, for it did not contain a complete and consistent representation of the Greek sound-system. Only the series of the dentals was completely repre- sented ; the labial and guttural series had no aspirate-signs. Further, the Greeks manifested a tendency to express the union of a mute with a following sibilant, as a combined and indivisible sound, which required a corresponding sign. The union of a dental with a sibilant found its expression in the I, which had taken upon itself this as well as other functions ; but for the labial and guttural series there were no such composite signs. At first the labial aspirate was expressed by the combination irh and the guttural aspirate by kA, and the required sibilant compounds by juxtaposition of the signs representing their phonetic elements {ko- and wa, or ^a and <^<r), as is seen (e.g.) in the inscriptions of Thera and Melos; but after a time this clumsy method was given up and the alphabet was enriched by the adoption of three new signs X (+), 4>, ^ (y), which took their place in the alphabet after the V. This expansion must have been effected at a very early period*, for with the excep- tion of the alphabet of Thera, Melos and Crete, we know no Greek alphabet which does not already possess some or all of these signs. Â§ 10. Division into Eastern and Western alphabets based on the forms and order of the signs for ^, <^, ^, ij/. Here may be said to begin the unsolved problem in the history of the Greek alphabet. These signs have a different order and value in the different districts. It has accordingly been found convenient to distin- guish two main divisions of the Greek alphabets, the Eastern and the Western. The Eastern, which includes on the mainland of Greece proper only the alphabets of Corinth, Megara and Argos, arranges them in the order 4>, X, V, giving X the value of x, N|/ of i/r, and expressing the sound of ^ by the sign i or hH (samekh) standing between v and o in the alphabetical order. The Western division, comprehending most of Greece proper and its Western ^ Eirchhoff {Stud,^ 172) thinks that the expansion must have been complete even before the end of the 8th century b.c, as we may infer from the presence of the new signs in the alphabet of Chalcis and its colonies, and from the early date assigned to the foundation of the latter. Digitized by Google Â§11 ALPHABET: HISTORICAL SKETCH 13 colonies, retains indeed the i in the form BB but only as a superfluotas letter, places X before ^ with the value ^, gives to \"^ the value Xi and for iff continues to use the old combination ^cr : two alphabets only of this group, the (Ozolian) Locrian and the Arcadian, express the ^ by a special sign, )j|C, which is obviously a product of differen- tiation and not an old invention. Between these two groups but in closer connexion with the Eastern, a middle position is taken up by those alphabets, which, like the Attic, possess the 4> and X, the latter with the value x, but express ^ and ^ not by special signs, but in more ancient style by ^o* a^d ffxr. It is possible of course that they actually possess the signs i and y but do not yet use them, just as in the Western group the Boeotian possesses the sign + with the value ^ and occasionally uses it, but to the end continues to denote the sound also by x<r (cf. Â§ 88). Â§ 11. Attempted solutions of the problem. How then are we to account for the identity which exists in the form of these three signs, X, <t>, nI', in both alphabet-groups in spite of the different arrangement and the fundamentally different value of two of them, X, >]/? Of the various contending hypotheses it must suffice to quote the following. (i) Kirchhoff {Stvd,* 173 sq.), maintaining an attitude of caution, holds that this identity of form in the three signs can hardly be accidental. We must therefore assume that they were in- vented probably aU at the same time and in any case at one spot, from which they have spread over the whole region: and that consequently since the two which are used with different values could not have had this double significance from the very first, one of these values must be the original, the other the pro- duct of arbitrary alteration. Further, since the different sequence of the 4> and X in thp alphabets of the different groups plainly stands in a causal connexion with this change of meaning of the X, this variation in its turn can only be explained by treating the one order as the original, the other as altered and secondary. The only question is, which of the two groups, the Eastern or the Western, represents most truly the original value and the original order of these three signs. (ii) An alternative and bolder hypothesis, by no means free from difficulty, is advanced by Dr Taylor {Alphabet, ii. 90 sqq.). He maintains that the characters of one alphabet were not adopted Digitized by Google 14 GREEK EPIGRAPHY. PART L Â§ ll in another as symbols of totally different sounds, but that in each case the forms in question were independent differentiations which in process of time became accidentally similar. According to this view the X (H~) = x ^^ ^6 East was merely a differentiation of kappa (\\ X, +); and in the West the loop of koppa is opened so as to yield the successive forms f, V, |. In either case then we shall have a simplification of the compound expressions KB, ^BÂ» which are both used on the inscriptions of Thera to denote \\, Similarly he thinks that both characters for ^, the Western as well as the Eastern, were obtained by differentiation from aaanekh; the primitive forms ^ or i (see the Table, p. 5 supra) yielding + or X almost as readily (1) as they yielded E. Lastly, the y, which with the value of i/r is confined to the Ionian alphabet, may well have been evolved from <^, and may thus be just such a simplification of <t>^ (which as well as Pt was used to denote i^) as the Eastern X and the Western N^ were conjectured to be of KB and <pB respectively. The best however that can be said of these conclusions is that the changes are possible ; they are at any rate not proven. (iii) A farther oontribution towards an explanation of the evolution or in- vention of the ** complementaiy \" signs comes from M. Glermont-Ganneau^ Here we have not space for more than a mere r^smn^ of his results, and a few remarks on the more obvious of the objections, which suggest themselves. M. Glermont-Ganneau takes his stand upon the forms of the Mesha monument, as adequately supplying all the necessary material. He then proceeds upon the assumption that two principles guided the Greeks in the formation of their additional characters; (1) the principle of con- tiguity, by which he means that they always had recourse to the letters nearest at hand in the parent Phoenician alphabet to supply their new needs ; (2) the principle that in aU their complementary signs they reproduce the archaic forms of tJie Phoenician types. Thus he argues that Y came from V, the Semitic vau (as it appears on the steld of Mesha), which it had in the first instance represented ; Y was reserved by the Greeks for the sound v and placed at the end of the alphabet, i.e. at the head of the complementary series, the F having usurped its place in the order and having inherited its name vau; the ^ Clermont-Ganneau, Origine des caracttres compUmentaires de Valphabet grec, Y, <1>, X, f.

Again, the sign is no other than the sign for koppa^ which was chosen both becanse it was unused and because it was next to ir ; the form of koppa which the Greeks selected was the archaic form. Thirdly, the sign for X (=:x) ^ merely one of the forms of tau; the tau was chosen because, as closing the series, it was the sign nearest to the complementary series ; the sign for X + ( =x) is the most andent form of tau. Fourthly, the y ( = ^), like all the additional letters, must be sought in the ancient Phoenician alphabet; it was simply a Y differentiated by an added vertical bar. Here M. Clermont-Ganneau appeals to alphabets of the Locrians and Arcadians, who, he thinks, in order to represent the sound p9 had recourse not to the Y (for they had already derived from it their \"f), but to the next readiest to hand of the complementary signs, i.e. X, which they similarly crossed with a vertical bar. Lastly, the A is a diflerentiated form of the Phoenician O ; the last in order of the complementary series, it is also the most recent. Against these views it has been urged by Dr Taylor {Acad, 11. cc.), that (1) it is an elementary canon of palaeographical science that no changes in alphabetic signs are due to arbitrary invention but are effected in every case by slow and unconscious differentiation ; (2) it is inadmissible as a general pro- position, that any alphabetical character could radically change its phonetic value; for example that the archaic form of the Phoenician tau could be used to express the sound of x* It is no answer to this objection to point to the different values of X and ^ in the Eastern and Western alphabets; the origin of these signs is too obscure to serve as a basis of comparison. Nor can the changed use of the sign for tpiritus asper to denote rj be cited ; it is possible that the name of the letter itself (^a) suggested the change in usage. The same objection applies in part to Dr Taylor's attempted derivation (Alphabet, u. p. 89) of from 6, which he supposes to have been effected in an Aeolic region, where the sounds j>/i and th were easily confused or interchanged. Perhaps, however, the most apt criticism of M. Glermont-Qanneau's views is to be found in the words of S. Beinach {Trait4 d'ipigr, grecque, 200), who, while expressing a gene- ral approval of the theory, nevertheless cautiously adds, * I'auteur a peut-dtre le tort d*attribuer aux Grecs des plus anciens temps la subtilit^ et Tesprit de com- binaison qui n'appartiennent quli lui.' (iv) Lastly, W. Deecke (Baumeister, Denkm, p. 51), laying stress on the remarkable resemblance of the Greek Y, 4>, X, ^ to certain of the Cypriote syllabic characters (see note on p. 310), maintains that the Greek supplementary characters were derived from these. The resemblance is certainly striking, and the conjec- ture receives some confirmation from the phonetic values of the Cypriote signs. Thus Y denotes w, y2 stands for pu and /?A{w), 1^ Digitized by Google 16 GREEK EPIGRAPHY. PART L Â§ 11 for ha and kh{u), ju t ^^ for se. Mr E. A. Gardner {J. H, S., 1886, Vol. VII. p. 233 sq.), giving a general support to Deecke's views, is inclined to complete the account by deriving A not from O, but from the Cypriote sign for ko, which takes the forms A H. He justly urges that in the trade between Miletus and Naucratis, where he argues that A was in use before the end of the 7th century (Â§ 67), Cyprus must have been a frequent stopping place for the Greek merchants*. Â§ 12. Alphabetic order. The abecedaria. In the preceding sections it has been tacitly assumed that there was an ancient fixed * alphabetic * order of the letters, and that this order was identical in the Phoenician and in the derived alphabets, at least so far as the stock of letters was common to both the latter and the former. It is now time to state the evidence on which this assumption rests. There are four methods (Taylor, Alphabet, i. 185) by which the arrangement of the letters in ancient alphabets can usually be ascertained : (1) by means of actual alphabets or 'abecedaria', (2) from the values attached to the letters when used as numerals, (3) by means of acrostic composition, (4) from evidence afibrded by alphabetic transmissions, i.e. derived alphabets. While only the last method of proof is available for settling the order of the ancient Phoenician alphabet and while the order of the derived Semitic alphabets, as for instance Hebrew, is adequately inferred from the numerical values of the letters or from acrostic compositions, such as Psalms 119, 111 and 145, the first four chapters of Lamentations, Proverbs xxxi. 10 â€” 31, and the imperfectly acrostic Psalms 37, 9 and 10, 25 and 34 : the Greek order on the other hand is proved beyond question by the discovery of abecedaria of undoubtedly high antiquity. The alphabets of Formello and Caere have already been alluded to (Â§ 6) ; we now subjoin a detailed account of these and other abecedaria. The Formello Alphabet.

The two alphabets are nearly identical in detail : in the first E and F have been interchanged, doubtless by mistake, and ir and ? approach more nearly to the usual forms. In the Formello alphabet^ as well as in those of Caere and CoUe, the v is followed by a symbol which occurs in no Greek inscription, and which we shall see reason to identify as the descendant of the Phoenician samekh. Further, as in the alphabet of Caere, the order of the signs for v ^ ^ ;( is that which we have above noted to be peculiar to the Weatem series of alphabets. The 3 = o* is in the second example written retrograde, an arrangement which, like that of the fi in the alphabet of Caere, indicates a period of fluctuation in the direction of writing.

The affinities of the alpha- bets represented by these abecedaria will be discussed more fittingly under the head of the inscriptions from the localities to which they severally belong.

PART L % 13 fragment of a Oorinthian alphabet, which we may without hesitation conclude to have continued in the order v4>x^Â» We have already (Â§ 6) emphasised the unique interest attaching to the discovery of the alphabet from Formello ] besides enabling us to determine the alphabetic position and the form of the ancient Greek letter representing the acm {akin), it is the only complete abecedarium extant which contains the archaic Greek forms of every one of the 22 Phoenician letters arranged precisely in the received Semitic order. The alphabets of both Formello and Caere further determine beyond controversy, what without their evidence must have been only matter of inference, the order of the final letters in the Western group of alphabets. Similarly, the tablet from Calymna establishes the order observed in the Eastern group. About this indeed there had been little doubt; the later numerical values as- signed to the letters and the evidence of alphabetic transmission were enough in themselves to prove that the arrangement which has survived to our day was the original one. The special value there- fore of this fragment from Oalymna lies in its being the most ancient extant Ionic abecedarium. Ross (Inscrr. inedd. ii. no. 137) gives an instance frx)m Amorgos of a complete Ionic abecedarium (shown by the form Z to be of a comparatively late date) repeated 23 times on the back of an inscribed marble. The Italic alphabets, as represented by those found at Formello, Cervetri and Oolle, are, as we have said, of Chalcidian origin. And this conclusion is not invalidated by the presence of the symbol ffl , nor by that of M (the ^ of Caere), which appear on no extant inscription in the Chalcidian alphabet For, as Kirchhoff has shown (Stud,* 136), the first of these signs stands in the posi- tion, which in the Phoenician mother-alphabet is assigned to samekh and which according to tradition â€” ^now verified by the abecedarium found at Calymna â€” was occupied by the S or [+| (Argive) in the alphabets of the Eastern group. These forms may be merely a simplification of the more complicated symbol ffl , and it would not then be necessary to regard the Argive variety as an Ionic i placed sideways*. The Eastern alphabets, as we know, 1 Eirohhoff, Stud,* 85; of. ed. 4, p. 136.

And as in extant inscriptions of the Western group there is not the slightest trace of any other use of the S3rmbol, we can only assume that just as in the Ionic alphabet the digamma (the later * stigma') and the koppa, long after they had ceased to be used for letters, survived in the alphabetic list, to be utilised only at a much later period as numeral signs, so in this alphabet, which does not for this reason cease to be Chalcidian, the Q lay dormant as a superfluous sign which had been taken over with the rest from the mother-alphabet. The same explanation will account for the other superfluous sign, the M of Formello (the ^ of Caere). It will have been noticed that koppa, which on the hypotheeis of the deriva- tion of the alphabet from a Chalcidian source should have been present, is nevertheless absent from the alphabet of Caere. Bat that its absence is certainly only accidental is clear from its appearance in the alphabet of Formello^. 11.

The prin- ciple of classification adopted is primarily geographical and wiU correspond in the main to the division of alphabets which has been given above as that of Kirchhoff (Â§ 3). But in our examination of the inscriptions under the head of the individual localities we have so &r departed from Kirchhoff's method in that we take the oldest, or presumably oldest, and not the youngest^ documents first, and trace the development of the alphabet in each case through the later inscriptions down to the time when the epichoric alphabet ^ In the Etrosoan syllabary above alluded to the koppa does not appear in its natural position, but is relegated to the last line (?{ ?a ?iÂ« ?e) and follows ^ {=x)f occupying the place assigned in the Etruscan alphabet to the sign 8 (=/). The composer of the syllabary seems to have found out the accidental omission in the alphabet, not at once, but at least in time to add it in the syllabary at the end. Kirohhoff {Stud.* 127) rejects as altogether untenable the view of Mommsen that the ? is here identical with, but an older form of, the Etruscan 8. Digitized by Google 29 GREEK EPIGRAPHY, PART I. Â§ U was supplanted by the Ionic variety. And though there is no d priori reason why we should give preference to the Eastern over the Western group, or vice versa; yet, as it happens that in one branch of the Eastern group, comprising the islands of the A^ean sea, we find the nearest approximation to the Phoenician mother-alphabet, in the inscriptions of Thera, Melos and Crete, where the 'non-Phoenician* letters have hardly begun to exist, we have given the foremost place to these and other islands of the A^ean. Some however, such as Samos and Chios, stand in a different category as having afforded no inscriptions, even of the earliest times from which they have come down to us, unaffected by the influence of the Ionic alphabet. An intermediate position between the usage of the Aegean Islands and that of the Ionic localities is occupied by the alphabets of Attica, Argos, Corinth and certain other places on the mainland of Hellas, in some of which the alphabet is all but Ionic in character. From these the transition is natinral and easy to those alphabets in which we recognise a more or less complete lonicism; these are to be sought in the coast towns of Asia Minor, in Rhodes, Samos, and the Ionic colonies. Lastly, as a division sui generis and separated by well- marked characteristics from any of the others, we give the inscrip- tions illustrative of the Western group, those belonging to the main- land of Hellas generally, with Euboea and the Chalcidian colonies.

The inscriptions* fall at once chronologi- cally into two groups, distinguished respectively by the crooked and the straight form of the iota. In the second group, more- over, represented only by nos. 6 a, 6, individual letters exhibit more regular forms or later usage, as E beside ^ and ^ beside M, In the alphabet then as represented by the older stratum we note (1) the absence of ^, i/r, ^, ;(, which are represented by ICO\", vtr, ttA, kA or ?A respectively; in fact of the non-Phoenician characters only Y appears ; (2) iota is crooked and irregular ; (3) o- is M ; (4) ft is /^ ; (5) tf has its old form Â© or Â® and twice (no. 1 1, n) is even expressed by 6h; (6) there is no O; the symbol O or O represents the sounds of o, ov, co; but (7) B stands for rf as well as for A, though rj is represented by ^ in 'Pi/f avcop (no. 2 a) ; (8) a has the crossbar oblique. A; (9) c has its oldest form ^; (10) in none of the inscriptions does the sign for digamma appear, but probably this is only accidental ; though at the time when the in- scriptions were written its use must have been very limited, for not only name-forms like AcovrtSas, IlcptXas, KXcayopag and the forma- tions in 'Kkrj% show that the sound in the middle of words had all but vanished, but also when initial, before consonants CPrj^dvwp) as well as before vowels (OpOoKX'qs, \"laaos) it had already begun to lose its place. A limited initial use therefore is the most that can be assumed. A peculiar sign for beta probably occurs in ''A/Sputvo^ (?), no. 1 1 (see the note ad loc.), Kpiro|j3]ovXov, no. 4 m. The sign for zeta is accidentally absent. Relation to other Alphabets, (a) In the absence of the non- Phoenician ^, X* ^) <*>> the alphabet of the oldest Theraean inscrip- tions resembles that of the oldest Melian and Cretan inscriptions. In several important particulars the Theraean alphabet surpasses in antiquity that of the famous Abou-Symbel inscriptions (130 a â€” t), 1 No account is here taken of no. 6, which though fonnd in Thera may not belong to the island, and is only provisionally placed here.

Thus we have in Tliera Crooked iota San M ^> X> ^ absent at AhoU'Symbel Straight iota Sigma i ^> X> ^ present. Again, though in the Ionic alphabet of the inscriptions found at Naucratis (132 a â€” g) many forms are quite as old as those of Thera, or even older, the absence of the non-Phoenician signs entitles the Theraean inscriptions to a yet higher antiquity. (6) If Kirchhoff is right in his view that the more correct copies establish the usage of O for o, ov, and O for w, the Theraean in this tendency to differentiation resembles its neighbour the Melian, which as will be seen attempts, though in another way, to differentiate the long and short O-sounds.
