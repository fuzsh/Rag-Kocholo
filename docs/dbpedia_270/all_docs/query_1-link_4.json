Hyped-up technobabble for\n\nsimply talking between an auditor and a pc or a supervisor and a\n\nstudent. Also TWC, Two-Way Comm. \"Use 2WC on the PC to a win.\"\n\nAA, attempted abortion. According to L. Ron Hubbard's book\n\nDianetics, pregnant mothers routinely tried to kill their unborn\n\nbabies with knitting needles and douches, thus most people are\n\nfilled with AA engrams or hidden memories of pain. \"The Preclear\n\nhad 51 AA incidents in her bank.\"\n\nAberrated, Hubbard's term for derangement or insanity. \"The wog\n\nworld is heavily aberrated.\"\n\nAberration, an instance of insanity. Also, another term for an\n\nengram, or a hidden memory of pain and unconsciousness. \"You are\n\nputting Dev-T on my lines because of your fucking aberrations.\"\n\nABLE, Association for Better Living and Education. One of many\n\nScientology front-groups. The purpose of these front-groups is to\n\nescape from the increasingly bad name Scientology has earned over\n\ntime by implementing its surprisingly vicious and vindictive\n\npolicies such as SP declares (in which perceived enemies of\n\nScientology are labeled as suppressive or destructive to\n\nScientology's aims), disconnection (whereby family members are told\n\nto stay away from the rest of their family who are not\n\nScientologists), Fair Game (in which Scientology's enemies may be\n\nsued, tricked, lied to, or destroyed, as per Scientology policy),\n\netc. \"ABLE Int - Association for Better Living and Education\n\nInternational - Oversees secular activities such as Applied\n\nScholastics, Narconon, Criminon, and The Way to Happiness\n\nFoundation.\" - Jonathon Barbera. Able Int is now located at the\n\nHGB, qv.\n\nAcademy, the area in an Scientology organization (known as an Org)\n\nin which the advanced training is carried out. Lower level training\n\nis done in the Div 6, public division course room. \"Route the raw\n\nmeat out of Div 6 and down into the academy to boost the stats.\"\n\nAck, see Acknowledgement.\n\nAcknowledgement, used to end a cycle of communication in Hubbard's\n\nrather stilted communication theory. Usually a \"good\", \"ok\", \"I got\n\nthat\", or \"thank you.\" \"Give me an Ack, or I'll ramble on and on\n\nuntil I ARC break.\"\n\nACT, alt.clearing.technology. Often in small letters, \"act\", or\n\nwith periods, \"a.c.t.\" The hangout for the relics of the cult who\n\nstill practice the strange \"technology\" or rituals developed by\n\nHubbard, but who have left the cult of Scientology proper. Of\n\ncourse, some people have it that the group actually deals with acne\n\npimple remedies... See also ARS.\n\nAction, an auditing or processing regimen; an instance of the\n\napplication of Scientology's \"technology\" on a person.\n\nAD, after Dianetics. Used on issues such as HCOBs and HCOPLs\n\n(Hubbard Communication Office Bulletins and Policy Letters) to show\n\nthe year. It is based on the Christian calendar, but with a base\n\nyear of 1950 with the release of Hubbard's book \"Dianetics\"; thus\n\nAD 15 = anno Domini 1965.\n\nAdmin, administration. Detailed bureaucracy taken to new heights;\n\nthousands of green on white issues written by L. Ron Hubbard\n\n(Hubbard Communication Office Policy Letters) cover the design of\n\nthis monumental testament to inefficiency that would make IBM\n\nproud. The OEC Vols (Organization Executive Course or Green\n\nVolumes) cover most of the Admin policy.\n\nAdmin Dictionary, a large green Scientology dictionary made up of\n\nquotes from L. Ron Hubbard that defines some of the thousands of\n\nnew terms Scientology introduced with its massive administration\n\nbureaucracy.\n\nAdmiral, L. Ron Hubbard. A final self-bestowed promotion, given\n\nhumbly to himself (there was no one else to do it) by Hubbard just\n\nbefore his death. L. Ron Hubbard was also referred to as Ron,\n\nSource (capitalized), LRH and the Commodore.\n\nAdore, A Divine Operating Religion of Excellence; a splinter group.\n\nSee Free Zone.\n\nAffinity, used as a synonym for love or like.\n\nAffluence, a condition or level of high and climbing production.\n\nAptly named, as higher production means more money. \"The stats will\n\nbe in screaming affluence again this Thursday at 2:00.\"\n\nAlter-Is, to alter the way something really is, and thus to create\n\na persistence. See As-Is. \"If the Flag Rep keeps Alter-Ising the\n\nTech, she'll be K/R'ed!\"\n\nAmends Project, a way for a down-stat (not producing enough or\n\nlooking less than fixedly happy) Scientologist to get back in good\n\ngraces. Usually involves long hours scrubbing toilets and such,\n\nfollowed by a mass petition collecting signatures of completion to\n\nbreak down the willpower and personality of the cult indoctrinee\n\nbased on group rejection/ acceptance, peer-pressure and milieu\n\ncontrol. \"Jan's doing an Amends Project, as part of his Ethics\n\nCycle; I'm not signing his petition until he cleans my room to\n\nwhite-glove standards.\"\n\nANZO, Australia, New Zealand and Oceania. One of Scientology's\n\n\"continents\". See CLO.\n\nAO, Advanced Organization. A Scientology group that delivers the\n\nhigher parts of the Bridge, such as Operating Thetan (OT) 1-8, the\n\nLs (lists that are shouted out to the patient), etc.\n\nAOLA, Advanced Organization of Los Angeles - this org has had at\n\nleast three different locations in LA over the last 30 years, and\n\nis currently at the Cedars complex.\n\nAOSHANZO, Advanced Organization Saint Hill for Australia, New\n\nZealand and Oceania.\n\nAOSHEU, Advanced Organization/Saint Hill Europe - in Denmark. Also\n\nreferred to as AOSH DK - located in Copenhagen.\n\nAOSHUK, Advanced Organization/Saint Hill United Kingdom - at Saint\n\nHill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex, England.\n\nApollo, was one of L. Ron Hubbard's ships in his toy navy. Ron\n\nloved to play sailor-man. See Flag.\n\nARC, Affinity, Reality, and Communication; when a cultie meets a\n\ncultie, a comin' through the rye. ARC is used as a synonym for love\n\nor like or general warmth to be applied to raw meat marks (green\n\nScientologists) to smooth the earlier stages of brainwashing. ARC =\n\nunderstanding, according to L. Ron Hubbard. The ARC triangle is\n\ninferior to the KRC triangle, which stands for Knowledge,\n\nResponsibility, and Control...which equal money. \"Use a little more\n\nARC when you reg people in, Sam.\"\n\nARC break or ARC-X, a break in affinity, reality or communication\n\nbetween two people causing upset, anger or tears.\n\nARC breaky, describing someone who is prone to ARC breaks, qv.\n\nARS, alt.religion.scientology; the newsgroup this FAQ is posed to.\n\nOften lower-case; \"30,000 people a month read ars, according to\n\nArbitron.\" (ars) after a definition shows that the source of the\n\nterm is ars; terms which are sourced from Scientology itself have\n\nnothing after them. (act) is for terms from\n\nalt.clearing.technology.\n\nARSCC, Alt.Religion.Scientology Central Committee; It is a game.\n\nThe OSA Scientologists have tried to represent opposition to\n\nScientology as emanating from one or other focus - at first, it was\n\nDennis Erlich. Later, it was FactNet. At other times and in other\n\ncontexts the opposition has been represented as 'psychs' and the\n\nnow-destroyed 'CAN' (the Cult Awareness Network). ARSCC\n\n(Alt.Religion.Scientology Central Committee) is just a kid's game,\n\na troll, like the game of 'there is no Cabal' which is played on\n\nnewbies on alt.culture.usenet. There is no ARSCC, so it is no use\n\nbegging me to send you the Red and Blue codebooks. Even if I had\n\nthem, I'd have to deny their existence. There is a real inspiration\n\nfor this. At various times, Hubbard would allude in his bulletins\n\nto shadowy organizations such as 'Smersh' and 'The Tenyaka\n\nMemorial'; another example, taken from his mythology, is 'The Fifth\n\nInvader Force'. Another time, he described the opposition as just\n\ntwelve highly powerful suppressives (yes, bankers and financiers).\n\nHe just loved to spin yarns, and in honor of this, we do the same.\n\n(Tony Sidaway)\n\nASHOD, American Saint Hill Organization Day - located at same place\n\nas ASHOF in the Cedars Complex, Los Angeles.\n\nASHOF, American Saint Hill Organization Foundation (night and\n\nweekend org) - located at 1413 N. Berendo Street (now L. Ron\n\nHubbard Way) LA CA 90027. Previously ASHOF was located at 2723 West\n\nTemple Street, LA (from 1968 until 1977).\n\nASI, Author Services Inc. 1. A Scientology front-group whose\n\npurpose is to skim money out of the organization and channel it to\n\nthe person at the top, formerly L. Ron Hubbard. Also called Author\n\nServices. Jonathon Barbera: \"Not officially on the chart. Probably\n\nimmediately under RTC. It is senior to all other organizations but\n\nis not part of the command channels. Probably owns the copyrights\n\nand is in charge of LRH PR projects, the vaults of LRH's writings,\n\nand collecting money (through royalties) for LRH.\" ASI spends its\n\nmoney on several things: \"special properties\" ie, prints, rare\n\nbooks, LRH signed books for the Preservation of the Tech project -\n\nthe bomb-proof shelters in the desert. ASI also contributes to\n\ndissemination of Dianetics, and operates the \"Writers of the\n\nFuture\" SF contest held each year. 2. ASI - Applied Scholastics\n\nInternational, a cult educational front group.\n\nAs-is, to look at something and make it vanish like magic. \"Jim\n\nas-ised and blew some charge is session today.\" See Alter-Is.\n\nAuditine, a pun on Scientology's pseudopsychological \"auditing\"\n\ntherapy, likening it to an addictive drug (benzedrINE, etc.)\n\nAuditing, the action of running Scientology or Dianetic processes\n\non a PC (a preclear; someone receiving Scientology processing).\n\nAuditing usually involves a Meter, with the PC holding onto the\n\nsoup cans electrodes, and the Auditor taking down notes and asking\n\nquestions. \"Auditing in the HGC costs over $500 per hour.\"\n\nAuditor, the person who uses an E-Meter (a simple, ineffective lie\n\ndetector used in Scientology with a needle and soup cans for\n\nelectrodes) to find Overts (undisclosed acts) and Engrams\n\n(incidents of pain and unconsciousness) and audits them out of the\n\nperson receiving auditing or preclear.\n\nAuthor Services Incorporated, see ASI.\n\nAVC, Authorization, Verification and Correction, now the AVU,\n\nAuthorization, Verifications and Corrections Unit. Set up to ensure\n\nthat all the drivel that comes out is \"on source\" and not \"off\n\npolicy\". AVC is part of RTC, originally it was the approval line\n\nfor drivel coming out of the FLB, but now their imprimatur has to\n\nbe on everything. The imprimatur means that the issue has been\n\nreviewed by a Scientology authority and has been given \"IA\", or\n\nIssue Authority (seal of approval).\n\nAVU, see AVC.\n\nB:\n\nB-1, bureau one. A segment of the Guardian's Office (the cult's\n\nintelligence, dirty deeds and strong-arm tactics branch; now called\n\nthe Office of Special Affairs or OSA) responsible for covert\n\nintelligence; its functions are now taken over by OSA.\n\nBaby Watch, see Introspection Rundown.\n\nBank, the reactive mind; supposedly packed with \"overts,\" or\n\nundisclosed acts, and engrams or moments or pain and\n\nunconsciousness. Also, anything negative seen as coming from the\n\nreactive mind. \"All you'll find on alt.religion.scientology is just\n\nbank talking.\"\n\nBarratry, the use of frivolous lawsuits to harass. \"Scientology has\n\nbeen found guilty of barratry, given the thousands of useless\n\nlawsuits they have brought to court and wasted taxpayer's money\n\non.\"\n\nBasher, a person who is critical of Scientology. A Free Zone term,\n\nqv. \"Don't listen to him; he's just a basher.\" (act) See Meatball.\n\nBasic Basic, the earliest incident on a chain of engrams, sometimes\n\njust called Basic.\n\nBeingness, a word Hubbard probably plagiarized from Nordenholz.\n\nImplies the rewarding experience of being something, assuming a\n\nvalence (another personality) or hat (an office or post in\n\nScientology). Hubbard fit beingness into a triptych with doingness\n\nand havingness. \"She has so much beingness on her shiny new post!\"\n\nBig Win, something seen as being of great benefit, but tends to be\n\nephemeral or nebulous. A Big Win may be incomprehensible to\n\nScientology outsiders. \"I had such Big Wins all week on the Purif.\n\nI began to see what really lies behind my case!\" See \"Win\",\n\n\"Success Story.\"\n\nBillion-Year Contract, the newly-indoctrinated SO (Sea\n\nOrganization; a tough inner core of Scientologists, some of whom\n\nmay be found on the cult's ships, while others are settled in land\n\nbases) member signs one, supposedly coming back life after life to\n\nfulfill it. LSD users need not apply.\n\nBIS, Bodies In the Shop. how many people are in the Scientology\n\norganization and on lines; an important Org Statistic.\n\nBlack Hats, the bad guys. Ron wrote corny Westerns for a while,\n\nwhich might explain where the term came from. \"Ars is full of SPs\n\nwearing their Black Hats.\"\n\nBlow, 1. To leave suddenly. Also, the person who does this. \"Sam\n\nBlew off post today; he's our third Blow this week!\" 2. To get rid\n\nof the charge or mass of an engram (a moment of pain and\n\nunconsciousness). \"I blew so much mass in my session!\" See MU, M3,\n\nM4.\n\nBody Raisins, a grape name for BTs, or Body Thetans, evil spirits\n\nwhich permeate our bodies, according to L. Ron Hubbard. See BTs.\n\n(ars)\n\nBody Route, to steer public into a Scientology Organization, get\n\nthem on lines, sell them services, and make some money off them.\n\nThe idea being that public are such low-toned wogs (a common\n\nScientology derogation of Scientology outsiders) that they have no\n\nself-determination, and need to be led like sheep to the slaughter.\n\nBody Thaytans, see BTs. (ars)\n\nBody Thetans, see BTs.\n\nB of I, board of investigation. A Scientology kangaroo-court-like\n\ninternal Ethics board. \"A B of I will be convened for Harry next\n\nTuesday.\"\n\nBoo-Hoos, along with clams and Grim Weepers, these are Wholetrack\n\n(a person's last 74 trillion years or so of existence in this\n\nuniverse) ancestors to Man, and are responsible for the origin of\n\nhuman belching, gasping, sobbing, choking, shuddering and\n\ntrembling. Also called \"Grim Weepers\", and just \"Weepers.\"\n\nBook One, another name for L. Ron Hubbard's book \"Dianetics.\" Also\n\ndescribes auditing \"therapy\" as laid down in \"Dianetics.\" See\n\nDMSMH.\n\nBPC, bypassed charge. Charge that has been turned on, or\n\nrestimulated, without being as-ised, blown, or gotten rid of; in\n\nother words, an unpleasant memory that has been recalled, but\n\nhasn't been fully dealt with or erased. See \"Charge.\"\n\nBPI, 1. See Bridge Publications. 2. Broad Public Issue; a\n\nnotification on Hubbard Communication Office Bulletins (HCOBs) and\n\nHCOPLs (HCO Policy Letters) showing issue authority and\n\ndistribution.\n\nBPL, Board Policy Letter, a precursor to the HCOPL, Hubbard\n\nCommunications Office Policy Letter, qv.\n\nBridge, the bridge to total freedom; the list of auditing actions\n\nneeded to get to the highest OT (operating thetan) level, currently\n\nOT 8. The Bridge costs roughly $300,000 US, and is depicted on the\n\nGradation Chart of Human Awareness and Abilities. L. Ron Hubbard's\n\n\"Bridge to total freedom\" has two sides. One is auditor or\n\ntherapist training classes or classifications, the other is\n\nreceiving auditing or \"therapy\" such as Grades and OT levels, qv.\n\nAt the lower levels the grades and classes or classifications\n\ncorrespond, this pretty much stops after Class 6 (Saint Hill\n\nSpecial Briefing Course).\n\nBridge Publications, the cult's publishing business; also called\n\nsimply Bridge or BPI (Bridge Publications International.) New Era\n\nPublications in Europe is a part of BPI.\n\nBT, Body Thetan. Usually plural. Evil spirits which need to be\n\nexorcized. \"OT 5 consists entirely of running out BTs; what a\n\nbore.\"\n\nBTB, Board Technical Bulletin, a precursor to the HCOB, Hubbard\n\nCommunications Office Bulletin, qv. Hubbard decided that only he\n\nknew the true path of technological enlightenment of the wallet.\n\nBullbaiting, a training routine involving two students. One is to\n\nsit silent, unblinking and unmoving, while the other does\n\neverything s/he can to get a reaction. The receiving student must\n\nsimply accept whatever is done to him or her, in what is basically\n\na lesson in passivity. The stated purpose is to train the student\n\nto be unresponsive to a PC's (preclear; a person receiving\n\nScientology \"therapy\") originations during the auditing or\n\n\"therapy\" session, while the actual process of bullbaiting itself\n\nflattens a person's emotional affect; it is perfectly natural to\n\nlaugh when a person says something funny, whether this occurs in\n\nreal life or in an auditing session. In bullbaiting the person is\n\ndrilled to not react to what is being said in any way, to not show\n\nany empathy at all, producing a virtual robot, despite Scn's\n\nprotestations about not doing robotic TRs. \"The noise next door is\n\ncoming from the students doing their bullbaiting.\"\n\nC:\n\nCadet Org, any of various orgs for warehousing children of Sea Org\n\nparents. Policy is for SO women to abort their babies when ordered,\n\nbut when the unfortunates survive to full term, they are placed in\n\nthese horrific organizations. Reports are rampant with child abuse\n\nin these places ranging from neglect, to maggots in their food, to\n\nsevere under staffing, filthy and smelly conditions, and enforced\n\nparental neglect (SO parents are allowed as little as one hour per\n\nweek to see their children, called \"family time\".) The Cadet orgs\n\neven have their own RPFs, or punishment camps.\n\nCal Mag, a mixture of calcium and magnesium in water said to have\n\namazing restorative powers, according to soi-disant \"scientist\", L.\n\nRon Hubbard. See Guk Bomb.\n\nCAN, the Cult Awareness Network, formerly a loose-knit educational\n\nand group-therapy association. A Scientology target for special\n\nhatred in the form of Suppressive (describing a person or group who\n\ngoals are at odds to Scientology's goals) status, CAN has now been\n\ndestroyed through Scientology exercising its policy of using\n\nlawsuits to utterly ruin its enemies, and if you dial the number,\n\nyou get a Scientologist on the other end of the line!\n\nCancelbunny/Cancelpoodle, these refer to the ubiquitous OSA (Office\n\nof Special Affairs; the cult's private CIA/KGB) cancelers who\n\nfrequent alt.religion.scientology and visit it with their\n\ncensorship of people's posts. (ars)\n\nCans, soup cans used as electrodes for the Scientology E-Meter or\n\nlie detector. The PC (patient) holds them in his or her hands. \"I\n\nwas on the Cans for three hours today!\"\n\nCase, The sum of one's problems, bad memories, Engrams (moments of\n\npain and unconsciousness), BTs (Body Thetans or evil spirits\n\ninfesting the body), Overts (undisclosed harmful acts), Etc. \"My\n\nCase has really improved by doing the Sunshine Rundown.\" See Bank,\n\nReactive Mind.\n\nCase Gain, improvement in a PC's (patient's) case (problems) due to\n\nauditing or Scientology-style \"therapy.\" \"Paul had tremendous case\n\ngain running Grade Zero.\"\n\nCase Supervisor, see C/S.\n\nCave in, to destroy someone by forcing them over into the dark side\n\nof the bank or reactive mind (the sum of one's memories.) \"Helena\n\nKobrin wants to cave in the critics on ars.\"\n\nCC, Celebrity Center. There are several of these around the world,\n\nincorporated with the intention of luring in actors and other\n\nprominent people to give the cult a shiny PR image, the theory\n\nbeing that if John Travolta and Kirsty Alley are Scientologists,\n\nother people will want to join up and sign away their life savings.\n\nOne large CC is located right in Hollywood, and run as a ritzy\n\nhotel, utilizing the slave labor of Scientology's Sea Organization\n\nstaff to provide all the amenities to the first class citizens and\n\ncelebrities. \"CC Int - Celebrity Center International - Largest\n\ncelebrity center which delivers Scientology services to celebrities\n\nand those who can afford the higher donation rates. Also oversees\n\nthe other CCs.\" - Jonathon Barbera.\n\nCCHR, the newspeak-named Citizen's Commission on Human Rights, run\n\nby a Scientologist by the name of Dennis Clarke. CCHR's main\n\npurpose is clearing away the \"Psyches\" (mental health\n\nprofessionals; seen by Scientology as evil aliens from the fifth\n\ngalactic invader force) to make way for Scientology's advance into\n\nsociety. CCHR is a front group for Scientology.\n\nCCO, Child Care Org. See Cadet Org.\n\nCCRD, see Clear Certainty Rundown.\n\nCedars, the short name for the giant blue Scientology Cedars of\n\nLebanon complex in Los Angeles, formerly the Cedars of Lebanon\n\nHospital, which moved and became the Cedars Sinai Hospital. Cedars\n\nwas the world headquarters of Scientology, and home to many\n\nOrganizations including ASHO (the American Saint Hill\n\nOrganization), AOLA (the Advanced Organization of Los Angeles), an\n\nEPF and RPF, qv, and many others. IHELP (the International\n\nEcclesiastical League of Pastors), ITO (the International Training\n\nOrg), and OSA INT (the Office of Special Affairs International)\n\nhave now moved to the HGB, qv. CCHR has moved elsewhere. See HGB.\n\nCESO, Cedars Estates Service Org, the org responsible for\n\nmaintenance in PAC, Pacific Area Command the Los Angeles area.\n\nSimilar to the EPF, the Estates Project Force. See EPF.\n\nCelebrity Center, see CC.\n\nCentral Committee, see ARSCC.\n\nCentral Files, see CF.\n\nCEO, Scientology's Cadet Estates Organization. See Cadet Org.\n\nCF, Central Files. \"By policy, the names of any Scientologists at\n\nany org who have ever received a major service at an organization\n\nbelow Flag must be forwarded to Flag, where the names become the CF\n\nfor Flag. A major service is considered paying for and completing a\n\nlevel or training, technical or administrative, or an auditing\n\nintensive. To sign up for a major service, a member must either\n\nhave 6 months free IAS membership in existence, or be on the yearly\n\npaid membership.\" - Joe Harrington.\n\nChain, a run of memory incidents or engrams of a similar type, or\n\nwith the same content.\n\nCharge, mental mass in restimulation, or constant upheaval,\n\ncontained in the reactive mind, or memory bank. This may not make\n\nmuch sense, but then, many things in Scientology are like that. In\n\ncolloquial usage, charge refers to areas a person may be touchy\n\nabout. \"Jim has a lot of charge on the word 'critic.'\"\n\nChowderpot, {_}, an award given to arscc members who, through their\n\nactions, manage to shut down a cult org or mission.\n\nCI, see Counter-intention, Intention.\n\nClam, a derogatory term for a Scientologist. See Ronbot,\n\nHubbardite, scieno. (ars)\n\nClambake, a westcoast seafood cookout or party. The term was\n\nadopted on ars as the name for the IRC channel #clambake (now\n\n#scientology), and has more recently been applied to any situation\n\nwhere Scientology suffers a big loss. Also the name of a popular\n\nwebpage which exposes the cult's secrets. See clam.\n\nClams, Man descended from them according to \"History of Man\" by L.\n\nRon Hubbard, and the incident gives us painful engrams (memories)\n\nof being dropped onto rocks by birds, and extreme jaw pain from the\n\nbivalve's hinge. This has been a running joke on ars for some time,\n\nwith threads about clambakes, clam chowder, snapping clams, clams\n\nin .sig files, etc., although some now see it as a pejorative and\n\nhave quit using it.\n\nClamspeak, see Scientologese.\n\nClass, a means of defining how high an Org (Scientology\n\norganization), Auditor (Scientology therapist), C/S (Case\n\nSupervisor, a person who oversees Auditors), etc. is on the Bridge\n\n(Scientology's chart of levels of enlightenment); corresponds to\n\nLevel or Grade, qv. See Bridge.\n\nClass IV Org, now called Class V Org. See Class V Org.\n\nClass V Org, the most common Scientology organizations; most major\n\nurban centers in the Western world have one. They are senior to\n\nmissions or franchises, but otherwise at the bottom rung of the\n\ncommand channels.

Horrors! It simply means the inability to fit\n\ntwo disparate concepts into one's mind. For example, a dichotomy\n\nlike \"I spent $360,000 dollars for all this\" and \"It is all a bunch\n\nof garbage.\" The flip side of cognitive dissonance is that if you\n\nget someone to do something, it is easier to make them believe\n\nsomething, and vice versa. Actions influence thoughts, and thoughts\n\ninfluence actions. One person adds: \"I thought this was more akin\n\nto warping reality to maintain a belief system. For instance you\n\nbuy a car that has all the features you consider to be good in a\n\ncar, but your friend buys a superior car which costs the same\n\namount. You have cognitive dissonance and berate the other car by\n\nwarping factual information to make your purchase more appealing\n\nthan perhaps it factually is.\" In this sense, it is a component of\n\nthe psychological influence that keeps people in Scientology; they\n\nwarp the reality of the utter worthlessness of the auditing\n\n\"technology\" after paying so much for it. It becomes very hard to\n\nlet go of something after making such a huge to commitment to it,\n\nwhether that commitment is psychological, spiritual, monetary, the\n\ninvestment of time, or something similar. Webster's 9th New\n\nCollegiate says: \"cognitive dissonance n (1963) psychological\n\nconflict resulting from incongruous ideas and attitudes held\n\nsimultaneously.\" The conflict is resolved via the distortion of the\n\nperception of reality. Eric Bohlman: \"...it is almost a textbook\n\nexample of attempts to resolve cognitive dissonance. A classic\n\nsocial psychology experiment is to take a bunch of people who have\n\njust bought new cars and present them with product brochures from\n\nvarious car companies. Inevitably they'll spend most of their time\n\nreading the brochures for the cars that they bought, and will give\n\nonly cursory glances to the brochures for the competing models.\n\nSomebody who has just made a major commitment (such as spending a\n\nlot of money) is likely to seek out information that would portray\n\nthe commitment as a good decision and avoid information that would\n\ncall the decision into question, because the alternative is to\n\nbelieve that they've been duped, which would be damaging to their\n\nself-images.\"\n\nCommand Intention, what upper management wants done; meant to imply\n\nthat Scientology's management is able to \"make it go right\",\n\ninfallible, and quite capable of achieving anything. The peons only\n\nworries are seeing to it that they jump high enough when ordered.\n\nSee Intention, Counter-intention.\n\nCommodore, the name Hubbard gave himself, no doubt based upon his\n\nstellar naval career. \"A picture of the Commodore hangs in every\n\nAcademy.\" See \"Ron.\"\n\nComm Ev, a Committee of Evidence; a cult \"justice\" action. \"Fred\n\nwas declared at his Comm Ev; now he's an SP, and subject to Fair\n\nGame.\"\n\nConditions, the Ethics formulas of Scientology. They are, in\n\ndescending order, Power, Power Change, Affluence, Normal Operation,\n\nEmergency, Danger, Non-Existence, Liability, Doubt, Enemy, Treason,\n\nConfusion. All the conditions have formulas, and they are designed\n\nto get cult members to produce more, ie, make more money for\n\nScientology. Thus, conditions are deemed very important, and\n\nScientologists are often seen scurrying about trying \"improve their\n\ncondition.\"\n\nControl, a metaphysical Scientology construct. Control is worked\n\ninto low-level therapy like Op pro by Dup to get the \"raw meat\"\n\nused to the idea of someone controlling him or her to a high\n\ndegree. Control is exerted on every action and step taken by the\n\nScientology newcomer; with what amounts to supreme arrogance,\n\nScientologists assume that ordinary people, (whom it disparages as\n\nmere \"wogs\"), are simply incapable of wiping their own ass, and are\n\ntherefore subject to full control by them. This is manifested as\n\n\"body routing\", and it is the justification for hard-selling the PC\n\nonto his or her next level immediately after taking a \"therapy\"\n\nsession. See Tone 40, Intention, Postulate.\n\nCoS, Church of Scientology. Also, C of S, CofS, COS, Co$.

A\n\nserious problem exists in our society as a result of the emergence\n\nof groups, popularly called cults, using mind control (undue\n\ninfluence) and unethical means to recruit and retain followers.\n\nAssociation with these groups can be harmful to followers and\n\ndisruptive to families, friends and society. MARKS OF A DESTRUCTIVE\n\nCULT: -Mind Control (undue influence): Manipulation by use of\n\ncoercive persuasion or behavior modification techniques without\n\ninformed consent. -Charismatic Leadership: Claiming divinity or\n\nspecial knowledge and demanding unquestioning obedience with power\n\nand privilege.

Dead Agent; to spread malicious lies and rumors about an\n\nAnti-Scientologist person or organization, in an attempt to so\n\nthoroughly discredit them that everyone concerned will be disgusted\n\nwith them, and not listen to the information they have to give\n\nabout the cult. Many attempts to Dead Agent the recently destroyed\n\nCAN (the Cult Awareness Network) and FACTnet (Fight Against\n\nCoercive Tactics network; a BBS that supplies information about the\n\ncult) have been posted to ars.

Also used as a general\n\nderogatory term. \"These psychs are all DBs; without the tech, they\n\nwon't make it.\"\n\nDC-8, Douglas jet aircraft resembling the Boeing 707, and used for\n\ntrans-Atlantic flights starting in the late 1950s. Hubbard said\n\nthey were used millions of years ago as spaceships to ferry people\n\nabout the galactic confederation. Perhaps someday Scientology will\n\napply for a patent, and sue Douglas for copying their design?\n\nDCSI, Dianetic Clear Special Intensive, a a five hour auditing\n\nblock (as opposed to the usual 12 1/2 hours that auditing is\n\nusually sold in) that is essentially a date locate procedure for\n\nfinding the moment of the clear cognition for those going clear on\n\nDianetic auditing, which is said to happen in 2% of cases.\n\nDead Agenting, see D/A.\n\nDeclaring, the act of blacklisting within the cult; the result is\n\nan \"SP\" (Suppressive Person, someone who does not like Scientology)\n\nwho can be \"Sued, tricked, lied to, or destroyed\" as per the cult's\n\npolicy. \"Eric was declared Suppressive at his Comm Ev.\"\n\nDed, another name for an overt, a harmful act one does to another\n\nthat comes before justification of the act.\n\nDedex, another name for a motivator, an instance of blaming another\n\nfor a crime you have committed yourself, or finding some\n\njustification for your aggressive or harmful actions that you are\n\ncommitting at present in your victim's previous actions.\n\nDegraded Being, see DB.\n\nDeprogramming, a desperate ploy to recover lost children involved\n\nin a cult, usually at the parent's behest; employs kidnaping and\n\ncoercive persuasion to re-invoke the cult victim's former\n\npersonality from before involvement.

A particle (a person or form) sent\n\nunnecessarily to the improper terminal; a waste of time or an item\n\nwhich slows down the all-important production inside Scientology.\n\nDianazene, a formula combined with vitamins and other materials\n\n(such as benzedrine) to make the intake of nicotinic acid more\n\neffective. Dianazene runs out radiation - or what appears to be\n\nradiation. It also proofs a person up [sic] against radiation to\n\nsome degree. It also turns on and runs out incipient cancer. (All\n\nAbout Radiation, pp. 123-124) Strangely, Hubbard thought that drugs\n\nwere destructive enough to warrant a Purification Rundown to try to\n\neliminate them. See also Guk Bomb, Purif, Drug Rundown.\n\nDianetic auditing, a quack therapy process based on Hubbard's book,\n\n_Dianetics: the Modern Science of Mental Health_ (DMSMH), written\n\nin 1950, and later volumes. Also called book one auditing.\n\nDianetic Clear Special Intensive, see DCSI.\n\nDianetics, Hubbard's derivative (of Freud's abreactive therapy,\n\namong others) mental healing therapy; scorned by the mental health\n\nprofession as being unscientific nonsense. Strangely, even though\n\nHubbard used mainstream psychiatry as a source for Dianetics, he\n\nwent on to vehemently attack psychiatry and its practice with\n\nparanoid fervor.\n\nDisconnection, the act of severing ties with family, friends, and\n\nloved ones that the cult often forces its victims to do when these\n\nsame loved ones are declared SPs, Suppressive Persons, (often for\n\nexpressing doubts about the victim's involvement in the cult) which\n\nthe victim then supposedly becomes PTS, a Potential Trouble Source\n\nfor Scientology, to. \"I was ordered to disconnect from my wife\n\nafter she was declared.\" See SP, PTS.\n\nDivisions, sections of the Org Board, the Scientology Organization\n\nlayout showing positions within the bureaucracy that Hubbard used\n\nto define all the posts in an Org. Various Org Boards were\n\nutilized, some with seven Divisions (Divs), some with nine; they\n\nare kept on a wall in the Organizations, and drilled each morning.\n\nDiv 1, HCO; Hubbard Communications Office. Also, Div One, etc.\n\nDiv 2, Dissemination.\n\nDiv 3, The treasury; money being so important it deserves its own\n\nspecial division in Scientology.\n\nDiv 4, Tech.

Also called the poodle.\n\n(ars)\n\nDMSMH, Dianetics [sic, should be dianoetics], the Modern [sic,\n\noutdated] Science [sic!] of Mental Health [sic!]; Hubbard's first\n\nforay into his newly invented \"Science\" of mental health, and the\n\nlaunchpad for the cult of Scientology, misspelled from dianoetic,\n\nmeaning intellectual; pounded out in a few weeks on a typewriter in\n\n1950 without even a hint of research. Also called Book One. Should\n\nbe: Dianoetics, the old fashioned pseudoscience that creates mental\n\nproblems.\n\nDn, Dianetics. See Dianetics.\n\nDoingness, the act of doing something.

Noun;\n\nreferring to Down Stat individuals; people who are not doing well\n\nin a Scientological sense, that is, cranking out enough product.\n\n\"Farnham is a real downstat; look at how miserable he looks on\n\npost.

(act)\n\nDrug Rundown, there are two of these, one at the bottom of the\n\nBridge, one near the top. While the Purification Rundown is meant\n\nto remove the drugs residues supposedly stored in your fat, the\n\nDrug Rundown is meant to audit out the harmful effects of drugs on\n\nyour mind. It is all very spiritual. (Or is that medical? Or should\n\nthat be financial?) See Grades, OT 4, Purif. See also Dianazene,\n\nGuk Bomb, for comparison. Two things seem to be pulling in\n\ndifferent directions here; on the one hand you have Hubbard trying\n\nto cleanse drugs out of the system with his Purification Rundown,\n\nand on the other hand there is his admitted use of drug compounds\n\non his guinea-pig followers.\n\nDSA, the Department of Special Affairs, an office that acts as the\n\nlocal outlet for OSA in Class V orgs. See OSA.\n\nDuplicate, to make an exact copy of; to fully understand in order\n\nto obey. \"You are Out-Ethics, Mr.!

Ron Hubbard\n\nEDs were written by L. Ron Hubbard himself.\n\nED INT, Executive Director International, the head of the Exec\n\nStrata, currently Guillaume Lesevre.

The ED\n\nINT can be written to at: Executive Director International, 4833\n\nFountain Avenue Los Angeles, California, 90027. There are also\n\nmessage boxes for the ED INT in each org. He replies, too, or\n\nsomeone does in his name. This is the SO-1 line (qv) now that\n\nHubbard is dead.\n\nE-Meter, or Meter, electrometer or electropsychometer. A crude\n\nbattery -powered analog ohmmeter used to locate Overts (undisclosed\n\nacts), Body Thetans (evil spirits), and Engrams (moments of pain\n\nand unconsciousness). The PC or patient holds the soup-cans\n\nelectrodes, while the Auditor or Scientology therapist watches the\n\nneedle on the dial. Circuitry is based on the Wheatstone Bridge.\n\nThe meter was designed by Volney Mathieson. Current \"top of the\n\nline\" models sell for about $4,000 US in a plastic case. Actual\n\nparts list is about $50-$100, making it a good money earner for\n\nScientology, particularly since every auditor is required to own\n\ntwo in case one breaks down.\n\nEnd Words, words that act like mental locks to keep the reactive\n\nmind, the chain of memory incidents of a harmful nature, keyed-in\n\nor in an active state.\n\nEngram, a posited memory trace that remains after a moment of pain\n\nand unconsciousness. Hubbard didn't coin this word; it can be found\n\nin Webster's, and is part of the ISV, the International Scientific\n\nVocabulary.\n\nEntheta, enturbulated theta. Bad Vibes. \"This Usenet newsgroup is\n\nso full of entheta that it is restimulating my bank.\"\n\nEnturbulated, Hubbardese for being upset. \"Suzy found ars so\n\nenturbulating, she ran away.\"\n\nEOC, 1.

Per\n\npolicy, all recruits must finish a course called \"Product Zero\" and\n\na 7A Security Check.\n\nEthics, a section of a Scientology Org (organization) that keeps\n\npeople in line, and the Hubbardian policy that deals with it. \"Keep\n\nyour nose clean, or I'll route you to Ethics, Mr.!\"\n\nEUS, Eastern US. See CLO.\n\nEvil Purpose, an implanted evil goal given to us millions or\n\nbillions or trillions of years ago in Implant stations (there is\n\none on Mars, you'll be interested to know) and still influencing\n\nour everyday lives, according to Hubbard.\n\nExec Strata, see Senior Exec Strata.\n\nExit counseling, an ethical method of recovering people from\n\ndestructive cults, involving talking and giving out information in\n\na non-coercive manner. \"Combatting Cult Mind Control\" by Steve\n\nHassan best exemplifies the methodology. Compare Deprogramming.\n\nEx-Scientologist, a former member of the Scientology cult who has\n\nleft and has gained a greater understanding of what was done to\n\nthem in Hubbard's brainwashing machine, and who has a desire to see\n\nthe hidden truth behind Scientology's carefully constructed PR\n\nfacade exposed to the public. Most Ex-Scientologists do this for\n\nthe public interest, despite personal risk of harassment and\n\ngroundless defamation lawsuits from Scientology's Office of Special\n\nAffairs department and its small army of lawyers, agents, and PIs.\n\nWe have little or nothing to gain by going public with what we know\n\nabout the cult from the inside, and some of us will pay dearly for\n\nour devotion to the truth. We were lied to and ripped off by L. Ron\n\nHubbard, in both a spiritual and monetary sense, and we don't want\n\nto see anyone else manipulated the way we were. Scientology has in\n\nmany ways destroyed our lives; we would be less than human to stand\n\nidly by and watch as more \"raw meat\" public are ripped to shreds in\n\nScientology's money-making mill.\n\nExteriorize, to leave the body. Scientologists believe we can step\n\noutside our bodies in the form of a disembodied \"Thetan\" or spirit,\n\nand hover about looking at things. This is deemed to be a very\n\nimportant goal of every Scientologist, usually only obtained at the\n\nhighest \"OT level.\" OT VIIs and VIIIs who have left the cult claim\n\nit is an induced hallucination. \"Exteriorization is the goal of the\n\nEnd of Endless Int Rundown.\" See \"Interiorization.\"\n\nF:\n\nFacsimile, a mental image picture. \"June has a facsimile of a dog\n\nbiting her leg.\"\n\nFACTnet, Fight Against Coercive Tactics network; a cult information\n\nBBS with numerous files on the Scientology cult and others operated\n\nby Lawrence Wollersheim, and various other directors at various\n\ntimes including Bob Penny, Kim Baker, and Arnie (Arnaldo) Lerma.\n\nFACTNet has undergone a shift toward carrying the torch for free\n\nspeech on the Internet more recently after lengthy and expensive\n\nlitigation with Scientology.\n\nFair Game, the notorious Scientology policy describing how to deal\n\nwith critics, ex-members, and other undesirables dehumanized with\n\nthe label \"Suppressives\"; they may be \"Sued, tricked, lied to, or\n\ndestroyed,\" as per policy. A more recent policy has banished the\n\nWORDS \"Fair Game\", but the policy of what to do to these \"SPs\" or\n\n\"Suppressives\" cannot ever be cancelled, as it is Hubbardian\n\nscripture, and his words cannot ever be altered in any way per\n\nScientology's policy. \"Dennis Erlich, being an SP, is subject to\n\nFair Game.\"\n\nFall, a Meter read of about an inch movement to the left.\n\nF&F, the name of the mission that was sent to execute the programme\n\ntargets establishing the \"United Churches\" front (Flag) in\n\nClearwater, Florida.\n\nFastflow, able to zip through course checksheets because of\n\nsuperliteracy obtained from M1 word clearing and the Student Hat.\n\nFB, Flag Bureaux - Oversees all Sea Org service organizations and\n\nall Class V (formerly Class IV) organizations. - Jonathon Barbera.\n\nFCB, Flag Command Bureaux - In charge of internal management of\n\nupper middle management. - Jonathon Barbera.\n\nFDN, Foundation, qv.\n\nFDSing, False Data Stripping.

When the Sea Org (high level Scientologists who sign\n\nbillion-year contracts) came ashore in Clearwater, Florida, they\n\nset up the Flag Land Base, an upper-level Class XII Org, now just\n\ncalled Flag. \"I got my Ls at Flag, and my case was really cracked!\"\n\nFlag Executive Briefing Course, see FEBC.\n\nFLB, see Flag.\n\nFlub, a mistake made in the auditing \"therapy.\"\n\nFlubless, perfect auditing without errors; a \"star-high goal\" that\n\nis never achieved, as numerous therapy \"repairs\" point up.\n\nF/N, Floating Needle. A rhythmic swinging of the Meter needle back\n\nand forth indicating end of session, or completion of a \"therapy\"\n\nprocess. Also commonly used to indicate good vibes, as in \"I've\n\nbeen F/Ning all day!\"\n\nFO, Flag Order, a blue-on-white written directive similar to\n\nHubbard Communication Office Policy Letters, HCOPLs, for Sea Org\n\nmembers. There is a Sea Org Briefing Course which consists of all\n\nnon-confidential FOs still in use. Flag Orders are a vital policy\n\nline, as the Sea Org is the commanding and controlling organization\n\nin Scientology which runs as a thread throughout the entire cult.\n\nFolder, an Ethics (Scientology's corrections section) folder or\n\nAuditing \"therapy\" folder in which Scientology collects all the\n\ndirt on people obtained from auditing sessions and Ethics actions\n\nwhich can be used as blackmail to keep critics quiet. Culled\n\ninformation from folders of former Scientologists who have turned\n\ninto critics has a habit of showing up on ars.\n\nFOLO, Flag Operations Liaison Office. See Flag.\n\nFoundation, one of the two groups inside a Class V Org, which is a\n\nScientology organization that delivers lower level services.\n\nFoundation works the night and weekend shift, while Day works days.\n\n\"Sally works for Foundation, while Sam is Day.\" See Day.\n\nFPRD, False Purpose Rundown.\n\nFR or F/R, Flag Rep. A minor post in a Class V or lower level Org;\n\na liaison with Flag, an upper level Class XII organization. \"Ronald\n\nwas the FR from HAW FDN.\"\n\nFranchise, an old name used before the more appealing Newspeak\n\n\"Mission,\" qv. Franchise connotes the financial business aspects of\n\nScientology too much, and so the term \"Mission\" is now used to add\n\nmore religiosity. A Mission is a low level Scientology money making\n\norganization; a franchise, in other words. See Mission.\n\nFreedom, Scientology's newspeak-monikered propaganda newsletter,\n\nused for PR dissemination. See PR, good roads fair weather.\n\nFreeloader debt, a debt incurred by staff members who break their\n\n3, 5, or one billion year (in the Sea Org) contracts, and are thus\n\nrequired to pay for every auditing action and training course done\n\nto them while on staff. The freeloader debt usually runs into the\n\ntens of thousands, but cannot be collected in most cases as the\n\ncontract in not considered to be in good faith.\n\nFreewinds, the SO-run (Sea Org) ship that cruises around tropical\n\nports and gives the OT-8s (top level Scientologists) a hangout\n\nwhile they proceed with their auditing. Ah, how nice it must be to\n\nbe at the top of the Bridge on a Clear day!\n\nFree Zone, (also Freezone); a loose affiliation of people who still\n\nbelieve in some of the ideas of Scientology auditing procedures,\n\nbut who have left the formal structure of the cult in a type of\n\nScientology Reformation. The Free Zone is a little more liberal\n\nthan the hard-core Churchies, as they sometimes like to call people\n\nstill in the cult proper, yet they often still have the trappings\n\nof Scientology, for example, the E-Meter, Auditing, the concepts of\n\nEthics, Overts (bad deeds), Conditions, and the use of disparaging\n\nterms for outsiders, (Meatballs, Bashers, Wogs, etc.) The cult\n\nproper hates these splinterers and labels them \"squirrels\". Their\n\nnewsgroup is alt.clearing.technology; they also have their own\n\nperiodicals, such as the _Free Spirit_ and others. \"The \"Free Zone\"\n\nwas a term first used by Bill Robertson in the early 80s. Robertson\n\nwas a fan of LRH and set up a network of organizations that\n\ndelivered the CofS's upper and lower levels grades, including the\n\nClearing Course, OT levels and NOTs, at a cut-rate.\" - Joe\n\nHarrington.\n\nFree Zoner, (also Freezoner); a member of the Free Zone, qv.\n\nOpinion is split on whether this term is or is not derogatory. Some\n\npeople are happy to be called Free Zoners, and apply the term to\n\nthemselves. Others claim it is derogatory when used by critics, but\n\nthis may be a confusion with attitudes as expressed in sentences\n\nand simple nouns. Does a sentence like \"Canadians are politically\n\nstupid liberals\" make the term \"Canadian\" a derogatory term? Free\n\nZoners have been called deluded for still adhering to Hubbardian\n\nviews and holding the vile man in high regard; I do not believe\n\nthat this can make the term itself derogatory, but others feel\n\ndifferently about it. The term did not arise within the critical\n\narena, which sheds further doubt on the derogatory label\n\nhypothesis.\n\nFSM, Field Staff Member. Mercenaries who recruit people using\n\nselection slips for Scientology and get a 15% profit of the value\n\nof services purchased by their recruits in return.\n\nFSO, 1. Flag Ship Organization. In reality this has been various\n\nships and locations over the last 30 years. 2. FSO also means Flag\n\nService Org which is in Clearwater, FL and is usually referred to\n\nas simply Flag. \"FSO - Flag Service Organization - Highest level\n\ntraining organization in the world and can deliver the processing\n\nside of the Bridge up to New OT VII. Located in Clearwater,\n\nFlorida, USA.\" - Jonathon Barbera.\n\nFSSO, Flag Ship Service Organization, Clearwater, FL. The Flag Ship\n\nwas the Apollo in Hubbard's day, now it is the Freewinds out\n\ncruising the Caribbean. OT 8 is done on the FSSO, the Freewinds.\n\nFZ, see Free Zone. (act)\n\nG:\n\nGang-Bang Sec Check, a cruel process involving getting the victim\n\nto confess to \"crimes\" or Overts while on a meter and in front of a\n\ngroup of people. Used as a heavy brainwashing technique when a PC\n\nthreatens to blow. \"Three people in the past year have said they\n\nhave had Gang-Bang Sec Checks recently.\"\n\nGE, Genetic Entity. A low-grade soul that stores whole track\n\nengrams (memories of pain and unconsciousness from the last few\n\ntrillion years of the patient's life) like the clam incident\n\n(people descended from clams, according to Hubbard.) The concept of\n\nthe GE can be hard to understand until one realizes that it is\n\nunadulterated nonsense, like much of Scientology.\n\nGI, 1. Gross Income. One of the most important Stats (statistics)\n\nfor cult groups. 2. Good Indicators; a smiling face after an\n\nauditing or \"therapy\" action.\n\nGO, the Guardian's Office. The cult's KGB, responsible for\n\nattacking SPs, (qv) publishing Dead Agent materials (largely\n\nmanufactured dirty laundry on perceived enemies), framing political\n\nfigures and judges, intimidating witnesses, etc. Now renamed OSA,\n\nthe Office of Special Affairs, qv.\n\nGodwin's Law, a rhetorical construct that postulates that the mere\n\nmention of the holocaust in an argument renders it null and void,\n\nas the slaughter of seven million Jews in WWII is a singularly\n\nmomentous and ghastly historical event. Some people stretch the law\n\nto apply to mentioning Nazis and the Third Reich generally in any\n\ndebate, but this is a dubious over-extension at best. \"You are\n\ncomparing the RPF to Nazi concentration camps? I hereby invoke\n\nGodwin's Law!\"\n\nGold, this has been used to refer to both Golden Era Studios and\n\nGold base, now usually referred to as INT, as most INT orgs have\n\nrelocated there. In the Sea Org we used to refer to GOLD as \"over\n\nthe rainbow\", and meant a \"secret\" location in Hemet. - Miss X.\n\n\"Golden Era Productions, in charge of producing e-meters, films,\n\ntelevision advertisements, and lectures on cassettes. Includes PDO\n\n(Planetary Dissemination Org).\" - Jonathon Barbera. Note: E-Meters\n\nwere also produced by Bridge. Grady Ward: \"My first impression of\n\nGold Base as Keith Henson drove me through it on Monday is that it\n\nlooked exactly like a Nazi theme park. A delightful little\n\ncaricature of a Scientology 'church' with a flowering bed in front\n\nof it - surrounded by the nastiest razor wire, floodlights, and\n\nvideo observation cameras I have ever seen.\"\n\nGolden Age of Tech, the. Releases from 1996 reportedly sharpen up\n\nauditing. Apparently the \"100% Standard Tech\" sold to public over\n\nthe last several years was not standard after all. The changes to\n\nunalterable tech include: a revamping of the E-meter with a\n\nvariable gain; a student certainty course covering the barriers to\n\nstudy, parts of the student hat, the TRs, and the metering courses;\n\nthe Golden Age of Tech Drills which are rote handlings compiled\n\nfrom HCOBs and put in quiz/drill form for training on a twin basis\n\nfor grades and solo auditing courses; a read generator has been\n\nadded to the E-meter; and more emphasis on study and drilling to\n\nthe point of not having to think about what to do in a particular\n\nsituation.\n\nGood roads, fair weather. A PR technique which all Scientologists\n\nare instructed in to automatically handle criticisms with bland\n\nstatements about other things. The idea is to discuss something\n\n\"non-reactive\" to the person, and also steer the topic away from\n\nScientology, a topic Scientologists are indoctrinated to not\n\ndiscuss in any depth for obvious reasons. See PR.\n\nGOSA, see OSA.\n\nGPM, Goals Problems Mass. A supposed mass which develops when one\n\nis thwarted from reaching a Goal by a Problem or stop.\n\nGrades, preliminary steps to the true enlightenment and\n\nunderstanding of Body Thetans (evil spirits inhabiting the body) on\n\nthe OT (Operating Thetan; a person as a spirit able to operate free\n\nof the body) levels. The Grades range from 0, learning to talk, to\n\nVII, clear certainty, and come before clear (a person who is freed\n\nfrom the effects of the Reactive Mind; the place where all the\n\nmemories of pain and unconsciousness are stored) on the Bridge.\n\nActions before the Grades usually include Life repair, Purification\n\nrundown (which involves sweating in a sauna, running, and taking\n\nvitamin overdoses for a fee of $2,000) and the Drug Rundown, said\n\nto remove the harmful effects of drugs by using the E-Meter. The\n\ntypical sequence for processing then goes up the numbered Grades.\n\nSee also Class, Bridge, Level.\n\nGrade 0, learn to communicate with anyone about anything. Too bad\n\nno one in Scientology has reached this level! See Class 0.\n\nGrade 1, (I) learn to handle your Problems, as long as they don't\n\ninclude being a victim of a money-grubbing cult.\n\nGrade 2, (II) Overts and Withholds, your dirty laundry aired in\n\npublic. Don't tell them anything you wouldn't mind posted to Usenet\n\nor given out in pamphlets to your neighbors, co-workers and\n\nfriends.\n\nGrade 3, (III) deals with Upsets.\n\nGrade 4, (IV) Service Facsimiles, \"I'm right and you're wrong\" type\n\nof blaming behavior. Guess that lots of people in this \"church\"\n\nneed it. See Ser Fac.\n\nGrade 4.5, (recently, last decade or so, New Era Dianetics (NED,\n\nqv) was put here. If the mark 'goes clear' on new era dianetics\n\nthen grades 5, 6, and 7 are skipped. The person does a simple\n\nprocess called the sunshine rundown, and goes on to OT 1) (No; the\n\ncult doesn't call it Grade 4.5. This is where it would be\n\nlogically.)\n\nGrade 5, (V) Power, awareness of self as source. I got the Power,\n\nyeah, yeah. Just keep repeating it; you couldn't really be wasting\n\nthousands of dollars, could you? After all, this is America! You\n\nshould be able to buy spiritual freedom! (God knows, you can buy\n\neverything else.) See Power processing.\n\nGrade 6, preparation for the Clearing Course. R6EW, Routine Six,\n\nEnd Words. Meant to release the locks from the reactive mind. End\n\nWords are a kind of verbal lock that keeps the reactive mind or\n\nwhatever in restimulation; more pseudoscience on parade. See R6EW.\n\nGrade 7, Clearing course. Wow! At last you can throw away your\n\nglasses, a la Bates! You'll have perfect recall of what you ate for\n\ndinner! Your IQ will zoom! Your eyes will become glazed! Your\n\npockets will be feeling a severe drain! (Unless your last name is\n\nGates.) You're now ready for OT 1; last chance for cognitive\n\ndissonance before the railroad to Total Freedom (tm) routes you\n\nstraight to hell, or a close approximation thereof, and all for\n\njust $129.99$!

See Clear\n\nCertainty Rundown.\n\nGradient, a gradual approach to brainwashing that Scientology\n\nemploys so as not to scare off potential recruits. Things like\n\nOT-III, widely available over the net, are deemed to be\n\n\"out-gradient\", as they drive away raw recruits because they look\n\nlike insane gibberish sputtered from the foaming mouth of a\n\nbrain-fevered baboon. Also called a \"gradient scales approach\".\n\nDeviating from this tech is called going \"out gradient\"; a serious\n\nerror.\n\nGreen Vols, the green volumes of the OEC (Organization Executive\n\nCourse; a high-level and very expensive course that teaches\n\nexecutives how to manage an organization. Used to siphon money from\n\nClass V Orgs, lower level Orgs, uplines to higher level Orgs that\n\nrun the course) that contain Scientology policy.

All\n\nInternational management (upper middle management above continents\n\nand below *INT* - see Int) is located in this building. It is a\n\ntwenty minute walk from the Cedars Complex, and houses IHELP, OSA\n\nInt, and the CMO IXU (Internal eXtension Unit), WISE Int, ABLE Int,\n\nand more. The various orgs on different floors in 1993 looked like\n\nthis: 12th floor - OSA Int (includes office of the President of\n\nCSI). 11th - CMO IXU, AVU Int, confidential space. 10th - FCB,\n\nNetworks. 9th - FB. 8th - FB, IHELP Int, SMI Int. 7th - WISE Int,\n\nABLE Int. 6th - Dining room, canteen. 5th through 1st - ITO. 1st -\n\nLRH Exhibit, lobby.

See Clam.\n\nHubborg, (also Huborg) a pun combining Hubbard + Star Trek's\n\n\"Borg\", as Scientologists are seen to have a collective hive\n\nmentality at times akin to the science-fiction Borg. It has also\n\nbeen claimed that it is a combination of Hubbard + Org [anization],\n\nwith an earlier genesis; it is possible that it has had two\n\ndistinct origins. \"They've been assimilated into the Hubborg\n\nCollective.\"\n\nI:\n\nIAS, International Association of Scientologists. The first six\n\nmonths is free; after that, it gets very expensive.

Auditing is only for the able, or people\n\nwho don't need help, as per policy; it is for making the able more\n\nable, or bilking them for more money. This paradox is explained by\n\nthe fact that people who actually need help are harder to turn a\n\nprofit on. Specifically, an Illegal PC is one who has had\n\npsychiatric treatments in the past, or appears to Scientologists\n\nlike they have (a streetperson or prostitute, for example) and is\n\ndeemed too damaged to touch, and a serious security risk to boot.\n\n\"Jack Farmer is an Illegal PC; he may not receive the next auditing\n\nlevel he needs and wants.\"\n\nImplant, a hypnotic suggestion smashed into one's mind millions or\n\nbillions of years ago in Hubbard's Space-Opera Scientology\n\nCosmology. \"One Implant was installed using giant movie screens.\"\n\nIncident One, 4 quadrillion years ago we were implanted with\n\nvisions of cherubs blowing horns, chariots, and blackness.

Don't\n\nlet that stop you from believing, and anteing up the hundreds of\n\nthousands of dollars it takes to get to this level of brainwashing.\n\nIncident Two, 75 million years ago Xenu, the evil galactic\n\noverlord, froze us, then blew us up with H-bombs on Hawaii,\n\nremember? Also called the wall of fire, or the OT 3 incident. The\n\ncover of Dianetics is meant to symbolize this cataclysmic event,\n\nand compel Wogs to buy the book by restimulating them.\n\nINCOMM, Shown on the official Command Channels chart as Central\n\nComputer Banks (CCB), but this is a part of INCOMM's Division 4\n\n(Tech/Production).

Involves locking the person up to prevent bad PR with the\n\nisolation step, also called baby watch. Sometimes instilling such\n\nwacky ideas as Xenu, Body Thetans and OT III can make people a bit\n\nunstable; the IRD is used to contain people when they flip out.\n\nInvalidation, to belittle or make nothing of. \"Andy felt so\n\ninvalidated by the SPs on ars, he caved in, and left.\"\n\nIso, see Introspection Rundown.\n\nIsolation, Isolation Step, see Introspection Rundown.\n\nIssue Authority, the right to publish certain of L.

These were designed to handle psychosis,\n\nalthough now they are used for all Scientologists who are wealthy\n\nenough to afford them. The Ls material mentions the fact that the\n\nReactive Mind, the storehouse of engrams or memories of pain and\n\nunconsciousness, is composed solely of Body Thetans or evil\n\nspirits. See the individual Ls.\n\nM:\n\nM1, or M1 Word Clearing, one of the 9 methods of the endless word\n\nclearing used in Scientology. M1 is done on a Meter, and locates\n\ncharge or upset on words chains by subject, taking each back in\n\ntime (often to fabricated past lives). M1 supposedly makes the\n\nrecipient \"Superliterate\", able to \"fast flow\" through course\n\nchecksheets without doing demos or checkouts. See also M8.\n\nM2, metered word clearing done by having the student read aloud,\n\nthen look up each word stumbled over or that reads on the meter.\n\nM3, verbal word clearing done by the supervisor in the classroom\n\nand used whenever a student says s/he doesn't understand something.\n\nThe sup then asks them to look earlier for a word that isn't\n\nunderstood, (the implication of Hubbard's perfection being\n\nimplicit; if Hubbard wasn't clear or used the wrong word, this is\n\njust not acknowledged) has the student look it up in a dictionary,\n\nand then use it in sentences in the usual way. M3 is one of the\n\nmost commonly-used methods of word clearing, along with M4 and\n\nself-study. In self-study, every word found is looked up, used in\n\nsentences, and cleared in each definition, pronunciation, and the\n\nderivation, as in all word clearing. \"Set\" is checked in all its\n\npermutations that were known already since childhood. \"To\" is\n\ndiligently looked up, although it has little or no intrinsic\n\nmeaning. \"The\" and \"a\" and \"an\" are all checked repeatedly,\n\n\"definitions\" memorized without being understood for the next\n\nsupervisor star-rate checkout. For all their word-clearing,\n\nScientologists are not particularly adept at language, missing the\n\nfact that most words are learned via context and use, not endless\n\nconsultation of dry, dead, dictionaries. The average student in\n\nScientology may spend hours each day flipping through the\n\ndictionaries, yet they don't seem to benefit from the activity at\n\nall. \"Word clearing\" is an integral part of the brainwashing in the\n\ncult. Its real aim is to make people compliant by doing absurd and\n\nmeaningless repetitive tasks while instilling the cult's twisted\n\nsemantics and thousands of neologisms and redefinitions from the\n\ntwo large cult dictionaries of such key terms as \"critical\n\nthought\", redefined as a completely negative activity. It is\n\nOrwell's _1984_ brought to life by another, albeit inferior,\n\nScience Fiction writer.\n\nM4, metered classroom word clearing. The student is asked to focus\n\non sections of text of about paragraph to page size and asked if\n\nthere's an MU, then the meter is checked for any reaction. The word\n\nso metaphysically located is then looked up and cleared in the\n\nusual way. M4 is one of the most common forms of word clearing,\n\nalong with M3 and self-study, as the students works by themselves\n\nto \"clear up their MUs\". Not clearing up one's own MUs may result\n\nin ethics actions being taken for going by MUs, a serious offense.\n\nThis is another cult catch-22 situation, as all students can be\n\nasked for definitions of words like \"be\" or something equally\n\nridiculous, hesitate, and end up in trouble. During star-rate\n\ncheckouts, definitions are often demanded out of the blue. \"What's\n\nthe definition of 'too'?\", \"The number 2?\", \"Flunk!\" being a common\n\noccurrence with no recourse given. Any opposition to the obvious\n\nunfairness of the situation just gets the person in more hot water\n\nin the totalitarian system. Any opposition or complaints are, after\n\nall, a sign of 'natter' produced by, you guessed it, MUs! Word\n\nclearing is an integral part of Scientology brainwashing.\n\nM5, the student is asked what words mean from a list, as in\n\nauditing commands. The ones the person can't define quickly and\n\naccurately are flunked.\n\nM6, key word clearing. The most important words relating to a\n\nspecific post are looked up and word cleared in a dictionary upon\n\nany hint of slowness or hesitancy on the part of the staff member.\n\nThis is based on the idea that so-called \"MUs\" can thwart someone's\n\nproduction on post; an untested idea, to put it mildly.\n\nM7, used for illiterates, children, and foreign-language persons.\n\nThe student is made to read aloud, and at each omission or stumble\n\nor hesitation or frown, the word is explained to the person\n\nverbally or looked up for him or her by the twin or word clearer.\n\nM8, part of the Primary Rundown, its end product is superliteracy.\n\nAn alphabetical list of every word in the materials being studied,\n\nsuch as a book or tape, is looked up. This is the most thorough\n\nmethods of W/Cing. Its requirement for the exalted state of\n\n\"superliteracy\" has been superseded by M1, or was at one time in\n\nthe cult.\n\nM9, unmetered word clearing action. Student is made to read the\n\ntext aloud while the word clearer follows along in another copy of\n\nthe text. When the student stumbles or frowns or coughs, etc., the\n\nword is thoroughly looked up and \"cleared\" by the usual method.\n\nMAA, Master At Arms. A Sea Org (highly indoctrinated Scientologists\n\nwho sign billion-year contracts) Ethics Officer, responsible for\n\nkeeping Ethics in (keeping the all-important production up; someone\n\nwho produces well in Scientology is almost always regarded as being\n\nin-Ethics; the ends justify the means is policy.) Their lower org\n\nequivalent is called an Ethics Officer, or EO.\n\nMarcab Confederacy, a galactic confederation and the denizens\n\nthereof. It is a star system in the astronomy charts. It is also\n\nsupposed to be the source of most of the destructive suppressive\n\ninfluences attacking the Earth at this time and in the past. For\n\nthe last 100,000 years they've been driving cars, wearing business\n\nsuits and fedora hats, using telephones, and flying spaceships.\n\nRemember that episode of Star Trek? \"The Marcabians are coming to\n\nEarth, and they're going to lay waste to it, according to Captain\n\nBill.\"\n\nMeatball, A derogatory Free Zone (qv) term for people who don't\n\nbelieve in their strange ideas.

Seen as a\n\nlesser domain than the spiritual or Theta realm.\n\nMilgram Experiment, the; a psychological influence process. \"A very\n\nfamous psychology experiment with a rather depressing result.\n\nMilgram's subjects were put in front of a device that was supposed\n\nto administer electric shocks to someone in another room (the other\n\nperson was actually an actor who responded as if he were being\n\nshocked) and were then ordered by Milgram to administer increasing\n\nlevels of shocks, even levels that were marked as 'dangerous' on\n\nthe device and that elicited a simulation of agony from the actor.\n\nHe found that most of his subjects obeyed him, even when they\n\ngenerally believed that they were injuring the other person. The\n\nexperiment basically showed that the 'Nuremberg defense' mindset is\n\nalive and well in the US; people are conditioned to obey authority\n\nand will compromise their own principles to do so. The experiment\n\nwas done in the late '60s or early '70s; I doubt things have gotten\n\nbetter since then. Remember that most Americans now think of the\n\nlate '60s and early '70s as one of the worst periods in American\n\nhistory, and cite 'lack of respect for authority' as one of the\n\nmain reasons for why it was so terrible.\" - Eric Bohlman. Read\n\nObedience to Authority: An Experimental View, by Stanley Milgram\n\n(Harper & Row, 1974).\n\nMisemotional, describing a display of inappropriate emotion; for\n\nexample, crying for no reason. \"Mary has been misemotional since\n\nher last action; she needs a repair.\"\n\nMission, 1. the Newspeak-corrected term for a cult franchise, as\n\nHubbard originally and more accurately called them before the\n\n\"religious angle\" was adopted to garner tax breaks for his company.\n\nLast heard, the package used to set up a Mission could be bought\n\nfor US $56,000. A year or two ago, the Co$ management gloated that\n\n1,000 mission franchises had been sold at $56,000 each. That works\n\nout to $56,000,000 all told. If the cult's total annual gross is\n\n$300,000,000, then this one source accounts for nearly 1/5. These\n\nfranchises are meant to pay their owners 15%, trouble is, if your\n\nMission ever makes it, it will be taken away from you. Missions\n\ncannot train auditors, but they can deliver low-level courses and\n\nprocessing; they are meant to send their \"products\" on to the next\n\nhigher org on the ladder, the nearest Class V Org. 2. A set of\n\norders given to Missionaires (Sea Org members sent to clay demo and\n\nthen carry out some orders) to go out and do an action, usually\n\ngathering money from low-level Scientology Orgs, getting back\n\n\"blown\" staff members, and so forth. Missions are notoriously\n\nviolent in their methods, and lower-level orgs live in fear of\n\ngetting a set of these Sea Org bully-boys with their daggers and\n\nuniforms in to \"put in their ethics\" (make them fork over more\n\nmoney) and \"get their stats up\" with intimidation tactics. Missions\n\nare sometimes given absolute ethics authority, meaning they are\n\nallowed to do anything to \"get ethics in\".\n\nMissionaire, a Sea Org member specially trained to do a Mission,\n\nand given orders, (which are often clay-demoed) and sent out to get\n\nsomething done. \"The Missionaires from Up-Lines arrived, and\n\ndemanded $25,000 from our local Org.\"\n\nMisunderstood, misuderstood word, see M/U, M3, M4.\n\nMock Up, to make up; particularly mental imagery, but may also\n\napply to physical things. Scientologists may often confuse external\n\nreality with imagination or fantasy, and may well not see the\n\ndifference between imagining a wall, and taking a hammer and nails\n\nand building one. \"Mock up a wall. Thank you. Now destroy that\n\nwall. Thank you.\"\n\nMotivator, a nasty thing that one \"pulls in\" as a result of having\n\nprior overts, undisclosed naughty acts. In other words, anything\n\nthat happens to you is your own fault; you deserved it because you\n\nare essentially evil. \"The cult of Scientology has lots of\n\nmotivators; they keep saying 'look what they did to us!'\"\n\nM/U, Mis-U, or MU; a misunderstood word, meant to cause everything\n\nfrom blows (sudden departures) to overts and withholds, and\n\nactually being the root cause of SPs. Because of the centricity of\n\n\"MUs\" and their destructive potential it is a crime to go by them\n\nwhen studying, and subjects the student to the risk of getting a\n\nkangaroo \"court of ethics\". The cult is fanatical about not going\n\nby one, and insists that everyone look things up endlessly in\n\ndictionaries and go through every definition. This becomes quite\n\ntedious with words like \"to\", \"set\", and \"be.\" Extensive pieces of\n\nthe \"tech\" are devoted to \"word clearing\", qv, and so the hapless\n\nstudent ends up trapped in a arbitrary system which may punish or\n\nhelp, punish or help, alternately, with the word clearing or the\n\nethics actions. The very definition of \"MU\" is mutable and\n\narbitrary in that it is a word that makes one frown or blink or\n\nstumble on or slow down on reading, etc., as spotted by others -\n\nall of this adds to the coercive, conforming, and group- pressure\n\nnature of the beast. See M3, M4 for more on this topic. \"Look up\n\nyour M/Us and quit your nattering Mister, or I'll have you busted\n\ndown to Ethics!\"\n\nM/U Phenomena, the emotional upset leading to Blows, disappearances\n\nfrom the organization, that follows going by a misunderstood word,\n\naccording to the cult's \"study tech.\" M/U Phenomena is the only\n\nreason someone gives up on Scientology, according to Hubbard. If\n\nyou think it is all nonsense, it is because you went by a word you\n\ndidn't understand. If you think it is dangerous, and that the RPF\n\n(Rehabilitation Project Force; the cult's gulag) is repressive and\n\nsick, you just have an M/U. If you think the Purification Rundown\n\nis bizarre, you have an M/U, and it is your problem.

Natter is\n\nsaid to be caused by going past Misunderstood words, and having\n\nOverts or undisclosed bad acts, and can thus lead to Blows. \"If you\n\ndon't stop Nattering, you're going to the RPF!\"\n\nNED, New Era Dianetics.
