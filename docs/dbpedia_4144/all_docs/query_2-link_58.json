Colegio Los Arcos) broke a scoreless contest with his third score of the season.\n\nGrande put Radford up 1-0 in the 66th minute when he tracked down a lofted pass from Ramzi Dridi (Falls Church, Va. / JEB Stuart) over the Keydet defense that keeper Taylor Feuerstein slipped and fell leaving an open net for the sophomore.\n\nVMI's Kip Zechman made it a one-goal contest in the 74th minute with a blast from about 35-yards out.\n\nClinging to a 2-1 lead, Iyiola Awosika (London, England / Aylesbury Grammar) put the game out of reach when he beat Keydet defenders and ripped a low shot far post. Kevin Fleming (Centreville, Va. / Westfield) assisted on Awosika's team-leading eighth goal of the campaign.\n\nRadford had a number of scoring opportunities in the opening period, while outshooting the Keydets, 11-3.\n\nThe Highlanders' best look in the first half came off a through ball from Chel Ho Kim Park (Santander, Spain) to Awosika, who had his one-on-one attempt saved by Feuerstein.\n\n18 of Radford's 25 goals this season have come after intermission.\n\nThe Highlanders's final score was the result of an own goal.\n\nIn addition to controlling the shot column, 22-6, Radford held a 6-3 advantage in corner kicks.\n\nThe Highlanders will conclude their brief homestand Saturday evening with a 6 p.m. Homecoming Match against High Point. VMI hosts Gardner-Webb on Saturday at 4 p.m."
