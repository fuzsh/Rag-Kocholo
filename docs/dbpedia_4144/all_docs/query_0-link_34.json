Thus, we determined the effects of MXC and VIN on the dysregulation of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in WB-F344 rat liver epithelial cells. Both chemicals induced a rapid dysregulation of GJIC at non-cytotoxic doses, with 30 min EC50 values for GJIC inhibition being 10 µM for MXC and 126 µM for VIN. MXC inhibited GJIC for at least 24 h, while VIN effects were transient and GJIC recovered after 4 h. VIN induced rapid hyperphosphorylation and internalization of gap junction protein connexin43, and both chemicals also activated MAPK ERK1/2 and p38. Effects on GJIC were not prevented by MEK1/2 inhibitor, but by an inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC), resveratrol, and in the case of VIN, also, by a p38 inhibitor. Estrogen (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) modulators (estradiol, ICI 182,780, HPTE, testosterone, flutamide, VIN M2) did not attenuate MXC or VIN effects on GJIC. Our data also indicate that the effects were elicited by the parental compounds of MXC and VIN. Our study provides new evidence that MXC and VIN dysregulate GJIC via mechanisms involving rapid activation of PC-PLC occurring independently of ER- or AR-dependent genomic signaling. Such alterations of rapid intercellular and intracellular signaling events involved in regulations of gene expression, tissue development, function and homeostasis, could also contribute to transgenerational epigenetic effects of endocrine disruptors.\n\nKeywords: gap junctional intercellular communication, endocrine disruptors, mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, epigenetic toxicity, non-genomic signaling.\n\nMethoxychlor (MXC) and vinclozolin (VIN) represent well-recognized environmental endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). Xenoestrogenic MXC and antiandrogenic VIN have been demonstrated to induce adverse effects on development and function of both male and female reproductive system, neuroendocrine, and immune system, and to alter reproductive and social behavior (Manikkam et al., 2014; van Ravenzwaay et al., 2013). These chemicals affect not only prenatally or postnatally exposed organisms, but also alter epigenetic programming of germ cells and transmit their adverse effects from the exposed (grand)parental generations to unexposed offspring (Anway et al., 2005; Skinner, 2014).\n\nAs for many other EDCs, interactions with nuclear sex hormone receptors and their ligand-dependent transcription factor activity (so-called genomic signaling mechanism) have been implicated as the principal molecular mechanism responsible for endocrine disrupting activity of MXC and VIN (Manikkam et al., 2014; Ozgyin et al., 2015; van Ravenzwaay et al., 2013). Although MXC is a weak estrogen receptor (ER) agonist, its hydroxylated metabolites, such as HPTE (2,2-bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane), are potent ERα agonists and weak antagonists to both ERß and androgen receptor (AR) (Gaido et al., 2000). VIN and its major metabolites, M1 and M2, are potent antagonists of AR, and moderate agonists to progesterone and ERs (Molina-Molina et al., 2006). However, there is increasing evidence that endogenous hormones, as well as environmental EDCs, can also act via mechanisms of non-genomic signaling, which are independent of ligand-dependent transactivation function of nuclear receptors (Trevino et al., 2015; Watson et al., 2014; Wong and Walker, 2013). Non-genomic signaling mechanisms altered by EDCs include rapid modulations of ion levels or activities of ion channels, protein kinases, phospholipases, or adenylate cyclase. Coincidentally, alternations of these signaling events and pathways have been also implicated in dysregulation of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) between coupled cells, which was a phenomenon initially recognized as an important mechanism in the concept of ‘epigenetic toxicology’ (Trosko et al., 1993, 1998). Exchange of various ions, nutrients, secondary messengers or microRNAs through gap junctional connexin channels represents a key mechanism required for coordination of signal transduction pathways and control of gene expression within a tissue, which is essential for proper tissue development, function and regeneration (Trosko, 2011). GJIC is a process strictly regulated via transcriptional, translational, post-translational and epigenetic mechanisms (Axelsen et al., 2013; Vinken et al., 2009a,b). These non-endocrine dependent mechanisms might be involved in VIN and MXC induced increases in liver hypertrophy and hepatocellular carcinomas in various rodent model systems (HSDB, 2010; Reuber, 1980).\n\nMany EDCs, such as bisphenol A, DDT, lindane or phthalates, were found to induce rapid dysregulation of GJIC, with their effects shown to be structure-dependent and mediated via mechanisms including activation of specific kinases or phospholipases (Sovadinova et al., 2015; Vinken et al., 2009b). These data indicate that dysregulation of GJIC could be the key cellular process altered by EDCs via mechanisms independent on genomic signaling, which might contribute to their disruptive effects on epigenetic regulations, developmental programming, tissue development, and homeostasis.\n\nAlthough MXC and VIN are being intensively investigated as prototypical EDCs in order to understand their mechanisms of endocrine disruption, epigenetic regulation and transgenerational inheritance (Manikkam et al., 2014; Ozgyin et al., 2015; Skinner, 2014), and even though rapid alterations of cellular signaling are being increasingly recognized as an important mechanism contributing to the adverse effects of EDCs (Trevino et al., 2015; Watson et al., 2014; Wong and Walker, 2013), there is only limited information about effects of MXC and VIN on rapid intercellular and intracellular signaling events, such as GJIC or mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).\n\nThus, we used MXC and VIN as model EDCs to investigate their rapid effects on GJIC and related signal transduction pathways. These effects, which are relevant for transcriptional and epigenetic control of gene expression and normal cell behavior (Trosko, 2011), were studied in a rat liver epithelial cell line WB-F344. This cell line is a well-established in vitro model for assessment of GJIC and mechanistic studies in responses to environmental contaminants (Sovadinova et al., 2015; Upham et al., 2007, 2008), which has been validated by in vivo studies (Sai et al., 2000; Upham et al., 2009) and matches the most extensively used rodent model system, F344 rats, in the National Toxicology Program. Both of these EDCs exhibited dose, time and mechanistic differences on GJIC, MAPKs, and phospholipase C, which were elicited by the parental compounds and occurred independently of ER- or AR-mediated genomic mechanisms. We also determined that resveratrol, a natural chemopreventive and phytoestrogenic agent, prevented MXC - and VIN -induced dysregulation of GJIC.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nChemicals\n\n1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane (HPTE), 1-methylanthracene (1-MeA), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), 17β-estradiol (E2), anisomycin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), flutamide, ICI 182 780, MXC, SB202190, resveratrol, testosterone and VIN were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical (St Louis, Missouri). D609 and U0126 were obtained from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, Missouri), and 3′,5′-dichloro-2-hydroxy-2-methylbut-3-enanilide (VIN M2) from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, Michigan). Acetonitrile and acetic acid were provided by EMD Chemicals (Gibbstown, New Jersey), acetic acid, ammonium fluoride, ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and methanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Milli-Q water was produced using Milli-Q Synthesis device (EMD Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts). Anisomycin, E2, flutamide, ICI 182,780, MXC, HPTE, resveratrol, testosterone, U0126, VIN and VIN M2 were dissolved in acetonitrile, SB202190 in DMSO, TPA in ethanol, EGF in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and D609 in Milli-Q water.\n\nCell culture\n\nThe normal, non-tumorigenic, diploid WB-F344 rat liver epithelial cell line was obtained from Drs. Grisham and Tsao, University of North Carolina (Tsao et al., 1984). These stem-like cells share many characteristics with oval cells and hepatocyte progenitor cells present in the normal adult rat liver (Coleman et al., 1997; Tsao et al., 1984). The cells were grown in a modified Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium prepared according to (Kao et al., 1997) from powdered formula (Gibco 78-5470EF, Life Technologies, Grand Island, New York), and supplemented with 1 g/l sodium bicarbonate, 7.635 g/l sodium chloride, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich), 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 10 µg/ml of gentamicin (Life Technologies). Cells were routinely cultured in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks (Costar, Cambridge, Massachusetts) in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C, and routinely passaged every other day.\n\nExperimental setup\n\nAll experiments were done with confluent cultures obtained after seeding the cells at the density of 20–40 × 103 cell/cm2 and 48 or 72 h of growth. For immunostaining, WB-F344 cells were seeded onto sterile round glass cover slips (Fisher Scientific, Vernon Hills, Illinois) placed into 12-well plates (Costar). For other bioassays, the cells were grown on 35 mm-diameter tissue culture Petri dishes (Costar). The tested chemicals were pipetted from the stock solution and added directly to the cell cultures and then incubated for desired exposure time. In experiments with signaling enzyme inhibitors, resveratrol, and ER or AR modulators, the cells were first pretreated with the chemical of interest, and then exposed to a GJIC-inhibitor or vehicle. Concentrations and incubation times of signaling enzyme inhibitors were based on previous publications (Ogawa et al., 2004; Sovadinova et al., 2015) and efficiency of these pretreatments was verified by positive controls with model chemicals known to dysregulate GJIC by a mechanism dependent on a given pathway: EGF was used as a positive control for U0126 (MEK1/2 inhibitor), anisomycin for SB202190 (p38 inhibitor), 1-MeA for D609 (PC-PLC inhibitor) and resveratrol. Pretreatments with ER agonist (E2, HPTE), ER antagonists (ICI 182 780), AR agonist (testosterone) and AR antagonists (flutamide, VIN M2) were done using concentrations ranging from 1 to 250 µM and 30 or 120 min incubation time.\n\nIn all experiments, the concentration of organic solvents did not exceed 1% (v/v) and corresponding vehicle controls were included in each experiment.\n\nCell viability assay\n\nExposed cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h with 150 µg/ml neutral red. After incubation, the cells were rinsed with PBS and neutral red was extracted by 1% glacial acetic acid in 50% ethanol. Neutral red uptake was quantified by absorbance measurement at 540 nm (reference wavelength = 690 nm) using a Beckman DU 7400 spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments, Schaumburg, Illinois). Each experiment was carried out in duplicates and repeated at least 3 times independently.\n\nBioassay of GJIC\n\nThe scalpel loading-dye transfer (SL-DT) technique was adapted after the method of (El Fouly et al., 1987) and done according to previously published protocol (Upham, 2011). Briefly, the exposed cells were washed with calcium- and magnesium-supplemented PBS (CaMg-PBS). Lucifer yellow CH dilithium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, 1 mg/ml in CaMg-PBS) was added to the cells and the dye introduced to the monolayer by 3 parallel cuts with a surgical scalpel blade. After 3 min, the cells were rinsed with CaMg-PBS and fixed with a 4% formaldehyde solution in PBS. Microscopic images were taken with 20× objective using a Nikon microscope equipped with Nikon Cool Snap EZ CCD camera (Nikon Instruments, Melville, New York). The extent of GJIC was evaluated using ImageJ as a function of the area of the cells stained with lucifer yellow dye. The fluorescence area from the positive control treated with 1-MeA (70 µM, 10 min) inducing complete inhibition of GJIC (Upham et al., 2008) was subtracted from each treatment. Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times independently.\n\nWestern blot analysis\n\nWestern blots were done according to previously published protocol (Trosko et al., 2000). All chemicals (eg, ammonium persulfate, sodium dodecyl sulfate, Tween 20, Tris, glycine, acrylamide, and tetramethylethylenediamine, 2× SDS loading buffer) were purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, California), unless otherwise specified. As optimized and used previously (Upham et al., 2009), the cells were placed in a serum-free cell culture medium for 4 h prior the addition of the tested chemicals to minimize basal activity of MAPKs (Pirkmajer and Chibalin, 2011). TPA (50 nM, 30 min) was used as a positive control to induce MAPK ERK1/2 and Cx43 phosphorylation, 1-MeA (70 µM, 30 min) was used as a positive control for MAPK ERK1/2 and p38 activation (Upham et al., 2008). After exposure, the cells were rinsed with PBS and the proteins extracted with 20% SDS (v/v) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Trosko et al., 2000). Cell lysates were homogenized using an ultrasonic probe (BioLogics, Manassas, Virginia), and protein concentrations were determined using the DC protein kit (Bio-Rad). Proteins (15 µg) were separated using SDS-PAGE on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and then electrophoretically-transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (EMD Millipore) using Mini Protean apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v), and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a primary antibody diluted with the blocking solution.\n\nFollowing antibodies and dilutions were used: 1:2000 diluted rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylated p38 (Life Technologies, Cat. No. 36-8500), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danver, Massachusetts, Cat. No. 9101S), total p38 (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat. No. 9212) and total ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat. No. 9102), 1:1000 diluted rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ERα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas, Cat. No. sc-542) and AR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat. No. sc-816), 1:1000 diluted mouse monoclonal antibody against Cx43 (BD Transduction Lab, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, Cat. No. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"C13720\",\"term_id\":\"1561273\",\"term_text\":\"C13720\"}}C13720), 1:5000 diluted mouse monoclonal antibody against GAPDH (EMD Millipore, Cat. No. MAB374) and rabbit polyclonal antibody against α-tubulin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, Cat. No. AB15246). After the washing step, membranes were incubated with 1:1000 diluted secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature: horse radish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit (Cat. No. NA934) or anti-mouse (Cat. No. NA931) IgG antibodies obtained from GE Life Sciences (Arlington Heights, Illinois). Western blot signals were detected using HyGLO Chemiluminescent HRP reagents and HyBlot CL film (Denville Scientific, South Plainfield, New Jersey). All MXC and VIN treatments for MAPK and Cx43 detection were done in duplicate, and the time-response experiment was repeated 2 times independently. Cell lysates from mouse Leydig TM3 cell line, mouse Sertoli TM4 cell line, hER-transfected human cervical adenocarcinoma cell line HeLa-9903, and AIZ-AR cell line (derived from AR-expressing human prostate carcinoma epithelial cell line 22Rv1) were used as positive controls for ERα or AR detection.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\n\nThe cells were rinsed with ice cold PBS and fixed with 5% acetic acid in methanol (v/v) at −20 °C for 20 min. The non-specific binding sites were blocked with 10% normal goat serum (Life Technologies) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal anti-Cx43 antibody (BD Transduction Lab, Cat. No. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"C13720\",\"term_id\":\"1561273\",\"term_text\":\"C13720\"}}C13720) diluted 1:200 with 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v, BSA, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS-0.1% Tween 20 (v/v, PBST). After wash with PBST, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary Cy3-conjugated monoclonal anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Lab., West Grove, PA, Cat. No. 115-165-100) diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA-PBST. After wash with PBST and nuclear counterstaining (5 min with 0.1 µg/ml DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich), the cover slips were mounted using ProLong Antifade reagent (Life Technologies). TPA (50 nM) was used as a positive control inducing Cx43 translocation and internalization (Upham et al., 2008). Negative controls for non-specific antibody binding were prepared using non-treated cells subjected to the same staining procedure without either the primary or the secondary antibody incubation. Fluorescent images were obtained with a Nikon Epi-fluorescent microscope using an 100× oil immersion objective and a SPOT RT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, Michigan).\n\nLC-MS/MS analysis of HPTE and VIN M2\n\nVolume of cell culture media in 35 mm dishes containing confluent cultures of WB-F344 cells was adjusted to 1 ml and then 25 µM of MXC or 250 µM of VIN was added. The dishes were incubated for 10 min up to 24 h in the CO2 incubator. Method recovery was determined in experiments with the addition of 25 µM of HPTE or 250 µM of VIN M2 followed by brief incubation (<1 min). After incubation, 250 µl of acetonitrile was added to each dish, the cells were extracted using ultrasonic probe for 1 min, and the extracts were collected and filtered through 0.45 µm PVDF syringe filter. HPTE and VIN M2 were analyzed with Agilent 1260 Infinity (Agilent Technologies Inc.) using Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18 (2.1 × 10 mm, 2.7 µm) column and Guard column (2.1 × 5 mm, 2.7 µm). The injection volume was 5 µl and the flow rate was set to 0.3 ml/min. The mobile phase (A) was 0.2 mM ammonium fluoride in water, and the mobile phase (B) was acetonitrile. Gradient conditions were 90% of (A), ramped using a linear gradient to 33.5% (A) over 5 min, then ramped to 0% of (A) from 5 to 6 min and held until 11 min. Under these conditions, the retention time was 6.5 and 7.1 min for HPTE and VIN M2, respectively.\n\nAn Agilent 6406 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source was used in a negative mode: a nitrogen gas at temperature 150 °C and flow 5 l/min, nebulizer pressure 45 psi, a sheath nitrogen gas at temperature 250 °C and flow 11 l/min, capillary voltage 3500 V and nozzle voltage 500 V. The dwelling time of each compound was 200 ms. The HPTE (precursor at m/z 314.9) was fragmented using collision energies of 1 V to produce characteristic fragment ions at m/z 279.1 and 243.2. The VIN M2 (precursor at m/z 258) was fragmented using collision energies of 9 and 33 V to produce characteristic fragment ions at m/z 160 and 35. Recovery of the method from the cell culture was 72% for HPTE and 74% for M2, method limit of detection was 1.6 nM for HPTE and 1 nM for VIN M2.\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nQuantitative data from all bioassays (SLDT, neutral red uptake, Western blot densitometry) were compared with the vehicle or negative control from the corresponding experiment and reported as the fraction of the control (FOC). Data from independently repeated experiments were combined and used for all statistical analyses and comparisons. One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post-hoc test was used for comparing data passing normality (Shapiro-Wilk’s test) and equal variance tests, whereas Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on ranks followed by Dunn’s test was used for comparing data with unequal variances and/or non-normal distribution. P-values lower than .05 were considered as statistically significant. Curve-fitting was done using non-linear, 4-parameter sigmoidal regression model (f = y0 + a/(1 + exp(−(x−x0)/b)). All calculations were done in SigmaPlot (Systat Software, San Jose, California).\n\nRESULTS\n\nEffects of MXC and VIN on GJIC\n\nEffects of MXC and VIN on GJIC were first investigated after a 30 min exposure of WB-F344 cells to varying concentrations of the chemicals. Statistically significant inhibition of GJIC was observed at concentrations of MXC ≥5 µM, with concentrations above 20 µM causing almost complete inhibition of GJIC ( ). The effective concentration that caused 50% inhibition of GJIC (EC50) for MXC-induced inhibition of GJIC was estimated using nonlinear regression to be 9.5 µM. VIN induced slight, but statistically significant, inhibition of GJIC at 50 µM, with the effects becoming more pronounced with increasing concentration of VIN and resulting into nearly complete inhibition of GJIC after exposure to concentrations ≥200 µM ( ). Estimated EC50 value for GJIC inhibition by 30 min treatment with VIN was 126 µM.\n\nConcentrations of MXC and VIN shown to induce complete inhibition of GJIC (100%, EC100) after 30 min exposure, ie, 25 µM methoxychlor and 250 µM VIN, were then used to investigate time-dependent effects on GJIC during 1 min-24 h interval ( ). An observable reduction of GJIC by both chemicals was seen within a 1 min exposure, which was most apparent in the case of VIN, where the GJIC level decreased by approximately 40%. Time required for 50% inhibition of GJIC was estimated using nonlinear regression to be 4.2 min for 25 µM MXC, and 1.4 min for 250 µM VIN. For both chemicals, complete inhibition of GJIC was observed after 10 min ( ). However, GJIC remained inhibited up to 24 h of exposure to MXC, whereas the inhibitory effects of VIN on GJIC were only transient. After VIN treatment, the inhibition of GJIC was observed during the initial 120 min incubation with the chemical, then followed by restoration of cell-to-cell communication during 4–24 h even in the continuous presence of the chemical in the medium ( ). GJIC was restored to 50% of the control approximately after 3 h of VIN treatment.\n\nThe ability of cells to recover from the inhibition GJIC by MXC or VIN was determined by measuring GJIC after a 30 min pulsed-treatment with either MXC (25 µM) or VIN (250 µM), followed by the cell transfer into toxicant-free medium. Treatment with toxicants resulted in complete inhibition of GJIC, as apparent from the 0 min time point in the , where no time for recovery was allowed. For MXC, significant recovery of communication began after 120 min in toxicant-free medium. The recovery half-time for MXC was estimated to be 168 min. Near normal levels of GJIC (75%) began after 5 h and remained at this level up to 24 h of recovery time ( ). Recovery from VIN -induced inhibition of GJIC was observed within 5 min after the transfer to toxicant-free medium with a recovery half-time estimated to be 8.1 min. After 60 min, recovery from VIN -induced inhibition of GJIC was 100% and was not significantly different from the control, untreated cells ( ).\n\nEffects of MXC and VIN on Cell Viability\n\nThe concentrations of MXC and VIN needed to induce inhibition of GJIC were not lethally cytotoxic nor did they reduce cell viability, as evaluated using the neutral red uptake assay (Supplementary Figure S1). Statistically significant reduction of the cell viability was observed only after prolonged incubations with 50 µM MXC or 400–500 µM VIN, which represent concentrations 8–10 times higher than concentrations causing significant reduction of GJIC levels, and 2 times higher than concentrations required to induce complete inhibition of GJIC ( ). Furthermore, the ability to recover from inhibition of GJIC after a pulsed treatment also indicates these compounds are not lethal to the cells.\n\nTransformation of MXC and VIN in the Cell Cultures\n\nConcentrations of HPTE and VIN M2, the major metabolites of MXC and VIN, were analyzed in the cultures of WB-F344 cells exposed to 25 µM MXC or 250 µM VIN for 10 min to 24 h. Throughout the experiment, HPTE was not detected using a sensitive LC-MS/MS method ( ). A gradual increase of concentrations of VIN metabolite M2 was observed. Within the first 10 min of exposure, concentrations of M2 increased from non-detectable levels to 4 µM (1.5% of the nominal concentration of the parental compound). The concentrations of VIN M2 continued to further increase to 14 µM (5.6%) after 60 min, 27 µM (11%) after 240 min, and reach 75 µM (30% of the nominal) after 24 h incubation ( ). Although concentrations of VIN M2 seems to represent only a small fraction of the nominal concentration of VIN, the real extent of VIN transformation was probably much greater, as concentrations of VIN M1 were reported to be even 5–6 times higher than concentrations of M2 formed by spontaneous VIN hydrolysis during incubation in a culture medium without cells (Bursztyka et al., 2008).\n\nRole of ERs and ARs in GJIC Inhibition Induced by MXC and VIN\n\nResults of Western blotting indicated an expression of ERα or its isoforms in WB-F344 cell line (Supplementary Figure S2). However, effects of ER agonist E2 and ER antagonist ICI 182 780 were not found to dramatically reduce GJIC within 30 min to 24 h exposures to concentrations between 1 and 250 µM ( ). HPTE, a MXC metabolite and also ERα agonist and ERβ antagonist, reduced GJIC communication ( ), but its effects were less pronounced and manifested after longer exposure times (6 h) than comparable or even lower concentrations of MXC ( ). Higher concentrations of HPTE (>100 µM) were associated with cytotoxic effects and thus not evaluated. Pretreatment with these modulators of ER (1–100 or 250 µM for 30–120 min) did not attenuate rapid inhibition of GJIC induced by 10 min treatment with MXC (Supplementary Figure S3).\n\nIn WB-F344 cells, there was no detectable expression of AR (Supplementary Figure S2). Testosterone, a natural AR ligand, did not significantly reduce GJIC (1–250 µM, 30 min-24 h, ). Similar treatments with flutamide, an AR antagonist, resulted in a partial inhibition of GJIC after 120 min–6 h treatment with a concentration of 250 µM, which was associated with a cytotoxic effect occurring after 24 h exposure ( ). VIN metabolite M2, a potent antagonist of AR was capable to inhibit GJIC, although its effects appeared to be less potent and manifested more slowly than in the case of VIN ( ). Similarly to VIN, the inhibitory effects observed after 30 min with 100 µM M2 seemed to be only transient, whereas the effects of 250 µM treatment rather progressed over the time ( ). Pretreatments of WB-F344 cells with 1–250 µM testosterone, flutamide or M2 for 30–120 min did not prevent VIN -induced dysregulation of GJIC (Supplementary Figure S4).\n\nEffects of MXC and VIN on the Gap Junction Protein Cx43\n\nBecause of the observed inhibition of GJIC by MXC and VIN, the effects of the chemicals on phosphorylation and cellular localization of gap junctional protein Cx43 were also examined. Western blots images showed that MXC (25 µM) did not alter ratio of the 3 major Cx43 bands, P0, P1, P2, during the first 60 min of the exposure ( ). Only after 120 min, MXC decreased the intensity of P2-band, i.e. the band corresponding to the hyperphosphorylated Cx43. Exposure to 25 µM MXC for 10–30 min, which was shown to completely inhibit GJIC ( ) did not affect intracellular localization of Cx43, since there were no apparent changes of immunostained Cx43 plaques in plasma membranes of exposed WB-F344 cells ( ). Cx43-band pattern was not altered after a 5 min exposure to 250 µM VIN, but 10–30 min incubation with VIN resulted into hyperphosphorylation of Cx43, as indicated by simultaneous decrease in the intensity of nonphosphorylated Cx43 P0-band and increase in the intensity of hyperphosphorylated P2-band ( ). These effects were similar to the effects of tumor promoting phorbol ester, TPA, which was used as a positive control. After 60 min exposure to VIN, Cx43 bands were restored to the pattern resembling the vehicle control, and then followed by a disappearance of the P2-band after 120 min. Unlike MXC, VIN caused a decrease of the number and intensity of membrane-associated Cx43 immunostained plaques which was similar to the effects of TPA ( ).\n\nEffects of MXC and VIN on MAPK ERK1/2 and p38\n\nSince MAPKs were implicated in the control of GJIC level and phosphorylation of Cx43, changes in activity of MAPK ERK1/2 and p38 were also investigated in response to MXC and VIN in WB-F344 cells. In concentration-response experiment, both MXC and VIN were found to increase the amount of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38 after a 30 min exposure time, with the most pronounced effects observed at concentrations corresponding to those required for complete inhibition of GJIC, ie, 25 µM MXC and 250 µM VIN (Supplementary Figure S5). Time-course experiments revealed that ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation gradually increased during the exposure to 25 µM MXC, becoming significantly activated after ≥10–15 min and peaking between 30 and 60 min, but remaining significantly upregulated after 120 min ( ). In contrast, VIN induced significant activation of both ERK1/2 and p38 within 5 min ( ), which is the same time interval for the inhibition of GJIC ( ). The VIN-induced activation of ERK1/2 and p38 was sustained up to 60 min and then decreased close to the control level at 120 min ( ). The levels of total (phosphorylated plus nonphosphorylated) ERK1/2 and p38, as well as α-tubulin, did not change significantly during the investigated exposure periods, indicating that the observed changes in the amount of phosphorylated MAPKs were caused by increased activation/phosphorylation, and not by an increase in MAPK gene expression via genomic mechanisms.\n\nMechanisms of GJIC Inhibition Induced by MXC and VIN\n\nFinally, it was examined whether the effects of MXC and VIN on GJIC were mediated through the activation of ERK1/2, p38 or phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC), and also whether the inhibition of GJIC induced by a 10 min exposure to MXC (20–25 µM) or VIN (200–250 µM) can be prevented by resveratrol. Pretreatment of WB-F344 cells with MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, had no apparent effect on the downregulation of GJIC induced by either MXC or VIN ( ), although U0126 effectively prevented ERK1/2-dependent inhibition of GJIC by the EGF, which was used as a positive control (Supplementary Figure S6).\n\nPretreatment with SB202190, an inhibitor of p38, partially attenuated the inhibition of GJIC elicited by 20 µM MXC, but these effects diminished at 25 µM ( ). The effects of VIN on GJIC were completely prevented by pretreatment with SB202190, ( ). Experiments with p38-dependent inhibitor of GJIC, anisomycin, confirmed that effective doses of SB202190 were achieved (Supplementary Figure S6).\n\nFor both MXC and VIN, inhibition of GJIC was prevented by pretreatment with PC-PLC inhibitor, D609, which maintained GJIC at levels not significantly different from the control after the addition of the studied chemicals ( ). The effects of MXC and VIN on GJIC were also blocked by 15 min pretreatment of WB-F344 cells with resveratrol ( ), which was similar to the effects of resveratrol on another PC-PLC-dependent inhibitor of GJIC, 1-MeA (Supplementary Figure S6).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe rapid inhibition of GJIC in response to MXC or VIN is comparable with the effects reported for several other EDCs. In fact, recognized EDCs, such as lindane, chlordane, and DDT, represent the environmental toxicants which were for the first time identified to inhibit GJIC (Tsushimoto et al., 1983). MXC was initially reported to inhibit GJIC in primary bovine oviductal cells after 1–5 h exposure to concentrations ≥16–32 µM (Tiemann and Pohland, 1999). Even more rapid and pronounced inhibition of GJIC by MXC (30-min EC50 = 9.5 µM, 50% inhibition achieved within 5 min) was observed in this study, which is comparable to several other chlorinated compounds known to inhibit GJIC in WB-F344 cells within 5–60 min exposures to concentrations between 10 and 100 µM (Guan et al., 1995; Machala et al., 2003; Matesic et al., 1994; Ruch et al., 1994). GJIC dysregulation by VIN has not been previously reported. Effective concentrations of VIN for inhibition of GJIC (30-min EC50 = 126 µM) are comparable with the chemicals like alachlor, perfluoroheptanoic acid, benzoylperoxide, or lipidic compounds, which required higher concentrations (>100 µM) to rapidly induce >50% inhibitory effect (Sovadinova et al., 2015; Upham et al., 1998, 2007). Also, endogenous or synthetic estrogens and androgens were found to affect GJIC and connexins not only via classical genomic mechanism (Ren et al., 2013), but also via rapid actions of non-genomic signaling (Iwase et al., 2006; Lyng et al., 2000; Pluciennik et al., 1996). GJIC thus represents a cellular event possibly altered by hormones and EDCs via different mechanisms, which might be chemical-, as well as cell type-specific (Osgood et al., 2013; Sovadinova et al., 2015). The immediate cell responses to MXC and VIN observed in this study, such as inhibition of GJIC and phosphorylation of MAPKs and Cx43, were most likely mediated by rapid mechanisms independent of ER or AR genomic signaling. WB-F344 cells have been reported to express weakly ERα but not ERβ (Tanabe et al., 2012), which corresponds to the results of our Western blot analysis. These cells could therefore be susceptible to ERα-agonistic actions of MXC or its major metabolite HPTE (Gaido et al., 2000). HPTE indeed reduced GJIC, however, only after prolonged exposures, which indicates possibly slower nuclear receptor-dependent genomic action different from the rapid inhibitory mechanism of MXC. Moreover, transformation of MXC to HPTE was not observed in our study, most likely due to progenitor characteristics of the cell line associated with their low biotransformation capacity. Finally, neither ER agonists (E2, HPTE) nor ER antagonist (ICI 182,780) induced rapid dysregulation of GJIC or attenuated effects of MXC. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that the rapid effects of MXC on cell signaling were mediated by the parental compound and independent of HPTE- and ERα-dependent signaling.\n\nAntagonistic interactions of VIN and its metabolites with AR are crucial for their mode of action (van Ravenzwaay et al., 2013). However, we did not detect expression of AR in WB-F344 cells, thus the rapid effects of VIN were probably induced by a mechanisms independent of AR. This is also supported by the observation that a pretreatment of WB-F344 cells with modulators of AR (testosterone, flutamide, and VIN M2) did not prevent dysregulation of GJIC by VIN.\n\nThe effects of VIN on GJIC and phosphorylation of MAPKs and Cx43 occurred more rapidly (≤10 min) than the gradual transformation of VIN in the cell culture, as indicated by formation of M2 suggesting that the initial VIN effects were induced by the parental compound rather than its metabolites.\n\nVIN effects had a transient character, which is similar to the transient inhibition of GJIC induced by TPA, EGF (Rivedal and Opsahl, 2001), lindane (Caruso et al., 2005), phenobarbital (Ruch and Klaunig, 1988) and other hepatic peroxisome proliferators (Cruciani et al., 1997). Restoration of GJIC, decrease in MAPK activity and Cx43 phosphorylation in this study coincided with the steady increase of M2 concentrations in the cell culture medium during the experiment, indicating an ongoing transformation of VIN into possibly less active products. In addition to M2, even greater amounts of M1 can be expected to form, as it was reported that after 120 min incubation of VIN in the cell culture medium, about 20% of total VIN hydrolyzes into M2 while 80% is converted into M1 (Bursztyka et al., 2008). Interestingly, M2 metabolite was found in our study to induce an inhibition of GJIC, which did not seem to have a transient character. It is possible that, while conversion to presumably M1 or some other metabolite(s) reduced VIN effects, M2 might retain similar effects as the parental chemical but was not formed in a quantity sufficient to sustain GJIC inhibition.\n\nRapid inhibition of GJIC by MXC and VIN in WB-F344 cells was apparently elicited by the parental chemicals and via mechanisms independent of ER or AR signaling. Since the parental compounds of MXC and VIN can be found in the blood and tissues of human populations (Freire et al., 2013; Wickerham et al., 2012), their effects and underlying mechanisms might be toxicologically relevant. These mechanisms probably include rapid activation of MAPK ERK1/2 or p38 observed in our study after 5–10 min exposure. Our findings on activation of MAPKs by VIN are supported by a recent study, which reported rapid and transient (1-15 min) activation of ERK1/2 and Akt kinases in VIN-treated porcine granulosa cells (Wartalski et al., 2016). For MXC, MAPKs activation was implicated in the responses of macrophages exposed for 18–24 h (Kim et al., 2005), whereas rapid (10 min) activation of ERK1/2 and p38 was observed in MCF-7 cells exposed to HPTE (Li et al., 2006). Our study thus provides one of the first observations that MAPKs can be activated also by the parental chemicals via rapid signaling mechanisms. Although MAPKs have been implicated in the regulation of GJIC via Cx43 phosphorylation (Axelsen et al., 2013), Cx43 phosphorylation followed by its internalization was observed only for VIN but not MXC. Moreover, neither MXC - nor VIN -induced inhibition of GJIC was prevented by a MEK1/2 inhibitor, which indicates that dysregulation of GJIC by these 2 chemicals did not occur via classical ERK1/2-dependent mechanism reported for TPA, EGF, or lindane (Sovadinova et al., 2015).\n\nThe dysregulation of GJIC by VIN was attenuated by an inhibitor of p38, which is mechanistically similar to effects induced by 1-MeA in lung but not liver epithelial cells (Osgood et al., 2013; Upham et al., 2008), or by anisomycin in WB-F344 cells (Ogawa et al., 2004). Interestingly, the effects of MXC and VIN on GJIC were prevented by an inhibitor of PC-PLC. This signal transduction enzyme was implicated in downregulation of GJIC in response to various toxicants, including DDT, PCB153, dicumylperoxide, perfluorooctanoic acid, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Sovadinova et al., 2015). However, our study might be one of the rare reports suggesting activation of phospholipases in response to MXC (Cheng et al., 2012; Tseng et al., 2011), and possibly the first one demonstrating the key role of rapid phospholipase activation in cell responses to VIN exposure. Future studies should address the signaling events upstream and downstream of PC-PLC activation and their role in the mechanisms of GJIC inhibition and MAPK activation.\n\nSimilar to the other PC-PLC-dependent inhibitors of GJIC (Sovadinova et al., 2015), MXC and VIN actions were effectively prevented by a dietary phytoalexin, resveratrol. Preventive effects were induced by a short pretreatment with resveratrol, which suggests that this phytoestrogen can also rapidly modulate signal transductions interfering with signaling pathways responsible for dysregulation of GJIC in response to MXC or VIN. Since PC-PLC represents a shared mechanism among a large group of resveratrol-sensitive inhibitors of GJIC, these data indicate that PC-PLC might be a possible novel target of rapid non-genomic actions of resveratrol as well as EDCs.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this study, we provide the first report that the parental compounds of prototypical EDCs, MXC, and VIN, can rapidly inhibit GJIC and activate ERK1/2, p38 and PC-PLC independently of ER or AR signaling. Alterations of these cellular events known to be critically important for control of gene expression and epigenetic regulations were manifested in a model epithelial cell line expressing Cx43, which represents the major connexin protein responsible for the maintenance of GJIC and tissue homeostasis in many different cell types, tissues and organs. Cx43 expressing cells include, for example, cells from male and female reproductive organs, such as cumulus and granulosa cells of ovarian follicles or somatic testicular Leydig or Sertoli cells, which are known to be critical for gametogenesis, sex hormone production and reproduction (Kidder and Cyr, 2016; Winterhager and Kidder, 2015). Future in vitro and in vivo studies should therefore address the possible roles of these rapid intercellular and intracellular signaling events in the mechanisms of endocrine disruption, epigenetic dysregulations and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance induced by MXC, VIN, or other EDCs. Epigenetic effects elicited in the key cell populations, such as organ-specific (somatic, adult) stem cells, during the critical developmental phases could also represent the mechanism responsible for the developmental origin of adult chronic diseases (Barker, 2004), and further studies should consider testing this hypothesis (Trosko, 2011).\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nSupplementary data are available online at http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/.\n\nSupplementary Data:\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank Ms Lindsay Goodall for her excellent contribution of maintaining cultures of cells for these experiments.\n\nFUNDING\n\nThis work was supported by the Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (LH12034 to P.B., LO1214 and LM2015051 to RECETOX); National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (R01 ES013268-01A2 to B.L.U.), and Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (PASPA–UNAM 2009-2010 to R.Z.).\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAnway M.
