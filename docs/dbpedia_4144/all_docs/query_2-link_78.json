Understanding downstream RAS-effectors that mediate oncogenesis in a RAS mutant setting will help tailor treatments that use RAS-effector inhibitors either alone or in combination to target RAS-driven tumors.  Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we have investigated the sufficiency of targeting RAS-effectors, RAF, MEK and PI3-Kinase either alone or in combination in RAS mutant lines, using an inducible shRNA in vivo mouse model system. We find that in colon cancer cells harboring a KRASG13D mutant allele, knocking down KRAS alone or the RAFs in combination or the RAF effectors, MEK1 and MEK2, together is effective in delaying tumor growth in vivo. In melanoma cells harboring an NRASQ61L or NRASQ61K mutant allele, we find that targeting NRAS alone or both BRAF and CRAF in combination or both BRAF and PIK3CA together showed efficacy.  Conclusion/Significance Our data indicates that targeting oncogenic NRAS-driven melanomas require decrease in both pERK and pAKT downstream of RAS-effectors for efficacy. This can be achieved by either targeting both BRAF and CRAF or BRAF and PIK3CA simultaneously in NRAS mutant tumor cells.",

        "text": "Oncogenic RAS-mutant cancer cells require RAS for proliferation, anchorage independent growth and tumor formation\n\nHCT116, a colon cancer line that harbors a KRASG13D mutation and IPC298, a cutaneous melanoma cell line bearing an NRASQ61L mutation, were chosen for this study since KRAS in colorectal cancer and NRAS in melanoma is the most frequently mutated RAS gene in these tumor types. The colon cancer cell line HCT116, in addition to KRAS mutation, also harbors an activating mutation in the RAS effector PIK3CA (Table S1). In order to understand the relevance of oncogenic RAS and its dependence on its major downstream effectors, RAF and PI3K, we used a previously described doxycycline (dox)-inducible shRNA system [29] to study the effects of RAS knockdown on cellular proliferation and tumor growth. We generated pools of cells expressing shRNAs that target RAS in a dox-inducible fashion. Upon dox treatment RAS, KRAS in HCT116 and NRAS in IPC298, was effectively silenced (Figure 1A). Consistent with the loss of signaling from RAS, the levels of phospho ERK decreased in both the RAS mutant lines, relative to the total ERK in these lines. In addition to loss of phosphoERK levels, RAS knock-down in both IPC298 and HCT116 cells led to a decrease in the phospho AKT levels. Phospho AKT levels were reduced in KRAS knock-down HCT116 cells despite the presence of PIK3CA mutation in this line. In both lines the control luciferase shRNA-expressing cells upon dox induction did not show any changes in either the phospho or the total ERK levels. Similarly, the phospho and total AKT levels were not modulated significantly in these cells following dox addition. To determine the requirement of RAS in these RAS-mutant cancer lines for cellular proliferation, we studied these lines for growth following induction of shRNAs that target NRAS or KRAS. We found that, consistent with the loss of downstream signaling following abrogation of KRAS in HCT116 and NRAS in IPC298, cell proliferation was reduced by 40% and 60% respectively (Figure 1B). We found a similar trend in proliferation with a second shRNA that targeted KRAS or NRAS in these lines (data not shown). Compared to the RAS knock-down lines, the luciferase control lines showed no effect on proliferation following dox induction (Figure 1B). In addition to the effect seen on proliferation, RAS knock down led to a 5-6-fold decrease in anchorage-independent growth in both the HCT116 and IPC298 cells (Figure 1C and 1D). These results demonstrate that both lines were dependent on RAS, KRAS in HCT116 and NRAS in IPC298, for their proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. We next tested the relevance of oncogenic RAS in the RAS-mutant lines for tumor formation in vivo by establishing s.c. tumors and inducing the targeting shRNA in established tumors as described in materials and methods. As shown in Figure 1E and G, the control luciferase oligo induction had no effect on the growth of HCT116 or IPC298 in vivo. However, knocking down KRAS in HCT116 (Figure 1F) and NRAS in IPC298 (Figure 1H) led to a significant delay in tumor growth, indicating the requirement of KRAS in HCT116 and NRAS in IPC298 for tumor growth in vivo.\n\n(A) Western blot analysis of KRAS and NRAS knock-down in HCT116 and IPC298 cells, respectively. Lysates from cells expressing KRAS, NRAS or control luciferase (shLUC) shRNA, prepared 72 h post treatment with dox, were analyzed, as indicated, by immunoblotting. β-actin levels in the blot serves as a loading control. (B) Proliferation of KRAS or NRAS shRNA expressing cells after 4 days post dox treatment. (C–D) KRAS and NRAS shRNA induction, in HCT116 and ICP298 respectively leads to reduced anchorage independent growth of these cells. Representative images (C) and colony count (D) are shown. (E–H) RAS knock-down, KRAS in HCT116 (F), and, NRAS in IPC298 (H), delays in vivo tumor growth. Induction of LUC shRNA in control cells (E, G) had no effect on tumor growth. Each data point is the mean±SEM tumor volume derived from 10 mice. Dotted line in (E–H) represents data from dox treated animals.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005717.g001\n\nDifferential effects of targeting downstream RAS-effectors on tumor growth in RAS mutant cancer cells\n\nRAS predominantly engages the RAF pathway and the PI3K pathway as major downstream effectors in various cancers. We sought to examine the contribution of these two arms in tumor growth and progression. In addition to elucidating the role of these two RAS-effector arms in cancer, this knowledge should provide insight into targeting RAS-driven tumors. We therefore generated pools of either HCT116 or IPC298 cells harboring inducible shRNAs that target, BRAF, CRAF, MEK1, MEK2 and PIK3CA either singly or in various combinations within the same line. We then tested these lines for in vitro proliferation and in vivo tumor growth.\n\nHCT116-BRAF knockdown line, upon dox treatment showed reduction in BRAF protein levels and a concomitant decrease in phospho ERK levels relative to the total ERK levels (Figure 2A). Similarly, HCT116-PIK3CA knockdown lines when treated with dox showed a reduction in the levels of PIK3CA and a decrease in phospho AKT compared to the control un-induced cells. In proliferation studies, both the dox treated PIK3CA knockdown and BRAF knockdown HCT116 lines showed a 20–25% reduction in proliferation compared to non-dox treated cells (Figure 2B). However, in vivo, mice bearing tumors derived from PIK3CA knock-down HCT116-cells, showed no effect on tumor growth following dox treatment (Figure 2C). These results are consistent with the fact that the mutant PIK3CA in HCT116 did not functionally substitute for KRAS in experiments where KRAS was silenced, both in vitro and in vivo (Figure 1B and 1F). In contrast to knock-down of PIK3CA in HCT116, nude mice bearing subcutaneous tumors resulting from injected HCT116 BRAF-inducible shRNAs cells, when treated with dox showed a delay in tumor growth (Figure 2D). The delay was not statistically significant, in part due to the outlier tumor volumes observed towards the end of this study. However, this could also be in part due to the fact that the oncogenic RAS could engage other RAF family members like CRAF and continue to promote tumor growth and survival. To fully evaluate the contributions of the RAF arm that could result from engagement of other RAFs, we generated HCT116 inducible shRNA knock-down lines where we conditionally silenced CRAF or both CRAF and BRAF together. As expected, knock-down of BRAF and CRAF together decreased pMEK level completely, while knock-down of CRAF alone showed some residual pMEK levels (Figure 3A). Consistent with this finding, the BRAF/CRAF double knock-down line showed a decrease in pERK levels while the CRAF knock-down alone did not substantially affect pERK levels in vitro. However, knock-down of either CRAF or BRAF and CRAF together decreased pAKT levels (Figure 3A). In proliferation studies, CRAF knock-down lines showed a ∼25% decrease in proliferation, while the combined CRAF and BRAF knock down had ∼40% reduction in proliferation (Figure 3C). In vivo, combined CRAF and BRAF knock-down showed a significant delay in tumor growth compared to the un-induced control (Figure 3E). Although not as significant as the dual RAF knock-down, CRAF knock-down alone significantly delayed tumor growth (Figure 3D). These results suggest that KRAS in HCT116 cells engages both CRAF and BRAF for promoting tumor growth with CRAF being the dominant effector arm.\n\n(A) Western blot analysis of PIK3CA or BRAF knock-down in HCT116 at 72 h post dox induction of relevant shRNAs.

The effect of knock-down on the phosphorylation status of relevant downstream target is shown. (C) Proliferation of CRAF, CRAF and BRAF, MEK1, MEK2 and double MEK1+2 shRNA expressing cells 4 days post dox treatment. (D–G) shRNA targeting CRAF (D), CRAF and BRAF (E) and MEK1 and MEK2 double knock-down (G) in KRAS-mutant HCT116 tumors in vivo delayed tumor growth. shRNA targeting MEK1 or MEK2 individually (F) when induced in mice bearing HCT116 tumors did not delay tumor growth. Each data point is the mean±SEM tumor volume of 10 mice. Dotted line in (D–F) represents data from dox treated animals.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005717.g003\n\nGiven that several Mek inhibitors are in development in the clinic we sought to test if targeting the RAF effectors MEK1 or MEK2 either alone or together in the same pool of cells would be as effective as targeting the RAFs. We therefore generated HCT116 cells that inducibly express shRNAs targeting MEK1 or MEK2 or both. In these lines upon dox addition, MEK1 in the MEK1-knock-down line, MEK2 in the MEK2-knock-down line, and both MEK1 and MEK2 in the double knock-down line were decreased, compared to the un-induced control (Figure 3B). While the MEK1 or MEK2 knock-down alone did not show a substantial decrease in phospho ERK levels, the double knock-down showed a significant decrease in phopsho ERK levels (Figure 3B). However, knock-down of MEK either alone or in combination does not affect pAKT level (Figure 3B). We tested these lines in vitro for their ability to proliferate in the presence or absence of dox and found that the MEK1, MEK2 and MEK1+2 double lines showed ∼15%, ∼20% and ∼30% reduction in proliferation respectively, compared to untreated control cells (Figure 3C). This suggests that loss of each isoform of MEK has an effect on its own, while the combined knock-down has the most effect on proliferation. We tested the MEK-knock-down HCT116 lines in vivo for tumor growth in nude mice and found that silencing both MEK1 and MEK2 together led to a significant delay in tumor growth (Figure 3G), compared to targeting them individually (Figure 3F). To confirm this further we tested a pharmacological inhibitor of MEK on HCT116 cells and found that it is effective in delaying tumor growth (Figure S1). These results suggest that in the KRAS mutant HCT116 colon cancer cells, the RAF/MEK/ERK effector arm is necessary for cellular proliferation and tumor growth, despite the presence of activating mutation in PIK3CA.\n\nWe extended these studies to the NRAS mutant melanoma IPC298 cells. Given that BRAF is more commonly mutated in melanomas, we hypothesized that targeting the BRAF effector arm alone would be sufficient to affect cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth. To test this, we generated a stable pool of IPC298 cells harboring an inducible BRAF shRNA. Upon BRAF shRNA induction, we observed a significant decrease in the BRAF protein (Figure 4A). In vitro the BRAF-shRNA expressing IPC298 cells showed a ∼20% decrease in proliferation upon dox treatment relative to the uninduced control cells (Figure 4C). However, in vivo, we found that BRAF silencing did not show a statistically significant delay in IPC298 tumor growth (Figure 4D). This is contrary to our initial hypothesis about BRAF playing a dominant role in tumor cell signaling in melanomas bearing an NRAS mutation. The lack of efficacy in IPC298 cells following BRAF knock-down could be the result of mutant RAS engaging other RAF family member like CRAF. To address this, we generated and tested IPC298 pools that inducibly expressed shRNAs targeting CRAF alone or BRAF and CRAF in combination. Upon induction of corresponding shRNA in these cells, CRAF or BRAF and CRAF proteins were completely depleted leading to a decrease in pMEK and pERK levels (Figure 4A). As with BRAF, knock-down of CRAF also decreased in vitro cell proliferation by ∼20%. We found double knock-down of both BRAF and CRAF to be far more effective leading to a ∼50% reduction in cell proliferation compared to the uninduced cells (Figure 4C). Similar to the effects observed with BRAF knock-down, silencing CRAF alone did not show a statistically significant delay in IPC298 tumor growth in vivo (Figure 4E). In contrast, mice bearing IPC298 co-expressing BRAF and CRAF shRNA showed complete inhibition of tumor growth following dox induction (Figure 4F). These data indicate that the NRAS mutant IPC298 melanoma line engages both the BRAF and CRAF effector arms for survival and proliferation and that targeting both BRAF and CRAF is important for efficacy. Further, both pERK and pAKT levels are decreased only when both BRAF and CRAF are knocked down together (Figure 4A), suggesting that signaling from both the RAF and PI3K effectors need to be inhibited for efficacy.\n\n(A–B) Western blot analysis showing BRAF, CRAF, BRAF+CRAF, MEK1, MEK2, and double MEK1/2 knock-down in IPC298 at 72 h after dox induction of shRNAs. The effect of knock-down on the phosphorylation status of relevant downstream targets is shown. (C) Effect of expressing BRAF, CRAF, BRAF+CRAF, MEK1, MEK2 and double MEK1+2 shRNAs on proliferation of IPC298 cells 4 days following dox treatment. (D–G) While shRNA targeting BRAF+CRAF (F) together delayed tumor growth, shRNA targeting BRAF (D), CRAF (E), MEK1, or MEK2 or MEK1 and MEK2 together (G) when induced in mice bearing IPC298 derived tumors did not delay tumor growth. Each data point is the mean±SEM tumor volume of 10 mice. Dotted line in (D–G) represents data from dox treated animals.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005717.g004\n\nSince, both BRAF and CRAF signal through their effectors MEK1 and MEK2, we sought to understand the effect of targeting MEKs in IPC298 cells. We generated and tested IPC298 pools that inducibly expressed shRNAs that target RAF-effectors MEK1 or MEK2 or both MEK1 and MEK2 together in the same cells. The targeted knock-down of MEK1 or MEK2 alone or a combined MEK1 and MEK2 knock-down reduced the levels of these proteins (Figure 4B). The pERK levels were also decreased in these cells compared to control untreated cells (Figure 4B). In all the MEK-shRNA containing IPC298 lines, in vitro we did not observe a significant difference in proliferation between the control and dox-treated cells (Figure 4B). Similarly, silencing MEK1 or MEK 2 alone or in combination, did not show a significant delay in tumor growth relative to the control animals (Figure 4G). This result was unexpected given that CRAF and BRAF targeting was effective, suggesting potential differential survival and proliferation signaling outputs resulting from inhibition of different nodes along the RAS/RAF pathway. Consistent with this, we find pAKT levels to be unchanged (Figure 4B) in the MEK1/2 double knock-down line, although pERK was decreased. This is in contrast to decreases in both the pAKT and pERK levels observed with the BRAF/CRAF double knock-down lines (Figure 4A). Further, this is a likely reason for the lack of efficacy observed in the combined MEK1/2 knock-down as compared to BRAF/CRAF double knock-down. Although the exact cross talk and feedback mechanism leading to the differential modulation of pAKT and pERK in response to knock-down of the various RAF and RAF-effectors is not obvious, this data indicates the requirement for targeting signaling from both ERK and AKT effectors in NRAS mutant lines.\n\nCombined targeting of RAF and PI3K, RAS-effector arms effectively reduces tumor growth in NRAS mutant tumors\n\nGiven the observed requirement for decrease in both pERK and pAKT downstream of mutant NRAS and the intense efforts to develop inhibitors targeting BRAF, MEK1/2 and PI3K in progress, we sought to understand if combined knock-down of RAF or MEK with PI3K would be an effective strategy for treatment of NRAS mutant melanomas.\n\nInduction of shRNA targeting PIK3CA alone reduced the levels of PIK3CA, leading to a reduction in the pAKT levels (Figure 5A). However, this did not decrease the pERK levels (Figure 5A). The PIK3CA shRNA line did not show any significant decrease in proliferation following dox treatment, compared to untreated cells (Figure 5B). In vivo, induction of PIK3CA targeting shRNA, did not delay IPC298 tumor growth, compared to animals that were placed on sucrose (Figure 5C). This suggested that targeting the PIK3CA effector arm alone was not sufficient to prevent tumor growth in the NRAS mutant line.\n\n(A) Immuno blot analysis of PIK3CA, PIK3CA+BRAF, and PIK3CA+MEK1/2 knock-down in IPC298 cells affects phosphorylation of downstream targets. (B) Proliferation of IPC298 cells expressing shRNAs targeting PIK3CA alone or PIK3CA and BRAF together or PIK3CA together with MEK1/2 4 days after dox treatment. (C) shRNA targeting PIK3CA in IPC298 did not delay tumor growth in vivo, following induction of PIK3CA targeting shRNA. (D–E) Combined induction of BRAF and PIK3CA shRNA together or MEK1 and 2 together with PIK3CA in mice bearing IPC298 derived tumors delay tumor growth in vivo. Each data point is the mean±SEM tumor volume of 10 mice. Dotted line in (C–E) represents data from dox treated animals.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005717.g005\n\nTo test the possibility that the combined targeting of RAF and PI3K effector arms would be effective in the NRAS mutant background, we generated IPC298 pools that inducibly expressed shRNAs that target either PIK3CA and BRAF together or PIK3CA along with both the RAF-effectors, MEK1 and 2. These cells were characterized for effective knock-down of BRAF, MEKs and PIK3CA. As expected, upon dox treatment the cells showed reduced BRAF, PIK3CA or MEK1 and 2 protein (Figure 5A). Consistent with this, pERK and pAKT levels were diminished, relative to the total amount of ERK and AKT respectively. It is interesting to note that while BRAF or PIK3CA knock-down alone did not affect pERK levels significantly, the combined knock-down of BRAF and PIK3CA led to significant decrease in pERK and pAKT. We studied these cells in proliferation assays and found that there was a ∼25–30% decrease in proliferation when both BRAF and PIK3CA or the RAF-effectors MEK1, 2 and PIK3CA together were knocked down in the IPC298 cells (Figure 5B). We also tested these lines in vivo to see if targeting both BRAF and PIK3CA or both MEK1+2 and PIK3CA will lead to delayed tumor growth. Targeting both the RAS-effector arms, either by combined BRAF and PIK3CA or MEK1+2 and PIK3CA together, effectively delayed the tumor growth (Figure 5D and 5E) confirming the importance of both the PI3K and RAF effector arms in the IPC298 NRAS-mutant melanoma line for tumor growth.\n\nIn order to understand if other NRAS mutant lines employ similar signaling cascades downstream of NRAS, we chose to study SK-MEL-30, another melanoma line with an NRASQ61K mutant allele. We generated SK-MEL-30 cells bearing inducible shRNA that target NRAS, BRAF, CRAF, PIK3CA alone, or combinations of BRAF and CRAF, or BRAF and PIK3CA. Inducible knock-down of NRAS, BRAF, CRAF individually or BRAF and CRAF or BRAF and PIK3CA together showed a decrease in the appropriate target protein with concomitant changes in downstream signaling as indicated by decreases in pERK and/or pAKT levels (Figure 6A, 6B, 7A). As with IPC298, knock-down of NRAS or the combined knock-down of BRAF and CRAF or BRAF and PI3KCA was effective in decreasing both the pERK and pAKT (Figure 6A, 6B, 7A). In in vitro proliferation studies, induction of shRNA targeting NRAS, BRAF, CRAF, dual targeting of BRAF/CRAF, or BRAF/PIK3CA had a reduction in proliferation of ∼20%, ∼12%, ∼20%, ∼40% and ∼28%, respectively (Figure. 6C and 7B), while the control shLUC or shRNAs targeting PIK3CA did not have a significant effect on proliferation compared to un-induced cells (Figure. 6C and 7B). In in vivo tumor growth studies, tumors carrying shRNAs that target NRAS alone, or combinations of BRAF and CRAF, or BRAF and PIK3CA, showed a significant delay in tumor growth (Figure 6E, 6H and 7D) compared to the corresponding sucrose controls. As observed in IPC298 cells, targeting BRAF, CRAF or PIK3CA individually in SK-MEL-30 cells did not effect in vivo tumor growth (Figure 6F, 6G and 7C). These results further confirm the requirement for sustained decrease in pERK and pAKT mediated signaling achieved either through combined targeting of BRAF and CRAF or BRAF and PIK3CA effector arms to be a more general requirement for effective therapy in NRAS mutant tumors.\n\n(A–B) Immunoblot analysis of SK-MEL-30 cells expressing control luciferase shRNA or shRNAs targeting NRAS, BRAF, CRAF or both BRAF and CRAF reveals respective protein knock-down and their effects on phosphorylation of downstream targets. (C) Proliferation of SK-MEL-30 cells expressing control luciferase shRNA or shRNAs targeting NRAS, BRAF, CRAF or both BRAF and CRAF. (D–H) shRNA targeting NRAS (E) or both BRAF and CRAF in SK-MEL-30 (H) delays tumor growth in vivo, whereas, induction of BRAF (F), CRAF (G) targeting shRNA or control luciferase (D) shRNA did not affect tumor growth. Each data point is the mean±SEM tumor volume of 10 mice. Dotted line in (D–H) represents data from dox treated animals.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005717.g006\n\n(A) Immunoblot analysis of SK-MEL-30 cells expressing shRNAs targeting PIK3CA or both PIK3CA and BRAF reveal respective protein knock-down and their effects on phosphorylation of downstream targets.
