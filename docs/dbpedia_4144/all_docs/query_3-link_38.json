He enjoyed anime, video games, and spending time with his friends and family. As a child, his father taught him and his sister to play chess, and it became a goal of his to beat his father at this game. He did (eventually) accomplish this long-time goal; a true instance of the student surpassing the master.\n\nTilford was a truly outstanding person. It was impossible not to smile around him, and he was always someone that you could turn to. No matter the situation, Tilford was there with honest reflection, thoughtful advice, a strong hand to hold, and a playful jest to make you smile. He was genuine, compassionate, and ever the fine, upstanding gentleman.\n\nHowever it came to be, we were all lucky to know Tilford. We were all lucky to have experienced the type of friendship and love he had to give. To think, of all the different ways the universe could have organized itself, of all the choices we could have made to change our lives, that we all came to know such a wonderful man, and such a beautiful soul, is truly magical.

For this, we should be deeply grateful.\n\nFriends may call at Walker Funeral Home (Hamilton, Ohio 532 S. 2.nd St. Hamilton, Ohio 45011) Friday July 19, 2019 11:00am until time of service 1:00pm.

She was a wonderful Mom and Grandma, a thorough housekeeper and an amazing cook; her homemade bread, pies, cakes and cookies, as well her Sunday roasts and unmatched gravy, will be missed by all who shared her table. She was a ravenous reader and active with the Norwood PTA, and her children will always be grateful for the love of learning both parents instilled in them. Her kids are also grateful for the summer vacations at the lake house in Traverse City, to which she and Lawrence retired in 1976; and for her patience with her kids’ rotating menageries of dogs, birds, rabbits, snakes, turtles, fish, and, for a while, even a cat. She was also active with the Norwood Presbyterian Church when in Ohio, and the Traverse City Presbyterian Church after retirement. Eileen was predeceased by her husband Lawrence, her oldest daughter Barbara (Eversull), her parents, and seven of her nine siblings.
