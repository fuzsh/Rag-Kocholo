GILBERT, BOOK PRINTER AND BINDER.\n\nCOLUMBUS, GA., 1874.\n\nINTRODUCTIOTSr.\n\nI When the prospectus for this eompilalion \\v;is issued, neither the Jfmblisher nor the editor could make any reliable estimate of tile size !of the volume--not a page of it having then been prepared. We soon discovered that it was impossible to crowd into the apace which we at first proposed as a limit, more tbaii half the matter that ought to go I into the work, and as the price at which it mis offered could not Vjustify the furnishing of a volume of double the number of pages f contemplated, we concluded to extend the work and divide it into two 'parts, each covering the space of about nineteen years. The rivst [part is now presented.\n\nThe editor is conscious of many defects and deficiencies. These i were unavoidable. The newspaper files, upon which he had mainly to rely, were wholly ini,singv for the ye;n\\s 1835 arid 1M\">6, and manynnmi-.bers were missing from the files of other early years within our reach. We procured a file of the Maeoii [Georgia] Mexsenger for\n\nhe years 1885*~6, whicli enabled us to supply many mcideuts of the -Jreek war. Old citizens assisted us with their recollections, and \"hough we could not make up a perfect history of that stirring time irorn these disconnected data, we trust that we have given enough to P, terest and inform most readers, .Of course our chapters i'or these Wo years are deficient in minor loc.uJ, incidents that the papers of the \"ity would have furnished had they been accessible.\n\nThe editor pleads, also, his pressing and unflagging work upon a flaily newspaper, as an excuse for the lack of a better arry.ng'ement of bhe facts in this publication, as well, as its very plain' style. He can. say, indeed that he bus only had niiatehes of time, to devote \"to it. iome old citizens will no doubt be disappointed because it does not -ontain incidents worthy of note within their remembrance. But even\n\nley might have overlooked Borne incidents equally noteworthy th.it\n\nIV\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\narc reported. It wo.nlrl have been impossible for any one person, with the imperfect records at hand, to gather up all the facts deserving mention.\n\nIt will be seen that we have not included any living persons In the short personal sketches contained in this part, and we have eiideav* ored to avoid any compliment (however deserving) to persons now living. These brief sketches are not brought up as closely as they should properly have been, hut omissions in this respect will be sup plied in the remainder of the work. Prior to the year J.3S9 we had to rely entirely on the newspapers for records of marriages and deaths, and they are deficient. There are records of marriages in the Ordinary's office, commencing with that year, and we have been kindly permitted to i*se them. But the death roll is still incomplete.\n\nThe newspapers for the years over which we have gone devoted little space and paid but little attention to, local affairs--much less than they how do. We have been surprised to find that they often contained but very slight mention, and sometimes none at all, of local questions, which, as we learn from allusions in the proceedings of Council, must have much interested the city and its people. As there was a marked improvement in this respect in the newspapers .of later date, as the tiles are more complete, as well as the written records, we can safely promise that there will be fewer omissions in the second part. That part will also conclude with interesting statistics in ref erence to the factories, churches, &c., at the present time.\n\nWith this explanation we submit the first half of our work to the public, hoping that it contains matter that will interest and inform them, with all its imperfections.\n\nTHE EDITOK.\n\nERRATA. wale was not. the smith-west corner of Broad ami Oawibrd streets, aa stated on page. 12, but\n\n\\Ve have given two dates for the arrival of the first steamboat--ono'tm th(; authority of the 2iid of February, 1828, was the lime, and the \"Stoubenville,\" ttie bout.

It was entitled \"An act to lay out a trading town, and to dispose of all the lands reserved for the use of the State near the Coweta Falls, on the Chattahoochee river, and to name the, same.\" This act was \"assented, to\" Dec. 24, (one advertisement says Dec. 22,) 1827. It provided for the appointment by the Governor of five Commissioners to select the most eligible 'site on the reserve (known as the Coweta Reserve, near Coweta Falls on the Chattahoochee,) to appropriate a square or oblong square of twelve hundred acres for the commons and town, which was to be called and known by the name of' CoLusiBUS. They were to. lay out not less than five hundred building lots of half an acre each, aiid\"to make a reservation of one square containing ten acres for the public buildings of the county of Muscogec, with the privilege to the covinty of selling \"what was not needed for this purpose.\n\nThe Commissioners appointed to execute the trust were,\n\n/\n\n6\n\nTHE LOCALITY AT THAT TIME.\n\nIgnatius Few, Elias Beall, Philip H. Alston, James Hallam, and E. L. DeGraffenried.\n\nThe present site of Columbus was at that time an almost unbroken lowland forest, in some places hardly penetrable through its thick undergrowth, and in others covered by swamps and ponds of water. Where pome of the finest buildings now stand there' were marshes or ponds. From one block north of where the \"Perry House\" now stands, all south arid east was a muddy swamp, filled with briars and vines and small undergrowth among the large forest trees, so that in many places it was difficult to get through. Upon the present location of the \"Perry House,\" and extending two blocks north, was a pond where wild ducks and geese were often shot. Fish of large size were for some time afterwards caught out of ponds of which no traces now remain. Be tween Oglethorpe street and the river the land was generally high and dry, interspersed with pretty groves of fine shade trees. But east of Oglethorpe street and all south was mostly wet swamp land.\n\nThe few houses that had been erected prior to the first sale of lots by the Commissioners were along a road that crossed the river at a ferry near where the Hospital now is. It was a section of the old \"Federal Road.\" Traces of this river crossing may still be seen on the Alabama bank. The hotel was there and three of four stores, whose principal trade was with the Indians. But when the town was laid off and the lots sold, these settlements, being out of town, eventually had to move up within the space laid out into lots. There were but few comfortable houses up to that time--some small log houses, some board houses or tents, and some Indian houses.\n\nAt that time there were a number of springs of excellent water running out of the bluff along the river. There were as many as ten or twelve of them from the \"City Mills\" loca tion down to the wharf, and they afforded plenty of the best water. Gov. Forsyth, who attended the sale of the lota in 1828, preferred to camp out in a beautiful grove just below\n\nthe present wharf, and pitched 'hi-s tent beside one of these\n\nSCB.NBBY----INDIANS FISHING, ETC.\n\n7\n\nFprings. With'the'march of civilizatioil receded the beauties\n\nPS well as the wilclness of ISTature, and these fine springs have\n\nlong since ceased their refreshing flow.\n\nThe scenery on the bank of the river was .very beautiful,\n\nincluding some of the finest natural groves/ The river, too,\n\npresented o[uite a different appearance from the muddy Chat-\n\ntahoochee of this time, with its high water-bed extended \"by\n\ncaving to twice its original extent, its banks on both sides\n\nprecipitous and bare, and those on the Alabama side still fall\n\ning in with every freshet. The waters were clear and rip\n\npling, and the rock's that presented themselves for some distance above : the steamboat landing or head of navigation\n\nnearly extended a'cross ''the river in places,'with channels'or pools between, froni which nearly all the varieties of fresh\n\nwater iish were taken in abundance'/\" 'It was interesting and\n\namusing to see the Indians catching shad in the spring of the year. They used dip-nets, made of 'waho'o bark split up in\n\nsmall strips. The net was fastened to1 the'ends of two large\n\ncanes, about fifteen feet long. They would arrange'them\n\nselves in a row, five to fifteen in number, on the edge of the\n\nplace where they wished\" 1 to dip. They would then dip their\n\nnets in regular order, one net following right after the other.\n\nWhen one caught a fish he would throw it out of his net\n\nbehind him, and never lose more than one dip. The: whole\n\nparty would yell every time there was a fish caught. But the\n\nshad, like the springs,-have long since disappeared from our\n\nriver, and some can hardly believe that the\"y wetffe ever- caught\n\nhere. The clear, fresh water of the Chattanoochee nlilst then have been much more congenial arid 'inviting\" to t3aes& dainty\n\nfish than the turbid stream of the present time';\" Muddied 'by its passage through hundreds 'of thousands of* ao'fes of* culti\n\nvated ground and polluted by7 the sewerage filth of th&: tGWft.sT\n\nand factories on its banks.\n\n--'' '\"'\n\nAn old writer describes the natural beauties of the locality\n\nat that time as follows:\n\n\"The most fertile imagination could not conceive place more enchanting than this is in reality. Neither is it deficient in the various natural capacities for tb# convenient transaction of business.\n\n8\n\nEARLY COMMERCE.\n\nStanding at the centre, the eye can feast the mind, with contemplating the most delightuj scenery, which raises a thousand romantic and poetic associations. The river on each side is adorned with forest, as beautiful as nature could make it; and the channel is made rugged and firm by the deposit* of immense heaps of solid rock. The rapids _ continue for a great distance, sometimes forcing tlie river down into a narrow channel of great'depth. and inconceivable swiftness. In the course of the descent'of the river through some of these places, the torrent is opposed by rocks of immovable fixture, which throw it up into'mountain Waves, or dash it away in a wide expanse of beautiful white caps, counter currents, and eddies.\"\n\nNATURAL ADVANTAGES.\n\nIt was apparent that these were great, and though the results, that might reasonably have been contemplated have not yet.been fully attained, the causes of the failure or delay are. also evident, and there is good reason to hope that all the anticipations of the past will yet be fully realized, if not by the agencies originally had in view, by others now progres sively at work. The location being at the permanent head of navigation:of a fine boatable stream, on the outskirts of continuous white settlement--with a strip of Indian territory sixty mile* in width separating it from white civilization and commerce in Alabama, and this Indian country one of known fertility and beauty, whose opening to white settlement was only a question of time--there was good reason to anticipate for Columbus :a rapicl growth and far-reaching trade. For some time its trade by wagon and by the river was extensive, reaching from Apalachicola to the section of country now including Heard, Carroll and Fulton counties, and embracing nearly-all the region between the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers. But railroads came from the east westward, and their general effect has been to carry trade to the east. The river trade -has been nearly broken up, and railroads connecting with more eastern cities now traverse nearly all the country from which Columbus formerly derived her distant wagon trade. We may confidently hope for a considerable extension\n\nexactly express the writer's meaning, or the river must then have\n\nMANUFACTUBING APVANTAGES.\n\n9\n\nof trade from railroads now in course of construction^ .which will give MS more direct communication with the:great West;\n\nf\n\nbut unquestionably the:, safest reliance of Columbus' for, a steady advance in business and a permanent prosperity are her great advantages for manufacturing. Her princely cotton\n\nI\n\nmills, already finding all over the Union a ready sale fdr-their\n\nsuperior fabrics, are her \"jewels/,' of which she may well be\n\nas proud as the Roman matron of her sons; and when-we\n\nconsider that not one-twentieth part of her great water power\n\nis yet appropriated, that she is in the very heart of the cotton\n\ngrowing region, with superior facilities both for obtaining the\n\nraw material and shipping the fabrics, and that the profits of\n\nthe factories now in operation are sufficient to satisfy the\n\ncupidity of the most exacting capitalist, we cannot fail to see\n\nthat this is the citadel of our strength--the firm foundation of\n\na progress and prosperity that will yet realize all the expecta\n\ntions ever indulged concerning Columbus. It is not probable\n\nthat the utilization of this great water power was one of the\n\nobjects contemplated in the selection of the site of Columbus,\n\nand good fortune rather than human sagacity favored the city\n\nin this respect.\n\n1828.\n\nINTEREST THROUGHOUT THE STATE. (\n\nMuch interest was aroused throughout the State, by the legislation looking to the establishment of the new town ! of Columbus, and the anticipated sale of the lots. The>advant-= ages of the locality were so apparent as to attract the attention^ of men of a speculating disposition, as well as of persons desiring to try their fortune in a new settlement with suchfine prospects. \"We find that complaints against the tardy action of the Commissioners, and of the gentleman selected\n\n10\n\nby ; them to make the surveys and 'prepare the plan of 4l^e\n\ntownj*-found their way into the public prints. On the-llth of\n\nJuly,, the surveyor, Mr. Edward -Jjlctyd Thomas, -defended\n\nhimself againsjt the. charge of failure to return the plain to\n\nthe Surveyor General's office, stating that he had sent the plan;\n\nto the Executive Department and to other places.\n\n;\n\nTHE POPULATION. \"'\n\n'\n\n\"''\n\n'Before the sale of the town lots the population of the place\n\nwas very much mixed, as is generally the case in new settle- '\n\nments. It amounted to about three hundred.\n\nTHE INDIANS.\n\nDuring the day there would generally be hundreds, an<j. sometimes thousands of Indians from the Alabama side in town, but they were-not allowed to stay on the Georgia side. at night. They were generally friendly and harmless while, on this side of the river, but sometimes annoying, as they would go to private houses, to the alarm of some of the ladies.' But their object was to get something to eat or steal. \\Ve find the Creeks called \"a remnant of beggars and drunk ards\" by a writer of that time.\n\nTHE COLU.MJJUS ENQUIRER.\n\nThis paper was established by Mirabeau B. Lamar in this\n\nyear, and the first number was issued during the last week in\n\nMay. It was a weekly sheet of good size and fair appear\n\nance, and its editorial conduct gave ample evidence of the\n\nability -which afterwards secured for its accomplished founder\n\nhigh positions and an enduring fame. It is chiefly from its\n\ncolumns that we glean most of the facts that nia;ke up what\n\nwe can give of the earlier history of Columbus.\n\n'\n\nOn the 5th of July, the. Enquirer said: \"Our town offers\n\nmaoy advantages to the agriculturalist who may locate near\n\nit, as well as to the merchant or mechanic, as^our market will;\n\nafford good prices for all kinds of produce, and OUT river a<\n\nsafe and convenient navigation on- cwliieh tO'export-the same.\n\nThose who may visit this place with.a view of purchasing to\n\nsettle here, will not leave us disappointed. We hear of many\n\nRIVKB NAVIGATION.\n\n11\n\ntrangera wlio have come to examine the public property\n\nefore the day of sale arrives.\"\n\n;\n\nRIVER IMPROVEMENT.\n\nAt that early day thia subject engaged the earnest attention f both the State authorities and the new settlers of Columius. They contemplated not only the improvement of the .avigation below the town, but the opening of the river bove to regular pole-boat navigation. The latter proposition rould seem, to us at this time to have been a wild scheme; lid yet we find a correspondent asserting on the 9th of August that \"the river is navigable for pole-boats 200 miles ^bove the falls; the obstruction to navigation above the town continues for twenty miles, but boats can, in the winter, come within four miles of the town ;\" and we find in the Enquirer of Sept. 13th the official report (dated \"Upper Bushy Head Shoal, Chattahoochee, 27th August, 1828,\") of \"one of the Commissioners of the Chattahoochee Navigation above the Coweta Falls,\" in which report this Commissioner informs Gov. Forsyth that with the money appropriated by the State for improving the navigation of that part of the river, the Commissioners had bought on the eastern shore of Maryland and at Charleston, S. C., \"fifteen likely negro fellows and one woman;\" that they had constructed \"an excellent three decked boat, sixty feet keel, nine feet beam, well constructed for the accommodation of the hands, overseer, and one Coin^ missioner, also for the safety of the tools and provisions and the storing of powder for blasting.\" The report goes on to state the operations on the upper river, in the section flowing between Coweta and Carroll counties, announces considerable progress, and expresses hope of the accomplishment of much improvement. Now who shall say that Georgians, at that time, and especially frontier Georgians, were not men of en terprise and pluck ?\n\nThe State Engineer also made a report (published in June) on the practicability of improving the river below the town. He recommended a \"wing-dam\" about three feet: above sum-\n\n12\n\nTOWN IXXTS SOTjD.-\n\nmer water at Woo-lfolk's bar, and an excavation of the chan nel to the desired depth, expressing the opinion that there was not the slightest probability of its re-accumulation ; also a wing-dam at Mound Shoal, a little below Woolfolk's bar, and' 'about half a mile above the mouth of XJpatoie creek.\n\nSALE OF .TH'E LOTS.\n\nThe first sale of town lots by the Commissioners com\n\nmenced on the 10th and closed on the 23d of July. The\n\nattendance was large, and the bidding lively. Many tents\n\nwere erected by persons attending the sale, and the town pre\n\nsented an animated and bustling appearance. The lot that\n\nsold highest at that sale \"was the one on the southwest corner\n\nof Broad and Crawford streets, afterwards known as the Co\n\nlumbus Hotel lot. It -was bought by Messrs. Nicholas How\n\nard (of Greensboro') and Peter Dudley, who immediately\n\nerected the \" Columbus Hotel\" on the lot.\n\nThe number of half-acre lots in, the plan of the town was\n\n632, of which 488 were sold, leaving 144 to be disposed of\n\nat, some future period. There were also sold 25 gardening\n\nlots of 10 acres each, and 20 of 20 acres, besides a number .of\n\nlarger lots outside of the limits of the town. The total pro\n\nceeds of this sale were $130,991, one-fifth of which was re\n\nquired in cash.. The highest price given was for the lot above\n\nmentioned, $1,855. _ Many, lots were bought with a view to\n\nimmediate settlement, and many others by speculators with a\n\nview to an advance.\n\n,\n\nIMPROVEMENTS.\n\nAfter the sale of .the lots, improvements commenced and buildings went up rapidly. On the 28th of November the Enquirer said: \"Notwithstanding the great disadvantage's which builders have labored under in procuring lumber, we can safely say that no place has improved more rapidly than the town of Columbus, Each holder of a lot or lots seems intent on improving his property immediately, and there are now either completed or nearly so, oil the half-acre lots, nearly a hundred good framed buildings. Our mills are now\n\nINCIDENTS.\n\n13\n\nin better order for supplying lumber than-they have *ever been before. But one three-story framed-bouse has-yet-been erected, and but two-brick buildings commenced in the town. We should be pleased to see more of this description of building carried on.\"\n\nAbout this time the Enquirer stated that the population numbered 700 to 1,000 souls, and felt grateful that the health was so good, saying that there had not been more than, a half dozen cases of fever during the whole summer, and but four deaths--three whites and one black.\n\nINCIDENTS.\n\nThe first person buried' in the cemetery was a young man. by the name of Thomas--a son of Edward Lloyd Thomas, the gentleman mentioned as the surveyor. He was buried on the hill before the location was fully determined upon, but when determined it included the grave of young Thomas. He was buried in March of this year.\n\nThe 4th of July was celebrated in a spirited arid patriotic manner for a frontier settlement. Col. Ulysses Lewis \\vas the reader of the declaration, and James Van Xcss the orator.\n\nA theater was \"erected\" for the purpose and opened for a short engagement as early as July of this year, and we find the performances of the company highly complimented. But we suppose the Columbus theatre-goers of that day were hardly so critical or discriminating as those of the present time, and there was some difference between the rough, un suitable hall in which the . performance was given and Springer's Opera House \"with its fine scenery and luxurious furnishing.\n\nThe first manufacturing establishment that was built here was a turning lathe, erected on, the little branch north, of the city, just below where the ISTortlx, and .South Railroad now crosses that branch. Nobody thought in 1828, \"when that little turning lathe was started, that Columbus would ever be the manufacturing place it is now, even; much less did they entertain the hope that .it would ever win the appellation, \" Lowell of the South.\"\n\n14\n\nINCIDENTS,\n\nThe first steamboat that came to Columbus was in March, 1828. After she had been here a week or ten days, making some repairs, the Captain arranged for a pleasure excursion down the river as far as Woolfolk's Mound, the next Sunday. Nearly every body went, and a good number of them had to sralk .back to town on account, as the captain alleged, not being able to raise sufficient steam for the boat to make headway against the river current. The next morning about daybreak the signal gun* of the boat was heard, giving notice of her return.\n\nThere were no churches here during this year. There would occasionally be preaching by some missionary to the frontier heathen, or by some traveling minister. Columbus was a pretty \"hard\" place for a year or two. There was not much, execution of law or government of any kind. Every body had to look out for themselves. This being the case, we are not surprised to find the files of the Enquirer for those years abounding with reports of duels, impromptu fights, and duelling correspondence.\n\nThe following, in regard to the streets and scenery of Co lumbus, from the Enquirer of August 9th, 1828, will still be of interest. The streets remain as originally laid out, but the \"romantic walks\" and gushing springs are among the things that were:\n\n\" The streets running parallel with the river are nine in number, and are all 132 feet wide, except Broad, which is 164 feet wide. This street is one and a half miles long, and is a perfect level the whole distance, except one depression. The cross streets are thirteen in number, and are each 99 feet wide. From the width o the streets an elegant and airy appearance is given to the town. There is a wide expanse left between the town and the river for a. promenade, \"which, after it shall have been properly prepared, will form one of the hand somest and most romantic walks in the State. All along the bank of the river opposite the town, fine, pure water gushes out, which affords not only a great convenience, but a great luxury to citizens.' 7\n\nIn October, Henry C. Dawson took charge of the Mclntosh\n\nCOXJNTY OFFICERS.\n\n15\n\nHouse, and Beter Dudley became sole proprietor of the ; Co\n\nlumbus Hotel.\n\n'\n\n.\n\nA new hotel, called \"Muscogee Hall,\" on the corner of\n\nBroad and Crawford streets, was opened in. ; November- by\n\nNicholas Howard.\n\nAt the Presidential election in November, the Jackson\n\nelectors received 143 votes, and the Adams electors 17.\n\nThe first bale of cotton ever sold in the town was brought\n\nin November from Gwinnctt county, and bought by Robert\n\nMaharrey at 12J-C.\n\nOn the 29th of November the pole-boat Rob Roy, Love\n\nowner, arrived from Apalachicola with a full cargo of groce-,\n\ni-ics for J. Fontaine, Maharrey, Love & Co.\n\nA clever local conundrum which w:e find hi the paper is\n\nthis: \"Why is the town of Columbus like modest ladies?\"\n\nThe answer^-\" Because it is on the reserve.\" .\n\n'\n\n;\n\nOFFICERS.\n\nHon. Walter T. Colquitt was Judge, and Andrew B. Griffin\n\nClerk of the Superior Court this year.

Lamar severed his connection with the Mnquirer on the 1st of October, 1830. He represented Muscog-ee county in the Legislature of Georgia in 1829 '30. Shortly after his retirement from, the -Enquirer he removed to Texas, artd there received the highest honors within the gift of the people. He was elected President of the young and inde pendent Republic in 1838. He died in Texas in December, 1859. Gen. L. was twice married. His first wife is buried in the cemetery in this city ; his second was a daughter of the Rev. John ISTewland Maffitt.\n\n\"Walter T. Colquitt was for a number of years the most brilliant (perhaps not the most solid) member of the bar of Columbus. He was noted for keenness of wit and repartee and versatility of talent. As a lawyer, judge, both a repre sentative and senator in Congress, he was equally conspicuous and efficient. He died in Macon, Ga., on the 7th of May, 1855, after a long and painful illness.\n\nMARRIAGES.\n\nJuly 28.--Col. P. I-I. Alston and Miss Sarah D. Parks. Sept. 6.--Ma.i. Hufus M.

It pro vided for the election on the 1st Monday in January, 1829, of an Iiitendant and six Commissioners, and vested the municipal government in them. The election resulted in the choice of Ulysses Lewis as Mayor, and Samuel B. Head, James \"Van Ness, Ira Scott, Simon L. Smith, George \"W\". Dillard and Thos. G-,Gordon as Commissioners. [Another ticket for Commis sioners, \"which associated Messrs. Van Ness and Scott with. M, B. Lamar, Fitzgerald Bird, T. T. Gammage and Henry C, Phelps, had previously been nominated by. a meeting of citi zens ; but Messrs. Lamar,. Bird and Gammage declined before the day of election.]\n\nOn the same day county officers for Muscogee were elected, as follows: Arian Coaker, Tax Collector; James Johnson, Receiver of Tax Returns; E. E. Bissel, Jas. Hitchcock, B. A.\n\n-LS\n\nACTION' OF TOWN AUTHORITIES.\n\nSorsby, Samuel K. Andrews and W. P. Baker, Justices of the\n\nInferior Court.\n\n. . :>- . .\n\nB. T. Marks was Clerk of the new city government.\n\nOn tiie 19th of January, t( nine fisheries on the Chattahoo-\n\nchee, within the corporate limits of the town of Columbus,\"\n\nwere publicly rented out for' the year by the Clerk of the\n\nTown ; but the amounts for which they rented are not pub\n\nlished. All other traps were required to be removed within\n\nten days.\n\nIn accordance with authority specially delegated bv the\n\nnew charter, the first ordinance of the municipal government\n\nwas one requiring all houses on the streets and common to be\n\nremoved, and forbidding all persons to cut down or destroy\n\nany tree on the river common.\n\nAt this time the \"Northern and Southern mail\" was\n\ncarried through Columbus, tri- weekly, accross the Indian\n\nTerritory, via the Creek Agency in Alabama.\n\nOn the 27th day of February, the, sale of .the remaining\n\nhalf-acre lots in Columbus was closed, Having continued six\n\ndays. The aggregate amount of the sales was $4,585.\n\nThe Intendant and Commissioners passed an ordinance' to \"\n\nlet out to the highest bidder, on the 2d of February, the work\n\nof cleaning out of Front, Broad, Oglethorpe, Randolph, and\n\nSt. Clair streets--the two latter to their intersection with\n\nOglethorpe. Front, Broad and Oglethorpe were to be cleaned\n\nentirely of trees, stumps, and bushes, which were to be taken\n\nup by the roots, the streets to be grabbed, and all rocks over\n\nthree pounds in weight to be removed.\n\nWe take this order as an indication of the extent to which'\n\nclose occupation of the town had then progressed from the\n\nriver eastward.\n\nOn the 14th o February, the JZnquirer said:\n\n\" Columbus is rapidly advancing in improvements. Building is .carried on in a style that would do honor to our populous cities, and with a rapidity scarcely equalled within our knowledge. Sucli is the progressive style, that we frequently Hud large two-storied houses and well-cleaned gardens, in various parts of tlie town, where Tmt a\n\nshort time previously, we were rambling after game. Ramblers are\n\nINCIDENTS.\n\n19\n\nnot unfrequently surprised at finding their hunting ground so sudden ly converted from a wilderness into cultivated fields or adorned by the labors of the architect and enlivened by traffic. We have dry goods and groceries in abundance, and all the difficulty in the way of good living is the want of the wherewith to purchase the commodities. Few of our citizens having the necessary cash or credit, are often re duced to deplorable straits. The absence of the grand sine qua nonr however, seems to be no barrier to the growth of the town.\"\n\nThere was much apprehension, this year, of trouble with the Indians. The Legislature passed an act forbidding their crossing the river into Georgia without permits. In July the President of the United States had a thousand stand of arms forwarded to Fort Mitchell for the use of the frontier citizens, arid thirty or forty regulars, on their way to the Agency, passed through Columbus in July. But many of the head men of the Indian nation visited Columbus and pronounced the reports of their hostile intentions false. The \"Frontier Guards\" were, however, ordered out on one occasion.\n\nPolitics ran so high this year, that we find an advertise ment offering prime cotton for sale by retail to \"anti-tariff ladies.\"\n\nOn the 10th of November the Commissioners appointed for the purpose announced that they had laid out a market road from Decatur to Columbus.\n\nThe Bank of Columbus was organized this year. We find the names of the following steamboats that arrived during the year: Fanny, Robert Ernmett, and \"VirginiaThe latter was the first arrival of the winter, and did not get. up until the 28th of December, so low was the river, in the fall and early winter. The Bmrnett made one trip in 60 hours.\n\nINCIDENTS.\n\nOn the -- of January, Mr. Elisha Avery, a native of Con necticut, and four negroes were drowned by the upsetting of a batteau in which they were making a trip from Columbus to Apalachicola. The Mayor, Col. Lewis, Mr. Root, and eight negroes in all were in the boat, but all except tliose first men tioned escaped.\n\n20\n\nINCIDENTS.\n\n--There Was a great rise of the Chattahoochee in February of; this year. Back lots (in the lower portions heretofore mentioned) were inundated, and the house of the editor of the Enquirer was submerged almost to its windows. - On the 25th of May, the steamer Virginia, a large and fine boat, arrived, having made the run from Apalachicola in 38 hours.\n\nW, A. Spaldihg, of the firm of Fqntainc & Spalding, was drowned in the Chattahoochee on the 1st of June. He was a native of Maryland, and was only 21 years old.\n\nA temperance soci'ety was organized on the 1st of August-- E, L. DeGraffonricd, President; Andrew Harvill and Rob't Jones, Vice Presidents; James Van. ISTess, Corresponding Sec retary ; James W. Pannin, Recording Secretary; Thos, W.

Marks had purchased a half interest in the Enquirer.\n\nIn September, TJpatoie post office was established--Simon Manning, postmaster.\n\nAt the October election of this year, M. B. Lamar, Senator, and W. P. Lucas, Representative, were elected to the Legis lature.\n\nOct. 17th, the first load of new cotton was Torougrit in \"by John D. Chambless of Talbot county. It was classed mid dling, and \"bought by S. & B. T. Woolfolk at 7c.\n\nThe Virginia again arrived on the 28th of ^December, being the first \"boat of trie winter, afte-r a suspension of navigation in the summer and fall. The Virginia took down 400 bales of cotton for New Orleans.\n\nOn the 7th of March 500 shares of the stock of the Bank of Columbus had \"been taken, and it was anticipated that the Bank \"would speedily go into operation .under favorable auspices.\n\nThe Superior Court of the county then took jurisdiction of such offences as fighting in the streets and keeping disorderly houses in Columbus, as we find in the presentments of the Grand Jury at February term.\n\nMARRIAGES\n\n2.1\n\nThe town tax this year was 5 per cent, upon the amount\n\npaid to the State for the town lots.\n\nWe find the names of two Columbus volunteer companies\n\n-- the \" Frontier Guards\" and the \" Columbus Fencibles\"\n\nmentioned in June. A. Y. Gresham was Captain^ and ------\n\nMarks, Orderly Sergeant of the \" Frontier Guards. \"\n\nThe 4th of July was celebrated under an arbor--a large\n\ncrowd attending.

Marks.\n\n2\n\n22\n\nKAPID INCREASE IN POPULATION.\n\n1830.\n\nIMPROVEMENT AND PROSPERITY.\n\nThe frontier settlement had now assumed the proportions\n\nand the air of a \"trading town\" indeed, and its pioneer set\n\ntlers congratulated themselves on the prospect of realizing\n\ntheir fondest anticipations. An amendment of the charter so\n\nas to obtain a \"city government\" was talked of. On the 27th\n\nof February the J5nquirer said :\n\n\" ]Sfo inland town of the South within our recollection lias pro gressed with more rapidity in the line of substantial and elegant improvements, and none, we are certain, lias a fairer prospect of attaining extensive commercial importance. At the time of the sales (July, 1828,) there was but one frame building erected in this town, and there are now seventy-five excellent and permanent frame build ings, all of which, with one or two exceptions, are occupied. There are, also, twelve dry goods and grocery stores, one drug store, a-iid two commodious and extensive hotels. These improvements have all been made while doubt and uncertainty existed in relation to the growth and prosperity of Columbus, and whilst no settled conviction obtained in the minds of any of the actual value of property in which invest- . merits were made. But every day is developing the true resources of Columbus, and exhibiting its real claims to the attention and patron age of wealth, industry and talent.\"\n\nThe population, as reported by the Marshal in April, -was 1,152 persons; as reported to the Enquirer by Dr. DeGraffen.ried (a State census) in October, it was then 1,261. The population of the county of Muscogee, at the last named count, was 3,507, of whom 2,262 were whites.\n\nThe regular navigation of the river was still a question of some uncertain.tj'-. A steamboat--the \" Steubenville\"--Had arrived as early as the 22d of February, 1828, being the first steamer that had ever reached \"the falls;\" but the boats at first run were evidently too large, or of too heavy draught, for navigating the river .either early in the fall or late in the\n\nINCIDENTS.\n\n23\n\nspring. The \" Baltimore\" made a trip this year late in April, and was said by trie JSnquirer to be the only one of the boats in the trade suitable to the navigation of the river so late in the spring. It thought that boats drawing, -when loaded, from 30 to 36 inches, could run throughout the year.\n\nThe citizens were now solicitous for the removal of the Indians--no doubt speculating views as well as apprehensions of trouble with them influencing the appeals for their removal. The first fire reported in the town was on the night of the 14th of March, when the kitchen of Mr. Davis was consumed. It aroused some of the citizens to make a call for a public meeting' to take into consideration some measures for protec tion against fire. But, as is usual with the first cry of \"wolf,\" the excitement appears to have subsided without action.\n\nA debating society in full blast this year was one evidence of social and intellectual improvement.\n\nAt the municipal election in January, James Van Ness was elected Intendant. K. T. Marks was Town Clerk this year, and John E. Page Treasurer. Moses Butt -was acting as In tendant in November. We cannot find the names .of. the Town Commissioners of this year.\n\nThe prospectus for a new paper, to be called the Democrat, was out in August. '\n\nThere was a controversy, during the fall, between Lieut. Clark, of the TJ. S. Artillery, and the authorities of Columbus, as to whether the Indians were entitled to the -west bank of the river and to equal interests in the ferries established over it. The town authorities denied this right and refused to comply with the demand.\n\nINCIDENTS.\n\nThe discovery of particles of gold on the river bank, in April, is mentioned. It no doubt created a sensation. As the precious metal appears not to have been found since then, and as we now know that the Chattahoochee and its tributa ries cross the gold belt at several points, the probability is\n\n24\n\nINCIDENTS.\n\nthat the gold found in 1830 was washed down with, the sands from above in some -freshet.\n\nA new hotel, called Lafayette Hall, was opened in. tlie spring of this year--John, C. Blan.ce proprietor. It was on the cor ner of Oglethorpe and Bridge streets.\n\nThe 4th of July was again celebrated with, becoming spirit. The \"Frontier Guards\" headed the procession. Maj. A. 1~\\ Moore was Marshal of the day ; the prayer was by Hev. Mr. Moore; Col. Ulysses Lewis was the reader of the Declaration, and M. B. Lamar, Ksq'., the orator. A public dinner at How ard's Hotel wound, up the celebration with a feast of good things, including patriotism and hilarity.\n\nThe first load of new cotton was received on the 15th of September. It was from the plantation of Mr. MeQehee, of Meriwether county, and -was sold to Stew art & Fontaine at 10 cents. The next week several loads were received, and sold at 10^- to 11 cents. Nearly 100 bales were received on the 28th of October -- reported as an unusually large day's receipts.\n\n- In July, Mr. .Lamar retired from the Enquirer, having sold his interest to Mr. James Van ISfess. In November, Mr. Maries sold his interest to Messrs. Henry W. Hilliard and Jarnes 1ST. Bethime.\n\nIn April, same \"malicious villain.\" entered the Enquirer office at night and pied the forms and cases.\n\nThe anniversary of St. John the Baptist was celebrated \"by the Columbian Lodge of Columbus. The address was deliv ered by Hev. Barkley Martin. H. S-. Taylor was Secretary of this Lodge.\n\nAt the county election in October, Sowell Woolfolk was elected Senator, and A. Y. Gresham Representative.\n\nA new pole boat, called the \" Mary Jones,\" was launched by Hodges, Moore & Co., in September.\n\nPole boats arrived and departed frequently during this year,\n\nThe first steamboat arrival of this winter was the \" Ealti-\n\nI\n\nPEHSCXNAL.\n\nZO\n\nI\n\nmore,\" on the 17th day of December, in five days from Apa-\n\nlachicola.\n\n1 On the 22d December, the steamer Georgian, a new boat\n\nbuilt at Pittsburgh for a company of gentlemen of Colum\n\nbus, arrived in fifteen days from. Pittsburgh.\n\nPERSONAL.\n\nThe county officers, elected in January, were--Win. Hol land, Sheriff; A. B. Griffin, Clerk of the Superior Court; John Townsend, Clerk of the Inferior Court.\n\nThe following gentlemen constituted Muscogce grand jury for the Spring term of 1830: J. W. Fannin, E. C. Alford, Asa Bates, H. R. Taylor, David Dean, William Mullally, Da vid W. Upton, S. B. Andrews, 35. L. Lucas, W. D. Lucas, B G. Lucas, H. C. Phelps, A. R. Mershon, B. Jewett, J. B. Lyons, B. Tarver, A. L. Watkins, Neill McNorton, J. P. Jack son, Thomas Davis, Jonathan A, Hudson.\n\nJulius G, Alford did not long remain a citizen of Columbus, hut removed in a short time to LaGrange, and while residing there was elected, to Congress in. 1889. He had notable char acteristics and an originality sui generis. His impetuous and impulsive style of debate won for him the appropriate name \"War Horse of Troup.\" It is reported of him that while in Congress he startled the House from its propriety by a terrific imitation of the Indian war-whoop, which he did in answer to a Northern member who had defended the Georgia and Alabama Indians and blamed the whites for their warlike demonstrations. He removed to Alabama about the year 1850, settling in Pike County, and died there several years ago.\n\nUlysses Lewis was a man of characteristics peculiarly fitted to impress and mould frontier society, and no doubt contrib uted much to the giving of tone to the civilization of both Columbus and Russell county, Ala., to which county he re moved with the first wave of white settlement. He was sternly upright and just, with a courage for any emergency, and.a fund of hard common sense that made hiiji the very\n\n26\n\nMAKRIAGES AND DEATHS.\n\nman for leadership in such a country. After his removal to Alabama he was for a rrumber of years Judge of the County (now Probate) Court of Russell, and made one of the best and most satisfactory county officers in the State. He died in August, 1856.\n\nMARRIAGES.\n\nMarcli 11--Dr. Wiley J. Underwood and Miss Mary Ann liohaimoii. April 7--James Kivlin and Miss JjCmisa DilHird.

S. Shorter, M. Butt, A. Iverson, G. W. Dillingham, and Joel Branham. At a subsequent meeting of directors, E. S. Shorter was elected President, and Edward Carey Cashier.\n\nA fire \"which occurred at an early hour of the morning of the 21st of May, appears to have fanned the , feeling in favor of a fire company to a striking heat, and before the sun went down that day the company was formed and the following gentlemen were elected officers : G. E, Thomas, Chief En gineer; Asa Bates, Captain of the Engine; Robt. Jones, Cap tain Fire Hook Department; James Daniel, Captain Ladder Department Joseph T. Camp, Captain Bucket Department; M. \"W.

As the building had not been delivered, the loss \"was divided between Mr. Stewart and the builders--Messrs. Bates and Dibble.\n\nThis was a hard year with the Indians across .the river,\n\n28\n\nDAILY MAILS.\n\nand increased vigilance to prevent them committing1 depreda tions was found to be necessary. They suffered greatly for the \"want of food--which \"was ascribed in part to the failure of their corn crops and in part to the scarcity of game, and they were terribly afflicted with the small pox. They were constantly begging at every house, and subsisted in great part on roots and the bark of trees. During this year Dr. DeGraffenried visited the Nation, and on his return advised general vaccination as a preventive of small pox m Colum bus. There were one or two cases in the town, and alarm on the subject extended to the surrounding country.\n\nOn the 15th of October, the building committee of the Presbyterian Church announced that the house would be dedicated on, the following Sunday, when a collection would be taken up to assist in paying the sum due on the building. They also returned thanks to the citizens for liberal contribu tions towards this church. Mr. J. S. Norman was Secretary.\n\nThe local causes of sickness in some parts of the town, mentioned in the first chapter of this compilation, seem to have found, during this year, fit conditions for their develop ment. On the 20th of October, the Enquirer said:\n\n\"Our town ha-s suffered much in comparison with other years. Sickness has been confined almost exclusively to sections of the town where there are large quantities of standing water, collected by exces sive rains which fell in August and September. On Broad street and some other portions of the town there has been almost perfect health. The local causes which have produced disease the present season will be entirely removed before the return of another summer.\"\n\nNovember 19--Number of deaths that have occurred jn the town of Columbus from the first day of June, 1831, to this date, taken by order of the Commissioners: White adults 20; white children 20; black adults 8; black children 9; total 57.\n\nOut of the above number forty have died of fever, three in child bed, and two from intemperance.\n\nColumbus then had a Northern mail daily, via Augusta, Milledgeville and Macori, and a daily Southern mail via Mont gomery and Mobile. There was also a stage line from Colum\n\nbus to Macon, run via Thomaston and Forsyth, and the fare\n\nINCIDENTS.\n\n29\n\nwas $8 50 to Macon. The stage left Columbus every Friday at 7 a. m., and arrived at Maeon about noon on Sunday, trav eling only in the day time. There were several other weekly mails, but we are not informed as to their modes of convey ance.\n\nINCIDENTS.\n\nThe steamboats, whose arrivals and departures during the year we fmd noticed were the following: Herald, PlaquernineT Marion, Baltimore, Jenkins, Georgian.\n\nThere was great xejoicing over the arrival of the Georgian on the 12th of January, not only because she was owned by a Columbus company, but because she was intended to inau gurate competition in boating. A- large crowd met her at the wharf, and hailed her arrival by a salute from a cannon, &c. She had on her own decks over 1,000 barrels of freight, and towed the barge Mary Jones with 700 barrels.\n\nThe Musoogee Bible Society was in active operation, sup plying Bibles to the destitute. There was also a circulating library. ^In February, H. \"W\".

Good navigation continued until late in the spring, and opened again early in November, and. large stocks of goods were re ceived and sold. The year was also a healthy one.\n\nIn January the following municipal ticket was elected for\n\nthe year 1832: -fntendant---Samuel X-awhoii. Gom,missi<mers--G-. IS. Thomas, Charles I>. Stewart, G-. W. Dilling-\n\nIiain, Hiram JSTonrse, William Z>. Lucas, 75Hsha Tarver. II- C. Phelps was Town Clerk. One of the first acts of the now Board was to advertise for\n\nproposals to build a bridge across the Chattah.oocb.ee. The bridge was to be about four hundred feet long, including the abutments, and to be built high and strong and of good mate rials. During the first week in March, the proposal of John Godwin, of Cheraw, S. C., was accepted; the plan of Ithiel Town's patent to be followed, with stone piers and abutments, for $14,000. Daniel Pratt, of Clinton, furnished the model adopted, and was paid $100 for it. Mr. Godwin, with a large force, commenced, work on the bridge in May, \"but did. not finish it this year.\n\nOn the 23d of January an event occurred which shocked the community, and made men think more seriously of the sad results likely to follow the many personal quarrels (gen erally springing from politics) that were then\" so common.. One of these difficulties occurred \"between Gen. Sowell \"Woolfolk, then State Senator, and who had represented the county in one branch, of the Legislature each year since its organiza tion, and Major Joseph T. Camp, a talented lawyer and pop ular man. They had had a difficulty, without the use of weapons, at Milledgeville, and had then repaired to Kort Mitchell to settle the affair with pistols, but it was there adjusted temporarily. Then followed some publications in the paper, in which it was made to appear that the concession had been entirely on the side of Camp, and this led to a re newal of hostile correspondence, -with the sad result told in the following \"obituary\" from the Jffinquirer:\n\nFAT All DUEL.\n\nS3\n\n\"Oil Monday last, 23d instant, an unfortunate meeting, commonly known by the name of an afirair of honor, took place near 3?ort Mitehell, between G-en. Sowell \"Woolfolk and Major Joseph T, Camp, which terminated in the death of the former. Gen.. \"Woolfolk was shot through the breast, and expired in a few seconds, and Major Camp narrowly escaped life, \"being snot through the abdomen, but fortunate ly for him without entering the hollow.\n\n\"The next day the body of Gen. AVoolfolk was brought to tins city and interred with military and Masonic honors. Ilia remains\" were followed by the most numerous and respectable concourse of his friends, acquaintances and fellow-citizens which has ever been seen 011 such an occasion.\n\n\"In recording this melancholy occurrence humanity shudders at the reflection that the talents, worth and chivalry of our country should be subject to such a barbarous custom. !N\"o matter how high and re spectable in society, how surrounded with friends, how closely united and necessary to the peace and comfort--yea, even the neces sity of a wife and family--how useful and important to the State-- all must bow before the unrelenting tyrant. Gen. Woolfolk was warm, devoted friend, a kind and an affectionate brother, a tender and indulgent husband arid father, the id.ol of his family, and occu pied a high position in the influence of his fellow-citizens. But he is no more! His relatives bewail his loss; to his country his talents and usefulness are gone forever. lie has frequently represented tins county in the J.-e^isIature of the State, and by that body \"was promoted to the rank of a l^rigadier-Genexai, and he has iMwev sought in vain the confidence and suffrage of his geuerous people. But he is gone for ever. -To more shall his high and buoyant step gladden the heart of his disconsolate wife.; no more shall his cheering voice awaken the smile of his infant child. 'Alas! nor wife nor child shall he again behold; nor friends nor sacred home. : \"\n\nThis being the 100th anniversary of the birthday of Wash\n\ning, the 22d of February was celebrated with much anima\n\ntion. The Columbus Musketeers, the Masonic fraternity and\n\na large concourse of citizens formed the procession to the\n\nnew Methodist Church,, where, after a prayer by the Kev. Mr.\n\nFew, \"Washington's Farewell Address was read by Dr. John\n\nJ. Wilson, and an appropriate oration delivered by James\n\n\"Van Ness, Esq. A public dinner followed, as usual, at the\n\nColumbus Hotel.\n\nAbout this time Congress passed an act authorizing the\n\ncorporation of the town of Columbus to select two acres of\n\n34\n\nG-REAT PURCHASE,\n\nland on the Alabama side for the abutment of the bridge across the Chattahoocb.ee ; biit this grant was to be \"subject to the incumbran.ee of the Indian claim,\" and no houses were to be erected thereon [by the town authorities] even after the extinction of the Indian title.\n\nLater in the year (June 22d) the Enquirer announced the sale of these two acres and other land on the Girarcl side, as follows :\n\nGreat Purchase--By the treaty recently concluded at \"Washington with the Creek Indians, a reserve of one mile square, situated imme diately opposite the town of Columbus, and bounded, by the western bank of the Chtitttihooch.ee, was granted in fee simple to .Tieirjamin Marshall, a half breed Indian. This reserve from its location on the Chattahooch.ee, at the head of steamboat navigation, and its con tiguity to Columbus, has been supposed to possess many advantages, and to be very valuable. .It was purchased of the grantee on the 19th inst., by Col. Daniel MeDougald, of Harris, and Dr. Robert Collins, of Macou, for the sum of thirty-five thousand dollars. The lines marking the reserve have not yet been run, but it is supposed will ex tend from the upper limit of this town to some distance below the center. The bridge now constructing across the Cluittaliooeh.ee river will rest on this reserve, and possibly the feny owned by the corpora tion of Columbus may land within its limits.\n\nWe learn from, one of the owners that this property has been pur chased with a view of establishing a, town on the opposite bank of the river, and with the design of enjoying the advantages and facilities afforded by the falls for milling and manufacturing purposes, and those presented by the erection of a bridge.\n\n\"We may get some idea of the extent of the export trade of Columbus for this year from the following statement of the outgoing commerce of Apalachicola. Exports from Apalachicola for the six months ending July 1st: Cotton, 16,000 bales; hides, 2,528; lumber, 491,000 feet; sugar, 129 hhds.; Staves, 40,000 ; vessels entered 64 ; cleared 67. Of course all this cotton was not shipped from Columbus, but all the cotton which Columbus shipped that year must have gone to Apa lachicola. It is probable that very little of the other articles (except perhaps hides) went from Columbus.\n\nOn the 4th of August, the Itinqiiirer, noticing the presents-\n\nINCIDENTS.\n\n35\n\ntion to tile three banks of the town of bills to the amount of $93,000, all of -which \"was promptly paid, said :\n\n\"\"Well done, Columbus ! ITour years ago a howling wilderness; now a handsome town, with a population of 1,800 souls and three banks in successful operation to meet their paper with silver if necessary. In addition to the heretofore rapid growth of our town, we notice on Broad street several large and costly brick buildings growing up, and a very extensive warehouse and other arrangements making to receive the cotton crop of next season. Twice the quantity of goods sold last year are being ordered for the ensuing fall and winter, and every preparation is being made to afford facilities for trade and pay liberal prices for cotton. The corporation is building a splendid bridge across tlie river, which will add mach to the beauty and convenience of our town. We have three churches, a theatre, a book store, and a circulating library, and last, but not least, a handsome public garden, now in successful operation. It is situated at the lower end of the town, along tho bank of the river, opposite that very abundant spring called Hansill's spring. This, garden, called \"Spring Garden,\" was commenced last winter by Mr. Henry C. Plielps, and by whose Indus try and scientific taste, it has become a beautiful and pleasant resort for our citizens; at the same time affording a delicious harvest of all the various vegetables and fruits common to this latitude.\"\n\nThe following were the names, and the condition on the 1st\n\nDecember of this year, of the three banks above referred to : The Farmers' bank, with paid up capital stock of $60,000, had bills\n\nin circulation to amount of $91,881 ; deposits $32,579 ; silver $70,171 71 ; gold bullion $18,000.\n\nThe Bank of Columbus, \"with a paid up capital of $120,000, had in circulation $229,972; deposits $13,603 50; silver $132,951 92; gold $301 50.\n\nThe Insurance Bank, with capital stock of $150,000, had in circu lation $101,299 ; deposits $7,965 28, gold and silver $70,375 72.\n\nIn December the Legislature passed an act to establish a Mayor's Court for the town of .Columbus.\n\nINCIDENTS.\n\nA gin factory was started early in this year by Ephraim\n\nBrown. A treaty made with the Indians, this year, by the United\n\nStates Government, gave great satisfaction to the citizens of Columbus. By this treaty the Creek Nation of Indians ceded to the United States all their lands in Alabama, and were to\n\n36\n\nINCIDENTS.\n\nbe removed to a location west of Mississippi river within five years. The Choctaws had previously made a similar treatyThe Creek Chiefs signing this treaty -were Opotheoholo (he who \" had no father or mother--thunder and lightning struck a hollow tree, and out jumped Opotheoholo,\") Tuckahatchee Hadjo, EQematta, \"William McGilivray, and Benjamin Marshall.\n\nThe receipt of goods in 24 days from New York was con sidered such a feat of rapid transportation as to call for special notice at this period.\n\nThe Bank of Columbus went into active operation in the spring. Gen. James C. .\"Watson was President, Burton Hepburn Cashier, and James C. Watson, James Wads worth, Daniel McDougald, Lewis C. Alien and Jona. A. Hudson Di rectors.\n\nOn the 4th of July the procession was headed by the Mus keteers and the Temperance Society; prayer by Eev. Mr. Few, reading by James Childers, and oration by James A. Berthelot.\n\nA female academy, under the superintendence of Misses Gunby and Grigg, was open in July; it was announced in December that Rev. John Baker had been employed to take charge of the male academy. Mrs. E. J. Smith had a music and painting school. G. J. McCleeky had an \"infant school.\"\n\nThere was some alarm, this year, about the cholera, which prevailed in other places, but Columbus escaped.\n\nThe first load of new cotton of this year was brought in on the 27th of September, and on the 28th about 20 bales were received. Price 9 cents.\n\nAt the Presidential election, Columbus gave 252 votes for the Jackson (or Troup) electors, and 15 for the Clay (or Clark) ticket.\n\nThe Enquirer \"was somewhat \"stirred up\" by the passage of three loads of cotton from Harris county through Coluimbus to Montgomery.

Political excitement ran high between the Troup and Clark parties, and occasioned many personal controversies, the sad result of one of which forms the most startling inci dent in the history of the town for that year.\n\nAt the election on the first Monday in January, the follow ing municipal oulcers were chosen :\n\nIniettriant--Alien Lifiwhoii.

The excitement on the subject of the cholera, which con\n\ntinued its ravages in some parts of the country, was to some extent shared in. Columbus. The scourge reached Apalachicola, and its existence in that town, with which Columbus had such direct and indispensable communication, quickened\n\nthe apprehension on the subject. A meeting of citizens to consider the matter was held in June, and a report submit ted by a committee composed principally of physicians was\n\n40\n\nSTARTLING- {TRAGEDY.\n\nadopted. It recommended the strictest attention to diet, cleanliness, temperance, &c., and the keeping of the Indians out of town; but it did not recommend a quarantine against Apalachioola, though we find that navigation had not at that time closed for the summer. ColumVns escaped tlie cliolera, and we may add that; it has escaped during every visitation of this dreadful disease to America.\n\nThe tragedy to which we have above alluded, and which for a long time afterwards - caused rankling and bitter feelings, occurred ovi the 14th. of August. It \"was the killing of MajJoseph T. Camp by Col. John Milton. They wore opposing politicians, Milton being a Troup, and Gamp a Clark man, and both were lawyers of ability. The quarrel commenced with a communication signed \"Carroll,\" published in the Co lumbus Democrat, which harshly attacked Milton. The editor of the JJemocrat was Coaam TCmir Bartlefct, and upon him Milton made a demand for the name of the writer of the communication. Bartlctt refused to give the name, but avowed his own personal responsibility. - This led to a card from Milton, published in the J'ii-qui,rert in wliich he declared that no man of honor could notice Bartlef/t, because of his \"debased condition in society.\" Milton further said in his card that he was satisfied that he knew the writer of \"Carroll,\" and he proceeded to particularize him in such a way as to show that he understood Camp to be the man. Ho \" venti lated\" Camp's previous life, or some reported incidents in hia previous life, in a caustic manner. Gamp replied in a style equally contemptuous and abusive, neither admitting nor de nying that he wrote the communication. \"Carroll,\" but con tending that B;irtlett's assumption of responsibility for it was sufficient on that point. The matter rested here, so far as newspaper controversy was involved, for about three weeks, but old citizens say that insults wore exchanged between, them, occasionally on the streets until the day of the killing of Camp. This event was thus noticed by the Knquirer of August 10th:\n\nIXCIDEXTS.\n\n41\n\n\" On Monday morning la fit Ma.j. Joseph T. Camp of this place was killed by Col. John Milton..\n\nu As there had been existing- between, these two gentlemen \"for some time a controversy, which has resulted thus tragically, and as we doubt not many and contradictory n-.ports have gone out in relation to it, we presume that our readers are desirous of bearing a correct account of the affair.\n\n\" That \"we may be the bettor able to give this, we shall confine our selves to the testimony, which was heard before the examining court.\n\n' L Immediately after the oecuiTem'e Col. Milton gave himself up to tlie civil authorities, and was brought before Judge- Thomas for examination. Upon the (examination, it appeared in. evidence that there liad been a long wtaudijig difficulty between the deceased and Milton ; that Milton had frequently understood recently that the deceased had. threatened to shoot him in the- street. On Monday morning- la.st, Mil ton was standing on the street near Gen. Howard's store, a.nd,sa.w Camp coming down the street in the direction of where he was stand ing--he slept into the store and picked up a double barrel gun and .shot Camp, discharging the first barrel into bis left breast and the other, as, he fell, into bis back. Upon the bearing of the testimony, the Court upon application admitted the prisoner to bail. On Thursday the grand jury found a true bill for murder, and on Friday the coun sel on the part or prosecution moved to have Milton committed ; upon hearing of argument the court decided lie should be admitted to bail.\"\n\nIXCI'-DKKTS.\n\nThe territory acquired from the Creek Indians having been\n\ndivided into counties, in. December, 1832, by the Legislature of Alabama, the county of Russell was then, formed, and we\n\nfind that, early in 1833 some apprehension prevailed in CoIambus that the county seat would be located \"on the \"western bank of the Chattahooch.ee, immediately opposite Columbus, 1 '\n\nand that this would be \"the first movement towards the. es\n\ntablishment of a rival town.\" The market house having been burned down (the exact\n\ndate not appearing-,) the Clerk of Council advertised on the\n\nOth of April for proposals to build a new one,\"\"precisely as\n\nthe old one was, with the exception of a ceiling above, which\n\n]s to be added.\" NOTTS.--The- files for the months of September and October, as well\n\nas occasional numbers in other months of this year, being missing, some incidents worthy o,f note in the history of the town are no doubt lost to us.\n\n42\n\nI'E'K.SOXAL,.\n\nThe steamboat Georgia, on her wav to Columbus, was snag ged and sunk in December, with her whole -cargo.

The farewell Address was read by Ii. T. Marks, and the address delivered by Samuel W. Floiimoy. John II. .Love was Marshal of the day.\n\nI'KHSOXAIj.\n\nSamuel K. Andrews was for a long time one of the most nsefi.il and trusted citizens of Colurnbns. jS\"o man stood h.igl).er for unyielding integrity and an old-time candor and sincerity tliat commended him to the entire confidence of his fellowcitizens. Besides holding the office of Town Tren.surer, he \"was for years an. Alderman and a Justice of the Inferior Court, which position he graced by his impartiality and good sense, ilc was a builder by occupation, and many edifices whose erection he superintended dot the city. He died in. 1862, at a good old age.\n\nDr. Stephen M. Ingersoll was a man of original views and much business enterprise. He removed quite early IjO Russell county, nearly opposite Columbus, and for some time gave the city trouble by his litigation for Alabama rights which' he claimed for the west bank of the river. He was much liked by the Indians, and, while he was prompt to inform the whites of any hostile demonstrations or intentions by the red men, he always opposed any harsh treatment of the latter. He ac quired considerable property in Russell - county, and had generally on foot some business enterprise in which the public were interested. He died two or three years ap;o, at an ago not far short of four-score.\n\nSeaborn Jones removed from Milleclgeville to Oolumbus. lie was one of the shrewdest and most successful lawyers in\n\nPEKSONATj.\n\n43\n\nGeorgia, well versed in the pleadings, and managing his cases with au adroitness that often surprised opposing counsel. ITe was elected to Congress, this year, in a contest that greatly divided the vote of Muscogee county--both M. B. Lamar and John Milton opposing him, and Lamar especially taking off many votes that Jones would have received had lie not been .in the field. I~Ie made an able member of Congress, and was again elected in 1844, by a close vote, after a spirited contest with the able Whig candidate, Win. IT. Crawforcl of Suiatcr. He died March IS, 1861, in the ----- year1 of his age.\n\nJohn Godwin, builder of the first bridge across the Chattahooohce, was a native of North Carolina, but removed from Oheruw, S. G., to Columbus after making the contract to build the bridge. lie did not reside immediately in the city foj? any length of time, but went over into Alabama, and lived in the immediate vicinity of Fort Ingersoll, a little military, post 011 the hill upon which the Baptist Church in Girartl now stands. A number of business men of Columbus lived there at that time, transacting their business in. town, during the day, and sleeping across the fiver at night.\n\nMr. Godwin was a man of much mechanical skill, and be came quite famous as a bridge builder. He was a most use ful man. in a territory such as this section, of Georgia and Alabama was at the time when he removed to it, and though he is now dead, some of his works of public improvement \"live after him.\" lie acquired a quantity of valuable land in Russell county, and made some improvements far in ad vance of those common in the country at that time. He never filled or sought public office. He died in February, 1859, at the age of 61 years.\n\nUlvsRCS Lewis was a, man of characteristics peculiarly fitted to impress and mould frontier society, and no doubt contrib uted much to the giving of tone to the civilization of both Columbus an.cl .Russell County, Ala., to which county he re moved, with the first wave of white settlement. He was sternly upright and just, with a courage for any emergency,\n\n44\n\nand a fund of hard common sense that made him the very man for leadership in such a country. After his removal to Alabama, he was for a number of yeans Judge of tin.; County (now Probate) Court of .Russell, and made one of the; best and most satisfactory county officers in the State. lie died in August, 1856.\n\nSol Smith, with his theatrical troupe, again entertained the citizens, in his own theatre, which, with the lot on which it stood (No. 147) and several other lots, were offered for sale by him in April. Palmer's Theatre and Yeaman's Circus also paid the town a visit.\n\nGov. Forsyth visited Columbus in May, and was tendered a public dinner, but declined.\n\nOn the 4th of July, the Declaration was read by Dr. E. L. DeGraftenreid, and the oration delivered by H. W. Flournoy-\n\nOn the 5th of July, llillery Triplett, (whoso name \"was as sociated with several personal quarrels during the iirst year or two of the town,) was killed by ---- Cogbill, at the public house of George W. Elliott, in the vicinity of the locality on which the town of Crockettsville (afterwards Craw ford) wax built.\n\nCol. Hardeman Owens, previously of Columbus, was killed at Ms residence in the Creek territory, on the 31st of July, by a party of United States soldiers.\n\nThe following are the names of steamboats given, in the list of arrivals during the year : Chattahoooh.ee, Columbus, Ver sailles, Georgian, Baltimore, Andrew Jackson, Van Buren.

We find by an adver tisement in tlie Kriqnlra- that tin's company proposed to sell, on the 2d of June of this year, 500 building lots in the town of Girard, including the lot on which stood the; western abut ment of the bridge across the Chattahoocheo, also a valuable saw and grist mill and lots containing valuable water privi leges. We cannot find any report, of this sale in. the files for June or any other month of the year. But we learn that ex tensive building in Girard was going on in 18,'j-i and 1835.\n\ntu January of this year the Legislature of Alabama passed an act authorizing Daniel McDongald, .Robert Collins, James G. Watson and Burton llepburn, (constituting flic company above named, to \"make and erect all things necessary to the permanent erection of the western abutment of said bridge, (the bridge built by the town of Columbus,) on their own lands opposite the said town,\" and to receive one half of the tolls accruing from, said bridge, upon their payment to the Commissioners of one-half the .sura expended in building it. The act also declared that the, then existing location of the western abutment of the bridge should be permanent, and prohibited any person or corporation to land a bridge on the Alabama shore or to use a ferry within a space of two miles above or below. The act stipulated that the authorities of the county of Russell and those of the town of Columbus should fix the price to be paid by the company for one-half interest in the bridge, and in the event of their refusal or neglect to do so, then the Commissioners of Roads and Reve nue of Russell county should alone determine the value.\n\nThis proposition of a divided interest in the bridge wasnol accepted by the town of Columbus, and we have no record o1 the action of the Commissioners' Court of Russell county ii reference to it. But disputes as to the right of Columbus ti both ends of the bridge, and of the right of the State of Geor gia to both banks of the river, continued for a number c years, and led to vexatious conflicts of local jurisdiction an personal churns. The controversy assumed the form of lit:\n\nBROKliN BANK, F.Tf.\n\n47\n\ngation ; the courts of Georgia decided in. fhvor of the rights of their State and Columbus, and the courts of Alabama de\n\ncided iu favor of that State and i(,s citizens. Finally the Su preme Court of the United Stales decided, on appeal, that the State of Georgia had jurisdiction to the, extent, of ki<jh vMlcr\n\nmark on both sides of the river. On the 8th of March the Enquirer ,said :\n\nWe now have six boats plying between this place and Apatachif.ola. They were ;i.ll built in Ohio and brought round by w;iy ot New Or leans. The first al tempt to construct a, .'boat iii our section lias been made within a few months. We understand a substantial light draft boat lias recently been launched at Fort (<ains by our enter prising fellow citizen, Captain (luyard. S!ic is called the \".Native Georgian,\" having beeji built ot Georgia timber by Georgia mechanic;-;. We hope thi.s laudable undertaking of Captain (J. will be liberally re warded by a full share of public patronage.\n\nA meet-ing was hold at the house of Dr. E. L. do Graffenried, on the 17t.li of August, to ascertain the prospects (In- the establishment of an Episcopal Church. A,society was formed styled the \"Columbus Episcopal Association,\" and the pros\n\npects were found to be most encouraging. The communica tion reporting the proceedings of this meeting said :\n\nThere are at this time three churches in this place in nourishing con dition, and it WHS remarked by one gentleman present that there were no re persons, present at the first meeting of this society than the other liree churches had at their commencement collectively. This shows iliat a little exertion on the part of those in favor of this movement is only wanted to insure complete success.\n\nA bill to incorporate this Church was introduced in the '.legislature in November.\n\nTwo events of this year gave evidence, which would be deemed quite conclusive in our times, that the \"trading town\" was assuming both the airs and the dimensions of a city. These wore the possession of a broken Bank and the opening )f a race course. The suspension of the Bank of Chattahoo-\n\nclice, in April, created the flutter usually attending such dis astrous events. In a few days thereafter an \"arrangement\" was made by which the Bank passed into the hands of a new\n\nDirectorship, composed of Gen. Alien Lawhon, Thomas L.\n\n48\n\nINCIDENTS.\n\n/\n\nJackson, Col. John Milton and Robert: W\". Games, of whom Gen. Lawhon was President, and 11. W. Carries Cashier. A\n\nsails factory exposition of the affaire of the Rank wan promised soon, but it remained \"suspended.\" The Kmjuirer attributed\n\nthe suspension of this Bank to a change which had been made\n\nin its management. Business opened in a very lively manner this winter, as is\n\napparent from the following editorial of December 27th :\n\nOur town the present week lias presented quite a business like ap pearance. Bales of cotton have rolled down one street, whilst up another sacks of salt and coffee, hogsheads of sugar, barrels of .strong drink and all manner ol! merchandise have moved to their places of deposit, on every imaginable vehicle, from the strongest road wagon to the humble wheelbarrow. On Christinas eve, we went to the wharf to see the cause of so much ado, and there we found seven beauti ful steamboats discharging and receiving their cargoes. Three of these boats are entirely new and on their first visit to Columbus--viz: The Eloisa, the EH en and the Southron. All are splendid crafts-- strong, beautiful and well adapted to the navigation of our river. Close beside these, \"all in a row,\" lay our old acquaintances, the Columbus, Chattahoochee, Versailles and Georgian. All of these have done and are still doing good service. We hail these boats, old and new, as evidences of our prosperity, and shall be glad to see them and many more plying our river.\"\n\nINCIDENTS,\n\nThe new steamer Columbus, Jr., struck a snag on the 23d\n\nof February, and sunk. No lives lost,\n\nThis appears to have been the first summer that Columbus\n\nenjoyed the luxury of ice. A \" Columbus lea Company\" had\n\nbeen formed, and in March received seventy tons, which was stored in its ice-house. Our present venerable and respectec\n\ncitizen, James Kivlin, was the agent of the company for the sale of it.\n\nThe Siamese Twins exhibited in Columbus in March. The Enquirer commenced this year with bright, new type\n\nmaking a handsome appearance, under the management o:\n\nM. B. Lamar and W. B. Tinslcy. On the 29th of Match E\n\nT. Marks took the place of Mr. Lamar; and on the 12th o:\n\nApril Win. B. Tinsley transferred his interest to W. L. Jelei\n\n49\n\nand S. \"W. Flournoy. It was then for some time published by Marks, Flournoy & Joter.\n\nA three days' cock fight commenced on the 1st of July.\n\nB. A. G. Lucas, a former citizen of Columbus, was shot in his house, in the Creek nation, by an Indian, and killed, on the 2!)th of May; and on the same day Gen. Edward Feather ston, a citizen of Columbus, was waylaid by an Indian, whose gun snapped, and thus the (Jreneral escaped. Thus the two races drifted towards the war that soon followed.\n\nKey. John Baker, pastor of the Presbyterian Church, died in Virginia on the 15th of June.\n\nIn the -ith of July celebration this year, a procession was formed in front of Bedell & Walker's City Hall, under direc tion of the following officer?: Presilient, E. S. Shorter; Vice Presidents J. S. Calhoun, Dr. lloxey and Kbenezer Torrence; Marshals of the day, Asa Bates and J. C. Holland ; marched to the Methodist church where prayer was offered up by Key. S. K. Hodges, after which the Declaration was read by E. S. Shorter, Ksq., and an oration delivered by Judge AV\". T. Golqnitt. After the oration the company, amounting to three or four hundred, repaired to Messrs. Shorter & Tarver's warehouse where a large barbecue had been prepared by Be dell & Walker.\n\nThe \" Columbus Merchant Mills\" were completed tin's year, [three miles above Columbus, and were run by James Shivers j & Co.\n\nIn November the Kill/Hirer office, was set on fire by an inIcendiury, and narrowly escaped destruction.\n\nThe steamboat, Van Buren, loaded with cotton, was de[stroyed by lire, in December, while on her way from ColumIbus to Apalachieola. The passengers had to swim ashore, [but were all saved. The loss was estimated at -15,000.\n\nIn December the bill establishing the Mayor's Court of IColumbus was repealed.\n\nOi)\n\nMARRlAGKrf AND OKATHri,\n\nPERSONAL.\n\nThe following were officers of a \"Sl.atc Eights Auxilliary\n\nAssociation\" organised this year: President--Alien Law lion. \"Vicc-Prosidont.s--G.

We have a file of the Macon Messenrjr.r for the year 1835, from which we ob tain some news of Columbus, and we presume that it would have made some mention of anything important occurring here during that year.\n\nAt the January election, the following municipal officers were elected: Intendant, James C. Watson; Commissioners-- S. E. Bonncr, A. S. Clifton, Asa Bates, J. P. H. Campbell, George W. Dillard, Lewis C. Alien.\n\nDaring this year the troubles with the Indians increased, afid the outrages committed by them kept the whites con stantly in a state of excitement and alarm. The Indians had, |,by a treaty with the Federal Government in 1832, bound I themselves to remove from the Alabama territory, opposite\n\n52\n\nINDIAN TROUBLES.\n\nColumbus, to their new homes west of the Mississippi, within 'jive years. But there was a large party (possibly a majoi4ty) opposed'to the treaty at the time, and as the period allowe^l\n\nby it for their remaining in Alabama drew nearits close, they became sullen and refractory, and committed many outrage:) both upon the whites and upon those of their own race who\n\nfavored the treaty and its execution.\n\nAmong the outrages reported in the Enquirer for the few\n\nweeks of this year above mentioned, are the following: Rev.\n\nMr. Davis of the Fresbyteriau Church of Columbus, was riding along the road, a few miles from town, when he was\n\nambuscaded and shot in. the right shoulder by a party of In dians. But he escaped death at their hands. /'But a few weeks ago (said the jE^TMrer ^ January 10) an innocent child, son of a respectable farmer of Kussell county, was shot\n\nand inhumanly butchered by one of these merciless savages. Several others have beeu shot at and narrowly escaped with their lives. It is high time these bloody-thirsty beings should be hunted up and made to suiter for their crimes.\"\n\nThese and other outrages naturally aroused the citizens to the necessitv of organization for the protection of themselves\n\nand their neighbors. We find in the Macon. #ea*Mtf/Kr the proceedings of a meeting of the citizens of Columbus, held\n\non the 25th of April, 1885, which we copy below :\n\nIn consequence of the present hostile attitude of the Creek Indians of Alabama, their numerous aggressions upon the property of citizens of Georgia, and their inhuman massacre of several unoffending indi viduals, a numerous meeting of the citizens of Columbus, Georgia, co"
