M , 8th MO S.M. Cay, son of Willis & Nancy There appears to be 2 markers for James; one on his grave and one on Susans. He was born in TN and moved to IN before the age of 2. This monument seems to be on Susans grave. She was born in Lawrence Co. IN 1823 and died in 1908 at Day, MO. James and Susan waere married 21 May 1835. I have now been told that this was the 1st marker for James, then a 2nd one put up to give his Army rank; so the 1st one was moved to Susans grave.\n\nJOHN - 1820 - Brother of James & son of Willis and Nancy. One solid large flat rock covers the entire grave with headstone.\n\nN.K. - died 1850s - Nancy, wife of Willis who died in 1861. His is a lone grave on the Earl Seaton farm on Hwy. 160 on the Taney-Stone County line. He had been dead several days so was buried where they found him. Nancys grave is at the foot of John.\n\nANNA & SON (above) - Auna (Houston) Keithley, dau. of David Houston and wife of John Henry born 1868. He was buried at Union Ridge Cemetery southwest of Clever. He is a descendant of Lewis Cass and John Keithley. J.W. - Sept. 1867 - 25 April 1868\n\nThe graves in this cemetery are in rows so husband and wife are not always together.\n\nGoldie Keithley Brown Davis, who died 4 Nov. 1970, is buried beside her first husband, Pete Brown. She was the daughter of J.C. and Rebecca (May) Keithley and was a retired Hollister School teacher.\n\n[9]\n\nThis volume: Next Article | Table of Contents | Other Issues\n\nOther Volumes | Keyword Search | White River Valley Quarterly Home | Local History Home\n\nCopyright © White River Valley Historical Quarterly"
