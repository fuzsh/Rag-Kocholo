The veteran is\n\nWallace A. Swanson Sr., commanding ofﬁcer of A Company,\n\n502nd PIR, 101st Airborne\n\nDivision, during the European\n\ncampaign of 1944 and 1945. He died 10 days after the photo\n\nwas taken. I thought you might like to know who he was:\n\n– Joe Chesnut, via e-mail\n\nan American hero.\n\nTired of games\n\nWell done, Commander Cadmus! I was thrilled to read the\n\nopen letter to Sens. Bill Frist and\n\nTom Daschle (December). We are\n\ntired of the political games and\n\nlies from Washington. Flag\n\nburning has never been and never\n\nwill be about free speech. It is a\n\nhate crime, plain and simple.\n\n– Tim Grams, Fairﬁeld, Pa.\n\nKeep hope alive\n\nYour letter to Sens. Frist and\n\nDaschle is perfect. I had lost heart\n\nthat the ﬂag-desecration amendment would ever get passed. Raise\n\nhell and raise the ﬂag.\n\nber), the ﬁnest I’ve seen on the\n\nneed for a federal constitutional\n\namendment deﬁning marriage as\n\nthe union of one man and one\n\nwoman. It also clearly outlines\n\nAmerican Legion Resolution\n\nNo. 401, which deﬁnes the reasons\n\nfor passage of such an amendment. Surely, thinking Americans\n\ndo not want to see our nation on\n\nthe “slippery slope” experienced\n\nby Scandinavia and Holland, with\n\ntheir accompanying social problems. Thanks for bringing this\n\nnational issue to the forefront.\n\n– Lew Fiero, Red Wing, Minn.\n\nCivil, religious line\n\nI share the national commander’s frustration with lack of action\n\non the ﬂag amendment despite\n\nSenate leadership’s bipartisan\n\nassurances. But politicians lie; it’s\n\nthe nature of the beast. Essentially, in a hotly contested election\n\nyear, stalwarts of either party will\n\npromise or trade anything to\n\nanyone to get their posse reelected. As the saying goes,\n\n“There ain’t a nickel’s worth of\n\ndifference between the Republicans and the Democrats.” We\n\nexpect our political enemies to\n\n“misspeak,” but when dealing\n\nwith politicians, we need to also\n\nbeware of our “friends.”\n\nThe civil ceremony is a legal\n\ncontractual arrangement, and\n\nsuch contracts can be made\n\nbetween two persons planning\n\nto live as a couple, between two\n\nor more partners in a business,\n\nbetween a boss and his employee\n\nor between two businesses. The\n\nreligious ceremony is before God\n\nand follows millennia of tradition.\n\nWhy do folks like Stanley Kurtz\n\ncontinue to confuse the two? If a\n\nchurch doesn’t want to recognize\n\na union, for whatever reason – a\n\nsingle-sex couple, a divorced\n\npartner, refusal of one of the\n\npersons to accept the faith,\n\nwhatever – that is its right. By the\n\nsame token, if two parties want to\n\nsign a contractual agreement it is\n\nnone of the church’s business.\n\n– Don Kaag, Moscow, Idaho\n\n– Merton L. Bland, Arlington, Va.\n\n– Dennis Paterka, Chicago\n\nNature of the beast\n\nProtect marriage\n\nNo such thing\n\nThank you for the much-needed\n\narticle on marriage by Stanley\n\nKurtz (“Man & Husband,” Decem-\n\nCongress cannot legislate on an\n\nissue that doesn’t exist.

In no way can these\n\nadoring couples procreate,\n\nwhich is the reason for marriage\n\nin the ﬁ rst place.\n\n– William Burns, Aurora, Colo.\n\nCrucial support\n\nWith so many boys being raised\n\nwithout a father in the home, a\n\ngroup like the Scouts is even more\n\nnecessary (“On My Honor, I Must\n\nFight,” December). Boys beneﬁt\n\nfrom good male role models, and\n\nthe Boy Scouts nicely ﬁ ll that\n\nneed. They learn not only important practical skills, but also how\n\nto work together and the discipline necessary to reach long-term\n\ngoals. I personally think many\n\ncritics of the Scouts are jealous of\n\nthe organization’s success. Please\n\ncontinue your support.

Get back to the basics: a\n\nhandbook, a program and loads of\n\ncamping. This is what most boys\n\nwant to begin with. The extra\n\nfrills are unimportant. The\n\nvolunteer is the backbone of\n\nScouting, and we all know they\n\nget no money for that. So what’s\n\nthe problem?\n\n– Jerry Barthelemy, Algood, Tenn.\n\nSad state of affairs\n\nIt is so sad that organizations\n\nsuch as the ACLU and even United\n\nWay condemn what the Boy\n\nScouts have been doing for\n\ndecades: developing boys into lawabiding citizens and future leaders\n\nof our country.

ZOCOR can interact with\n\nthe following:\n\nPLEASE READ THIS SUMMARY CAREFULLY, THEN ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT ZOCOR.\n\nNO ADVERTISEMENT CAN PROVIDE ALL THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO PRESCRIBE A\n\nDRUG. THIS ADVERTISEMENT DOES NOT TAKE THE PLACE OF CAREFUL DISCUSSIONS\n\nWITH YOUR DOCTOR. ONLY YOUR DOCTOR HAS THE TRAINING TO WEIGH THE RISKS\n\nAND BENEFITS OF A PRESCRIPTION DRUG FOR YOU.\n\nUSES OF ZOCOR\n\nZOCOR is a prescription drug that is indicated as an addition to diet for many patients with high cholesterol.\n\nFor patients at high risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) because of existing heart disease, diabetes, vascular\n\ndisease, or history of stroke, ZOCOR is indicated along with diet to reduce the risk of death by reducing coronary death; reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke; and reduce the need for revascularization procedures.\n\nWHEN ZOCOR SHOULD NOT BE USED\n\nSome people should not take ZOCOR. Discuss this with your doctor.\n\nZOCOR should not be used by patients who are allergic to any of its ingredients. In addition to the active ingredient simvastatin, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: cellulose, lactose, magnesium\n\nstearate, iron oxides, talc, titanium dioxide, and starch. Butylated hydroxyanisole is added as a preservative.\n\nPatients with liver problems: ZOCOR should not be used by patients with active liver disease or repeated\n\nblood test results indicating possible liver problems. (See WARNINGS.)\n\nWomen who are or may become pregnant: Pregnant women should not take ZOCOR because it may\n\nharm the fetus. Women of childbearing age should not take ZOCOR unless it is highly unlikely\n\nthat they will become pregnant. If a woman does become pregnant while on ZOCOR, she should stop\n\ntaking the drug and talk to her doctor at once.\n\nWomen who are breast-feeding should not take ZOCOR.\n\nWARNINGS\n\nMuscle: Tell your doctor right away if you experience any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness at any time during treatment with ZOCOR so your doctor can decide if\n\nZOCOR should be stopped. Some patients may have muscle pain or weakness while taking\n\nZOCOR. Rarely, this can include muscle breakdown resulting in kidney damage. The risk of\n\nmuscle breakdown is greater in patients taking certain other drugs along with ZOCOR:\n\n• Cyclosporine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin,\n\nHIV protease inhibitors, the antidepressant nefazodone, or large quantities of grapefruit\n\njuice (>1 quart daily), particularly with higher doses of ZOCOR.\n\n• Gemfibrozil particularly with higher doses of ZOCOR.\n\n• Other lipid lowering drugs (other fibrates or >–1 g/day of niacin) that can cause myopathy\n\nwhen given alone.\n\n• Danazol particularly with higher doses of ZOCOR.\n\n• Amiodarone or verapamil with higher doses of ZOCOR.\n\nThe risk of muscle breakdown is greater at higher doses of simvastatin.\n\nBecause the risk of muscle side effects is greater when ZOCOR is used with the products\n\nlisted above, the combined use of these products should be avoided unless your doctor\n\ndetermines the benefits are likely to outweigh the increased risks.\n\nThe dose of ZOCOR should not exceed 10 mg daily in patients receiving gemfibrozil. The\n\ncombined use of ZOCOR and gemfibrozil should be avoided, unless your doctor determines\n\nthat the benefits outweigh the increased risks of muscle problems. Caution should be used\n\nwhen using ZOCOR with other fibrates or niacin because these can cause muscle problems\n\nwhen taken alone.\n\nNo more than 10 mg/day of ZOCOR should be taken with cyclosporine or danazol.\n\nThe combined use of verapamil or amiodarone with doses above ZOCOR 20 mg should be\n\navoided unless your doctor determines the benefits outweigh the increased risk of muscle\n\nbreakdown.\n\nYour doctor should also carefully monitor for any muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness,\n\nparticularly during the initial months of therapy and if the dose of either drug is increased.\n\nYour doctor also may monitor the level of certain muscle enzymes in your body, but there is\n\nno assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe muscle disease.\n\nThe risk of muscle breakdown is greater in patients with kidney problems or diabetes.\n\nIf you have conditions that can increase your risk of muscle breakdown, which in turn can\n\ncause kidney damage, your doctor should temporarily withhold or stop ZOCOR. Also, since\n\nthere are no known adverse consequences of briefly stopping therapy with ZOCOR, treatment\n\nshould be stopped a few days before elective major surgery and when any major acute\n\nmedical or surgical condition occurs. Discuss this with your doctor, who can explain these\n\nconditions to you.\n\nLiver: About 1% of patients who took ZOCOR in clinical trials developed elevated levels of\n\nsome liver enzymes. Patients who had these increases usually had no symptoms. Elevated liver enzymes\n\nusually returned to normal levels when therapy with ZOCOR was stopped.\n\nIn the ZOCOR Survival Study, the number of patients with more than 1 liver enzyme level elevation to greater\n\nthan 3 times the normal upper limit was no different between the ZOCOR and placebo groups. Only 8 patients\n\non ZOCOR and 5 on placebo discontinued therapy due to elevated liver enzyme levels. Patients were started\n\non 20 mg of ZOCOR, and one third had their dose raised to 40 mg.\n\nYour doctor should perform routine blood tests to check these enzymes before you start treatment with ZOCOR and thereafter when clinically indicated. Patients titrated to the 80-mg dose\n\nshould receive an additional test at 3 months and periodically thereafter (eg, semiannually)\n\nfor the first year of treatment. If your enzyme levels increase, your doctor should order more frequent\n\ntests. If your liver enzyme levels remain unusually high, your doctor should discontinue your medication.\n\nTell your doctor about any liver disease you may have had in the past and about how much alcohol you\n\nconsume. ZOCOR should be used with caution in patients who consume large amounts of alcohol.\n\nPRECAUTIONS\n\nDrug Interactions: Because of possible serious drug interactions, it is important to tell your doctor what\n\nother drugs you are taking, including those obtained without a prescription. You should also tell other doctors\n\n• Itraconazole\n\n• Ketoconazole\n\n• Erythromycin\n\n• Clarithromycin\n\n• Telithromycin\n\n• HIV protease inhibitors\n\n• Nefazodone\n\n• Cyclosporine\n\n• Large quantities of grapefruit juice (>1 quart daily)\n\nThe risk of myopathy is also increased by gemfibrozil and to a lesser extent other fibrates and niacin (nicotinic\n\nacid) (≥1 g/day).\n\nThe risk of muscle breakdown is increased with other drugs:\n\n• Danazol\n\n• Amiodarone\n\n• Verapamil\n\nSome patients taking lipid-lowering agents similar to ZOCOR and coumarin anticoagulants (a type of blood\n\nthinner) have experienced bleeding and/or increased blood clotting time. Patients taking these medicines\n\nshould have their blood tested before starting therapy with ZOCOR and should continue to be monitored.\n\nCentral Nervous System Toxicity; Cancer, Mutations, Impairment of Fertility: Like most prescription drugs, ZOCOR was required to be tested on animals before it was marketed for human use. Often these\n\ntests were designed to achieve higher drug concentrations than humans achieve at recommended dosing. In\n\nsome tests, the animals had damage to the nerves in the central nervous system. In studies of mice with high\n\ndoses of ZOCOR, the likelihood of certain types of cancerous tumors increased. No evidence of mutations of\n\nor damage to genetic material has been seen. In 1 study with ZOCOR, there was decreased fertility in male rats.\n\nPregnancy: Pregnant women should not take ZOCOR because it may harm the fetus.\n\nSafety in pregnancy has not been established. In studies with lipid-lowering agents similar to ZOCOR, there\n\nhave been rare reports of birth defects of the skeleton and digestive system. Therefore, women of childbearing\n\nage should not take ZOCOR unless it is highly unlikely they will become pregnant. If a woman does become\n\npregnant while taking ZOCOR, she should stop taking the drug and talk to her doctor at once. The active\n\ningredient of ZOCOR did not cause birth defects in rats at 3 times the human dose or in rabbits at 3 times the\n\nhuman dose.\n\nNursing Mothers: Drugs taken by nursing mothers may be present in their breast milk. Because of the\n\npotential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a woman taking ZOCOR should not breast-feed. (See\n\nWHEN ZOCOR SHOULD NOT BE USED.)\n\nPediatric Use: ZOCOR is not recommended for children or patients under 10 years of age.\n\nGeriatric Use: Higher blood levels of active drug were seen in elderly patients (70–78 years of age) compared with younger patients (18–30 years of age) in 1 study. In other studies, the cholesterol-lowering effects\n\nof ZOCOR were at least as great in elderly patients as in younger patients, and there were no overall differences in safety between elderly and younger patients over the 20–80 mg/day dosage range. Of the 7 cases\n\nof myopathy/rhabdomyolysis among 10,269 patients on ZOCOR in another study, 4 were aged 65 or more\n\n(at baseline), 1 of whom was over 75.\n\nSIDE EFFECTS\n\nMost patients tolerate treatment with ZOCOR well; however, like all prescription drugs, ZOCOR can cause side\n\neffects, and some of them can be serious. Side effects that do occur are usually mild and short-lived. Only\n\nyour doctor can weigh the risks versus the benefits of any prescription drug. In clinical studies with ZOCOR,\n\nless than 1.5% of patients dropped out of the studies because of side effects. In 2 large, 5-year studies,\n\npatients taking ZOCOR experienced similar side effects to those patients taking placebo (sugar pills). Some of\n\nthe side effects that have been reported with ZOCOR or related drugs are listed below. This list is not complete.\n\nBe sure to ask your doctor about side effects before taking ZOCOR and to discuss any side effects that occur.\n\nDigestive System: Constipation, diarrhea, upset stomach, gas, heartburn, stomach pain/cramps, anorexia,\n\nloss of appetite, nausea, inflammation of the pancreas, hepatitis, jaundice, fatty changes in the liver, and,\n\nrarely, severe liver damage and failure, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.\n\nMuscle, Skeletal: Muscle cramps, aches, pain, and weakness; joint pain; muscle breakdown.\n\nNervous System: Dizziness, headache, insomnia, tingling, memory loss, damage to nerves causing weakness and/or loss of sensation and/or abnormal sensations, anxiety, depression, tremor, loss of balance,\n\npsychic disturbances.\n\nSkin: Rash, itching, hair loss, dryness, nodules, discoloration.\n\nEye/Senses: Blurred vision, altered taste sensation, progression of cataracts, eye muscle weakness.\n\nHypersensitivity (Allergic) Reactions: On rare occasions, a wide variety of symptoms have been\n\nreported to occur either alone or together in groups (referred to as a syndrome) that appeared to be based on\n\nallergic-type reactions, which may rarely be fatal. These have included 1 or more of the following: a severe\n\ngeneralized reaction that may include shortness of breath, wheezing, digestive symptoms, and low blood pressure and even shock; an allergic reaction with swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and/or throat with difficulty\n\nswallowing or breathing; symptoms mimicking lupus (a disorder in which a person’s immune system may\n\nattack parts of his or her own body); severe muscle and blood vessel inflammation, sometimes including rash;\n\nbruises; various disorders of blood cells (that could result in anemia, infection, or blood clotting problems)\n\nor abnormal blood tests; inflamed or painful joints; hives; fatigue and weakness; sensitivity to sunlight; fever,\n\nchills; flushing; difficulty breathing; and severe skin disorders that vary from rash to a serious burn-like\n\nshedding of skin all over the body, including mucous membranes such as the lining of the mouth.\n\nOther: Loss of sexual desire, breast enlargement, impotence.\n\nLaboratory Tests: Liver function test abnormalities including elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin;\n\nthyroid function abnormalities.\n\nNOTE: This summary provides important information about ZOCOR.

The individuals on both sides made superﬁcial, textbook arguments for\n\nkeeping or abolishing the Electoral College system while completely ignoring some of the more\n\ncontentious and outmoded\n\nreasons for its creation in the ﬁ rst\n\nplace. The real purpose of the\n\nElectoral College was to protect\n\nsmaller southern states from the\n\npolitical domination of northern\n\nnon-slave states, and to ensure\n\nsouthern ratiﬁcation of the\n\nproposed constitution. The\n\ninstitution of slavery and other\n\ngeopolitical issues that led to the\n\nadoption of the Electoral College are no longer relevant today.\n\nThe Electoral College is a relic of\n\nbygone days and should be\n\ndiscarded in favor of direct\n\nelection of the president.\n\n– Lawrence Calabro, Tucson, Ariz.\n\nRed vs. blue\n\nAbolishment of the Electoral\n\nCollege would reduce the importance of individual states in our\n\nfederal system of government. We\n\nmust remember that 50 states\n\ncomprise this great nation. Even\n\nwith the Electoral College system\n\nin place, it took a lot of “red”\n\nstates to outweigh “blue” states in\n\nthe 2004 election. Red states, by\n\nand large, have a different lifestyle and value system than blue\n\nstates. Even though our states are\n\nless populated, our lifestyles\n\nshouldn’t be overridden by a\n\nnational popular vote. If popular\n\nvote could elect a president,\n\ncandidates would only court the\n\nhigh-population centers of our\n\nnation. A president so chosen\n\nwould be illegitimate.\n\n– Ed Taylor, Brevard, N.C.\n\nTaxpayer voters\n\nI couldn’t agree more that the\n\ncurrent system of electing our\n\npresident and vice president\n\nneeds an update. I do not agree,\n\nhowever, with any form of direct\n\nelection. I do believe in what is\n\nbound to be a most controversial\n\nidea: allow those who pay for\n\ngovernment to vote in national\n\nelections. Those who are current\n\ntaxpayers and those with a\n\nreasonably long history of\n\nbeing taxpayers should be the\n\nones deciding who will spend\n\ntax money and on what it will\n\nbe spent.\n\nCode of ethics\n\nI salute Gen. Robert H. “Doc”\n\nFoglesong and The American\n\nLegion Magazine for believing\n\nsuccessful leadership ﬂows from\n\ngood ethics and moral clarity\n\n(“The High Road,” December). I\n\nparticipated in enhancing the\n\nInstitute of Management Accountants code of ethics, which\n\nincludes four basic ethical\n\nstandards: integrity, objectivity,\n\nconﬁdentiality and competence.\n\nAlthough a few have violated\n\nthem, the vast majority of accountants abide by the code of\n\nethics. I challenge all organizations to adopt a code of ethics to\n\nencourage members to take the\n\n“high road.”\n\n– Grover L. Porter, Hendersonville, Tenn.\n\nReal conspiracies\n\nIt’s amazing how the last\n\nelection has made abolishment of\n\nthe Electoral College such a hot\n\nissue. I can visualize all those\n\nDemocrats looking at that map\n\nwith the huge red area and their\n\nseemingly paltry blue states on\n\nthe west and northeast coasts,\n\nplus the rust belt. Let’s see: take\n\nNew York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Oregon, Washington, and throw in Michigan,\n\nIllinois and Wisconsin ... that\n\nmight swing the popular vote.\n\nMaybe a couple of others. You\n\nwon’t ever see another bridge\n\nbuilt with federal money in\n\nWyoming or Alabama. How many\n\nstates do we think the candidates\n\nwill visit? Will congressmen from\n\nless-populated states even be\n\ninvited to key meetings or appointed to important committees?\n\nBad idea.

Sending your\n\nson or daughter to war. That’s why it is essential that\n\nwe remain proud of our military service and emphasize the positive aspects of serving in the Army, Navy, Air\n\nForce, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. Each of these services,\n\nalong with their Reserve and Guard components, offer cultural\n\nand life-changing experiences that can’t be duplicated anywhere else. Yet everyday that experience is denigrated by war\n\ncritics and anti-military elitists.\n\nThe latest example of this is a ludicrous decision by two\n\nfederal judges allowing college campuses to ban military\n\nrecruiters even while receiving funds from U.S. taxpayers.\n\nFree speech apparently does not apply to Army recruiters\n\nvisiting Harvard.\n\nDespite the obstacles, all services except for the stretchedway-too-thin National Guard met their recruiting goals during\n\nthe past ﬁscal year. We can do more to assist the services in\n\ntheir recruiting efforts.\n\n“We’re in an economy that’s growing, and it’s a higher quality\n\nof young men and women we’re recruiting,” says Maj. Gen.\n\nMichael Rochelle, head of the Army Recruiting Command. I met\n\nMaj. Gen. Rochelle during a Reconnect visit to Fort Knox with\n\nother Legionnaires in October. “These young men and women\n\nhave options, and they’re very good at weighing those options.\n\nThis is where you can help us. You can encourage those young\n\nmen and women that this is the right option for them, or that it\n\nis not the right option. That’s where we need your help.”\n\nRochelle says Legionnaires are qualiﬁed to serve as Army\n\nrecruiters.\n\n“You have an opportunity to tell your story of service to our\n\ncountry,” he says. “You can pass that story on. In FY 2005,\n\nwe’re going to need your help. Our richest partnerships are\n\nwith veterans organizations. But we can make it better. We\n\nneed your support now.”\n\nGunnery Sgt. Brett Beard, a recruiter in Los Angeles, has\n\nbeen signing up Marines for ﬁve years. He believes the war in\n\nIraq forces young people to consider the possible consequences\n\nof military service.\n\n“The people who were joining for education beneﬁts or\n\nﬁnancial security are dropping off. The young guy looking for\n\na little help is much less likely to enlist now. Instead, they are\n\nbeing replaced by those joining for patriotism. They are\n\njoining for the challenge and because they are concerned\n\nabout the threats to America. We are still getting the people to\n\njoin, but for different reasons.”\n\nAs a father, I can’t imagine the agony family members of the\n\ndeployed endure every time they hear a report of another\n\nMarine killed in Iraq or soldier slain in Afghanistan, wondering if they will soon hear the dreaded knock on the door.\n\nWe have an all-volunteer force. I will not pressure my 26year-old daughter and 24-year-old son to join the military, and\n\nI don’t think others should pressure their own children either.\n\nBut if they decide to pursue this noble path, they won’t have a\n\nstronger supporter.\n\n8\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nFebruary 2005\n\nNational Commander Thomas P.

HARRIS\n\nO\n\nn a cool October night in 1917 rumors ran through Long\n\nIsland’s Camp Mills that racists from Alabama’s 167th\n\nInfantry of the 42nd “Rainbow” Division planned an armed\n\nattack on blacks of the 15th New York Regiment. The rumors\n\nenraged the commander of the 15th’s K Company. Tall, solid as a\n\nrock and a former all-American football star at Harvard, Hamilton\n\nFish Jr. was not about to let anyone run roughshod over the state’s\n\nﬁrst all-black National Guard regiment. The 15th had seen enough resentment in the year since it was organized to make the men question whether going\n\nto war to make the world safe and free was worth it when true freedom for them\n\nat home did not exist. Only days before, they had been booted out of Camp\n\nWadsworth in Spartanburg, S.C., for fear of a race riot. Sent to Camp Mills, the\n\nNew Yorkers awaited orders to sail for France and the Western front where,\n\nironically, they would be out of harm’s way.\n\n12\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nFebruary 2005\n\nHarlem’s\n\nHell Fighters\n\nFish, scion of a powerful New\n\nYork family and a future founder\n\nof The American Legion, had\n\npersuaded the 165th Infantry – the\n\nold Fighting 69th – to supply\n\nbullets for his soldiers’ riﬂes.\n\nNow, with a loaded .45 hidden\n\nbehind his back, Fish went in\n\nsearch of the troublemakers. He\n\nmeant to defend his regiment in\n\nthe gloom of night even if he had\n\nto shoot white soldiers to do it.\n\nThinking back to that moment\n\nand all the racial incidents that the\n\n15th faced in the early days of its\n\nexistence, Fish wondered what\n\nmight have happened if its men had\n\never lost their cool. “Oh, it would\n\nhave been horrendous,” he wrote.\n\nHorrendous, indeed. For the\n\nblack regiment, every step of the\n\nway had been blocked. The\n\ncoming showdown at Camp Mills\n\nwas just another barrier, but far\n\nfrom the last. Yet in the end, the\n\n15th – later the 369th U.S. Infantry – persevered. At war’s end it\n\nhad been in combat longer than\n\nany other regiment: 191 days. It\n\nnever lost a foot of ground, nor\n\nwere any of its men ever taken\n\nprisoner. And the French government awarded the Croix de Guerre\n\nto the entire regiment it respectfully called “Hell Fighters.”\n\nThe story of these “Hell Fighters”\n\nbegins in the quarter century\n\nABOVE LEFT: Soldiers of the U.S. 369th\n\nInfantry Regiment train in the trenches\n\non May 4, 1918.

The 15th, now\n\nredesignated the 369th Infantry,\n\nwas attached to the 16th Division\n\nof the French Fourth Army.\n\nBy mid-April, the Hell Fighters\n\nwere in the Champagne sector\n\nnortheast of Chalons, protecting a\n\nswath of the west bank of the\n\nAisne River. It marked the ﬁ rst\n\ntime black Americans entered the\n\nfront line in the Great War.\n\nOn the night of May 13, Henry\n\nJohnson, the Albany redcap,\n\nhunkered down in a listening post\n\nin no-man’s-land. He shared the\n\nmudhole with Pvt. Needham\n\nRoberts of Trenton, N.J. Out of the\n\ndarkness, pitching grenades and\n\nﬁ ring riﬂes, a German platoon\n\nattacked the two soldiers. Both\n\nAmericans fell. Johnson suffered\n\nthree gunshot wounds, but he got\n\nto his feet and singlehandedly met\n\nthe rush. Using a bolo knife, he\n\nrepelled the assault, certainly\n\nkilling a half-dozen men. His fury\n\nforced the Germans to retreat. For\n\nhis heroic stand, Johnson received\n\nthe Croix de Guerre. Newspapers\n\nthroughout the United States\n\ncarried his story. Because one of\n\nAmerica’s ﬁ rst war heroes was a\n\nsoldier of color, the black community renewed its efforts to convince the president to repudiate\n\nlynching. Finally Wilson publicly\n\nstated that anyone taking part in a\n\nmob action is “no true son of\n\ndemocracy, but its betrayer.”\n\nThe 369th Infantry was just\n\ngetting warmed up. Transferred to\n\nthe 161st French Division, the New\n\nYorkers relieved a Moroccan\n\nbattalion. In mid-July, they helped\n\nrepulse a major attack, and for the\n\n16\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nFebruary 2005\n\nnext two months took part in the\n\ndrive by the Allies that forced the\n\nGerman army to retreat to the\n\nHindenburg Line. Then, starting on\n\nSept. 26, British, Belgian, French\n\nand U.S. armies began their all-out\n\nstrike against the Germans. On that\n\nday, the Hell Fighters pushed\n\nforward under heavy artillery and\n\nmachine-gun ﬁre. They stormed the\n\nheights of Bellevue Ridge, took the\n\nvillage of Ripont, crossed the\n\nDormois River – turning it red with\n\ntheir own blood – and then battled\n\nto the outskirts of Sechault, a\n\nstrongly fortiﬁed town that French\n\nGen. Petain swore could not be\n\ntaken. The attack proved costly, yet\n\nthe New Yorkers – in ﬁerce streetﬁghting – drove out the Germans\n\nand captured Sechault.\n\nFor its gallantry the entire\n\nregiment not only received the\n\nCroix de Guerre but also the\n\nhonoriﬁc, “Hell Fighters.” The\n\ncitation, in part, reads: “Though\n\nengaging in an offensive for the\n\nﬁ rst time, (the 369th Regiment)\n\nfought with great bravery, stormed\n\npowerful enemy positions energetically defended, captured many\n\nmachine guns, large numbers of\n\nprisoners and six cannon and\n\ntook, after heavy ﬁghting, the\n\nTown of Sechault.”\n\nFor his individual heroism, white\n\nLt. George Robb earned the Medal\n\nof Honor. The taking of Sechault\n\nended the 369th’s major combat\n\noperations. The regiment was then\n\nattached to the French II Corps\n\nand, following the armistice, led\n\nthe Allies to the Rhine River.\n\nOn Feb. 17, 1919, the 369th\n\nreturned home to a tumultuous\n\nparade up Fifth Avenue and\n\nthrough the streets of Harlem. On\n\nthe crowded sidewalks, taunts\n\ngave way to cheers as New\n\nYorkers embraced their newest\n\nheroes. In the years and decades\n\nthat followed, the Hell Fighters\n\nfought in World War II, Korea,\n\nVietnam and Desert Storm.

The legislation authorized an exchange of the 1-acre\n\nsite for ﬁve acres from a private\n\nowner, placing the memorial on\n\nprivate land.\n\nHowever, that did not satisfy the\n\n20\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nFebruary 2005\n\nfanatical ACLU. The Ninth Circuit\n\nCourt of Appeals held the case\n\nwas “not moot” because the land\n\nexchange, although legislatively\n\nauthorized, was not complete.\n\nFurther, the court found the lead\n\nplaintiff – the ﬁ rst and sole\n\nremaining plaintiff – had legal\n\nstanding to complain of civilrights injury.\n\nThe lead plaintiff, Fank Buono,\n\nis a retired Forest Service employee who later moved to Oregon, but\n\nclaims civil-rights violation and\n\ninjury because he sees the cross\n\nwhen driving back on visits.\n\nACLU’s attorney fee award for\n\nrepresenting him was increased to\n\n$63,000.\n\nUpon such de minimis dross as\n\nthis is constitutional law being\n\nmade by judges, and the ACLU is\n\nproﬁting ﬁnancially, at taxpayer\n\nexpense.\n\nThey’re still at it. The ACLU\n\nﬁ led a motion in District Court in\n\nDecember to declare the land\n\nexchange unconstitutional,\n\nclaiming it doesn’t comply with\n\nthe spirit of the injunction.\n\nOther examples of ACLU abuse\n\nare multiple, nationwide and\n\nglaring:\n\nn The ACLU reaped some\n\n$940,000 in settlement from the\n\nCity of San Diego when it surrendered in ACLU’s litigation to kick\n\nthe Boy Scouts out of Balboa Park.\n\nThe Boy Scouts are appealing.

The ACLU, exposing its\n\nhypocrisy as well as fanaticism,\n\ndid not demand removal of the\n\ncentral religious ﬁgure dominating the seal – “Pomona,” the ItaloRoman goddess of poma, i.e.\n\nfruits. A citizens’ initiative\n\npetition is ongoing to place the\n\nissue on the ballot and overturn\n\nthe surrender to the ACLU.\n\nn The city council of Redlands,\n\nCalif., reluctantly surrendered to\n\nthe ACLU’s demand that it change\n\nits city seal to remove a cross, for\n\nfear of court-ordered attorney fees\n\nto the ACLU.\n\nSimply put, it is clear the ACLU\n\nhas gone too far, exploiting the\n\nCivil Rights Act, 42 U.S. Code 1988,\n\nto enrich itself and carry out in\n\nterrorem litigation to compel\n\nsurrender to its demands from\n\nelected and appointed ofﬁcials who\n\nfear judge-awarded attorney fees.\n\nClaims by ACLU defenders that\n\nthe organization once did public\n\ngood in defending free speech, are\n\nvitiated by its fanaticism in selfenriching terroristic litigation and\n\nself-appointed social engineering\n\nin the present.\n\nAmerican Legion National\n\nResolution 326 calls for Congress\n\nto reform 42 U.S. Code Sec. 1988\n\nto take the proﬁt out of such\n\nterroristic litigation.

DoD agreed to partially\n\nsettle a ﬁve-year-old lawsuit brought by the ACLU\n\nto prohibit sponsorship of Boy Scout programs at\n\nU.S. military installations. The settlement, reportedly handled by subordinates of Defense Secretary\n\nDonald Rumsfeld, came two weeks after attention\n\nto values was widely attributed to President Bush’s\n\nre-election. The agreement ignited a ﬁery national\n\ndebate pitting the values of God and country\n\nagainst the constitutional interpretations of the\n\nACLU, whose civil-rights activism was cast by\n\nsome as a form of “legal terrorism.”\n\nIn 1999, the ACLU of Illinois sued the DoD, the\n\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development\n\nand the Chicago Board of Education for sponsoring Boy Scout programs because participation\n\nincludes an oath that has the words, “On my\n\nhonor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and\n\nmy country …” The Chicago Board of Education\n\nsoon ceased sponsorship of Scouting activities.\n\nDoD was less hasty. The U.S. military sponsors\n\nmore than 400 Scout units worldwide and supports the national Boy Scouts Jamboree in Virginia\n\nto the tune of about $2 million from the Army\n\nevery four years. The settlement did not address\n\nthe Jamboree. But the ACLU regards the DoD\n\ndecision as only “partial.”\n\nSwiftly following the announcement, talk-show\n\nTV and newspaper editorial pages brimmed with\n\npublic debate over the DoD’s concession. Bloggers\n\nsoon joined the fray. Five days after the decision,\n\nthe U.S. House of Representatives passed, 391-3, a\n\nnon-binding resolution commending the Boy\n\nScouts and condemning legal efforts to restrict\n\ngovernment ties to them.\n\nThe following is a small sample of public\n\nexpressions in the days after the decision:\n\n“The idea that sponsorship of Scouting by American military units is ‘unconstitutional’\n\ngoes beyond the absurd, even well past the point of stupidity. How is it the government can\n\nfund chapels on military bases, and chaplains in the military, but not accommodate Scouting?\n\nHow is it the Congress can sanction Scouting by issuing them a federal charter,\n\nbut the courts can declare them ‘outlaws’?\n\n“Is there no one in Washington, D.C., at the highest levels of government that will stand up\n\nfor Scouts, for Scouting and support this movement that has long been an institution\n\nof highest reputation in America? Where’s the president? Where’s his cabinet? Where’s the\n\nCongress?What are the courts doing? Where is the outrage?”\n\n– Letter from American Legion National Commander Thomas P.

Chaplains George Fox,\n\nAlexander Goode, Clark Poling and John Washington left their mark on a single\n\nnight of war, forever changing the lives of those they saved. The following is an\n\nexcerpt of their story as told by Dan Kurzman in his book “No Greater Glory.”\n\nBY DAN KURZMAN\n\nA\n\nt about 4 p.m. on Jan. 29,\n\n1943, the Dorchester\n\ncreaked northward out of\n\nthe dock at St. John’s, Newfoundland, together with ﬁve other\n\ncraft in a new, bare-bones convoy\n\ncalled SG 19. The convoy comprised two freighters, the Biscaya\n\nand the Lutz … and three U.S.\n\nCoast Guard escorts – the Tampa,\n\na 240-foot heavy cutter, and the\n\nEscanaba and Comanche,\n\n165-foot cutters that had served\n\nas Great Lakes icebreakers in the\n\nearly 1930s.\n\nThe cutters were part of the\n\nGreenland Patrol, established in\n\nJune 1941 to protect ships and\n\nbases in the North Atlantic.\n\nThe Tampa was the convoy’s\n\nsenior ship and carried not only\n\nits own commander but also the\n\nconvoy commander, Capt. Joseph\n\nGreenspun, who would issue all\n\norders pertaining to speed, course\n\nand formation. Since radios were\n\nsilent to avoid enemy interception, signal lamps would transmit\n\nall inter-ship communications.\n\nThe Biscaya sailed on the\n\nstarboard side of the Dorchester,\n\nthe Lutz on the port side; the\n\nComanche and Escanaba patrolled\n\nfarther out, about 2,000 yards\n\nfrom the Dorchester, slightly\n\nastern of it on the port and\n\nstarboard sides, respectively.\n\nThe Tampa, with speed matching\n\n26\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nFebruary 2005\n\nthe Dorchester’s, churned the\n\nwaters about 5,000 yards in front\n\nof the former luxury liner, plowing a winding, evasive course\n\nintended to thwart a U-boat\n\nattack. This formation would later\n\nbe criticized by the commander\n\nof the task force the cutters\n\nbelonged to.\n\nU-boats, in so-called “wolf\n\npacks,” infested the Strait of Belle\n\nIsle, aptly referred to as “Torpedo\n\nJunction,” between Labrador and\n\nNewfoundland Island. They had\n\nalready sunk scores of Allied\n\nships in these swirling waters.\n\nHardly had the Dorchester\n\nreached the open sea when galeforce northwest winds propelled it\n\nthrough towering waves that\n\nJohn Pearse, chief boatswain’s\n\ncoated much of the ship with ice\n\nmate on the Tampa, and many of\n\nand stirred fears, which were\n\nhis shipmates were puzzled.

At about 3:30 p.m.,\n\nthe Tampa, which, as the escort\n\ncommander, had been in the\n\nvanguard seeking signs of danger,\n\nblinked a terse message to the\n\nDorchester: “We are being followed. Submarines estimated in\n\nour vicinity. Inform all ships to\n\nclose up tightly and stay closed for\n\nthe night.”\n\nDorchester’s Capt. Hans Danielsen told his ofﬁcers that if the\n\nDorchester was not torpedoed by\n\nmidnight, U-boats would ﬁ nd it\n\ndifﬁcult to operate because of\n\nicebergs in the area, and by the\n\nnext morning the ship would be\n\nin Greenland. The problem now\n\nwas to let the men know that\n\nthere might be danger ahead without alarming them, and he would\n\ndo so at dinner.\n\nAt about 6:30 p.m., the voice of\n\nCapt. Danielsen blared over the\n\nloudspeaker: “Now hear this:\n\nEvery soldier is ordered to sleep\n\nwith his clothes and life jacket on.\n\nRepeating, this is an order! We\n\nhave a submarine following us.”\n\nA grim silence reigned as the\n\nmen stopped eating, their appetites suddenly gone. But then\n\nChaplain Fox stood up and said it\n\nwas time for a party. The amateur\n\nnight that the chaplains had\n\nplanned for a day earlier was\n\ncalled off because of the storm,\n\nbut the sea was calmer now, and\n\nquite a few men who had been too\n\nnauseated to eat now showed up\n\nfor dinner. Anyway, this would be\n\nthe last evening meal on the ship,\n\nwhich was less than 100 miles\n\nfrom Greenland.\n\nMany men remained in the\n\nmess hall until about 11:30 p.m.\n\nFather Washington sat at the old\n\npiano from the Dorchester’s\n\npleasure-cruise days playing\n\npopular tunes, as he once had for\n\nhis parishioners, while the other\n\nchaplains, with their melodious\n\nvoices, helped him lead the\n\naudience in a songfest.\n\nFor the ﬁ rst time, in a sense,\n\nthe four chaplains were doing\n\nwhat they had wanted to do when\n\nthey volunteered to serve in the\n\nwar. To their great disappointment, they had not been sent to\n\nthe battlefronts of Europe or Asia.\n\nBut this peripheral war zone had\n\nbecome the front line for the men\n\non the Dorchester.\n\nFebruary 2005\n\n27\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nThe Immortal Chaplains\n\nThe Rev.

But during one\n\nvacation at his family’s country\n\nhome in New Hampshire, he\n\nclimbed to the top of a mountain,\n\nwhere he hoped to somehow\n\ncommunicate with God. When he\n\ncame down, he told his father that a Moses-like\n\nrevelation had triggered a spiritual awakening in him\n\nand that he would now become a minister.\n\nRabbi Alexander Goode was\n\nboth a brilliant scholar and a\n\nchampion athlete. He won prizes\n\nin debate and oratory, and wrote\n\nthought-provoking treatises on\n\nU.S. and Middle East history.\n\nOften expressing pride that an\n\nillustrious ancestor had fought\n\nunder Napoleon, he had a strong\n\nsense of duty. He also had an\n\nalmost obsessive desire to\n\nspiritually revitalize the world.\n\nWhen Poling became pastor of a Dutch Reformed\n\nchurch in Schenectady, N.Y., he turned the small,\n\ndormant parish into an active, overﬂowing\n\ncongregation that rejoiced in his inspirational sermons.\n\nSome children thought he was Jesus himself.\n\nWith the attack on Pearl Harbor, Poling hoped to join a\n\nﬁghting unit and take the risks of the common soldier.\n\nHe joined the chaplains’ corps when his father told\n\nhim the casualty rate among chaplains was greater\n\nthan that for others. Poling left for war begging his\n\nfather to pray that he would never be a coward.\n\nThe chaplains followed up with\n\nvisits to the staterooms to raise\n\nspirits of the men, and Father\n\nWashington held services in the\n\nmess hall, attended by men of\n\ndifferent faiths.\n\nFebruary 3. At 12:55 a.m., there\n\nwas a great crash, followed a\n\nsecond later by a mufﬂed explosion. A torpedo from German\n\nU-boat 223 smashed the Dorchester amidship slightly aft on the\n\nstarboard side near the engine\n\nroom, ripping a hole from below\n\nthe waterline to the top deck.\n\nThe explosion opened the\n\nway for a virtual tidal wave that\n\nﬂooded the engine room, drowning the oilers and engineers\n\nwho hadn’t already been scalded\n\nto death by vapor escaping from\n\nthe broken steam pipes and\n\nburst boiler.\n\nAt the same time, the ﬂood\n\n28\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nFebruary 2005\n\nServing as a rabbi in a synagogue in York, Pa.,\n\nGoode invited Christian leaders to speak there.\n\nHe helped set up an education system for the city\n\nthat woul"
