Five children were born to this union: Ethel O., Philip I., Thurman J., Lynden E., and Frances E.\n\nHe united with the Zoar Baptist Church in the year 1879, Rev. J. R. Shingleton being the pastor who baptised him into the membership, and he remained a faithful member until the organization of the church at Clay Point, July 7, 1883, when he became a member of that organization, now extinct). He was clerk of this church during its existence, also Sunday School Superintendent, until his health failed him. When the first Baptist Church of this city was organized some eleven years ago he identified himself with it, and retained his membership here till his Master said, \"It is enough\", and on the morning of April 3 he was transplanted into the Church Triumphant on the shores of eternal bliss.\n\nHe has been identified with many of the interests of this county; his counsels were always safe, conservative, and yet progressive He was a friend of the cause of religion; a man of deep conviction, yet had charity with all respecting other men's opinions. He was not one of those that was carried about with every wind of doctrine; he tried things until he proved them and then held to that which was good.\n\nFuneral services were conducted from the First Baptist Church of St. Marys April 5, by the pastor, Rev. M. F. Kiger, assisted by Rev. J. R. Shingleton, after which his body was laid to rest in the Odd Fellows Cemetery to await the resurrection summons. M. F.

REYNOLDS\n\nIsaac O. Reynolds passed away at two o'clock on Sunday morning, November 12, at the home of his brother, Frank M. Reynolds, Grape Island, after having been confined to the house about two weeks with illness. He had been in poor health for some time, but had made no complaint, and his condition was not regarded as serious until he was compelled to return unexpectedly from a vacation trip that he had made to the East. On his return he attempted to resume his position in the Pleasants County Bank, but a brief trial convinced him that it was unwise, and he yielded to the advice of physician and friends and sought rest at the home of his brother. But in spite of the fact that he knew he was suffering from a mortal disease, cancer of the liver, he continued to exercise supervision as far as he could over the affairs of the bank.\n\nThe deceased was the youngest son of Isaac and Cassie (Bills) Reynolds and was born February 4, 1865. He received his first instruction in the St. Marys school, and afterwards attended the Marietta ... that time residing in Harmar. After leaving the academy, he learned the art of printing, and practiced the occupation at Sutton, in Braxton county. Returning to St. Marys; he taught school several terms, and in 1885 was appointed Deputy Sheriff under his brother, D. W. Reynolds. He filled this office in a highly creditable manner, and was continued in the position under Sheriff R. A. Gorrell and again under his brother, making a consecutive service of twelve years.\n\nOn October 23, 1895 he was married to Lucy Clifford, daughter of Mrs. Emma J. (Clifford) Patterson. Their happy wedded life was terminated by the sad death of his wife and child on the 9th day of October 1896.\n\nIn the year 1897 he assisted in incorporating the Pleasants County Bank, the first institution of the kind established in this city, and was appointed its cashier  a position which he filled with universal approbation up to the time of his death.\n\nHe was a member of the Methodist Protestant Church, and was also a member of the secret society, A.F. & A.M., and its kindred organization, the Knights of Pythias.\n\nHis was a quiet life. He keenly delighted in the society of his friends, and was possessed of a remarkably even and cheery nature, never making an enemy that we have heard of. Ever since our first knowledge of him, he and his mother, with the exception of a few intervals, occupied the old family residence at the corner of Lafayette and Second streets and in which it is said the first court of Pleasants county was held.\n\nThe funeral, which occurred on Tuesday, November 14, was the largest ever held in the county. The Masonic fraternity took charge of the remains and brought them from Grape Island to this city at 3:30 in the afternoon. The funeral services were held in the Methodist Protestant Church and opened for a last look at the departed, and the funeral procession wended its way to the cemetery, where interment took place under the management of the Masonic Brotherhood, the remains being lowered into the grave at sunset.\n\nThe pall bearers were James M. Oldfield, Walter F. Varner, F.J. Hinderliter, Julius A. Schauwecker, Charles Steere and Dr. John B. Watson. The floral offerings were magnificent, testifying strongly the esteem and affection in which the deceased was held.\n\n(Gerald Bills)\n\nThe St. Marys Oracle - 15 May 1884\n\nJOSEPH HAMILTON REYNOLDS\n\nIN MEMORIAM\n\nDeath is a sad visitor. It comes unbidden, but often not without a warning, and it leaves the home desolate indeed. Sickness, which is sometimes a precursor of dissolution, only adds to the endearment. Each member of the family in health would willingly suffer in his stead; and when Death finally with his icy hand removes the one thus doubly endeared, each bereaved one seems to think that he or she could have been better spared. God giveth as he sees fit, and taketh away as he likes. Consolation can only come from Heaven. We will no further attempt it.\n\nJOSEPH HAMILTON REYNOLDS, the subject of these remarks, was born in Pleasants county, West Virginia, August 3, 1861. At the age of sixteen he commenced to learn the printing trade, and at seventeen he started to travel, working in several offices in the Southern States. In the year 1881 he entered into partnership with William Devine, and started the \"Rio Grande Vally.\" in Brownsville, Texas. The partnership lasted about a year, when Joseph became the sole proprietor of the paper. He remained in Brownsville during the yellow fever siege of 1882, and passed through the trying ordeal. In June 1883, he returned home in impaired health, and remained here with his mother and friends until his death, which occured May 10, 1884. His disease, which was pronounced consumption, was brought on by over-exertion in his work and lack of proper out-door exercise.\n\nHe was ambitious, and attempted to excel by his own strength, but his constitution gave way under the severe strain, and he returned home a mere physical wreck of his former self. The best medical skill country could afford [sic] was consulted, and all that willing hands and loving hearts could do was exerted for his recovery, but the fell destroyer had seized with a hold that baffled human skill. Death came to him peaceful, and he passed away as calm as the May morning. The friends desire to express their gratitude to the physicians for their efforts in his behalf. They also remember kindly Mrs. Conrad, who, though a stranger, gave all assistance in her power to alleviate the suffering and to console those who mourn a loss that cannot be restored. They also feel themselves under obligations to Green Ruttencutter for his services in officiating at the obsequies.\n\nThe large concourse of people that attended the funeral expresses the estimation in which the deceased was held by those with whom he grew up.\n\n(Gerald Bills)\n\nSt. Marys Oracle - 4 June 1970\n\nLYNDEN E.

She and her fiance had planned to marry in December.\n\nOBITUARY: Minneapolis Psychologist's Free Spirit Recalled\n\nNolan Zavoral, Star Tribune\n\nPublished July 8, 2003\n\nCynthia Ann Riggs had the kind of contagious optimism that drew people to her, even if it meant following her to Patagonia.\n\n\"That was one of the trips we went on -- to Patagonia, in Chile,\" said her friend Jennie Leskala. \"She convinced me we could trek, without training, in the Andes Mountains.\n\n\"It rained, it snowed, but we kept marching. Her famous line was, 'How hard can it be?' I'll miss that the most about her.\"\n\nRiggs, a Minneapolis psychologist who would have celebrated her 39th birthday Monday, died last week while camping in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness with her fiancé, David Sagula, 42, also a Minneapolis psychologist. Inside a tent, they were caught in violent straight-line winds on the night of July 2.\n\nA 100-year-old red pine, 16 inches in diameter, was uprooted and fell on the tent, grazing Sagula and knocking him unconscious and crushing Riggs, said Chip Elkins, a law-enforcement officer with the U.S. Forest Service who assisted the Lake County Sheriff's Office with rescue and recovery.\n\nSagula, bruised on the face and shoulder, said he \"woke from a daze with a bad headache\" and saw that the tree had pinned Riggs.\n\n\"I tried to move it -- I tried many, many times,\" he said Monday night from his home. \"I tried to move her sleeping bag from under it, but nothing. I was panicky. It was surreal.\"\n\nSagula said he could not find Riggs' pulse. The couple, engaged two months ago, planned to marry in December.\n\n\"Part of me knew she was gone. Part of me could not believe it,\" he said.\n\nRiggs' cell phone didn't work, so Sagula set off from Basswood Lake -- on the Canadian border, about 20 miles northeast of Ely, Minn. -- for help. Eventually, he found campers who called for help.\n\nElkins, who flew in on a float plane, said, \"This kind of thing doesn't happen often, but it does happen.\"\n\nA memorial service will be held at 1 p.m. today at the Minnesota Zen Meditation Center, 3343 E. Calhoun Pkwy., in Minneapolis. Riggs is survived by her sister, Susan, of New York City, and her parents, Bill and Connie, from suburban Philadelphia.\n\nRiggs -- whose academic background spanned the University of Georgia (undergraduate), Villanova (master's) and the University of Wyoming (Ph.D.) -- had been clinical director of Sentinel House, which serves people with severe and persistent mental illnesses. She had begun working as a volunteer in that area when she was in high school.\n\n\"It was her life-long passion, to help those that society has cast aside,\" Sagula said. \"She was intelligent and beautiful, and she could have worked with the rich if she wanted to take that route.\n\n\"But that wasn't her. She wanted to work with those who'd been left behind.\"\n\n(Cynthia Ann Riggs was the granddaughter of William Blaine Riggs, Pleasants County, St. Marys, WV .) -GEB\n\n(Gerald Bills)\n\nParkersburg News April 13, 2010\n\nDeborah K.
