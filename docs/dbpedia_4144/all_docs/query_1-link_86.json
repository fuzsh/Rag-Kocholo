He was exchanged and paroled Prisoner at Camp Lee, (near Richmond.) Although I am unable to find any history of a battle wound, I do know that he told my mother that at the time of the exchange he had a \"hurt leg\". Considering the brutal conditions at Elmira, I find it most interesting that he also related that his captors almost refused to let him go because they were concerned he would not be able to make the journey from the prison. He related to my mother that he started crying and the captors relented and set him free.\n\nInformation submitted by Henry D. Berry.\n\nCarpenter, Eleazar \"Eli\"\n\nEleazar \"Eli\" Carpenter was born in 1816, in Georgia, probably in Putnam County, where his father, John Carpenter, Sr., paid land taxes in 1815. The first record we have of Eli was a bill found in the loose papers of John Carpenter's probate records. This bill shows that Eli charged seven twists of tobacco on the 29th of December 1939 at John and D. M Causey's. Eli probably continued to live at home with his mother, until he married Annzena Norris on the 10th of May 1846 in Troup County, Georgia. She was the daughter of Samuel Norris and his second wife, Mary Elizabeth Stone. Eli Carpenter was listed the first of only two times in the Upson County, Georgia, Tax Digest in 1850, where it shows that he owned no land, and paid forty-four cents for poll tax. Then on the 7th of May 1850, he and George W. Carpenter witnessed a deed for their brother, Hamilton. Eli and Annzena Carpenter were enumerated in the 1850 Federal Census of Upson County, Georgia, living between his brothers, Hamilton and John Carpenter, Jr. They had three children at this time, Mary Ann, age 2, Dilly, age one, and an infant, two months old. Dilly is found in an old bible record as Juley Ellender. She died on the 1st of September 1858. The 1850 census and the bible entries of her birth and death are the only record we have of her. The infant listed was William \"Cicero\" Carpenter. Eli and Annzena are both shown as being unable to read or write.\n\nRandolph County, Alabama, is just north of Chambers County, Alabama. Its western edge extends a little ways across the top of Tallapoosa County, Alabama. Eli purchased forty acres in this northwest corner of Chambers County on the 25th of February 1856. The Tallapoosa River cuts this corner of Chambers County from the rest of the county, making Eli's land more accessible to the county seat of Randolph County than the county seats of Chambers or Tallapoosa Counties. In 1860, Eli and Annzena were listed on the census of Randolph County, Alabama, although they actually lived in Chambers County. Eli's occupation was given was farmer. Listed in their household were their five living children, Mary A., Cicero, Lorenzo (Alonzo), Laura E., James, and John H. Eli's brother, John Carpenter, Jr., was living with them and is listed as a farmer. In 1861 in Upson County, Georgia, Hamilton Carpenter, acting as agent for Eleazar, paid twenty-five cents poll tax for him. Eleazar was listed as owning thirty-five acres. This is the last record we have of him till he enlisted in the Confederate Army.\n\nAt Camp Cooper, Macon, Georgia, on the 8th of April 1863, Eleazar Carpenter volunteered for service, and was he mustered into Company B, Sixty-Fourth Georgia Regiment, Infantry, of the Confederate Army. His rank was private, and he received his first and possibly only pay of $50.00. The Sixty-Fourth was sent to Camp Cobb at Quincy, Florida. They arrived there by the 20th of April 1863. Their orders were to \"arrest deserters, sulkers, punish and drive out plunderers and Yankees, collect cattle for the Confederate Government, and help the farmer when possible\". During April, May, June, July and August, many of the men of the Sixty-Fourth deserted. The regiment was still stationed at Camp Cobb for Christmas 1863.\n\nOn the 20th of February 1864, the Sixty-Fourth, with other troops, were in the battle at Olustee, twelve miles from Jacksonville, Florida, at the Florida Atlantic and Gulf Railroad. 2,000 Confederate troops faced 9,400 Federal Troops. The Confederate soldiers were forced to retreat. J. W. Evans, Commander of the Sixty-Fourth, was severely wounded in the right thigh. Total Confederate casualties that day were 7 officers and 86 men killed, 49 officers and 798 men wounded, and 6 men were missing. The Sixty-Fourth, now commanded by Lieut. Colonel T. W. Brevard, remained in Florida till the 18th of April 1864, when they received orders to proceed to Savannah, Georgia, via Callahan, Florida, Traders Hill, Georgia, and Tebeauville, Georgia. They traveled by train, which was probably slow, with numerous delays en route. Before they could reach Savannah, they were ordered on to Petersburg, Virginia. The First Georgia Regiment was scheduled to go to Petersburg, and the Sixty-Fourth was to replace them in Savannah. But the First Regiment, who were heavy artillerists, were deemed necessary to the defense of Savannah, so the Sixty-Fourth was sent to Petersburg in their place.\n\nThe trip from Florida to Savannah, Georgia, and then to Petersburg, Virginia was slow. The railroads were crowded with supplies and troops, all desperately needed somewhere. The Sixty-Fourth had not arrived in Charleston, South Carolina by the 27th of April 1864, but according to one message, \"they would be sent on as soon as possible\". An order was sent the 15th of May 1864 for the Sixty-Fourth to report to General Hill as soon as they arrived in town. In a letter to General Beauregard, dated 19 May 1864, Major-General Whiting wrote, \"We have now but the Sixty-Fourth Georgia Regiment on Swift Creek and the Militia, with Colonel Tate (Sixth Regiment, North Carolina), in town.\" Assistant Adjutant-General James H. Pearce, issued special Orders No. 10 on The 11th of June 1864, to Headquarters in Petersburg, stating, \"the invalid Corps will be stationed at the forks of Baxter and Jerusalem roads. The Sixty-Fourth Georgia Regiment will be stationed from Battery No. 16 to No. 27 inclusive, and Archers Militia from No. 27 extending to the right as far as they will reach\".\n\nLate in the afternoon, on the 15th of June 1864, 13,700 Federal Troops commanded by General William Smith, attacked Petersburg, Virginia. General Smith received two more Federal Troops on the 16 of June 1864, giving him a total of 48,000 men. General Beauregard's troops were also reinforced, giving him a total of 14,000 Confederate soldiers. The Sixty-Fourth had probably arrived with this group of men. The Confederates again managed to hold off the Federal Troops. The next day, 17th June 1864, the battle continued with the Confederates coming under heavy artillery bombardment. Eleazar Carpenter, Captain T. J. Pritchell, and many other Confederate soldiers were captured by the Federal troops. These prisoners were first taken to City Point, Virginia, arriving there on the 24th of June 1864. On the 25th of July 1864, they were transferred to Elmira, New York.\n\nBefore a Confederate could be paroled, an Oath of Allegiance to the United States was required. On the 30th of September 1864, Eleazar Carpenter made his oath, stating he had volunteered in the Confederate Army to avoid conscription, he was 48 years of age, claimed to be a Union man, and had opposed succession. He was paroled the 11th of October 1864, with other invalid (sick and wounded) prisoners. They were to be taken to Point Lookout, Maryland, for exchange. Eleazar Carpenter, sick and suffering from chronic diarrhea, never made it to Point Lookout, Maryland. On the 13th of October 1864, when the train reached Baltimore, Maryland, he was admitted to the U.S.A. General Hospital, West's building. There he was treated with the customary remedies: tonics, astringents, and stimulants. Medications that would have only made his condition worse. On the 31st of October 1864, Eleazar Carpenter died. He was buried on the 1st of November 1864, in the Confederate lot, grave B-46, in the Loudon Park Cemetery, Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nCarson, Andrew M.\n\nA private in Company I, 1st South Carolina Artillery. He enlisted at Charleston, S.C. on January 29, 1862 and was captured at Morris Island, S.C. on July 10, 1863.
