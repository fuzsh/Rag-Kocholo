        "text": "Garry Wills The New York Review Of Books This book is to \"true crime\" stories what War and Peace is to most war novels. It not only gives us the crime of the era, but the era as a crime.\n\nKevin Starr The Wall Street Journal ...Vast, detailed, colorful, at once analytical and driven by a storyline in the best manner of journalism....Big Trouble succeeds as literature as well as history.\n\nFrank Davies The Miami Herald Like a rambunctious Ragtime that captures the brashness and bluster of the United States at the turn of the century, Big Trouble spills over with outsize characters, political and social clashes on a grand scale, and a celebrity murder trial that divides the nation. It's also a bracing portrait of the real, unromantic West.\n\nAlan Brinkley The New Republic This vast and remarkable work of history does many things, but its principal achievement is to reveal how deeply and passionately Americans of the early twentieth century fought each other over issues of power and wealth."
