        "text": "Mary Sue Rudicill (nee Rogers), 80, of Burlington, KY passed away peacefully on Saturday, January 13th, 2024 at University of Cincinnati Hospital.\n\nMary Sue was born in Belleview Bottoms, KY. She lived there all of her life. She deeply loved her community and all of the people who live there. She never tired of doing things for the betterment of her town. Most especially, she loved Belleview Baptist Church. She was a faithful member of the church choir. Her beautiful voice will be remembered by everyone who heard her sing.\n\nMary Sue had an excellent work ethic. She started cleaning for Citizens Deposit Bank as a young woman. She worked her way up through the positions of the banking industry. She served as a founding member of both Boone State Bank and Bank of Kentucky. She was highly respected as a bank director by her peers. In addition to banking, she and her husband Bill founded Belleview Sand and Gravel.\n\nMary Sue embraced all that life had to offer. She loved to travel and enjoyed not only seeing new places but also using her talents to spread love wherever she went. She sang with locals in Ireland, bungy-jumped in New Zealand, sang in the Sydney Opera House, and served on a mission trip in Venezuela. She once even thwarted a would-be pickpocket on a subway in France!\n\nMary Sue was known for being a classy woman. She was diligent about making sure that anything she did was done right. She was also known for being a hardy woman. She enjoyed working on the farm with her husband. She raised a garden every year and canned the produce for all of her life. She loved to cook. She could cut up a chicken for frying with her eyes closed! People loved her homemade pies and sweet pickles. Family and friends often lovingly sparred for the last piece of her chocolate pie.\n\nMary Sue leaves behind a legacy of love. She will be very missed by her family. Her devotion to family was unceasing. This devotion carried over into her church family as well. She was lovingly called “Grammy” by not only her grandchildren but to all those who embraced her as a matriarch. She always wanted to know what everyone was doing and was extremely proud of her family. She enjoyed being a little silly. She won more than a few costume and Derby Day contests in her time. And she was always impressed by an old-fashioned tea party with all the girls.\n\nMary Sue was preceded in death by her parents, Harold “Bucky” and Hilda Rogers; her daughter, Deborah Jo Rudicill; and her brother, Vaughn Rogers. She is survived by her devoted husband of 62 years, Bill Rudicill; her daughters, Susan (Bill) Shuffett, Sandra (Danny) Cupps, and Paula (BJ) Vaske; her siblings, Paul Ethan Rogers, Charlotte Taylor, and Marty (Deane) Blazie; sister in law Evalene Rogers and her brother-in-law, Jim (Carol) Rudicill.\n\nHer grandchildren, Katie (Jamie) Noonan, Myra (Rives) Rash, Christina (Josh) Powell, Cassidy Cupps (Jeremiah Armstrong), Jeremiah Cupps (Anna Doll), Blair Cupps, Luke (Macee) Vaske, Levi (Tris) Vaske, Pollyanna Vaske, Gianna Vaske, Silas Vaske, and Isaac Vaske; and her great-grandchildren, Grace, Will, Harper, T.R., Tyrus, Mason, Caroline and Hudson.\n\nVisitation for Mary Sue will be on Saturday, January 20, 2024, from 11:30 AM until the time of service at 2:00 PM at Belleview Baptist Church. She will be laid to rest at Belleview Cemetery.\n\nMemorial contributions can be made to Belleview Baptist Church\n\nTo watch the funeral service live, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/events/760702909298933/"
