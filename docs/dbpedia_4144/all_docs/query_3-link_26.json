This poignant phrase resonates with the profound sacrifice of the 360,000 Union soldiers who bravely faced death in the pursuit of ending slavery. In a similar vein, 405,399 US soldiers laid down their lives to eradicating National Socialism and the atrocities it committed. These historical facts are indeed powerful, yet they pale in comparison to a personal story that hits closer to home.\n\nMy father was a man of few words, often silent and prone to bouts of anger. He was a tough man, hardened by experiences that he kept to himself. As a child, I stumbled upon a simple, unadorned box tucked away in his closet. Inside it were relics of a past he never spoke about: a medal, a photograph, an olive green cloth shield emblazoned with a bold red '1', and another picture of a man named Edward Allen.\n\nThe box also contained a typed letter, a testament to bravery in battle, providing a brief account of the Battle of A Shau Valley. My younger brother shares the same name, Edward Allen. My father never discussed the contents of the box or their significance.\n\nEvery Memorial Day, my father would retreat into silence, often seeking solace at the bottom of a bottle. His actions spoke louder than words, hinting at a deep-seated pain that he carried. The name Edward Allen is etched on the Vietnam Memorial, a name that coincides with the one found in my father's box and my brother's namesake. I don't know which Edward Allen it is.\n\nThis Memorial Day, as we remember the sacrifices of countless soldiers, let us also remember the silent heroes like my father, who carry their battles and losses quietly, their stories hidden away in unadorned boxes, their memories etched in their hearts and on memorial walls.\""
