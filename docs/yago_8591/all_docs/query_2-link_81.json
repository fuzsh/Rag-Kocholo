We give an overview of the decade and some historical context, and discuss the French silent tradition and how that it transitioned to sound. We also get into detail about two important filmmakers, Jacques Feyder and Jean Vigo. Feyder was an important filmmaker in his time, but his works are not as prominent today, whereas Vigo was nearly forgotten in the 1930s and discovered after the war.\n\nSubscribe: iTunes | Stitcher\n\nOr listen here to it here:\n\nhttp://traffic.libsyn.com/criterionblues/CCU50_-_French_Series_Part_1.mp3\n\nFor other apps or mobile devices, try this link.\n\nOr direct download/listen to the MP3.\n\nEpisode Links & Notes\n\nSpecial Guest: Scott Nye from CriterionCast and Battleship Pretension.
