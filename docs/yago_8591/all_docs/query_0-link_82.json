Attempting to trace the development of twentieth-century Western culture without attending to cinema is unthinkable.\n\nThe importance of cinema in twentieth-century culture has led me to experiment with the inclusion of film along with other historical sources in my course on France in the twentieth century. Rather than including film as it has traditionally been used in history and civilization courses—as an illustration of information already confirmed through readings and other written sources—I wanted to analyze film as a form of cultural practice. Such an approach involves treating film neither as a window on the past (as students often assume it is) nor as a vehicle for false history (as historians often assume it is) but rather as a historical product that both shapes and reflects the world around it. 2 When a film is analyzed both as a vehicle of representations and in the context of its production, distribution, and reception, it can be a valuable [End Page 41] source for both history and historiography. In the classroom, such an approach serves the dual aim of approaching history through film and of understanding film as history.\n\nBecause of my research interest in colonial cinema, I began my experimentation with film in the section of my course devoted to colonial history and the colonial legacy. My rationale for integrating colonial material into a course that previously focused primarily on metropolitan France was similar to that of Alice Conklin, who in a recent French Historical Studies forum makes a convincing case for examining the colonial project in courses on modern France as an integral part of the formation of the French nation. Understanding the ideology behind the civilizing mission, for example, is crucial to understanding the history of modern French republicanism. Linking French history and colonial history in teaching, she argues, and understanding the patterns of inclusion and exclusion inherent to nation-building, can help to break down students' monolithic notions of French identity. Modern France comes into sharper focus as a \"sister republic\" and a multicultural nation faced with many of the questions about race, gender, and ethnicity that shape the modern United States. 3"
