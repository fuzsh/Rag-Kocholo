        "text": "Two French legionnaires lose their way in the Sahara and end up in the lost kingdom of Atlantis where they are enchanted by the irresistible, yet cruel Queen Antinea (Stacia Napierkowska). Major sections of this well over two-hour epic were shot on location in the Sahara: Feyder transported the entire cast and crew to Algeria – to Touggourt to be exact, 800 km south of Algiers – for an eight-month shoot. A daring endeavour in those days. No filmmaker had ever undertaken anything like this, but it was highly successful: L'Atlantide was a global smash.\n\nAt the time, this film’s production was the most expensive ever. The film’s distributor Louis Aubert therefore promised a grand publicity campaign, demanding the presence of one of the cast’s major stars. Stacia de Napierowsca, who played the enigmatic Queen Antinea was picked. Her interpretation was subject to considerable criticism, yet as Feyder’s contemporary Louis Delluc remarked: \"This film’s true star is the desert\".\n\nL'Atlantide was one of the first films to depict France’s colonial presence in North Africa and was followed by a series of other films made during the 1920s that primarily exalted the romantic and exotic qualities of this colonial era. Later examples of this tradition include: Le bled (1929) by Jean Renoir and Le grand jeu (1934) by Feyder himself.\n\nMarmoucha Orchestra\n\nMarmoucha Orchestra will accompany this film in an intimate setting: the Marmoucha Quintet. With an innovative twist, the Quintet will bring this silent film to life once more. Enjoy an performance of passion, drama and beauty with a special musical interpretation.\n\nThe Marmoucha Quintet consists of five talented musicians with a wide range of backgrounds and a shared passion for the music and diversity of musical idioms, styles and traditions in South West Asia and North Africa (SWANA) and the Mediterranean. Their music is an intriguing combination of traditional pieces and own compositions, carefully arranged to this film. Maripepa Contreras, ensemble leader and arranger, created a film score by adapting her own compositions and arrangements from the wide Marmoucha repertoire. She integrates scenic episodes during which the musicians find space for improvisation, which result in a dynamic and emotional soundtrack.\n\nThe quintet consists of:\n\nMaripepa Contreras, oboe, alt-oboe, dudu\n\nMohamed Ahaddaf, oud\n\nAdrian Moncada, piano\n\nArin Keshishi, bass guitar\n\nUdo Demandt, percussion"
