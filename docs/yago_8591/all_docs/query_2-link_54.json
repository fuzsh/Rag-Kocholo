        "text": "Marcel Carne, the French movie director whose 1945 classic, ''Les Enfants du Paradis,'' became one of the most loved and admired films of all time, died today at a hospital in the Paris suburb of Clamart. He was 90.\n\nMr. Carne, whose best work was done between the mid-1930's and the late 1950's, will also be remembered for the ''poetic realism'' of such prewar films as ''Drole de Drame,'' ''Le Quai des Brumes,'' ''Hotel du Nord'' and ''Le Jour Se Leve''; his wartime hit, ''Les Visiteurs du Soir,'' and his postwar films, ''Les Portes de la Nuit'' and ''Les Tricheurs.'' He worked with many of France's leading actors and actresses, including Jean Gabin, Michele Morgan, Michel Simon, Jean-Louis Barrault, Yves Montand, Arletty and Jean-Paul Belmondo.\n\nBut he and other prewar directors known for their carefully scripted and technically meticulous studio-backed films were swept aside by the rebellious young ''auteurs'' of the New Wave film movement of the 1960's. Mr. Carne outlived his contemporaries, but he was gradually reduced to a peripheral figure on the French movie scene.\n\nEven on the 50th anniversary of the release of ''Les Enfants du Paradis'' in 1995, he did not receive the tributes that he felt he deserved and that he often enjoyed abroad. In fact, unusually for a country where the movie director is an all-powerful figure, French film historians often give more credit for the success of Mr. Carne's early films to their screenwriter, Jacques Prevert, than to their director.\n\nHis 90th birthday two months ago also went largely unnoticed in the Paris press, although he was given a party by the owner of the still-operating Hotel du Nord in the city's 10th arrondissement. Today, though, he was officially remembered. President Jacques Chirac thanked Mr. Carne ''for having made us dream so much.'' The Culture Minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, called him ''a major figure of French cinema.''\n\n''Les Enfants du Paradis'' always had its own place in movie history. The three-and-a-quarter-hour film, starring Barrault, Arletty and Pierre Renoir, is based on the life of the 19th-century mime Jean-Baptiste Deburau. Set in the world of theater, it is a story about love, illusions and disappointment.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
