They become the latest in a line of captives whom she has taken as lovers, and who are killed and embalmed in gold after she has tired of them. Morhange however, already grieving for a lost love and planning to take holy orders, is indifferent to Antin√©a's advances and rejects her. Angered and humiliated, she exploits the jealousy of his friend Saint-Avit and incites him to kill Morhange. Appalled by what he has done, Saint-Avit is helped to escape by Antin√©a's secretary Tanit-Zerga, and after nearly dying in the desert from thirst and exhaustion, he is found by a patrol of soldiers. Saint-Avit returns to Paris and tries to resume his life, but he is unable to forget Antin√©a. Three years later he returns to the desert and sets out to find her kingdom again, accompanied by another officer to whom he has told his story. Much of the narrative is contained within a long flashback as Saint-Avit recounts his first visit to Antin√©a; other shorter flashbacks are used within this framework, creating a fairly complex narrative structure",
