2600 "The Hacker Quarterly" is a quarterly publication from Middle Island, NY that focuses on hacking government and company products, websites and protocols, DIY electronic gadgets, programming, telephone tampering and issues concerning freedom and access to information and technology. It's been published and edited since 1984 by Emmanuel Goldstein (a "1984" inspired pen name for publisher Eric Corley). The name comes from the 2600 Hz tone generated by "blue boxes," hacked electronic devices that generated a tone to give users free use of pay phones.

Today 2600 has grown into a widely circulated magazine that still feels much like the small zine it began as. It continues to keep government and corporations on their toes and take a neutral stance towards pushing and manipulating technology to explore how far it can go and be used. 2600 has established the H.O.P.E. (Hackers On Planet Earth) conferences as well as meeting groups throughout the world. 2600 Films has made a feature-length documentary about famed hacker Kevin Mitnick entitled "Freedom Downtime." 2600 has also been involved in many court cases related to technology and freedom of speech.

2600 was featured in The Factsheet Five Zine Reader.
