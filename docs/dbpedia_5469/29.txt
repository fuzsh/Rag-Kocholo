This is the original double DVD release of the FREEDOM DOWNTIME documentary. It tells the story of the Free Kevin movement, along with a fascinating glimpse into the hacker world at the turn of the century. We had so much extra material that it couldn't fit on a single DVD! This two disc set probably has more features than any other DVD ever released.
