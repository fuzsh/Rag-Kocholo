Eric Corley is viewed as a leader of the computer hacker community and goes by the name "Emmanuel Goldstein", after the leader of the underground in George Orwell�s classic, Nineteen Eighty-Four. He and his company, 2600 Enterprises, Inc., together publish a magazine called 2600: The Hacker Quarterly, which Corley founded in 1984, and which is widely respected in the hacker community.

The name "2600" was derived from the fact that phreakers in the 1960s found that the transmission of a 2600-hertz tone over a long-distance trunk connection gained access to "operator mode" and allowed the user to explore aspects of the telephone system that were not otherwise accessible. Mr. Corley chose the name because he regarded it as a "mystical thing," commemorating something that he evidently admired.

2600: The Hacker Quarterly has included articles on such topics as how to steal an Internet domain name, access other people�s e-mail, intercept cellular phone calls, and break into the computer systems at Costco stores and Federal Express. One issue contains a guide to the federal criminal justice system for readers charged with computer hacking. In addition, 2600 operates a web site located at 2600.com, which is managed primarily by Mr. Corley and has been in existence since 1995.

In 1999 Mr. Corley released the full length documentary Freedom Downtime, which he wrote, directed and produced, about convicted hacker Kevin Mitnick and the Free Kevin movement, among other things.
