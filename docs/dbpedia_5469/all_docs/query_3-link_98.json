This will help SCI REMC determine how widespread the outage may be.\n\nIt could be a large outage, it could just be your transformer causing the problem, or a main breaker serving just you and several of your neighbors has tripped.\n\nOutdoor Lights\n\nIf you have an outdoor light that weâ€™ve furnished, check to see if that light is out. If so, chances are the power has been interrupted at a point away from your home."
