        "text": "Jocelyn Levi Straus, one of San Antonio’s most successful community leaders and master fund-raiser, who voluntarily raised millions of dollars to enhance the economic and cultural growth of San Antonio and South Texas, died peacefully at her home, October 8, surrounded by her immediate family, including her beloved husband of 70 years, Joe R. Straus, Jr.\n\nJoci was born January 20, 1931, in Wilkes Barre, PA. to Macolm Levi and Jocelyn Bronson Levi. Her father, a silk manufacturer who dreamed of becoming a rancher, sold his factory before the Depression and in 1934, packed the young family – including Joci, age 3, and her older brother Mike – in their car and headed West. Their last stop was San Antonio, where Levi purchased his first ranch on Old Blanco Road, which is now Timberwood Park.\n\nJoci attended St. Mary’s Hall from first grade through her graduation. She attended Mills College in California, leaving her senior year to marry Joe R. Straus, Jr., a family friend since childhood.\n\nThe couple celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary on June 25, 2022. They were a perfect match— with the same sense of values, humor and interests including fly-fishing, traveling, planning trips across the country with their children and supporting each other in their work and passions. Joci also was a prolific gardener throughout her life, designing gardens for every home, even through her 80s.\n\nJoe told their three children in a family history book, “Always Meant to Be,” “while Joci and I had our hands in political campaigns, restoring theatres, and introducing Texas to the joy of horse racing, nothing has been more important to us than building our family. Each of you is incredibly special not only to us, but to the world, so never be afraid to make your mark.”\n\nJoci credits her parents for instilling the values of civic duty and the importance of helping to build a city. As a couple they instilled those same values in their children and grandchildren, reminding them in the same book to: “be passionate” about your work and your interests,” “be patient” and “have a purpose.”\n\nJoci’s passions, after her family, were the arts, health care, education, and politics, becoming active in the latter through a desire to help move Texas from being a largely Democratic state to one evenly balanced between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nShe first got involved as chairman of the Nixon Girls, a group of women who supported Richard Nixon’s presidential campaign. From there, she served as precinct chair, where she made it her mission to know every person in the precinct and walked door to door registering voters. Her success at adding people to the rolls was huge. Her national reputation began to soar as an exceptional fundraiser when she was John Tower’s finance chair in 1961 for his first campaign for U.S. Senator, which he won, becoming the first Republican U.S. Senator from Texas since Reconstruction.\n\nFor the next 45 years, Joci would serve either as finance or fundraising chair for more than 30 campaigns, including President George W. Bush; Senators Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchinson; most Republican governors since Bill Clements; U.S. Representative Lamar Smith, and State Senator Cyndi Krier. Most notably, she served as Texas campaign co-chair and then as head of the finance committee for George H.W. Bush’s three presidential campaigns.\n\nShe says politics fascinated her not because of power but because “you can make so many wonderful things happen behind the scenes. I’m really interested in seeing results. I don’t care what party you belong to now that we’ve got a two-party system in Texas. I’m very good about saying, ‘Just go vote!’ “\n\nAfter one of the successful presidential campaigns, someone asked if she would like an ambassadorship or another presidential appointment. She thought about it for a minute and said, “I just want to be postmistress of Alamo Heights!”\n\nHer last campaign role was for the first election of her son, Joe R. Straus III, to the Texas House of Representatives. He was then elected Texas Speaker of the House by his peers and served in that role for a decade.\n\nIn the early 1980s, she was asked to be the first chair of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA). She held that position for 17 years.\n\nDuring the 15-year tenure of the Health Science Center’s president, John P. Howe, III, Joci worked tirelessly under his leadership to recruit and build the Center’s donor base and quadrupled research spending from $32 to $124 million.\n\n“She is directly responsible for the excellence we now appreciate at the Health Science Center by inspiring philanthropy focused on faculty recruitment and scholarship,” said Francisco Cigarroa, former UTHSCSA president and Chancellor of the University of Texas System.\n\nJoci’s involvement with United Way of San Antonio and Bexar County allowed her to continue her passion and advocacy of health care, education, and women in business.\n\nAfter serving on the board and chairing the United Way’s annual campaign, Joci created and served as the founding chair of the Women’s Leadership Council to tap into women’s vast ownership of private wealth and encourage their roles as business executives and owners. The council started with a dozen women leaders and 500 members and today has more than 3,000 members. Now known as Women United, the organization has become part of United Way in every major city.\n\nPerhaps her most public legacy is visible with the preservation and restoration of the Majestic and Empire theatres, which were scheduled for demolition in the mid-1980s.\n\nJoci created the non-profit Las Casas Foundation to raise money for the restoration after she was asked to become involved with a public-private partnership, including Arts Center Enterprises and the city of San Antonio.\n\nIn spite of the 1980s real estate crisis, Joci raised $4.5 million for Phase I of the restoration, and the Majestic reopened September 19, 1989, for the fall season of Off-Broadway shows and the San Antonio Symphony.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1998, under Joci’s leadership, Las Casas raised $13.9 million for Phases I and II of the Majestic, and Phase III, the restoration of the Charline McCombs Empire Theatre.\n\nFollowing the first major restorations, Joci encouraged Las Casas to create an annual scholarship competition. Now in it its 14th year, Las Casas Foundation’s Performing Arts Scholarship Program has given more than $1.2 million to talented students pursuing higher education degrees in the performing arts. Las Casas named their awards the “Jocis,” which are given annually to the top winners in each category.\n\nTo honor Joci’s contributions to the preservation of the theatres and the shaping of future generations of theatre patrons, the city named the downtown area that houses the two theatres the “Joci Straus Performing Arts Center.”\n\nJoci also received a presidential appointment from Ronald Reagan to serve on the National Endowment for the Arts, where she met artists from all over the country, and brought several to the Majestic, including legendary Blues performer, B.B. King.\n\nShe was a member of the Texas Cultural Trust Council and the founder of its Texas Medal of Arts Awards.\n\nThroughout her years, Joci has been awarded with numerous recognitions for her fundraising, but perhaps the highest honor she received was the opportunity to meet Civil Rights leader Rosa Parks. Barbara Bush invited Joci to the White House for a private tea she was having with Parks. They were invited to the Lincoln Bedroom where Parks quietly studied the Emancipation Proclamation. Joci recalled spending that time with Parks was a moment she would always cherish.\n\nShe has earned plenty of honors over the years, and all sorts of trophies and photographs filled the shelves over the desk in her home office. Of these many honors, she said: “that’s not important. The important thing is that we spend time with the people we love.”\n\nShe was predeceased by her parents and her brother.\n\nSurvivors include her husband of 70 years, Joe R. Straus, Jr., and their three children and spouses, Lyn Selig (Peter), Susan Straus, and Joe R. Straus III (Julie), as well as her sister-in-law, Debbie Straus.\n\nJoci also is survived by four grandchildren, who knew her affectionately as “Yaya,” Stuart Selig (Laura); Jocelyn Selig Aramburu (Jason) of San Francisco, CA; Sara Straus of Los Angeles, CA and Robyn Straus, of New York City, as well as five great-grandchildren, Peter, Ford and Emilie Selig, and Jocelyn “Soleil” and Ella Aramburu.\n\nA memorial service will be held at 2:30 p.m. on Friday, October 14, 2022, at Temple Beth-El in the Wulfe Sanctuary, 211 Belknap Place, with a private burial. For those unable to attend, please click here to view a livestream of the service. In lieu of flowers, and if desired, contributions may be made to the Las Casas Foundation, the Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UT Health San Antonio, or the charity of one’s choice.\n\nThe Straus family is eternally grateful for Dr. Mark Thornton, Dr. Sudha Seshadri, Dr. Neela Patel, Heart of Texas Hospice, Martha Cave of Helping Our Seniors and her wonderful caregivers: Stacy-Ann Miller, Leondra White, Charslyn Washington, Julia Cabral, Tasha Henderson, Kumbah Turay, Clara Johnson, Eunice Hendricks, Xiomara Johnson, Ana Guerra and their devoted housekeeper of 22 years, Stella Alvarado.\n\nFrances Cuny Richter Swinny was born on October 12, 1923. Frances lived her life with the utmost integrity, always trying to do right by others. For more than nine decades Frances was a strong and ebullient soul beloved by family, friends, colleagues, and countless former students. Frances died on February 9, 2022, in San Antonio, Texas. She was 98.\n\nFrances was born in San Diego, California to Frances Cuny and Paul Richter. She was the youngest of four children. When her father retired from the Navy, Frances and her family moved to San Antonio. Frances was 4 years old when the family drove to Texas in a canvas-topped Star with all four kids in the back seat. Frances recalled that at dusk her precious mother made the kids change into pajamas to encourage sleep while their father drove. Upon arrival in San Antonio the family moved into 138 E. Mayfield. Frances adored the family home, touring by it many times in her later years. She was devoted to her parents and siblings, but recalled, laughing, “the worst thing I ever did was sass my mama.” Frances’ family were serious Lutherans. Every Sunday they would drive from Mayfield to Grace Lutheran Church in downtown San Antonio. Frances always said, “we never missed a Sunday.”\n\nBy elementary school Frances was taller than all the girls her age. Frances’ five maternal aunts jokingly urged Frances’ mother to, “put a brick on her head” to stunt her growth. Frances skipped a grade, “not because I was smart, but because I was so tall.” However, Frances learned from an early age to be proud of her height. She often quoted her father who said, “don’t slump, be proud of your height, throw your shoulders back.” Frances carried her beautiful height and posture well into her 90’s.\n\nFrances attended Harlandale High School where she was Senior Class President and Editor in Chief of the school paper. She was in the Gold Shirt Band, playing the clarinet, but she always claimed she was not very good. Frances was well liked and admired by her teachers and classmates. She graduated high school in 1940 at the age of 16. After high school, Frances went to work for Mrs. Ely, the Bexar County Tax Assessor. During WWII, Frances performed clerical work at Kelly Field and attended night school at St. Mary’s University. Frances found night school less fulfilling than she’d hoped and she told her father, who she adored, “I’m not getting anywhere.” Despite her father’s desire for Frances to remain close to home, she elected to attend the University of Texas in Austin.\n\nFrances embarked for UT after WWII and lived in a university approved boarding house on University Avenue run by “Mama Copeland.” Frances often regaled family with tales of Patsy, the house cook, and Frances’ favorite dish: cornbread muffin with bacon drippings. Her bed was on the front porch, separated from other boarders by shutters. Because her father was concerned about her safety, he tied a rope to Frances’ bed leg with the instruction, “Puddin’, if there’s ever a fire, throw this rope out the window and shimmy down it.” Frances had many fond recollections of her years at UT and graduated in 1948 with a B.S. in Speech Education and English. After graduation, Frances started teaching at Trinity University at age 25. Frances returned to UT and earned her Master of Education in Special Education—Speech Pathology in 1951.\n\nIn her prime, Frances stood 5’11” while sporting a shock of white hair inherited from her father. Frances evolved into an expert seamstress because stylish clothing was not available for a woman of her stature. Frances favored classic tailored attire and high heeled shoes. On many Saturdays Frances drove to Houston Street in her cherished robin’s egg blue Oldsmobile convertible. Though frugal, Frances splurged on the beautiful Oldsmobile with her teacher’s salary. Once she reached downtown San Antonio, she shopped for accessories and shoes to complement the clothing she made. Frances fondly recalled rubbing the soft leather soles of her new high heels on her cheeks. When Frances was “dressed,” she always carried a beautiful handkerchief and regularly sported fashionable hats with kid gloves.\n\nFrances’ mom used to tell her, “Puddin’, you’re too independent, you’ll never get married.” Frances agreed with that notion because in her era the ideal woman was, “five foot two, eyes of blue and I was anything but that!” At Trinity, Frances established a close friendship with a theater student, William Heywood Swinny. Several years after they met, Bill visited Trinity and according to Frances, “he found me in the hallway sharpening my pencil, I was shocked to see him.” Bill had come to inquire, “how about I pick you up and we go to Earl Abel’s after work?” After much thought, Frances agreed to part with some of her independence and Bill and Frances were joyfully married in 1954 at Grace Lutheran Church. For 61 years they maintained their animated banter and remained devoted companions until Bill’s death in 2015.\n\nBill and Frances began their married life at an apartment on Broadway just across the street from Christ Lutheran Church where they were members for years. Later in their married life, they attended services at Margarite B. Parker Chapel on Trinity’s campus. Frances never migrated far from that first apartment. She lived on Lamont, Evans, Imlay, and then back to Lamont before finally moving to The Forum at Lincoln Heights. A creature of habit, she lived, worked, and recreated within a few mile radius. As agreeable as Frances was her entire life, she had difficulty accepting change.\n\nFrances was a revered and beloved institution at Trinity, where she taught for 42 years in the Speech and Drama Department. During her tenure she provided tireless service to the university. She founded the Trinity University Speech Festival which attracted high school students from across Texas to compete in speech and drama competitions. Frances was always driven to excel and in 1972 she began work on her Ph.D. because, “most of my colleagues have a Ph.D.” By 1980, Frances completed her Ph.D. at UT, though she downplayed the title “Dr. Swinny.” Frances was adored and respected by her students and in 1986 she was the first recipient of the ZT Scott Award for excellence in teaching. Her other awards and recognitions include the Piper Professor Award, Danforth Associate, Chair of the Department of Speech and Drama, membership in numerous professional speech organizations, and authorship of many speeches and publications. After a long, fruitful career, Frances retired in 1990.\n\nFrances began retirement at age 66. Still full of energy and drive, she volunteered at Howard Early Childhood Center and Woodridge Elementary School. In addition, she reveled in time spent with her 6 grandchildren. Frances also enjoyed traveling with family, visiting friends, belonging to the TU Women’s Club, attending her monthly Card Group, entertaining in her home, and attending theatre and music productions. She also maintained her lifelong love of singing. Frances routinely broke out into songs she felt were apropos to the conversation at hand. Her knowledge of lyrics was prodigious, and she often stated, “I always wanted to be a big band singer.” Her energy and zest for life impressed all who knew her. She often would say, “you know I like people.” Her excellent health and longevity where attributable to a lifetime of exercise, including many years of Ball Class and weightlifting at Concord Athletic Club. So dedicated to “doing the right thing,” she continued to drive to Concord into her 90’s. Frances’ primary care physician once marveled at Frances’ health and vigor late in life declaring she was, “a victim of her own success.” Frances lived her life with courage and grace and even as time took its toll, she maintained an optimistic attitude. When asked, “how are you?” her inevitable response was, “I’d be ashamed to complain.”\n\nHer absence will be profoundly felt by her son, Stephen Richter Swinny and wife, Betsy Swinny; her daughter, Lisa Swinny Treat and husband, David Lawrence Treat; her grandchildren, William Wheeler Swinny and husband, Chris V Alcoser; Eric Lawrence Swinny; Chloe Treat and husband, Or Matias; India Treat; Keenan Richter Treat; Bronte Treat; and one great granddaughter, Cora Tzipora Matias-Treat; as well as many nieces, nephews, cousins, and dear friends. She was preceded in death by her husband Bill; parents Paul Sr. and Frances Richter; brother Paul Richter, Jr. and wife, Frances Richter; brother Robert Richter and wife, Gwen Richter; sister Marguerite Nemky and husband, Harold Nemky. Frances spent her final years at The Forum at Lincoln Heights where she was treasured by many new friends. The family is grateful for the love, care, and compassion provided by the excellent nurses and staff at The Forum and Kindred Hospice.\n\nMemorials in Frances’ honor may be made to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Southern Texas Chapter, 1776 Yorktown, Suite 560, Houston, TX 77056 or a charity of your choice. A gathering to honor Frances will be held at a later date.\n\nA poet, a teacher, a theatre critic and theatre historian, John left us this year, at the age of 89.

All the books and awards were secondary,” said his niece Christine Kiesel.\n\nFor one of his students, memories from his classroom remain fresh five decades later.\n\n“John Igo was an absolute treasure and I loved him dearly,” said Sarah Reveley, 71, who in 1964 took an advanced literature course at SAC.\n\n“He was a tiny guy, prematurely gray, and sometimes he’d even sit on the desk,” she recalled. “We never knew what he’d talk about. I can’t tell you what we read, but I can tell you that when we listened to Mr. Igo, we learned a great deal.”\n\nA descendant of 19th century settlers, Igo was a lifelong student of the history and culture of San Antonio. His death Tuesday of heart failure at age 89 triggered a flood of memories of those who had known him.\n\nHis cousin Bill Wollers, 83, recalled growing up next door to Igo in the farm country in Helotes. For a while Igo’s family lived in a house without electricity or running water.\n\n“They used an outhouse and kerosene,” Wollers said.\n\nIgo’s love of reading and history were already very apparent, said Wollers, whose favorite story came some years later, when Igo was teaching at SAC and Wollers was attending the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n“My first year up there, John asked me several times to get some books for him out of the main library. When I was getting them, the librarian said, ‘Do you realize these books have not been checked out since 1920-something?’\n\n“But John knew what they were and about a week later, he’d give them back to me, and I’d take them back to the library. They were historical books of some kind. Something about Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain,” he said.\n\nFor Rosemary Catacalos, a former poet laureate of Texas, Igo was an early inspiration.\n\n“He always called me his student, though I never really was, formally. But when I was in high school, he was the only poet around. So I gathered up my courage and approached him, clutching my little high school poems in my sweaty hands,” she recalled.\n\n“And he gave me the best writing advice ever: “Don’t cry. Make me cry!’ It’s also the best writing advice I’ve ever given my own students. Nuestro gran maestro will be profoundly missed,” she added.\n\nIgo was also well-regarded in the theater community for his reviews, which pulled no punches. Igo handed out golden unicorn pins to actors who given good performances and the hard truth to those who hadn’t.\n\n“Some of them were just hilarious,” Charles Jeffries, a college theater teacher, said of Igo’s reviews. “You could just read what was wrong, but you felt OK about it.”\n\nJeffries remembers Igo once coming backstage right after a performance to offer his critique of a comedy.\n\n“This would have been really good if it were funny,” was Igo’s assessment.\n\n“Anybody else, you would have killed him with a stick, but I knew where he was coming from,” said Jeffries.\n\nBryce Milligan, owner of Wings Press, published one of Igo’s last books, “A Stone for Plot Four, or Mendez, a Quest,” about the mercurial San Antonio author Mendez Marks.\n\n“As John would have said, he was in literature for the love of language. He loved everything about language — etymology, obscure grammatical rules, sophisticated puns, archaic words. I never played Scrabble with John, but a conversation with him was often a highly enjoyable linguistic and literary sparring match,” Milligan said\n\n“And the only thing he loved more than language was, perhaps, the intellectual and artistic history of San Antonio,” he added.\n\nThis passion was expressed in Igo’s unofficial role as grammar policeman for the San Antonio Express-News, which he reviewed each day with an eye for fact errors and crimes against the language.\n\n“For six years, he’d call me every day about some problem in the paper, a misspelled word, a grammatical problem, or someone referring to the West Side when they really meant the South Side,” recalled Bob Richter, the paper’s public editor from 2006 to 2012.\n\n“He was usually spot on, and he was polite. He was valuable because he knew so much about the city and he was devoted to making the paper better,” he said.\n\nStricken with arthritis that made writing almost impossible, Igo enjoyed a creative and social revival of sorts in the last decade of his life, thanks to a friend and some modern technologies.\n\n“When I met him, he was a guy sitting in the past someplace. He felt he had really gone to pasture, but once I established his website, he started reconnecting with his former students,” said Gary Demers, also a writer.\n\nThe discovery of a special pen that Igo could use soon had him producing five pages a day, leading to another series of books, Demers said.\n\n“I’d drop off the fan mail, we’d discuss literary projects and collaborate. I’d also drive him to events that other people would host for him. He felt like a celebrity all over again,” he added.\n\nIgo is survived by a sister, Mary Helen Clark, three nieces and nephews, and numerous great-nieces and great-nephews. The family said a celebration of life event will be held at the Helotes Historical Society, but no date has been set.\n\njmaccormack@express-news.net\n\nMaureen Halligan Ibbs (May 5, 1914 – October 19, 2008)\n\nIt is with deep sadness that I share with you this news: Maureen Halligan died early this morning, October 19th, 2008. She had been suffering from a hacking cough but was quite clear mentally and as talkative as ever when I visited her yesterday afternoon.\n\nThen about 2:30 this morning the nurse on duty at Chandler called to tell Dick McCracken that when she went to check on Maureen she found she had died. Apparently, Maureen was awake at the midnight check, but then died before the next one. Dick and I drove over there and waited until the funeral directors came to remove the body.\n\nDetails for Maureen’s funeral are pending due to decisions that have to be made by her family in Ireland. I am sure the newspapers will have those details, but I will also try to reach you with them.\n\nGod grant our precious Maureen the rest she has certainly earned! She is now reunited with her beloved Ronnie! ~Sr. Germaine\n\nMaureen Halligan Ibbs\n\nMay 5, 1914 – October 19, 2008\n\nProfessor Emerita of Theatre, University of the Incarnate Word\n\nInterestingly enough, before theatre claimed her, she was University College Dublin-educated as a cellist and music was her first love. It was the Earl of Longford who enticed her out of University College and into the role of Ophelia in Hamlet. Her interest in music continues today with her support of public radio and television. Indeed, when she traveled to Europe for long periods of time, she left her radio on tuned to classical music.” If someone is going to rob me, “ she says, “They might as well hear the best.”\n\nDuring those intervening years she also performed on the stages of the Abbey and Gate Theatres in Dublin, at the Theatre Royal, in films including Disney productions [the last was Darby O’Gill and the Little People], on television [including Playhouse 90 and Ed Sullivan], radio [Peer Gynt], and theatrical tours to the Mideast. Among those she worked with are the late Carroll O’Connor, Siobhan O’Casey, Dan O’Herlihy, Josie MacAvin and Sir Tyrone Guthrie, and to this day is known for having rejected actor Sean Connery for the Dublin Players as being “too young and inexperienced” to tour America.\n\nIn 1964 Ms. Halligan returned to San Antonio, shortly joined by her husband actor Ronald Ibbs, and together they developed the theatre program at then Incarnate Word College, established a resident company, and helped Incarnate Word not only build a program but a handsome new theatre facility serving the campus and the community. All this while she was responsible for the regional auditions for the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Among the non-theatrical hats she wore during the following years was the directorship of WENCOE, a program dedicated to encouraging women to return to or begin studies in higher education. As a producer, for years she rounded up campus and San Antonio talent for her every Friday at noon Cafe; Ole free entertainment series on campus. One of those groups, The Small World, has continued performing in San Antonio for over thirty years.\n\nFor the three decades after the 1960s, Ms. Halligan and her husband richly deserved the title of First Couple of San Antonio Theatre. They shared their talent and years of professional experience with other theatres in San Antonio, and to this day it would be a rare San Antonio theatre which does not have in their company someone who studied or performed onstage with Ms. Halligan. It would be easy to list the Incarnate Word theatre graduates and the contributions they have made in San Antonio and beyond. It may be more impressive to mention those who never attended, or at least never graduated. Like young high school student Bruce McGill, who came for a professional challenge and is now a major Hollywood actor, or a very talented Jesse Borrego who needed determined Halligan encouragement to “give California a chance,” or a Joe Sears and Jason Williams she gently urged to get out of town.\n\nDedicated to Irish theatre and playwrights, Ms. Halligan from the 1950s forward gave them a showcase in San Antonio and introduced generations of young people to the challenges and wit of this ancient tradition. All this she did by performing as well as teaching. She remembers, fondly, of directing in the early 1960s young Hispanic women of the Little Flower Academy in scenes from Riders to the Sea. These were young women who never even saw the sea, or experienced anything Irish, but knew how to imagine and how to feel poetry. She introduced San Antonio to a theatrical James Joyce, the tragedy of Juno and the Paycock, the hypocrisy of Shadow and Substance, and the humanity of Da.\n\nThe very last expression one ever used in connection with Maureen Halligan and 2008 San Antonio Women’s Hall of Famer is “declining years.” She was a founding board member and performer with the innovative Extended Run Players of UIW, made up completely of senior “retired” performers. She also visited college classes, local radio programs, went on student recruiting trips, rarely misses a theatrical, symphony, chamber music, opera or ballet performance in San Antonio, followed international news with a passion, and very likely could have been a sports consultant on the latest in tennis or golf which she followed with a passion. And the SPURS!\n\nBorn Mary Josephine Teresa Halligan to Michael and Mary MacAvin Halligan in Dublin, she and her sisters were orphaned at an early age. She is predeceased by her parents, her husband Ronald Ibbs Smith-Millard, her sisters Sunniva Clarke and Deirdre O’Connor, and her devoted cousin and co-worker, Josie MacAvin. She is survived by her nieces Sunniva and Oliver Sheridan, Ann and Robin Simmons and nephew Michael Clarke all of Ireland, plus great and great great nieces and nephews in Ireland, England, India and the USA, not to mention legions of other relatives and fans cross the world.

Dan Laurence certainly came to his love of theatre naturally enough. Both of his parents were theatre professionals, even at one time including him in their vaudeville act when he was 12. He was a child actor for a number of years and then became stage manager for “Brighton Beach.” He later worked with well-known stage performers such as Ethel Barrymore, Francis Lederer and Jane Cowl. He was the star of “Captain Brass Band’s Conversation”, which gave Dan his first role in a play written by George Bernard Shaw. Others he worked with were Florence Reed, Estelle Winwood, Buster Keaton, Canada Lee.\n\nThe next phase of his life, which lasted 41 months, was in the USAAF; 36 of those months took him out of the US, serving as a writer and performer for Armed Services Radio. His first assignment was in Australia where he met and fell in love with Fran. For several years thereafter he was assigned to a number of bases in the Pacific Islands and continued to serve as a writer and performer for the Armed Services Radio. He was shipped back to the US when the war ended, preventing him from returning to marry his sweetheart. His father promised him money to return to Australia if he would first finish the one semester, he needed to graduate with a degree in English from Hoffstra University. With that accomplished, he returned to wed his love. She continued to live with her parents while they both worked to save money, so that they could set up a place of their own. The premature birth of their child occurred and both mother and child died before he could reach them.\n\nThen NYU became his focus, as he worked on his Master’s degree serving as a graduate assistant, and later an associate professor of English. Other universities he taught included Indiana University, U of Texas, Penn State, Andrew Mellon, Dartmouth, and Tulane, and in Canada, Guelph and UBC. His passion for the writings of Shaw, through many years of study, became so well known that he was appointed literary and dramatic advisor for the estate of G B Shaw, a position he held from 1973-1990. His association with the Shaw Festival Ontario began in 1982 as literary advisor and member of the acting ensemble. He served as associate director from 1987-2000. He was elected president of the International Shaw Society in 2004, which held a special tribute to him that same year.\n\nThroughout his academic life he wrote prodigiously, and the works were of true merit. Most acclaimed are his bibliographies of the works of Shaw, and Henry James, four volumes of “Collected Letters of Bernard Shaw”, 7 volumes of “Bernard Shaw’s Collected Plays with their Prefaces”.\n\nAdmiration for Maureen Halligan and Ronnie Ibbs, who headed the drama department at Incarnate Word College, drew him to San Antonio. He was a co-founder of OffStage, Inc. and appeared in productions with them and other theatres. His final performance was a play he wrote “G B S in Love”.\n\nHe died this morning Feb. 5th, at The Village at Incarnate Word Retirement Center .\n\nThe family would like any donations in Dan’s memory to go to the Humane Society SPCA at 4804 Fredericksburg Rd. 78229 or San Antonio Public Library at 600 Soledad 78205 or the charity of the giver’s choice.\n\nA memorial will be planned for a later time.\n\nNew York Times Article\n\nDan H. Laurence, 87, Bibliographer and George Bernard Shaw Scholar, Is Dead\n\nBy MARGALIT FOX\n\nhttp://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/f/margalit_fox/index.html?inline=nyt-per\n\nPublished: February 10, 2008\n\nDan H. Laurence, a noted scholar, editor and bibliographer who devoted nearly every waking moment of his professional life to compiling the voluminous works of George Bernard Shaw, died on Tuesday at his home in San Antonio. He was 87.\n\nMr. Laurence died of natural causes, his niece, Jo Fielder, said.\n\nFor many years the official literary adviser to Shaw’s estate, Mr. Laurence was considered one of this country’s leading authorities on Shaw (1856-1950), the distinguished Irish playwright, critic, wit, dyspeptic, professional scold, Nobel laureate and holder of oddly variegated enthusiasms. (Among them: creating a new alphabet; wearing only woolen clothing; and, to varying degrees, Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini.)\n\nA former New York University faculty member, Mr. Laurence devoted half a century to hunting down, amassing, editing and annotating millions upon millions of Shaw’s words. In 1970, he left his tenured professorship in the N.Y.U. English department and moved to Texas so he could be near a major Shaw archive at the University of Texas, Austin. Shaw has that effect on people.\n\nMr. Laurence was known in particular for his massive edition of Shaw’s correspondence, published in four volumes from 1965 to 1988. Volumes 1 and 2 were published by Dodd, Mead; Volumes 3 and 4 by Viking.\n\nThe four volumes comprised 2,500 letters, whose recipients ranged from Paul Robeson to attractive young actresses (there were many) to amateur theater groups. For example, the Akron Little Theater, about to stage one of Shaw’s plays, wired him this bizarre query about the text: “Akron Ohio police refuse to consider knocking out two teeth sufficient justification for jailing.” Shaw wired back, “Ascertain how many teeth will suffice and alter text accordingly.”\n\nAmong Mr. Laurence’s other books are “Bernard Shaw: A Bibliography” (Oxford University, 1983), a two-volume work that is widely considered definitive; “Shaw’s Music: The Complete Musical Criticism in Three Volumes” (Dodd, Mead, 1981); and “Collected Plays With Their Prefaces” (Dodd, Mead, 1975), which in seven volumes collects famous works like “Pygmalion” and “Major Barbara” with lesser-known entries like “Fanny’s First Play,” the source of the criminal dental scene.\n\nMr. Laurence also assembled several volumes of Shaw’s previously unpublished writings, a task that amounted to scouring the world for buried treasure. Much of Shaw’s early work was unsigned, or published under pseudonyms like Shendar Brwa (rearrange the letters), William Watkins Smith and the Rev. C. W. Stiggins Jr. of Box Hill.\n\nThese volumes include “How to Become a Musical Critic” (1961), “Platform and Pulpit” (1961) and “The Matter with Ireland” (1962, compiled with David H. Greene), all published by Hill & Wang. Mr. Laurence’s non-Shaw books include “A Bibliography of Henry James” (R. Hart-Davis, 1957), done in collaboration with Leon Edel.\n\nThe one book Mr. Laurence was not able to write was a Shaw biography, a fact that by all accounts stung him deeply. In the late 1960s, the Society of Authors, a British organization, commissioned Michael Holroyd to write a new authorized life of Shaw. Mr. Holroyd is a noted English biographer but not an academic.\n\nAs was widely reported afterward, the selection of Mr. Holroyd awakened in Mr. Laurence a certain natural combustibility. In 1976 he resigned for a time both as the editor of Shaw’s letters and as the literary adviser to the estate, a post he had held since 1973. (Mr. Laurence was later reinstated, serving until his retirement in 1990.)\n\nAt the height of the fracas, Mr. Laurence publicly called Mr. Holroyd “a horse’s rear end,” “a spiv” and “an incorrigible fool,” as The New Statesman reported in 2002. It was all very un-Shavian, or perhaps not. (“Spiv,” n., slang, chiefly British: Someone who lives by his wits without being gainfully employed; a wheeler-dealer.)\n\n“He was more gifted in vituperation and anger than he was in generosity,” Mr. Holroyd said of Mr. Laurence in a telephone interview on Friday. “But even in anger, there was someone inside trying to get out. And a number of people, when he left the room — even if he’d been angry in that room — they would feel a strange sympathy for him, as if they were feeling for a better self locked inside him that he couldn’t release very easily.”\n\nMr. Holroyd’s detailed account of the fracas can be found in his essay collection “Works on Paper” (Counterpoint, 2002). His biography, “Bernard Shaw,” was published in four volumes by Random House starting in 1988.\n\nDaniel Hyman Goldstein was born in the Bronx on March 28, 1920. (In 1946, his niece said, he changed his surname for professional reasons; the fact that it made him D. H. Laurence was a fringe benefit.) He earned a bachelor’s degree from Hofstra University in 1946 and a master’s from N.Y.U. in 1950.\n\nIn World War II Mr. Laurence served with the Army Air Forces in New Guinea, the Philippines and Australia. He taught English at Hofstra before joining the N.Y.U. faculty in 1962.\n\nDuring the war Mr. Laurence met and married a woman in Australia; she died soon after. Mr. Laurence never spoke of his wife until a few years ago. Only then did his family learn that he had ever been married, his niece, Ms. Fielder, said.\n\nMr. Laurence leaves no immediate survivors.\n\nIn the interview on Friday, Mr. Holroyd praised the commanding depth of Mr. Laurence’s scholarship.\n\n“What I must say is — and I’m not just saying this because he’s dead — he was a pre-eminent bibliographer and a superlative editor of Shaw’s letters,” he said.\n\n“I always felt that if I had said to him, ‘Dan, what was Shaw doing on the 30th of January, 1932?’ he would have said, ‘You mean in the morning or the afternoon?’ And then he would have told me.”\n\nOriginally posted here\n\nMemorial Celebration: Tuesday, July 1, 2008 from 7-9 pm at the Assembly Room at Incarnate Word Retirement Facilities at 4707 Broadway next to HEB Central market. Trey Cunningham will be doing a video about Dan and it is possible we will have some live performance. For sure, we will also have time for informal reminiscences.\n\n~Jon Kaplan\n\nCondolences\n\nIt is with great sadness and profound respect for Dan Laurence that I remember him today. He was truly a gentleman of theatre filled with a passionate vitality for scholarship in literature and theatre. I worked with him on two occasions, namely in ReJoyce, a production of his creation with Maureen Halligan celebrating the genius and craftsmanship of James Joyce and when he was kind enough to lecture on George Bernard Shaw after our performance of Dear Liar at St. Mary’s University. This was a production in which Ian McCord and I acted in Jerome Kilty’s play of the relationship between George Bernard Shaw and Mrs. Patrick Campbell. As Literary Editor of the Shaw Estate, Dan graciously fielded questions from the audience and contributed much to the academic dialogue of that evening.\n\nOne could obviously note the realm of Dan’s intellect and yet he possessed an endearing sense of humility. As I was the stage manager, he always asked me to critique his stage performance. “Am I too loud, Bodie?”. He knew well enough his exuberance could be overpowering. I always assured him that he was just fine. The audience would welcome such personal care and commitment to his performance. One night’s performance of ReJoyce brought him to the aid of his fellow actor, she had a bit of “dizzy spell” onstage and Dan immediately rescued her by guiding he gently back into the performance. These two had tremendous love and respect for each other as artists and friends.\n\nThe San Antonio community has lost an astounding figure…one whose pursuit of poetic knowledge will always remain with those he touched. May God rest and embrace Dan with His everlasting peace.\n\n~Assoc. Prof. Bernadette Hamilton-Brady\n\nI wonder if San Antonio knows how lucky and blessed we were to have Dan Laurence with us to share his intellect and talent for so many years.\n\nI think UT would have given up at least one of their horns to have had him at the Ransom Center as a resident scholar.\n\nBut he loved San Antonio.\n\nDan never had an earned PhD and turned down all offers for honorary degrees. For him it was philosophical; he did not think it was right to accept a degree you did not earn.\n\nIndeed. Dan was more humble than the late Chaucer scholar George Lyman Kitteridge who also never earned a doctorate. When asked why he never went for the doctorate his answer was to the point: “And who would ask me questions?”\n\nDan’s last words to the late Ronnie Ibbs were “It has been a good run, Ronnie.”\n\nDitto, Dan. Ditto.\n\n~Dick McCracken\n\nIt was a life well spent in the service of Thespis!\n\nI would like to add to Dick’s eulogy by describing Dan’s interest on entertaining (rather educating!) his fellow residents at the Incarnate Word Retirement Center.\n\nI believe he had initiated some kind of a literary club, because he would come to the library to retrieve specific poems to recite or share with members in his Retirement Literary Circle. It was an honor to get to know Dan as a literary researcher. Mendell Morgan and I held him in high esteem and assisted with his research questions. Even though weak, he would make a serious effort to walk the distance from the Retirement Center to the Library to do research. I remember how lucid his mind was: He would very readily recall titles of poems and first lines. He knew exactly what he was looking for, even where the poems were published! A brilliant and committed researcher to the very end!\n\n~Basil A. Aivaliotis\n\nI had the honor of meeting Mr. Laurence. He had a wonderful sense of humor. I loved hearing him read, he had a wonderful voice. He is certainly with our Lord now, entertaining the angels with his laughter and joie de vive.\n\n~Sidney Ann Spencer\n\nDan Laurence loved the theater. He loved the plays and players. He loved to act. He was eager to mentor young artists and reminisce with older ones.\n\nHis performance as a conservative judge in my production of THE TRIAL OF THE CATONSVILLE NINE contributed substantially to the success of the production and was the beginning of our long friendship.\n\nWhen I directed HEARTBREAK HOUSE he gave me a reading list and photocopies of Shaw’s postcards to the original cast. When he called my staging of act three “sensitive” I felt I had arrived.\n\nThrough Dan’s influence I was allowed to be an assistant director at the Shaw Festival although the artistic director was very reluctant to give an American an opportunity in a festival subsidized by the Canadian government.\n\nThroughout the ups and downs of my career, Dan was always available with a helpful suggestion, an encouraging word, or a perceptive criticism. I am only one of the many artists who have benefited from Dan’s generosity.\n\nDan’s mind was a theatrical encyclopedia. His meticulous scholarship graces Shaw’s collected plays, collected letters, and collected music criticism. As the Literary Editor of the Shaw Estate, he was fiercely protective of the texts. Like Shaw, Dan believed the theater could change the world. He spent his life dedicated to that noble proposition.\n\n~Charles Conwell\n\nProfessor of Theater\n\nUniversity of the Arts\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nMemories are strong and thanks to Dan and Judy Jay of OffStage for opportunities in the theatre\n\n~Joyce Lambrecht\n\nI worked with Dan on the Extended Run production of GBS In Love… one summer, for Practicum. I still have a copy of the script…which I tried to retype (It had some typos) but Mr. Laurence would not let me…he was fun to work with … despite his habitual grumpiness. It was an honor to know him.\n\n~Amy\n\nErnie Baumann (January 28, 2008)\n\nIt is my unhappy responsibility to inform our SATCO membership that Ernie Baumann passed away peacefully last night (January 28, 2008). Many will remember Ernie for his wonderful sense of humor, deep voice and hardy laugh which he brought into everything that he was involved in. He was selected for our prestigious level of involvement – The Living Legend in 2003. He will always be that to those who knew him — A Legend. Arrangements are pending, we will let you know as soon as we have more information. We will miss you Ernie! ~Charles Jeffries SATCO President\n\nObituary:\n\nPublished in the Express-News on 2/3/2008.\n\nErnest G. Baumann, Major USAF(Retired) (a.k.a. Dirty Ernie) died January 29, 2008. His ambition was to live to be 100, but he did not make it. In Ernies’ own words, “I was born in Buffalo, New York on November 3, 1920, to Ernest D. Baumann and Susan K. Baumann. For The good of mankind, I was an only child. I graduated from the U.S. Army Air Corps flight school as a Second Lt. in March 1944. Flew 35 missions over Europe in WWII as an aircraft commander of a B-17 with the 8th Air Force.” He retired from the Air Force in 1964 as a commander pilot with over 6000 hours in the air. He was proud of the fact that he started flying in Piper Cubs and progressed to flying jet bombers. After retirement, he was very active in the local theatrical community. In 2003 he received the prestigious Living Legend Of Theater award from Theater Arts Coalition Of San Antonio. He performed at all of the major area theaters. His roles extended from Old McDonald in children’s theatre, the Pope in “The Day They Kidnapped The Pope”, to starring as the Lone Ranger in dozens of Old Time Radio Productions. He performed with Death by Design Murder Mystery Troupe, The Extended Run Players, and was a featured soloist with The Cadenza Singers for the University of the Incarnate Word. He appeared as the singing bus driver in the 1980’s Via commercials. He co-hosted the “Adopt a Pet” segment on the KENS TV Morning Show for over 20 years. In his final stage appearance, he was a featured performer in the University of the Incarnate Word 2007 production: “Memories on Review: Tales of WWII” sharing his wartime experiences. Following this, he was selected to appear in the KLRN film production “World War II: In Our Words,” which aired locally in August 2007. He was President of the Board of Speech Arts Association of San Antonio, and past President of the Auxiliary at Warm Springs Hospital where he did volunteer work for many years. He was preceded in death by his eldest son, Robert E. Baumann who died in 1991. He is survived by his loving wife of over 63 years, Lois (Chips) P. Baumann, his step-mother, Inez Baumann of Buffalo, New York, his brother-in-law, Robert Schroeder and wife Betty Schroeder of Buffalo, New York, sons, James R. (Mie) Baumann and John E. Baumann of Austin, Texas, grandchildren, Heather C. Baumann and Nathan C. (Susan) Baumann of Austin, Texas, great grandchildren, Christian Robert Baumann, Lux Louise Baumann and Nicole Baumann of Austin, Texas as well as a multitude of friends.\n\nFriends are invited to join in a joyous celebration of his life at Harlequin Dinner Theater at Fort Sam Houston on Monday, February 4, 2008 from 2 pm till 5 pm.\n\nSunset Funeral Home.\n\nA Memorial will be held for Ernie at the Harlequin Dinner Theatre on Monday, February 4, at 2:00pm. In keeping with his wishes, this will be something akin to an Irish wake where he will be remembered with laughter and dirty jokes, where everyone toasts the departed and tells wonderful stories about him. Bruce Shirky at Harlequin Dinner Theatre will be coordinating the memorial. If you have stories and/or pictures to share, could you please forward to him? (please contact playbill@satheatre.com if you do not have his contact information, I will forward information to him.) The Memorial will be a Pot Luck affair. Thank you.\n\nCondolences\n\nErnie was one of the first actors I met here in 1975 when I took this job at Harlequin. We miss him. ~Florence Bunten\n\nI did my first play with him at the Harlequin. I was Nurse Preen to his Mr. Whiteside. He was wonderful to me. I will very much miss him and will always remember his laugh. ~Kathleen Lovejoy\n\nErnie, I salute you for all the great characters you brought to the San Antonio stages. And I salute you and want to say “thank you” for your service to our country, for stepping up as a young man to face the perils of a World War, and for you and your generation who literally saved the world for us some 65 years ago. If it wasn’t for you and others like you, we would not be living in a free society and practicing our art the way we can today. I know God has opened up his gates widely for you and that all of the San Antonio theatre greats who have past on are welcoming you. There will be one great cast party in heaven tonight! I truly thank you and salute you Ernie, ~Steven Stoli\n\nBeing on stage with Ernie (& Alice Finney) in “A Curious Savage” in 1997 gave me a wealth of memories that still make me smile! Ernie’s distinctive deep voice, his glorious laugh, his spot-on characterization of a respected, slightly befuddled doctor gave such warmth to the production. He will live on in my heart, & I’m sure in numerous other members of the San Antonio theatre family. He will be missed; he will not be forgotten. ~Ayn Phillips\n\nYou were a charming Dad! ~Suellen\n\nThanks for all your years of devotion to your country, your family, your friends and to Theatre. Your joyous nature will be missed. ~Bobbie Laughter\n\nI was lucky enough to meet Ernie as my “Sherry” in my first show at the Harlequin, “The Man Who Came to Dinner”. And I was lucky, honored, and blessed to have known him as a fellow actor and incredible friend ever since. His sense of humor, sense of respect, and sense of being for himself and those around him was wonderfully infectious. Miss you Ernie. ~Sherri Small Truitt\n\nI had the pleasure of working with Ernie in an improv murder mystery group called Death by Design. When I first met him, I wondered how a man in his eighties could do this type of audience interactive improvisation. I learned during the first show to keep an eye out for Ernie…he had lightening quick reflexes and an incredible sense of comic timing. He blew me away and taught me more than a few things about improv. I was honored to have known him. May God bless his family in this sad time. ~Renee Garvens\n\nChips and Ernie and I have been friends since the earth cooled down………..they have become my family. Playing Mrs. MacDonald to Ernie’s Old MacDonald was an adventure in itself; having him sing with Cadenza Singers was a never ending, delightful surprise. I’ve taught music for many years and directed many choirs, but he’s the first singer I ever had who sang in the key of LOUD. He’d do any song that was handed to him…….”I’m GittinNuttinFerChristmas,” to “Would You Rather be a Colonel With An Eagle On Your Shoulder Or a Private With a Chicken On Your Knee?” His voice boomed out to the delight of hundreds of listeners. With all the roles he played, the most perfect was that of the Lone Ranger in the radio shows. This was absolute type casting…….for if there ever was a Lone Ranger, he must have been just like Ernie Baumann. He will always be a light in our dark world, and he will always be with us…….he loved us and we loved him…….and love never dies. ~BJ\n\nI first met Ernie in ‘The Day They Kidnapped The Pope’ and Ernie was the Pope. A wonderfully talented and gregarious person who brought an entirely new perspective to that role. His one minute nap during one portion of the show, one nite, was typical of how relaxed he was on stage. He never missed a beat when he awoke. His warm smile and quick wit made him a pleasure to be around. I don’t believe he ever met a person that he didn’t like. I will miss him. ~Frank Williams\n\nI am so sorry to hear of the passing of Ernie. I remember my first thought of Ernie was “Who is the crazy man”. He was big, I do not mean of size, I mean of his spirit and his presence. He would consume any space that he occupied. It was like his spirit could not be contained within his body. Every night while doing Arsenic and Old Lace I would look forward to the blare of a trumpet and Teddies charge. My ears still ring with it this 30 something years later. Many have played that part throughout the years but I doubt any had the fire and energy of Ernie. Looking back at that time in my life I was so young and I am now Ernie’s age. Somehow, I never considered what his age was, he was just one of the wonderful group of my dear friends. I am sorry to have heard of the passing but I’m sure Ernie, wherever he is, is charging thru the after life with as much enthusiasm as he charged thru life. ~Rick Harrison\n\nA sad day for the San Antonio Theatre community. Ernie was such a sweet and funny man. He was always there with a good hearty laugh and probably some of the ‘dirtiest” jokes I have ever heard. Thank you for support, and the memories Ernie; and behave yourself in that great theatre in the sky! You will be missed. ~Jerry Pilato\n\nErnie and Chips lived across the street from me when I lived on Brook Hollow. And every time Ernie would see me in my yard, he would always yell some rowdy greeting and wave. One morning very early, I was out chasing “Bubba”, a stray dog I had found near my mother’s house. Fortunately, Bubba was not very fast, so I caught up to him easily. But as I bent over to grab his collar, the seat of my seersucker pajamas ripped right out. So there I was “mooning” all of the traffic on Brook Hollow. Ernie was one of many who got “mooned” that morning. He simply broke out into a loud rendition of “BY THE LIGHT OF THE SILVERY MOON” and crossed the street to save “the damsel in distress” and help capture the dog, laughing loudly all the way. That’s just the kind of man he was…laughing and joking and singing songs at the top of his lungs. I never saw Ernie that he didn’t have a smile on his face or a great twinkle in his eye!!! He was “a darlin’ dear”, a great loving bear of a man, whose laughing and singing and showmanship I will sorely miss. He would so love that we are doing a proper “Irish Wake” to celebrate his life and good times. Looking forward to seeing lots of theatre folks there. ~Amy LaPresto\n\nWhether it was his “Harumph!” or his “Scrabble Clause” or the twinkle in his eyes or the way he jumped into everything with both feet doesn’t really matter. What truly mattered with Ernie was (and is) his soul and how much he enjoyed life. I first met Ernie in 1989 at SALT and remained impressed with how much of a wonderful person he was. He had arms big enough for everyone, whether in a two-person or huge cast. Ernie became an integral part of my company, Death by Design, and for 16 years kept us in stitches both in rehearsal and in performance. He also set a very high bar for everyone else to try and attain. Ernie might be gone, but he’ll be with me in my heart forever. ~David Jackson\n\nMany memories…..Chips I hope you got our message from Mexico…I know the celebration will be moving…I repeat Ernie will direct and not have to learn lines…his ad libs were always the best….Always ~Joyce and Bill Lambrecht\n\nMy first recollection of Ernie was being in a production of “The Three Cuckolds” with him at the old Fort Sam Playhouse. He played the Devil and was a mighty presence to behold emerging from a trapdoor! After that he really worked his way up, so to speak, to give many wonderful performances. RIP Ernie. ~John Eubanks\n\nI met Ernie when I was 13 years old. I knew him as “Dirty Ernie” and I thought he was cool because he was on TV. Back then he was a regular on the news for adopt a pet. I never missed a show. It wasn’t until I was much older that I solidified a real relationship with Ernie. He wasn’t really a dirty old man as he liked to be perceived as. I liken Ernie to George Burns. Recently I was reading Wisdom of the Nineties by Mr. Burns and I made the connection between Ernie Baumann and George Burns. In George Burns’ book he speaks about Gracie and how his persona with women and dirty jokes was just his MO, he was totally devoted to Gracie who was truly the only woman for him. When I got to know Chips I knew immediately that she was Ernie’s Gracie. His “Dirty Ernie persona” was just that — a persona. It was just an act, just for fun. I had a new found respect for Ernie through his relationship with Chips. Then he presented me with a business card with the title of “noted authority” and I thought what could this guy possibly be an authority on???? As it turns out, quite a lot. Ernie gave me a historical frame of reference that I couldn’t have paid for in any school. From his personal experiences I learned about life during the depression, I had first had knowledge of the war from a soldier’s point of view. Ernie was a patriot, a humanitarian, a teacher and an artist. He was also a lot of fun to be around. I will forever treasure the life lessons Ernie gave me. I cannot remember a time in the San Antonio Theatre Community without Ernie Bauman. I have a 20 year history with Ernie but I will treasure my memories with Ernie for my entire life. There is a hole in my soul which can never be replaced. When I think of Ernie, I will always smile and then smirk. God bless Ernie and please take care of my good friend who deserves a special seat in heaven. Sincerely, ~Shelly Chance\n\nErnie, Ernie, Ernie … Where do I begin? I have shared the boards with Ernie many times and each was pleasure. I have heard so many stories and relived his life so many times … at my prompting … and each time walked away with knowledge only someone who was there could have given. I learned about the war, the depression and the deep devotion a man could have for a woman. I have been in dressing rooms where everyone was complaining about his significant other … except Ernie. I remember thinking how wonderful it must be to truly love his wife. Chips was his strength, his passion and his reason for living. How happy his life must have been. When Allan and Teri Ross were kind enough to throw Shelly and me an engagement party, he gave us a toast wherein he wished us the happiness he had shared with Chips for 60 years. I hope that comes true. Then there were his sons whom he thought the world of. He spoke of them often. Add them to Chips and he was a happy man who lead a happy life. There was one show we did when he told me he considered me a son as well. I have had no greater honor. My fondest memory of working with Ernie was when we were doing Finnian’s Rainbow. Ernie was playing Senator Billboard Rawkins. He was costumed like Colonel Saunders. So naturally, on closing night, he descended the flowing staircase carrying two buckets of Kentucky Fried Chicken. I loved him from that moment on. Our last show together was Defying Gravity. When we weren’t messing with each other on stage we certainly were off stage. It was nothing but fun. Oh Ernie, I’ll miss you so much. You were my tutor, my confidant and my friend. Good bye, noted authority. God bless you forever. ~Donnie Neubauer\n\nThe first time I met Ernie I had gone backstage at the Harlequin to see some friends in their show. When I walked in Ernie was delivering the punchline to a joke that left everyone in stitches. Now, deprived of Ernie’s talent and wit, I wish I had walked in a little earlier and shared one more of his jokes. We will miss you Ernie. ~Paul Lydston, Jr.\n\nTo my dear darlin’ Dirty Ernie,\n\nOne of the very 1st shows I did in San Antonio was lo these many years. You were Teddy, I was Aunt Martha, and Alice Finney was Aunt Abby in the Harlequin Dinner Theatre production of “Arsenic & Old Lace”. Along with Chris Champlin, Harry Huff, Rick Harrison, and several other fortunate ones, we shared with you what theatre is all about. I will cherish that memory as well as the more recent appearance on stage with you in “Twigs”. I thank you for being the “one who got it” when we wrote in our 20th wedding anniversary 12 years ago: “dress appropriately”—you showed up in that tuxedo, red cummerbund & red bowtie, with no shirt—what a hoot! I will rejoice in the laughter, joy, and magic moments of your presence; and that will help me not to miss you so much. Bruce & I send our love, prayers, & best thoughts to Chips & your family. ~Love, Sherrie Shirky\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting Ernie through the Extended Run Players. Ernie was a unique personality with a wonderful laugh and sense of humor. I am so glad to have known him and to have played “Silver” to his Lone Ranger. My prayers are with the Baumann family. ~Jillian Villejo\n\nJoe Glenn Leard, 64, one of the finest character actors in San Antonio community theater, died at a local hospital Wednesday following surgery.

His parting came much too soon. I would like to have laughed and worked with him longer.\n\n~Sincerely, Martha Buchanan\n\nThe Memorial Service for Marianna Blase was held at 5 p.m., Sunday, April 7, 2002 at the San Pedro Playhouse.\n\nIt is my sad duty to report that Marianna Blase passed away Thursday afternoon, March 14, 2002 after a long battle with cancer.\n\nMarianna was a true San Antonio theatre legend. Indeed, she was recognized a few years ago for her vast achievements at the SATCO Living Legends Gala. Her performances included major roles in THE GLASS MENAGERIE, MORNINGS AT SEVEN, ANASTASIA, THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST, and many, many others. She also worked extensively in television.\n\nA memorial service will be held on April 7 at the San Pedro Playhouse, time to be announced. I will let you know of any additional details as they become available.\n\nWe at SATCO extend our deepest sympathies to Marianna’s husband Bob, her family, and her many close friends.~\n\n~Joe Libby, President, SATCO\n\nMemories of Marianna Blase, 72, local theater icon, rabid Spurs fan\n\nBy Sonja Garza (Express News)\n\nGifted actress Marianna Blase, described as “a queen of local theater” with an incredible stage presence, died Thursday at her San Antonio home. She was 72.\n\n“She was one of the great ladies of San Antonio theater. She was an absolute joy to work with and was a true actress in every sense of the word,” said Vivienne Elborne, artistic director for the San Pedro Playhouse.\n\nWhile gracious and giving on stage, Blase accepted no less than the best from her fellow performers, Elborne said.\n\n“She really lifted them up by her own performance,” she said.\n\nBlase, who started her career in New York City and moved to San Antonio in 1959, was honored two years ago along with theater veteran John Igo by the San Antonio Theater Coalition at its Living Legend Tribute Dinner.\n\nAt the time, playwright Sterling Houston was quoted in the Express-News as saying the two set the “standards for the rest of us for decades.”\n\n“As for Marianna, we chose her because of her incredible stage presence, consistency in her work and dedication as a performer,” Houston said in the October 2000 article. “She stayed here in San Antonio and accepted to work for much less money than she could have made elsewhere.”\n\nWhile Blase appeared in television and had feature roles in several movies, including Steven Spielberg’s 1974 “Sugarland Express,” the bulk of her work was in theater, appearing on most San Antonio stages.\n\nThe longtime thespian’s husband, Bob Blase, recalls that Spielberg told his wife, “If you ever get to California, look me up,” after they finished shooting “Sugarland Express,” which used San Antonio as one of the location sites.\n\n“She had a big scene with Goldie Hawn near the end of the movie,” her husband said.\n\nThe recipient of four Globe Awards in the 1990s — including “Best Actress in a Play” and “Best Actress in a Comedy” — Blase appeared in more than 50 roles, some of them more than once.\n\nPerhaps her most memorable role was that of Amanda in the Tennessee Williams’ play “The Glass Menagerie,” which she performed several times. But Elborne said she remembers Blase best as Lady Bracknell in “The Importance of Being Earnest.”\n\nDescribed as a “huge personality” with a wonderful sense of humor, Blase was known to be a big Spurs fan who taped the games and took her radio to the theater.\n\n“She was a fan of life — that’s what she was,” Elborne said.\n\nIn addition to her husband, Blase is survived by two daughters and a son.\n\nA memorial service, “A Celebration of a Life: Memories of Marianna,” will be held on April 7 at 5 p.m. at the San Pedro Playhouse.\n\n“All people who want (to) can participate in the service by sharing a memory,” Bob Blase said.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests that tax-deductible donations be made to the Permanent Maintenance Fund of the San Pedro Playhouse, P.O. Box 12356, San Antonio 78212.\n\n~sgarza@express-news.net\n\nLocal legend Blase full of fire when playing ‘Menagerie’ role\n\nBy Mike Greenberg\n\nSan Antonio Express-News\n\nI had a pretty good idea what first-class acting was like. I’d seen Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy in the glory years of the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, in the late ‘60s. I’d seen a lot of theater in Chicago, at the time the nation’s hottest stage cauldron, when I worked there in the ‘70s.\n\nBut then, during a vacation visit back home in the spring of 1976, a column by Glenn Tucker in the San Antonio Light induced me to go to the Harlequin Dinner Theater to see Tennessee Williams’ “The Glass Menagerie.”\n\nThat production sticks in my memory to this day. I can still hear the slightly quavering voice of the son, Tom, in the prologue — he was played by Richard Jones, who would go on to have a distinguished run in San Antonio theater. I can still see the Gentleman Caller, Jim, played by Tom Parker, who would become a major figure in Austin theater.\n\nAbove all, I still feel a thrill recalling the Amanda of Marianna Blase. One little phrase from Amanda’s monologue — “Malaria fever and jonquils,” a line that Blase infused with worlds of nostalgia and regret — remains one of the most prized objects in my own mental menagerie of revelatory encounters in the arts.\n\nThat 1976 production was her second “Glass Menagerie” for Harlequin. Later, she revisited the role for a San Antonio Little Theater production directed by Wayne Elkins, a superb actor and director who died too young, and for a company in Austin. I saw her Amanda again in the 1980s, in Jerry Pilato’s storefront theater on Main Avenue, where the intimacy of the space redoubled the intensity of the experience.\n\nBlase had a wide range, but she owned the role of Amanda like Guy Lombardo owned New Year’s Eve. There will be other Amandas, and wonderful Amandas, but Marianna Blase was the reference standard. Her Amanda wasn’t just a character; it was a whole person, a life.\n\n“It was all acting,” her husband, Bob Blase, said of the role that had seemed so real.\n\n“She said she modeled it after my grandmother, who was an old Southern lady, an old Southern widow.”\n\nBob and Marianna had met in Dallas before she, freshly graduated from the University of Texas, went off to New York to study with Martha Graham and others. She clearly had the talent to make a career in New York, but “she finally made the decision she could act anywhere, and we got married in Dallas in 1955.”\n\nFour years later they moved to San Antonio, where Bob became director of Goodwill Industries. Marianna became a staple, and eventually a legend, on local community stages while maintaining her professional standing with appearances in Equity theaters across Texas and Louisiana.\n\nHer dual career wasn’t entirely kosher. As a member of Actors Equity, she was forbidden to appear in nonunion theaters, and no San Antonio company paid actors enough — if anything at all — to qualify. (The lack of an Equity theater remains a shameful blot on San Antonio’s cultural landscape.)\n\n“She wrote to Actors Equity, and they very obliquely told her not to use her real name,” Bob recalled.\n\nSo, it wasn’t a typo when her name appeared as “Blaze” on local cast lists.\n\nA blaze indeed, still burning after her death on March 14, at age 72.\n\nA memorial celebration of Marianna Blase’s life is to be held at 5 this afternoon in the San Pedro Playhouse.\n\n~mgreenberg@express-news.net\n\nObituary – Express News\n\nMarianna Clore Blase died on Thursday, March 14, 2002 at her home in San Antonio. Her lifelong love of and talent for the theatre was matched only by her devotion to her family. Marianna was born on August 17, 1929 in Evanston, IL, the first child of Rev. Gerald L.

Elkins, Jr., 37, died Sunday morning, March 11, 1990 at his home after an extended illness. Most recently Wayne had been the managing artistic director of San Antonio Little Theatre and directed plays for Harlequin Dinner Theatre, Ft. Sam Playhouse and was a founder of Off-Stage, Inc. Wayne had been involved in theatre for most of his life and directed hundreds of plays. He also founded Texas Stage Company and designed settings and lighting for many productions. His influence on the theatre scene was innovative and unparalleled and will be felt for many years. Wayne is survived by his parents, Carol and Wayne Elkins, Sr., his partner Brad Van Langen, friends, and others touched by his life and work in the theatre. A memorial service will be held Tuesday, March 13, 1990 at 11:00 A.M. at Central Christian Church, 720 N. Main Ave. In lieu of flowers Wayne asked that friends make a contribution to the charity of their choice.\n\nBelow is an article written by Dan Goddard, with corrections by Carol Sowa:\n\nNote from Ms. Sowa: So as not to perpetuate historical inaccuracies, I have taken the liberty of correcting several factual errors in Dan Goddard’s moving tribute to Wayne’s life below, which I am sure others in theatre winced at as I did at the time of publication. As Goddard noted, he did not come on the scene here until later in Wayne’s career, so would not have been familiar with some of the earlier productions.\n\nI was in Wayne’s memorable production of “Romeo & Juliet” for SALT’s Off-Stage, for which Judy Jay was the choreographer and whom Goddard mistakenly referred to as playing Juliet. (Juliet was played by Vana Tribbey.) He also referred to “Shenandoah,” directed by Wayne, as being the first play done at Harlequin Dinner Theatre. It was not. I know because I was in the play that opened Harlequin and it was “Goodbye, Charlie,” directed by Penny Cox Gray (also now deceased).\n\nLastly, he misspelled Marianna Blase’s name as “Blaze” throughout. I have corrected all these errors in the story below. (I did, however, leave in his spelling of “theater.”)\n\n~Carol Sowa\n\nAlso: The Fort Sam Houston Playhouse did not become the Harlequin Dinner Theater, they were separate entities within the army’s music and theater program. ~W. Chris Champlin\n\nThe Sunday Express-News, San Antonio, March 25, 1990\n\nBy Dan R. Goddard – Express-News Arts Writer\n\nWayne Elkins’ life, death touched so many\n\nAt age 19 and the veteran director of 20 plays, including a now legendary production of Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet,” the Express-News declared Wayne Elkins the “boy genius of San Antonio theater.”\n\nYears later, when the boy who grew up in the basement of the San Antonio Little Theater had become its managing artistic director, Elkins liked to wear a T-shirt with a line from “Peter Pan”: “I’ll never, never grow old.”\n\nThe words proved sadly prophetic. Elkins died March 11 at age 37 after a three-year battle with fungal meningitis. His death has forced his friends, family and community to confront the unspeakable.\n\nAt first, Elkins was reluctant to make public the fact that he suffered from AIDS. But in his final months, Elkins talked about his disease in a video that was shown at a benefit for the Human Rights Campaign Fund, the nation’s largest gay, lesbian and AIDS-patients political lobbying organization.\n\nIdentifying himself as a patient with AIDS, Elkins said, “The past two years have been what I can only call an enlightening journey. I’ve learned a lot about myself, people and the value of living. I can’t help but wonder what it costs to keep me alive each day; I imagine the figure would boggle my mind. But I have been fortunate because my insurance company has continued to pay.\n\nHe makes a plea of support for the HRCF, so that “we can finally get a grip on this terrible, terrible disease.” One source said that Elkins’ medical bills topped $2 million.\n\nA good man\n\nElkins concludes with the words of a wise old man: “Tragedy in life is not what evil men do, but very often that good men do nothing.”\n\nThere’s no question Wayne Elkins was a good man. A much admired and generous man, who made many significant contributions to the community he served.\n\nMore than 600 people turned out for his memorial service March 13 at Central Christian Church, including many of the actors, technicians, singers, dancers, designers, costumers and others that Elkins worked with over the years. As a leading San Antonio director since his debut at age 16, Elkins touched the lives of almost everyone connected with theater in the city.\n\n“I think he was better than anybody at finding the right people and getting them to work together and that’s what you need in community theater,” Bill Swinny, a member of the SALT board said. “He had a strong, vibrant personality and a wonderful enthusiasm that just seemed to bring out the best in people. And he could work with all ages, especially children. His loss is a great tragedy for SALT. We’ll never find another one like him.”\n\nHis mentor was Joe Salek, SALT’s longtime managing director. Elkins could have been SALT’s artistic director for as long as he wished.\n\nHe was also the protégé of Carol Lee Klose who introduced him to theater when he was a seventh-grade student at Krueger Junior High School. Klose also taught him for four years at Roosevelt High School, when Elkins became involved in children’s theater at SALT and began directing in the late 1960s.\n\n“When I first saw him, he was a funny kid with braces on his teeth who had been sent down from the art department to help me paint some sets,” Klose recalled. “I think Wayne had a God-given talent to work with the written word. He had an innate sense for how words on paper could take form in theatrical expression.\n\n“He did a tremendous amount of reading and research about theater. Many of the plays he did in the ‘60sand ‘70s, which so many people thought were wildly experimental, were really just a part of many things going on in theater across the country at the time.”\n\nHis “Romeo and Juliet” with a circus setting, which he directed at 19 on the SALT main stage, remains one of his most fondly remembered shows. Judy Jay, who now directs Off-Stage Inc. that Elkins helped found, choreographed the show and remembers Juliet as a member of a trapeze family swinging out over the orchestra pit.\n\n“We went to the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, which was in town at the time, and asked them to help us with the trapezes. We also spent a lot of time at the Hertzberg Museum,” Jay said. “He loved circuses. He even once considered seriously going to clown school. But he was an artist in every sense of the word.\n\n“He had a wealth of talent and he shared it; he was very generous with it. He had the ability to take a lot of medium-talented people and make them look like a million bucks. But we were both known as the “kids in the basement,” and I think it was hard for him to shake that image. I don’t think he always got the consideration out-of-town directors would get. He was kind of taken for granted, but I think he had more talent than just about anyone who has directed in San Antonio.”\n\nElkins did not have any formal training beyond his high school years. He attended San Antonio College for a few months, but he never earned a college degree, something that probably kept him from leaving San Antonio for more lucrative markets. On the other hand, he began working professionally for the Fort Sam Houston Playhouse in his early 20s. As Jay put it, “He learned by doing.”\n\nThe Playhouse eventually became the Harlequin Dinner Theater*, and this is where Elkins did shows such as “Cyrano de Bergerac” with Burdette Parks, “Charley’s Aunt” with Ian McCord, and Steve Ware as Will Rogers. For the Harlequin, Elkins directed a memorable “Shenandoah” starring Frank Christian.\n\n“When I read the script for ‘Shenandoah,’ I thought, oh no, they’re going to kill us. The critics will hate it,” said Bruce Shirky, who is the interim director of Harlequin. “But Wayne Elkins took that script and made it a glorious evening. He was the most talented and gentle person that I have ever known. He did some of the best theater seen in San Antonio. His other passion was art. He could draw anything, and he was a great collector of art.\n\nElkins designed and built sets, finally leaving Fort Sam with Bill Larsen as technical director for the now-defunct Church Theater in the King William Historic District. Elkins eventually directed several shows for the Church Theater, including “Carnival” with a Chagall motif, “A Streetcar Named Desire” starring Magda Porter and a much-respected “The Subject Was Roses” with Dan Laurence, Marianna Blasé and Ware.\n\nTook risks\n\n“Sometimes I think Wayne’s shows sound better in retrospect than they actually were,” Blasé said. “But I’ve gone back and looked at the reviews and they were good reviews. He had his share of disasters, but he wasn’t afraid to take risks. And he could pull off amazing things.”\n\nElkins was also involved in forming a couple of theater companies in the ‘70s. In 1972, he and Laurence, who is well-known as the editor of George Bernard Shaw’s letters, formed Off-Stage Inc. as an offshoot of SALT that would take plays to where the people were: schools, jails, barges on the River Walk. In the mid-’70s he launched his Texas Stage Co. with his other most talked about, if not seen, Shakespearean production, “The Taming of the Shrew” performed on scaffolding in front of the Alamo.\n\nAfter working as a free-lance director for many years, Elkins was finally hired as SALT’s managing director in June 1984. He took over SALT at a low point in the history of the community theater, which has gone through many highs and lows of public support over the years. But Elkins was instrumental in helping to stabilize SALT, reviving the Saltines, renovating the SALT Cellar Theater and, especially, attracting new people and money to the theater.\n\nElkins finally had the stage he most coveted. He opened SALT’s 58th season with “Guys and Dolls,” which introduced Mim Green to San Antonio audiences and had SALT’s current president Byrd Bonner as her grandfather with Andrea Sandifer playing a gum-smacking gun moll.\n\n“No one had ever seen me. I had been in the chorus of one show, but Wayne was willing to take a chance,” Green said. “I think Wayne taught me how to feel childlike on stage and yet never feel stupid. He taught me how to hold my hands while I was singing, and it’s something that I still use.”\n\nSandifer recalled, “”Guys and Dolls” was the first show I ever did with Wayne. I remember about the third week of rehearsal seeing him sitting with some of the people in the chorus discussing their characters, giving them names and personal histories. He took time to take care of the little people. He always did a lot of background research before a production and had a clear vision of what he wanted on stage.”\n\nAnd I believe that my stint as drama critic for the Express-News began with a generally favorable review of “Guys and Dolls.” Elkins’ shows always had a unique spark; he usually managed to come up with memorable images. He understood the importance of stage magic, from using a revolving stage in “Fiddler on the Roof” to using live plants as part of a summery set for my favorite production of his, Paul Osborn’s “Morning’s at Seven.”\n\nElkins handpicked the cast for this 1939 comic drama about four sisters dealing with small town gossip in the 1920s. The cast featured Helen Hogan, Mary Denman, Alice Finney, Rolla Nuckles, Blase, Swinny and Sandifer. You would have to understand something about the egos involved to fully appreciate the miracle of this show, but the women in the cast still get together and have lunch about once a month. Elkins simply had a way of getting the most unlikely people to work together.\n\n“Morning’s at Seven” was a milestone for me,” Denman said. “Wayne took a lot of strong performers and built a real ensemble. He really knew how to match the person with the part. And he inspired great loyalty. His casting was innovative, and he knew how to take raw talent and mold it. I don’t think he was ever really satisfied with his shows. They were never as good as what he could imagine. But he was a creative, insightful director.”\n\nChristmas shows, the bane of most critics’ existence, became something special with Elkins at the helm. Not many directors would think of casting two men, Robert Kislin and John Pollard, as the ugly stepsisters in “Cinderella,” or bringing in Peter Foy, who made Mary Martin fly on Broadway, to make Vivienne Elborne as “Peter Pan” soar at SALT.\n\nPerhaps it’s appropriate that the last show Elkins staged was “Annie.” Holly Imper, the star of the 1987 Christmas show, sang a heartbreaking rendition of “Tomorrow” at Elkins’ memorial service.\n\nElkins finally took an indefinite leave of absence in May 1988. He tried to make a comeback the next fall by directing J.B. Priestley’s “Dangerous Corner,” but was unable to finish. He spent the next 2 and a half; years in and out of hospitals. At the end, he asked to be taken off life-support systems about two weeks before he died\n\nOne friend who talked to him during the last week said, “He was a courageous man. He fought this thing for three years. But he never let it beat him. When I last talked to him, I think he was trying to ask for permission to die, like so many terminal patients will. He said he was ready spiritually to die and I think he was able to make peace with many of the people around him before he died.”\n\nBut not everyone has been able to accept the fact that Elkins died of AIDS. In the video that he made, Elkins said that he had been asked to speak against discrimination toward people with AIDS. Elkins, however, said that he did not feel like he had been discriminated against, even though when he was first hospitalized no one would enter the room without wearing a mask and gloves.\n\nAnother friend noted: “Many AIDS patients die with no one around them. Wayne did not die alone. I think his story is an important lesson for San Antonio because AIDS is robbing us of many of the nation’s artists. Wayne’s death is a terrible thing, but to keep the cause of his death a secret would be an even greater tragedy because the silence only perpetuates the discrimination associated with the disease.”\n\nGoddard’s story mentioned the “heartbreaking” vocal solo by Holly Imper of “Tomorrow” from “Annie” at Wayne’s memorial service on March 13. (“The sun will come out tomorrow…”) Could not help feeling Wayne had “directed” the following then:\n\nExpress-News, San Antonio, Texas, Thursday, March 15, 1990\n\nStorm ends rainy spell for San Antonio, region\n\nBy Loydean Thomas – Express-News Staff Writer\n\nA long rainy spell ended for the San Antonio area Wednesday when a cold front swept the moisture off to the east and cleared the skies for a rare bit of sunshine. …"
