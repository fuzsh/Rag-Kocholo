Jake also extensively covered the Murdaugh family saga in South Carolina, which expanded into a massive web of alleged financial fraud, a picture of privilege and power in the rural South, and a shocking double murder.\n\nJake is originally from Los Angeles, California, and attended school at Fordham University in the Bronx. He got his start in journalism working as a radio reporter at his campus NPR-affiliate station. You can catch Jake on weekends going for runs in Savannah (except in August) and forever in search of good Mexican food. Have a story idea, confidential tip, or want to share your thoughts?
