        "text": "In honor of Data Privacy Day–an international effort to raise awareness and promote privacy and data protection best practices–we offer this fifth edition of Gibson Dunn’s Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Outlook and Review. In 2016, companies, governments, and consumers were again challenged to navigate an evolving landscape of cybersecurity and privacy issues. This year saw flash points impacting the trajectory for data breach litigation, the future for privacy class actions, and the scope of government powers to both regulate data collection practices and gather data itself. Cybersecurity also burst onto the international regulatory and political scene.\n\nAmong other developments, this year the Supreme Court issued its decision in Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, a long-awaited development addressing (somewhat) plaintiffs’ burden to show concrete injury to satisfy Article III standing. Plaintiffs and defendants had argued for years over what allegations are sufficient to show a true privacy harm. While it may not have resolved all the open issues, the Spokeo decision has already been cited over one thousand times.\n\nIn addition, plaintiffs pursued new avenues for litigation opened by new technologies, including the use of biometric information and connected devices, and new theories for established standbys. The year saw a number of resolutions of several closely watched data breach class actions and cybersecurity-related shareholder derivative suits. A number of additional regulatory agencies entered the privacy game, either bringing enforcement actions or issuing privacy/cybersecurity guidance. This year the government also found itself on the other side of the privacy debate, in legal battles over its ability to collect personal information from companies (i) without notice to the subject, and/or (ii) outside the United States. And, of course, EU and U.S. regulators agreed to a new framework for international data transfers–the Privacy Shield–which has already seen its first legal challenges.\n\nWe cover these topics and many more in this year’s Review: (i) civil litigation; (ii) U.S. government regulation of privacy and data security; (iii) U.S. government data collection; and (iv) international developments.

Civil Litigation\n\nA. Standing After Spokeo\n\nIn Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, the Supreme Court considered whether a statutory violation, without resulting “concrete” injury, satisfies the “injury-in-fact” requirement of Article III.[1] On May 16, 2016, the Court issued its much-anticipated ruling: that a plaintiff must suffer an injury in fact that is both particularized and concrete to have standing to sue, and that “a bare procedural violation, divorced from any concrete harm” to the plaintiff, cannot satisfy this injury-in-fact requirement.[2] The decision disapproved of many lower court decisions that deemed an alleged statutory violation as sufficient, on its own, to satisfy the standing requirements of Article III–and thus Spokeo was poised to have broad ramifications across the privacy landscape. In practice, however, lower courts’ interpretation and application of Spokeo has been mixed. While defendants can certainly claim a nominal victory–merely alleging a statutory violation will not necessarily confer standing post-Spokeo–the decision did not provide the clarity that either plaintiffs or defendants had desired.\n\n1. The Spokeo Decision\n\nThomas Robins filed a class action lawsuit against Spokeo, the operator of a “people search engine,” alleging violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (“FCRA”).[3] Robins claimed that Spokeo “willfully failed to comply” with the FCRA because Spokeo generated a profile that contained inaccurate information about him.[4] The district court dismissed the suit for lack of standing on the ground that Robins had not “properly pled” an injury in fact.[5] The Ninth Circuit subsequently reversed, finding that Robins’ allegations were sufficient to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement since “Spokeo [had] violated his statutory rights, not just the statutory rights of other people,” and his “personal interests in the handling of his credit information are individualized rather than collective.”[6]\n\nOn appeal, the Supreme Court found that the Ninth Circuit’s analysis was “incomplete,” because the injury-in-fact element requires a plaintiff to allege that an injury is both particularized and concrete, and the Ninth Circuit had “overlooked” the concrete factor.[7] The Supreme Court accordingly vacated the Ninth Circuit’s opinion and remanded the case to the Ninth Circuit to complete the concrete injury inquiry.[8]\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court did not take a position as to whether Robins had established a concrete injury, it provided guidance on how to conduct the analysis: A concrete injury need not necessarily be “tangible,” but it must be “real” and not merely “abstract” in nature.[9] In determining whether an intangible injury is concrete, the Court noted that it is “instructive” to consider both the “judgment” of Congress, as well as whether the alleged injury “has a close relationship to a harm that has traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit.”[10] At the same time, the Court cautioned that “Congress’ role in identifying and elevating intangible harms does not mean that a plaintiff automatically satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement whenever a statute grants a person a statutory right and purports to sue to vindicate that right.”[11] Put differently, “Article III standing requires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory violation.”[12] The Court also noted that a plaintiff cannot “allege a bare procedural violation, divorced from any concrete harm, and satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III.”[13] The Court found it “difficult to imagine” how dissemination of certain technically inaccurate information (such as an improper zip code), without more, could constitute a sufficiently concrete harm to satisfy standing.[14]\n\n2. Post-Spokeo Standing Decisions in Privacy Cases\n\nIn the months since the Spokeo decision, courts have issued more than one hundred decisions addressing Spokeo’s impact on the question of plaintiffs’ Article III standing in privacy-related cases. The majority of those decisions have been rulings on defendants’ motions to dismiss claims based on the FCRA, Fair Debt Collections Practices Act (“FDCPA”), Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (“FACTA”), and Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”). The majority of those decisions found standing to be sufficiently alleged, but a significant percentage found standing to be lacking. Moreover, courts addressing other privacy-related claims–including the Cable Communications Privacy Act (“CCPA”), the Truth in Lending Act, the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”), and the Electronic Funds Transfer Act–collectively found standing to be insufficiently alleged approximately as often as they found it to be sufficient. Indeed, there are decisions going different ways for almost every legal claim and in each of the key privacy-related factual contexts. Here we briefly address post-Spokeo standing decisions in a number of key privacy-related areas.\n\nData Breach. Both the Sixth and Seventh Circuits issued decisions this year finding that data breach subjects had standing to sue based on alleged fraud-prevention expenses and substantial risk of harm from identity theft.[15] On the other hand, a number of district courts dismissed claims for lack of standing where the threat of future harm from a data breach was too speculative.[16] Yet other courts assessed the standing arguments on a plaintiff-by-plaintiff and injury-by-injury basis, permitting those alleging actual instances of identity theft and dismissing others.[17] In July, the Third Circuit heard oral argument for an appeal wherein plaintiffs argued that the mere statutory violation of the FCRA’s requirement to protect data is sufficient to confer standing and that nefarious data breaches always carry imminent risk of harm and automatically confer standing. Mere days before publication, the court ruled in plaintiffs favor, vacating the lower court’s dismissal.[18]\n\nUnlawful Disclosure. The Third Circuit issued a decision this year finding that plaintiffs alleging unlawful disclosure of legally protected information, specifically web tracking data, in violation of several statutes, including the VPPA, the Wiretap Act, and the Stored Communications Act (“SCA”), alleged a concrete injury sufficient to confer standing.[19] Some district courts used the same reasoning to justify analogous rulings based on allegedly unlawful disclosure under FDCPA,[20] while other district courts reached the same conclusion on more tangible harms (e.g., risk of identity theft) for disclosures allegedly in violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, Cal. Civ. Code § 1790 et seq.[21] However, yet other courts reached the opposite conclusion for disclosures allegedly in violation of FACTA, finding that plaintiffs had alleged insufficient risk of the harm envisioned by Congress.[22]\n\nUnlawful Retention. Unlawful retention cases have trended in defendants’ favor. Courts have found that unlawful retention of data alone–whether an alleged violation of the CCPA, the Biometric Information Privacy Act (“BIPA”), or state analogs to the VPPA–is insufficient to establish standing.[23] In ruling on a motion to dismiss claims under the CCPA, the Eighth Circuit explained that mere retention is a “bare procedural violation.”[24] To sufficiently plead concrete and particularized injury, plaintiffs would have had to identify some improper use of, or harm flowing from, the retention of the information in question.\n\nUnlawful Acquisition/Use. In Matera v. Google Inc., an email scanning case discussed further herein, the Northern District of California ruled that alleged interceptions of communications without consent, in violation of the Wiretap Act and state law analogs, constitute injury in fact sufficient to satisfy standing.[25] However, courts have also found that unlawful acquisition of other types of information–for example, requesting customers’ zip codes in violation of state law–does not automatically confer standing.[26]\n\nTCPA Claims. Rulings in TCPA cases have also gone both ways, but have trended in plaintiffs’ favor, finding that telemarketing activities and unsolicited automated calls prohibited by the statute infringe the precise interests Congress sought to protect, and finding that such allegations are concrete violations of substantive rights and therefore confer standing.[27] Other courts relied on more conventional grounds to reach the same conclusion, allowing plaintiffs to move forward with more tangible, but very minimal, injury.[28] However, some courts have dismissed TCPA cases where the alleged injury was insufficient or not tied to a particular violation.[29]\n\n3. Looking Ahead\n\nThe Supreme Court’s decision to remand the Spokeo case to the Ninth Circuit without addressing the alleged injury in that case provided little guidance concerning what constitutes a concrete injury, leaving ample room for arguments to be made on both sides, as illustrated above.[30] Many feel that, in doing so, the Court created an unpredictable new legal landscape.[31]Spokeo did not provide a bright-line rule squarely prohibiting plaintiffs from suing for intangible injuries (such as the publication of inaccurate information on the internet).[32] However, it has been interpreted to prevent plaintiffs from suing for pure procedural violations and from relying purely on alleged statutory violations, in the absence of actual harm. Spokeo‘s most profound impact thus may be in class actions where plaintiffs seek statutory damages on a class-wide basis without proof that any class members actually suffered actual injury.[33]\n\nIn the oral argument on remand before the Ninth Circuit on December 13, 2016, the parties in Spokeo presented precisely these issues. Plaintiff argued that the court should assess the type of harm alleged, and whether it goes to the concrete interest that Congress intended to protect. Defendant argued that the court must assess the specific harm alleged for the specific plaintiff, and may only find standing to be satisfied if the particular plaintiff has plausibly alleged specific particularized and concrete harm that is traceable to the actual challenged conduct of the defendant. While the decision will not be binding precedent in other circuits, many will be watching to see how the Ninth Circuit interprets the law.\n\nB.Data Breach Litigation\n\nLike 2015, 2016 had its share of massive data breaches. And, again, a global study revealed that both the number and the cost of breaches increased.[34] A report from the California Attorney General reported that from 2012 to 2015, the number of data breaches reported to the California Attorney General also rose from 131 to 178.[35] The trajectory continued in 2016, with a 40% increase in data breaches reported to the New York Attorney General by May.[36] The average data breach cost for U.S. organizations was $7.01 million, a 20% increase since 2014.[37]\n\nAs in previous years, litigation has followed closely on the heels of almost every large breach. Below, we review a number of high-profile breach announcements this year, the litigation that followed, and key developments in ongoing data breach litigation, including important decisions and settlement trends.\n\n1. Litigation\n\na. High-Profile Breaches in 2016\n\nMajor data breaches in 2016 impacted a number of different industries and involved a number of different types of personal information. Hackers targeted customer login information, payment information, and employees’ personal information, among others. In many instances, though not all, litigation quickly followed the announcement of the breach.\n\ni. Election-Related Hacks\n\nIn 2016, the U.S. government publicly blamed Russia for a July cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee.[38] The DNC hack resulted in thousands of internal emails being publicly posted online, including through the website WikiLeaks. In October, emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta began appearing online, and a private security firm attributed the hack to Russian foreign intelligence activity occurring months earlier.[39] Subsequently, the CIA concluded that government-sponsored Russian hackers were responsible for the Podesta hack.[40] U.S. intelligence agencies also concluded that the Russian government additionally attempted to hack the Republican National Committee.[41]\n\nIn late December, President Obama announced sanctions against Russia’s intelligence apparatus, including expelling 35 individuals for spying while posing as diplomatic officials, shutting down two Russian compounds, and sanctions on Russian intelligence agencies, top Russian intelligence officials, and three companies and organizations allegedly involved in the hacking.[42]\n\nii. Login Information\n\nLinkedIn. Professional networking website LinkedIn saw fallout from a previous loss of user login information. LinkedIn disclosed in May 2016 that 100 million usernames and passwords from a 2012 breach had been posted online.[43] In 2015, LinkedIn had settled class action litigation over the breach for $1.25 million.[44]\n\niii. Health Information\n\n21st Century Oncology. Following an October 2015 data breach that allegedly disclosed the sensitive identifying and medical information of 2.2 million patients, 21st Century Oncology, a network of national cancer treatment centers, was hit with numerous class actions starting in March 2016.[45] The MDL Panel consolidated and transferred sixteen cases against 21st Century Oncology to the Middle District of Florida for combined proceedings.[46] Preliminary litigation involving case management and appointment of counsel is ongoing.\n\niv. Payment Information\n\nKimpton. In September, boutique hotel chain Kimpton announced that hackers may have obtained the information from credit and debit cards used in more than 60 of its hotels and restaurants between February and July 2016.[47] After Kimpton’s data breach was announced on September 1, a federal class-action lawsuit followed within a month, alleging breach of implied contract, violation of California unfair business practices laws, and negligence.[48] Kimpton filed a motion to dismiss in December, alleging that the plaintiff’s claims of “increased risk” of identity fraud, “loss of privacy,” and “deprivation of the value of personal information” did not give rise to standing, and also arguing that the plaintiff failed to state a claim for his contractual or state competition law claim.[49]\n\nWendy’s. In January 2016, fast-food restaurant chain Wendy’s notified customers that a malware attacker obtained payment card information from 300 of its stores. In July, Wendy’s revised its announcement to say that there were two malware attacks and they impacted 1,025 stores.[50] Litigation on behalf of a consumer class followed. In July the court dismissed the consumer class action without prejudice for lack of Article III standing.[51] The named plaintiff used his debit card at Wendy’s during January 2016 and subsequently experienced two fraudulent charges, for which his bank reimbursed him.[52] The court found that the plaintiff did not suffer any monetary harm from the unauthorized charges, and therefore could not allege “actual harm sufficient to establish injury-in-fact.”[53] Plaintiff also alleged that he and members of the proposed class were at continuing risk of harm for identity theft and identity fraud, but the court found that the threat of future harm from identity theft is “highly speculative,” and therefore cannot form the basis for standing.[54] Plaintiff filed an amended complaint shortly afterwards, alleging breach of implied contract, negligence, and violations of state consumer protection and data breach notification statutes.[55] Wendy’s again filed a motion to dismiss, which the court has not yet ruled on.[56]\n\nA class of financial institutions also seeks damages for costs associated with cancelling and reissuing cards, notifying consumers of the breaches, refunding fraudulent charges, and increasing their monitoring activity.[57] Plaintiffs alleged causes of action for negligence and negligence per se arising from defendant’s failure to maintain adequate cybersecurity measures in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act.[58] Wendy’s filed a motion to dismiss, alleging plaintiffs failed to state their claims.[59] The motion is fully briefed and pending a ruling.\n\nIn December, a Wendy’s shareholder brought a derivative suit for breach of fiduciary duty, alleging that the board of directors and executive officers failed to protect Wendy’s payment system and did not disclose the data breach until after a report from a third-party security researcher.[60] Wendy’s has not yet responded to the complaint.\n\nv. Law Firms and Business Information\n\nIn March, hackers breached multiple large U.S. law firms, including Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP and Weil Gotshal & Manges.[61] The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and the FBI then investigated whether any of the stolen information had been used for insider training. Although Weil Gotshal declined to comment, Cravath confirmed it had suffered a “limited breach” of its network in 2015 but stated it was not aware of any improper use of the information.[62] In December, three Chinese nationals were indicted for the hack, and prosecutors said the hackers had used the stolen information to commit $4 million in securities fraud.[63] In addition to the federal charges, the SEC filed a parallel civil enforcement action, which included a request to freeze the hackers’ assets.[64]\n\nvi. Employee Information\n\nIn several breaches, employees alleged that their employers, or third parties working at their employers’ behest, compromised the employees’ personal information.\n\nSprouts Farmers Market and Seagate Technology. Sprouts Farmers Market and Seagate Technology faced similar lawsuits alleging that the companies compromised employees’ Form W-2 data by sending it to cybercriminals through a “phishing” scam.[65] The Sprouts case is in the preliminary case management stages following MDL transfer and a consolidated complaint has not yet been filed.[66] The consolidated class action against Seagate, which alleges negligence, breach of implied contract, and breach of California consumer protection law,[67] is currently stayed through the end of January 2017 at the parties’ request.[68]\n\nLamps Plus. Lamps Plus is currently defending a putative class action filed by an employee (Frank Varela) who claimed employees’ data had been exposed through a payroll provider.[69] Plaintiff alleged statutory claims under California’s Consumer Records Act, California’s Unfair Competition Law, the FCRA, and various common law claims.[70] Lamps Plus moved to compel individual arbitration based on an arbitration agreement the employee signed as a condition of employment.[71] Instead, the district court authorized class-wide arbitration (and accordingly dismissed the class action complaint).[72] Lamps Plus appealed to the Ninth Circuit,[73] and additionally moved to stay the class arbitration pending the outcome of its appeal.[74] The district court denied the motion to stay on December 27, 2016.[75] Briefing in the appeal is due in February 2017.[76]\n\nb. Update on Major Data Breach Cases from Prior Years\n\nMany data breach cases from 2015 headed for settlement instead of progressing to resolution on the merits or even to class certification, as discussed in detail in the Settlements section below. However, some cases did have significant rulings before settlement, and others continue to wind their way through the courts.\n\ni. New Litigation in Previous Breaches\n\nSony Pictures Entertainment. After a 2014 cyberattack, Sony employees sued the company for the disclosure of their personal information, and the parties reached a final settlement in April 2016, discussed further below in Section II.B.2.c.[77] In July 2016, Sony found itself the target of another lawsuit related to the same data breach, this time from a movie producer.[78] Possibility Pictures II brought a claim for breach of contract, arguing that Sony breached its distribution agreement by failing to put in place basic cybersecurity measures that would have prevented the breach, and that Sony was responsible for the loss in revenue when the producer’s film was pirated following the breach.[79] Sony filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings, stating that a clause in the distribution agreement requires the breach of contract claims to be settled in arbitration.[80] The court has not yet ruled on whether to require arbitration.\n\nii. Ongoing District Court Litigation\n\nAnthem. In February 2015, Anthem, the nation’s second-largest health insurer, announced that hackers had accessed a database containing approximately 80 million customer records, including names, birthdates, and Social Security numbers.[81] More than 100 breach-related class actions filed against Anthem were consolidated in a single multidistrict litigation in the Northern District of California.[82] In February 2016, the court granted in part and denied in part motions to dismiss plaintiffs’ amended complaint.[83] The court ruled that (1) the loss of “benefit of the bargain” concerning personal information–that plaintiffs’ would not have entrusted their personal information to the insurer if they knew the insurer had “inadequate” safeguards in place–constitutes harm under New York’s General Business Law (GBL), and (2) the loss of value of personally identifiable information is a cognizable economic injury under the GBL.[84] The court also found that California’s Uniform Commercial Law allows plaintiffs to seek restitution for profits that Anthem allegedly gained by providing “lax security measures.”[85] Fact discovery in the case closed on December 1, 2016. The deadline to file for class certification is March 10, 2017.[86]\n\nAshley Madison. Following the 2015 public disclosure of account information from Ashley Madison, a website advertised as a place for married individuals to arrange extramarital liaisons, plaintiffs in the ensuing data breach litigation filed a motion for leave to proceed under pseudonyms,[87] which the court denied in part, finding that the users seeking to serve as class representatives in the multidistrict litigation must be publicly identified.[88] In August 2016, Ashley Madison’s parent organization, Avid, brought a motion to dismiss or to compel arbitration pursuant to the Ashley Madison website terms and conditions.[89] The motion is pending.\n\niii. Appellate Litigation\n\nHorizon Healthcare. The Third Circuit recently considered an appeal of a data breach class action arising from the theft of two laptops containing identifying, demographic, and medical information on almost 840,000 Horizon Healthcare policyholders in 2014.[90] Horizon Healthcare policyholders brought a class action under the FCRA and state law claiming “economic damages and other actual harm,” which was dismissed in 2015 for a lack of standing.[91] The district court found plaintiffs had not shown actual harm as a result of the breach, because they had not suffered actual economic injury, and an increased likelihood of future harm was insufficient to create standing.[92] The plaintiff class appealed to the Third Circuit, arguing that Horizon violated the FCRA’s requirement to protect personal information, and that this statutory violation qualifies as injury-in-fact for Article III standing.[93] Plaintiffs also argued that a “malicious and sophisticated” data breach confers Article III standing on victims, because the nefariousness of the breach means that harm to plaintiffs is imminent.[94] The Third Circuit reversed on January 20, 2017, vacating the dismissal and finding that “[e]ven without evidence that the plaintiffs’ information was in fact used improperly, the alleged disclosure of their personal information created a de facto injury.”[95]\n\nThe Home Depot. Between April 2014 and September 2014, hackers stole the personal and financial information of up to 56 million Home Depot customers.[96] Following this breach, consumers and financial institutions sued Home Depot, and the actions were consolidated through the MDL Panel into a consumer class action and a financial institution class action.[97] The financial institution class members issued and owned compromised payment cards, and alleged negligence, negligence per se, injunctive and declaratory relief, and state statutory violations under Alaska, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Washington laws.[98]\n\nIn May 2016, the court ruled on Home Depot’s motion to dismiss the financial institution class action and allowed nearly all the financial institutions’ claims to proceed.[99] In July, Home Depot sought an order for immediate interlocutory appeal to the Eleventh Circuit of the order refusing to toss the data breach claims.[100] The questions raised on appeal include whether banks have Article III standing to assert claims arising out of a data breach, and whether retailers owe banks a duty to protect against third-party hacks.[101] The district court has not yet ruled on whether to certify the appeal. The parties are currently conducting discovery, and plaintiffs’ motion for certification is due January 30, 2018.[102]\n\nOn August 23, 2016, the court granted final approval of the consumer class action settlement, which is discussed further below in Section II.B.2.a.\n\nc. Decisions in Data Breach Cases in 2016\n\ni. Standing\n\nStanding was a major issue in data breach litigation throughout 2016, especially after May, as courts grappled with the Supreme Court’s decision in Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins.[103] The Seventh Circuit continued its recent trajectory, finding again that data breach victims had standing to sue, and the Sixth Circuit issued a decision following the Seventh Circuit’s example. However, district courts in a number of other circuits dismissed data breach claims where the alleged harm was simply too speculative.\n\nThe Seventh Circuit revived a data breach suit after a lower court dismissed for failure to allege actual injury in Lewert v. P.F. Chang’s China Bistro, Inc.[104] An Illinois district court ruled in 2014 that a proposed class of P.F. Chang’s customers suing the restaurant chain over a data breach could not pursue their breach of implied contract and Illinois consumer protection claims.[105] The lower court held that plaintiffs failed to allege successful fraudulent charges, and stated that “speculation of future harm does not constitute actual injury.”[106] The Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that that the plaintiffs had standing because they alleged spending time and money monitoring their financial information to protect against unauthorized charges and identity theft.[107] In doing so, the Seventh Circuit relied on its July 2015 ruling in Remijas v. Neiman Marcus Group, LLC[108] that customers whose credit card information has been stolen in a data breach have standing to sue not only after they are hit with fraudulent charges, but also for fraud-prevention expenses such as credit monitoring.[109]\n\nThe Sixth Circuit followed suit in Galaria v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company.[110] The lawsuit, claiming invasion of privacy, negligence, bailment, and violations of the FCRA, was brought by consumers after Nationwide experienced a data breach allegedly involving plaintiffs’ personal information.[111] The district court had dismissed plaintiffs’ claims, holding that alleged harms including a heightened risk for fraud and paying for mitigation costs such as credit freezes were not sufficient to establish standing.[112] The Sixth Circuit reversed,[113] holding that plaintiffs’ alleged injury was sufficient under Spokeo, stating that “allegations of a substantial risk of harm, coupled with reasonably incurred mitigation costs, are sufficient to establish a cognizable Article III injury at the pleading stage of the litigation.”[114] The Sixth Circuit further noted that its holding was consistent with the recent Seventh Circuit decisions in Remijas and Lewert.[115]\n\nHowever, at the district court level, judges regularly dismissed data breach complaints because the threat of future harm to consumers was not sufficient to sustain Article III standing. In Khan v. Children’s National Health Systems, the putative class action plaintiff alleged that Children’s had violated Maryland and D.C. consumer protection laws by failing to adequately protect personal data compromised in a breach.[116] The court found that these allegations amounted to “bare procedural harm” under Spokeo, and that because plaintiff “failed to connect” them to a “concrete harm,” she failed to establish standing.[117] In Cox v. Valley Hope Association,[118] the court found that a heightened risk for future identity theft after an unencrypted laptop with personal patient information was stolen was too speculative to constitute concrete harm.[119] Other courts followed similar logic, finding that a continuing risk of harm for identity theft and identity fraud is “highly speculative” and not “certainly impending.”[120] One court ruled that without evidence that stolen information had been used to commit any identify theft, fraud, or another act that resulted in harm to any plaintiff, plaintiffs did not have standing.[121]\n\nAnother district court took a more moderate approach in the In re Zappos.com, Inc.[122] lawsuit, which stems from a 2012 data breach of an online retailer’s servers containing the personally identifying information of approximately 24 million customers. Rather than dismiss the complaint outright, the district court narrowed the multidistrict litigation–dismissing thirteen plaintiffs for lack of Article III standing and dismissing several causes of action–but allowed other plaintiffs leave to amend several claims.[123] The dismissed plaintiffs claimed that their email accounts were “accessed by hackers and used to send unwanted advertisements to people in [their] address book[s]” and that the hackers’ unauthorized access had devalued their personal information, but the court found these claims too conjectural to allege actual injury as required by Article III.[124] However, where plaintiffs alleged instances of actual identity theft and fraud, the court found those allegations sufficient to establish standing.[125]\n\nii. Negligence and the Economic Loss Doctrine\n\nAt the circuit level, the Third Circuit rejected a Pennsylvania data breach class action because Pennsylvania’s economic loss doctrine–which provides that “no cause of action exists for negligence that results solely in economic damages unaccompanied by physical injury or property damage”–barred the suit.[126] Plaintiffs alleged that they had suffered damages in early 2015, when unknown third parties breached Benecard’s computer system and gained access to plaintiffs’ personal and confidential information.[127] Plaintiffs claimed they suffered financial harm when these unknown third parties used plaintiffs’ information to file fraudulent tax returns and the IRS issued tax refunds to the unknown third parties.[128] Because the plaintiffs were “not in contractual privity with Benecard and thus ha[d] no contractual remedy,” they brought claims based on theories of negligence.[129] The Third Circuit ruled that Pennsylvania’s economic loss doctrine, which “generally precludes recovery in negligence actions for injuries which are solely economic,” barred the suit.[130]\n\niii. “Highly Offensive” Invasions of Privacy\n\nA class of Barnes & Noble customers whose credit and debit card information had been compromised in a 2012 incident involving PIN pad terminals were found to have standing, but the court still dismissed the case, finding plaintiffs failed to adequately plead their claims.[131] The court held, among other things, that the personal information disclosed in this case–specifically, payment card information, personal identification numbers, and names–did not qualify as “private facts, the disclosure of which would be highly offensive to a reasonable person” under Illinois law, as required for an invasion of privacy claim.[132]\n\n2. Data Breach Settlements\n\nAs more and more data breach cases are surviving motions to dismiss on standing grounds, one might have expected to see some helpful guidance from the courts on the key issues in data breach cases–cybersecurity safeguards and protocols, breach readiness, quality of remediation, timing and quality of breach notice, causation and quantification of harm, etc. Instead, most major data breach cases have settled on a class-wide basis. This is unsurprising in light of the dynamics that are present in almost every data breach case: data breaches are singular events for the victim company; they attract regulatory attention and bad press; and they have negative reputational and branding impacts for as long as they are remembered.\n\nIn 2016, a number of defendants chose this route and settled major breach cases on a class-wide basis. In particular, three high-profile breaches–Home Depot, Target, and Sony–all were resolved (at least in part) through class-wide settlement. In the Target litigation, both the consumer class and the class of financial institutions ended in settlements. As discussed in further detail below, the components of these settlements are familiar when viewed in the broader context of historical settlements. They consist of funds for class claims for different kinds of losses, credit monitoring services, and reform of security-related practices (including training, disclosures, program design and oversight, as well as vendor management). However, the funds and attorneys’ fees are considerably larger than in previous years. Of perhaps most interest, the Target settlement of financial institution claims provided a window into the allocation of post-breach costs as between the breach-victim merchant on the one hand, and the financial institutions and card networks incurring costs on the other hand.\n\na. Home Depot\n\nAfter a 2014 data breach, plaintiffs brought a class action lawsuit on behalf of approximately 56 million Home Depot customers whose payment or contact information was implicated. The parties fully briefed a motion to dismiss the claims but moved to preliminarily approve a proposed settlement before the court issued an order.[133] On August 23, 2016, Judge Thomas Thrash of the Northern District of Georgia granted final approval of the class action settlement.[134] The settlement requires Home Depot to pay up to $13 million into a fund to compensate class members (up to $10,000 each) for documented out-of-pocket losses and consequential expenses (including time spent remedying issues related to identity theft), $6.5 million to fund 18 months of identity protection services, and to implement certain data security measures in U.S. stores for two years.[135] The required security measures include creation of a security officer position, security assessments and enhanced safeguards, security-related disclosures for customers, employee training, and ensuring that The Home Depot’s vendors maintain similar practices.[136] The court ordered Home Depot to pay $1,000 for each representative plaintiff and $7.536 million in attorneys’ fees.[137] The claims brought against Home Depot by a putative class of financial institutions survived a motion to dismiss,[138] and the parties are currently conducting discovery. The financial institution plaintiffs’ motion for certification is due January 30, 2018.[139]\n\nb. Target\n\nFollowing a 2013 data breach, plaintiffs brought a lawsuit on behalf of approximately 110 million customers of Target Corporation (“Target”) whose payment or contact information was implicated. The parties conducted considerable discovery and settlement negotiations while waiting for a decision on Target’s motion to dismiss.[140] The parties then signed a class-wide settlement agreement less than one month following the court’s decision denying the motion to dismiss in part,[141] and on November 17, 2015, Judge Paul Magnuson of the District of Minnesota granted final approval of the class action settlement.[142] The settlement class included all United States persons whose credit, debit, or personal information was compromised as a result of the data breach. The settlement requires Target to pay $10 million into a fund to compensate class members for out-of-pocket losses and time lost, to pay $6.75 million in attorneys’ fees, and to implement security measures.[143] The security measures include designating a Chief Information Security Officer, maintaining a written information security program, maintaining a process to monitor for and respond to information security events, and security training for employees.[144]\n\nThree objectors and one non-class member appealed to the Eighth Circuit.[145] The district court questioned the merit of the appeals, categorizing some as “professional objectors” and another as a non-class member whose “appeal [was] frivolous.”[146] In Miorelli v. Target Corp.,[147] the Eighth Circuit summarily dismissed the non-class member’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Another objector’s appeal, claiming that the magistrate judge’s opinion stating that the settlement was fair and reasonable violated rules on expert testimony and usurped the role of the court, is still pending.[148]\n\nThe claims on behalf of a class of financial institution plaintiffs against Target developed further, but were also ultimately resolved through a class action settlement. On September 15, 2015, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion to certify the class.[149] On May 12, 2016, Judge Magnuson granted final approval of the class action settlement.[150] The settlement requires Target to pay $20.25 million into a class escrow account on behalf of a class of entities that issued compromised payment cards, $19.1 million directly to fund MasterCard’s Account Data Compromise program,[151] $100,000 total to five representative plaintiffs, and $19.9 million in attorneys’ fees and expenses.[152] The settlement did not provide for any injunctive relief. Separately, Target reached a private settlement with Visa worth up to $67 million over claims that it failed to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent the breach.[153]\n\nc. Sony Pictures Entertainment\n\nAfter a 2014 data breach, individual plaintiffs filed suits against Sony Pictures (“Sony”) that were ultimately consolidated into a class action lawsuit on behalf of current and former employees whose information was compromised.[154] After the court denied in part Sony’s motion to dismiss,[155] plaintiffs’ moved to certify a class, but the parties agreed to a class action settlement agreement before the court ruled on plaintiffs’ motion.[156] On April 6, 2016, Judge R. Gary Klausner in the Central District of California granted final approval of the class action settlement.[157] The settlement class comprises all current and former Sony employees and any individuals whose personally identifiable information was released in the breach.[158] The settlement requires Sony to provide two years of identity theft protection services (in addition to the one year that Sony already provided following the breach), up to $2 million to reimburse expenses and time spent taking preventative measures to prevent identity theft, up to $2.5 million to reimburse loses from identity theft,[159] $33,000 in total service awards, and almost $2.6 million in attorneys’ fees.[160] The settlement did not provide for any injunctive relief.\n\nd. Historical Class-wide Settlements of Data Breach Claims\n\nAs reflected in the chart below, the class-wide data breach settlements this year are, on average, considerably more expensive than prior class-wide settlements. However, they consist of many of the same components as earlier settlements.\n\nThe chart reflects the relevant defendant, the date of final approval of the class-wide settlement, the data type involved in the data breach, the relief provided to the class as part of the settlement, and any fees and costs awarded to class counsel and service awards ordered for class representatives.\n\nDefendant Approval Data Type Relief to the Class Service Awards, Fees, & Costs Home Depot\n\n(Consumer Class)[161] August 23, 2016 Card Data Up to $13 million for class claims; up to $6.5 million for 18 months of credit monitoring services; security practices changes $1,000 for each representative plaintiff; $166,925 in costs; $7.536 million in fees Target (Financial Institution Class)[162] May 12, 2016 Card data Up to $20.25 million for class claims;\n\n$19.108 million to MasterCard\n\nReportedly up to $67 million for Visa’s claims against Target[163]\n\n$20,000 for 5 representative plaintiffs; $2.109 million in costs; $17.8 million in fees Sony[164] April 6, 2016 Login and Personal Information Up to $2 million for preventative losses; up to $2.5 million for claims for identity theft losses; up to two years of credit monitoring services $3,000 for each named plaintiff; $1,000 for each plaintiff who initially filed an action; $2.588 million in fees St. Joseph Health System[165] February 3, 2016 Health Information $7.5 million in cash payment; up to $3 million for class claims; one year of credit monitoring services (offered during remediation); security practice changes $50,000 in incentive payments for class representatives; $7.45 million in fees and costs Target\n\n(Consumer Class)[166] November 17, 2015 Card Data Up to $10 million for claims; security practice changes $1,000 for three deposed plaintiffs; $500 for other plaintiffs; $6.75 million in fees LinkedIn[167] September 15, 2015 Login Information Up to $1.25 million for claims; security practice changes $5,000 for the named plaintiff; $26,609 in costs; $312,500 in fees Adobe[168] August 13, 2015 Voluntary Dismissal Login and Card Data Security practice changes and audit $5,000 to each individual plaintiff; $1.18 million in fees Sony Gaming Networks[169] May 4, 2015 Card Data and Personal Information Up to $1 million for identity theft losses; benefit options including free games and themes or month subscription, unused wallet credits, virtual currency; some small cash payments $2.75 million in fees AvMed[170] February 28, 2014 Personal Information Up to $3 million; security practice changes $5,000 for each representative plaintiff; $750,000 in fees Purchasing Power (Winn-Dixie)[171] October 4, 2013 Personal Information Up to $225,000 for class claims; up to one year of credit monitoring services; security practice changes $3,500 for representative plaintiff; $200,000 in fees CBR Systems[172] July 24, 2013 Health Information Up to $500,000 for claims for expenses; up to $2 million for class claims for identity theft; two years of credit monitoring services; security practice changes $5,000 for representative plaintiff; $14,064 in costs; $585,936 in fees Michaels Stores (Pin Pad Litig.)[173] April 17, 2013 Card Data Up to $800,000 for class claims; up to two years of credit monitoring services; security practice changes $2,500 for each representative plaintiff; $55,565 in costs; $1.2 million in fees Heartland Payment Systems[174] March 20, 2012 Card Data Up to $2.4 million for class claims; security practice changes $35,000 in costs; $606,193 in fees Countrywide[175] August 23, 2010 Personal and Financial Information Up to $5 million for claims for identity theft; up to $1.5 million for claims for expenses; two years of credit monitoring services $500 for each representative plaintiff; $250 for each named\n\nplaintiff; $100,000 in costs; $3.5 million in fees\n\nDep’t of Veterans Affairs[176] September 23, 2009 Personal Information Up to $20 million for class claims $18,000 for representative plaintiffs; $157,076 in costs; $3.6 million in fees Certegy Check Services[177] September 3, 2008 Card Data Up to $4 million for claims for identify theft; up to $1 million for claims for expenses; up to two years of credit monitoring services; security practice changes $500 for some representative plaintiffs; $250 for each other named plaintiff; $2.35 million in costs and fees TJX[178] September 2, 2008 Card Data and Driver’s License Information License replacement cost; up to $1 million for >$60 identity theft; up to $30 in cash; up to three years of credit monitoring services; up to $7 million in vouchers up to $60; one-time 15% discount event; security practice changes $6.5 million in fees\n\n3. Shareholder Derivative Suits\n\nIn recent years, shareholders have sought to pursue derivative lawsuits against corporate directors and officers for breach of fiduciary duty in overseeing corporate security in connection with data breaches. In 2014 and 2015, shareholders brought three such high-profile derivative lawsuits on behalf of Wyndham Worldwide, Target, and Home Depot. The Wyndham suit was dismissed in October 2014, after the district court found that the board’s actions were protected under the business judgment rule.[179] This year, the Target and Home Depot cases were similarly dismissed.\n\nTarget. After shareholders filed a derivative lawsuit in February 2014 in district court in Minnesota, Target’s board of directors established a special litigation committee (“SLC”) to investigate the claims at issue. On July 7, 2016, the court granted the SLC’s unopposed motion to dismiss in reliance on a report issued by the SLC, which concluded that “it [was] not in Target’s best interest to pursue” legal recourse against Target’s directors and officers.[180]\n\nThe Home Depot. Home Depot shareholders filed a derivative lawsuit in September 2015 in district court in Georgia. On November 30, 2016, the court dismissed the action on grounds that shareholders failed to either demand that the board take action or demonstrate that such a demand would have been futile.[181] Since the Home Depot plaintiffs made no demand prior to filing suit, the court turned to the issue of demand futility.[182] To demonstrate demand futility under Delaware law, a plaintiff must plead particularized facts that establish reasonable doubt regarding the ability and willingness of the board to evaluate a demand in a disinterested manner.[183] With regard to plaintiffs’ primary claim for breach of the duty of loyalty, the court found that “[w]hen added to the general demand futility standard, the Plaintiffs essentially need to show with particularized facts beyond a reasonable doubt that a majority of the Board faced substantial liability because it consciously failed to act in the face of a known duty to act.”[184] The court concluded that plaintiffs’ allegations that the board violated this duty by disbanding Home Depot’s infrastructure committee and moving too slowly in addressing the security breach were insufficient to overcome this “incredibly high hurdle.”[185] After arriving at a similar conclusion for the claims for corporate waste[186] and violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act,[187] the court held that plaintiffs’ failure to make a pre-suit demand was not excused, dismissed the case with prejudice, and permitted defendants to recover costs.[188]\n\nWhile a number of additional high-profile data breaches have been announced since the filing of the Wyndham, Target, and Home Depot lawsuits,[189] shareholder derivative litigation has not kept pace with consumer class action litigation. This is likely because shareholders have come to recognize that there are substantial obstacles to proceeding on such claims–as amply demonstrated by the dismissal of the Wyndham, Target, and Home Depot suits at the pleadings stage. However, derivative lawsuits remain a concern for companies in this context. As noted above, in December, a Wendy’s shareholder brought a derivative suit for breach of fiduciary duty, alleging that the board of directors and executive officers failed to protect Wendy’s payment system in connection with a breach.[190] Companies should consider the risks of such lawsuits in connection with a company’s implementation of any data breach response plan.\n\nC. Interceptions and Eavesdropping\n\n1. Email Scanning\n\nAs in past years, 2016 saw major developments in a number of ongoing class action lawsuits alleging that major Silicon Valley technology companies violated state and federal laws by scanning user emails and messages for targeting advertising and other business purposes. Companies operating electronic communications services should continue to monitor these suits, as they are often massive in scope, concern proposed classes including all or many users of a particular service, are predicated on alleged privacy violations that many perceive to be standard industry practices, and address the disclosures that satisfy consent to information collection and use.\n\nCorley v. Google Inc. Further, one novel strategy employed in 2016 was an attempt by four plaintiffs who were members of the putative class in In re Google Inc. Gmail Litigation (where certification was denied) to sue as individuals. Specifically, in Corley v. Google, Inc., four UC Berkeley students sued Google for violations of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (“ECPA”), alleging that Google scanned their college email accounts for Google’s own commercial purposes and without users’ consent.[191] The four plaintiffs then sought to join nearly 900 plaintiffs to the action, but Judge Koh rejected this end-run around certification, noting that whether “[individuals] have consented to the alleged interceptions has been central to this case” and that “both express and implied consent are questions of fact.”[192] Judge Koh held that mass joinder was not appropriate because the claims did not “arise[] out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences.”[193] Therefore, Judge Koh held that if the plaintiffs wished to proceed, they were required to do so via 876 separately filed complaints filed within 45 days.[194] On October 3, 2016, the plaintiffs notified the court that all but two plaintiffs settled their claims with Google and moved to dismiss the claims with prejudice.[195] On October 18, 2016, Judge Koh dismissed the claims of all plaintiffs with prejudice, including the two plaintiffs that failed to settle because they did not file an individual complaint within 45 days of the court’s order.[196]\n\nMatera v. Google Inc. Another case to watch is Matera v. Google, Inc., a case filed in September 2015 related to In re Google Inc. Gmail Litigation. There, the plaintiffs allege that Google’s purported practice of collecting information on non-users violates CIPA and ECPA and, unlike in In re Google Inc. Gmail Litigation, seek both damages and injunctive relief. Because those allegations are related to those in In re Google Inc. Gmail Litigation, the court assigned the case to Judge Koh. On August 12, 2016, Judge Koh denied Google’s motion to dismiss as to the merits of plaintiffs’ claims.[197] Specifically, with respect to the Wiretap Act, the court rejected Google’s “ordinary course of business” argument and denied a motion to certify an interlocutory appeal to the Ninth Circuit on the same issue.[198] Likewise, Judge Koh rejected Google’s arguments that it should decline supplemental jurisdiction over the CIPA claim and that section 631 of CIPA does not apply to email communications.[199]\n\nOn September 23, 2016, after lifting a stay pending the outcome of the Supreme Court’s Spokeo decision, discussed herein supra Section II.A., Judge Koh granted in part and denied in part Google’s motion to dismiss based on lack of standing. Most significantly, Judge Koh concluded that based on “the historical practice of courts recognizing that the unauthorized interception of communication constitutes cognizable injury” and “the judgment of Congress and the California Legislature [that] alleged violations of . . . the Wiretap Act and CIPA constitute injury in fact,” the plaintiffs’ complaint survived Spokeo.[200] However, Judge Koh also held that plaintiffs lacked standing to enjoin Google from engaging in the alleged “intercepting and scanning,” which Google confirmed it had ceased.[201] On November 28, 2016, the parties in Matera requested a stay of the proceedings and announced that they had successfully mediated a resolution of the case and finalized a settlement agreement.[202] The same day, Judge Koh granted the stay and ordered the plaintiffs to file a motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement by December 28, 2016.[203] On December 13, 2016, plaintiffs outlined a settlement consisting of $2.2 million in attorneys’ fees and $0 to members of the class.[204] The settlement also allocated $2,000 for each of the two lead plaintiffs and $123,500 for the work of the settlement administrator.[205] Google agreed to change certain technical aspects of its email processing including “eliminat[ing] any processing of email content that it applies prior to the point when the Gmail user can retrieve the email in his or her mailbox.”[206] Although class members will receive no monetary award under the terms of the proposed settlement, the release “extends solely to claims for declaratory, injunctive and non-monetary equitable relief.”[207] Other than the named representatives, no settlement class member will release any claim for monetary damages under CIPA or ECPA.[208] A hearing on the proposed settlement is scheduled for March 9, 2017.\n\n2. Call Recording\n\nIn recent years, there has been a flurry of lawsuits against businesses for recording customer phone calls without the requisite consent. The recording of telephone conversations is governed by a patchwork of federal and state law. The federal Wiretap Act and most states allow such recordings as long as one party to the conversation–including the one doing the recording–consents to the recording.[209] Eleven states arguably require the consent of all parties to the call.[210] One of these all-party consent states is California, which has become the locus of call recording litigation.\n\nDuring 2016, courts continued to clarify the contours of California’s call recording laws, found in the California Invasion of Privacy Act (“CIPA”), California Penal Code § 630, et seq.[211] The statute now has potentially nationwide reach, as courts reinforced a 2011 Northern District of California holding that non-California plaintiffs can assert claims against a California defendant where the alleged violations occurred in California.[212]\n\nOn the class certification front, the court in Saulsberry v. Meridian Financial Services, Inc., continued the trend in declining to certify section 632 classes because “a consumer’s objectively reasonable expectation regarding the confidentiality of the call depends on a great variety of individual circumstances, such as the individual’s knowledge of the defendant’s recording practices, or prior consent to the recording of the calls.”[213] Section 632.7 does not include the “confidential communication” requirement that section 632 does, and thus there may be greater opportunities for class-wide litigation under section 632.7.[214]\n\nHowever, section 632.7 is not without its own potential limitations. The court in Carrese v. Yes Online Inc. added its weight to an intra-circuit split among district courts over whether section 632.7 can only be enforced against third parties who “intercept or receive” the communication without consent.[215] Most district courts in the Ninth Circuit, including the court in Carrese, “have found section 632.7 applies both to parties of a communication as well as third parties.”[216]\n\nAnother issue addressed in 2016 related to whether the statutory award of $5,000 was intended as a per violation award, or a per action award.[217] The court in Granina v. Eddie Bauer agreed with the weight of authority that damages are per violation, although it “strongly support[ed] an appellate decision clarifying this issue.”[218]\n\nSeveral notable settlements were reached in 2016 over alleged CIPA violations. For example, Wyndham International Inc. agreed in October to pay $7.3 million to settle class allegations that the hotel chain recorded customers’ calls to the hotel’s toll-free reservations hotline without notice that their calls would be recorded and without consent.[219] And, in August, HSBC Card Services Inc. agreed to a $13 million deal to settle three consolidated class actions alleging unlawful recording of debt-collection calls.[220]\n\nIn the public arena, the California Attorney General continued to aggressively enforce CIPA. In 2015, the California AG reached a settlement with Houzz Inc., an online platform for home remodeling and design, for alleged violations of CIPA.[221] It required Houzz to appoint a Chief Privacy Officer to oversee compliance.[222] In 2016 the AG reached a similar deal with a large financial institution, which required not only payment of penalties, but also a compliance program and designation of an individual to serve in a compliance oversight capacity.[223]\n\nAnother active area of call recording litigation involves the recording of inmate phone calls. In Romero v. Securus Technologies, Inc., two former inmates and a criminal defense attorney, all of whom used Securus’s telephone systems to make calls from California correctional facilities, sued Securus for secretly recording multiple attorney-client calls.[224] The plaintiffs alleged violations of section 636 of CIPA,[225] which prohibits recording, without all-party consent, conversations between “a person who is in physical custody of a law enforcement officer . . . or who is on the property of a law enforcement agency or other public agency, and the person’s attorney.”[226] On a motion to dismiss, the court dismissed various common law claims in the complaint but allowed the CIPA and unfair competition claims to advance.[227] In addition, the court drew a distinction between section 636, which does not require a showing that the communications were confidential, and section 632, which does, in rejecting the defendant’s motion to strike the class allegations due to the supposed individualized inquiry that a section 636 confidentiality analysis would entail.[228] Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on November 7, and Securus moved to dismiss on November 25.[229]\n\nA similar suit against Securus for recording attorney-client conversations and disclosing those conversations to prosecutors, in violation of the federal and Texas wiretap acts, was settled in March 2016.[230] As part of the settlement, attorneys will be entitled to register their phone numbers on a “do not record” list that will maintain the confidentiality of their communications with clients who are in jail.[231] Securus was also recently sued by former NFL player Aaron Hernandez, who is serving a sentence for murder and facing trial on separate charges in Massachusetts. In a federal complaint, Hernandez alleged, among other causes of action, that Securus violated Massachusetts privacy law when recordings it had made of Hernandez’s jailhouse phone calls were placed on an “unsecure electronic database” that was subsequently breached.[232]\n\n3. Other “Interceptions”\n\nEmails and telephone calls are not the only information that can be intercepted, and plaintiffs are increasingly bringing lawsuits based on the interception and collection of other types of information. These types of actions are now winding their way through the court system, and several saw important developments in 2016. The Sixth Circuit also issued a ruling that could expand liability to include actions taken by users of a defendant’s products.\n\nRaney v. Twitter, Inc. In Raney v. Twitter, Inc., plaintiff brought a putative class action against Twitter alleging that Twitter read its users’ direct messages and replaced hyperlinks within the messages with its own custom links.[233] Plaintiff brought claims for violations of ECPA and state privacy statutes, and invasion of privacy. After Twitter filed a motion to dismiss explaining that it scans the links stored on its servers, but not while the messages are in “transit” (as required for liability under the ECPA), plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the suit.[234]\n\nAudio Beacon Cases. In the latest twist on theories of “interception,” several professional sports teams have been hit with lawsuits alleging that their team apps illegally spy on fans using “beacon” technology. In a lawsuit against the NBA’s Golden State Warriors, plaintiffs alleged that the team’s app employs “beacons,” which allow users to receive promotions on their phones based on their location whenever the phone detects an audio signal emitted by a “beacon.”[235] According to plaintiffs, this beacon technology records and monitors conversations in violation of the Wiretap Act, even when a user’s phone is turned off, a claim that the Warriors have flatly denied.[236] In October, the NFL’s Indianapolis Colts were hit with a similar lawsuit, again premised on beacon technology that allegedly listens to fans’ conversations when activated.[237]\n\nLuis v. Zang. In a consequential decision for companies that create software or hardware that can be used to intercept communications, the Sixth Circuit held that a software manufacturer could be directly liable for interceptions accomplished with the company’s software under federal and state wiretap laws. In Luis v. Zang, a suspicious husband surreptitiously installed a product known as “WebWatcher” to monitor his wife’s online communications with another man.[238] The software allegedly intercepted “all PC activity including emails, IMs, websites visited, web searches, Facebook/MySpace activity, and anything typed in real time.”[239] The Sixth Circuit first held that the maker of WebWatcher–Awareness Technologies, Inc.–could be liable for manufacturing, marketing, selling, or operating a wiretapping device in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2512(1)(b), which creates liability for manufacturers of devices that are “primarily useful for the purpose of . . . surreptitious interception.”[240] But the court did not stop there. Whereas the district court had held that only the disgruntled husband could be liable for the interceptions themselves, the Sixth Circuit reversed and held that Awareness could also be liable for the “interceptions,” because the software “automatically acquires and transmits communications to servers that Awareness owns and maintains” without “any active input from the user.”[241] In so holding, the Sixth Circuit may have opened the door to more expansive liability for companies whose products are used for illegal interceptions.\n\nD. Telephone Consumer Protection Act\n\nThe TCPA[242] continued to be a popular statute for the plaintiff’s bar in 2016. Part of this is likely attributable to the statute’s provision of statutory damages in the range of $500 to $1,500 per violation. But another possible factor is a plaintiff-friendly 2015 FCC omnibus order that, among other things, defined an autodialer to include any equipment with the “potential ability” to store or produce telephone numbers to be called and to call those numbers–not solely equipment with the current capability to do this.[243] The omnibus order also made clear that separating the equipment that stores the number from the equipment dialing the number, even in different organizations, may not suffice to avoid the TCPA’s applicability.[244] The omnibus order also changed the way that a consumer can revoke consent: now, not only may “a called party . . . revoke consent at any time and through any reasonable means” but “[a] caller may not limit the manner in which revocation [of consent] may occur.”[245]\n\nThe FCC’s 2015 order drew significant fire, and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is currently weighing a closely-watched appeal that will determine the order’s continued viability. While the D.C. Circuit has yet to rule on the appeal, it heard oral argument on October 19, 2016.[246] During oral argument the petitioners–including debt collector trade group ACA International, the company Salesforce.com, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce–argued that the FCC’s vague definition of what amounts to an autodialer encompasses all modern smartphones, which theoretically have the ability to download an application that allows for autodialer-like features. Petitioners’ argument on this point may have had traction, as during the hearing the three judge panel pushed back and questioned whether the purported expansion of the autodialer definition went beyond the FCC’s power. The FCC denied this, arguing that the statute itself is ambiguous at best, and that the FCC has the authority to interpret the language in a reasonable manner.\n\nWith this appeal still pending, litigants and district courts have grappled with how to proceed in TCPA litigation. Some courts have elected to stay TCPA cases pending the D.C. Circuit’s decision on the grounds that defendants seeking a stay could face difficulties during discovery because, for instance, of the unclear distinction between “potential” and “theoretical” capacity in the definition of an autodialer. But other courts have elected to proceed, reasoning that the delay imposed by a stay could turn out to be indefinite if the D.C. Circuit’s ruling is ultimately appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.[247]\n\nCourts in 2016 also navigated the impact that the Supreme Court’s ruling regarding standing in Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins has in TCPA actions.[248] In Spokeo, the Court held that a plaintiff cannot “automatically satisf[y] the injury-in-fact requirement whenever a statute grants a person a statutory right and purports to authorize that person to sue to vindicate that right.”[249] For the most part, post-Spokeo TCPA decisions seem willing to allow plaintiffs to move forward even with a showing of minimal injury. For instance, courts have found that allegations regarding a plaintiff’s time spent answering or addressing robocalls, a plaintiff’s telephone line being rendered unavailable as a result of a robocall, or even the depletion of a cellular telephone’s battery, were all sufficient to meet Spokeo‘s concrete injury requirement.[250] On the other hand, courts have dismissed TCPA cases for lack of standing where the alleged injury could not be connected to a particular violation of the TCPA.[251] In short, post-Spokeo plaintiffs must generally allege some minimal injury to themselves or their affected devices resulting from a defendant’s alleged TCPA violations.\n\nThis year also saw what may be the largest TCPA settlement in history. The parties in Aranda v. Caribbean Cruise Line, Inc. agreed to a settlement with a common fund of at least $56 million–and up to $76 million–to end litigation that has been pending since 2012.[252] The Aranda settlement would allocate a maximum of $500 per call to class members (recipients of the defendant’s 900,000 illegal robocalls), although the ultimate amount will be determined based on the size of the settlement fund and the number of claimants.[253] The settlement was reached after the court granted class certification in August 2014, denied a motion to decertify the class, and granted partial summary judgment to plaintiffs, holding that the calls at issue violated the TCPA. The Aranda court granted preliminary approval of the settlement in October 2016; it is expected to decide on final approval in February 2017.[254]\n\nThe future of TCPA litigation in 2017 likely will be impacted by the D.C. Circuit’s decision as to the omnibus order, and marked by courts continuing to determine the applicability and limits of Spokeo. Finally, with a new administration change, and new FCC Chair, the contours of TCPA litigation also are likely to be marked by any new omnibus orders the FCC may issue interpreting the TCPA.\n\nE. Video Privacy Protection Act\n\nIn 2016, courts continued to grapple with the contours of the VPPA,[255] which passed in 1988 in response to a D.C. newspaper’s attempt to embarrass Judge Robert Bork during his Supreme Court nomination hearings by publishing his video store rental records.[256] As in recent years, courts in 2016 often came to differing conclusions when applying the VPPA to modern technologies that did not exist at the law’s inception, and plaintiffs continued to exploit these ambiguities because the stakes of violating the VPPA are high. Indeed, the law provides a minimum $2,500 per-person in statutory damages (as well as attorneys’ fees) when “video tape service providers” “knowingly” disclose “personally identifiable information concerning any consumer” to third parties, with certain limited exceptions.[257]\n\nCourts also continued to disagree about who is a “subscriber,” and thus a “consumer,” under the VPPA, with at least one appeals court endorsing a much broader interpretation of the term than in years past. The VPPA defines a “consumer” as “any renter, purchaser or subscriber of goods or services from a video tape service provider.”[258] Last year, in Ellis v. Cartoon Network, the Eleventh Circuit held that “downloading an app for free and using it to view content at no cost is not enough to make a user of the app a ‘subscriber'” under the VPPA.[259] The appeals court found that there was no “ongoing commitment or relationship between the user and the entity” sufficient to make the plaintiff a “subscriber” because the plaintiff had not established a Cartoon Network account or profile, provided any “personally identifiable information” to Cartoon Network, paid for the app, or signed up for any periodic “services or transmissions” or access to exclusive content. Id.[260] Rejecting the Eleventh Circuit’s interpretation of the term, the First Circuit held in Yershov v. Gannett Satellite Information Network Inc. in September 2016 that an individual who merely downloaded a free mobile app and watched free video clips was a “subscriber” under the VPPA.[261] Following the reasoning in Ellis, the lower court dismissed the suit in May 2015 on the grounds that the plaintiff’s mere use of a free mobile app did not make him a “subscriber,” as he had not paid any money, registered any information, or received a delivery to access the app. On appeal, the First Circuit held that a monetary payment is not a necessary condition to be a “subscriber” under the VPPA, further reasoning that in downloading the app and providing “personally identifiable information” in the form of device ID and GPS coordinates, the plaintiff was “not free of a commitment to provide consideration in the form of that information.”[262]\n\nFurther, in affirming the lower court’s finding that device ID and GPS coordinates constitute “personally identifiable information” under the VPPA, the First Circuit also departed from several other courts in concluding that “personally identifiable information” is not simply limited to “information that explicitly names a person.”[263] The First Circuit remanded the case, and the district court was charged with deciding whether the plaintiff had sufficiently pled his injuries to continue his case under the Supreme Court’s recent Spokeo ruling. The district court ultimately denied the defendant’s motion to dismiss, ruling that “the intangible harm allegedly suffered by [the plaintiff] from Gannett’s alleged disclosure of his [personally identifiable information] is a concrete injury in fact.”[264]\n\nCourts addressed the First Circuit’s reasoning in Gannett in subsequent VPPA cases. For example, in June 2016, the Third Circuit held that the VPPA’s prohibition on the disclosure of “personally identifiable information” applies only to the kind of information that would readily permit an ordinary person to identify a specific individual’s video-watching behavior–and accordingly, “static digital identifiers” such as IP addresses, and browser and operating system settings, are outside the purview of “personally identifiable information” under the VPPA.[265] However, the appeals court insisted that its decision does not create a split with the definition endorsed in Gannett and stressed that it intended to “articulate a more general framework” rather than establish a sweeping, broadly applicable rule “given the rapid pace of technological change in our digital era.”[266] However, the Third Circuit explicitly punted the question of what other kinds of disclosures can trigger liability under the statute to “another day” and cautioned that “companies in the business of streaming digital video are well advised to think carefully about customer notice and consent” while such issues get sorted out.[267]\n\nThe Eleventh Circuit now has an opportunity to embrace or reject the reasoning in Gannett in a VPPA appeal that is currently pending. In Perry v. Cable News Network, a federal district court in Atlanta embraced Ellis‘s reasoning and dismissed the action on the grounds that the plaintiff was not a “consumer” under the VPPA where there was “no indication that he had any ongoing commitment or relationship with defendants, such that he could not simply delete the CNN App without consequences.”[268] The defendant maintains that Ellis mandates dismissal because the data it allegedly sent out–a random device identifier–was not “personally identifying,” and that the Gannett case was an “outlier lacking any meaningful limiting principle.”[269] This is an appeal to watch.\n\nAdditionally, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Spokeo decision, discussed above in Section II.A.1., courts have continued to address plaintiffs’ standing to bring claims under the VPPA and its state-law analogs. For example, a New York federal judge rejected Conde Nast’s motion to dismiss a suit brought under Michigan’s state law analog to the VPPA (the Michigan Preservation of Personal Privacy Act) for lack of Article III standing. As in the Gannett case discussed above, the court noted that Spokeo provides that “‘concrete’ doesn’t necessarily mean ‘tangible,'” and that “intangible injuries can . . . be concrete,” and it rejected the argument that the plaintiff pled only a “harmless procedural violation” in alleging that her personal information was unlawfully disclosed and used as a result of Conde Nast’s practices.[270] Critically, the court cited several recent VPPA cases in noting that “all courts to consider the question, including this one, have concluded–both pre-and post-Spokeo–that consumers alleging that a defendant violated the VPPA by ‘knowingly disclos[ing] their [personally identifiable information] to a third party without their consent have satisfied the concreteness requirement for Article III standing.'”[271] The court also noted that “post-Spokeo VPPA decisions recognized that Congress may elevate an otherwise non-actionable invasion of privacy into a concrete, legally cognizable injury,” and that the harms contemplated by both the VPPA and the Michigan Preservation of Personal Privacy Act “have close ties to those recognized by the common law tort of invasion of privacy.”[272] Accordingly, the court found that the plaintiff sufficiently alleged a “concrete, if hard to measure, intrusion on protected privacy interests.”[273]\n\nF. California’s Song-Beverly Credit Card Act and Point-of-Service Data Collection\n\nIn 2016, plaintiffs and defendants alike used novel strategies in contending with recent court decisions that limited the scope of California’s Song-Beverly Credit Card Act of 1971 (“Song-Beverly”),[274] which prohibits merchants from requesting or requiring a customer’s personal identification information as a condition of accepting a credit card payment. Recent decisions narrowing Song-Beverly’s reach have been deeply felt because, limited statutory exceptions notwithstanding, the prohibitory language of the law sweeps broadly, and those found in violation face civil penalties of up to $250 for the first violation and up to $1,000 for subsequent violations.[275]\n\nIn 2016, some plaintiffs pressed courts to focus not on the precise timing of a merchant’s request for a customer’s personal information, but to instead look more broadly at whether the customer reasonably understood that the request was optional in determining whether it was a condition of the transaction under Song-Beverly. Such a test would arguably circumvent a controlling, bright-line test established in 2015 by a California appellate court that provides that a brick-and mortar retailer does not violate Song-Beverly by requesting email addresses after credit card transactions are concluded because customers cannot reasonably believe that providing such information is a “condition of acceptance of the credit card.”[276] For example, in October 2016, a plaintiff filed a notice of appeal of a trial victory granted by a San Diego County judge to Urban Outfitters in August 2016 on the basis that the collected ZIP code information was not a condition of payment under Song-Beverly since cashiers were only prompted to request such information from customers after the credit card had been swiped, approved, and signed for.[277] The plaintiff’s counsel has asserted that the plaintiff intends to argue on appeal that a Song-Beverly violation should only be found if any reasonable consumer could believe the information is required as a condition of payment.[278] Relatedly, in a suit that was dismissed after the parties reached a non-public settlement, the plaintiff’s complaint focused not on the timing of the request for personal information, but on allegations that he “reasonably believ[ed] that he was required to provide the requested information to complete the transaction.”[279] Whether courts will embrace this standard favored by plaintiffs remains to be seen.\n\nBoth plaintiffs and defendants in 2016 also invoked the Supreme Court’s Spokeo v. Robins decision in challenging the standing of plaintiffs alleging Song-Beverly violations. Most notably, in October 2016, in Fraser v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California rejected Wal-Mart’s argument that Spokeo required dismissal of a class action accusing the retailer of unlawfully collecting shoppers’ ZIP codes because the suit alleges only a single procedural violation of Song-Beverly, holding instead that consumers’ alleged exposure to “undesired marketing contact” and the real risk of identity theft constituted sufficient concrete harm to confer Article III standing.[280] In another interesting case, a plaintiff in Medellin v. Ikea U.S. West Incorp. invoked Spokeo and its progeny in her bid for the Ninth Circuit to dismiss her Song-Beverly appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and direct the district court to remand the matter to state court.[281] There, the plaintiff argued that her case is similar to the D.C. Circuit’s recent decision in Hancock v. Urban Outfitters, Inc.,[282] which acknowledged the plaintiff lacked Article III standing under Spokeo because he merely alleged a “bare violation of the law without more,” and the lower court never had jurisdiction to hear the suit in the first place. In Medellin, Ikea countered that the plaintiff alleged the concrete harm necessary to proceed with her appeal by asserting that collecting customers’ ZIP codes subjected them to increased risk of identity theft, fraud, and invasions of privacy. On January 13, 2017, the Ninth Circuit–in an unpublished order–vacated the district court’s judgment and remanded with instructions that the district court dismiss the action without prejudice for lack of standing, on the grounds that a plaintiff cannot “allege a bare procedural violation, divorced from any concrete harm, and satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III.”[283]\n\nFinally, the full implications of the Ninth Circuit’s landmark December 2015 ruling in Big 5 Sporting Goods remains to be seen. In Big 5, consumers filed eleven class action suits alleging that Big 5 infringed on privacy rights by requesting, recording, and publishing customer ZIP codes during credit card transactions in violation of Song-Beverly.[284] Big 5 subsequently sued its insurers after they refused to provide it with a defense against the lawsuits.[285] The Ninth Circuit affirmed a grant of summary judgment to the insurers, and, like the Third Circuit three months earlier in OneBeacon America Insurance Co. v. Urban Outfitters Inc.,[286] held that the “statutory violation” exclusions in general liability insurance policies barred “personal and advertising injury” coverage for underlying allegations of unlawful ZIP code collection.[287] In other words, insurers have no duty to defend their insured against underlying claims that they infringed on privacy rights in violation of Song-Beverly. The Ninth Circuit further held that the policy exclusion precluded the duty to defend even where an underlying action alleges common law violations of invasion of privacy, since California does not recognize any common law or constitutional privacy causes of action for “garden variety ZIP Code cases like this.”[288]\n\nWhile courts did not address the effect of Big 5 on ZIP code coverage suits under Song-Beverly in 2016, the decision may play a key role in determining whether retailers may look to their insurers to cover costs stemming from defense of Song-Beverly actions. Already, at least one insurer has cited Big 5 in an appeal of a data privacy suit alleging a different statutory violation.[289]\n\nG. Biometric Information Privacy Acts\n\nLitigation centered on biometrics became increasingly common in 2016. This is in part because companies are increasingly relying on biometrics–distinctive physiological characteristics, such as fingerprint, hand or face geometry, retina scans, or voice patterns–to authenticate an individual’s identity, or otherwise integrating them into everyday services such as photo-sharing websites. But because biometrics are biologically unique, they also present particular concerns. For instance, if a person’s social security number is compromised, it can be changed. Biometrics cannot.\n\nRecognizing this risk, some states have started regulating the collection, use, and storage of biometric information. Several states have introduced biometric legislation,[290] but only two states have enacted laws. Illinois has passed BIPA,[291] followed shortly thereafter by Texas’s biometric protection law, the Texas Business and Commerce Code Section 503.001.[292] However, only Illinois’ law has a private right of action. Key components of BIPA include its requirements that private companies obtain informed written consent prior to collecting a person’s biometric identifier or information, and meet certain protection obligations and retention guidelines.[293] Significantly, BIPA also permits the recovery of damages of up to $5,000 per violation.[294]\n\nBIPA has recently become a magnet for the plaintiffs’ bar, with putative class actions filed against companies such as Facebook, Google, Snapchat, and Shutterfly based on those companies’ uses of facial recognition technology.[295] In each of these suits, the crux of the allegations was the same: the defendant allegedly failed to obtain the plaintiff’s informed consent before scanning the plaintiff’s face after his or her image was uploaded to the company’s photo-sharing platform, and failed to adhere to BIPA’s requirements relating to the disclosure and destruction of biometric identifiers. The defendants in most of these cases have taken the position that, because the biometrics they collect come solely from photographs, BIPA does not apply.[296] This is because, although BIPA’s statutory language states that scans of “hand or face geometry” are biometric identifiers, it also expressly provides that “photographs” are not.\n\nOne decision on this issue is a 2016 order denying a motion to dismiss in a putative class action pending against Facebook in the Northern District of California. In In re Facebook Biometric Information Privacy Litigation, plaintiffs allege Facebook’s photograph tagging suggestion feature, which uses facial recognition to analyze photos uploaded by users and “suggests” which of the user’s Facebook friends is pictured, violates BIPA.[297] In its motion to dismiss, Facebook argued that, because its facial recognition technology is used to analyze photographs uploaded to its service, after which data derived from those photographs is used to offer tagging suggestions, it falls within the exception to BIPA for photographs and information derived from them.[298] U.S. District Court Judge Donato disagreed, interpreting the statute’s use of the term “photographs” as meaning “paper prints of photographs, not digitized images stored as a computer file and uploaded to the Internet” (although he did not offer a statutory basis for this interpretation).[299] It remains to be seen whether other courts will follow this interpretation of BIPA.\n\nIn addition, defendants in BIPA litigation may have new hope after the U.S. Supreme Court’s May 16, 2016 decision in Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins,[300] which further clarified the injury-in-fact component of the Article III standing requirements. In one of the only decisions applying Spokeo to BIPA to-date, McCullough v. Smarte Carte, Inc., the Northern District of Illinois recently dismissed a BIPA action for lack of standing, emphasizing the necessity of a “concrete and particularized injury” as articulated in Spokeo.[301] The McCullough plaintiff alleged that a locker rental company violated BIPA by retaining her fingerprint without written consent. While acknowledging that the defendant technically violated BIPA, the court–relying on Spokeo–found the plaintiff failed to allege any harm that resulted from the violation and held that such a “bare procedural violation … cannot satisfy Article III standing.”[302]\n\nThe McCullough decision represents not only a deterrent to prospective BIPA plaintiffs going forward, but also a potential turning point in pending BIPA litigation. Indeed, Facebook recently filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on Spokeo in In re Facebook Biometric Information Privacy Litigation, although the district court there has not yet issued a decision. Another case to watch on the issue of facial recognition technology and standing under Spokeo is Vigil et al. v. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc., a class action filed in October 2015 in New York against video game company Take-Two Interactive over a face-scanning feature in its basketball games that allows players to create an in-game character with the player’s likeness.[303] Plaintiffs there contended that Take-Two never obtained their written consent before disseminating the information it gathered through the feature, but Take-Two countered that the lawsuit misuses BIPA to attack a feature that permits a player to create a cartoon-like in-game character that may or may not actually look like the player.[304] Plaintiffs were permitted to submit a second amended complaint following the Spokeo ruling, and Take-Two filed a motion to dismiss arguing plaintiffs had not alleged harm sufficient to meet Spokeo‘s “concrete and particularized injury” requirement.[305] The district court has yet to rule on Take-Two’s motion to dismiss. A similar motion to dismiss based on Spokeo is pending in at least one other BIPA lawsuit.[306] Once decided, these cases could help determine the course of future BIPA litigation.\n\nH. Internet of Things and Device Hacking\n\nThe Internet of Things (“IoT”) is continuously growing as traditionally “dumb” devices are transformed into connected and smart devices. No longer is IoT limited to smart phones and webcams; today, IoT also includes medical devices, routers, lighting, heating, and self-driving cars. Throughout 2016 there was an increase in regulatory and private actions and additional guidance from regulators related to IoT corresponding with this growth.\n\nRouters, Cloud Storage, and Connected Cameras. On February 23, 2016, ASUSTeK Computer Inc., a Taiwanese router manufacturer, agreed to a proposed consent order to resolve the FTC’s probe into claims that security flaws in both the router and “cloud” storage services left users’ personal information vulnerable to hackers and viruses.[307] The order required that ASUSTeK refrain from misrepresenting the security of its routers, establish and implement a comprehensive security program, provide consumers an opportunity to register for direct security notifications, and notify consumers directly of any software updates.[308] The FTC stated that this order was unique in its requirement that ASUSTeK offer consumers a way to register to receive security notices through direct communication, like email, text message, or push notification, therein providing a form of notification that goes beyond a posting on the manufacturer website that might go unnoticed by consumers.[309] Moreover, the registration for this type of notification must not be dependent upon or default to an agreement to receive non-security-related notifications, such as advertising.[310]\n\nJust this month, on January 5, 2017, the FTC sued D-Link, a provider of wireless routers and IP-connected cameras, in the Northern District of California for violations of the FTC Act.[311] The FTC alleges that D-Link advertises its routers and cameras as containing “Advanced Network Security,” but that flaws in D-Link’s security allow hackers to easily access consumers’ information and cameras.[312] The complaint further alleges that these security vulnerabilities put consumers at risk of harm by, for example, re-directing consumers “seeking a legitimate financial site to a spoofed website, where they would unwittingly provide the attacker with sensitive financial account information,” by obtaining financial documents, such as tax returns, “stored on the router’s attached storage device,” or by using a compromised connected camera to monitor consumers’ whereabouts.[313] The complaint against D-Link alleges one count of unfairness relating to D-Link’s failure to secure consumer’s information and five counts of misrepresentation relating to D-Link’s advertising and statements that its routers and internet cameras are secure.[314] An initial case management statement is due by March 30, 2017.[315]\n\nConnected and Autonomous Automobiles. In November 2015, in Cahen v. Toyota Motor Corp., U.S. District Judge Orrick granted defendant car manufacturers Toyota, Ford, and General Motors’ motions to dismiss a class action complaint alleging, among other claims, that the vehicles’ computers were vulnerable to hacking and privacy violations related to their computer software.[316] Plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit, arguing that the district court erred in holding that plaintiffs failed to establish standing to assert their claims.[317] The parties completed briefing on November 9, 2016, but oral argument has not yet been scheduled.[318]\n\nAnother federal district case was filed after Chrysler and Harmon International Industries voluntarily recalled their vehicles because the vehicle computer system (uConnect) had design vulnerabilities that could allow hackers to take remote control of the vehicle’s functions.[319] In Flynn v. FCA US LLC, plaintiffs alleged that these vulnerabilities violated the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and Michigan, Illinois, and Missouri state laws.[320] In September 2016, Chief Judge Reagan rejected plaintiffs’ standing theory based on risk of harm or a fear of risk of harm that a future car hacking could injure or kill them,[321] but accepted their theory that they overpaid for their vehicles because the vehicles were initially defective and the ongoing vulnerabilities have diminished their vehicles’ values.[322] The judge lifted the stay against the remaining two plaintiffs’ claims on January 10, 2017 and set a new briefing schedule for the parties with defendants’ motion to dismiss due by February 6, 2017.[323]\n\nThe potential for security breaches and privacy violations related to self-driving and other automobile software is a topic that has drawn and will continue to draw regulatory scrutiny. For example, in September 2016, the U.S. Department of Transportation released a Federal Automated Vehicles Policy that included guidelines on data collection and security.[324]\n\nSmart TVs. Private actions against manufacturers of connected devices, while still in their nascent stages, have also brought to light the data privacy and security issues applicable to IoT. Smart TV manufacturer Vizio Inc. is in the midst of a multidistrict class action litigation defending against claims that the company violated customers’ privacy rights by installing tracking software into its smart TVs that allowed it to collect viewing data and share it with third parties.[325] Plaintiffs allege that this data was then used to push targeted advertisements to the smart TVs, as well as to other connected devices that shared the same internet connection.[326] On April 11, 2016, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated the 20 class action claims to the Central District of California.[327] Vizio filed a motion to dismiss, and the court heard oral argument on this motion on December 16, 2016.[328]\n\nSmart Toys. Connected toys have also been the subject of private actions, including a recent proposed class action against ToyTalk, Inc. and Mattel, Inc. alleging that the toy Hello Barbie recorded and stored the voices of children without obtaining adequate consent in violation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).[329] In this case, which was filed in California Superior Court on December 7, 2015, and subsequently removed to the Central District of California on March 29, 2016, the connected Barbie doll included a smartphone app that would allow the parents of the child to listen to, review, and delete recordings that the Barbie doll transmitted to ToyTalk’s services.[330] The complaint alleged that while consent was obtained by the parents whose child owned the toy, the doll also captured the voices of other children whose parents had not consented to the use of the doll.[331] Though this case was ultimately voluntarily dismissed on July 22, 2016,[332] it raises unique issues that connected toys will encounter, such as compliance with COPPA.[333]\n\nRegulator Response. As these private actions are just starting to test the boundaries of data privacy and security in IoT and clear precedents have yet to be developed, regulators have provided some guidance for best practices in relation to data security and privacy of connected devices. In January 2015, the FTC released a staff report summarizing the FTC’s November 2013 workshop and providing staff recommendations related to IoT.[334] Notably, the report stated that FTC staff did not believe that IoT-specific legislation is needed at this time, but rather recommended that Congress should enact general data security legislation to strengthen the FTC’s existing data privacy and security tools. In November 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released guidance on building security safeguards directly into connected devices and included technical standards and security principles that developers are advised to take into account during every phase of a product’s development.[335] These issues have also garnered the attention of the California executive branch. In the wake of the October 21, 2016 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on Dyn, an internet infrastructure company, that caused massive internet outages, former California Attorney General Kamala D. Harris acknowledged the unique security vulnerabilities of connected devices and urged consumers to change the passwords of their household connected devices.[336] In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued guidance on December 28, 2016"
