        "text": "Babel: A bit of fun that came from translating the subtitles into Korean and then back into English, each time using the Babelfish utility. The result is mostly incomprehensible nonsense, with an occasional gem like: \"It took an attitude in the Phiber to respect,\" \"Bad name the guilty plea due to the high computer hacker,\" or \"It dies the blue screen.\" We sincerely regret that there are people walking around who have memorized this text. That was never our intention.\n\nEach of these features can also be accessed without going through the menu by hitting the subtitle button on the DVD player remote until the desired selection is reached. In addition, if you look really carefully at the sign to the right of the guy reading the Free Kevin leaflet, you'll see the following: \"If you can read this, you are standing too close to your TV.\"\n\nAudio Menu\n\nIronically, this is the only silent menu. However, that changes if you leave the menu onscreen for about two minutes. You'll be surprised by some bloodcurdling screams.\n\nHidden Audio Menu\n\nIn the audio menu, click Left, Left, Right, and Down and you will see the floating head of George W. Bush with red eyes (actually the eyes from HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey). (On most computers you will also get here by clicking on Emmanuel's hand.) A computerized voice will give a cast listing of eight voices that are used in the hidden third audio track. They read as follows:\n\n1. \"This is en1, which is a British voice, used for Emmanuel.\"\n\n2. \"This is Don, a noticeably crappy British voice, used for Bill Clinton and others.\"\n\n3. \"This is Rab, the final British voice, used for Doug Thomas and others.\"\n\n4. \"This is Kal, an American voice, used for some songs and a number of people.\"\n\n5. \"This is Ked, another American voice, used for Lewis DePayne, Jeff Moss, and others.\"\n\n6. \"This is us2, the final American male voice, used for Bernie S., John Markoff, and others.\"\n\n7. \"This is us1. As it is the only female voice, it is used for all female speakers.\"\n\n8. [in Spanish] \"And this is ell. It speaks Spanish, and thus isn't used in the film.\"\n\nWhen they're done you will be deposited in a new menu where you have the option of turning \"Computer Assisted Dialog\" on. (This menu also has the music that was missing from the main audio menu.) If you turn this feature on and play the film you will hear the entire audio track read by a variety of synthesized voices.\n\nThis additional audio track can be accessed by hitting the audio button on the DVD player remote unit until the desired selection is reached.)\n\nThe Fourth Track\n\nThis track is only accessible by hitting the audio button on the DVD player remote unit. It's completely silent except for two spots. At around 13 minutes in you'll hear a voice say \"Hey, that's me!\" and during the closing credits you'll hear the same voice say \"That's my name.\" That's the voice of Dave Buchwald, who produced the DVD and couldn't resist encoding two hours of virtual silence to further his message.\n\nRaccoon Video\n\nIf you go to the Chapters and click on selection 29-30 three times, the video and audio will reverse. If you then click on closing credits, you'll see video footage of a raccoon eating cat food inside a house. This was an incident referred to on the second edition of Off The Wall in 2003.\n\nThe FBI Warning\n\nAt the very end of the film, after a few moments of darkness, what appears to be a normal FBI warning appears. This one is unique in that it's not a warning from the FBI but rather a warning to them. It reads as follows:\n\nFBI WARNING\n\nENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TAKE NOTE -\n\nTHE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE WILL NOT\n\nBE ABUSED FOREVER. WE HAVE\n\nSTRENGTH IN NUMBERS AND THE\n\nCONVICTION OF OUR BELIEFS.\n\nTHE FILM YOU HAVE JUST SEEN IS\n\nONE OF MANY WAYS OF SPREADING\n\nTHE MESSAGE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO\n\nPUBLISH MAGAZINES, HAVE MEETINGS,\n\nDO RADIO SHOWS, USE THE INTERNET -\n\nAND MOST IMPORTANTLY - WE WILL\n\nBE WATCHING YOU.\n\nInfo on \"Congratulations Kevin!\" Shots\n\nOn our second trip across the country for the DVD footage, we got a whole bunch of people to congratulate Kevin Mitnick on finally becoming free of his supervised release constraints (which expired in January 2003). At the end of the interview with Kevin, we rolled through a bunch of these. Here's a list of who those folks were:\n\n1) Some Chicago 2600 people in Union Station\n\n2) Several friends in Poughkeepsie sitting on our rental car that we had just put 12,000 miles on (that's Kismet creator Mike Kershaw in the middle)\n\n3) Autojack in San Diego in front of a famous Afghan painting\n\n4) Mr. Upsetter in front of Ericsson in San Diego\n\n5) Porkchop, the one responsible for editing Freedom Downtime\n\n6) Gweeds in San Francisco in front of an interesting poster\n\n7) L0cke in San Antonio standing in front of the Alamo\n\n8) Wiley Wiggins and his wife Tamara with their dog\n\n9) An unknown audience member at the ScreenSavers broadcast that celebrated Kevin's return to freedom\n\n10) Ada in Madison, Wisconsin\n\n11) Jon Lebkowsky in Austin, Texas\n\n12) Trash80 in front of AT&T in San Diego\n\n13) Emmanuel Goldstein\n\n14) Mike Yuhas in Wisconsin\n\n15) Some people from the New Orleans 2600 meeting\n\n16) Leo Laporte, host of TechTV's ScreenSavers\n\n17) Alex Kasper in Westwood, CA\n\n18) Mojo in Los Angeles\n\n19) Lucky225 in Westwood, CA\n\n20) Steve Wozniak\n\n21) Reba Vartanian (Kevin's grandmother)\n\n22) Jerry Quickley of KPFK\n\n23) Kerry in Raleigh, North Carolina\n\nDISC NUMBER TWO\n\nMain Menu\n\nOn winning the Nobel Prize in Mathematics (student at U.C. Berkeley)\n\n(subtle humor - there is no Nobel Prize in Mathematics for some reason)\n\nExtra Footage Narrative\n\nThere's also a whole storyline behind the extra footage narrative. The date is Wednesday, March 3rd, 2004. Emmanuel Goldstein is sitting on a bench in a park in New York City at the crack of dawn reading a copy of the New York Times. The story he's looking for turns out to be in the Washington Post instead so he travels all the way to Washington DC (with stops in Philadelphia and Baltimore) to get a copy of that paper and return to New York by evening. The progress of the journey unfolds as chapters of Freedom Downtime extra footage are introduced. And, if you listen to that day's edition of Off The Hook, you will even hear a story from that day's Washington Post! Almost as if events actually transpired as documented which would, of course, be impossible.\n\nHere is the full storyline of the extra footage narrative:\n\n1) Emmanuel is sitting on a park bench in Tompkins Square park in New York City, reading a copy of the New York Times dated Wednesday, March 3, 2004, the day after a decisive John Kerry victory in the Democratic primaries. It's early morning. After giving the intro, Emmanuel gets a phone call from someone he's apparently been waiting to hear from.\n\n2) Now on the phone, Emmanuel claims to have not seen something that was supposed to have been in the paper and gets some distressing news. After giving the intro, he throws the copy of the paper into the trash and walks away. [Additional item: the secret message that appears in this chapter (the Freedom Downtime promo) is \"you are 0wned\" and it appears at the very end in one of the frames where \"freedom\" is on a red screen.]\n\n3) Walking west on 7th Street near Avenue A, Emmanuel is now in front of the Joe Strummer memorial.\n\n4) Exiting alt.coffee on Avenue A.\n\n5) Waiting at the uptown Astor Place #6 subway station.\n\n6) On the #6 train heading uptown.\n\n7) At the 14th Street (Union Square) station, transferring to the N train.\n\n8) On the uptown N train.\n\n9) At the 34th Street station (famous for the interactive musical tones display).\n\n10) At Penn Station.\n\n11) Buying an Amtrak ticket.\n\n12) Going down the escalator to the train.\n\n13) On the train.\n\n14) Riding between the cars.\n\n15) Going up the escalator at Philadelphia's 30th Street Station.\n\n16) In the Philadelphia subway.\n\n17) Outside in Philadelphia.\n\n18) Waiting on line at Jim's Steaks on South Street.\n\n19) Inside Jim's with a cheese steak.\n\n20) In a small park in Philadelphia heading back towards the subway.\n\n21) At stairway 7 in 30th Street Station, site of the Philadelphia 2600 meetings.\n\n22) Exiting the bathroom on the train.\n\n23) In the cafe car.\n\n24) Exiting Union Station in Washington DC.\n\n25) Walking down the mall near the Capitol Building.\n\n26) Further down the mall.\n\n27) Way down the mall and heading to the Metro.\n\n28) Waiting on the Metro platform.\n\n29) It's now evening and Emmanuel is on a street corner in Washington DC where he buys a copy of the Washington Post.\n\n30) At Union Station waiting to board a train back to New York.\n\n31) Exiting the train at Penn Station in Baltimore.\n\n32) In a parking garage where flowers and cognac are obtained from a shadowy figure.\n\n33) At Edgar Allen Poe's grave where flowers and cognac are left. (This is the only one of these segments where color is seen albeit briefly.)\n\n34) Racing for the train in Baltimore's Penn Station and taking a quick moment to admire the ceiling.\n\n35) Back on the train heading north.\n\n36) In the dining car waiting on a line.\n\n37) Coming up the escalator at Penn Station in New York City.\n\n38) Outside Penn Station, across from Hotel Pennsylvania, site of the HOPE conferences.\n\n39) In a cab heading downtown.\n\n40) Emmanuel has come full circle and is now back at the original park bench, this time with the right newspaper.\n\nThe ultimate irony of all this is that the Washington Post is sold a block away from the park."
