        "text": "With 36 hours of perspective, and readily acknowledging there is still much we need to learn about the event, I wanted to provide some personal thoughts on yesterday's massive IT outage. While this was a technology incident, not a cyber-attack, in our role as National Coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience, CISA worked aggressively with Crowdstrike and partners across government and industry at all levels to understand the breadth of impacts to critical infrastructure and help drive remediation and risk mitigation.\n\nAs we now know, the incident was caused by a defective update of Crowdstrike’s Falcon platform that triggered widespread crashes of certain versions of Windows systems across the world. It was a huge deal with serious impacts on critical infrastructure operations across the world. And while it wasn’t malicious, it was a serious mistake, one for which CEO George Kurtz took full responsibility, apologized, and committed to resolving collaboratively. Needless to say, in a world of opportunistic punditry and schadenfreude, George and his team came under pretty heavy fire. I’ll just say two things on that. First, from (very) early morning until late in the evening, George and his entire team were transparent, responsive, and professional with my team. Second, anyone who has ever been part of managing a major incident knows that gleefully throwing metaphorically flaming piles of poo at anyone, particularly in the middle of a massive crisis response, is just generally a$$hole behavior. With that, my three very high-level observations:\n\nFirst, the silver-ish lining. Cybersecurity is largely dependent on the strength of our community, and living through yesterday was a good reminder of how far we’ve come, particularly in terms of the coordination mechanisms now in place to drive collaboration and near-real-time information sharing across the federal government, and between government and the private sector, state and local entities, Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISAC’s), and international partners. It’s definitely not perfect, of course, but oh so much better than it was, even just a few years ago. Credit to us all, teammates.\n\nSecond, our nation’s critical infrastructure, the systems and services that Americans rely on every hour of every day for power, water, transportation, communication, healthcare, education, finance…and much more…is, broadly speaking: highly digitized, highly interdependent, highly connected, and highly vulnerable. And this is due, in large part, to a fragile software ecosystem that has historically deprioritized security in favor of features and speed to market. Ironically, one reason that companies like Crowdstrike and other cybersecurity vendors exist is to bolt on security to software that’s been shipped chockfull of vulnerabilities. To channel my alter ego Bob Lord : \"We don’t have a cybersecurity problem, we have a software quality problem.\"\n\nNow before you start throwing flaming poo at me, yes, I further recognize the irony of a cybersecurity vendor creating a defective update that temporarily crippled systems made by the world’s biggest software company. And to be clear, this was not a Microsoft issue. As I said at the top, we don’t know yet fully know what happened or why, but one thing I do know is that any company that builds any kind of software should design, test, and deliver it with a priority on dramatically driving down the number of flaws—flaws which can be intentionally exploited by bad actors or flaws that can unintentionally take down critical services across the globe. The other thing I know is that anyone who consumes tech (yup—that's basically all of us) should demand that those technology and software manufactures do exactly that. Why we’ve been working with technology companies large and small, including Crowdstrike and Microsoft, to voluntarily commit to the Secure by Design pledge.\n\nThird, see point above about our highly digitized, highly interdependent, highly connected, and highly vulnerable critical infrastructure ecosystem. Even in a world where we make major progress on Security-By-Design and Security-By-Demand, BAD THINGS WILL STILL HAPPEN. Whether it’s a technology outage caused by faulty code or a cyber-attack caused by Chinese cyber actors, we must expect there to be disruption. We should plan for it, prepare for it, and build our systems and our networks to withstand it as much as possible, as well as train and resource our people to manage through it. In sum, governments at all levels and critical infrastructure organizations of all sizes must double down on resilience, ensuring the ability to respond effectively and recover rapidly to minimize disruption to critical services.\n\nThat's all for now. Thanks for the read, and welcome your (non-flaming) feedback.\n\nUPDATE as of 1616, 21 July: Thanks for the comments & reactions; I'm reading them all and am grateful for them, even if I don't have time to respond directly to each one."
