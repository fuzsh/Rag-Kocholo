Some areas could see up to five inches of rain and rainfall rates up to three inches per hour into Wednesday. Governor Hochul also warned of additional heavy rain possible Thursday into Saturday due to tropical moisture associated with Tropical Cyclone Debby.\n\n“New York is no stranger to extreme weather and the potential danger of flash flooding,” Governor Hochul said. “My administration is monitoring closely and deploying resources to keep New Yorkers safe, and I encourage everyone to remain vigilant and watch the forecast closely over the next several days.”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/vkgmXABFdzE\n\nHeavy rain will begin this afternoon in the lower Mid-Hudson, New York City and Long Island regions with up to two inches of widespread rain and locally heavier amounts up to five inches possible in some locations by Wednesday. Rain could fall at rates up to two inches per hour with local rainfall rates up to three inches at times. Significant flash flooding may occur in areas with high rainfall rates. There is also a risk for isolated severe thunderstorms with damaging winds gusts this afternoon and evening. Flash flooding of urban and poor drainage areas and along rivers and streams are possible, as well as impacts to transportation, basements, first floors of residences and businesses, and underground infrastructure, as well as power outages.\n\nAgency Preparations\n\nDivision of Homeland Security and Emergency Services\n\nAt Governor Hochul's direction, the New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services has activated the State Emergency Operations Center to track the storm in real-time and support local governments’ requests for assistance.

Turn around and go another way.\n\nIf water begins to rise rapidly around you in your car, abandon the vehicle immediately.\n\nDo not underestimate the power of fast-moving water. Two feet of fast-moving flood water will float your car, and water moving at two miles per hour can sweep cars off a road or bridge.\n\nThunderstorm Safety Tips:\n\nIf you can hear thunder, you are close enough to the storm to be struck by lightning. Go to a safe shelter immediately.\n\nMove to a sturdy building. Do not take shelter in small sheds, under isolated trees, or in convertible automobiles.\n\nIf lightning occurs and sturdy shelter is not available, get inside a hard top automobile and keep windows up.\n\nGet out of boats and away from water.\n\nTelephone lines and metal pipes can conduct electricity. Unplug appliances not necessary for obtaining weather information. Avoid using the telephone or any electrical appliances.\n\nDo not take a bath or shower.\n\nTurn off air conditioners — power surges from lightning can overload compressors.\n\nGet to higher ground if flash flooding or flooding is possible.\n\nDo not attempt to drive to safety — most flash flooding deaths occur in automobiles.\n\nIf outdoors, find a low spot away from trees, fences, and poles.\n\nIf you are in the woods, take shelter under short trees.\n\nIf you feel your skin tingle or your hair stands on end, squat low to the ground on the balls of your feet; place your hands on your knees with your head between them; make yourself the smallest target possible; and minimize your contact with the ground.\n\nPower Outage Safety Tips:\n\nIf experiencing a power outage, New Yorkers should:\n\nTurn off or disconnect major appliances and other equipment, e.g., computers, in case of a momentary power surge that can damage these devices. Keep one light turned on so you know when power returns. Consider using surge protectors wherever you use electronic equipment.\n\nCall your utility provider to notify them of the outage and listen to local broadcasts for official information. For a list of utilities, visit the State Department of Public Service.\n\nCheck to see if your neighbors have power. Check on people with access or functional needs.\n\nUse only flashlights for emergency lighting - candles pose the risk of fire.\n\nKeep refrigerators and freezer doors closed - most food requiring refrigeration can be kept safely in a closed refrigerator for several hours. An unopened refrigerator will keep food cold for approximately four (4) hours. A full freezer will keep the temperature for about 48 hours.\n\nDo not use a charcoal grill indoors and do not use a gas stove for heat - they could give off harmful levels of carbon monoxide.\n\nIf you are in a tall building, take the stairs and move to the lowest level of the building. If trapped in an elevator, wait for assistance. Do not attempt to force the doors open. Remain patient - there is plenty of air and the interior of the elevator is designed for passenger safety.\n\nRemember to provide fresh, cool water for your pets.\n\nEliminate unnecessary travel, especially by car. Traffic signals will stop working during an outage, creating traffic congestion and dangerous driving conditions. If you must drive during a blackout, remember to obey the 4-way stop rule at intersections with non-functioning traffic signals.\n\nRemember that equipment such as automated teller machines (ATMs) and elevators may not be working.\n\nFor more safety tips, visit: https://www.dhses.ny.gov/safety-and-prevention.\n\nالترجمة إلى العربية\n\nDownload\n\nবাংলা অনুবাদ\n\nDownload\n\nTraduction en français\n\nDownload\n\nTradiksyon kreyòl ayisyen\n\nDownload\n\nTraduzione italiana\n\nDownload\n\n한국어 번역\n\nDownload\n\nPolskie tłumaczenie\n\nDownload\n\nПеревод на русский язык\n\nDownload\n\nTraducción al español\n\nDownload\n\nپیلے رنگ سے نمایاں کردہ ٹیکسٹ\n\nDownload\n\nאידישע איבערטייטשונג\n\nDownload"
