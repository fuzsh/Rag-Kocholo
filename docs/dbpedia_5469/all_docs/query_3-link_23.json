Well, we can see your hand.\n\nl doubt you can stick your whole head\n\nthrough the window\n\nSplotch your face up against the window\n\nWe'll know it's the right one,\n\nwe can at least zoom in on it.\n\nWe'll know it's the right one,\n\nwe can at least zoom in on it.\n\nKevin Mitnick, the world's most dangerous\n\ncomputer hacker.\n\nMy regret about Cyberpunk\n\nis talking about Kevin...\n\nand how he was always eating\n\nand how he was overweight.\n\nPeople have really gotten on my case\n\nabout that.\n\nSome guy came up to me\n\nat anAustin book thing and said:\n\n''Why did you go on and on\n\nabout Kevin's weight?''\n\nAnd he was right.\n\nl did that to the point\n\nwhere it just wasn't tasteful.\n\nWhere it was sort of...\n\njust beating an issue\n\nthat didn't need to be beaten.\n\nFor a period\n\nafter he was arrested, incarcerated...\n\nand released into a halfway house...\n\nl couldn't find a single article...\n\nthat talked about him\n\nwithout mentioning his weight.\n\nAnd the real fascination with Kevin's body...\n\nand its relationship to technology..\n\nis one of the things\n\nthat absolutely hooked me.\n\nl found a number of articles in Time,\n\nNewsweek, and the New York Times...\n\nwritten by people like Markoff\n\nand Joshua Quittner and so on.\n\nAnd they would say\n\nKevin was in a halfway house...\n\nwhere he no longer touched a computer,\n\nand lost 100 pounds.\n\nAs if those two things were connected.\n\nput his picture on the front page...\n\nmorphed or superimposed\n\nwith the image of Darth Vader.\n\nAnd l thought this is\n\na remarkable combination of two things...\n\nand it's really picking up on the idea\n\nof the Dark Side hacker.\n\nlf ever there was someone\n\nwho fit that description, it was Kevin.\n\nThe mention of his name was enough\n\nto incur the wrath of the authorities.\n\nOver the years, his reputation grew\n\nand so did the falsehoods.\n\nln numerous articles, Kevin was said to have\n\nbroken into NORAD...\n\nharassed actress Kristy McNichol...\n\nand turned his friends'\n\nhome phones into payphones.\n\nHis beginning was on ham radio.\n\nAnd on ham radio,\n\nit's a close-knit community.\n\nA couple of dozen people at the most\n\non a particular repeater or channel.\n\nAnd, you know,\n\nthey would get into challenges.\n\nAnd, of course,\n\nMitnick would be the underdog.\n\n''Let's challenge him, let's do this and that.''\n\nWhen he met their challenges,\n\nthey'd start crying and screaming...\n\nas if they were innocentvictims of Kevin's.\n\nThis has been the case throughout.\n\nAnd then people\n\nwould start unfairly using...\n\nother contacts that they had.\n\nln one case there was a lieutenant\n\nor commander in the LAPD....\n\nOne ham radio operator\n\nwho was a friend of his...\n\ngot him to write a letter saying Kevin\n\nwas interfering with LAPD communications.\n\nAnd all sorts of crazy things in his past.\n\nCyberpunk was published in 1991...\n\nCyberpunk was published in 1991...\n\nby Katie Hafner\n\nand then-husband John Markof...\n\nand relied almost entirely\n\non the words of people...\n\nwho Kevin had had a falling out with...\n\nas well as those who didn't know him at all.\n\nHafner and Markoff never talked to Kevin,\n\nbecause he wanted to be paid for his time.\n\nBut it didn't take much to dispel the rumors.\n\nNORAD denied any break-ins...\n\nKristy McNichol had no idea\n\nshe was being harassed...\n\nand no evidence ever surfaced\n\nof any payphone conversions.\n\nBut none of this ever got printed.\n\nKevin's name was enough to convict him,\n\nregardless of the actual evidence.\n\nAnd then there was Security Pacific.\n\nAfter being hired,\n\nKevin had once again been terminated...\n\nbecause of the stories that followed him.\n\nAnd this resulted in\n\nyet another Mitnick myth being born.\n\nThere was a Newswire article coming out\n\nthat stated...\n\nthat Security Pacific\n\nhad lost billions of dollars or something...\n\nin bad loans...\n\nwhich would have affected their stock price.\n\nThat was actually tracked down\n\nto some error...\n\nthat someone made\n\nin entering the information.\n\nlt had nothing to do with it not being true...\n\nbut it was an error that someone made"
