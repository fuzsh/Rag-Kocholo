Your input has helped to shape how we operate the BLP and we are committed to honoring you in how we educate, communicate, and engage with you. As we plan for the future, your insights are vital to guiding much of the work we do regarding customer service and communications.\n\nWe invite you to share your insights through a brief online survey (which should take you less than five minutes) and to nudge you a little more, we are giving away a SMART thermostat to one lucky respondent. So continue to partner with us, as we continue to serve you–our customers and our community–with reliable, affordable, and sustainable power."
