        "text": "FREEDOM DOWNTIME\n\nWe'll screen the film by Emmanuel Goldstein.\n\nAfterwards there will be an panel discussion with the filmmaker.\n\nEmmanuel Goldstein\n\nEric Gordon Corley, also frequently referred to by his pen name of Emmanuel Goldstein, is a figure in the hacker community. He and his non-profit organization 2600 Enterprises, Inc., together publish a magazine called 2600: The Hacker Quarterly, which Corley founded in 1984. Corley's pseudonym, Emmanuel Goldstein, is taken from the George Orwell book Nineteen Eighty-Four. In the book, Emmanuel Goldstein is the mysterious, and questionably existent leader of the opposition to Big Brother and the totalitarian state.\n\nHe hosts a regular radio show called \"Off the Hook\".\n\nIn 1999 Corley was named as a defendant in Universal v. Reimerdes, the movie industry's attempt to squelch DeCSS. DeCSS is a computer program capable of decrypting content on a DVD video disc encrypted using the Content-Scrambling System (CSS). 2600.com had provided links to websites which contained the DeCSS code. Corley was the only defendant who chose to fight the industry in court. United States District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan ruled against Corley.\n\nIn 1999, Corley released the full length documentary Freedom Downtime (which he wrote, directed and produced), which was about convicted hacker Kevin Mitnick and the Free Kevin movement, among other things. Furthermore, he was creative advisor to the movie Hackers.\n\nWhen, where?"
