He leads a team of 1,200 professionals who provide beneficial services for more than 580,000 veterans and their families across Illinois. These services include residential and skilled nursing care in five Veterans’ Homes, Veterans Service Officers across the state, dedicated guidance in seeking federal education benefits, and special programs and events for veterans and their families.\n\nOver the past three years, Director Prince and his team developed and executed a Six-Point Plan for the Future of IDVA initiating swift enhancements of operations, policies, and staffing. Building on this plan, the agency is executing a four-year strategic plan focused on IDVA’s people, operational excellence, and the veteran experience. These three pillars are supported by specific actions to achieve the highest level of service to Illinois veterans. The team’s mission is for veterans to thrive in Illinois.\n\nBefore joining IDVA, Director Prince served as the Superintendent of the Ohio Veterans Homes where he led 850 employees providing skilled nursing and domiciliary care for veterans at three separate facilities, including the 5th largest Veterans home in the country. After this assignment, he was awarded the department’s inaugural Major General Manning Force Award which recognized his distinguished service in a position of significant responsibility.\n\nDirector Prince began his military career in 1986 and served at 14 duty stations globally. His career centered around health care beginning as a dental technician and advancing to the Command Master Chief at Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, NC, and the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, MD. He was handpicked as the 1st Senior Enlisted Advisor at the Defense Health Agency in Falls Church, VA, and concluded his 31-year career in 2017 as the 13th Director of the U.S. Navy Hospital Corps and Force Master Chief of Navy Medicine.\n\nForce Master Chief Prince’s military awards include the Legion of Merit, Defense Superior Service Medal (two awards), Meritorious Service Medal (two awards), Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal (six awards), Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal (three awards) and the U.S. Army Order of Military Medical Merit.
