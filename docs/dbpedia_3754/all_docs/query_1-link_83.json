A DLI is a school approved by a provincial or territorial government to host international students.\n\nAll primary and secondary schools in Canada are designated learning institutions. They aren’t included in this list.\n\nIf you plan to attend a post-secondary school, make sure it is on this list.\n\nIf the school you’re studying at loses its DLI status while you’re studying, you can keep studying until your study permit expires. You may need to apply to a new DLI in other circumstances.\n\nPost-graduation work permit\n\nYou need to know if you are eligible to work after you graduate. Not all designated learning institutions and not all programs of study make you eligible for the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program.\n\nAlong with graduating from a PGWP-eligible designated learning institution, you need to meet all other criteria to get a post-graduation work permit.\n\nThe list below will let you know if your designated learning institution offers programs that will make you eligible for a post-graduation work permit.\n\nList of designated learning institutions by province/territory\n\nStep 1: Choose the province or territory your school is in.\n\nStep 2: Type in keywords such as the name of the school, city, etc."
