        "text": "Bio & Education\n\nDr. Davis teaches in the area of exercise physiology. Since arriving at UNCG in 2000, he has developed three graduate courses covering various aspects of clinical exercise physiology. He has also developed a course that focuses on current health issues related to physical activity. Dr. Davis´ research centers mostly on the effects of exercise on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. He and his students are currently conducting a study (sponsored by the National Institutes of Health) to examine the effects of exercise dose (specifically, the daily duration of moderate–intensity exercise) on several traditional and nontraditional CVD and diabetes risk factors in overweight and obese young women. Dr. Davis received his Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Exercise Science from the University of South Carolina after receiving his BSEd degree in Physical Education from Western Carolina University. Before completing his doctoral degree, he also worked several years in cardiac rehabilitation. Dr. Davis is a member of the American Heart Association and a Fellow of the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). His service to ACSM includes membership on the Executive Board of the Southeast Chapter.\n\nCourses Taught"
