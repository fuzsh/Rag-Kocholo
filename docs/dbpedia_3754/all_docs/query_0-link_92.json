Please feel\nfree to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.\n\nTouring Reading, Kansas to View Tornado Damage\n\nOn\nSaturday evening, an EF3 tornado severely damaged the\ntown of Reading, Kansas and strong storms swept through 16 counties. I traveled\nto Reading early Monday morning to tour the damage, and see how I can be of\nhelp. I\nwalked through the community with Lyon County Commissioner Scott Briggs to see the damage and to get an update on relief\nefforts. Mayor Lonnie Atchison explained that Reading has spent recent years focusing on community improvements, including\nrefurbishing the community center, which was completely destroyed by the tornado. None-the-less, there is a can-do spirit evident in the clean-up\nefforts already underway by local officials and residents alike.\n\nI\nspoke with Lyon County Emergency Management Coordinator Rick Frevert and\nSherriff Jeff Cope about the work ahead. Many people are rallying to the cause\nlike you so often see in Kansas &ndash; neighbors are coming to the rescue of their\nneighbors, and folks who don&rsquo;t even know anyone in Reading are helping out. I&rsquo;d\nlike to thank the many volunteers and emergency workers from across our state\nwho are helping their fellow Kansans during this trying time. I will continue\nto work closely with Governor Brownback to make certain local residents get the\nhelp they need as they recover. Click here to view photos from my visit.\n\n \n\n\nCongratulating Class of 2011 at Johnson County\nCommunity College\n\nOn Friday evening, I had the\nprivilege of addressing the graduating class of 2011 at Johnson County\nCommunity College in Overland Park. For more than four decades, JCCC has given\nthousands of Kansans access to an affordable, high-quality education and the\nopportunity to pursue their dreams.\n\nDuring my remarks, I challenged the\ngraduates to not define success by their resume, job title or salary, but\ninstead by the kind of person they become. In life, each of us has a higher\ncalling. Not just to make a dollar, but to make a difference. Not just to find\nhappiness, but to fulfill a purpose.\n\nOur country faces many challenges,\nbut we have a reason to be hopeful for our lives and for our futures. President\nEisenhower once said this many years ago to a class of graduates: &ldquo;The nation&rsquo;s\nfuture is what you make it. &hellip; I have faith in America&rsquo;s young men and women,\nand in the future they will build.&rdquo; I also share that optimism for the class of\n2011 at JCCC and across Kansas. Thanks to President Terry Calaway and members\nof the board of trustees for the kind invitation to participate in the special\nevening.

It&rsquo;s up to Congress to decide whether to raise the debt\nceiling for the eleventh time in the last decade. The hard truth is our country is broke. Our national debt is the\nresponsibility of several Congresses and presidents &ndash; from both political\nparties &ndash; who have allowed us to live well beyond our means for far too long.\nSimply raising the debt limit without a serious plan to reduce our debt will only continue this pattern of fiscal irresponsibility.\n\nI have notified the President that I will not vote to raise the debt\nceiling without a significant reduction in spending and a change in the way\nbusiness is done in Washington.This will take the leadership of\nPresident Obama and both political parties to craft a serious plan to reduce our debt. The plan must include significant spending\nreductions, a balanced budget amendment, and reforms to\naddress our long-term unfunded liabilities.\n\nThe time to correct our\nfailures is now. The consequences of failing to tackle our\ndebt will be far greater than failing to raise the debt ceiling. Click here to\nwatch a video addressing the magnitude of this issue on the future of our\ncountry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoting in Favor of\nRelief at the Pump\n\nThis week I voted in favor of the\nOffshore Production and Safety Act of 2011, which aims to bring an end to the\nObama Administration&rsquo;s de facto moratorium on offshore oil and gas exploration,\nwhile improving environmental safety. Unfortunately the bill failed by a vote\nof 42 to 57.\n\nRising gas prices and recent events\nin the Middle East clearly demonstrate the importance of having access to an\nample domestic energy supply which is both affordable and reliable. By\ncancelling numerous oil and gas lease sales last year and refusing to issue new\ndrilling permits within a reasonable amount of time, the Obama Administration\nhas stifled our domestic energy sector and the jobs that come with it. It\nsimply lacks common sense for the United States to restrict access to oil and\ngas exploration at home while continuing to import more than 8 million barrels\nof oil a day.\n\nHigher fuel prices are increasing\noperating costs for Kansas businesses and are particularly challenging for\nthose living in rural Kansas, who drive long distances each day to work and\nschool. The fact is increased domestic energy production will result in lower\nenergy costs. If we do nothing, gas prices will continue to escalate. The\nadministration has refused to conduct lease sales and issue drilling permits in\na timely fashion, so Congress must attempt to fill the void. Click here to read about\nmy recent request that the president reconcile the conflict between his stated goals of\nlowering energy prices, creating jobs and reducing our reliance on foreign\nenergy, with certain ongoing, damaging actions by his administration.\n\nGreeting Honor\nFlight Veterans at the WWII Memorial\n\nOn Tuesday, I was honored to spend\nsome time with World War II veterans from Kansas at the National World War II\nMemorial in Washington, D.C. These veterans, who hail from towns like\nConcordia, Phillipsburg, Smith Center, Glade and others in the north central\npart of Kansas, represent the best of America &ndash; a willingness to sacrifice for\nthe greater good and for the betterment of future generations. \n\nThe veterans I visited with were\nvisiting Washington, D.C. with the Honor Flight Network, a grassroots\norganization that enables veterans to visit the WWII Memorial created in their\nhonor in 2004. A driving force in the creation of this Memorial was former\nKansas Senator Bob Dole. To the delight of the veterans, Senator Dole showed up\nwhile the veterans were walking through their Memorial. It was a great\nexperience for me to interact with Senator Dole and fellow members of The\nGreatest Generation. The day truly reaffirmed my commitment to do all I can to\nmake our nation a better place for future generations. Click here to view photos of their visit.\n\n \n\n\n\nJoining Defense Secretary Gates to Break Ground on New\nFt. Riley School\n\nOn Thursday, I traveled to Ft.\nRiley to attend the groundbreaking ceremony for a much-needed elementary school\non post. Kansans can be proud that we are making certain the needs of those who\nserve in our nation&rsquo;s military are being met, and while they&rsquo;re deployed\noverseas, their children have access to quality education.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Robert\nGates, whose personal involvement secured the resources to begin construction\nof the new school, was on hand to give remarks and observe a group of preschoolers\nturn the first shovelful of dirt on their future school. Also attending the\nceremony were Maj. Gen. Vincent\nBrooks, officials from the Geary County\nschool district including Superintendent Ron Walker, Governor Sam\nBrownback and Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins.\n\nSecretary Gates visited Ft. Riley a\nyear ago and met with military spouses who shared the need to improve the\nquality of the post&rsquo;s public schools, which face severe overcrowding problems\nsince the 2006 return of the Army&rsquo;s 1st Infantry Division to post which brought\nthousands of new soldiers, family members and civilians with it. Secretary Gates\ntook these comments to heart, bringing us this groundbreaking of a new\nelementary school along with additional funds to upgrade an existing elementary\nschool. This event marked a significant step to addressing the deficiencies.\n\nAs the military installation facing\nsome of the most severe school problems in the country, the DOD has also\nidentified a need to build two additional elementary schools and a middle\nschool at Ft Riley. To address this need, in April, I was pleased to\nsupport passage of a DOD program that dedicates resources for public school\nconstruction and renovation on installations across the country with the most\nserious deficiencies in condition or capacity, such as Ft. Riley. Click here to see a photo\nof some of the excited preschoolers that attended the groundbreaking for their\nnew school.\n\n \n\n\nContinuing the Statewide Listening Tour\n\nMy listening tour continued this week as I visited Wyandotte, Jackson and\nPottawatomie counties. I\nhad the pleasure of hosting my first ever town hall meeting in Wyandotte County\non Monday. There was a wonderful turn out of residents and business owners to\ndiscuss issues important to them, including five students from Arrowhead Middle\nSchool Debate Team. I visited with attendees about jobs creation and the\nimportance of reducing burdensome federal regulations, which cost business\nowners money and stifle economic growth. Thank you to Cindy Cash of the Kansas\nCity Chamber for organizing the event and to the elected officials and public\nservants who attended, including State Senator David Haley, State\nRepresentative Tom Burroughs, Edwardsville Mayor John McTaggart, Unified\nGovernment Commissioner Tom Cooley, and Kansas City Community College Trustee\nWendell Maddox.\n\nOn Thursday, my annual listening\ntour continued in Hoyt and St. Marys. At the community center in Hoyt, Jackson\nCounty residents shared their views on overregulation by the EPA, the rising\nprice of fuel, and federal spending. Kansas communities bear a regulatory\nburden that stifles economic growth, especially community banks, farmers and\nbusiness owners. We need to lower this regulatory burden and allow our rural\ncommunities to thrive. It was good to see some old friends in Hoyt, and a\nspecial thanks to Hoyt Mayor Neale Sutton and County Commissioner Larry Fenske\nfor attending. \n\nLater Thursday\nmorning, Pottawatomie County residents gathered at City Hall in St. Marys to\nshare their concerns about the future of Kansas businesses and our nation&rsquo;s\ndebt. We also discussed the importance of rural health care and the future of\nhealth care reform. Thank you to Mayor Kevin Werick and City Manager Maurice\nCordell for hosting. Thanks also to State Representative Richard Carlson and City Commissioner Doyle\nPearl for\nattending. Click here to view photos\nfrom my stops.\n\n\n\nCommunity Housing\nof Wyandotte County, Inc.\n\nWhile in Wyandotte County on Monday, I also visited with the\nstaff and board members of Community Housing of Wyandotte, Inc. (CHWC). They\nserve the urban core of Kansas City, Kansas by providing affordable housing and\nhousing education to first-time and low-income residents. CHWC is non-profit\nand a great example of using public funds to\nstabilize, revitalize and reinvest in our neighborhoods through improved\nhousing and other quality of life improvements. Thank you to Annie\nTrotta with CHWC for inviting me and for Executive Director and CEO Donny Smith\nfor hosting me.
