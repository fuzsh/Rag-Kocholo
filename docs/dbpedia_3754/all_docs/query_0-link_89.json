        "text": "Former Lawrence Mayor Dennis “Boog” Highberger, a Democrat, has snagged Paul Davis’s vacant seat in the Kansas Statehouse to represent District 46.\n\nHighberger, 54, beat out Republican J. Douglas “Doug” Robinson, a political newcomer, in Tuesday’s election, according to results from the Douglas County Clerk’s office.\n\nHighberger served two terms on the Lawrence City Commission from 2003 to 2009, including a one-year term as mayor during those years.\n\nThe new state representative said he thinks his local government experience will be a great benefit to the state of Kansas.\n\n“I think coming at it from a local government perspective will be beneficial,” Highberger said Tuesday night. “The current Legislature doesn’t understand its impacts on local governments and, as a result, local taxes are rising dramatically.”\n\nHighberger said he has many plans for his first term in a state office.\n\n“First, we have to fix the hole in the budget,” he said. “I also want to work on Medicaid expansion and make sure schools are properly funded.\n\nIn order to accomplish the funding issues, Highberger said, he aims to tackle the 2012 state tax cuts.\n\n“I aim to make the tax system more fair by repealing specific tax cuts, such as those exempting certain businesses having no taxes at all,” Highberger said.\n\nHighberger is currently a partner in a downtown Lawrence law practice. Previously, he served for 20 years as an attorney with the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.\n\nKansas State Senator Marci Francisco, a fellow Democrat and former Lawrence mayor, said the reaction from Topeka to news of Highberger’s election has been positive.\n\n“All the other legislators are excited about having Boog,” Francisco said. “We’re glad to have a lawyer and a breath of fresh air.”\n\nHighberger called the 2014 election “the most important in (his) lifetime” — not because he was elected, he said, but because of the political climate in Kansas. Highberger had been an outspoken supporter of Davis’ bid for governor.\n\nWhile attending a Davis tour stop in Lawrence last week, Highberger said he was confident he could handle filling the vacancy left in District 46.\n\n“They’re big shoes to fill,” Highberger joked, “but I wear size 13s, so I think I will be able to do that.”\n\nThe 46th House District covers large parts of Lawrence east of Iowa Street, south of the Kansas Turnpike and north of 19th Street. Highberger has lived in Lawrence since 1977 and within the district for all but one of those years, he said.\n\nRobinson could not be reached for comment Tuesday."
