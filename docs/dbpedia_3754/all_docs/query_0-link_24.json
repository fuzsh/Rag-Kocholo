        "text": "LAWRENCE — University of Kansas experts are available to comment on and analyze results from Tuesday's general election that featured key races nationally and in Kansas.\n\nNationally, Republicans took control of the U.S. Senate, giving the GOP a majority in both houses of Congress when the new session begins in January. In two closely watched races in Kansas, Republican Gov. Sam Brownback fended off a challenge from Democratic House Minority Leader Paul Davis in a race that many polls had shown Davis leading the incumbent governor. U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts also garnered 53 percent of the vote to defeat independent challenger Greg Orman. Roberts won a fourth term despite also trailing in polls within the past two months.\n\nKansas politics\n\nPatrick Miller, assistant professor of political science, can speak about politics in Kansas, including the governor and U.S. Senate races, and nationally. He monitors state and national polling made available and tweets analysis at his Twitter account.\n\n\"Most of the polls were reporting similar results, so the real question is how did Republicans outdo Democrats on Election Day? I think the answer is an excellent get-out-the-vote effort,\" Miller said. \"Republicans simply did a better job of mobilizing their voters on Election Day. And fascinatingly, we saw a rare substantial mismatch in Kansas between the early vote, where Davis and Orman did much better, and the Election Day vote.\"\n\nBurdett Loomis, professor of political science, is available to speak about Kansas politics, including the Senate and gubernatorial campaigns. He also researches Congress, U.S. politics and lobbying.\n\n\"The polls may well have generally not got the composition of the electorate right. That said, both GOP victories were impressive. I do think that the vast outside-money spending against Orman – probably a total of $25-plus million — did a lot of damage,\" Loomis said. \"It may well have moved a substantial number of Republicans back into Roberts’ camp. All the GOP’s work was to pull out as many party loyalists as possible, and it worked. And of course the national wave did affect Kansas to an extent. The exit poll data back that up.\"\n\nTo arrange an interview with Miller or Loomis, contact George Diepenbrock at 785-864-8853 or gdiepenbrock@ku.edu.\n\nMark Johnson, lecturer in journalism and law, and partner in an international law firm, can speak about voter eligibility, postelection disputes over results, campaign finance, including contributions and expenditures, as well as the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United and what it meant for American elections. Johnson can also address the relationship between the Kansas courts and legislative branch.\n\nTo arrange an interview with Johnson, contact Mike Krings at 785-864-8860 or mkrings@ku.edu.\n\nNational political races, issues\n\nIn addition to Kansas races, KU experts are available to address national trends on demographics and election issues.\n\nDon Haider-Markel, professor and chair of the Department of Political Science, can speak about national political trends and races and potential policy implications. His research includes American politics and public policy.\n\nChristina Bejarano, associate professor of political science, is available to talk about U.S. politics. Her work focuses on women and Latinos in U.S. electoral politics, both their voting trends and political candidates. She has written two books: \"The Latino Advantage: Gender, Race and Political Success\" and \"The Latino Gender Gap in U.S. Politics.\"\n\nPaul Johnson, a professor or political science and director of KU's Center for Research Methods and Data Analysis, is available to discuss polling data, public opinion, elections and voting behavior. His broad research interests include interest group politics, electoral institutions, public opinion and data analysis.\n\nAlesha Doan, chair of the Department of Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies and associate professor of political science, can address political issues nationally and in Kansas related to women, including topics of abortion and reproductive policy.\n\nGary Reich, an associate professor of political science, is available to speak about immigration-related issues and policy. His research includes immigration policy at state and federal levels.\n\nTo interview Haider-Markel, Bejarano, Johnson, Doan or Reich, contact George Diepenbrock at 785-864-8853 or gdiepenbrock@ku.edu.\n\nRobert Rowland, a professor of communication studies, researches political rhetoric, including political debates and the rhetoric of presidents. Recently, he published a journal article on the first 2012 presidential debate."
