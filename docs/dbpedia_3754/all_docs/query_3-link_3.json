        "text": "August 22, 2021\n\nAs a young basketball player with big dreams, Paul Davis received a scholarship to attend Michigan State University. The Rochester, Michigan native played Spartan basketball from 2002-2006 under famed head coach Tom Izzo and helped lead MSU to the Elite Eight and Final Four during his college basketball career. Davis went on to play basketball at the highest level in the world in the NBA with the L.A. Clippers and Washington Wizards.\n\nNow, Davis, a partner with Podium Risk Management in Southfield which helps athletes, entertainers, executives and business owners create long-term financial success, is giving back to his alma mater and giving a major assist to MSU student-athletes pursuing their own goals and dreams. The devoted supporter of Michigan State University and MSU Athletics is pleased to announce the establishment of the Paul Davis athletics scholarship endowment which will award a $10,000 scholarship annually to a qualified MSU student-athlete.\n\n“It’s an honor and a privilege to be able to give back to the university that served as a launching pad for my career and life after basketball,” Davis said. “MSU opened so many doors for me and I was able to build relationships that continue to this day. I’m excited to create a path for student athletes, just like the one I took, so they can continue to work towards their dreams.”\n\nThere is no application process; MSU Athletics will select the scholarship winners and announce the award each spring, beginning this year. The scholarship will go to athletes in sports other than football or basketball.\n\n“Athletes who participate in other sports put in just as much time and work with less fanfare and recognition,” Davis said. “I don’t want any kid that’s dreaming to be deterred by a lack of funding or opportunity. We need to create pathways for kids to pursue their dreams, but it will always be their responsibility to put in the work, compete and represent the university.”\n\n“It was a pleasure working with Paul on this major gift commitment to MSU Athletics and aligning his passions for sport and philanthropy,” added Bryan Hoch, Director of Premium Seating with MSU Athletics. “Paul was the recipient of a scholarship during his playing days at MSU and to see him be in a position to give back and to establish his own scholarship is something all Spartans can be proud of. The Paul Davis athletics scholarship endowment is set up to live on in perpetuity and will be awarded annually to an MSU student-athlete for Paul’s lifetime and well after that.”"
