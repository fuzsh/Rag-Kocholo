Developed by Vectordean and published by Electronic Arts, the game features an anthropomorphic elephant named Rolo who embarks on a mission to rescue his friends who have been captured and imprisoned across various levels. Throughout the game, players navigate through levels, avoid obstacles, and utilize abilities of different animal friends that Rolo frees. It combines elements of action and puzzle-solving within its levels. With its charming graphics and kid-friendly design, Rolo to the Rescue stands out as a classic title from the 16-bit era."
