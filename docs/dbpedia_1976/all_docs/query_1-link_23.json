        "text": "David Tate – Scots Creek Alabama genealogy : Chief Alexander McGillivray’s nephew, heir and relic, David Tate was the son of Scotsman David Taitt, British loyalist and deputy superintendent for the Southern Department of Indian Affairs, in 1772.\n\nAccording to the Baptismal Registry of April 11, 1797, of All Hallows Barking Church, Byward Street, the oldest basilica in London, England, David Tate was born “in 1779, in West Florida, in the Indian Nation, son of David Tate.” The prestigious sanctuary was also the site for future President John Quincy Adams’ wedding. Tate’s cousin, Alexander McGillivray Junior, born 1787, in the Creek Nation, was baptized, too.i Tate was the matrilineal nephew and heir to Chief Alexander McGillivray. He was also the matrilineal nephew and heir to Chief Malcolm McPherson of Hickory Ground. Tate was Creek royalty. His great uncle was the outspoken Red Shoes of Tuckabatchee.\n\niFamilySearch.org, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Parish registers for All Hallows Barking by the Tower, 1558-1900 (6 microfilm reels; 35 mm.).\n\n<https://familysearch.org/search/catalog/698292?availability=Family%20History%20Library>\n\nAt the outset of the Creek Civil War, David Tate lost his first wife, Mary Louise Randon, at Fort Mims, August 30, 1813. She was killed alongside 250 other unfortunate mixed-blood settlers, in a vendetta by the Red Sticks against David Tate, and like-minded “civilized” proteges of Benjamin Hawkins. Accommodationist Creeks didn’t buy what Tecumseh was selling – active participation against the Americans on behalf of the British, during the War of 1812.\n\nTate, our Alabama ancestor, half brother to the infamous William Weatherford (Red Eagle), fathered numerous children. And, as the progenitor of thousands of African Americans, may be considered the patriarch of a remnant “tribe.”\n\nby\n\nCarolyn E. Hood-Kourdache\n\nTree Rings Publishing, LLC\n\nU.S.A."
