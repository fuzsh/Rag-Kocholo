        "text": "Whew! Today was long but so much fun.\n\nMy fiance, Sweetums, and I started Day 2 of the Odd Travels Road Trip in Montgomery after staying at the old Greystone Hotel. Read that story here.\n\nWe took some photos of the capitol building in the daylight and toured Oakwood Cemetery, where we visited Hank Williams' grave, of course, and saw some of the other beautiful markers, as well.\n\nThen we returned to our route on U.S. Highway 31 South, which we planned to take to Mobile. After some sightseeing there, we'll travel to Dothan, then back up U.S. 431 to Huntsville, arriving home Friday.\n\nHere's a rundown of today's trip after leaving Montgomery:\n\nWe saw only one Wal-Mart. However, we have seen three dead armadillos and two raccoons in the past two days. We also have seen three crypts lying randomly alongside U.S. Highway 31. We're keeping a tally of Wal-Marts, road kill and roadside crypts on our trip.\n\nThe lowest gas price today was $2.98 near Brewton. I knew Brewton was home to the Blueberry Festival but I also learned it was the birthplace of William Lee Golden of the Oak Ridge Boys and country singer Hank Locklin.\n\nWe stopped at three other cemeteries: Two quite rural - Bowman in Escambia and Sawyer in Lowndes - and a beautiful large burial ground in Evergreen. Lots and lots of Stallworths were buried in Evergreen. One headstone I found intriguing was for Jeptha Perryman. The obelisk had fallen and broken but it was etched with a litany of the young man's wonderful attributes. The one I loved most was he \"loved his parents.\" So sweet.\n\nWe stopped in Georgiana and took photos of Hank Williams' childhood home because, well, we're from Alabama and it's a requirement.\n\nWe saw some really funny and clever signs that make you shake your head and think \"only in Alabama.\" Although I haven't published all of those yet, you can click here to see a post of\n\nWe saw one roadside Ten Commandments sign. The listings of \"shalt nots\" was in the yard of a private home on U.S. 31.\n\nWe took photos of several historic churches for use in future Odd Travels features.\n\nWe stopped in Flomaton to figure out how it got its name and, handily, there was a historic marker to explain it for us. The \"Flo\" is for Florida, the \"ma\" for the end of Alabama and the \"ton\" stands for town. Then we couldn't decide what the locals would be called, but we settled on \"Flomatonians.\" Locals, let us know what you like to be called.\n\nI took a photo of Sweetums pretending to fall into a wishing well in Flomaton because, although he is 6 feet, 7 inches tall, he is a great big kid at heart.\n\nWe passed through an unincorporated community called \"Canoe,\" and got a kick out of seeing the name on the town water tower. Also, when passing a local cemetery, we noticed the surname \"Shipp\" is popular in Canoe. Interesting.\n\nWe took photos in downtown Brewton, which has a preserved historical commercial district along a central railway that includes the beautiful green facade of the Brewton Bank.\n\nWe stopped in downtown Bay Minette at dusk and took a photo of the lovely contemporary courthouse. Out front, a marker tells the history of Judge Harry Toulin, who issued the Alabama arrest warrant for Aaron Burr when he was a fugitive from the law on charges of treason. Burr, who famously shot and killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel, had planned to form an independent nation under his rule so Thomas Jefferson ordered him arrested. Burr was later acquitted. The tale of Burr's Alabama arrest is in my latest book, co-written by Sweetums,\n\nHow Murder Creek got its name\n\nWhen we crossed over Murder Creek in Escambia County, I recalled reading the story of how it got its name. It has been called by that name since 1788, when Col. Alexander McGillivray was visited at his Conecuh County home by a Col. Kirkland, Kirkland's son, nephew and several friends.\n\nMembers of the group were royalists who wanted to get to Pensacola and eventually settle in the Spanish province of Louisiana. McGillivray sent a slave to help guide the party to Pensacola, according to the 1851 book by Albert James Pickett, \"History of Alabama, and Incidentally of Georgia and Mississippi, from the Earliest Period.\"\n\nHe wrote: \"Col. Kirkland and his party had much silver in their saddle-bags. Arriving within a mile of a large creek, which flows into the Conecuh, they met a pack-horse party, about sunset, going up to the nation. They had been to Pensacola, on a trading expedition. This party consisted of a Hillabee Indian, who had murdered so many men, that he was called Istillicha, the Man-slayer--a desperate white man, who had fled from the States for the crime of murder, and whom, on account of his activity and ferocity, the Indians called the Cat--and a blood-thirsty negro, named Bob, the property of Sullivan, a Creek trader of the Hillabees.\"\n\nWhen Kirkland and his men camped for the night, they placed their saddlebags filled with silver beneath their heads and leaned their guns against a tree.\n\n\"At midnight, the bloody wretches from the other side, cautiously came over, and, seizing the guns of Kirkland and his men, killed every one of them .... Dividing the booty, the murderers proceeded to the Creek nation, and, when the horrid affair became known, Col. McGillivray sent persons in pursuit of them. Cat was arrested; but the others escaped. Milfort was directed to convey the scoundrel to the spot where he had shed the blood of these men, and there to hang him, until he was dead. ... Reaching the creek where poor Kirkland and his men were murdered, Cat was suspended to the limb of a tree, the roots of which were still stained with the blood of the unfortunate colonel and his companions. While he was dangling in the air, and kicking in the last agonies, the Frenchman stopped his motions with a pistol ball. Such is the origin of the name 'Murder Creek.'\"\n\nClick through the slides beneath the map to see the entire road trip."
