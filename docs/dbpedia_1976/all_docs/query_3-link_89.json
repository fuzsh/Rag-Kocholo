        "text": "Thanks to a new state law, dozens of churches across Southern California are redeveloping underused properties into affordable housing.\n\nKCRW's all-music channel blending the collected talents and tastes of all KCRW's DJs into a single voice streaming 24 hours a day.\n\nHarris’ economic plan takes on price gouging. Where does Democratic “freedom” messaging leave Republicans? And the panel looks back at political freakouts.\n\nRoxy Music’s Bryan Ferry teams with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross on the pulsating new single “Star.”\n\nLost Notes speaks with Gloria Jones (“Tainted Love”) for a wide-ranging and intimate conversation about her life and career.\n\nThe Democratic Convention kept the good times rolling for Kamala Harris and a rejuvenated Democratic Party. But with 10 weeks until Election Day, the race is tied.\n\nKim Masters and Matt Belloni banter about the summer box office, noting that it started with a whimper but is ending with a bang thanks to a sequel and two superheroes."
