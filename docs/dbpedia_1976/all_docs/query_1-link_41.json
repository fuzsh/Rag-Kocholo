        "text": "WELCOME TO THE MID NORTH COAST PIONEERS (MNCP) WEBSITE\n\nThis family history website began its' life back in 2008. It was established by Stuart Gregory in preparation for a Gregory family reunion in Newcastle in 2009. The actual website server has always been located in Stuart's home office in Perth, Western Australia. Various versions of the open source software program, now called webtrees, has been used to manage and display the database. Sincere thanks are given to the prime developer, Greg Roach and to all of the other developers who have contributed so much time and effort in its' development.\n\nSome brief details of the MNCP website are:-\n\nIt was last updated on 11 August 2024.\n\nThere are 96,000 people with 8,925 different surnames in this family tree.\n\nThe earliest recorded event is the Birth of John AYSSHDOWNE in .\n\nThe largest family is:\n\nThomas SMITH + Charlotte BLANCH\n\nReligious marriage:\n\nThe most recent event is the Death of Neville James Nev KNEIPP in .\n\nFor further statistics, see below.\n\nIf you have any comments or feedback please contact Stuart Gregory.\n\nThis Web Site is Work In Progress\n\nOver the years, many family members have added to the data included in this site. It is because of these generous efforts that the web site has grown from simply recording my family interests, to recording family interests that are commonly linked. Because of this common linking, the families shown have mostly descended from the pioneering families of the Hunter and Manning valleys.\n\nThere are a number of families that arrived in Australia as government assisted migrants and there are a number of families who are descended from convicts. These two groups comprise the majority of the pioneering families shown here. Most of the government assisted migrant families came from the Highlands and western isles of Scotland.\n\nI am particularly anxious that all of the information shown is correct. This is often difficult due to many factors and decisions have to be made as to what data is the most likely to be correct. The data included in the NSW on-line Births, Deaths and Marriages Indices is sometimes incorrect. Inscriptions on headstones and information in church records is sometimes incorrect. Judgements have to be made. Having said this, I am most anxious to be advised of any incorrect information that is shown. Please email me and let me know about these errors and why they are incorrect.\n\nIf your family is not included, why not drop me an email and let me know your family details. If you wish to do this, may I suggest that you read the FAQ's first, particularly this one.\n\nOn the other hand, all of the information of which we are aware is shown on our web site. We don't withhold information. Therefore, please do not make contact simply asking for more information. Again, may I suggest that you read the FAQs, particularly this one.\n\nThe details shown mostly comprise the simple birth, marriage and death details, it is desirable that this basic information is expanded to include how these families interacted, not only through marriage, but their contributions to their local areas and Australian history in general. I would particularly like information on our family members who gave their lives in various theatres of war and other conflicts. Family stories, family pictures and other anecdotes make visiting this web site much more enjoyable and worthwhile.\n\nFinally I repeat that the information shown on this web site is certainly incomplete and there may be errors. I would be appreciative of an email notification of any errors found and the supporting sources of the correct information.\n\nStuart"
