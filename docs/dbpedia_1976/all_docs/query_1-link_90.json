        "text": "Joan McGillivrary was the widow of John McGillivray. She lived at 1915 Pendrell Street from 1918 to about 1929.\n\nLife in Scotland\n\nJoan McGillivrary was born Joan McKay on November 6, 1863 on the island of Eigg, one of the Small Isles off the west coast of Scotland. (Her name sometimes appears with two “n”s: Joann.)\n\nShe was married to John McGillivray, who was born at Stornoway, Scotland. He worked as a builder, and it appears that he died between 1891 and 1901.\n\nIn 1901, Joan was living in Falkirk, Stirlingshire, with three children: Annabella, Anne and John.\n\nTo Canada\n\nIn 1911, Joan sailed to Canada, along with Annabella, Annie and John. Joan’s immigration document indicated that she had been a district nurse in Scotland.\n\nJoan first appeared in the Vancouver directories in 1912. She was living at 35 East Lansdowne Avenue in Vancouver’s Mount Pleasant area.\n\nJoan and other members of her family lived at the following addresses in Vancouver from 1912 to 1929.\n\n1912 35 East Lansdowne Avenue 1913 1855 Pandora Street (Annabella McGillivray) 1913 1731 Pandora Street (as Mrs. Joan MacGillvray: “Mac,” not “Mc.”) 1914 2737 East Second Avenue (Miss A. McGillivray and Mrs. J. McGillivray; also Alex Mulholland, who married Annabella Mulholland in January 1914). 1915 2737 East Second Avenue (Miss A. McGillivray and Alex Mulholland) 1916 1636 Victoria Drive (Annie McGillivray, Mrs. John McGillivrary and Alex Mulholland [active service]) 1917 1636 Victoria Drive (Annie McGillivray, Mrs. John McGillivrary and Mrs. A. Mulholland) 1918 to 1929 1915 Pendrell Street\n\nIn 1929, Joan travelled from Vancouver to Washington State. She was visiting with her son, John, who was living in Spokane, Washington.\n\nJoann died in North Vancouver, British Columbia on May 7, 1948. She was buried in the Masonic Cemetery in Burnaby, British Columbia.\n\nJoan had the following children.\n\nAnnabella McGillivray\n\nAnnabella McGillivray was born in Falkirk, Stirlingshire, Scotland on June 23, 1891.\n\nIn 1901 she was living with her mother in Falkirk.\n\nIn 1911 she travelled to Canada with her mother.\n\nOn January 28, 1914, in Vancouver, she married Alexander Mulholland, who was a carpenter. He was born on April 18, 1889 at Kilmory on the island of Arran in Buteshire, Scotland. His parents were Alexander Mulholland and Catherine Downie.\n\nOn September 9, 1915, in Vancouver, Alexander signed his attestation papers to serve with the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War.\n\nHe was killed on October 8, 1916, during the Battle of the Somme.\n\nHis name appears on the Vimy Memorial at Pas de Calais, France, as well as on a war memorial at the Ross Road intersection, between Sliddery and Lagg on the island of Arran, Scotland.\n\nIn 1921, Annabella and her son, Gordon, were living with Annabella’s mother at 1915 Pendrell Street.\n\nAnnabella died in Vancouver on March 6, 1946. She was buried in the Masonic Cemetery in Burnaby, British Columbia.\n\nAnnabella and Alexander had a son, Gordon Alexander Mulholland (1915-1991).\n\nAnne Robertson McGillivray\n\nAnne Robertson McGillivray was born in Falkirk, Stirlingshire, Scotland on January 9, 1897.\n\nIn 1901 she was living with her mother in Falkirk.\n\nIn 1911 she travelled to Canada with her mother.\n\nIn 1921 she was living with her mother at 1915 Pendrell Street in Vancouver.\n\nIn April 1926, Anne became engaged to John R. Ross.\n\nJohn Ross was a commission agent with Frederick A. Tasker.\n\nJohn was born in Glasgow, Scotland on February 10, 1895. His parents were John Ross and Isabella Graham. The wedding was in Vancouver on April 29, 1926.\n\nThe marriage was not successful. By 1927, Anne was again living at 1915 Pendrell Street, while John remained at his former home on Broadway.\n\nIn 1928, Anne’s directory listing called her “Anne McG Ross.”\n\nBy 1929, Anne was using her maiden name.\n\nIn April 1929, Anne went to Spokane, Washington.\n\nIn 1951, she declared her intention to become a naturalized United States citizen.\n\nIn 1952 she was living with her brother, John, in Spokane. She was an assistant with Filiatrault’s gift shop.\n\nAnne died in North Vancouver, British Columbia on November 30, 1990.\n\nJohn Ross’s Marriage to Cecile\n\nOn July 25, 1934 in Vancouver, John Ross married Marie Cecilia Desrosiers, who was a school teacher. (She was often called “Cecile.”) She was born in Vancouver on January 12, 1903. Her parents were Magloire Desrosiers and Marie Caroline Boeur.\n\nJohn died on May 10, 1956.\n\nOn November 12, 1966, in Vancouver, Cecile married Vernon Kiltz.\n\nVernon died on August 25, 1975.\n\nMarie died on February 25, 1998.\n\nJohn McGillivray\n\nJohn McGillivray was born in Falkirk, Stirlingshire, Scotland on May 4, 1899. (He sometimes spelled his surname as “MacGillivray.”)\n\nIn 1901 he was living with his mother in Falkirk.\n\nIn 1911, he travelled to Canada with his mother and his two sisters.\n\nHe worked as an insurance clerk.\n\nOn May 27, 1918, in Esquimalt, British Columbia, he signed his attestation paper to serve with the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War.\n\nHe was discharged from the military forces on December 23, 1918, during the demobilization at the end of the war.\n\nIn 1921, he was living with his mother at 1915 Pendrell Street in Vancouver.\n\nOn April 7, 1927 he moved to the United States and, by June 1927, he was in Spokane, Washington, where he became a fire insurance adjuster.\n\nOn December 25, 1930, in Spokane, he married Orlena Hammond, who was a bacteriologist. (Her first name sometimes appears as “Orleana.”) She was born in Spokane on August 5, 1899. Her parents were William Charles Hammond (1871-1925) and Susan Cecelia Schearer (1878-after 1940).\n\nIn 1933, John petitioned to become a naturalized United States citizen.\n\nJohn was an insurance adjuster until the 1950s.\n\nJohn died on January 3, 1956, in Ritzville, Adams County, Washington.\n\nOrlena died in Spokane on November 8, 1967.\n\nSources\n\nJoan McKay (wife of John McGillivrary)\n\n1901 Scotland Census; Joan McGillivray; Ancestry.com. 1901 Scotland Census [database on-line].
