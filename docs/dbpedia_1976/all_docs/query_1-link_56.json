WOODWARD, OF LOUISIANA,\n\n(FORJ1KELT Of ALABAMA.)\n\nWITH AN APPENDIX,\n\nCONTAINING INTERESTING MATTEK RELATING TO THE GENERAL SUBJECT.\n\nMONTGOMERY, ALAV:\n\nDAEBETT A WIMBISU, BOOK AND GENERAL JOB PRINTERS.\n\n1859.\n\nEntered according to act of Congress, on the 9th of January, 1859, by\n\nJ. J. HOOPER, as Proprietor,\n\nIn the Clerks Office of the District Court of the United States for the Middle District of Alabama.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nMOST of the letters which are contained in this little volume were writ ten by Gen. Woodward, without any idea of their being presented to the public in this form. Indeed, the first two. addressed to his friend Mr. Hanrick, were not expected to be published, at all; but being casually shown to the writer of this introduction, he solicited and obtained them for insertion in the columns of the Montgomery Mail, believing that their contents would prove attractive to a large class of readers who feel much interest in all that concerns the early history of the State. Subse quently, Gen. Woodward was kind enough to contribute to the \"Mail,\" (with which the undersigned is connected as senior editor,) a number of letters containing much valuable matter relative to the history, cus toms, &c., of the Creek Confederacy of Indian tribes. About the same time, friends of his caused the publication, in the Columbus Sun and Union Springs Gazette, of several letters written by Gen. W. to them. All these letters, replete as they were with incidents and descriptions of a most interesting character, found favor with the public; and the undersigned was frequently applied to for copies of them, which it was impossible to supply. This suggested to him the idea of publishing the whole in a form convenient both for preservation and reference; He therefore immediately wrote to Gen. Woodward asking his consent to his having the letters collectively published. It was with some difficulty that this consent was obtained, as Gen. Woodward alleged that his want of early education and the inaccuracy of his style unfitted him to appear before the public as a writer of historical sketches. He only yielded, at length, to the argument that he alone, perhaps, of living men, possessed a knowledge of the many interesting facts and traditions he had acquired during an intercourse of nearly half a century with the Indian tribes of the South-west. These facts are stated in justice to Gen. Woodward and with the view of disarming the hypercritical, who might be disposed to be severe upon the homely but effective phraseology with which the Generals interesting narrations are clothed.\n\nOne or two of the letters addressed to the late lamented Col. Albert J. Pickett, who did his State so much service and himself so much credit, by his elaborate History of Alabama, were never seen by that gentleman. They were received for publication by the writer of this, about the time of Col. Picketts last illness. In one of his letters in this volume, Gen. Woodward pays a sincere tribute to the memory of his old friend. In the same letter, he speaks his admiration of and regard for two other prominent Alabamians. lately deceased: ex-Gov. Arthur P. Bagby, and Col. Charles McLemore, of Chambers county.\n\nIt is more than twenty years since the writer first saw and knew Gen. Woodward. His personal acquaintance with him was but slight; yet he knew well his reputation in East Alabama, as a brave, rough, warm-\n\n4\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nhearted man, of fine intellectual endowments, a most sagacious judge\n\nof character, extensive knowledge of Creek Indian history, manners\n\nand character with an indomitable will and a sturdy self-reliance, which\n\nspoke for itself in his tall, sinewy form and strongly-marked, expressive\n\nface. A discriminating observer, at that time, would have selected him\n\nout of a thousand, as the man most fertile in resources, most indom\n\nitable in the execution of his plans, and possessing in the highest degree\n\nthe physical qualities most needed in the emergencies and hardships of\n\na semi-Indian life. His exterior was rough, his manners military and at\n\ntimes abrupt, but those who knew him best, were well aware that he\n\nhad a heart large enough for any deed of real benevolence. The presum\n\ning or pretentious he mercilessly flayed with a biting sarcasm, of which\n\nhe was master; and many anecdotes are told, illustrative of his powers\n\nof repartee. But to the weak and unprotected, he was and is invariably\n\nconsiderate and kind. In proof of this, it may be mentioned here, that\n\nwhen he learned thro Col. Banks, of Columbus, Ga., that Mrs. Dill,\n\n(whom he and others rescued from the Indians in Florida, in 1818,) was\n\nstill living at or near Fort Gaines, he immediately transmitted, thro the\n\nwriter of this, a sum of money to Col. Banks, for the relief of the old\n\nladys necessities.\n\nFew men have had better opportunities for studying the Indian char\n\nacter and investigating their customs, than Gen. Woodward. Very early\n\nin life, as appears from two autobiographical letters which were received\n\nat so late a day as to compel their insertion in the Appendix to this little\n\nvolume, he was brought into contact with the Red Man; and, stirred by\n\nthe Indian blood in his own veins, he studied his character and tradi\n\ntions lovingly and earnestly. His early appointment to the command of\n\na body of friendly Indians, in time of war, proves that he was consid\n\nered to know them and to have influence over them.\n\nAs to the consideration in which Gen. Woodward was held by his\n\nsuperiors, it is not improper to state that the writer of this has now in\n\nhis possession an original letter from Gen. Jackson, speaking of Gen.\n\nW., as \"a brave, intrepid and gallant soldier.\" It bears date, \"Nashville,\n\nSeptember 30, 1819.\"\n\nIt is a matter of great regret to the writer, that many errors have un\n\navoidably crept into the publication. The difficulty of decyphering In\n\ndian and other proper names has been the chief cause. Some of the\n\nprincipal are \"Danville\" instead of Greenville, on page 5; \"Anderson\"\n\nDexter instead of Andrew Dexter, on same page; \"Vaugh\" instead of\n\nVaughn, on page 9; on same page, \"lettered Birch instead of Beech;\n\non page 16, \"Polander\" instead of Hollander; and on page 25, \"Simo-\n\nnides\" instead of Seminoles.\n\nIn conclusion, the writer of this would remark, that he believes that\n\nthe unpretending pages which follow contain a very great deal o_f mat\n\nter of high historical value to the people of Alabama and Georgia. For\n\nthat reason, he has taken the trouble to collect such of the Letters as\n\nhad been published previously and to induce Gen. Woodward to write\n\nothers. For the task of arranging, pruning, etc., he has had neither time\n\nnor health; but he trusts that even in their present crude form, they\n\nmay effect much good, in the correction of several popular errors and\n\nin familiarising our people with the later history of those tribes that\n\nhave recently departed from our borders.\n\nMontgomery, Ala., Jan. 15, 1859.\n\nJ. J. HOOPER.\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nWHEELING, WINN PARISH, LA. ) May 2, 1857. $\n\nE. HANRICK, ESQ. My Old Friend: The Montgomery Mail comes occasionally directed to me at this office; and, whether the paper is paid for or not, I am unable to say, though I requested a gentleman to do so, and he says the money was forwarded. If such is not the case, call on the Editor and pay what is due, and also pay for another years subscription, and write to me at this office, and you shall have your money immediately. It is through the Mail I frequently hear you are living, which I hope will be the case for many years to come. My friend, how time and things have changed since first we met! I think it has been forty years, the last winter, since I first saw you, at Granville, Pitt county, N. C., rolling tar barrels. And your city, Montgomery, about that time, or shortly after, was started, or begun, by Anderson Dexter, and now, I suppose, is one of the most desirable spots in the Southwest. I knew the spot where Montgomery stands before any white man ever thought of locating there. When I look back on things as they then were and what they are now, it makes me feel as I am old. You and I have lived in fast times, which our heads will show, my friend; so, let it rock on we will only sleep the sounder when it comes to our time to rest. I also see announced in the Mail the death of several old friends, among them Gen. Shackelford, whom I have known from my boyhood. I was with him in Florida, in 1812, in an\n\n6\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nexpedition against the Seminoles. There are but few of that detachment of Georgians now living in fact, I know of none, unless it be Dr. Fort, of Macon, Ga., John H. Howard, of Columbus, Ga., Col. R. Broadnax, of Ala., and myself. If there are any more of them, it is very few, and I have lost the hang of them; but, should I live, I will be in Milledgeville, Ga., on the first day of July, 1862, which will be fifty years from the time we started on that expedition. If you are then living in Montgome ry, I will give you a call.\n\nI also see that my old friend, Major Thomas M. Cowles, is no more. He was a good man I knew him before he was a man. He was fit to live in any country that God may think proper to occupy with honest men. He be longed to my staff, and accompanied me to Fort Mitchell, with an escort under the command of Gen. Wm. Taylor, to conduct Gen. LaFayette to Montgomery. I shall never forget a visit that Major Cowles and myself paid to Billy Weatherford, the Quadroon, him about whom so much has been said and so little known. We remained some days, and among our crowd were Zach. McGirth, Davy Tait, the half-brother to Weatherford, old Sam. Moniac, who, many years before, had accompanied Alex. McGillivray to New York, in General Washingtons time. I have often thought that I would give you and friend Hooper, of the Mail, a little sketch of what I had learned from those men and others, in relation to Indian matters; but they are all dead, and what I have heard and know, would, in many instances, contradict what has gone to the world as history, and I do not know that mankind would be better off, even if I could undeceive and give them what I do know in relation to Indian history, and so -I will let it pass. But, still, there is one thing I want, if it can be got hold of, and, if George Stiggins is living in your country, he has it. It is a manuscript given to me by the widow of CoL Hawkins. It is in the hand-writing of Christian Limbo, -who lived with Col. Hawkins many years. It was copied from Col. Hawkins own manuscript,\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n7\n\nwhich was burned shortly after his death. I knew Col. Hawkins well. He knew more about Indians and Indian history, and early settlements and expeditions of the several European nations that undertook to settle colonies in the South and Southwest, than all the men that ever have or will make a scrape of a pen upon the subject. The loss of his papers was certainly a very great loss to those who would wish to know things as they really were, and not as they wished them. Stiggins, you know, had some learning, and and was a half breed of the Netchis tribe, tho raised among the Creeks. He spoke of writ ing a history of the Creeks and other Southern tribes, and I loaned him my papers. 1 presume he has done by this time what he contemplated, and please see him and get my papers, if you can, and take care of them until you have a chance to send them to me. You will also find among the papers some in my hand-writing, that I intended for a Mr. Daniel K. Whitaker, of Charleston, S. C., who was concerned in a Southern literary journal.\n\n* * * * * * * *. * .\n\nYours, truly, old friend, THOS. S. WOODWARD.\n\nWHEELING, WINN PARISH, LA., December 9, 1857.\n\nE. HANRICK, ESQ. : My Old Friend: Your letter came to hand safe, after\n\ntaking its time, as I have, in going through the world, quite leisurely. You will find five dollars enclosed: pay yourself, and hand the other two and a half to the editor of the Mail: say to him, that after he has worked that out, and he learns that I have not worked out, he may con tinue to send his paper. I see my letter to you, of May last, in the Mail. The editor speaks in very flatteringterms of my capability in giving sketches and making\n\n8\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nthem accurate and interesting. I would be proud that I could do so, and prove to his readers that he was not mis taken. It is true, I have known Alabama a great while, and many of its earliest settlers particularly Indians and Indian countrymen. And I would most willingly, if I thought any facts that have come within my knowledge, or circumstances related to me by others in whom I could place the most implicit reliance, would be interesting to the readers of the Mail, give them. But as I write no better than in my younger days, but much worse; and as anything I might write would to most persons be of little interest, I must now abandon it. Besides, you know my capacity for embelishment (the only thing that suits too many readers,) is not such as would render my sketches very interesting to many. I have no doubt but that, if I could be with you, and many more old acquaintances that I left in Alabama, (and hope they still live,) and could get around a lightwood fire, I could interest you or, at least, spin over old times and bring many things to your recollection that you have forgotten. (I do not allude to old store accounts. Though you have lost many, I never heard of your forgetting one.)\n\nI often wish myself back in Alabama, and have as often regretted leaving Tuskegee. I was the founder of Tuskegee. I selected the place for the county site, or place for the court house, in 1833. I built the first house on that ridge, though James Dent built the first house on the court house square, after the lots were laid off. The day I made the selection, there was a great ball-play with the Tuskegees, Chunnanuggees, Chehaws and Tallesees. A Col. Deas, a South Carolinian, was with me. Ned, those were good days, were they not? I can never recall them, nor many other things that were very cheering to me then. I wonder if my five cedar trees, that I planted at the McGarr place when I owned it, are living yet? Ned, I, in company with my family, old Aunt Betsy Kurnells, (or Connells,) Tuskeneha, and old John McQueen, dug up those cedars, when they were very small,\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nV\n\nfrom ttnder a large cedar that shaded the birth-place of Ussa Yoholo, or, Black Drink, who, after the murder of General Thompson, in Florida, was known to the world as Oceola. This man was the great grand-son of James McQueen. You knew his father the little Englishman, Powell. His mother was Polly Copinger. The rail road from Montgomery to West Point runs within five feet, if not over the place, where the cabin stood in which Billy Powell, or Ussa Yoholo, was born. The old cedar was destroyed by Gen. Mclvers negroes, when grading the road. It was in an old field, between the Nufaupba (what is now called Ufaupee), and a little creek that the Indians called Catsa Bogah, which mouths just below where the rail road crosses Nufaupba; and on the Mont gomery side of Nufaupba, and on a plantation owned by a Mr. Vaugh, when I left the country, rests the remains of old James McQueen, a Scotchman, who died in 1811, aged from what Col. Hawkins and many others said he was 128 years. He informed Col. Hawkins that he was born 1683, and came into the Creek nation in 1716, a de serter from an English vessel anchored at St. Augustine, East Florida, for striking a naval officer. When I plant ed those cedars, I had a wife and three children. I thought, then, to make at the foot of one of them a rest ing place. But more than twenty years have elapsed, and many changes have taken place with me and those that were with me then, and I care but little now when or where I may be picked up. But still, I would be glad to know that the cedars were spared; for, none who knew the hands of those that assisted me in planting them there, could think of molesting them unless, there should be one with a marring hand, like him that destroyed the old lettered birch at the old Federal crossing of the Per simmon creek, and the old Council Oak that once stood in front of Suckey Kurnells or Connells house, which you knew well. Yes, it was under that oak, where you and I have heard many a good yarn spun, both by our white as well as red friends many of whom have long since\n\n10\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\ngone to that world of which we read and talk so much, and so much dreaded by many, (if not more,) and which never can be known to living man. Yes, friend, it was under that oak held as sacred by the Indians, and should have been as memorable among Alabamians, as the old Charter Oak of New England was, among the people of the North where you and I have aided in plac ing the brand of Molly Thompson upon many a black bottle. I rented out the plantation one year, while I own ed it, and forbid the tree being touched. The man rent ing it complained so much about its shading his crops, I allowed either three or five dollars for it, I now forget which, and would now pay $100 to have it living, as it was when I left the place, were it possible to restore it. You have often heard our mutual friend, old Capt. Billy Walker, tell about him and myself, camping there with Cols. Hawkins, Barnett and McDonald, of the army, and Gen. John Sevier, one of the heroes of Kings Mountain. (Col. Barnett was the father of Tom. and Nat. Barnett.) On the side of the Indians there were Billy Mclntosh, Big Warrior, Alex. Kurnells, and many others. Kurnells was the interpreter, wearing that Iroquois coat you have often seen in the possession of the big woman, his wife. On that occasion, Kurnells exhibited many Indian curi osities ; among them was the bucks horn, resembling a mans hand, which you have seen in my possession since. Some years ago I gave the horn to Bishop Soule, of Nash ville. There is not an Indian in the Creek nation that ever visited Alex. Kurnells, but would recognize the horn as quick as you would your horse shoe. Gen. Sevier lived but a few days after this, and his remains lie in the hill near old Fort Decatur; but not a stone or board marks the resting place of the patriot, which is the case with hundreds of others that lived in his day, and like himself, served their country for their countrys good, and not their own.\n\nThis is becoming tedious to you, no doubt, and I must stop. But you can excuse it, as I live alone and have so\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n11\n\nlittle to employ my time about, that my mind is often led to contemplate things that have passed and would have been forgotten, but for my lonely situation. It affords me some satisfaction to think and talk, (when I meet an old friend,) of old times; and after commencing to write, these old things would appear, and I felt bound to give them some attention.\n\nYours, T. S. W.\n\nWINN PARISH, LA., Dec. 24, 1857. J. J. HOOPER, ESQ. :\n\nI wrote a letter to my old friend, E. Hanrick, of Mont gomery, last May, in which I spoke of giving you some few sketches of Indians and their history. Why I alluded to these things, I had a short time before seen an extract in your paper taken, I think, from a Mobile paper, mak ing some inquiry about the true meaning or the signifi cation of Alabama. And from the article, I supposed the writer to think that the word Alabama was of the Jewish origin, by giving the name of Esaus wife, who spelt her name Al-i-ba-ma, (if she could spell.) Now whether she borrowed her name from Jedediah Morse, or he the name from her, it matters not, as both spell it alike. The word Alabama, and many other words among the Indians, as well as customs, have been seized upon by some to estab lish a fact that never existed: that is, to prove that the North American Indians descended from the Lost Tribes of Israel. Now it would be as easy to prove that such tribes never existed, and much easier to prove that they dwin dled away among those Eastern nations that frequently held them in bondage, than to prove that anything found in the native Indian is characteristic of the Jew. I have traveled among a great many tribes, and circumcision is unknown to them; and besides, an Indian in his native\n\n12\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nstate is proverbial for his honesty, and from the records handed to us as authentic, the great Author of all nature was put to much trouble to keep the Jews and the prop erty of their neighbors in their proper places.\n\nI will return to my letter. I see it published in an October number of your paper, and shortly after its ap pearance, I received a letter from a Mr. J. D. Driesbach, of Baldwin Co., Ala., requesting me to give him what in formation I could of the persons whose names were men tioned in my letter to Mr. Hanrick, and any thing I knew of Indians and their history that I thought would be in teresting; also, informing me that he had seen in the possession of Joseph Stiggins, the son of Geo. Stiggins, a manuscript of George Stiggins, which had been loaned to Col. Pickett when he wrote the History of Alabama: and whether interesting or not, I scribbled off some twenty or thirty pages and sent to him, and among other things I gave him what I understood to be the origin of Alabama, as we have it from the Indians. I find in Col. Picketts answer to Mr. Hobbs, that he agrees with me how Ala bama took its name. I am satisfied that Col. Pickett is correct. I also stated to Mr. Driesbach, that I had heard Col. Hawkins say in his time, that he had made every inquiry in his power to ascertain if Alabama had any other meaning than the mere name of an Indian town, but never could, unless the name as it was possible might be the Indian corruption of the Spanish words for good water, though he doubted that.\n\nCol. Pickett is correct, as to the Alabama Town being just below Montgomery, for I was at it when they lived there, and it was called Ecanchatty, from the red bluffs on which a portion of Montgomery is built. The Tarwassaw Town was a little lower down the river than the Colo nel has it, though it is a matter of no importance. The Autauga, or what the Indians called Autauga or Dumplin Town, was at the place where Washington is in Autauga county. The Alabamas, and those little towns connected with them, extended down the river as far as Beach\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n13\n\ncreek, that mouths just above Selma, and up the river to where Coosawda is on the Autauga side. To spell it the way the Indians pronounced it, and the way Col. Hawkins spelt, is Coowarsartda. The Alabamas differed from the Musqua or Muscogees, as do the Choctaws from the Chickasaws; but were what the Indians call the \"same fire-side\" people. There was much of their dialect that differed from that of the common Creek, or Musqua, as the Western Indians used to call them, and no doubt once they were a different tribe.\n\nAbout the close of the American Revolution, a large portion of the Alabamas and Coowarsartdas returned to Texas on the Trinity, being under the control of a Chief called Red Shoes, or Stillapikachatta. I visited these Indians in 1816, in company with Mr. Angus Gilchrist and Mr. Edward IVIcLauchlin. Mr. McLauchlin was the best Indian interpreter I ever knew, except Hamly, who was raised by Forbes and Panthon, in Florida. Red Shoes was then living, and lived for years after. I inquir ed much into his history and that of his people. He gave the same account of their being driven from their old homes in the West and their settlement in Alabama and a part of Georgia, as has been given me by the Creeks. And if Indian tradition and what I have heard from Col. Hawkins who, I think, was the most sensible man I ever was acquainted with, and whose opportunities were as good if not much better than any one else of his day pos sessed, to collect correct information in relation to the early settlements of the Creeks and their confederates in Alabama and Georgia are to be relied on, Col. Pickett must have been wrongly informed as to the fights with the Muscogees and Alabamas upon the sources of Red river, as well as to the Muscogees settling in Ohio, the Alabamas settling on the Yazoo, and the destruction of their fort by DeSoto, and the Alabamas being the first to settle in what is now known to us as the Creek country.\n\nIt has always been a contested point, with the Indians, whether Tuckabatchee, or old Cusetaw opposite Fort\n\n14\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nMitchell on the Chattahoochee river, was settled first; but it is generally conceded that Cusetaw was settled first. These two towns have, in almost every instance, furnished the head Chiefs of the nation: Tuckabatchee furnishing the upper town Chief Cusetaw, the lower town Chief. This fact is well known to all who have been well acquainted with the Creeks. Besides, John Ferdinand Soto, who by most persons has been called Hernanda DeSoto, after landing his forces in Florida, passed through a portion of Georgia, and across the entire State of Alabama, before he could have reached the Yazoo in Mississippi. And in addition to this, one of the severest battles Soto had with the Indians, was fought with the Creeks at what is now known as Cuwally. It is either in Montgomery or Tallapoosa county; I do not now know how the county lines run. Cuwally is a name given it by the whites, not knowing how to give it the Indian pronunciation. To spell it as the Indians pro nounced it, it would be Thleawalla, which signifies rolling \"bullet. Thlea, is an arrow or bullet; walla, is to roll. The Indians say it was there that a spent ball was seen rolling on the ground, and from that the place took its name. Besides, the Tuckabatchees have now in their possession a number of plates of copper in various shapes, which the Spaniards used as a kind of sheld, to protect themselves from the arrows of the Indians. These plates were taken from the Spaniards at that fight. And from what Col. Pickett says of the fights upon the sources of Red River it would appear that the Indians were some years on their route going East. I have not seen nor heard any tradition ary account of any thing of the sort in my intercourse with the various tribes that I have been among, and the sources of Red River must have been very imperfectly known in that day, by any of the Europeans that had visited this country, and are still very imperfectly known by many of our own people to this day; for Red river does not, as believed by many, head in the Rocky Moun tains, but is a mere leak or drain from the prairies, except\n\nR E M I N I S C E N C E.S .\n\n15\n\nthose little streams that head in the Ozark hills of Arkan sas. Besides, it is not such a country as Indians would likely stop long in, particularly traveling on foot, as they were obliged to do; for the Southwestern Indians knew nothing of horses until they were introduced into the country by the Spaniards. And building forts with logs, by a people who knew nothing of the uses of the axe, nor had any, would, I think, be a tough undertaking. All that I have seen and heard satisfies me at least, that the Creeks, Alabamas and the other little bands connected with them, originally inhabited the skirts of timbered country between the Rio Grande or Del Norte and the Mississippi river, near the Gulf coast, which the names of the creeks, rivers, and many other things, will show. The Choctaws, Chickasaws, Nitches, Nacogdoches and Natchitoches Indians inhabited pretty much the same country.\n\nIt is true that Cortez found a much more civilized and much more timid race to contend with, than any of the tribes that I have mentioned. And that the Creeks. Alabamas and others that I have named, ever were or con sidered themselves subjects of the great Mexican Empire, I am very much inclined to doubt, from what I know of them. Even the present civilized and christianized rulers of Mexico, who are almost to a man of the old race, never exercise any control over the Indians within her borders, and this has been the case ever since she got from under the Spanish yoke.\n\nI can neither read French nor Spanish; but the few trans lations in English that I have seen taken from the travels of the early visitors, both of the French and Spanish, to this country, are very contradictory, and for that reason I have been inclined to credit the Indian tradition. And, even if a history taken from European travelers, some what in the shape of a novel, is to be relied on, some man, in his account of the conquest of Florida, admits that the Creeks, Muscogees or Coosas disputed the passage of Soto through the country that is, Alabama and Georgia. It\n\n16\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nhas been a long time since I read it, and then but little; but if I am not mistaken, it spoke of a war, or battle, with a Chief called Tuscaloosa. The Creeks themselves said that there was once among them a giant Chief, Tustanugga Lusta, or Black Warrior, who fought with Soto, and that his home was on the river of that name. I have seen no history of Louisiana except the Tax Collectors Book and that I dislike to read and cannot say at what time Biennville and his brother. Iberville, came to the country. But one thing is certain, the French knew something of Mobile and its immediate vicinity at an early day; but they knew very little of the interior of Alabama, until after the defeat of Gen. Braddock, near Pittsburg, which was in 1755. The next year they come down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and drove the Nitches Indians from where the present city of Natchez. Miss., now is, The Nitches Indians immediately emigrated to join their old Western friends, the Creeks, and settle at the Talisee old fields, on Taliseehatchy or Talisee creek, now in Talladega county, Ala.; and the French very shortly after moved up the Alabama river, to the junction of Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers, and built a little village near to old Fort Jackson. I have seen Indians, as well as negroes, that traded with the French while there, though their stay was but a few years. James McQueen, a Scotch man the first white man I ever heard of being among the Creeks and a Polander, bv the name of Moniac, with the Nitches Indians and Creeks, broke up the French settlement at the fork of the rivers. And it was on the return of the French down the Alabama river, that they threw up an entrenchment at Durands or Durants Bend, and another at the mouth of Cahawba and the Alabama Indians were said to be the most bitter enemies, except the Nitches, that the French, had. We are to judge from Col. Picketts version of the matter, that there were neither Alabamas nor Muscogees in what is known to the whites as the Creek country, before Soto passed through. The Chattahoochee Indians, who were Muscogees, would\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n17\n\nshow, as long as they lived there, many places where DeSoto or Soto had camped. There is a place on the Apalachicola that is yet known as one of Sotos camps. The Indians call it Spanny Wakka that is, \"the Spaniards lay there.\" The Indians could tell of the old Spanish fortification in Jones county, Ga., also the one on the Ocmulgee, above Fort Hawkins, and it is evident they must have been in the country before Soto passed through and, besides, I was in Florida in 1818, and had with me many of the Creeks, who could point out places where the Spaniards, under Soto, had camped, and the marks of olds roads and causeways were then visible. And with the single exception of Soto himself, all the early explorers of that country, who were mostly Spanish and some French, would only ascend the navigable rivers a small distace, in water crafts constructed for the pur pose, and could have known but little of the Indians in the interior. And as to Red River, when Cortez conquer ed Mexico, it is a doubt with me if it was then a tributary of the Mississippi river, as the Atchafalaya evidently was once the channel of Red River, and made its way to the Gulf of Mexico through Berwicks Bay; and, even in Sotos time did it go into the Mississippi river, it could only have been navigated, with small crafts, as far up as Alexandria, for the river above the falls will show that it was once a raft, as far up as Long Prairie, in Arkansas, and that would have prevented early explorers from knowing much of the sources of the river or what Indians, if any, lived on it.\n\nAll these circumstances induce me to believe that Col. Pickett is mistaken, and the source from which he deriv ed a part of his information is, or was, not very reliable; and, so far as Indian tradition is concerned, I think my chance to have obtained correct information in relation to Indian history equal, at least, to that of Col. Picketts. The accounts that I have had from the Indians themselves, and from Col. Hawkins, whose opportunity must have been as good as any one of his time, or any one who has\n\n18\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nlived since, are, that Cortezs object was gold, and that the people he first encountered in Mezico were somewhat civilized and very timid; and, after subduing them and taking possession of the City of Mexico if it could be called a city he then commenced extending his con quests or robberies up the Gulf coast, in the direction of what is now Tampico and Tamaulipas, and even as far as what is now Texas, where he encountered the Musquas or Muscogees, Alabamas, and others that I have men tioned; but finding them to be a much more hardy, war like race than the Mexicans, and in order to hold on to what he had taken and subdued of the timid ones, he found it necessary to kill or drive these war-like tribes from the country, which with the great advantage of fire arms, he succeeded in doing. The Muscogees and their confederates crossed the Mississippi river and called a halt at Baton Rouge, which is known to this day as Red Stick or Club. The Nitches, from the river which bears their name in Texas, crossed the Mississippi river and settled where the city of Natchez is now. The Choctaws settled the country on Yazoo. Pearl, Leaf, Chickasawha, and as far as the Tombecba rivers. The Chickasaws set tled at Chickasaw Bluff or Memphis. The Creeks, after a short stay at Baton Rouge, moved and settled on the Alabama and its tributaries, the Black Warrior and the Chattahoochee, and Flint rivers, and, in time, went as far east as the Oconee river, but never went farther in that direction, and did not make any settlement on the Oconee until after the whites began to encroach on the Indians of that country from the East. The Indians that originally inhabited from the middle parts of the Carolinas (particu larly South Carolina,) and Georgia to the seaboard, were known as Yamacraws or Yamasees, Oconees, Ogeeches, and Sowanokees or People of the Glades. The Sowanokees are known as the Shawnees the other Indians know them by no other name to this day but Sowanokee; and the Savannah river was known as Sowanokee Hatchee Thlocka, which signifies the Big River of the\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n19\n\nGlades, or what we call Savannah. And these Indians\n\nthe Creeks found to be their equals as warriors; but when\n\nthe whites began to approach them from the east, and the\n\nCreeks already very close on the west, the Sowanokees or\n\nShawnees fell back on the north and northwest. Tecum-\n\nseh was of that stock. The other little tribes, with the\n\nUchees, they being the \"same fireside\" Indians with the\n\nShawnees, all dwindled away among the Creeks and lost\n\ntheir language, except the Uchees they still retain\n\ntheirs.\n\nOne other circumstance that convinces me that the\n\nCreeks and Alabamas had become pretty much one peo\n\nple before they settled Alabama and Georgia, is that the\n\ntribes they incorporated into their nation after settling\n\nthe Creek country never would come into the family\n\narrangement, which arrangement I will try and explain\n\nto you. They were laid off in families that is, Bears,\n\nWolves, Panthers, Foxes, and many others also, what\n\nthey termed the Wind Family, which was allowed more\n\nauthority than any family in the nation. There was\n\nnothing in their laws to prevent blood cousins from mar\n\nrying, but never to marry in the same family thus, a man\n\nof the Bear family could marry a woman of the Fox fami\n\nly, or any other family he pleased, and the children would\n\nbe called Fox. In all cases, the children took the moth\n\ners family name. Years ago, you could not find an\n\nIndian in the nation but could tell you his family. But\n\nwhisky has destroyed many of their old customs as well\n\nas the Indians themselves.\n\nThere is too much of this to publish, even if it were\n\nworth publishing. Read it, show it to Col. Pickett, burn\n\nit and send me his History of Alabama.\n\nYours,\n\nT. S. W.\n\n20\n\nREMINISCENCES\n\nWINN PARISH, LA., Jan. 10, 1858. To J. J. HOOPER, ESQ. :\n\nI wrote to you some time back some sketches relative to the Creek Indians, which no doubt you found too long, too tedious, and too uninteresting to publish. In that I sent you I made mention of a family arrangement among the Creeks that differed from all other tribes that I know or have traveled among. The Creeks are laid off in fam ilies, viz: Bears, Tigers, Wolves, Foxes, Deers, and al most all the animals that were known to them. All these families had certain privileges, and every one of a family knew to what family he belonged and what privileges were allowed. There was also what they termed the Wind family, which was allowed more privileges than all the rest. For instance, when an offender escaped from justice, all the families were permitted to pursue a certain number of days, and no more, except the Wind family, which had the right to pursue .and arrest at any time there was no limit to their privileges in bringing an offender to justice. There was nothing to prevent blood relations from marrying with each other, but a wo man of the Bear famliy was at libery to take a husband in any family except a Bear; so it was with all the other families, but none were permitted to marry in the same family; for instance, if a man of the Wolf family marry a woman of the Fox family, the children would all be Foxes. Such has been the custom among the Creeks from the earliest history I have had of them, though their intercourse with the whites has changed many of their old habits and customs even since my time. In fact, I know a number of words in their language and names of things and places that are not spoken or pronounced as they were when I first knew them. This has been occa sioned by the whites not being able to give the Indian\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n21\n\npronunciation, and the Indians in many cases have con formed to that of the whites. A horse, for instance, is now called Chelocko by the whites who speak Indian, and by most of the Indians; but originally it was Echo Tlocko, signifying a Big Deer Echo is a deer and Thlocko is something large. The first horses the Creeks ever saw were those introduced by the Spaniards, and they called them big deer, as they resembled that animal more than any other they knew this is their tradition, and I am satis fied that it is correct. There is the Indian town above Montgomery, Coowersartda, that is called by the whites Coosada; also the town Thleawalla, where Soto fought the Creeks, it is called by the whites Cuwally, and many of the Indians raised of late years call it as the whites do, and do not know what\" its original name was, nor what its meaning is. Thlea is an arrow or bullet, and Walla is to roll; the proper name is Rolling Bullet; and many other such alterations have been made that have come within my knowledge. Indians in almost every instance learn our language quicker than we learn theirs, particu larly our pronunciation. An Indian, if he speaks our language at all, almost invariably pronounces it as those do from whom he learns it. If he learns it from a white man that speaks it well, the Indian does the same; if he learns it from a negro he pronounces as the negro does. You may take the best educated European that lives, that does not speak our language, and an Indian that does not speak it; let both learn it; if the Indian does not learn so much, he will always speak what he does learn more distinctly than the European. This will no doubt be dis puted by many, but I know it to be true from actual ob servation, and I do not pretend to account for why it is so, unless it is intended that at some time Americans shall all be Americans.\n\nI believe I mentioned the name of James McQueen be fore. This man came amongst the Creeks as early as 1716 and lived among them until 1811. He was said to be, by those who knew him well, very intelligent, and\n\n2\n\n22\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nhad taken great pains to make himself acquainted with the history of the Creeks. From the early day in which he came among them, and they knowing at that time but little of the whites, their traditions were, no doubt, much more reliable than anything that can now be obtained from them. From what I have learned from this man, or from those who learned it from him, the Muscogees, or as they were originally known to the other tribes, Musquas, and all the little towns or bands that com posed the Creek Confederacy, was a Confederacy before they crossed to the east of Mississippi river. From what I have been able to learn, Musqua, or Muscogee, signified Independent. Besides I knew a Capt. John S. Porter, formerly of the U. S. Army, who, some thirty years ago, with a few Creeks of the Mclntosh party in Arkansas, visited California and went up the Pacific coast to the Columbia river, and returned by the way of Salt Lake, and on his return to Arkansas he wrote to me, giving an account of his travels. The writing covered some three or four sheets of paper; a great deal of it was very interesting. I do not now recollect whether I loaned it to George Stiggins, or a Mr. Whitaker, of Charleston, S. C. But I recollect among the many accounts of his travels, that on the head waters, or at least the waters of the Colorado of the West, he found a small remnant of the original Musqua. They spoke mostly a broken Span ish dialect, but still retained much of their old language and old family customs. They gave pretty much the same account of being driven from their old homes that I have learned from the Creeks. These people informed Capt. Porter that their nation was once strong, and they had many languages; that they inhabited the country between the Rio del Norte and Mississippi river, or Owea Coafka, or river of cane. They also gave him the original Indian name of the Del Norte, but I forget it; but Owea Coafka is what the Creeks call the Mississippi river. They also stated to him that they lived near the Gulf, on what they called Owea Thlocko Marhe, signifying the\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n23\n\nlargest water. They say they were driven off by the Echo Thlock Ulgees, or horsemen, or what the Creeks in our lauguage would call the big deer men. Echothlock is a big deer, as I stated before, and the proper name of the horse Echothlock; Ulgee* means horsemen. They also stated that long after they left their old homes, and horses had become plenty, that the Indians learned the use of them, and that a number of the little tribes that once lived on the rivers and Gulf had taken to the prairies. They also gave Capt. Porter an account of a long war with some tribes high up on the Rio del Norte, and that one of the most warlike tribes had gone east. They call ed them as the present Creeks do, Hopungieasaw, and what are now known to the whites as Pyankeshaws. I recollect two women that Tuskenea carried to the Creek nation, of the Pyankeshaws, as the whites called them, but the Creeks call them Hopungieasaw, or dancing Indians.\n\nYou see that I differ with Col. Pickett as to the early settlement of the Creek Indians in Alabama; and should I be correct, it need not matter with the Colonel, for you know most people believe a history whether it be correct or not. I have not seen his History of Alabama, and all I have seen or heard from him, was his answer to Mr. Hobbs inquiry; and I have no idea that he has written anything but he felt authorized to do from the sources that he received his information. But authors sometimes may err, and others wilfully misrepresent. When that is the case, we have to judge from circumstances. The Colonel says that Soto passed Alabama before the Muscogees reached that country. The Indians say they were there and fought him: and from the number of copper shields, with a small brass swivel, (that an old man by the name of Tooley worked up into bells,) would go to show and to prove that the Indians were correct. I have often seen the copper plates or shields, and a piece of the swiv el, and from the cuttings or carvings on it, it was evident-\n\n* Ulgee is rather a Creek termination which applies the antecedent\n\ndescription to a person or persons. It answers to our tan. A Creek\n\nwould call a CaroKmos a CaroYmulgee.\n\nH.\n\n24\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nly of Spanish make. And it was only some twenty years after Cortez conquered Mexico, that Soto commenced his march from Tampa Bay, and had too few men to sacri fice them in storming a strong work, when it could effect nothing, for an Indian Fort in a remote wilderness could have interfered but little with his march westward. And how could the Alabamas have known that he intended passing that way? It seems to me that a people so illy prepared to build forts; having no axes, spades nor any implement of the sort, would have found it much easier to have concealed themselves, had it been necessary, in some of those large swamps which abound in the Yazoo country; and from what I know of Indians, they would not give one swamp or cane brake for forty forts. And as to the Muscogees ever having been subjects of the great Mexi can empire, it is very doubtful, for Mexico was the name of the City itself, and applied to the town only. It was the city or town where the principal chiefs or body of the Aztecs, Anahuacs, or as the other Indians called them, Auchinang resided.\n\nThe Creeks or Muscogees, the Iroquois or Six Nations, were all the Indians that I have known or heard of form ing themselves into anything like a confederacy. The balance, as far as my information extends, have been sep arate tribes, with a separate language, with their own pe culiar customs, except in a few instances where two or more tribes would unite in case of a war. The Creeks, as I mentioned before, originally inhabited the skirts of timbered country bordering on the Gulf of Mexico, and between the Del Norte and Mississippi rivers. When the Muscogees, N itches, Choctaws and Chickasaws crossed to the east of the Mississippi river, a town of Indians yet among the Creeks, the Autisees or Otisees, has for ages been called Red Stick. They settled at Baton Rouge; and no doubt ft was from that tribe or town that the early French settlers gave it its present name. Eto-chatty, signifies .red tree or red wood; but ask an Indian that is acquainted with the original names and customs, what a\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n25\n\nRed Stick Warrior, is, and he will tell you it is an Autisee or Otisee. I have taken great pains, in times passed, to have these things explained to me by the oldest and most sensible Indians and Indian countrymen. The Muscogees, from their own account, made but a short stay on the Mississippi or its waters. They emigrated to Alabama and Georgia, and settled mostly on the large creeks and rivers and near the falls and shoals, for the purpose of fishing. The Indians who inhabited the Gulf coast, and that of the Atlantic as far east as Beaufort, S. C, and the rivers as far back as latitude 33 north, previous to the settlement of the Muscogees in the country, were known as Paspagolas, Baluxies. Movilas, Apilaches, Hichetas, Uchys, Yemacraws, Wimosas, Sowanokas or Shawneys. Sowanoka Hatchy is the original name of Savannah river; that is, the river of the glades.\n\nThe Seminoles is a mixed race of almost all the tribes I have mentioned, but mostly Hitchetas and Creeks. The Hitchetas have by the whites been looked upon as being originally Muscogees, but they were not. They had an entirely different language of their own, and were in the country when the Creeks first entered it. : Seminole, in the Creek language, signifies wild, or runaway, or outlaw.\n\nThere have many conflicting accounts about John Ferdinand Soto when, where and how he died, and where buried. According to McQueens account, and that of the oldest Indians in the nation when he came to it, Soto died in what is called Natchitoches parish, in this State, at the last fort he built, called the Azadyze; and the oldest Spanish settlers of this country have cor roborated McQueens account. There are yet to be found among the people of this country, some of the descend-1 ants of Sotos tnen, and some of his name. All the Indian traditions, and those of the early Spanish settlers, say he died and was buried at Azadyze. It is now 142 years since McQueen first came to the Creek country, and In dians that were then living even at the age of 75 years, could give a very correct tradition of things that had\n\n26\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nhappened only 80 or 100 years before. Indians are very\n\nparticular in their relations of circumstances and events.\n\nand not half so apt to embellish as the whites, and the\n\nmarch of Soto through their country, and his fights with\n\nthem, were affairs not likely to be forgotten by them,\n\nand would be handed down for a generation or two at\n\nleast, very correct, no doubt. Even in my time, I have\n\nheard the old Indians, in their conversations, allude to\n\nthe white warrior, or Tustanugga Hatke. as they called\n\nSoto.\n\nYou see I write, spell and dictate badly, but have given\n\nyou what I heard from others who were best calculated\n\nto inform me upon such subjects. If there is anything\n\nin this that you have not seen or heard before, and you\n\nthink it worth publishing, do so; if not, let it pass: for\n\nI assure you that I am not desirous to become conspicuous as\n\na writer in a newspaper, or anything else though I\n\ndoubt much if the man lives that has seen as much of old\n\nIndian times, and heard as much of the early history of\n\nthe Creeks, as I have. I would like to be where I could\n\nsit and tell it over to you; I could make you understand\n\nit much better.\n\nMay you live long and die rich.\n\nT. S. W.\n\nWHEELING, WINN PARISH, LA., } March 21, 1858. }\n\nTo J. J. HOOPER, ESQ. Dear Sir--Some two weeks back I received the History\n\nof Alabama, sent me by my old friend \"Horse Shoe Ned.\" It is a present made me by its Author whom I have known from his childhood, and of course prize it highly, not only as a present from its author, but for the many new things to me that it contains. I should have com menced this sooner, but my son who resides near Hot Springs, Arkansas, and the only one of my family that is left me, has been with me for the last three weeks and has just left for his home. That, with my inability to\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n27\n\nwrite at best, will make this not very interesting to you or your readers. What I write I dedicate to those that read it. You will see from what I write, and from what I may write hereafter, that I differ from Col. PICKETT, and what I write is not intended, nor can it detract in the least from Col. PICKETT, as an author, a gentleman, or a scholar. I am not vain enough to think that I could write anything like a history of any country (even if all I should write were true) that would be interesting, while Col. PICKETT is very capable of doing it; he has not only the advantages of a classical education, but was raised by one of the most intelligent fathers in Alabama; and as to his mother, she has had her equals no doubt, but there is no one living that can boast of a mother that was her superior. As to my own parents, I can say nothing more than I recollect to have seen them and the only brother I ever had, laid in their last resting place, within six miles of where Savannah river takes its name. My father died in Franklin county, Georgia, near sixty years back; my brother about fifty-six years; my mother about fifty-three years back leaving an only sister and myself, upon the charity of the best world that I have seen, or any one else, if they will take it right. Now, sir, my whole his tory through life (though passing through some pretty rough scenes by-the-by) would not be as interesting as the lives of Washington and Marion, by Old Parson Weems; so I will close my own biography, and commence with De Sotos march through Florida.\n\nTampa Bay is the point, admitted by all, where Soto (as I shall call him) debarked his men. His army, com posed of one thousand men, some on horseback and some on foot, greyhounds as fleet as the wind, bloodhounds largs and ferocious, and in addition to all these, were lots of Catholic priests, clergymen and monks. This was certainly a very imposing show, and was a show very well calculated and no doubt did impose upon the unoffend ing natives, and the tons of iron, handcuffs, chains, neckcollars and the like, were things well calculated to\n\n28\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\ninspire the natives with very exalted notions of the Christianity they were soon to be taught. No doubt but that portion of the narrative is in a great measure true; so far as regards the true motives of those that set the expedition on foot. The object was gold or other plun der, and to diffuse among the natives a religion (as then understood and practiced by those who were to propagate it) that even had more laudable means been used to establish it, would have benefited the Indians very little more, if as much, as the worst pagan idolatry. And it is equally as shameful as true, that other Christian nations have followed the example of Spain, with the natives of this and other countries; wherever the Bible (which was seldom applied right) failed, the musket and bayonet were resorted to. The hogs and cattle are next: the introduc tion of those animals was the only philanthropic move ment during, or that attended, the expedition. These animals were landed as it appears, as early as May, 1539, and Soto died between the last of May, 1542 and the 2d July, 1543. No date given of their leaders death, unless we infer from the dates given in the narrative that he died between the last of May, 1542, at which time he com menced the building of the brigantine, and the 1st of June, 1542, which was the time his successor commenced his march again in the wilderness, which was one day only for commencing the work, for Soto to die, to be put in the water, and his successor to march with the remainder of the soldiers. The portion of the history I have just alluded to, you will find on pages 50 and 51, first volume. Now had Col. PICKETT made a little blunder like this, I should not have noticed it, for I know him to be much clearer of committing such blunders than I can think my self to be, (I no doubt could prove that by you.) You will find the day and month given in many places; but the hero of the expedition dies, the day, month, or year is not named. I notice this to show that Portuguese and Span ish authors at all times are not to be relied on. Now, sir, I have traveled through Florida, Georgia, Alabama,\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n29\n\nMississippi, Arkansas, and am pretty well acquainted with most of the neighborhoods that the history says Soto traveled through. Now, the idea of marching an army of a thousand men, making the marches as the his tory describes, and raising hogs, feeding on them, divid ing them with the Indians, many left to be killed and packed up by the successor of Soto, and his men to feed on while at sea! Now, as this is a swine story, not writ ten by St. Mark, I hope I may be at least permitted to doubt it, without sinning. There was the Christian Jean Ortez, who was a captive long enough to become so well acquainted with the language of the Florida Indians, which must have been the Yermacraws or flat-footed Yemassees, for they evidently were the first Indians that in habited East Florida, the low parts of Georgia, and South Carolina, so far as we know; if not, then it must have been the Uchys, or Sowanokees, or Shawnese, for they were then nearest neighbors; we find this man Ortez in terpreting, making speeches in Spanish, and in all the Indian dialects where De Soto passed. As I have lived longer among Indians than Ortez, and learned to speak so little, and it was not Sampson that killed the panther, I cannot be bound to believe that story, to be saved. Now, these same Portuguese and Spanish give us a description of the country they passed in the upper parts of Georgia and Alabama, and down to the waters of the Coosa. Now, every person that has read the history, and now knows the country, knows the account to be a highly ex aggerated one. As to the Indian temples, I have nothing to say; every one that has seen an Indian town, has seen an Indian temple. That mode of traveling in a chair, carried by four men, differs from any traveling among them that I have seen or heard of. Those large barns of corn never fell to their lots in my time, or any of those old ones that I have been acquainted with, so far as I could learn; besides, the country, a few little creek valleys excepted, is a very poor one that is, if you will examine\n\n30\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nthe description given by those Portuguese and Spanish gentry, and then examine the country itself.\n\nWhat I have written is to show that the great proba bility is, that these writers have not been faithful in their narrations. For I have traveled more or less in and among all the tribes south of latitude 36 north, and some north of that line, between Georgia and Rio del Norte, and I think I am somewhat acquainted with the Indian charac ter, and I am as certain of this as any one thing I never witnessed, viz: that De Soto, no other man, nor any set of men, could have reduced the Indians to such abject slave ry. There is not one Indian, male or female, in one hun dred, but would have put an end to their existence, rather than submit to such treatment. Even as late as 1836-7, I knew several Indian women who, rather than risk their children under the control of the Emigrating Indian Agent, put them to death, some of them large enough to walk; and these women had long been acquainted with the whites. In fact, I knew two men to kill themselves in Montgomery, rather than move, when their whole town people were along, and they not in any danger whatever. As long as ours has been a government, with so many tribes whose names have passed from the earth, there is not the mark of a pen, heiroglyphic, or any vestige whatever to show that such people ever were warmed by Gods sun, I have never seen the first North American Indian slave, unless it was in Barbour county, Alabama. At what was known as the Pea River Fight, there were some Indian children taken prisoners, and they were mostly girls. I was in Barbour county as late as 1843. I there saw one or two of the children. If they have not been made slaves, I never have heard of any. The peons or foot soldiers in Mexico and the degraded Central American States are not looked upon, or at least by me, as North American Indians. I have no doubt but the tribes inhab iting the tropical regions are much more submissive and timid than the hardy tribes inhabiting north and south of those regions. Besides, such gangs of priests, clergymen\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n31\n\nand monks, grey-hounds, blood-hounds, hand-cuffs, chains, neck-collars, (and such other holy material as De Soto in troduced among the native Floridians, Georgians and Alabamians,) were too freely used for the same purpose among the Mexicans and Central Americans; and the natives of those countries unfortunately lost their own language, and learned the language and embraced the religion of their oppressors, which has made them ten-fold worse than they were in their native state. You may take almost any other people that we read of and train them to be slaves, or at least make them perform those menial offices that slaves do; but such is never the case with an Indian. It is true, you may, by kind treatment, either in word or action, get them occasionally to perform some little offi ces; but harsh treatment, either in words or blows, never can control an Indian.\n\nNow, after De Soto and his men had been rusticating in the country of the Coosas, they make their way to the Tallassees. They reach the town on the 18th September, 1540. De Soto remained at Tallassee twenty days, crossed over to the east side in canoes and on rafts, and traveled down the eastern side. Now, to show you how those Por tuguese and Spaniards mistake things, Tallassee was al ways on the east side of the Tallapoosa, and Col. Pickett in a note of his own admits that Tuckabatchy was built on the opposite side, and all hands know that Tuck abatchy, Tookabatcha, was always on the west side. Now, there was no necessity for canoes and rafts after their stay of twenty days in Tallassee. Moreover, the river at that point is never past fording, only at a high stage of water. Besides, the season of the year in which De Soto was there, those who know the place will say to you that an Indian pony could ford it from Tallassee to Kings Ferry, which is full three miles by water. The Tallassees and Tuckabatchys were both original Musqua and Muscogees, and the oldest Indians and Indian countrymen that I have seen, say Tuckabatchy was settled years before Tallassee. I wrote you once before, that it was a long disputed point\n\n32\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nwith old Cusetaw and Tuckabatchee, which was settled\n\nfirst, but that it was generally conceded that the Cusetaws\n\nwere the Spoakogees, or Spoakookulgees; that is, the\n\noldest settlers, or the mother of towns.\n\nI know three men in Macon county who could have\n\ngiven Col. Pickett Indian information of modern times,\n\n(that is, for the last thirty years,) which is much more re\n\nliable than that he has had. I know something of the\n\nsettlement of the Tallassee town, opposite Tuckabatchy.\n\nI will give you, some time before long, the history of the\n\nsettlement of Tallassee, and how that error crept into Col.\n\nPicketts History.\n\nThe three gentlemen alluded to above, in Macon coun\n\nty, are Nat. and John Callens and L. B. Strange.\n\nI will here remark, that Col. Picketts History has set\n\nme right about the death of Alex. McGillivray. I had\n\nthought he died as late as 1796, but find he died three\n\nyears before. His daughter and his last wife, who lived\n\nby me for many years, could never tell; and if I ever\n\nheard from others I forgot it.\n\nI will in my next give you something of the Nitches,\n\nTallassees, and McGillivrays family.\n\nT. S. W.\n\nWHEELING, WINN PARISH, LA., 1 March 25, 1858. j\n\nEds. Mail:--I see in your paper of March the llth that \"]. W. K.\" seems desirous to know if can give the origin of the belief among the Chippewa Indians and he pre sumes among others that there is a deep gulf to be pass ed after death, before they can get to their Paradise. I answer him candidly that I can not, and beg to be excus ed for my profound ignorance on the subject. In the first place, the Chippewas are a people that I am as unac quainted with as I am of the gulf he speaks of. I have heard of both, but have seen neither. I am satisfied that\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n33\n\nsuch a people as the Chippewas do exist, for I have seen those that were said to have travelled among them, and I have seen and have travelled among several tribes of Indians and for that reason I am satisfied that there is such a tribe as the Chippewas. As to the gulf, both the wicked that have fallen in and the good that have crossed it, are the same to us, as neither ever return to give us any information as to what is in the gulf or what there is beyond it. So, if these Indians have such a belief, they must have borrowed it from those that knew as little of such things as themselves. And even those that have instructed the Indians in their belief (if such there be) may have formed their religious notions either from fear, ignorance or interest for, such has often been the case with those that pretend to much more than the native Indian. I have never heard of any such belief among those that I have been acquainted with; and those that I have conversed with upon religious subjects appeared to have correct notions of Deity looked upon Him as an invisible being, who only made himself known to man through his works. J. W. K. says in this can be traced a likeness to the Christian belief. Whence came it? I answer, not from the Jews. Why, not believing the American Indian to be a descendant of the Jew proves nothing for or against the Christian religion. The gen tleman says there is a marked resemblance in their laws with regard to marriages that the children of Israel were not allowed to take wives among other nations, and such was the law among Indians. Such may have been the case I will not dispute it. But, if such law ever existed, it was repealed long before my time; and if he will travel among them, and see the number of halfbreeds of whites, negroes, and all others that have mixed, and will say that the law has not been repealed, I am certain that he will have the candor to admit that it has been grossly violated, at least. There may be something a little alike in the character of the Indian and the Jew. An Indian will sell the shirt off his back for whisky the\n\n34\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nJew will his for money. The Indians, in their wars, often murdered men, women and children, and so did the Jews. By taking the 31st chap. Numbers, and perusing it closely, he will see that I am not mistaken as to the Jews. There was a custom in my time, among Indians, that there were many crimes punishable by their laws and could the perpetrators of those crimes escape and lay out until their green-corn dance, and then reach the dance-ground undiscovered, they would go unpunished but in no instance have I ever known murder to go un punished, if the offender could be caught. The Wind family was allowed and it was law that they should punish a murder at any and all times but the other families were not allowed this privilege after a certain time.\n\nAs to the meeting of those versed in Indian history, I would like much to attend such a meeting; and if I am in possession of any information that others have not, I would most willingly impart it. Besides, nothing could afford me more pleasure than to meet at Montgomery. I should like to see it, now it is a city, as I knew it forty years ago a forest. But it is a pleasure, I fear, that my age and situation will deny me. Such a meeting, no doubt, would be interesting to many bring up much of the past that has probably been forgotten, and be the means of explaining and doing away with many conflict ing notions that have and do exist among various persons, in relation to Indians and their history, particularly those tribes that inhabited Alabama.\n\nT. S. W.\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n35\n\nWHEELING, WINN PARISH, LA., | April 2, 1858. )\n\nF. A. RUTHERFORD, ESQ. Dear Sir:--Your letter of the 8th ultimo, came to hand\n\nyesterday. You wish to know something of the early settlement and history of Macon and the adjoining coun ties. As to the history of the section of country you live in, I know much from 1813 to 1841, when I left Alabama. Many persons, who know what I do of the country and of the time I allude to, might write something that would interest you and some of your readers, but fear I shall not be able to do so. What I write, however, shall be facts, as well or better established than you generally get them, and perhaps some of them may be new to you and others.\n\nFrom what 1 know of the Indians and their history, I think it as probable as anything that cannot be positively proven, that an occurrence in Macon county caused the Creek Indian war of 1813-14. It was the murder of Arthur Lott, in 1812, by some Chetocchefaula Indians, a branch of the Tallasees. Lott was killed near what is known as the Warriors Stand. He was moving to the then Mississippi Territory. His family moved on and settled at a bluff on Pearl River, which long went by the name of Letts Bluff, but is now known as Columbia.\n\nSo soon as Col. Hawkins learned that Lott was mur dered, he sent Christian Limbo, a German, to Cowetaw, to see Billy Mclntosh, a half-breed chief. From Cowetaw, Limbo and Mclntosh went to Thleacatska or Brokenarrow, to see Little Prince. The Prince was too old for active service, and sent a well known- half breed, George Lovet, who was also a chief. Lovet took^with him some Cussetas and Mclntosh some Cowetas, and accompanied Limbo to Tuckabatchy to see the Big Warrior. He\n\n36\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nplaced some Tuckabatchys under a chief called Emutta and the celebrated John McQueen, a negro, and all under the control of Mclntosh, went in pursuit of the murder ers. They found them on the Notasulga creek, at a place known since as Williamson Ferrells settlement: where they shot the leaders and returned to their respective towns. This act aroused the Tallassees, and James Mc Queen, who had controlled them for 95 years having died the year before, his influence was lost, and from talks made some time before by Tecumseh the Sowanaka or Shawnee, and Seekaboo, a Warpicanata chief and prophet, (who was afterwards at the destruction of Ft Mimms,) a number of the young warriors and a few old ones had be come restless. Not long after Lott was killed, an old gentleman named Merideth was killed at the crossing on Gatoma Creek, in what is now Montgomery county. This was done by the Otisees, in a drunken spree. The Big Warrior undertook to have them punished, but failed to do so, and in attempting to arrest them an Otisee was killed. A few days after this, the Otisees attacked a party of Tuckabachys, under the chief Emutta, at the Old Agency or Polecat Springs, which was then occupied by Nimrod Doyle. Doyle had been a soldier under Gen. St. Glair, was at his defeat and afterwards with Gen.\n\nWayne. About this time, or a little after, a chief, Tustanugga-\n\nchee or Little Warrior, and a Coowersortda Indian, known as Capt. Isaacs, who had gone north-west with Tecumseh, were returning to the Creek nation, and learned from some Chickasaws that the Creeks had gone to war. Relying on this information, the Little Warriors party did some mischief on the frontier of Tennessee as well as killed a few persons. On their return to the nation they found that war had not actually broken out, but only the few little depredations that I have mentioned, had been committed. The Coowersortda Indians, Capt. Sam. Isaacs, (a name that he borrowed from an old trader who died some years back in Lincoln county, Tenn., and who was\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n37\n\none of the most cunning, artful scamps I ever saw among the Indians,) gave the Big Warrior information about the murders in Tennessee. Isaacs from his tricks and man agement and having Alexander McGillvrays daughter for a wife, was let out of the scrape; but the Little War rior being a Hickory-Ground Indian, set the Coosa Indians at variance with the Big Warrior. After this the Tuckabatchys, Ninny-pask-ulgees, or Road Indians, the Chunnanuggees and Conaligas all forted in, at Tuckabatchy, to defend themselves from those that had turned hostile.\n\nI have often heard Sam Moniac say, that if Lott had not been killed at the time he was, it was his belief that the war could have been prevented. He and Billy Weatherford have often said to me as well as others, that the Big Warrior at the time Tecumseh made his talk, at Tuckabatchy, was inclined to take the talk, and at heart, was as hostile as any, if he had not been a coward. I :have no doubt, from what I have heard Weatherford say, : he (W.) was as much opposed to that war as any one living: but when it became necessary to take sides, he went with his countrymen, and gave me his reasons for so doing. He said, to join the whites was a thing he did not think right, and had it been so they would not have thanked him, and would have attributed it to cowardice. Besides, he said to remain with his people, he could prevent his misguided countrymen from committing many depreda tions that they might otherwise do. Weatherford was never a chief, though exercising as much or more influ ence over a part of the nation than many that were chiefs. He did not act the part which some writers say he did in the war, though I think he was fully as great a man as any have made him out to be. He was of a different order of man to what has generally been believed. As I knew him well and have had as good opportunities to be come acquainted with his history and character, as roost men that now live, I will, when I have leisure, give you Gen. Jackson and Col. Hawkins opinion of the man, and what I think to be a more correct history than anything\n\n3\n\n38\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nI have seen written about him: and should any one doubt my judgment about him, none that knew these men will doubt theirs.\n\nI left the Tuckabachys forted in, on the Tallapoosa. The Cowetaws, Cussetaws, Thleacatskas, Uchees, Oswichees, Hitchetas and the Lower Eufowlas, under Mclntosh, Joe Marshall, Timpoochy Barnard and some other Chattahoochee chiefs, went to their assistance. There was some skirmishing, though but little damage done on either side, and the Tuckabachys were carried to the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers, where they remained untill Gen. Floyd came into the nation.\n\nI will close this by giving you the names of some few persons who have died and whose remains rest in Macon county. The first, is Gen. John Sevier, of Revolutionary memory. He rests at Ft. Decatur hill. James McQueen, who died, from all accounts, at the age of 128 years. He lived in the Nation 95 years, and was buried on the west bank of Naufapba creek. Just above Franklin, in the old field near Floyds battle ground on Caleebee, rests James McGirth. He erected the first distillery in Ala bama. James Connells, a noted half-breed, and the brother of McGillvrays last wife, sleeps by his side. Capt. Sam1 Butts was killed in the battle, and was buried on the ground; as were also Littleton Picket, Green Berry, John Thornton and many others. Capt. Wm. Owens, the father of Hardeman Owens, was buried at Ft. Hull. The Drummer, Dan1 Smith, that your father knew about Saundersville, Ga., more than fifty years ago, and Tom Blanks, a mess-mate of mine, sleep at the same place. Whitmael Williams, David Conyers and Leven Grear, from Washington county, Ga., were buried at what was once known as Fishers old field, near the mouth of Caleebee. They were killed at Otisee. Capt. Arnold Scale, who lives in your neighborhood, was along at the time, and can tell you as much of more than I can write.\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n39\n\nI will at some time try and send you an account of the settlement of Macon county, by many of its present citizens.\n\nYours, &c., T. S. W.\n\nWHEELING, WINN PARISH, LA., April 25th, 1858.\n\n: COL. ALBERT J. PICKETT. : Dear Sir :--Your letter of the 23d February last, adi-dressed to me through the Montgomery Mail, reached me : some weeks since, and I have been too much engaged to : write, had I been able to write anything worth reading, : or to answer your inquiry about the Uchees and their ; language. All I can say about them is, that they occuipied portions of Alabama, Georgia, and perhaps South ; Carolina. When the Creeks first settled the country, they ;were the neighbors of the Sowanoka or Shawnees, the : Yemacraws, Yemasees and Hitchetas; though they in ;habits, customs and language were more like the Shawnees : titan either of the other three tribes I have mentioned. ::As to that guttural sound or indescribable pronunciation :of words, you are as able to account for it as I am. That guttural pronunciation was not alone confined to the Uchees; it seems to have been peculiar to those tribes ;that inhabited Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas. Be fore the Muscogees settled Alabama and Georgia, from iwhat I recollect of the Catawbas, Apilashs, Cherokees and Shawnees, they all more or less have that singular articu lation, though not to so great an extent as the Uchees. It is yet noticeable among the common Cherokees and Shawnees; in fact the Uchees and Shawnees once could understand each others language about as the Choctaws asd Chickasaws do theirs. The Uchees were, like many other little tribes, broken up by the Creeks and those western bands that were connected with them. The Cherokees and Sowanokas were about all the tribes that\n\n40\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nthe Creeks did not subdue. These two tribes were always able to stand their hands with the Muscogees, particularthe Sowanokas, until the whites began to encroach on them from the east. The tribe was then strong, and emigrated to the north-west. Many of the Uchees went north-west with the Shawnees. Those Uchees that re mained in the country were allowed their own town Chiefs and a head Chief of their tribe, but were all under the general government of the Muscogees. The Uchees con tended as long as they lived in the country that they could, man to man, whip the Creeks. And in Gen. Floyds night fight, their leader, Timpoochy Barnard, fought much better than the friendly Creeks. With equal numbers they could beat the Creeks at a ball play, for I have seen them do it often.\n\nIf the Uchees and Shawnees were not originally the same people, they had lived so long and so near each other as to become pretty well acquainted with each others language. Many years ago I became acquainted with a Shawnee Chief in Texas, who headed a little band of his people that emigrated to that country very shortly after Gen. Harrison defeated them at Tippecanoe. This Chief spoke pretty good English was very intellingent for an Indian and was in the Tippecanoe fight, and has often related to me the particulars of that affair, or at least as he understood them. This man has, perhaps, been better known than almost any other Chief of any tribe in the early settlements of Texas and Arkansas. He remained in Texas until the American population commenced putting aside Spanish and Mexican customs. He then moved his people into a thinly settled portion of Arkansas. In 1841, a Mr. James Woodland and myself were traveling in Arkansas, and met with the Chief Spy Buck, (for that was his name.) I recollected to have seen or known him in Texas. He made many inquiries about me, and where I lived. I informed him I was living in the Old Musqua Country, and that I intended settling on the Washita river, at a point that he seemed to know;\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n41\n\nand in January, 1842, I settled at the place spoken of. A week after my arrival at the place, Spy Buck and his party, a few Cherokees, some Choctaws, one or two Chickasaws, and a Delaware, all made their appearance. The Shawnees with Spy Buck, remained some two years near me, and then left for the Kansas river, except his youngest brother; he remained with me four years, or two years after the others left. From these people I learned much of their history. They gave the same ac count of being forced back from the Savannah and the settlements of the Musqua, in Alabama and Georgia, as the Creeks themselves had given. I had some Uchee ne groes that spoke the Uchee, Creek, and Hitcheta; they and the Shawnees, could understand much of each other in Uchee; and that is one reason for believing that the Sowanokas and Uchees were once pretty much the same people. Among the many things I learned from Spy Buck, was that he had hunted with Savannah Jack or Sowanoka Jack above the Cross Timbers on Red River, after Jack had gone West. I see you speak of Jack in your history of Alabama. And as I was acquainted with Jack himself, and have had his history from many that knew him well, and its being connected with the history of Alabama as well as the Uchee Indians, it may not be uninteresting to give a sketch of it here. As I have before stated, a number of the Uchees went North-West with the Shawnees, many years ago. And not long after they reached their new homes on the waters of the Ohio, they commenced their depredations on the frontier settlers of Virginia and Pennsylvania. In one of their scouts they captured a white boy on the frontier of Pennsylvania, by the name of John Hague. This boy Hague was raised to manhood among them, and proved to be as great a sav age as any of them. He took an Uchee woman for a wife and raised a number of children; it was also said that Hague raised an illegitimate son by a white woman namGirthy or Girty, and called his named Simon Girty, after his mother. This boy was brought up about Detroit. It\n\n42\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nwas said that he and a man by the name of Wells con tributed much to the defeat of Gen. St. Clair. This I have learned from several white men who knew Girty and were with Gen. St. Clair. I will give you the names of four of them, as they were known to many in Alabama and Georgia: Nimrod Doyle, Absalom Hall, John Cone, and Bob Walton. Doyle and Walton were both wound ed at the defeat. Hague, who had grown old, remained in the country until Gen. Wayne put an end to the trou bles in that quarter. So soon as this was done, Hague came South with his Indian family bringing with him some Uchees and Sowanokas, and settled them on Fawn Creek, or what is now known as Line Creek, near its mouth and on the Mongomery side of the Creek. Hague died and was buried on a mound near where there was once a little village, settled by the whites, called Augusta. This I have learned from Doyle, Walton Sam. Moniac, Billy Weatherford and many others. And Savannah Jack was his youngest son by the Uchee woman. I do not know that it would be slandering the illustrious dead to say that Jack was the Marshal Ney of the old hostile Indians: Jack fought through the War, and after their defeat at Horse Shoe, and Gen. Jackson moved his troops to the place where he built Fort Jackson. The Indians then became very much discouraged and com menced coming in. The chiefs who had controlled these towns during the War would get in striking distance, to hear what was to be done. Jack sent his women and children out on the head waters of Catoma, and secreted his warriors between a Cypress brake and the river, not far above the present city of Monrgomery. Weatherford, who was not a Chief, (but had more influence than many that were,) placed his people on a little island in the Ala bama river, near the mouth of Noland creek, that makes into the river on the North or Autauga side, known as Moniacs Island. Weatherfords people were Tuskegees. Peter McQueen and his Talassees quartered themselves upon the head waters of Line Creek. John and Sandy\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n43\n\nDurant, the brothers of McQueens wife, and also the brothers of Lochlin Durant, that you know, remained with McQueen. Josiah Francis, the Prophet, Nehe Marthla Micco, the Otisee chief, (both of them hanged, 1818, by Gen. Jackson,) placed their people not far above the Federal crossing on the Catoma. Hossa Yoholo, a very white half-breed chief, and the son of a man by the name of Powell, I think, took shelter in the dense cane forest in the bend opposite Montgomery. This man, from what I have learned, was one of the most reckless fight ers in the nation. Ogillis Ineha, or Menauway, who was the principal leader at Horse Shoe, and at the time was supposed to be killed, carried his people near the falls of Cahawba, where he remained for more than a year after peace was made.\n\nThis was the situation of those chiefs and their people about the time and shortly after General Jackson reached Franca Choka Chula, or the old French trading-house, as it was called by the Indians. Weatherford sent up old Tom Carr, or Tuskegee Emarthla, and he soon learned through Sam Moniac, his brother-in-law, (who was always friendly,) that he was in no danger, and so he came to camp, (but not in the way that it has been represented.) General Jackson, as if by intuition, seemed to know that Weatherford was no savage and much more than an ordi nary man by nature, and treated him very kindly indeed. Savannah Jack, or, as he has been called by some, Sowanoka Jack, was not then as well known to the whites as many others. He frequented the camp pretty much unnoticed, (no doubt as he washed to be.) It was not long before it was understood that Jacksa Chula Harjo (as the Indians used to call Gen. Jackson,) wanted land to pay for the trouble he had been at, and that the Big Warrior and others were in favor of giving Old Mad Jack son. :-as they called him, as much land as he wanted. Jack poor fellow his little field happened to be on the Montgomery side of Line Creek, and of course would have to go with the ceded territory. This Jack could\n\n44\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nnot stand; he threatened to kill the Big Warrior and go to fighting the whites again. It was soon understood that a hostile chief was in camp, making threats, and the General wished to see him; but Jack disappeared. He took his warriors from the cypress brake near Montgome ry, went out to Catoma, where his women and children were, and there joined Francis and the Otisse chief. Hossa Yoholo left the bend of the river at Montgomery and joined Jack and his crowd, as also did McQueen and the Durants. The boy, Billy Powell, who was the grand son of one of Peter McQueens sisters, was then a little boy, and was with this party. They all put out for Flori da, and on their route they split among themselves. Jack and his people being Uchees and Sowanokas, called a halt on the Sepulga, about there and on the line of West Florida, where he remained until he went West. As to the history of his stay in that region, and what he did before he left, you have already had it. I knew Capt. Butler and the others he killed, and those who made their escape. I knew Ogley poor fellow! I staid one night at his house in company with a Col. Turner Bynum, of North Carolina, and his son, J. A. Bynum, who has since represented the Halifax District, N. C., in Congress. McQueen and the others went to East Florida. Sandy Durant died at Tampa Bay, not long after they reached the country. John Durant went to Nassau, on the Island of New Providence. Peter McQueen remained in Flori da until after Gen. Jacksons campaign of 1818, shortly after which he died on a little barren island on the At lantic side of Cape Florida. Hossa Yoholo, the white half-breed chief, died on Indian river, in East Florida, with a disease in his feet caused from an insect there known as the jigger. This I learned from a hostile negro who was raised with a family by the name of Powell, but in after times was known as Holmes Ned. He accompa nied Hossa Yoholo or the Singing Sun to Florida. I knew Ned many years: I purchased him from our friend, Horse Shoe Ned, and he died mine.\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n45\n\nI will here try and account to you for an error that many have fallen into, about Billy Powell or Oceola. As I remarked before, this boy went with his uncle, McQueen, to Florida. I knew him well after that, and have seen him frequently. Capt. Isaac Brown and myself, with a party of friendly Creeks and Uchees, made him a prisoner, in 1818, and he was then but a lad. Capt. Brown is now living in Bozier Parish, this State, and well recollects the circumstance; for at the same time we captured Billy, we re-captured a white woman that was made a prisoner by the Indians at the massacre of Lieut. Scott and his party, below the mouth of Flint river. She was then a Mrs. Stuart, since a Mrs. Dill, of Fort Gaines, Ga. This was at Osilla, and known as the Mclntosh fight. This boy having gone to Florida at the same time that Hossa Yoholo went, then growing to be a man, and then being called Ussa Yoholo, or Black Drink, after the killing of Gen. Thompson, those that had heard of the fighter Hossa Yoholo, of the old war, took Ussa Yoholo to be the same man. You will see that the names, from the way they are spelled, would sound pretty much alike, and they both being Powells but of different families you can see how the mistake could have easily originated. Besides, I know that Oceola, as he is called, was not a chief, nor ever was known to the Tallassees as such, until after the killing of Gen. Thompson.\n\nYou see that it is generally the half-breeds and mixedbloods that speak our language, that the whites get ac quainted with; and if, in case of a little war or anything of the sort, one of those that the whites know, go off among the hostiles, he is by the whites dubbed a chief. The Indians soon learn whom the whites look upon as being their leaders, and not being as ambitious of distinction as the whites generally are, when any talking or compro mising is to be done, those persons are put forward. Such was the case with Jim Henry and others, in 1836. Jim Henry was never a chief in his life. His mother was a Chehaw woman, and his father a Cuban Spaniard, and\n\none of those deserters from St. Augustine, Fla., long before I knew anything about Indians. The father of Jim was Antonio Rea. He once lived in Saundersville, Washing ton county, Ga., but that was before I knew him. A .:.:.:.:JS Capt. McDougald took him to Fort Hawkins, from whence he went to Chehaw, and thence to a place called Finder Town. One of the others was Emanuel, though sometimes called Toney. He was the father of our Toney that killed George Bonner, in 1836. The other was Tom Peechin, known as Tom Pigeon. I saw an account, not long since, of Joe Pigeon, a half-breed Choctaw, being hanged in Mobile, for killing a cab-man. His mother was no Choctaw; she was a Creek. Whenever you come to know the truth, you will find that it was our Joe. Old Tom, his father stopped at Pass Christian, and never went with the Indians to Arkansas, as I have heard; be sides killing a man for a few dollars was just suited to Joes morals. Although Joes father was a Catholic, and Joe a pupil of Mr. Compeer, his religious teachings did him but little good. I knew him well, and he was cer tainly one of the worst half-breeds I ever knew.\n\nWhen I commenced this, I had no idea of putting Joe Pigeon in it; but he has passed up among other old ac quaintances, and so I have to let him in. I will write something else, next time.\n\nYours, T. S. W.\n\nWHEELING, WINN PARISH, LA., | June 13th, 1858. }\n\nJ. J.

Whether it reached you or not I do not know; if it did, and has been published, I\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n47\n\nwould be glad to get the number of your paper that con tains it, as I have promised a friend to let him have what I write to you and others, relative to Indian history, and the early settlement of Alabama. Your paper until within the last two months came more regularly than any I take; since that time, I seldom see or hear of a Mont gomery Mail. I do not recollect the last number of the Mail I did get. This country is like most others that I have lived in too few reading people, and too many of that few find it more convenient to borrow a newspaper than pay for one; so I very often have mine loaned out. And that is why I cannot recollect the last number I re ceived. But I recollect among the last numbers that I have seen, there was a sketch, I think, taken from a Bos ton paper, giving an account of the meeting of three Scotch brothers in Charleston, Mass., which meeting was not of very common occurrence; and, on reading that, I sketched off the meeting of two brothers, that I witnessed, many years ago, in what is now Alabama, but then was the Creek nation, and which I did not send to you.\n\nSome years before the Creek war, and when I was quite a youngster, I made occasional visits to the Ocrriulgee river, which was then the line between the whites and Indians. *The Indians claimed half the river, and in spring or shad-catching time the Indians would flock from all parts of the nation in great numbers to the Ocmulgee. They could be seen at every shoal as high up the river as shad could run, down to the Altamaha, for the purpose of fishing./ On one of my trips to Old Fort Hawkins, I became acquainted with an Indian countryman by the name of John Ward; and the first time I ever visited the Creek agency, which was then on Flint River, was in company with Ward, an old uncle of mine, and one An drew McDougald. Col. Hawkins was then holding a council with some chiefs from various parts of the nation. I met with Ward occasionally from that time until the war commenced. When Gen. Floyd moved his troops to Flint River, Ward was the interpreter for the officer that\n\n48\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nwas in command at Fort Manning. He then came into Gen. Floyds camp, and remained with the army until it reached the Chattahoochee, and commenced building Fort Mitchell. He was often sent out with Nimrod Doyle as a spy. There was also an Indian countryman along by the name of Bob Moseley. Moseleys wife was the niece of Peter McQueen. Wards wife was a relation of Daniel McDonald, more generally known to the whites as Daniel McGillivray, and both of their wives were then with the hostile Indians. Ward and Moseley seemed willing to risk any and everything to forward the movements of the army, in order to reach the neighborhood of their families. There was a detachment of soldiers sent out to Uchee creek, to throw up a breast-work. I was one of the party, and among the rest was a Baptist preacher by the name of Elisha Moseley, a very sensible and most excellent man at that, and as grave as men ever get to be; for he could pray all night and fight all day, or pray all day and fight all night, just as it came to his turn to do either; and this preacher was a brother to Bob Moseley, the Indian coun tryman. While at this breast-work, one night, by a campfire, L listened to Elijah Moseley inquiring into his bro thers motives for leaving a white family and making his home among a tribe of savages. Bobs reply was, as well as I now recollect, that there was no false swearing among Indians. The preacher then commenced making some enquiry into Wards history. Ward informed him that his father had taken him into the Creek nation near where Oweatumka or Wetumpka now stands, when he (Ward) was a child, and shortly after died, and that he recollected very little of his father; that he had been raised by Daniel McDonald, or McGillivray, as he was commonly called; that he heard McDonald say that his father was a Georgian, and had left a wife and children in that State. Wards history, as far as it went, soon be came known in the camp; and some one in the camp, that had heard of Wards father quitting his family and disappearing with one of his children, and knowing some-\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\n49\n\nthing of the Wards in Georgia, looked at John Ward and said, from the near resemblance of him and a Georgia Ward, they must be brothers. The Georgia brother was written to, and in a few weeks, made his appearance in camp. In this time, the Indian Ward, from exposure, had fallen sick, and was very low. The Georgia brother came into camp one night, and the next morning John Ward was a corpse though John was perfectly rational on the arrival of his brother and, before he died, knew who he was. They proved to be twin brothers. A very inti mate acquaintance of yours messed with me at the time, and Ward frequently messed with us. It was Capt. Ar nold Seals, of Macon county, Ala. Ward died in one of the tents of Adams riflemen, and Elijah Moseley was his nurse. The most feeling pulpit talk I ever heard dropped from the lips of Elijah Moseley, in a soldiers tent, on the death of John Ward. Ward left one son. John, though raised among Indians, spoke our language very well. Johns mother was a Tuskegee. He was entitled to a half section of land, under the treaty, and was enrolled among the Tuskegees. He was a floater, under the treaty, but by the permission of Col. Albert Nat. Collins, of Macon county, and myself, he located him a tract in the fork of Coosa and Tallapoosa. I think he sold to Col. George Taylor. The Indian countryman, John Ward, died in 1813. His remains rest on the hill just above old Fort Mitchell. So do the remains of two other Indian country men Tom Carr, an Englishman, and the father of Paddy Carr, and lame Bob Walton. Col. Hawkins used to call him Timor Bob, and said he was as brave, if not the bravest man he ever knew. He was the interpreter for Col. Hawkins, and accompanied him to the Hickory Ground, with Sam Moniac, Billy Weatherford, Pinthlo Yoholo, or Swamp Singer, and old Eufau Harjo, or Mad Dog, at the time he arrested Boles, the Englishman, at the head of fifteen hundred Indian warriors. If old Col. Joe Hutchinson is living, he can give you a full history of that affair; and if dead, a letter, in the hand writing of\n\n50\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nCol. Hawkins, may be found among his papers, detailing the history of the whole matter. On the hill where rest the remains of these men I have mentioned, as well as many others that I could name, moulders the right arm of Lieut. Tennell. He was a gallant man was wounded at Otissee. His arm was amputated by Dr. Charles Williamson, at Fort Mitchell. Those things are as fresh in my memory almost as when they occurred at least, much more so than many things that have occurred long since.\n\nI will close this by saying to you, that I wrote another letter to Col. Pickett, trying to prove to him that I was beter acquainted with Indian history than himself; but not knowing whether the first was published, I decline sending it, thinking it probable that they were getting too long and uninteresting for publication; and, from my manner of writing, I could give no satisfaction if satis faction I could give at all and have them much shorter.\n\nI hope my old Tar River friend, Horse Shoe Ned, still lives and enjoys good health. I would give more to see him and Lewis Tyus than I would to read all the speeches that have been spoken and all the letters that have been written on Kansas affairs.\n\nYours, T. S. W.\n\nFrom the Coolumbus (Ga.) Sun.\n\nEds. Sun: In the spring of 1818, the writer was in Gen. Jacksons army, in Florida, consisting of near 4,000 men, including regulars commanded by Gen. Gaines; Georgia militia commanded by Gen. Glascock; the Tennessee horsemen and friendly Indians under Gen. Mclntosh. Major Thomas Woodward and Captain Isaac Brown had a kind of joint command with Mclntosh over the Indians.\n\nWhile marching on between St. Marks, and Sewannee Town, distance about one hundred miles, on Sunday, the\n\nREMINISCE N. CES.\n\n51\n\n;12th day of April, we discovered fresh signs of Indians.\n\n:6en. Mclntosh, with his command of Creek Indians,\n\npursued them. The main army, as was our habit, lay\n\n:k>wn in the grass to rest and await Mclntoshs return.\n\nery soon Mclntosh overtook them, and the battle com-\n\nsienced in hearing of us, probably a mile off. We could\n\n: {)<?ar the firing of guns, which continued for some time.\n\n;: : Well I remember an express borne from Mclntosh.\n\nAn Indian, on foot, running, crying out, at the top of his\n\nvoice, \"Captain Jackson, Captain Jackson.\" As he pas\n\nsed us, we pointed to Old Hickory, who soon dispatched\n\na company of Tennessee mounted men to aid Mclntosh.\n\nThe battle was finished ere they reached him. Mclntosh\n\nand Woodward soon returned to our camp with their pris\n\noners, consisting of women and children, and a white wo\n\nman to our surprise. This woman is still living in or\n\nabout Fort Gaines. She was then Mrs. Stuart, and\n\nafterwards married John Dill, of Fort Gaines, who died\n\na few years since.\n\nFor the particulars of her capture by the Indians and\n\nre-capture by Mclntosh and Woodward, I refer you to\n\nthe enclosed letter, which I have just re"
