        "text": "MADDOX, William E. – I am searching for any record of a shooting death that occurred on a street car in Alabama around 1900 (+/- 5 years). The shooter was a street car conductor, my great grandfather, who fled Alabama to Oklahoma to avoid prosecution. His name was William E. Maddox. (Actually, I’d settle for ANY record at all of him from Alabama. Would’ve been born 1885ish…best guess.) Near as I can figure, there were only 7 possible locations where this could have occurred: Montgomery, Birmingham, Mobile, Gadsden, Tuscaloosa, Huntsville or Anniston. I am trying historical organizations in each. If you could suggest a likely resource–books, newspaper archives, legal/court records–for the Birmingham area for me to use in this search, that would be a great help. Thanks so much.

Is there a Birmingham Newspaper archive of that period? I am at a loss as to the name of William Maples’ father and origin (as well as his fate). Willie’s mother, probably a widow, married James Barron in 1887 Cullman Co. William Maples mother’s maiden name was Annie Ruth Kennedy. I have been unable to locate a marriage record for Maples and Kennedy in Alabama. Any clue will be greatly appreciated so I can continue the search. Please contace Harold W.
