        "text": "Welcome to the Clan MacGillivray Genealogy Page! We will be using this page to post genealogical queries and information of interest to all those with the surname MacGillivray and its variant spellings, particularly those who have a connection to Canada.\n\nWe encourage all MacGillivrays to review the database for ancestors who have passed; with a view to identifying their family line. We would appreciate your assistance in assigning family members to their correct line.\n\nPlease feel free to add your own information by using the comment box below.\n\nNEW BRUNSWICK\n\nAccording to the 1871 and 1881 censuses there were several different MacGillivray family lines in New Brunswick. Most of the head of the households indicate that they were born in Nova Scotia. We have attached the 1871 and 1881 New Brunswick Censuses with the hope to assign the various MacGillivray families to their respective lines. For those households that we have identified we have added the name of the related family spreadsheet. We have also included below the information from New Brunswick vital statistics that is available on line relating to MacGilivrays.\n\nNew Brunswick Censuses 1871 & 1881\n\nNew Brunswick Vital Statistics MacGillivray\n\nNOVA SCOTIA\n\nAccording to the 1817 Nova Scotia Census for Sydney County and for Pictou County, there are twenty-six and sixteen MacGillivray families listed respectively. Some of the households are listed numerically; one may notice that many of the MacGillivray families are living in close proximity to one another.\n\n1817 CENSUS\n\nThrough the use of wills, cemetery inscriptions, death records, obituaries and more, we have constructed a database of MacGillivrays for these two counties.\n\nTo sort out the various lines of MacGillivrays, this project used a number of published works including the following:\n\n“The History of Antigonish” edited by R A MacLean; “Drummer on Foot” edited by R A MacLean and Don MacFarlane;\n\n“A History of the County of Antigonish ” by Rev D J Rankin.\n\nFurther, as the project moved forward it became clear that we should expand the project to include all of Nova Scotia. Other published works were consulted including:\n\n“Cuir is Baun” by the Glendale Gaelic and Historical Society;\n\n“A West Wind to East Bay – Pioneer Families of East Bay” by AJ MacMillan.\n\nConsultation with several unpublished manuscripts, including the following:\n\n“Donald MacGillivray a Royal Highlander” by Francis X Hugh MacGillivray\n\nThis has resulted in a comprehensive database of the MacGillivray family lines with roots with Nova Scotia\n\nNSDR All Counties Project\n\nSupporting this database are spreadsheets and word files for the various lines identified.\n\nThis database is truly an evergreen document. We welcome your corrections, changes and additional information.\n\nWe are attaching a spreadsheet for the MacGillivrays buried at the following cemetery.\n\nKirkmount Cemetery – Pictou County, Nova Scotia – McGillivray\n\nPRINCE EDWARD ISLAND\n\nAccording to the 1881 census there were several different MacGillivray family lines in Prince Edward Island. We have attached the 1881 PEI Census and have started the process to assign the various MacGillivray families to their respective lines.\n\nPEI Census MacGillivray 1881\n\nQUEBEC\n\nAccording to the 1871 census there were several different MacGillivray family lines in Quesbec. We have attached the 1871 Quebec Census and have started the process to assign the various MacGillivray families to their respective lines.\n\nWe are attaching a spreadsheet for the MacGillivray line of Thurso/Lochaber, Quebec.\n\nWe are attaching a second family line referred to as McGillivray – Rootie’s Family History and a link to a MacGillivray line that started in Glengarry, Ontario. The descendents can be seen in the 1871 census.\n\nQuebec Census 1871\n\nMacGillivray Thurso Quebec\n\nMcGillivray – Rootie’s Family History Site\n\nMacGillivray – Angus MacGillivray & Mary MacMaster Glengarry Ontario to St. Polycarpe Quebec\n\nSASKATCHEWAN\n\nWe are currently working on a spreadsheet for the various MacGillivray families in the province of Saskatchewan. We are attaching a spreadsheet for the MacGillivrays buried at the following cemetery."
