        "text": "CLAN MACGILLIVRAY\n\nMotto: Touch not this cat\n\nHistoric Seat: Dunmaglass\n\nDistrict: Argyll, Mull\n\nAssociated Surnames: Gilroy, MacGillivour, MacGilvra, MacGilvray, MacIlvrae, Milroy\n\nAssociated Tartans:\n\nEarly MacGillivray Genealogy and History:\n\n(Excerpt from \"The Scottish Clans and Their Tartans\", James Grant, 1906)\n\nIn the \"History of the MacIntoshes,\" we are told that about the year 1263 a warrior named Gabri placed himself under the protection of MacIntosh, and became the progenitor of the clan of MacGillivray, or MacGilli-Bhreac, the children of the freckled man. His stronghold was named Dunmacglas.\n\nThere is still a branch of this clan in Mull, designated from the head of the branch, as of Beinn-an-gaill, or \"The House of the Stranger.\"\n\nIn the Privy Council Register for 1578, caution is found by \"Williame Drummond of Myllynab in 500 merks for Duncane Macfarlane, and 100 pounds for Malcolme M'Gilleboray, his servant, that they will appear to be tried for (being) art and part in the slaughter of ... Ra, and will keep the peace meanwhile.\"\n\nIn the same Record, under date 1579, we find the name of \"Archibald M'Ilvoray\" in a case of the Laird of Luss against Campbell of Auchnawilling and others.\n\nThe notices of this surname are rather meagre. The Rev. Martin MacGillivray of the Mull branch, who lived about 1640, always wore a claymore; and once, when calling on MacLean of Lochbuy for his stipend, was asked, with a snear, if he meant to enforce his demand with his sword. \"Rather than lose what is my due, I shall! I do mean to use it,\" said he sternly.\n\nFarquhar MacGillivray of Dunmacglas was a Commissioner for Inverness-shire in the Parliament of 1685 (Acts Parl. Jac. VII.).\n\nThe MacGillivrays of Beinn-an-gaill were at Sheriffmuir1 for King James in 1715; and when Lady MacIntosh raised her clan for the Prince in 1745, the command was assigned to MacGillivray of Dunmacglas, as the chief refused to lead it. He fell at Culloden2 with four officers of his regiment. His own immediate following was only eighty men. He fell in front of the 4th Regiment of the Line, but not before he had nearly hewn off the Colonel's sword hand with his claymore. He was alive next day; but when the English were murdering the wounded, by Cumberland's order, his brains were dashed out in presence of his distracted wife and aged nurse, in whose arms he lay. His body was stripped and his laced waistcoat was appropriated by a soldier of the 4th Foot.\n\nThe rallying cry of this clan was \"Loch Sloy!\"\n\nDr William MacGillivray, one of this surname, a very distinguished naturalist, died at Aberdeen in 1852. Nor should we forget Alexander MacGillivray, who was author of some pretty Scottish songs.\n\n(End excerpt)\n\nNext page: Clan MacGregor\n\nFootnotes:\n\n1 The Battle of Sheriffmuir (1715): The Battle of Sheriffmuir was fought on 13 November 1715, led by John Erskine, 6th Earl of Mar, standard-bearer for the Jacobite cause in Scotland, and British Government forces, led by John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll. It took place on the slopes of the Ochil Hills in Scotland, just inside the Perthshire border. Read more about the Battle of Sheriffmuir at Wikipedia."
