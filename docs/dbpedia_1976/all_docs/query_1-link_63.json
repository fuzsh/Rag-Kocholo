We’re going to cover the Jacobite clans and family names, as well as their role in the Battle of Culloden.\n\nThe Scottish clan system dates back to the 12th Century. Originally, it encompassed extended networks of families who were loyal to a particular clan chief.\n\nHowever, anyone who pledged their allegiance to a chief could claim the clan name as their own. This included those who worked for a clan or who sought their protection. When surnames were introduced, many clan members took their clan chief’s name as their surname.\n\nLet’s discuss who the Jacobites were, before jumping into the Jacobite clans.\n\nWho Were The Jacobites?\n\nWhen the Stuarts were displaced as the ruling house of Scotland, England and Ireland, a rebellion began. Numerous Jacobite clans and other supporters rallied to restore the Stuart name to power.\n\nThese supporters were called Jacobites. The name was derived from Jacobus, the Latin word for James. This is where the root of the Jacobite uprising lies. In 1688, James II (also known as James VI) was overthrown.\n\nThe British Government and various nobles did not want a converted Catholic king and instead gave the crown to James’ Protestant daughter, Mary.\n\nThe most renowned uprising in Scottish history started in 1745, under Bonnie Prince Charlie. Huge numbers of clan nobility and clan members rallied in support of Charlie’s mission. Many clan members gave their lives to the Jacobite cause.\n\nPicture credit: Wikimedia\n\nJacobite Clans And Family Names\n\nIn August 1745, Bonnie Prince Charlie landed on the island of Eriskay in Scotland. Scottish clans were initially unenthusiastic that he had arrived, as he did so with hardly any troops. These troops were also simply volunteers!\n\nThe Prince also had hardly any weapons, due to encounters with British government forces at sea.\n\nAs Charlie marched to Moidart, he inspired over 1200 people to join the Jacobite rising. These forces were primarily made up of members of Highland regiments.\n\nThese included members of Clan Donald, Clan MacDonell of Glengarry, Clan MacDonald of Keppoch, and Clan MacDonald of Clanranald. Members of Highland Scots Clan Cameron joined here too.\n\nThe army marched south from Glenfinnan. In the process, the number of supporters increased to over 3 000.\n\nThe following clans rallied for the Jacobite cause:\n\nClan Chisholm.\n\nClan Drummond.\n\nClan Farquharson.\n\nClan Hay.\n\nClan Livingstone or MacLea.\n\nClan MacBain.\n\nClan MacColl.\n\nClan MacFie.\n\nClan MacGillivray.\n\nClan MacGregor.\n\nClan MacInnes.\n\nClan MacKintosh.\n\nClan MacIver.\n\nClan MacKinnon.\n\nClan MacLachlan.\n\nClan MacLaren.\n\nClan MacNeil of Barra.\n\nClan Macpherson.\n\nClan Menzies.\n\nClan Ogilvy.\n\nClan Oliphant.\n\nClan Robertson.\n\nClan Stewart of Appin.\n\nClan MacDonald of Glencoe.\n\nBy September 1745, the Jacobite army held Edinburgh.\n\nThe French sent weapons, as well as an army, to aid Prince Charles Edward Stuart and the Jacobite cause.\n\nIn November, an army of 6 000 set out. This army included an Atholl brigade comprised of members of Clan Stewart of Atholl as well as Clan Fergusson.\n\nPicture credit: Wikimedia\n\nSecond line: Led by Lieutenant Colonel Walter Stapleton, this line of regiments was comprised of the Angus and Irish Piquet’s regiments, the Duke of Perth’s regiment, the first and second regiments of Clan Gordon, and the Regiment Eccosais Royeaux.\n\nThird line: The third and final line was constructed of men from Pitsligo’s and Kilmarnock's regiments, Lord Elcho’s Horse and FitzJames’s Horse.\n\nThe final Battle Of Culloden saw the Prince’s artillery outnumbered three to one by the British army. This government army actually included arch-enemies of Clan Donald - Clan Campbell.\n\nThe exhausted men of the Jacobite rising didn’t stand a chance of winning against the government troops. In under one hour, 1250 Jacobites had been killed.\n\nA similar number had been wounded and 558 Jacobites were taken prisoner. This is a sobering end to a story of resistance and resilience.\n\nToday, the Stuarts are survived by descendants of relatives. There are still those who support the ideas that the Stuarts should never have been removed from their position of power.\n\nIf you’re interested in the Battle of Culloden, you might enjoy these articles on did the Jacobites win and Jacobite weapons."
