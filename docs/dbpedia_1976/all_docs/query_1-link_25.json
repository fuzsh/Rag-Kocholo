        "text": "Ancestors Descendants\n\nProfile last modified 31 Jul 2024 | Created 21 Mar 2018\n\nThis page has been accessed 4,581 times.\n\nBiography\n\nSehoy III was born about 1755 in Alabama and her parents were Malcolm McPherson and Sehoy II Marchand, a Creek woman of the Wind Clan in Tookabatchee. Sehoy III was married at least twice, to David Taitt/Tate and Charles Weatherford.\n\nChildren[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]:\n\nSehoy III children with David Taitt/Tate:\n\n(1) David Tate (m. Mary Randon; m. Mary Dyer)\n\n(2) Eloise Tate\n\nSehoy III children with Charles Weatherford:\n\n(1) William Weatherford (m. Mary Polly Moniac; m. Sapalamay Moniac: m. Mary Stiggins)\n\n(2) John Weatherford (m. Patty Dyer)\n\n(3) Elizabeth Weatherford (m. Sam Moniac)\n\n(4) Rosannah Weatherford (m. Joseph Shomo)\n\nSehoy III married David Taitt, deputy to the British Superintendent at the time, between 1770-1778, when Sehoy III was about 18 years old. After American traders began threatening David Taitt's life, he fled the Creek Nation in 1778. Sehoy III was granted a divorce due to abandonment and re-married about 1780 in the Creek Nation (Alabama) to Charles Weatherford.[12]\n\nShe died about 1812 and was buried at the William Weatherford Memorial Park in Little River, Baldwin County, Alabama, USA. [13]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nMerged profiles showed estimated birth dates of 1750 and 1759.\n\nThomas Woodward identifies the first husband of Sehoy II Marchand (and grandfather of David Tate) as Malcolm McPherson. Woodward alleges that McPherson gave Lachlan McGillivray his start in business. (However, it currently accepted that Lachlan McGillivray was sponsored by the South Carolina trading house of his McGillivray kin.) The passage also repeats the commonly accepted story that John Tate (who also allegedly first accompanied Lachlan into the Creek nation) married Sehoy III and was the father of David Tate. As summarized on the Tate/McPherson pages, Amos J. Wright has raised serious questions about the existence of John Tate. For example, Woodward's story of Tate's death is too similar to that of David Tait's aborted Savannah expedition in 1779/1780 to be dismissed as coincidence. The confusion is disconcerting, to say the least.\n\nWright argues that Sehoy II's first husband was Augustus or Angus McPherson and that Malcolm, the chief of the Hickory Ground who died 01 Jul 1799, was their son. As to the former, Wright identifies August as the only licensed Creek trader by that name who was active in the nation at the time. As to the latter, Wright maintains this is corroborated by the mention of various contemporaries (including Alexander himself) that Alexander McGillivray had a half-brother named McPherson.
