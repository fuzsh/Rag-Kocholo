        "text": "MacGillivray History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nScotland\n\nThe Picts were the ancient Scottish tribe where the ancestors of the MacGillivray family lived. The name MacGillivray comes from a personal name meaning servant of judgement. The Gaelic form of the name is Mac Gillebhrath.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the MacGillivray family\n\nThe surname MacGillivray was first found in Argyllshire (Gaelic erra Ghaidheal), the region of western Scotland corresponding roughly with the ancient Kingdom of DÃ¡l Riata, in the Strathclyde region of Scotland, now part of the Council Area of Argyll and Bute, but this family seat was later moved to Iona with the advent of St. Columba. From this original descendancy came Giolla Brighid, known also as Gillibride, or Gillivray. Gillivray's son, Somerled, the 8th and greatest Thane of Argyll, Lord of Kintyre, and founder of the 'Kingdom of the Isles' was instrumental in driving out the invading Norse (Vikings) from his Kingdom, commencing in 1140 AD. However, Somerled, still gave allegiance to the King of Vikings which continued until 1222, long after Somerled's death in 1164 AD. At this time, Alexander II of Scotland routed many of the Clans 'of the Isles', leaving them eastern Scotland in an area from Glasgow north to Inverness to the East Coast. The MacGillivrays were moved northwards to Lochabe. They became closely associated with their neighbors, the McInnises, the McMasters, and the MacEacherns. They also joined the great Pictish confederacy of Clans known as the Clan Chattan, an association of some twenty six Clans, during the time of Ferquhard, 5th Chief of the MacKintosh, and Chief of the Clan Chattan.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the MacGillivray family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our MacGillivray research.

MacGillivray has been spelled MacGillivray, MacGillivery, MacGillivary, MacGillivry, MacIlvray, MacIlvrae, MacIlwrach, MacIlwray, MacGivery, MacGivray, McGillivrae and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the MacGillivray family\n\nNotable amongst the Clan at this time was\n\nMacGillivray of Dunmaglass...\n\nHe purchased the old MacGillivray holding of Pennyghael on the Isle of Mull, and matriculated a coat of arms for Macgillivray with the Lyon Court in Scotland...\n\nLoading...\n\nMacGillivray migration to the United States +\n\nIn those unstable times, many had no choice but to leave their beloved homelands. Sickness and poverty hounded travelers to North America, but those who made it were welcomed with land and opportunity. These settlers gave the young nations of Canada and the United States a strong backbone as they stood up for their beliefs as United Empire Loyalists and in the American War of Independence. In this century, the ancestors of these brave Scots have begun to recover their illustrious heritage through Clan societies and other heritage organizations.
