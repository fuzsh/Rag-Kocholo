        "text": "For the former leader of the Alberta Conservative Party, see Alexander McGillivray (politician).\n\nAlexander McGillivray, also known as Hoboi-Hili-Miko (December 15, 1750 â€“ February 17, 1793), was a Muscogee (Creek) leader. The son of a Muscogee mother and a Scottish father, he was literate and educated, and understood the \"white\" European world and merchandise trading well. These gave him prestige, especially with European Americans, who were glad to finally find a Creek leader they could talk to and deal with. He used his role as link between the two worlds to his advantage, not always fairly, and became the richest Creek of his time.\n\nMcGillivray was literate and his \"voluminous\" correspondence has survived.[1]: 68 In many cases his letters are the only source for events in his life, and they naturally present him in a very good light. Recent historians have taken issue with the heroic status he had in earlier histories."
