        "text": "McGillivray: What does the surname McGillivray mean?\n\nThe surname McGillivray is of Scottish origin and it originates from the Gaelic MacGhilleBhrath, which means \"son of the servant of judgement.\" The first part of the surname McGil or MacGille means 'son of the servant' while 'Bhrath' refers to judgement or reproach. It is believed to have been a name typically given to someone who worked as a judicial officer or someone attached to a lord's court who was responsible for making decisions and judgements. The McGillivray clan is known to have been centered in the Scottish Highlands, specifically in areas around Inverness-shire and Ross-shire. Like many other surnames of Gaelic origin, the spelling of the name has evolved over time and differs between families, with alternative forms including MacGillivray, McGillvray, MacGilvray, and others. Regardless of spelling variations, all forms of the surname carry the same meaning.\n\nOrder DNA origin analysis\n\nMcGillivray: Where does the name McGillivray come from?\n\nThe surname McGillivray is of Scottish origin, derived from the Gaelic \"Mac Gille Bhrath,\" which means \"son of the servant of judgment.\" It is associated with Clan McGillivray, a Highland Scottish clan with roots in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe McGillivray clan was part of a larger tribal group known as Clan Chattan, which was a powerful confederation of clans. They were primarily located in Inverness-shire, specifically the region around Dunmaglass. The clan played a significant role in several important Scottish historical events, including the Jacobite risings.\n\nToday, the surname McGillivray is found globally, a result of the Scottish diaspora. It is, however, most commonly found in countries such as Scotland, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. In Canada, the McGillivray name is particularly prevalent, due in part to notable figures like William McGillivray, who was a fur trader and landowner in the early 19th century. This diverse distribution reflects the migration and settlement patterns of Scots over the centuries.\n\nVariations of the surname McGillivray\n\nThe surname McGillivray has several variants and spellings due to its Scottish origins and the translation of the Gaelic language into English. Variations of this surname can include MacGillivray, MacGilvray, MacGilveray, MacIllrevie, MacIlvrae, MacIlwraith, Macilwraith, Macillwrath, and MacGillavry. Spellings can also be modified based on regions or individual family traditions, and can often be simplified or anglicized. For instance, it can be shortened to MacGilva, MacGill, or even Gilroy in some areas.\n\nThe surname McGillivray is derived from the Gaelic \"Mac Gillebhrath\", meaning the 'son of the servant of judgment.' Variations of the surname often carry the same or very similar meanings in Gaelic.\n\nThe McGillivray surname originated from the Scottish Clan MacGillivray, a member of the confederation of Clan Chattan. Due to the dispersion of members of the clan during various historical periods, namely after the Battle of Culloden, variations and spellings of the surname can be found in different countries around the world.\n\nFamous people with the name McGillivray\n\nGordon McGillivray: Veteran of the Canadian forces, well-known pilot, worked for several aeronautical companies\n\nJanice McGillivray: Professional pilot and leader in the aviation industry\n\nSimon McGillivray: Canadian businessman, formerly president and CEO of the Hudson's Bay Company\n\nRanald McGillivray: Canadian businessman and philanthropist\n\nJohn David McGillivray: Scottish seaman, explorer and author\n\nAlexander McGillivray: A historical figure of the Yuchi tribe in the American southeast\n\nBernie McGillivray: Retired U.S. Navy Admiral\n\nBrigadier-General Angus McGillivray: Canadian Armed Forces leader\n\nGordon Robert McGillivray: Canadian Army officer\n\nDavid McGillivray: English actor, director, producer and screenwriter\n\nJohn McGillivray: Scottish Nationalist politician\n\nDavid McGillivray, FRS: Scientist and explorer\n\nAndrew McGillivray: 18th century fur trader in British Columbia\n\nOther surnames"
