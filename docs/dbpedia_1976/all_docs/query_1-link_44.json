        "text": "What (or who) is an Indian?\n\nAs an author of several books and articles regarding Native American ancestry, I’m sure it’s a surprise to no one that I daily open my email to discover a barrage of requests for assistance from individuals researching their Native ancestry. These lost souls range from the desperate to the merely curious. Often their electronic pleadings mention a “great-grandmother who was a full-blood Cherokee” or some other vague ancestor who “was said to be an Indian.” The overwhelming majority, however, are some variant on one bewildering request:\n\n“How do I prove that I’m an Indian?”\n\nNow, I could invest hours and numerous pages ranting on the moral and philosophical absurdity of having to “prove” oneself as a member of a racial group, but I have found that it serves the public interest more fully to discuss the actual “mechanics” of Indian identity and leave the philosophizing to the college professors.\n\nBefore I can begin to tackle the herculean question of “proving” that one is an Indian, I must first answer a more fundamental question:\n\n“What (or who) is an Indian?”\n\nTo Average Joe American this may appear to be a simple question. Tee-pees, reservations, braids, war bonnets, and other stereotypical “Indian” symbols flash across the American psyche and Mr. Ordinary Citizen would surmise that the answer would be far less complex than the inquiry. The answer is actually intricate, multifaceted, and rooted in three centuries of acculturation, genocide and American politics.\n\nNormally this is the part of the article where the author dives into a long, intellectual overview of the discovery and colonization of the Americas, the British (and subsequently American) relations with Indian Nations, the Removal era, westward expansion, and so on, but I’ve found that only the college professors I previously mentioned are entertained by dusting off these historical volumes and it results in little use to the contemporary individual trying to find their roots and identity in a world of iPhones, flat screen TV’s, and the internet. So, to keep the interest of the five-minute-attention-span modern audience I’m going to tell the waitress to hold the soup and salad and get right down to the meat and potatoes of the article.\n\n“What (or who) is an Indian?” This question actually has three answers, or more correctly, three definitions. An individual can be an Indian racially, politically, or culturally. To further muddy the waters, an individual can be any combination of two, or even all three, of these at once. The first two require no small part of “recognition” by societal or political forces that are often beyond the control of the individual, while the third is purely an internal factor, but still quite often impacted by external forces. Let’s break down all three categories and examine the unique features of each.\n\nHow is one racially an Indian?\n\nSince “race” is a social structure not backed by science or biology, this is possibly the most difficult concept to define. In historic terms “race” was based on geographical origin and social status more so than any predominant physical features, however in the modern day “race” is determined as a result of a social contract, an agreement between the individual and society at large. For “race” to work, society has to agree that you belong in one racial category or another, and you have to also agree that you belong there. Society is largely influenced by stereotypes when it comes to racial classification, regardless of whether these stereotypes have any biological basis or not. For Indians, these Hollywood inspired physical features are brown or copper colored skin, high cheek bones, large Roman nose, and long black hair (either in braids or flowing romantically in the wind). If the general public does not recognize your physical features as fitting neatly within this copper-colored-headdress-wearing box, or you do not acquiesce that these features are typical or required to be Indian, then the social contract breaks down, often resulting in constant questioning of your racial status, i.e. “But you don’t look like an Indian…”\n\nAs far as most State and Federal agencies are concerned, “race” is purely a self-identified classification. You do not have to be a member of a federally recognized tribe to claim “American Indian” on your job application. You do not have to possess a tribal membership card to have “Native American” entered on your child’s birth certificate. Sadly, the average citizen (and often even the state official filing the information) does not understand this self-identification requirement. Many times I have heard tales of anger and frustration when an individual believes that he “needs my tribal card so I can put Indian on my daughter’s birth certificate” or a Department of Motor Vehicles employee requiring an individual to “prove that I am at least a quarter blood before I can put Indian on my license” none of which are required by state or federal law.\n\nThere is no benefit for being an Indian racially. You do not automatically get “casino money”, go to college for free, or stop paying income tax because you have a Native American ancestor. There are no more special rights, privileges, or financial rewards for being an Indian than there are for being Asian, Middle Eastern, or European. The average American has taken economic and educational benefits entitled to Indian tribes due to their unique political status, applied them ad hoc to Indians as a racial group, and that brings us to our second category:\n\nHow is one politically an Indian?\n\nTo be politically an Indian is ordinarily entirely beyond the control of the individual. To be politically an Indian one has to be enrolled, or eligible to be enrolled, in a tribe that is recognized by the federal government and/or a state government. Because of quirks of history, missteps in federal Indian policy, or in more modern times sometimes the avarice and greed of their own tribal governments, multitudes of America’s Native Americans, though easily identified as Indian racially and by historical ancestry, are not politically Indian. Political status for Native American tribes is a quagmire of intricate law and the fluid sands of Native sovereignty are constantly shifting as the Supreme Court rules one way or Congress legislates another.\n\nCurrent Bureau of Indian Affairs recognition criteria are so fickle and stringent to almost ensure that the majority of unrecognized tribes will never be ‘recognized’ by the United States (not to mention the considerable amount of money the wealthier federally recognized tribes invest in lobbying against unrecognized tribes to protect their “piece of the pie.”). Some states offer official ‘recognition’ to tribal groups which live within their borders, however the criteria for that ‘recognition’ ranges from an all-who-ask-are-given liberality to criteria that is equal to (or more stringent than) the B.I.A.’s. Some states such as Georgia, the historical nemesis of the Cherokees, refuse to offer any official state ‘recognition’ at all.\n\nWhen I receive email inquiries about an individual’s Native American ancestry, the sender is usually primarily concerned about one thing: the benefits of being Indian. This correspondence will generally begin with a recounting of the individual’s family tree with special mention made of this “Cherokee princess” or that “Creek maiden,” and is almost always concluded with a plea for assistance in securing their “free college,” or “Indian money,” or even “get my Indian card so I can stop paying taxes.” Emails such as this starkly identify the disconnect between the concept of Indian as a “race” versus a political status.\n\nSome Indian tribes, based on their special treaty status with the United States government, receive certain treaty stipulated benefits, such as educational assistance, economic aid in the form of business grants, or even immunity from state or federal taxes on reservation land. These entitlements are the result of historic treaties made between rival governments, equal powers in the historic era, and the range and scope of these “benefits” vary from tribe to tribe as treaty language and subsequent Congressional legislation impacted each tribe differently. The result is that some Indian tribes capitalized on their unique legal and political status and invested in lucrative economic ventures such as casinos, manufacturing plants, hotels, and even cruise ships. Other tribes, either through lack of initiative or pure misfortune, languish in poverty on isolated reservations far from any economic relief. Some citizens of federally recognized tribes receive thousands per month in per capita payments (money paid to tribal members from tribal business venture profits or proceeds) while other B.I.A. recognized Indians go their whole lives receiving no benefit greater than an occasional free checkup at an underfunded Indian Health Service clinic.\n\nHow is one culturally an Indian?\n\nCulture can sometimes be as capricious and fluid a concept as ‘race’, and is frequently as equally impacted by stereotypes generated in large part by the entertainment industry. For Native Americans culture generally can be categorized in two, sometimes vastly differing, subsets: traditional culture and pow-wow culture.\n\nTraditional culture is comprised of the authentic, often unique, historic language, ceremonies, dances, and life ways of a specific tribal people. To practice and gain proficiency at traditional culture usually requires research, self-discipline, and an investment of time by the individual. No flashy war bonnets or dream catchers here, just hours sitting with elders, more hours with your nose deep in dusty old history books, and even more hours spent memorizing the proper way to pronounce a word, the correct phrasing of a dance song, or the intricate and detailed craftsmanship required in traditional Native arts. Traditional Indian culture usually never involves financial gain for the practitioner, so it is rarely showcased in such public venues as pow-wows or festivals. Sadly, traditional Native American culture is as alien to Mr. Ordinary Citizen as life without Starbucks would be, so authentic characteristics of Indian identity, such as traditional culture, are not generally acknowledged by the average American.\n\nPow-wow culture is more widely known, widely accepted, and palatable to an American audience force fed the feathers-in-their-hair-whooping-painted-face stereotyped Hollywood Indian image since childhood. Based on some traditional Native dances and practices, pow-wow culture is exaggerated and “fancied up” to appeal to a modern audience. This is the realm of buckskin attire, dance regalia, chicken plumage stained to resemble eagle feathers, and endless rows of vendors hawking dream catchers and beaded trinkets that curious housewives can hang in their cubicle and recount to their co-workers how they met a “real Indian!” Followers of traditional Native culture generally regard pow-wow culture with disdain, considering it a “prostitution” of sacred Indian culture and imagery. Regardless of how traditionalists feel, pow-wow culture remains the most widely accepted and easily identifiable characteristic of “Indian-ness” to the American consumer.\n\nSo, am I an Indian or not?\n\nThe easiest way to demonstrate the differing ways that one may be regarded (or not) to be an Indian, is to consider a few examples. By examining these real life illustrations it becomes painfully apparent how fickle the reality of Indian identity can be.\n\nJane Doe lives in California. She has blonde hair and blue eyes, was identified as “white” on her birth certificate and her school records. Jane self-identified as “white” on her college enrollment, her job applications, and even her California driver’s license. Jane’s great-grandparent’s, like many other Midwest families, left Oklahoma for greener pastures in California during the Depression era. Jane’s grandfather was an enrolled citizen of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma of ¼ blood. Though Jane Doe knows nothing of her tribal culture, language, or history, her grandparents made sure to have her enrolled as a Cherokee citizen for whatever future benefit it may entitle her to.\n\nJane Doe is politically an Indian, but culturally and racially non-Indian.\n\nJohn Smith lives in Utah. He has dark skin, dark eyes, black hair, and all the other features one would describe as “Indian.” John was identified as “Indian” on his birth certificate and school records. John self-identified as “Indian” on his job applications and his Utah driver’s license. John’s grandparents were born on a Catawba reservation in South Carolina. Mormon missionaries convinced a few Catawba families to follow them to Utah were they founded a small Indian community outside Salt Lake. As a result of church influence and harsh boarding school treatment, the Catawba language and culture all but disappeared in the Utah Catawba hamlet. Because John’s grandparents left the Catawba reservation before the 1943 special Catawba Indian Roll, John is not eligible to enroll with his grandparents’ tribe.\n\nJohn Smith is racially an Indian, but politically and culturally non-Indian.\n\nBob Bigknife lives in South Dakota. He has dark skin, dark eyes, black hair, and all the other features one would describe as “Indian.” Bob was born on a Sioux reservation, identified as “Indian” on his birth certificate, school records, and South Dakota driver’s license. Bob’s parents discouraged the speaking of Sioux in their household and Bob knows nothing of his tribal language, or culture beyond being a spectator at a few pow-wows. Bob Bigknife is an enrolled citizen of his Sioux tribe and carries his 4/4 CDIB card around in his wallet.\n\nBob Bigknife is racially and politically an Indian, but culturally non-Indian.\n\nDave Taylor lives in Alabama. He has green eyes, brown hair, light skin, and no features one would describe as “Indian.” Dave was identified as “white” on his birth certificate and school records. Dave grew up hearing family lore of his ancestral connection to a Creek Indian tribe. Dave eventually changed his self-identification to “Indian” on his job applications and his Alabama driver’s license. Dave spent many years with elders on a nearby Creek Indian reservation, became very knowledgeable about Creek history, fluent in the Creek Indian language, and a master of the traditional stomp dance. Because only one of Dave’s great-grandparents appeared as “Indian” on the 1900 Alabama census, his tribe considers him to be 1/8th blood quantum and not eligible for enrollment.\n\nDave Taylor is culturally an Indian, politically non-Indian, and may be considered an Indian racially among those who know his ancestry or tribal connections but most likely regarded as non-Indian by the general populace.\n\nAs these few real life examples illustrate the social, economic, and political realities of Indian identity are staggering. Ultimately the question of “What (or who) is an Indian?” can only be answered with a perplexing “…it depends.”\n\nIf you have ancestors in or passed through South Carolina, you may find this book an invaluable resource:\n\nIf your family has origins in South Carolina, or passed through South Carolina, you may find this book a valuable resource:\n\n“Woodward’s Remininces of the Creek, or Muscogee Indians” 1859 by General Thomas Simpson Woodward\n\nPG 8: a visit paid to Billy Weatherford, the quadroon, along with Zachariah McGirth, Davy Tait (half brother to Weatherford) and Samuel Moniac (who had accompanied Alexander McGillivray to new York).\n\n[Billy Weatherford was 1/4 Indian 3/4 white]\n\nGeorge Stiggins, a half-breed of the Netchis [Natchez] Tribe though raised among the Creeks\n\n[George Stiggins was 1/2 Natchez 1/2 White]\n\nPG 10: Ussa Yoholo (Billy Powell, Osceola, Black Drink) great greandson of James McQuees, a Scotchman who died in 1811 at 128 years old.

Pony Hill, 2006\n\nCopyright ©2006, S. Pony Hill, all rights reserved.\n\nSince the early nineteenth century scholars, ethnologists, anthropologists and historians have been pondering the origins of a population of mixed-bloods residing in and around Robeson County, North Carolina. These self-labeled “Lumbee Indians” now comprise the largest single Indian group east of the Mississippi. The theories of the origins of these people are as many, and varied, as the academics who have studied them. Though obviously of mixed ancestry, the Lumbee themselves have consistently self-identified as “Indian” since the earliest contact, as they still do today.\n\nOne of the earliest and longest standing, theories of Lumbee origin, is descendancy from the “Lost Colony.” This theory proposes that the Robeson mixed-bloods descend from the stranded colony of Roanoke who were absorbed by nearby Indian tribes. Though based on no solid evidence, it remains the most wide-spread theory even today. Modern genealogical research has sufficiently proved this theory to be a wild flight of fancy, and the origins of the Lumbee seem to be a far cry less romantic. The preponderance of evidence shows that the Lumbee bloodlines are composed primarily of two types; those of Indian-White mixture (primarily of mixed tribal bands residing on the Bertie County ‘Tuscarora’ reservation), and those of White-Indian-and a dubious third stock described in many records as “Portuguese.”\n\nDuring the Tuscarora War of 1711-13 in North Carolina, a division of the Tuscarora (called the “Northern Tuscarora” at that time) under chief Tom Blount remained friendly to the whites and were settled at Fort Christanna, Virginia, along with several remnant Siouan tribes and at least one small band of Chowan-Nansemond. At the Close of the War, the Tuscarora under Blount in addition to “remnants of allied tribes still remaining in that country”(1) were moved to a reservation in present-day Bertie County, North Carolina along the banks of the Roanoke River. The Blount Tuscarora and other Fort Christanna Indians by this time were heavily acculturated, predominantly Christian, and the vast majority English speaking. Lumped together here under the title “Tuscarora” were many varied bands of Algonquin, Siouan, and Iroquian descendant mixed-bloods. On this reservation is where we discover the roots of the majority of the Robeson people.\n\nThe founding families of Robeson mixed-bloods arrived in the Drowning Creek area during the era 1750 to 1770. Early land grants and wills can trace these individuals back to Bertie and Edgecombe Counties on the banks of the Roanoke River. Migration from the Tuscarora reservation was a well accepted fact among the historians of the area as recounted in newspapers and memoirs. (2) Indeed, even a Lumbee elder was quoted as recounting “We have always been the friends of white men. We were a free people long before the white men came to our land. Our tribe was always free. They lived in Roanoke in Virginia.”(3) as well as an Act of the General Assembly of North Carolina in 1885 stated “Whereas the Indians now living in Robeson County claim to be descendants of a friendly tribe who once resided in eastern North Carolina, on the Roanoke River…”(4) Non-Tuscarora bands residing on, or near, the Bertie reservation had little or no voice in tribal affairs, and also may have been rendered homeless by the sale of 8,000 reservation acres in 1766. These factors, as well as others may have influenced the migration of Indian families down to the Drowning Creek area. The Lowry family, arguably the most well-known of all the Lumbee stock, are all descended James Lowry who arrived in Robeson in the mid-1750’s and by 1772 owned over a thousand acres in the area. James’ wife was Sarah Kersey, described as a “half-breed Tuscarora Indian.” Thomas Lowry (son of James) married Nancy Deas, a “white woman”; William Lowry (son of James) married Betty Locklear, also a “Half-breed Tuscarora Indian”, and Allen Lowry (son of James),married Polly Cumbo (sic Cumbaa), a “Portuguese woman.” (5) (the Portuguese connection will be discussed later) The Oxendine family, also prominent among the Lumbee, descend from John Oxendine who arrived in the early 1750’s. Oxendine’s exact blood-mixture is impossible to determine but evidence would seem to indicate mostly a Indian-White descent, and he was most certainly married to a white woman.. (6)The Ivey, Chavis, Locklear, Bass, Gibson, and Sweat families all owned land along the Roanoke River area of Edgecombe and Bertie in the 1720-30 era before moving down to Robeson, and it was there that they undoubtedly also intermarried with the reservation Indians.\n\nThe Sweat, Gibson and Bass families bore Indian blood prior to residing in Bertie County. Of Pamunkey Indian origin, the Sweats were prominent in that tribe’s affairs, as was the Bass family among the Nansemond. The Bass’s apparently picked up a Siouan bloodline after marriage into the Harris family in Bertie. (7) The Gibson’s were Siouan Indian inhabitants of the Tuscarora reservation, and also shared a common ancestry with the Chavis family. (8) Later migrations of Indian-White mixed families such as the Jacobs’ also served to bolster the Indian identity of the Drowning Creek community. (9)\n\nThe final Lumbee puzzle piece is the so-called “Portuguese” origins. Throughout the 1800’s, and across three states, this tri-racial identifier has been used by the mixed-blood families to explain physical features their white neighbors attempted to classify as resulting from Negro ancestry. For the most part the Lumbee and related families claimed to be solely of Indian-White mixture, but would occasionally claim Portuguese ancestry to justify non-Indian and non-White characteristics such as bushy hair, thick lips, etc. Jacob Perkins of Tennessee made this claim of Indian-White-Portuguese ancestry in 1858 through his grandfather, Joshua Perkins, who had resided in Robeson and married Polly Black, a “fair-skinned Scotch woman.” (10) Polly Cumbaa was described as a “Portuguese woman” while married to Allen Lowry in Robeson. (11) Finally Thomas Hagans claimed the same Indian-White-Portuguese mixture in 1809 South Carolina through his grandfather, Thomas Ivey of Drowning Creek who was described as “of Portuguese descent, that his complexion was swarthy, his hair black and strait – that his wife was a Free White woman, very clear complexion.” (12) Early accounts of the Lumbee in Robeson seem to agree with this Indian-White-Portuguese identity. (13) Two surnames common among the Lumbee and their cousins in South Carolina appear to have roots in the Spanish-Portuguese; Chavis from ‘Chavez’ and Driggers from ‘Rodrigus’ as it was originally in Northampton, Virginia.\n\nThe shorelines of the Chesapeake Bay area in Virginia appears to be area from which this Portuguese bloodline sprung, including Nothampton, York, and Surry Counties. Portuguese slaves such as Francisco Payne, Phillip Mongon, King Toney, Peter George, Emmanuel Rodrigus, and Bashaw Fernando were imported here in the 1640’s by land-owning gentlemen such as Nathaniel Littleton, Francis Pott, Capt. William Hawley, John Custis, John Eyres, and William Taylor. Being identified as Portuguese during this era almost assuredly implies that these individuals were already mixed-blooded before settling foot on American soil. Portuguese slaves in the early 1600’s were most often a myriad of racial backgrounds, including Brazilian Natives, Canary Islanders, Mediterranean Arabs, East Indians, and of course West Coast Africans. Regardless of their actual racial makeup these Portuguese ‘slaves’ enjoyed a social and legal existence much more like sharecroppers, as they maintained their own property and enjoyed legal protections equal to whites. A description of their life is reflected by one slave;\n\n“Now Mr. Taylor and I divided our Corne and I am very glad of it now I know myne…owne ground I will work when I please and play when I please.” (14)\n\nBy the 1680’s most of these Portuguese slaves and their children were living on the lands of the Gingaskin Indian tribe in Northampton. Court records reveal that the Portuguese Payne, George, Driggers (shortened from Rodrigus), and Francis/Cisco (shortened from Fransico) families had married into the Cross, Press, Bingham, Jacobs, and Jeffery Indian families of Gingaskin, and also that the white servant families of Harmon, Webb, Brooks, Beckett, and Carter had intermarried heavily with both Portuguese and Indian. Out-migrations of some of these individuals to such areas as Surry and Louisa Counties in the mid 1700’s resulted in intermarriage with the Bunch and Goins families who later also resided in Robeson and surrounding areas. The Francis family intermarried with the Chavis family in North Carolina in the early 1740’s, just as the Jacobs, Jefferys, George, Harmon, Carter, and Driggers did with the Bass, Perkins, Gibson, and Sweat families. It is quite obvious that the Indian-White-Portuguese mixture was pronounced even before exposure to the reservation Indians in Bertie County. (15)\n\nAs we have discovered, the origins of the mixed-blood population of Robeson County (and its subsequent offshoots) is no mystery. Adequate historical documentation exists to identify the roots of their Indian-White-Portuguese ancestors. The record is clear that their ancestors were early Virginia and North Carolina white settlers, Indians residing on the Gingaskin reservation in Northampton County, Indians of various tribes residing on the Tuscarora reservation in Bertie County, and also dark-skinned ‘Portuguese’ servants of the Chesapeake Bay area.\n\n(1) Hodge, Fredrick, “Handbook of American Indians”, 1906\n\n(2) 1875 Jno Gurman Memoirs, “A century ago, a few members of the Tuscarora tribe of Indians lived upon the banks of the Roanoke River in Halifax Co.
