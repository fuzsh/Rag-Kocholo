        "text": "Part 3 — “I Don’t Like White Men Very Much”\n\nInterested in a first-hand account of Native American history, the Trail of Tears, and Oklahoma Indian Territory? One of my first cousins a few generations removed wrote extensive journals detailing my family’s story, as well as the history, experiences, and culture of the Muscogee-Creek tribe.\n\nThe Muscogee-Creek Nation was one of the largest and most powerful of the “five civilized tribes” of the southeast U.S.: Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Seminole, and Creek. His 44 diaries were used as the basis for the book George Washington Grayson and the Creek Nation: 1834–1920. Much of this information is taken from the book, as well as from stories told to me by my father, aunts, and uncles.\n\nThe story begins with Robert Grierson, our great x4 grandfather, who was born in Scotland around 1740. He immigrated to the American colonies in the early 1800s with his brothers James, William, and Thomas, and a sister Anna. Coming to make their fortunes in a new land, they were sons of a Scottish clan leader, tracing their lineage back to the times of Robert the Bruce, Scotland’s first king.\n\nOne of the brothers, James Grierson, fought on the side of the British in the United States War of Independence and became an infamous villain, who was ultimately executed by colonial forces. He showed up as a character in Jimmy Carter’s historical fiction novel, “The Hornets’ Nest.\n\nRobert and the other brothers settled among the Muscogee Creek tribe. Robert married a local Creek woman named Sin-o-gee, of the Spangalee Clan. Sin-o-gee was not Creek by birth, but came from Florida, possibly of mixed Native American, Black, and Spanish blood. Like many others, she found refuge with the Creek tribe. So, Robert and Sin-o-gee were both adopted into the tribe, howbeit from different backgrounds. The Grierson surname was adapted to Grayson for easier pronunciation and grew to become one of the large and prominent families of the Muscogee Creek Nation today.\n\nFirst European Settlers in North American & Bad Things Happen\n\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, the Muscogee Creek population numbered about 200,000. Decimated by European diseases, by the time whites had started living among them in the later 1700s and 1800s, that number was down to only 20,000. After The Removal and the Trail of Tears, that number was even lower.\n\nThe Creek Nation lands spanned Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama, and based their social and government structure on a system of towns, there were 40–50 of them, which were made up of smaller villages and clans. They were a settled agricultural society, with organized villages, government, and education. Like most Native American tribes, families went according to matrilineal lines. Up until the arrival of the whites, Creek towns were fairly autonomous.\n\nThe influx of white settlers and European powers had a devastating effect on the Creek Nation. Europeans encouraged the concept of a more unified structure, less autonomy, and a primary chief or “king” of the tribe who they could deal with.\n\nAs demand for manufactured items from white traders grew, Creek society was transformed from a stable farming and hunting culture into one of commercial hunters of animal skins and furs, which could be sold or traded for merchandise from white traders. While traditionally the men had carried out the heavier agricultural work, this now fell to the women of the tribe. Knowledge of traditional crafts and skills fell out of practice and was lost.\n\nAlcoholism grew. Disease continued to kill off the Muscogees and other natives, who had no natural immunity to these new illnesses.\n\nEuropeans delineated two different groups within the Muscogee Creek Federation: Lower Creeks who lived to the south and were more amenable to white ways and easier to work with, and Upper Creeks who lived to the north, were more traditional and less receptive to white ways and culture.\n\nIt was around this time that British whites began settling among the Creeks and marrying into the tribe. The Creeks were anything but xenophobic and readily accepted outsiders into their midst. Village life and farming, trading, folk medicine, weapons of war, and love of hunting were all things that the English and Creek had in common and made them adaptable to each other.\n\nFrom these whites that lived in the Creek Nation came a new element in native society, the mixed-blood children of these Creek-British marriages. With names like McGillivray, McIntosh, Kenard, and Grierson, the children of these families were often better educated than the white settlers who desired their lands.\n\nWhile the racism prevalent in white society was not so welcoming for those of mixed blood, the Creek Nation had always welcomed foreigners, and there was no discrimination from full-blooded Creeks. In fact, those of mixed blood were respected for their ability in dealing with whites, and they became some of the leading politicians and businessmen in the tribe.\n\nProbably the most powerful (and helpful) of these men was Alexander McGillivray, son of Lachlan McGillivray and a member of the leading Wind Clan. He was adept at diplomacy and played the English, French, and Spanish European powers off of each other for most of his leadership career, to the benefit of the Creek Nation.\n\nLife in the Muscogee Creek Native American Tribe\n\nRobert Grierson was one of these educated Europeans who chose to live in the Creek Nation. He started out as a trader. The Indian agent Samuel Hawkins had begun to encourage plantation-style farming and cattle raising among the Creeks of Alabama starting in 1797. So Robert Grierson transitioned from trading to farming, and managed a large and successful farm, growing food and cotton, and raising livestock.\n\nRobert lived with his wife Sin-o-gee and their eight children. He was respected in the community as he often served as a translator or assisted in negotiations with whites and the federal government. However, during the Red Stick War of 1813–1814, he lost everything. Red Stick warriors had been instructed to destroy all that had come from the whites, and that included Grierson’s properties.\n\nThe youngest Grierson (Grayson) child, Katy Grayson, was our great x 3 grandmother. She married a Creek warrior by the name of Tulwa Tustunugee, meaning “wolf warrior.” He was of mixed blood like Katy, his father a full-blood Creek medicine man by the name of Intakfhakphy, and his mother a Scots-Irish woman named Mary Benson.\n\nMary had been captured as a child and then adopted and assimilated into the tribe. Her brother found her later as an adult, but she preferred to remain with her Creek clan and family. Two of her sons opted to move to Georgia with white relatives for schooling, wore European clothing, and were known by their English names of Dick and Jack Benson. The other two sons, Emathla Hutke and Tulwa Tustunuggee, remained as warriors among the Creek tribe.\n\nThey both fought in the Red Stick War, a civil war fought between the Creeks who followed Tecumsah’s movement to return to traditional lifestyle, and Creeks who were more acculturated to white ways. The conflict spilled over to white settlements, resulting in the 1813 massacre at Fort Mims.\n\nThe Fort Mims incident resulted in the intervention of the U.S. government. General Andrew Jackson was furious and determined to get back at the Creeks. A large number of native people were taking refuge at a place called Horseshoe Bend, which was attacked by the US army.\n\nTulwa was shot multiple times and only survived because his brother Emathla Hutke carried him off the battlefield in the dark and hid him in the swamps, then carried Tulwa on his back through the swamps to a safe place where he could be cared for by Creek medicine men. After some time he recovered, but they never removed the 10 bullets, and those remained in his body and gave him pain in later life.\n\nLater when he met and married Katie Grayson, he moved into the sphere of the more well-to-do mixed-blood Creeks. But he never forgot the Battle of Horseshoe Bend and was a Creek nationalist for the rest of his life. And although it seemed that Katy had married below her station, they had a happy union and raised 10 children together.\n\nThe Indian Removal Act and the Trail of Tears\n\nDespite the fact that a faction of Creeks had fought on the side of the whites in the Red Stick War, the whole tribe was punished. In 1830 and 1833, Congress signed the Indian Removal Acts, the enforced relocation of the five civilized tribes from their traditional lands in the Southeast to Oklahoma Territory.\n\nI won’t go into the terrible story of the abuses committed by white settlers once this act was signed and they knew that Creeks had to sell their farms and leave. Natives were defrauded, cheated and taken advantage of, forced out of their homes without mercy or payment. Or how U.S. soldiers arrived in Native American towns, loading people up into wagons without warning or notice, and then corralled in army stockades to await deportation from Alabama. The laws of those days did little to protect Native Americans or those not of the white race.\n\nThen followed the Trail of Tears. My family says that that name came not only from the tears of the Native Americans but of the settlers along the road who witnessed their suffering.\n\nSomewhere along the Trail of Tears, a little girl from the Natchez tribe walked alone. Her whole family had died on the trail of disease or hunger. She was adopted and cared for by a Creek family who were also walking the trail, and grew up to become another of my great-grandmothers, Lucy I-yok-hogee.\n\nKaty and Tulwa, and others of the Grayson family, traveled to Oklahoma at their own expense, with their own wagons, which made their journey safer as they were not under the control of the U.S. Army. Robert Grierson had passed on by this time, but Sin-o-gee also traveled to Oklahoma with the family. My aunts recounted stories from this time, and of how the family would hide their nice dishes and pretty things when the army was around, as they were afraid they’d be robbed by the soldiers.\n\nLife in the Oklahoma Indian Territory — Until Treaties are Broken Again\n\nEastern Oklahoma turned out to be a green fertile land. Still, life in the early days there was very hard, and people died of disease and starvation, as the U.S. government failed in their promise of supplies in the first year. Katy’s family had built cabins and lived by farming and hunting. Katy Grayson had inherited slaves from her father, not a good thing, but that’s how they had the manpower to rebuild their lives in that new land. (Before the days when plantation farming was introduced, blacks were welcomed into the tribe and treated no differently than anyone else. According to Claudio Saunt in his book, Black, White, and Indian: Race and the Unmaking of an American Family:\n\nThe most personal choices — to honor a friendship or pursue an intimate relationship — were often necessarily guided by the harsh economic realities imposed by the country’s racial hierarchy. Few families in American history embody this struggle to survive the pervasive onslaught of racism more than the Graysons.\n\nKaty wanted her children to be educated, so they settled near North Fork Town. They had 10 children, including my great x 2 grandfather Thomas Grayson. Thomas married a Creek woman named Winey, the daughter of Lucy I-Yok-Hogee, the Natchez Indian orphan from the Trail of Tears. Thomas died at a young age. He got drunk, rode his horse into a saloon, and was shot.\n\nHis wife Winey lived a long time, was the midwife at the birth of her grandchildren, and was known by her great-grandchildren, including my father. Her daughter and my great-grandmother Louisa died in childbirth, and Winey helped to raise her children, my grandmother Lucie and great-aunt Lillie.\n\nOne day, while living with Lillie’s family in New Mexico when she was old, she put her medicine bag around her neck and went out all day. She passed away that evening in 1946. Did she take something from her medicine bag that caused her passing? We wonder. But we’ll never know. By then, my grandmother Lucie had nine children, and my father was a young man.\n\nWe know all these details of our family through the journals of our cousin, George Washington Grayson. (My grandma was acquainted with his son, Wash.) He saw the handwriting on the wall, that the whites were seeking to wipe out the Native American culture and way of life, and he felt that knowledge of the Muscogee Creek Nation and traditions would be lost if he didn’t write about it — so he did.\n\nHe was a leading statesman and businessman in the Creek Nation. Although he was ¾ white, and looked Scottish, being brought up in Oklahoma Indian Territory among the Creek Tribe, he was thoroughly Creek in identity. He was well-educated and spent a lot of his time as a member of Native American delegations to Washington D.C. where he fought tirelessly for the preservation of Native American sovereignty.\n\nThere was much pressure in these times for American Indians to assimilate into white society and to follow the customs of the whites. G.W. Grayson and other Native leaders argued that Creek society had none of the problems of the white economic system, no poverty, no workhouses. So why should they copy the whites? Their own economic system based on communal landholding worked much better.\n\nAccording to G.W. Grayson,\n\n“He never forgot the broken promises, and that the all-absorbing cupidity of the white race was a constant in Indian-white relationships. Nor did he miss the irony that whites scorned Indians as “savages” while behaving in a savage manner toward Indians. From within the dynamic, inclusive Creek culture, he accepted what he found good in white civilization and used it to his advantage; but he feared and resisted as long as possible submerging his and his nation’s identity in that alien flood.” (George Washington Grayson and the Creek Nation: 1843–1920 by Mary Jane Ward.)\n\nFinally, in 1899, the Oklahoma Land Act was passed, and the decision was made to abolish tribal lands and government. The U.S. government granted 160-acre parcels of land to all Native American inhabitants of Oklahoma Territory, as well as to white settlers who applied."
