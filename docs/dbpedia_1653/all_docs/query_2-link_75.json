        "text": "My very first teacher was Melinda Atkins, who taught me from when I was six until I left Sydney for London aged 18. She influenced me in every way and I am forever grateful for her selfless dedication. Musically, she taught me that the saxophone can accommodate any musical voice, in any genre. She also taught me that if I had a dream and worked hard enough, I could do anything I wanted.\n\nProbably the limitations of the repertoire – however, expanding it has been one of my greatest joys, so it works both ways.\n\nIn 2004 I won a competition in Sydney, and the final was held at the Sydney Opera House, with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. I think about 400 family and friends were in the audience that night, and it meant a lot, to many of us.\n\nMy arrangement of Philip Glass’s Violin Concerto No. 1 has been the most challenging piece of my career so far, and it’s always a thrill to perform.\n\nListen to music, particularly when traveling. There’s something about listening whilst looking out the window of a plane – it just opens up the imagination and lets me dream. Also, taking my repertoire for a walk – working through it in my head, away from the technical challenges of the instrument.\n\nMuch of my repertoire is new, so quite often it will be based around what new pieces I am premiering.\n\nAnywhere with a magical acoustic – especially when I’m playing with musical soulmates.\n\nStart at the grassroots. I’m always amazed that when I play to a group of primary school children. They will be totally absorbed by a lengthy piece of solo Bach – whereas a popular theme tune will lose their attention after 20 seconds. Children are like sponges – they are attracted to the complexity of classical music – and they just haven’t been told ‘not to like it’ yet.\n\nThe times when I’ve been playing with a musical soulmate – someone who listens acutely, and understands phrasing in the same way as I do. Those moments are the best.\n\nSee above! Those moments are what it’s all about.\n\nDelve deep into your heart to find your true passion – then dedicate everything you have to it.\n\nAmy Dickson began her musical studies at the age of two and took her first saxophone lesson in Sydney aged six. She made her concerto debut at 16, and on her 18th birthday made her first recording as soloist with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. That year she moved to London to study at the Royal College of Music, then at the Conservatorium van Amsterdam.\n\nAs well as receiving the James Fairfax Australian Young Artist of the Year award, she was the first ever saxophonist to win the Gold Medal at the Royal Overseas League Competition, the Symphony Australia Young Performer of the Year award and The Prince’s Prize.\n\nDickson is a brilliant interpreter of contemporary music and is devoted to the development of new repertoire for the classical saxophone. Working closely with many living composers, she has already made a substantial contribution to the legacy of the instrument’s concerto, chamber and solo repertoire.\n\nread more\n\n(Image credit: Christian Mushenko)"
