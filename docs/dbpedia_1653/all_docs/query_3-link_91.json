        "text": "Hi Friends! I‚Äôm Amy Lewis ‚Äì Travel Advisor with MVP! After a 20 year career in the banking industry, I left the field to pursue a career where I could work from home and be more actively involved in my amazing busy kids day to day activities. As I was searching for my next move, family and friends kept saying I should become a Travel Advisor ‚Äì as I was already helping them plan all of their trips! I am so blessed to have found MVP! I have been married to my husband Curtis for 16 years and we have two boys, Douglas (11) and Calvin (8).\n\nOur family spends as much time as we can making memories traveling! We LOVE Disney World and have been over 15 times as a family! We also love cruising and beach vacations! We also love to travel the United States visiting different sports stadiums and arenas!\n\nI am so blessed to have found a career that incorporates my passion for family and traveling! I would be honored to help your family plan your next Magical Vacation! Whether it is Disney, a cruise, island, international or anything in between, please let me know how I can help!\n\nHi! I‚Äôm a mother of 4 grown children and one still in high school. My amazing husband and I have been married for over 30 years and are looking forward to the next 30 and more! I love my work as an office coordinator for a small charter school here in Oregon. When not at a Disney park, we enjoy camping, boating, road trips and hanging out with friends. I have been bitten by the Disney bug for over 40 years, and I‚Äôm so excited to have the opportunity to share the magic with you!\n\nI visited Disneyland, California, as a child many times with my family, and many times in the past several years. Whether by myself, with my best friend, or with my family, Disneyland is where it all started, so it holds a special place in my heart.\n\nAfter I was married, my husband and I visited Walt Disney World in Orlando, and we have been vacationing there ever since. We‚Äôve been by ourselves, with couples, with our family of two that expanded to 7 in a matter of months through adoption, with extended family, and with groups. And guess what, I‚Äôve done all of the planning for these trips, and I loved it!\n\nThere‚Äôs so much to do and see at Disney World, you can go back time after time and always experience something new and enchanting! Yes, Disney is my ‚Äúhappy place‚Äù and I‚Äôm ready to share what I know, and continue to learn, as the parks are ever growing and developing.\n\nDon‚Äôt forget about Disney cruises, Adventures by Disney, Vero Beach, Hilton Head, Aulani, Hawaii, and Euro Disney. With parks around the globe, you have vacations to go on for many years! I‚Äôm here to help you with your journey to having a magical vacation of your own no matter where you plan to enjoy it. üôÇ\n\nHello!\n\nMy name is Amber Wilson and I want to be your travel planner! There is nothing better than seeing the world!\n\nI was born and raised in Cape Girardeau, Missouri and still live here. I graduated from Missouri State University. I have three children, ages 15, 14, and 9, and one dog. The majority of my time is spent with my husband traveling to sporting events and dance recitals!\n\nMy parents instilled the value of travel in me at a young age. I love to be on the go and see as much as I can see. No matter if it is just me and my husband, or with the kids, or with friends, there is truly is nothing better than seeing the world.\n\nHi! I chose to become an MVP because I truly have a passion for vacations and all things Disney. Making memories with your family is so important, and I‚Äôd love to help take the stress out of planning.\n\nI have a 13 year old son and 15 year old daughter and we took them to Disney for the first time at ages 3 and 5 and the only way I can describe the vacation was truly magical. When we left Magic Kingdom on the last night, my daughter blew a kiss to the castle and said, ‚ÄúGoodbye Disney, I love you.‚Äù I cried the whole way home; tears of joy, magic, happiness, nostalgia, and a little sad knowing there would never be another ‚Äúfirst Disney trip.‚Äù\n\nI work at the University of Louisville full-time, and do this not because I have to, but because I want to. What better way to spend time than on your passions?!?!\n\nMy daughter was born in 2006, followed by a son in 2008. My husband (Jeff) and I took them to Disney when they were 5 and 3 in 2011. We had an incredible experience I‚Äôll never forget. As we were leaving Magic Kingdom on the last night, my daughter threw an ‚Äúair hug‚Äù at the Castle and said, ‚ÄúGoodbye Disney. I‚Äôll miss you.‚Äù And I cried the whole way home. Tears of joy, tears of happiness, and maybe a little sadness that we were leaving. I knew when I went to bed that night, that something momentous had happened. I‚Äôd been bitten by the Disney bug! We‚Äôve since been several times, and while each vacation is magical in its own way, the magic from that first trip will stay with all of us forever.\n\nI would love to help you plan a magical trip. I chose to become an MVP because I‚Äôm passionate about a few things: Disney, Harry Potter, and Family Vacations. Life is short. Make magical memories every opportunity you have!\n\nHi-ya Pals! I am a mother of 2, a wife, and a life long Disney fan! My WDW love started when I visited with my family as a child. When I was in high school I was able to perform with my marching band and march down main street as well as sing with my school‚Äôs choir. Within the last five years I was able to bring my children for their first Disney trip and just like Christmas it is a new experience to see the Magic Kingdom and character meet a greets through a child‚Äôs eyes. Last year I was able to visit with my husband and do Disney as a couple and it was just as magical.\n\nI specialize in the Walt Disney World resort, but I am also very knowable about Disneyland, the Disney Cruise Lines, and Adventures by Disney. I can also book other cruises as well as all inclusive resorts.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for someone to talk Disney World, I‚Äôm your girl! Please know that part of the reason I became a Magical Vacation Planner was because when I was planning my first trip with my kiddos I wasn‚Äôt able to find a knowable agent in our area. By the time we took our trip, I knew far more about Disney than our agent did and I vowed I would do everything in my power to prevent that from happening to someone else. I promise to work my hardest to make sure you have the most MAGICAL trip possible!\n\nI can‚Äôt wait to making memories and magic for my clients!\n\nHello! My name is Allie.

I have a gypsy soul with traveling and venturing; trying new things and learning about different cultures or what drives people. A lover of sunsets, all things small: babies, animals, and the little things we need to hold onto ‚Äì a hopeless romantic and always striving to find the good in people.\n\nMy heart urns to make people happy ‚Äì whether its a simple gesture or giving the shirt off my back; I try to make sure that humanity is still very much alive and around.

I am Ashley Baker. I am a mother to four amazing fur-babies that help to represent my love for all things DISNEY! Their names are Flower, Lilo, Maximus, and Mowgli. I fell in love with Disney on my first trip. I was 10 years old. That first trip was the most magical vacation ever and I will never forget those memories with my family. There were 18 of us on that trip! Every trip after that one, I was searching for magic like that first trip and every time, Disney was able to provide it! Every time I walk up Main Street and see the castle, I am flooded with emotions and I am a child again! My hope is to help other people create some magical memories that last a lifetime!\n\nNo matter the vacation destination, I would love to help answer your questions and make more memories to last a life time!! Let me know how I can help you!\n\nHello! My name is Amber Carper and here is a little about me. üôÇ\n\nI was born and raised in Hilliard, Ohio and now reside in Commercial Point, Ohio. I have been married for 15 years to my husbands, Chris, and we have a 4 year old boy named Jaxson. He is our world! I have a 20 year career background in healthcare and customer service. When we were expecting though, I was blessed enough to become a stay at home mom. Long story (journey) short, we tried to start a family for 10 years and with the assistance of some pretty amazing doctors we welcomed our son in 2018. As a lot of stay at home mothers though, I wanted to still help contribute to my family financially in some way.\n\nI‚Äôve always had a deep love and passion for travel. I‚Äôve been very fortunate to experience a lot of amazing places around the world in my lifetime. A lot to still check off my bucket list! With always being so dedicated and savvy on finding deals and doing all the research that is involved with planning a trip, I decided to turn it into a career move for myself. I have been with Magical Vacation Planner since 2019 and have loved every moment. While unfortunate to have started a career in travel assistance right before a pandemic hit, I am beyond excited to see where this opportunity takes me longterm. I specialize in Disney and Universal, but I have learned and experienced a lot and been provided some amazing knowledge and tools when it comes to Cruising, All-Inclusive destinations, and other great vacation spots around the world.\n\nI look forward to helping you plan your next adventure and appreciate you supporting a small business and career dream!Amber has always had a passion for traveling and planning out trips. Her obsession with Disney though started in 2009 when her and her spouse went on their very first Disney Adventure together. Since then they have visited Disney World 5 times and can not wait to take their son on his first Disney Trip in 2020.\n\nDisney is not just another vacation, it‚Äôs a magical journey everyone should experience once in their lifetime.\n\nYou get one life, so why not enjoy it? See everything you have dreamt of seeing around this amazing world we live in? Yes, it may take some saving up, but you should do and see everything on that Bucket List of yours.\n\n‚ÄúIn bad times and in good, I have never lost my zest for life.‚Äù~Walt Disney\n\nIt would be Amber‚Äôs previlage to plan your next vacation.

I am married to my college sweetheart and best friend, Daniel. And I‚Äôm a stay at home mom to two beautiful little girls. My passion for all things Disney and cruises began when I was a little girl.

These are the moments and memories I want to create for you and your family.

I never had the opportunity to visit Disney World until I was in high school but immediately fell in love with it!

All of my friends and family know that if they have any questions about Disney or a Disney vacation to ask me!\n\nI am so excited to help other families plan their magical vacations to Disney! I will work closely with you on every aspect of your vacation from the time you request a quote to your travel time. My priority is to make your vacation as stress-free as possible. You are in excellent care with me!\n\nMy first taste of travel and adventure started when I was offered the opportunity to live with a family in Spain while in High School. Since then, I have planned vacations all over the world including: Egypt, Iceland, Greece, Eastern and Western Europe, Mexico, Caribbean, Costa Rica and last but never least Disney World. Disney truly is a place of wonder, and I believe everyone should have the experience of feeling the magic that Disney offers.\n\nI have advanced knowledge and expertise in cruising and just recently returned from a Disney Cruise! It has forever changed my life. I have been on 12 cruises and have the great pleasure of experiencing different ones as well. I have been on Princess, Carnival, MSC, and a Nile Cruise. I would love the opportunity to plan your Disney vacation, cruise or other adventures we have to offer. When I am not planning your or my next escape, I work as a Nurse Practitioner and love being with my daughter, husband and our two fur babies!\n\nAmanda‚Äôs first trip to Main Street, USA left her speechless ‚Äì at 25 years old. She has never eaten a poisoned apple or pricked her finger on a spinning wheel, and she hasn‚Äôt had a midnight curfew since she was a teenager. When she visits Disney World, though, she feels all of the magic just the same. Disney magic has no age limit. As a military wife, Amanda has lived in five states and counting, and she is currently blessed to be living in Kansas with her husband and toddler ‚Äì for another month! Then it‚Äôs off to Kentucky. They miss finding themselves at Disney World a few weekends each month, but it‚Äôs fun to be planning more extravagant vacations for her own family again! She loves planning Disney vacations and getaways for her own family and friends, and she is looking forward to helping plan your vacation!ary wife, Amanda has lived in five states and counting, and she is currently blessed to be living in Kansas with her husband and toddler.

I‚Äôm Ashley and I am so excited to be a part of the MVP family. I have always been passionate about traveling and experiencing new and exciting destinations. I also love all things Disney. My Disney obsession went to a whole new level after my first visit to Walt Disney World with my husband and two children and continues to grow with each visit.\n\nI am a big believer in creating memories with my family and taking a family vacation is a perfect way to create memories that will last a lifetime. Some of my favorite memories have been made at Disney including watching my son get his first kiss from Snow White, hearing my son talk about his first crush immediately falling said kiss, watching my daughter transform into a princess at Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, seeing my kids start the Indiana Jones Show as Junior Directors, and the feeling I had when I completed my first ¬Ω marathon at the Disney Princess ¬Ω Marathon.\n\nMy goal is to help others experience the magic of Disney and create their own lasting memories. I love planning Disney vacations just as much as I enjoy taking them. Let me plan your next vacation and turn your Disney dream into reality.\n\nEver since I can remember, I have LOVED everything Disney. I was very fortunate growing up that my family was able to visit Florida each year, and spend a little bit of time at Disney World. My favorite memories are visiting Epcot and the Magic Kingdom, who can resist ‚Äúits a small world?‚Äù As a child, it was a MUST to ride Journey Into Imagination as well as riding Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and the Haunted Mansion.\n\nAfter getting married and having a child I was very eager to get back to Disney after so many years. Shortly after my son turned 2 (2017) we took our first trip as a family, he instantly turned into a Disney World fan! YAY!! While there my husband kept mentioning what he wanted to do on our next trip, I knew he was hooked! Fortunately we were able to visit Walt Disney World twice in a year and a half and plan to take our first Disney Cruise in a few months.\n\nGoing on Disney vacations is my favorite and it has allowed me to transcend that excitement to my family and friends. Anytime someone tells me they‚Äôre going on a Disney vacation, my face lights up and I immediately start asking them questions and suggesting activities to make their trip memorable and exciting. If you‚Äôre considering visiting any of Disney‚Äôs properties, whether it‚Äôs Walt Disney World, Disneyland, Aulani ‚Äì A Disney Resort and Spa, Disney Cruise Line, or Adventures by Disney, I encourage you to reach out to me so I can help make your trip a magical one!\n\nAlyssa is a lifelong lover of all things Disney. Since her first visit to Walt Disney World as a child to the annual trips she now takes as an adult she has spent countless hours learning the secrets to planning a truly magical vacation. Not only has she visited Walt Disney World in Florida, Disneyland in California, and Aulani in Hawaii, but she even had the honor of working at Walt Disney World in Orlando as a dancer when she was still in junior high school.\n\nShe and her husband enjoy exploring not only the World of Disney, but also the world in general. After visiting over 50 countries on 4 Continents and sailing the oceans with 5 of the major cruise companies, she decided it was time to share her love and knowledge of travel with others. Alyssa is excited to use what she has learned through the years to help families experience the magic and joy of a special family vacation.\n\nEver since childhood, I have loved going on vacations! Who doesn‚Äôt!? I love relaxing at resorts & on beaches, exploring multiple destinations on cruises, eating all different kinds of foods, & most of all, going back to Disney World over & over again! I‚Äôve experienced Disney many different ways starting with family vacations growing up. Eventually the planning became up to me! Vacation planning, especially Disney, can be stressful & overwhelming but I love to research & am very detail oriented! I showed my husband the ‚Äúadult side‚Äù of Disney the first time we went together! We dined at fancy restaurants, got couples massages, & enjoyed the nightlife. Now that we have a toddler, I have experienced Disney in a whole new way & I look forward to new experiences & every trip being different as he grows up.\n\nMy family also loves cruising! My husband & I got engaged on a cruise so they always bring back those special memories! I love keeping up with new ships being built & what they have to offer, as well as their destinations. I‚Äôve explored many places in the Caribbean but Bermuda is my favorite!\n\nI find the planning & anticipation of a trip also enjoyable & love to help & ease the stress of others that may not feel the same! I also love to share my knowledge & help others create their own memories!\n\nI live in Bedford with my husband and two children. I grew up loving all things Disney and had all the movies, all the dolls, and could sing all the songs (still can!). I visited Disneyland when I was 13 years old and can still remember being in awe. Several years later I was able to share my love of Disney with my husband and our children. My first trip to Walt Disney World was when my children were 4 and almost 2. I was once again in awe but there is something so magical about seeing Disney World through the eyes of your children. We were hooked! We made it a mission to get back to Disney World as often as possible. We love being in our ‚ÄúDisney bubble‚Äù where we are free to enjoy each other‚Äôs company at our favorite place in the whole world.\n\nI am a self-proclaimed Disnerd with a pretty impressive collection of Minnie ears! I have stayed at many of the resorts and have visited most of them. I love finding new merchandise sneaking bits of Disney into my everyday life, shoes, shirts, phone cases, wallets, etc. I have experience in planning and taking trips with toddlers, little kids, older kids, and pre-teens. My son had his first haircut at Disney and my daughter has had a makeover at the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, both were amazing experiences. My husband and I have also taken an adults only trip. That is the best thing about Disney, it‚Äôs great for all ages!\n\nI am constantly researching and reading about all the new things coming to the parks. I love helping other families discover the magic and wonder of Disney. Any day that I can spend part of the day talking about Disney is a great day! I would love to help your family make new memories at the most magical place on earth.\n\nAnthony‚Äôs love for Disney started later in life. When he and his wife took their two young girls to Disney in late 1990‚Äôs, he was hooked. There is just something about being in that magical place that brings our the little child in all of us. My favorite park at Disney world is Epcot. From the World showcase to the educational rides, it never gets old. Now that my girls are grown, I still want to go back to experience the magic as often as I can.\n\nWhen Anthony is not planning magical vacations, he teaches information technology to college students. He always talks about the fun and adventure of Disney and hopes that he can help his students build a dream for their lives just like Disney does for all their guests.\n\nFeel free to contact Anthony today, so he can assist you in booking your next magical vacation!\n\nAreas of focus: All things cruises: Carnival Cruise Lines, Royal Caribbean, Disney Cruises, MSC, Norwegian, Viking Cruises, Holland America, Princess Cruises, Celebriy X Cruises, Ama Waterway, and Azamara Club Cruises, as well as, Universal Orlando Resort.\n\nGrowing up in a home of Disney fanatics, Disney World was the classic destination for most of my favorite childhood memories! Marrying an amazingly supportive husband and becoming the mother to our two beautiful daughters has made me cherish memories that much more.

WDW is my favorite but Universal Orlando Resort has become just as important for our family and we go at least once or twice a year with our trips to Orlando!

I‚Äôve never looked back!\n\nThe emotions I feel when planning a Vacation, Destination Wedding, Honeymoon, or any vacation cannot be felt with anything else I would ever do. I truly put my heart into helping every single Client and cherish the joy it brings to them!\n\nIf there is anything we have learned from the last few years alone, it‚Äôs that time goes by too quick. I love being able to take the stress out of the planning process for my Clients so they can sit back and enjoy the magic of memories!\n\nAs child I would watch satellite TV to watch Disney shows and learn about the parks. The magic that I could feel just from watching created my Disney obsession. As I grew the love of Disney did as well. I began working at the Disney Store when I graduated high school. For 3 years it was an amazing place to learn the ins and outs of Disney as well as a ton of trivia. My husband and I went to Disney for the first time with our 2 year old son in 2002. After seeing his little face light up I decided that we would return as often as possible. By the time 2006 came around I had 2 daughters and our family of 5 went once again. We have been to Disney about 7 times. Trying to go at least every other year staying at different resorts each time.\n\nI absolutely love planning. I especially love to share little secrets to help families make the most out of their vacation. Disney is place to create amazing memories. My hope is to provide a service that will help you enjoy the time beginning to end.\n\nMy love for travel and all things Disney have led me to become a travel planner that specializes in Disney Destinations and more.\n\nWhen I‚Äôm not assisting you with your vacations, you can find me camping with my fianc√© , Justin and our Dogue De Bordeaux, Ellie May or traveling to new places and learning new things.\n\nYou deserve an incredible vacation and I have the skills to make it happen!

I love Disney!!! My first time at Disney was in 1993 it was my Senior Year of High School and our marching band got ask to be in the Disney Parade!!! Well we went and I was hooked!!! I have been going back ever since and our family loves it!!! I love to help people and I love helping people plan their vacations. So people would come to me and ask me to help plan there Disney and other vacations and I would, then I saw the opportunity to where I could help people plan their Disney vacation and other vacations so I signed up and did the interview and was able to come aboard. The reason why I love to help people plan a vacation is seeing the excitement as we plan it together and if their children know about it and they included them in the planning is seeing their faces light up as we go over things. I am hoping one day I can move to Florida and work at one of the Disney Parks, Hotels or Disney Springs. Also I love taking my Family to Disney and we always have a wonderful time and I love the atmosphere at the parks and hotels we have stayed at. We love taking our grandson we love to see his face light up when he got to see Mickey and all the different charters!!! I am so happy to be apart of Magical Vacation Planner and I can not wait to see where this will take me in my new adventurer of helping people plan there vacations!!!"
