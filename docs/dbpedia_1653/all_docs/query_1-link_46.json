        "text": "In the book “Ordinary Injustice” by Amy Bach, chapter four titled “Show Trial”, describes a number of different cases showing wrongful convictions being processed through the criminal justice system based off of false confessions. In Chicago, there was a nine-year-old girl named Lisa Cabassa was found raped and killed in the back of an alley a couple miles from her home. Two months after the rape and murder of Lisa, a witness named Judy called the police to give her testimony on the crime. Her statement consisted of her telling the police the people involved with the crime were named Michael Evans and Paul Terry, whom were teenagers from the neighborhood.

They gave a clear story line from the beginning, middle, and end of the case explaining the reasoning behind why the defendant was convicted and ending on why the conviction was incorrect. These cases made me realize the amount of power one person can have over another. Depending on how hard a prosecutor and defense attorney wants to work to either convict or defend a person will show in the outcome of a case. The chapter exposed the lack of effort prosecutors put in once a person is wrongfully convicted, to help them get out of"
