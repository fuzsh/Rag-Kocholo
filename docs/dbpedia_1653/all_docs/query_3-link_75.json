        "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio – 31 incoming, current, and former Ohio State swimmers and divers competed in U.S. Olympic Team Trials this week. The Buckeyes turned in strong performances, highlighted by Hunter Armstrong clinching a place on Team USA to become a two-time Olympian.\n\nThree Buckeyes, including Armstrong, advanced to finals in more than one event; Armstrong swam in the 100 back and 100 free, Charlie Clark swam the 800 free and the 1500 free and Clayton Chaplin took on the platform and 3-meter dives.\n\nArmstrong placed fourth in the 100 free with a personal-best time of 47.78 to secure a spot in Paris on Team USA's 4x100 free relay team. He finished second in the 100 back finals with a time of 52.72, which will likely secure him a spot to compete in that event in Paris as well; the final determination will be made when the Team USA roster is announced.\n\nClark finished sixth in both the 800 free (7:57.28) and 1500 free (15:12.60). Chaplin placed 10th on platform (675.65) and 12th on the 3-meter (676.75).\n\nIn addition to Armstrong (100 back, 100 free) and Chaplin (platform, 3-meter), eight other Buckeyes competed in semifinals; Hannah Bach (100 breast), Martin Perecinsky (200 back), Krista Marlin (200 back), Daniel Baltes (50 free), Evan Fentress (100 fly), Jack Matthews (3-meter), Janie Boyle (platform) and Amy Fulmer (50 free).\n\n18 personal-best times were recorded over the week, with six Buckeyes turning in personal-best times in two or more events. A full breakdown of each event can be found HERE.\n\n#GoBucks"
