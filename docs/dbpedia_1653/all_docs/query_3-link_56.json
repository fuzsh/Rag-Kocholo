        "text": "Let's start with the end, shall we? The end of ancient Atlantis is a story of misuse of power, corruption and greed. Advanced technologies were used to control people and create fear, rather than to excel evolution and expand consciousness. With the state our world is in now and AI spreading like wildfire, it is not very difficult to see the similarities. Will humanity make a different choice this time? Will we (each of us individually) be able to remember the truth of who we are, set ourselves free form collective traumas around power, corruption and greed, and come home to Oneness within ourselves and Unity with those around us instead? There are a lot of humans out there feeling very lost at the moment. Which is why we need all psychics, mystics, shamans, oracles, priestesses, witches and wisdom keepers of the Earth (whether you call yourself that way or not) to RISE into legendary leadership and do what they came here to do: support the Earth in her ascension process.

Millions of ways to connect to each other. I wish to mention another path and point of view for our collective journey. This path, being based on our experiences of joy, love, loving kindness and gentleness. Each has its own vibration and tone in our life. Each can be given, each can be received. Each can heal us in body and mind. Each can connect us to our spiritual realms. Dr. Edward Bach wrote about our disharmony and our disease. Yet, he also wrote about our being healed. On our being whole beings and living our lives with joy and purpose. In his book called Heal Thyself in chapters 6 and 9 he had this to say: This is a list of qualities to put into our lives: \" Love, Sympathy, Peace, Steadfastness, Gentleness, Strength, Understanding, Tolerance, Wisdom, Forgiveness, Courage, Joy\" Here is a list of the beautiful stages in healing disease: \" Peace, Hope, Joy, Faith, Certainty, Wisdom, Love\" Thank you, Dr. Bach. Wishing you peace. Jennifer\n\nMystics Mysticism is a part of the contemporary self throughout the ages as it appeals to the consciousness with the divine. Mysticism is known as becoming one with the Absolute and establishes an altered state of consciousness. It refers also to the attainment of the insight to the ultimate hidden truths. The extraordinary experience and state of mind in harmony, with the highest form of intelligence, for all existing things are created by the alteration of the same thing, and is the same thing. The immensity of emotion we can experience is the sensation of the mystical and seed of all true art and knowledge. The impenetrable that exists and is observed through the love wisdom, is at the center of true spirituality. Having sensitivity is the mysticism and is having that ‚Äòsine qua non‚Äô, of human instinct. The Sadhu is the appearance of the divine mystic and the holy water that nourishes the spirit in human body. There is a kind of mysticism to all writing and its purpose, every story ever told becomes more mystical a repeated. Money is the mysticism of materialism and seemingly the only possible religion in a materialistic society. The human form incarnates with the story in the heart and what it holds most. Mysticism is the body of Christ from the church of heart. It is of no good hoping able to see in the hereafter, when the visions of life are not clear right now. Mysticism makes matters clear that outward things matter very little and it is only the inward realization which is necessary. In mystic mind it becomes clear that every failure follows a weakness somewhere. The wrong use of every good thing is bad and mirrors that the right use of every bad thing is good. Love keeps back nothing.\n\nFor several centuries, a religion called ‚ÄúNgunza‚Äù has spread to the Kongo kingdom where the spirits of ancestors are invoked, spiritual teachings are provided, but also many therapeutic treatments against bad deeds. The cult of ancestors constitutes one of the central elements of the spiritual life of the Kongo. It essentially consists of renewing the relationship between the community of the living and those of the deceased. Through the vibrations of percussion, chanting, or hand clapping, and body movements, the spirits are called and gradually come to possess the bodies of the Ngunza mediums. Trance is another essential element that prepares the physical body to transcend into the metaphysical body.

Our hearts are breaking into a million pieces. Be still and allow beauty to wash away your pain.\" Whenever I feel powerless to the pain and suffering of the world, I engage in soothing my broken heart through Beauty. Often, listening to my favorite music and reading poetry can soften the blow of the harshness of our earthly reality. Let's be kind and gentle towards each other. Let's heal hatred through love and beauty. Our collective consciousness is a reflection of our individual psyches. The more we can heal ourselves and love the people closest to us, the more we can see love reflected in the collective world. Sending you all Beauty in whatever form you need from the magnificent goddesses of the heavenly realms. Artist: Zeng Hao (ÊõæÊµ©)\n\nOur souls vision roots from the very core of our being and blossoms into the best versions of ourselves, our purpose, our true sense of happiness and belonging. While searching for its true purpose, its vision of what's ideal, goes above and beyond our version of the connotations of these terms. In spirituality, a vision is a supernatural appearance or revelation that can be seen in a dream, trance, or religious ecstasy. Visions are often associated with prophecy and can offer a lens into reality and human nature. They are generally clearer than dreams, but have fewer psychological connotations. Some ways to sharpen your spiritual vision include: Closing your eyes and praying, Asking God for wisdom, Looking for signposts in the Word, Keeping your spiritual antennae up, and Discussing what you're sensing.\n\nThere are those who might try to invalidate you or something you‚Äôve achieved or accomplished. They might try to deny your truth. Their disbelief, criticism, jealousy, or lower vibrational energy cannot change or alter your truth. It is a reflection of them and where they are at on their journey. As they say, misery loves company. You don‚Äôt have to participate in that energy. Don‚Äôt allow it to draw you in to some dark feeding frenzy. Some people look for something or someone to attack. Whatever darkness they might be in or that might be working through them, they might try to knock you off course or get you to doubt yourself. Beware the illusion. When you know your truth, you know and radiate your truth. Not belief‚Ä¶truth. What is, is. What is true is true and no amount of doubt or false light can change it. There are those who might try to deny who you are, or what you do, or why you do it, but if it isn‚Äôt your truth, dissolve it in the light and pureness of your divine love. JP Silver Moon Artist Unknown\n\nDare to be real and you will free yourself! The Christian is called to live in the world but not be of the world. The world's ideology is in direct opposition to real love and intimacy. The world judges by appearance, God looks at the heart. In the culture image or the persona takes presidence and in turn masks the real identity of individuals. Example: You must mold yourself to be accepted. Authenticity in the world is always challenged and in some respects feared by those that march to the rhythms of cultural acceptance. Usually, we are drawn to seek acceptance from the world because we are motivated by wounds- driven by the hurt. Living in the world would be a life of forever morphing into a new trend, a new acceptable identity, a new car, a new look etc. Not that a new car is bad - it is the reason. Example- is the car going to give you your identity? Things cannot define you, trends, clothes etc. This is the lie of the culture. (I am not saying that you can't celebrate life, clothes, fashion etc.) However, these things must never give you your worth! The world can be a very hostile environment! It's very easy to be enslaved by ideology that goes against our purpose for why we are here. We can't get distracted. Love is not found in false identities but in the real. Let us be brave and cross social protocols and connect soul to soul and not persona to persona! Freedom lies in the renewal of self, the awareness that we never had to conform to be accepted. What is needed is we have to be real in order to love!"
