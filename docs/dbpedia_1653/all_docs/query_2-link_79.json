        "text": "“With consummate poise, limpid clarity, and faultless intonation” (Washington Classical Review), Washington, D.C.-based soprano Amy Nicole Broadbent has garnered recognition as a dynamic singer, conductor, and composer. Her vocal repertoire spans from frequent interpretations of Bach, Handel, and other baroque champions through contemporary chamber music and art song. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Amy has been a featured soloist for the Washington National Cathedral’s socially-distant webcast services, including Easter Day 2020. Amy won first place in the Audrey Rooney Bach Competition and the National Society of Arts and Letters’ Winston Voice Competition; she also was a finalist and prizewinner for the New York Oratorio Society Competition at Carnegie Hall, the Annapolis Opera Competition, the Bethlehem Bach Competition, and the Franco-American Grand Concours Vocal Competition.\n\nAmy’s compositions and arrangements have been performed at venues including the Washington National Cathedral, Basilica of the National Shrine, and the White House, and national television broadcasts. As an ensemble singer, Amy has performed in many of the nation’s world-class and GRAMMY award-winning choral ensembles, including: The Crossing, True Concord, The Thirteen, the Choir of Trinity Wall Street, the Santa Fe Desert Chorale, the Berwick Chorus of the Oregon Bach Festival, and the Washington Bach Consort. She also is a founding member of the vocal quartet The Polyphonists. Amy currently serves as Assistant Conductor for the Victorian Lyric Opera Company, and Vocalist/Assistant Conductor of the Sea Chanters, the official chorus of the U.S. Navy. Amy holds degrees from the University of Maryland, College Park, and will graduate in 2021 with a Master’s degree in choral conducting as a student of Dr. Edward Maclary."
