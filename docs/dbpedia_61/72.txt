Abstract

Despite widespread agreement that behavior depends on both heredity and experience, the behavioral-science literature has often presented polarized opinions that either nature or nurture is dominant. During recent years, steady improvement in genetic-research methods has demonstrated the role of hereditary factors in disorders ranging from schizophrenia to maladaptive personality traits.

The authors of this book have combined an introduction to both disorders of behavior and mechanisms of heredity that should be easily understandable. A section on genetic linkage, for example, begins by explaining what alleles are and later discusses the use of human lymphocyte antigen to investigate possible autosomal link-ages . . .
