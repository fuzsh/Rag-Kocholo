        "text": "ABSTRACT\n\nFood and feed has been produced from genetically modified (GM) crops for 25 years. It is timely to review whether this technology has globally delivered the expected benefits and whether the ongoing debate on risks is justified. Expected benefits associated with GM include increased crop yields, reduced pesticide and insecticide use, reduced carbon dioxide emissions, improved soil structure, improved crop nutritive quality/value, and decreased costs of production. Concerns focus on food safety linked to toxicity and allergenicity, environmental risks associated with potential chances of gene flow, adverse effects on non-target organisms, evolution of resistance in weeds and insects, and genetic perturbations resulting in unintended compounds, new diseases, or antibiotic resistance. This review focusing on benefits and risks of GM crops concludes that they are a valuable option for delivering improved economic and environmental outcomes by providing solutions for many of the challenges facing mankind. GM technologies like many non-GM technologies can bring risks, but these can and have been monitored and quantified, allowing decisions balancing commercial, societal and environmental benefits against measurable risks. While â€˜checksâ€™ and â€˜balancesâ€™ are required, regulatory schemes must focus on balancing risks and benefits and not on â€˜checksâ€™ alone which is the case for many countries.\n\nKEYWORDS:\n\nBiotechnology\n\nenvironment\n\nfood safety\n\ngene editing\n\nGMOs\n\ntransgenic\n\nIntroduction\n\nGenetic modification resulting in altered DNA nucleotide sequences is an overarching term which covers several different methods used in manipulating the genome of organisms. Genetic modification does not refer to breeding or mutagenesis, which can also modify genetic sequences but does include transgenic manipulation, gene stacking, targeted gene editing using site-directed nucleases resulting in gene deletion, modification or gene insertion, and RNA gene silencing (Halpin Citation2005; Barrangou et al. Citation2007; Douglas and Halpin Citation2010; Kuzma and Kokotovich Citation2011; Shan et al. Citation2013; Arujanan and Aldemita Citation2015; Rinaldo and Ayliffe Citation2015; Schwach and Baulcombe Citation2016; Mall et al. Citation2018; El-Mounadi et al. Citation2020; ISAAA Citation2021a; Rahman et al. Citation2022). It can be a complex and costly process (Prado et al. Citation2014). The â€˜Biosafety Clearing Houseâ€™ managed by the Convention on Biological Diversity records 913 living modified organisms developed for resistance to diseases and pests, resistance to herbicides and antibiotics, tolerance to abiotic stresses, changes in physiology and or production, changes in quality and/or metabolite content, production of medical or pharmaceutical compounds, use in industrial applications, and engineered gene drive application (Convention on Biological Diversity Citation2022). A significant driver for the implementation of GM technologies is the â€˜genetic glass ceilingâ€™ within species, where the genes available for traits are not available within the species, that classical breeding cannot overcome (Gressel Citation2010).\n\nGenetically modified (GM) food and feed crops have been acknowledged as a technology that has been adopted at a faster rate than any other recent crop technology (James Citation2010; Adenle Citation2011; Khush Citation2012; Flavell Citation2015; James Citation2015; Kamle et al. Citation2017; Raman Citation2017; ISAAA Citation2018a; Nwosu and Ubaoji Citation2020; Prabha et al. Citation2020; Scheitrum et al. Citation2020). There have been 525 different transgenic events undertaken in 32 crops and flower species that have been approved for cultivation in different parts of the world (Kumar et al. Citation2020; Verma et al. Citation2021) now used on 192 million ha in 2018 (ISAAA Citation2018a). Between 1992 and 2018 regulatory agencies across 43 countries, including New Zealand, (with the European Union counted as one country) have approved 2063 GM foods and 1461 GM feeds by considering them to be as safe as non-GM crops (ISAAA Citation2018b). This is underpinned by 824 approvals allowing the cultivation of GM crops (not including approvals for ornamental crops such as carnation, rose, and petunia) for eight types of GM traits () (ISAAA Citation2022). However, the predominant commercialised GM crops are those providing glyphosate tolerance to improve weed control (Green and Owen Citation2011; ISAAA Citation2017) and those incorporating genes expressing insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) (Betz et al. Citation2000; Shelton et al. Citation2002; Duke and Powles Citation2009; Barrows et al. Citation2014a) (). For fruit and vegetables, post-harvest management to improve shelf life and quality is equally important and could be achieved using genome editing tools (Kumari et al. Citation2022).\n\nCurrently, GM crops are grown in 26 (ISAAA Citation2018a) countries with the top 5 ranked by area grown being â€“ USA, Brazil, Argentina (MÃ¼hl Citation2020), India, and Canada (Kamle et al. Citation2017). In 2018, 21 developing countries grew 54% of the global GM crops by area (ISAAA Citation2018a). In 2018, a total of 70 countries (26 allowing planting and 44 not allowing planting of GM crops) adopted 30 GM crops for food, feed, and cultivation (ISAAA Citation2018b). The range of plant species grown as commercial GM crops is diverse including row crops, vegetables, and fruit trees (Parisi et al. Citation2016) but the predominant crops are maize (Zea mays), soybean (Glycine max), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), and canola (Brassica napus) (James Citation2016; ISAAA Citation2018a), many of which have multiple stacked traits (Parisi et al. Citation2016; Shehryar et al. Citation2020). It is interesting that wheat (Triticum aestivum), a major food and feed crop has only one commercialised GM cultivar () despite the claims nearly 20 years ago that gene transformation will be an important tool for developing cultivars for abiotic and biotic stress tolerance and the value-added characteristics to improve human health (Bhalla Citation2006). This was the result of economic concerns from wheat growers and the processing industry using the same argument that delayed using GM potatoes, sugar beet and rice (Kalaitzandonakes et al. Citation2016).\n\nDespite this unprecedented uptake there is still the ongoing debate on the balance of benefits and risks associated with this technology (Beringer Citation2000; Griffin Citation2000; Bakshi Citation2003; Conner et al. Citation2003; Hunt Citation2004; Cerdeira and Duke Citation2006; Parrot Citation2010; Buiatti et al. Citation2013; Kramkowska et al. Citation2013; Goldstein Citation2014; Zhang et al. Citation2016; Smyth Citation2017a; Kumar et al. Citation2020; Kavi Kishor et al. Citation2021). Political interference has also significantly impacted regulatory approval processes of GM crops adversely affecting the adoption of innovative, yield enhancing crop varieties, thereby limiting food security opportunities in food insecure economies (Davison Citation2010; Phillipson and Smyth Citation2016; Raybould Citation2021; Smyth et al. Citation2021). Herring (Citation2010) has considered that unlike some global contentions the rift over GM crops is not about ultimate values but rather about bio-safety and bio-property. In the case of bio-property, associated with patents, monopoly corporate control and terminator technology, claims have proved either false or inconsistent with dynamics on the ground.\n\nOne of the commonly stated justifications for pursuing GM crops has been the need to feed a growing world population (Huang, Pray, et al.

Citation2021; Guleria and Kumar Citation2021; Sood et al. Citation2021; Verma et al. Citation2021; ISAAA Citation2021a, Citation2021b). While this is certainly a potential outcome and for many scientists is a significant driver, there are other underlying reasons for companies and research groups pursuing the use of GM crops which include commercial returns and scientific recognition, neither of which are necessarily wrong but must be recognised as material.\n\nBenefits associated with the use of GM have included increased crop yields which should lead to a reduced need for new land for production, reduced pesticide and insecticide use, reduced carbon dioxide emissions, improved soil structure, a decreased cost of crop production, and health benefits through provision of improved micronutrient supply (Barrows et al. Citation2014b; Kumar et al. Citation2020; Wu et al. Citation2021), many of which are associated with adapting to or mitigating predicted outcomes from climate change (Karavolias et al. Citation2021). Indeed, GM is another tool that can deliver benefit primarily with regard to improved environmental integrity and increased productivity (yield per ha), through reducing the use of synthetic chemicals (which no doubt cause environmental harm and possibly health concerns (Devine and Furlong Citation2007; Boedeker et al. Citation2020; Fu et al. Citation2022; Rasool et al. Citation2022; Sim et al. Citation2022)) and reducing the need for more land to be taken out of natural ecosystems for production agriculture. Boedeker et al. (Citation2020) have estimated that globally there are annually about 385 million cases of unintentional, acute poisoning due to synthetic pesticide use annually including about 11,000 fatalities, with worst affected areas being southern Asia, followed by south-eastern Asia and east Africa. However, the world continues to use pesticides. Can genetic modification technologies provide a safer and more environmentally benign option?\n\nConcerns about the use of GM technologies (Kendall et al. Citation1997) have included:\n\nfood safety linked to potential toxicity and allergenicity,\n\nenvironmental risks associated with potential chances of gene flow, adverse effects on non-target organisms, and evolution of resistance in weeds and insects, and\n\ngenetic perturbations leading to the production of unintended compounds, new disease, or antibiotic resistance.\n\nHowever, The Royal Society London and National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) concluded after two decades of GM crop use that â€˜there is no evidence that producing a new crop variety using GM techniques is more likely to have unforeseen effects than producing one using conventional cross breedingâ€™ (NASEM Citation2016; The Royal Society Citation2016). Yet unintended consequences of any new crop cultivar (GM or non-GM) needs risk assessment, which is regulated for GM crops in most jurisdictions (Key et al. Citation2008; DeFrancesco Citation2013; Kumar et al. Citation2022), and strongly regulated in New Zealand (Caradus Citation2022) but is not regulated for non-GM crops.\n\nNot all GM crop developments will be successful, and many will end up being â€˜shelvedâ€™ for a variety of reasons. For example, the use of a transgene trypsin proteinase inhibitor to enhance pest resistance did not show increased mortality, but rather a net gain in weight and a faster development compared with control larvae (De Leo et al. Citation1998). However, failed developments also occur when using non-GM options when attempting to improve crop adaptation and yield (Mehta et al. Citation2019). Similarly, poor product stewardship can result in otherwise successful GM crop developments failing, for example as has happened with Starlink maize and a herbicide-tolerant wheat (Mbabazi et al. Citation2021).\n\nThis systematic review will focus on plants (but not animals or microbes) and will use peer-reviewed sources to determine if intended consequences of GM technologies are being delivered and whether unintended consequences are real and if so, are they manageable? This will cover assessments made to determine the risks and opportunities of using GM crops (e.g. refer Figure 2 of Carzoli et al. Citation2018). The purported or expected benefits of commercialised crops with GM traits will be reviewed followed by an assessment of unintended consequences, what they mean and how they might be managed. The influence of corporations and governments on the uptake and attitudes towards GM crops will also be briefly reviewed. The review will not include either unregulated techniques used to manipulate the genome or issues associated with globalisation, regulatory frameworks and intellectual property associated with GM crops, consumer attitudes or cultural (Young and Cormick Citation2004), ethical and religious concerns, or use in medical or industrial molecular farming (Daniell et al. Citation2001). However, it is acknowledged that the debate on the use of GM technologies is simply not one based on science pros and cons but has significant social, economic, and cultural overlays (Cayford Citation2004). However, these are largely beyond the scope of this review.\n\nThere are 7 sections to this review: (1) a brief commentary on the influence of corporations and governments; (2) expected benefits from GM crop; (3) GM product quality and safety testing for consumption by either animals or humans; (4) unintended consequences of traits in GM crops â€“ fact or myth; (5) coexistence of GM and non-GM crops â€“ is it possible or does it create more issues; (6) future opportunities for GM crops; and (7) a concluding commentary.\n\nInfluence of corporations and governments\n\nGM crops have been promoted and championed by some key agricultural corporations (Macnaghten Citation2015; Thuy Citation2018; Prabha et al. Citation2020). It has been argued that because of some large agricultural companies, transgenic seeds are too expensive for poorer farmers (ETC Group Citation2013). It has been propositioned that the inclusion of genetically modified maize in food aid shipments to Southern Africa during the 2002 food crisis was done to promote the adoption of biotech crops in the continent, expanding access and control of multinational companies and as a result undermining local smallholder production thereby fostering greater food insecurity (Zerbe Citation2004). On the other hand, in other countries, such as China, there has been a move by government researchers to promote the use of GM plants (Cao and Li Citation2013), particularly Bt GM cotton, amongst small holder farmers (Huang, Hu, et al. Citation2002; Hong et al. Citation2013). However, confidence in how a government is seen to be handling the management of GM crops will impact on support for the commercialisation of these technologies (Yu et al. Citation2020).\n\nAdditionally, both government bureaucratic regulatory systems, attitudes of corporations and influence of antagonist organisations can slow or prevent the delivery of public good GM technologies. This has occurred in New Zealand (Caradus Citation2022) and Europe where most of the European Union farmers are unable to grow GM crops (Zilberman et al. Citation2013; Lucht Citation2015). Another excellent example of the influence of government and political economy is the deployment struggles associated with the release of Golden Rice (Oryza sativa) (Ye et al. Citation2000; Beyer Citation2010; Potrykus Citation2010; Wesseler and Zilberman Citation2014; Wu et al. Citation2021), which is genetically modified to elevate expression of pro-vitamin A, a deficiency which can cause blindness and reduced life expectancy (Sommer and West Citation1996). Early criticism came from organisations against GM crops by indicating that the levels of vitamin A produced in the early transformations were inadequate to make a real difference (Ensering Citation2008). However, this has been corrected with Golden Rice now documented to contain up to 35 Î¼g Î²-carotene per gram, which can then be effectively converted to vitamin A in humans (Tang et al. Citation2009). Golden Rice is now used commercially in Philippines (Sumangil Citation2022) but should have a much wider use in populations suffering from vitamin A deficiency (Anderson et al. Citation2005; Stein et al. Citation2006). An interesting thought piece is provided by Stone and Glover (Citation2017) on the prospects for Golden Rice in the Philippines prior to its commercial release through an analysis of three distinctive â€˜rice worldsâ€™. Green Revolution rice developed at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) 60 years ago, Golden Rice being bred at IRRI in the early 2000s, and a scheme to promote and export traditional â€˜heirloomâ€™ landrace rice from the Philippines.\n\nAlternatively, political support within a country for the use of GM crops can result in laws and regulations being passed that provide a food regime based on biotechnology as occurred in Brazil late in the first decade of 2000, despite vehement opposition (Motta Citation2016). The motivations and drivers for governmental decision of this kind often trace back to agrarian elites, multinational seed and chemical corporations, and national research institutes (Murrell Citation2011). The varied uptake of GM technologies across Africa was largely driven by strong governmental support for GM technology (Schroeder Citation2022) or a lack of political support and â€˜willâ€™ to embrace it (Okeno et al. Citation2013).\n\nDespite the calculated increased profit from Bt GM cotton of US$150/ha compared to US$70/ha for non-GM cotton (Vitale et al. Citation2014), Burkina Faso announced an abrupt phase-out of Bt cotton, citing millions of dollars of losses due to inferior lint quality (Luna and Dowd-Uribe Citation2020). They concluded that it was not the GM process that was used to develop this technology that was at fault here, but rather the political economic context that favoured the production of positive results, the narrow epistemologies of agronomic evaluation, and the knowledge produced via these processes was used to accrue material benefits to the IP owner and helped to promote GM crops across the continent. They stress that future GM crop evaluations should be more self-reflexive, critical, and transparent in how power shapes the evaluation process and agricultural outcomes for farmers. Indeed some governments in Africa have taken advice to adopt the European regulatory approached and driven GM food and crops from their economies, this despite the fact that in Africa two-thirds of farmers are poor and in desperate need of new technologies to boost crop productivity (Paarlberg Citation2009).\n\nConcern for farmers being held hostage to the â€˜agro-industrial machineâ€™ and therefore the use of GM technologies (Tirado and Johnston Citation2010) which while unacceptable is not a fair basis for condemning GM technologies per se. Other issues affecting equitable uptake of GM technologies include government credit provisioning schemes because of high seed prices (Dowd-Uribe Citation2014); suspicion of direct or indirect financial support for science teams promoting GM crop technologies (Kangmennaang et al. Citation2016); the argument that GM technologies are needed to secure future food production is simply a reflection of corporate interests (Jacobsen et al. Citation2013); and concern about corporate ownership of seed and threats to the purity of indigenous crops (Altieri Citation2003; Schmidt Citation2005). The domination of large multinationals in the development of GM crops while concerning should not be specifically argued as the reason for condemning GM technologies and the benefits they can provide. The focus should rather be on condemning poor business practices and a lack of humanitarian concern. It cannot necessarily be assumed that improved productivity will result in improved food security (Fukuda-Parr and Orr Citation2012) unless there are better (fairer) means for food distribution. Geopolitical and corporate power plays should not be a reason for condemning the technology when there are significant advantages on offer. Indeed, a European Parliament study using commonly applied metrices for measuring power has revealed that there is no monopolistic pricing power present (Wesseler et al. Citation2015).\n\nGenetically modified crops â€“ expected benefits from traits\n\nWhile the first GM crop (GM tobacco for virus resistance) was commercialised in China in 1990 (Raman Citation2017) followed by the Flavr Savr tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) (Kramer and Redenbaugh Citation1994; Bruening and Lyons Citation2000; Martineau Citation2001), early traits commercialised were dominated by input traits such as glyphosate herbicide tolerance and Bt pest resistance (Huang et al. Citation2005; Qaim Citation2015). These and additional traits now available in GM crops along with their expected benefits are listed in .\n\nIn 2014, a meta-analysis indicated there were significant benefits of GM crops on yield, pesticide use and cost, production costs and farmer profit () (KlÃ¼mper and Qaim Citation2014). The number of different primary datasets used for this analysis ranged from 7 (for pesticide use associated with herbicide-tolerant crops) to 100 for yield across all GM crops. The analysis showed no significant difference in farmer profit (+64%) with the use of herbicide-tolerant crops. However, the primary reason for this was that there were only 9 primary datasets, which were quite variable, used. Likewise, studies comparing conventional systems with those focused on soil and water conservation and/or organic farming have shown mixed results in terms of economic productivity, due to uncertainty of higher price premium and government support to offset lower yields and higher overall economic costs (OECD Citation2016).\n\nEconomic gains\n\nThe economic benefits globally from GM crops between 1996 and 2016 have been estimated to be close to US$200 billion, benefiting up to 17 million farmers of which 95% are from developing countries (ISAAA Citation2018b). In 2018 the on-farm income benefit from the use of GM crops was estimated to be close to US$19 billion, equivalent to adding over 5.8% to the global value of the crops soybean, maize, canola, and cotton (Brookes and Barfoot Citation2020a). For the 22-year period to 2018, the net economic benefit at the farm level has been close to US$225 billion with these gains almost equally divided between farmers in developed and developing countries (Brookes and Barfoot Citation2020b). In the following 2 years, through to 2020, a further US$36.3 billion has been added to this economic benefit with 72% of the gains derived from yield and production gains and the remaining 28% coming from cost savings (Brookes Citation2022). A further independent estimate has determined that at the current farm-level GM adoption rates, the increased production achievable could generate an additional $65 billion, the majority of which would accrue to the developing world (Scheitrum et al. Citation2020). Interestingly, early on in commercial development the likely economic benefit of glyphosate-tolerant soybean in USA was examined with the view that the price premium was being set too high compared to the potential cost/risk savings on many farms, and as a result â€˜Roundup Ready soybean will not be fully adopted soonâ€™ (Bullock and Nitsi Citation2001). How wrong that prediction has proven, with glyphosate-tolerant GM soybean being the most cultivated transgenic plant in the world in 2006, and in the USA, making up 91% of soybean crop in 2007 (Bonny Citation2008), with an estimated cumulative global benefit over 15 years to 2010 of US$46 billion (Alston et al. Citation2014). The uptake of this technology was due to convenience and ease of use (Marra et al. Citation2004), a major driver for the successful uptake of other technologies such a glyphosate in Africa (Haggblade et al. Citation2017) and EpichloÃ« endophytes in New Zealand (Caradus et al. Citation2013)\n\nOf the 98 results from peer-reviewed literature that compare the economic performance of GM crops to their conventional counterparts, 71 indicate a positive impact, 11 neutral and 16 negative (Carpenter Citation2010). For GM herbicide-tolerant crops, 12 of 17 results show a positive impact on economic performance, whereas 4 results show no difference and 1 result shows a negative impact. For GM insect-resistant crops, 59 of 80 results indicate improved economic performance, 7 results are neutral, and 14 results are negative. In Western Canada farmers growing herbicide-tolerant GM canola generated between CAD$1.063 billion and CAD$1.192 billion annual net direct and indirect benefits from 2005 to 2007, partly attributed to lower input costs and partly attributed to better weed control (Gusta et al. Citation2011). In Western Australia, the economic value of using glyphosate-tolerant GM canola in the management of herbicide-tolerant annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum) and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) was considerably higher than the commonly grown triazine-tolerant canola (Monjardino et al. Citation2005) which also caused a yield and oil content penalty compared with cultivars not tolerant to triazine (Robertson et al. Citation2002). In Australia, the economic opportunity cost from 2004 to 2014 resulting from a moratorium on GM crop use resulted in a net economic loss to canola farmersâ€™ of AU$485.6 million (1.1. million tonnes) (Biden et al. Citation2018). While the initial uptake of herbicide-tolerant GM canola was lower than expected in Australia due largely to economic value derived from the GM canola technology package (Hudson and Richards Citation2014), it is now more widely used reaching half million ha in 2018 (Brookes and Barfoot Citation2020b) out of a total of about two million ha (ABARES Citation2018). For the Czech Republic and Hungary, an estimated economic analysis showed that the use of herbicide-tolerant GM sugar beet would provide the farmer additional return of â‚¬252â€“262/ha of which two-thirds accrue to farmers and one-third to the seed industry (seed company and technology provider) (Demont and Dillen Citation2008). Similar outcomes have been reported for GM sugar beets (Demont et al. Citation2004) and GM maize (Wesseler et al. Citation2007). The concerns about GM maize imports into Mexico (HernÃ¡ndez-LÃ³pez Citation2022) and the recent announcement that Mexico is to ban GM maize will have a significant economic impact both in Mexico and the USA. It is forecast that over the next 10 years this Mexican ban will cause the USA economy to lose US$73.89 billion in economic output, and for Mexico a reduction of US$19.39 billion (World Perspectives Inc Citation2022).\n\nThe economics of delaying the introduction of GM crops due to concerns about their unintended effects (i.e. unexpected environmental side effects) has shown that globally restriction of the adoption of GM in corn, rice, and wheat can only be justified if the net present value of the damage caused is above US$300 billion to US$1.22 trillion (which is the estimated value of the benefit using these technologies), suggesting that a precautionary approach can be very costly (Zilberman et al. Citation2015). In the USA, a 162 page report on the use of GM and non-GM feed concluded that demand for use of non-GM feed only for livestock and poultry would most likely increase greenhouse gas emissions on farms, and raise consumer prices for meat, milk, and eggs (Bowers Citation2022). However, early in their use the positive influence of some GM crops on economic competitiveness in some parts of the USA has been questioned (McBride and El-Osta Citation2002; Jolly et al. Citation2005). Additionally, the uptake and use of GM soybean in Argentina while cited regularly as an economic success through providing increased production and profits (Trigo and Cap Citation2003; Qaim Citation2005; Qaim and Traxler Citation2005; Chudnovsky Citation2006) has also been criticised for creating profound changes in social and ecological dynamics affecting equality, displacement, health hazards, deforestation, and creation of glyphosate-resistant weeds suggesting that the model was unsustainable (Altieri and Pengue Citation2006; LeguizamÃ³n Citation2014; PhÃ©linas and Choumert Citation2017). However, nearly a decade later Argentina remains a major producer of glyphosate-tolerant GM soybean involving 17 million ha in 2018 (Brookes and Barfoot Citation2020b), much of which is exported to China (Giraudo Citation2020).\n\nThe cost to farmers, particularly small-holder farms in developing countries, of using GM crop technologies is often used as a criticism (Raney Citation2006; Moscona and Sastry Citation2022). In fact a review showed that the economic evidence does not support the widely held perception that transgenic crops benefit only large farms in developed countries (Lee et al. Citation2014) but on the contrary, the technology may also be a benefit to poorer small farms (Huang, Rozelle, et al. Citation2002; Ruttan Citation2004; Bennett et al. Citation2004a; Huang et al. Citation2005). Comparing the benefit to farmers in developing countries with those from developed countries indicates a 20% and 36% cost of use relative to the total returns from the technology, respectively (Brookes and Barfoot Citation2017). This difference is partly due to both weaker intellectual property rights enforcement in developing countries (Krattiger Citation2010) and the higher average level of farm income gain on a per hectare basis derived by developing country farmers relative to developed country farmers. In a study undertaken in Uganda where there are farmer estimated yield losses in maize to drought and stem borer of 36% and 15%, respectively it was found that using GM maize with increased drought tolerance and/or Bt insect resistance provided a value/cost ratio of 1.5 and 2.1, respectively (Wamatsembe et al. Citation2017). The only situation where a negative return occurred was for farmers with non-stressed grain that was yielding below 2 tÂ·haâˆ’1. This is supported by an earlier review which only used peer-reviewed literature with a stated method applied to empirical data to show that the use of GM crops by developing economies is more than not likely to be economically beneficial (Smale et al. Citation2009); and from economic analyses of impact studies (Qaim Citation2009). Indeed, in Africa urban rich consumers rejected GM-banana while poor urban and poor rural consumers and producers showed a positive willingness to purchase (Kikulwe et al. Citation2011) confirming the hypotheses of Paarlberg (Citation2009) and Thomson (Citation2013) that the better educated wealthy urban consumers orient themselves more towards the views expressed by wealthy EU consumers than by poor African consumers.\n\nImproved productivity and crop yield performance\n\nThere is a need to consider how more can be produced from current arable and grazed pasture-land without further destruction of forests and wetlands (Ewers et al. Citation2009; Ray et al. Citation2012; Barrows et al. Citation2014b; Phalan et al. Citation2016; Folberth et al. Citation2020). It has been estimated that crop production globally has increased by a cumulative 658 million tons over non-GM equivalents over the 20 years from 1996 to 2016 and in so doing has reduced the area requiring to be cropped by 183 million ha (ISAAA Citation2018b).\n\nYields of GM crops of soybean, maize, canola, and cotton have increased globally since 1996 compared with equivalent non-GM crops (Brookes and Barfoot Citation2017). Using aggregate data from across-country time series GM crops were estimated to have increased yields by 34% for cotton, 12% for maize and 3% for soybeans (Barrows et al. Citation2014b). While GM herbicide-tolerant crops have provided easier weed control, GM insect-resistant crops have improved yield in maize and cotton in most countries, except for GM Bt cotton in Australia where the levels of Heliothis sp (boll and bud worm pests) control previously obtained with intensive insecticide use were very good. However, the benefit in Australia has been cost saving and improved environmental impacts due to reduced pesticide use (Brookes and Barfoot Citation2017).\n\nA meta-analysis of 32 publications (n = 276) has shown that GM maize cultivation led to a significant increase in yield of about 10% as an average, corresponding to 0.7 t/ha, compared to the non-GM isolines or near isolines (Pellegrino et al. Citation2018). This confirmed an earlier analysis which has shown increases of 0.6 t/ha (Areal et al. Citation2013), 0.7 t/ha in Spain, 1.1 t/ha in Germany and 1.8 t/ha in South Africa (Finger et al. Citation2011) for GM over non-GM maize. The biggest yield gain in the Pellegrino et al. (Citation2018) meta-analysis was for quadruple staked hybrids with a 24.5% increase. These yield differences were in part related to the improved percentage change of damaged ears of 73%, 31%, and 84%, for double, triple and quadruple stacked hybrids, respectively. However, where the effect of European maize borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) is not severe maize producers may not benefit from the use of these Bt hybrids (Ma and Subedi Citation2005). Similarly, a comparison of glyphosate-tolerant soybean cultivars with non-glyphosate-tolerant cultivars indicated a 5â€“10% yield depression indicating that cultivar choice should be based on balancing the expected weed pressure, relative to the cost of using herbicides and seed of glyphosate-tolerant cultivars (Elmore Citation2001; Elmore et al. Citation2001). However, much of this yield depression occurred in the early development of Roundup Ready cultivars awaiting plant breeding input to ensure these gene constructs were introgressed into elite modern cultivars. In the Central Corn Belt of the USA GM maize cultivars have realised increased yields, but for soybean GM cultivars have slightly reduced yields (Xu et al. Citation2013). In that study, Xu et al. (Citation2013) predicted that the combined effects of these yield trends and GM adoption are predicted to fall short of the growth rate envisioned by industry projections. However, 10 years later there is no published evidence of reduced use of GM crops in these Central Corn Belt states. Additionally, there are studies across a range of environments clearly demonstrating that Roundup Ready 2 YieldÂ® soybean (MON 89788) has no adverse effects compared to a conventional control soybean variety, A3244 (Horak et al. Citation2015). It largely accepted that modern herbicide-tolerant GM crop cultivars are similar to their non-GM counterparts for yield.\n\nBenefits from GM crops, especially in terms of increased yields, are greatest for the mostly small farmers in developing countries, who have benefitted from the spill over of technologies originally targeted at farmers in industrialised countries (Huang, Rozelle, et al. Citation2002; Bennett et al. Citation2006; Carpenter Citation2010). The average yield increases for developing countries range from 16% for insect-resistant maize to 30% for insect-resistant cotton, with an 85% yield increase observed in a single study on herbicide-tolerant corn.\n\nCrop management\n\nThe use of herbicide-tolerant GM crops has been to the primary benefit of farmers providing an option for improved ease of management (Marra et al. Citation2004; Bonny Citation2011; Green and Owen Citation2011). It has been argued that with 95% of the USA soybean market dominated by GM cultivars this reflects the ease of use to the US farmer. For example, growing herbicide-tolerant GM soybean uses a no-till management system leading to reduced energy use and a significant reduction in the use of active chemical ingredients on the soybean crop (down by 27,000 tonnes per year) (Livermore and Turner Citation2009). In the USA Corn Belt it has been documented that GM technology has a stronger impact on the lower yielding maize crops/areas by reducing exposure to potentially negative outcomes (Chavas et al. Citation2014). Additionally, and somewhat surprisingly it was found that while the negative â€˜maize after maizeâ€™ effect still exists for the conventional hybrids, it is reduced to negligible levels for the GM technology in the lower end of the yield distribution. The increase in herbicide-resistant weeds has led to a call for alternative strategies that should not rely solely on different herbicide mechanisms of action, although acknowledging the substantial environmental benefits of herbicide-tolerant GM crops (Reddy and Nandula Citation2012).\n\nCrop product composition and quality\n\nFor many years after the first commercial GM crops were grown and harvested the compositional equivalency between GM crops and non-GM comparators has been a fundamental component of human health safety assessment. Several reviews have been undertaken of studies targeted towards determining the impacts of GM technologies on crop composition and quality. A substantial literature review in 2013 concluded that unintended compositional effects that could be caused by genetic modification have not materialised (Herman and Price Citation2013). A meta-analysis of 32 publications, over 21 years of field trials, has shown that GM maize cultivation led to a significant increase in yield but no difference in concentration of proteins, lipids, acid detergent fibre, neutral detergent fibre and total dietary fibre in grain compared with isolines or near isolines (Pellegrino et al. Citation2018). Similarly, a total of 241 statistical comparisons between the multi-trait GM maize crops and their corresponding non-GM controls demonstrated compositional equivalence for both forage and grain (Ridley et al. Citation2011). And yet another review has questioned these equivalency conclusions for analytes between GM and non-GM cultivars (Herman et al. Citation2019, Citation2020), and others have proposed new tests with improved statistical power (van der Voet and Paoletti Citation2019; Engel and van der Voet Citation2021). They however do concede that in a practical case study, results were broadly similar, and the improvements were mainly relevant for analytes with hardly any variation between the reference genotypes.\n\nIn maize, comparison of seven GM stacks containing event DAS-Ã˜15Ã˜7-1 (which expresses Cry1F insecticidal protein and the phosphinothricin N-acetyltransferase (PAT) herbicide-tolerant enzyme) and their matched non-GM near isogenic hybrids showed non-GM breeding more strongly influenced crop composition than did transgenesis or stacking of GM events (Herman et al. Citation2017). Similarly, maize hybrids with stacked herbicide tolerance and insect resistance (MON 87427 Ã— MON 89034 Ã— NK603) showed compositional equivalence to a near-isogenic non-GM comparator (Venkatesh et al. Citation2014). The same has been shown not just for maize but also for soybean indicating compositional equivalence for the stacked trait products, reflecting the conclusions obtained for the single trait products (Bell et al. Citation2018). For soybean both glyphosate and dicamba resistant GM cultivars have been shown to be compositionally equivalent to non-GM soybean (Berman et al. Citation2011; Taylor et al. Citation2017). While lignin concentration in leaves and stems did not differ between GM hybrids and their isolines, biomass loss from crop residues was significantly increased in GM hybrids. Conversely, transgene stacking in GM maize has shown 22 proteins mostly associated with energy/carbohydrate metabolism that were statistically differentially modulated (Agapito-Tenfen et al. Citation2014). The biological relevance and implications of such changes was not described.\n\nOne significant unintended benefit of Bt GM maize (single stacked Cry1Ab hybrids) is the lower concentrations of grain mycotoxins such as fumonisins and thricotecens compared with non-GM maize (Ostry et al. Citation2010). This has been valued as worth about US$23 million annually in the USA (Wu Citation2006).\n\nAgronomic and phenotypic plant traits\n\nA replicated field trial, undertaken by Bayer Crop Science in Brazil, comparing single or stacked GM materials and the respective non-GM counterparts used as controls at six sites, has shown that combining GM events through conventional breeding does not alter agronomic or phenotypic plant characteristics of soybean (7 events), maize (6 events) and cotton (6 events) crops with stacked genes compared to non-GM equivalents (Jose et al. Citation2020). Similarly, field trials by Dow AgroSciences also showed no agronomic differences between maize hybrids developed through stacking of 4 individual transgenic events containing the cry1A.105 and cry2Ab2 (MON 89034), cry1F and pat (TC1507), cp4 epsps (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) and aad-1 transgenes and non-GM near-isogenic hybrids (de Cerqueira et al. Citation2017). This would indicate that risk assessment of the individual events is sufficient to demonstrate the safety of the stacked products (Clawson et al. Citation2019). However, it should be acknowledged that it depends on what is changed in the plant by the GM event. However, even when agronomic differences have been documented between GM maize hybrids and their non-GM equivalents it has been concluded that none of the phenotypic differences were expected to contribute to a biological or ecological change that would result in an increased pest potential or ecological risk when cultivating these GM hybrids (Heredia DÄ±az et al. Citation2017).\n\nImproved resistance to pests\n\nPlant genetic resistance to major and minor pests of most crops has been a key goal for plant breeders. However, there are limits within genomes to how successful that strategy can continue to be with changing pest populations and increased agricultural intensification (driven by economic and environmental (slowing the encroachment into natural ecosystems) needs). The advent in 1996 of Bt GM plants expressing pesticidal proteins has provided an opportunity to enhance plant resistance as part of integrated pest management strategies (Kennedy Citation2008; Kos et al. Citation2009 Frisvold and Reeves Citation2010; Hillocks Citation2014; Machado et al. Citation2020). A principal advantage of Bt insecticides is that they are generally not harmful to humans, non-target wildlife, or beneficial arthropods (Ortman et al. Citation2001; KadoiÄ‡ BalaÅ¡ko et al. Citation2020). Seeking a wider pool of insect control proteins, other than Bt proteins, has been promoted as likely to improve durability, spectrum of activity, reliability, environmental impact and public acceptability of GM crops (Hilder Citation2003). But to date this does not seem to have occurred ().\n\nEnvironmental benefits\n\nThe application of well-managed GM crops has led to improved environmental sustainability (Sharma et al. Citation2022) due to a reduction in the use of synthetic chemicals, less soil disturbance, and with higher productivity a reduced need for more land to be claimed for agricultural production. Others have concluded that there is no ecological risk in growing GM crops (Raven Citation2010). Using controlled environments to assess benefits and risks can be misleading and the use of a more holistic approach where assessment is made on the performance of GM plants in the relevant field environment (Liu and Stewart Citation2019).\n\nReduced use of synthetic chemicals\n\nWhile synthetic pesticides have been required to ensure economic crops yields (Pimentel Citation2005), they have also resulted in ecological consequences of concern potentially affecting non-target species, reducing, and possibly contaminating food sources of other organisms (Devine and Furlong Citation2007), and waterways (Rosic et al. Citation2020; Rasool et al. Citation2022). Additionally, it has been observed that Integrated Pest Management concepts have not necessarily reduced overall pesticide use (Devine and Furlong Citation2007; Mabubu et al. Citation2016). However, there is consistent evidence of reduced pesticide use associated with the growing Bt GM crops (Huang, Hu, et al. Citation2002; Huang et al. Citation2003; Bennett et al. Citation2004a; Huang et al. Citation2005; Qaim and De Janvry Citation2005; Bennett et al. Citation2006; Cattaneo et al. Citation2006; Carpenter Citation2010; Huang et al. Citation2010; Lu et al. Citation2012; Gruissem Citation2015; Nalluri and Karri Citation2020), including when genes for herbicide tolerance and pest resistance are stacked (Wossink and Denaux Citation2006). A meta-analysis by KlÃ¼mper and Qaim (Citation2014) demonstrated that on average, GM crop adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37%, increased crop yields by 22%, and increased farmer profits by 68%. Yield gains and pesticide reductions are larger for insect-resistant crops than for herbicide-tolerant crops. Yield and profit gains are higher in developing countries than in developed countries.\n\nEnvironmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) used to assess the broader impact on the environment (plus impact on animal and human health) distils the various environmental and health impacts of individual pesticides in different GM and conventional production systems into a single â€˜field value per hectareâ€™ and draws on key toxicity and environmental exposure data related to individual products (Kovach et al. Citation1992). Negative environmental impacts have been significantly reduced through using herbicide tolerant and pest resistant GM crops achieving on average across 7 GM crops a 23% reduction in environmental impact, in part resulting from 620 million kgs of active ingredient not being applied (Brookes and Barfoot Citation2017) (). Even with the slightly increased use of herbicides on GM herbicide-tolerant soybeans the EIQ reduction was still significant due to the switch to more environmentally benign herbicides. The use of pesticide resistance GM crops has been estimated to have saved 671 million kg. active ingredient (a.i.) of pesticides globally between 1996 and 2016, an 8.2% reduction in pesticide use (ISAAA Citation2018b). Comparing canola production in Western Canada from 1995 and 2006, the environmental impact of herbicides applied to canola was estimated to have decreased by 53%, producer exposure to chemicals by 56%, and quantity of active ingredient applied by 1.3 million kg. due to the widespread use of GM herbicide-resistant canola (Smyth et al. Citation2011).\n\nA review 10 years after GM crops were imported and used in Western and Central Europe (i.e. maize, oilseed rape, and soybean) with the two GM traits that are herbicide tolerance and insect resistance there was no scientific evidence (from peer-reviewed scientific journals, scientific books, reports from regions with extensive GM crop cultivation, as well as reports from international governmental organisations) that the cultivation of commercialised GM crops has caused environmental harm (Sanvido et al. Citation2007).\n\nAn alternative view based on data obtained in the USA over the first 4 years of use of Bt and herbicide-tolerant GM crops is that it depends on how you measure synthetic pesticide/ herbicide use (Benbrook Citation2001). This study indicates that herbicide-tolerant GM cultivars have modestly increased herbicide use and that Bt GM cultivars perpetuate a heavy reliance on insecticide treatments. This partly agrees with the data in which indicates a small increase in use of herbicide on herbicide-tolerant GM soybean. However, rather than condemning the technology the advice from Benbrook (Citation2001) was for â€˜biotechnology to lead the way toward prevention-based biointensive pest management systems that rest largely on low-impact ways to manage natural biocontrol processes and interactionsâ€™. The emphasis here is for long-term pest management benefits from agricultural GM technologies to be through process â€“ and management-based activities, as opposed to those using a product-based system (Benbrook Citation2000).\n\nLower C footprint and reduced greenhouse gas emissions\n\nThe use of GM crops has been considered to reduce the C footprint of cropping through either reduced use of petrochemicals resulting from fewer herbicide and pesticide applications and reduced need from soil cultivation and/ or the use of no-till or reduced-till allowing carbon to remain in the soil (Brookes and Barfoot Citation2017; Aslam and Gul Citation2020; Brookes and Barfoot Citation2020c). Brookes and Barfoot (Citation2020c) estimated that over that time 34 million tons of CO2 was not released from reduced fuel use associated with growing GM crops. Using the difference between observed increased yields per hectare due to using GM crops and the counterfactual hectarage needed to generate the same output without the yield boost from GM it was determined that GM crops saved 13 million hectares of land from conversion to agriculture in 2010 alone, and averted emissions that were equivalent to roughly one-eighth of the annual emissions from automobiles in the US (Barrows et al. Citation2014b).\n\nReduced tillage\n\nReduced tillage has been considered to have a positive effect on the soil microbiome and soil structure (Frisvold et al. Citation2009; Fernandez-Cornejo et al. Citation2012), but that is not universally accepted (JanuÅ¡auskaite et al. Citation2013; SchlÃ¼ter et al. Citation2018). Despite these divergent views one benefit that has been heralded for using GM crops is the reduction in tillage used in non-GM crops for managing weed incursion (Marra et al. Citation2004), resulting in maintaining levels of sequestered soil C (Lee et al. Citation2014; Hussain et al. Citation2021) particularly in the surface layers (Deen and Kataki Citation2003; Brown et al. Citation2021). It has been estimated that about 302 million tons of CO2 was not released from soils from 1996 to 2018 (i.e. averaging 14 million tons CO2 per year) due to using GM crops but they caution that this number was reached with several assumptions being made due to lack of data (Brookes and Barfoot Citation2020c). Additionally, this is very small proportion of the CO2 released to the atmosphere each year from all sources, estimated to be 42 Ã— 106 million tons of CO2 per year (Friedlingstein et al. Citation2020).\n\nIn a review examining the changes in herbicide use in relation to GM canola production in Western Canada, comparing 1995 and 2006 it was noted that with the use of GM canola production 64% of producers are now using zero or minimum tillage as their preferred form of crop and soil management (Smyth et al. Citation2011). In Mississippi and North Carolina, USA 33% of growers shifted to more conservative tillage practices after the adoption of a glyphosate-tolerant GM crop; this was higher (45%) for those growing cotton than soybean (23%) (Givens et al. Citation2009). Others monitoring tillage practices in the USA have indicated that more than 65% of glyphosate-tolerant maize, 70% of glyphosate-tolerant cotton, and 50% of glyphosate-tolerant soybean areas received some tillage (Dill et al. Citation2008). Tillage of course is used for multiple purposes ranging from seed-bed preparation to weed management.\n\nSocietal effects in developing economies\n\nAccusations of farmer suicides associated with growing Bt cotton in India (Ho Citation2010) have proven to be incorrect (GruÃ¨re and Sengupta Citation2011). Another study has shown that using Bt cotton in fact increases returns to labour, especially for hired female workers, increases incomes, including for poor and vulnerable farmers and so concluded that Bt cotton contributes to poverty reduction and rural development (Qaim and Zilberman Citation2003; Subramanian and Qaim Citation2010). Comparison of Bt cotton grown either as official or unofficial hybrids (i.e. second generation F2 seed) showed increased yield for the official hybrids and reduced insecticide for both official and unofficial hybrids compared with non-GM equivalents (Bennett et al. Citation2005). Data collected in India between 2002 and 2008 and analysed to control non-random selection bias in technology adoption has shown that Bt GM cotton has caused a 24% increase in yield per acre through reduced pest damage and a 50% gain in cotton profit among smallholders (Kathage and Qaim Citation2012). However, other commentaries suggest that Bt technology has failed in reducing the use of insecticides in India largely due to the emergence of secondary pests (Viswanathan and Lalitha Citation2010; Kranthi and Stone Citation2020).\n\nElsewhere, in the Philippines the use of Bt maize has been shown to increase net farm income, off-farm income, and household income and reduces the probability of a household's income falling below the poverty line (Yorobe and Smale Citation2012). In China, farmers using Bt cotton reported reduced use of pesticide without reducing yield per hectare or quality of cotton harvested (Pray et al. Citation2001; Huang, Hu et al. Citation2002; Huang et al. Citation2005). Farmers also reported fewer pesticide poisonings than those using non-GM cotton. A similar outcome was found in India where the use of Bt cotton helps to avoid several million cases of pesticide poisoning which also results in sizeable health cost savings (Kouser and Qaim Citation2011). While GM crops are not going to solve all problems in developing countries, they do hold significant potential to contribute to poverty reduction, better nutrition and health, and sustainable development (Qaim Citation2010; Tonukari and Omotor Citation2010). In Africa, the advent of GM crops has been viewed as a potential benefit to subsistence farmers (Bennett et al. Citation2004a; Bennett et al. Citation2006; Muzhinji and Ntuli Citation2020; Gbashi et al. Citation2021), largely because the technology is delivered in the seed (Ehirium et al. Citation2020). However, there is an alternative opinion that these farmers should be supported to use their local natural ecosystems or agro-ecological approaches that have been successfully used to produce food in the past (Kisiangani and Pasteur Citation2008). Indeed the introduction of GM technologies is likely to be more successful if using indigenous innovation rather than simply â€˜transportingâ€™ agricultural technology from developed to developing countries (Shen Citation2010).\n\nGM product quality and safety testing for consumption by either animals or humans\n\nProviding confidence on the safety of derived food for human consumption and feed for animals is paramount for any technology to be trusted and accepted. Indeed the consumption of any modified or new foods either by animals or humans need to be effectively and thoroughly tested for their impact on health and welfare. National risk-based food control systems are essential to protect the health and safety of the public (Gizaw Citation2019). Concerns about the safety of food and feed from GM crops are often exacerbated by opinion rather than fact (Burke Citation2004) have led to debates resulting in polarised views which result in confusion and inevitably mistrust. This topic of food safety is rightly one that should be closely examined when considering the use of GM crops. Regulatory approvals require testing for safety when consumed as food (van den Belt Citation2003; EFSA GMO Panel Citation2008; Hull et al. Citation2010; Baulcombe et al. Citation2014). One would assume that no approval for use would be given if this testing determined some concerns. Yet in some studies undertaken after these crops were commercialised concerns have been raised (). So who is to be believed?\n\nIt should be noted that many non-GM crops also contain potentially toxic or allergenic compounds (Halford and Shewry Citation2000; Purchase Citation2005). These may result either from the plant itself or from fungal activity before and after harvest leading to mycotoxin production (Miller Citation2008; Chulze Citation2010). It has been argued that food from GM crops may be safer than food derived from non-GM crops, largely because the risks associated with GM crops are readily quantified and monitored as part of the rigorous assessment system that goes beyond that applied to non-GM derived foods (Halford and Shewry Citation2000).\n\nGM feed for animals\n\nMost output from GM crops is used in animal feed rather than human food. An estimated 70%â€“90% of all GM crops, principally soybean and maize, but also including cotton and canola, are used to feed animals (Flachowsky et al. Citation2012; Ritchie and Roser Citation2021) with the biggest users being USA, China, and Europe (Baulcombe et al. Citation2014). For GM soybean, the biggest producers are USA and Brazil, followed by Argentina (Qaim and Traxler Citation2005) with most soybean used in China (Hong et al. Citation2013) and Europe being imported (Lucht Citation2015; Ritchie and Roser Citation2021; Shahbandeh Citation2022). Animal feed of soybean (77% of global use) is directly from soybean grain/seed rather than as soybean cake or meal which is the by-product after processing for oil production (Ritchie and Roser Citation2021). While maize is the staple diet for many the steady increase of maize production over the years has corresponded to an increase in the use of maize for animal feed (Ranum et al. Citation2014) now making up 56% of total use globally, with food use only at 13% and processing, post-harvest losses and other uses at 30% (Erenstein et al. Citation2022).\n\nFor testing the safety of GM crops as feed for animals, tests can be undertaken with the actual animal and not laboratory animals (rats (Rattus spp.) and mice (Mus musculus)). The general conclusion is that most GM crops used for animal feed have input traits that do not change their composition or nutritional value for animals and feeding GM crops does not result in detection of transgenic DNA or their translated proteins in meat, milk, or eggs (Flachowsky and Chesson Citation2003; Van Eenennaam Citation2013; Van Eenennaam and Young Citation2014; Deb et al. Citation2016; Vicini Citation2017; de Vos and Swanenburg Citation2018; Akram et al. Citation2019; Blair and Regenstein Citation2020).\n\nThe widespread use of glyphosate-resistant crops contributed to weeds being resistant to glyphosate-based herbicides which in turn has led to increased levels of herbicide applications (Jarrell et al. Citation2020). Higher levels of herbicide use may have increased glyphosate residue concentrations in animal feed. So the issue here is the accepted toxicity of glyphosate. Some commentators believe that current safety standards for glyphosate-based herbicides are outdated and may fail to protect public health or the environment (Cuhra Citation2015; Vandenberg et al. Citation2017 Novotny Citation2022), yet others believe there is â€˜very limited evidence for an association between glyphosate-based formulations and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and an overall inconclusive for a causal or clear associative relationship between glyphosate and cancer in human studiesâ€™ (Portier et al. Citation2016). A complete review of the controversy about the safety profile of the herbicide glyphosate and its commercial formulations is beyond this current publication. However, in a 2017 review concluded that often the expressed concern about health risks associated with long-term exposure to glyphosate were not supported by the available scientific evidence (Mesnage and Antoniou Citation2017). They, however, concluded that while evidence exists that glyphosate-based herbicides are toxic below regulatory set safety limits, some arguments serve to distract rather than to give a rational direction to much needed future research investigating the toxicity of these pesticides, especially at levels of ingestion that are typical for human populations. Other reviews have concluded that epidemiological studies report contradictory data, but findings indicate that exposure to glyphosate is not completely safe (Davoren and Schiestl Citation2018; Agostini et al. Citation2020; Soares et al. Citation2021).\n\nEarly studies concluded that glyphosate-tolerant GM soybean had similar feeding value as non-GM equivalents when fed to chickens (Gallus gallus), catfish (Siluriformes spp.), and dairy cattle (Bos taurus) (Hammond et al. Citation1996). Similarly, glyphosate-tolerant maize has been shown to be equivalent in growth, feed efficiency, adjusted feed efficiency, and fat pad weights when fed to poultry compared to non-GM maize (Sidhu et al. Citation2000). A review of impacts on glyphosate in animal feed has concluded that glyphosate use in GM crops fed to poultry and livestock has neither affected animal health, rumen/gut microbes or production nor the safety of consuming meat, milk, and eggs (Vicini et al. Citation2019). However, while glyphosate has been considered animal safe a recent study reviewing controlled laboratory trials has concluded that glyphosate-based herbicides may cause adverse effects in animal reproduction, including disruption of key regulatory enzymes in androgen synthesis, alteration of serum levels of oestrogen and testosterone, damage to reproductive tissues and impairment of gametogenesis (Jarrell et al. Citation2020). They concede that there have been very few published studies investigating the effects of exposure to glyphosate-based herbicides on agriculturally important animals, and the majority of those that have, have given no concern to reproductive health and performance. However, assuming there is a potential issue here they propose that including 0.2% humic acids in the feed would neutralise the potential impact of glyphosate on reproductive fitness in livestock. A solution demonstrated effectively by Shehata et al. (Citation2014) with broiler chickens. A critical review on the behaviour, fate, and detrimental impacts on ecological and human health of glyphosate concluded that glyphosate can be judiciously used in agriculture with the inclusion of safer surfactants in commercial formulations than the surfactant, polyethoxylated tallow amine, which is toxic itself and is likely to increase the toxicity of glyphosate (Meftaul et al. Citation2020).\n\nWhile most of the focus has been on the safety of glyphosate-resistant GM crops there have been GM crops developed with resistance to other herbicide chemistries such as glufosinate (or phosphinothricin), 2,4-D, dicamba, isoxaflutole, mesotrione, oxynil and sulfonylurea (Waltz Citation2015a; Kumar et al. Citation2020). Maize grain from plants containing event DP202216, which confers herbicide tolerance through expression of phosphinothricin acetyltransferase when fed to rats for 90 days showed no biologically relevant effects or toxicologically significant differences compared with rats fed diets containing control non-GM maize grains (Carlson et al. Citation2020). Similar results have been obtained for other GM maize events expressing the phosphinothricin-N-acetyltransferase gene (MacKenzie et al. Citation2007). Canola event MON94100 with tolerance to dicamba was determined to be safe for consumption as food and feed compared with the non-GM cultivars (EFSA GMO Panel et al. Citation2022b).\n\nA review undertaken in 2013 of all available GM crop whole food studies indicated no convincing toxicological concern and called into question the adequacy, sufficiency, and reliability of safety assessments based on crop molecular characterisation, transgene source, agronomic characteristics, and/or compositional analysis of the GM crop compared with near-isogenic lines (Bartholomaeus et al. Citation2013). They concluded that because safety predictions based on crop genetics on compositional analyses were in complete agreement with well-conducted animal testing that whole food animal toxicity studies are unnecessary and scientifically unjustifiable. Similarly, pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) fed GM soybean meal (Roundup Ready MON 40-3-2) and Bt maize (MON 810) showed no effect of GM components on body weight gain, feed utilisation, and carcass and meat quality compared with non-GM feeds (ÅšwiÄ…tkiewicz et al. Citation2013).\n\nFeeding Bt pest resistant maize as silage to dairy cows showed no significant treatment effects on milk yield, milk composition, and yield of milk constituents, and the dry matter intake of the GM cultivar was not significantly different from commercial non-GM cultivars (Donkin et al. Citation2003; Phipps et al. Citation2005). A trial with Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) fed GM rice containing Cry1Ab/1Ac gene for two consecutive generations showed no significant effect on growth and development (Li et al. Citation2015). Similarly, work comparing Bt GM rice fed to chickens showed no adverse effect on aspects of immune function during 42-d feeding trial (Liu et al. Citation2016). Similarly, Bt maize (MON810) expressing Cry1Ab protein showed compositional and nutritional equivalence to its isogenic non-GM comparator in a long-term feeding study with lactating dairy cows (Steinke et al. Citation2010). Additionally, no residues of the Cry1Ab/Ac gene were found the intestine of chickens fed transgenic rice for 21 and 42 d, and the Cry1Ab/Ac gene gradually degraded after 4 h in the gut in vitro test (Xu et al. Citation2015a). Feeding of Cry1Ab protein in Bt MON810 maize to sows during gestation and lactation and their offspring from weaning to 115 days postweaning showed no detrimental effects on intergenerational pig growth and health (Buzoianu et al. Citation2013a, Citation2013b).\n\nA review undertaken after 20 years of using GM crops concluded that GM crops with input traits (involving herbicide tolerant and pest resistant genes) can be considered as substantially equivalent to their isogenic counterparts (Flachowsky Citation2017). GM crops with output traits which may influence composition and quality of food of animal origin and in the case of lower content of undesirable substances may in fact improve the feed value of GM crops and feed derived from them. This conclusion was built on the foundation of extensive trials across a range of farmed animal species (Flachowsky et al. Citation2005, Citation2007, Citation2012).\n\nLucerne transformed with the gene encoding for Betaine Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (BADH) which confers tolerance to salinity and drought stresses was compared with non-GM lucerne by supplementing 50% of the diet of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) (Zhong et al. Citation2014). No adverse effects were observed in rabbits consuming GM lucerne and non-GM lucerne with the feeding value of GM and non-GM lucerne being equal.\n\nFood safety for human consumption\n\nThe advent of GM crops has led to concerns about food safety and the need for rigorous testing (Nordic Working Group Citation1991; OECD Citation1993, Citation1998; Pusztai Citation2001, Citation2002). To manage potential risks from using GM crops there has nearly always been a framework of science-based risk assessment and risk management measures in place to oversee their commercialisation (Craig et al. Citation2008). However, mistrust of companies and corporations developing GM crops who claim they have scrutinised and evaluated new cultivars to show that they are as safe as earlier crops produced have made these claims unacceptable (McHughen Citation2000). Independent reviews of risk evaluations are required. In 2007, it was considered that there were relatively few published accounts showing that GM crops and food are toxicologically safe (Domingo Citation2007). However, a decade later it was concluded after statistical reanalysis and review of experimental data presented in some studies claiming possible GM technology-related health concerns that quite often, in contradiction with those authorsâ€™ conclusions, the data actually provides weak evidence of harm that cannot be differentiated from chance (Panchin and Tuzhikov Citation2017). They surmised that statistically unaccounted multiple comparisons have led to some of the most cited anti-GM organism health claims in history. Further to that a review of scientific literature on GM crop safety in the first 10 years from commercialisation in 1996, concluded that the scientific research conducted so far had not convincingly detected any significant hazards directly connected with the use of GM crops (Nicolia et al. Citation2014).\n\nIt was documented early in the development of GM crops that just showing that GM food is chemically similar to its non-GM counterpart is not adequate evidence that it is safe for human consumption (Millstone et al. Citation1999). Food safety testing often involves the use of feeding trials using rodents. It has been claimed that safety assessment of foods derived from GM crops has been undertaken with due care, more care than occurs from food derived from conventionally bred plants (Kok et al. Citation2008). Extensive testing prior to release ensures that food from GM crops is at least as safe as new non-GM cultivars (Lack Citation2002; Konig et al. Citation2004), which however are not required to be tested for being safe to eat.\n\nThe generally accepted conclusion is that there has been no evidence of ill effects linked to the consumption of any approved GM crop (The Royal Society Citation2016; Ladics Citation2019). Acute feeding studies involving Cry protein (used in Bt GM crops) consumption have shown no adverse effects, they are non-toxic to humans and pose no significant concern for allergenicity (Betz et al. Citation2000; Carzoli et al. Citation2018). However, there have been several trials showing some adverse effects summarised in . Equally there have been many studies showing no meaningful or significant effects of GM crops in similar types of rodent feeding trials (). Interestingly, in a review of 30 published studies between 2000 and 2010 it was also found that the numbers of studies showing no harm are now roughly equal to those showing harm when comparing GM and non-GM crops in toxicology trials (Domingo and Bordonaba Citation2011). However, they did make the point that most of the studies demonstrating that GM foods are as nutritional and safe as those obtained from non-GM crops, have been undertaken by biotechnology companies or associates. A review undertaken 20 years after the first release of GM crops also concluded that there are no case-reports of allergic reactions or immuno-toxic effects resulting from GM feed consumption as compared with non-GM feed (De Santis et al. Citation2018). Yet another review (Shen et al. Citation2022) of one crossover trial in humans and 203 animal studies from 179 articles used a subjective classification system to identify 21 adverse events involving 7 GM events all of which have had regulatory approval for use in some countries/regions.\n\nSome of the studies summarised in which indicated potential issues related to health and safety with feeding GM crops require more detailed analysis and commentary. SÃ©ralini et al. (Citation2007) concluded that â€˜longer experiments are essential in order to indicate the real nature and extent of the possible pathology; with the present data it cannot be concluded that GM maize MON863 is a safe productâ€™. However, this group in a further publication (de Vendomois et al. Citation2009) commented that â€˜these signs of toxicity alone do not constitute proof of adverse health effectsâ€™. Kilic and Akay (Citation2008) concluded that â€˜long-term consumption of transgenic Bt maize throughout three generation did not cause severe health concerns on ratsâ€™. de Vendomois et al. (Citation2009) concluded that â€˜our data presented here strongly recommend that additional long-term (up to 2 years) animal feeding studies be performed in at least three species, preferably also multi-generational, to provide true scientifically valid data on the acute and chronic toxic effects of GM crops, feed, and foodsâ€™. Finamore et al. (Citation2008) concluded that 'the significance of these data remains to be clarified to establish whether these alterations reflect significant immune dysfunctions, these results suggest the importance of considering the gut and peripheral immune response to the whole GM cropâ€™. Trabalza-Marinucci et al. (Citation2008) concluded that â€˜cytochemical modifications of the gastrointestinal organs and the immune response mechanisms that take place in GM-fed animals should deserve special emphasis and priority in future investigationsâ€™. Malatesta et al. (Citation2008) concluded that â€˜GM soybean intake can influence the liver morpho-functional features during the physiological process of ageing and, although the mechanisms responsible for such alterations are still unknown and some data have been discussed on a speculative basis, there are several findings underlining the importance to further investigate the long-term consequences of a GM-diet and the potential synergistic effects with ageing, xenobiotics and/or stress conditionsâ€™. A long-term (2-year) study on the toxicity of glyphosate GM maize was purported to show mammary, hepatic and kidney disturbances leading to tumours and mortality but was later retracted by the journal based in inconclusiveness (SÃ©ralini et al. Citation2012). Several co-authors to this work are also authors of studies showing detrimental effects of GM crops on health (6 of which are mentioned in ). This work had been heavily criticised due to several key experimental design and statistical flaws which many have concluded provided misleading results (Arjo et al. Citation2013; DeFrancesco Citation2013). In addition, a meta-analysis of 24 feeding studies has concluded that long-term studies provide little additional value over 90-day feeding trials used for safety assessment (Snell et al. Citation2012), a position also taken by others who suggest long-term feeding studies are extremely weak, with no power to distinguish between groups, and have been labelled â€˜hypothesis-less fishing tripsâ€™ (Chassy Citation2010).\n\nTwo non-peer-reviewed articles, not included in but frequently quoted, by Ermakova (Citation2006, Citation2009) of the Institute of Higher Nervous Activity and Neurophysiology of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow indicated that rats fed diets containing glyphosate-tolerant GM soybeans gave birth to pups with low survival rates or stunted growth. This work was widely used to demonstrate the potential toxicity of GM crops. Others considered this work to â€˜depart so dramatically from previously reported findings as to be remarkableâ€™ and as a result require scrutiny (Marshall Citation2007). Criticisms and concerns include:\n\nThe source of the GM soybean and no evidence of nutritional composition of test and control diet;\n\nThe use of multiple animals per cage accessing the food sources ad libitum;\n\nNumber of animals used per trial group was low at 5, whereas most credible reproductive toxicology studies use 20â€“25 animals;\n\nProtocols used for measures of animal weights did not align with other toxicology study methodsâ€™\n\nBehavioural studies do not appear to be performed in a double-blind manner;\n\nNo objective behavioural or morphological data are presented. Claims should not be made without presentation of evidence;\n\nThe timing and causes of death of animals is not reported;\n\nThe high death rate supposedly caused by GM soybean defies credibility and if correct would have been seen in previous studies â€“ high death rates likely to be a result of poor experimental design; and\n\nA total failure of adult animals fed GM soybean to produce offspring was so remarkable as to be considered unbelievable.\n\nThese researchers considered Ermakovaâ€™s claims implausible and â€˜that no meaningful inferences can be drawn from these resultsâ€™, and they contradicted peer-reviewed work on the same topic (Teshima et al. Citation2000; Brake and Evenson Citation2004; Zhu et al. Citation2004).\n\nIn the studies where disadvantage health effects have been noted from food derived from GM crops () the claims are not about the GM method used but rather as a result of the trait-related specific gene introduced (Lack Citation2002; The Royal Society Citation2016). When these occur and are identified they would not be moved forward commercially (Lack Citation2002; Konig et al. Citation2004). Allergenicity testing (EFSA GMO Panel et al. Citation2021, Citation2022a) has resulted in the absence of transgenic proteins in foods that might cause allergic reactions (Lehrer and Bannon Citation2005). As an example, a gene from Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) when transferred to a soybean cultivar to improve its nutritional value was shown to test positive in the serum assay for allergenicity by cross-reactivity with Brazil nut (Nordlee et al. Citation1996) and so its development was terminated.\n\nThere is no doubt that testing for potential health effects of GM crops is complex and polarising. The situation is well described by DeFrancesco (Citation2013) who concludes that â€˜critics and proponents of GM crops alike agree that genetically modified foods have failed to produce any untoward [human] health effects, and that the risk to human health from foods contaminated with pathogens is far greater than from GM cropsâ€™. Indeed, extensive reviews of impacts of GM crops such as Bt corn, cotton and maize conclude that they are nontoxic to humans and pose no significant concern for allergenicity (Betz et al. Citation2000; Sasson Citation2018). It has also been pointed out that there are many naturally occurring potentially toxic molecules in plants, but virtually none of them is ever present at a concentration that would cause harm (Chassy Citation2010).\n\nDespite that, opponents of GM crops and food cite potential risks of allergenicity (Bernstein et al. Citation2003). However, it is standard that during deregulation the allergenicity of the gene product is assessed either against a panel of blood donor samples or via prick tests (Bolhaar et al. Citation2005; Goodman et al. Citation2008; Ladics Citation2008). The lack of allergenicity needs to be demonstrated before a GM crop can be deregulated (Schauzu et al. Citation2012; Selb et al. Citation2017; Ladics Citation2019; EFSA GMO Panel et al. Citation2017, Citation2021). In a review of 83 studies (Dunn et al. Citation2017) none identified that direct consumption of a GM food was associated with an increased rate of clinical allergy, and only three noted increased sensitisation to the GM product, one of which was associated with the Brazil nut allergy and the other two showed no increase in markers in any clinical allergy in mouse models. Currently, there appears to be no serious risk about allergenicity of GM foods produced and consumed, and while current assessment procedures are robust, new information and technologies will continue to refine these procedures (Yavari et al. Citation2016). Allergenicity testing of GM crops often uses a rodent model but this has been criticised on the basis that not all proteins demonstrate allergic reaction using a digestive model and other tests are required (Verhoeckx et al. Citation2019).\n\nFood quality and nutritive value\n\nTwo issues need to be examined here: (1) the deliberate use of GM technologies to improve the nutritional value of crops, and (2) the impact of transgenes used to provide other traits on crop nutritional quality.\n\nIt has been considered that crops could be genetically transformed to improve their nutritive quality and value in an attempt to eradicate or lessen the impact of malnutrition in some countries (Bouis Citation2007; Farre et al. Citation2011; Jones Citation2015; Garg et al. Citation2018; Medina-Lozano and DÃ­az Citation2022). Attitudes towards the use of biofortified foods using supplementation rather than GM technologies has also struggled to be adopted without approved health and nutrition claims (Gannon et al. Citation2014; Wortmann et al. Citation2018; Adekambi et al. Citation2020; Welk et al. Citation2021). GM approaches have the benefit of being able to enhance the expression of nutritional traits such as mineral availability and vitamin content (Brinch-Pedersen et al. Citation2007; Zhu et al. Citation2007) that may not otherwise be available within the plantâ€™s genome. It has been proposed that biotechnology could also be part of the solution to reducing naturally occurring allergies in food rather than a cause of increased concern (Morandini Citation2010). Garg et al. (Citation2018) summarise numerous examples of crops that have demonstrated improvement in nutritional value through the use of transgenesis. The majority (over 50 events) are still at a research stage but 10 had been released as commercially available technologies (). It makes good sense that when GM technologies lead to compositional changes that special consideration should be given to their nutritional impacts (De Santis et al. Citation2018).\n\nComparison of Golden Rice with a non-GM cultivar, Nakding, has shown no significant difference between the two cultivars in population densities of insect pests and natural enemies (Kim et al. Citation2010). There is a growing public awareness of nutritionally enhanced GM rice (Challa et al. Citation2020). A lysine enhanced GM maize (LY038) developed to accumulate free Lys in the germ portion of maize grain and also stacked with Bt gene (LY038 X Mon 810) providing protection against European maize borer were fed to broilers over a 42 d period in comparison with non-GM maize. Weight gain, feed efficiency, carcass yield and composition of broilers fed diets containing LY038 or LY038 Ã— MON 810 were not significantly different from that of broilers fed lysine supplemented diets and were significantly superior to that of broilers fed conventional maize diets without supplemental lysine (Lucas et al. Citation2007). Another transformation event to enhance lysine in maize used the gene for a lysine-rich protein (sb401) obtained from wild potatoes (Solanum berthaultii) to produce Y642 transgenic maize (He et al. Citation2009). In a rodent feeding trial, Y642 was compared with a near-isogenic non-genetically modified (non-GM) commercially available control quality protein maize (Nongda 108). There were no adverse diet-related differences in body weights, feed consumption/utilisation, clinical chemistry, haematology, absolute and relative organ weights observed. Y642 was judged to be as safe and nutritious as conventional quality protein maize. Processed soybean meal (SBM) from two soybean transgenic cultivars developed for higher protein content were compared with two non-GM cultivars for levels of amino acid, gross energy, lipid, and fibre and digestibility of metabolisable energy and amino acids using cockerels (Edwards et al. Citation2000). Results indicated that at least one of the GM soybeans had considerable advantages over conventional soybean meal as a feed ingredient for broiler chickens. An evaluation of transgenic lupin seeds (Lupinus angustifolius) with higher contents of methionine using broiler chickens showed that the higher AME value in transgenic lupins may be related to the lower content of soluble non-starch polysaccharides (45.6 vs 60.7 g kgâˆ’1 air-dry basis) (Ravindran et al. Citation2002). The amino acids in transgenic lupins were as digestible as those in non-GM lupins. To improve the level of digestible protein in maize used for animal feed the milk protein porcine Î±-lactalbumin was transformed into maize and expressed in both callus and kernels (Yang et al. Citation2002). An upregulation of the carotenoid pathway in Canola using a bacterial phytoene synthase gene (crtB) not only increased carotenoid levels but also fatty acid composition resulting in a higher percentage of oleic acid but decreased percentage of linoleic and linolenic acids (Shewmaker et al. Citation1999).\n\nIn seeking to understand the extent of unintended effects of transgenes on composition and nutritional value the compositional analyses of 129 GM crops have been investigated by the US Food and Drug Administration which showed no significant differences, for any plant compounds believed to have biological relevance when compared to non-GM equivalents (DeFrancesco Citation2013). Some unintended consequences of GM crops have been described as beneficial. For example, herbicide-tolerant soybeans have been shown to have an overall reduction in phytoestrogen levels of 12%â€“14% compared to their isogenic comparator crop, mostly attributable to reductions in the concentrations of genistin and, to a lesser extent, in daidzin (LappÃ© et al. Citation1999). In GM rice, containing CryIAc and sck (trypsin inhibitor) genes the levels of sucrose, mannitol and glutamic acid were significantly higher than for the non-GM equivalent (Zhou et al. Citation2009). A comparison of three different GM rice cultivars (one expressing antifungal genes, the second a chitinase gene, and the third Cry1Ac and sck genes) with their non-GM comparators showed some variation in amino acid levels which led to the conclusion that the nutrition value of transgenic rice had decreased (Jiao et al. Citation2010).\n\nUnintended consequences of traits in GM crops â€“ fact or myth?\n\nWhile many have condemned GM crops for unintended consequences, some of these claims need scrutiny while others need to be taken seriously and managed appropriately. Indeed if one reflects on non-GM conventional agricultural methods there is no doubt that herbicide and pesticide application can have large and well-documented unintended consequences (Pilson and Prendeville Citation2004; Rezende-Teixeira et al. Citation2022). And while â€˜two wrongs donâ€™t make a rightâ€™ it is worth examining whether the use of GM crops may result in fewer and less concerning, more easily managed unintended consequences. Discussed in the previous section have been the largely unconfirmed unintended consequences of GM crops regarding feed and food safety, and health-related issues. Science commentators soon after the commercialisation of GM crops expressed concern about their impact on the environment (Snow and Palma Citation1997; Wolfenbarger and Phifer Citation2000), non-target species (EFSA GMO Panel et al. Citation2010), and gene flow (Snow Citation2002). While not dealt with in detail, concerns about glyphosate-tolerant GM crops causing differences in plant mineral nutrition (e.g. Zobiole et al. Citation2010) and disease susceptibility (Means and Kremer Citation2007) have been proven incorrect (Duke et al. Citation2012). Reviews on concerns related to the use of GM crops continued to provide insights and mitigation measures to reduce the ecological impact (Lombardo et al. Citation2020; Vulchi et al. Citation2022)\n\nIncreased herbicide tolerance of weeds\n\nHerbicide resistance in weeds is a global issue and not just restricted to, or solely caused by, the use of herbicide-tolerant GM crops (Heap Citation2014). Even in 2014 it was recognised that the lack of new novel herbicide chemistries combined with the rapid increase in multiple resistance in weeds threatens crop production worldwide. This is not simply a herbicide-tolerant GM crop-related issue, although it is acknowledged that the overuse of glyphosate to manage weeds in GM herbicide-tolerant crops has in some situations lead to the development of glyphosate-resistant weeds (Mortensen et al. Citation2012; Shaner et al. Citation2012; Brookes and Barfoot Citation2017). In 2022, there were 56 weeds recognised as exhibiting resistance to glyphosate worldwide, although several are not associated with glyphosate-tolerant GM crops (Weedscience Citation2022). Where herbicide tolerance of weeds has developed in GM crops (Wakelin and Preston Citation2006; Ghanizadeh et al. Citation2019; Rigon et al. Citation2020) the issue here is more to do with poor management and use of herbicides not the development of GM crops per se. To avoid the development of glyphosate-resistant weeds GM crop growers are being advised to include other herbicides (with different and complementary modes of action, such as dicamba) in combination with glyphosate (Green and Owen Citation2011; Vencill et al. Citation2012; Brookes Citation2014; Brookes and Barfoot Citation2017; Ravisankar et al. Citation2017). This would also be a useful strategy for avoiding herbicide resistance in non-GM crops (Beckie et al. Citation2021).\n\nOveruse of herbicides and pesticides\n\nThere have been instances where economically important pests have become resistant to synthetic insecticides. This can lead to overuse of insecticides in a desperate bid to control them (Benbrook Citation2012). However, this situation can also be resolved using Bt GM crops. A good example of this occurred in China where cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) became resistant to the pesticides being used in the 1990s and ongoing control came from the use of Bt cotton in the late 1990s (Wu et al. Citation2008; Lu et al. Citation2010b). However, Coupe and Capel (Citation2016) indicate that in the USA there has been a substantial reduction in the amount of insecticides used on both maize and cotton since the introduction of GM crops. A study in China has demonstrated that Bt GM cotton was found to be most effective at a low level of pest pressure and that high levels of insecticides have been used despite the cultivation of Bt GM cotton cultivars in response to a decrease in the effectiveness of the technology with an increase in pest pressure (Kuosmanen et al. Citation2006).\n\nDespite the proposition that the use of glyphosate-tolerant GM crops would reduce (or at least not increase) total herbicide use (Gianessi Citation2005; Bonny Citation2008), there is an alternative proposition (Benbrook Citation2012). It is argued that while in the 5 years after their introduction 1996 lower amounts of herbicides were applied since then, overall herbicide use in herbicide-tolerant GM crops has increased in USA (SchÃ¼tte et al. Citation2017). This study quoted Brookes and Barfoot (Citation2015) as evidence of this turnaround. However, Brookes and Barfoot (Citation2015) explain this situation somewhat differently because the non-GM cropping area is so small compared to the GM crop area that the non-GM cropping data set is likely to be biased and unrepresentative of the levels of herbicide actually used. When this bias is addressed by using the average recorded values for herbicide usage on conventional crops for years only when the conventional crop accounted for more than 50% of the total crop and, secondly, in other years (e.g. from 1999 for soybeans, from 2001 for cotton and from 2007 for maize in the US) applying estimates of the likely usage if the whole US crop was no longer using crop biotechnology, based on opinion from extension and industry advisors across USA then cumulatively since 1996, then there have been savings of âˆ’3.7% (32.3 million kg) in active ingredient usage and âˆ’24.9% for the field Environmental Impact Quotient load. Despite this there are others who believe that herbicide-tolerant GM crops, and in particular soybeans, accumulate herbicides due to overuse of glyphosate (Duke et al. Citation2003). This has been reviewed by BÃ¸hn and Millstone (Citation2019) who question the amount of glyphosate entering the food chain and their impacts on consumers, which based on other information is mostly used as feed for animals (Lucht Citation2015; Sieradzki et al. Citation2021).\n\nIndeed it would seem that average amount of herbicide applied and the associated environmental load, as measured by the Environmental Impact Quotient indicator, have increased on both GM herbicide-tolerant and non-GM crops (Brookes Citation2014). This has resulted from the increasing incidence of weed species resistance to herbicides and an increased awareness of the consequences of relying on a single or very limited number of herbicides for weed control. Diversifying weed management systems in GM herbicide-tolerant crops has been motivated by the desire to maintain effective weed control with the benefits of reduced tillage. It is still proposed that despite the increase in herbicide use in recent years, GM herbicide-tolerant technology continues to deliver significant economic and environmental gains to US farmers. Others however disagree (Benbrook Citation2012) or indicate that it depends on the crop. A reduction in annual herbicide application rate has occurred for canola (Gusta et al. Citation2011) and maize, but has remained unchanged for cotton, and increased for soybean (Coupe and Capel Citation2016). There is still however the view that GM crops tolerant to herbicides are the main cause for herbicide contaminated water, soils, and wildlife (Cuker et al. Citation2020), but often with little proof of linked causality.\n\nSecondary pests becoming dominant\n\nThe argument is that while GM Bt crops may reduce targeted insect pests, they provide an opportunity for secondary pests to prevail (Zhao et al. Citation2011). Indeed, it has been shown in USA that Bt GM maize expressing Cry1Ab protein, which controls the European maize borer and maize earworm (Helicoverpa zea), provides a competitive advantage to another pest the western bean cutworm (Striacosta albicosta) particularly when maize earworm numbers and fitness were reduced (Dorhout and Rice Citation2010). In China, the second country to adopt Bt cotton after the USA, early results showed that the GM cotton had dramatically boosted yield, reduced the impact of cotton bollworms and cut the use of insecticides by as much as 70%, saving money and protecting both people and the environment from the broad-spectrum synthetic toxic chemicals (Pearson Citation2006; Qiu Citation2010). However, after 7 years it was observed that populations of other cotton pests, particularly mirids (Apolygus lucorum), had grown significantly in number. This has been confirmed in other studies (Niu et al. Citation2020) which indicate that feeding on leaves of the GM cotton with either Cry1Ac or CpTI proteins had few toxic effects on mirids. These had previously been controlled by the broad-spectrum insecticides. Future control of these secondary pests would either rely on returning to broad-spectrum insecticides, other forms of biological pest control, or the use of multiple stacked Bt GM cotton cultivars (Wang et al. Citation2008). Despite this concern a thorough economic analysis using nationally representative data over 15 years has shown that the economic benefit of Bt GM cotton did not diminish but remained stable and continuous in China (Qiao Citation2015; Qiao and Huang Citation2020).\n\nSoybean grown in China can be adversely affected by four lepidopteran pests â€“ Spodoptera litura, beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua), black cutworm (Agrotis ypsilon) and cotton bollworm. Cry1Ac-expressing Bt soybeans may provide good protection against H. armigera but alternative control measures are required to manage the other three pests species (Yu et al. Citation2013). However, it could be argued that this is not a situation where a secondary pest becomes more dominant but rather indicates the need for a GM soybean with multiple Bt Cry genes that provide a wider pest resistance impact as has occurred in Brazil with multiple stacked Bt genes expressing Cry1A.105, Cry2Ab2, and Cry1Ac (Bacalhau et al. Citation2020), and in a separate study Cry1Ac and Cry1F (Machado et al. Citation2020). Experience with Bt cotton has revealed that the emergence of secondary pests requires adjustments to pest management systems to address these â€˜newâ€™ pests (Kennedy Citation2008). However, there is evidence that the adoption of Bt GM cotton did result in pest suppression benefiting non-GM cotton farmers (Wesseler et al. Citation2011).\n\nImpacts on non-target organisms\n\nGM traits are primarily targeted to control a specific for the pest or pathogen (Rahman et al. Citation2015), whereas crop protection chemicals may affect beneficial organisms as well as the intended target (Cattaneo et al. Citation2006). A meta-analysis of 10 publications on Bt GM maize plants expressing resistance to Coleoptera (35%) and Lepidoptera (65%) has shown that GM maize cultivation has no effect on non-target organism in the taxonomic groups Anthocoridae, Aphididae, Araneae, Carabidae, Chrysopidae (adults and larvae), Coccinellidae (adults and larvae), Nabidae, Nitidulidae and Staphylinidae (Pellegrino et al. Citation2018). However, Braconidae were significantly decreased by 32%, and Cicadellidae were significantly increased. Another meta-analysis of 42 field experiments indicated that non-target invertebrates are generally more abundant in Bt cotton and Bt maize fields than in non-GM fields managed with insecticides (Marvier et al. Citation2007). A three year field study in Brazil evaluating the effects of Bt GM soybean expressing Cry1Ac and Cry1F proteins showed no effect on the diversity and abundance of non-target arthropods compared with non-GM Bt soybean that was not sprayed with insecticide (Marques et al. Citation2018). An earlier review also concluded that field studies show that the abundance and activity of parasitoids and predators are similar in Bt and non-Bt crops (Romeis et al. Citation2006; Chen et al. Citation2008). In contrast, applications of insecticides on non-GM have usually resulted in negative impacts on biological control organisms. Results comparing single and stacked Bt genes have determined that there is a low probability of harm to non-target organisms so long as the potency of the proteins when combined is not greater than when separate (Raybould et al. Citation2012). The fate of Bt proteins from transgenic crops has been shown short half-lives through to low level residues lasting for some months (Clark et al. Citation2005). However, the conclusion was that non-target effects of Bt protein indicate that there is a low level of hazard.\n\nThe use of Bt cotton in China has shown that marked increase in abundance of three types of generalist arthropod predators (ladybirds (Coccinellidae), lacewings (Neuroptera), and spiders (Araneae)) and a decreased abundance of aphid (Aphidoidea) pests (Lu et al. Citation2012). This study also found evidence that the predators might provide additional biocontrol services spilling over from Bt cotton fields onto neighbouring crops (maize, peanut (Arachis hypogaea), and soybean). The use of Bt rice in India has shown no effect on non-target insects (i.e. insects belonging to orders other than diptera and lepidoptera) (Bashir et al. Citation2004). Similarly, in India the use of Bt cotton has had no impact on cotton aphids (Aphis gossypii) serving as prey or host to several predators and parasitoids and their honeydew is an important energy source for several arthropods (Lawo et al. Citation2009).\n\nA systematic review of data from studies consisting of 7279 individual invertebrate records from 233 experiments in 120 articles, 75% of which were from peer-reviewed journals published between 1997 and 2020 were used to determine whether growing Bt maize changed the environmental abundance of non-target animals such as arthropods, earthworms and nematodes, especially as compared to growing non-genetically modified maize accompanied by the pesticide necessary to control major pests (Meissle et al. Citation2022). The review showed that Bt maize had no negative effects on most invertebrate groups including ladybeetles, flower bugs (Insecta), and lacewings. However, populations of Braconidae insects, which are parasitoid wasps that prey on maize borers, were reduced with Bt corn.\n\nAn interesting consideration has been the determination of the impact of Bt maize by-products (pollen and decomposing plan"
