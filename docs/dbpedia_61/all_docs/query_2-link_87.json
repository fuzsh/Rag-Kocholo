The basic emotions and motivations and many motor patterns, including most of our facial expressions, were formed by our phylogeny. Our sensory apparatus is in many ways “biased” by phylogenetic adaptations; even our ways of thinking and talking are to a significant extent grounded and channeled by our evolutionary history. The range of modifiability is set within genetically influenced limits. It is also a generally accepted fact that evolutionary history unifies all the sciences dealing with our species, including the humanities. Whatever we do-whether we pray or not, follow a particular custom, or obey a particular ideology-an activity finally manifests itself as an investment of at least time, which enters into the final cost-benefit calculation and ultimately becomes measured by selection against the yardstick of inclusive fitness. Yet, this was far from being the accepted view at the time Daniel G. Freedman started his pioneering efforts to explore human behavior using an evolutionary approach. In some areas of the humanities and social sciences it was even considered an unacceptable way of thinking, which is all the more reason to appreciate and admire those pioneers whose search for truth led them to swim against the fashionable current. Dr. Freedman started his investigations in human ethology with a study of the smiling response and the fear of strangers in infants (1964, 1974). His approach was characterized by detailed description and documentation by film. Among other things, he observed that children born blind respond to their mothers’ voices by “looking” at the source of the sound, thus behaving as if they were seeing their mothers. The nystagmus of the blind is thereby arrested. This is evidence for a centrally programmed XY\n\nFOREWORD fixation process, the function of which seems to be to enhance maternal attachment. Mothers respond with delight to eye contact with their babies. They interpret it as a sign of personal attachment, which simultaneously rewards the mother and confers a selective advantage on such infant behavior. The film documentation and publication of these exciting findings came out in 1964. This study was followed by others on human infancy (Freedman, 1974) and social hierarchy (Freedman, 1975). All these papers combined the evolutionary approach with consideration of cultural factors in what was, considering the latest theories, prescient recognition of the fact that nature and nurture interact in many ways. This interactive approach, characteristic of Dr. Freedman, is reflected in the subtitle of his book, Human Sociobiology: A Holistic Approach (1979). Traditional ethology based on thorough observation, documentation, and experimentation is here combined with modern model building based on sociobiological cost-benefit algorithms. These approaches are combined to powerful effect by Dr. Freedman. He has contributed enormously to the development of behavioral genetics, human ethology, and evolutionary psychology, and we owe him much. This book is an expression of our gratitude.

Freedman’s unique contributions to the study of human behavior and to reflect on his special approach to scholarship. This book aims to convey the sense of excitement that has accompanied the transformations that psychology, as an academic discipline, has undergone in recent years. There has been a proliferation of research activities directed toward elucidating biological and evolutionary influences on behavior and their interactions with environmental variables. These activities are traceable, in part, to recent discoveries in human genetics, renewed interest in naturalistic studies, and increased respect for the evolved bases of behavior. These important efforts have enhanced appreciation for the different levels of analysis (i.e., proximal and distal) required for full understanding of human psychological development. These events are also responsible for the newly focused attention to issues and problems located at the juncture of behavioral genetics, human ethology, and evolutionary psychology. A fresh approach to old issues (e.g., gender differences in cognition and variations in human social organizaWe are grateful to the American Psychological Association Science Directorate for the generous support that made the Festschrift possible.

New areas of commonality are being defined by researchers who previously conducted parallel investigations without the benefits of interaction and exchange. The papers that resulted from the October 1995 Festschrift for Dr. Freedman have brought these important perspectives and accomplishments to the fore. We encourage researchers and students to rethink current psychological problems and issues in light of this new material. Psychology departments stand to benefit considerably from welcoming scholars with Dr. Freedman’s brand of interdisciplinary virtuosity. Contributions from faculty members with specializations in biology, anthropology, sociology, and evolutionary history, as well as those with training in more traditional areas of human development, are needed if psychology programs are to remain dynamic, integrated, and current. Many students today are learning about genetic influences on shyness, evolved sex differences in mate selection, and the evolutionary basis of moral behavior from popular books and magazines, yet they cannot find courses that cover these topics. We trust that the present collection will inspire university administrators and department chairs to resolve this situation. OUR MENTOR We were very fortunate to have had Dr. Freedman as our mentor in graduate school. Dr. Freedman was a dedicated teacher. He cared about us as students, sympathized with us, and also demanded our best efforts. Dr. Freedman’s treatment of us was informal-he invited us to socialize with him, his family, and esteemed campus visitors alike. Much of what we learned took place outside the classroom and library, even beyond field research settings. When E. 0. Wilson’s ground-breaking book, Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, was published in 1975, Dr. Freedman organized a weekly discussion group for his graduate students. His classes were often informal, even a trifle unplanned! However, their very spontaneity carried the lesson that behavior is something that is easy to talk about and that scientific ideas can arise in unexpected ways. xviii\n\nPREFACE We were aware that Dr. Freedman encountered a great deal of ideological opposition, mainly from people who misconstrued what evolutionists were saying. He did not avoid these debates and, in fact, seemed to take a certain pleasure in being an iconoclast. He handled opposition with dignity, and accorded his opponents the respect they sometimes denied him. xix\n\nTribute to Dan Daniel G. Freedman is a distinguished psychologist whose contributions to child development, behavioral genetics, human ethology, and evolutionary psychology continue to inspire numerous colleagues and students, both in the United States and abroad. Dr. Freedman was, in the words of a colleague, “ahead of his time in research and thinking about genes and behavior.” Indeed, his articles and books anticipated the current climate Photo courteiy of Carol C:. \\\\‘c.isfeld. xxi\n\nTRIBUTE TO DAN of scholarly activity in the behavioral sciences. Dr. Freedman recognized that biological and evolutionary viewpoints were required for full understanding of the complex diversity of human behavior. These multiple perspectives are now being increasingly embraced by researchers in psychology and related fields. Dr. Freedman received a BA degree in psychology from the University of California, Berkeley (1949), an MA degree in psychology from the University of Colorado, Boulder (1953), and a PhD degree in psychology from Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts ( 1957). He held a U.S. Public Health Service Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute, San Francisco ( 1957-1959), where he later directed a longitudinal study of infant twins (1960-1963). He received a National Institute of Health Special Fellowship for study at the Institute for Medical Genetics, Uppsala, Sweden (1963-1964). On returning to the United States, Dr. Freedman joined the University of Chicago, Committee on Human Development, as an assistant professor ofbiology (1964-1968). He then co-led (with Gregory Bateson) an observational study of cultures around the world with the International School of America (1971-1972) before rejoining the University of Chicago as a professor of psychology (1977-present). He has held visiting professorships and scholarships at the University of Denver ( 1966), the Australian National University, Canberra (1979), the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1986), and the Institute for Juvenile Research, Chicago (1989). He was also associated with the Center for Family Studies at Northwestern University, Chicago ( 1985-1986). Most recently, he was a visiting scholar at Nankai University, Tianjin, China (1995), in the department of sociology. Those of us who have worked closely with Dr. Freedman know that his goals concerning publication are very particular: “I would rather wait until I have something important to say” was the way he put it at the Festschrift in his honor at the University of Chicago in October 1995. Nonetheless, Dr. Freedman is the author or editor of three books and more than 50 scholarly articles. He is a filmmaker as well; he produced six documentaries on the behavior of puppies of various breeds and infants and children from various cultures. xxii\n\nTRIBUTE TO DAN Dr. Freedman is currently professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Chicago. Present research interests include cross-cultural variations in mother-infant interaction and internal working models of attachment. He is pursuing these interests from his new residence in New Mexico. His hope is to return to China to study the effects of the onechild-per-family policy on parenting and personality development. xxiii\n\nSECTION I Introduction\n\nPursuing the Big Picture Nancy L. Segal, Glenn E. Weisfeld, and Carol C. Weisfeld his volume was inspired by the insights and discoveries of a distin- T guished psychologist. As a young investigator in the 1950s and 1960s, Daniel G. Freedman argued that the application of biological and evolutionary viewpoints was required for full understanding of the complexities and vagaries of human behavioral development. He upheld this view despite challenges from some psychologists who dismissed such theorizing as uninformative, irrelevant, or pessimistic with respect to understanding contemporary human development (see Scarr, 1995a; Smith, 1987, for extended discussion). His human ethological analyses were pioneering and encouraged appreciation for naturalistic studies concerned with the evolved bases of behavior. A species-wide comparative view of human behavior also helped set the stage for current interest in cross-cultural research. There has been a recent “rediscovery” and growing respect for many of the concepts and themes that are clearly articulated in Dr. Freedman’s early work. The contents of this book reflect this emerging reorientation within psychology and related fields. Principles, techniques, and interpretations from behavioral genetics, human ethology, evolutionary psychol3\n\nSEGAL ET AL ogy, and cross-cultural analyses are uniquely interwoven. This collection is intended to continue his efforts toward increased acknowledgment of contributions to be made to psychological inquiry from these multiple perspectives. Two of Dr. Freedman’s classic studies, which continue to be cited in developmental psychology textbooks and in studies of infant development, mark the critical beginnings of a research program devoted to elucidating developmental processes and outcomes. The first study, published in 1958, examined interactions between genetic background, or genotype, and rearing practices among four different breeds of dog. The critical role of the genotype as a factor affecting the observed behavioral outcome, or phenotype, was a revelation to the young clinical psychologist whose orientation was primarily environmental. This intellectual epiphany launched a career focused on uniting the fields of psychology and biology. Questions of biologicalfunction (promotion of survival and reproduction) became paramount. In other words, how and why does a particular behavior affect the fitness of individuals in a given environment? What does evidence of genetic influence, or lack of genetic influence, imply with respect to the evolved bases of behavior? Research on the functional significance of the infant smile, fear of strangers, and fear of bearded male faces followed. This work led naturally to incorporating concepts from behavioral genetics, ethology, evolutionary psychology, and cross-cultural research into his studies. Most significant, Dr. Freedman recognized the interconnectedness among these areas and the fact that each alone provides only part of a bigger picture. In another classic study, Freedman and Keller (1963) compared similarity in mental and motor abilities between identical, or monozygotic (MZ), twins and fraternal, or dizygotic (DZ), twins during the first year of life. The finding of greater resemblance between MZ twins, especially in motor behaviors, was consistent with a contribution from genetic factors. These two early studies inspired many other investigators to consider more seriously the interplay of genetic and environmental factors underlying individual differences in behavior in humans and nonhumans. These initial efforts launched a resume rich with theoretical and em4\n\nPURSUING THE BIG PICTURE pirical analyses that examined behavior through new lenses. This work included studies of children’s dominance hierarchies and gender differences in play behaviors. At the same time, Dr. Freedman’s notions of psychological and biological connectedness were still evolving, and he subjected them to periodic reappraisal in several theoretical papers. Throughout the years, Dr. Freedman’s essential and unique contribution to psychology has been a commitment to a holistic view of nature and nurture. As Martin Daly and Margo Wilson put it, “The naturenurture debate has been pronounced dead many times, but it won’t stay buried” (1983, p. 249). More recently, other investigators have proposed new formulations relevant to the commitment to holism seen in Dr. Freedman’s work. Thomas J. Bouchard, Jr., and colleagues, for example (Bouchard, Lykken, McGue, Segal, h Tellegen, 1990), recast nature versus nurture as nature via nurture, reflecting the conviction that the genome guides the individual to select particular environments during the course of development. This is a very effective way to view relationships between genes and culture, mind and body, and past and present environments, as Dr. Freedman has explained. It is encouraging that some researchers are reconsidering the contributions made possible by interpreting behavioral data with reference to biological and evolutionary viewpoints. Interdisciplinary efforts promise to add richness and texture to what we can know about human development. However, there is still a long way to go, and it is our hope that this volume will make the case for the undecided. CHRONOLOGY OF COLLEAGUES The organization of this volume was surprisingly simple given that contributors fell naturally into the various content sections. Their intellectual niches have variously overlapped with Dr. Freedman’s outlook and interests at different stages in his career. In the mid-l950s, John Paul Scott chaired Dr. Freedman’s doctoral work on behavioral differences among four dog breeds when he was a fellow at the Jackson Laboratories, in Bar Harbor, Maine. Dr. Freedman’s friendship with Paul Ekman began in the 5\n\nSEGAL ET AL late 1950s when both were associated with the Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute, in San Francisco. Irving I. Gottesman met Dr. Freedman in 1960 at an early Behavioral Genetics meeting, hosted by the late Steven G. Vandenberg, then director of the behavioral section of the Louisville Twin Study. An early 1960s International Ethological Congress, held in The Netherlands, led to a meeting with Nicholas G. Blurton Jones; colleagues had encouraged them to meet given their mutual interests in biology and human development. Associations with Peter H. Wolff during the 1960s and with Lewis P. Lipsitt during the early 1970s evolved out of common interests in human infancy and participation in professional meetings. International conferences on ethology in the 1960s facilitated a professional link with Wolfgang M. Schleidt who, according to Dr. Freedman, was a favorite student of Konrad Lorenz. In 1978, both attended the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in Washington, D.C., where they witnessed the water dousing of E. 0. Wilson, author of Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, by a group calling themselves the International Committee Against Racism (INCAR; also see Wilson, 1994). Their mutual outrage at this loathsome act bound them together as colleagues and friends. Robert A. LeVine and Dr. Freedman held appointments as faculty members at the University of Chicago in the 1960s and 1970s, during which time Dr. Freedman served as an advisor on infancy for LeVine’s human development project conducted in Nigeria. The excitement surrounding sociobiology in the mid-1970s and a meeting called by Irven DeVore in Cambridge, Massachusetts, were responsible for Dr. Freedman meeting with Robert L. Trivers, then a graduate student at Harvard University. Seven of the twenty-four contributors to this book were graduate students who worked with Dr. Freedman at the University of Chicago between 1970 and 1990. Their thesis topics, listed below, reflect the intellectual breadth and creative approaches to understanding human development that Dr. Freedman brought to his role as mentor. These individuals include Jerome H. Barkow (Hausa and Maguzawa: Processes of Group 6\n\nPURSUING THE BIG PICTURE Differentiation in a Rural Area in North Central State, Nigeria, 1970), Robert s. Marvin (Attachment, Exploratory and Communicative Behavior of Two-Year-Old, Three-Year-Old and Four-Year-Old Children, 1972), Ritch C. Savin-Williams (Dominance-Submission Behaviors and Hierarchies in Young Adolescents at a Summer Camp: Predictors, Styles, and Sex Differences, 1977), Glenn E. Weisfeld (Determinants and Behavioral Correlates of Dominance in Adolescent Boys, 1978), Carol C. Weisfeld (Boys and Girls in Competition: The Context and Communication of Female Inhibition, 1980), Nancy L. Segal (Cooperation, Competition and Altruism Within Twin Sets: A Reappraisal, 1982), and Roger J. R. Levesque (Adolescents in Love: An Exploration ofAdolescent Love Experiences Across and Within Five SocioCultural Groups, 1990). Several contributors to this volume became acquainted with Dr. Freedman’s work either through his writings or through his associations with their own colleagues. They include J. Michael Bailey, Gregory Carey, Lisa M. Diamond, H. Hill Goldsmith, Kristen Hawkes, James F. O’Connell, and Susan L. Trumbetta. ACROSS THE GENERATIONS Embedded within the fabric of scholarly contributions are revealing insights into the developmental dynamics of teaching and research. One finds, for example, that similar behavioral phenomena are of interest to succeeding generations of the same intellectual “family.” The following events exemplify this process. Harry Harlow directed Abraham Maslow’s study of primate dominance at the Wisconsin Regional Primate Center in Madison, Wisconsin. Maslow, in turn, directed Dr. Freedman’s study of dominant (and self-actualized) women in Massachusetts. Dr. Freedman then directed several studies of dominance in children around the world, conducted by his own students, Don Omark, Murray Edelman, Ritch Savin-Williams, Carol Weisfeld, Glenn Weisfeld, and others. At present, Glenn Weisfeld is continuing this work in Beijing, China, in collaboration with Qi Dong. Dr. Freedman’s interests and influence now affect younger scholars via his former graduate students, who supervise dissertations on 7\n\nSEGAL ET A1 attachment, social relations, human emotions, gender differences, and related topics. Dr. Freedman’s work has also affected the research and thinking of contemporary scholars with whom his relationship has been less direct. For example, Plomin and Rowe (1979) launched a discussion of relationships among natural selection, individual differences, and behavioral genetics with reference to Dr. Freedman’s studies of infant social behavior. Silverman (1987) reasoned that Dr. Freedman’s findings of group differences in maternal style, which corresponded to differences in infant temperament, might hold clues about how inborn temperamental dispositions are affected by the environment to exert their influences on personality. Archer credited Dr. Freedman (1964, 1965) with demonstrating an innate basis to smiling. Dr. Freedman, wrote Archer, “noted in passing that the universal presence of smiling in different cultures” was consistent with this view (1992, p. 179). Later cross-cultural work by Eibl-Eibesfeldt and by Ekman in the 1960s and 1970s supported the universality of facial expressions and motor patterns, including the smile. Kagan, Arcus, and Snidman (1994) built on Dr. Freedman’s findings of genetically based behavioral differences between Caucasian and Asian newborns (Freedman & Freedman, 1969) in a recent study of Irish and Chinese infants. Dr. Freedman’s observational studies of dominance hierarchies have also inspired a book (1997) to be edited by Leon Sloman and Paul Gilbert, which views depression as a variant of subordination behavior. Dr. Freedman’s research interests have now refocused on crosscultural differences in mother-infant attachment in evolutionary perspective. His recent visit to the laboratory of Professor Guoan Yue, at Nankai University, in Tianjin, China, will help shape the research activities of Chinese students working in that area. Factors influencing mother-infant interaction should be of considerable importance in China, given that social policy mandates one-child families in that nation. Common to these scenarios is the fact that a similar problem is under consideration, but each new generation addresses it in a different way, by asking slightly different questions, applying new methodologies, or 8\n\nPURSUING THE BIG PICTURE examining a different gender or stage of the life cycle. Their cumulative efforts illuminate areas that had been previously obscured, thereby highlighting the finest qualities of the teaching process. QUESTIONS AND CONTROVERSIES Just as some issues and findings endure and develop, they can fuel conflicts and controversies over their veracity and implications. There is no question that Dr. Freedman’s efforts have helped to move psychology toward greater integration as a field. Many more colleagues are now receptive to the pervasive effects of biological influences on human behavior-the growing body of relevant data, especially from behavioral genetic sources, cannot be easily dismissed. At the same time, there is considerable resistance to research that demonstrates genetic effects on human behavioral variation or that attempts to understand human nature in light of evolutionary principles. It is our position that this resistance reflects misconception of what genetic influence means and what evolutionary analyses may suggest. As will be discussed in the introduction to section 11, genetic influence does not mean that behavior is intractable. Behavior is, after all, a product of genes expressed in an environment. Environmental factors can modify behavioral outcomes, an effect that is apparent in the use of drug treatments to control mental disorder and language classes to improve the skills of learning-disabled students. It is also instructive to remind ourselves that the only source of difference between genetically identical twins is environmental, and even identical twins do not show perfect resemblance in any measured trait. However, some behaviors may be more or less resistant to the effects of available interventions. That some behaviors are harder to change than others is not news to anyone, although the basis for differences in malleability has sometimes been a source of contention. For example, recent twin research on the basis of human happiness finds that each individual’s characteristic level, or “set point,” is genetically influenced, whereas fluctuation around that point may be associated with 9\n\nSEGAL ET AL. chance events (Lykken & Tellegen, 1996). Lykken and Tellegen’s suggestion that the failure of isolated joyful experiences to permanently elevate happiness is more comprehensible in light of these data. We need not wander farther than our own doorsteps to know that siblings show considerable variation in intellectual skills and personality traits. Paradoxically, the “same” family environment may be quite different for different children in the same family. In fact, one of the most important behavioral genetic findings in recent years is that nonshared environmental events (i.e., events that individuals experience apart from family members and that are associated with differences among them) have greater influence on most behaviors than shared experiences (Plomin & Daniels, 1987). Siblings may, thus, respond differently to the opportunities and facilities available to them as a partial result of differences in genetically based interests and abilities. Objectively similar treatment by parents does not strongly predict similar developmental outcomes. Individual differences, whether within or between families, are just that-there is nothing inherent in them that warrants value judgements. In the wise words of Theodosius Dobzhansky, “differences are not deficits.” Some have asserted that behavioral-genetic investigations of human behavior are unproductive given the inseparability of genes and environments (Gottlieb, 1995; Lamb, 1994; Oyama, 1989; also see Rowe, 1994; commentaries by Burgess & Molenaar, 1995; Scarr, 1995b; and Turkheimer, Goldsmith, & Gottesman, 1995, in response to Gottleib, 1995). It has also been argued that behavioral-genetic research may lead to misuse and discrimination within and between groups (Baumrind, 1993; Jackson, 1993; also see reply by Scarr, 1993). Again, it is helpful to return to the words of Dobzhansky and to assert that efforts that may assist understanding of the human condition are worth doing. Fear of misuse by a misguided minority should not hinder progress, but should strengthen resolve to ensure appropriate and respectful interpretation. The history of psychology includes many examples of how findings of genetic influence have been truly beneficial. For example, studies on the origins of autism have removed misplaced blame on parental rearing practices and focused attention on characteristics of the child. 10\n\nPURSUING THE BIG PICTURE Objections to evolutionary interpretations of human behavior by developmental psychologists are ably summarized by Smith ( 1987). Many of these same objections still echo through the literature, despite nearly a decade of subsequent investigation; see, for example, a compelling review by Kenrick (1995). Perhaps most disturbing to some researchers is that evolutionary research on human behavior will perpetuate the naturalistic fallacy, the notion that what is natural for the species is necessarily good, thus generating complacency toward, for example, human aggression. As Smith (1987) explained, evolutionary researchers do not dismiss or condone such behaviors. Instead, as with other phenotypes, they try to understand the presence of these behaviors in light of our evolved history-that is, if and how they may have affected human survival and reproduction in the past. Understanding the factors that influence such behaviors may suggest methods for their control. Evolutionary arguments are not incompatible with social explanations, but they can lend another level of analysis to psychological investigations. For example social-learning theory may explain how children learn to be aggressive, yet at the same time, males may be more evolutionarily predisposed toward the acquisition of such behavior (Smith, 1987). Dr. Freedman’s commitment to a holistic view of human development was a driving force throughout his career. It facilitated his pursuit of the “big picture.” THEMES AND ORGANIZATION OF THE VOLUME The present volume is multifaceted and integrative with respect to theory, content area, and methodology. This is a natural outcome of the diverse perspectives and issues that occupied Dr. Freedman throughout his career and continue to engage his colleagues and students. This ripple effect is apparent in the separate contributions, each of which extends a theme, a thread, or a thought raised by Dr. Freedman in chapters 2 and 3. All chapters stand alone, yet each is part of the grander scheme that he called for so often in his writings and lectures. 11\n\nSEGAL ET AL. Content sections were generated by four organizing disciplines: behavioral genetics, human ethology, evolutionary psychology, and culture, all areas in which Dr. Freedman made significant contributions. In particular, his efforts brought points of commonality among these disciplines into sharper focus, and it is this legacy that serves as the central unifying theme of the volume. Its interdisciplinary flavor is reflected by the representation of several individuals in more than one content section and by multiple cross-referencing by contributors. The sequence of the eight content sections mirrors the scholarly path taken by Dr. Freedman, with some exceptions. Chapters 2 and 3 represent the anchor points of his academic career. He first reflects on the influences that shaped his thinking as a young student before confronting various current issues and problems. From the outset, the editors felt it was important to provide a clear sense of Dr. Freedman, both as an individual and as a scholar, to enable full appreciation of his resounding influence on the chapters that follow; these beginning chapters accomplish this goal. Chapter 4 begins with a question: Are genetically based individual differences compatible with species-wide adaptations? In this chapter, J. Michael Bailey explores the interrelatedness of behavioral genetics, human ethology, evolutionary psychology, and culture. It follows Dr. Freedman’s chapters because it pursues discussion of some critical issues raised by Dr. Freedman and other contributors, such as the meaning and measurement of heritability (the proportion of behavioral variation associated with genetic factors), and the nature and implications of gender differences in behavior. The ordering of themes represented by Sections I1 through V generally reflects their entry in the timetable of Dr. Freedman’s career. Section I1 (Genetic Bases of Behavior: Contributions to Psychological Research) documents critical insights into human and nonhuman behavior that have been provided by behavioral-genetic research. In chapter 5, Irving I. Gottesman, H. Hill Goldsmith, and Gregory Carey offer a developmentalgenetic analysis of aggression with reference to twin studies of criminality, juvenile delinquency, antisocial traits, and personality characteristics. John Paul Scott in chapter 6 examines variations in social interactional out12\n\nPURSUING THE BIG PICTURE comes and processes as a function of the genotype of the organism. Specific examples of how twin research designs may be creatively applied in behavioral genetic, ethological, and evolutionary analyses are provided by Nancy L. Segal in chapter 7. Clarifying the processes underlying development was central to Dr. Freedman’s research programs. Section I11 (Biological Approaches to Developmental Issues: Rethinking the Data) brings together new perspectives on phenotypes of current interest. In chapter 8, Robert S. Marvin examines mother-infant attachment and interaction in normal and motor-impaired infants in an ethologically based analysis. Ritch C. Savin-Williams and Lisa M. Diamond compare current viewpoints on the origins of sexual orientation and present new data on attitudes concerning the nature and implications of developmental studies on sexuality in chapter 9. The nature and bases of two complex phenotypes, the alcohol flushing response and blushing, with reference to within- and between-group differences, are considered by Peter H. Wolff in chapter 10. Dr. Freedman’s research projects often took him to different countries and cultures. He frequently emphasized the importance of reconciling laboratory findings with a naturalistic approach. Section IV (Naturalistic Studies of Behavior: How Does a Cross-Cultural Approach Inform Ongoing Research?) reminds us of the human universals and cross-cultural differences in behavior that emerge when we step outside familiar territory. In chapter 11, Nicholas G. Blurton Jones presents a unique analysis of the function of gathering behavior among Hadza children in Africa, with reference to gender differences and the significance of this behavior in other contexts. Paul Ekman in chapter 12 elucidates the variety of messages that facial expressions convey. He attempts to remedy recent confusion over whether facial expressions provide information about emotion or are better considered signals about intentions or motivations. In chapter 13, Robert A. LeVine examines the issue of whether social interaction in infancy constitutes enculturation of the child, and presents new data from African, German, Japanese, and American studies. Carol C. Weisfeld discusses factors related to marital satisfaction, based on surveys of couples in England, Turkey, and the United States, in chapter 14. 13\n\nSEGAL ET AL. The current climate of research activity in evolutionary psychology was anticipated by Dr. Freedman in his seminal books, Human Infancy: An Evolutionary Perspective ( 1972) and Human Sociobiology: A Holistic Approach (1979). Section V (Evolutionary Analyses: New Issues and Continuing Controversies) introduces critical reappraisal of some common human problems in light of evolutionary theorizing. In chapter 15, Robert L. Trivers examines intrapsychic conflict with respect to new information on genomic imprinting (the differential expression of some alleles in offspring depending on whether inheritance of these alleles was from the mother or father) and its implications for genetic relatedness. Jerome H. Barkow in chapter 16 compares diverse approaches to the meaning, assessment, and fostering of human happiness, and suggests that ancestral human environments may offer clues for alleviating distress. The application of ethological and evolutionary perspectives to the problem of identifying the basic human emotions, with special reference to pride and shame, is considered by Glenn E. Weisfeld in chapter 17. The use of film as a technique in observational studies of human and animal behavior was a truly exceptional aspect of Dr. Freedman’s work. More than most other investigators, he capitalized on the power of this method for capturing and portraying the subtleties and intricacies of playfulness and aggressivity in canines, the smile of a blind infant, and the social sensitivities of young children. A special section devoted to the use of film is included at this point in the volume to illustrate a unique data collection procedure for examining hypotheses and questions generated by the preceding discussions. In the introduction to section VI (Film Retrospective: The Method and the Medium), Dr. Freedman addresses the multiple roles served by film in the study of behavior that include teaching, documenting, and entertaining. Eibl-Eibesfeldt (see the Foreword to this volume) wrote that “motion picture film has become the ethologist’s most important means of documentation,” because only film includes all elements of behavior, including what the observer’s bias would have omitted (Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1970, p. 12). Dr. Freedman’s films, in both edited and analyzed versions, have served these purposes well and will continue to do so in the years to come. For many students who have 14\n\nPURSUING THE BIG PICTURE worked with him, it was in the process of filming, watching, coding, and analyzing frames of film that most of what was understood about behavior came to light. Excerpts from several film analyses supplement Dr. Freedman’s insightful overview of this area. This is followed by detailed commentaries in chapter 18 by John Paul Scott, who supervised Dr. Freedman’s research on puppies, and in chapter 19 by Lewis P. Lipsitt, with whom Dr. Freedman has a shared interest in newborn behavior. Section VII (Behavior Genetics, Human Ethology, Evolutionary Psychology, and Culture: Looking to the Future) brings the fields ofbehavioral genetics, human ethology, evolutionary psychology and culture into the present and beyond. In chapters 20 to 22, Susan L. Trumbetta and Irving I. Gottesman, Wolfgang M. Schleidt, and Roger J. R. Levesque, who represent these disciplines, examine issues in marital status, mating behavior, and family violence from the purview of their areas of expertise. Future research directions and goals are outlined. A synthesis of these discussions and an attempt at resolution of controversies is presented by Dr. Freedman in the section conclusion. Section VIII (Final Overview: Uniting Psychology and Biology), the final part of the volume, describes the potential contributions of modern Darwinism to the discipline of psychology. This section is presented by the three editors, all of whom owe a great deal to their teacher for pointing them in the direction of the big picture. REFERENCES Archer, J. (1992).

Freedman have had very pleasurable feelings writing this chapter. It is an opportu- I nity to pay homage to the three persons who most influenced my academic.career: Abe Maslow, Kurt Goldstein, and Gregory Bateson. Each was for me a person to worship, as well as a friend, although I did not hob-nob with Goldstein (already in his latter years) as I did with the other two. Perhaps only in America can a student “hob-nob” with the illustrious and consider such worshiped ones friends. Although each was a committed scientist, all three were spiritual gurus as well as academic guides. That came as much from me as from them; I was of a cohort that sought the spiritual in science, and the commitment of each to his science was so total it bordered on the sacred. Unlike Sir John Eccles, who led two lives (that of an academic and that of a deeply committed Catholic), my gurus were atheists who sought the sacred in their work. As for my own spiritual growth, in recent years I have found more attractive horizons outside academia, largely in East Indian concepts of nonduality, and of course I am not alone in that. Both Maslow and Bateson were both attracted in this direction, but both had made an earlier commit19\n\nDANIEL G. FREEDMAN ment to science. Maslow, in his later years, was to reap the frustration of a half-hearted spiritual commitment by taking for himself the thankless and lonely role of psychologist as prophet, whereas Bateson sought valiantly to cyberneticize God’s territory and to render the sacred scientific. He, too, became “prophetic” in his later years, warning that the world’s inhabitants will either adopt a wiser epistemology or descend deeper into the wilderness. Neither man went softly into the night. By contrast, Goldstein saw himself as a teacher, not as a prophet, perhaps because he was naturally less lofty and, as he said of himself, a “concrete” thinker. He was the most obviously spiritual and probably the most optimistic of the three. In any case I loved each of them, and writing this chapter has been deeply moving. ABRAHAM MASLOW I first met Abe Maslow when I was an undergraduate at the University of California in Berkeley, in the summer of 1948. He had been on leave from Brooklyn College because of an illness and was helping to run a family cooperage (barrel-making and repairing) business near the Bay area. Later, when I knew him better, he complained of rumors of his nervous breakdown-that he was spending the time in California recovering-when in fact he had enjoyed a fine and relaxing 2 years, largely devoted to the family business. However, after reading his biography (Hoffman, 1988) my impression was that this illness was indeed as psychological as it was physical and that it may have been his “dark night of the soul” insofar as it preceded the enormously productive period that followed. I feel fortunate to have met him at this juncture, because he was fully energized and bursting with ideas. For me, Maslow was a heroic figure-one for modern sensibilities. He was tall, elegantly intelligent, aloof, but friendly. When spoken to, he had a distracted way of softly whistling while looking off, obviously reformulating things in that very active theorist’s brain. Although refined and in some ways elitist, he preferred to be called Abe rather than Professor Maslow. He swore, although with the words perfectly pronounced, gos20\n\nMY THREE MENTORS siped about colleagues, but rarely with malice, and he blushed often and easily-which gave him a charming, boyish aspect. Although his Berkeley lectures appeared to be off the cuff, Abe had all the material organized in his mind. Later, when working with him on a paper, I was awed at his ability to compose fully literate pages of text in a simple conversational first draft. (I thought this talent worked against him when his diaries, which were no more than disparate conversations with himself, were published posthumously simply because they read so well.) Abe was formidably intelligent, and as a graduate student of Thorndike at Columbia, he had broken the ceiling on Thorndike’s IQ test, at about the 190 level. He told me that after Thorndike saw these results he was given carte blanche and was thereafter free to pursue whatever he wished. For Abe, IQ was an essential trait, and in his assessment of people it was prominent. We were once together at a lecture given by Margaret Mead, whom he knew, and he lamented that her enormous intelligence was not being applied to deeper issues. He considered intelligence an essential part of a person’s being, like good looks or good health, and he encouraged his students to get tested so that they might better know themselves. In his letters of recommendation for me, for example, he included a rather accurate estimate of my IQ, which usually served to depress me, for one is never sufficiently endowed. My vision about this was Maslow sitting high on Mt. Olympus gazing down at lesser images of himself-again, the elitist motif. In his Berkeley summer school lectures Maslow made frequent reference to the heroism and courage of certain self-actualized individuals in both literature and life. Most memorable for me was Abe’s choice of the architect hero of The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand as a fictional example of someone who was self-actualized. The hero, Howard Rourke, was depicted as a somewhat icy, social isolate, who demonstrated deep moral courage by blowing up a new housing project because the builders had misused his architectural plans. Clearly, Ayn Rand’s point was that by changing the structural beauty of the original plans, the project was doomed to become an ugly slum-for beauty is necessary to bring out the beauty in people, whereas architectural ugliness will induce squalor and meanness.\n\nDANIEL G. FREEDMAN Needless to say, the blowing-up of a new housing project, for any reason, might not play well everywhere, and there were some heated discussions in and out of class. For Abe, however, Rourke demonstrated the traits he extolled: courage in the face of the larger, often corrupt “system.” Another of the examples of a self-actualized person was Albert Einstein. Abe was particularly impressed with the report that on hearing that his wife had died, Einstein was in a conventional sense unmoved, saying only, “Let’s get her buried.” The point was, I believe, that Einstein’s purview included life and death as integral parts of the universe, and that this realization separated him from most of us and placed him among a small group of self-actualizers. Nowadays, with the general influence of Eastern thought in the West, the word enlightened might more readily be used. For Maslow, the self-actualized wore convention as a cloak, to be removed at will; thus, they sometimes appeared insensitive to the more conventional. It now seems to me that they were, in part, incarnations of mythic American film heros such as John Wayne and Gary Cooper (who, in fact, played the role of Howard Rourke in the filmed “Fountainhead”), men who “stood tall” for what they knew to be right, thus exemplifying a particularly potent American-if not universal-archetype. Some of us loved Maslow for breaking away from the rigors of statistical sampling, which had bored us to tears, and for talking about things that were intrinsically interesting-courage, heroism, beauty, wisdom, maturity, unconventionality, and human peak experiences. Abe emboldened me to denigrate the compulsive, number-ridden, experimental psychologists, who could choke on their meaningless data! Needless to say, there was a good deal of controversy in the class, and some of the critics tried to be vicious. Maslow, however, held his own, as when one over-intellectualized student spoke of Professor Maslow’s having said this and that, and didn’t Professor Maslow realize, and so forthto which Maslow replied by asking why he was being addressed as if he were a streetcar. There were no notes and no formal lectures, but subject matter was wide ranging, tilted toward the wisdom of Gestalt psychology and dynamic psychiatry and away from the narrowness of hard science and learning theory. There was Clark Hull’s (e.g., Hull, 1930) laboratory22\n\nMY THREE MENTORS based scientized treatment of memory contrasted with Bartlett’s ( 1932) cross-cultural, naturalistic approach, and it became a somewhat goodnatured morality play in which scientism and reductionism were depicted as dehumanism, always contrasted with dynamic psychology (psychoanalysis), Gestalt psychology, and naturalistic, anthropological observations. Ruth Benedict’s Patterns ofculture ( 1934) exemplified the latter approach, and it was Maslow who first made me aware of it-and a wonderful new world of literature. It was one of those courses in which books, referred to here and there in the lectures, provided me with reading for the next decade. Maslow evinced deep appreciation of psychoanalysis, even as I too was drawn to it, and in general the tilt to our inclinations ran parallel. We were both put off by reductionism (American learning theory), both thrilled by genius and heroism in the arts and sciences, both inclined to find truth in literature as well as science, both biological in orientation and believers in the power of instinct (and the unconscious), and both respectful of Eastern thought. I had found an intellectual and ethnic soulmate, and I was thrilled and awed; he was the genius professor for whom I had been searching. And generous and loving teacher that he was, he was to be my guide for years to come. I had been in the Navy at the end of the war in 1945, and I was in school courtesy of the GI Bill. I had had classes with a number of other “star” psychologists in my 3 years at Berkeley, but Maslow was my sort, and I apparently his. Because I was in my last year as an undergraduate when he came into my life, I proposed-and he accepted-that I go back East and work with him on his research, take graduate courses at the New School for Social Research, and enter a personal psychoanalysis. I find it touching in retrospect-but found it embarrassing at the time-that my parents, thankful that a professor of such stature had undertaken my guidance, sent Abe a crate of California grapefruit in token of their appreciation. To pay for my existence and my analysis I sought a job as an attendant at Brooklyn’s King’s County Hospital, hoping to join the psychiatric facility there, for I had been similarly employed in psychiatric facilities in 23\n\nDANIEL G. FREEDMAN California. I found temporary quarters in Brooklyn, but King’s County was a nightmare largely because I was never transferred to psychiatry. My main memory is of warm, foul-smelling bedpans. I left when I was hired as an attendant at the famous Bellevue Psychiatric Pavilion, the facility serving New York City-where I worked for some 3 years in the most satisfying job I had ever had. I had minimal responsibility and the stimulation of daily contact with various forms of insanity. Like Tennessee Williams, I felt-at the time-most at home with madness. This brings up the issue of my own psychoanalysis and Maslow’s hand in it. Although he gave me some names of potential analysts, his main contribution was a bit of advice that I have since passed on to others. “Since there is plenty of crap that, as a matter of course, will come up in the analysis, don’t go to someone whose own personality will become an issue. Choose someone whose lap you want to sit on and whose cheeks you want to pinch.” That is to say, it is not “transference” if you find your analyst a sonofabitch and he more or less is one. Thus encouraged to follow my own intuition, I found a person who was a fine, warm, deeply moral human being, Paul Zimring, toward whom I always felt a strong affection-and who helped me emerge from my sea of anxiety. I did not know it at the time, but Zimring came from the same politically left background in which I had grown up, and it is clear that we were attuned at several levels I was not aware of at the time. My work with Abe consisted of interviewing women Abe knew and whom he considered both dominant and self-actualizing. It later became clear that this work was directly descended from his dissertation at the University of Wisconsin (loosely supervised by Harry Harlow, who was only 3 years older than Abe) on dominance in a group of monkeys at the Madison Zoo. Abe was Harlow’s first graduate student, and they apparently got on very well. In this work, which resulted in some very original papers (see, e.g., Maslow, 1936), Abe became infatuated with traits related to dominance, and this led eventually to his self-actualizing studies. I must note that he had found dominant young men not nearly as interesting as dominant young women, and I now believe that there are valid reasons for this. My guess is that there is a higher correlation between 24\n\nMY THREE MENTORS female dominance and creative intelligence and that dominant young men tend to be athletes rather than potentially creative scientists or artists. This intuition derives from my own work on dominance hierarchies among children (Freedman, 1980), and I have only now become aware that this work probably had its secret inception with my experiences as Maslow’s apprentice. In general, the potential self-actualizers that I met were highly intelligent people who were rather more striking than average. Only one woman interviewee still stands out in my memory, the wife of Werner Munsterburg, a psychoanalytic anthropologist. She had been a student with Maslow at Brooklyn College, and she struck me as enormously self-confident and strong, despite marriage to an obviously dominant male. She was tall, dark, vivacious, bemused at having been chosen as a possible selfactualizer, and very lucid in everything she said. At the Maslow home in Brooklyn, I ran into another memorable “case” Abe had designated as self-actualized, an uncle of Abe’s. Abe was a full-time psychologist and his daily experiences provided his “laboratory” data. I remember this oldcountry Russian-Jewish gentleman as warm, deeply philosophic, humorous, and a socialist. He endeared himself to me for all time when he compared me with Tolstoy after I had captured a beetle and released it outside the front door. Somewhat later, while in the master’s program at City College of New York, I took a course from the man who had coined the term selfactualization, Kurt Goldstein. Only then did I realize that self-actualization was originally meant to describe a universal process of unfolding, that it was a verb and not an achieved state-a process, not a package. Goldstein, when he found I worked with Maslow, asked in good-natured wonderment, “What is Maslow trying to do?” He was truly befuddled with Maslow’s positing of a self-actualized end state. Although I found Goldstein’s own position entirely convincing, the fact is that Maslow’s concretization and idealization of the concept is what led to its ready use among the young people of my day, myself included. It became a heroic state toward which one might strive, similar to the equally elusive notion of enlightenment. I must emphasize that, despite the differences in emphasis in their 25\n\nDANIEL G. FREEDMAN definitions of self-actualization, Maslow felt deeply beholden to Goldstein, and both he and I agreed that in Holism (as expressed in The Organism; 1939), Goldstein had his hand on the truth-or, at least, on a larger portion of truth than anyone else. (When in China in February 1995, as a guest lecturer at Nankai University in Tianjin, I was astounded and pleased to learn that Maslow was perhaps the most popular psychologist in all of China. My host said, “Today, more young people know Maslow than know Marx.” A translation of Motivation and Personality had been published in 1987, prior to the demonstrations at Tiananmen Square, and it became clear that self-actualization involved a set of ideas the Chinese were hungering for. As one student put it: “In China we have lived by orders from above-and it is time to express our own needs.” Another student, who had been a leader of the democracy movement in Harbin, said that reading Maslow made him feel better than he is, optimistic for the future, and empowered. A professor of social psychology told me that students are demanding to be “taught Maslow” and that he generally obliges, despite some misgivings about the theory. Thus Abe has assumed heroic proportions, and one young woman at my lecture resisted my Goldsteinian version of selfactualization and insisted that Abe himself must have been self-actualized, in the Maslovian sense-that is, she felt he had achieved an exalted state of being. Ironically, in this country hip college students are talking of Buddhist spirituality and enlightenment; there are posters of the Dalai Lama in dormitories; and Maslow is a vaguely familiar name out of the recent past. One naturally wonders if our next intellectual export to China will be an Americanized version of Tibetan spirituality.) I had enrolled in the City College of New York’s master’s program with Maslow’s help and advice and found a star-studded faculty there, many of whom had fled Nazi persecution: In addition to Goldstein’s class, I took courses with Renil Spitz, Katherine Wolf, Ernst Kris, David Beres, Ruth Munroe, Florence Halpern, Gardner Murphy, and Lois Barclay Murphy. I did a term paper for Lois Murphy’s class on child development using data that Maslow supplied on his own daughters, Ann and Ellen. 26\n\nMY THREE MENTORS He had made notes on their development starting immediately after birth, and we were both impressed with the continuity, over time, in their personalities and temperaments. In addition, I administered some simple figure-drawing tests and wrote the paper. Lois Murphy was totally taken by the portrayals, which I disguised as children of a University of Chicago professor. It turned out that she was the child of a rather famous University of Chicago professor (of religion), and as she read the paper she experienced a deep kinship with the girls. That academic exercise led to several lifelong friendships for which I am most grateful: a relationship with Lois and Gardner Murphy (after I received my doctorate, Gardner offered me a position at the Menninger Clinic where he had become the director of research); and relationships with Ann and especially Ellen Maslow, with whom I remain in touch to this day. I eventually learned, via feedback from my own children, that kids probably prefer not serving as guinea pigs for their psychologist parents. After the master’s program at City College I attempted to enter New York University for the PhD, but, as I am fond of saying, failed my Rorschach test. This was part of the entrance requirement, and I believe my proclivity for seeing whole responses on each card-making a Gestalt even where none seems warranted-was something of a warning to Florence Halpern, the talented clinician who was doing the screening. This tendency has been both a blessing (I am constantly looking for the big picture) and a problem (insufficient attention to the detail demanded by, say, grant reviewers). One can perhaps see how someone with such a tendency would take to Abe Maslow and vice versa. In 1953, after spending almost 2 years earning yet another master’s degree at the University of Colorado, where Maslow had assisted my admission with a wonderful letter of recommendation, I applied and was admitted to the newly formed psychology department at Brandeis University, where Maslow was the founding chair. I had not liked the “dustbowl empiricism” of the University of Colorado, where no one admitted to having an unconscious, and I had made no close attachments there with any of the faculty. I was joyous at the prospect of again working with my 27\n\nDANIEL G. FREEDMAN old mentor and guide and can still recall the feeling of elation as the airplane came down in the Boston area. It was my first trip to New England, which was surprisingly lush and green, and I felt very, very lucky. Maslow had envisioned a psychology department for Brandeis modeled on the ideas of Carl Rogers, where an elite group of graduate students would be permitted total freedom to pursue their own interests (even as Thorndike had done for him). This sense of freedom was exhilarating, and the initial dissertations, my own included, were considerably more creative than average. However, the ideal eroded, and the Brandeis University psychology department soon resembled any other, with required courses and examinations. It should also be said that, ironically, although Abe’s international reputation soared, his local effect on graduate students had waned, and the excitement I had experienced at Berkeley was rarely seen. There was instead a disturbing cynicism among the students that I can recall but still cannot explain. The academic highlights in those years ( 1953-1955) were Kurt Goldstein’s seminars. Abe had arranged for Goldstein, who had so influenced him, to be flown to Boston from New York City each week, and for many of us it was like taking a course with an archetype (that of “the wise old man”). Abe’s demise as a teacher is covered rather well in Hoffman’s ( 1988) biography. My stay at Brandeis lasted only 2 years: I had become involved in a pilot project in which we reared and studied a litter of puppies born to the campus mascot, work later recounted in Freedman (1967). Maslow suggested I present the results of the study at the Jackson Laboratories in Bar Harbor, Maine, where I found an enthusiastic audience. The chief of the behavioral division, Dr. John Paul Scott, asked me to do my dissertation there using their large population of dogs-under the joint sponsorship of the Jackson Laboratories and Brandeis University. I gladly accepted and, as it turned out, my professional career was thereby launched (see Scott, chapter 6, this volume). I have, in fact, swerved little from the path set on at Bar Harbor, a career culminating recently (October 1995) in a Festschrift for me at the University of Chicago. My Bar Harbor mentor, Paul Scott, at 87 years of age, was at the Festschrift, and Abe Maslow’s spirit was there as well. He 28\n\nMY THREE MENTORS was present in me and in my students, whether they knew it or not. When my former student, Donald Omark, said to me, “Your ideas will always be with me,” he might as well have been addressing Abe Maslow. I have had other important teachers, but Maslow came into my life at a critical time, and he became part of me. And now that spirit has been passed on to another generation of teachers, and to their students. Teaching, when the timing is right, can be a wonderfully touching business, and then it may permanently affect one’s heart and mind. KURT GOLDSTEIN The most salient of my teachers was Kurt Goldstein. His book, The Organism (1939) became my bible: I often had it with me, and it appeared to radiate truth. As mentioned previously, I came on Goldstein through Abe Maslow, for whom he was also a major influence. When I enrolled in Goldstein’s course at the City College of New York in 1950, he was in his 70s. Vigorous, totally dedicated, and enthusiastic about his message of “holism,” he made each class a celebration-a privilege we 60 or so students shared. What did Goldstein mean by holism? He had been a neurologist at the hospital in Frankfurt that treated the brain-injured in World War I, and later chief of a similar hospital in Berlin. He had become impressed with self-correcting forces of the brain following brain injury, and with observations that neural reorganization and the return of lost function were the rule, rather than the exception. (These near mystical experiences with the inner potential for growth and repair also became the basis for the collateral concept of self-actualization.) The idea expressed by holism grew out of the Gestalt movement in German psychology from whence came the motto, “The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.” This movement had been born in reaction to the deterministic theories prevalent at the turn of the century: For example, Goldstein recounted some of the early neural deterministic beliefs of Sherrington, in which he had hoped that a neural theory of complex behavior might be constructed with simple reflexes as its building blocks (Sherring29\n\nDANIEL G. FREEDMAN ton, 191 1). Nowadays, even physics no longer ties its future to discoveries of more basic particles but views the “whole” as consisting of interacting and interdependent forces (cf. Bohm, 1980). In biology, however, the determinist-holist feud is still alive, as between those who think in terms of “selfish genes” versus the newly revived group selectionists (e.g., Wilson & Sober, 1994). Many of the brain injuries of Goldstein’s patients resulted in unusual behavior, and most of the symptoms were explained by Goldstein in terms of concrete versus abstract behaviors. I recall the example of one patient who could not willfully initiate sexual activity with his wife, but if she placed his penis in her, the automated part of sex would take over. According to Goldstein the inability to summon up conscious desire was due to impairment of the “abstract attitude,” but the “concrete” functions were still intact. Goldstein saw these functions as complementary and refused to make a higher-lower distinction between abstract and concrete, citing himself as an example of a very concrete thinker. This illustrates a most charming aspect of the man-his refusal to judgmentally hierarchize into higher and lower, better or worse; hence, his bafflement at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Another concept of Goldstein’s was the catastrophic reaction. The brain-injured were constantly on the verge of having their apperceived world fall apart, or of experiencing a catastrophic reaction, because of their impaired abstraction. As a result, they led extraordinarily restricted and controlled lives, and in the safety of hospital conditions often did quite well. Their lockers were exceptionally neat-for any disorganization could bring about anxiety. Detecting this need for neatness and order became part of Goldstein’s diagnostic procedure, as in the GoldsteinScheerer tests (1941). For Goldstein, human-ness itself was closely associated with the abstract attitude, and he was fiercely opposed to the then common operation of lobotomy, meant to make tractable violent schizophrenic patients. Goldstein held that the surgery had rendered these patients brain-injured and had permanently robbed them of the human gift of abstraction. Goldstein was not a name dropper, but Albert Einstein was a friend, 30\n\nMY THREE MENTORS and Goldstein told the class of Einstein’s query about whether animal intelligence differs from human intelligence as a matter of degree or kind. The message to us was that even the great Einstein did not understand the distinction between abstract and concrete behavior and that Goldstein had to explain it to him. For Goldstein, the abstract attitude involved anticipation of the future, cognizance of the past, and the ability to act “as if’ something were true. I have always found this definition helpful, particularly when responding to someone asking Einstein’s question. Inasmuch as I had started classes and was simultaneously searching for an analyst, I seriously considered going to Goldstein as a patient. My sense was, however, that theory was too dominant in his being, concrete though he felt he was, and that my innards might be a secondary consideration. In addition, he was not an “analyst” and did not have his patients lie down, and I was geared for the free-association route. He certainly fit the bill otherwise (loving, generous, caring, emotionally present). In retrospect, and having engaged in face-to-face psychotherapy as both therapist and patient, I believe Goldstein would have been a fine therapist for me, although as I have said, I will always be grateful to the analyst I chose. I have been disappointed that Goldstein never received the general acclaim he deserved, but also heartened that certain perceptive students, when introduced to his William James lectures (1951) for example, are struck by the depth and modernity of his thought. His was a message of abiding faith-perhaps not in a biblical God, but certainly in an inner force for healing. I myself tend to thank natural selection for the self-actualizing processes, but the fact is that Goldstein, like his teacher Jacob von Uexkull, was very suspicious of Darwinism! Both asked, how can such beauty of design be achieved by chance? I have always found this questioning to be charming, and loved Goldstein for his deeply felt naivetes. However, it is well known that his friend Einstein also had trouble with the image of God rolling dice, but in his case, somehow, the term “naive” does not seem appropriate. Another, less momentous naivete arose later, in 1954, when Goldstein taught at Brandeis. He thought it improper for Riegelman to run as a Republican candidate for Mayor of New York City, for it 31\n\nDANIEL G. FREEDMAN seemed to him morally amiss for a Jew to vote Republican-let alone run as a Republican. I am sure my father would have agreed. When at City College, I once confronted Goldstein with an experiment done by the famous neurobiologist, Paul Weiss, who had claimed it as evidence against holism (Weiss, 1947). Weiss had surgically removed the hind limbs of a salamander and then reattached them front to back. When confronted by a fire source, the rearranged animal scooted into it and, of course, died. Goldstein’s response was immediate. Weiss, he said, had so drastically changed the nature of the salamander that death was its only alternative. Self-actualization, he added, sometimes requires death. In retrospect, I wish I had gone on to discuss the further implications of his view of self-actualization, for they were here bordering on the mystic, but I was not then prepared to do so. Because I am tracing intellectual ancestry, I will note that I was pleased when I learned that Goldstein and another important influence on my work, Konrad Lorenz, were both close students of Jacob von Uexkull, the great naturalist (see Schiller, 1957) who is considered the grandfather of ethology. Like Goldstein, von Uexkull preferred a sacred explanation of Nature’s wonders rather than a Darwinian one, whereas Lorenz, of course, took the Darwinian route. Goldstein spoke of another interesting connection one day when I mentioned that I was taking a course with Wolfgang Kohler at the New School for Social Research: Kohler, the great Gestalt psychologist who had discovered “insight” learning in chimpanzees, had done so in a laboratory run by Goldstein’s father-in-law on Tenerife Island, off the African coast, where all were interned during World War I. Although such connections feel mysteriously synchronous, they are also simply an accounting of intellectual genealogies. Although I did not know Goldstein as intimately as I knew Maslow, he became the major theoretical force in my thinking, teaching, and research. The essentially aesthetic idea that a scientist, like an architect, needs to start with an image of “the whole,” even while working on the details, has been more than useful-it has become a way of being. It gave me the courage to follow hunches that seemed to fit the bigger picture, and, practically speaking, it helped form the methodology of my dissertation 32\n\nMY THREE MENTORS at the Jackson Laboratory at Bar Harbor, Maine. I have always tried, in my own teaching, to pass that message on, including its respect for creative intuition, but I must say that students most often found this unfolding process a dangerous path. Somewhat like Goldstein’s patients, they often opted for the safety of an assigned topic. Clearly, creativity requires a strong dash of courage, and that, Goldstein would have agreed, is an essentially unteachable organismic property. GREGORY BATESON I was a senior at the University of California at Berkeley when I first encountered Gregory Bateson in 1949. Bateson was a guest lecturer in a general course in cultural anthropology. He showed the class an anticommunist film, Hitlerjunge Quex, made by the Nazis in 1933, which he had analyzed while working for the Office of Strategic Services as part of the war effort. I thought his analysis was brilliant. I came to the podium afterward with a question that, for me, was uppermost in my mind because of Maslow, whose course I had taken the previous summer: What is the healthiest culture thus far studied by anthropologists, and what were its characteristics? Margaret Mead had asked a similar question in her Competition and Cooperation (1937), where she concluded that the Eskimo had the most balanced combination of traits in the title. Bateson, however, had a different sort of answer. “The Balinese,” he said, “are schizoid enough for me.” I thought it a marvelous and eyeopening response, reflecting both who Bateson was (remote, dreamy, deeply aesthetic, always checking with how he really felt about things before answering) and the essential relativity of the question. It was, in retrospect, a “Goldsteinian” rather than “Maslovian” response in that selfactualization was an individual matter and in its spirit beyond human judgment. (The exquisite beauty of the Balinese and Bali was to be revealed to me directly in 1972 when I visited the island with Bateson.) Many years were to pass before I would meet Bateson again. I had completed my dissertation at Bar Harbor and had received a postdoctoral fellowship to work at Mt. Zion Hospital and the Langley Porter Neuropsy33\n\nDANIEL G. FREEDMAN chiatric Institute in San Francisco, California. It was 1958, and I was invited to present my research to Palo Alto’s Mental Research Institute (MRI), where Bateson (along with Don Jackson, Paul Watzlawick, Virginia Satir, and John Weakland) were studying the families of schizophrenics. I presented a film of my findings with four breeds of dogs, raised in two very different ways, and Bateson was clearly impressed with the wonderful complexity of the findings. The study of the dogs was a compelling demonstration of what Gardner and Lois Murphy had earlier noted to me: that heredity and environment were inextricably bound and that untangling them might well result in the loss of the phenomena themselves. (I was later to hear D. T. Suzuki, the Zen scholar, say the same thing when addressing the 1968 International Congress of Neuropsychiatry in Japan: “You have taken heredity and environment apart; now you are stuck with the impossible task of putting them together again.”) In retrospect, I believe Bateson, the Murphys, Suzuki, and I shared the notion that the beautiful mysteries of life must be preserved and saved from scientific dissection. I would, of course, add Goldstein and Maslow to this list of like minds. Later I was to learn that the entire Bateson family-all scientists and naturalists-revered the poet Blake, who said, “a tear is an intellectual thing” and admonished that we not be lulled into “Newton’s sleep” (Lipset, 1980). Over the 4 years that I was in the Bay Area (1958 to 1962) I met with Bateson a number of times and found him to be a guru to the younger psychiatrists in the area. Hosting such groups seemed to constitute his social life, until he settled on a social worker attendee, Lois (Cammack), who became his wife. By 1961, the Scottish Rite money that had helped support his research at the Palo Alto VA Hospital had been terminated, as one reviewing physician gossiped to me, because of Bateson’s “arrogance” in his renewal applications-by which he seemed to mean the dearth of hypotheses, lists of future studies, and accounts of accomplishments. This particular official seemed angry, perhaps in order to gear up for the cutting off of a man so respected in the field. My sense was that in American science, as in business, one must yield tangible products, 34\n\nMY THREE MENTORS preferably on time, and that talk about ideas not tied to any specific intentions was viewed as snobbish elitism. Bateson was already widely known for his notion that schizophrenogenic parents place their children in “double binds” (Bateson, 1972) and, as a consequence, he had become a major figure in psychiatry. He, and the previously mentioned group at MRI, had started investigating family dynamics by actually watching and filming families interact. I have never forgotten a film Gregory showed of his neighbor’s family deciding on a vacation alongside comparable footage of a schizophrenic’s family. The latter group seemed incapable of resolving the question because of their unspoken agendas. By contrast, the neighbors were clear and ultimately decisive. Crucially for me, Bateson pointed out that the neighbors were in the process of divorce but that the family members of the schizophrenic were so totally enmeshed that separations of any sort were unthinkable and certainly unworkable.’ Bateson had become the major theorist of the then fledgling family therapy movement by introducing cybernetic thinking (systems theory). This allowed psychotherapists to break away from the psychoanalytic model of individual treatment and to deal with the family “system” as the unit to be treated. All this notwithstanding, he decided to turn his back on research into schizophrenia (after some 12 years) and, accustomed to the itinerant life, decided to study communication among dolphins in the Virgin Islands with John Lilly, who had extended the invitation. Things had taken a strong turn to the applied and the manipulative as Don Jackson took over MRI and Bateson, who just wanted to understand (verstehen), had an aversion to engineered change, where the fallout was totally unpredictable. Later, during a visit I made to my in-laws in Hawaii, Bateson told me ’ The double-bind theory of schizophrenia-i.e., the view that schizophrenia is caused by particular pattens of pathogenic communication within families, has been virtually abandoned. More recent data from twin and adoption studies demonstrate that living with a schizophrenic family member is unable to explain familial resemblance for this disorder. Current thinking is that social-interactional features of the family may contribute to the onset ofschizophrenia, but only in interaction with a predisposed genotype (Gottesman, 1991).-Eds. 35"
