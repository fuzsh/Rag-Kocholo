        "text": "üí∞ ‚öí üèî BHP‚Äôs bid for Anglo casts cloud over troubled $9b polyhalite mine Another great perspective from The Australian Financial Review. The article is behind a paywall, but I've provided key extracts below, to provide an insight into the troubles with polyhalite. BHP Group proposal for a $US39 billion ($60 billion) takeover of rival Anglo American is all about securing plenty of copper supplies ‚Äî so now, the potential deal is throwing uncertainty over the future for Anglo‚Äôs massive fertiliser mine in England. That‚Äôs largely because BHP is already building its own giant fertiliser project in Canada, called Jansen, to which it‚Äôs already committed more than $US10 billion. With an accelerated expansion planned for Jansen, BHP is unlikely to be interested in also going big on Anglo‚Äôs Woodsmith site. Underscoring the doubt is the fact that the Woodsmith project involves polyhalite, a relatively obscure fertiliser product with unproven demand. The project has a checkered past ‚Äî its previous owner Sirius Minerals rode a wave of retail investor enthusiasm to develop it, only to fail to raise the final piece of financing. But on the fertiliser front, big questions remain over how much demand there will be for polyhalite, currently a niche product. The Woodsmith mine makes the deal ‚Äúvery awkward indeed ‚Äî it‚Äôs the reason why we didn‚Äôt think BHP would get involved with Anglo American,‚Äù said Ben Davis, a mining analyst at Liberum Capital. ‚ÄúBHP clearly doesn‚Äôt think much of it.‚Äù Last year, Anglo took a $US1.7 billion write-down on the project while also unveiling plans to spend almost $US5 billion to bring the mine into production by 2027 ‚Äî taking its total spending on Woodsmith to $US9 billion. MY TAKE: ü§î ‚Ä¢ The Anglo asset Woodsmith is not a tier-1 asset, in a tier-1 mining jurisdiction. This is my polite description. ‚Ä¢ The key \"product\" from Woodsmith is actually NOT potash, but polyhalite, which does include valuable potassium & sulphate. UNLIKE other potash fertilisers, polyhalite also contains calcium & magnesium, which are also plant nutrients, but severely limits the applications for the product, due to lower potassium content & compatibility issues. ‚Ä¢ The Woodsmith mine has been a money pit from the beginning and makes little sense, for the rational market participant. ‚Ä¢ Comparing Woodsmith to BHP's huge Jansen project is embarrassing, particularly given they both have a similar budget. There are some things the Brits are just better than us that call Down Under home. Unfortunately, destroying shareholder capital in ill-fated potash projects happens to be one of those things that we've done really well in Australia, it just so happens the Brits are just that much better than us at it. ü§£ ‚û° If you hear another armchair analyst tell you that BHP is really interested in Woodsmith, once you've managed to contain your laughter, compose yourself, and make a mental note, to never listen to said \"analyst\" again. #mining #potash #fertiliser\n\n64\n\n24 Comments\n\nAt BHP, we recently provided an update on our progress on decarbonisation under our medium- and long-term targets and goals. We‚Äôre on our way to deliver at least a 30% reduction in operational (Scopes 1 & 2 at our operated assets) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by FY30 against our adjusted FY20 baseline. We‚Äôre excited to have the first Caterpillar battery-electric haul truck enroute to our Jimblebar iron ore mine in Western Australia where we will commence trials later this year. If the trials are successful, we‚Äôre targeting the first electric truck fleet adoption by FY28. In terms of performance, we are expecting the battery-electric haul truck to be on par or even superior to an equivalent diesel truck. For Scope 3 steelmaking emissions, more than half of the projects under our steelmaking decarbonisation program have reduction potential of greater than 30% relative to the average GHG emissions intensity of the existing blast furnace process. And we are involved in three key projects to support the feasibility of a pilot electric smelting furnace, a technology which could have deep emissions intensity reduction potential for steelmaking when paired with direct reduced iron ‚Äì around 80% relative to today‚Äôs conventional blast furnace route. And in shipping, we highlighted three key levers to achieve our medium-term goal to support an emissions intensity reduction of 40% in BHP-chartered shipping of our products by CY2030. This includes our collaboration to develop the ammonia supply chain as an alternative future fuel, with the intention to deploy ammonia dual-fueled vessels on our iron ore trade route between Western Australia and China ports before CY2030, if key conditions are achieved.
