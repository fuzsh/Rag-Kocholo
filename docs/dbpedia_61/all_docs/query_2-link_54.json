        "text": "Behrman:\n\nToday is the 3rd of November, 2020. I am chatting over Zoom with Dr. Janice Button-Shafer. Janice, could you maybe start off by just telling me a little bit about your childhood? Where you were born, where you grew up, that sort of thing.\n\nButton-Shafer:\n\nOkay. I was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1931, to parents who came from California. I was the first-born of a set of fraternal twins; my twin sister Judy was the second-born by about ten minutes. We were fair-sized twins, although my mother was a relatively small person, only five-feet-three. By my pre-teenage years, I got to be five-feet-ten-inches tall. And I mention this because it’s a rather major aspect in many of my life experiences. My twin was quite a bit smaller and was very unhappy when she got to be about five-feet-six, as she wanted to be shorter! Judy was very different from me, more feminine [laugh] and mischievous, and really got interested in boys, at least by seventh grade. So I was the big-boned twin and the one who turned into a tomboy. My mother really characterized our personalities when we were just beginning to crawl. Being smaller, Judy could crawl sooner than I; and mother wrote in my baby book, “Janice doesn't cry much now when Judy comes over and pulls her hair and steals her toys.” [laugh]\n\nBehrman:\n\n[laugh]\n\nButton-Shafer:\n\nAnd that relationship persisted. Many years later, at age 38, almost three years after the birth of my daughter (now Caltech space physicist Christina M.S. Cohen), I gave birth to identical twins! (My husband and I were surprised to have identical twins, because fraternal twins tend to run in families, while identical twins do not. There had been three sets of fraternal twins among eleven children in my maternal grandfather’s family.) The birth order mattered for my identical twin sons, as it had for me and my fraternal twin sister. The first-born was bigger; the second one was smaller. And the second one, having had not very much room before birth, tended to be rather mischievous. So over the years, if I've run into identical twins, I have asked about birth order; and I think 65% of the time, roughly, I found that the first-born twin is the bigger one, and the more introspective one, the more serious one. As for my own younger twin, Judy has persisted in her mischievous behavior and her criticism of me all the way up through adulthood and beyond. Judy has become an artist, a very accomplished painter, with no interest in math or science – and little interest in classical music.\n\nMy father was an outstanding student. He and my mother had gotten acquainted during high-school years in southern California, but didn't marry for close to six years, because my dad went east to University of Cincinnati for a five-year cooperative engineering program. He was an outstanding electrical engineering student and was admitted into Tau Beta Pi, the engineering honorary society. My mother stayed in California and went to Pomona College. She was also an outstanding student, a Phi Beta Kappa graduate from Pomona with liberal arts training. Mother was very much a perfectionist, perhaps from her Swedish and German heritage. My father had English and Welsh heritage. After a recurrence of mental illness, first experienced in early years of marriage, my mother took her own life at age 54. This was after my twin had married and was during a period when I was far away in graduate school. (Gloria Steinem wrote an essay about her mother, who suffered a nervous breakdown and had hallucinations while Gloria was still a child. Later she reported that she had had letters from women all over the country, hundreds of women about the same age as Steinem, saying, “I too had a crazy mother.”)\n\nI asked my parents at age four about doing something with music, perhaps taking piano lessons. My father had not only been outstanding in his University of Cincinnati engineering program, but he had also studied voice at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music. He had been the baritone soloist in Verdi operas at the Conservatory, and had studied Schumann and Schubert lieder, as well as arias of Handel and Bach. Dad had this very strong avocational interest in music, and sometimes sang to me and Judy when we were babies. I tended to emulate my father, even at an early age. Judy couldn't sit still very long, so my twin wasn’t ready for anything like piano lessons, not at age four. [laugh] I didn't get to start piano until maybe age seven, when Judy was willing to begin lessons Judy quit the piano lessons after a couple years, but I continued. I was asked by my father to play for him, to accompany his informal singing at home. I had not only a very good piano teacher who moved me ahead rapidly, but I had my father encouraging me to read through piano accompaniments for his voice practice sessions at home. (By this time our family was in the Boston area, as my father had been moved to the home office of the electric motors company (Holtzer Cabot Electric Motors Co.) whose Cincinnati office he had joined just after he finished his University of Cincinnati studies. Dad had an important position in a choir of a downtown Boston church, where a world-famous organist, E. Power Biggs, served as choir director and organist.)\n\nI developed into quite a good sight-reader, and for years, even as a child, I loved to play for singers. But then I realized I was tired of the typical singer’s attitude, “You're the accompanist. You don’t really count.” And I learned that early on from my father: At about age eight or nine, only a year or so after my dad had me start playing for him, we were doing an aria of Handel, “Where’er you walk,” a short, well-loved piece that comes from one of Handel’s operas, Semele. (As they had spent many of their engagement years apart, my parents had some love songs that were special, and often sung for my mother by my dad. This Handel piece was one of them.) I came to love this song and have found others my age who have also loved it. Partway through, there is a four-measure interlude for piano only. My father came back in a measure too early. Exactly one measure too early. I stopped playing and said, “Daddy, you came in too early.” He said, “I don’t care. You're the accompanist, and you follow me.” So ever after, any time I played for a singer, if the singer ran out of breath, or came in too soon, or made other mistakes I would skip in the accompaniment to match the singer. I developed this facility of listening carefully and reacting quickly. (I discovered this capability was also valuable when it came to playing with instrumentalists. I came to prefer doing chamber music with instrumentalists to playing for singers.) Anyway, by my high school years, I was playing for all kinds of instrumentalists—violinists, cellists, and wind-instrument players --as well as singers.\n\nThe place where I grew up was in a Boston suburb, not in Cincinnati. My parents had originally settled in Cincinnati because my dad had been given a position as a sales engineer in a branch of an electric motors company. And in the mid-twenties, if you were an electrical engineer, you went into a career in either the power industry or electric motors. There really wasn’t any electronics industry to speak of. My father was in the motors business, primarily in sales, but also in some design work. His company, the Holtzer Cabot Electric Motors Company moved him from Cincinnati to the home office in Boston when Judy and I were about two years of age. And my parents had quite a struggle trying to clean out everything in their Cincinnati house and keeping us out of the way. What did Judy decide to do? Well, there was a large old upright grand piano that had been my mother’s. It was in a room that had been emptied. We were shut in that room while my parents were finishing the packing for our move to Boston. So Judy said, “Oh, let’s jump up on the keys.” We made a horrific racket, because we would hold from the top of the grand piano, and the two of us twins barely age two jumping up and down on the keys. [laugh] Judy did other things that were sometimes dangerous—pulling a tablecloth and dishes off the dining table or pushing my head through a window.\n\nBehrman:\n\nOh my gosh.\n\nButton-Shafer:\n\nBeing bigger, more serious, I sometimes tried to protect Judy when we were small children, and I would comfort her if my parents punished her or scolded her. Did she appreciate that? Well, not necessarily. [laugh]\n\nBehrman:\n\n[laugh]\n\nButton-Shafer:\n\nBut today we're really good friends. We have the same political views. [laugh] And then we correspond all the time through email or text message. We're both still alive at age 89. Judy’s on Cape Cod, MA, and I’m in Pasadena, CA. And she did go into art (painting with watercolors and oils), but not with intentions of establishing a career. She majored in art at Miami University in Ohio; and for a few years after graduation shared an apartment in New York City with a couple of other Miami alumnae. She worked for a greeting card company but quit when she married a young lawyer.\n\nAs far as my own education was concerned, I loved to learn things from my father, mostly about technical stuff, but also about vocal music. My mother, as already said, was a very gifted person, but she had looked forward to having children, and it was very tough for her not to have any real intellectual challenge – other than typing my father’s technical papers that he often wrote for engineering publications. I had a wonderful childhood. By age eight, I had a slide rule. This [shown in video] is a six-inch slide rule like the one that my father gave me as a child, long before I acquired a 12-inch slide rule as a student at Cornell. (This small slide-rule is actually a replacement Keuffel and Esser slide-rule that I bought around age 37 in Amherst, MA; my baby daughter apparently pulled the original one, the one given me by my dad almost thirty years earlier, out of my purse and buried it in some pile of dirt when husband John and I were looking at a new house being built for a colleague. When we couldn’t find my old 6-in. slide-rule, I was able to buy an identical replacement at a stationery store in Amherst. In those years, the late 1960s, you could still buy K&E slide rules.) Did you ever see a slide rule, when you were younger—?\n\nBehrman:\n\nOh, yes. Yeah.\n\nButton-Shafer:\n\nI tried to talk with student music majors in the 1970s when teaching a class on “the Physics of Music” about how you could compare a piano keyboard with a slide-rule. With a slide-rule, if you want to multiply two times three, you add the corresponding distances, because the scale marked on the slide-rule is logarithmic. I tried to draw an analogy between displacements on a slide-rule with the variation of musical frequency with displacements on the piano keyboard. For example, if you displace a note by an octave on the piano keyboard, the frequency is increased by a factor of two. I said to the students that the frequency dependence on position for the piano is like the variation of the numbers marked on the slide-rule as the displacement is changed. I think one Amherst college student taking music courses at UMass knew what I was talking about, and maybe one or two others; but most of the UMass students had never seen a slide-rule! Not in the 1970s. They kind of disappeared with the development of hand calculators, as well as the desktop electro-mechanical calculators. I'm sure you know that.\n\nBut anyway, this little slide-rule is still a favorite of mine… though I of course had the typical 12-in. slide-rule when I studied engineering and physics as a young adult. (My dad even had a circular slide-rule that he could manipulate with one hand, while carrying on a business conversation. I also have a cylindrical cup – a pencil-holder – given to me by my husband; it has movable rings with markings like the scales on an ordinary linear slide-rule. It is more decorative than useful!)\n\nTo return to my father’s influence when I was a child: What was more fascinating, rather than playing with the slide-rule or with devices for sending Morse code, was that when we went on vacation trips, my dad would tell me things involving arithmetic and even physics. Judy and I would be in the back seat. Mother would be next to my dad, as he always did the driving. When I was about age eight or nine, my father would give me math problems to do in my head while we were on family trips. More importantly, he would tell me about physics! After telling me the speed of sound in air, he would ask me how long a sound would take to travel from one end of a Boston tunnel to the other. As the car went around a curve, he said to me “You feel that force thrusting you to the outside of the— the curve?” No seatbelts in those days, but you could feel a force throwing you against the car door, toward the outside of the curve. Dad explained that the force can be calculated, and it’s equal to your weight (your mass), times the speed squared divided by the radius of the curve. I thought that was fascinating! Force was equal to m times v-squared over r!\n\nAnd then as the drive proceeded—we were going up to New Hampshire from Massachusetts at this point— Dad gestured toward the ocean and said, “You can use mathematics to describe the waves in the ocean.” I didn't think my father, an engineer, could really handle so complex a problem, and he didn't try to give me any mathematics for wave motion, but he explained other things relating to physics. He’d pull out a volume of the Encyclopedia Britannica and read a brief article by Einstein on special relativity. I learned from Dad when I was a child that nothing travels faster than the speed of light. I learned what the speed of light was.\n\nDad also put together a code set for me, by mounting an electrical transformer, a doorbell buzzer, and a little key on a breadboard. With that apparatus, he taught me to send and receive Morse code. I, of course, went on to get a real code set, a Boy Scout code set by saving up my dollar-a-week allowance. (Judy instead often borrowed ahead on her allowance to buy records of popular songs done by “crooners,” much to our dad’s disgust.) My sister decided she really didn't like classical music. She had to be different from me – and our parents.\n\nButton-Shafer:\n\nWhat was my mother doing? Well, she was really a very devoted mother, and got acquainted with our outstanding kindergarten teacher, and other teachers in our small elementary school (in Needham, the Boston suburb where we lived when Judy and I were children) and followed our training. Mother never had a career, but she typed every one of my dad’s papers, technical papers written in his spare time for publication in engineering journals (usually one published by AIEE, the American Institute of Electric Engineers). Very recently, just for fun, with the internet, I decided to search for my engineer father, Charles T. Button. He had died way back in 1982 at the age of 80, but I discovered he had ten patents to his name – patents that dealt with improvements in electric motors! Dad’s relaxation came through music, and eventually he took up golf when he figured he needed a little exercise. I took up golf, too[laugh] everything he did, practically. With my allowance savings, I bought half a set of (full-size) golf clubs and a golf bag (all for $70) in my early teenage years.\n\nDuring the war years, my dad decided to accept an administrative post in a medium-sized electric motors company in Dayton, Ohio, a position as head of a division dealing with aircraft and electrical controls. He left the Holtzer-Cabot Motors company near Boston, where he had advanced to the position of Sales Manager. Dad had gotten fed up with the government war-time control, especially from the Army Ordinance people, who were telling technical industries what they should do. And it was a little scary to live near Boston; because from the early forties on, if you lived close to the coasts, in New England or anywhere else on the East Coast, you had to be afraid there would be German U-boats offshore. And you had blackout every night. You had black—opaque curtains, plastic shades – that you pulled down over the windows. There were air raid wardens. We kids learned how to identify planes. I don’t think we really expected Japanese planes to make it to the East Coast [laugh] but we could identify American planes and maybe a few German-type planes.\n\nTo my sister’s and my distress, and our mother’s disappointment, the whole family moved to Dayton, Ohio in 1944. Judy and I were stunned, because we had already had one year of junior high school in Needham; we had just finished the seventh grade when our family moved to Ohio. school system in the Boston area—especially in Needham [inaudible]—we were living in Needham, not very far from Wellesley—but they were going to more progressive ways of teaching, that were really outstanding. Suddenly, we were thrown back to the last grade, eighth grade, of elementary school, and treated as if we were not very mature students. So that was a bit of a shock. But I think we were all distressed that Ohio was less interesting than the New England states, whether Massachusetts or New Hampshire. But anyway, the experiences I had in Dayton with music and mathematics were wonderful, as far as music was concerned was wonderful.\n\nAfter we settled in Dayton in 1944 my mother contacted a well-regarded piano teacher (a graduate of New York’s Juilliard Conservatory) and a performer on piano and organ). The teacher, Mary Blue Morris, told my mother, “Bring your little girl over to see me in my home” (an hour’s bus-ride across the city). When we arrived, my future teacher was surprised that I towered over her… and had much bigger hands than she did! Although I had excellent coaching from her and played many Beethoven sonatas and other pieces in yearly recitals she held for her students, I persuaded her to let me study the second Hungarian Rhapsody by Franz Liszt – and a year after starting with her, she agreed that I could learn the Liszt E-flat piano concerto (that had been promised me as a future recital piece by my former teacher in Massachusetts). I entered an annual competition for Dayton high school students which offered a chance for instrumentalists to perform a concerto with the Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra. I did not get to perform the Liszt concerto on my first try, but I was selected to perform the Grieg piano concerto the next year, at age 15. As my teacher knew the Cincinnati-based conductor Paul Katz, she arranged a consultation with him before the concert… and I was pleased later to see a very nice review of my performance in the Dayton newspaper. (I still preferred accompanying singers or instrumentalists or playing chamber music with ensembles. I had many opportunities to perform in Dayton high school musical productions and assisted with orchestral and even operatic productions.)\n\nThere were big, big high schools in Ohio, seven of them I think, and a very committed superintendent of schools, Norman S. Park. I was still tremendously interested in mathematics. When Judy and I entered Wilbur Wright High School, I found that ninth-grade algebra wasn’t so exciting, even though we had quite a good teacher, a tall man who also coached basketball (I remembered fondly my seventh-grade math teacher back in Needham, a woman named Miss Colson.). But my real love, besides the physics or engineering ideas I picked up as a child, turned out to be geometry, not algebra. I really benefitted from the teaching of a Mr. Stutz, who taught plane geometry during my sophomore year in Dayton’s Wilbur Wright high school. I also enjoyed my Latin class in my sophomore year. (I placed first in the state in finals for Geometry in the two-stage Ohio State Scholarship Tests, and also placed very high in the Latin preliminary exam.) (Wilbur Wright High School was a large high school in the southeast part of Dayton, not far from Wright Airfield).\n\nMy dad’s job was with the nearby electric motors company, Master Electric, where he was head of aircraft and electrical controls division, an important division for the war effort. I would learn some things from Dad about little, tiny servomechanisms up to big motor generators that these companies, first Holtzer-Cabot and then Master Electric, were producing. For example, for use in an airplane, there’s something called an “inverter” that would take DC voltage from a storage battery and chop it up, so that apparatus on a plane that required alternating current would be operable with an approximation to the usual AC sinusoidal voltage. My dad liked to develop ideas, and he became the president for a while of the Dayton Engineers Club. (Two decades later, when again living in Dayton, Dad got to present an award to Luis Alvarez from the Dayton Engineers Club for Alvarez’ GCA (Ground Controlled Approach for aircraft) radar development. Dad had gotten to know Luis at the time of my 1962 wedding in Berkeley).\n\nWhat my dad really missed in Ohio, though, was the music that he had sung in a Boston church under the direction of organist E. Power Biggs. Biggs, originally from England, was the most outstanding organist in the Boston area, and in fact was known all over the U.S. and Europe for organ performances in many museums and concert halls. The guy who was the lead of the bass or baritone section, with a bigger voice, couldn't read music very well, had to learn it from rote memory and to depend somewhat on my dad. Biggs, on the other hand, had started a career in England as an electrical engineer and switched to music. My dad, with his engineering and music training, had very much enjoyed his relationship with Biggs… and was still remembered by Biggs when I chatted with him after he gave a UC Berkeley organ performance several decades later after Dad had sung in the choir Biggs had directed in Boston.\n\nHappily, I have friends here, in my Pasadena retirement community, who really appreciate classical music; two of them, who happen to have Jewish heritage, sang when young in Christian choirs… in Boston or New York City. We have had some interesting residents in this retirement community. One chap, with presumably German Jewish heritage, said to me when we first got acquainted, “Why is it that Christians have a hard time talking about atheism? It’s not a problem for Jews.” [laugh]\n\nBehrman:\n\n[laugh]\n\nButton-Shafer:\n\nMy closest friend, Elaine Frieden, comes from the Boston area, and came out to Pasadena to be near her daughter after her husband had died following many years as an MIT professor. Elaine educates/entertains me with various jokes, like the following: — Rabbi number one will disagree with rabbi number two, and then along comes the third rabbi; he says, “Oh, you guys are crazy” and he has a completely different interpretation of what’s in the Talmud. I have opportunities to compare Yiddish expressions with German words or phrases that I know.\n\nAnyway, so it’s a fascinating environment here in Pasadena. I didn't see much diversity as a child. I grew up in a WASPish community, in the small town of Needham not far from Boston, a town that was mostly White Anglo-Saxon Protestant. We never saw a Black unless we travelled to communities closer to Boston. There were no Asian people and no Hispanics until long after WWII, and hardly any evidence of the Irish and Italian families that had settled in the Boston area. Beautiful little suburban town, Needham, about three miles from Wellesley. But in school, or even among acquaintances of my family, Judy and I learned little about other cultures.\n\nMy family was a fairly tight-knit quiet family. Mother did a lot of reading and sewing and made beautiful matching dresses for me and Judy from the time we were small children – until Judy, my twin, rebelled at being dressed like me around age twelve! Mother taught me to do embroidery at age four or five and taught both Judy and me some rudimentary things about art and sewing. I was making dresses for myself from Simplicity patterns by age seven or eight. But did I play with dolls? Didn't interest me very much. My sister played house or played with dolls; she got together with a rather mischievous girl across the street and would tell me about trying to break into the father’s liquor cabinet. [laugh] Or they’d hide away from me; I was too serious. [laugh] I’d stay in the house reading or perhaps practicing piano. And then I’d go out to play and find that Judy and her friend were hiding from me. Judy continued her mischievous ways at home and sometimes in school.\n\nI was getting to be five feet ten inches tall by the time I was 12 or 13. (My twin Judy reached a height of five feet, six inches… a height she usually tried to disguise by not standing up straight.) And I was wearing a shoe size of 11. There was one shoe store in Boston where I could get shoes that were reasonable in style for a young girl and fit me. Only one place. [laugh] I have been wearing a size-12 shoe for most of my life (and have had to wear men’s sneakers, skates, or ski boots. When I was about age twelve, my mother took me into Boston to have an X-ray of my head, to see why I kept growing… and found out that I indeed had a large pituitary gland! I haven't shrunk too much with age. I'm down to about five-eight-and-a-half inches, maybe a little over that. But I was five-feet-ten for much of my life. Now there are many tall young women, but they don’t seem to wear big shoe sizes! I still have problems in finding casual shoes in size 12, even in California. My daughter Christina isn’t quite my height. I think she ended up at five-feet-eight-and-a-half inches. She hasn’t had the problem I have had with shoes. Even as a child I knew I was something of a freak. [laugh] And I knew I was happier playing with boys or with things that interested boys.\n\nWhen I was about age ten, I saved my allowance to buy a Boy Scout code set, somewhat fancier than the simple set Dad had constructed for me two years earlier. An older boy down the street, son of a Needham dentist, had a similar code set – able to produce a buzz, a telegraphy signal, or a pulse of light. We contemplated sending coded messages through a wire we might string up on telephone poles… but decided that might not be allowed by the phone company. One of the women, Frieda Stahl, whom I mentioned earlier as a close friend in my senior living complex, was trained in atomic experimental physics; she studied at Hunter College near Columbia University, eventually did doctoral work at California’s Claremont College, and taught for many years at Cal State LA [California State University Los Angeles]. We discovered in swapping stories about our experiences that we had both wanted to have an “erector set” as a present during our childhood years… But as girls, we were never given such things. I think I might have played a little with a wooden Tinker Toy set, and maybe a rather uninteresting chemistry set. I recall I did make, with balsa wood and tissue paper, a few airplanes… planes that had a propeller driven by a wound-up rubber band.\n\n[Note: For my daughter Christina I did a little better: in stopping at a Radio Shack store in Amherst, to buy a booklet that I thought would be useful in explaining semiconductor diodes for a UMass electronics lab, I discovered that the store had little projects meant for kids. I purchased for my pre-teen daughter Christina the necessary electronics component plus a diagram that would let her construct a “lie detector” circuit. I don’t recall that she did much with it!]\n\nAs to my pre-teenage years, I decided I wanted to know more about radio… so used money from my allowance, or from occasional music jobs, to buy a copy of Radio Amateurs Handbook. I started reading some of that when I was getting into my teens. My dad had learned about radio, to some extent, when he was a teenager. I knew Dad had built a simple crystal radio in his teens and even worked as an Electrician at March Field, a rather new airfield in southern California, a year before he went to college. I knew he had done all these things; so why shouldn't I? I had liked playing with boys, usually a few years older than I, because they were interested in the things I was interested in. I never was given an erector set as a child. It was even unusual for a girl to have a chemistry set. And what could you do with a chemistry set, other than make smelly things or perhaps set off a fire? I wasn’t interested in chemistry and I knew that. (I tried to convince my daughter Christina, when she got into high school years, in the early 1980s, to take the physics class in her junior year, before taking chemistry. I recalled that as a small child she was inclined towards picking up mechanical things, such as hand-drills or screwdrivers. In fact, I had predicted when she was age one and a half that she was going to grow up to be an engineer or a physicist. [laugh] When Christina was age 11 or 12, I could interest her in my description of certain experiments I taught students in physics laboratory courses at UMass. She’s the only one of my three kids who indeed went into physics. Her studies have led her into a very productive career in Space Physics, with research at Caltech that started with a postdoctoral appointment there in 1996. (The other two, her twin brothers, studied engineering and computer science.)\n\nMy mother was terribly bored in Dayton, because – though we moved into a very nice house not far from my father’s engineering company, almost none of our neighbors had gone to college, and most of their children appeared interest in studies beyond high school. The Wilbur Wright High School (with a total student body of about 1,000) that my sister and I attended had only about 15% of the kids going on to college. Yet discipline was very strong, stemming from a rather dogmatic principal. We had wonderful teachers, including a blind woman, with a seeing-eye dog, who taught history. Her hearing was very acute. She could tell if students were sharing papers or doing something they shouldn't be doing at the back of the class. But my favorite, of course, was the geometry teacher. Barely my height, I think— a Mr. Stutz. I also had a wonderful Latin teacher, Miss Spencer. The teachers encouraged their students, even though we were in this high school that was not known for producing kids that did wonderful things scholastically, at least not a very high percentage of them. And most of the parents, (and our neighbors, as I have indicated) were not college graduates, making it very lonely for my mother.\n\nWe did have some stimulation, though, from our teachers. And I went through preliminary exams in plane geometry for the whole state, like the New York Board of Regents, though I don’t know if they used it quite the same way. For the Ohio scholarship tests, we were given preliminaries and then the finals. I came out first in the state in plane geometry (but was allowed to take only the final in one subject). So my picture appeared in the paper. A classmate of mine was annoyed that he didn't win. He felt he was pretty good in plane geometry. (He complained about losing to me decades later, when he happened to visit my twin sister!) In other subjects, there were a couple of winners from other high schools in Dayton. And I also was way above the 99th percentile in the Latin preliminary exam, which I got a big kick out of. (Knowledge of Latin helped me, years later, when I was learning German!) I was a good student, as my parents had been.\n\nWhat was my sister doing? She wanted to be popular, to be dating a football player if possible, or at least be friendly with the popular crowd. And I was too tall. (Back in New England, Judy had continued to make fun of me. Dancing school lessons were offered to all students in the seventh grade in our little town of Needham. Mothers sent their daughters and sons, dressed in formals dresses and suits, to dancing class. I thought I looked pretty good in a formal; but it would be the shortest boy in the class who would ask me to dance! That gave my sister lots of opportunities to make fun of me. She would say, “Your friend looked like a little tugboat trying to push the Queen Mary around,” or something like that. And a half century or more later I found that my dad thought I didn’t even know how to dance!)\n\nI had a difficult experience when my dad lost his second wife, an old friend he had married following our mother’s suicide in the mid-1950s. Our first stepmother had died, down in Florida; and I convinced Judy we should go down to cheer up my dad. Dad and some friends were having their weekly party on a Saturday night in Florida, in a “boat-house” near Boynton Beach—and my dad was singing. He was head of the beach club. Though the members didn't go to the beach; they were too frail, in their seventies or eighties. So my sister was there along with me and Dad; she had brought her guitar. She had gone into playing ukulele, and then guitar during high school and college years, and loved popular music and folk songs. Judy had a very pleasant voice and continued casual singing for most of her life. And my dad still had a very good voice. So Judy and Dad did some singing at the party in Boyton Beach, Florida, that celebrated our stepmother’s recent death. Other people did some singing. I didn't try to join in. But then there was dancing. Judy and our dad had fun singing and dancing together. I said to my father, then about 75 years of age, “Dad, aren’t you going to dance with me?” Because he was my idol. I had grown up really admiring my father. My sister had, too, but more for his personality than his technical expertise and knowledge of music. Dad responded to me with “I didn't think you knew how to dance!” Now, men are not inclined to look back. My dad never looked in the past, anyway. He was always looking ahead to the future. He just never remembered he had ever seen me at a formal, I guess.\n\nAnd I had boyfriends, eventually, in college. Yes, they were more serious than any of Judy’s friends. I dated from my freshman year on at Cornell: a fifth-year mechanical engineer, and then a German exchange student, and then a six-foot-five-inch Hungarian physics graduate student, and a few others. I didn't have many boyfriends through my university years (but Dad had met a few of them – briefly); but I had certainly done a lot of dancing with them and probably knew how to do the waltz and other European dances better than most Americans. But just my being tall and rather serious apparently caused my dad to consider me abnormal! He did dance with me at that Florida party, and said I was a very good dancer.\n\nJumping back in time… when Dad was a little over 40, when I was 12 or 13, we were on a family vacation—had gone from Needham, Massachusetts, up to a nice vacation place, in New England, a lake in New Hampshire. We were about to go swimming, or at least my dad was. I was reading something I had bought called Radio Amateur’s Handbook; I had heard of the Westinghouse Science Talent Search, and I thought, “Well, nobody has told me about this at school, but maybe I should get ready for it.” And I knew that my dad had fooled around with radio and learned enough electrical engineering he could even take a position for a year at a Southern California Air Force base, March Field, before he went off to college in Cincinnati. I knew he had done these sorts of things, and I assumed that he must know some things about radio, about radio theory, about oscillators. In reading the Handbook, I ran into the “quality factor” of a resonant circuit, an oscillatory circuit. And Dad had always been helpful in explaining things to me before, but here I was, 12 or 13, approaching five feet ten inches height. (My dad was just a little over six feet, but relatively small-boned otherwise. I took after my mother’s ancestors, I think [laugh], the Swedish and the German ancestors.) I was probably in a bathing suit or lying on the beach and reading in this Radio Amateur’s Handbook, and my sister was out seeing if she could find any interesting boyfriends, I guess. We were there for a couple of weeks. So I said to my dad, “I don’t think I understand this capital Q—quality factor of a circuit. Can you explain it?” He whirled on me—after all, he was about to go in swimming—and he said, “You're abnormal enough already. If you're still interested in this when you get to college, it’ll be soon enough.”\n\nWell, I was already one or two years beyond the point where I had decided I wanted to be an engineer or scientist. I thought that music would be a terrible vocation, and that pianists were a dime a dozen, and you never really saw any women performers. There were very few—I was aware of just one British pianist who was a woman. You didn't see women in string quartets, not back in the thirties, [laugh] the forties, or the fifties. In any event, and besides, the main thing for me was that you don’t reach perfection as a performer. If you're a composer, there’s an intellectual challenge at least; but if you're a performer, you simply try to match what is expected.\n\nI heard in a theater not so long ago, tenor Plácido Domingo in conversation with conductor James Levine during intermission of an opera broadcast from the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Peter Gelb, the manager of the Metropolitan Opera, said to Domingo and to Levine—well, especially Domingo, the lead tenor in whatever opera they had done— “Well, do you ever reach perfection?” and also, “Were you happy with your performance?” [laugh] Domingo laughed, and Levine laughed, and they both agreed that you never reach perfection. Something always goes wrong. You forget a phrase, or you don’t come in on time or your voice doesn't quite perform as it should. So for singers especially, I think, it’s hard to reach perfection. Also, I think if you ask professional instrumentalists whether they're really happy with their careers, very few will say that they reach more than 95% or so of what they like.\n\nBut with physics, with mathematics, you could have—there may be several different ways of approaching a solution, but you know when you've solved a problem. You usually know when you've done the calculation properly, especially if you can compare with some experimental data. There’s a completeness, a perfectionism, that you can reach within the sciences, with calculations, and perhaps a reward. The only problem for me was, would I expect to go more into theory or experiment? And I already was headed towards engineering or experimental physics. Problem in our high schools, of course, was that women didn't used to be offered any kind of challenging practical courses. Administrators had young girls take home economics, where you'd learn how to wire a plug, make a spinach soufflé, or make a dress with use of an old sewing machine. (I could do more elaborate sewing at home, as my mother had a motor-driven Singer machine rather than the simple treadle-driven machines available at school. I found Home Economics very boring, and yet all girl students at about the seventh-grade level had to take the course. I never even thought of challenging the system to ask if I could take Industrial Arts, a subject taught only for boys.) In any event, by age 11 or 12 I knew I was going to be an engineer or a physicist.\n\nI have found through the years that there have been rather few young women oriented towards engineering or physics. (I've hardly encountered any male scientist who really had wanted to be a physicist or an engineer at an early age; but at least a boy is more likely than a girl to be introduced to hardware when young.) I started being interested in women’s achievements in the sciences in my teenage years. I have collected many articles on women, especially in the physical sciences, but also in medicine, and even in the business world. I remember an article that was in the Sunday New York Times—probably long after my college years —that was written by the then-president of Radcliffe College, Matina Horner. And she wrote about “the negative incentive factor” that affected Radcliffe women when they began taking advanced classes with Harvard men. (She herself had gone into psychology, but I think she revealed in this article that she would have gone into chemistry or some area of science, had she not been a woman.) Horner described some Radcliffe undergraduate women who had been getting A’s or A+’s in their courses. They were outstanding students until they got into their junior, senior year, and had classes not with all women, but with men at Harvard. Their grades went down to B’s or C’s. Why? They didn't want to intimidate their male friends. And Horner dubbed that the “negative incentive factor.” I discovered recently that Horner wrote a book about this negative factor that affected women students when they shared classes with men. [Note: Horner is described as “pioneering the concept of fear of success.”]\n\nAttitude towards women and their career aspirations had been changing rapidly by the time my daughter Christina came along and decided to study physics as a university undergraduate. (I think the impact of Title IX on women’s sports and the insistence that women and minorities be considered for open positions – in academia and industry – have helped women to advance in their careers.) Christina has been having a wonderful time in her space-physics studies and her research. She has sometimes cautioned me—if I start in retrospect warning her about the sorts of barriers women professional may encounter. She sometimes lets me know that things haven’t been so difficult for her. But you still find rather few women among faculty in the scientific or technical fields. And the women in engineering have gone from one in 500, the student ratio which I found at Cornell, and there are now many, many more women in engineering… with entering classes of engineering students having gotten almost to 17% women on average for the U.S., and with special recruiting, even to 35% women at Cornell by the early 1990s. (But I should let you ask questions, because I've gotten way off track and jumped [laugh] across several decades.)\n\nAnother article I found years ago, probably in The Atlantic, was written about women studying in different fields in the early seventies by sociologist Alice Rossi. (I came to know her later when she and her husband Peter Rossi joined the faculty at UMass-Amherst. During her career she became president of the American Sociological Association.) Alice Rossi’s article was a very comprehensive article on women aspiring to careers in various fields. She described one woman student at MIT who was studying aeronautical engineering; the mother of this woman told her, “Men won’t marry women who like to tinker with motors.” Rossi went over to the field of economics, at another university; she found a male professor would not grade papers submitted by women graduate students in economics, because he didn't believe that women should be in the field of economics. And I think it was at the same time I read a newspaper article, probably in The New York Times, about a Syracuse University professor of journalism who said, “My best student was a woman, and I thought she would have an outstanding career. But after getting her PhD, she settled down and got married and never did anything.” He was so disappointed in this one woman student he declared he would advise no more women graduate students. Alice Rossi also interviewed some women who were majoring in music. What were they being told to do? They were being turned into teachers. They weren’t being encouraged to be composers or to be performers. Some years later I had a chance to talk to Alice Rossi after she became a professor (as did her husband Peter Rossi) at UMass-Amherst. Incidentally, I found Peter Rossi somewhat less approachable than his wife, and was known to be rather a woman-chaser. [laugh]\n\nI also discovered an anthropologist, Ashley Montagu (then at Rutgers University) from an article he wrote for the Ladies Home Journal (and also a book) about the “natural superiority of women.” He claimed that women survived childhood diseases better than men, and that they behaved more calmly under pressure. Montagu advocated that women be allowed to become astronauts.\n\nSorry. I've gotten off my chronological story. Back in my sophomore year in high school, I was first in the state of Ohio in the two-stage scholarship test for Plane Geometry – “geometry champion,” as described in a Dayton newspaper article. My Latin teacher that year was pleased that I placed above the 99th percentile in the Ohio preliminary scholarship test. And then I also won a contest the same year, at age fifteen, to play a piano concerto with the Dayton Symphony Orchestra. I performed the Grieg A minor piano concerto in an afternoon concert attended by many school children and was pleased to see a nice review of the performance in the Dayton newspaper.\n\nDayton was a city that provided many outstanding music events. Besides the Symphony programs, there were outstanding solo artists in a recital series – well-known performers like the cellist Gregor Piatigorsky and pianist Artur Rubinstein. (Note: I remember from my teens that the old-time pianists, and most other instrumentalists, played beautifully but without all the affectations, without the swaying and the soulful facial expressions that are common among today’s performers.) Rubinstein was a favorite of mine – in recitals or recordings. I had especially liked a quote from Rubinstein, found in an issue of a music magazine (Etude, in early 1940s) given my mother by a Needham, MA, neighbor; Rubinstein said, “I get so tired of having these young pianists come to me and show off what they can do technically. They want to play Liszt’s ‘La Campanella.’” He referred to the Paganini/Liszt piano composition that is technically very difficult. “I’d much rather hear a simple Chopin nocturne.”\n\nMy twin Judy only recently (about age 89!) said that she remembers seeing me, at age 15, when I performed with the Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra, and “I looked really very nice.” (I wore a full-length formal aqua dress made by my mother.) I thought, that is one of the few compliments she has ever paid me! She had been inclined through our young years to treat me as being ugly and awkward. One summer, around age 20, Judy was trying to pick out on our piano the melody for the popular song “Stardust.” She seemed to have forgotten how to read piano music, after taking up clarinet and ukulele. I said, “Hey, Judy, I can play ‘Stardust’ for you.” She said, “I'm not going to listen to you play popular music. That’s like hearing an opera singer trying to sing popular songs.” Judy also had little interest in hearing the classical music pieces, the arias, that our dad asked me to play for him throughout my childhood. So I was surprised some 75 years later that Judy remembered coming to hear me play as soloist with the Dayton Philharmonic. I think there was definitely a newspaper review of my performance (saved by Mother in an old scrapbook),; I recall that it started out “Very lovely in appearance…” [laugh]\n\nMuch later, when I was doing chamber music out in the Berkeley area, there was a newspaper review of a 1959 Berkeley recital I did under sponsorship of the Amphion Foundation with a very outstanding young violinist, the one trained by Naoum Blinder as a possible successor to Isaac Stern. In complimenting me for very capable piano-playing, the reviewer wrote “Cute as a button…” to describe me. Handsome, maybe? But not cute, not at my height! (I guess the reviewer liked my maiden name, Janice Button.) The reviewer went on to say that, if I could do nuclear physics as well as I played the piano, the country was in good hands! (My bio included the fact that I had just gotten my Ph.D. in nuclear physics. I should have known better than to include that information for a music program.)\n\nRegarding appearance, I have long complained that almost every newspaper music reviewer up until fairly recent years -of a woman performer tends to comment on her dress, on her appearance. It’s not just in politics that women have been criticized for dress, or hair-do; it happens in reviews of musicians, too. Men—well, men can wear whatever they want – and seldom receive any criticism or compliments. [laugh] My mother was sometimes worried that I was used by our high school to play for many events, even grabbed out of classes when a high-school freshman or sophomore in Dayton, to play for the seniors to practice commencement exercises I traveled to Columbus, Ohio, during the school-year(s) in Dayton to play for 21 or 22 different soloists for the state music contest that went on for two days. I was useful because I could sight-read easily. During the contest, I played the piano accompaniment for violinists and baritone horn players, cellists, singers, and even a tympanist, all from my Dayton high school. And that sort of music activity, playing for various soloists as well as playing for the high-school orchestra and chorus performances, was where I got my fun, my relaxation.\n\nI have realized over the years, the reason I—without too much practicing [laugh] – have kept up my chamber music (and occasional piano solos) is the challenge as well as the fun of playing. You have to listen to other people. Egos better not show, or you don’t have a very good ensemble. Whether it’s a duo or a trio or a quartet. And the pianist has the advantage anyway, because the pianist usually is more familiar with the literature that involves a piano part. And often the pianist in some ensembles may have to hold the group together, especially if the members are not really professionals. But there’s a warmth and a reward that you get, as every performance will likely be different. And you can do it for fun, just for relaxation, or you can do it for performance – to please an audience. I'm very lucky in the Pasadena area, because there are many people here, professional musicians, who don’t have the jobs that they used to have. They don’t get all the gigs, especially with the pandemic of recent months. They used to be asked to play music for movies. But the movie business has dropped, because directors can send film to another city or perhaps overseas and get the music score recorded much more cheaply. Or they can use electronic music. So I've gotten to know some professional musicians here in the Pasasdena area, and it has been quite rewarding. My sister has continued playing her guitar and singing, even beyond age 80. [laugh] She has sung with small country-music groups on Cape Cod. Anyway, what do you want to know about—oh, going to Cornell.\n\nBehrman:\n\nYes, I was just about to ask, since you brought up Cornell now, how did that happen for you?\n\nButton-Shafer:\n\nI was already so serious and wanting to be an engineer or a physicist, and I didn't know whether you could find a combination. I discovered you could. So probably around age 14 or so—14 going on 15—I began to look for science/technical programs at various universities. There was no internet in those days, of course, but you could go to the library.\n\nOh, and I neglected to say also, my sophomore year in Dayton, besides the mathematics, the geometry Ohio state test, and the performance with orchestra, I also gave a talk at our high school about the atomic bomb. After spending many hours in the Dayton Public Library, finding useful references through science abstracts, I ended up teaching nuclear physics for the Parent-Teacher Association. We students in our sophomore year (1946-47) were given an assignment to do some research and to prepare an outline for a talk in English class, if I remember correctly. I decided to learn about the atomic bomb. I must have spent hours and hours at the Dayton Public Library. You had what was called science abstracts in those days. I ended up with something like 54 references, articles and a few books. I wouldn't know this except that, believe it or not, my twin sister saved the folder I put together; for the cover, I painted a watercolor on some heavy-duty paper, showing one of the tests that were then going on of underwater fission bombs that produced nuclear explosions. These tests in the Pacific were called “Able, Baker, Charlie.” The tests were alarming and produced the typical mushroom cloud. Old ships, some with animals, were put on the surface to determine the effects of the underwater explosions. And some of the islands were really devastated by radioactive fallout as well as the blasts. (You may remember hearing about Bikini Atoll.) But I had many references – over fifty of them - that I found in the Dayton Public Library, as well as an extensive glossary of scientific terms. I had grown up hearing from both my parents about Ernest Orlando Lawrence, the physicist primarily responsible for the development of the “cyclotron” accelerator in Berkeley, CA.\n\nBehrman:\n\nYeah!\n\nButton-Shafer:\n\nErnest Lawrence had grown up in North Dakota, I think, but he was doing physics research at Yale in the early 1930s. And then he moved to the West Coast, to UC Berkeley. He was sitting in the library late one night and came across something that gave him the idea for the cyclotron. It was a linear accelerator by some Danish fellow named Widerøe. Anyway, Lawrence got the basic idea for the cyclotron, of using a magnetic field to cause particles such as protons to move in a circular path and have repeated accelerating forces from alternating voltage applied to fixed electrodes. I had heard of the cyclotron, as a child, from my dad. Knew something about what it was, how it functioned. both my parents knew of E.O. Lawrence as having gotten the Nobel Prize in the late thirties for the development of the cyclotron. And nuclear physics was really over-glorified, after the war years. (You've probably heard this from many people.) There was lots of funding—physicists suddenly became very popular and very important, and the government was really financing them. The big problem was arms control and whether the U.S. could have an Atomic Energy Commission and have things controlled by civilians as opposed to military. I got tremendously interested in arms control, subsequently.\n\nTo return to my talk that I prepared not only for a high-school class, but also for the “Atomic Age Institute” held at Wilbur Wright High School. It was mostly in outline form, but I quoted Philip Morrison (an outstanding nuclear theorist and veteran of Los Alamos, whom I came to know much later as a professor at Cornell) on the concluding page of my outline that I put together. Morrison was quoted in a newsmagazine (probably Time) as saying, “Atomic energy is here to stay, but are we?” I used as a preface for my Atomic Bomb talk a quote from Lise Meitner (the Austrian woman physicist who had to flee Naziism but contributed to fission studies pursued by Otto Hahn in Berlin), saying that it was unfortunate that fission was discovered during wartime, and that she hoped it would be useful in peace-time. [Note: Lise Meitner became my second woman physicist role model.]\n\nMany scientists/historians have felt that she should have been included in the Nobel award around 1946 to chemist Otto Hahn because she was “the intellectual leader of the team.” I think Lise Meitner was asked if she wanted to come from England, where she had finally taken refuge, to—well, she was in Sweden during most of the war years. It was later that she went to England, where she could spend time with her favorite nephew, physicist Otto Frisch. She was given the U.S. Fermi award shortly before her death in England at age 90. You may know the story of Meitner. Came from an outstanding family in Vienna. Her father was a lawyer, I think. And she had loved music. But she went from getting a physics PhD under Ludwig Boltzmann in Vienna, to Berlin in the early 1900s. Max Planck was a leading physicist in Berlin, and Meitner wanted to learn about what Planck had developed, the quantization of radiation Meitner’s research became very important in studies of various unstable isotopes of heavy elements. Albert Einstein, who knew Meitner earlier and eventually came to Berlin for physics research, probably in the 1920s, as “our Madame Curie.” As she and Otto Hahn had become close friends, through their many years of research together in Berlin, Hahn did help her flee, gave her some jewels that had been his mother’s, and helped her escape from Germany, after the Anschluss, after Hitler went into Austria in 1938 and made it part of the German Reich. Meitner had an Austrian passport, which had protected her, until Austria was absorbed into the German Reich. So then she and many, many Jewish people in all fields were then in trouble. She had to flee, and she went out secretly to westward, and was received by some Dutch physicists. But she was really terrified that she was going to be taken off the train before she got over the border to Holland. Made her way to Stockholm and had a very dismal experience. Because she was not really that much of a hardware type. They were beginning to develop accelerators, the cyclotron. And she was more of a table-top experimenter. When I went over to Germany in fall, 1954, after my five-year Engineering Physics training at Cornell, with a Fulbright fellowship I learned more about Lise Meitner, but found she had not been given the recognition she deserved.\n\nBehrman:\n\nJanice, I think we've got an issue with the connection. Can you hear me?\n\nButton-Shafer:\n\n—And looking back, I'm amazed I had the energy in my sophomore year to pursue things like the Ohio State Scholarship Tests in Plane Geometry (and Latin) and to participate in the Dayton orchestra competition, to play as a soloist for and also, to get involved with arms control issues relating to the “atomic bomb.” That was exciting. I was surprised that my twin Judy saved and gave to me, maybe 20 or 30 years ago, the folder I had that showed the bibliography and had an extensive outline, glossary, and bibliography for my talk on the atomic bomb (for Wilbur Wright High School’s student-run “Atomic Age Institute.”). And that gave me some confidence, because I could then learn things for myself about nuclear physics. And my discovery of Lise Meitner was wonderful. She had written an article, maybe just after the war ended, that was called “The Nature of the Atom.” I've tried to find it here in the Pasadena Library. Because you see, almost everything is up north. I still own the house up in the Kensington area, and I brought just a very small proportion of my books down here. But a lot of my papers and mementos; almost everything is up there, including my high school report on the “atomic bomb. But what I really loved was this article from which I learned nuclear physics, as a sophomore. And it was by Lise Meitner, and she started with very elementary things. I got to know the word “isotope,” for example, and all kinds of other things. I learned a lot about binding energy in the nucleus and what happened during the fission process. I guess I was a member of the science club. And again, I got into the newspapers with my—[laugh] it shows me standing in a suit lecturing to parents and teachers during the Atomic Age Institute at our high school. My atomic bomb paper started in English class, where I gave a verbal presentation, turned in the paper and the outline, and then I was asked to present my paper by our high school science club, and my presentation was included in the Atomic Age Institute at Wilbur Wright High School. A Dayton newspaper presented a picture of me, age fifteen, explaining nuclear physics to the parents and students who attended the Institute.\n\nA few months later, in the late summer of 1947, our family moved to East Lansing, Michigan. Dad had decided to accept an invitation to become a vice president of a nearby electric motors company. Judy and I found the East Lansing high school very different from the big Wilbur Wright High School in Dayton. Our new high school had fewer students and rather lax discipline.\n\nIt must have been when we were still in Dayton that I began looking through what science programs were offered at various universities. I discovered that there were only two universities in the entire country that taught Engineering Physics as a combined program, only Cornell and the University of Michigan (in Ann Arbor). I decided I’d go to Cornell. I guess by the time I had figured that out, we were in East Lansing, and I had been over for a visit to University of Michigan. But it was a summer visit, fertilizer all over the lawns [laugh]. I wasn’t impressed. It was too big a place, and too close to home in East Lansing. I thought of it as a state-sponsored school. Yes, it was supposed to be very good, but it was huge! I had played some music over there at U. of Michigan while still in E. Lansing High School, to assist with a summer chorale doing works that included some interesting Brahms, his “Liebeslieder Walzer”. Then I thought, “Well, no, that’s too close to home.” It was only 30-to-40 miles from East Lansing to Ann Arbor. And Cornell, well, we were going on a vacation trip during the summer of 1947. Our parents had decided to drive back from our East Lansing home to New Hampshire for a two-week vacation in the Squam Lake area, where we had spent pre-war vacations when our home was near Boston. We got onto the New York State Throughway. I knew that Cornell University was down at the south end of Lake Cayuga, one of the five Finger Lakes in the middle of New York state. I had asked my parents if we could visit Cornell.\n\nMy parents were willing to make a side trip to visit Cornell, and my sister didn't complain too much. The Cornell campus was impressive, located high on hills that overlooked the south end of Lake Cayuga. Probably just my dad went with me into the physics building, Rockefeller Hall, after we had found a parking place. And although it was summer, we discovered a Professor Grantham—G-R-A-N-T-H-A-M in his office. And he was a Vermont type I think, a New Englander. He was very familiar with what went on in physics instruction for engineers, because he always taught the freshman physics class (lectures, recitations, and labs) for engineers. Cornell had something like 2,000 total engineering students in five different areas of engineering, but Engineering Physics was new. Besides the traditional civil, mechanical, electrical, and chemical engineering programs, this new school of Engineering Physics had been started just two years before our visit. I later learned that the dean of engineering, Hollister, had joined with the chairman of the physics department, Lloyd P. Smith, to establish the new School of Engineering Physics. Lloyd Smith was really a theorist but did applied physics that included a lot of consulting for RCA. In those years, for Cornell and other universities, as an entering student, you were supposed to declare your major, decide on your school, before you got to the university. At Cornell, all of the engineering programs were five years in length. We found Professor Grantham was a sort of grandfatherly type figure by then, probably into his sixties, certainly his late fifties. And he, as I discovered when I entered Cornell, did a marvelous job, with lots of demonstrations for his lectures. He could tell us about the Engineering Physics program. So of course my dad and I wanted to know, “Will you accept an application for the EP program from a woman?” He said, “Oh yes, we just had a woman transfer from Electrical Engineering into Engineering Physics.” Prof. Grantham said she seemed to be doing quite well. (She went to MIT later for her PhD, and I think she then went to RCA. She went into industry; I believe I've lost track of her.) Grantham said yes, by all means I should apply. So that did it. That decided everything. And I applied only to Cornell, only to the School of Engineering Ehysics, and they did accept me. And I found myself in a class of 26 or 27 students, with one other woman—Donna Waetgen. She seemed very bright, but she didn't care to work that hard. And we had 18 hours, six mostly technical courses, every semester.\n\nI should stress that my Engineering Physics classmates and I had a very dedicated class advisor, an experimentalist Paul Harman, a young professor in atomic physics who followed every one of the students in my E.P. class through all five years. He gave us very useful advice about courses, and he also kept track of us after Cornell as we developed careers in various fields of engineering, physics, etc. I always tried to visit with him in his office when back at Cornell for reunions, talks, and visits with my two sons (when they studied at Cornell from 1988 to 1992). Prof. Hartman was very cordial to our daughter Christina, at age 15, when I took her with me for a visit related to Cornell’s attempt to bring more young women in as students in Engineering. Hartman attended an awards ceremony for the class of Mechanical Engineers that included our son Charles in 1992. Not only had Hartman done a wonderful job of teaching my class a fairly advanced engineering-style treatment of advanced mechanics in our second year (1951); but he also guided some of us in an atomic physics spectroscopy experiment in Cornell’s “Advanced Laboratory” course designed for graduate students. I believe that Hartman knew a lot about the origins of the Physical Review journal; publishing began at Cornell University in 1893. He originated and edited periodic issues of a newsletter sent to EP (and AEP) graduates for several decades. I believe Hartman noted the 100th anniversary of the Physical Review in his newsletter to Cornell alumni in 1993.\n\nAs I already mentioned, Engineering Physics students ended up after five years at Cornell with 180 credit hours, almost all of which were math and physics and engineering. I think I had no more than maybe 36 hours—out of the 180 hours, after five years, maybe 36 hours or so of liberal courses, some of which were sort of required, because you had to take English, one psychology or sociology course, and I think history or government. Instead of history, I took a couple of government courses. And then German. German was considered very important, so we had a mandatory six-hour German course during our second year. But professors and instructors in the German Department didn't teach us any grammar. [laugh] We were taught to learn by rote memory, as had been done for soldiers during the war. The rationale for establishing Engineering Physics was the students would be trained to handle engineering problems but understand the underlying physics. Students would be provided with the equivalent of a master’s degree though the degree awarded would be only the Bachelor of Engineering Physics though that changed later: because of protests from aging (mechanical) engineering alumni 40 years later [laugh]; the Dean of Engineering gave us pseudo master’s degree diplomas in the early 1990s. [laugh] “If Janice Button had taken this course in recent decades, she would have gotten a master’s degree in 1954 instead of a bachelor’s degree.”\n\nWhen I entered Cornell Engineering Physics program in 1949, I felt we were treated wonderfully. There was a sort of elitism that they gave up later on by the sixties. The EP students were kept together and were taught by very experienced faculty – and challenged more than other Engineering student. As I mentioned before, my Engineering Physics class had 26 or 27 students, including me and one other woman, Donna. There were two other women freshman engineers, one in electrical engineering, one in mechanical. And that was it. So there were four women, in the entering group of engineering students. In all of five Engineering disciplines, there were four women. The other three all quit at the end of the freshman year. The women who were in electrical and mechanical engineering tended to overwork. They just got fed up, so they switched to Arts and Sciences. That left just me as the only woman in the entire freshman Engineering class of about 500 students. But that was not unusual. If you looked at the higher-level classes, you would find zero or one woman per year in the College of Engineering, where the total of all Engineering students numbered over 2000 from the late 1940s into the 1950s. The one woman who was two years ahead of me in Engineering Physics did finish the five-year program. So Cornell’s College of Engineering had either one or zero women in each undergraduate year, fewer than five women total during the late forties into the fifties.\n\nI became acquainted with my first Black engineering student, through Engineering Physics. He was in the EP class a year ahead of me, and he was an Olympic star! His name was Meredith Gourdine. He came to be called “Flash” because he could do the 100-yard dash in record time, and also was outstanding in the long jump. I believe he had gotten an Olympic medal in the long jump. I think he was quite a good student in Engineering Physics, though not the most outstanding. We had something in common: he was odd; I was odd. We were both loners. [laugh]\n\nAnd you really were kept track of as an Engineering student. You had to come to the lectures. You were in a pre-assigned seat in the freshman physics lectures. There were two different lectures (both given by the Prof. Grantham I had met in my visit to Cornell in summer 1947) for the incoming engineering students, I think 250 per lecture, to take care of the four or five hundred freshman students. So that was for the Mechanics course. And I suddenly found out that high school physics had been really relatively dull. It turned out, in any event, that the Cornell physics for engineers was taught out of a book by a man named Sears. It was actually Sears-Zemanksy, watered down from the original Sears text to exclude calculus. The freshman physics in 1949 had to be done with no calculus, because calculus wasn’t taught in high school. Nobody had had any calculus. We were taking it our freshman year concurrently with physics. So that made it pretty dull to be doing things that didn't involve calculus. But still, it was an exciting course, and it was multidimensional instead of everything being linear the way it was in high school. For example we were learning to calculate what should be the banking angle for a railroad track if a train is supposed to stay on the track as it goes around a curve; you want a “normal” force that balances the weight of the train plus the centrifugal force (which I knew about from my dad at about age eight) to be perpendicular to the track bed. Today textbook authors often describe, instead of the centrifugal, center-fleeing force experienced in the rotating “body” system, the centripetal or center-seeking force, that the track must exert on the train as it goes around a curve. So anyway, by putting together the weight of the train and the centrifugal force, you could figure out - for a certain speed of the train and a certain amount of track curvature, i.e., the radius of the curve—what the track banking angle had to be, so that the resultant force would be normal to the train bed. I thought this was just great fun. We also considered the trajectory of a projectile, a two-dimensional problem: What angle should you use in aiming a gun or cannon in order to maximize the horizontal distance, the range? You could develop an expression for range that was a function of the angle at which a projectile was shot off from rest. You could develop all these relationships for real-life objects in two or three dimensions, whether the objects were at rest or in motion, simply by demanding for static situations that forces and torques be balanced, and for moving objects that Newton’s laws be obeyed. We hadn’t had any two- or three-dimensional problems in high school. Yes, we learned about acceleration due to gravity, but it was just a linear thing. So anyway, freshman physics and also math and engineering courses at Cornell were exciting.\n\nFor most courses all of us Engineering Physics students were assigned to the same classes. It was like having suddenly twenty-plus brothers [laugh] in the various EP classes. I got to take a drafting course, something never offered to girls in high schools. It was called “descriptive geometry.” Despite the elegant title, was taught by sort of a tradesperson, probably not a professor. But we learned some really tricky stuff in drafting, and that was a favorite course of mine. But I really, really loved the shop course that involved machine tools one that we didn't get until our second semester or maybe our sophomore year. And my two friends, the women who were electrical and mechanical engineering students, just for the first year, had already had the shop course; they warned me that -- although the instructors seemed sort of fatherly or grandfatherly -- they liked to see if they could embarrass any woman in the class by emphasizing “male and female parts” even though these were conventional terms in the use of machine tools. But they turned out to be great instructors. The only thing was, I often felt I was shown some favoritism as a woman in shop courses, not only in machine shop (where I was assigned a lathe that was a little easier to use than other lathes), but also in a “casting lab” course (where the rather slight instructor insisted on carrying a green-sand mold across the lab for me, but not for my fellow students). We worked on lathes that didn't have individual motors. They had overhead belt drives. And only one or two of the lathes were easily used for cutting a thread of a certain pitch, through synchronization with the lead screw of the lathe. Milling machines were a little more complicated; one project was to cut teeth on a gear. I found the machine shop class rewarding, even at our scheduled class time starting at 8 AM on Saturday mornings, because I had never seen any of this stuff before. My male classmates at least knew what wood lathes were like, from “industrial arts” classes in high school. Much more dangerous; they go faster, and you hold the tool in your hand [laugh]. But with metal-working machines you have everything sort of locked in place – both the piece being machined and the tool used for the operation.\n\nIn the casting lab mentioned earlier, we learned what the melting point of aluminum was. Each of us students would put a wood pattern into one half of a green sand mold, close the two halves, and then carry the assembled mold across the lab to have pressure applied. Then when the mold had become firm, you opened up the assembly, took out the pattern, and then closed it again. You then poured into the mold the molten aluminum or whatever it was that you wanted to cast. The shop instructor, though shorter and slighter than I, didn't want me to carry this green sand mold. I think I may have protested. Throughout most of my student and professional life, I insisted on doing things myself, because I felt I was strong enough. And this even persisted through many decades of my research career. A slight young physics professor from Yale didn't want me to lift a lead brick at Brookhaven National Laboratory when we were taking apart an extensive lead and copper beam collimator one Sunday afternoon in 1965. Later a Yale graduate student, who had no previous experience at an accelerator laboratory (and apparently no experience with a woman experimentalist!) didn't want me to step up on a stepladder when I needed to retrieve some polyethylene blocks often used to degrade beam energy from inside a focusing magnet upstream of a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber; rather than being concerned about the dangers of liquid hydrogen, he worried that I was stepping up on a ladder to reach the beamline. In my laboratory at my home university, UMass-Amherst, around the mid-1970s, a young graduate student who hadn’t had any background and experience with experiments wanted to help me late one afternoon or early evening. He said, “Oh, Professor Shafer, let me do that for you.” I was replacing oil in a mechanical Welch vacuum pump, a backing pump for a diffusion pump connected to a cryostat housing a spin-polarized target I had designed. I stood back and let the student start removing the dirty oil. He spilled the oil! All over the linoleum floor of the lab. [laugh] And it’s very hard to clean up oil from a pump. So—and this has been the story of my life, that a man often wants to take over a hardware job – even if I explain my training as an engineer. And even though I was usually bigger, or at least taller, than many male colleagues, not just graduate students but also faculty, until perhaps the 1980s sort of felt that they had to take mechanical things out of a woman’s hands. They didn't want her to get in trouble, to hurt herself. I could go on with lots of little stories about that.\n\nBut to go back to Cornell, I really loved the courses, and I especially liked the hardware courses. Cornell graded in percentages, not in letter grades. I got 100% in my freshman physics course, as rounded up from my actual average of over 99% from the recitation quizzes, prelim exams, the final exam, the lab grade, and the homework. For one physics quiz, early in the semester, I messed up on one component in resolving a force for a problem that involved just summing up force components and torques, for something that was in equilibrium, a weight hanging on a cable or something like that. I remember being annoyed with myself over that mistake in a quiz. I was a perfectionist. (I attribute that to my mother’s heritage [laugh], German and Swedish.) Anyway, I was used to getting top grades in pre-university math or science courses. And I don’t know that the Physics Department ever had had a student who got 100% before. Incidentally, if you're a student in the humanities, or the social sciences, no professor is going to give you 100%. You never fall below 75% or so if you do a halfway decent job. But you can fail in a physics or a math course or a science course. Because things can be graded fairly objectively. You can get as high as 100%, but you can also get a grade that’s way below 75%. So I kind of enjoyed the percentage grades given at Cornell till at least the mid-1950s. Cornell changed later to letter grades. But I think I had something between 93 and 94% for my grade average my first semester. I didn't get nearly such high grades in English or in freshman psychology [laugh]as I did in Physics or Math. But with physics, engineering, math, you had to keep up. You really had to do your homework on a regular basis and keep up with new concepts. And that was good.\n\nMy dad had been so methodical he was called “Eight-Hour Charlie” when he was a student at University of Cincinnati. And my parents, mother having had some mental breakdown after getting married but prior to having kids (me and Judy) tended to have insomnia problems, so was very insistent that Judy and I get our needed sleep. And my dad believed in going to bed by 10:30 at night. By the time Judy and I were high school kids, started going off to college, we had had ingrained in us, especially from my mother but also my dad, that it’s best to get eight hours sleep a night. And at Cornell, I found that was certainly worth doing if you wanted to do well on any preliminary exam or final exam in a technical course, or just keep up with the homework, at least for the first few years. [laugh]\n\nBut then I got into many activities. I was taken into a sorority. And I think when my dad heard it, he couldn't believe it. [laugh] And my sister and I happened to join the same sorority. She was in Kappa Kappa Gamma (KKG) at Miami University, in Ohio; and I was invited to join the KKG chapter at Cornell. Most of the Miami Kappas were activities types, from what my sister Judy described. That was her view, anyway; and Judy herself did not care for activities. Spring semester was when the sororities did their “rushing.” The male fraternities had already done their rushing in the fall semester. And I saw my classmates going through some rather unpleasant hazing, being left 40 miles outside of town and having to make their way back on foot [laugh] on a snowy winter night. My closest friend in my EP class had become a pledge of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. And he came into an early Monday morning physics recitation class after having practically no sleep overnight. I said, “Dave, what’s wrong?” He wasn’t so happy about the 8:00 a.m. surprise quiz that we had in our physics class on [laugh] that Monday morning. The sororities weren’t that bad as far as any kind of hazing was concerned. And I decided, what the heck? Why not see if any sorority will ask me to join?\n\nI did become a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma; but fortunately I never lived in the house. The experience of sharing a suite in a nearby house with three Kappas during my second year was enough. I had to take a small room with just a desk and twin bed far from the living room to get much work done! I think the KKG sorority probably wanted me for my grade average. At least that was what I told myself. [laugh] Because I was too tall! And nowhere near as feminine or lively as my twin sister. So I think my being taken into a sorority surprised my parents.\n\nMy dad had been in a fraternity but found his fraternity brothers weren’t serious about their studies at the University of Cincinnati; so he got out of the fraternity. Well, Sigma Chi wanted him back, so he rejoined the fraternity. I think he really enjoyed some of the social life; but it must have been limited both by his studies, and by the fact that he was engaged to my mother, who was about two thousand miles away studying at Pomona College in California!\n\nAt Cornell, classmate Dave Rossin would invite me to parties that were held jointly by his fraternity Zeta Beta Tau (a Jewish fraternity) and Sigma Chi. There were 60 total fraternities on the Cornell campus. Many sponsored house-party weekends that occurred originally three times a year— Couples could just go to a lot of different fraternities and drink and dance throughout the entire weekend. That was really something, especially for the women. Because the men could live in dorms. They could live off campus. They could live in fraternities. Women? No. We had to live in dormitories and be supervised by an older woman with a junior-or senior-level student who was the dormitory president for the Women’s Student Government Association (WSGA). But there was always some older woman available. The women had to be into their dormitories, or sororities if they happened to live in the sorority house, by 10:30 at night. Curfew! Except on Fridays, 12:30. Saturdays, 1:00 a.m.\n\nSo anyway [laugh] it was very different for women, except when they had the fall weekend or the junior week between semesters, or the spring weekend. Then all the limits were off. Why? Because they had alumni and alumnae, usually married couples, who had been at Cornell, and they came to monitor, to supervise. But there was a lot of drinking that went on. Because you could start drinking in New York state by age 18 in those years, and nobody cared whether you were 17 or 18. Eventually it got pushed up to age 21. So Cornell social life was unlike that where my sister was, at Miami University; students there could drink only 3.2 beer—3.2% alcohol—and I think they couldn't get it on campus. [laugh] But anyway, we at Cornell, we could drink all kinds of stuff, —and, since drinking on campus was legal, you really learned how to drink in moderation at nice dinner parties. In my sophomore year I went to these house party weekends with a German exchange student, and we did a combination of, gosh, jitterbugging and the Charleston, I guess.\n\nAnd then my junior year, where did I go? Well, one of the sixty fraternities was Telluride House, and that played a role in my career at Cornell. Because it was men only it was considered a fraternity—but members included graduate students and undergraduates and often hosted outstanding Cornell faculty members as well as scholars from other universities. Telluride had a large music room and library and could provide rooms for short- or long-term visitors – e.g., a British concert pianist, the historian Henry Steele Commager, aerodynamicist Theodore von Karman, and even the entire Hungarian String quartet. Steve Weinberg, the theoretical physicist and Nobel-prize winner, was an undergraduate member of Telluride for a while, until (I believe) he was found to have broken a rule, by taking his girlfriend/fiancée Louise to one of the upper floors of Telluride. (The true story may have been that Steve tired of the many activities and the intellectual stress of Telluride house. — The men students of Telluride ran their own affairs, with money that was provided by the benefactor L.L. Nun, who had owned tellurium mines, and used his money to establish at least two other Telluride university houses, as well as a Telluride junior college in California. They didn't have any watchdog. There was no mother hen, no elderly or middle-aged woman to keep track of the men. They ran their own affairs. I wanted to see a woman’s Telluride established at Cornell (and partly for that reason let myself be drawn into student government positions).\n\nIn my third year at Cornell, I frequently saw a Hungarian friend, Mike Moravcsik, a Telluride member who was a graduate student and studying theoretical physics with Hans Bethe. Mike had escaped Hungary in the late forties and had attended Harvard for his undergraduate studies. His father, a professor of Babylonian history, and other family members could not leave Budapest. It was under the Communist government after the war years. But he did at least have an uncle and a younger brother in the U.S.; I once met the brother, Julius Moravcsik, who studied philosophy at Harvard. Well, Mike was six feet five inches tall. I could wear my heels to Telluride parties or receptions [laugh] and be a little over six feet without feeling uncomfortable And I would go with Mike occasionally to house party weekends at Telluride, until he finally decided, well, he wanted to have a premarital affair, to put it bluntly, and I wasn’t interested. I used to say to myself and have even in recent years said it to other people—it’s hard for a woman who is reasonably attractive but is really focused on a career—hard to find a man who is attractive and interesting, and also supportive of a woman’s career. Mike was interesting. But I wasn’t ready to think about any long-term relationship. I think that wasn’t the only thing that kept me from serious dating. Besides being very busy with my studies, I had gotten into women’s student government; and I was doing a lot of music, as pianist for operettas like “H.M.S. Pinafore” and “Trial by Jury,” plus other stage productions, as well as some chamber music. I don’t know why it is, but scientists love Gilbert and Sullivan. Many physicists and mathematicians may not sing themselves, but they love to listen to Gilbert and Sullivan, it seems to me. Music and square dancing seemed to characterize the physicists’ extracurricular activities at Cornell, both faculty and graduate students.\n\nSo anyway, I dated Mike for quite a while and saw what Telluride House was like. The students had marvelous learning experiences; they had faculty coming to dinner frequently. Faculty guests included an outstanding historian, Mario Einaudi, or a math professor, Mark Kac, who was originally from Poland. Einaudi was the son of one of the former premiers of Italy, and he was the outstanding government professor. In fact, there’s a Mario Einaudi Center within the law school at Cornell. Professor Einaudi taught government and wrote books on Communism in Western Europe. I took an outstanding course from Einaudi, as one of very few electives allowed in the ten-semester (180 credit hours) curriculum of the School of Engineering Physics; that course took place the very semester that Stalin died, in 1953, and Einaudi lectured extensively on the probable future developments in the Soviet Union. Another frequent dinner guest at Telluride was nuclear physicist Philip Morrison; he had participated in the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and had gotten his Ph.D. in 1948 at Chicago, under Enrico Fermi before coming to Cornell. Besides getting to know him through a graduate course I took in electrodynamics, I admired him for his writings in Scientific American and for his efforts on arms control. I learned from my Telluride acquaintances that, no matter what the background was of the 30 or so members of Telluride House, they would often be put on the spot during the dinner meal with a visiting faculty member and expected to engage in discussion. It was sort of a pressure cooker, intellectually. Cornell’s Telluride House still survives. And guess what? It became co-ed! But that was what I wanted for Cornell women, because I got to visit for receptions and parties, and to enjoy discussions and music.\n\nWell, they were entertaining and giving rooms to the Hungarian String Quartet, for example. Quartet members didn't all speak to each other, so they had to have separate rooms! But that was great for my Telluride friend Mike Moravcsik. I don’t know if he even managed to speak much Hungarian with them, but I’m sure he enjoyed their music. And then they had Henry Steele Commager coming out from Columbia University during the McCarthy period. This is when I was a student, the McCarthy era. I was an ex officio member of Cornell’s Student Council because I had become president of the Women’s Student Government Association; along with other Council members, I engaged in writing letters to attempt to save the careers of faculty (at various universities) who were being investigated by Senator McCarthy’s committee and/or the House Unamerican Activities Committee (HUAC). And we really were concerned about McCarthyism. Cornell had a series of campus lectures on the dangers of McCarthyism delivered by Henry Steele Commager (with a reception at Telluride). And you're too young to have lived through that era, but heads of universities were speaking out. That included the president of Harvard. They were condemning McCarthy and telling him to stay away from their universities. Ruined the career of Robert Oppenheimer’s younger brother, Frank Oppenheimer. He and his wife—he was let go from the University of Colorado. But we were writing letters trying to support people we knew of at various other universities. Physics professor Philip Morrison was interrogated, not by McCarthy’s Senate committee, but by the House Unamerican Activities Committee. They came into Cornell, and they interviewed a few faculty who had been members or supporters of the Communist Party because of the original Marxist ideas. I don’t think Robert Oppenheimer ever joined the Communist Party, but he gave money to it. But his brother and his brother’s wife had, and of course Oppenheimer knew many people who were advocates of communism.\n\nBut to return to my experiences at Telluride House, and my friendship with my physicist friend Mike… Telluride had a marvelous library of records. I heard for the first time Poulenc’s double- piano concerto as well as various chamber-music ensembles. They had a resident for a whole year who was a professional pianist from England. Unfortunately he didn't play very often for the people in Telluride, but the House did have a wonderful piano. So I’d go to these house party weekends and often play the piano myself. On one occasion, I thought Mike was giving me a glass of wine. I decided to chug-a-lug it just because I was busy playing some baroque music with Mike’s Telluride friend Joel Cohen. And both Mike and he wrote musical reviews for the Cornell Daily Sun. They were both into that kind of writing. I think Joel was a student in Industrial Labor Relations, the ILR school. I didn't know him really well except when I was at Telluride, and we got to play music. So I chug-a-lugged what turned out to be scotch. It was either scotch or brandy. [laugh]\n\nBehrman:\n\nOh, no. [laugh]\n\nButton-Shafer:\n\nI'm a big person. It didn't faze me that much. But I thought I was a chug-a-lugging a glass of wine. I know I did sober down, because we went to a ball in a great big gym place, Barton Hall. Mike and I were able to dance _ and sober up – to the music of Ray Anthony and his popular band. What would they call it? Ragtime music in those days. I recall a sort of theme-song for that band was “When the Saints Come Marching In.”\n\nBehrman:\n\nYeah, ragtime.\n\nButton-Shafer:\n\nBut the funniest experience was not on a house-party weekend; it was when just some ordinary party was taking place at Telluride. I was dancing with Mike in a big, crowded room. There I was, a little over six feet tall with my two-and- a-half-inch high heels, dancing with my 6-ft-5-inch partner. Suddenly the recorded music switched from a slow dance to the polka, a lively European folk dance. Mike and I thought we knew a little bit about dancing. But there’s a 180-degree turn every few steps as you do the polka. Our heights made us rather conspicuous. We suddenly realized all the other people who were in this fairly large room were backing away to the walls, saying “Look out, here they come.” [laugh]\n\nBehrman:\n\n[laugh]\n\nButton-Shafer:\n\nSo, you know, you can’t hide your height, if you're taller than most of your contemporaries. It probably paid off in the sense that I saw through the years that I was less likely to have other (male) students come and say, “Oh, can I help you with those problems?” or “How are you doing?” when I was working in the physics library, or was busy with an experiment. Steve Weinberg, who was rather a loner (often living off campus as a student), did call me up to discuss some math homework problems a couple of times overnight, when I was locked in my dorm; those were welcome interruptions! There were sophisticated problems assigned weekly by Professor Mark Kac for an advanced mathematical methods course taken by undergraduate and graduate students in Physics and Engineering. Kac encouraged students to work together on homework, and men students would often collaborate in overnight sessions in dormitories or fraternity houses… something not possible for an undergraduate woman. Weinberg was a year behind me as a physics major. He and I finished our programs (mine being the five-year Engineering Physics curriculum) the same year, 1954, but he started a year after I did, along with a bunch of other guys who came from the Bronx High School of Science. And Steve was a little different from some of his high-school contemporaries… less of a rebel, but rather a loner. I became acquainted with Steve not only from advanced physics and mathematics courses, but also because of interactions at Telluride House. I don’t know whether you had occasion to interview him or read any interviews with him. He’s now 88 years of age or so and has remained pretty active in physics. Besides doing particle theory (that won him, with Glashow and Salam, the Nobel Prize in Physics for electroweak unification in 1979), Steve went into gravity—wrote a big, thick tome on gravitation and cosmology, as well as a popular book The First Three Minutes. In the early fifties, Weinberg was already becoming fairly well known at Cornell, but he was a loner, and he tended to live off campus. When I got to know him, from classes and from Telluride House, he was already dating Louise Goldwasser, who was in creative writing at Cornell, and was a superb actress; Louise eventually became a lawyer.\n\nBut Steve called me up at 3:00 AM one morning, when we were both taking this very demanding math course. It was meant to be for graduate students, but it was also taken by undergraduate engineering physics students and most physics majors. But many, many graduate students, electrical engineers who were graduate students in radio astronomy, and people from aeronautical engineering. So it was a huge, huge class. I remember Steve’s calling me up at 3:00 a.m. one morning, to discuss mathematics problems assigned to a large class of Physics and Engineering students. I of course was locked in the dorm during my fourth year but everyone all over campus who was in this sophisticated two-semester mathematics course of Mark Kac tended to stay up all night long to do the weekly problem sets. (I would occasionally meet some of my Engineering Physics classmates for breakfast in the student union, Willard Straight Hall, to compare our problem solutions before going to Prof. Kac’ class. —K-A-C—there’s something called Kac algebra. And I thought he been given the Field prize, which is the mathematician’s equivalent of a Nobel Prize, except that you can’t be over 40 to have an award. No, I was misinformed. I looked up on the internet not very long ago and found he had some other prize. I don’t remember what it was called. It has a name associated with it, but not a famous name like Nobel. But it involved a lot of money. He got his prize—it was almost equivalent to a Nobel Prize—for differential equations, and he was an also an expert in probability theory. Mark Kac worked with Feynman at one point. In fact, there is some mathematics called Kac-Feynman theory. But he was one of the most outstanding, if not the most outstanding professor at Cornell.\n\nAnd he—what was I going to say? Oh, I know. Steve called me up at my dorm room, at 3:00 a.m. one morning— “How are you doing on problem three?” [laugh] Of Kac’s assignment. Because he would give us this weekly problem set, and he would write it on the board. Apparently, they didn't have duplicating machines, even the old mimeograph type of thing, so he would write by hand with chalk, and maybe give us six or eight problems to do every week. He encouraged us to work in groups, because that’s what they did in Poland. Or if you were in Vienna, or you were in Paris, the mathematicians would gather for a bit of wine or lunch, and they’d have tablecloths they could write on. This was carried through in CERN, by the way, if you've heard much about the Center for European Research Nuclear. CERN was really just starting in the late fifties, early sixties. But it became well-known for its cafeteria. And you could drink wine with your meals at the CERN cafeteria. You could also write down your physics or your math problems, either on the tablecloth or perhaps on plastic tabletops. So anyway, to go back to Cornell’s Mark Kac, he encouraged cooperation, and that’s the way a lot of ideas were developed, especially in various European cafes or coffee houses. Years later, my husband, who studied “pure mathematics” rather than the “applied” math used by physicists, informed me there was a group of mathematicians who called themselves the Bourbaki (after the mathaematician who started the group). They gathered in Paris and worked individually and collectively on mathematics problems in the early-to-mid 1900s and published many papers under the name Bourbaki. — Have you heard of that? I found that remarkable, as most mathematicians I have known in the U.S. have tended to be introverts.\n\nBehrman:\n\nMmhmm!\n\nButton-Shafer:\n\nAnd they published under that name, and it was a bunch of different set of mathematicians. I don’t remember whether it was supposedly in Paris that this was developed? Or maybe in Vienna.\n\nBehrman:\n\nGo"
