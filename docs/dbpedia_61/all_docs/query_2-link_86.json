        "text": "Summary\n\nNon-communicable diseases (NCD) constitute one of the highest burdens of disease globally and are associated with inflammatory responses in target organs. There is increasing evidence of significant human exposure to micro- and nanoplastics (MnPs). This review of environmental MnP exposure and health impacts indicates that MnP particles, directly and indirectly through their leachates, may exacerbate inflammation. Meanwhile, persistent inflammation associated with NCDs in gastrointestinal and respiratory systems potentially increases MnP uptake, thus influencing MnP access to distal organs. Consequently, a future increase in MnP exposure potentially augments the risk and severity of NCDs. There is a critical need for an integrated one-health approach to human health and environmental research for assessing the drivers of human MnP exposure and their bidirectional links with NCDs. Assessing these risks requires interdisciplinary efforts to identify and link drivers of environmental MnP exposure and organismal uptake to studies of impacted disease mechanisms and health outcomes.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nKeywords\n\nmicroplastic\n\nadditives\n\nexposure\n\nparticle\n\ninflammatory\n\ninflammation\n\nglobal health\n\nIntroduction: Risks of environmental MnP exposure and uptake\n\nThe incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is increasing globally.\n\n1\n\nBennett J.E.\n\nStevens G.A.\n\nMathers C.D.\n\nBonita R.\n\nRehm J.\n\nKruk M.E.\n\nRiley L.M.\n\nDain K.\n\nKengne A.P.\n\nChalkidou K.\n\net al.\n\nNCD Countdown 2030: worldwide trends in non-communicable disease mortality and progress towards Sustainable Development Goal target 3.4.\n\nThe four main types of NCDs (i.e., cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and stroke, cancers, diabetes, and chronic lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] and asthma) are collectively responsible for ∼71% of all global deaths annually,\n\n1\n\nBennett J.E.\n\nStevens G.A.\n\nMathers C.D.\n\nBonita R.\n\nRehm J.\n\nKruk M.E.\n\nRiley L.M.\n\nDain K.\n\nKengne A.P.\n\nChalkidou K.\n\net al.\n\nNCD Countdown 2030: worldwide trends in non-communicable disease mortality and progress towards Sustainable Development Goal target 3.4.\n\n,\n\n2\n\nVermeulen R.\n\nSchymanski E.L.\n\nBarabási A.-L.\n\nMiller G.W.\n\nThe exposome and health: Where chemistry meets biology.\n\nwith a predicted economic impact of >$30 trillion over the next two decades.\n\n3\n\nRao S.S.\n\nSingh R.B.\n\nTakahashi T.\n\nJuneja L.R.\n\nFedacko J.\n\nShewale A.R.\n\nEconomic Burden of Noncommunicable Diseases and Economic Cost of Functional Foods for Prevention.\n\nThe global NCD burden, which quantifies health losses through both disability and mortality from NCDs and associated risks and costs to the health system, is known to be amplified by environmental pollution, compounding public health consequences.\n\n2\n\nVermeulen R.\n\nSchymanski E.L.\n\nBarabási A.-L.\n\nMiller G.W.\n\nThe exposome and health: Where chemistry meets biology.\n\n,\n\n4\n\nPrüss-Ustün A.\n\nDeventer E. van\n\nMudu P.\n\nCampbell-Lendrum D.\n\nVickers C.\n\nIvanov I.\n\nForastiere F.\n\nGumy S.\n\nDora C.\n\nAdair-Rohani H.\n\net al.\n\nEnvironmental risks and non-communicable diseases.\n\nGlobal trends of environmental pollution show that micro- (≤5 mm) and nanoplastic (MnP; ≤1 μm) particles are now ubiquitous and found throughout the environment.\n\n5\n\nPrata J.C.\n\nda Costa J.P.\n\nLopes I.\n\nDuarte A.C.\n\nRocha-Santos T.\n\nEnvironmental exposure to microplastics: An overview on possible human health effects.\n\nDespite the growing evidence of the widespread environmental prevalence of MnPs, the health risks associated with MnP exposure are still uncertain.\n\n6\n\nBackhaus T.\n\nWagner M.\n\nMicroplastics in the Environment: Much Ado about Nothing?

With this review, we want to draw attention to the potential reciprocal interactions between MnPs and NCDs. Based on the existing evidence, we hypothesize that the physical nature of MnPs and their chemical leachates impact the prevalence and severity of numerous NCDs by creating an internalized particle burden, potentially overwhelming antioxidant responses, and exacerbating existing low-level inflammatory responses in proximal and distal organs. Meanwhile, existing NCDs may enhance the uptake of MnPs, impacting individuals with pre-existing gastrointestinal (GI) or respiratory conditions through “leaky” epithelial barriers.\n\n23\n\nCapaldo

For instance, polystyrene particles of 1 and 4 μm have been found to be effectively taken up by a Caco-2 monoculture and Caco-2 co-culture models with microfold cells (Peyer’s patches), while very low numbers of 10 μm particles were internalized in cell barrier models.\n\n95\n\nStock V.\n\nBöhmert L.\n\nLisicki E.\n\nBlock R.\n\nCara-Carmona J.\n\nPack L.K.\n\nSelb R.\n\nLichtenstein D.\n\nVoss L.\n\nHenderson C.J.\n\net al.\n\nUptake and effects of orally ingested polystyrene microplastic particles in vitro and in vivo.\n\nThe assessment of hazards and risks arising from MnP exposure is hampered by the limitations of currently available analytical methods deployed for detecting, identifying, and quantifying the presence of MnPs in biological tissue to establish exposure-effect responses (dose-response functions). Importantly, MnP particle sizes that have been found to cause harm (predominantly in controlled laboratory studies at non-environmentally relevant concentrations) are usually different (smaller) than MnP size ranges usually targeted in current analyses of samples recovered from soil, water, food, air, or the built environment. Nanoplastics in particular are inherently difficult to analyze in, or extract from, environmental matrices, resulting in a severely limited database on nanoplastic exposure. Microplastic particles are generally comfortably analyzed down to 10–20 μm sizes (by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy/Raman spectroscopy/fluorescence microscopy). However, analysis of sub-10 μm particles, the range considered of most concern for human health, is more challenging and resource intensive and therefore has not been widely considered in environmental exposure studies to date.\n\nPotential MnP influences on NCD prevalence and severity\n\nMnP exposure can cause physiological responses, such as chronic low-level inflammation, that are similar to the symptoms of many NCDs.\n\n26\n\nLi B.\n\nDing Y.\n\nCheng X.\n\nSheng D.\n\nXu Z.\n\nRong Q.\n\nWu Y.\n\nZhao H.\n\nJi X.\n\nZhang Y.\n\nPolyethylene microplastics affect the distribution of gut microbiota and inflammation development in mice.\n\n,\n\n96\n\nZhu X.\n\nWang C.\n\nDuan X.\n\nLiang B.\n\nGenbo Xu E.\n\nHuang Z.\n\nMicro- and nanoplastics: a new cardiovascular risk factor?.\n\n,\n\n97\n\nLi Y.\n\nTao L.\n\nWang Q.\n\nWang F.\n\nLi G.\n\nSong M.\n\nPotential Health Impact of Microplastics: A Review of Environmental Distribution, Human Exposure, and Toxic Effects.\n\nWe hypothesize that this may lead to the enhanced prevalence and severity of these NCDs.\n\n98\n\nAnanthakrishnan A.N.\n\nBernstein C.N.\n\nIliopoulos D.\n\nMacpherson A.\n\nNeurath M.F.\n\nAli R.A.R.\n\nVavricka S.R.\n\nFiocchi C.\n\nEnvironmental triggers in IBD: A review of progress and evidence.\n\nInitial evidence supports the hypothesis that inflammatory responses to MnPs may exacerbate or trigger flareups of existing NCDs related to the GI tract\n\n98\n\nAnanthakrishnan A.N.\n\nBernstein C.N.\n\nIliopoulos D.\n\nMacpherson A.\n\nNeurath M.F.\n\nAli R.A.R.\n\nVavricka S.R.\n\nFiocchi C.\n\nEnvironmental triggers in IBD: A review of progress and evidence.\n\n,\n\n99\n\nShi C.\n\nHan X.\n\nGuo W.\n\nWu Q.\n\nYang X.\n\nWang Y.\n\nTang G.\n\nWang S.\n\nWang Z.\n\nLiu Y.\n\net al.\n\nDisturbed Gut-Liver axis indicating oral exposure to polystyrene microplastic potentially increases the risk of insulin resistance.\n\nand cause potential cardiac toxicity, inducing problems such as hemolysis, thrombosis, blood coagulation, and vascular endothelial damage (various organisms, including human; Figure 3).\n\n92\n\nLett Z.\n\nHall A.\n\nSkidmore S.\n\nAlves N.J.\n\nEnvironmental microplastic and nanoplastic: Exposure routes and effects on coagulation and the cardiovascular system.\n\n,\n\n96\n\nZhu X.\n\nWang C.\n\nDuan X.\n\nLiang B.\n\nGenbo Xu E.\n\nHuang Z.\n\nMicro- and nanoplastics: a new cardiovascular risk factor?.\n\nIn the GI tract, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-induced inflammation has been observed in response to polystyrene MnP exposure (zebrafish),\n\n100\n\nYang H.\n\nLai H.\n\nHuang J.\n\nSun L.\n\nMennigen J.A.\n\nWang Q.\n\nLiu Y.\n\nJin Y.\n\nTu W.\n\nPolystyrene microplastics decrease F–53B bioaccumulation but induce inflammatory stress in larval zebrafish.\n\ncausing effects similar to inflammatory NCDs such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.\n\n101\n\nJia W.\n\nFeng J.\n\nSignaling Pathways Associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

Detailed mechanistic investigations of respiratory impacts caused by MnP exposure are still sparse, although evidence is emerging to support the hypothesis that inhalation of MnPs can affect respiratory NCDs (Figures 2B and 2C). Despite the existing knowledge gaps, the use of the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework and knowledge base (AOPwiki) is helping to connect the dots from particle (including MnP) exposure to the induction of adverse effects via oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. For instance, AOP173 suggests that exposure to persistent particles (such as MnPs) may trigger lung fibrosis, a dysregulated or exaggerated tissue repair process denoted by the presence of scar tissue in the localized alveolar capillary region of the lung where gas exchange occurs, which occurs as a result of non-resolving inflammation and ensuing tissue injury.\n\n110\n\nVietti G.\n\nLison D.\n\nvan den Brule S.\n\nMechanisms of lung fibrosis induced by carbon nanotubes: towards an Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP).\n\nA draft AOP linking MnP exposure through oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis (cell death) to increased cancer (AOP505) was proposed by Jeong and Choi.\n\n111\n\nJeong J.\n\nChoi J.\n\nDevelopment of AOP relevant to microplastics based on toxicity mechanisms of chemical additives using ToxCast™ and deep learning models combined approach.\n\nAdditionally, there is strong evidence of pollution from airborne combustion particulates affecting asthma, COPD, ischemic heart disease, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.\n\n112\n\nKelly F.J.\n\nFussell J.C.\n\nToxicity of airborne particles — established evidence , knowledge gaps and emerging areas of importance.

NCDs present significant inflammation of epithelial membranes, resulting in tight junction dysregulation and increased membrane porosity, potentially allowing greater uptake of MnPs via paracellular transport and subsequent translocation of MnPs throughout the cardiovascular system and to other organs, inducing inflammatory responses in organs that were previously unaffected by the respective NCDs (Figure 3).

In addition to MnP impacts at the initial exposure sites, it is also necessary to consider the increased MnP uptake and associated enhanced (distal) inflammatory responses when NCD conditions pre-exist.\n\nRecommendations: A one-health approach for characterizing MnP health risks\n\nAddressing the knowledge gaps regarding the impacts of MnPs on human health outlined in this review will require the adoption of a one-health approach\n\n148\n\nPrata J.C.\n\nda Costa J.P.\n\nLopes I.\n\nAndrady A.L.\n\nDuarte A.C.\n\nRocha-Santos T.\n\nA One Health perspective of the impacts of microplastics on animal, human and environmental health.\n\nintegrating transdisciplinary research including ecology, chemistry, engineering, biology, epidemiology, sociology, economy, and others. This includes a better understanding of the transport and fate of MnPs from environmental pollution sources to the human body while also understanding how health is impacted (microbiome, inflammatory reactions, enzyme modulation, drug resistance, etc.) by both particles and leachates. It is essential to improve the empirical evidence of MnPs dose-response effects and the transport mechanisms that control particle and leachate concentrations in human tissue, including particle size fractionation by the different biological barriers (Figure 2E) and its impacts on total MnP particle numbers, mass, and leaching potential. These pressing research gaps can be addressed by epidemiological studies linking a range of different exposure levels to potential outcomes (e.g., through matched case-control studies), tissue analysis studies to define exposure and link to disease outcomes, clinical studies to assess exposure and penetrance of MnPs into healthy vs. inflamed tissues, and mechanisms leading from MnP exposure to disease (adverse) outcomes.\n\n97\n\nLi Y.\n\nTao L.\n\nWang Q.\n\nWang F.\n\nLi G.\n\nSong M.\n\nPotential Health Impact of Microplastics: A Review of Environmental Distribution, Human Exposure, and Toxic Effects.\n\n,\n\n149\n\nAli N.\n\nKatsouli J.\n\nMarczylo E.L.\n\nGant T.W.\n\nWright S.\n\nBernardino de la Serna J.\n\nThe potential impacts of micro-and-nano plastics on various organ systems in humans.\n\nThis, however, requires addressing the lack of appropriate standardized methods for quantifying and characterizing MnPs first, before useful epidemiological studies can even be conducted. While datasets from MnP human biomonitoring studies are still limited at present, similarities between MnPs and other particulate matter (e.g., anthropogenic air pollution particles) and engineered nanomaterials, for which more extensive evidence of particle biodistributions, biokinetics, and translocation across biological barriers exists,\n\n150\n\nQi Y.\n\nWei S.\n\nXin T.\n\nHuang C.\n\nPu Y.\n\nMa J.\n\nZhang C.\n\nLiu Y.\n\nLynch I.\n\nLiu S.\n\nPassage of exogeneous fine particles from the lung into the brain in humans and animals.\n\nprovide confidence that most plastic types have the potential for internalization following exposure via food or air.\n\nAfter determining whether exposure to MnPs poses a health risk, it will be essential to establish the influence of socio-economic factors (diet, risk exposure, leisure activities, capacity to use alternative products, etc.). MnP uptake, leaching potential, and impact on NCDs are dependent on environmental exposures as well as biological and lifestyle factors (Figure 1). Systematic investigation of environmental and behavioral controls of MnP exposures linked to adverse health effects is required to fully establish the drivers of health-relevant uptake pathways. It will be crucial, therefore, to understand how other factors such as lifestyle (e.g., diet, dependence on bottled water as main source, smoking) and place of living may determine the severity of MnP dosage, while other biological factors (e.g., age, disease state) are likely to affect an individual’s susceptibility to MnP exposure. Exposure to MnPs can also be affected by regional variabilities (e.g., highly populated vs. remote areas, regional disease prevalence, and risk factors).\n\nMaking all these connections can be achieved through (1) improving the capacity for MnP and leachate detection in organisms and their environment, (2) mechanistically investigating MnP fate in organisms (including degradation and additive leaching), and (3) advancing functional studies of MnP impacts using realistic concentrations based on measured exposures. Epidemiological studies are also required to enable the modeling of exposure to MnPs and their contribution to the burden of diseases globally, in order to drive innovation in intervention development and large-scale action to improve health equity globally.\n\nImproving MnP environmental detection capacity to advance understanding of MnP exposure and fate in humans\n\nDetection of MnPs in air, food, drink, and other pathways into the human body is limited by current analytical technologies as well as the lack of validated and standardized sampling, extraction protocols, and characterization methodologies.

This becomes particularly important given the current limitations of remediation options. It is now widely acknowledged that MnP pollution needs to be addressed at the source, thereby preventing further emissions, as clean-up and remediation options are limited, and the global dispersion of MnPs that has already happened will remain a cause of concern for centuries to come even if we could “close the tap” of MnPs escaping into the environment right now.\n\nBased on our review, we identified persisting knowledge gaps and propose a strategy for a systematic investigation of MnP impacts on NCD prevalence and severity that is urgently required to progress global efforts toward the UN Sustainable Development Goal (https://sdgs.un.org/goals) Target 3.4: to reduce premature mortality from NCDs through prevention and treatment by 2030. This need is particularly critical in low- and low-middle-income countries where NCD prevalence is rising and plastic pollution levels and exposures are high. MnPs are adding to the health risks arising from general particulate exposure and critically extend those exposures and risks into indoor spaces.\n\nThe existing evidence summarized in our review suggests that there is more than a hypothetical relationship between MnPs and NCDs, which will be crucial to unravel for assessing current and future health risks.

While our hypothesis is built on evidence suggesting links between MnP exposure and NCDs, it is likely to apply similarly to infectious diseases that elicit inflammatory responses, and explicit links with other diseases need to be urgently explored.

By investigating these relationships further, we will be able to understand how they influence exposure and susceptibility and design meaningful recommendations to reduce the health risk associated with MnPs beyond the direct intakes (i.e., from inhalation and food). Therefore, we advocate for adopting a one-health approach that builds on increased collaboration between all scientists, but especially between health and environmental sciences, to develop strategies toward understanding and to ease the global health burden from increasing MnP exposures. Such a holistic approach will allow for a better understanding and prediction of fate and transport processes that affect MnP exposure, including the links between human behavior and activities impacting the pathways and uptake through food and agriculture.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors acknowledge the support provided by the Institute for Global Innovation, University of Birmingham, for funding this project.
