        "text": "The Chinese translation of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Revised (WISC-RC) was administered to 660 children (ages 6 through 16 yr.) in the city of Shanghai. The obtained norms represent children's intelligence levels in big cities where the economic and cultural development is advanced. The norms are reported as \"Scaled Score Equivalents of Raw Scores\" for each age group and as \"IQ Equivalents of Sums of Scaled Scores.\" The reliability and validity of the norms indicate that the WISC-R is suitable for use with school-age children in China. The difference between the results for our Shanghai sample (WISC-RCs) and a USA sample (WISC-R) is also discussed.\n\nThirty-six pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins, 24 pairs of same-sexed dizygotic (DZ) twins, and 33 pairs of opposite-sexed DZ twins 12 to 19 years of age were tested in Minia, Egypt, on a battery of cognitive abilities tests. For most of the tests and composite scales, DZ resemblances were higher than typically found in Western samples and not significantly different from MZ resemblances. MZ resemblances were generally lower than typically found in Western samples. These results were discussed in terms of the influence of cross-cultural differences in degree of social stratification and assortative mating.\n\nThe amount of technical detail in modern genetics is so voluminous that no one is able to understand more than a fraction of it. This fraction is usually limited to a particular area, such as blood diseases (“hemaglobinopathies”) or diseases of connective tissue. Yet most geneticists share a body of common understanding, which we cannot hope to condense into a few pages. All we can do is hint at it. We have chosen to spend some time on mental retardation (MR), because many believe that the area of mental illness will sometime in the future, perhaps sooner than most of us realize, begin to look like MR in its plethora of single-gene abnormalities and abnormal numbers of chromosomes as causal factors.\n\nFifty-seven families (57 fathers, 56 mothers, 52 sons, and 52 daughters) from Minia, Egypt, were administered 12 Educational Testing Service tests of specific cognitive abilities and the Comrey Personality Scales. No significant sex or generational differences were found for cognitive abilities. On the CPS, parents were found to be significantly more conforming than offspring, and large sex differences were found on the masculinity-femininity scale. For the cognitive tests, spouse correlations (median r = 0.69), parent-offspring correlations (median r = 0.54), and sibling correlations (median r = 0.59) were found to be considerably higher than those found for American samples. Spouse correlations (median r = 0.42), parent-offspring correlations (median r = 0.23), and sibling correlations (median r = 0.33) on the Comrey scales were also higher than for American samples. These results were discussed in terms of the influence of arranged marriages and greater social stratification in Egypt.\n\nMany physical illnesses are the same in children and adults, whereas other illnesses are limited to one age period, that is, they occur mainly or exclusively in childhood or almost exclusively at a later age. Finally, there are diseases such as diabetes that have both a juvenile and an adult form that differ in certain respects. What is the situation regarding psychiatric problems in childhood?\n\nThe temperance movement (and Prohibition) was based on a 19th century realization that drunkenness was a vice, not only of the wastrel rich and the improvident poor, but also of the middle classes. Alcohol itself was seen as the culprit. However, modern views of alcoholism emphasize that many individuals enjoy drinking without experiencing any alcohol-related difficulties and that one therefore should focus on problem drinkers rather than on alcohol use. In fact, alcoholism is now thought by many to be a disease or a psychiatric disorder rather than a moral weakness. This is reflected in the inclusion of alcohol abuse and of alcohol dependence in the DSM-III. Tables 39 and 40 describe the diagnostic criteria for these two conditions."
