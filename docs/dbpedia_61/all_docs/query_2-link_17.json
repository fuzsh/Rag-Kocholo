        "text": "21 Since this paper was completed, a searching philosophical treatise on the subject has appeared: Thorson, Thomas Landon, Biopolitics (New York 1970)Google Scholar. Although Thorson covers some of the same points and is generally compatible in his approach, his focus is quite different from that of this paper. Further, two panels on biology and politics were held at the 1970 World Congress of the International Political Science Association and at the Sixty-sixth Annual Meeting (1970) of the American Political Science Association. Among those papers that had become available as of this writing, some of the more notable were the following: Henry Beck, “Politics and the Life Sciences: Notes Toward a Theory of Biobehavioral Ecology” (IPSA); James C. Davies, “Violence and Aggression: Innate or Not?” (IPSA); Ralph P. Hummel, “A Case for a Bio-Social Model of Charisma” (IPSA); Dean Jaros, “Biochemical Deserialization: Depressants and Political Behavior” (APSA); David C. Schwartz, “Perceptions of Personal Energy and the Adoption of Basic Behavioral Orientations to Politics” (APSA); Robert B. Stauffer, “The Role of Drugs in Political Change” (IPSA); Thomas Landon Thorson, “The Biological Foundations of Political Science: Reflections on the Post-Behavioral Era” (IPSA); and Manfred W. Wenner, “Symbiosis and Politics” (IPSA). See also Corning, “The Problem of Applying Darwinian Evolution to Political Science” (IPSA); and , Corning, “The Theory of Evolution as a Paradigm for the Analysis of Political Phenomena” (Ph.D. diss., New York University, 1971)Google Scholar.\n\n97 Berkowitz (fn. 93). In addition to “innate determinants” and social learning, Berkowitz also observes that some aggression can result from pain. In utilizing this model, political scientists have adapted it to their own purposes. James C. Davies links violence at the individual level to the frustration of the hierarchy of needs hypothesized by Abraham Maslow (Davies, fn. 21), and, at the macro-level, to severe short-term increases in the gap between rising expectations and the systemic ability to fulfill those expectations, which Davies has visualized graphically as a J-curve (Davies, “The J-Curve of Rising and Declining Satisfactions as a Cause of Some Great Revolutions and a Contained Rebellion,” in Graham and Gurr, fn. 91, 690-730). Ted Robert Gurr, applying the model to large-scale political violence, finds evidence of a causal relationship between violence and perceived “relative deprivations” among the individual members of a society (Gurr, fn. 91; fn. 20; and “A Comparative Study of Civil Strife,” in Graham and Gurr, fn. 91, 572-631), whereas Ivo K. Feierabend, Rosalind L. Feierabend, and Betty A. Nesvold associate such violence with “systemic frustrations” (“Social Change and Political Violence: Cross-National Patterns,” in Graham and Gurr, fn. 91, 632-87).\n\nLike Berkowitz, political scientists are not insensitive to the interrelationship between frustration and the effects of social learning. Gurr, for instance, identifies relative deprivations as the key variable, yet he emphasizes that it is not deprivations per se but the “perception” of unjustified deprivations (which is quite obviously susceptible to in situ learning) that is the necessary precondition for civil violence. Furthermore, Gurr introduces as mediating factors the individual's attitude toward the propriety of violence and his perception of its potential efficacy (that is, the perceived likelihood of success). Again, such perceptions are highly responsive to social learning, even though Gurr chooses in the end to put most of his stress on the underlying deprivations.\n\nOn the other hand, while biological factors are not unappreciated by the political scientists, these factors seem to be treated as constants. Davies, for example, assumes that biologically “each man is like every other man” (fn. 21), 8. Similarly, Gurr introduces a biological mechanism into his explanation in order to establish the linkage between frustration and violent responses, but he appears to treat this mechanism as a constant: “The underlying causal mechanism,” he tells us, “is derived from psychological theory and evidence to the effect that one innate response to perceived deprivation is discontent or anger, and that anger is a motivating state for which aggression is an inherently satisfying response” (fn. 20). He assures us that the degree of anger and violence thus evoked is directly proportional to the intensity of the perceived deprivation (fn. 91), 9. This is analogous, he says, to the law of gravity (Ibid., 37). Elsewhere, though, Gurr inserts the idea (following Berkowitz) that threat-aggression or fear-aggression might result from “avoidance-survival” mechanisms (Ibid., 35). Also, he concedes that there might (“infrequently”) be aggression that is not motivated directly by anger (Ibid., 36). Furthermore, he acknowledges at one point that there may be a distribution of individual responses to frustration—although he doesn't explain whether or not such differences might be due to heredity or to environment (Ibid., 9).\n\n139 The view that ethics has a biological component and serves an evolutionary function is supported by four separate sources. One is the work of ethologists, who find many examples among group-living animals of behaviors we characterize as moral—the altruism of parents toward the young, self-sacrifice in the interest of group survival, food-sharing, inhibitions against killing a conspecific, and so forth. In many instances, these behaviors are clearly precoded in the genes. But since our behavior is organized and shaped to a far greater degree in the domain of culture, it is not surprising to find ethical behavior organized at this level also. A second source of support is from child psychology and related fields (the current sobriquet being “the growth sciences”). Of particular importance is the work of Piaget, Jean and Piaget, Lawrence Kohlberg, The Moral Development of the Child (New York 1965)Google Scholar; Flavell, J. H., The Developmental Psychology of Jean Piaget (Princeton 1963)CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Roger Brown (fn. 103), 384-401; , Kohlberg, “The Child as a Moral Philosopher,” Psychology Today, 11 (September 1968), 25–40Google Scholar. Support also comes from psychologists working with primates in the laboratory. Hebb cites, for instance, the experiments of H. W. Nissen and M. P. Crawford on food-sharing among chimpanzees, and concludes: “The evidence from infrahuman mammals indicates that altruism is a product of evolution and not something that must be beaten into the growing human child because of the needs of society.” Hebb (fn. 13), 247-48; finally, there is a growing body of research evidence from laboratory experiments relating to the neuro-physiological bases of social behavior, including brain stimulation, chemical (hormonal) stimulation, and brain lesion experiments. See, especially, Kenneth E. Moyer, “The Physiology of Affiliation and Hostility,” Report No. 70-1, Carnegie-Mellon University (Pittsburgh 1970)."
