Repeat expansions were determined by a repeat primed PCR. Familial aggregation of dementia and Parkinson disease (PD) was examined among patients with ALS who carried the repeat expansion.\n\nResults:\n\nThe expanded repeat was found in 33 (37%) of all patients with fALS, in 87 (6.1%) patients with sALS, in 4 (1.6%) patients with PMA, and in 1 (0.9%) patient with PLS. None of the controls carried the mutation. Patients with ALS with the repeat expansion had an earlier age at onset (median 59.3 vs 61.9 years, hazard ratio 1.55, p = 5 × 10−5) and shorter survival (median 2.5 vs 2.7 years, hazard ratio 1.46, p = 8 × 10−4). Dementia, but not PD, occurred nearly twice as often in relatives of patients with the expansion compared to all patients with ALS or controls (p = 9 × 10−4).\n\nConclusions:\n\nThe hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is a major cause of fALS and apparently sporadic ALS in the Netherlands. Patients who carry the repeat expansion have an earlier onset, shorter survival, and familial aggregation of dementia. These results challenge the classic definition of fALS and may justify genetic testing in patients with sALS.\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting both the upper and lower motor neurons. On average, patients die within 3 years due to respiratory insufficiency.1 The exact disease course of ALS is, however, hard to predict, with 10% of the patients surviving for longer than 10 years and others dying within months.2 Mild to severe frontotemporal cognitive dysfunction and behavioral changes are seen in up to 50% of patients with ALS.3 Conversely, 14% of the patients with frontotemporal lobe degeneration (FTLD) develop symptoms and signs suggestive of motor neuron disease at a certain stage in the disease course.4 For these reasons, ALS and FTLD might be considered as entities within one neurodegenerative syndrome.\n\nRecently, an intronic hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72, containing an expansion ranging from 30 to hundreds of GGGGCC repeats, was identified in 23.5%–61.5% of the fALS and FTD cases from different cohorts.5,6 Importantly, the repeat expansion was also present in 4.1% of the 195 non-Finnish sALS cases, suggesting that a C9ORF72 repeat expansion is the most frequent and strongest associated genetic abnormality seen in ALS.\n\nTo determine whether patients with a repeat expansion in C9ORF72 exhibit a distinct clinical phenotype, we genotyped a large cohort of well-phenotyped patients with ALS and pure lower or upper motor neuron variants.\n\nMETHODS\n\nPatient selection.\n\nPatients were recruited from the outpatient clinic for neuromuscular diseases at the University Medical Center Utrecht, Radboud University Medical Center Nijmegen, and Academic Medical Center Amsterdam, all tertiary referral centers for patients with ALS in the Netherlands. Additionally, patients participating in the prospective population-based study on motor neuron diseases in the Netherlands were included.7 All patients with ALS fulfilled the revised El Escorial Criteria for possible, probable laboratory-supported, probable, or definite ALS.8 fALS was defined as the presence of at least 1 family member with ALS, PMA, or PLS. Considering the overlap of ALS and FTLD, we also defined fALS according to more liberal criteria: the presence of a relative with ALS, PMA, PLS, or any form of dementia. These patients tested negative for mutations in SOD1, TARDBP, and FUS. Patients with PMA showed signs and symptoms exclusively of lower motor neuron impairment and fulfilled the earlier described diagnostic criteria.9 Patients with PLS exhibited progressive spastic paresis, where other explanations (i.e., myelopathy, infectious disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia) were ruled out as previously described.10 Control subjects were unrelated population-based individuals, matched for gender and age, free of any neuromuscular disease.7\n\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents.\n\nAll patients and control subjects gave written informed consent and the medical ethics commission of the University Medical Center Utrecht approved this study.\n\nGenetic analysis.\n\nDNA was extracted from venous blood using standard protocols. To detect large expanded repeats a repeat primed PCR for the C9ORF72 GGGGCC repeat was performed on genomic DNA. Previous studies have validated this PCR method for detection of the expanded C9ORF72 repeat by Southern blots.5,6 The primers and protocol applied are described in the tables e-1 and e-2 on the Neurology® Web site at www.neurology.org. Fragment analysis was performed on an ABI3730xl sequencer and visualized with GeneMapper software version 3.7 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Alleles with 30 or more GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeats were defined as expanded. To avoid false-negative calls, we genotyped all samples at least twice.\n\nFor the haplotype analysis, we used genotypes of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the 9p21.2 locus derived from a previously performed genome-wide association study.11 The supplemental data provide further details on the haplotype analysis (appendix e-1).\n\nDescription of the clinical phenotype.\n\nFor patients with ALS, age at onset was defined as age at first signs of muscle weakness in a limb, dysphagia, or dysarthria. Survival was defined as time from age at onset until death, tracheostomy, or requirement of continuous ventilatory assistance. Detailed information on the presence of cognitive and behavioral deficits was not available for the patients and their relatives. However, information on the presence of dementia in general among relatives of patients with ALS was available through our prospective population-based study on motor neuron diseases in the Netherlands.7 In this study patients with ALS and population-based control subjects were asked whether dementia or Parkinson disease (PD) affected certain family members of first or second degree.\n\nStatistical analysis.\n\nFor survival and age at onset a Cox proportional hazards model was used in which we corrected for gender and site of onset as well as for age at onset in the survival analysis. An association between the C9ORF72 repeat expansion and site of onset was assessed in a multivariate analysis by logistic regression, thereby correcting for gender. In the analysis of the family history we calculated λ values for the rate of affected family members per stratum: all patients with ALS, patients with ALS with C9ORF72 expansions, and controls. The λ value was defined by dividing the rate of family members affected in the patients group by the rate of family members affected in control subjects; p values were calculated by a 2-tailed Fisher exact test. All statistical analyses were performed using R v2.10 software (www.r-project.org). p Values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn total we included probands with fALS from 78 apparently unrelated families, 1,422 patients with sALS, 246 patients with PMA, 110 patients with PLS, and 768 control subjects. The characteristics of all participants are displayed in table 1, showing only small differences in age and gender between the different groups. All patients and control subjects were Caucasian and of Dutch descent.\n\nThe repeat primed PCR revealed the C9ORF72 hexanucleotide expansion in 33 families with fALS without earlier described mutations, accounting for 37% of all the unrelated families with fALS in the Netherlands (table 2). When we handled the more liberal criteria for fALS nearly one-quarter of the patients carried the C9ORF72 repeat expansion. In the patients with apparently sporadic ALS, e.g., without a positive family history for ALS, the repeat expansion was found in 87 patients (6.1%). None of the control subjects carried the expansion. Four patients with PMA (1.6%) carried a repeat containing more than 30 GGGGCC repeats. Reviewing their clinical data showed that none of the patients presented any upper motor neuron signs during follow-up, which ranged from 4 to 20 years. These 4 patients were still alive 4, 4.2, 5.4, and 21 years after disease onset. We found the repeat expansion in only 1 patient (0.9%) with PLS. This patient had progressive symptoms in both arms and legs. Four years after the disease onset this patient is still alive and at neurologic examination upper motor neuron signs are present exclusively. Neither the patients with PMA nor the patient with PLS reported family members with dementia.\n\nThe majority of the patients with ALS carrying the C9ORF72 mutation shared the haplotype at 9p21.2 that has been associated with ALS in a previous study.12 Patients without the repeat expansion carried this haplotype less often (66% vs 22%, respectively, p = 4.3 × 10−18, figure e-1, table e-3).\n\nPatients with a C9ORF72 expansion appeared to have an earlier disease onset. On average, this occurred 2.5 years earlier in carriers of the expanded hexanucleotide repeat compared to patients without the repeat expansion, as shown in table 3. The median survival was nearly 2.5 months shorter in patients with the hexanucleotide expansion (table 3 and figure 1). Both differences in age at onset and survival reached statistical significance.\n\nWe did not observe a difference in the frequency of bulbar onset between patients carrying the repeat and those homozygous for wild-type C9ORF72 (39% vs 31%, p = 0.23, odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.84–2.02).\n\nWe analyzed the family history of patients with apparently sporadic ALS for the occurrence of dementia and PD among relatives. In total, 550 patients genotyped for the GGGGCC repeat enrolled in the prospective population-based study on motor neuron diseases in the Netherlands, in which they were asked if certain family members were affected by dementia or PD.7 Analyzing these data showed that dementia occurred more frequently among first- and second-degree relatives of patients with the expanded C9ORF72 repeat, compared to healthy controls and patients with ALS in general (table 4). This effect was not observed for PD (table 4).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe discovery of the C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions has had an enormous impact in the field of ALS and FTLD research, being the most common cause of these diseases occurring in families.5,6 In our large screening for the C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion, we found that this genetic mutation is the most common cause of familial ALS in the Netherlands, occurring in 37% of the families. Furthermore, a considerable percentage of the patients with sALS also carry this mutation. Patients who carried the C9ORF72 repeat expansion exhibit a more aggressive disease course with an earlier disease debut and shorter survival, and more frequently have a positive family history for dementia. This clinical phenotype remains very variable, and repeat expansions were found in patients who exhibit slowly progressive lower motor neuron and upper motor neuron impairment exclusively. The repeat expansion was virtually absent in healthy unrelated control subjects.\n\nAlthough the exact penetrance of this mutation is not known yet, current and previous data support the notion that the C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion can be considered to be a highly pathogenic mutation instead of merely a risk factor.\n\nThe high frequency of C9ORF72 mutations in apparently sporadic ALS is remarkable. Although none of these patients report affected family members, they might be in fact fALS cases, which can be explained in several ways. A combination of a non–fully penetrant mutation and small family sizes increases the number of unrecognized families with ALS.13 Although the penetrance of the C9ORF72 repeat expansion might not be comparable to SOD1 mutations, the observed rate of mutations in apparently sporadic ALS is substantially higher for C9ORF72 (6.1% vs ± 2%).14 An additional explanation might be that the expansions cause both ALS and FTLD exclusively. This way, families might not be recognized if the link between family members with ALS and FTLD has never been made. This is supported by our observation that relatives of patients with the repeat expansion have dementia more often. These family members could have had dementia caused by the C9ORF72 expansion, true FTLD, or amnestic dementia resembling AD, which has been associated with the repeat expansions as well.15,16 Finally the high rate of C9ORF72 expansions in sporadic ALS cases can reflect de novo repeat expansions or anticipation of a premutation in earlier generations, a well-described mechanism in other diseases associated with repeat expansions.17\n\nPresently standard genetic testing for patients with sALS is not recommended.18 The observed rate of C9ORF72 mutations in apparently sporadic ALS may justify genetic testing in these patients. For improved genetic counseling, however, future studies will need to address the issues on mode of inheritance, penetrance, and further define the clinical phenotype.\n\nThe identification of patients with PMA and PLS who carry the repeat expansion extends the spectrum of diseases associated with the GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat beyond classic ALS, FTLD, and dementia mimicking AD. Identifying genetic or environmental modifiers for this variety in clinical phenotype will provide greater insight into the etiology of ALS and may lead to new therapeutic strategies. This challenge will require large cohorts of extensively phenotyped and genotyped patients to ensure the studies have sufficient statistical power.\n\nThe main limitation of this study is the lack of information on cognitive and behavioral dysfunction, which limits our ability to fully investigate FTLD in relation to the repeat expansion. Instead, the data on dementia in general among relatives were available in a large sample of patients and controls. Ideally, a clinician should have verified the family history in a personal interview so relatives with true FTLD could have been identified. However, this approach is laborious and reduces the number of patients who can be included. As a consequence, this would have greatly reduced statistical power that was achieved by using the questionnaires. Because of the methodologic limitations, the results from the questionnaires on the family history should only be regarded as suggestive for the statement that FTLD occurs more frequently among those related to patients with apparently sporadic ALS carrying the C9ORF72 repeat expansion.\n\nOur study identified the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 as a major cause of familial and apparently sporadic ALS with a more aggressive disease course.\n\nGLOSSARY\n\nALS\n\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n\nfALS\n\nfamilial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n\nFTLD\n\nfrontotemporal lobe degeneration\n\nPD\n\nParkinson disease\n\nPLS\n\nprimary lateral sclerosis\n\nPMA\n\nprogressive muscular atrophy\n\nsALS\n\nsporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n\nSNP\n\nsingle nucleotide polymorphism\n\nData Supplement\n\nThree tables, one figure, and an appendix; five Microsoft Word files.\n\nNeurology® data supplements are not copyedited before publication.
