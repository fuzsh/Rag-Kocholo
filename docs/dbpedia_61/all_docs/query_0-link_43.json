        "text": "Main text\n\nLong QT syndrome (LQTS; MIM: 192500) is a rare genetic disorder caused by variants in genes that encode cardiac ion channel proteins. Abnormal variants in these genes lead to cardiac ion channel dysfunction, which can result in cardiac arrhythmia and an increased risk of sudden death, often with no prior symptoms. Genetic testing is recognized as a key component of patient management and is recommended by clinical guidelines.\n\n1\n\nWilde A.A.M.\n\nSemsarian C.\n\nMárquez M.F.\n\nSepehri Shamloo A.\n\nAckerman M.J.\n\nAshley E.A.\n\nSternick E.B.\n\nBarajas-Martinez H.\n\nBehr E.R.\n\nBezzina C.R.\n\net al.\n\nEuropean Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA)/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS)/Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS)/Latin American Heart Rhythm Society (LAHRS) Expert Consensus Statement on the state of genetic testing for cardiac diseases.\n\nEstablishing a genetic diagnosis can inform clinical management and treatment strategies, provide greater accuracy in assessing prognosis, and enable reproductive counseling. Importantly, as not all individuals with a pathogenic variant present with clinical signs or symptoms of LQTS, where a genetic diagnosis is confirmed in an affected individual, genetic testing can be offered to family members to identify those at risk. The perceived clinical importance of making a presymptomatic genetic diagnosis of LQTS is highlighted by the inclusion of the key causal genes in the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) list for reporting of secondary findings in clinical exome and genome sequencing.\n\n2\n\nMiller D.T.\n\nLee K.\n\nAbul-Husn N.S.\n\nAmendola L.M.\n\nBrothers K.\n\nChung W.K.\n\nGollob M.H.\n\nGordon A.S.\n\nHarrison S.M.\n\nHershberger R.E.\n\net al.\n\nACMG SF v3.1 list for reporting of secondary findings in clinical exome and genome sequencing: A policy statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG).\n\nCurrent genome sequencing technologies enable more comprehensive genetic analysis to be performed cost effectively, and genetic testing has become more widely adopted for LQTS. While this has led to an increase in the proportion of patients with a genetic diagnosis, the interpretation of genetic test results remains challenging. Due to lack of definitive evidence for pathogenicity, many missense variants detected in LQTS genes are classified as variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUSs), which are not actionable clinically. High numbers of VUSs can reduce the clinical utility of genetic testing.\n\nIn a recent study,\n\n3\n\nJiang C.\n\nRichardson E.\n\nFarr J.\n\nHill A.P.\n\nUllah R.\n\nKroncke B.M.\n\nHarrison S.M.\n\nThomson K.L.\n\nIngles J.\n\nVandenberg J.I.\n\nNg C.A.\n\nA calibrated functional patch-clamp assay to enhance clinical variant interpretation in KCNH2-related long QT syndrome.\n\nwe demonstrated the utility of a high-throughput patch-clamp assay to assess the functional consequences of a set of 31 missense variants (Table 1) in the KCNH2 gene (GenBank: NM_000238.4; EnsEMBL: ENST00000262186.10).\n\n3\n\nJiang C.\n\nRichardson E.\n\nFarr J.\n\nHill A.P.\n\nUllah R.\n\nKroncke B.M.\n\nHarrison S.M.\n\nThomson K.L.\n\nIngles J.\n\nVandenberg J.I.\n\nNg C.A.\n\nA calibrated functional patch-clamp assay to enhance clinical variant interpretation in KCNH2-related long QT syndrome.\n\n,\n\n4\n\nAdler A.\n\nNovelli V.\n\nAmin A.S.\n\nAbiusi E.\n\nCare M.\n\nNannenberg E.A.\n\nFeilotter H.\n\nAmenta S.\n\nMazza D.\n\nBikker H.\n\net al.\n\nAn International, Multicentered, Evidence-Based Reappraisal of Genes Reported to Cause Congenital Long QT Syndrome.\n\nThis gene encodes Kv11.1, a protein component of the voltage-gated potassium ion channel, which is responsible for the rapid delayed rectifier current (IKr).

The advantage of using a larger number of benign variant controls, selected based on the MAF, is that we were able to sample a broader range of biological and experimental variation and more clearly define a range for normal function measured by patch-clamp electrophysiology (Figure 1). Using our assay, the functionally normal range was defined by a Z score within ±2 of the mean normalized current density determined from 30 benign control variants. The functionally abnormal LoF range was defined by a Z score of −2 or below, corresponding to a variant having less than 55% of normal function, a clinically relevant threshold consistent with protein haploinsufficiency.\n\n6\n\nAnderson C.L.\n\nRoutes T.C.\n\nEckhardt L.L.\n\nDelisle B.P.\n\nJanuary C.T.\n\nKamp T.J.\n\nA rapid solubility assay of protein domain misfolding for pathogenicity assessment of rare DNA sequence variants.\n\nIn our previous study, the 17 pathogenic variant controls had various levels of reduced function.\n\n3\n\nJiang C.\n\nRichardson E.\n\nFarr J.\n\nHill A.P.\n\nUllah R.\n\nKroncke B.M.\n\nHarrison S.M.\n\nThomson K.L.\n\nIngles J.\n\nVandenberg J.I.\n\nNg C.A.\n\nA calibrated functional patch-clamp assay to enhance clinical variant interpretation in KCNH2-related long QT syndrome.\n\nIn this study, we included an additional 13 pathogenic variant controls (Tables 1 and S1) to increase the statistical power of the assay (Table 2).

Using this scale, variants with a Z score between −2 and −3 (mild LoF), −3 and −4 (moderate LoF), and less than −4 (severe LoF) could be categorized as PS3_supporting, PS3_moderate, or PS3_strong, respectively. It is important to note that this in vitro cell model system may not fully reflect protein function in vivo and might not capture all abnormal LoF. Taking into consideration these limitations, we proposed that normal function variants with a Z score between 0 and 1 or –1 could be classified as BS3_moderate and with a Z score between 1 and 2 or –1 and –2 as BS3_supporting (Figure 1).\n\nTo investigate the utility of our approach, the functional evidence level determined from this assay was applied to enhance the classification of 18 KCNH2 missense variants detected by Westphal et al. in children with suspected LQTS.\n\n13\n\nWestphal D.S.\n\nBurkard T.\n\nMoscu-Gregor A.\n\nGebauer R.\n\nHessling G.\n\nWolf C.M.\n\nReclassification of genetic variants in children with long QT syndrome.\n\nEvidence of abnormal LoF was found for 14 missense variants (Figure 2A, yellow and brown circles; Table S3).

Considering this additional evidence, the classification of one variant (p.Leu697His) was upgraded from VUS to likely pathogenic after PS3 was applied at a strong level (Table S2).\n\nOverall, the findings of our study indicate that the functional evidence produced by this validated assay is extremely valuable for the interpretation of KCNH2 missense variants in the context of LQTS. However, functional data from this assay should not be used as sole evidence to classify a variant as pathogenic or benign but should be considered in the context of other evidence, as outlined in the ACMG/AMP framework.\n\n7\n\nRichards S.\n\nAziz N.\n\nBale S.\n\nBick D.\n\nDas S.\n\nGastier-Foster J.\n\nGrody W.W.\n\nHegde M.\n\nLyon E.\n\nSpector E.\n\net al.\n\nStandards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants: a joint consensus recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology.\n\nAt present, we have not extensively examined the functional range of so-called risk alleles, which display incomplete penetrance and may only have pathogenic potential in the presence of other environmental or genetic risk factors. For example, the p.(Arg176Trp) variant, which was detected in the Westphal et al. childhood-onset LQTS cohort, has been reported as founder variant in the Finnish population\n\n10\n\nFodstad H.\n\nSwan H.\n\nLaitinen P.\n\nPiippo K.\n\nPaavonen K.\n\nViitasalo M.\n\nToivonen L.\n\nKontula K.\n\nFour potassium channel mutations account for 73% of the genetic spectrum underlying long-QT syndrome (LQTS) and provide evidence for a strong founder effect in Finland.\n\nand reported to be enriched in individuals referred for LQTS genetic testing but lacking a molecular diagnosis.\n\n19\n\nVatta M.\n\nTruty R.\n\nGarcia J.\n\nCallis T.E.\n\nHatchell K.\n\nRojahn S.\n\nMorales A.\n\nAradhya S.\n\nNussbaum R.\n\nCommon Variants in KCNE1, KCNH2, and SCN5A May Impact Cardiac Arrhythmia Risk.\n\nThe frequency of this variant in the gnomAD European (non-Finnish) population was higher than the threshold used to select benign variant controls for this study; however, it was determined by the assay to have a mild LoF effect (Z score −2.75); these findings are consistent with this being a variant with low or incomplete penetrance. Further studies may provide additional functional evidence, which might help clarify the pathogenic potential of this class of variant.\n\nIn conclusion, this patch-clamp assay, which used extensively characterized variant controls to calibrate thresholds for normal and abnormal LoF missense variants in the KCNH2 gene, provides reliable functional evidence that can be incorporated into clinical variant classification. This has potential to reduce uncertainty in variant interpretation in this clinically important gene."
