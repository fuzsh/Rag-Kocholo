        "text": "In behavior genetics, like many fields, researchers must decide whether their models adequately explain their data – whether their models “fit” at some satisfactory level. Well-fitting models are compelling, whereas poorly-fitting models are not (Rodgers & Rowe, 2002). Oftentimes, researchers evaluate model fit by employing “universal” rules of thumb (e.g., Hu and Bentler, 1999). However, these rules are not universal, and should be treated as model specific (Kang et al., 2016). Accordingly, we focused on developing fit criteria emulating Hu and Bentler (1999) for classic univariate models (ACE; CE; AE) by fitting simulated twin data with correctly- and incorrectly-specified models. Ideal criteria should consistently accept correct models and reject incorrect models. Classic ACE models were indistinguishable and virtually all fit indices were non-informative because (or especially when) they were obtained in saturated models. For non-ACE models, criteria were informative. Nevertheless, every fit metric employed, except TLI, differed markedly across models and/or conditions. Universal solutions remain elusive, but promising and valid approaches include nested model comparisons, increasing degrees of freedom, and ruthless skepticism.\n\nThis article reviews eight different software packages for linear structural equation modeling. The eight packages—Amos, SAS PROC CALIS, R packages sem, lavaan, OpenMx, LISREL, EQS, and Mplus—can help users estimate parameters for a model where the structure is well specified. Capabilities for handling single group, multiple group, nonnormal variables, and missing data are considered and the eight packages are compared across a variety of criteria from documentation to parameter estimation. The main difference between the packages is the presence of a graphical interface for model specification and presentation of results. Each package differs in terms of strengths, areas of improvement, and unique features that may dictate the choice of selection. Some suggestions on areas of improvement for all software packages are made. This article has supplementary materials online.\n\nStructural equation model trees (SEM Trees) allow for the construction of decision trees with structural equation models fit in each of the nodes. Based on covariate information, SEM Trees can be used to create distinct subgroups containing individuals with similar parameter estimates. Currently, the structural equation modeling component of SEM Trees is implemented in the R packages OpenMx and lavaan. We extend SEM Trees so that the models can be fit in Mplus, in the hopes that its efficiency and accessibility allow a broader group of researchers to fit a wider range of models. We discuss the Mplus Trees algorithm, its implementation, and its position among the growing number of tree-based methods in psychological research. We also provide several examples using publicly available data to illustrate how Mplus Trees can be implemented in practice with the R package MplusTrees.\n\nObjective: Using Swedish nationwide registry data, we investigated the contribution of genetic and environmental risk factors to the etiology of alcohol use disorders by extended twin pedigree modeling. Methods: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) was defined using public inpatient, outpatient, prescription and criminal records. Three-generational pedigrees were selected for index individuals born between 1980-1990, obtained from the national twin and genealogical registers, whose parents were twins. Relatives of the twins included in the pedigrees were their parents, siblings, spouses and children. Genetic structural equation modeling was applied to the population-based data on AUD, using OpenMx, with age used as a covariate. Results: Analyses including up to 162,469 individuals in 18,971 pedigrees estimated AUD prevalence at 5-12% in males and 2-5% in females. Results indicated substantial heritability (~50-60%) of which a portion upwards of 5% was due to the consequences of assortative mating. Contributions of shared environmental factors to AUD, which represent a mix of within and cross-generational effects, appeared to be moderate (~10-20%). Unique environment accounted for the remaining variance (~20-30%). Sex differences in the magnitude of the variance components suggested higher heritability in males and correspondingly higher shared environmental contributions in females. Conclusions: Using objective registry data, we found that AUD is highly heritable. Furthermore, shared environmental factors contributed significantly to the liability of AUD in both males and females.\n\nΩnyx is a free software environment for creating and estimating structural equation models (SEM). It provides a graphical user interface that facilitates an intuitive creation of models, and a powerful back end for performing maximum likelihood estimation of parameters. Path diagrams in Ωnyx can be exported to OpenMx, lavaan, and Mplus to allow an easy transition to script-based SEM software. Also, OpenMx scripts can be transformed into a path diagrams in Ωnyx. In addition to the graphical user interface, Ωnyx provides a maximum likelihood optimizer that finds multiple minima and does not require the user to provide starting values. To our knowledge, Ωnyx is the only SEM program that provides multiple optima. This article describes both the graphical and conceptual features of Ωnyx, including the optimization approach, and demonstrates two hands-on modeling examples."
