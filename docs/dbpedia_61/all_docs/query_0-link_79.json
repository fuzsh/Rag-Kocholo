        "text": "Only a small number of reports have involved the prospective use of genotyping to make treatment decisions. An open study of 58 depressed inpatients reported that genotyping for ABCB1 was associated with a shorter hospital stay because patients with the TT/GG genotype were more likely to have an increase in the dose of an antidepressant that was a P-gp substrate, although changing to a non-P-gp substrate did not affect outcome [46]. The study was not randomized, and numerous intervening variables, including pharmacokinetics, comorbidity, and history, were not considered.\n\nFour studies have been supported by the manufacturer of a proprietary survey (GeneSight) of CYP2D6, 2C19, 2C9, and 1A2, SLC6A4, and 5HTR2A genotypes that generates a ‘composite report' classifying antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs used in the treatment of depression into three categories: ‘use as directed', ‘use with caution', and ‘use with caution and with more frequent monitoring'. An 8-week open study of 44 patients assigned in a nonrandom manner to treatment guided by the composite report (guided treatment) or nonguided treatment by the same clinicians, who were involved with the product, reported that patients in the guided group were less likely to receive medications in the ‘use with caution and with more frequent monitoring' category, presumably because of reluctance by the guided clinicians to prescribe medications that required more monitoring [47]. Although improvement of depression was similar for the first 4 weeks in both groups, a single measure at 8 weeks indicated increased depression scores for the nonguided but not the guided group. No explanation was offered for the final increase in depression scores in the nonguided group, when multiple earlier ratings demonstrated a steady decrease in scores. Improvement in the guided group was not impressive, and it is impossible to know whether comorbid factors, concomitant medications, treatment adherence, patient enthusiasm, substance use, adjunctive psychotherapy, clinician knowledge of treatment condition, and open ratings affected the conduct of treatment or the outcome assessment.\n\nA second open, nonrandomized study conducted by the same group in 227 mildly-moderately depressed patients, 165 of whom completed 8 weeks of treatment, reported that patients in the guided group were twice as likely to respond [48]. Since clinicians reported substantial levels of confidence in the genetic reports, it is possible that they worked more vigorously with patients in the guided group, that patients in the guided group were more adherent with a treatment approach they thought would be more effective, or that they reported better results to please the investigators.\n\nIn a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of GeneSight, 25 depressed patients were assigned to treatment as usual and 26 to guided treatment [49]. Improvement was numerically greater in patients in the guided than in the treatment-as-usual group, but none of the group differences were statistically significant. In a fourth report from the same company [50], 97 patients with a depressive or anxiety disorder treated openly by a single psychiatrist with one of the medications in the genetic survey were followed openly for 1 year. The 9 patients taking at least one medication in the ‘use with caution' category had significantly more total health care visits and nonpsychiatric medical visits than the other subjects and had a higher average cost of care. However, these patients also took more medications than the other subjects, and there was a significant correlation between the number of medications taken and the two outcome variables. When different statistical analyses were performed on the same data (e.g. analysis of variance and t tests), some were significant and some were not, and no correction was made for multiple statistical tests. Although the authors contended that their genetic analysis could save health care costs, this hypothesis was not actually tested. Since no data were available on medical comorbidity and severity of psychiatric illness, the possibility was not considered that the small number of patients in the ‘use with caution' category had more health care visits and took more medications because they were sicker psychiatrically or medically.\n\n1.\n\nMalhotra AK, Zhang J-P, Lencz T: Pharmacogenetics in psychiatry: translating research into clinical practice.
