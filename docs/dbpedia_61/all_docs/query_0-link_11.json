        "text": "Midlife Phase of the Louisville Twin Study\n\nBirth years of the original Louisville twins range from 1950 to 1997, so all possible data from the childhood phase of the LTS have been collected. Of the 1,770 individual twins, 1,086 (61.36%) participated in at least one wave of data collection and will be between the ages of 40 and 64 in 2019. Given the middle-aged nature of the Louisville twins, lifespan questions about cognitive aging can be studied, including: How have differences in twins’ cognitive and social development influenced differences in physical and cognitive aging? To what extent might differences in the twins’ early and attained socioeconomic status influenced successful cognitive aging? What are the genetic and environmental processes underlying the association between cognitive development and cognitive aging? And to what extent is cognitive development causally related to differences in cognitive aging and decline? As twin studies allow for examination of within-family differences, adjusting for all unmeasured genetic and environmental factors that contribute to twins’ similarity, the temporal measurement of childhood, adolescent, and middle-age cognitive, biological, psychosocial, and economic factors permit the most stringent investigation into effects of within-family differences in childhood characteristics (e.g., achievement) on within-family differences in midlife cognitive ability outcomes (e.g., memory functioning). In a lifespan study where random assignment to childhood conditions is unethical if not impossible, within-family longitudinal effects from one developmental epoch to another provide the strongest support for a causal association.\n\nEarly life development can influence cognitive aging, particularly cognitive development (Deary et al. 2012a). Lifespan studies can be used to understand how early life factors serve as both risk and protective factors of later life outcomes. With the intractability of preventing or curing Alzheimer’s disease, for example, lifespan approaches are deployed to identify when in the lifespan pathological and cognitive symptoms of decline begin (Livingston et al. 2017; Jack et al. 2018). Cognitive development, early life socioeconomic status, and psychosocial development may have downstream effects on cognitive functioning in midlife and beyond. Yet, these same developmental factors may predict biological, physical, psychosocial, and socioeconomic factors in middle age that more proximally influence cognitive aging and therefore likely have larger effects. Thus, there are two issues related to cognitive aging that we have prioritized in restarting data collection on the middle-aged Louisville twins: 1) specifying causal effects of early-life developmental trajectories on cognitive functioning at midlife, and 2) testing whether and how aging mediates effects of cognitive development on cognitive functioning at midlife.\n\nGiven the longstanding focus on child cognitive development in Louisville twins, a natural objective of this midlife study is to model the genetic and environmental processes that connect cognitive development to midlife cognitive functioning. In support of this objective, lower cognitive developmental outcomes in childhood correlate with lower adult levels of cognitive functioning, including memory functioning, executive functioning, and risk of cognitive impairment (Stern 2006; Deary et al. 2012b; Russ et al. 2013). Novel data collection in middle-aged Louisville twins will facilitate exploring genetic and environmental etiologies of cognitive maintenance as people enter the second half of the lifespan. For example, do persons with greater growth in their cognitive developmental trajectories have better cognitive functioning in middle age? When in childhood does cognitive development begin to have predictive utility of midlife cognitive functioning? To what extent does greater growth in cognition across development offset the negative effects of being born into low socio-economic status [SES] families?\n\nEffects of child and adult SES on cognitive aging also are of particular interest to us, as research suggests that heritability of cognitive functioning is sensitive to childhood SES (Turkheimer et al. 2003), at least in the United States (Tucker-Drob and Bates 2016). Childhood SES moderates heritability of full-scale IQ scores in the LTS, both cross-sectionally at age 7 years (Turkheimer et al. 2015) and longitudinally across childhood and adolescence (Giangrande et al. 2019). Analysis of early life socioeconomic advantages may facilitate understanding for how and when actualization of genetic potential for cognitive development in midlife occurs (Bronfenbrenner and Ceci 1994). Questions remain, however, about whether better childhood SES levels continue to serve as a basis for high heritability of cognitive functioning in middle age. We will test such a hypothesis, as only one study has examined whether childhood SES moderates heritability of adult cognitive function (Bates et al. 2013). The study in which these results were observed, the Midlife in the United States Study (Brim et al. 2004), unfortunately relied on retrospective reports of childhood SES. The LTS however, has contemporaneous measurements of childhood SES and cognitive ability across 16 measurement occasions, as well as SES measures for twins’ parents and grandparents. Models that consist of both mean-level family wealth and change in wealth as moderators of adult cognitive functioning will provide better insight into the effects childhood SES has on actualizing cognitive potential, be it via heritable or environmental mechanisms.\n\nA midlife study of the Louisville twins also makes adult twins’ SES available to study as a moderator of the heritability of cognitive ability. To our knowledge, only one twin study, the IGEMS consortium (Zavala et al. 2018), has investigated whether adult SES moderates genetic and environmental variance underlying cognition. Higher attained SES augments heritability of some cognitive domains (e.g., symbol digit) while attenuates others (e.g., block design), findings that were not influenced by effects of rearing SES. Relative differences in attained SES within families are expected to lead to differences in heritability of cognitive ability in adulthood, but this remains an open question that might provide insight into the social and economic causes of cognitive functioning at midlife. As an example, wealthy-born twins who become high-paid physicians while their co-twins become low-paid artists might have the same genetic advantage underlying their cognitive functioning as impoverished-born twins who become modest-earning small business owners while their co-twins live hand-to-mouth as gig economy workers. Relative within-family differences in adult SES, in other words, might be the same irrespective of twins’ childhood SES positioning, leading to the possibility that adult SES may actualize genetic potential underlying cognition irrespective of childhood SES effects.\n\nCorrelating cognitive developmental trajectories and other early life factors with cognitive outcomes at midlife is an obvious strength of the LTS, but early life cognition is not the primary predictor of cognitive aging. Rather, age is the greatest risk factor of cognitive aging (Deary et al. 2009; Salthouse 2009). Yet measuring age is not as straightforward as one might think. Age-related biological change, known as biological age, is a more efficient and reliable predictor of age-related health outcomes than chronological age (Levine 2013). Biological age is quantified using clinical outcomes to estimate whether some persons’ biological age is older or younger than their chronological age. Measures of biological age circumvent problems of using chronological age to predict cognitive age and cognitive impairment (e.g., mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease) by quantifying age as a function of the breakdown of structural and functional physiological systems (Horvath 2013; Levine 2013; Chen et al. 2016). Biological age tends to be more strongly correlated with global cognitive functioning (Belsky et al. 2015) and cognitive decline (Belsky et al. 2017) than is chronological age. No twin studies of biological age and cognitive functioning, however, have been conducted up to now. Yet, twin studies have the potential to clarify whether pair differences in biological age might predict cognitive functioning at midlife. If twins with greater biological age perform worse on cognitive tests relative to their co-twins, stronger causal conclusions can be drawn about the effects of biological age on cognitive aging; neither shared genetic nor shared environmental factors (whether experienced in childhood or adulthood) can explain the effect. In our pilot study of the LTS (below), we used clinical biological markers to quantify biological age and show that it slightly outperforms chronological age as a predictor of cognitive functioning outcomes.\n\nChildhood cognitive developmental outcomes predict midlife biological age, too (Schaefer et al. 2015). For this reason, our revitalization efforts of the LTS are ideal for exploring whether individual differences in childhood cognitive developmental trajectories predict midlife biological age. The effects of early-life cognitive ability on biological age also have not been studied using genetically informed longitudinal data spanning childhood through middle age. Any effects that cognitive ability in childhood might have on biological age may be attributed to gene-environment correlative processes, that is, the hypothesis that nonrandom exposure to environments (e.g., those supportive of cognitive development) depends on genetically influenced characteristics (e.g., high achieving parents’ genotype) (Scarr and McCartney 1983). Twins with slight initial genetic and environmental advantages for cognitive ability will select into and be reinforced by their social environments over their co-twins, causing pairs to drift apart in ability level with time (Dickens and Flynn 2001). As we have modeled this process for cognitive ability in LTS childhood data (Beam et al. 2015), it is likely that twins set on positive cognitive trajectories will have younger biological ages compared to their co-twins. The dense measurement of cognitive ability in the childhood phase of the LTS not only will clarify critical periods in development that affect age-related biological changes that speed up or slow down aging, but also will adjust for gene-environment correlation that confounds the temporal association between early-life cognition and biological age.\n\nThe LTS is a rare resource for studying antecedent factors of cognitive aging and establishing a life-span twin study of biological and cognitive aging. As noted at the outset of this report, we conducted two separate pilot studies in anticipation of new data collection of the Louisville twins at midlife (R01 AG063949-01). The first study took place in 2016 and focused on locating Louisville Twins. The second study occurred in 2018 and was conducted to demonstrate that the Louisville twins could not only be relocated but were willing to participate in additional follow-up testing. With this pilot study data, we will present stability of cognitive functioning from infancy through midlife and will demonstrate that biological age outperforms chronological age as a correlate of cognitive functioning in midlife. Following results of each pilot study, we discuss the broader aims of the midlife study of Louisville twins.\n\nDiscussion\n\nBoth LTS pilot studies were designed to reconnect with middle-aged Louisville twins after 16-18 years of study hiatus and establish feasibility of conducting in-person follow-up assessments of all twins in midlife (40-64 years of age). The findings of the first pilot study confirm that the majority of Louisville twins can be relocated without direct contact with the twins. Relocation efforts show that twins can be relocated up to 54 years since the last time they participated in an assessment and that, given the high rate of success in finding the twins, relocated families differ only modestly from the families who were not relocated.\n\nThe closest United States twin study comparable to the Louisville Twin Study is the Colorado Adoption/Twin Study of Lifespan Behavioral Development and Cognitive Aging (CATSLife; Reynolds et al. 2017), which has a good success rate of relocating twins (Wadsworth et al. 2019). The LTS, however, differs from CATSLife in two important ways. First, the majority of twins are middle aged (CATSLife was initiated in 1987; Reynolds et al. 2017), which means that the LTS midlife pilot study spans 40-60 years. In this way, the current pilot study constitutes the longest running twin study in the United States to date. Second, the LTS sample size is nearly double that of CATSLife, which implies that power is greater to detect true effects of early life development on midlife outcomes.\n\nMidlife study of the Louisville twins constitutes a true lifespan longitudinal twin study. The main advantage of the LTS is the density of repeated measurements during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Obviously, firm substantive conclusions cannot be drawn based on the pilot study findings presented above. The 40 twins who participated were enrolled over a two-week period due to limited funding and project time constraints. Their high functioning scores most likely reflect bias in favor of wealthier and healthier twins who could make time to participate within our short time-frame. Twins who participated, for example, traveled from both United States coasts to Louisville on their own account to participate in the pilot study. We will attempt to correct for sampling bias in the full midlife study of Louisville Twins using information previously collected from the twins. Yet, the findings in the current pilot report suggest that cognitive developmental trajectories, lower biological age, higher functional ability, and higher physical functioning correlate in expected directions with midlife FSIQ and episodic memory, consistent with results found in larger studies (Deary et al. 2000; Singh-Manoux et al. 2005; Emery et al. 2012; Kimhy et al. 2013; Karlamangla et al. 2014; Schaefer et al. 2016).\n\nBroader Study Aims of the Midlife Phase of the Louisville Twin Study\n\nStudy of middle-aged Louisville twins will play an important role in clarifying whether early life SES advantage confers greater genetic variance underlying cognitive functioning in midlife. Few studies have investigated whether early life SES moderates heritability of cognitive ability in adulthood (Tucker-Drob and Bates 2016). Further, the LTS will clarify whether adult SES, as well as differences between childhood and adult SES moderate heritability of cognitive ability. To date, longitudinal effects of childhood SES on adult cognition have not been addressed in twins. Similarly, studies have yet to address whether improvement in SES from childhood to adulthood might offset negative effects of childhood SES on adult cognitive functioning. We will address these questions in the midlife LTS study to fill these gaps in the literature.\n\nOur study of middle-aged twins in the LTS will forge pathways for investigating the direct and indirect pathways through which genetic factors influence cognitive and biological aging, among other phenotypes of interest; in essence, addressing questions of how rather than what (Anastasi 1958). One of the greatest difficulties of developmental behavior genetics is specifying the indirect pathways through which genetic and environmental factors contribute to phenotypic development (Briley et al. 2018). Genetically informed longitudinal designs are useful for quantifying gene-environment correlation that lead to “sibling drift” – the expectation that genetically related individuals increasingly differ with age (Beam and Turkheimer 2017). Yet, differences in biological and environmental mechanisms might moderate the strength of gene-environment correlation underlying cognitive development over the lifespan (Plomin and Spinath 2004). Further, these mechanisms are many, subtle, and notoriously difficult to quantify because of small effect sizes (Anastasi 1958; Cole 2009). Combined with the existing childhood cognitive data in the LTS, we will measure genotype, DNA methylation, and biological age in middle-aged Louisville twins to expand analysis of the causal chain between genotype and cognitive functioning in middle age.\n\nUltimate cognitive aging outcomes of interest are severe cognitive impairment, namely Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. The lifespan structure of the LTS will allow us to make contributions to whether and how aging processes from childhood through midlife might inform development of preclinical risk factors of Alzheimer’s disease. The preclinical phase of dementia is at the forefront of Alzheimer’s disease research, as effective disease prevention probably needs to start in the first half of the lifespan (Jack et al. 2018; Livingston et al. 2017). Significant questions in the cognitive aging and Alzheimer’s disease literature include identifying when in middle age beta-amyloid (Aβ) levels begin to rise (i.e., the principle pathological marker of Alzheimer’s disease), identifying who is at greatest risk, and what early life factors account for increases in Aβ (Jack et al. 2018). Aβ levels increase across the pre-symptomatic phase of ADRD when neuropathology is present without evidence of clinical symptoms (Toledo et al. 2013). Studies, unfortunately, tend to include mixed samples of both middle-aged (40-64) and older (≥ 65 years) participants, which confound preclinical with clinical levels of Aβ. As the midlife LTS consists only of middle-aged twins, our goal is to track twins as Aβ aggregation occurs with age and correlate these levels with cognitive decline and worse memory recall (Cosentino et al. 2010; Clark et al. 2016; Clark et al. 2018; Jansen et al. 2018). As the causal ordering between Aβ accumulation and cognitive decline cannot be established in nonfamilial studies, repurposing the LTS for studying early and midlife effects on within-pair differences in Aβ accumulation will clarify this research gap."
