Deary Nature Communications volume , Article number: 2098 (2018) open\n\nSee also this Twitter thread\n\nGeneral cognitive function is a prominent and relatively stable human trait that is associated with many important life outcomes. We combine cognitive and genetic data from the CHARGE and COGENT consortia, and UK Biobank (total- Nâ=â300,486; age 16-102) and find 148 genome-wide significant independent loci (Pâ<â5âÃâ10â8) associated with general cognitive function. Within the novel genetic loci are variants associated with neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, physical and psychiatric illnesses, and brain structure. Gene-based analyses find 709 genes associated with general cognitive function. Expression levels across the cortex are associated with general cognitive function. Using polygenic scores, up to 4.3% of variance in general cognitive function is predicted in independent samples. We detect significant genetic overlap between general cognitive function, reaction time, and many health variables including eyesight, hypertension, and longevity. In conclusion we identify novel genetic loci and pathways contributing to the heritability of general cognitive function.\n\nabstract\n\nGry Oftedal (2005). Heritability and genetic causation. Philosophy of Science, 72, 699-709. pdf\n\nAbstract The method in human genetics of ascribing causal responsibility to genotype by the use of heritability estimates has been heavily criticized over the years. It has been argued that these estimates are rarely valid and do not serve the purpose of tracing genetic causes. Recent contributions strike back at this criticism. I present and discuss two opposing views on these matters represented by Richard Lewontin and Neven Sesardic, and I suggest that some of the disagreement is based on differing concepts of genetic causation. I use the distinction of structuring and triggering causes to help clarifying the basis for the opposing views.\n\nKey publication.\n\nR. C. Lewontin (1974).

Relatedness disequilibrium regression explained. blog\n\n\"In a- paper- [abstract and references] published today in- Nature Genetics- by myself, Augustine Kong, Kari Stefansson, and other scientists at deCODE Genetics, we introduce a novel method for estimation of heritability, Relatedness Disequilibrium Regression (RDR). Like Sib-Regression, RDR takes advantage of the variation in relatedness due to random shuffling of genes during production of sperm and eggs in parents, which we term 'relatedness disequilibrium'. The difference is, by using genetic information on parents, RDR can use the relatedness disequilibrium from all pairs of individuals in a sample, not just siblings. By using a large sample of Icelanders, we were able to estimate heritability precisely for a variety of human traits.\"\n\nHow scientists are trying to predict your future with your genes. But what are the limits? Genome-wide association studies, explained. By Brian Resnick @B_resnick brian@vox.com Aug 23, 2018, 9:10am EDT blog\n\nTheodosius Dobzhansky (1973). Genetic diversity & human equality. Basic Books. isbn 0465026710\n\nIt would seem that the easiest way to discredit the idea of equality is to show that people are innately, genetically, and therefore irremediably diverse and unlike. The snare is, of course, that human equality pertains to the rights and to the sacredness of life of every human being, not to bodily or even mental characteristics. Diversity is an observable fact of nature, while equality is an ethical commandment.\n\nRichard J. Herrnstein & Charles Murray (1994). The Bell curve. Intelligence and class structure in American life. New York: The Free Press. isbn 0029146739\n\n#reference The authors prefer to use cognitive ability instead of intelligence.\n\n[‘The Bell Curve’ 20 years later: A Q & A with Charles Murray. interview\n\n[een scan van het hele boek: https://lesacreduprintemps19.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/the-bell-curve.pdf ]\n\nHere are six conclusions regarding tests of cognitive ability, drawn from the classical tradition, that are by now beyond significant technical dispute:\n\nThere is such a thing as a general factor of cognitive ability on which human beings differ.\n\nAll standardized tests of academic aptitude or achievement measure this general factor to some degree, but IQ tests expressly designed for that purpose measure it most accurately.\n\nIQ scores match, to a first degree, whatever it is that people mean when they use the word intelligent or smart in ordinary language.\n\nIQ scores are stable, although not perfectly so, over much of a person’s life.\n\nProperly administered IQ tests are not demonstrably biased against social, economic, ethnic, or racial groups.\n\nCognitive ability is substantially heritable, apparently no less than 40 percent and no more than 80 percent.\n\nThe bell curve, p. 22-23\n\nThe six points illustrate the mainstream position of especially American psychologists studying differences in intelligence. It is by no means the case, as H&M claim, that there is no technical dispute. The dispute was already going on at the turn of the 20th century, and many of the arguments are still valid today. Developments in recent years (after 1994) add new arguments: the Flynn effect, the network approach (Van der Maas and others), research on experts (Ericsson and others). Remark that nowhere do H&M refer to cognitive science: their treatment of intelligence is in terms of individual differences as measured by tests of cognitive ability in the (school) population. This individual differences frame is contingent on our (school) culture. In the field of education, contemporary folk conceptions of intelligence are derived from the psychological dogmatism of, e.g., Edward Thorndike: intelligence does exist, it is a stable characteristic of the individual, therefore it must be genetic in origin.\n\n@ 1: Yes, there is a positive manifold of cognitive abilities.\n\n@ 2. Yes. I’d rather not call tests ‘measurements of this general factor’, though. @ 3. Yes. And that is a serious problem because what is reflected in ordinary language is folk psychology. Scientific psychology surely should not be folk psychology clad as pseudoscientific psychology. @ 4. This simply is not true. Education will make a difference. Environments make for differences, therefore changes in the environment will effect IQ scores. @ 5. IQ tests not biased? Come on. The APA Standards warn for bias! @ 6: The main question: small genetic differences get amplified in environmental dynamics. Heritability coefficients should not include those dynamics.\n\nSee also Jay Joseph 2024: 'The Bell Curveat 30: A Closer Look at the Within-and Between-Group IQ Genetic Evidence' https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/jz7ku.\n\nArthur I.

First, unlike other characteristics of the individual, DNA variants can predict individual differences in adult behaviour from birth. Second, unlike other correlations, associations between DNA variants and behaviour are causal from DNA to behaviour in the sense that there can be no backward causation from behaviour to DNA. These unique features will put genomic prediction of cognitive traits in the front line of the DNA revolution.\n\nCecile Janssens: \"Researchers also have a stunning explanation for why DNA is a causal predictor of education attainment: correlation = causation, if there is no way back.\" thread\n\nA critical review here by @stevepittelli"
