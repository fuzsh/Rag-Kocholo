        "text": "Intrinsic factors\n\nThe various types of intra-tumor heterogeneity are generated by different mechanisms, which can be categorized as cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic (Figure 1). Intrinsic mechanisms are cell-inherent or cell-autonomous. The most well-known and extensively studied intrinsic driving force of cancer cell heterogeneity is genomic instability. Genomic alterations, which occur in the pathways of nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, DNA mismatch repair, telomere maintenance, double-strand break repair, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation7, lead to extensive and stochastic changes across the entire genome. Recently, a large-scale mutational landscape study by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrated that cancer cells have much higher somatic mutation rates, ranging from 0.28 to 8.15 mutations per megabase in 12 major cancer types, compared to normal cells, which have approximately 10-9mutations per base pair per division48. Given the size of the human diploid genome (∼6 billion base pairs), the potential for the development of stochastic genomic mutations over the course of tumor development is vast, even without an elevated mutation rate49. Indeed, the average frequency of non-synonymous gene mutations per tumor has been reported to be in the range of 150–17050, which distribute across individual cancer cells within a tumor.\n\nRecent evidence has shown that genetic mutations are not the only intrinsic factors of intra-tumor heterogeneity, and epigenetic changes also play an important role. The epigenetic changes are defined as stable or heritable changes in genetic information without any changes in DNA sequences. A hierarchical composition of tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cells in multiple human cancers, including AML, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), GBM, CRC, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer51,52,53 has been demonstrated. The subpopulations of cancer cells within a tumor with increased tumor-initiating capacities and self-renewal potential are often termed “cancer stem cells (CSCs)”. Studies on CSCs suggest that a small number of cells in a tumor undergo epigenetic changes, similar to the differentiation of normal stem cells, to form phenotypically diverse non-tumorigenic cells that compose the bulk of the cells in a tumor. Although there is still no consensus regarding whether cancers arise from normal stem cells or whether there is a strict hierarchy or bidirectional plasticity between the differentiation and dedifferentiation states, most cancer biologists accept that at any given time in any type of cancer, there are populations of cells with self-renewal and tumor-initiating properties, which are simplified as stem-like cancer cells. Certain cancers, such as some germ cell cancers and some leukemias, have been recognized to contain a strict hierarchy of tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cells54,55,56, suggesting possible epigenetic contributions to the differential cancer phenotypes. Direct evidence of differences in epigenetic changes between tumor subpopulations have also emerged. In AML, stem-like and non-stem-like cancer cells differ in their histone modification patterns (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3)57. Similar observations have been reported in GBMs, in which the tumorigenic cell populations exhibit aberrant activation of multiple transcription factors because of a loss of the polycomb mark H3K27me3 from their promoters58. The activated expression of one of these transcription factors, referred to as ASCL1, causes the activation of the Wnt pathway, which is required for the maintenance of the stem-like state of the cells. The epigenetic aberrations, at least in DNA methylation, occur in a chaotic shifting fashion from the very early stages of tumorigenesis59. The error rate for stochastic gain or loss of methylation has been estimated at 2×10-5 per CpG site per division in cancer cells60. The widespread loss of DNA methylation seem to be quite random and nonclonal, suggesting that at least some of the epigenome changes occur stochastically and are maintained during tumor progression4.\n\nDifferential gene expression is also a cause of intra-tumor heterogeneity. Plastic switching of the cellular state has been documented in several recent studies3,61. Certain cell surface antigens in fractions of cancer cells undergo changes in a reversible fashion based on tumorigenic assays and during drug treatment, indicating a mechanism of transient changes in gene expression other than the stable changes of epigenetic alteration. Indeed, experiments at single-cell resolution have elegantly demonstrated the stochastic gene expression as a fundamental nature of cells to cope with environmental changes, which is a phenomenon that is conserved from phage and bacteria to mammalian cells, including cancer cells62,63,64,65. An extreme example is that two genetically identical sister cells that divided from the same ancestor cell express differential amounts of cell death pathway proteins, leading to distinct cell fates in response to the same death stimuli66.\n\nIn addition to gene expression, the differential signal transduction may also contribute to the intra-tumor heterogeneity, although much fewer studies have been focused on this topic. The heterogeneous activation of proliferation-related proteins has also been reported38,67. There are two possible underlying mechanisms. One is the de novo stochasticity of enzymatic reactions in signal transduction, similar to other biochemical processes such as transcription. At the microscopic level, every protein modification chemical reaction is discrete, ie, not continuous. Although the copy numbers of the signaling proteins in a cell could be in the thousands, which greatly reduce the fluctuation of signal transduction at the macroscopic level, the number of proteins that are functional for signaling might still be small due to their sub-cellular locations. Thus, cell-to-cell signaling variation may occur due to the intrinsic stochasticity of biochemical reactions between signaling proteins. It has been shown that the biological noise can be amplified in the signal transduction cascades, and cells evolve signaling motifs, such as negative feedback loops, to attenuate the signaling noise68,69. Aberrations in the negative feedback modules, eg, mutations in protein phosphatases and protein degradation systems, are frequently observed in cancers. It would be interesting to investigate the influence of these aberrations on the cell-to-cell variation in the corresponding signaling pathways.\n\nThe other mechanism that may contribute to the heterogeneous protein modification is that some signals, eg, ERK activation, can be transduced in a digital oscillation or pulse-like manner, and individual cells are at different paces of the pulse70,71. Theoretically, the heterogeneity of signal transductions could be functional, considering that evolutionary selection operates on phenotypes, both stable and transient, but not on genotypes. To understand the detailed mechanisms and possible functions of the heterogeneous signal transduction processes, careful measurements of signaling dynamics in live cells should be performed in single cell-based experiments by using sensitive probes70,71,72,73,74,75,76. However, direct test of signaling dynamics in primary tumors is still technically infeasible.\n\nTaken together, the intra-tumor heterogeneity may originate from four mechanisms: genetic variation, epigenetic alteration, plastic gene expression, and signal transduction. It is important to note that even in cancers that clearly contain a hierarchy of tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cells or in cancers that are highly plastic in their phenotypic transitions, these four sources of intra-tumor heterogeneity coexist. Furthermore, they could contribute either independently, due to stochastic variations, or interactively to form the differential phenotypes of cancer cells within a tumor. For example, the gene mutations implicated in chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation dynamics could cause aberrant epigenome reprogramming in cancer cells77. The point mutations in the EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and PI3K genes could transform the gene products into constitutively active forms, and thus lead to the alterations in signal transduction6. Vice versa, the variations in signal transduction and gene expression could also lead to variations in genetic and epigenetic changes. For example, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) signaling could induce genetic instability by transcriptionally down-regulating the base-mismatch protein MutSa78 or could induce genomic DNA demethylation in CpG islands by transcriptionally increasing the methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A)79. Therefore, it is important to integrate all experimental approaches to fully understand the alterations at all levels and their distinctive roles in tumor progression.\n\nExtrinsic factors\n\nThe extrinsic causes of intra-tumor heterogeneity include the components of the surrounding microenvironment that act on the cancer cells to influence their genotypes and phenotypes. In other words, the extrinsic factor-mediated heterogeneity originates from the spatial differences of the cancer cells (Figure 1). Multiple factors contribute to the unequal microenvironment. The most obvious example is the tumor's blood supply80. Through blood vessels, nutrients, growth factors, and oxygen are delivered, and metabolic waste is removed. The normal vascular network has a well-organized architecture, which provides nutrients by diffusion to all normal cells. In contrast, tumor blood vessels are dilated, saccular, tortuous and heterogeneously distributed81,82. Variation in the distances from individual cancer cells to the vasculature leads to differential trophic supply and metabolic status of the cancer cells. Hypovascular regions, which are located far from the blood vessels, become chronically hypoxic and acidic. Moreover, high-resolution intravital microscopy has revealed that some of the blood vessels in solid tumors carry almost no oxygen, indicating that the functioning of tumor blood vessels is also abnormal83. Both the structural and functional abnormalities of tumor blood vessels generate different microenvironments within tumors. This inequality may lead to heterogeneous signal transduction, gene expression, and genomic instability in cancer cells either directly through systemically supplied growth factors or hormones, or indirectly through oxidative stress, hypoxia, or acidosis84. In particular, it has been reported that the vasculature can provide a specialized growth niche for stem-like cancer cells in brain tumors. It has been reported that CD133+/Nestin+ cells of GBMs, medulloblastomas, ependymomas and oligodendrogliomas were located in close proximity to tumor capillaries. The self-renewal and proliferation properties of these cancer stem-like cells were maintained in culture using factors secreted by endothelial cells85. In addition to endothelial cells, other stromal cells including fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, and pluripotent mesenchymal cells, also contribute to the diversified genotypes and phenotypes of cancer cells through the secretion of cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, which in turn play a role in chemoattracting stromal cells including endothelial cells and inflammatory cells, further influencing the microenvironment and diversifying the cancer cells86.\n\nInteractions between intrinsic and extrinsic factors during tumor evolution\n\nThe generation of intra-tumor heterogeneity by the interactions between intrinsic and extrinsic factors can be illustrated using the clonal evolution model, in which stochastic genetic changes during cancer development create a pool of cells with different genetic alterations and different growth potentials, but only the cancer cells that acquired the growth potentials to fit the surrounding environmental niches demonstrate growth87. In many types of cancers, such as non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ccRCC, genetically distinct subclones in different tumor regions have been identified88,89. The spatial and temporal mapping of tumor samples also provided evidence of branched evolution of subclones across multiple cancer types. It is clear that some early somatic mutational events occur on the trunk of a tumor's phylogenetic tree, whereas the later subclonal events occur on its branches. For instance, TP53 mutations have been generally found to be early events in breast cancer, NSCLC, esophageal adenocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer, indicating a common environmental selection for tumor-initiating TP53 mutation, whereas subclonal diversification was found to be occur in a tissue-specific manner90. For example, the BRCA2 mutation in breast cancer, the HGF and MLL3 mutations in NSCLC, and the PIK3CA, CTNNB1 and NF1 mutations in ovarian cancer were found to be late events to support the tumor maintenance and progression under specific tissue environments. Interestingly, some subclonal cancer cells could cooperate with each other to promote tumor progression. In GBMs, a low-frequency EGFRvIII-containing subpopulation of cancer cells was found to enhance the activation of the wild-type EGFR in adjacent cancer cells to facilitate the growth of the major clones through an interleukin 6 and leukemia inhibitory factor paracrine mechanism91. These studies demonstrated the interactions of the intrinsic stochastic gene mutations and extrinsic growth selection factors in the evolution of the intra-tumor heterogeneity and their functions in tumor development.\n\nOur knowledge on the clonal evolution of epigenetic alterations is very limited despite the fact that epigenetic changes are prevalent through every step of tumor progression92. Theoretically, epigenetic changes, especially DNA methylation, are heritable and can directly influence gene expression, thereby contributing to clonal selection to create intra-tumor heterogeneity. Given that DNA demethylation is quite widespread and nonclonal and the methylation in specific promoter regions is far more clonal, possible environmental selection based on random epigenetic changes during tumor evolution may occur93. In another aspect, the environmental cues may not only select but also induce the epigenetic changes. Evidence has emerged that chronic inflammation is key for initiating progressive chromatin epigenetic alterations in the very early stages of tumor progression, most likely from the premalignant stages94. Although the detailed mechanisms of how epigenetic changes and environmental factors cooperate to function in tumor progression remain elusive, a reasonable hypothesis has recently been proposed on the basis of experimental evidence92. In this hypothesis, when cells are subject to stress, protein complexes consisting of polycomb group (PcG) proteins and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) quickly and transiently move into the promoter and CpG islands to protect these promoter regions from errors of DNA damage repair if transcription continues. During continued environmental insults, such as chronic inflammation, genes with specific chromatin patterns, eg, PcG marks, are kept at low levels of transcription, and the retention of the above protein complexes on the associated promoters induces abnormal DNA methylation in a time-dependent manner. If the abnormal DNA methylation silences the stem-cell-related genes, then the plasticity of cell state transitions will change and will either increase or decrease depending on the specific genes that are influenced. Reduced plasticity may help the outgrowth of stem-like cells, whereas increased plasticity may promote the emergence of heterogeneous subclones. This hypothesis provides a possible mechanism to explain how chromatin alterations may help to fix tumor phenotypes and contribute to intra-tumor heterogeneity during cancer development.\n\nImplications of intra-tumor heterogeneity for cancer treatment\n\nOne of the clinical implications of intra-tumor heterogeneity is drug resistance. Functionally, cell-to-cell variability, either genetically or non-genetically, can compromise cellular responses to cancer therapies by increasing the repertoire of possible cellular responses and hence increasing the adaptive nature of cellular behaviors. Substantial evidence has demonstrated a correlation between intra-tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic outcomes. In a study of early-stage NSCLCs, primary tumors from patients with relapsed disease exhibited significantly larger subclonally diversified genotypes than tumors from patients with relapse-free tumors95. A single-cell exploration of GBMs revealed that proneural tumors with more diverse transcriptionally defined subclones were associated with poorer outcomes96.\n\nSeveral mechanisms may contribute to the drug resistance in heterogeneous cancers. First, genotypic heterogeneity clearly confer drug resistance under certain circumstances. Targeted anti-cancer drugs, such as kinase inhibitors, specifically act on the subpopulation of cells with mutated oncogenes that they target, leaving other subpopulations without corresponding mutations unaffected. The pre-existing untargeted subclones may expand and maintain tumor progression after the drug treatment8,10,97. A very recent study on breast cancers demonstrated that resistance to chemotherapy and the acquisition of metastases could be caused by detectable subclones with different somatic DNA variations in the primary tumor42. These observations suggest that clonally dominant events are not necessarily more important in function than the minor subclonal lesions. A similar scenario has been observed in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), in which the presence of the driver mutations was the key determinant of the disease outcome, regardless of their clonal status98. The Deciphering Anti-tumor Response With Intratumor Heterogeneity (DARWIN, NCT02183883) trial has been launched, and it is aimed at assessing whether targeting a clonally dominant driver mutation results in improved progression free survival compared to targeting the same driver mutation when it is present in a minor subclone99. The hypothetical implication of the heterogeneous genotype on therapeutics includes either concurrent combination or sequential treatment with multiple driver mutation-targeting agents. For example, in NSCLC cells, MET amplification in certain cells is considered one of the mechanisms for the resistance to EGFR inhibitors100. The combination of a MET inhibitor and a EGFR inhibitor exhibited better efficacy than either of the individual compounds101.\n\nSecond, the population of tumorigenic cells within a tumor is intrinsically resistant to certain therapies, especially cytotoxic chemoradiotherapies. For example, the enrichment of tumorigenic cells in CRC, breast cancer, and GBMs has been observed after irradiation or cyclophosphamide treatment2. Lower levels of reactive oxygen species and the activation of ATM-dependent DNA-damage repair in these tumorigenic cells may explain the therapeutic resistance. However, whether the genetic or epigenetic changes contribute to the resistance of tumorigenic cells requires further investigation. Epigenetic therapies, such as small molecules that regulate DNA methylation and histone deacetylation or target other chromatin regulatory proteins have the potential to prevent or reverse treatment resistance102.\n\nThird, stochastic gene expression or signal transduction-mediated cell plasticity may lead to differential cell fate determination and thus contribute to drug resistance. The fate of daughter cells derived from the same mother cell seemed to be independent of each other following the exposure to antimitotic drugs103. Strategies to overcome this resistance will not be as straightforward as targeting genetic or epigenetic sources of resistance. Studies in this field have just recently been performed. Investigating whether and how environmental conditions eliminate or control heterogeneous cancer cells hold the potential to inform novel anti-cancer strategies."
