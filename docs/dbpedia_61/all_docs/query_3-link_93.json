In view of well known hereditary and species-specific differences in birdsong, courtship, and agonistic display, as well as other forms of animal communication, it is an interesting question whether the expectation of hereditary factors in man's unique form of communication is supported by any evidence. Research into this question may be divided into three broad categories, dealing with voice, with speech, and with language. A brief summary of findings in each area follows. No mention will be made of any research in animal communication, nor will any linguistic research, or developmental psycholinguistics, be discussed. Voice. The human voice is classified into six types: bass, baritone, and tenor in the adult male; and contralto, mezzo-soprano, and soprano in the adult female and in children . It is the first harmonic, otherwise pitch, that defines the vocal ranges, with the speaking voice at its lower end, as is shown by the small crossbars in the middle section of Figure 1, which displays the average vocal ranges and the registers for these six types of voices in trained singers (Nadoleczny 1923). Untrained voices have much smaller ranges; these are shown in the upper and lower sections of the same figure. 169 SLS 15 (1977), 169-182 @ William C. Stokoe 1977 Sign Language Studies 15 'I III Figure 1. Vocal ranges for normal male and female voices (top and bottom of figure), and for trained singers (central section). There is some correlation of type of voice with body type, basses being generally shorter and more stocky. Zimmerman (1938) measured the length of the vocal cords in professional singers with the following results: basses 24-25mm, baritones 21-27mm, tenors 18-20mm, contraltos 18-19mm, mezzo-sopranos 18-21mm, and sopranos 14-17mm. The size of the resonating cavities, particularly the larynx, also plays a role. Large resonating cavities lower the voice, while small ones raise it. One can also change the pitch of the voice for a brief period by inhaling an inert gas like helium, because the density of the gas in the vocal passages is a factor in the resonance. The two extremes, bass and soprano, may be regarded as most typical for each sex, with the in between voices corresponding to less sex differentiation. This can be seen particularly in abnormal cases. Virilization in women leads to exceptionally low voices, while under-development of the gonads leads to abnormally high male voices, such as the male soprano in castrati. In addition, there is wide variation in individual ranges. Vandenberg As may be expected from the dependence of voice on anatomical features, the pitch of the voice is to a considerable extent determined by hereditary factors. This has been established through the comparison of identical (MZ) and fraternal (DZ) twins by Schilling (1936, 1950), Seeman (1937), Gedda (et al. 1960), and Luchsinger (1940, 1944, 1959). The twin method is an economical way of checking whether a voice character has an appreciable hereditary component, but it does not permit determination of the mode of inheritance, i.e. whether single locus or multifactorial, dominant or recessive, or other. Bernstein and Schlafer (1922) and Bernstein (1925) have proposed that the three male and the three female voice types are genetic entities determined by a single set of alleles. If so, in a male, a bass would be the result of AA, in a female, a soprano voice. In males, a baritone would result from Aa, but in females a mezzo-soprano; and in tenors and contraltos the allele set aa would be found. Luchsinger found some support for this simple theory. In addition, Gedda (et al. 1960) found that only 13 percent of MZ twins could recognize the voice of their twin, while 78 percent of DZ twins could do so, suggesting a high degree of hereditary control. Further work will require more precise anatomical measurements, which are difficult to obtain, or will need to rely on analysis through spectograms; e.g. Figures 2 and 3 show the comparison of narrow and broad band voice prints of two pairs of identical twins. Another way of studying hereditary factors is through studies of..."
