        "text": "Hermann (1908) said of psychology that it had a long past, but only a short history. The same may be said of behavior genetics. One cannot specify an exact date at which behavior genetics came to be regarded as a distinct scientific discipline, but for convenience let us say 1960, the publication date of Fuller and Thompson’s textbook of that title. This chapter considers both the long past and some aspects of the short history of behavior genetics. We begin with the long past: the recognition since antiquity that behavioral traits are in part inherited, and the controversy concerning the extent to which this is so, a discussion often going under the label of the nature–nurture controversy.\n\nA large body of evidence from behavior genetic designs (twins, adoptions, etc.) leads to a somewhat surprising conclusion: For many important behavioral traits in adulthood, c 2, the effect on siblings of having shared a family environment as children, is close to zero. The value of c 2 assessed early in life while the siblings are still sharing the family environment is, however, appreciable. Such findings raise the question of whether factors such as the imitation of parents or sharing childhood peers have lasting effects on personality and abilities. I discuss some exceptions to the generalization c 2 = 0, and I offer advice on research strategies to clarify matters further.\n\nView"
