        "text": "1 INTRODUCTION\n\nCoastal marine ecosystems are experiencing major alterations in oceanic conditions associated with climate change, including warming, acidification, sea-level rise, increased stratification and subsequent decline in dissolved oxygen, increased wave power, and changes in local and regional ocean circulation patterns (Alheit & Bakun, 2010; Bindoff et al., 2019; Brierley & Kingsford, 2009; Doney et al., 2012; Keeling et al., 2010; Narayan et al., 2010; Reguero et al., 2019). Furthermore, extreme events resulting in rapid changes in environmental conditions, such as El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and marine heatwaves, are becoming more frequent and intense (Freund et al., 2019; Frölicher & Laufkötter, 2018; Oliver et al., 2018). These large-scale agents of disturbance can result in short- and long-term modifications of community structure and can be particularly disruptive when multiple ecological factors are affected. For example, elevated ocean temperature can result in local extirpations, species range shifts, altered ecosystem functioning and changes in biotic interactions (Harley et al., 2006; Sanford et al., 2019). These impacts can be compounded by other factors associated with marine heatwaves, such as harmful algal blooms or disruption of upwelling intensity and duration (Bograd et al., 2009; Harley et al., 2006).\n\nAssessing and mitigating change in ecological communities resulting from a rapidly changing climate necessitates a broadly applicable and mechanistically sound understanding of the factors influencing ecological stability. Recent studies investigating the mechanistic drivers of ecological stability have greatly advanced the field and clarified the terminology used to describe the components of stability (Donohue et al., 2013, 2016; Grimm & Wissel, 1997; Hodgson et al., 2015; Ingirsch & Bahn, 2018; Ives & Carpenter, 2007). However, due to the logistical constraints of carrying out large-scale, long-term experimental efforts, these studies tend to be limited in spatial and/or temporal scale (e.g. Donohue et al., 2013; Grman et al., 2010; Hillebrand et al., 2018), simplistic in terms of community complexity (Hillebrand et al., 2018; Wittebolle et al., 2009), or are primarily theoretical in nature (Arnoldi et al., 2016). Because investigation of a single component in isolation can result in an underestimation of the potential for perturbation to alter ecological stability, and because there is evidence of strong correlation among many components of ecological stability, a more integrated approach is required (Donohue et al., 2013; Hillebrand et al., 2018; Kéfi et al., 2019). To achieve a more complete understanding of the key drivers of ecological stability, particularly those operating at large scales, patterns of association between identified mechanisms and community change must be examined broadly, through temporally and geographically expansive surveys (Hawkins et al., 2009; Underwood et al., 2000; Witman et al., 2015). Geographically broad, long-term ecological community monitoring surveys can provide important ‘natural experiment’ data that can be used to link variation in environmental conditions or natural or anthropogenic disturbance to community change (e.g. Croll et al., 2005; Rogers et al., 2012).\n\nUnderstanding how disturbance impacts long-term stability of a system at the community composition level, utilizing data that include both species' diversity and relative abundance/evenness, has long been a goal of ecological stability research (e.g. Grman et al., 2010; Hillebrand et al., 2008). However, achieving this goal can be challenging for both logistical and analytical reasons. Assessing community composition (as opposed to tracking changes in a single species) requires researchers to have a high level of taxonomic expertise, consistency in species identification across space and time, and resources to support long-term studies. The Multi-Agency Rocky Intertidal Network (MARINe) was formed in 1997 to support the collection of taxonomically complex, long-term, quantitative community monitoring data from temperate rocky intertidal shores spanning the west coast of North America. Previous work using this broad-scale dataset has examined possible links between marine heatwave events and disease events affecting population trends for single species (sea stars, Miner et al., 2018; abalone, Raimondi et al., 2002). These efforts revealed mixed results in terms of linking water temperature to impact of disease on populations (temperature and disease impact were highly correlated for black abalone, but not for ochre sea stars). However, considerable spatial structure was observed in the patterns of impact, with more extreme declines in species' abundance in southern than in northern regions. Because temperate rocky intertidal communities are both highly diverse and at high risk of disruption from climate change, particularly at lower latitudes (Doney et al., 2012; Hawkins et al., 2008; Hobday & Pecl, 2014; Howard et al., 2013), we were interested in broadening our investigation to explore whether change at the whole-community level was correlated with marine heat events. The broad geographical and temporal scope of the MARINe study—spanning two ENSO events (2009–2010 and 2015–2016) and an unprecedented marine heatwave event that stretched from Alaska, USA to Baja California, Mexico from 2014 to 2016 (Cavole et al., 2016)—provided an excellent opportunity to examine spatial patterns of change and stability. In this study, we specifically examined long-term patterns of ecological stability (defined as the absence of change over time in a composite metric incorporating species diversity and relative abundance) at the community level, hereafter referred to as ‘community stability’.\n\nHere, we use an approach based on a multivariate assessment of similarity to achieve a comprehensive, long-term assessment of community stability. We used the results from this analysis to examine local (site) and regional scale patterns of community stability and identify potential drivers of community change. Specifically, we asked the following questions: (a) Is there an association between community stability and water temperature, and if so, do these associations exhibit regional patterns? and (b) Is there a positive relationship between stability and three general attributes of biodiversity commonly identified as important for community stability: species richness, diversity and evenness? The results of these initial analyses prompted an investigation of a less well-studied component of community stability: species dominance. Numerous studies have demonstrated a link between evenness of species abundances and community stability, concluding that higher evenness allows for functional redundancy and thus a more stable community. However, a handful of investigations have shown either no association between community stability and evenness (Isbell et al., 2009) or a link between increased stability and low evenness values, driven by the presence of one or a handful of dominant species (e.g. Grman et al., 2010; Valdivia et al., 2013). Our results suggested a similar pattern, and thus motivated a final question: Is there a relationship between community stability and persistence in cover of the mussel, Mytilus californianus, a spatially dominant foundation species within the community (Dayton, 1972; Seed & Suchanek, 1992; Suchanek, 1992)?\n\n7 DISCUSSION\n\nLong-term, geographically expansive community monitoring surveys play a critical role in assessing how well predictions from experiments and theory explain patterns at broad spatial and temporal scales. A rapidly changing climate requires that we identify meaningful benchmarks against which we can assess ecological shift, and that we work to develop truly comprehensive multivariate assessments of community-level change (Petes et al., 2014). In this study, we examined long-term community stability of rocky intertidal systems utilizing an analytical approach that is applicable to a wide variety of ecosystems. Our findings from this broad-scale, long-term investigation indicate that for ecosystems structured around foundation species, high species diversity and low evenness (driven in part by a high abundance of foundation species) can be complimentary predictors of long-term community stability and can aid in forecasting how communities will respond to disturbance, such as that resulting from climate change.\n\n7.1 Role of temperature\n\nOcean temperature can be an important and geographically broad driving agent of disturbance. Our data support a strong association between community change and periods of anomalously warm water conditions in all four regions, collectively spanning over 16 degrees of latitude, with particularly striking levels of change in the southern, warmer regions (Figures 2, 3 and 5). This large-scale pattern may foreshadow substantial changes in marine communities, as more extreme and longer-lasting warm water events are occurring at an increasingly frequent rate with a changing climate (Oliver et al., 2018). The models we used to explore associations between temperature metrics and community change indicated that across all regions, warmer water temperatures were associated with a decline in community similarity compared to the benchmark year (Table 2). This correlation is linear, with small temperature changes corresponding to small shifts in community similarity and large temperature changes corresponding to large shifts, suggesting a pattern of incremental change rather than one resulting from tipping points (Figure 5). An unexpected finding was that abnormally high minimum annual temperatures (the coldest 10% of a year's SST) appeared to hold the most explanatory power. This result merits further investigation. In terrestrial systems, climate-change-induced shifts in phenology can result in plant–pollinator, plant–herbivore or predator–prey mismatches, or mistiming of annual life cycles that can have population or ecosystem-level impacts (e.g. Renner & Zohner, 2018; Visser & Gienapp, 2019). Examples of phenological mismatches also exist within marine systems, although research has thus far focused primarily on disruption of trophic interactions (e.g. Bograd et al., 2009; Schmeller et al., 2018). It is likely that rocky intertidal organisms that demonstrate seasonal patterns of growth, feeding and reproduction (Lewis, 1964) might pay a cost for mistimed metabolic or reproductive efforts resulting from spurious temperature cues. Warmer than average sea surface temperatures during typically cool water periods might also be indicative of a relaxation of upwelling during periods when this process, which brings cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface, is typically strong. A relaxation of upwelling can translate to lower nutrient availability and increased delivery of propagules, both of which can result in significant community change (Bograd et al., 2009).\n\n7.2 Spatial patterns of community stability\n\nUnlike storm events, where damage tends to be patchy within and among sites (Fabricius et al., 2008), warm water events can be spatially pervasive, affecting broad stretches of coastline. Our analysis suggests that while the general long-term trajectory (decline) of community similarity values in rocky intertidal communities was similar along the entire west coast of North America, the magnitude of decline, and hence implications for community stability, varied greatly among regions. On the southern mainland and Channel Islands, the impact on community stability resulting from large-scale environmental perturbation in the form of elevated water temperature events was more severe than in the central and northern regions. Our results suggest that the composition of communities in the two southern regions is shifting in a direction that less and less resembles communities at these sites from just over a decade ago. During the extreme marine heatwave event of 2014–2016, community composition shifted towards increased cover of bare rock as well as warm-water-tolerant species such as Tetraclita rubescens and Chondracanthus canaliculatus, and decreased cover of the foundation species, Mytilus californianus (Figure 3a,b). Hobday and Pecl (2014) identified the southern California, USA to Baja California, Mexico region as one of the several areas where ocean temperatures are rising at rates among the fastest on the planet. They argue that these ‘marine hotspots’ should be used as windows into the future for other regions, and we should focus on studies aimed at developing effective management and adaptation measures in these ‘hotspots’. Our data highlight the potential risk to intertidal communities in this region and we echo this call for more studies that closely examine southern California rocky intertidal communities for clues to the conditions or mechanisms that affect long-term stability.\n\n7.3 Interpreting diversity metrics in systems with spatially dominant species\n\nA primary focus of conservation ecology has been understanding the link between species diversity and ecosystem stability (Loreau & Mazancourt, 2013; Tilman et al., 2014). Large bodies of data show strong relationships between community stability and both richness and evenness (Shade, 2017; Wilsey & Polley, 2004; Wittebolle et al., 2009). High species richness may increase chances of functional redundancy such that decline or loss of one species can be buffered by the presence of other species with similar community roles (Schmera & Erős, 2012; Wohl et al., 2004). Under fluctuating environmental conditions, species-rich communities may be stabilized by asynchronous responses of species within the same functional group (Loreau & Mazancourt, 2013). Within functionally redundant groups of species, high evenness has been found to increase the likelihood that ecosystem function will remain intact through environmental fluctuations (Wittebolle et al., 2009).\n\nOur data indicate that in the open coast rocky intertidal ecosystem, there is a negative relationship between community stability and evenness. While this finding is counter to the most prevalent expectation that lower evenness should result in decreased stability (Wittebolle et al., 2009), it supports the findings of a handful of studies that found the reverse to be true. In these examples, one or a few stable dominant species were associated with increased overall community stability (Grman et al., 2010). Most intertidal systems are heavily influenced by foundation species (Angelini et al., 2011; Dayton, 1972; Ellison, 2019) which are, by definition, abundant and ‘disproportionally important to the continued maintenance of community structure’ (Dayton, 1972). Persistence of a foundation species therefore by definition stabilizes the local community (Lamy et al., 2020), and because of their abundance, drives down evenness values. In systems structured around a single, spatially dominant foundation species, in the absence of functional redundancy, changes in abundance of this species can have large impacts on community attributes (Lamy et al., 2020). This is the case with the mussel, M. californianus, a foundation species found on rocky shores across all biogeographical provinces represented in this study (Dayton, 1972; Smith et al., 2006). While other mussels co-occur with M. californianus, the only candidate for functional redundancy in terms of individual size and abundance is the congener Mytilus trossulus. However, compared to M. californianus, M. trossulus is almost always much less common and exhibits more temporally variable abundance on exposed coastal shores, in part due to its high susceptibility to predation (Menge et al., 1994; Sanford & Worth, 2010). It also has lower thermal tolerance than M. californianus in both air and water (Dowd & Somero, 2013). Thus, a replacement for declining M. californianus populations is unlikely and, where this critical species declines, substantial community-level change is all but certain.\n\nIn this study, we used non-destructive sampling methods that did not capture changes in the interstitial community within the mussel beds—those species directly dependent on M. californianus for habitat, food or protection from predation or physical stress (Suchanek, 1992). Instead, we examined the stabilizing role of mussels within the broader community of species attached to the primary substrate. Our data suggest that in systems containing spatially dominant foundation species, traditional interpretation of diversity indices that incorporate both community-level richness and evenness might not be appropriate for predicting long-term community stability. While species richness does appear to be linked to long-term community stability, the pattern for evenness is likely the opposite for systems dominated by one or a few species, and low evenness values can indicate an abundant and stable presence of spatially dominant foundation species. Because several of the planet's most important marine ecosystems (e.g. oyster beds, kelp forests, coral reefs, seagrasses, mangroves: reviewed in Angelini et al., 2011; Ellison, 2019) are structured around single foundation species that are sensitive to ocean warming, acidification and other effects of climate change (Gaylord et al., 2015; Wernberg et al., 2016), prospects for long-term stability in these ecosystems might be low.\n\n7.4 Community succession and stability\n\nOne of the conclusions from this study—that as a spatially dominant foundation species in rocky intertidal communities, mussels exert an important stabilizing force on community structure over time—is an idea that was first demonstrated by the extensive work exploring succession and stability of climax communities 40 years ago (e.g. Connell & Slatyer, 1977; Paine & Levin, 1981; Sousa, 1984). Our work expands upon these canonical studies by assessing contrasting predictions of two fundamental categories of models of community stability: (a) a stable climax community is less rich than communities in earlier stages of succession (e.g. intermediate disturbance hypothesis, Sousa, 1979) and (b) communities with high diversity are more stable than communities with low diversity (e.g. diversity stability hypothesis; e.g. Ives & Carpenter, 2007). Our results show that both high species richness and mussel cover were associated with increased community stability in temperate rocky intertidal systems (Figure 6). In the regions that experienced greater community change (South and Channel Islands), abundance of M. californianus appeared to be more important than richness in predicting community stability, lending support to the idea that climax communities afford overall stability to a system (Figure 7a). By contrast, in regions where mussel cover remained generally high (i.e. in which climax communities are common; North and Central regions), species richness appeared to be more important for predicting community stability (Figure 7b). Thus, elements of both types of community stability models were supported, though the relative strength of support varied regionally.\n\n7.5 Concluding remarks\n\nHere we examined the relationship between temporal shifts in community composition and sea water temperature over a large spatial scale. However, we do not assert that water temperature is the only potential driver of community change. Because it is relatively inexpensive and simple to monitor, sea water temperature is currently the only factor consistently measured on a broad scale for intertidal ecosystems (although important gaps exist). High priority should be placed on designing and implementing inexpensive, simple methods for measuring other key factors known to influence species' distributions and survivorship, such as sea water pH, wave climate, humidity, air temperature, organismal body temperature and prevalence of fog. Combining reliable, high-frequency and spatially explicit data for these key physical factors with long-term biological monitoring data from programmes such as MARINe will give us the most power to detect and potentially mitigate community shifts (Petes et al., 2014).\n\nIn the face of a changing climate and accompanying ecological uncertainty, management agencies are challenged to create forward-looking plans, which can effectively address the local impacts of regional or global phenomena (Petes et al., 2014; Rilov et al., 2019). The ability to identify factors that contribute broadly to community stability has important implications for resource management and conservation and our analysis adds to the toolbox of methods that can be used to effectively allocate management effort across time and space (Rilov et al., 2019)."
