Homotopia Festival is pleased to present a curated series of queer film shorts, available to watch on-demand throughout the festival.

Isolated Canvas by Banksie

A moment of transition, channelling support in this moment of temporary isolation through a summoning of radical queerness: a spell of self-protection.

Something in the closet by Nosa Eke

The story of Madi, a gay teenager who must come to terms with her sexuality as her desires begin to manifest themselves in unsettling ways.

One of the most beautiful experiences I’ve ever had by Colin Ginks

The public space is instrumental in the forging of our sexual essentiality, and the risks involved – particularly for nonheterosexual

individuals.

Pure by Natalie Harris

A tender queer coming-ofage story that centres Black girlhood and reminds us to believe in joy.

Nude Triumphant by Leo Crane

Jay rushes to get ready for another frantic day until a chance encounter propels him into a strange watercolour world.

The Devotions by Barry Fitzgerald

Unpicking personal experiences of religion, sexuality and growing up gay in rural Ireland. Expect house music. The Virgin Mary. Latex. And running. Directed by Mia Georgis.

Sunday 31 October, 2pm

Meet the Filmmakers

We bring together all of the filmmakers for a live panel discussion to discuss their work and the future of queer film.

The panel will be chaired by Becs Rainey, a Creative Producer from London. Becs makes commercials, music videos, docs and short films, sometimes delving into the fashion and advertising agency worlds. She is Head of Production at Girls in Film, a network which represents, champions and connects the new generation of women, non-binary and trans creatives in the film industry.

A ticket for this event includes on-demand access to all of the film shorts for the duration of the festival.
