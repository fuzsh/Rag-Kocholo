        "text": "Yoshi falls in lust with someone he met in a park bathroom while reading Frantz Fanon’s Black Skin, White Masks. Sadly, his new love interest is about to get gay married. So, Yoshi and his band of radical queers decide this wedding need not take place... Homotopia is a queer critique of the politics of ‘gay marriage’ and assimilation. Using a gritty, feminist shoot-and-run style, the film is heavily influenced by earlier political films Born in Flames and The Battle of Algiers and addresses issues of racism, colonialism, AIDS, and the role of the state.\n\nScreening with a selection of other shorts and with a discussion on the problems associated with marriage and queerness hosted by AB Silvera.\n\nAB Silvera is a writer, performer and activist. Originally from Argentina, she spent over a decade in Ireland involved in feminist activism with a focus on LGBTQ women's issues. The former editor of BoLT Magazine, Ireland's only magazine for LGBTQ women, she now hosts 30km/s on Subcity Radio, a show that looks at the issues of the day from a sardonic, radical perspective.\n\nThe films will screen with English subtitles to make them more accessible for people who are deaf or hard or hearing. There will be BSL interpretation for the introduction and discussion.\n\nPart of BFI LOVE, in partnership with Plusnet\n\nbfi.org.uk/love\""
