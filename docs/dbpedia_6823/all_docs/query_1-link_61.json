Boasting thousands of members, the organisation is the leading voice in amplifying the work of LGBT+ engineers and addressing inclusion within the engineering and construction sector. Mark then founded EqualEngineers in 2017, aiming to make the industry more diverse after seeing the challenges a lack of inclusion can bring and the risks posed to health, safety and wellbeing as a consequence. Driven by an understanding that better DE&I programmes are essential to improve performance, McBride-Wright has engaged tens of thousands of people with events, public speaking and training to ensure organisations across the sector are truly inclusive environments.\n\nKelley is Chief Executive of Stonewall, the LGBT+ human rights charity, which is part of a global movement for change where LGBT+ people everywhere are free to be themselves and can live their lives to the full.

More recently, Kelley has worked in roles focused on research and insight.
