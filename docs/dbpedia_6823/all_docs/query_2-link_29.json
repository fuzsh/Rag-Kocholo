While Page emphasizes the growing percentage of young people identifying as LGBTQ, critics point out that this demographic remains a minority within the larger population. Despite this, LGBTQ-themed movies have gained significant attention and funding in Hollywood, with several mainstream successes over the past two decades. However, some argue that the assumption that such films should automatically appeal to a wide audience is flawed, citing examples like the film \"Bros,\" which struggled at the box office despite positive reviews. Additionally, movies with LGBTQ themes are not immune to criticism, with Page's own film \"Close to You\" receiving mixed reviews. Critics caution against equating lack of interest in certain LGBTQ-themed films with homophobia, suggesting that audiences are simply not obligated to enjoy works that prioritize political messaging over artistic merit. Ultimately, the discussion raises questions about the intersection of art, politics, and audience reception in the context of LGBTQ representation in cinema.

In the 35 years since then, this day continues to commemorate the significance of #visibility and the power that has to bring about change. The language we use to describe our experiences as trans and #LGBTQ+ folx is continuously evolving, and this year we're embracing the power of exploring new ways to describe our journeys and how we share them with others. Rather than \"Coming Out,\" this year, we're celebrating the power of \"Inviting In.\" It's a reminder that sharing who you are with others is about inviting them into your truth and your story, on *your* terms. Inviting In looks different for everyone. The power of Inviting In lies in your autonomy, in choosing when, where, and how share your authentic self with the world, with certain trusted individuals, or with yourself. As we celebrate National Inviting In Day, remember that your safety and well-being always come first, and inviting others in is never an obligation or requirement. However you choose to share your story with others, you are valid, you are loved, and you are never alone. If you're exploring what Inviting In means for you, The Trevor Project has a fantastic resource that can help: https://bit.ly/3eokZN6 #NationalInvitingInDay #LGBTQ #TransRights\n\nWhy it's important to avoid saying you ‚Äúalready knew‚Äù when someone comes outüè≥Ô∏èüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚ößÔ∏è: People sometimes make such comments explicitly to mock - for example, saying \"the closet was glass\" when someone rumoured to be LGBTQIA+ discloses their identity. However, it can also be said with loving intention by people who want to reassure the person coming out that they are an ally and advocate. And for some, that reassurance is felt and appreciated. But for others, it can be invalidating. The experience of not being open about your identity to a particular person or within a certain environment can be a stressful one. Saying you ‚Äúalready knew‚Äù or ‚Äúwe already knew‚Äù can minimise that struggle and diminish the effort it often takes to share who you are with someone. Additionally, you're centering yourself in a moment that shouldn't be about you, especially if that‚Äôs your immediate first response. The person has shared who they are because they‚Äôd like your support and the freedom to be their authentic selves, not to validate your observations and assumptions. If your intention is to provide reassurance and demonstrate support, it‚Äôs more affirming to simply express that. For example, you could say, ‚ÄúThank you for sharing that with me‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for you and support you being your authentic self.‚Äù Hope this post helps - it‚Äôs day 26 of my ‚Äú30 Days Of Gay‚Äù Pride month seriesüè≥Ô∏è‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏èüåà #linkedinlearning #inclusion #pride #pridemonth #lgbtq #lgbtqia\n\nHappy #Pride Month! üåà This is me. For those who don't know, I am a proud queer/gay man, pronouns he/him/his (will respond to any used respectfully). These are my #rainbow accoutrement. üôÇ Why do I have these? I make it a goal to wear a rainbow accessory every day at work. I do this for 3 main reasons: 1. To help give a face to an underrepresented population. 2. To identify myself as a safe space for other #LGBTQIA+ individuals. 3. To show my #pride in a part of myself that some might have me hate. While this month is a time to #celebrate, it is also a time to #reflect on how far we have yet to go. LGBTQIA+ individuals are being discriminated against, attacked (both physically and politically/legally), and murdered simply for being (especially transgender individuals, especially black transgender individuals) According to various sources, the United States does not even rank in the top 10 safe places for LGBTQIA+ individuals to be in. As a country that boasts itself as the \"land of the free\" this is disgraceful. How are you celebrating Pride month? What can you do to support the LGBTQIA+ individuals in your life? #PrideMonth #Queer #Gay #LGBTQ #Diversity #DEI #Inclusion #Pride2024\n\nAt a time when the #LGBTQ community is under unprecedented cultural and political attacks, it is more important than ever to hold film studios accountable for how our community is represented on-screen. The LGBTQ characters and stories found in this year‚Äôs study would not exist without the work of talented writers, actors, directors, and crew on all levels and GLAAD firmly stands in solidarity with the SAG-AFTRA, the Writers Guild of America East - WGAE and Writers Guild of America West in their efforts and contributions to fair and accurate storytelling integral to the LGBTQ movement. It is crucial that the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) reach a fair deal with striking writers and performers ‚Äì that these talented creatives can return to work as soon as possible, so that the progress made in LGBTQ representation remains on track. LGBTQ stories told through film have a powerful and inextricable link to culture-change. With more people than ever now empowered to live authentically and openly, the cost of lost progress in LGBTQ representation on-screen means erasure. As the LGBTQ movement has always been, this is a fight and a demand to exist. Today, we released our annual Studio Responsibility Index which maps the quantity, quality and diversity of LGBTQ characters in films released by ten major motion picture studios during the 2022 calendar year.
