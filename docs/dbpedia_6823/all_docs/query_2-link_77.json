        "text": "Update 19/10/22: A message from Char at Homotopia Festival\n\nDue to filming commitments, Hanna van Vliet will no longer attend this event, as was previously advertised. ANNE+ co-creators Maud Wiemeijer and Valerie Bisscheroux, we still be attending and are travelling all the way from Amsterdam for this event. There will also be a special message from Hanna, recorded exclusively for this audience.\n\nANNE+ is a drama series about the (love)life of Anne, a twenty-something lesbian living in Amsterdam. In each episode we learn more about Anne and her past and present love interests as well as her friends, family and colleagues. It was initiated by the creators because of the lack of positive queer representation in film and television. The ANNE+ team is composed of mostly female, queer filmmakers who feel personally connected to the series and want to make a difference. What began as a crowdfunded project was soon joined by Millstreet Films and BNNVARA, then later became a Netflix film.\n\nAll the way from the Netherlands, join ANNE+ creators Maud Wiemiejer, Valerie Bisscheroux and Hanna Van Vilet (who plays Anne) for a viewing party of Episodes 1 â€“ 2, followed by a Q&A."
