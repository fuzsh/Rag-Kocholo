        "text": "Self-proclaimed future award winning documentary filmmaker Amy Pennington presents their landmark documentary series TOPS. On the question that defines trans masc experience in the UK today... “What TOP did you wanna wear after TOP surgery?”\n\nIn this profound and intimate film, Amy meets four unique individuals: a powerlifter and gay-games Olympian hopeful, a housing-officer-slash-actor, an Essex filmmaker, and an equality, diversity and inclusion-specialist-and-occasional-model. Amy's curiosity illuminates their experiences, through extraordinary unlimited access into their lives, homes, and bags of dicks. Insightful and invasive, TOPS allows audiences to fully understand the question on everyone's lips.\n\nTOPS is a genre-busting documentary (with fictionalised elements) inspired by the chaotic, brash, self-deprecating and clueless style of 1990s/2000s British TV. Presented by an ever-so-slightly desperate and lonely version of the artist Amy Pennington, who is willing to steal footwear and camp out in the gardens of interviewees for ultimate unencumbered access, and the potential of their first-ever trans friend. TOPS wants to give space to the experience of top surgery, and those that have it, without being another sad or gory story. Your nipples might fall off - but you can still have a lol.\n\nThis artwork is co-commissioned by Homotopia, Studio Voltaire and Islington Mill with funding from Arts Council England.\n\nDoors: 18:00 Screening: 18:30\n\nDoors open 30 minutes before the screening and the programme will start promptly at 18:30. Please arrive in plenty of time to help our team ensure everyone has a great experience.\n\nAfter the screening, there will be an artist talk with Amy Pennington, alongside a performance from Drag King and Boylesque performer Mark Anthony.\n\nABOUT Amy Pennington\n\nAmy Pennington (they/them) is a northerner - they think it’s important you know that. They make films, performances and collaborative projects about class, sexuality and gender. Amy has made art with their family, residents in a care home and clients at a queer hair salon. They like wearing wigs and telling stories. Their work challenges who gets to express themselves, share their experiences and under what terms. Growing up, TV was their best teacher, so using humour and pop culture come naturally. They employ these tools to gently pull at the seams of what is ‘acceptable’ or ‘normal’, whether that is critiquing the health and wellbeing industry, what kinds of Trans stories are told, or who we imagine our queer ancestors to be.\n\nAmy has made work within institutions as well as self-organised groups and in the public realm. They have been commissioned by TATE Liverpool, Battersea Art Centre, Studio Voltaire, PEER Gallery, In-situ,QUAD, Heart Of Glass, Left Coast, Homotopia, The National Festival of Making, Newlyn Gallery and LADA.\n\nTheir films have shown in a number of film festivals including Leeds international, GAZE, Queer Fringe! Filmpride Brighton & Hove. Where’s Danny? Won the Iris prize community award 2023. They were a finalist in screenshot 2023 a competition for comedy writer-performers hosted by Sister Pictures and South of the River Pictures."
