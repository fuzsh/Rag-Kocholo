        "text": "Homotopia Festival is pleased to present a curated series of queer film shorts, available to watch on-demand throughout the festival.\n\nIsolated Canvas by Banksie\n\nA moment of transition, channelling support in this moment of temporary isolation through a summoning of radical queerness: a spell of self-protection.\n\nSomething in the closet by Nosa Eke\n\nThe story of Madi, a gay teenager who must come to terms with her sexuality as her desires begin to manifest themselves in unsettling ways.\n\nOne of the most beautiful experiences I’ve ever had by Colin Ginks\n\nThe public space is instrumental in the forging of our sexual essentiality, and the risks involved – particularly for nonheterosexual\n\nindividuals.\n\nPure by Natalie Harris\n\nA tender queer coming-ofage story that centres Black girlhood and reminds us to believe in joy.\n\nNude Triumphant by Leo Crane\n\nJay rushes to get ready for another frantic day until a chance encounter propels him into a strange watercolour world.\n\nThe Devotions by Barry Fitzgerald\n\nUnpicking personal experiences of religion, sexuality and growing up gay in rural Ireland. Expect house music. The Virgin Mary. Latex. And running. Directed by Mia Georgis.\n\nSunday 31 October, 2pm\n\nMeet the Filmmakers\n\nWe bring together all of the filmmakers for a live panel discussion to discuss their work and the future of queer film.\n\nThe panel will be chaired by Becs Rainey, a Creative Producer from London. Becs makes commercials, music videos, docs and short films, sometimes delving into the fashion and advertising agency worlds. She is Head of Production at Girls in Film, a network which represents, champions and connects the new generation of women, non-binary and trans creatives in the film industry.\n\nA ticket for this event includes on-demand access to all of the film shorts for the duration of the festival."
