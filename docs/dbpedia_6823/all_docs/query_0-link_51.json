        "text": "As a Protestant, southern born Republican - I’m well aware of the feelings that many have towards pride month. I could write an essay on what it was like to grow up watching a society that outlawed certain types of marriage. Instead I’ll challenge you to view this month through this lens: Pride month exists because during my childhood the freedom to love did not exist for everyone. If pride month makes you feel as if it’s pushing an “agenda”, remember that you’re not celebrating people’s life choices. You’re celebrating our choices as a nation to recognize the freedom that everyone has the basic right to enjoy. It’s a concept many have laid down their lives to protect. Can we truly honor those lives just a short week ago, and choose to ignore the fact that they were fighting for human rights just because we don’t share the same feelings? Pride month means many things - but above all is it’s a reminder that human rights belong to all humans. Unwavering. Equal. Unbiased. Freedom from persecution for all.\n\nAmplifying this powerful message from Yeong Cheng as it deeply resonated with me. While queerness does not erase ⚪️privilege, it's important to equally recognize that being racially marginalized as 🤎 and 🖤does not erase internalized cisheteronormativity or cisgender privilege. Let's continue to examine our internalized biases within the framework of intersectionality to collectively strive for liberation. Let’s remember that our oppression and liberation are bound together, and in the words of Lila Watson, “If you have come to help me, you are wasting your time, but if you have come because our liberation is bound together, then let’s work together.” We are meant to coexist consciously and harmoniously as one human family. However, the divisions and hierarchies that bind us are designed to perpetuate a neocolonial, capitalist, and imperialist agenda that thrives when our humanity is divided and the world is bleeding. How are you amplifying trans, non-binary, and non-conforming people this Pride Month? How are you amplifying Indigenous well-being and resilience this Indigenous History Month? How are you amplifying men's wellness this Men’s Mental Health Month? Does your activism address one genocide or multiple genocides? Does your activism address one genocide or multiple genocides? If it centers just one, who were you taught to invisibilize and not center their pain? If you are a sexist whose anti-patriarchy stance demonizes all men, may you be made uncomfortable during this Men's Mental Health Awareness Month. If you are transphobic, biphobic, or homophobic, may you be uncomfortable this Pride Month. If you stereotype Indigenous people and minimize their intergenerational trauma, which is a byproduct of Eurocolonialism and Euro-cognitive imperialism, may this Indigenous History Month make you uncomfortable. Why? Because transformation happens in discomfort, not comfort zones!\n\nHere is a #blerd confession, y’all… I’m a fan of dictionaries! Understanding how others interpret ideas and terms has always been key for me. Before writing this post, I delved into the term \"danger,\" defined as a person or thing likely to cause harm or injury. In honor of June’s diverse cultural & affinity-based observances, let's be mindful of behaviors that can unintentionally cause harm: 🚨 Using outdated language to describe individuals and collectives. 🚨 Minimizing the impact of systemic oppression and violence. 🚨 Explaining concepts affecting a group we aren’t part of (such as anti-Blackness) in a condescending or patronizing manner. 🚨 Offering oversimplified “solutions” that don’t fully address the depth of a particular community's experience with systemic oppression. As a #DEJI practitioner and consultant, I also (regretfully) engage in these behaviors from time-to-time. Here are redirections I practice and hope will benefit my #LinkedIn network: 👉🏾 Practice Intellectual Humility: Recognizing the potential fallibility of our beliefs is key. Recognize the importance of suspending judgment and accepting diverse perspectives. I.E., your gay friend may prefer the term \"Queer,\" while others may not. 👉🏾 Lean into Specificity: Avoid generalizations by tailoring your language. For example, when discussing Juneteenth, use terms like \"descendants of enslaved people\" to distinguish between different Black communities across the African Diaspora. 👉🏾 Consult with Community Members: Seeking feedback from thought-leaders within a specific community may be helpful when creating content, events, and programs. Folks like myself and Sharon Hurley Hall (she/her) offer #PickMyBrainSessions that can provide valuable insights and ensure inclusivity in your initiatives. 👉🏾 Cite Sources: It's essential to acknowledge when we're not experts, especially on unfamiliar topics. Referencing credible sources helps maintain transparency and credibility in discussions. 👉🏾 Acknowledge Your Gaps and Lived Experiences: Being aware of biases and limitations is imperative. Distinguishing between personal experiences and acquired knowledge is key, particularly in conversations about cultural diversity and sensitivity. We all need to be able to differentiate between what we’ve experienced vs. what we’ve witnessed. Let’s celebrate #Pride, #BlackMusicMonth, #LovingDay, #Juneteenth, and #NationalCaribbeanAmericanHeritageMonth intentionally and inclusively.

Pride is primarily about one’s well being(social/physical/mental). People are not obliged to make their life choices sensible to you but first and foremost to themselves. If you understand something it’s good, if you don’t then go ahead and learn/communicate/ask while respecting boundaries. 2. Colleges/Workplaces/Corporate spaces have been in a much better place than they used to be but to maintain them the same way it’s always a work in progress. 3. We have to unlearn and learn a lot. Acceptance shouldn’t feel like an extravagant commodity existing in the urban elite spaces but there should be a change in every extent possible. 4. Respect should be a basic necessity given to all, the sooner we understand the better it will get. 5. Don’t ask anything from queer people that you yourself wouldn’t like to answer. Sometimes your intentions will be right but it might end up invading their safe space. At the end love is love. Live and let live. Happy pride 🏳️🌈. #love #pride #pridemonth #prideforever\n\nI have a trans colleague now what? ❓ Did you know them before they transitioned? Practice their new pronouns and name in private. I do this when friends transition. I find it helpful. ❓Did they disclose to you they were trans? Sounds like they trust you. - Educate yourself on the current ‘slate of hate happening across the country. - Ask about inclusive policies and procedure within your organization specially for trans folks (not in front of your colleague and without mentioning them). - Don’t tell others. It’s their business to share. - Don’t make assumptions about their lived experience or relationships. If they share more, consider it a gift. - Do not expect them to educate you. - Find ways to use inclusive language that includes ALL genders. Such as, avoid using ‘ladies’ and ‘hey, guys.’ Enjoy the pure privilege it is to have the insightful perspective of a trans person on your team!\n\nNot just a pretty Pride month. As we see positive stories and pretty pictures and rainbow flags this Pride month, I am also mindful of the untold stories. Just this week, courageous individuals have shared stories with me - across professional and private arenas. 🥲People afraid to speak up because they feel unsafe. 🤯Dismissing the opinions of others solely based on their age. 🫣“Jokes” condoning harassment. 🤨Sexualising conversation where it has no space in professional relations. 😳Made to be the one at fault for being the victim of predatory behaviour. 😤Having to excuse not conforming to stereotypes - and excelling in their careers All because of their gender, nationality, heritage, sexual orientation, age or race. I am so filled with disillusionment, frustration and sadness. I need to make sure I do my part of my little three kiddos - they have it all figured out. It’s the current adult generations that have some learning to do. We need to do better. We need to want to do better."
