        "text": "Join Campbell X and friends for a screening of DES!RE followed by a panel discussion on trans masculine visibility and representation.\n\nDES!RE by award-winning filmmaker Campbell X (Stud Life, VISIBLE, Spectrum London, Different for Girls, Still We Thrive) takes it’s visual influence from the homo-erotic photography of Bruce Weber and queers it further with a trans and feminist lens. It is in Black and White with a dreamy soundtrack by Campbell L Sangster and animation by Neelu Bhuman.\n\nIn queer culture there has been a shift to speaking about the complexities of desire. But there is very little discussion about actively desiring those bodies which blur gender boundaries and binaries. Mainstream visual culture is still stuck in cis heteronormative capitalistic binary attractiveness – even for those who define as transgender. So there is a wealth of images of those trans mascs who approximate cis male embodiment. Butch women or those who reject womanhood who are not trans men are also not celebrated or “seen” especially in mainstream LGBTQ timelines.\n\nDES!RE attempts to explore the desire for sameness and difference using the bodies of people of diverse ages and races, who were assigned female at birth, yet now identify as transmen, men, masculine of centre, butch, stud, non-binary and AG. The dialogue between the images and the voice over by femme lesbian and bisexual women, transmen, and butch women subverts heteronormative understanding of love and lust for this queer masculinity. DES!RE celebrates while acknowledging the challenges for loving masculinity, maleness and manhood.\n\nWith local artists Felix Mufti-Wright and Campbell L Sangster.\n\n13:30: Doors\n\n14:00: Intro\n\n14:10 Film\n\n14:20 Q&A\n\nThis screening is part of our Community Cinema.

In addition to our festival, we have a year-round programme of artist development, public artworks and events.\n\nHomotopia Festival is the UK’s longest running LGBTQIA arts and culture festival, In 2012 we became one of Arts Council England’s National Portfolio Organisations, and at the time, were the only dedicated LGBTQIA arts organisation to be recognised in this way. In the years that have followed Homotopia has achieved significant growth and development and we take pride in being at the forefront of combining creativity and social change for and in collaboration with our ever-expanding community."
