        "text": "Homotopia, the UK’s longest running LGBTQ+ arts festival, returns for its 20th anniversary in 2023 with a celebration of Queer history and heritage – starting with a riotous pro-wrestling, drag and cabaret night in Liverpool’s Baltic Triangle.\n\nClash of the Titans will see wrestlers and Queer cabaret Fist Club bring an incredible combination of comedy, drag performance and hard hitting live wrestling to Liverpool for the opening party of Homotopia on 11 November.\n\nThis year’s festival, themed Gods & Monsters, marks 20 years of Homotopia. From 11 November until 2 December 2023, visitors can expect a range of cutting edge entertainment – from visual arts to theatre, live music and performances.\n\nFor 2023, Homotopia turns its focus to growth – asking visitors to consider how to foster a sense of community and mutual care in the face of an increasingly intolerant society – and how to build a space of love and respect for those within the LGBTQ+ community who are often most demonised within the mainstream.\n\nHighlights include living legend and Queer icon David Hoyle, bringing his critically-acclaimed live show The Ten Commandments to Unity Theatre on 17 November. A live experience aimed at washing away sin, dark comedy meets righteous anger and queer revolution in a way that only David Hoyle himself can conjure.\n\nArtist and activist Liv Wynter will present How to Catch a Pig on 14 November, a celebration of creatives who organise against the state, with a focus on queer and trans performers.\n\nLiverpool fixtures EAT ME will bring fantasy, sin and pleasure to the hallowed surroundings of the Williamson Tunnels for a full weekend of club nights, art and theatre with the EAT ME Weekender.\n\nArtist in residence Claudiu Oprea presents his installation bear’s dream at Granby Winter Garden, where, through the dreamscapes of a fluffy toy bear, visitors can build a unique journey of self-discovery, healing, and connection to ancestral roots.\n\nFind a full list of events and activities taking place for Homotopia 2023 at homotopia.net\n\nEvent Date: Saturday 11th November 2023 - Saturday 2nd December 2023"
