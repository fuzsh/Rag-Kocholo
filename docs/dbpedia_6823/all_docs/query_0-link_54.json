        "text": "When I arrived as the Branscombe House Artist-in-Residence many people told me about the Anti-SOGI protests that happened here in 2018. So, in conversation with Katie Varney (Community Cultural Development Manager) and Shaun Dacey (Director of the Richmond Art Gallery) the idea for Setting The Table was born, to create a project that makes space for LGBTQ+ and Two Spirit/Indigiqueer artists to talk about their life and work and have a communal creative activity afterword for the audience to gather around. I like the meditative quality of labor intensive practices and connecting people through the common language of making, so weaving of course appealed to me, though I had never done it before.\n\nI learned to weave in January at The Cultural Centre with the patient guidance of Linda Montague and helpful directions of Connie Robson, Dee Silva, Agnes Mertin and advocacy of Leslie Green and Anke Hanemaayer who arranged for a loom to be donated to the project on behalf of Richmond Weavers and Spinners Guild.\n\nI wove this runner on a Woolhouse 4 shaft table loom choosing a pattern from Marguerite Porter Davison’s Handweaver’s Pattern Book. I wanted to include the Scandinavian pattern of Goose Eye to reference the location of Branscombe House on the migration path of the lesser snow geese, and chose this design as the centre section would allow for a spectrum of colors that would also be used in the community made place settings.\n\nHere is the runner just off the loom, it is 18 inches wide and 12 feet long.\n\nThe place settings were made collaboratively by over 200 participants over 14 sessions at Thompson and City Centre Community Centres, The Cultural Centre, The Richmond Art Gallery, Arts Festivals, Highschool GSA meetings and the Branscombe House.\n\nAt each session a participant would chose a color and then chose a board to weave their color adding to where the last person left off. This method of working with color blocks references how the first Pride Flag was made collectively by Gilbert Baker and 30 members in a community centre in San Francisco, CA in 1978.\n\nThe handmade tools used by participants were made with the help of Sam McWilliams and the wood burned inscriptions that appear on the flat shuttles were contributed by each speakers as a way to set an intention into the fabric.\n\nThe speakers in the series addressed different intersectional issues. Kirsten Nelson discussed her weaving and performance work that address the value of labour through a disabilities studies lens.\n\nRadical Marxist Feminist Patrick Haggerty and his band Lavender Country played music from the first openly gay country album he produced in the 1970’s.\n\nChris Vargas screened his video work and spoke to the complex ways that queer and trans people negotiate spaces for themselves within historical & institutional memory and popular culture.\n\nPaul Wong award-winning artist and curator known for pioneering early visual and media art in Canada discussed his project Pride in Chinatown.\n\nThe film work of Thirza Cuthand addressed Indigeneity, sexuality, mental health, queer identity and love.\n\nK. Ho presented photography work that focuses on the joy and tenderness of living in intersectional margins, telling stories about love, struggle, recognition, and self discovery.\n\nBrenna Beznason discussed her love of sewing as a form of healing, self-love, and resistance. Since making her first full dress in 2016, Brenna has converted most of her wardrobe to entirely handmade garments. Each piece is a journal entry, an experiment, and a talisman or amulet, hidden in plain sight and worn into the world.\n\nSetting the Table was also presented in two workshop settings with the help of Dorothy Jo, Inclusion Coordinator for the City of Richmond. The first was Queer Competency Training with Rana Nu from Qmunity, this experiential workshop helped city staff understand how to make spaces more inclusive for queer, trans and Two-Spirit clients and staff.\n\nand the second an Anti-Oppression Workshop with Cicely Blain. Cicely Belle Blain is a diversity and inclusion consultant, activist and writer, co-founder of Black Lives Matter – Vancouver, and one of Vancouver’s fifty most influential people of 2018, as awarded by Vancouver Magazine,\n\nThe Place Settings were made specifically to fit the picnic table at Branscombe House in preparation for the first Pride Celebration to be held at the Branscombe House in August. At the head of the picnic table is 2016 artist-in-resident Rhonda Weppler’s The Gathering, which the picnic table was built to house.\n\nAt the Pride celebration, Musqueam researcher and outreach coordinator Terry Point opened the event with an official welcome, acting mayor Harold Steves gave a speech followed by Drag Queen Story time with Peach Cobblah,\n\nDance Party with Dj/Promoter Carolyn Arthur, Weave-in Station (facilitated by Shaun Dacey) and a Bike Decorating Station with Marina Szijarto who then marshaled a Dykes on Bikes on Dykes Parade along West Dyke Trail.\n\nWhen I saw the call for the #3 Road Art Columns I thought it would be a great opportunity for participants to visit and say “Hey, I made that Stripe!” The light box panels reminded me of display cases and I wanted to encourage that connection in the way the textiles were photographed.\n\nThe curved shape of the panel box helped give the effect of textile wrapping around the column.\n\nI wanted to show the completed community-made textiles,\n\nbut also how they were made.\n\nI worked with photographer Rachel Topham, who captured an amazing amount of detail.\n\nThis project was made possible through the Community Resilience Through Arts and Culture program (BC Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture), The Richmond Art Gallery (Thank you Shaun Dacey), Public Art Richmond (Thank you Biliana Velcova & Elisa Yon), The Richmond Weavers and Spinners Guild and City of Richmond’s Community Social Development (Thank you Dorothy Jo) and Arts, Culture and Heritage Departments (Thank you Katie Varney).\n\nThere were dedicated weavers who came to almost every event and took extra weaving shifts: Ilvs Strauss, Joyce Walsh, Suzy Buckley, Sheilgh Pace, Sam McWilliams, Carrie Gratland and people who helped make the Pride Event extra special: Marina Szijarto, Glen Andersen, Sweet Digz Farm.\n\nThanks to Vince Gonzaga from Uno Digital, Jas Lally and Melanie Devoy for your help with the #3 Road Arts Columns Launch.\n\nAnd finally a big thanks to everyone who took part in this project and their show of solidarity and support for LGBTQ+ and Two Spirit/Indigiqueer people living in Richmond.\n\nBrenna Bezanson is a feminist, woman, trans person, and auntie to dogs. Her professional life has consisted of inconsistencies, including hairstyling, caregiving, sex work, and management in the corporate and non-profit sectors. This has all somehow led to her current path as a private consultant on community engagement, inclusion, and equity. When not at work Brenna can usually be found in a park with a book befriending city wildlife or watching sci fi and sewing into the wee hours of the night.\n\nAs a trans kid in rural Nova Scotia in the tail end of the 90’s, Brenna first began dabbling with sewing on her mother’s retro Singer, as an attempt to transform her poorly fitting Sears Catalogue garments into something “more”. Nearly 2 decades later Brenna rediscovered her love of sewing as a form of healing, self-love, and resistance. Since making her first full dress in 2016, Brenna has converted most of her wardrobe to entirely handmade garments. Each piece is a journal entry, an experiment, and a talisman or amulet, hidden in plain sight and worn into the world.\n\nSetting the Table is a series of talks, performances, screenings and weave-ins that explore how different people share community and support one another. It is a showcase of LGBTQ and Two Spirit artists, activists and leaders who present work on intersectional issues and allyship.\n\nFollowing Brenna’s talk, the group will be learning how to hemstitch and finish a series of textiles for the Branscombe House Pride Picnic and Social in August.\n\nThe event is free and but please register using the form below. Accessible venue, materials supplied, no sewing experience needed.\n\nI would like to acknowledge that these events are located on the traditional, ancestral and unceded territory of the Hən̓q̓əmin̓əm speaking peoples and that we gather as guests on the territory of the Indigenous peoples of this land.\n\nI also gratefully acknowledge: the financial support of the Province of British Columbia, the partnership of The Richmond Art Gallery, the generosity of time, equipment and expertise provided by The Richmond Weaver & Spinners Guild and support by Dorothy Jo, Inclusion Coordinator for the City of Richmond and Katie Varney, Manager of Community Cultural Development for the City of Richmond.\n\nThirza Jean Cuthand was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada in 1978, and grew up in Saskatoon.

In the summer of 2016 she began working on a 2D video game called A Bipolar Journey based on her experience learning and dealing with her bipolar disorder. It showed at ImagineNATIVE and she is planning to further develop it. She has also written three feature screenplays and has performed at Live At The End Of The Century in Vancouver, Queer City Cinema’s Performatorium in Regina, and 7a*11d in Toronto. In 2017 she won the Hnatyshyn Foundation’s REVEAL Indigenous Art Award. She is a Whitney Biennial 2019 artist. She is of Plains Cree and Scots descent, a member of Little Pine First Nation, and currently resides in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSetting the Table is a series of talks, performances, screenings and weave-ins that explore how different people share community and support one another. It is a showcase of LGBTQ and Two Spirit artists, activists and leaders who present work on intersectional issues and allyship.\n\nPreceding the film screening, Paige Gratland will direct the group in an activity to help weave a portion of the place setting for the Branscombe House Pride Picnic and Social in August.\n\nThe event is free and but please register using the form below.
