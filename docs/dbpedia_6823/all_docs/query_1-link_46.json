        "text": "Exist Loudly CIC:\n\nExist Loudly are a London based creative youth organisation dedicated to supporting Black and mixed Black LGBTQ+ youth aged 16-23 through spaces of joy, community and creativity.\n\nAZ Magazine:\n\nSince 2015, AZ Magazine has been equally dedicated to platforming Black and minority ethnic LGBTQ+ voices by covering stories and issues faced by those in the same communities. Reporting on everything from the arts to music, culture, news and fashion, they look for stories that capture every aspect of the community’s culture.\n\nQueer Zine Library:\n\nWith an increase in zine production and creatives being eager to showcase community talent without big publications, Queer Zine Library are a major helping hand. Described as a “roaming DIY queer library celebrating radical LGBTQIA+ self-publishing,” they collect zines made throughout the UK and tour them, providing access to zines and greater reach for producers. With a focus on showcasing socially-engaged zines, they promote work that goes beyond “art objects which look nice.”\n\nCurious Arts:\n\nThe Newcastle-based not-for-profit is an LGBTQIA+ organisation dedicated to the championing and progression of art and artists throughout the north east of England. Hosting events from cabarets and vogue balls to youth group sessions and LGBTQIA+ awareness training, they are a hub of safety for those in the community and a centre of learning for allies. They also provide opportunities such as residencies and open calls.\n\nHomotopia:\n\nWith 18 years in the game, Homotopia is a trusted Liverpool-based arts and social justice organisation. Being a space that supports art and activism, they showcase LGBTQIA artists ranging from local to international, who have a passion for socially-engaged art. Running the Homotopia festival, a year long Queer Core artist development programme and Young Homotopia group for those interested in self-expression, they are perfect for those looking for a safe space to develop.\n\nQueerAF:\n\nAn independent platform, QueerAF look to launch the careers of LGBTQIA+ creatives in media, taking on mentees with a passion for production, journalism and overall content creation. They also have a newsletter and award-winning podcast where they speak on all things queer – all of which help to establish a platform that they believe the media industry should reflect.\n\nQUEERCIRCLE:\n\nFormed in June 2022, QUEERCIRCLE seeks to develop an ecology of artists, curators, writers, thinkers, community organisers, grassroots organisations and charities who collectively work together to reimagine the role cultural spaces play in society.\n\nTheir exhibition commissions, archive exhibitions, participatory residencies, learning and workplace opportunities, and health and wellbeing programmes provide holistic support to LGBTQ+ and local communities. But as well as being a home for political art, it is also a place for people to come together, to rest and celebrate the incredible talent of LGBTQ+ people.\n\nQueer Art Projects:\n\nAn independent production company based in London, Queer Art Projects specialise in organising events, performances, screenings, plays, exhibitions and workshops. Founded by Tuna Erdem and Seda Ergul who have a number of degrees in film, music and other areas of the arts, they are for the progression of the arts for the queer community. Also founding the Instanbul Queer Art Collective, their years of engaging and working with queer artists is reflected in their programming and outreach.\n\nThe Queer Arts Consortium (QUAC):\n\nThe Queer Arts Consortium (QUAC) is a collaboration between Raze Collective, Fringe! Queer Arts & Film Fest, The Cocoa Butter Club, Queer Youth Art Collective and PRIM.Black. QUAC has been awarded funding through the Elevate programme from Arts Council England, to establish a partnership model of collaboration and shared services.\n\nQUAC seeks to preserve, develop and embolden its partner organisations. In turn participating in the continuing establishment of a thriving Queer Arts sector in the UK, that builds essential community, careers and culture.\n\nSanctuary Queer Arts:\n\n“A space where everyone is welcome and no one feels the need to question the way you are, where you can make art freely.”\n\nNow more than ever, it is crucial to establish isolation-fighting creative opportunities for LGBTQIA+ artists, who are already so side-lined in the arts. The chief principal of Sanctuary is development from the ground-up – to truly enact change by cultivating confidence in a younger generation whilst continuing to nurture existing queer voices. The 3 activity strands complement each other, directly implementing this ethos. The hope for Sanctuary Queer Arts is to add solace, stimulation and safety for queer people and allies, moving towards a time when young people will be able to see the world as a safe space.\n\nQUEER|ART:\n\nQUEER|ART is a non-profit arts organization serving a diverse and vibrant community of LGBTQ+ artists across generations and disciplines.\n\nQUEER|ART was launched in 2009 to support a generation of LGBTQ+ artists that lost mentors to the AIDS Crisis of the 1980s. By fostering the confident expression of LGBTQ+ artists’ perspectives, stories, and identities, Queer|Art amplifies the voice of a population that has been historically suppressed, disenfranchised, and often overlooked by traditional institutional and economic support systems. Its programmes are organised under three major areas of support — PRACTICE (Creative and Professional Development), PRESENTS (Events, Exhibitions, and other Public Presentations), and AWARDS (Residencies, Grants, and Prizes). Each of these areas of support operate across four fields of creative practice: Film, Performance, Visual Art, and Literature."
