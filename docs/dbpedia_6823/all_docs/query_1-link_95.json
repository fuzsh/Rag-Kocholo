        "text": "Welcome to my website\n\nI'm a creative historian who works with the maritime industry, museums, television, theatre, social media, universities and in the community. Women who went to sea - whose travel transformed their lives forever - are my special area of expertise.\n\nAs a person interested in kindness, fun, and the ways we humans seek fulfilment and transformation, my especial interest is in the stories of people who have led marginalised lives in the past - and sought adventure, freedom and the space to be all they are, and might become.\n\nIn particular this means recording people, or helping them write their stories. They tend to be people who've taken jobs at sea despite the odds - like women, ethnic minorities and LGBT+ people - for whom seagoing meant sometimes liberation and sometimes injustice.\n\nShips are hypersexualised spaces for those confined in them. As a cultural historian, that's fascinating to me. They're heterotopias (meaning other places, like Wonderland) and liminal zones, (which means they explain a lot about our societies on land.)\n\nI live in Marsden in the Pennines, the home village of Poet Laureate Simon Armitage. He describes it as a uniquely 'transcendent and transgressive location' but I celebrate it as a warm Alternative community. And I work a lot in London and abroad. At Liverpool John Moores University I am Visiting Senior Research Fellow. At the University of Hull's Maritime Historical Studies Centre I am an Honorary Research Fellow.\n\nWhat am I doing now\n\nMy seminal blog Gender and The Sea genderedseas.blogspot.com will be full of still more unusual stories about people connected to the sea. I will be carrying on exploring, explaining and sharing path-breaking information about race, gender, class, status and the many other characteristics that intersect tellingly. You'll read histories of diverse hyper-mobile people in the maritime world, with a fresh focus on emotions, identity and voyages' potential to transform lives. And you'll be able to see more illustrated PowerPoint presentations about maritime diversity, via YouTube.\n\nI'll be especially helping you find out about:\n\nayahs (South Asian nannies) working at sea and the families who employed them\n\nsafeguarding seafaring women today from sexual abuse at sea (Keith please use a cropped version of the pic at https://www.humanrightsatsea.org/2021/02/08/diversity-inclusion-and-hope-a-reality-check-in-2021/, i.e. the one that says HR at sea: We are all - 2021)\n\nthe global history of LGBT++ seafarers, their culture, and the ways that trips could feel like radical universities and gay pride demonstrations\n\nSANITY. With my Diversity, Equity & Inclusion lenses - and completing my training as a counsellor - I'm researching mental wellbeing on ships in history. Of course it links to safety at sea, as well as connecting to sexual harassment and LGBT++ handling of destructive homophobia aboard.\n\nDANGER. Finishing a history book on civilian women at sea in WW2. Provisional title: Dangerous Adventures: civilian women save the wartime seas. Yale University Press. Publication date tba.\n\nMy upcoming maritime public history contributions, 2024\n\nFeb 1-28. LGBT+ History Month. This year's theme is Medicine - #UnderTheScope. My contribution in talks tbc will be highlighting LGBT+ people's work in informal shipboard mental health care. For example, research shows that on floating gay heavens of the mid-20C, camp men's fun-making was healing. The mutual support of LGBT+ shipmates, and camp humorous theatricality, helped lighten the weight of the workload and isolation. It enabled a sense of safety and camaraderie.\n\nYou can already see my YouTubed talk about this: \"Entertaining 4 Sanity@sea: Hull's glitzy ship's steward Roy 'Wendy' Gibson and the history of shipboard entertainment\", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGg9seH4tgg&t=646s\n\nFeb 22, Thurs. Kings Maritime History Seminars, 17.15-19.30. Cost free.\n\nTalk by Jo Stanley. Rewriting Women into Maritime History: visibilising diverse histories and futures 1700-2023. https://www.kcl.ac.uk/events/series/kings-maritime-history-seminars Pioneering captains. Under-sung port workers. Atypical seagoing mums. The history of maritime women is wide-ranging and their historiography has been sparse. Since 2023 Lloyd's Register Foundation's Heritage and Education Centre is giving the subject a new fillip, including the She_Sees exhibition at the International Maritime Organisation HQ in September 2023 and the related online website at https://hec.lrfoundation.org.uk/whats-on/rewriting-women-into-maritime-history.\n\nIn my personal capacity as an Editorial Board member and consultant for this ongoing project, I will use images, cartoons, and a video to reveal this acclaimed initiative, its contexts and its role in enhancing diverse maritime historiography.\n\nFeb 28, Wed. Pride in Maritime Day. On LinkedIn I'll be unveiling a new story of an overlooked LGBT maritime trailblazer. Former P&O steward Mick Belsten became a key activist in early LGBT+ media.\n\nMarch 1-31. UK's Women's History Month: Theme \"Celebrating Women Who Tell Our Stories\". Look out for my social media work. It will be about the women who tell others' maritime stories - including me, and particularly about collective investigation and sharing!\n\nOctober 1-31. Black History Month. On LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/jo-stanley-22731223/ I will be revealing more stories of maritime people trying to overcome multiple challenges related to colour. That will include \"William Brown\", a young married woman from Grenada, who appears to be the only black woman to cross dress and join the Royal Navy. She was discovered in 1815. Look out for my earlier video podcast about her in Grenada's The Bubb Report: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6oilgybyHKcwFKlaX2cORA\n\n2024. tba.I'm pleased to announce that a wonderful anthology will be emerging soon: Erica Mezzoli, ed, Mermaids: (En)Gendering Maritime Labour and Business Histories, Brill, Leiden, 2024. My chapter discusses that key maritime period in the mid-1970s when many women increasingly got work at sea, doing non-traditional jobs. Some heterosexual men saw it as great opportunity for on onboard intimate relationships. But some queer men saw it as a death knell, because bisexual men would choose Real Women if available. See \"'Invading' calculatedly Dionysian ships: women's advent/ gay stewards' loss. Gender and sex at sea in the 1970s.\"\n\nThings I'm proud of doing recently\n\nDelivering the keynote speech at Amsterdam Maritime Museum's celebration of their queer history exhibition\n\nDelivering the Mike Stammers Memorial Lecture at Merseyside Maritime Museum, 'Race, gender and class: ayahs and amahs as \"worker-passengers\" in British ships 1890-1950'\n\nAny time.
