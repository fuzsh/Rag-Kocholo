        "text": "The 2011 opening of the GLBT History Museum in San Francisco’s Castro neighborhood marked the culmination of over a quarter century of collecting, preserving, and interpreting the Bay Area’s queer history. The museum is a project of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender (GLBT) Historical Society, home to one of the world’s largest and most accessible community-based queer archives. Organizers conceived the museum as a vehicle through which archival materials could be presented to the public in compelling ways, with an eye toward diversity and social justice. The museum was to showcase the archive’s depth and breadth, attract new collections, engage the public with the importance of queer history, and produce powerful exhibitions linking past and present. Even as the museum brings the archives into interaction with many publics, however, contemporary forces in San Francisco threaten to render it complicit in a sanitized, tourist-oriented Castro and gay history. How successfully this museum can represent its related queer archive — and the past, present, and future it endeavors to sustain — remains an open question.\n\nMuseums today are demonstrating an increased commitment to LGBTQ communities through exhibitions that center their stories. These queer-focused exhibitions are valuable tools for broadening representation, but the messages they carry are only as strong as the institution’s commitment to queer inclusion. When queer narratives are limited to temporary exhibitions during Pride Month or isolated in queer-themed galleries, it suggests that they are “special interest” and unimportant. However, with the support of comprehensive queer inclusion, exhibitions can be stronger, more powerful tools for inclusion. This article explores queer inclusion in four tiers: programming, temporary exhibitions, interpretive strategy, and broad institutional commitment. This article first appeared in the journal Exhibition (Fall 2017) Vol. 36 No. 2 and is reproduced with permission. www.name-aam.org\n\nQueering Australian Museums addresses the problem of how queer or LGBTIQ communities can be further included in Australian museums on their own terms. It looks at four areas of museums—management, collections, exhibitions, and connections with audiences and communities—to consider barriers and enablers of queer inclusion in these often heteronormative institutions. Case studies of queer-inclusive efforts in public Australian museums are interpreted from institutional and community perspectives drawn from 25 interviews. The interviews are put into critical conversation with archival material and literature from museum studies and the emerging field of queer museology. The study evaluates the visibility of the history, cultures, and identities of queer communities in Australian museums. It establishes that many public representations of queerness have been driven by the efforts of LGBTIQ communities, particularly through community-based heritage organisations. It also gathers and reflects upon examples of critical queer inclusion that have occurred in public museums. Using these exemplars, it argues that queer communities should be empowered to make decisions about their own heritage with the support of museums and their unique attributes; that individual and organisational leadership, involving queer individuals and allies, should be brought to bear on this task; and that effectively navigating the tensions between museums and queer communities requires mutual understanding and accommodation. Through the process of queering the museum, it is suggested, each party might be transformed, leading to LGBTIQ diversity being valued as an integral part of society. The thesis addresses the gap in Australian museum studies literature on queer or LGBTIQ inclusion compared with Euro-American settings. It further contributes original case studies to the international field of queer museology, and to museum studies literature on including and empowering diverse communities. Both recognising the agency of queer communities and also engaging with the language and conventions of museums, it constructs a distinct account of how to navigate the historical tensions between the two. It thereby aims to enrich museum offerings for all audiences on the terms of those erstwhile excluded."
