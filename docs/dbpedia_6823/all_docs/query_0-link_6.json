Eric is also the co-director of two films, Homotopia and Criminal Queers. And the co-editor of Trap Door: Trans Cultural Production and the Politics of Visibility and Captive Genders: Trans Embodiment and the Prison Industrial Complex.&nbsp; In this conversation, Josh interviews Eric about their latest work. Discussing the continuum of anti-trans and anti-queer violence, and grappling with what it might take to end it. They briefly discuss the lives of Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson, and the marketing of their likenesses and hollowing out of their political memory.&nbsp; Eric also shares the historical link between colonialism and HIV and reflects upon suicide not as a set of “individual losses of broken children,” but rather “as evidence of a murderous world.“ While the conversation does not go into detail, I do just want to acknowledge for folks that obviously based on the subject matter there are discussions of anti-trans and anti-queer violence and of suicide along with other heavy subject matter in this episode. And a quick reminder, if you like what we do here at Millennials Are Killing Capitalism, we are back working on our goal of hitting 1,000 patrons. We hit it briefly last month, but lost some patrons with the start of the new month. We need 27 new patrons this month to return to that goal. So join now if you haven’t.&nbsp;",

So join now if you haven’t.\n\nWe created this podcast in recognition that there are a number of podcasts for the American “left,” but many of them focus heavily on the organizing of social democrats, progressives, and liberal democrats. Aside from that, on the left we are always fighting a war of ideas and if we do not continue to build platforms to share those ideas and the stories of their implementation from a leftist perspective, they will continue to be ignored, misrepresented, and dismissed by the capitalist media and as a result by the general public. Our goal is to provide a platform for communists, anti-imperialists, Black Liberation movements, ancoms, left libertarians, LBGTQ activists, feminists, immigration activists, and abolitionists to discuss radical politics, radical organizing and share their visions for a better world. Our goal is to center organizers who represent and work with marginalized communities building survival programs, defense programs, political education, and counterpower. We also plan to bring in perspectives on and from the global south to highlight anti-capitalist struggles outside the imperial core. We view solidarity with decolonization, indigenous, anti-imperialist, environmentalist, socialist, and anarchist movements across the world as necessary steps toward meaningful liberation for all people. Too often within the imperial core we focus on our own struggles without taking the time to understand those fighting for freedom from beneath the empire’s thumb. It is important to highlight these struggles, learn what we can from them, offer solidarity, and support with action when we can. It is not enough to Fight For $15 an hour and Single-Payer within the core, while the US actively fights against the self-determination of the people of the global economically and militarily. We recognize that except for the extremely wealthy and privileged, our fates and struggles are intrinsically connected. We hope that our podcast becomes a meaningful platform for organizers and activists fighting for social change to connect their local movements to broader movements centered around the fight to end imperialism, capitalism, racism, discrimination based on gender identity or sexuality, sexism, and ableism.
