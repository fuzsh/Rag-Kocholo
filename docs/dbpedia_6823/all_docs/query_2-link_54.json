        "text": "Death's Futurity: The Visual Life of Black Power, a lecture by Sampada Aranke\n\nIn Death’s Futurity, Sampada Aranke examines the importance of representations of death to Black liberation. Analyzing posters, photographs, journalism, and films that focus on the murders of Black Panther Party members Lil’ Bobby Hutton, Fred Hampton, and George Jackson, Aranke constructs a visual history of the 1960s and 1970s Black Power era.\n\nPhotographs of Hutton that appeared on flyers and posters called attention to the condition of his death, while the 1971 documentary The Murder of Fred Hampton enabled the consideration of Hampton’s afterlife through visual meditations on his murder. Printmaking and political posters surrounding Jackson’s murder marked the transition from Black Power to the prison abolition movement in ways that highlighted the relationship between surveillance, policing, incarceration, and anti-Black violence. By foregrounding the photographed, collaged, filmed, and drawn Black body, Aranke demonstrates that corporeality and corpses are crucial to the efforts to shape visions of a Black future free from white supremacy.\n\nSampada Aranke (PhD, Performance Studies) is an Assistant Professor in the Art History, Theory, Criticism Department at the School of the Art Institute, Chicago. Her research interests include performance theories of embodiment, visual culture, and Black cultural and aesthetic theory.\n\nDeath's Futurity: The Visual Life of Black Power is co-hosted by the Wattis Institute with the Graduate Program in Visual & Critical Studies and is organized by Jacqueline Francis and Diego Villalobos.\n\nLand to Light On, is a collaborative public programming series between the Wattis Institute and CCA's academic departments focusing on racial capitalism, abolition, and decolonization.\n\nView Event →\n\nGuillermo Gómez-Peña & Balitrónica | The Pandemia Chronicles: A Divination\n\nA brand new spoken-word monologue & “live-action juke-box” by Guillermo Gómez-Peña & Balitronica\n\nFREE! Space is limited. Register here.\n\nLa Pocha Nostra and the artists are thrilled to present excerpts from their most recent performance manuscripts and bank of ritual actions. Utilizing a casino roulette and traditional tarot deck, Balitronica utilizes various forms of oracular magic to select spoken word texts and props for Gómez-Peña live performance. The fate of the script and the performance are determined by methods of divination and chance.\n\nIn this new project, the artists are unplugged, thinking out loud and articulating the challenges and possibilities of reinvention in the midst of multiple pandemics. The performance includes new texts written during the past two years combined with “classics” from Gómez-Peña’s own living archives.\n\nArtist Statement by Gómez-Peña:\n\n“My new performance represents the fruit of my life’s work in all its iterations: live performance, lecturing, archiving, literary work, mentoring, community activism, all coming together to address the dangers of the times we live in with its disregard for human life and insidious undermining of democracy.\n\nAt this time in my life I am thinking as much about legacy as I am trying to continually produce socially conscious experimental artwork that is simultaneously plugged into the national debates. I have learned from decades of touring performance material to locations beyond the Border that a call to action - in the form of a work of art - has the power to elicit compassion and inculcate a desire for social justice.\n\nFor me performance art is a form of radical democracy and citizenship which depends on the presence of the audience/community to succeed. I view my approach to creating this hybrid piece as \"performing the archives\" for multiple contexts: The art world, academia, community and the media. I am particularly interested in connecting with a new generation of audience members who may not have been exposed to the history of my generation, performance art and the Chicano movement.” - Guillermo Gómez-Peña\n\nT his event is free and open to the public. Organized by CCA's Critical Ethnic Studies Program. Co-sponsored by the Graduate Visual and Critical Studies Program, Individualized Studies Program, Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, & Belonging, and Humanities & Sciences Division.\n\nView Event →\n\n2023 VCS Spring Symposium\n\nIn the spring semester of the thesis year, students formally present their research to the public.

When you reclaim the term feminist killjoy you end up in conversation with other people who, like you, find a potential or promise in that term, how its negativity can be redirected. In this lecture, I explore the queerness of the project of killing joy as a project of redirecting negativity. I develop some of my arguments about “the unhappy queer” from The Promise of Happiness (2010) as well as “queer use” from What’s the Use? On the Uses of Use (2019). By giving the feminist killjoy a queer history, I also explain how and why killing joy is a world making project.\n\nSara Ahmed is an independent feminist scholar. Her work is concerned with how power is experienced and challenged in everyday life and institutional cultures. She has recently completed The Feminist Killjoy Handbook, her first trade publication, and is currently writing a follow up text, The Complainer's Handbook. She has begun a new research project on common sense. Her previous books include Complaint! (2021),What's The Use? On the Uses of Use (2019), Living a Feminist Life (2017), Willful Subjects (2014), On Being Included: Racism and Diversity in Institutional Life (2012), The Promise of Happiness (2010), Queer Phenomenology: Objects, Orientations, Others (2006), The Cultural Politics of Emotion (2014, 2004), Strange Encounters: Embodied Others in Post-Coloniality (2000) and Differences that Matter: Feminist Theory and Postmodernism (1998).\n\nInstagram: @saranoahmed | Twitter: @SaraNAhmed\n\nAfter Dr. Ahmed's lecture, she will join in conversation with Zahra Noorbakhsh, the San Francisco Bay Area comedian, writer, actor and co-host of the #GoodMuslimBadMuslim podcast.\n\nInstagram: @zahracomedy\n\nThis program is part of the Queer Conversations on Culture and the Arts series (a partnership between CCA and the Queer Cultural Center of San Francisco).\n\nENTRY DETAILS:\n\nTimken Lecture Hall, 1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco, CA 94107\n\nFree and open to the public.

Born in Lynn, Massachusetts in 1950 to Chinese emigrants, Yau attended Bard College and earned an MFA from Brooklyn College in 1978. His first book of poetry, Crossing Canal Street, was published in 1976. Since then, he has won acclaim for his poetry’s attentiveness to visual culture and linguistic surface. In poems that frequently pun, trope, and play with the English language, Yau offers complicated, sometimes competing versions of the legacy of his dual heritages—as Chinese, American, poet, and artist. A contributor for Contemporary Poets wrote: “Yau’s poems [are] often as much a product of his visual sense of the world, as his awareness of his double heritage from both Oriental and Occidental cultures.” Yau’s many collections of poetry include Corpse and Mirror (1983), selected by John Ashbery for the National Poetry Series, Edificio Sayonara (1992), Forbidden Entries (1996), Borrowed Love Poems (2002), Ing Grish (2005), Paradiso Diaspora (2006), Exhibits (2010), and Further Adventures in Monochrome (2012). Yau’s work frequently explores, and exploits, the boundaries between poetry and prose, and his collections of stories and prose poetry include Hawaiian Cowboys (1994), My Symptoms (1998), and Forbidden Entries (1996).\n\nA noted art critic and curator, Yau has also published many works of art criticism and artists’ books. Reviewing Yau’s The United States of Jasper Johns (1996) a Publishers Weekly writer commented: “If you already have a weighty, profusely illustrated book on artist Jasper Johns but are still a little bemused, this is the book to buy.” Yau covers the career of the controversial neo-Dadaist painter, from his 1955 Flag to the 1993 After Holbein, deriving much of his text from interviews conducted with the reclusive Johns over a period of fifteen years. “In graceful, accessible prose,” the Publishers Weekly reviewer noted, “Yau deciphers the many art-historical sources within Johns’s art …[and] is capable of crafting the single phrase, such as ‘visual echo,’ that describes the activity within Johns’s work.” In addition to Johns, who he also wrote about in A Thing Among Things: The Art of Jasper Johns (2008), Yau has written on artists such as Andy Warhol, Joe Coleman, James Castle, and Kay Walkingstick. He has also collaborated with artists Archie Rand, Thomas Nozkowski, and Leiko Ikemura in poetry and art books like Hundred More Jokes from the Book of the Dead (2001), Ing Grish (2005), and Andalusia (2006).

In addition, these years demarcate Patterson’s gradual re-commitment to performance art and expressions of Fluxus at the turn of the century. His peripatetic, bi-continental lifestyle was as much a direct function of asserting hypervisibility in response to historical erasure as it was a refusal of the precarity facing most artists stateside. Patterson’s pursuit of international audiences and communities actively engenders multinational and spatiosocial relationships that require observers and scholars to deconstruct implicit and explicit nationalist biases. This talk will consider three cases in which the artist’s movement calls for a language and interpretive framework beyond the rhetoric of escape. I highlight how Patterson’s claim to multiple centers connects to an ideological act of self-possession. By emphasizing the usability of transnational scholarship to recover his history, I will also explore the necessity for addressing scholarly positionality to place and its impact on his work, identity, and the site specificity of archives.\n\njulia elizabeth neal (she/her) is an Assistant Professor of Modern and Contemporary Art of the United States at the University of Michigan. She concentrates on conceptual, sonic, and performance-based practices by artists of African descent. In her research, neal attends to critical intersections between the visual, the politics of identity and (trans)nationalism since the postwar era. Her scholarship considers the centrality of the nation state to art and politics, as well as sound art, and gaming as alternative platforms for abstract thought and perception. She incorporates archival study, critical historiography, deconstruction, and critical race theory to investigate problematics of power and representation.\n\nneal’s book project extends from her dissertation on the intermedia art praxis of Benjamin Patterson, which historicizes his commitment to deconstructing sociocultural perceptions and value systems as he sought alternative strategies for artistic and social criticality. Her research on the artist is supported by the German-American Fulbright Commission, the Getty Research Institute, the Terra Foundation for American Art and Spelman College.

But taking that research into book form, I realized that the history that demanded to be written required both new ways of thinking and new material sources.\n\nAs an artist and curator used to writing 300-word curatorial or project statements, I will share my learning process in taking a deep and sustained dive into writing a new history, that of women and non-binary makers in the woodshop. Seeking an expanded research process—drawing on secondary sources that included published academic research, print materials, and found photographs from internet sources as diverse as eBay, YouTube, and Instagram—my understandings were challenged, reshaped, and expanded. The resulting book was made better at each step.\n\nDeirdre Visser (she/her) is Visiting Curator at Mills College at Northeastern University, and an independent writer, curator, and artist living in San Francisco’s Mission District. Curator of The Arts at CIIS from 2010-2022, Visser mounted exhibitions and programming featuring some of the most critical voices of our time, including: Rick Lowe, Dr. Deborah Willis, Amalia Mesa Bains, Wendel White, Zora Murff, and Mia Nakano. Like her curatorial practice, her writing and visual art is rooted in the belief that arts and culture advance civic participation and engagement in our communities and provide us invaluable tools and languages to tell stories too long unheard, catalyzing and nourishing discourse across differences.\n\nIn 2019 Deirdre co-curated Making a Seat at the Table with Laura Mays, which opened that fall at the Center for Art in Wood in Philadelphia. This exhibition showcased the work of 43 women and non-binary woodworkers who are expanding the practice while holding down the center. In March 2022 Routledge released her book, Joinery, Joists and Gender: a History of Woodworking for the 21st Century, the first written history of women and gender non-conforming makers in the woodshop.\n\nShe is also engaged with the arts as a form of civic participation, working for the past decade with the Skywatchers Ensemble, a radically relational and enduring community arts collaboration in San Francisco's Tenderloin district.

While scholars have examined the videotaped beating and documentation of the unrest, few have explored the potential of art as an important record. In this lecture, Dr. Rose Salseda will recover the missing historical narrative through the analysis of Adrian Piper’s Black Box/White Box (1992), a multimedia installation that combines minimalism’s sleek aesthetic with jarring visual and auditory devices. Also incorporating Piper’s writing and references to music and literature, Dr. Salseda reveals Piper’s strategies to engage viewers in examining how white supremacy and xenophobia characterize both the King beating and the nation’s treatment of African Americans throughout history.\n\nDr. Rose Salseda is an assistant professor of Art & Art History at Stanford University. Specializing in the fields of African American and U.S. Latinx art, and with a research background in the art of the African Diaspora in Latin America and the Caribbean, Dr. Salseda’s research explores the politics of race, identity, and representation as well as the intergenerational, cross-racial, and immigrant experiences of anti-Black racism and xenophobia.\n\nENTRY DETAILS:\n\n195 De Haro, San Francisco, CA, 94107\n\nFree and open to the public.

Why, and to what ends? And why—or so I argue—is at the core of phenomenological method. Why, and to what ends? And why—or so I argue—is it a vital practice when seeking to engage hospitably and innovatively within spaces and scenarios of the most challenging kind?\n\nIn this talk (which will also have a practical element, so please bring an image of your choice—perhaps an image you are currently thinking or writing about) we will consider the critical and decolonising/self-decolonising force of description, and its capacities to open up previously disregarded terrain. Our key texts are a short text by the French phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty from 1954 called 'On News Items' and an article by me titled ‘Interviewing Images: How visual research using IPA (Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis) can illuminate the change-making possibilities of place, space, and dwelling’ (2020).\n\nJorella Andrews is Professor of Visual Cultures in the Department of Visual Cultures, Goldsmiths, University of London. In her research, writing and teaching, she examines the relations between philosophical inquiry, the image-world, and art practice. Her current focus is on the practical potential of aesthetics and image-based phenomenological research to intervene in key areas of contemporary concern such as the development of non-ego-centric approaches to personal and collective identity, the importance of self-directed, situated learning in academic and non-academic contexts, and the development of non-coercive approaches to change-making in personal and public life. These interests intersect with her long history of community-based activity, as an academic but also as a volunteer in the London borough of Lewisham where she lives and works. She is the author of several books and articles, including two monographs, The Question of Painting: Rethinking Thought with Merleau-Ponty and Showing Off! A Philosophy of Image (2018 and 2014, both Bloomsbury) and edits the Visual Cultures as… series (Sternberg Press/MIT).\n\nENTRY DETAILS\n\nZOOM: VCS Forum | Jorella Andrews\n\nFree and open to the public\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Wind in My Hair: Women, Life, Freedom\n\nOne Day Public event, Live Performance, Poem Reading, and Artists’ Talks to Show Our Community Solidarity with Brave Women in Iran.\n\nThe Wind In My Hair is an event organized by VCS graduate student Katayoun Bahrami and presented by Clarion Alley Mural Project, in collaboration with CCA Center for Art and Public Life and ARTogether showcasing the Iranian community and their allies in the Bay Area and beyond, to stand in solidarity with Iranian women and to call for the end of excessive violence against protesters in Iran.

Gone are the days of the neutral librarian. How archives are collected, defined, described and accessed has become contested territory. For myself, as a San Francisco citizen and an archivist, these two roles become intertwined when processing archival collections that document the San Francisco urban culture where I am invested in living and that I am preserving for a larger public. It is the production of the archival body that is being redefined and I will share the everyday lived experience of being a photo archivist in an urban public library setting. As a curator and an archivist, this talk will reflect on the stakes involved in preserving, presenting and interpreting the visual history of the city.\n\nChristina Moretta is Photo Curator at the San Francisco History Center, San Francisco Public Library. Notwithstanding the specificity of her job title, she wears many professional hats: that of an archivist, appraising, acquiring, arranging and describing archival collections; that of a librarian, unraveling the mysteries of San Francisco just a bit more with each reference query; that of a rights manager, helping filmmakers, authors and curators use and publish visual gems from the archives; that of a teacher, sharing the world of primary resources to students of all levels and disciplines; and that of a history nerd, distributing rare facts as she walks around town with indulgent friends and family. Her workplace serves as the official archives for the City & County of San Francisco and its San Francisco Historical Photograph Collection has over two million visual materials documenting San Francisco and the Bay Area.\n\nMoretta holds a B.A. in History and Women’s Studies from University of California, Irvine, a M.L.I.S. with a focus on archival studies from San Jose State University and an M.A. in History from San Francisco State University.

Throughout this period, feminist and gay activists fought social and political battles to expand, transform, or wholly explode definitions of so called “normal” gender and sexuality. In doing so, they inspired artists, writers, and filmmakers to invent new ways of formally representing, or giving shape to, non-normative genders and sexualities. This included placing women, queers, and gender outlaws of all stripes into exhilarating new environments—from the streets of an increasingly gay San Francisco to a post-apocalyptic commune, from an upper-East Side New York City apartment to an all-female version of Earth— and finding new ways to formally render queer genders and sexualities by articulating them to figures, outlines, or icons that could be imagined in the mind’s eye and interpreted by diverse publics. Surprisingly, such creative attempts to represent queer gender and sexuality often appeared in a range of traditional, or seemingly generic, popular forms including the sequential format of comic strip serials, the token figures of science fiction genre, the narrative conventions of film melodrama, and the serialized rhythm of installment fiction. Through studies of queer and feminist cultural productions including Mart Crowley’s The Boys in the Band (1970), Armistead Maupin’s Tales of the City (1976-1983), Lizzie Borden’s Born in Flames (1983), and Tony Kushner’s Angels in America (1989-1991), Fawaz show how artists innovated in many popular mediums and genres to make the experience of gender and sexual non-conformity recognizable to mass audiences in the modern US. Ultimately, Queer Forms tells the pre-history of the contemporary renaissance in feminist and LGBTQ political cultures by developing a genealogy of late twentieth-century artifacts that projected images of gender and sexual rebellion, which came to infuse the American popular imagination in the 1970s and after.\n\nAbout \"Queer Love on Barbary Lane: The Serial Experience of Coming Out of the Closet with Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City\" Ramzi Fawaz says:\n\nIn this talk, I analyze the content and reading experience of Armistead Maupin’s Tales of the City, the most popular serialized gay fiction of the 1970s, which appeared in daily installments in the San Francisco Chronicle between 1976-1983. I argue that the serialized rhythm of the narrative—which followed the social and sexual misadventures of a cadre of queer friends in San Francisco’s Nob Hill neighborhood—modeled gay liberation’s conception of “coming out of the closet” about one’s sexuality as a process that unfolds over time through repeated encounters with new erotic possibilities. I draw upon interviews I conducted with actual San Francisco readers of Maupin’s original text alongside close analysis of the rhetorical and literary modes of address that Maupin deployed to make “coming out” a widely accessible form for articulating one’s sexual and social desires, regardless of one’s specific sexual identity. I show the story’s unfolding narrative about 1970s queer social life and the actual experience of reading it daily alongside other San Francisco residents helped disseminate the radical sexual politics of gay liberation to both gay and straight audiences alike.\n\nAfter his lecture, Professor Fawaz will be in conversation with Professor Jeanette Roan (CCA History of Art and Visual Culture and Visual & Critical Studies programs). Dr. Roan is an interdisciplinary scholar. She is working on a study of graphic novels and comics from the perspective of visual studies theories and methodologies, with a particular emphasis on Asian American comics creators and representations of racial identity.

Hyper-policed by state and society, passed over for housing and jobs, and derided and misdiagnosed by medical professionals, fat Black people in the United States are subject to socio-politically sanctioned discrimination, abuse, condescension, and trauma.\n\nDa’Shaun Harrison—a fat, Black, disabled, and nonbinary trans writer—offers an incisive, fresh, and precise exploration of anti-fatness as anti-Blackness. In their writing and work they take on desirability politics, the limitations of gender, the connection between anti-fatness and the carceral system, as well as the incongruity of “health” and “healthiness” for the Black fat, illustrating the myriad harms of anti-fat anti-Blackness. They offer strategies for dismantling denial, unlearning the cultural programming that tells us “bad,” and destroying the world as we know it, so Black fat people can inhabit a place not built on their subjugation.\n\nDa'Shaun Harrison is a Black, fat, queer, and trans theorist and abolitionist in Atlanta, GA. Harrison is the author of Belly of the Beast: The Politics of Anti-Fatness as Anti-Blackness, and is a public speaker who often gives talks and leads workshops on Blackness, queerness, gender, fatness, disabilities, and their intersections. Harrison currently serves as the Editor-at-Large for Scalawag Magazine.\n\nHarrison will be in conversation with Ajuan Mance, artist, writer, and Professor of African American literature at Mills College, Oakland.\n\nAnti-Black Anti-Fatness and Desire is co-hosted by the Wattis Institute with the Graduate Program in Visual & Critical Studies and is organized by Jacqueline Francis, Diego Villalobos, and Kim Nguyen.

We carry the words of Dionne Brand with each iteration: I don’t want no fucking country, here or there and all the way back, I don’t like it, none of it, easy as that. I’m giving up on land to light on, and why not, I can’t perfect my own shadow, my violent sorrow, my individual wrists.\n\nView Event →\n\nPJ DIPIETRO - TRANS OF COLOR IS AN OXYMORON: HUMANS, NONHUMAN ANIMALS, AND BODIES BENEATH ANIMALS\n\nPART OF EVENT SERIES: VISUAL & CRITICAL STUDIES FORUM | 2021/2022 SERIES\n\nORGANIZED BY\n\nVisual & Critical Studies\n\nnjwhittington@cca.edu\n\nEVENT DESCRIPTION\n\nPJ DiPietro\n\nTOPIC: Trans of Color Is an Oxymoron: Humans, Nonhuman Animals, and Bodies Beneath Animals\n\nPJ DiPietro works at the intersection of decolonial feminism, women of color thinking, Latinx studies, and trans* studies.

His first book-length study, The Nature of the Beast: Cultural Diversity and the Visual Arts Sector, A Study of Policies, Initiatives and Attitudes 1976-2006, offered hitherto unseen insight into the mechanisms and machinations behind ‘ethnic arts’, ‘black arts’ and ‘new internationalism’ and ‘culturally diverse arts’. Awarded a PhD in 2018 from Goldsmiths College, University of London, Hylton’s work is now broadly concerned with the politics of Black Diasporic art and art history. He is currently writing a monograph on Donald Rodney (1961-1998) one of the most important but equally underrepresented British artist of his generation. The history of African American art in the international arena also figures prominently in Hylton’s scholarship, resulting in published essays in the Routledge Companion to African American Art History; the International Review of African American, Art Review and Art Monthly.
