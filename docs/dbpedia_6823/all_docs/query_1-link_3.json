        "text": "Filming with Kai, a trans boy, for the past 10 years has been an incredibly powerful experience. It's shown the world that young people do know who they are, and that they should be allowed to explore their gender identity without fear or judgement. For me, being able to film with Kai has been healing in a deeply personal way. I struggled with my own lack of boyhood growing up, and had little understanding of trans issues. I spent much of my life trying desperately to conform to societal expectations of what it meant to be a female. Through Kai's journey, I've been able to explore my own experiences and begin to heal from them. Seeing Kai's resilience and determination to live authentically has been nothing short of inspiring. In today's increasingly difficult climate in the UK, where it's often difficult for trans individuals to access healthcare and feel supported due to the transphobia being given a platform, it's more important than ever to tell stories like Kai's. Simply put, Kai is a boy and deserves to be supported. By making this film, I've been able to live through Kai and continue my own healing process. I hope that Kai's story can inspire others to be true to themselves and to support those around them who are doing the same. A message from Kai: \"I came out as a trans boy when I was 9 years old, and ever since then, I've been wearing a binder to try and alleviate my dysphoria. But after 9 years of wearing a tight, restrictive binder every day, I'm ready for the next step in my journey: top surgery. It's been a long and difficult road, and waiting another 5 years on the NHS is just too much to bear. I'm so grateful to Fox Fisher and My Genderation for their ongoing support, and for helping to share my story with the world. Through our films, we've been able to reach so many people and raise awareness about the struggles that trans people face every day. I'm overwhelmed by the response that our films have received - over 1 million views! It's clear that there's a hunger for authentic, honest storytelling about the trans experience, and I'm proud to be a part of that. But most of all, I'm hopeful that with the help of our community, we can raise enough funds for me to finally get the top surgery that I need. It's a crucial step in my journey, and one that I'm ready to take. Thank you to everyone who has supported me so far - I couldn't do this without you.\" Fundraiser: https://lnkd.in/ex5my5VB Press: https://lnkd.in/e9p7h9Zc #TDOV #transdayofvisibility #LGBT #lgbtcommunity #lgbtqia #diversityandinclusion #diversity"
