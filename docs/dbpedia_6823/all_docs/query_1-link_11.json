Initiative Arts in Manchester is creating an art exhibition and lasting memory of the endangered language!\n\nHear the inspirational story of April Ashley…\n\nLiverpool-born April Ashley was one of the first people in the world to have gender reassignment surgery. She is a main focus of the Museum of Liverpool’s major Homotopia exhibition which looked at the social and legal changes affecting LGBT people over the past 70 years.\n\nExplore LGBT life in Manchester and Burnley…\n\nThe Lesbian and Gay Foundation are exploring LGBT heritage with a particular focus on Greater Manchester. An online timeline was created featuring key dates and figures from the last century such as Section 28 Legislation and Alan Turing.\n\nMemories and stories from Burnley’s LGBT community were collected and celebrated by the Lancashire LGBT Centre in the run up to the town’s first Pride event."
