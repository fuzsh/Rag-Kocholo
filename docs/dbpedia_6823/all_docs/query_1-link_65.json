        "text": "That's why we inclusion, access and participation is one of the four investment principles that guide our grant decision making.\n\nSince 1994 we've invested over £12million across the UK in sharing stories of LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and other identities) heritage, creativity, activism and much more.\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has increased loneliness and social isolation for many of us, including younger people and some LGBTQ+ people. It has never been more important to have reminders of the power of heritage in our relationships with each other, connecting past and present and strengthening our local communities.\n\nLiz Ellis, Heritage Fund Policy Project Manager for inclusion\n\nHere are some of the inspirational LGBTQ+ heritage projects we've been proud to fund. And if you've got an idea for a project, we'd love to hear from you.\n\nThe terms we use\n\nAt The National Lottery Heritage Fund, we use the acronym LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer). The ‘+’ represents people who identify as non-binary, intersex, asexual and other identities.\n\nWe use these acronyms because we believe they are widely understood. Identities can be complex and intersectional, and we are also aware that for many these terms may feel inadequate or limiting. We keep the language we use constantly under review."
