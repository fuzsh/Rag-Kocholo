        "text": "Lon Nol (born Nov. 13, 1913, Prey Vêng, Cambodia—died Nov. 17, 1985, Fullerton, Calif., U.S.) was a soldier and politician whose overthrow of Prince Norodom Sihanouk (1970) involved Cambodia in the Indochina war and ended in the takeover (1975) of the country by the communist Khmer Rouge.\n\nLon Nol entered the French colonial service in 1937 and became a magistrate, then a provincial governor and head of the national police (1951). He joined the army in 1952 and fought against intruding Vietnamese communist guerrillas in Cambodia as an area commander. After again serving as a provincial governor, he became Cambodian army chief of staff (1955) and commander in chief (1960) under the country’s leader, Prince Norodom Sihanouk. He was deputy premier (1963), minister of defense (1968–69), and twice premier (1966–67 and from 1969) under Sihanouk.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Quiz: 19 Things to Know About the Vietnam War"
