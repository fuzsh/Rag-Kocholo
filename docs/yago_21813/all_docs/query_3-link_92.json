        "text": "Often teaching about Cambodia focuses on two key historical events: the Kingdom of Angkor of the ninth to fifteenth centuries and the Khmer Rouge Genocide of 1975-1979. For students in my undergraduate classrooms, when I ask what they know about Cambodia, if they have any baseline knowledge at all, discussion of the country is generally synonymous with Pol Pot and the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime. Many students are exposed to this history through books like First They Killed My Father which they were assigned to read or watch in high school. 1 This horrific event, where one in four Cambodians are estimated to have perished either through murder, starvation, or disease, is significant recent history. However, instructional content on Cambodia can and should go further. In this essay I offer a rationale and strategies for enriching the exploration of contemporary Cambodia through the films of one innovative Cambodian film studio, Anti-Archive.\n\nOn January 7 1979, forces of the Vietnamese Army entered the ghost city of Phnom Penh. Surprisingly enough, the images diffused over the following weeks and months were rather dismaying and even surrealistic. The peak of the imagery was represented by an appalling ten-minute piece showing the discovery of S-21. The purpose of this text is closely analyze the genres of images (liberators, perpetrators...) used to represent the Cambodian Genocide during almost four decades, cinematic as well as photographic.\n\nAs a harrowing sub-discipline of English and Comparative Literature, Trauma Studies is in need of geographical expansion beyond its moorings in European genocides of the 20th century. In this article, the authors chart the institutional and cinematic appropriation of atrocity images in relation to the Khmer Rouge’s auto-genocide from 1975–1979 in Cambodia. They analyse the cultural and scholarly value of these images in conjunction with genocide studies to reveal principles often overlooked, taken for granted, or pushed to the periphery in photography studies and film studies. Through grim appropriations of archival or news footage to more experimental approaches in documentary, such as the use of dioramas, the authors examine the commercial and artistic articulations of trauma, reconciliation and testimony in two case studies: The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) exhibition Photographs from S-21: 1975–1979 (1997) and Pithy Panh’s documentary The Missing Picture (2013). The authors first focus on the relatively obscure scholarship devoted to contextualizing images from international genocides outside the Euro-American canon for genocide study in order to build their critical formulations; they go on to explore whether these atrocity-themed still and moving images are capable of defying aspects of commodification and sensationalism to instead convey positive notions of commemoration and memory. Finally, their contribution to this debate regarding the merit of appropriating atrocity imagery is viewed from two perspectives: ‘commodified witnessing’ (a negative descriptor for the MoMA exhibition) and ‘commemorative witnessing’ (a positive term for the Cambodian film). Keywords atrocity images, auto-genocide, Cambodia, commemorative witnessing, commodified witnessing, globalizing trauma studies, The Missing Picture, Photographs from S-21: 1975–1979, photography\n\nIf there is a period in Cambodia’s history that has been overlooked and disparaged, it is certainly the republican one (1970–1975). The Khmer Republic is often viewed as a corrupt, incompetent regime – an interregnum doomed to failure. This article revisits this narrative through currently available written sources. It argues that a cultural approach to the existing records helps us understand how such a negative view, still prevailing today, was discursively constructed. The analysis of the interpretations of a range of protagonists, observers and academics contributes to a critical historiography that might challenge assumptions and clichés about the Republic. This implies a re-working of the ‘republican archive’, a multiform and scattered body that presents a structural imbalance due to the discrepancy between the limited sources coming from the Republic itself and the significant amount of US records. The article reassembles these archival materials. It proposes a different reading of these documents in terms of discipline. It suggests that this might be the first step towards reassessing the Republic and the two dominant themes of that period: the overthrow of head of state, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, in 1970 (which marked the end of the monarchy) and the civil war. Part of the research for this paper was made possible through the COTCA Project, and therefore received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant no. 682081).\n\nThis paper examines out the particular role of the civil society organisation known as the Bophana Audiovisual Resource Centre, an audio-visual resource centre in Cambodia, in the legal outreach work of Cambodia's internationalised criminal tribunal. The Bophana Centre was co-founded by Cambodian-born and French-educated filmmaker Rithy Panh in 2006. Particular attention is paid to Bophana’s co-development of films that have been shown to legal outreach audiences across the country, as well as to the material assistance offered to the ECCC Public Affairs Section in showing such films. A preliminary account of Bophana's Khmer Rouge History 'App' (launched in mid-2017), formally recognised by the ECCC as a reparation project, is also given. Links between Panh's and Bophana’s work are critically examined in the context of Cambodian public memory of the Khmer Rouge period both prior to, and as an integral part of, the current tribunal.\n\nThis essay aims, first, to describe the under-theorized recent remarkable renaissance of post-Khmer Rouge (KR) cinema generated by women directors, which emerged after the KR regime (1975–79) murdered most of the filmmakers and demolished almost the entire Cambodian film industry; and, second, to analyze first- and second-generation post-traumatic autobiographical (or semi-autobiographical) fiction and non-fiction films that deal with the almost-tabooi-ized issue of perpetratorhood within the family (or symbolic family). Defining the term autogenocide will serve as the basis for an analysis of two prominent films that render narratives of encounters with low-ranking perpetrators in the shadow of the ongoing controversy over the remit of the KR tribunal (ECCC) to try only high-ranking perpetrators. Sotho Kulikar’s fiction film The Last Reel (2014) and Neary Adeline Hay’s non-fiction film Angkar (2018) propose postgenocide ethics embodied on a spectrum of forgiveness from aporetic reconciliation to un-forgiving. It is through this latter inclination towards un-forgiving that secondgeneration women’s cinema subverts the first generation’s reconciled attitude towards the perpetrators, and, most importantly, the perpetrators’ denial and lack of accountability and atonement. Thus, the new wave of Cambodian women’s cinema advances the possibility of cinematic creation of ethical communities, moving Cambodia towards a culture of accountability."
