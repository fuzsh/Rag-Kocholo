        "text": "Norodom Sihanouk, the former Cambodian king who was a key figure through decades of upheaval, has died.\n\nThe former king died at a hospital in the Chinese capital, Beijing, after having a heart attack. He had been in poor health for several years.\n\nSihanouk, who was 89, came to the throne in 1941 and led Cambodia to independence from France in 1953.\n\nDespite long periods of exile and his abdication in 2004 due to ill health, he remained an influential figure.\n\nSihanouk abdicated in 2004 in favour of his son, King Norodom Sihamoni.\n\n\"His death was a great loss to Cambodia,\" said his assistant and relative Prince Sisowath Thomico. \"King Sihanouk did not belong to his family, he belonged to Cambodia and to history.\"\n\nHis body is expected to be returned to Cambodia and go on display for three months in the capital Phnom Penh before an official funeral at the royal palace.\n\nKing Sihamoni and Prime Minister Hun Sen have flown to Beijing to accompany the late king home.\n\nA statement from China's foreign ministry hailed Sihanouk as a \"great friend of the Chinese people\".\n\nJapan's top government spokesman said without him \"there could not have been success in the Cambodian peace process\".\n\nBorn in 1922, Sihanouk was the eldest son of King Norodom Suramarit and Queen Kossamak.\n\nEducated at French schools in Saigon and in Paris, the Nazi-controlled Vichy government in France crowned Sihanouk king of Cambodia in 1941, bypassing his father in the hope that the 18-year-old could easily be manipulated.\n\nHowever, after the war Sihanouk embarked on an international campaign aimed at ensuring independence for Cambodia.\n\nIt was achieved without bloodshed in 1953 - after nearly a century of French rule. Two years later Sihanouk abdicated in favour of his father and became both prime minister and foreign minister of his country.\n\nHe tried - but failed - to keep the country from the Cold War conflict that engulfed South East Asia in the 1970s.\n\nWhen a US-backed coup installed Lon Nol as Cambodia's leader, Sihanouk - by then alienated by US bombing raids on Vietnamese communist guerrillas inside Cambodia - was forced into exile in Beijing.\n\nIt was from there that he struck an ill-fated deal with the emerging Maoist rebel force, the Khmer Rouge. When the Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975, Sihanouk returned as head of state but was subsequently detained.\n\nHe remained confined to the royal palace for most of the four years of the regime's rule, during which time an estimated 1.7 million people died.\n\nPeople were killed or worked and starved to death, as the Khmer Rouge emptied cities and forced Cambodians to work on the land.\n\nSihanouk later condemned the Khmer Rouge for the deaths of the Cambodians, including of several of his own children.\n\nWhen Vietnamese forces ousted the Khmer Rouge, Sihanouk went again to Beijing. He was to remain outside the country for 13 years, as Cambodia faced civil war and the struggle to rebuild from economic devastation."
