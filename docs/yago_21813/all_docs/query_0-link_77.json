        "text": "I’ve always loved Kampot, as regular readers of my blog will know, so when I was invited to join a motorbike trip down to the province for the Buddhist festival, Pchum Ben, I could hardly say no, much to my parents’ horror (sorry parentals!) The roads in Cambodia aren’t exactly known for their impeccable safety record but I was riding with a Khmer friend who’s been driving motorbikes for half his life so I knew I was in safe hands.\n\nThere was a group of ten of us in total, riding down on six bikes: myself, Vanny, Emily, Veasna, Jacinta, Ehud, Jenna, Pov, Serai, and Yuri. The ride took about four hours, including a relaxed breakfast stop and the occasional break to ease our aching butts. We arrived completely unharmed, despite a slightly close call between my kneecap and a white van. But we made it: look!\n\nAnd because the whole point of this holiday was motorbiking, after we settled into our accommodation we rode up to Ta Da Waterfall (yes, that is actually its name). A new attraction for tourists in Kampot, I’m sure this would have been an incredible site if half of Phnom Penh hadn’t decided to visit at the same time. We still had fun and the scenery was stunning but it was rather overcrowded. And the water was freezing cold!\n\nThe next day was the focal point of our trip: a drive up Bokor Mountain. This national park is one of Cambodia’s treasures and significant (Chinese) investment means the road up to the top is in great condition. We visited a second waterfall which was much quieter than the one from the previous day, thank goodness! And then, after literally driving through a cloud and getting rather wet, we arrived at the old casino, one of my favourite places in Cambodia. This old building was built by the French colonists but later used as a Khmer Rouge stronghold and stripped of its former glory. The result is an eery yet beautiful building, succumbing to the elements and perched on a cliff edge overlooking the sea. At least, it would be overlooking the sea if there hadn’t been a cloud there …\n\nAfter meandering safely down Bokor’s jungle-covered sides, we headed to Kep, the small seaside town/province just half an hour from Kampot. Once again the beach was heaving with holidaying Khmers so our swim in the sea was undertaken semi-clothed (bikinis would have been wildly inappropriate). We then sat on the sand, played frisbee, and ate copious amounts of delicious squid. Kep is well known for its seafood so that evening saw feasts of crab, shrimp, and fish at one of the seafront restaurants. Crab is more hassle than it’s worth, in my opinion.\n\nThe following day it was back to Kampot for sunbathing, reading, and drinking coffee. Vanny and I went for a ride through the country and took in a little of the local lifestyle in the area, as well as visiting a pagoda. It was Pchum Ben, after all. The green of the paddy fields during the rainy season is just out of this world: it’s my favourite ever colour.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nAmazing as it was to be riding around for the entire weekend, Vanny and I decided against slogging back up the inevitably busy road on the final day of Pchum Ben. So we took the train. Yes, Cambodia now has a fully functioning railway. Ok, not fully functioning … it runs from Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville via Takeo and Kampot. And it was over an hour later arriving. But strangely it got to Phnom Penh bang on time, passing completely stationary traffic jams, much to the amusement of the train passengers! The journey itself was fine: very Khmer (karaoke videos, loud music, children wandering up and down the aisle talking to strangers, people snacking on baby birds etc) but it was cheap and hassle-free. Oh yeah and for an extra five bucks we got the moto back too …\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nAll in all I had an awesome Pchum Ben, spending time with a great new group of people and seeing more of Cambodia than ever before from the saddle of a bike.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nLast week I went on a two day trip to SKOPE’s newest partner school. Located in the heart of Kampong Speu Province, nestled amongst the trees, is Karuna Youth Cambodia. Founded in 2011 by their young director, Phearith, KYC is an NGO which focuses on community-based education projects. The village of Chherteal Chrum is unassuming and from the outside looks like any other rural Cambodian community. But the children here are luckier than most and six days a week 250 of them are able to attend free English and Computer Studies lessons at KYC.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe school is small; just one classroom and a narrow corridor which acts as a computer lab. There’s also a small meeting room and performance area (Phearith is looking to begin a traditional arts education programme soon). The playground and surrounding greenery is beautiful and at the far end of the property stands the solar-powered Rainbow House, built to accommodate future volunteers, complete with bathroom, living area, television and mezzanine bedroom.\n\nMy trip out to the village took three hours in a local bus-taxi. Usually there are upwards of twenty people crammed into a twelve-seater van but I was lucky. Just me and four Cambodian men. Oh, and a huge bag of alive crickets. The countryside in Cambodia is beautiful, especially in Kampong Speu which is home to the Aural mountain range, the largest in the country, so the drive was delightful. When I arrived at the edge of the village, a man took me by moto to the school where I met Phearith and got the tour of the complex. It is a little haven of comparative luxury; electricity, running water (sort of), English-speakers, and delicious Khmer food.\n\nI was waited on hand and foot by the family whose property borders the school. The women cooked incredible dishes for me throughout my time there and I was very impressed by their skills and hospitality despite them not speaking a word of English. The school ran until four in the afternoon at which point Phearith and I went for stroll around the village. I’ll let the photos speak for themselves here … Basically, it was one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever seen.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThat evening the villagers were all invited to join us at the school as a celebration. Whether it was because Phearith was taking his monthly visit to the site (he is based in Phnom Penh where KYC also operates) or because I was there remains unclear. But I’d like to think it was the latter. Of course dinner wasn’t on time so we wiled away the wait by singing karaoke (not me, don’t worry) and watching a zombie movie which had all the women who had already arrived screaming and the kids hiding behind their hands. Due to the fact that I was sleeping in a wooden house on my own at the end of a school garden in an unknown village, I opted to read on my phone rather than watch …\n\nThe following day I spent time with the school children who had come to study. The centre is open all the time and many came hours before their lessons to play with friends and hang out in a safe, clean space. I wandered around, chatted to a couple of them, and then settled down to read a Dr Seuss book to a group of students who were waiting for their class to begin. They were so engaged in it, despite not understanding a lot of the text and I suddenly remembered how much I enjoyed teaching.\n\nThe teachers at the school are past students who have studied in Phnom Penh on scholarships from KYC. Whilst their English is good, there is no substitute for native teaching and this is what KYC and SKOPE are partnering on. As of October 2016 we are launching a volunteer program. These volunteers will live on-site in the Rainbow House, be provided with free meals and teaching supplies, and get an incredible experience of life in Cambodian countryside. The program is free although if volunteers want to make a donation towards the school or to cover the costs of the food/housing, they may do so at their discretion. Transport to the site will be organised either by me or Phearith and I may even come with volunteers to settle them in (plus I loved in there and would happily go back any time).\n\nHere I must point out that there has been a lot of press recently about the negative impacts of ‘volunteerism’. KYC and SKOPE are working together to ensure that any and all of the issues raised regarding volunteerism are addressed and eliminated. Both organisations believe in sustainable, community-based practices and we endeavour to do our best for the children we are working with. I will be writing a blog some time over the next few days on volunteerism, SKOPE, Cambodia, and my thoughts more generally.\n\nIf you’re interested in volunteering for KYC, please fill out the form below. Alternatively you may contact me (SKOPE@sovannkomar.org) or Phearith (kyclub.info@gmail.com).\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nTen years ago today, my feet first touched Cambodian soil. I had no idea that a decade later I would be living and working in that very same country with no plans to leave any time soon. I came to Cambodia as part of a one month expedition, which also included Thailand, with a company called World Challenge. We were doing their ‘Team Challenge’ expedition and I was part of a twelve-strong group of sixteen and seventeen year olds from my secondary school. We’d spent close to two years raising the £3,000+ each to go on the trip and it all boiled down to four weeks in South East Asia. At the time, it wasn’t one of the best experiences of my life, predominantly because of our incredibly unpleasant team leader whom we later got fired from World Challenge. I think our troubles in Thailand left a sour taste at the end of our travels but when I was planning my gap year two years later, there was only one country I wanted to go to: Cambodia. Since then, I’ve never looked back. In between finishing high school, getting my undergraduate degree and then my masters, I have spent a combined total of three years in Cambodia so far. Over the past ten years I’ve worked for numerous NGOs, taught hundreds of children, lived with lots of different people, and made some of the very best friends in the world.\n\nIn honour of this milestone, I’ve been re-reading the diary I kept when I was travelling. Some of it could have been written by me yesterday. Some of it was clearly written by a sixteen year old with no understanding of the possessive apostrophe (I’ve had to correct them grammatically to publish here because it’s just embarrassing). Anyway, here are some extracts for your enjoyment.\n\nSaturday 15th July 2006 – Arriving in Cambodia\n\nIt’s beautiful and outside the city it reminds me of Spain/Mallorca but the hustle and bustle of the centre is amazingly different to anything I’ve ever experienced. There are thousands and thousands of motorbikes, many of which have two or more people on. The current record is 5! I saw a mother feeding a baby on one and very few riders wear a helmet … We passed the Royal Palace and saw lots of children begging. It was really sad as they were all so beautiful. We also saw a man who had been crippled, probably by a mine set down during the wars in Cambodia.\n\nSunday 16th July 2006 – Phnom Penh\n\nI didn’t sleep too well as our window was open and Phnom Penh is the new city that never sleeps! … The killing fields, when we finally arrived, was a very sad place … The mass graves and the signs stating the numbers of the dead that were buried there was a horrible thought but I had no personal experience of it so it did not mean as much to me as other massacres … At dinner we all sampled some delicious Khmer food. It’s very similar to Chinese.\n\nMonday 17th July 2006 – Orphanage Day 1\n\nI was crammed into the minibus and it got called over by police but we don’t know why. The tuk-tuks in front had to swerve across a steady stream of traffic to stop and wait for us. The driving here is crazy! [At the orphanage] we were enthusiastically greeted by beautiful kids … It’s lovely to play with them as they’re all so friendly. I wish I could take some home with me.\n\nWednesday 19th July 2006 – Orphanage Day 3\n\nSome people went to the market today to get sheets, a kettle and underwear as the kids here only have one pair each! Now, thanks to us, they have two … I ate crushed beetles which were actually delicious. In the restaurant we were served an un-gutted fish. It was great fun pulling it apart!\n\nThursday 20th July 2006 – Orphanage Day 4\n\nIt monsooned again today … When it was time to leave we had to wade up to the tuk-tuks. Sometimes the water was over my knees. It was great fun though despite the fact that the water was sewage water and Jo and I saw a syringe and a drip bag which made us really worried about stepping on a needle or anything else. It made us realise what environment these people live in.\n\nSaturday 22nd July 2006 – Orphanage Day 6 (Now known as SOS Day)\n\nA nurse came in to read my blood pressure and heart rate and to take a blood sample … When the doctor came in an examined my ankle he said it was probably a spider bite … and that the spider had left poison in my ankle. He gave me some pills to take every 6 hours and I was put on an IV drip … It was our last day at the orphanage too and the goodbyes were so upsetting as we’re never going to see those kids again.\n\nSunday 23rd July 2006 – Travelling to Siem Reap\n\nThe bus was going at a good speed but I have no idea what that speed was as all the dials had broken. There were loads of cows that seemed to be tied up but we still almost hit some. There were stray dogs and straggly chickens too … Siem Reap is really beautiful and I prefer it to Phnom Penh.\n\nTuesday 25th July 2006 – Angkor Wat\n\nThere is a terrific set of extremely steep steps, very worn and uneven. Adam, Kate and I climbed up them … This sort of climbing would never be allowed in England because of all the healthy and safety procedures! The views were so spectacular that we sat at the top in a window for about an hour … Before leaving Angkor Wat, we all decided to investigate the source of some exotic music. We found a current Buddhist temple. I felt that looking at them was a bit intrusive but I wandered up quickly. I also saw a line of red ants.\n\nWednesday 26th July 2006 – We say ‘lear-en-haoey’ to Cambodia and ‘sa-wat-dee’ to Thailand\n\nThe bus was absolutely tiny! … the road we were on was ridiculously bumpy. At one point I left my seat by 15cm and the sweets on my lap flew down the bus … Kate and Louise were passing the time by counting pigs! … We managed to cross the border without being blown up by a mine which is also very good.\n\nOk so I wasn’t the most eloquent of writers. But a few of these sentences could have been written in one of my current blogs! Some of them, of course, could not. I mean, was I really that insensitive at the Killing Fields? Possibly, I can’t really remember and I was a self-absorbed teenager at the time. But did I really think the genocide I was learning about didn’t mean much because my grandfather wasn’t involved? And just to clarify, Cambodian cuisine has very little in common with the Chinese take-aways I was referring to. Presumably it was because I’d eaten noodles and rice … And the way I talked about the orphanage kids like we were their saviours! It actually sounds like this orphanage was one of the ones the media now warns against. Clearly there was a regular influx of tourists and white money, each group believing they were helping these poor kids who were really just smiling and playing with them because they knew they’d get things bought for them. As for Angkor Wat, health and safety has encroached sadly and you can no longer climb like monkeys over ancient ruins. Although perhaps in terms of preservation, this is a good thing. I also don’t tend to write about seeing a line of ants … Oh and no one says that Khmer I used as a title of the final entry. I’m not even sure what it’s supposed to sound like.\n\nBut what is the same? The crazy roads, ridiculous driving, and lack of helmets. The beggars and cripples near tourist attractions. The noise of the city. Monsoon floods with discarded medical supplies floating in them. Saying goodbye to the kids I work with makes me cry. Buses with speedometers that never work. Cows, dogs and chickens regularly meet their fate on the roads. I still visit that little working temple near Angkor Wat every time I go. The border crossing in Poi Pet is one of the worst in the world.\n\nTen years has passed and Cambodia has certainly changed. I have too, thank goodness. Some changes have been good, others less so. Some of the Cambodia I wrote about ten years ago is recognisable today, other areas have faded away. But one thing remains the same; my unrelenting, deep, and enduring commitment and love to this country and its people. Here’s to the next ten years.\n\nCambodia’s calendar has been woefully lacking in public holidays for the past couple of months. Thankfully that changed this week when we were granted a day off on Monday because of the Buddhist festival Meak Bochea. It had been over a year since I had been to Sihanoukville, the biggest coastal town in Cambodia so a group of friends and I decided to plan a trip there.\n\nWe hired a van and left on Friday night, driving through the dark roads at much faster speeds than the congested day time traffic would allow. There were lots of us going down: me, Rachel, Gloria, Robin, Shelby, Phaline, Varsha, Liz, Hayley, and Tom. We reached the beach by 11:30pm and gratefully breathed in lungfuls of warm salty air. As someone who grew up near the coast, I miss it greatly.\n\nI was sharing a bungalow with Rachel (bestie for the restie) and once we had checked in, we returned to the beach and grabbed a few beers to celebrate our arrival. The beach we had chosen to stay at is called Otres and is a little further down the coast than the main drag, Ocheteaul or Serendipity. The area is generally quieter, cleaner and the atmosphere more relaxed which is exactly what we were looking for.\n\nSaturday morning saw us sunbathing on the beach, swimming in the warm, clear waters and drinking coconut shakes. It was topped off by a wonderful back massage, the oil of which led to me getting rather badly sunburnt but shhhh, don’t tell my mum!\n\nIn the afternoon, I took a tuk tuk over to Ocheteaul beach which, by perfect coincidence, was where Sovann Komar were enjoying their annual holiday. I met up with all the parents and children and played with them in the water for a couple of hours. I also took a frisbee over and had great fun in the surf with some of the children. As always, I managed to capture a few candid shots of their happiness.\n\nSaturday evening saw Rachel and I passing out on our bed. Let’s blame the sun for our pathetic attempt to go out and party. We made it as far as the corner store to buy Oreos and Haribo and then returned to our balcony and drank vodka and pomegranate juice we had bought from home. Frankly, we needed to recuperate after several long weeks at work and the early night was exactly what the doctor ordered.\n\nSunday was … interesting. Jordan and Sophorn had travelled down to join us on Saturday afternoon and we had all decided to book a boat trip. I, however, had momentarily forgotten I hate boats. I do that sometimes. This was an unfortunate time to forget however as the crossing to the first island was by far the worst boat journey I have ever been on. We were close to capsizing several times and the boat took on so much water our driver was bailing it out for about twenty minutes once we arrived at our destination. The swell and the waves crashed around us, soaking everything on the boat. Luckily Shelby had a dry bag so our phones and my camera was safe. My heart rate however, was not.\n\nAs soon as we reached the calm water by a cliff jump, I dived off the boat. It might sound irrational to be afraid of boats as someone who is such a strong swimmer but I guess irrationality is the hallmark of a phobia. Anyway, as soon as I was in the clear, deep water, I felt a million times better. I didn’t do the cliff jumping because I’m also afraid of heights. At this point I was wondering why I’d agreed to go on the boat trip at all.\n\nOur next stop was just around the corner on the same island and was far more to my liking. It was a beautiful beach, and we spent the afternoon there. Sunbathing, swimming, frisbee-ing, eating dinner prepared on the boat, playing drinking games and being interrupted by a grotesquely fat cow, and generally having an awesome time.\n\nEven the dreaded journey back to Otres couldn’t take away from the wonderful afternoon. And, in fact, the trip back was much calmer, the wind having died down and the sea flattering out immeasurably. Sunday evening saw us eating at a beach barbecue place I had first visited in 2009. Ah memories. Oh and I also broke my toe tripping over a rock sticking out of the sand. And before you ask, I’d drunk one beer.\n\nMonday morning involved yet more sunbathing. Rachel and I walked down to the far end of Otres which is even quieter. We found a beach side restaurant that served Pimms and settled on our sun loungers with bags of freshly cut mango, pineapple, and watermelon. Leaving to go back to the hustle and bustle of Phnom Penh was certainly done with some reluctance. I love this city and I love my job but the relaxing, laid-back, and carefree lifestyle at the beach is something I already miss. Ah well, I guess I’ll just have to go back again soon!\n\nThe first of Sovann Komar Outreach Program for Education’s projects has almost come to fruition! Back in September 2015 I published a blog called SKOPE – Helmet and Road Safety Project and now, five months later, we’re about to order our helmets.\n\nThe project basically does what it says on the tin: highlights road safety and provides helmets for the children at Sovann Komar. I had initially planned to buy helmets for all 67 of the children living in the village in addition to their foster parents and the nannies. However, when it comes down to logistics, there is never a time when all the family are out on the motos. If they are all going somewhere together, they’ll take a car. So in order for the money fundraised and donated to go as far as possible, we are going to be providing each house with three or four helmets which can then be shared amongst the children.\n\nRoad traffic accidents kill 500 children every day throughout the world and six people die on Cambodian roads each day too. Collisions are all too common here: I myself have seen two accidents this week. It has somehow, worryingly, become an accepted part of life. Whilst I cannot singlehandedly make the roads safer, I can attempt to protect the children associated with Sovann Komar by providing helmets and this is what SKOPE is going to do.\n\nChoosing the helmet brand was particularly important to me. I saw an advert for helmets outside a supermarket a few weeks ago boasting helmets for children for $1.25. Predictably, they were the flimsiest pieces of plastic I have ever handled and SKOPE is not going to be cutting costs when it comes to child safety. In fact, we’re going to order our helmets from Vietnam. The Asia Injury Prevention NGO works with US chaired company Protec to make US quality motorbike helmets. Today, I went to meet AIP and Protec representatives in Phnom Penh to see their products and speak to them about ordering in bulk for SKOPE.\n\nHelmets need to be sturdy, secure and protective. As soon as I felt the quality of the Protec helmet and the rigidity of the structure, I knew they were far better quality than anything else I have seen in Cambodia. They come in four different sizes which means each child will be able to use a well-fitted helmet and we are going to get the SKOPE logo on each one to advertise our project. Our first task is to fit all the children at Sovann Komar Children’s Village for the right sized helmet and then order them. As soon as this is done I will set about working on getting as many helmets as possible for the children enrolled in Sovann Komar School too. If you would like to donate, please visit our Crowdfunder page. Yesterday I spent some time outside our school filming children arriving and leaving to create a video highlighting how urgent this project really is. Please click here to watch my creation.\n\nEvery time a child climbs onto the back of a moto without a helmet they are risking their lives. A helmet reduces the risk of death by 42% and the risk of a serious injury by 69%. Wearing one is a no-brainer. No pun intended.\n\nWithin a few weeks, every child living in Sovann Komar will have to wear a helmet when they leave the village boundary. If they don’t, they will pay a 50 cent fine (2000 riel). The roads will still be dangerous but at least the children, families and SKOPE are be taking steps to protect these wonderful smiling faces.\n\nIt will be seven years in January since I first left England to live in Cambodia, on and off of course. But it wasn’t until November 2015 that my parents finally came to visit me. And I had to make sure the holiday was worth the wait.\n\nThe route:\n\nSiem Reap\n\nPhnom Penh\n\nKampot\n\nPhnom Penh\n\nMondulkiri\n\nPhnom Penh\n\nThe reason we went to Phnom Penh three times? Because Cambodia’s road network looks like a spider with every highway stemming from the capital and none of them linking up outside of the metropolis.\n\nSo let’s start with the temples in Siem Reap. This wasn’t a difficult part of the holiday to make awesome. I mean, it’s Angkor Wat! The ancient structures wow over one million tourists every year and my parents were among them as we wandered through the colossal stone structures. We actually started, rather unorthodoxly, with Ta Prohm. This is my favourite temple and also the one where Tomb Raider was filmed (for about one minute). It’s been left partially to the jungle with giant trees draped over the stones and undergrowth slowly encroaching from all sides. It’s magical.\n\nOn to Bayon which is part of Angkor Thom. Basically it’s the one with the big faces everyone knows.\n\nAngkor Wat was our final stop on our first day. It’s just as amazing to me now as it first was almost ten years ago. Unfortunately some health and safety laws have come into play (yes even in Cambodia our fun is ruined) and because of building works we weren’t able to climb to the very top. Still pretty cool though, right?\n\nOn our second day we headed out to the Tonle Sap lake where you can visit fishing villages which float on this giant body of water. To be honest, I wouldn’t recommend the experience. I went a few years ago and since then the site has become a money making, tourist extorting, generally unpleasant place to be. The village itself is picturesque but you get constantly asked to donate rice to children who are “orphans”. $50 for a twenty kilo bag of rice! It should cost about $10. And even after I explained that I work at an orphanage, they still tried to get us to donate money. It was pushy, rude, misleading and left us with a sour taste in our mouths. And then to top it off, as soon as we disembarked from the boat, a little girl appeared trying to sell me a ceramic plate with a picture of my own face on! Creepy or what?\n\nThe day got better though when we hiked up a stupidly steep hill to a temple and discovered a wonderful view over the Tonle Sap lake. In fact, after a brief meeting I had arranged for my SKOPE project, we returned that evening and watched a glorious sunset.\n\nThe final day in Siem Reap took us out to the remote temples: Kbal Spean and Banteay Srey. The former is actually not a temple but carvings in a river bed. Different, beautiful, and rewarding after the 1.5km hike up the hill.\n\nBanter Srey was nicer before it made its way onto the Chinese tourist bus route. It’s a tiny temple made of pink sandstone with the most intricate and beautiful carvings over every inch of it.\n\nOn the way back to the city, we stopped at the Landmine Museum where we were lucky enough to arrive at the same time an American worker was starting a tour which was incredibly informative even for someone who’s got a Masters in the subject. That evening we went to the Phare Cambodian Circus – amazing!\n\nI was glad to be leaving Siem Reap, to be honest. I was looking forward to going home and showing my parents a real Cambodian city rather than the tourist centre Siem Reap has become. The weekend in Phnom Penh was touristy too though: Royal Palace, National Museum, Wat Phnom, Riverside, accompanied by several of my favourite restaurants. They only got lost once (well, there was a miscommunication with Tuk Tuk Lady but she was terrified that she’d lost my parents when they didn’t reappear after they went to the Royal Palace!)\n\nKampot remains my favourite place in Cambodia and we spent three full days in the sleepy riverside town. To be honest there isn’t much to say about our wonderfully relaxing time. Our guesthouse, Greenhouse, was right on the bank of the river and my mum and I swam across at least once a day. We took a countryside tour to see the caves and rice paddies one day before having lunch in Kep, a seaside town famous for its crab. We also hired bicycles and cycled up to an old temple. The hill was incredibly steep but I was really looking forward to going back down … until my front tyre got a flat about thirty seconds into my downhill dash. Ever tried to carry a bicycle upside down on the back of a moto? The Khmers make it look easy – it’s not.\n\nBack up to Phnom Penh and my parents came into work with me (after getting lost in a tuk tuk again the night before). It was great for them to meet some of the kids I teach and also the children at Sovann Komar to whom they’ve donated money several times over the years. They also met my bosses and saw me in action in the classroom. My parents wanted to get presents for the kids and I suggested some world maps. Their geographical knowledge is generally poor (one kid pointed to Canada when I asked them to find Cambodia …) and I am really pushing for them to get a greater understanding of the world and other countries.\n\nI then had to work on Saturday in the provinces (blog upcoming about that) so my parents spent Saturday morning doing the necessary but depressing genocide tour – Toul Sleng detention centre and Choeung Ek killing field. But then I returned and cheered them up with a takeaway and Tomb Raider (it’s obligatory viewing if you’re in Cambodia.)\n\nOur final trip was up to Mondulkiri in the east of the country. I’d not been before so I was really excited. The town itself, Sen Monorom, is nothing special but the main attraction of the area are the elephants. There are several sanctuaries working up there to rescue these majestic beasts from logging work, tourist riding companies, and other industries. We first stayed at Tree Lodge in a wooden bungalow but it was a little too rustic even for me. I mean, the spider in our bathroom was, legs included, the size of my hand. And the frog by my bed was huge too. We moved into a place with a ceiling which connected to the walls which connected to the floor the next day. Not sure how much safer it was though because my mum still managed to trip over a drain and fall down that evening. Funny in hindsight, slightly terrifying at the time when heard clattering noise, turned around and saw her rolling into the road.\n\nElephants are amazing. I mean, they’re just incredible. We went with a group called the Mondulkiri Project who have four elephants in 30 hectares of forest. Sophie, Princess, Lucky, and Chi Chan (moon in Khmer). We spent the morning feeding them bananas (Princess lived up to her name and insisted we place the food directly into her mouth) and following them as they wandered freely through the jungle.\n\nWe then had lunch before heading back down and over a “bridge” to a small waterfall where we were split into two groups so we could wash the elephants! One by one, Princess and Lucky waded into the water and sat down. You then see a rather strange sight of several Westerners in bikinis with scrubbing brushes around these amazing creatures. I washed Lucky with my parents and the whole experience was just spectacular!\n\nAnd that was it! We headed back to Phnom Penh, spent an afternoon on the silk island, went to Raffles, did some last minute shopping and stocked up for the Christmas Markets I’ve since done for SKOPE (blog coming soon) and we were off back to England where my parents returned home after seven weeks of holiday and I came back after ten months to celebrate Christmas in the cold once more.\n\nAnother public holiday in Cambodia means another long weekend! This time I headed to Vietnam with my flatmate and very good friend Rachel. I’d only been to the neighbouring country once before and Rach had never been. Just beyond the Cambodian border is a large island, Phu Quoc, which used to belong to Cambodia but is now Vietnamese. We decided this tropical paradise would be an ideal destination for our romantic getaway!\n\nWe had arranged everything through a travel agent as the last unplanned border crossing didn’t exactly go to plan (see An Idea for an Adventure, Backfiring). Turning up at the “bus station”, we sat on a kerb for a while before some fellow travellers turned up and together we wondered about whether we were ever going to leave Cambodia. The couple, a French woman and Indian man, lived in Phnom Penh too and had holidayed on Phu Quoc twice before. The woman was particularly talkative and assured us that it would be a wonderful holiday if the weather was “shiny”. A tuk tuk turned up and promptly drove us all to a completely different part of the city. There we boarded a bus and trundled off through appalling holiday traffic towards Vietnam.\n\nThree hours later and the bus stopped so we and our new friends could get off. We piled into a mini van and drove to the border. I got chatting to the driver in Khmer who was then under the illusion that I spoke a lot more of the language than I actually do but we managed to communicate pretty well. The border crossing involved lots of waiting but was very simple overall. The driver took our passports (always a worrying moment) and disappeared (more worrying). When he returned he drove us over the border and we waited a little longer in Vietnamese customs. Finally we were back in the van and on our way. Ten minutes later we were in Ha Tien, the border town and port for the ferry to Phu Quoc.\n\nWe had to wait a couple of hours for the ferry but eventually we were on one of the noisiest boats ever! Finally disembarking on Phu Quoc, we were offered a ride with various other travellers to our guest house. Rachel had booked our accommodation and we had a lovely private room with ensuite and our own balcony! That evening we walked down to the beach to watch the sun set. The monsoon season had started so the clouds prevented us having much of a view but it was great to sit on the sand and enjoy not being at work and the cool sea breeze. We then had that well known Vietnamese dish: hamburgers.\n\nOur first full day was “shiny”! As we didn’t know what to expect the rest of the holiday, we decided to make the most of the weather and head down to what is considered the most beautiful beach in Vietnam. A woman ran a moto renting business out of the guest house but after we admitted neither of us had ever driven a moto before, she told us it would be stupid for us to drive ourselves and we’d probably die if we tried. So as we were discovering the best chocolate pancakes in the world, she offered to drive us herself. The trip took close to an hour and the very bump, muddy track at the end was not fun! Both Rachel and I hobbled away as we said goodbye to our chauffeur, after agreeing a collection time later in the afternoon.\n\nThe beach was totally worth the journey. To be honest, I don’t think words are needed so just imagine sunbathing on this sand, eating fresh watermelon and swimming in this sea.\n\nThe journey back was was hilarious (for me) as Rachel’s bikini had dampened her shorts and she kept sliding inappropriately close to our driver. That evening we watched the sunset before walking to the local night market, known for fresh seafood and pearls. The whole island is synonymous with the pearl trade and there are endless shops selling the precious stones (are they even stones?). The rain made the night market a little less fun but it was very interesting to see all the stalls. Dinner was a wonderful seafood restaurant we’d been recommended by the hamburger guy from the night before. Much more Vietnamese!\n\nThe next day we woke to cloudy skies. Pleased with our decision to enjoy the “shine” the day before, we headed into town to look around some pagodas. At the first one we were handed a bag of vine covered food parcels by a friendly monk. I’m always up for eating new things but Rachel is one of the fussiest eaters known to mankind! With our new bald friend hovering a few feet away, I eagerly unwrapped the mysterious bundles and took a bite. It was sticky rice with nuts and coconut … I think. Unsurprisingly, Rach was not a fan! We smiled at the monk and then carried the food around for the rest of the day, presuming it would bring bad luck or something to throw it away.\n\nThe second temple was interesting too (no free food). I particularly enjoyed watching the harbour opposite – a real taste of local lifestyles.\n\nThe last temple was beautiful. Built into a craggy outcrop, it overlooked the stormy sea and was topped with a lighthouse. There were even dying kittens waiting to greet you at the top of the steps! And if you left your friend alone, they were approached by a smelly old man who offered them cigarettes (sorry Rachel).\n\nAfter we sat and watched the waves crashing into the rocks for a while, we walked towards the local market street. We crossed the main river on the island and got another glimpse of local life!\n\nThe market itself was not exactly what I had anticipated. There were no touristy things at all and unless you wanted a vegetables or live chicken, duck, frog, or fish, there really wasn’t much to buy.\n\nPicking our way back through the filthy streets, we headed into town once more. On our way to the guest house, we got caught in a mega monsoon and were very glad we’d bought ponchos the night before!\n\nThe rain persisted all day but thanks to good conversation and speedy wifi, we weren’t bored. We visited the night market again that night and Rachel went on a pearl shopping spree! The jewellery varied a lot but much of it was catered to Asian taste (most tourists on the island were Chinese or Vietnamese) and therefore a bit too glittery for our liking. But some of the simpler designs were gorgeous and we successfully bargained an excellent deal for Rachel’s new treasures.\n\nOur journey home was long. Very very long. We booked all the way through again but this time it just didn’t work as well. We got picked up from our guest house at 9am and arrived with enough time to catch an earlier ferry. The crossing was rough and I was constantly calculating how long it would take me to swim to shore. Once we arrived, my initial worries about finding our next transport link were abated when I disembarked to see a little Vietnamese man holding a soggy sign with the word “LEMON” written on it.\n\nWe were joined in our mini van to Cambodia by the French and Indian couple from our journey down. The border involved more waiting. First at a cafe where we handed over our passports once more, then at the border itself when we had to wait for a few people to get Cambodian visas. Once in the bus, we started to drive in the complete opposite direction to Phnom Penh. We ended up at Kep, a seaside town where we dropped some people off and picked more up. Then we drove to Kampot, my favourite place in Cambodia. More waiting. I even had a meal. Then a load of minivans turned up. Yay! But there wasn’t one going to Phnom Penh. Anticlimactic. By this time it was 3pm. We eventually got a minivan at about 4pm but there wasn’t enough room for our luggage in the back. Their solution to this was to rotate the front row of seats 180 degrees and use the newly created space between the driver’s seat and the passengers to store the bags. Rach and I ended up being the ones going backwards.\n\nOur long journey was placated somewhat by a stunning sunset as we arrived in Phnom Penh. It was truly beautiful. Thanks Rach for the photo as I didn’t have the energy to get my own camera out!\n\nI had a great time in Vietnam overall and I really enjoyed spending time with Rachel. But, for me, the country just doesn’t compare to Cambodia. The people are less friendly, the food was not as good, and the general atmosphere of the place was less inviting. I was certainly glad to be home when we finally rocked up in Phnom Penh ten and a half hours after we had left Phu Quoc that morning.\n\nFirstly, I must apologise for yet another “I had an awesome holiday in beautiful Cambodian sunshine” blog entry. I promise that my next blog will be less envy-making… probably.\n\nCambodia had more public holidays this week. Three of them in fact, to celebrate King Norodom Sihamoni’s 62nd birthday. Happy birthday Your Majesty! Thanks for the five day weekend. My darling flatmate Hallie and I headed up north to Battambang, Cambodia’s second largest city and a place both of us had yet to visit.\n\nBattambang is situated close to the Tonle Sap lake, and is home to about 250,000 people. The journey up on Wednesday was … very Khmer. We were initially relieved that the bus was not equipped with a television and we would therefore not have to suffer seven hours of incessant Khmer karaoke. We took our seats and the bus steadily filled up. Then it was full. Then small, plastic stools were placed down the entire isle and more people piled on, each perching on a tiny stool. They stayed like this for seven hours! I didn’t take a picture sadly as it seemed too touristy but turning around and seeing all these glum, uncomfortable face at about arm rest level down the length of the bus was hilarious!\n\nHallie and I were staying in a lovely family-run guest house in the city centre. I say city, it’s tiny! Our room was fine, although rather hot, and the ensuite shower had such poor water pressure that we were provided with a bucket and scoop to help wash shampoo and conditioner out. It was actually a lot of fun! That evening we chatted to some of the other guests, several of whom were working in Phnom Penh too. Battambang is not on the basic tourist route so many of the people we met were expats and it was great to meet other people who love Cambodia. The first night we wandered around the streets to get our bearings and enjoyed some traditional Khmer food whilst watching the laid back evening life of the town unfold below us. We visited their quaint night market and bought some popcorn for dessert – this became an evening tradition!\n\nI arranged to meet Jason, a friend I met on the Kampot trip (click here for the relevant blog), on Thursday morning for breakfast. Jason was born in Battambang but lives in LA and was coincidentally visiting his sister who still lives in Battambang. When we met him for breakfast we quizzed him about the best things to do in his hometown and he offered to drive us around for the day! It was very generous of him and fantastic to have a local guide too! We headed to Phnom Sompov, a hill with caves and a beautiful temple on it. The hike up was pretty steep and the weather now is reaching the climax of the hot season. It was rather sweaty but we laughed and joked the whole way, and the views were breathtaking.\n\nThe first cave we visited, “the flower cave” was fun, the second cave was less so. The second cave is known as the “killing cave”, due to its purpose during the Khmer Rouge rule. 10,000 people were thrown through a shaft into the cave during the 3 years, 8 month rule and left to die. There are various piles of bones left in the cave. These and more grizzly facts were relayed to us by a jovial young Khmer boy, no older than 12. The fact that he was reeling off these statements about such brutality with such a practiced, almost nonchalant air made me very uncomfortable. I am all for educating the Khmer population about the country’s history but this kid clearly didn’t fully understand what he was showing tourists on a daily basis. It felt wrong.\n\nThe temple at the top offered stunning views over the Battambang countryside. The place is overrun with macaques which are equally cute and scary. And hilarious it turns out. I was leaning on the wall, looking out over the landscape when a monkey jumped up onto a lower wall with a can of fizzy drink. He then proceeded to bite into it and drink the contents. One of the funniest things Hallie and I have ever seen. The temple itself was beautiful too.\n\nWe hurried back down as it looked like an early monsoon was threatening to soak us. On the way back to the city, we stopped at Jason’s family’s mango farm where we picked several delicious mangos each and I got bitten by numerous red ants trying to get a shot of me on this ladder – appreciate the picture!!!\n\nBack in Battambang we ate a very late lunch, before showering and enjoyed some beers with our new hostel friends (who live in Phnom Penh) and Jason. The following day Jason was heading to Thailand with his family so we said a sad goodbye to our wonderful guide, with the promise to meet up next weekend in Phnom Penh to say a proper farewell before he heads back to LA. Thank you so much for that day Jason, it was amazing and I loved getting to know you better!\n\nThe following day we hired a tuk tuk, complete with a lovely, English-speaking driver called Ya Ya, and headed to the other touristy sites. Banan temple is at the top of 358 steps. That’s a lot of steps. Hallie and I were very, very, very sweaty by the top and basically sat in the shade of the crumbling temple towers trying to cool off before heading back down. The temple itself was cool and I liked the various inscriptions on cactus leaves left by previous visitors.\n\nWe next went to the legendary bamboo train, via Cambodia’s answer to the Golden Gate Bridge …\n\nThe bamboo train is a small length of track (7km) remaining from the huge network laid by the French colonists. Most of the rest of it was blown up by the Khmer Rouge, Viet Cong, or US Army. Basically you get a bamboo platform, slotted onto two wheel axels, a diesel engine, and a driver. Before the diesel engine, the trains were propelled by a bamboo rod, like a punt, which is where the track got the name. It’s a single track so when you meet another “train” the smaller of the two loads has to dismantle their ride to let the others pass. As it was just Hallie and I, we had to get off a lot! The journey itself is so much fun! It’s very noisy and quite fast, and every now and then you hit a piece of track that is barely connected to the next rail. But we didn’t die. We did however get rather sunburnt as we’d forgotten to put cream on and the entire ride is exposed. We bought Krammars (traditional Khmer scarves) at the far end from one of the small stalls and wrapped ourselves up on the way back! For a short video of our journey, click here!\n\nOnce back with Ya Ya, he gave us a brief history of the bamboo train and his family in relation to Battambang and the Khmer Rouge. Here, unlike the boy at the killing cave, I felt like Ya Ya actually knew what he was talking about and understood the historical events he was describing. His family history, like so many here, was full of death, separation and loss, and you could see his pain even though he had not been alive at the time.\n\nWe had lunch in a small, super cheap Khmer cafe in town and then headed north to Ek Phnom, another old temple. This one wasn’t up many steps so we were happy. It was a pretty but dilapidated ruin and I was actually more taken with the beautiful pagoda next door, especially as there were perfectly placed bicycles everywhere … I got a little, snap happy, sorry!\n\nThat afternoon we explored some of Battambang’s beautiful colonial streets and scoped out dinner places. The one we ended up going to, Lotus, was amazing and we returned for lunch there the following day.\n\nBattambang is a lovely place and I had so much fun exploring the town and beautiful surrounding countryside. I understand that it is a little out of the way and therefore not many tourists visit but I would highly recommend it to anyone. The only problem was the heat in our hotel room. We were on the third floor and it was just so hot! The final night Hallie actually took a shower in the middle of the night and used two buckets of water in an attempt to cool herself down! My only recommendation for fellow travellers would be to get a room with AC in the hot season. Other than that, explore and fall in love with rural Cambodia at its best.\n\nThere are many fun day trips to be explored from Phnom Penh and yesterday I was treated to one of my favourites. My flatmate and colleague, Johannah, has been in Cambodia for 14 weeks but sadly she is heading back to the US in just a couple of days. Therefore our boss, Kosal, offered to take her to Silk Island for the day, as a way of saying thank you and goodbye. I was invited too and am never one to turn down a free day out!\n\nSilk Island, or Koh Dach in Khmer, is situated just a few miles north of the city and is reached by a short boat ride across the Mekong river. The boat ride itself is one of my favourite parts of the day, especially as we climbed up to the top and watched life on the river banks either side as we crossed. Luckily for me, the copious amounts of free beer I had consumed the night before had not left me worse for wear!\n\nLike most Khmer events, the day centred on food so once on the island we drove straight towards the rather unique restaurant set-up at the northern tip of Koh Dach. But not before we stopped to see Kosal’s cows. Yep, my headteacher owns cattle. He purchased some cows, an expensive commodity here, and they are being raised by a poor family on the island. When they are ready to be sold, the profits will be split 50/50. Jo made some new friends … I don’t like cows.\n\nWe then drove on through beautiful, green countryside. One of the things I most like about Koh Dach is the simplicity and purity of the lifestyle. The houses are predominantly the same: raised on stilts with looms and farmyard animals underneath. That’s where Silk Island gets its name. Most of the families there support themselves by making silk products. The work is painstakingly slow and methodical, but the results are beautiful. Sadly I can’t afford to spend $40 on a scarf, but I can marvel at the skilled process.\n\nWhen we arrived at the “restaurant”, Jo was so excited. I’d forgotten to mention what the set up was. In fact, I don’t think it’s really explainable so here’s a picture:\n\nYou wade through the shallows of the river and sit on mats on these cute little huts. From there, you order food (I’ve only ever had one type of meal there: an entire roast chicken, rice, and some green vegetable with offal). As you wait, women come over offering different fruits and desserts, laughing at the fact that I politely refuse Khmer, before walking slowly off to the next group. It’s a wonderfully relaxing and chilled lunch set-up. We particularly enjoyed watching the various children of the sellers who were playing in the waters around us.\n\nOn the way back I requested a stop at one of my favourite pagodas in Cambodia. It’s derelict, abandoned since the back of it began to slide into the river and the roof caved in. But it’s weirdly well maintained, probably for tourism purposes although I’ve never seen another person there. The Buddha statues are draped in bright orange cloth and a pile of incense sticks are waiting to be lit at the foot of the shrine. It’s a haunting, etherial, strikingly beautiful building. The remaining ceiling is painted with religious characters and the cracked floor tiles give a sense of how grand the building must have been when it was a working religious site. Piled up in the back are old, wooden stretchers, used to carry the deceased: a little bit creepy. This was my third visit to the pagoda and it just gets more stunning every time. I was particularly happy to see a small pony tied up nearby so whilst Jo looked around I went to say hello. Although she was a little spooked at first and looked like she was about to try and bite me, patience, slow movements, and soothing tone allowed me to get close enough to touch her nose. Once I began gently scratching her head, she realised that being petted by humans wasn’t so bad and seemed perfectly content to allow me to stroke her for a good five minutes or so. I hadn’t touched a horse for over four months before yesterday and it made me realise how much I miss my horse, Melly.\n\nWe then drove back to the city, tired and contently stuffed with chicken. Koh Dach remains pleasantly untouristy (we didn’t see a single other “barang” whilst there) and I would recommend this trip to anyone visiting or living in Phnom Penh. The only problem is that the ferry is very poorly signposted: there is just one small arrow, with ferryboat written in Khmer, off National Highway 6. But with a good tuk tuk driver it’s definitely a trip worth making. I’m so glad that Kosal suggested visiting with Jo as it was the perfect way to celebrate her time in this country and say goodbye. Thanks to both of them for making this such a wonderful day.\n\nWatch this space for my next blog post, which will be an actual goodbye post for Jo."
