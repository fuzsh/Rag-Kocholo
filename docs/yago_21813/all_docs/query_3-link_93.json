        "text": "Cambodia led by Norodom Sihanouk is a custom civilization by Senshi, with contributions from DuskJockey, Uighur_Caesar, GPuzzle, DarthKyofu, and RawSasquatch.\n\nThis mod requires Brave New World.\n\nOverview[]\n\nCambodia[]\n\nMost Cambodians are descendants of the Khmers, who in the 6th century established the Indian-influenced Angkor Empire, and for the next 900 years ruled the area of present-day Cambodia. According to legend, the founder of the Khmer dynasty was Kampu Svayambhuva, from whose name \"Kampuchea\" derives. From the 10th to the 14th century, after years of military expansion, the Khmers reached their apogee. Their empire extended over most of Southeast Asia (from central Vietnam south-west into the Malay Peninsula, and from Thailand north to the border of Burma, now known as Myanmar). Angkor, the capital city, was a flourishing complex of great temples, palaces, and shrines. In the subsequent centuries, however, continuing attacks by the Thai (who captured Angkor in 1431) and the Vietnamese weakened the empire, and by the end of the 18th century much of Cambodia had become a Thai and Vietnamese condominium. In 1863, the king of Cambodia placed the country under French protection. The French, joining Cambodia to Laos and Vietnam to form French Indochina, ruled the protectorate until the end of World War II. Cambodian nationalism received its greatest impetus during the World War II period, while Japan controlled Indochina. King Norodom Sihanouk, who had ascended the throne in 1941 and had been held a virtual prisoner under the Japanese occupation, proclaimed Cambodia independent in 1945, but yielded before a temporary resumption of the French protectorate, enforced by Allied troops, which occupied Phnom Penh. Cambodia became a constitutional monarchy on 6 May 1947, and was granted nominal independence within the French Union on 9 November 1949. King Sihanouk, meanwhile, had assumed leadership of Cambodia's growing nationalist movement. On 17 October 1953, during the height of the Franco-Indochinese war, he was granted full military control of his country by France. Sihanouk, a skilled politician, abdicated in March 1955 in favor of his father and mother, King Suramarit and Queen Kossamak, and then emerged as prime minister with the unanimous support of the national legislature. King Suramarit died on 31 April 1960, but Prince Sihanouk, although retaining the title of chief of state, did not return to the throne. During the Franco-Indochinese war, Communist-controlled Viet-Minh troops from Vietnam operated in Cambodia (1954), and gave support to a small Khmer Communist movement.\n\nNorodom Sihanouk[]\n\nNorodom Sihanouk has been an important figure in Cambodia through six decades of war and political instability. He first became the king of Cambodia in 1941, when his country was a colony of France. After participating in the movement to gain Cambodia's independence from French rule, he stepped down from the throne to become president in 1955. Over the next fifteen years, Sihanouk struggled to maintain his country's neutrality as war raged in neighboring Vietnam. During this time, a group of Communist revolutionaries known as the Khmer Rouge emerged to oppose his rule.\n\nIn 1970 Sihanouk was removed from power by his prime minister, Lon Nol. He then went into exile in China and joined forces with his former enemies, the Khmer Rouge. He became the symbolic head of state when the brutal Khmer Rouge took control of Cambodia in 1975, but returned to exile when Cambodia was conquered by Vietnam four years later. In 1993 the still-popular Sihanouk returned to the Cambodian government following United Nations-sponsored elections.\n\nDawn of Man[]\n\n\"Father Prince, great Norodom Sihanouk, the people of Cambodia rise to greet you! Cambodia is a land of lushness and beauty, and a home to the Khmer people and their vast heritage stretching back over a thousand years. But it was you, o Sihanouk, who would lead your kingdom from foreign dominance into the modern age! From the shackles of colonialism, you brought modernisation, constitutionalism, and equality into your fledgling state - for a time. Cambodia's path in the modern world has not been an easy one, caught in the midst of global ideological struggle. There have been times where your governance was overthrown, and the cruel and opportunistic took hold of your country. But these days are over - the Kingdom of Cambodia has weathered the darkest of times and stands tall in the present day!\n\nOh Sihanouk, the people of Cambodia cry out your name - they long for their Father Prince once more! Will your steady hand guide Cambodia through the future? Will you build a civilization to stand the test of time?\"\n\nIntroduction: \"It's a pleasure to meet you! I am Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's Father Prince! Perhaps you have heard of me, or my work?\"\n\nIntroduction: \"Greetings, welcome to Cambodia! My name is Sihanouk, at various times I have been the King, the Prince, the President, the Prime Minister, and the Head of State of this land. Which am I at the moment? I don't remember.\"\n\nDefeat: \"Well, that's it then.
