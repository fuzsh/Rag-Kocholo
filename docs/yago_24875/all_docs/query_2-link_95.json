        "text": "The Swedish royals got in the party spirit this weekend when a family friend tied the knot. And one royal in particular had a starring role in the nuptials.\n\nPrincess Madeleine of Sweden was a bridesmaid for her close friend Louise Gottlieb who married partner Gustav Thott at a church in Södermanland on Saturday.\n\nMadeleine, who is seventh in line to the Swedish throne, wore a pale blue floor-length gown with a ruffled neckline by Swedish-Lenanese designer Fadi el Khoury, notes blogger The Royals and I. She paired the design with metallic sandals, said to be from Marchesa, and a pair of statement earrings. The bride looked stunning in an embellished white gown with a full skirt, cap sleeves and high-neckline.\n\nMadeleine and the bride have been friends since school, reports The Daily Mail. The bride's parents Frederik and Carola Gottlieb are also said to be close King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, so Madeleine wasn't the only royal in attendance. Along with her parents, the King and Queen, she was joined by Crown Princess Victoria, who wore a belted dusky pink gown, and her sister-in-law Princess Sofia, who chose a striking one-shoulder design for the occasion.\n\nCrown Princess Victoria and Princess Sofia\n\nThe bridesmaid duties come just three months after Princess Madeleine welcomed her third child with husband Chris O'Neill. The Swedish royal court confirmed that Princess Adrienne was born on 9 March at Danderyd Hospital near Stockholm. Shortly after her daughter's arrival, the proud mum shared adorable photos of the newest member of the family."
