Residents are proud of its reputation as \"America's Icebox.\" The ski resort boasts a 1,792 foot summit elevation, as well as a 7,000 person uphill capacity. The 35 trails that soar off the rocky crest offer some of the best cruising runs around the Great Lakes. Giants Ridge has an intermediate and beginner terrain park as well as a Children's sledding area and sliding hill. The Giant was first developed as an Olympic training site with World Class cross country trails, and the trails are still maintained to Olympic quality standards.\n\nPlan Your Trip"
