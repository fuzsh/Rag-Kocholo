Hersheypark® remains open during inclement weather conditions and offers a variety of indoor activities including entertainment shows, dining options, shopping, game arcades, exhibits at ZooAmerica®, as well as rides under cover while you wait for the weather to clear.\n\nHersheypark makes every effort to reopen the rides and attractions as quickly and safely as possible after the inclement weather conditions cease. In the event the inclement weather conditions cause the majority of major rides and attractions to close for a continuous 60 minutes on a public operating day, a Return Visit Voucher may be issued for a return visit for the current operating season. Please present your ticket stub or receipt of purchase to any Guest Services location or Hospitality Services to receive your Return Visit Voucher (note, not valid for private events).\n\nDownload and check the Hersheypark Mobile App for an up-to-date listing of closed rides and ride wait times.\n\nRead Full Answer Hide Answer\n\nanswer icon\n\nHersheypark® is cashless and accepts all major credit cards, debit cards and Hersheypark gift cards, as well as Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay.
