You can't go wrong with Oscar Wilde; he's the master of short fiction for a reason. :)\n\nA review by my GR friend Federico prompted me to go down memory lane. He called this work 'Pure Perfection', and I heartily agree.\n\nI had first come across this story when I was in school. It was one of the \"chapters\" in my English textbook, maybe in grade 3 or 4. I never knew then who Oscar Wilde was, but I remember the sheer impact this little story had on me. Haven't forgotten it since, and have read it multiple times over. It is right up there, along with 'The Nightingale And The Rose' as my favourite Wilde work.\n\nPick it up when you want something beautifully serene. Wilde wrote this story for children, but its impact transcends the target age group. Do read.\n\n5 selfless stars.\n\nThis story is in the public domain, so you can read it from any online site for free. Here's one link:\n\nhttps://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-st...\n\n———————————————\n\nConnect with me through:\n\nMy Blog | The StoryGraph | Instagram | Facebook | Twitter\n\nOctober 19, 2016\n\nI have read enough of Oscar Wilde to have come to believe he was not a religious man, but this short story, this fable, makes me think otherwise. It has a powerful message and at the end there is a distinct reference to Jesus Christ and Heaven.\n\nJune 26, 2018\n\nDon't you tell me that you have not read this one!\n\nThe sign that got trapped in the labyrinth of my 3rd grade mind reading his English Gulmohar was this :\n\nGot burnt into my memory. And that is how I dug this books out of my pensive to add it here on Goodreads - by searching for this sign.\n\nOscar Wilde knows how to tickle the juvenile readers.\n\nWalls are made to keep dangers out. But if those bricks and mortars start eroding the warmth inside, they should be done away with. The giant constructs a wall, proper with a flashing sign, warning any crossing over onto his garden would be \"taken care off\".\n\nThere's this one line that serves as the evidence for the competence of Oscar Wilde passing off pristine literature to children with deftness.\n\n\"Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter.\"\n\nVerdict : Paragon of childhood memories.\n\nOctober 27, 2017\n\nThe Selfish Giant is a beautiful story Oscar Wilde wrote for children but the child in any grown person is apt to embrace it even more dearly.\n\nThe selfish giant would not let the children play in his beautiful garden. “My garden is my own garden,” he roared and the children fled. As a consequence, a big change fell upon his garden and it was no longer beautiful. Then an encounter with one special child hidden in a far corner of the garden - diminutive, dependent, defeated - afforded the giant an opportunity to redeem himself.\n\nThe story evoked the gentle glow one finds in a fairy tale in which goodness and grace prevail. It can be read simply as an enchanting story. It can also be read as an allegorical story about love, redemption and restoration.\n\nAt the end of the story, a hush descended on the giant’s garden. I tarried there and felt a sense of awe akin to being on hallowed ground. What a wondrous story!\n\nJune 16, 2023\n\n“My own garden is my own garden,” said the Giant; “any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.”\n\nThe Selfish Giant is a grumpy, uncooperative being who cherishes his peace and will not tolerate disruptions; when a group of children discover the garden to his castle and begin their plays in this new place, the Giant quickly puts an end to this interference to his blissful existence.\n\nOscar Wilde's short story paints a picturesque, fairy-tale-like image by using imaginative descriptions, allowing childlike imaginations to envision the beauty and excitement of an isolated garden full of magical secrets to uncover (sort of like the world of Frances Hodgson Burnett's secret garden if it belonged to Ebenezer Scrooge).\n\nSource (Pinterest)\n\nWith his child-like prose, Wilde's story quickly distinguishes itself from his more prominent full-length novels that often dealt with the moral abysses of humanity, instead opting for a much more hopeful portrayal of positivity in a morality tale written for children about the magnitude of vanity and self-centeredness of humans (represented by the central character being a giant, of course).\n\nWhat might come as the biggest surprise of The Selfish Giant is the ending, however. I do not want to spoil anything here, but if the almost childish writing made you doubt whether it was indeed an Oscar Wilde story you were reading, the final conclusion is what undoubtedly gives this story its memorable touch and ensures that it will continue to linger in the minds of its readers.\n\nThen the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter.\n\nAugust 18, 2018\n\nI loved this classic fairy tale when I was a child and I have had great pleasure in reading this story to my children and grandchildren. Published in 1888 by Oscar Wilde. A timeless classic children's story. Pure nostalgia.\n\nMay 18, 2020\n\nI honestly don't mind religious imagery in my fairytales. But hit me over the head with it, why don't you? It was a bit too in your face in this one.\n\nI liked the messages of kindness and selfishness and how the former quality is one you want, and the latter not so much. It was straightforward and simple. I also like how it used playing in the garden as an example because that's what children do and hopefully it will help them learn to play nicely with each other. Sharing is an important quality for a child to learn!\n\nHowever, the Christian imagery at the end was a bit too much. And it felt very rushed and suddenly tacked on at the end. I don't mind a connection being made between acting nicely and getting to heaven, but it just didn't feel... ingrained into the story.\n\nOctober 15, 2007\n\nIt's good that this title appears at the top of my list--\"The Selfish Giant\" has long been one of my favorite stories. I remember listening to my mother read it as we sat on our front porch on a lazy California afternoon. Just as she did, I also cry when I read this touching story to my children.\n\nThere are few books outside the canon of scripture that I would count as spiritually powerful and fully illustrative of the love of God as this short story. Take the time today to read it to your children.\n\nSeptember 8, 2021\n\nThe Selfish Giant is a moral tale about selfishness and generosity.\n\n“How selfish I have been!” he said; “now I know why the Spring would not come here. I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children’s playground for ever and ever.” He was really very sorry for what he had done.\n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nThe Selfish Giant takes me about as deep into my early childhood as I can remember. In those preschool and pre-literate days (and in our house pre TV) my mother would put on children’s story records to amuse me and keep me out of the way. I keenly remember the large, antique traveler’s trunk that housed both our record player and collection of records. I would sit beside it, taking in story after story as the records dropped.\n\nThe Selfish Giant was one of my favorites. I remember being frightened as the big, selfish giant chased the children out of his garden, and sad and outraged when he walled his garden to keep them out forever. When winter came to the garden permanently because the children had been banished, I think I first experienced the sensation of eerie uncanniness — it got me anew each time I listened. I grew excited when the children returned through a hole in the wall, bringing spring back with them, and thrilled to the giant’s turn of heart as he went to help the small boy who couldn’t reach the tree, then welcomed all the children, throwing open his garden for their play. That is where the story ended on my record.\n\nI mostly forgot about this tale as an adult until coming across it at my local library in a children’s picture book. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that none other than Oscar Wilde had written this favorite story of my earliest childhood. I also discovered that there was more story there, taking the Giant out to the end of his days and putting a bit of a Christian twist on it. (I suppose this had been left off the record because adults were uncomfortable introducing death to tiny children.) It is such a lovely story — Wilde wrote it with such a gentle touch. I was thrilled to rediscover it and to find that I had been appreciating the genius of Oscar Wilde from my earliest memories.\n\nDecember 23, 2010\n\nI own many books by Oscar Wilde, including a book of stories that contains a version of this story, but I haven’t read that book since my childhood years.\n\nSo, because of the Jesus allusions, it ended up being not my cup of tea at all. I assume that as I child I didn’t get the Christian/Jesus connection and I probably was able to enjoy it more because of that.\n\nBut, up until the end I appreciated and enjoyed the story and the illustrations that are in this edition.\n\nIt’s a lovely fairy tale and if the ending had been just slightly tweaked I would have liked it much better. But, my beliefs are, as usual, in the minority, and I assume most others’ feelings wouldn’t match mine. But parents who know nothing of this tale should know that death is a part of this story.\n\nI did like the illustrations and I did love the message about sharing and reaping the benefits of doing that, and of giving to and being caring about others.\n\nNovember 17, 2018\n\nΑπογευματινή ανάγνωση για χατίρι της κόρης!!!\n\n(Η έκδοση που έλαβε από τη δανειστική βιβλιοθήκη του σχολείου της δεν είναι η συγκεκριμένη, αλλά μια εικονογραφημένη περίπου 40 σελίδων).\n\nΣε κάθε περίπτωση, είναι ένα πολύ ενδιαφέρον ανάγνωσμα για μικρά παιδιά, με το ηθικό δίδαγμά του να έχει να κάνει προφανώς με τον εγωισμό. Για το μόνο που έχω μερικές ενστάσεις είναι το τέλος του. (Δεν μπορώ να τις αναφέρω εδώ για προφανούς λόγους- spoiler). Απλά δεν ξέρω αν είναι για 5 χρόνων παιδάκια, όπως αναγράφει στο εξώφυλλο. Για λίγο πιο μεγάλα παιδιά θεωρώ ότι είναι μια χαρά...\n\nJune 15, 2023\n\nIt's a delightful story, both bittersweet and delicious in the way The Chronicles of Narnia is.\n\nCome on -- let your playful inner child out for this one! It's sweet and wonderfully written and teaches an important lesson.\n\nMay 28, 2016\n\nWonderful!! I have recently discovered these fairytales by Oscar Wilde. This is the second one I have listened to via the audible app using their new feature, channels. I am delighted! Surprise ending that I in no way would have predicted. I'd love to see the illustrations in the book now. When I next get out to the book store I will look for it. Highly recommended.\n\nJuly 19, 2022\n\nTRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED\n\nThere are 12 peach trees in the Giant's garden, and after he walls it up to keep out the annoying children, the Snow and Frost take over and do not let go. They invite the North Wind and Hail to take up residence, and Spring never came.\n\nBut trespassers might be forgiven, if their coming is heralded by birdsong and peach blossoms. But who is that special boy who befriends the Giant, but then mysteriously disappears? The other children did not know the boy—they had never seen him before.\n\nOscar Wilde's education was steeped in Christianity, and that foundation is evident in this story, although the allegory is thinly veiled—and transparent by the end. This story is a marvellous approach to finding the key to Paradise, and despite its apparent simplicity, also appeals to adults.\n\nOctober 16, 2016\n\nThis is a visually beautiful book. The illustrations are detailed and will keep the attention of a child for a while as they look for all that is there. I knew nothing of the story and was pleasantly surprised to find a lovely Christian folk-like tale.\n\nAugust 18, 2011\n\nUtterly beautiful.\n\nOn the surface a traditional fairy tale, though Wilde wrote it as a religious parable, however as a five ar six year old it wasn't a subtext I was aware of.\n\nThe plot centres around a giant who puts a wall around his beautiful garden to stop children playing in it, and in doing so, stops Spring from entering as well as them. One day the children find a cranny though which to kreep back into the garden and duly Spring returns and the garden becomes a paradise once more. As the giant goes into his garden to see the transformation up close the children shy away from him with the exception of one boy, stranded at the bottom of a tree. The giat lifts him up into it, and the child kisses his cheek. At that moment the Giant's selfishness melts as the ice in his garden has done and he sets about knocking down the wall. Every day the children come to play and the proper order of the seasons returns, but the giant never sees he child he lifted into the tree. Until one day, as a very old giant, the child apears before him with wounds on his hands. Horrified the giant wants revenge for the hurt caused to the boy, but the boy says;\n\n\"Nay! but these are the wounds of Love....You let me play once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise.\"\n\nWhen the children return to the garden the next day the giant is found dead, under the tree with blossom on him.\n\nThis story is perfect for Foundation and Key Stage one children, and this edition in particular, as the illustrations are fantsatic. The fact that death features so obviously at the end might mean it needs be approached with a sense of caution, but the approach it takes is one of gentleness and love, so might also be a good tool to discuss issues of families and bereavement with smaller children.\n\nSeptember 7, 2011\n\nThe Selfish Giant was one of my favourite books as a child, and upon reading it again there were a lot of themes and symbols that as a child i was oblivious to. The story is about a Selfish Giant who owns a home with a beautiful garden. Upon returning to his home he discovers the local children playing in his garden, the sun shining and birds chirping. The Giant was enraged that the children had been playing in his garden, so he chased them all away and built a huge wall with a sign saying 'trespassers will be prosecuted'.\n\nMonths passed with the children having nowhere to play while the giant kept the garden to himself. As spring came, flowers blossomed everywhere except the giants garden. Hail came, snow came and frost came as the birds and flowers did not want to live in a garden where children were not allowed to play.\n\nAs you can imagine what happens next is inevitable yet it is still quite endearing. The giant hears a bird singing beautifully, and as he peered out of his window he discovered the children had crept in through a gap in the wall. Frost, snow and hail had all disappeared, however when the children saw the giant coming they ran away frightened. In the corner remained one little boy who did not see the giant coming towards him due to the tears in his eyes. The giant picked the little boy up and placed him on the tree and told his friends, ‘this is your garden now’. The Giant knocked down the wall and the children continued to play in his garden even after his death.\n\nThe elements that I did not pick up on when reading this book as a child were the religious aspects. It doesn’t change my view too much on the book as I still think as a child it was a really enjoyable story with a heart warming end.\n\nJuly 26, 2017\n\nCan't believe I have not read the original version of the short story before! I've just finished reading it and have thought it so beautiful I am now in tears!\n\nDecember 24, 2022\n\nThis was Another one I came across by accident, and what caught my attention was it was written by Oscar Wilde – I’ve read more of his plays so this was a completely new experience for me.\n\nThe Selfish Giant is a wonderful short read, when I finished reading this, I was glowing with warmth :)\n\nThe story is a gentle tale that understates its moral to beam out hope. Here the hope comes in second chances for a grouchy giant who learns a hard lesson of what happens when you don’t share what you have.\n\nA really nice read to wrap up the year.\n\nMarch 23, 2022\n\nA very cute and heartwarming story.\n\nNovember 12, 2022\n\n“He did not hate the Winter now, for he\n\nknew that it was merely the Spring asleep, and that the flowers were resting.”\n\nJune 17, 2023\n\n4.5\n\nA moving and poignant short story."
