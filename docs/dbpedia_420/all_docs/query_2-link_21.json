        "text": "This page is a collection of known Easter Eggs from The Giant Zombies map. It does not cover how to open or reach certain parts of the map. If you're unfamiliar with the map layout see The Giant page.\n\nSecret Perk\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe base five Perk-A-Cola Machines are easy enough to find, but there's actually a sixth Perk-A-Cola Machine that can be discovered through a few steps. This sixth machine will either be Deadshot Daiquiri or Stamin-Up. It switches from game to game.\n\nTo access the sixth Perk-A-Cola Machine, you must first link all three teleporters. Once those are enabled, you will need three Cymbal Monkeys from the Mystery Box. Next, you must throw a Cymbal Monkey on the teleport pad and use all three teleporters. Finally, interact with the console next to the mainframe by the Pack-A-Punch machine and press the red button. A laser will shoot from the Giant robot's head, melting snow in the central courtyard area (near the Animal Testing Labs) and exposing the sixth Perk-A-Cola Machine.\n\nBeauty of Annihilation Remix - Musical Easter Egg\n\nActivating the Musical Easter Egg is the same as the original Der Riese map. All you must do is interact (Square on PlayStation, X on Xbox) with three green jars around the map. These jars appear to have brains inside. Two jars are on shelves in the Animal Testing Lab. They will be near the GobbleGum machine. The third jar is in the second floor generators room above the hangar. More specifically, it's in the room with the frag grenades.\n\nRadios\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nA number of radios can be found throughout the Giant, each containing messages from the characters in the main zombies storyline. A few of the messages will change if playing as Richtofen.\n\nTo the left of the Pack-A-Punch Machine, and to the right of the writing on the wall.\n\nInside a filing cabinet to the right of the door leading to Teleporter A (Animal Testing Labs).\n\nUnderneath the left set of stairs leading up to Teleporter A.\n\nUnder the sand bags just before the bridge leading to the second floor generators.\n\nIn a barrel within the Teleporter B room.\n\nTo the left of the open furnace in the hangar / furnace room.\n\nTo the left of the entrance to Dr. Maxis' office (right of the Teleporter C entrance).\n\nOn the catwalks in front of the barrier from Teleporter C.\n\nHide and Go Seek\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe Hide and Go Seek Easter Egg returns for the Giant. Also known as the Fly Trap Easter Egg because of the achievement / trophy name from Call of Duty World at War.\n\nTo do this, you must first get an upgraded weapon from the Pack-A-Punch Machine.\n\nShoot this weapon on a console in the back of the map. It's located opposite of the animal testing labs entrance.\n\nIf you hit it, a number of items will glow green and fly into the air. You must now find these items around the map in any order and shoot them with any weapon.\n\nOne item is located within the right furnace under Teleporter A. This is near the Animal Testing Labs. The furnace will not be lit.\n\nOne item is located on the fire escape of a building outside the map. This building is left of the power switch.\n\nOne item is located within the left water cooling vat in the second floor generators room above the hangar. You will need to jump to see it properly.\n\nAfter shooting all three items, the Annihilator will be available in the furnace room within the hangar. This weapon is a special weapon and will not take up a normal weapon slot."
