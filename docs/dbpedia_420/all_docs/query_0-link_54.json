In both stories, a teenage character is stranded in the wilderness following a plane crash. In I Am the Ice Worm, 14-year-old Allison is rescued from the Alaskan wild by an Inupiat trapper, who takes her to his village to stay until she can be reunited with her mother. Allison’s upbringing in an upper-class family in southern California certainly didn’t prepare her for this icy adventure, but she turns out to have courage and adaptability that she didn’t expect. Though Allison may initially seem too “girly” for boy readers, this novel has a great blend of adventure, wilderness and family matters that will captivate boys and girls alike.\n\nPerfect for: Kids who like adventure stories.\n\nFind I Am the Ice Worm at your local library.\n\nHatchet\n\nby: Gary Paulsen - (Simon & Schuster, 1987) 192 pages.\n\nThe story is about Brian, 13, and how he manages to survive 54 days in the Canadian wilderness after a plane crash. Brian was flying to visit his father when the pilot dies of a heart attack in mid-flight. Brian crash lands the plane into a small lake and swims out of the wreckage. He has his clothing, a tattered windbreaker and a hatchet (a gift from his mother). The novel takes us through Brian’s days, how he learns patience through his experiences with failures and small successes: building a fire, fishing and hunting, making his shelter a safe one. He endures a porcupine attack, a tornado and being utterly alone for almost two months. This is a tale of adventure but, more importantly, it is a tale of character growth. This edition includes a new introduction and sidebar commentary by the author.\n\nPerfect for: Kids who like adventure stories.\n\nFind Hatchet at your local library.\n\nKit’s Wilderness\n\nby: David Almond - (Delacorte Press, 2000) 229 pages.\n\nKit’s family moves to Stoneygate, an old coal-mining town where his family has lived for generations, to be near his ailing grandfather.

Everest with his long-absent father. Though the choice might be easy, the journey is not. Peak is physically and emotionally challenged by the grueling climb, the weather, and the politics and drama of climbing culture. And the pressure is on, because if Peak can reach the summit before his 15th birthday, he’ll break a world record and gain glory and money. Peak is gripping and surprising, and though it’s written for a middle-grade audience, readers young and old will be sucked in by the sharp writing and memorable characters.\n\nPerfect for: Kids who like adventure stories.\n\nFind Peak at your local library.\n\nBaseball in April and Other Stories\n\nby: Gary Soto - (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1990) 111 pages.\n\nAlfonso is a seventh grader who wishes his teeth were straighter, his hair were cooler, and his abs were more muscular.
