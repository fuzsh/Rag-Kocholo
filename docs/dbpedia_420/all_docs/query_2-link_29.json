        "text": "Come marvel at this day-use (no camping available) park’s remarkable features. Located just outside of Great Falls and encompassing nearly 14 miles of Missouri River shoreline, Giant Springs State Park has something for everyone. The park provides opportunities for hiking, biking, picnicking, photography, fishing, hunting, boating, and bird watching.\n\nExperience the Giant Springs, which is one of the largest freshwater springs in the county, producing over 156 million gallons of water each day. Listen to the tranquil sounds of the water cascading into the Roe River, once listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s shortest river. Visit the Giant Springs Fish Hatchery and take a walk through the visitor center or feed the fish in the show pond. Find a place to picnic among the towering silver poplars, mature blue spruce or on the manicured lawn. Bring your binoculars or camera and enjoy the park’s exceptional birding opportunities.\n\nIf you are looking for something a little more active, Giant Springs provides excellent fishing opportunities along the Missouri River as well as a separate fishing pond. Take a walk, go for a run or ride your bike along the park’s 30+ miles of paved and dirt single-track trails, which range in difficulty from beginner to expert. The trails are all part of the larger River’s Edge Trail System, which consists of nearly 60 miles of trail around the Great Falls area. Take a walk or drive to the four Missouri River waterfalls (five, if you count the now buried Colter Falls) that are all located within the park. Giant Springs is rich with history that includes the Lewis and Clark Expedition, silver smelting and Paris Gibson, the founder of Great Falls.\n\nWhether you come to picnic, hike the trails, fish the Missouri, or simply admire the springs, Giant Springs State Park has exciting opportunities for the whole family!"
