San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance is working to bring you an updated version of the Giant Panda Fact Sheet with additional science and conservation information. Thanks for your patience, as we quietly leaf through the research literature.\n\nIn the meantime, this recent book chapter by Swaisgood et al. (2020) presents an outstanding summary of giant panda biology.\n\nPlease check back soon. SDZWA team members can email questions to library@sdzwa.org."
