        "text": "Inspired by the touching children’s story ‘The Selfish Giant’ by Oscar Wilde, Bristol’s two leading family theatre experts are combining forces to explore an unusual friendship, and how even the grumpiest giant’s heart can melt when Spring finally comes.\n\nGrinter is a giant. She lives happily alone in her huge cold house, surrounded by her huge snowy gardens, enclosed by her high, frost-covered walls. She shuts out the world, because long ago, the world shut her out, and so she hides, safe and quiet in her peaceful, icy home. Outside the towering walls of her enormous garden, the world has been changing and there is very little green left. One day, the children – tired of playing on hard roads and grey rooftops – find a chink in the giant’s wall and climb through, changing the course of the children’s and Grinter’s lives forever.\n\nPowerful storytelling, captivating puppetry, beautiful design, enchanting music and a sprinkling of magic sums up this very special show.\n\n★★★★ “A beautiful show that will appeal across generations” – The Spy in the Stalls\n\n★★★★ “50 minutes of theatrical magic” – Sheffield Bigstamp\n\n“The beauty of this play will remain for a long time to come” – Curious Mum\n\n“A story for our times” – Children’s Theatre Reviews\n\nTessa Bide Productions\n\n★★★★ “An engrossing show that is full of compassion and makes siblings of us all.” – The Guardian (on Perfect)\n\n“If I had to sum up Perfect in one word it would simply be that: perfect.” – On the Beat\n\n“Perfect is sophisticated and sensitive in its storytelling, exquisite in its design and, best of all, really trusts its young audience.” – Children’s Theatre Reviews\n\n★★★★ “The perfect example of a show where the adults are just as enthralled as the kids.” – A Younger Theatre (on The Tap Dancing Mermaid)\n\n★★★★ “If you drew up a checklist of all the things a good children’s show should contain, The Tap Dancing Mermaid would tick every box.” – The List\n\n“We applaud Bide for getting the balance just right… what an inspiring production this is, sparking curiosity and genuine wonder.” – Curious Mum (On ‘A Strange New Space’)\n\n“Tessa Bide understands children in a way that can’t be taught.” – Children’s Theatre Reviews\n\n“Bide absolutely smashes the fourth wall – this is just everything a children’s theatre experience should be.” – Childplays (on The Tap Dancing Mermaid)\n\nSoap Soup Theatre:\n\n“Spellbinding. This is not your average children’s play with bright colours and strident tones. It is lovely and gentle and even a bit haunting.” – Bristol Culture (on ‘The Snow Baby)\n\n“Tender and enchanting… featuring a host of loveable characters.” – The Reviews Hub (on The Snow Baby)\n\n“A very enjoyable and well-executed piece of theatre that charmed us all.” – Weston Super Mum (on The Owl & The Pussycat’s Treasury of Nonsense)\n\n“Using their wit and ingenuity, Soap Soup have forged a version that respects its origins whilst creating something innovative and exciting.” – Chris Pirie Artistic Director, Green Ginger (On ‘Little Red Riding Hood’)"
