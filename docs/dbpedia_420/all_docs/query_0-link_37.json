        "text": "Snow may cover up to 32% of the Earth's land surface and ice up to 11% (Allison et al. 2018). This review on algae that live in these habitats is an update since Hoham and Duval (2001) in the comprehensive reference on snow ecology (Jones et al. 2001), and we use the original taxonomic names used by authors in their papers even though changes have been made since then. Previous overviews in this area of phycology include those of Kol (1968), Hoham (1980), and Hoham and Ling (2000). Additional reports on cell structure and physiology (Remias 2012), adaptation strategies (Leya 2013), ecology, systematics, and life cycles (Komárek and Nedbalová 2007), glacial ice algae (Williamson et al. 2019), glacial ecosystems (Hodson et al. 2008), and cold alpine regions (Sattler et al. 2012) have further contributed to our understanding of these algae. Organisms regarded as true snow and glacial algae thrive in a liquid water film between melting snow and ice crystals, and usually do not propagate outside of this habitat. Otherwise, microalgae of different origins such as bare soils and from lichen fragments may be passively transported onto snow and ice surfaces by meltwater inflow or wind. Under certain conditions, they may even cause a snow discoloration, but are not regarded as true snow or glacial algae in the strict sense. Microbial communities that inhabit snow and glacial ice are not only abundant and taxonomically diverse and complex in terms of their interactions, but their role in global biogeochemical cycles has been underestimated (Maccario et al. 2015, Havig and Hamilton 2019, Williamson et al. 2019). Algal blooms typically occur from one to several weeks during spring and summer when air temperatures remain above 0°C in semi‐permanent snowfields and glaciers in temperate, mountainous, and polar regions (Hoham and Duval 2001). The most prominent snow algae belong to the Chlamydomonadales (Chlorophyta) and glacial algae to the Zygnematales (Streptophyta). Yet, other groups of algae may color snow including euglenoids, cryptomonads, chrysophytes, and dinoflagellates (Hoham and Duval 2001). When the concentration of cells reaches a population in several thousands of cells mL−1, a snow or ice discoloration takes place. The color and its intensity depend on the pigment composition and population density. When chlorophylls dominate, green snow appears (Chlamydomonadales; Figs. a and a). If primary carotenoids like fucoxanthin dominate, golden‐brown snow appears (Chrysophyceae; Figs. b and b). In many cases, the pigment composition can vary depending on the stage of the life cycle. Most prominent are secondary carotenoids like astaxanthin of certain chlamydomonadalean green algae, which dominate over chlorophylls to cause orange (Figs. c and c), pink (Figs. d and d), and red snow (Figs. e and e). Purple to brown phenols abundantly present in glacial streptophytic algae (Zygnematales) cause grey snow or purple ice (Figs. f and f); however, this color is frequently masked by dark cryoconite particles which are common at surfaces of old ice.\n\nMolecular phylogenies have enhanced our understanding of the evolutionary history of snow species in the Chlamydomonas–Chloromonas–Chlainomonas complex (Hoham et al. 2002, 2006, Novis et al. 2008, Muramoto et al. 2010, Remias et al. 2013b, 2016, 2018, Matsuzaki et al. 2014, 2015, 2018, 2019, Procházková et al. 2019a,b). Metagenomics (Hisakawa et al. 2015, Lutz et al. 2015a, Raymond 2016, Maccario et al. 2019), lipidomics (Řezanka et al. 2014), and HTS (Lutz et al. 2015a, 2018, 2019, Segawa et al. 2018) have significantly contributed new information. Samples from difficult inaccessible regions and satellite imaging of large ice sheets showing algal abundance or melting processes has widened our knowledge about biodiversity and occurrence (Takeuchi et al. 2006a, Hisakawa et al. 2015). In an Alaskan 1,900 km2 icefield, red snow extended over 700 km2 and microbial communities were responsible for 17% of the snow melt (Ganey et al. 2017). Their contribution to climate warming is likely to grow with increased melt and nutrient input. Laboratory studies have furthered our comprehension of difficult life cycles (Hoham et al. 2006), pH optima (Hoham et al. 2007), temperature optima (Hoham et al. 2008a), effects of coniferous leachates on growth (Hoham et al. 2008b), and interactions of light on growth and life cycle development (Hoham et al. 2000a,b, 2009). Snow and glacial algae are examples of how life can adapt to harsh environmental conditions in terms of solar irradiance, low temperatures or nutrients, and show that phototroph extremophiles perform well in putative extreme habitats such as melting snowpacks or glacial surfaces. As a result, these microbes have been considered as Earth analogs for life outside our planet (Havig and Hamilton 2019, Vimercati et al. 2019b).\n\nDiversity and community structure\n\nSnow algae have been found on every continent and are a global phenomenon. Their distributions are limited to suitable habitats depending on snow or permanent ice, ecological, and climatic conditions. Since 2000, they have been recorded from all continents and geographic regions (Table ) except Australia where they were reported previously from the Snowy Mountains (Marchant 1982). Communities of snow algae are diverse and taxonomically broad, comprised of clones with discrete patches, and are heterogeneous (Brown et al. 2016). Even though they color the snow red, green, orange, or golden‐brown, they still may be an important component of snow even in the absence of these colors (Brown and Jumpponen 2019). Green snow in the Laurentian Mountains, Quebec, was defined as having more than 4,000 cells · mL−1, whereas white snow had populations below that level (Hoham and Duval 2001).\n\nWhen using HTS to evaluate snowfields such as those dominated by green algae, HTS outputs need to be thoroughly checked when organisms are poorly represented in databases, which is the case for cryoflora (Lutz et al. 2019). An optimized workflow was recommended to include a consistent sampling, a two‐molecular marker approach, light microscopy‐based guidance, generations of appropriate reference sequences, and final manual verification of taxonomic assignments. HTS and subsequent oligotyping on the Greenland Ice Sheet showed an extremely low algal diversity of the streptophytes, Ancylonema nordenskiöldii and Mesotaenium berggrenii that dominated at all sites (Lutz et al. 2018). Green snow represented a wet, carbon, and nutrient‐rich environment dominated by Microglena, whereas red snow was dry, nutrient poor, and colonized by Chloromonas (Lutz et al. 2015b). Population densities of Chloromonas reticulata reached 0.33 × 104 cells · mL−1 in red snow from the Ural Mtns., Russia (Novakovskaya et al. 2018). They found alliance of the Russian strain with other strains of Cr. reticulata using ITS2, morphology, and TEM. Golden‐brown snow caused by the chrysophyte, Hydrurus, populated water‐logged snow fields in Antarctica and Svalbard (Remias et al. 2013a), and A. nordenskiöldii, cyanobacteria, and diverse green algae dominated on three different glaciers in Svalbard (Takeuchi et al. 2019). Similarities between specific habitats across glaciers and ice sheets worldwide occur regarding their main primary producers (Anesio et al. 2017). At the surface, cyanobacteria dominate the carbon production in aquatic and sediment systems such as cryoconite holes, while Zygnematales and Chlamydomonadales dominate ice surfaces and snow dynamics, respectively. Mesotaenium berggrenii and A. nordenskiöldii dominated the ice area on the Akkem Glacier in the Russian Altai Mtns as reported for other glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas a Chloromonas sp. causing a red coloration dominated the snow area (Takeuchi et al. 2006a). Mesotaenium berggrenii, Cylindrocystis brébissonii, Ancylonema sp., and the desmid Closterium sp. dominated the lower elevation of Tyndall Glacier, Chile, Chloromonas sp. and an Oscillatoriacean cyanobacterium the middle part, and an unknown alga the upper part (Takeuchi and Kohshima 2004).\n\nUsing satellite imagery, distribution of red snow (Chlamydomonas nivalis) on Harding Icefield, Alaska, matched field observations with more algae on the continental than the maritime side of the icefield (Takeuchi et al. 2006a). Mean carbon content from the red algal biomass averaged 1.2 kg · km−2. Satellite imagery indicated that Qaanaaq Glacier in northwest Greenland had a dark‐colored surface compared to the lighter one on Russel Glacier in west central Greenland due to the former dominated by green algae and the latter by cyanobacteria (Uetake et al. 2010). The biovolume was 2.35 times higher on Qaanaaq Glacier at the same altitude. With Sentinel‐3 imagery, the spatial pattern of glacial algae, Ancylonema nordenskiöldii and Mesotaenium berggrenii, in Greenland using the reflectance ratios between 709 nm and 673 nm bands was highly consistent with field measurements (Wang et al. 2018). Their analysis revealed widespread proliferation of algae on bare ice from late July to mid‐August with increasing algal populations after the peak of surface runoff and meltwater production.\n\nThe only record where filamentous cyanobacteria dominated was from Miaoergou Glaciers in the Kalik Mtns in western China, and no green algae were found, which was common in the northern Tibetan Plateau (Takeuchi et al. 2008). The snow algal community on Rikha‐Samba Glacier in western Nepal consisted of the streptophytes, Mesotaenium berggrenii and Cylindrocystis brébissonii, and filamentous and coccoid cyanobacteria (Takeuchi et al. 2009). Populations of Chlamydomonas nivalis on Gulkana Glacier, Alaska Range, Alaska, dominated on the snow surface and Ancylonema nordenskiöldii and M. berggrenii on the ice surface in September, and these algae contribute to the net production of organic carbon (Takeuchi 2013). Snow and ice algal communities on glaciers in the Suntar‐Khayata Mtn Range in Russian Siberia were dominated by A. nordenskiöldii in the lower bare ice area and Chloromonas sp. in the upper snow area (Tanaka et al. 2016). The total algal bio volume showed altitudinal variation ranging from 0.03 to 4.0 mL · m−2, was highest in the middle of the glaciers, and was similar on all glaciers. Over 3 years, there was no significant change in community structure, but there was in the total biomass. Pinnacle‐shaped ice structures (“nieves penitentes”) in high elevations (5,277 m a.s.l.) of the dry Chilean Andes supported red ice patches dominated by Chlamydomonas and Chloromonas, which were closely related to snow algae from alpine and polar regions (Vimercati et al. 2019a). These pinnacles provide water and shelter from high winds, high UV irradiance, and thermal fluctuations in this otherwise extreme landscape that was suggested as a terrestrial analog for astrobiological studies for life outside Earth.\n\nPopulations of snow and glacial algae, food chains, food webs, and associated physical and chemical parameters make up complex snow and glacial ecosystems (Aitchison 2001, Hoham and Duval 2001). Bacteria, fungi, archaea, and algae are normal inhabitants of glacial surfaces (Lutz et al. 2015a, Ciccazzo et al. 2016) that may also include viruses and metazoans (Sattler et al. 2010). Green algae, cyanobacteria, bacteria, fungi, and pollen on the Sofiyskiy Glacier in the Altai Mtns Russia were used to date ice cores that contained 16 annual layers marking summer layers when present and winter layers when absent (Uetake et al. 2006). Using a HTS approach for microbial communities on Icelandic glaciers, snow algae (Chloromonas polyptera, Raphidonema sempervirens, and two chlamydomonads) were detected supporting a community of other microbes (eukaryotes, prokaryotes, archaea; Lutz et al. 2015a). Employing 18S rRNA, several species of green algae, fungi, and various bacterial phylotypes were detected from red snow in Langhovde, Antarctica (Fujii et al. 2010). The bacteria found were closely related to psychrophilic heterotrophic strains with Hymenobacter being the most prominent. The site was enriched with 15N and the primary source was fecal pellets from seabirds. From green and red‐colored snow on Mt. Asahi, Japan, Chloromonas spp. dominated all samples and Chlamydomonas was second most abundant in red snow (Terashima et al. 2017). Bacteria from the subphylum Betaproteobacteria were frequent in both green and red snow, while members of the phylum Bacteroidetes were prominent in red snow. Using bacterial 16S rRNA, 13 phyla and 82 genera of bacteria were found on glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau (Yongqin 2011). In red and green snow in Ryder Bay, Antarctic Peninsula, green communities that consisted of Chloromonas, Chlamydomonas, and Chlorella had a high chlorophyll content, and both communities contained bacteria, protists, and fungi (Davey et al. 2019). At several New England, USA ski slopes, orange cysts of an unidentified Chloromonas were associated with filamentous fungi, rotifers, and ciliates (Duval and Hoham 2000). These cysts were found only on ski slopes, which exemplifies this habitat needs further investigations. In the Carpathians of Slovakia, a snow community included Chloromonas nivalis, cyanobacteria, fungi, ciliates, rotifers, nematodes, and tardigrades (Hanzelová et al. 2018). From glacial ice at the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro on the Tanzania‐Kenya border, bacterial OTUs (16S rRNA) were dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria (Vimercati et al. 2019b). Cyanobacteria represented 10% of sequences with most in the Oscillatoriales and Chroococcales. Eukaryotic OTUs (18S rRNA) revealed that Chlorophycean green algae comprised about 9% of total ice sequences and were most closely related to Chlamydomonas, Chloromonas, and Stigeoclonium. Cercozoa dominated the ice communities representing 72% of total sequences. It is believed that under present conditions of climate change, rapid glacial shrinking at the top of Kilimanjaro, which supports both cosmopolitan and endemic microbial communities, will continue unabated and the entire summit of the mountain is expected to be devoid of ice for the first time in 11,000 years by mid‐century. Metagenomic and satellite analyses from Franz Josef Land in the Russian Arctic confirmed that white snow and ice were initially colonized by fungal dominated communities that were replaced with more complex red snow communities of Cd. nivalis, which supported complex viral and heterotrophic bacterial communities (Hisakawa et al. 2015). By comparing metagenomes from snow samples collected in a Greenland sea ice snow cover, composition and function of microbial communities were influenced primarily by atmospheric deposition and in flow of sea ice brine that form a snow‐specific assemblage reflecting the particular environmental conditions of the snowpack (Maccario et al. 2019).\n\nCryoconite holes play important roles in glacial ecosystems (Takeuchi 2011). Rotifers, tardigrades, copepods, and midge larvae are sustained by snow algae and cyanobacteria on Himalayan glaciers, whereas ice worms and collembola are common in North American glaciers. Cryoconite granules from ice areas on northwest Greenland glaciers are aggregates of mineral particles, filamentous cyanobacteria, other microbes, and organic matter, while those in snow areas consisted of mineral particles and snow algae (Takeuchi et al. 2014).\n\nPrimary productivity and secondary metabolites\n\nPrimary productivity was examined from glaciers on stratovolcanoes in the Pacific NW, USA, and most was attributed to photoautotrophic snow algal communities (Hamilton and Havig 2017), and increasing levels of CO2 correlated with increased primary productivity in snow algae (Hamilton and Havig 2018). Cyanobacteria on glaciers in Svalbard produce glue‐like extracellular polymeric substances that aggregate organic and inorganic debris (cryoconite) by cementing mineral grains (quartz and dolomite), and these dark‐colored aggregates grow and reside on glacial surfaces for years (Hodson et al. 2010). Coastal snowpacks had greater bacterial diversity and autotrophic biomass on Livingston Island, Antarctica, than snowpacks <1 km from the coast and greater amounts of nutrients from rock debris and marine fauna, higher amounts of DIC and CO2 in interstitial air, and a close relationship between chlorophyll and DOC. On the Greenland Ice Sheet, algal cell abundance, which ranged from 90 cells · mL−1 to 0.98 × 104 cells · mL−1, increased significantly with the amount of visible impurities seen on the ice surface (Holland et al. 2019). Correlations between average algal cell counts and DON and DOC surface ice concentrations were significant. Growth and oxygen evolution capacity in Chlamydomonas nivalis were low at 2°C, enhanced at 10°C, and were significantly higher at 5–15°C when compared to the mesophilic Cd. reinhardtii (Lukeš et al. 2014). Molecular mechanisms responsible for adaptation to photosynthesis at low temperature were attributed to high rates of QA to QB electron transfer. Photosynthetic and respiratory data support the cryophilic adaptation of Cd. nivalis in the Austrian Alps, but cells produced oxygen without inhibition at temperatures up to 20°C and maintained this for 1 h at irradiances up to 1,800 μmol PAR · m−2 · s−1 (Remias et al. 2005). Chlorophyll and primary carotenoid pigment composition was similar to that found in most other Chlorophyta. Photosynthetic relative electron rates measured using a Walz fluorimeter in cysts of Chloromonas nivalis from the Austrian Alps at 54–1,394 μmol PAR · m−2 · s−1 peaked at the highest irradiance level tested (Remias et al. 2010a). Using a modified LiCor gas‐exchange system, CO2 uptake to 0.3 μmol PAR. m−2. s−1 occurred in dense blooms of Chlamydomonas nivalis in the Snowy Range of the Rocky Mts, USA (Williams et al. 2003). CO2 uptake at 2,300 μmol PAR · m−2 · d−1 occurred in heavily colonized patches indicating that summer snowfields can be very productive. Red light was more effective for CO2 uptake than white and much more than green or blue due to the red astaxanthin that surrounds and masks the algal chloroplasts. Supraglacial cyanobacteria and algae capture CO2 from the atmosphere and convert it into organic matter, which is broken down and combined with transported organic matter to generate CO2 that is released back into the atmosphere (Stibal et al. 2012). The balance between these two processes will determine if a glacier is a net sink or source of CO2. Ice sheet interiors function as sinks and ice sheet edges and small glaciers act as a source. Glacial algal assemblages are a potentially important yet under researched component of the global biosphere and carbon and water cycles (Havig and Hamilton 2019, Williamson et al. 2019).\n\nAstaxanthin linked with two glucoses and fatty acids were identified in Chlamydomonas nivalis as a diglucoside diester using HPLC and Mass Spectrometry (Řezanka et al. 2008b) and trans‐ and cis‐forms of astaxanthin accumulate in this species of which the latter additionally absorbs in the UV with a shoulder peaking at 375 nm (Remias and Lütz 2007). Astaxanthin derivatives in Chlamydomonas nivalis from the Austrian Alps, Slovak High Tatra Mtns, and Bulgaria Pirin using HPLC showed differences in their composition of optical isomers with a dominance of diglucoside diesters from the Pirin Mtns (Řezanka et al. 2013). Carotenoids and phenols (astaxanthin in snow algae and purpurogallin in glacial algae) shield the photosynthetic apparatus by absorbing visible wavelengths dissipating the excess radiant energy as heat (Dial et al. 2018). This heat is thought to melt proximal ice crystals providing liquid water at 0°C freeing up nutrients bound in frozen water. They also hypothesized that green colored snow algae occupy saturated snow where water is not limiting, and red colored snow algae occupy drier more water limited snow. The accumulation of secondary carotenoids and a decline of chlorophyll in Chlamydomonas red snow was attributed to breakdown into phaeophytin caused by UV radiation using Raman spectroscopy at exposed surfaces on McLeod Glacier, Signy Island, Antarctica (Edwards et al. 2004). Raman spectroscopy was also used in the Krkonoše Mts., Czech Republic and Ötztal Alps, Austria, to detect astaxanthin in different stages in the life cycles of the snow algae, Chloromonas nivalis and Chlamydomonas nivalis (Jehlička et al. 2016). Green communities of Chloromonas, Chlamydomonas, and Chlorella from Ryder Bay, Antarctic Peninsula were protein rich and contained metabolites associated with nitrogen and amino acid metabolism (Davey et al. 2019). Red communities of Chloromonas had high carotenoid content and contained more metabolites associated with carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism. MAAs also offer protection from UV and were found in higher concentration in green snow of unknown species composition than in red snow from King George Island, Antarctica (Kim et al. 2018). Generally, chlamydomonadalean and streptophytic snow and glacial algae do not accumulate MAAs (D. Remias, pers. obs.). Two chrysophytes from golden‐brown snow in Japan, Ochromonas smithii and O. itoi, use only the violaxanthin cycle for photoprotection as a dissipation system of surplus energy under prolonged high light stress as determined with a PAM chlorophyll fluorimeter (Tanabe et al. 2011).\n\nMany microorganisms survive in cold environments by secreting IBPs that control growth and ice around them. An IBP (ChloroIBP) was identified and characterized in a freshwater Chloromonas sp. from Antarctica (Jung et al. 2016). Four isoforms of an extracellular IBP in a Chlamydomonas from Antarctica did not resemble any known antifreezes, had strong recrystallization inhibition activity, and had the ability to slow the drainage of brine from sea ice (Raymond et al. 2009). These properties, by maintaining liquid environments, may increase survival of cells in freezing temperatures. The IBPs had a repeating TXT motif, which has previously been implicated in ice binding in insect antifreezes and a ryegrass antifreeze. In the snow alga, Chloromonas brevispina, genes were found for over 20 IBP isoforms all of which matched fungal and bacterial proteins than algal IBPs providing evidence that the genes were acquired by horizontal transfer (Raymond 2014). However, it remains unclear as to what extent snow algae can export proteins in the nitrogen‐poor environment in which they mostly live.\n\nPUFAs formed nearly 50% of total lipids dominated by phospholipids and glycolipids that would select for life at or near the freezing point in Chloromonas nivalis v. tatrae from the High Tatra Mtns, Slovakia (Procházková et al. 2018b). Cysts of the snow alga, Chloromonas hindakii, from mountain ranges in the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia showed high levels of PUFAs (65.8% and 58.1% of total lipids), whereas the content of saturated acids did not exceed 23% (mainly palmitic acid, 16:0; Procházková et al. 2019b). This combination was regarded as an adaptation to cold temperatures. PUFAs identified by gas chromatography‐mass spectrometry (GC‐MS) made up more than 75% of total fatty acids in Chloromonas brevispina from the Bohemian Forest, Czech Republic (Řezanka et al. 2008a). Also, Chlainomonas sp. from ice covers of European mountain lakes abundantly accumulates PUFAs (Procházková et al. 2018a). Using lipidomics, snow species in Chloromonas were found to be a major producer of C16 PUFAs (16:3 and 16:4; Řezanka et al. 2014).\n\nVegetative cells of the glacial ice streptophyte, Mesotaenium berggrenii, from the Austrian Alps produce high amounts of intraplastidial starch, cytoplasmic lipid bodies, and numerous peripheral vacuoles that housed an unidentified brownish pigment that screened for irradiance damage (Remias et al. 2009). This pigment was subsequently identified as a UV and VIS absorbing purpurogallin derivative, a unique phenolic compound to this group of algae (Remias et al. 2012b). Similarly, Ancylonema nordenskiöldii, from glacial ice in Svalbard had peripheral brownish vacuoles that absorbed potentially damaging PAR and UV (Remias et al. 2012a). Photosynthesis measurements at 1°C and different light levels in M. berggrenii, and different temperatures and light levels in A. nordenskiöldii, indicated that metabolism is adapted to temperatures near freezing and to high light conditions in both species. From 48 to 1362 μmol PAR · m−2 · s−1 oxygen production continued to rise with no inhibition at the highest level in cysts of Chloromonas polyptera from Antarctica (Remias et al. 2013b).\n\nGenomics, systematics, and evolution\n\nThe rise of molecular methods brought many new insights to the systematics of snow algae in the last two decades. The molecular phylogeny using SSU rRNA and taxonomic revision of the Chlamydomonas–Chloromonas complex in the chlamydomonadalean green algae revealed seven different clades confirming the polyphyly of the two genera (Pröschold et al. 2001). However, Chloromonas was emended on the basis of chloroplast characters and all species with or without pyrenoids were placed in a monophyletic clade with the type species, Chloromonas reticulata. In contrast, Chlamydomonas is a polyphyletic genus and the main cause of red snow traditionally associated with Chlamydomonas nivalis, which was recently re‐described creating a new genus Sanguina with two species, S. nivaloides and S. aurantia (Procházková et al. 2019a). They showed that S. nivaloides is a diverse cosmopolitan species with 18 haplotypes using ITS2 rDNA analysis with low nucleotide divergence (≤3.5%). Though they did not attempt to synonymize Cd. nivalis with S. nivaloides because there is no conclusive way to do so, for completeness, an overview of the nomenclatural complexity related to Cd. nivalis was given.\n\nThe first comprehensive molecular phylogeny of Chlamydomonas–Chloromonas snow species used 18S rDNA and rbcL gene sequence analysis (Hoham et al. 2002). The 21 cold‐tolerant taxa of which 10 were from snow, occurred in four distinct clades, suggested at least five origins in cold habitats, and all snow species occurred in a single clade. The snow species occurred in two groups in subclade 1 and a third group was in subclade 2, which suggested that the snow habitat had been colonized at least twice and possibly three times in its evolutionary history. This phylogeny supported previous findings that pyrenoids have been gained and lost several times within this complex. In all, 48 species of green algae were recognized from snow of which 18 were in the Chlamydomonas–Chloromonas complex (Komárek and Nedbalová 2007) and 15 species of Chloromonas from snow and ice were separated in a taxonomic key using cytological and morphological features of which 10 were examined using cultured material (Matsuzaki et al. 2015).\n\nBipolar phylotypes accounted for 37.3% of all sequences using 18S rRNA and ITS2 sequences from Arctic and Antarctic red snow samples, suggesting that red snow algal blooms in polar regions may comprise cosmopolitan phylotypes but also include endemic species (Segawa et al. 2018). Six snow‐inhabiting species of Chloromonas with elongate or ellipsoidal vegetative cells were examined using LM and TEM for differences in vegetative cell shape, chloroplast morphology, the number of zoospores within the parental cell, and the formation of cell aggregates in old cultures (Matsuzaki et al. 2014). Their multigene analysis along with ITS2 rDNA separated four of the six species within a small clade (Chloromonas fukushimae, Cr. hohamii, Cr. tenuis, Cr. tughillensis), and all six species including Cr. chenangoensis and Cr. pichinchae were in a clade of snow algae. Using rbcL and 18S rRNA analyses, a new species isolated from snow in Svalbard, Cr. arctica, nested within a clade containing a number of psychrotolerant strains in the Chloromonadinia phylogroup (Barcyt≐ et al. 2018). The ITS2 rDNA marker showed support for a new species differing from its closest matches, Chlamydomonas gerlofii and Cr. reticulata, by three and five compensatory base changes, respectively. Chloromonas nivalis from the Austrian Alps and Svalbard grouped in one clade using 18S rDNA, but separated from Cr. nivalis from North America that appeared in a different snow clade, which supported that Cr. nivalis is polyphyletic (Remias et al. 2010a). Using LM and multiple gene analyses, zygotes of Cr. nivalis and Cr. brevispina are polyphyletic and those of Cr. nivalis from Japan and Austria represent at least four different lineages all of which are separated from North American strains (Matsuzaki et al. 2015). Zygotes of Cr. brevispina from Japan were transferred to a new species, Cr. krienitzii, because vegetative cells of Cr. krienitzii are different from those of Cr. brevispina in North America. Further studies of Cr. nivalis isolates from North America and Svalbard using LM., TEM, and multiple gene analyses, yielded two new species, Cr. hoshawii and Cr. remiasii, and verified that Cr. nivalis from North America and Svalbard was separated phylogenetically from zygotes of Cr. nivalis from Austria and Japan (Matsuzaki et al. 2018). Similar multiple gene analyses from Japan showed that one lineage of Cr. nivalis zygotes belonged to the snow alga, Chloromonas miwae, and that a new snow algal species, Cr. muramotoi, is sister to Cr. miwae (Matsuzaki et al. 2019). Chloromonas rosae v. psychrophila from North America produces asexual resting spores identical to Scotiella cryophila (Hoham et al. 2002). In the Austrian Alps, S. cryophila resting spores were found but not the vegetative cells that produce them (Remias et al. 2018). Using 18S rDNA, rbcL, and ITS2 rDNA, these European S cryophila K‐1 cell types are related to snow species of Chloromonas, but form an independent lineage from the North American populations of Cr. rosae v. psychrophila (Fig. ). This may be another example of a polyphyletic Chloromonas snow species, but until the vegetative cells from the European Alps are sequenced this cannot be resolved. In the Austrian Alps, a new species of chrysophytes, Kremastochrysopsis austriaca, colors the snow golden‐brown (Remias et al. 2019). Using 18S rRNA and rbcL analyses, this species showed no close phylogenetic relationships to other psychrophilic chrysophytes (Chromulina chionophilia, Hydrurus sp., or Ochromonas spp.).\n\nSeveral psychrophilic strains of Chlamydomonas isolated from snow and ice fields in polar regions (Antarctica, Svalbard, Japan, and Alaska) belong to the green alga, Microglena (Demchenko et al. 2012). Using SSU and ITS1 and ITS2 rDNA, phylogenetic analyses revealed that all strains of Microglena form a monophyletic lineage within the Chlorophyceae regardless of habitat. However, the polar species form a subclade within the monophyletic lineage.\n\nTranscriptomes as part of the 1000 Genome Project for Plants were done for Chloromonas rosae v. psychrophila UTEX SNO 47 (AJUW) and Cr. tughillensis UTEX SNO 88 (UTRE) listed under Green Algae Chlamydomonadaceae ( http://www.onekp.com/samples/list.php). The metagenome for Cr. brevispina UTEX SNO 96 (SRX1114535) is available (Raymond 2016, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX1114535[accn]). The metagenome for Kremastochrysopsis austriaca (Raymond and Remias 2019) and transcriptome for Chromulina chionophilia, CCMP 261 (K. Terpis, pers. comm.) have been completed for these two snow algal chrysophytes.\n\nEnvironmental parameters Biotechnology and commercial uses"
