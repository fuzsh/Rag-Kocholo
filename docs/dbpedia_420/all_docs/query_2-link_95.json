        "text": "The Giant is a Zombies map in Call of Duty: Black Ops III. It is a remake of the Der Riese Zombies map from Call of Duty: World at War and the Rezurrection DLC pack from Call of Duty: Black Ops. This map is only available to season pass owners as of now.\n\nThe layout is unchanged from the previous two iterations of the map. Apart from the upgraded graphics and assets, weapons have been replaced with those available in Black Ops III. Furthermore, GobbleGum machines have been added around the map.\n\nThe Perk-A-Cola Machines switch around at the start of each game. Before a Perk-A-Cola Machine can be used, the power must be enabled in the western courtyard. The Perk-A-Colas available in this map include:\n\nThe last two will switch from game to game and can only be accessed through an easter egg. To access the sixth Perk-A-Cola Machine, you must first link all three teleporters. Once those are enabled, you will need three Cymbal Monkeys from the Mystery Box. Next, you must throw a Cymbal Monkey on the teleport pad and use all three teleporters. Finally, interact with the console next to the mainframe by the Pack-A-Punch machine and press the red button. A laser will shoot from the Giant robot's head, melting snow in the central courtyard area (near the Animal Testing Labs) and exposing the sixth Perk-A-Cola Machine.\n\nThe only creatures on this map are zombies and Hellhounds. They will first appear alone at every five rounds (roughly), but will begin appearing alongside the zombies around round 16.\n\nThe Pack-A-Punch Machine is located at the starting area in the courtyard. To access the machine, you must enable the power in the western courtyard, then link all teleporters with the mainframe directly in front of the Pack-A-Punch Machine. To do this, stand on each teleporter and hold the reload button (Square on PlayStation, X on Xbox). You must then rush to the mainframe and hold the reload button again to link the teleporter. If you do not reach the mainframe within 30 seconds, you will have to try again.\n\nLinking the teleporters also enables them for use. Teleporter costs 1500 points and can only be used once per round. They will transport any players within the teleporter to the mainframe and might drop a Power Up in the courtyard. They're great for a quick escape.\n\nTraps are set at the garage and at the western courtyard. They are enabled for 30 seconds after spending 1000 points at a red electrical box. These traps block off a path with electrical currents. Anything that touches them will be killed, and players will be downed. No points will be awarded for any zombie deaths caused by the trap.\n\nAll players start out with the MR6 in the courtyard near the mainframe and Pack-A-Punch Machine. There are four barriers zombies can come from, one for each player.\n\nTwo doors can be opened to the north and south. Each door costs 750 points to open and will lead out to the central courtyard. Unfortunately, additional doors will block the courtyards from connecting to each other and the western courtyard until the power is enabled.\n\nThe central courtyard connects the eastern courtyard to the western courtyard. However, as mentioned above, the central courtyard will be blocked from connecting by additional doors that cannot be purchased until the power is enabled.\n\nThe northern half of the central courtyard leads to the hangar / garage. This door can be opened with 750 points. Just in front of this door is a GobbleGum Machine and a shotgun.\n\nThe southern half of the central courtyard leads to the animal testing labs. This door can be opened with 750 points. To the right of this door is a GobbleGum Machine and a machine pistol.\n\nOnce the power has been enabled and the paths connect throughout the courtyards, a Perk-A-Cola Machine can be used and a submachine gun can be purchased off the wall.\n\nThe Animal Testing Labs can be reached from the eastern courtyards or from the Generators 2nd floor. If you entered from the courtyards, you will find a submachine gun on the left wall.\n\nThe debris up the stairs at the end of the lab can be cleared with 1000 points. These stairs will lead to the Generators 2nd floor (south end). Additionally, there's a GobbleGum Machine to the right of the stairs.\n\nThe south side can be accessed from the animal testing labs. This area holds an explosive that fills the special grenades spot. Further ahead is another Perk-A-Cola Machine at a dead end.\n\nTeleporter B can be accessed from the north end of Generators 2nd Floor. It is a small room with another teleport pad. This is one of the three teleporters that must be connected with the mainframe to gain access to the Pack-A-Punch machine. However, the power must first be enabled.\n\nAn assault rifle can be purchased from the right wall. Further right is a chalk board with a set of frag grenades.\n\nThe western courtyard is connected to the other courtyards once the power has been enabled. The power switch is located on the electric generator on the left side of this area.\n\nThe small room to the right of the teleporter entrance is Dr. Maxis' office. This room holds another Perk-A-Cola Machine. A few steps to the left is a hole down to a small tunnel.\n\nThe teleporter in the back of the room is teleport pad C. This is one of the three teleporters that must be connected with the mainframe to gain access to the Pack-A-Punch machine. However, the power must first be enabled. To the left of the teleport pad is an assault rifle wall buy.\n\nTo the right of the teleport pad is a small tunnel. This is the same tunnel that can be accessed from Dr. Maxis' office. A set of grenades can be purchased here.\n\nA long catwalk extends over the entrance to teleporter C. Players can use this to escape from zombies coming through the front door."
