First Hand Report

This will be our last day out for the season and great time at Giants Ridge. The snow was in amazing shape, which says a lot about the snow crew here at Giants as it was an extremely difficult year for snow. We always enjoy our time up at Giants. Well done this season for all the staff at Giants!

Giant's Ridge Resort, located in Minnesota's Iron Range northwest of Duluth, is one of the Gopher State's biggest golf and ski resorts. Residents are proud of its reputation as "America's Icebox." The ski resort boasts a 1,792 foot summit elevation, as well as a 7,000 person uphill capacity. The 35 trails that soar off the rocky crest offer some of the best cruising runs around the Great Lakes. Giants Ridge has an intermediate and beginner terrain park as well as a Children's sledding area and sliding hill. The Giant was first developed as an Olympic training site with World Class cross country trails, and the trails are still maintained to Olympic quality standards.
