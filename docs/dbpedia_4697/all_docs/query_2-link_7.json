        "text": "Northern Ireland MPs\n\nAlert! Updated with 2001 Election Results Alert!\n\nAs well as the 108 members of Northern Ireland's home-rule Assembly, established in the year 2000, Northern Ireland elects 18 representatives to sit in the United Kingdom Parliament in Westminster, London. These elections take place at least every 5 years, and the last election was on June 7th, 2001. The map below shows the electoral constituencies in Northern Ireland, each of which sends one representative to Westminster in a first-past-the-post ballot. Each constituency has very roughly the same population and are changed every decade or so, as the pattern of settlement changes. The last realignment of boundaries was in 1995 when Tyrone West was created.\n\nRepresentative Party Constituency Adams, Gerry1 Sinn Féin Belfast West Beggs, Roy UUP Antrim East Burnside, David UUP Antrim South Campbell, Gregory DUP East Londonderry Dodds, Nigel DUP Belfast North Doherty, Pat1 Sinn Féin West Tyrone Donaldson, Jeffrey UUP Lagan Valley Gildernew, Michelle1 Sinn Féin Fermanagh & South Tyrone Hermon, Lady Sylvia UUP North Down Hume, John SDLP Foyle Mallon, Seamus SDLP Newry and Armagh McGrady, Eddy SDLP South Down McGuinness, Martin1 Sinn Féin Mid Ulster Paisley, Rev Ian DUP Antrim North Robinson, Iris DUP Strangford Robinson, Peter DUP Belfast East Smyth, Rev Martin UUP Belfast South Trimble, David UUP Upper Bann\n\n1 - Although elected, the four Sinn Fein MPs refuse to take part in government activity in Westminster.\n\nSummary\n\nUlster Unionist Party - 6 seats\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party - 5 seats\n\nSDLP - 3 seats\n\nSinn Fein - 4 seats\n\nRepublic of Ireland TDs\n\nThe Republic of Ireland is divided into a series of electoral constituencies, each of which elects a fixed number of representatives to the Dail, which sits in Dublin, by a process of proportional representation.
