In 1925 the Labour Party identified high taxation as a government weakness and decided to contest the Dublin North and Dublin South by-elections. Cullen, as general secretary of the Irish Bakers, Confectioners and Allied Workers Amalgamated Union, was candidate in Dublin North with Thomas Lawlor, Irish Municipal Employees Union, in Dublin South. Neither of them were elected. He was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Labour Party Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin North constituency at the June 1927 general election. He lost his seat at the September 1927 general election having only served 3 months as a TD. (en)\n\nPolaiteoir Éireannach ab ea Denis Cullen (23 Meán Fómhair 1878 - 26 Samhain 1971).
