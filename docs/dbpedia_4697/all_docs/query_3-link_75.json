This district blend allows for the reunification of communities along the Highway 4 corridor and joins them with the “LaMorinda” (Lafayette, Moraga and Orinda), San Ramon Valley, and Tri-Valley communities. The northern portion of the district joins many delta communities, while the central and southern portions link key Alameda & Contra Costa suburban communities with job centers.",

        "text": "Deferred Area of Senate District 7\n\nEvery 10 years after the US Census Data is released, the California Citizens Redistricting Commission draws new lines for representation that is reflective of the population changes. Senate districts have a unique issue that Assembly and Congressional districts do not have. Of the Senate districts established, only the even-numbered districts went into effect for the 2022 election cycle. The new odd-numbered districts will not go into effect until the 2024 election cycle. This means some members of the population do not have representation until 2024 when the next election cycle happens. These geographic areas are referred to as “deferred.” However, the Senate wants to ensure that anyone living in a deferred area is still represented by a California State Senator and therefore has been assigned a Senator to represent them until the next election occurs in 2 years.\n\nFor additional information on current Senate districts click here\n\nSenate District 7 Maps\n\nSD 7\n\nSD 7 - Assigned Deferred Area\n\nSD 7 - Assigned Deferred Area Zoom\n\nThe deferred area include the balance of Alameda County."
