        "text": "It is something that he more than hinted at in recent months but confirmation of the news that Michael Ring will not run in the next Dáil election was still a surprise. He has been such a strong presence in Mayo politics for 30-plus years that it will be strange without him. His departure does represent the end of an era.\n\nFrom his surprise election in the 1994 by-election, where he toppled the favourite, Beverley Flynn, whose father Pádraig had vacated a seat to take up a role as an EU Commissioner, Ring has left a considerable mark on Mayo political life.\n\nComing one Dáil term after Enda Kenny’s retirement, it pulls the curtain down on two men with a combined Dáil service as TDs in this county for 75 years. It is a huge changing of the guard in Mayo politics.\n\nAside from the first three years of his time in Dáil Éireann, most of his formative years were spent in opposition and it was a role that Ring thrived in. Fianna Fáil were in power from 1997 to 2011 and Ring loved to tackle them and hold them to account.\n\nFor many it remained to be seen how he would adjust to actually being in power when Enda Kenny led Fine Gael to a sweeping victory in 2011. Opposition TDs often have the luxury of being quasi-hurlers on the ditch. It is easier to point the finger and criticise than actually be the one with the responsibility to make changes. But there can be little argument that his time in Government was, overall, a success.\n\nRing was not pleased at being overlooked for a Cabinet role but was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. From 2016 to 2020 he had his coveted seat at the Cabinet table when he was appointed Minister for Rural and Community Development.\n\nRing was fortunate that he was appointed to ministry positions with spending power. His patronage of many sporting and community projects throughout Mayo and the country earned him the appreciation of so many communities, particularly in rural Ireland.\n\nIt also earned him some criticism when it was reported that Mayo was receiving what some felt was more than its fair share. There may have been merit in this argument but the counterpoint to that is to consider how many administrations where Mayo was on the back foot, overlooked, left in the shade. One only needs to look at how imbalanced we are from an economic development perspective compared to the east coast. Indeed, money directed by Ring was only scratching the surface of what needed – and still needs – to be done.\n\nIt is a pity it was one man often on a solo run and not a systemic approach by government for counties like Mayo who needed greater investment. Indeed if there were to be any particular criticisms of Ring during his time in Government, it was that whilst he delivered well in his own portfolio, he was not able to influence matters more broadly. Easier said than done perhaps.\n\nHe said privately in the run-up to the 2020 election that he was looking forward to going into opposition as he felt it was inevitable Fine Gael would not be returned to power. He was rubbing his hands with glee about the prospect of tackling what he felt were systemic issues in various government departments.\n\nEven though Fine Gael did return to Government, Ring as a Government backbencher in the last four years was quite the outspoken Government TD. But it would have been very interesting – and no doubt entertaining – to watch him in outright opposition.\n\nAnother criticism that has been regularly levelled at him, including by this writer, is that he is too combustible. Sometimes too sensitive to criticism, sometimes gets vexed and speaks perhaps a bit too plainly with people.\n\nHe is certainly a straight-shooter. This writer had plenty of rows over the years where the decibel levels would rise. But this nature is something many people appreciate. They feel – with good justification – that Ring is a good man to have in your corner, fighting for your county. And his record speaks for itself in that regard.\n\nHere was a TD who fought tooth and nail for his constituents from his first day in the Dáil. It’s hard to imagine him cruising to the finish line either. You get the feeling his constituents will still get bang for their buck from Ring as a TD until the very end of this Dáil term. And quite possibly beyond that.\n\nHe was often caricatured as a typical parish pump TD, a great man for attending funerals, for attending to what many would consider minor constituency queries on behalf of the electorate. He did those things but that’s not all he did. He was an incredible worker and had seemingly boundless energy levels. Therefore, he did those things because whether we like it or not, that’s the game in Mayo and much of Irish politics. You have to look after your base, you have to take care of some things that, in truth, should not be the responsibility of TDs. But Michael Ring knew it was pointless complaining about that – if you wanted to be returned as a TD on a regular basis, this is how you got your votes.\n\nHe was – is – a doer and Ring and his constituency team led by his wife Ann ran some ship. The evidence of it is there at every election. He has always been either the first or second elected and in two of the last three general elections he has been elected on the first count.\n\nWhat we as an electorate consider important for our politicians is the problem. Many's the politician in this county and beyond who suffered for taking their eye off constituency matters at a local level which they may have felt was beneath their responsibilities but they learned the hard way that it is key to getting reelected.\n\nMichael Ring was a once-off. We may never see a TD of his ilk in Mayo again. Whether you loved him or hated him – and there were more of the former but a few of the latter too – you cannot deny his ferocious appetite for work for his constituency. He leaves politics as a man who has done his county considerable service. And leaves very big shoes to fill."
