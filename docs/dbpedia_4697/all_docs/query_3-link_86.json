        "text": "One of the best experiences when attending a Florida State Seminoles football game is the atmosphere created by the student-musicians performing their roles as part of the World Renowned FSU Marching Chiefs, as well as the electricity generated by the Seminole Sound when performing at basketball, soccer, softball, volleyball, baseball, and other Nole athletic events.\n\nEven to this day I still get goosebumps when I hear the Drum Major blow their whistle 6 times, because I know I’m about to hear the War Chant start being played.\n\nTomahawk Nation is honored to have Dr. David Plack, Director of FSU Athletic Bands, answer a few questions about himself, his position, and the FSU Marching Chiefs, the band that has never lost a halftime show.\n\n1. Please give us a little background info about yourself. Where you’re from, high school, band member?, earliest point realizing music was going to be a part of your life, your FSU and Marching Chiefs experience as a student, married, children, other interests.\n\nI was born in Morgantown, West Virginia. Fun fact, I was born in Morgantown while Bobby Bowden was the coach and my parents were in nursing and dental school. My father was in the US Army so I grew up moving around the country, including some high school years at Mililani High School in Hawaii, to where I eventually graduated from, Shaw High School in Columbus, Georgia. Like most musicians and band directors, my high school band director, Tim Zabel, was a significant influence on me and instilled my interest and desire to ‘be like him.’\n\nSo, after graduation, on a whim, I found myself driving down to audition at this well known music school at Florida State University in 1988. Within a few weeks after, my bags were packed and I was headed to Tallahassee to begin my music education degree and march in the Marching Chiefs. I marched in the baritone section for four years and graduated with my BA in 1991. After considering a career change and leaving music, I found myself back at FSU only a year later, in large part to my mentor and our Director of Bands at that time, Dr. Jim Croft, to pursue my masters degree in music education.\n\nShortly thereafter, my first teaching job was as the Assistant Band Director at Vero Beach High School where I spent 7 years teaching alongside Jim Sammons. I left VBHS in 2002 to return to FSU and pursue my Ph.D. in music education.\n\nMy wonderful and supportive wife Jackie is a multiple FSU graduate and played flute in the Marching Chiefs. She currently works as a speech language pathologist here in town. I am also a proud #girldad with three girls, Camryn (14), Cary (10), and Dylan (6). I am also now officially a ‘Band Dad’ as my oldest is playing flute in middle school. That is a pretty cool thing.\n\nOutside of band related activities, I have been an active runner. I have completed a number of half marathons and 5 full marathons including the New York and Boston marathons, and in doing so have raised a collective total of nearly $25,000 for cancer research. One goal I have is to add the London Marathon to that list and raise money for a Parkinson’s charity.\n\n2. Tell us about your reaction and state of mind in 2004 when you were appointed to the wind band conducting and music education faculty at FSU and as the Director of Athletic Bands. I can only imagine being a former Chief this must have been a dream come true.\n\nWhen you come to a College of Music like ours for a graduate degree like a Ph.D. you are assured of finding employment in an entry level teaching or band director position… somewhere. In a million years, I would not have expected that to be at FSU. It never once crossed my mind.\n\nIn 2004, Patrick Dunnigan, our current Director of Bands, had been doing the Marching Chiefs on his own at that time since 1991, my senior year. The need and interest to create a Director of Athletic Bands position was expressed at that time and I was approached as ’the perfect fit.’ It was one of the most surreal moments in my life.\n\n3. What are your current responsibilities both with the Chiefs and as a faculty member?\n\nMy position of Director of Athletic Bands includes overseeing and directing the Marching Chiefs and our all-sport pep band, Seminole Sound. I also conduct the University Symphonic Band and teach Marching Band Techniques to our music education undergraduates. This year with the athletic bands, I am lucky to work alongside our current Assistant Director of Athletic Bands, Dr. Devan Moore. Dr. Moore is graduate of FAMU and did her doctoral degree with us. Dr. Moore spent the last two years in a similar position at Oklahoma State University. And of course, Patrick Dunnigan remains actively involved with us as Director of Bands.\n\n4. Where will the Band be sitting during home games this year with the ongoing renovations?\n\nThankfully the stadium construction will have no effect on us for the most part. We will remain in the North Endzone in Section 1. Since our move and with some necessary adjustments, we have loved being in that end zone with the students and right next to football recruits each game. It is also great being above the team entrance, which allows Coach Norvell to throw the band two signed ‘game balls’ after each victory. This is a tradition that started with Coach Bowden throwing his hat to the Chiefs after big road wins. Coach Norvell has added his own touch to this tradition with the footballs (and he can launch much further than a hat).\n\n5. What is the generally accepted year of origin, and is there any backstory to “MCATDT”?\n\nWith no absolute or direct knowledge, MCATDT likely dates as far back as the 1960s. ‘ATDT’ today is much more prevalent and known thanks to social media. It stands for Marching Chiefs All The Damn Time which while it has always been yelled after our performance of the Hymn to the Garnet and Gold at the end of games, it has become much more than that. It’s has become our every day mantra, a source of immense pride, and reflects the commitment our students make to the university and the Marching Chiefs.\n\n6. What will be the size of the Marching Chiefs next season? Are the Chiefs the largest collegiate marching band in the nation? During home games, how many Chiefs are on the field?\n\nWe can be as large as 420. That is essentially the cap we have placed for a variety of reasons including uniforms, equipment and yes, cost. We are not the largest college band in the nation but we are certainly one of the largest.\n\n7. After completing their week of tryouts, how much time will a member of the Chiefs expect to practice daily and weekly?\n\nWe practice and meet (as a class) from 4-6p every day during the season. We are proud that every member of the Marching Chiefs is an FSU student (no dual enrolled status) and not one member, including our music majors, are required to be in the band.\n\n8. What do you look for and what is the process for choosing the drum major?\n\nOur drum majors go through a rigorous audition process of three rounds. It starts with a first round of auditioning on their instrument, a marching demonstration, and conducting to a predetermined recording. We generally have around 40 audition in this round and 8 to 10 advance to the second round.\n\nThe second round consists of the strut and mace work, writing and teaching a small ‘drill’, a musical score test, and conducting the Anthem in front of a small band. From there we advance 5 candidates to the final round which takes place during the Spring Showcase/Game. They each ‘run the band’ during the course of the game for a period of time, as we are a band that allows the drum majors to do this every game. Of course, the band directors have our say as to what to play and when, when necessary.\n\nThe band then votes for Head Drum Major and then a second vote for the Assistant Drum Majors. It is quite the process. Our drum major legacy is one of a kind. They are consummate conductors, exemplary musicians, and model Chiefs.\n\n9. How many Chiefs will be making the trip to Ireland for the season opener? How long will you be there? What kind of experiences do you and the Chiefs expect to have there?\n\nWith thanks to our Dean, Dr. Todd Queen, and all of our alums and fans who generously helped support this trip, we are fortunate to take 170 band members, all juniors, seniors, and ’super seniors’ or 5th years. While we would have loved to have taken our sophomores, the cost for a trip of this kind simply made that impossible.\n\nWe leave on Wednesday the 21st and travel to Orlando on two commercial flights to Dublin. An overnight flight and time change will put us in Dublin early Thursday morning. We have a number of public performances including an appearance at EPIC (Irish Immigration Museum) that Friday at 11 am, and the FSU pep rally on the Smithfield Plaza at 3:30 pm.\n\nOn game day we are scheduled to perform for an FSU event at the RDS, the Royal Dublin Society, at 12:30pm, followed by a march to the stadium from there at 3:30 pm.\n\nFor us, this a whirlwind trip and we are approaching it as a ‘business trip’ first and foremost. That said, there will be some time for them to ‘experience and explore’ Dublin.\n\nEditors Note: Even though this project has ended, your donation to this fund is greatly appreciated. https://spark.fsu.edu/Project/2521/Marching-Chiefs-Dublin\n\n10. What would you consider your Top 3 proudest/coolest moments of your tenure so far?\n\nThere are many, but marching in the Rose Bowl Parade, National Championships, and marching in Normandy on Omaha Beach commemorating the 75th Anniversary of the D-Day invasion are a few. That said, I was there in Clemson for the punt-rookie, I was in Michigan in 1991, I was in the Swamp for Ward to Dunn, and there are so many more incredible game memories.\n\n11. What is your favorite genre of music to listen to when relaxing?\n\nMan, this is a tough question. I listen to A LOT of different music. I embrace and enjoy it all. That said, my favorite group of all time is probably Earth, Wind, and Fire.\n\n12. I think I speak for the majority of the Tomahawk Nation readers, if not for the majority of the FSU fan base, that when we heard the Marching Chiefs declined ESPN request to perform in Dublin, we were elated for petty reasons that only Seminole fans can understand. That being said, are you able to share any other details about the decision-making process that led to that final outcome?\n\nOne thing that did surprise us is that this is not a typical neutral site game similar to the LSU games where both bands marched pregame and halftime and the end zones were both teams. This is a GT home game. Both end zones are GT and we do not get to march pregame, sadly. This was disappointing needless to say. But we will march a segment of our own at halftime.\n\nAs for ESPN GAME DAY, there is some truth to this but it’s not entirely factual. On my site visit, our Ireland game host brought up ESPN GAME DAY, showed us where it would take place, and asked if we would want to build this into our game day schedule.\n\nThe game kicks off at Noon EST. As we all know, GAME DAY runs from 9am to NOON EST which would run right up to the kickoff of our game. So, it really was a matter of timing. I simply told them we’d rather play for our fans at an FSU event rather than stand at GAME DAY, thus our performance at the RDS and march to the stadium before the game. It was ultimately our call and this is what we felt was best for us and our fans in Ireland.\n\nWe realize the tremendous responsibility we have to represent our great university and the heritage of the Seminole Tribe of Florida every time we perform - and we are grateful for opportunities like these.\n\nFinally, I would be remiss to not thank our Dean of the College of Music, Dr. Todd Queen and our Athletic Director, Michael Alford, for recognizing the hard work and efforts of our students and for their unwavering support of our athletic bands. On top of that, the recognition and support we get from coaches of the FSU sports we support means the world to us. Make no mistake, at the end of day, what makes our students most proud, is knowing they are the soundtrack of FSU football and athletics."
