        "text": "Abstract Under many electoral systems, voters can choose between candidates, and, under some systems, between candidates of the same party—a situation that makes it possible for candidates to seek a personal vote. Studies of some countries have shown how personal voting is apparent in the success of particular types of candidates, notably incumbents, but there is little systematic study of personal motives among the electors themselves.\n\nThis paper examines voter preferences when voters are allowed to rank order large numbers of candidates both within and between different parties (STV-PR). How voters complete such a ballot has consequences both for models of voting behaviour and also for patterns of party competition. More concretely, although such a system should promote a great deal of candidate centered voting behaviour, this does not, in fact, seem to occur for the case we examine. While Irish voters do seem to exhibit multiple party loyalties they are, nevertheless, party and not candidate specific loyalties. The consequences of this for both a Michigan account of party loyalty and also standard interpretations of Irish party competition are discussed.\n\nIreland&#39;s electoral system is proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote (STV) in multi-seat constituencies. Voters are asked to rank the candidates in order of preference on the ballot paper. Proportional representa-tion, in some shape or form, is the preferred electoral system throughout most of the democratic world. STV is also used in Australia, New Zealand, Malta and Northern Ireland. However, the preferred choice in the UK is the single member plurality or &quot;first-past-the-post&quot; system where only one winning candidate repre-sents the constituency. This system can dramatically distort election results. For example, in the 1997 UK general election, the Labour party won 63% of the seats with a 43% share of the vote. In the 2002 general election in Ireland, Fianna F谩il won 48% of the seats with 41.5% of the first preference votes, and the outgoing Fianna F谩il/Progressive Democrats government together won 53% of the seats with 45.4% of the first..."
