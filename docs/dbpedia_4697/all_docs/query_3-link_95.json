        "text": "The councillors also recently requested an urgent meeting with the Department of Integration to express their concerns and propose a way forward.\n\nIn a statement representing the views of all councillors in the North Central area, they emphasised the need for inclusive dialogue and condemned the participation of individuals claiming to represent the area in violent protests up north.\n\n“We deplore the presence at a racist, sectarian, and violent march in Belfast at the weekend of people purporting to represent Coolock, and we assert that they in no way speak for the people of Coolock or any part of Dublin,” the statement said.\n\n“All seventeen North Central Councillors endorse the Northside Community Forum's call for facilitated dialogue with Coolock residents and community groups.\n\n“They insist that local issues must be addressed and believe that dialogue is essential to overcoming disinformation, disruption, fear, and violence in the community.”\n\nOne council member told the Irish Independent that the meeting with the Department of Integregration was a “very positive one”.\n\n“We expressed that we needed actual dialogue. We need community groups to be listened to and heard, and more focus on how we can stop the protests, but also on how we can integrate people into our community,” they said.\n\n\"We're hoping to have one at least once a month, so hopefully we'll have some sort of plan going forward on how we can deal with everything that's going on.\n\n\"We're looking for actual, meaningful conversations with people sitting in a room together and pushing forward so the department can see what resources are actually needed in the area, but also so that people can express their views and get the actual facts and correct information.\"\n\nThey added that having grown up in the area their whole life, they believe that people in the area do want to help and support those moving in.\n\nThe councillors are standing together, across parties, working to facilitate these talks for the community.\n\nAnother councillor representing the area said that “nothing beats face-to-face communication” with local residents.\n\nThese opportunities for communication may come in the form of multiple town halls across different areas, giving everybody a chance to attend these meetings.\n\nDuring the meeting with the Department representatives, councillors from the area also addressed their demands that many of the issues and challenges experienced by the local community of Coolock need to be addressed as part of the process moving forward.\n\n“The North Central Area Committee councillors believe that it is only through dialogue and meaningful engagement that we can begin to move forward and bring an end to the disinformation, disruption, fear, and violence that has plagued the community over the last number of weeks,” the statement added.\n\n“Coolock is a wonderful place to live. It is a welcoming, friendly, and inclusive community for all, no matter who you are or where you come from, whether you have lived here all your life or only recently arrived.\n\n“We will play our part to ensure the local community is engaged with by the stakeholders and that facilitated dialogue begins in the coming weeks.”"
