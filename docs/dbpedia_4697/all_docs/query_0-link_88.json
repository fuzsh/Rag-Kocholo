He is a former member of Fianna Fail.\n\nAmongst other things…He promises\n\nNEVER\n\n• To accept so much as a single cent in “travel expenses”;\n\n• To hold “clinics”;\n\n• To attend a funeral save where the deceased was personally known to me;\n\nHis website\n\n(more…)\n\nFirstly many thanks to the sender. An ad for Labour candidate Phil Prendergast running in South Tipperary. Clonmel based Prendergast is tipped by many for a seat and has been active in the campaign to save Clonmel Hospital.\n\nFirst off many thanks to the sender who braved it to enter Matties ‘information centre’ to get the pics.\n\nMattie has left the green of Fianna Fail and gone the Blue and Gold of Tipp, the same colours used by Michael Lowry leaflets.\n\nMattie wants to save Clonmel hospital, has himself pictured with Brian Lenihan, Marie Hoctor and others.\n\nHopefully further Mattie stuff coming this way over the course of the campaign.\n\nNo word yet if Mattie has a campaign song to match his 2007 opus.\n\n(more…)\n\nMany thanks to the sender. A leaflet from Dr John Hillery running for Fianna Fail in Clare in the 2011 General Election. Hillery is a son of former president Patrick Hillery and also a cousin of former TD and senator Brian Hillery. (apologies for the size of the text)\n\n(more…)\n\nA flyer for the launch of the Campaign of Brian Greene running in Dublin North East under the United Left Alliance banner. The launch is taking place on the 3rd February and the speakers include Greene himself aswell as Clare Daly and Joan Collins.\n\nMany thanks to the sender\n\nJust sent this, I’m not sure if its a leaflet or not but either way its quick off the mark.\n\n“Sinn Fein will not be part of this grubby deal to get the Finance Bill passed” “Stop the Consensus For Cuts”\n\nA poster for Town Councillor Pat Kavanagh who is running for Fís Nua in Wicklow in the 2011 General Election. Kavanagh is one of a number of candidates being put forward by the new(ish) party.\n\nTheir website."
