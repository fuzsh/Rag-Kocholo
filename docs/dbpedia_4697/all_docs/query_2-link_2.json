They refused to attend the British House of Commons and instead assembled for the first time on 21 January 1919 in the Mansion House in Dublin as the revolutionary unicameral Dáil Éireann.\n\n1,292 TDs have served in the Dáil between 1919 and 2018. The title Father of the Dáil is usually and unofficially conferred on the longest-serving member.\n\nThis is a list of former TDs who have served at least 30 years in the Dáil. Unless otherwise specified, start and end dates given are those of the relevant general election. Unless stated, the TD listed did not stand in the end-date election.\n\nName Party Elected\n\nb – by-election Vacated seat Dáil Service Notes Paddy Smith Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin/ Fianna Fáil 1923 1977 53y 11m Cabinet minister Frank Aiken Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin/ Fianna Fáil 1923 1973 49y 6m Longest-serving cabinet minister (1932–1948, 1951–1954, 1957–1969) Neil Blaney Fianna Fáil/ Independent Fianna Fáil 1948 b Died on 8 November 1995 46y 11m Cabinet minister Thomas McEllistrim Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin/ Fianna Fáil 1923 1969 45y 10m Séamus Pattison Labour Party 1961 2007 45y 8m Ceann Comhairle (1997–2002) Seán MacEntee Sinn Féin/ Fianna Fáil 1918 1969 45y 6m Did not serve between the general elections of 1922 and June 1927 James Ryan Sinn Féin/ Fianna Fáil 1918 1965 45y 2m Long-serving cabinet minister.
