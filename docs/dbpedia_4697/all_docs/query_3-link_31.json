        "text": "Washington, D.C. â€“ Today, Congressman Brendan F. Boyle PA-02 along with U.S. Senators Bob Casey (PA) and John Fetterman (PA) announced that the Federal Highway Administration approved $3,000,000 in Emergency Relief for Federal-Aid Highways (ERFA) Quick Release funding to PennDOT for repairs associated with the I-95 collapse\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - Congressman Brendan F. Boyle (PA-02) released the following statement regarding U.S. House passage today of the Protecting the Right to Organize Act (PRO Act), legislation that he co-led to passage in the House, and legislation that is the most significant upgrade to U.S. labor law in 80 years\"....\n\nThe Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act would level the playing field and narrow the racial wealth gap by asking the wealthiest 100,000 households in America, or the top 0.05%, to pay their fair share. The Ultra-Millionaire Tax would bring in at least $3 trillion in revenue over 10 years - without raising taxes on the 99.95% of American households that have net worth below $50 million - according to a 2021 analysis from economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman from the University of California-Berkeley."
