        "text": "The Northern Ireland Assembly election is now over, and we now have the results. The number of seats by party (compared to the previous Assembly election in 2017) were:\n\nSinn Féin: 27 (-)\n\nDUP: 25 (-3)\n\nAlliance: 17 (+9)\n\nUUP: 9 (-1)\n\nSDLP: 8 (-4)\n\nIndependent: 2 (+1)\n\nTUV: 1 (-)\n\nPeople Before Profit: 1 (-)\n\nGreen: 0 (-2)\n\nThe vote percentage by party (compared to 2017) was:\n\nSinn Féin: 29.0% (+1.1%)\n\nDUP: 21.3% (-6.7%)\n\nAlliance: 13.5% (+4.5%)\n\nUUP: 11.2% (-1.7%)\n\nSDLP: 9.1% (-2.9%)\n\nTUV: 7.6% (+5.1%)\n\nGreen: 1.9% (-0.4%)\n\nAontú: 1.5% (+1.5%)\n\nPeople Before Profit: 1.1% (-0.6%)\n\nOthers: 3.7%\n\nOne interesting aspect to STV elections is that it is not a strictly proportional system, as you can see by a comparison between the percentage of votes and seats by party:\n\nSinn Féin: 29.0% votes, 30.0% seats\n\nDUP: 21.3% votes, 27.8% seats\n\nAlliance: 13.5% votes, 18.9% seats\n\nUUP: 11.2% votes, 10.0% seats\n\nSDLP: 9.1% votes, 8.9% seats\n\nTUV: 7.6% votes, 1.1% seats\n\nIndependent: 2.9% votes, 2.2% seats\n\nPeople Before Profit: 1.1% votes, 1.1% seats\n\nThe reason for this disproportionality, particularly for Alliance and the TUV, is because of a number of factors specific to STV voting. The most important relates to lower preference transfers, in preferential voting systems it helps to be more moderate and therefore receive a greater number of lower preference transfers from other parties. This is why Alliance did particularly well as they gained transfers from many other parties, while the TUV was unable to gain many transfers which cost them any gains. Alliance was also particularly strong in terms of vote management, in constituencies such as Belfast South the two candidates both received enough first preference votes to remain into the count until the end and gain another seat, as opposed to one candidate receiving almost all of their party’s vote and the other being excluded after being too far behind to catch up on transfers.\n\nIt is worth looking at this result by party and then by constituency, with some fun facts along the way:\n\nSinn Féin\n\nThis is Sinn Féin’s best ever Assembly election result, slightly up in terms of votes and defending all 27 of their seats, despite expectations their vote might be down. They also came close to another seat in Upper Bann, and relatively close in East Londonderry. Sinn Féin only has two new MLAs in the new Assembly, Danny Baker in Belfast West and Cathy Mason in South Down, succeeding Alex Maskey and Emma Rogan respectively. There are also ten MLAs who were co-opted during the term who have now won a seat for the first time, Colm Gildernew, Emma Sheerin, Maolíosa McHugh, Liz Kimmins, Deirdre Hargey, Nicola Brogan, Aine Murphy, Ciara Ferguson, Pádraig Delargy and Aisling Reilly. Gerry Kelly now becomes Sinn Féin’s longest serving MLA, the only one there since 1998, Conor Murphy has also been returned to every Assembly since 1998 although he was not an MLA from 2012 to 2015. Sinn Féin has one seat in five constituencies, two seats in three constituencies, three seats in four constituencies and four seats in one constituency. Sinn Féin was the largest party in terms of first preference votes in nine constituencies, including their seven Westminster seats plus narrowly in Upper Bann and Foyle. Their vote was up in eleven constituencies, down in six and the same in one. The highest growth was Belfast North followed by South Down, their lowest drop was Newry and Armagh followed by West Tyrone.\n\nBelfast West: 63.7% (+1.9%)\n\nMid Ulster: 52.7% (-)\n\nNewry and Armagh: 47.0% (-1.3%)\n\nWest Tyrone: 47.0% (-1.1%)\n\nFermanagh and South Tyrone: 44.7% (+2.6%)\n\nSouth Down: 44.3% (+5.7%)\n\nBelfast North: 35.5% (+6.1%)\n\nFoyle: 32.8% (-3.8%)\n\nUpper Bann: 29.4% (+1.6%)\n\nEast Londonderry: 25.6% (-0.2%)\n\nBelfast South: 20.3% (+2.6%)\n\nSouth Antrim: 20.1% (+3.8%)\n\nNorth Antrim: 18.5% (+2.7%)\n\nEast Antrim: 9.1% (-0.8%)\n\nLagan Valley: 5.3% (+1.3%)\n\nStrangford: 3.9% (+1.1%)\n\nBelfast East: 3.2% (+1.7%)\n\nNorth Down: 1.6% (-0.1%)\n\nDUP\n\nThis is the DUP’s worst Assembly election result since 1998, and the first since 2003 in which the DUP was not the largest party in terms of both votes and seats. Despite losing more than 20% of their vote, the DUP only lost three seats, just over 10%, this was because the TUV failed to gain any seats and their transfers saved the DUP candidates in several constituencies. Instead the DUP lost two incumbents to Alliance, Mervyn Storey in North Antrim and Peter Weir in Strangford, both are former Ministers and had been MLAs since 2003 and 1998 respectively; they also lost a seat in North Down to former DUP MLA Alex Easton who held his seat as an independent. There are five new DUP MLAs who held seats from retiring colleagues, in Belfast North Phillip Brett and Brian Kingston held the two seats previously held by Paula Bradley and William Humphrey, in Belfast East David Brooks succeeded Robin Newton, in East Londonderry Alan Robinson succeeded his father Alan Robinson, and in South Down Diane Forsythe succeeded Jim Wells, who left the DUP following Forsythe’s selection and endorsed the TUV, which did not help the TUV in this case. DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson returns to the Assembly having left in 2010, succeeding Paul Rankin who was an MLA for just 14 days, but will he remain an MLA or stay as an MP? He’s got several days to decide. Another five DUP MLAs who were co-opted during the term held their seats, Trevor Clarke, Harry Harvey, Diane Dodds, Stephen Dunne and Deborah Erskine, and Edwin Poots defended the DUP’s Belfast South seat following the sad passing of Christopher Stalford in February. Poots and David Hilditch are the only DUP MLAs who have been returned in every Assembly election since 1998, while Tom Buchanan is the third longest serving DUP MLA since 2003. The DUP has two seats in nine constituencies and one seat in eight constituencies. The DUP was the largest party in six constituencies, all of which are constituencies with a DUP MP, although Sinn Féin was ahead in Upper Bann and Alliance was ahead in Belfast East. The DUP vote was down everywhere, especially in North Down, North Antrim and Fermanagh and South Tyrone, and only very slightly in Belfast West.\n\nStrangford: 35.8% (-4.2%)\n\nLagan Valley: 34.7% (-6.6%)\n\nBelfast East: 32.1% (-5.5%)\n\nEast Antrim: 29.6% (-5.6%)\n\nUpper Bann: 27.5% (-5.3%)\n\nEast Londonderry: 26.9% (-6.6%)\n\nSouth Antrim: 25.9% (-7.8%)\n\nNorth Antrim: 25.7% (-15.0%)\n\nBelfast North: 24.3% (-7.8%)\n\nNorth Down: 19.9% (-17.6%)\n\nFermanagh and South Tyrone: 17.7% (-12.1%)\n\nMid Ulster: 16.5% (-2.8%)\n\nBelfast South: 15.4% (-5.5%)\n\nWest Tyrone: 14.4% (-6.0%)\n\nNewry and Armagh: 12.9% (-4.9%)\n\nSouth Down: 11.8% (-3.9%)\n\nBelfast West: 9.5% (-0.5%)\n\nFoyle: 8.8% (-4.6%)\n\nAlliance\n\nThis is Alliance’s best ever Assembly election result, the first in which Alliance was in third place, over 10% and over 100,000 votes. 17 is the highest number of seats Alliance has ever had, until now the previous record was 10 in 1982. Alliance’s transfer friendliness and strong vote management ensured Alliance gained nine seats in addition to their outgoing eight, and won almost every marginal seat apart from East Londonderry. The four outgoing Alliance MLAs elected in 2017 were re-elected, Naomi Long in Belfast East, Stewart Dickson in East Antrim, Paula Bradshaw in Belfast South and Kellie Armstrong in Strangford, while the other two outgoing MLAs who were co-opted during the term were also re-elected, John Blair in South Antrim and Andrew Muir in North Down. Two new Alliance MLAs held seats held by former MLAs not running again, Peter McReynolds succeeded Chris Lyttle in Belfast East, and Sorcha Eastwood succeeded Trevor Lunn in Lagan Valley. Of the other seven new Alliance MLAs, four gained from the SDLP (Nuala McAllister in Belfast North, Patrick Brown in South Down, Eóin Tennyson in Upper Bann and David Honeyford in Lagan Valley), two gained from the DUP (Nick Mathison in Strangford and Patricia O’Lynn in North Antrim), two gained from the Greens (Kate Nicholl in Belfast South and Connie Egan in North Down) and one gained from the UUP (Danny Donnelly in East Antrim). Naomi Long is now the party’s longest serving MLA, however since she spent time as both an MP and MEP, Stewart Dickson is the party’s longest continuously serving MLA, and he has by far the longest political career of any MLA, as a councillor from 1977 to 1981 and 1985 to 2011, and an MLA since then. Alliance has two seats in six constituencies and one seat in five constituencies. This is the first time since 1982-86 that North Belfast, Ballymena, Ballymoney and Ballycastle will have an Alliance MLA, the first time since 1982-86 that Holywood, Bangor, Newtownards, Comber and Lisburn will have two Alliance MLAs, the first time since the 1975 Constitutional Convention that Alliance has two seats in South Belfast in any regional Northern Ireland institution, and the first time ever that Downpatrick, Newcastle, Warrenpoint, Lurgan, Portadown and Banbridge will have an Alliance MLA. Alliance was the largest party in three constituencies, Belfast East, Belfast South and North Down. The Alliance vote increased in every constituency, especially in Lagan Valley, North Down and Strangford, and least of all in Belfast West.\n\nBelfast East: 32.4% (+1.0%)\n\nNorth Down: 28.9% (+10.3%)\n\nBelfast South: 24.9% (+7.2%)\n\nLagan Valley: 24.3% (+10.7%)\n\nStrangford: 24.1% (+9.1%)\n\nEast Antrim: 23.1% (+7.1%)\n\nSouth Antrim: 16.0% (+3.5%)\n\nSouth Down: 12.6% (+3.5%)\n\nUpper Bann: 11.5% (+6.2%)\n\nBelfast North: 9.5% (+1.1%)\n\nNorth Antrim: 9.5% (+4.1%)\n\nEast Londonderry: 7.5% (+3.1%)\n\nWest Tyrone: 6.5% (+3.6%)\n\nNewry and Armagh: 5.7% (+3.1%)\n\nFermanagh and South Tyrone: 4.8% (+2.1%)\n\nFoyle: 4.7% (+2.2%)\n\nMid Ulster: 4.1% (+2.1%)\n\nBelfast West: 2.1% (+0.2%)\n\nUUP\n\nThis is the UUP’s worst ever Assembly election result. However, there is very little change for the UUP in terms of seats, they only lost one seat from ten to nine, and will qualify for one Minister under d’Hondt as before. Of the ten outgoing MLAs, eight were re-elected, while Roy Beggs Jr lost his seat to Alliance in East Antrim, and Rosemary Barton lost out to her running mate Tom Elliott, meaning that the UUP Assembly team will be 100% male. Of the nine UUP MLAs, five of them have served as party leader (Tom Elliott, Mike Nesbitt, Robin Swann, Steve Aiken and Doug Beattie). The only seat the UUP nearly gained was in Foyle, a constituency which has never elected a UUP MLA even in 1998 when they were the largest party, however Ryan McCready was not able to gain enough transfers to overtake the DUP despite a significant increase in the UUP’s first preference vote too. Robin Swann also had a very good result, topping the poll in North Antrim, very different from 2017 when he looked seriously at risk for much of the count. Tom Elliott becomes the longest serving UUP MLA, as he was previously an MLA from 2003 to 2015, however the longest continuously serving UUP MLAs, are Robin Swann and Mike Nesbitt since 2011. The UUP has one seat in nine constituencies, and for the first time there are no constituencies with multiple UUP MLAs. The UUP vote was up in five constituencies, most notably in North Antrim and Fermanagh and South Tyrone, it was down in thirteen, most notably North Down, Newry and Armagh and Lagan Valley.\n\nEast Antrim: 24.2% (+1.5%)\n\nNorth Antrim: 20.5% (+8.0%)\n\nLagan Valley: 19.3% (-5.9%)\n\nSouth Antrim: 17.9% (-2.9%)\n\nFermanagh and South Tyrone: 15.5% (+3.9%)\n\nUpper Bann: 15.3% (-5.3%)\n\nStrangford: 15.2% (-4.8%)\n\nBelfast East: 15.2% (+2.1%)\n\nNorth Down: 12.4% (-9.1%)\n\nFoyle: 8.0% (+4.3%)\n\nNewry and Armagh: 6.6% (-6.7%)\n\nBelfast South: 6.5% (-2.5%)\n\nEast Londonderry: 5.9% (-0.8%)\n\nBelfast North: 5.7% (-0.1%)\n\nSouth Down: 5.2% (-3.2%)\n\nMid Ulster: 4.2% (-4.9%)\n\nWest Tyrone: 4.1% (-4.2%)\n\nBelfast West: 1.1% (-0.1%)\n\nSDLP\n\nThis is the SDLP’s worst ever Assembly election result, the first time that they have finished fifth in terms of both votes and seats, and the first election in which the SDLP vote was below 10%. The loss of four seats has cost the SDLP a ministerial position through d’Hondt. All of the SDLP MLAs elected are outgoing MLAs, with Matthew O’Toole, Sinéad McLaughlin and Cara Hunter all elected for the first time to the Assembly as they were co-opted during the term. Three SDLP incumbents lost to Alliance, Nichola Mallon in Belfast North, Pat Catney in Lagan Valley and Dolores Kelly in Upper Bann, while the SDLP also lost their second seat in South Down to Alliance, held until now by Sinéad Bradley who was not running again. Patsy McGlone remains the longest serving SDLP MLA, since 2003, Mark H. Durkan comes second since 2011. The SDLP has two seats in one constituency (Foyle) and one seat in six constituencies. The SDLP vote was up in one constituency (Belfast East and East Londonderry) and down in the other seventeen, most notably in South Down and Newry and Armagh.\n\nFoyle: 30.9% (-0.9%)\n\nSouth Down: 16.5% (-8.6%)\n\nBelfast South: 15.8% (-3.6%)\n\nWest Tyrone: 11.9% (-2.3%)\n\nNewry and Armagh: 10.6% (-5.8%)\n\nMid Ulster: 10.0% (-3.0%)\n\nEast Londonderry: 8.3% (+0.3%)\n\nBelfast North: 7.8% (-5.3%)\n\nFermanagh and South Tyrone: 7.1% (-2.7%)\n\nSouth Antrim: 6.9% (-2.6%)\n\nUpper Bann: 6.5% (-3.4%)\n\nLagan Valley: 6.3% (-2.1%)\n\nStrangford: 6.0% (-1.9%)\n\nBelfast West: 5.8% (-2.8%)\n\nNorth Antrim: 3.8% (-3.5%)\n\nEast Antrim: 3.0% (-1.1%)\n\nNorth Down: 1.7% (-0.1%)\n\nBelfast East: 1.1% (+0.5%)\n\nOther Parties and Independents\n\nThe TUV vote tripled compared to the last Assembly election, however they did not gain any seats, Jim Allister remains their only MLA. Despite this, five TUV candidates finished as the runner up, in Strangford and East Antrim which were two of their key target seats, but more surprisingly in majority nationalist constituencies like Mid Ulster, Newry and Armagh and West Tyrone. In some constituencies the TUV narrowly missed out on challenging a DUP candidate and their transfers saved the DUP candidates, such as in Belfast North and South Antrim.\n\nPeople Before Profit lost nearly a third of their vote, and Gerry Carroll’s vote halved in Belfast West, however he held his seat becoming the only ‘other’ MLA who isn’t Alliance.\n\nThe Greens lost both of their seats, one of the main surprises of the election. Both Clare Bailey in Belfast South and Rachel Woods in North Down lost to Alliance, until now the Greens had held a seat in North Down since 2007 and in Belfast South since 2016.\n\nAontú had a decent vote share for their first Assembly election, even if they did not come close to winning any seats. Other parties made almost no impact, such as the PUP, IRSP and Workers’ Party, and the Conservative Party (one of the oldest and arguably most electorally successful parties in world history) received 0.029% of the total vote, although to be fair they only had one candidate.\n\nTwo independent MLAs were elected, both designated unionists. Claire Sugden in East Londonderry becomes the first person to be elected as an independent MLA three times, while Alex Easton becomes only the second MLA since 1998 to leave their party and defend their seat against that party, the first was Sugden’s predecessor David McClarty in 2011 who left the UUP. Easton’s 9,568 votes is the highest ever vote for an independent in a Northern Ireland Assembly election, until now that record was held by Anne Dickson who received 9,033 votes in South Antrim in 1973.\n\nSo what about the constituencies? Here is a look at each constituency, the first preference votes for each (with the successful candidates in bold) plus some analysis for each and some fun facts:\n\nBelfast East\n\nNaomi Long (Alliance): 8,195\n\nJoanne Bunting (DUP): 7,253\n\nDavid Brooks (DUP): 6,633\n\nPeter McReynolds (Alliance): 5,820\n\nAndy Allen (UUP): 5,281\n\nJohn Ross (TUV): 3,087\n\nBrian Smyth (Green): 2,302\n\nMairéad O’Donnell (Sinn Féin): 1,369\n\nLauren Kerr (UUP): 1,282\n\nKarl Bennett (PUP): 970\n\nHannah Kenny (People Before Profit): 500\n\nCharlotte Carson (SDLP): 484\n\nEoin MacNeill (Workers’ Party): 72\n\nAlliance emerged as the largest party in East Belfast for only the second time ever, the first being the 2010 Westminster election. This is the highest ever Alliance percentage vote in an Assembly election, and the lowest DUP vote since 1998, it is also the best UUP result since 2007 and the worst result ever for the PUP. Naomi Long and Joanne Bunting were both elected on stage one over the quota, beyond that the remaining seats followed the first preferences. Peter McReynolds took the first seat on stage nine, while David Brooks took the fourth seat and Andy Allen the fifth seat on stage eleven, with Allen finishing 3,988.96 votes ahead of Brian Smyth, making this the most decisive result in the election. Smyth had overtaken John Ross in stage ten through Sinn Féin and Alliance transfers.\n\nBelfast North\n\nGerry Kelly (Sinn Féin): 8,395\n\nCarál Ní Chuilín (Sinn Féin): 7,932\n\nPhillip Brett (DUP): 6,329\n\nBrian Kingston (DUP): 4,844\n\nNuala McAllister (Alliance): 4,381\n\nNichola Mallon (SDLP): 3,604\n\nRon McDowell (TUV): 3,335\n\nJulie-Anne Corr-Johnston (UUP): 2,643\n\nMal O’Hara (Green): 1,446\n\nFiona Ferguson (People Before Profit): 1,059\n\nBilly Hutchinson (PUP): 762\n\nSeán Mac Niocaill (Aontú): 640\n\nStafford Ward (Independent): 489\n\nLily Kerr (Workers’ Party): 168\n\nSinn Féin came on top in terms of first preference votes in North Belfast for only the second time in an Assembly election, the first was surprisingly 1998 in which Sinn Féin was just eleven votes ahead of the DUP. This is the highest ever Sinn Féin percentage vote in an Assembly election, and the lowest for the DUP since 1998, it is also the highest ever Alliance vote and the lowest ever SDLP vote. This time was more decisive, Sinn Féin comfortably had two quotas and both Gerry Kelly and Carál Ní Chuilín were elected on stage one, while the DUP saw a significant drop in their vote but managed to defend their two seats despite Phillip Brett and Brian Kingston being new Assembly candidates. Brett was elected on stage ten through UUP transfers, and Kingston was elected in stage eleven through TUV transfers. The main change here was Nuala McAllister gaining a seat for Alliance, at the expense of the SDLP’s deputy leader Nichola Mallon. McAllister started 777 votes ahead of Mallon and finished 991.21 votes ahead. The Sinn Féin surpluses initially favoured Mallon over McAllister (56% and 54% compared to 17% and 14% respectively) as did Aontú transfers (28% SDLP and 7% Alliance) and PBP transfers (26% SDLP and 15% Alliance), however Green transfers helped McAllister more (44% Alliance and 28% SDLP), followed by UUP transfers (21% Alliance and 5% SDLP) and finally TUV transfers (5% Alliance and 2% SDLP). The result of this was the first Assembly election since 1982 in which North Belfast elected an Alliance MLA, and the first time ever that North Belfast did not elect an SDLP MLA.\n\nBelfast South\n\nDeirdre Hargey (Sinn Féin): 9,511\n\nEdwin Poots (DUP): 7,211\n\nPaula Bradshaw (Alliance): 6,503\n\nMatthew O’Toole (SDLP): 5,394\n\nKate Nicholl (Alliance): 5,201\n\nClare Bailey (Green): 4,058\n\nStephen McCarthy (UUP): 3,061\n\nElsie Trainor (SDLP): 2,030\n\nAndrew Girvin (TUV): 1,935\n\nLuke McCann (Aontú): 806\n\nSipho Sibanda (People Before Profit): 629\n\nNeil Moore (Socialist Party): 353\n\nPaddy Lynn (Workers’ Party): 139\n\nElly Odhiambo (Independent): 107\n\nAlliance emerged as the largest party in South Belfast for the first time ever in an Assembly election, while Sinn Féin outpolled both the SDLP and DUP for the first time. This is the highest Alliance percentage vote since the 1986 by-election, the highest ever Sinn Féin vote, the lowest SDLP vote since 1987, and the lowest DUP vote since 1998. Deirdre Hargey took the first seat with a surplus of 1,687, which transferred 50% to SDLP, 24% to Alliance and 10% to the Greens. Edwin Poots took the second seat in stage five through TUV transfers, which went 57% DUP and 32% UUP, then Matthew O’Toole took the third seat in stage six after receiving 69% of transfers from his running mate Elsie Trainor. Paula Bradshaw was then elected in stage seven after Alliance received 52% of UUP transfers, compared to 16% to the Greens, and finally on stage eight after Edwin Poots’s surplus was redistributed, the final seat went to Kate Nicholl who gained a second seat for Alliance, while Green Party leader Clare Bailey lost out as a result. Nicholl started 1,143 votes ahead of Bailey and finished 911 votes ahead, this lead would probably have been larger had Bradshaw’s and O’Toole’s surpluses been redistributed. This is the second time ever that Alliance has won two seats in a regional election, the first was Basil Glass and Jim Hendron in the 1975 Constitutional Convention, however unlike 1975 Alliance’s vote management was particularly well done here and crucial to their success.\n\nBelfast West\n\nDanny Baker (Sinn Féin): 9,011\n\nÓrlaithí Flynn (Sinn Féin): 6,743\n\nPat Sheehan (Sinn Féin): 6,370\n\nAisling Reilly (Sinn Féin): 5,681\n\nFrank McCoubrey (DUP): 4,166\n\nGerry Carroll (People Before Profit): 3,279\n\nPaul Doherty (SDLP): 2,528\n\nGerard Herdman (Aontú): 1,753\n\nDan Murphy (IRSP): 1,103\n\nDonnamarie Higgins (Alliance): 907\n\nJordan Doran (TUV): 802\n\nLinsey Gibson (UUP): 474\n\nStevie Maginn (Green): 307\n\nPatrick Crossan (Workers’ Party): 193\n\nGerard Burns (Independent): 192\n\nTony Mallon (Independent): 129\n\nDeclan Hill (Independent): 26\n\nSinn Féin remains comfortably the largest party in West Belfast, as they have been in every election since 1996. This is the highest Sinn Féin percentage vote in an Assembly election since 2011 and the lowest PBP vote since 2011, it is also the lowest SDLP vote ever. Danny Baker was elected on stage one, and his three Sinn Féin colleagues followed later in the count, Órlaithí Flynn on stage ten and Aisling Reilly and Pat Sheehan both on stage eleven. Despite a significant drop in the PBP vote, Gerry Carroll held his seat and became the only ‘other’ MLA returned outside of Alliance. Frank McCoubrey remained ahead of Carroll right up until stage eleven when Paul Doherty’s transfers brought Carroll ahead, Carroll started 887 votes behind McCoubrey but finished 532.9 votes ahead, there were two Sinn Féin surpluses which could have expanded Carroll’s lead by a few hundred more.\n\nEast Antrim\n\nGordon Lyons (DUP): 6,256\n\nJohn Stewart (UUP): 6,195\n\nDavid Hilditch (DUP): 5,662\n\nStewart Dickson (Alliance): 5,059\n\nDanny Donnelly (Alliance): 4,224\n\nOliver McMullan (Sinn Féin): 3,675\n\nNorman Boyd (TUV): 3,661\n\nRoy Beggs Jr (UUP): 3,549\n\nSiobhán McAlister (SDLP): 1,200\n\nMark Bailey (Green): 754\n\nThe DUP remains the largest party in East Antrim, but this was their lowest Assembly percentage vote since 1998. This was also Alliance’s highest ever percentage vote in an Assembly election, and the UUP’s highest vote since 2003. Although the UUP narrowly polled ahead of Alliance in terms of first preference votes, Alliance gained a second seat from the UUP through their greater transfer friendliness and much better vote management. Roy Beggs Jr was excluded in stage three, his transfers elected John Stewart who had nearly twice as many first preference votes. Stewart’s surplus then elected Gordon Lyons in stage four, and in stage five Stewart Dickson and Danny Donnelly were both elected after receiving 63% of Sinn Féin transfers, 43% to Donnelly and 20% to Dickson, which brought both over the quota. David Hilditch took the final seat, 2,076.4 votes ahead of Norman Boyd. Both Boyd and Oliver McMullan are former MLAs, meaning that eight of the ten East Antrim Assembly candidates have served as MLAs at some point.\n\nEast Londonderry\n\nCaoimhe Archibald (Sinn Féin): 6,868\n\nMaurice Bradley (DUP): 6,786\n\nAlan Robinson (DUP): 5,151\n\nKathleen McGurk (Sinn Féin): 4,500\n\nClaire Sugden (Independent): 3,981\n\nCara Hunter (SDLP): 3,664\n\nChris McCaw (Alliance): 3,338\n\nJordan Armstrong (TUV): 2,959\n\nDarryl Wilson (UUP): 2,625\n\nStephanie Quigley (Independent): 1,503\n\nGemma Brolly (Aontú): 1,095\n\nRussell Watton (PUP): 933\n\nMark Coulson (Green): 347\n\nAmy Merron (People Before Profit): 347\n\nNiall Murphy (Independent): 181\n\nBilly Stewart (Independent): 82\n\nThe DUP is once again the largest party in East Londonderry, but this was their lowest percentage vote since 1998. This was Sinn Féin’s second highest percentage vote after 2017, and the SDLP’s second lowest after 2017, this was also Alliance’s best ever percentage vote. The first two seats went to the DUP, Maurice Bradley was elected first in stage six through transfers from former SDLP councillor Stephanie Quigley, and Alan Robinson was elected in stage eight through TUV transfers. Caoimhe Archibald topped the poll but had to wait until stage ten to gain the fourth seat. The really interesting race for the other two seats was between Kathleen McGurk, Claire Sugden, Cara Hunter and Chris McCaw, who started in that order. Sugden overtook McGurk through Quigley’s transfers in stage six, she received 42% of those, then in stage seven she was the main beneficiary of UUP transfers (32% Sugden, 28% DUP, 16% TUV, 14% Alliance, 4% SDLP and 0.1% Sinn Féin). In stage eight TUV transfers went 56% DUP, 21% Sugden, 4% Alliance, 2% SDLP and 0.05% Sinn Féin. At this point Hunter had 4,478 votes and McCaw 4,408, and after Robinson’s surplus was redistributed (which went 85% Sugden, 11% Alliance, 4% SDLP and 0% Sinn Féin), Hunter had 4,513.2 votes and McCaw 4,498.64. McCaw was excluded at this point, just 14.56 votes behind Hunter, and his transfers (44% SDLP, 26% Sugden and 7% Sinn Féin) brought Hunter decisively ahead of McGurk, Sugden won the third seat, Archibald the fourth and Hunter the fifth, with Hunter 1,666.56 votes ahead of McGurk, with more than a thousand Sugden surplus votes that would have most likely benefitted Hunter. Like in 2017 the SDLP made an impressive comeback from a low point in first preference votes, and this was the only marginal seat for Alliance that did not gain through transfers despite a very good result from Chris McCaw in an area where Alliance has never been close to an Assembly seat.\n\nFermanagh and South Tyrone\n\nJemma Dolan (Sinn Féin): 9,067\n\nColm Gildernew (Sinn Féin): 7,562\n\nAine Murphy (Sinn Féin): 7,379\n\nTom Elliott (UUP): 5,442\n\nDeborah Erskine (DUP): 5,272\n\nPaul Bell (DUP): 4,255\n\nAdam Gannon (SDLP): 3,836\n\nAlex Elliott (TUV): 3,091\n\nRosemary Barton (UUP): 2,912\n\nMatthew Beaumont (Alliance): 2,583\n\nDenise Mullen (Aontú): 927\n\nDonal O’Cofaigh (Labour Alternative): 602\n\nKellie Turtle (Green): 335\n\nEmma DeSouza (Independent): 249\n\nDerek Backhouse (Independent): 128\n\nEmmett Kilpatrick (People Before Profit): 103\n\nSinn Féin came out on top in terms of first preference votes, with their highest ever percentage vote in an Assembly election. This was the third time that Sinn Féin has gained three seats in FST, but in 2011 and 2017 this was by 61.98 and 62 votes respectively, this time when Adam Gannon was excluded in stage seven Aine Murphy was 1,787.56 votes ahead, she was elected on stage eight along with Colm Gildernew, Jemma Dolan had already been elected on stage one having topped the poll. This was the DUP’s lowest Assembly percentage vote since 1998, the UUP’s highest since 2011, and the SDLP’s lowest ever. The UUP’s vote increase was helped by the return of Tom Elliott, former MLA, MP and party leader, though his election came at the expense of outgoing MLA Rosemary Barton, resulting in the loss of the UUP’s only female MLA. Elliott was elected on stage six following the exclusion of his cousin and TUV candidate Alex Elliott. The huge drop in the DUP vote was a consequence of the absence of both Arlene Foster and Maurice Morrow from the ballot for the first time in decades, but even so they held a seat, with Deborah Erskine taking the final seat 508.12 votes ahead of her running mate Paul Bell.\n\nFoyle\n\nPádraig Delargy (Sinn Féin): 9,471\n\nMark H. Durkan (SDLP): 7,999\n\nCiara Ferguson (Sinn Féin): 5,913\n\nGary Middleton (DUP): 4,101\n\nRyan McCready (UUP): 3,744\n\nBrian Tierney (SDLP): 3,272\n\nSinéad McLaughlin (SDLP): 3,189\n\nShaun Harkin (People Before Profit): 2,621\n\nRachael Ferguson (Alliance): 2,220\n\nEmmet Doyle (Aontú): 2,000\n\nAnne McCloskey (Independent Nationalist): 854\n\nColly McLaughlin (IRSP): 766\n\nElizabeth Neely (TUV): 499\n\nGillian Hamilton (Green): 215\n\nThe longest and slowest count in this election. Sinn Féin narrowly outpolled the SDLP in first preference votes to remain the largest party in Foyle in terms of first preference votes for the second time after 2017. This is Sinn Féin’s third best Assembly percentage result, after 2017 and 2011, while it was the SDLP’s second worst after 2016, it was also the DUP’s worst result and the UUP’s best since 2003. Pádraig Delargy and Mark H. Durkan were both elected on stage one, and Ciara Ferguson followed on stage nine but was never at risk. The second SDLP seat was extremely close between Brian Tierney and Sinéad McLaughlin, Tierney started 83 votes ahead, in stage two he was 42.88 votes ahead and in stage three 37.71 ahead. In stage four McLaughlin pulled ahead by 25.05 votes, and in stage six she remained 26.03 ahead. But in stage six Tierney regained a lead by 3.19 votes, which narrowed to 0.87 votes in stage seven. In stage eight Alliance transfers brought McLaughlin decisively ahead by 526.42 votes, and in stage nine Aontú transfers brought Shaun Harkin 60.28 votes ahead, and Ciara Ferguson’s surplus in stage ten was not enough to save Tierney, therefore he was excluded in stage eleven, with McLaughlin being elected on stage twelve through PBP transfers. The other fascinating battle was for the unionist seat, with DUP Junior Minister Gary Middleton nearly losing to UUP candidate Ryan McCready, who was originally a DUP councillor. Middleton started 357 votes ahead, by stage five TUV transfers had expanded that lead to 442.88 votes, TUV transfers went 56% DUP and 39% UUP. McCready’s best hope to catch up was Alliance transfers, but he only received 12% of Rachael Ferguson’s transfers while Middleton gained 2%, this narrowed the gap to 234.54 votes. Then in stage nine Aontú transfers went 7% DUP and 1% UUP, expanding Middleton’s lead to 372.03 votes. By stage twelve after PBP transfers Middleton was 197.39 votes ahead, and McCready still had a chance through McLaughlin’s surplus of 794.45, but since this only transferred 15% UUP and 2% DUP Middleton won the final seat by 95.39 votes. It’s probably fair to say that McCready could have gained this seat had he gained more Alliance, PBP and SDLP transfers, but in terms of those who definitely transferred it was the 176.04 Aontú transfers to the DUP that saved Middleton.\n\nLagan Valley\n\nJeffrey Donaldson (DUP): 12,626\n\nRobbie Butler (UUP): 8,242\n\nSorcha Eastwood (Alliance): 8,211\n\nPaul Givan (DUP): 5,062\n\nDavid Honeyford (Alliance): 4,183\n\nLorna Smyth (TUV): 3,488\n\nPat Catney (SDLP): 3,235\n\nGary McCleave (Sinn Féin): 2,725\n\nLaura Turner (UUP): 1,607\n\nGary Hynds (Independent): 735\n\nSimon Lee (Green): 648\n\nAmanda Doherty (People Before Profit): 271\n\nThe DUP topped the poll in terms of first preference votes, but this is their worst Assembly percentage vote since 2003, it is also Alliance’s highest ever result and the UUP’s second lowest after 2007. DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson topped the poll with the second highest vote of any candidate in the entire election, while former First Minister had to wait until stage four to get over the quota in fourth place. UUP deputy leader Robbie Butler took the second seat from Donaldson’s surplus, and Sorcha Eastwood took the third seat on stage four just ahead of Givan. It was expected the final seat would be between incumbent Pat Catney and David Honeyford, this was the first time that Alliance ran two candidates here. Honeyford started 948 votes ahead of Catney, with Lorna Smyth in between, by stage five Honeyford was 1,425.28 votes ahead of Catney. In stage six Sinn Féin transfers were redistributed, they went 65% to Catney and 22% to Honeyford, not enough to bring Catney ahead, by this point Honeyford’s lead was 204.96 votes ahead. In stage seven TUV transfers expanded Honeyford’s final lead to 643.56 votes.\n\nMid Ulster\n\nMichelle O’Neill (Sinn Féin): 10,845\n\nKeith Buchanan (DUP): 8,521\n\nEmma Sheerin (Sinn Féin): 8,215\n\nLinda Dillon (Sinn Féin): 8,199\n\nPatsy McGlone (SDLP): 5,144\n\nGlenn Moore (TUV): 3,818\n\nMeta Graham (UUP): 2,191\n\nClaire Hackett (Alliance): 2,138\n\nAlixandra Halliday (Aontú): 1,305\n\nPatrick Haughey (Independent): 877\n\nSophia McFeely (People Before Profit): 179\n\nStefan Taylor (Green): 137\n\nHugh Scullion (Workers’ Party): 107\n\nConor Rafferty (Resume NI): 13\n\nSinn Féin remains the largest party here in their second strongest constituency, they have consistently held three seats here since 1998. Their percentage vote was exactly the same as in 2017, their best ever in an Assembly election. This was also the DUP’s worst Assembly percentage vote since 1975, and the SDLP’s worst ever. Sinn Féin’s Stormont leader Michelle O’Neill topped the poll and her surplus immediately elected Linda Dillon and Emma Sheerin in stage two. Keith Buchanan started just 94 votes away from the quota, but had to wait until stage six, when he was elected through Aontú transfers. Patsy McGlone gained the final seat, he was 1,326 votes ahead of Glenn Moore on first preferences, and was significantly more transfer friendly. On stage seven McGlone was 1,829 votes ahead after UUP transfers, and on stage eight Alliance transfers gave him a final lead of 3,446 votes. The five seats were relatively clear, but the substantial TUV vote is notable, especially as they had nearly twice as many votes as the UUP who held a seat here until 2017. Also a good result for Claire Hackett in her first election, finishing with 3,181 votes ahead of the UUP, Alliance’s best result in Mid Ulster since 1982.\n\nNewry and Armagh\n\nConor Murphy (Sinn Féin): 9,847\n\nCathal Boylan (Sinn Féin): 9,843\n\nLiz Kimmins (Sinn Féin): 7,964\n\nWilliam Irwin (DUP): 7,577\n\nJustin McNulty (SDLP): 6,217\n\nKeith Ratcliffe (TUV): 5,407\n\nDavid Taylor (UUP): 3,864\n\nJackie Coade (Alliance): 3,345\n\nGavin Malone (Independent): 3,157\n\nDaniel Connolly (Aontú): 1,189\n\nCiara Henry (Green): 314\n\nNicola Grant (Workers’ Party): 160\n\nAnother constituency where Sinn Féin is decisively the largest party, this was Sinn Féin’s second highest Assembly percentage vote after 2017. It was also the DUP’s and SDLP’s lowest ever Assembly percentage vote. Conor Murphy and Cathal Boylan were both elected on stage one, the other three candidates followed on stage five. After the three bottom candidates were excluded, independent Newry councillor Gavin Malone was excluded (the only independent to keep his deposit apart from the two who were elected). Malone’s transfers (38% Sinn Féin, 27% SDLP, 13% Alliance, 2% UUP, 2% DUP and 1% TUV) brought Jackie Coade ahead of David Taylor, in stage four Taylor’s transfers (43% DUP, 31% TUV, 17% Alliance and 0.2% Sinn Féin) kept William Irwin safely ahead of Keith Ratcliffe, and on stage five Coade’s transfers (54% SDLP, 10% Sinn Féin, 8% DUP and 4% TUV) elected Justin McNulty third, Liz Kimmins fourth and William Irwin fifth, 2,892 votes ahead of Ratcliffe. This was a very good result for Coade, Alliance’s best ever result in the constituency, and the strong TUV vote is genuinely remarkable in a constituency they didn’t even contest in 2017.\n\nNorth Antrim\n\nRobin Swann (UUP): 9,530\n\nPhilip McGuigan (Sinn Féin): 9,348\n\nJim Allister (TUV): 8,282\n\nMervyn Storey (DUP): 6,747\n\nPaul Frew (DUP): 6,242\n\nPatricia O’Lynn (Alliance): 4,810\n\nMatthew Armstrong (TUV): 2,481\n\nEugene Reid (SDLP): 1,919\n\nBethany Ferris (UUP): 856\n\nPaul Veronica (Green): 343\n\nLaird Shingleton (Independent): 66\n\nLast time South Belfast was the only constituency to elect five MLAs from five different parties, this time it is North Antrim. This was the DUP’s worst ever result ever in North Antrim, the constituency they and the Paisley family have held in Westminster for their entire history. The TUV had their highest ever Assembly percentage vote, and the UUP had their highest vote since 1982, Sinn Féin and their highest ever vote while Alliance had their highest since 1975 when the constituency included most of East Antrim too. Health Minister Robin Swann and Philip McGuigan were elected on stage one, Jim Allister followed on stage five following the transfers of Bethany Ferris. But the huge surprise here was in stage six. Patricia O’Lynn started 1,917 votes behind Mervyn Storey and 1,432 behind Paul Frew. Many expected through the first preference votes that the two DUP incumbents were safe, with Frew maybe at risk but probably not. But the final stage was a double exclusion of Matthew Armstrong and Eugene Reid. Before this transfer Storey had 7,086.42 votes, Frew 6,559.22 and O’Lynn 5,797.49. O’Lynn received 41% of the Armstrong/Reid transfers (presumably almost all of the Reid ones), while Frew received 29% and Storey 12%, TUV transfers mainly benefitted Frew over Storey; this could have been due to Frew’s alphabetical advantage, the fact that Frew and Armstrong are both based in Ballymena while Storey is from Ballymoney, or TUV supporters sharing Frew’s vocal opposition to anti-Covid measures. In any case, Frew finished fourth with 8,099.05 votes, O’Lynn fifth with 8,023.43 votes, and Storey sixth with 7,734.98. O’Lynn won the final seat by 288.45 votes.\n\nNorth Down\n\nAlex Easton (Independent): 9,568\n\nAndrew Muir (Alliance): 6,838\n\nStephen Dunne (DUP): 6,226\n\nConnie Egan (Alliance): 5,224\n\nAlan Chambers (UUP): 3,825\n\nRachel Woods (Green): 2,734\n\nJennifer Gilmour (DUP): 2,068\n\nJohn Gordon (TUV): 1,574\n\nNaomi McBurney (UUP): 1,342\n\nDéirdre Vaughan (SDLP): 727\n\nThérèse McCartney (Sinn Féin): 687\n\nRay McKimm (Independent): 604\n\nMatthew Robinson (Conservative): 254\n\nChris Carter (Independent): 72\n\nFollowing the historic election of Stephen Farry as MP for North Down in December 2019, Alliance has again made history, emerging as the largest party in North Down for the first time in an Assembly election, this is Alliance’s highest ever vote in any election apart from the 2019 general election. It was also the DUP’s lowest Assembly percentage vote since 1998 and the UUP’s lowest ever. Alex Easton joins James Kilfedder, Robert McCartney and Sylvia Hermon in the group of North Down unionists who left their original party and continued to have significant electoral success, he had more votes than any party except Alliance, and his gain from the DUP makes him the only person to gain a seat in this election outside of Alliance. Andrew Muir was elected second on stage three, Stephen Dunne third on stage seven, and Alan Chambers and Connie Egan fourth and fifth respectively on stage nine. Like in South Belfast, Alliance balanced their vote very well, ensuring both Muir and Egan were elected, the last time Alliance had two seats in North Down was 1982 when the constituency also included most of Strangford. Ultimately their gain came at the expense of Rachel Woods and the Green Party, who had their lowest Assembly percentage vote since 2003, they had held a seat in North Down since 2007.\n\nSouth Antrim\n\nDeclan Kearney (Sinn Féin): 9,185\n\nJohn Blair (Alliance): 7,315\n\nPam Cameron (DUP): 6,899\n\nSteve Aiken (UUP): 5,354\n\nTrevor Clarke (DUP): 4,943\n\nMel Lucas (TUV): 4,371\n\nRoisin Lynch (SDLP): 3,139\n\nPaul Michael (UUP): 2,821\n\nRóisín Bennett (Aontú): 657\n\nLesley Veronica (Green): 539\n\nAndrew Moran (Independent): 262\n\nJerry Maguire (People Before Profit): 251\n\nThe DUP remain the largest party in South Antrim, however this was their lowest percentage vote since 2003. It was also the UUP’s lowest ever Assembly percentage vote, and the highest ever for both Sinn Féin and Alliance (180.56 votes seems like a distant memory now!). Declan Kearney was elected on stage one, and 22% of his surplus vote elected John Blair second. Steve Aiken took the third seat on stage seven after Paul Michael was excluded, and on stage five TUV transfers elected Pam Cameron and Trevor Clarke. Roisin Lynch had overtaken Mel Lucas through Sinn Féin surplus votes in stage two and the elimination of the smaller parties in stage three, she was 207.39 votes behind Clarke in stage four but finished 1,878.25 votes behind. The real battle here was arguably between Clarke and Lucas, Clarke started 572 votes ahead of Lucas and when Lucas was excluded he was 596.86 votes behind Clarke. Had Lucas been ahead he almost certainly would have won on Clarke’s transfers.\n\nSouth Down\n\nSinéad Ennis (Sinn Féin): 14,381\n\nCathy Mason (Sinn Féin): 9,963\n\nPatrick Brown (Alliance): 6,942\n\nDiane Forsythe (DUP): 6,497\n\nColin McGrath (SDLP): 6,082\n\nHarold McKee (TUV): 3,273\n\nKaren McKevitt (SDLP): 3,006\n\nJill Macauley (UUP): 2,880\n\nRosemary McGlone (Aontú): 1,177\n\nNoeleen Lynch (Green): 412\n\nPaul McCrory (People Before Profit): 205\n\nPatrick Clarke (Independent): 134\n\nThis was Sinn Féin’s best ever result in South Down, and the SDLP’s worst, it is also Alliance’s best ever Assembly election result, and the DUP’s lowest result since 1998. Sinéad Ennis had the highest vote of any candidate in the entire election, while Cathy Mason came fourth overall behind Ennis, Jeffrey Donaldson and Michelle O’Neill, both Ennis and Mason were elected on stage one. Patrick Brown followed on stage five, the first time ever that Alliance has gained an Assembly seat in South Down, Brown started well and received 22% of Ennis’s surplus, 23% of Mason’s surplus, 24% of transfers from the smaller parties, and 15% of UUP transfers, a historic moment for Alliance as they gain an Assembly seat for the first time in a border constituency and a constituency outside of Belfast with a nationalist majority. Diane Forsythe came fourth, she had more votes than the TUV and UUP combined, and she was elected after receiving 48% of UUP transfers (compared to 27% TUV) and 73% of TUV transfers. The final seat went to Colin McGrath, who held on to one SDLP seat however his running mate Karen McKevitt lost out, making this the first time ever in which the SDLP does not have at least two seats in South Down. McGrath finished 3,859.17 votes ahead of McKevitt.\n\nStrangford\n\nKellie Armstrong (Alliance): 7,015\n\nMichelle McIlveen (DUP): 6,601\n\nStephen Cooper (TUV): 5,186\n\nHarry Harvey (DUP): 4,704\n\nMike Nesbitt (UUP): 3,693\n\nPeter Weir (DUP): 3,313\n\nNick Mathison (Alliance): 2,822\n\nPhilip Smith (UUP): 2,535\n\nConor Houston (SDLP): 2,440\n\nRóisé McGivern (Sinn Féin): 1,607\n\nMaurice Macartney (Green): 831\n\nBen King (Independent): 118\n\nThe DUP remains the largest party in Strangford, however this is their lowest Assembly percentage vote since 1998. This is Alliance’s highest ever Assembly percentage vote and the UUP’s lowest. This was probably the most fascinating count in Northern Ireland, and particularly stressful as someone there during the count lol. Kellie Armstrong was the first MLA elected in Northern Ireland, topping the poll and being elected on stage one. The initial speculation was that Stephen Cooper would gain a seat for the TUV, he was only 1,625 votes away from the quota, while Mike Nesbitt looked potentially vulnerable. Another key race was between Nick Mathison and Conor Houston, to see if either could gain a second non-unionist seat for the first time, until now Strangford had only returned either 5/6 unionists or 4/5 unionists. Mathison started 382 votes ahead of Houston, and after stage two Green and Ben King transfers expanded Mathison’s lead to 716. In stage three Sinn Féin transfers brought Houston ahead of Mathison by 147 votes, Philip Smith was then eliminated in stage four, his transfers brought Nesbitt safely ahead of Nesbitt and narrowed Houston’s lead over Mathison to 89 votes. Peter Weir was then excluded in stage five, his transfers elected Michelle McIlveen, while the Houston-Mathison gap was 75 votes. McIlveen’s surplus on stage six elected Harry Harvey, while the Houston-Mathison gap narrowed to 71.04 votes, and after Harvey’s surplus on stage seven the Houston-Mathison gap was just 45.84 votes. At this point the count stopped overnight, so we had to wait until day two for the absolutely crucial Kellie Armstrong surplus of 204, this turned out to be decisive. Armstrong’s surplus went 53% to Mathison, 10% to Houston, 3% to Nesbitt and 1% to Cooper, this brought Mathison ahead of Houston by 40.48 votes. Houston was then excluded, and in order to win Mathison needed 53% of SDLP transfers to surpass the 2,026.19 vote gap with Cooper. In the end Houston’s transfers elected Mathison, who received 61% of SDLP transfers, Nesbitt took 6% and Cooper 1%. Nesbitt took the fourth seat and Mathison the fifth seat, with Mathison finishing 249.77 votes ahead of Cooper. A remarkable comeback for Mathison, who had the lowest first preference votes of any of the 90 MLAs elected, and a huge disappointment for Stephen Cooper, as the most likely person to gain a seat for the TUV.\n\nUpper Bann\n\nJohn O’Dowd (Sinn Féin): 9,242\n\nJonathan Buckley (DUP): 8,869\n\nLiam Mackle (Sinn Féin): 7,260\n\nDiane Dodds (DUP): 6,548\n\nEóin Tennyson (Alliance): 6,440\n\nDoug Beattie (UUP): 5,199\n\nDarrin Foster (TUV): 4,373\n\nDolores Kelly (SDLP): 3,645\n\nGlenn Barr (UUP): 3,367\n\nAidan Gribbin (Aontú): 571\n\nLauren Kendall (Green): 459\n\nGlenn Beattie (Heritage): 128\n\nSinn Féin emerged as the largest party in terms of first preference votes for the second time after 2011, when they were just 29 votes ahead of the DUP. This was the DUP’s lowest Assembly percentage vote since 2011 and Sinn Féin’s highest ever, it is also the UUP’s lowest ever and Alliance’s highest. This was a count that was very difficult to call until the end, Sinn Féin appeared to have a good chance of two while UUP leader Doug Beattie appeared at risk, the potential of an Alliance gain for Eóin Tennyson was also uncertain. Beattie was brought into a better position in stage three following the exclusion of his running mate Glenn Barr, while Tennyson received a significant boost from transfers from the outgoing SDLP candidate Dolores Kelly who was excluded on stage four, her transfers elected John O’Dowd 795 votes over the quota and brought Tennyson 479 votes ahead of Liam Mackle, this 795 O’Dowd surplus (people who had voted Kelly 1 O’Dowd 2 created a lot of uncertainty for the remainder of the count). In stage five TUV transfers elected Jonathan Buckley, it also brought Beattie and Diane Dodds ahead of Mackle but still below Tennyson, there was only 553 votes between all four and one had to miss out. Buckley’s surplus elected Dodds in stage six, and brought Beattie ahead of Tennyson who was now 561 votes ahead of Mackle. Then in stage seven Dodd’s surplus elected Beattie, with Tennyson now 573.07 votes ahead of Mackle. Finally, O’Dowd’s aforementioned surplus of 795 was redistributed, Mackle needed 72% more to overtake Tennyson, but in the end it split 58% to Mackle and 34% to Tennyson, resulting in Tennyson taking the final seat by 376.07 votes. As with South Down, this is a historic gain for Alliance and the first time there has been an Alliance MLA for any part of County Armagh, or any county outside of Antrim and Down.\n\nWest Tyrone\n\nNicola Brogan (Sinn Féin): 8,626\n\nMaoliosa McHugh (Sinn Féin): 6,658\n\nTom Buchanan (DUP): 6,640\n\nDeclan McAleer (Sinn Féin): 6,343\n\nDaniel McCrossan (SDLP): 5,483\n\nTrevor Clarke (TUV): 4,166\n\nStephen Donnelly (Alliance): 2,967\n\nIan Marshall (UUP): 1,876\n\nPaul Gallagher (Independent): 1,682\n\nJames Hope (Aontú): 657\n\nCarol Gallagher (People Before Profit): 354\n\nSusan Glass (Green): 252\n\nAmy Ferguson (Socialist Party): 171\n\nBarry Brown (Independent): 119\n\nSinn Féin remains the largest party in West Tyrone, this was Sinn Féin’s third highest Assembly percentage vote after after 2011 and 2017. This was also the DUP’s lowest Assembly percentage vote and the SDLP’s third lowest after 2011 and 2016. Nicola Brogan was elected on stage one, with the other four all elected on stage six. After the smaller parties were eliminated, Strabane councillor Paul Gallagher was excluded on stage four, his transfers went 32% Sinn Féin, 25% SDLP, 8% Alliance, and <1% DUP, TUV and UUP. In stage five Ian Marshall was excluded, his transfers went 46% DUP, 26% TUV, 16% Alliance, 9% SDLP and <1% Sinn Féin. On stage six Stephen Donnelly’s transfers went 47% SDLP, 17% Sinn Féin, 5% TUV and 4% DUP, Daniel McCrossan was elected second, Tom Buchanan third, Maoliosa McHugh fourth and Declan McAleer fifth. McAleer finished 2,707.36 votes ahead of Trevor Clarke. The TUV’s growth here is very significant, especially receiving more than twice as many votes as the UUP, another notable result was the very strong showing from Stephen Donnelly, building on an impressive council result in Omagh in 2019.\n\nIn twelve of the eighteen constituencies, the top five candidates on first preferences were elected, four candidates were elected starting in sixth place (Gerry Carroll, Cara Hunter, Patricia O’Lynn and Doug Beattie) and two were elected starting in seventh place (Sinéad McLaughlin and Nick Mathison). Two candidates started in fourth place but didn’t gain a seat (Kathleen McGurk and Mervyn Storey), and two started in third place but didn’t gain a seat (Stephen Cooper and Liam Mackle). So while transfers are important, it is important to try and start in the top five as most candidates will begin in the top five.So that’s it. After years of waiting we have finally had the Assembly election, and it turned out to be just as interesting as we expected. Now let’s hope an Executive can be established soon, because I don’t want to go through this again in six months time…\n\nNorthern Ireland uses Single Transferable Vote (STV) for local and Assembly elections. The principles of STV are easily described. Voters rank candidates in order of their choice numerically, giving a ‘1’ to their first preferred candidate, ‘2’ to their second preferred candidate and so on. However, determining the winners in an STV election is more complicated as STV requires multi-seat constituencies to operate effectively. Therefore, in order to be elected, candidates must reach a minimum number of votes to be elected, this is known as the ‘quota.’ While there are several methods to set the quota, Northern Ireland uses the Droop quota which uses a specific formula: dividing the total number of valid votes cast in each constituency by the number of available seats, plus one:\n\nQuota = (Total votes cast ÷ Number of seats + 1)) + 1\n\nSince every Assembly constituency elects five MLAs, this means that the quota will be 1/6th of the vote + 1. For example, in Belfast East in the 2017 Assembly election, there were 40,357 valid votes, leading to a quota of 6,727:\n\n(40,357 ÷ 6) + 1 = Quota of 6,727\n\nAny candidate who reaches the quota is elected, and candidates are often elected on the first stage through first preference votes. For example, in Belfast East in 2017 one candidate received more than 6,727 first preference votes and was therefore elected on stage one: Alliance Party leader Naomi Long:\n\nNaomi Long (Alliance): 7,610\n\nJoanne Bunting (DUP): 6,007\n\nAndy Allen (UUP): 5,275\n\nChris Lyttle (Alliance): 5,059\n\nRobin Newton (DUP): 4,729\n\nDavid Douglas (DUP): 4,431\n\nJohn Kyle (PUP): 2,658\n\nGeorgina Milne (Green): 1,447\n\nMairéad O’Donnell (Sinn Féin): 1,173\n\nAndrew Girvin (TUV): 917\n\nCourtney Robinson (Labour Alternative): 442\n\nSheila Bodel (Conservative): 275\n\nSéamas De Faoite (SDLP): 250\n\nJordy McKeag (Independent): 84\n\nIn subsequent stages, there are two options. If a candidate is elected over the quota has sufficient extra votes to change the order of the remaining candidates, their votes will be redistributed to other candidates based on their next available preferences, these extra votes are known as ‘surplus’ votes. An example of this was the redistribution of Naomi Long’s surplus vote in stage two of the Belfast East result:\n\nNaomi Long (Alliance): -883\n\nJoanne Bunting (DUP): 6,012.02 (+9.02)\n\nChris Lyttle (Alliance): 5,760.03 (+701.03)\n\nAndy Allen (UUP): 5,313.17 (+38.17)\n\nRobin Newton (DUP): 4,734.5 (+5.5)\n\nDavid Douglas (DUP): 4,435.18 (+4.18)\n\nJohn Kyle (PUP): 2,673.29 (+15.29)\n\nGeorgina Milne (Green): 1,474.06 (+27.06)\n\nMairéad O’Donnell (Sinn Féin): 1,183.34 (+10.34)\n\nAndrew Girvin (TUV): 918.65 (+1.65)\n\nCourtney Robinson (Labour Alternative): 449.48 (+7.48)\n\nSheila Bodel (Conservative): 276.32 (+1.32)\n\nSéamas De Faoite (SDLP): 260.45 (+10.45)\n\nJordy McKeag (Independent): 85.43 (+1.43)\n\nNon-transferable: 50.08\n\nOne notable aspect of the redistribution of surplus votes, highlighted by the example of Naomi Long in Belfast East, is that transfers are not redistributed at full value. Surplus votes are transferred at a fractional value calculated by dividing the surplus by the number of votes for the successful candidate. In Long’s case her votes were redistributed at a value of 0.131 (883 ÷ 6,727), which explains why votes become increasingly fractional throughout the count. This becomes more important in later stages as transfers determine the final seat, surplus votes can become extremely small, for example in the closest election in Northern Ireland history, the Mourne DEA in Strabane in the 2011 local election, at the eighth and final stage a Sinn Féin surplus of one vote elected an SDLP candidate over an IRSP rival to win by 0.63 votes:\n\nBrian McMahon (Sinn Féin): -1\n\nPatsy Kelly (SDLP): 707.76 (+0.8)\n\nPaul Gallagher (IRSP): 707.13 (+0.16)\n\nNon-transferable: 0.04\n\nThe other option if there are no surplus votes available (or if the available surpluses are not large enough to make any difference to the order of candidates), then the candidate with the lowest number of votes will be eliminated and their next available preferences are transferred to the remaining candidates. This is comparatively simple when compared to surplus votes, as evidenced by the example of stage three of the East Belfast 2017 result:\n\nJoanne Bunting (DUP): 6,021.02 (+5)\n\nChris Lyttle (Alliance): 5,780.25 (+20.22)\n\nAndy Allen (UUP): 5,323.39 (+10.22)\n\nRobin Newton (DUP): 4,736.5 (+2)\n\nDavid Douglas (DUP): 4,436.18 (+1)\n\nJohn Kyle (PUP): 2,678.51 (+5.22)\n\nGeorgina Milne (Green): 1,500.28 (+26.22)\n\nMairéad O’Donnell (Sinn Féin): 1,185.45 (+2.11)\n\nAndrew Girvin (TUV): 920.65 (+2)\n\nCourtney Robinson (Labour Alternative): 456.48 (+7)\n\nSheila Bodel (Conservative): 278.43 (+2.11)\n\nSéamas De Faoite (SDLP): 260.56 (+0.11)\n\nJordy McKeag (Independent): -85.43\n\nNon-transferable: 2.22\n\nThere are a number of technical aspects of this process which are important to this discussion of how STV operates in Northern Ireland. For example, there are many occasions in which multiple candidates will be eliminated simultaneously, if their combined vote remains less than any other candidate, and the official records of the results can only display the aggregate distribution of these preferences. If they are from two or more parties, then it is impossible to distinguish from which party the transfers came from. One example of this was stage four of the South Antrim result in the 2003 Assembly election:\n\nWilson Clyde (DUP): 5,302 (+42.2)\n\nPaul Girvan (DUP): 4,976.32 (+62.2)\n\nMartin Meehan (Sinn Féin): 4,311.2 (+13)\n\nDavid Ford (Alliance): 3,754.64 (+250.6)\n\nJim Wilson (UUP): 3,667.8 (+112.36)\n\nThomas Burns (SDLP): 2,816.56 (+65)\n\nDonovan McClelland (SDLP): 2,723.72 (+45.48)\n\nAdrian Cochrane-Watson (UUP): 1,964.8 (+75.12)\n\nJohn Smyth (DUP): 1,600.48 (+67.96)\n\nNorman Boyd (NI Unionist Party): 881 (+42.48)\n\nJoan Cosgrove (Women’s Coalition): -484.36\n\nKenneth Wilkinson (PUP): -327.48\n\nNon-transferable: 35.44\n\nAt stage three the combined vote for Joan Cosgrove and Kenneth Wilkinson was 811.84, less than any other candidate as the next lowest placed candidate was Norman Boyd on 838.52. Therefore, both were eliminated at the same time since Cosgrove could not have overtaken Boyd even if she had received 100% of Wilkinson’s transfers, therefore there was no point in only eliminating Wilkinson. This sort of multiple candidate elimination in a single stage is relatively common early in Assembly election counts because there are normally several candidates quite far behind the main competitors, even more so since 2017 because of the higher quota in a five seat constituency compared to a six seat one.\n\nA notable aspect of the original Hare system of surplus redistribution involved a degree of randomness. In this scenario, when surpluses are being distributed, the ‘surplus’ ballot papers are chosen at random from the winning candidate. For example, if a candidate is elected with 1,100 votes against a quota of 1,000, then 100 of their ballot papers will be chosen at random and transferred to the next available candidate. To eliminate this randomness, the Gregory method is used instead in many cases, in which all ballot papers are redistributed to the next candidates, but at a reduced value based on the quota. The Hare method is used in the Republic of Ireland for Dáil elections, while the Gregory method is used for all STV elections in Northern Ireland. For a comparison of how they work, here is the first preference votes in the Dublin South Central constituency in the 2020 Irish general election:\n\nAengus Ó Snodaigh (Sinn Féin): 17,015\n\nCatherine Byrne (Fine Gael): 5,078\n\nCatherine Ardagh (Fianna Fáil): 4,782\n\nBríd Smith (Solidarity-People Before Profit): 4,753\n\nPatrick Costello (Green Party): 4,041\n\nJoan Collins (Independents 4 Change): 2,831\n\nRebecca Moynihan (Labour Party): 2,095\n\nTara Deacy (Social Democrats): 1,595\n\nSerina Irvine (National Party): 632\n\nRichard Murray (Independent): 207\n\nAlan Kerrigan (Independent): 146\n\nRobert Foley (Independent): 78\n\nSean O’Leary (Independent): 38\n\nAengus Ó Snodaigh was the only candidate elected over the quota, and so his surplus was redistributed on the second count:\n\nAengus Ó Snodaigh (Sinn Féin): -8,356\n\nBríd Smith (Solidarity-People Before Profit): 9,547 (+4,794)\n\nCatherine Byrne (Fine Gael): 5,192 (+114)\n\nCatherine Ardagh (Fianna Fáil): 5,013 (+231)\n\nJoan Collins (Independents 4 Change): 4,578 (+1,747)\n\nPatrick Costello (Green Party): 4,449 (+408)\n\nRebecca Moynihan (Labour Party): 2,330 (+235)\n\nTara Deacy (Social Democrats): 1,921 (+326)\n\nSerina Irvine (National Party): 770 (+138)\n\nRichard Murray (Independent): 420 (+213)\n\nAlan Kerrigan (Independent): 241 (+95)\n\nRobert Foley (Independent): 114 (+36)\n\nSean O’Leary (Independent): 57 (+19)\n\nA contrasting example of the Gregory method can be seen in the result of the Oldpark DEA constituency in the 2019 local election, a result I have particular experience of. Here is the first preference vote:\n\nPaul McCusker (SDLP): 2,856\n\nDale Pankhurst (DUP): 1,701\n\nRyan Murphy (Sinn Féin): 1,185\n\nJ. J. Magee (Sinn Féin): 1,134\n\nShauneen Baker (Sinn Féin): 1,107\n\nMary Clarke (Sinn Féin): 796\n\nJulie-Anne Corr-Johnston (PUP): 575\n\nGillian Simpson (DUP): 573\n\nFiona Ferguson (People Before Profit): 447\n\nJack Armstrong (Alliance): 390\n\nJason Docherty (UUP): 239\n\nLesley Veronica (Green): 231\n\nChris Bailie (Workers’ Party): 93\n\nStage two saw the redistribution of Paul McCusker’s surplus at a value of 0.764:\n\nPaul McCusker (SDLP): -1,237\n\nRyan Murphy (Sinn Féin): 1,326.6 (+141.6)\n\nShauneen Baker (Sinn Féin): 1,264.44 (+157.44)\n\nJ. J. Magee (Sinn Féin): 1,244.4 (+110.4)\n\nMary Clarke (Sinn Féin): 1,009.6 (+213.6)\n\nFiona Ferguson (People Before Profit): 781.08 (+334.08)\n\nJulie-Anne Corr-Johnston (PUP): 582.2 (+7.2)\n\nGillian Simpson (DUP): 577.8 (+4.8)\n\nJack Armstrong (Alliance): 535.92 (+145.92)\n\nLesley Veronica (Green): 296.76 (+65.76)\n\nJason Docherty (UUP): 242.84 (+3.84)\n\nChris Bailie (Workers’ Party): 141 (+48)\n\nNon-transferable: 4.36\n\nThe key difference between these two election results is that with the Hare method in Dublin South Central, 8,356 of Ó Snodaigh’s 17,015 votes were selected at random and redistributed at full value, which avoids the need for fractional votes but means that not every vote is counted equally. With the Gregory method, all of McCusker’s 2,856 votes were redistributed but at a value of 0,764 (1,237 ÷ 1,619). This is why there are fractional votes in Northern Ireland local and Assembly elections, but not in Ireland Dáil elections. It is also why non-transferable votes are recorded in Northern Ireland, because some voters will have only given a preference to one candidate. For these reasons, the Gregory method provides a more proportionate and representative result compared to the older Hare method.\n\nAnother provision to note applies to the redistribution of surpluses in later stages. If a candidate is elected on the first stage, all of their ballot papers are considered irrespective of what method is used to redistribute them. However, if a candidate is elected on a later stage, only the ballot papers received by the candidate in that stage will be considered. This is relatively simple when the transferred votes have originated with another candidate from the same party, but becomes more complicated when those transfers come from another party. For example, one particularly interesting and unusual result was Belfast Area G (which comprised parts of the modern Court and Oldpark DEAs) in the 1977 local election. Here is the first preference vote:\n\nGerry Fitt (SDLP): 3,006\n\nFrederick Ashby (DUP): 1,377\n\nSeamus Lynch (Republican Clubs): 1,323\n\nHerbert Ditty (UUP): 1,043\n\nCecil Walker (UUP): 779\n\nGeorge Haffey (DUP): 742\n\nMargaret Laird (UUP): 592\n\nSamuel Millar (UUP): 515\n\nHugh Kidd (Independent Unionist): 387\n\nMary McKeown (Alliance): 320\n\nGerry Fitt’s surplus was redistributed in stage two, electing Seamus Lynch (Republican Clubs was the designation used for Official Sinn Féin which was the predecessor to the Workers’ Party):\n\nGerry Fitt (SDLP): -1,545\n\nSeamus Lynch (Republican Clubs): 2,124.04 (+801.04)\n\nFrederick Ashby (DUP): 1,380.72 (+3.72)\n\nMary McKeown (Alliance): 1,051.6 (+731.6)\n\nHerbert Ditty (UUP): 1,049.2 (+6.2)\n\nCecil Walker (UUP): 779.62 (+0.62)\n\nGeorge Haffey (DUP): 743.24 (+1.24)\n\nMargaret Laird (UUP): 598.82 (+6.82)\n\nSamuel Millar (UUP): 515.62 (+0.62)\n\nHugh Kidd (Independent Unionist): 396.92 (+9.92)\n\nNon-transferable: 3.22\n\nThis is when things get very interesting. Stage three saw the redistribution of Seamus Lynch’s surplus, electing Mary McKeown for the third seat despite her starting last on first preference votes:\n\nSeamus Lynch (Republican Clubs): -683.04\n\nMary McKeown (Alliance): 1,632.54 (+580.94)\n\nFrederick Ashby (DUP): 1,381.34 (+0.62)\n\nHerbert Ditty (UUP): 1,050.44 (+1.24)\n\nCecil Walker (UUP): 782.72 (+3.1)\n\nGeorge Haffey (DUP): 743.24 (-)\n\nMargaret Laird (UUP): 598.82 (-)\n\nSamuel Millar (UUP): 518.72 (+3.1)\n\nHugh Kidd (Independent Unionist): 398.16 (+1.24)\n\nNon-transferable: 92.8\n\nIn cases such as this when a candidate has been elected from a previous surplus, it is only that previous surplus that is redistributed, not the full votes from the candidate. This means that this surplus vote from Seamus Lynch were not actually voters who voted Lynch ’1’, it was in fact voters who had voted Fitt ‘1’ and Lynch ‘2’, with those transfers continuing to their third choice. Therefore, these are votes that originated with Gerry Fitt as their first preference, Seamus Lynch as their second, and at this point they were transferred to those voters’ third preference. This continued into stage four which was the transfer of the surplus vote of Mary McKeown, which were the voters who had voted Fitt ‘1’, Lynch ‘2’ and McKeown ‘3’:\n\nMary McKeown (Alliance): -191.54\n\nFrederick Ashby (DUP): 1,383.2 (+1.86)\n\nHerbert Ditty (UUP): 1,057.88 (+7.44)\n\nCecil Walker (UUP): 792.64 (+9.92)\n\nGeorge Haffey (DUP): 743.86 (+0.62)\n\nMargaret Laird (UUP): 605.64 (+6.82)\n\nSamuel Millar (UUP): 532.36 (+13.64)\n\nHugh Kidd (Independent Unionist): 406.22 (+8.06)\n\nNon-transferable: 143.18\n\nThis sort of surplus usually becomes more prevalent near the end of a count if the final seat is particularly close between several candidates. For another historic example from Belfast South in the 1975 Constitutional Convention election, in stage eight of the count the elimination of SDLP candidate Ben Caraher elected the second Alliance candidate Jim Hendron (his Alliance colleague Basil Glass had been already elected in stage one):\n\nJim Hendron (Alliance): 7,328.74 (+2,864)\n\nReginald Magee (Unionist Party of NI): 5,778.61 (+60.59)\n\nDavid Trimble (Vanguard): 5,226.48 (+9.97)\n\nThomas Burns (DUP): 5,053.86 (+11.5)\n\nRaymond Jordan (Vanguard): 3,364.57 (+14.04)\n\nBen Caraher (SDLP): -3,280.81\n\nNon-transferable: 320.71\n\nBy stage ten, only two candidates were left competing for the final seat, between the DUP and Unionist Party of Northern Ireland (moderate unionist party founded by Brian Faulkner to support power-sharing after Sunningdale). Jim Hendron’s surplus was redistributed at this point, this was overwhelmingly voters who had voted Caraher ‘1’ and Hendron ‘2’:\n\nJim Hendron (Alliance): -497.74\n\nReginald Magee (Unionist Party of NI): 6,423.86 (+476.1)\n\nThomas Burns (DUP): 6,134.07 (+16.65)\n\nNon-transferable: 4.99\n\nDespite a very high transfer rate from the SDLP to Alliance to the UPNI, (95.65%), in the final stage transfers from Vanguard candidate David Trimble (yes that David Trimble) saved the DUP:\n\nDavid Trimble (Vanguard): -409.98\n\nThomas Burns (DUP): 6,513.87 (+379.8)\n\nReginald Magee (Unionist Party of NI): 6,447.71 (+23.85)\n\nNon-transferable: 6.33\n\nOne problem with STV election analysis is that the origin of preference transfers will become increasingly obscured after each stage. If stage two involves the redistribution of a candidate’s surplus vote or the elimination of a single candidate, then it is easy to determine where the transfers are coming from. But from stage three onwards, transfers will include votes that have been previously distributed from another candidate. One of the best examples of this was the 1982 Assembly election in the South Antrim constituency, which had a record twenty-six candidates. Here was the first preference vote:\n\nJames Molyneaux (UUP): 19,978\n\nWilliam Beattie (DUP): 7,489\n\nIvan Davis (DUP): 5,394\n\nFraser Agnew (UUP): 3,302\n\nSeamus Close (Alliance): 2,916\n\nJohn Clenaghan (SDLP): 2,802\n\nGordon Mawhinney (Alliance): 2,660\n\nRoy Thompson (DUP): 2,646\n\nJoan Tomlin (Alliance): 2,107\n\nPatrick Ritchie (SDLP): 2,081\n\nJames McDonald (SDLP): 2,071\n\nGeorge Herron (Independent Unionist): 1,797\n\nClifford Forsythe (UUP): 1,612\n\nTrevor Kirkland (DUP): 1,265\n\nSamuel Neill (DUP): 1,250\n\nWilliam McDonnell (Independent Nationalist): 1,180\n\nBilly Bell (UUP): 979\n\nIvan Hunter (UUP): 930\n\nKevin Smyth (Workers’ Party): 891\n\nAustin Kelly (Workers’ Party): 775\n\nJames Smith (Independent Unionist): 686\n\nBob Kidd (Newtownabbey Labour): 560\n\nFrank Millar Jr (UUP): 526\n\nAndrew Gibb (Communist): 247\n\nKennedy Lindsay (United Ulster Unionist Party): 160\n\nSamuel Larmour (United Ulster Unionist Party): 139\n\nBy the twenty-third and final stage, only four of the twenty-six candidates were still in the running, meaning that transfers had reached as far as the twenty-third preference of voters: Here is the final stage:\n\nJames McDonald (SDLP): -1,418.51\n\nSeamus Close (Alliance): 5,805.81 (+1,055.34)\n\nBilly Bell (UUP): 5,682.73 (-)\n\nGordon Mawhinney (Alliance): 5,099.97 (+349.47)\n\nFrank Millar Jr (UUP): 4,651.72 (+2.97)\n\nNon-transferable: 10.73\n\nThere are hundreds of hypothetical transfer possibilities, and because the specific transfers by ballot are not available, the only way to analyse STV transfers is to look at the surpluses and eliminated transfer votes within the context of the election. To return to South Antrim in 1982, stage twenty-two saw the elimination of SDLP candidate John Clenaghan, who at this point was just 98.15 votes behind Seamus Close:\n\nJames McDonald (SDLP): 7,459.51 (+3,058)\n\nBilly Bell (UUP) 5,682.73 (+5.03)\n\nGordon Mawhinney (Alliance): 4,751.13 (+124.87)\n\nSeamus Close (Alliance): 4,750.47 (+461.7)\n\nFrank Millar Jr (UUP): 4,648.75 (+2.17)\n\nJohn Clenaghan (SDLP): -4,190.62\n\nNon-transferable: 539.71\n\nFrom this stage we know for certain that 73% of Clenaghan’s transfers went to the SDLP, 14% to Alliance and 0.2% to the UUP. Similarly from McDonald’s surplus in the final stage we know 99% of those surplus votes went to Alliance and 0.2% to the UUP. But what if Close had been eliminated instead of Clenaghan? His transfers would certainly have elected Mawhinney, but who would have taken the final seat, Clenaghan or Millar? We will never know because we can only go by the specific order of candidates that were elected or eliminated.\n\nTo summarise, there are essentially six types of transfers in an STV election:\n\nSurplus from a candidate elected on the first stage through only first preference votes.\n\nLater surplus from a candidate elected through the surplus vote of another candidate elected on the first stage, transfers originate with winner on the first stage.\n\nLater surplus from a candidate elected on a later stage, transfers originate with winner from that later stage.\n\nLater surplus from the votes of an eliminated candidate.\n\nTransfers from a single eliminated candidate.\n\nTransfers from multiple eliminated candidates.\n\nHowever, there are many other fun aspects to STV elections. Outside of transfers, one crucial aspect for parties is the issue of vote management, also known as vote balancing. STV is quite unusual in that you are voting for a person first and not a party, this also applies to other voting systems such as First Past the Post and Alternative Vote, but they are normally single seat constituencies so you will only have one candidate per party. Many list systems such as d’Hondt require the formal recognition of political parties. But in STV, candidates stand as individuals, albeit with a party label. This makes STV a preferable system for independents (look at how many independents are elected in Ireland compared to almost everywhere else). This means that parties have to make decisions about how many candidates to run, and if running two or more they will often look at how to balance the vote to ensure each candidate is elected.\n\nIt’s fair to say that parties have come a long way in terms of vote management, in the past they often just relied on their main vote winner to bring their colleagues over the line on transfers. This was probably most evident with the DUP’s Peter Robinson for decades in Castlereagh, as evidenced by the first preference vote of the 1981 local election in Castlereagh Area C:\n\nPeter Robinson (DUP): 3,562\n\nPatricia Archer (Alliance): 1,048\n\nHerbert Johnstone (UUP): 990\n\nBryan Davidson (Alliance): 493\n\nWalter McFarland (UUP): 411\n\nCedric Wilson (DUP): 38\n\nDenny Vitty (DUP): 35\n\nRobinson’s surplus elected Denny Vitty in stage two and Cedric Wilson in stage three. However, it is generally preferable to ensure all candidates have a decent number of first preference votes in order to be competitive throughout the count. For example, in the 1982 Assembly election in Belfast East the DUP had more than enough votes for three seats, as seen in the first preference votes:\n\nPeter Robinson (DUP): 15,319\n\nJeremy Burchill (UUP): 7,345\n\nOliver Napier (Alliance): 6,037\n\nAddie Morrow (Alliance): 2,966\n\nWilliam Craig (Vanguard): 2,274\n\nDorothy Dunlop (UUP): 1,696\n\nHerbert Johnstone (UUP): 973\n\nPeter Prendiville (SDLP): 868\n\nFrancis Cullen (Workers’ Party): 681\n\nReg Empey (United Ulster Unionist Party): 503\n\nSammy Wilson (DUP): 397\n\nDenny Vitty (DUP): 235\n\nBenjamin Horan (United Ulster Unionist Party): 123\n\nHowever, Robinson’s surplus transferred 76.9% to Denny Vitty and only 8.7% to Sammy Wilson, this meant that Wilson was unable to catch up for the rest of the count and he narrowly lost out to Addie Morrow for the final seat:\n\nDorothy Dunlop (UUP): 5,981.11 (+1,416)\n\nAddie Morrow (Alliance): 4,881.17 (+390.32)\n\nSammy Wilson (DUP): 4,169.51 (+769.9)\n\nWilliam Craig (Vanguard): -3,360.66\n\nNon-transferable: 784.44\n\nAn even more dramatic example was from North Down in the 1982 Assembly election. Here is the first preference vote:\n\nJames Kilfedder (Ulster Popular Unionist Party): 13,958\n\nJohn Taylor (UUP): 5,852\n\nSimpson Gibson (DUP): 4,500\n\nJohn Cushnahan (Alliance): 4,416\n\nLord Dunleath (Alliance): 3,841\n\nRobert McCartney (UUP): 3,782\n\nWesley Pentland (DUP): 3,340\n\nCharles Poots (DUP): 2,811\n\nWilliam Bleakes (UUP): 2,692\n\nPatrick Doherty (SDLP): 2,536\n\nThomas Gourley (DUP): 2,060\n\nHazel Bradford (UUP): 1,966\n\nBrian Wilson (Alliance): 1,055\n\nGeorge Green (Ulster Popular Unionist Party): 958\n\nDavid McNarry (UUP): 671\n\nRobert Gabbey (United Ulster Unionist Party): 181\n\nThe Ulster Popular Unionist Party (UPUP) had nearly 2.5 quotas, and local MP James Kilfedder had 2.3 quotas by himself, more than enough to elect his running mate George Green. However, on stage two Green only received 41.9% of Kilfedder’s surplus vote, which brought him to over 4,000 votes, but ultimately he lost out in the final stage by just 5.81 votes, the closest ever result in a Northern Ireland Assembly election in the last fifty years:\n\nRobert McCartney (UUP): -62.3\n\nWilliam Bleakes (UUP): 5,383.79 (+47.27)\n\nGeorge Green (UPUP): 5,377.98 (+13.05)\n\nNon-transferable: 1.98\n\nInterestingly, both Bleakes and Green would end up in the same party a decade later as Northern Ireland Conservative councillors.\n\nSinn Féin is often discussed in relation to vote management, particularly in Belfast West such as in the 2007 Assembly election when they won five out of six seats:\n\nGerry Adams (Sinn Féin): 6,029\n\nSue Ramsey (Sinn Féin): 4,715\n\nPaul Maskey (Sinn Féin): 4,368\n\nJennifer McCann (Sinn Féin): 4,265\n\nFra McCann (Sinn Féin): 4,254\n\nDiane Dodds (DUP): 3,661\n\nAlex Attwood (SDLP): 3,036\n\nMargaret Walsh (SDLP): 1,074\n\nSeán Mitchell (People Before Profit): 774\n\nLouis West (UUP): 558\n\nJohn Lowry (Workers’ Party): 434\n\nGeraldine Taylor (Republican Sinn Féin): 427\n\nDan McGuinness (Alliance): 127\n\nRainbow George (Make Politicians History): 68\n\nOr more recently at council level the 2019 local election in Black Mountain DEA in which Sinn Féin won six out of seven seats:\n\nMatt Collins (People Before Profit): 2,268\n\nCiarán Beattie (Sinn Féin): 1,893\n\nSteven Corr (Sinn Féin): 1,864\n\nArder Carson (Sinn Féin): 1,634\n\nMicheal Donnelly (Sinn Féin): 1,535\n\nEmma Groves (Sinn Féin): 1,431\n\nRonan McLaughlin (Sinn Féin): 1,316\n\nPaul Doherty (SDLP): 783\n\nEoin Geraghty (Aontú): 750\n\nLiam Norris (Alliance): 213\n\nStevie Maginn (Green): 204\n\nConor Campbell (Workers’ Party): 162\n\nVote management was particularly critical for Sinn Féin in the 2017 Assembly election, to take four seats in Belfast West and three seats in several other constituencies. Although this is clearly a strength of the party, one challenge for the party is that compared to others they often receive few transfers from other parties. Perhaps the most famous example of this was the 2003 Assembly election in South Antrim, in which on the first preference votes it seemed likely that Martin Meehan would gain a seat at the expense of then Alliance leader David Ford:\n\nDavid Burnside (UUP): 7,066\n\nWilson Clyde (DUP): 5,131\n\nPaul Girvan (DUP): 4,820\n\nMartin Meehan (Sinn Féin): 4,295\n\nDavid Ford (Alliance): 3,393\n\nJim Wilson (UUP): 3,135\n\nThomas Burns (SDLP): 2,732\n\nDonovan McClelland (SDLP): 2,671\n\nJohn Smyth (DUP): 1,501\n\nAdrian Cochrane-Watson (UUP): 953\n\nNorman Boyd (NI Unionist Party): 774\n\nJoan Cosgrove (Women’s Coalition): 465\n\nKenneth Wilkinson (PUP): 311\n\nJason Docherty (Conservative): 174\n\nHowever, Meehan received very few transfers outside from the SDLP in the final stage, while Ford gained enough transfers from across the political spectrum to hold the final seat by 180.56 votes:\n\nThomas Burns (SDLP): 4,979.24 (+1,986.88)\n\nDavid Ford (Alliance): 4,966.2 (+269.36)\n\nMartin Meehan (Sinn Féin): 4,785.64 (+466.72)\n\nDonovan McClelland (SDLP): -2,802.4\n\nNon-transferable: 79.44\n\nThis example indicates the importance of being transfer friendly in STV elections, and Alliance in particular is very transfer friendly. Another impact of transfers is that they can be maximised by transferring to as many candidates as possible, if there is one particular candidate who you don’t want to see elected. There were several examples of this in the 1989 local election, this was because 1985 was the first local election contested by Sinn Féin, and subsequently in 1989 many unionist voters in particular were prepared to transfer outside the unionist bloc to help other candidates against Sinn Féin. One example of this was the Glenelly DEA in Strabane, here was the first preference vote:\n\nJames Emery (UUP): 1,359\n\nJohn Donnell (DUP): 1,118\n\nJohn Gallagher (SDLP): 1,035\n\nSamuel Rogers (DUP): 737\n\nMartin Forbes (Sinn Féin): 526\n\nBrian Logue (SDLP): 225\n\nHughes Colhoun (Alliance): 124\n\nYou might think on the first preference votes that Alliance had no chance, but there were only three unionist candidates with 3.75 quotas between them, and they transferred overwhelmingly to Alliance, as did most in the SDLP, leading to this final result in stage six:\n\nJohn Gallagher (SDLP): -180\n\nHughes Colhoun (Alliance): 835.78 (+87.6)\n\nMartin Forbes (Sinn Féin): 671.91 (+91.6)\n\nNon-transferable: 0.8\n\nAnother even more dramatic result was Dungannon Town in 1989. Here was the first preference vote:\n\nKen Maginnis (UUP): 1,479\n\nWilliam Brown (UUP): 874\n\nMaurice Morrow (DUP): 795\n\nPeter Corrigan (Sinn Féin): 757\n\nMichael McLoughlin (Independent Nationalist): 600\n\nVincent Currie (SDLP): 570\n\nGerry Cullen (Workers’ Party): 276\n\nPeggy Devlin (SDLP): 156\n\nThe quota was 787 votes and the Sinn Féin candidate Peter Corrigan was just 30 votes away on first preferences. Yet UUP, DUP, SDLP and independent transfers overwhelmingly favoured the Workers’ Party candidate Gerry Cullen, with a remarkably high 98% of William Brown’s surplus going to Cullen, as well as 99% of Michael McLaughlin’s surplus, leading to this extremely narrow victory on stage seven:\n\nMaurice Morrow (DUP): -8\n\nGerry Cullen (Workers’ Party): 771.16 (+5.32)\n\nPeter Corrigan (Sinn Féin): 762 (+0.06)\n\nNon-transferable: 2.62\n\nThere has only been one occasion ever in Northern Ireland in which a candidate topped the poll on first preference votes but did not win a seat, that was in Braid Valley DEA in Ballymena in the 1985 local election. Independent candidate James Woulahan topped the poll just 28 votes away from the quota of 884:\n\nJames Woulahan (Independent): 856\n\nDesmond Armstrong (UUP): 757\n\nSamuel Hanna (DUP): 746\n\nJohn Porter (DUP): 724\n\nJohn Armstrong (DUP): 628\n\nMargaret Alexander (UUP): 626\n\nHarbinson McCullough (UUP): 490\n\nSamuel Martin (DUP): 474\n\nHowever, the elimination of the lowest DUP and UUP candidates brought the other five unionists ahead of him (I do not know whether Woulahan personally indicated his constitutional preference, but from this result I would presume not), leading to this very close loss on stage seven:\n\nSamuel Hanna (DUP): -8.2\n\nJohn Porter (DUP): 882.36 (+7.2)\n\nJames Woulahan (Independent): 870.79 (+0.9)\n\nNon-transferable: 0.1\n\nThis remains a one off and very unlikely to happen again, but there are a few other cases in which a candidate started in second place but did not gain a seat. A more contemporary example of this was the Titanic DEA in the 2019 local election, here was the first preference vote:\n\nGeorge Dorrian (DUP): 1,270\n\nMairead O’Donnell (Sinn Féin): 1,102\n\nMichelle Kelly (Alliance): 1,068\n\nCarole Howard (Alliance): 1,055\n\nJohn Kyle (PUP): 1,027\n\nAdam Newton (DUP): 913\n\nSonia Copeland (UUP): 852\n\nBen Smylie (Green): 641\n\nLee Reynolds (DUP): 586\n\nKarl Bennett (Independent): 448\n\nColin Hall-Thompson (UUP): 278\n\nPaul Girvan (UKIP): 228\n\nSinn Féin received very few transfers and good Alliance vote management plus the majority of Green transfers ensured that Alliance gained a second seat here from Sinn Féin, here was the final stage eight:\n\nAdam Newton (DUP): -167.9\n\nSonia Copeland (UUP): 1,410.28 (+102.6)\n\nJohn Kyle (PUP): 1,368.7 (+59.4)\n\nCarole Howard (Alliance): 1,318.24 (+3.6)\n\nMairead O’Donnell (SF): 1,145 (-)\n\nNon-transferable: 2.3\n\nAnother unusual aspect of STV elections is that it is technically possible to win a seat even if a candidate begins in last place on first preference votes. One good example of this was the Carrick Castle DEA in the 1993 local election, here is the first preference vote:\n\nSeán Neeson (Alliance): 1,096\n\nDavid Hilditch (DUP): 696\n\nWilliam Hamilton (Independent): 580\n\nSamuel McCamley (UUP): 231\n\nSamuel Stewart (PUP): 183\n\nRobert McCartney (UUP): 174\n\nArthur McQuitty (Alliance): 92\n\nSince Seán Neeson had 2.15 quotas by himself, he had more than enough surplus votes to elect his Alliance running mate Arthur McQuitty on stage two:\n\nSéan Neeson (Alliance): -596\n\nArthur McQuitty (Alliance): 532.73 (+440.73)\n\nSamuel McCamley (UUP): 267.58 (+36.58)\n\nSamuel Stewart (PUP): 243.18 (+60.18)\n\nRobert McCartney (UUP): 218.25 (+44.25)\n\nNon-transferable: 4.26\n\nIf your vote is that strong then vote management doesn’t really matter, this refers back to my earlier point that in the past some parties (mainly the DUP) simply relied on their most prominent candidate to bring out the votes and transfer down to colleagues, rather than actively trying to manage the first preference vote between candidates as most parties do now.\n\nIn a more interesting contemporary example, in the Waterside DEA in 2019 Philip McKinney gained a seat for Alliance despite starting in last place on first preference votes:\n\nDarren Guy (UUP): 1,589\n\nSinéad McLaughlin (SDLP): 1,483\n\nHilary McClintock (DUP): 1,250\n\nMartin Reilly (SDLP): 939\n\nDavid Ramsey (DUP): 839\n\nChristopher Jackson (Sinn Féin): 825\n\nSharon McLaughlin (Sinn Féin): 784\n\nDrew Thompson (DUP): 780\n\nMaeve O’Neill (People Before Profit): 752\n\nPhilip McKinney (Alliance): 715\n\nAfter the surpluses of the top three candidates were redistributed, McKinney had moved up to 783.7 votes and Maeve O’Neill was on 782.7 votes, therefore on stage five O’Neill was eliminated and her transfers brought McKinney decisively ahead of Drew Thompson and Sharon McLaughlin. This also highlights how one vote can make a difference, so make sure to transfer to as many candidates as possible.\n\nAnother interesting question is whether a party has been able to gain every seat in a constituency or DEA, since winning every seat is exceptionally difficult under STV as it is based around the maximisation of representation and therefore suits multiple parties. But it has been done twice. Firstly, in 1981 the SDLP won all four seats in Area B of Newry and Mourne council, essentially much of the modern Crotlieve DEA:\n\nP. J. Bradley (SDLP): 1,084\n\nJim McCart (SDLP): 847\n\nLiam Trainor (SDLP): 595\n\nBrian Mulligan (SDLP): 589\n\nAnthony Williamson (Independent): 459\n\nWilliam McCoy (UUP): 433\n\nJoe Kearney (Irish Independence Party): 412\n\nEithne Doran (Alliance): 174\n\nRaymond Hanna (DUP): 135\n\nPeter Maloy (Independent): 106\n\nJohn Ward (Independent): 33\n\nIn this case, the SDLP vote was about 3.2 quotas, but as you can see from the first preference vote they balanced their vote quite well. The final margin was just 22.1 votes for the fourth SDLP candidate for the last seat:\n\nLiam Trainor (SDLP): 804.6 (+46)\n\nBrian Mulligan (SDLP): 742.4 (+21.3)\n\nAnthony Williamson (Independent): 720.3 (+82)\n\nWilliam McCoy (UUP): -620.5\n\nNon-transferable: 471.2\n\nThe other occasion was Lower Falls DEA in 2005, when Sinn Féin took all five seats with a massive 85.2% of the vote, or 5.11 quotas:\n\nJanice Austin (Sinn Féin): 2,071\n\nFra McCann (Sinn Féin): 2,045\n\nTom Hartley (Sinn Féin): 1,962\n\nMáire Cush (Sinn Féin): 1,764\n\nMargaret Walsh (SDLP): 1,265\n\nMarie Moore (Sinn Féin): 1,245\n\nJohn Lowry (Workers’ Party): 314\n\nThe final result was a relatively clear 288.15 votes:\n\nFra McCann (Sinn Féin): -267\n\nMarie Moore (Sinn Féin): 1,764.42 (+236.32)\n\nMargaret Walsh (SDLP): 1,476.27 (+26.32)\n\nNon-transferable: 4.36\n\nOne advantage of STV compared to other electoral systems (especially First Past the Post) is that it significantly reduces the possibility of uncontested seats, however there have still been five cases in which the number of candidates in a local council DEA was equal to the number of seats, and therefore no vote was held. These were:\n\nBallymena Area B (1977)\n\nLarne Area A (1977)\n\nBallymoney Town (1989)\n\nArds East (2001)\n\nBallinderry (2005)\n\nOne final interesting question, what were the closest electoral contests in each Assembly election since 1973? The below examples involve the final stages between two candidates from different parties, I have not included the many occasions in which the final seat was between two candidates from the same party, only contests between different parties.\n\n1973 had three constituencies where the final seat was decided by less than 300 votes, third closest was Belfast East:\n\nNorman Agnew (UUP): 8,027.29 (+798.06)\n\nOliver Napier (Alliance): 7,418.97 (+77.18)\n\nDavid Bleakley (NI Labour Party): 6,690.47 (+301.3)\n\nWalter McFarland (UUP): 6,436.15 (+966.84)\n\nJim Rodgers (Vanguard): -5,386.5\n\nNon-transferable: 3,243.12\n\nSecond was North Down:\n\nCharles Poots (DUP): -2,571.2\n\nLord Dunleath (Alliance): 7,663.26 (+38)\n\nRobert Campbell (UUP): 7,307.27 (+341)\n\nWilliam Brownlow (UUP): 6,630.05 (+106)\n\nBertie McConnell (Alliance): 6,331.28 (+20)\n\nAndrew Donaldson (UUP): 6,097.72 (+194)\n\nNon-transferable: 1,872.2\n\nAnd first was Belfast North:\n\nLloyd Hall-Thompson (UUP): -2,132.48\n\nWilliam Morgan (UUP): 7,273.48 (+1,080.52)\n\nFrank Millar (UUP): 6,521.92 (+451.52)\n\nJohn Ferguson (Alliance): 6,146.16 (+35.36)\n\nCecil Walker (UUP): 6,058.44 (+554.88)\n\nNon-transferable: 10.2\n\n1975 had five very close final races, each less than 200 votes.

But which constituency will produce the closest result in 2022? And which will give us the most surprising result? As I have tried to highlight, surprises are always possible in STV elections…\n\nThe first poll of 2022 is here, and possibly the last Northern Ireland Assembly voting intention poll between now and the beginning of the election campaign at the end of March. Presumably we will also get two or three LucidTalk polls during that time as well, which considering LucidTalk’s solid history of election polling will give the best indication of the likely first preference percentage vote for each party when the boxes are opened and the votes are counted in the morning of Friday 6th May.\n\nThe result of this poll (compared to the previous poll in November and the last Assembly election in March 2017) is:\n\nSinn Féin: 25% (+1 from Nov, -2.9% from AE17)\n\nDUP: 17% (-1% from Nov, -11.1% from AE17)\n\nAlliance: 14% (-1% from Nov, +4.9% from AE17)\n\nUUP: 14% (NC from Nov, +1.1% from AE17)\n\nTUV: 12% (+1% from Nov, +9.4% from AE17)\n\nSDLP: 11% (-1% from Nov, -0.9% from AE17)\n\nGreen: 3% (+1% from Nov, +0.7% from AE17)\n\nPeople Before Profit: 1% (-1% from Nov, -0.8% from AE17)\n\nOthers: 3% (+1% from Nov, -0.4% from AE17)\n\nHere is an indication of the various elections and polls since the distant past that was March 2017:\n\nSo not the most exciting poll to be honest, with no party moving up or down by more than one percent. Still worth discussing the implications of this poll for each party:\n\nSinn Féin\n\nFor the sixth LucidTalk poll in a row Sinn Féin has been the largest party, this time with an eight percent lead over the DUP, making them the presumptive favourites to become the largest party in the next Assembly. 25% would be the party’s fourth best Assembly election result, after 2017 (27.9%), 2011 (26.3%) and 2007 (26.2%).\n\nBut it is important to emphasise that Sinn Féin’s solid lead in the polls is not because of any increase in the party vote. Some people mistakenly believe that Sinn Féin support is surging in Northern Ireland to the same extent as in the south where their significant lead over the other parties is quite remarkable. In reality, Sinn Féin is 2.9% down from their last Assembly election result, their best ever. As a result, Sinn Féin is unlikely to gain any new seats in May, and in fact several of their twenty-seven seats are at risk, since many of them were very narrowly won in 2017. Most vulnerable are their third seat in Fermanagh and South Tyrone and their second seats in Belfast North and Foyle, these would be very difficult to defend on 24-25% of the vote. Also potentially at risk is their fourth seat in Belfast West, the third seats in West Tyrone and Newry and Armagh, the second in South Down and unless they are close to the quota on stage one then possibly their seats in North Antrim and Belfast South.\n\nSinn Féin has some notable advantages and disadvantages when compared to other parties. They are normally very good at vote management, i.e. ensuring that when they run multiple candidates, each one gets enough first preference votes to stay in the running until late in the count. For example, in the 2017 Assembly election the top four candidates in Belfast West on stage one were the four Sinn Féin candidates. They are also normally good at ensuring transfers go overwhelmingly to other Sinn Féin candidates if one of them is elected or eliminated early. Having said that, their main challenge is that they are less transfer friendly than other parties, very few unionists will transfer to them (except those two TUV voters in Bannside who saved the Sinn Féin candidate in the 2019 local elections, but this is extremely rare), and precedent suggests SDLP voters are more likely to transfer to Alliance. For an example of this problem, in the 2017 Assembly election in Belfast North Gerry Kelly and Carál Ní Chuilín were the top two candidates on first preference votes, but they only just won the final two seats as they received just 320 and 235 transferred votes respectively, in contrast Alliance candidate Nuala McAllister started 2,442 votes behind Ní Chuilín and finished just 556 votes behind. This is why any drop in the Sinn Féin vote, even a relatively small 2-3%, puts their seats at risk, because they can’t rely on transfers from other parties to help them out. In contrast, parties like Alliance or the SDLP might be able to gain a decent percentage of unionist transfers if it is them or Sinn Féin for the final seat, which could happen in places like Belfast North or North Antrim.\n\nSinn Féin have announced a few candidates, for example Gerry Kelly will be running again in Belfast North, and Pat Sheehan in Belfast West. Two MLAs are not running again, Speaker Alex Maskey is retiring after thirty-nine years as a Sinn Féin councillor or MLA, and Emma Rogan was not re-selected in South Down, instead councillor Cathy Mason will run alongside Sinead Ennis there. Of the twenty-seven Sinn Féin MLAs, eleven were co-opted during the term, and presumably ten of them will run again (Rogan being the exception), it might be a challenge for some of them as they succeeded long-standing Sinn Féin reps such as Fra McCann, Máirtín Ó Muilleoir, Raymond McCartney and Seán Lynch. One notable new candidate is Daniel Baker, who is running in Belfast West following Maskey’s retirement, he is a councillor in the Collin DEA and a former Lord Mayor. Overall Sinn Féin has a good chance to become the largest party in the Assembly and therefore Michelle O’Neill could become the first nationalist First Minister (even though she is effectively joint First Minister in all but name right now, but symbolism matters to many here), but if so it seems most likely that this will happen due to the DUP losing more seats than Sinn Féin rather than Sinn Féin actually gaining seats.\n\nDUP\n\nAnother disappointing poll for the DUP, conducted during the double jobbing controversy that lasted about as long as NI21. This might have exacerbated the DUP’s poor result since they were the only party to support double jobbing and many speculated that this was entirely to help out the new DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson avoid a contentious by-election in Lagan Valley and have a back-up plan in Westminster if a new Stormont Executive was not formed. 17% would be the worst DUP regional/Assembly election result since the 1975 Constitutional Convention. Interestingly 1975 could provide an interesting precedent for this incoming Assembly since in 1975 the unionist vote was split roughly three ways between the UUP, DUP and Vanguard, replace Vanguard with TUV and you could explain this poll the same way. Of course, back in 1975 those three parties had a majority between them, and fought a united campaign against power-sharing, whereas there are significant differences between the three current unionist parties.\n\nA drop of about a third in the DUP vote compared to 2017 would put many of their seats at risk. Their most vulnerable seat is in Strangford, the only constituency to elect three DUP MLAs in 2017, the third was very narrowly won. Second most at risk is probably North Down, the DUP won two seats here in 2017 but they have lost ground since failing to gain the Westminster seat in 2019, which instead went to Alliance after Lady Sylvia Hermon’s retirement, and more recently the resignation of Alex Easton from the DUP. Easton topped the poll in the last four Assembly elections, it is impossible to tell how much of that is a personal vote but he would certainly have a chance as an independent unionist. Other second seats that might be at risk on 17% of the vote include Belfast North, Belfast East, South Antrim, East Antrim, Upper Bann and East Londonderry. Basically everywhere except Lagan Valley, the only reason I didn’t include Lagan Valley is that the trio of Jeffrey Dona"
