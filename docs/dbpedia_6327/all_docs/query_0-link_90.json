        "text": "published on 2022-06-04T22:49:06Z\n\nDimitri and Khalid return to the Subliminal Cinema to dissect the 1967 Soviet horror classic âViyâ, including: the murky etymology of Gogolâs eponymous âking of the gnomesâ, satanic Cossacks, sleazy seminarians, getting spiritually molested by a witch, Gogolâs gift for portraying the poshlost of a poshlosty man, the shockingly ghoulish climax of the film, Khoma Brut getting dragged to Hell In A Bucket, some background on Nikolai Gogolâs life, becoming a liberal satirist superhero before doing trad autofiction and getting cancelled, Belinskyâs scorched earth takedown of Gogolâs politics, Stalin the seminarian, religious dynamics of Marxist-Leninist governments, the failure of edgelord atheism and Stalinâs soyface-inducing reconciliation with God during WW2, Aleksandr Ptushko aka âthe Soviet Walt Disneyâ, the evolving Soviet framings of Gogol, and The Responsibility of the Artist to have perfect politics.
