        "text": "Viy\n\nDirected by Konstantin Ershov and Georgiy Kropachyov\n\nWritten by Konstantin Ershov and Georgiy Kropachyov from a story by Nicholai Gogol\n\n1967/USSR\n\nIMDb link\n\nFirst viewing/YouTube\n\nOne of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\n\nOne of 1000 Movies on the “They Shoot Zombies Don’t They” List\n\n[box] “I am fated to journey hand in hand with my strange heroes and to survey the surging immensity of life, to survey it through the laughter that all can see and through the tears unseen and unknown by anyone.” ― Nikolai Gogol[/box]\n\nHorror Soviet-style turns out to be entertaining if not particularly scary.\n\nKhoma (Leonid Kuravlyov) is a bit of a sad sack and is studying to be a monk. He and a few of his fellow students go on vacation, which consists of a lot of drinking and other sinful behavior. They run out of money and don’t have a place to spend the night. An old crone at a farmhouse agrees to take them in but they must all occupy different rooms. Khoma is left sleeping in the barn next to some livestock. The old woman enters and tries to seduce him. She talks him into letting her mount his back and flies off with him.\n\nClearly she is a witch and Khoma proceeds to beat her savagely. As the old lady succumbs to the blows she transforms into a young beauty. Khoma runs away. On her death bed, she instructs her father to sent for Khoma to pray for her soul. She dies and the father forces Khoma to spend three nights praying over her corpse. She and monsters from hell try to scare him to death.\n\nThe plot summary may not suggest it but there is a good deal of comedy in this film. Such a relief to get back to a List film that actually tells a story. What these guys could have done with a bigger special effects budget!\n\nClip\n\nI’ve been a classic movie fan for many years. My original mission was to see as many movies as I could get my hands on for every year from 1929 to 1970. I have completed that mission.\n\nI then carried on with my chronological journey and and stopped midway through 1978. You can find my reviews of 1934-1978 films and “Top 10” lists for the 1929-1936 and 1944-77 films I saw here. For the past several months I have circled back to view the pre-Code films that were never reviewed here.\n\nI have an account on letterboxd.com and you can find some extra reviews, lists, etc. at http://www.letterboxd.com/marie_dressler/\n\nI have an Instagram account at @flickersintime.\n\nI’m a retired Foreign Service Officer living in Indio, California. When I’m not watching movies, I’m probably traveling, watching birds, knitting, or reading."
