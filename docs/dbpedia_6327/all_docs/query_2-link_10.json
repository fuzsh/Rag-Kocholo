        "text": "This year’s Spookoween starts off with cults, other worlds, the power of Metal, demons, possessions, hauntings, vengeful ghosts, battle axes, overnight stays in mansions with a catch, extremely contested wills, Kālī Mā, protective circles, 3D wonders and the mysterious happenings of early 1980s.\n\nBut before I go into my 31 Days of Horror, behold my…\n\nSpookoween Prologue:\n\nTwo movies I watched the week before October began.\n\nIron Butterfly’s “In A Gadda Da Vida” has been stuck in my head ever since I watched Panos Cosmatos’ Mandy (2018). I know it opens with a King Crimson song, but there you go. Am I replacing the opening song with one I think should open the film? Does it remind me of Michael Mann’s Manhunter somehow? I don’t know. Mandy (Andrea Riseborough) and Red (Cage) live in the mountains. Red works as a lumberjack. Mandy works at a little store by the highway. In her spare time, she draws rad fantasy art. They are metalheads and watch horror movies together. Till one day, a cult straight with a leader straight out of the Source Family, though, you know, violent and murderous, passes Mandy on the road. They are in their hippie cult van and she is walking home. The leader Jeremiah Sand (Linus Roach) decides he needs her and orders her abduction. Mandy is full of great cinematography, ax-forging, animated segments, laughing at psychedelic folk music, and parts of it look like they could have come from Heavy Metal, either the magazine or the film. (My friend Angela says it’s a movie that is made of sweet van art).\n\nCage brings something ineffable to Mandy. And it seems like Nicolas Cage never traffics in the ineffable. Most of his career he has been extremely effable. But, again, there you go. Cage elevates the film or grounds it. Or he does both somehow. He brings something to Mandy that feels missing from Cosmatos’ previous film, Beyond The Black Rainbow (2010). In Mandy, he’s back to indie film Cage, who I kinda loved in Raising Arizona and Vampire’s Kiss. Both Mandy and Beyond the Black Rainbow are similarly oneiric, similarly gorgeous and similarly centered on a woman captured by a cult in the early 1980s. Beyond the Black Rainbow is a movie I should love. It has beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack I listen to all the time. Maybe sometime I will love it. I am certainly glad Beyond the Black Rainbow exists. I hope more people make films like it–after years of realism and naturalism dominating even potentially fantastical genre stories. But somehow though I love how Beyond The Black Rainbow looks and sounds, it feels slick and impermeable to me. Which is fine. Movies balance different elements, and style is certainly enough.\n\nMandy is a much less seamless movie, a much chunkier one, but I think without Cage I would feel much the same about it. I appreciate Mandy‘s ambition. I appreciate its sources. I appreciate it pushing movies back toward more daring and color. I fully support its mix of artsiness with the feel of straight to VHS movies. Nostalgia isn’t quite the right word, but I don’t know what else to use–it feels nostalgic for a time when movies like this–with demon bikers, jesus freaks and certain kinds of practical effects–scared everyone. “Remember when this was scary? Remember when this was cool?” Not so much evoking feeling, as nostalgia does, but familiarity. It distance me from the scary and the cool maybe. Maybe I have seen too many movies that I can only wonder at and struggle to comprehend? Will I ever understand Bangkok Loco (2010)? Maybe it is as simple as I have not grown up with only naturalistic film and seeing something assert that realism isn’t the way things have to be is not, by itself, enough to blow my mind. Maybe I will figure out how I feel about Mandy and if I like it with a rewatch? But I was so glad to see Nicolas Cage. He punctured its potentially impermeable surface. He cannot be contained. I would also like that raglan shirt with the tiger on it.\n\nHereditary (2018) should come with a warning for adults for frank depictions of family dynamics, loss of parents and loss of children. Basically, if you are 17, it’s probably fine. Toni Collette is a fucking force of nature as Annie Graham. Also, if you watch it on dvd there are some nice features about design in the film, which is as much about art as it is about grief, family and demonic possession. There is a scene I do not like thinking about and have trouble getting out of my head. Also, I tend to try to figure out how rituals work and what’s up with movie religions and cults. Hereditary‘s business is not as smooth as The Wicker Man (1973), but it is a helluva lot better than Kill List or, the Old Gods forbid, The Wicker Tree.\n\nDo NOT watch Hereditary with The Babadook.\n\nOct. 1. The Tractate Middoth (2013) is an adaptation of a 1911 M. R. James story directed by Mark Gatiss for the BBC’s A Ghost Story for Christmas. Not only are there librarians, there is a spooky vicar, Dr. Thomas Rant (David Ryall). In fact there is an evil vicar who is also a ghost with creepy spiderwebs all over his face and his nose has rotted away. So, yeah, don’t look at that. Unfortunately, librarian William Garrett (Sacha Dhawan) does, while trying to find a copy of The Tractate Middoth for an anxious and borderline obnoxious patron. William collapses and retires to a village to recover.\n\nHe has excellent style as a man recovering from a serious shock. He has a blanket over his legs and everything. However, it turns out the house he is taking a room in is run by Mary Simpson (Louise Jameson) and her daughter Anne (Charlie Clemnow) and they just happen to be cousins of the nervous library patron. It seems their Uncle Thomas set out a nasty game for them to play and whoever wins inherits his estate. Meanwhile, the late Dr. Rant interferes with the game by appearing, and also assaulting everyone with his smell, dust and spider-webbed face.\n\nOct. 2. I watched an episode of Wynonna Earp with my friend alex. It was, “Jolene.” There is a demon whose whose destructiveness manifests in baking and vicious gossip. there is an unusual amount of banana liquer, a magnificent bar fight and some fun with Wynonna’s mom. Who I like a lot. She invents a cocktail called, “the don’t have a stealth wife while you’re doing my daughter, you enormous prick.”\n\nThis cocktail that appears to be vodka and banana liqueur. It seems appropriate.\n\nI was a bit confused by how Doc Holliday’s ritual worked. He created a protective circle around himself that appeared to be made of wood chips and bark. And he did it so he could tell off a demon. But, usually, you would stay in a protective circle what for protection or you would summon something nasty into the circle to protect yourself from it (and so you are not trapped in the circle forever). I mean, Peppermint Butler would consider this basic jazz. But Doc says his piece and then steps out. Maybe he’s using a ring of wood chips to Skype with a demon? Maybe wood chips amplify transmissions?\n\nOct. 3. Spirit of Evil / Viy (1967) has no problems with circles of protection. It is very straightforward. Though he specialized in philosophy at seminary school, there’s one thing that young priest Khoma learned, and that’s how to draw a protective circle around himself even when staggering drunk. Does he lie on the floor and sort of shove himself around to draw it sometimes? Yes, but it gets the job done.\n\nAfter Khoma and his friends encounter a witch over their school break, Khoma manages to escape after the witch rides him around like a horse, flies around on him and crashes. Khoma had remembered some exorcisms, but, you know, they were up in the air. He then beats the witch with a stick until she transforms into a young woman and tells him he is killing her. Khoma takes off. Unfortunately for him, the young woman is the daughter of an important Cossack official and she asked on her death bed for Khoma to pray over her body for 3 nights before she is interred. Her father sends burly comic relief to bring Khoma back, and his school is surprised, because Khoma is not their best priest unless by best you mean, best at slacking, drinking and seducing the ladies. But they send him with the men, who are generally friendly and sympathetic except when Khoma tries to escape.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nKhoma is played by Soviet Ryan Gosling Leonid Kuravlyov. And the young woman, Pannochka, is played by Natalya Varley. While I did enjoy the earlier witch business, the movie really picked up for me once Khoma is in the church with Pannochka’s body. Every night, after Khoma is locked in the church, Pannochka rises as the sun goes down. The first night, Khoma encounters many cats and soberly draws his circle. Pannochka cannot see and walks around the sanctuary reaching for Khoma. When she encounters his circle, she bangs on it, with Varley displaying remarkable mime skills. The camera whirls following her as she seeks a way in. But when the rooster crows, she floats back into her coffin and Khoma is allowed out. The second night is more intense as crows roost in the church and Pannochka rides her coffin like a surfboard, trying to ram her way into the circle.\n\nBy the third night, Khoma is thoroughly dispirited, though he tells him self that Cossacks fear nothing. Pannochka’s father will not let him off the hook. And everyone is sympathetic, because they know that something’s up with Pannochka, but they also believe Khoma is her only help of avoiding hell. Khoma tries to escape but is captured by Pannochka’s father’s men. He drinks and dances manically and tells himself that he just has to make it one more night and then he’ll be paid.\n\nBut the third night is even worse, as Pannochka summons German Expressionist spirits to aid her, including the fearsome Viy, who can see Khoma.\n\nSpirit of Evil / Viy was adapted from a Nikolai Gogol story, “Viy,” published in 1835. Serendipitously enough, Mario Bava’s Black Sunday was adapted from the same story, and while Spirit of Evil reminds me most of Expressionist horror in silent film, some of the lighting and styling in the church remind me of Bava.\n\nI also read Robert E. Howard “Spear and Fang” and I do not care for Howard’s depiction of Neandertals. Quit hanging our stuff on them. They were cool.\n\nOct. 4. I always forget how short Terence Fisher’s Horror Of Dracula (1958). I watched it with Drive-In Mob this year. Jonathan Harker is desperate to destroy Dracula before Dracula and his brides kill Harker. For his part, Van Helsing is hurrying over to save Harker. Harker is kind of bland and is 78% Paul Henreid. The brides have found freedom in wearing translucent drapes as sorta Greco-Roman gowns. And as always, I was taken with Van Helsing’s wardrobe. It is entirely possible that Christopher Lee’s Dracula hates Van Helsing because he is so consumed with satanically sartorial envy.\n\nI also watched Burnt Offerings (1976) as part of a CineJanes tweetalong. And I always forget this is a Dan Curtis (Dark Shadows; The Night Stalker) movie, because to me it feels very much like an Amicus Studios film. Marian Rolf (Karen Black), Ben Rolf (Oliver Reed), David Rolf (Lee Montgomery) and Aunt Elizabeth (Bette Davis) have rented an old home for the summer from the Allardyce siblings, Arnold, played by a remarkably and whimsically fey Burgess Meredith, and Roz (Eileen Heckart. The Allardyces are very likely off to New York visit their good friends, the Castevets. But the house is, of course, trouble. And the Allardyces have one condition, the Rolfs must feed, but never disturb an elderly woman who lives in the house. Marian eagerly agrees. And I have to say, as the house becomes more and more trouble, that I appreciate that Shirley Jackson’s Hill House never required Eleanor to do a lot of maintenance.\n\nOct. 5. The Ramsay Brother’s Saamri 3D (1985), it turns out, establishes the existence of a potential Ramsay Bros. cinematic universe. The character Saamri, aka Dharmesh Saxena, (Ajay Agarwal), appears in both Purana Mandir (1984) and Saamri, aka, Purana Mandir 2: Saamri. Saamri is a nice man who worships Kālī Mā and leaves his estate to his niece. Ne’er-do-wells want his property. One even holds a glass of liquor in his hand as he kicks poor Saamri over. He also wears a black leather jacket, because he is bad. With Saamri dead as an apparent suicide, the conspirators now try to murder Saamri’s niece Anju (Maria) and her sorta Mithun boyfriend, who wears a jacket similar to Michael Jackson’s in “Beat It.”\n\nSaamri 3D does have an old person secretly living in the house, but in this case it is the ghost/monster/corpse of Saamri himself brought back to take revenge on the people who have killed him. As his murderers move into his mansion, he is reanimated in his very own secret basement devoted to the goddess Kālī. And Saamri is much more spry than Mrs. Allardyce. She requires a constant stream of tourists to maintain herself and her house.\n\nBut there are two things to know about Saamri:\n\nThere is not one but two versions of Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” in an hour and a half, including one performed by odious comic relief uncle Jagdeep, who is thankfully hassled by a mummy in bloodied bandages.\n\nSaamri is in 3D.\n\nAnd it is a glorious 3D. Things are dangled in front of the camera. Things like maybe peppers? Definitely some kind of food. Things like the ends of canes.\n\nAnd most gloriously, one of the bad guys is attacked by the loyal bar stools and coffee tables in Saamri’s house. It is one of the finest moments in cinema history. And watching it, my heart was filled with joy.\n\nSaamri also has a creepy reaching hand like the best old dark house movies.\n\nOct. 6. While one guy dies and comes back for revenge in Saamri, nearly everybody dies and becomes a vengeful ghost in Nobuo Nakagawa’s Ghosts of Kasane Swamp (1957) Well, a lot of people die and most them end up as ghosts, usually out in the swamp, where a body is dumped and other people are murdered. But the whole thing is haunted by Oiwa from Yotsuya Kaidan. A blind masseur travels to a samurai’s house to ask to be repaid for a loan. He’s going to use some of the money to buy his daughter Orui, a shamisen. The samurai does not care to pay the masseur back and instead murders him and had a servant dump his body in the swamp. The servant tries to prevent curses and angry ghosts with chanting, but it doesn’t work. Everything goes to hell and both Orui (Katsuko Wakasugi) and the samurai’s son, Shinkichi (Takashi Wada), are doomed to cross paths and get married.\n\nOrui becomes the shamisen instructor of a young woman, Ohisa, who Shinkichi is in love with. Ohisa loves Shinkichi, too, but he has been raised as a servant in her family’s store after everything went to hell the first time. Orui is being pursued by a nasty swordsman and claims that she is in love with Shinkichi to get the man off her back–not knowing that Shinkichi is the son of the man who murdered her father. Then everything goes to hell again and Orui’s dad gives her a nasty infection around her eye reminscent of the nasty poisoned eye of Oiwa. Then it’s all flailing swords and thinking you’ve killed a ghost but you killed someone you love.\n\nIt’s an okay film, but it’s not my favorite Nakagawa. It’s not The Lady Vampire (1959).\n\nOct. 7. As part of a Spookoween read-a-long with my friend Keith, I read Robert E. Howard’s “Beyond the Black River” and it was unusual in that it was set at a time contemporary–or pretty contemporary–to Howard’s own. But it was also racist AF. And while he did compare the hero to a panther early on, it didn’t have, say, neandertals or Calvinist swordsman or barbarians to make up for it for me. Keith wisely read a story involving werewolves.\n\nThen I watched the second episode of The Good Place, season 3 and some Lucha Underground and felt a lot better. I’m really looking forward to Ivelisse, Son of Havoc and Joey Ryan’s trios matches. Also, more of Ted Dansen’s terribly accented “Australian librarian.”\n\nOct. 8. Yay, new Doctor Who!\n\nI liked her plenty!\n\nAnd that guy who put his tooth trophies on his face was just gross AF. No one likes your whole dental thing, Tim Shaw. Knock it off.\n\nI also teamed up with Beth to watch a Telugu movie, Shakti (2011). 27 years ago, Faux Ancient Egypt did something terrible. Now it’s 27 years later and it might happen again because of an eclipse. I don’t remember what the beef between Faux-gypt and India was, but it was serious and involved stealing the Rudra Trident and Jackie Schroff wearing a series of amazing damask jackets. Also, 27 years ago was 1984 in this movie, but it was also Faux Ancient Egypt times and NTR, Jr. is dressed up in a terrible wig like he’s in a fantasy kingdom where Jakie Shroff is dressed like a scheming vizier, which it is. Also there is camping in the present of 2011. Camping all over India from Rajasthan to the Himalayas while NTR, Jr. acts as both a money hungry guide to a bunch of pretty terrible friends and as the fantasy dance partner to Aishwarya (Ileana D’Cruz). Oh, and I don’t think it’s spoiling anything to say it turns out he’s also a secret agent. And the chosen champion of Kālī Mā. NTR, Jr. also plays his own father Rudra in the nearly forgotten times of 1984.\n\nAnd there is comic relief. But despite the odious comic relief, Shakti is not horror or maybe it is? Eyes are cut out and implanted in a kid. And there’s big ass battle axes like the one in Mandy. But mostly I spent almost 3 hours watching this and so I’m counting it. But I do recommend watching the dance numbers and fights on YouTube.\n\nI also read James Tynion IV, Marguerite Bennett, Steve Epting and Stephanie Hans’ Batwoman: The Many Arms of Death. Once again Kate Kane is dealing with spookyweirdness, this time with pirates! And an organization called, “Kali.” On one hand on one of my many arms, I am pleased that I didn’t know this trade paperback would involve “Kali” when I took it out of the library. It makes a serendipitous theme with Shakti. Bu my hands on my many other arms are filled with ambivalence. I’ll take the next volume out of the library and see how Bennett handle their potentially Thugee-adjacent story. (Really, guys, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom presents a terrible understanding of Kālī. And that goes for you, too, Indian directors. Except the Ramsay Bros. You guys keep on keeping on.\n\nOct. 9. I thought Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983) was out of print and that I would never actually see it, but when I picked up that collection of Batwoman comics, I saw Something Wicked This Way Comes on the dvd shelf. And so I took it right out. (I am really pleased with my branch’s immediate collection–they have both Colossal and The Duke of Burgundy right there. Use your library, people!)\n\nI have always had an uneasy relationship with Disney. I don’t really enjoy the wholesome, nostalgic hometown feel, but Something Wicked This Way Comes picks up with the arrival of evil train carrying Mr. Dark’s Pandemonium Carnival, come to offer people their heart’s desire. And then there’s Pam Grier in a spiderweb veil petting a tarantula. She’s wearing fantastic nail polish. Her sparkly hood reminds me both of Mildred’s haunting robe in Hatchet for the Honeymoon and possibly Ghosts of Kasane Swamp, (if I am making it a theme). I am tired of father and son nostalgia, though. But I stayed Pam Grier. In fact, I think maybe I’ll take over Mr. Dark’s Pandemonium Carnival and make a few changes. After all, as far as I can tell, Pam Grier does all the work while Mr. Dark takes all the credit. Time for a new barker in a top hat and cravat. One who isn’t a jerk. We want a balance here between the painfully wholesome nostalgia of the opening and the just plain jerkishness of “Ms. Pam Grier will suck out your tears for me.” I like spooky magical carnivals and they deserve better and more interesting management.\n\nI also watched an episode of Wynonna Earp, “If We Make It Through December.” Wynonna and Doc Holliday make terrible decisions. There is green goo.\n\nOct. 10. In an alternate reality, one in which ghosts exist and attack people, Kanti Shah’s Darwaza (2002) is an educational film shown to bored middle school students to teach them how to respond in the even of an actual ghost attack. Do you travel out to the mansion in the woods late at night with your party friends? No. Do you have your bed right in the living room? No. Do you let your bald, bearded friends wander off alone? Never. Should there be French doors leading directly to your bedroom/ living room? No.\n\nDarwaza is no great shakes, but there is a very enjoyable skeleton suit, a skull hand puppet wielded by a priest trying to exorcise the demon in a skeleton suit and creepy rubber mask and a possessed woman who still wears her club clothes but we know she is possessed because she is wearing the scary mask. And between Darwaza and Shakti, I feel like I have really come to appreciate the Ramsay Brothers. They do solid work and they get it done in 90 minutes. Or at lest they did in Saamri 3D.\n\nI also caught up on “Submitted for the Approval of the Midnight Society.” The Midnight Society is where famous and infamous horror writers gather to share their ideas. It makes me laugh and laugh.\n\n~~~\n\nPart II: Dracula, Prince of Darkness (1966); Buffy the Vampire Slayer; Sobrenatural / All of them Witches (1996); We Bare Bears; All The Colors Of The Dark (1972); Venture Bros.; Lucha Underground; The Regular Show; Muhyo and Roji’s Bureau of Supernatural Investigation, ep 1; Cold Hell (2017); Route 66; La Cabina (1972); MST3K: The Final Sacrifice; Delicious In Dungeon / Dungeon Meshi.\n\nPart III: Don’t Kill It (2016); Happy Hunting (2017); trailer for Suzzanna Berapa Dalam Kubur (2018); Ghost Stories for Christmas with Christopher Lee, “The Ash Tree” (2000); Delicious in Dungeon; Taste the Blood of Dracula (1970); Brides of Dracula (1960); Lemora: A Child’s Guide to the Supernatural (1973); Night Tide (1960); Ghost Stories with Christopher Lee, “A Warning to the Curious” (2000); Lights Out, “Paris Ball Macabre” (1943); Columbia Workshop, “Carmilla” (1940); The Curious Creations of Christine Donnelly (2018); The Haunting of Hill House (2018)."
