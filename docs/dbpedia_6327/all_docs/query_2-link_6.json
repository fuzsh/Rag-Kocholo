        "text": "Trying to get this restarted, so here are reviews of a few films we’ve watched recently. I didn’t use the original Indiewire list, as that has been reworked and no longer exists in the form that I had referred to a few years ago.\n\nFright Night (1985; dir. Tom Holland)\n\nWe finally watched the original Fright Night after having seen the 2011 remake years ago. And yes, Jerry Dandrige is THAT BITCH. The film opens with teenager Charley feeling up girlfriend Amy while a horror series Fright Night, hosted by supposed vampire killer Peter Vincent, plays in the background. Charley is not successful in getting Amy to take things to the next level. He lives alone with his single mom, Judy, and new neighbors have just moved in next door. Charley starts to observe strange things through his neighbor Jerry’s windows, and it’s starting to look like Jerry is a vampire. Of course Jerry denies everything and even charms his way into Charley’s home by sweet-talking Judy. The two engage in a back-and-forth struggle for the remainder of the film, while no one seems to believe Charley’s suspicions are true. Eventually, he enlists the help of Peter Vincent, who, you know, is not a vampire hunter but only plays one on TV. Antics ensue.\n\nThis was a really entertaining 80s movie with a great vampire character in Jerry Dandridge. He’s just so smug and so suave. He is very 80s bachelor. Charley is a likable enough hero, and his sidekick Evil is pretty hilarious. This is like Rear Window meets Dracula, and I’m here for it.\n\nThe Gorgon (1964; dir. Terence Fisher)\n\nFirst, shoutout to Daniel from The Cobwebs Channel on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/@cobwebschannel.\n\nWe have been binging his content and have started watching several of his recommendations lately. One of the first was The Gorgon, a Hammer production from 1964. In the early 1900s, people start turning up dead in this European village that exists in the shadow of a sketchy abandoned castle. Though at first, villagers want to believe the death of the pregnant Sacscha was a crime of passion, committed by her lover upon discovering she was expecting, it’s a little suspicious that her body looks like a literal statue. A few more victims are turned to stone, while the townsfolk grapple with what could be causing the strange events and vocally deny that there is a supernatural force at work in aforementioned dilapidated castle.\n\nThat brings us to Dr. Namaroff and his trusty assistant(?) Carla. Now, Namaroff is a man of science, and even though he’s seen the stone corpses and is familiar with the legend of the Gorgons, he’s not trying to hear that the potential answer to the recent crime wave is the last existing Gorgon, Megaera. Various blunderers try to prove the existence of Medusa’s surviving sis, and one, Professor Heitz, inexplicably falls madly in love with Carla. The plot unravels from there, as a shocking (ish) secret is revealed that solves the mystery while also claiming even more petrified victims.\n\nThe ambience of The Gorgon is immaculate. It has the Hammer film look and mood, for sure. It also has the questionable plot and borderline hysterical acting that characterize many of these productions. Yes, as Daniel of Cobwebs said, the practical effects of the Megaera creature are pretty weak, but they’re also lowkey hilarious, so I’m okay with that. This one was entertaining but not overly impressive in terms of the story or characters.\n\nWoodlands Dark and Deep: A History of Folk Horror (2021; dir. Kier-La Janisse)\n\nFeaturing interviews with directors, scholars, and horror enthusiasts, this is a thorough (over 3 hour runtime) look into the film subgenre of folk horror and examination of its key texts. The documentary begins with a section on the sort-of unholy trinity of British folk horror – Witchfinder General, The Blood on Satan’s Claw, and The Wicker Man – in which interview subjects attempt to extrapolate the consistent features of folk horror using these films. Next, we move into another section on British horror, then a fun section on witch-centric folk horrors, followed by a detailed section on American folk horror, which travels across various regions of the country and explores the histories that haunt each area. A fifth section covers international folk horror, revealing all of the interesting ways different cultures’ folk traditions and legends have been reworked and incorporated into the respective culture’s horror movies. Finally, there is a discussion of the recent resurgence of folk horror and where the genre goes from here.\n\nThis was both educational and entertaining, and even though it was long and we watched it over two sittings, I was never bored, and I would definitely watch it again. This is the kind of scholarship and analysis I can get behind and even makes me a little wistful for my former (pseudo) life in academia. The ideas about women in folk horror, namely in witch films, representing the threat and danger of female power and sexuality really resonated with me. I also enjoyed the various meditations on how folk horror engages with memory/cultural memory, with the past and its impact on the present and future, and with the age-old dichotomy of tradition and progress. We got lots of film recs from this doc too, and Doug loved the creepy folk music. The aesthetic was also flawless, such as the fonts used and the designs on the section slides. Can’t recommend enough. No notes.\n\nNext on the agenda, probably a bunch more folk horrors recommended in Woodlands Dark and Days Bewitched and making horror and Halloween my personality at least through mid-November.\n\nSince Halloween, I’ve watched quite a few horror movies, including many from the Indiewire list. Because there are so many here and I watched some of these a month or two ago, the reviews will be somewhat brief. And spoiler alert: I didn’t like many of the supposed “best” films on this list. The campier the better for me, apparently.\n\nThe Omen (1976; dir. Richard Donner)\n\nIndiewire’s Rank: 27\n\nIndiewire’s Blurb:\n\nThe first installment of “The Omen” trilogy still holds up as one of the eeriest movies of all time. It tells the story of an “innocent” young boy who, unbeknownst to himself and everyone around him — including his diplomat father and his wife— just might be the Antichrist. Preferring mood and atmosphere over shock and awe, and boasting some genuinely chilling scenes, including grisly death sequences — by hanging, decapitation and impalement — and a famously foreboding Oscar-winning score (led by its theme song “Ave Satani,” composed by Jerry Goldsmith) — the film presents a scenario that would be any parent’s worst nightmare. “The Omen,” aided by a solid cast led by an outstanding Gregory Peck, treats its subject seriously, which adds to its believability. The pale-faced Harvey Stephens as the devil child is sufficiently sinister. The film spawned two sequels, and a 2006 remake that should be avoided — at least not without seeing the original first. -TO\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/9/\n\nMy Take:\n\nLook, I know this is a classic and many horror afficionados will not appreciate this review, but this movie really didn’t do much for me. I didn’t find it scary, though the kid is definitely creepy, and it left no real impression. I can’t remember most of it, actually, but I felt like Damien’s origins and the plot in general were convoluted in a way that was not even interesting. Sorry not sorry?\n\nThe Hunger (1983; dir. Tony Scott)\n\nIndiewire’s Rank: 88\n\nIndiewire’s Blurb:\n\nIt’s hard to imagine anyone ever wanting to leave David Bowie behind, but that’s just what Catherine Deneuve does as the ethereal vampire Miriam in “The Hunger.” Although he was turned over 200 years prior and promised eternal life, Bowie’s John begins to age rapidly, causing him to realize eternal life doesn’t mean eternal youth. Repulsed by his appearance, Miriam spurns him and begins looking for a new conquest, which she soon finds in Sarah (Susan Sarandon), a doctor specializing in aging who was looking to help John. But Sarah isn’t as compliant as Miriam’s former lovers, and as Sarah struggles to adapt to her new way of life, it puts her in direct conflict with Miriam, threatening to expose her centuries-old secret. “The Hunger” is an atmospheric vampire film unlike any other. While much has been made about Sarandon and Deneuve’s steamy lesbian sex, the film is also known for its opening sequence, where John and Miriam are on the prowl for lovers they can turn into a meal. The iconic sequence later served as the inspiration for Lady Gaga’s introduction on “American Horror Story: Hotel.” -JR\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/3/\n\nMy Take:\n\nThis one may have had an unfair advantage because I generally like vampire movies and I love Bowie, but I found The Hunger far more entertaining and more tragic than some of the higher-ranking fare like The Omen or the original Halloween. To be fair, the high point of the film is its iconic opening scene at the goth club, where our vamps take in a performance by Bauhaus. This continues a theme in my viewing and reading of aspirational parties and outings. Of course, if you hook up with these two, it’ll probably be your last party.\n\nI’ve seen some criticism of this film as just stylish and cool but with little to no substance. And much is made of the Deneuve-Sarandon sex scene, but honestly, I found Sarandon’s character to be the dullest part of the film. What was completely horrifying in this movie was how quickly and drastically Bowie’s character begins to age and become basically hideous (not easy to do to Bowie). It’s also so tragic and so sad. Like, aren’t vampires supposed to live forever and to appear the same age for their immortal lives? Anyway, it’s a weird twist on the vampire genre that Miriam (Deneuve) gets to carry on century after century while her companions’ lives “end,” sort of. Don’t want to spoil it all, but their fates are horrifically claustrophobic. I felt like the themes of immortality and again, beauty and youth, and love/companionship made this more than a sexy music video with great make-up effects.\n\nHalloween (1978; dir. John Carpenter)\n\nIndiewire’s Rank: 5\n\nIndiewire’s Blurb:\n\nThere were plenty of horror movies before John Carpenter’s iconic slasher debuted in 1978, but “Halloween” found the perfect formula to transform the spooky holiday into an unforgettable one. With a pulsing theme, the perfect Final Girl in Jamie Lee Curtis’ Laurie Strode, and boogeyman who can’t seem to die, “Halloween” changed the genre forever. After inexplicably murdering his older sister on Halloween when he was just six, Michael Myers has spent most of his life in an asylum, but on a fateful Halloween night in 1978, he returns home to Haddonfield for a murderous rampage that terrorizes Laurie and her friends. With his disfigured face hidden behind a ghoulish white mask, Myers stalks and stabs his way through the film, impervious to both bullets and blows. Though Carpenter would technically kill him off in 1980’s “Halloween II,” Myers proved so popular he resurrected once more in 1988 to spawn an entire franchise still beloved by horror fans. -JR\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/11/\n\nAnother horror classic I had somehow never seen, Halloween did not live up to the hype. Yes, the music is iconic and great, but there’s not that much going on here, if we’re being honest. It was effed up that MM killed his sister for no apparent reason when he was a mere child, and he has spent his life since in a mental ward. However, most of what happens from that point is just so stupid that the movie loses most of its potential chilling effect. WHY would you ever be sending two hapless idiots to transport a dangerous patient/killer in the back of their car to begin with? And then when MM gets back to his hometown, that doctor who let him get away with the car at the asylum is completely useless as he stands watch outside Myers’ former childhood home. Meanwhile, Myers kills a bunch of idiot teenagers and chases Jamie Lee Curtis around a house. She somehow thinks she has killed him TWICE, and after the second time, she even has the audacity/stupidity to throw the knife near Myers’ body, as though she won’t need it again. The worst part is that this character is set up to be different from her peers because she is so smart and level-headed. I get that people might act differently under duress, but what was even the point of making her character this strong brainiac if she was going to fall apart and need to be saved by the doctor?\n\nMasque of the Red Death (1964; dir. Roger Corman)\n\nIndiewire’s Rank: 87\n\nIndiewire’s Blurb:\n\nIt’s incredible how much Roger Corman could get out of so little. This Edgar Allan Poe adaptation starring Vincent Price as the wickedly decadent nobleman Prince Prospero whose many sins come back to plague him (literally) is a masterpiece of production design. One sequence follows someone walking through a chain of linked rooms in Price’s castle and each room’s furnishings and wallpaper are entirely one eye-popping color. This is as much a film for the eyes as Argento’s “Suspiria” and “Inferno” but if the bold hues in those gorefests seem often unmotivated by the story, Corman’s bold stylistic choices serve a political message: that the indifferent one-percent puts so much time into a design for living that they’ve forgotten all purpose for living. -CB\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/3/\n\nMy Take:\n\nI have to agree with Indiewire’s writer here: Corman really did just take Poe’s story of the same title as a jumping off point and really went somewhere else (beyond?) with it. The story is fairly simple and straightforward, as Prince Prospero has a masquerade ball for his rich friends and locks them in to avoid exposure to the plague ravaging the outside world. Of course, death makes its way into the party and the ominous clock tolls the hours until the deaths of the partygoers. The film gives us an additional backstory that involves the poor villagers nearby and Prospero’s deep commitment to Satanism. I’m not sure why they had to go so far as the Satan worship practiced by Prospero and his wife; it was clear he was evil by his treatment of the peasants. Regardless, this movie was a strange experience that left me a bit baffled, but I think I enjoyed the weirdness the more I thought about it after. Seriously, though, what about that scene where the Prince tells these nobles at his castle to act like various animals and they just throw themselves into it like it’s their favorite game? WTF!\n\nThe Haunting (1963; Robert Wise)\n\nIndiewire’s Rank: 58\n\nIndiewire’s Blurb:\n\nAdapted by Nelson Gidding from the 1959 novel “The Haunting of Hill House” by Shirley Jackson (who suggested the film title), “The Haunting” stars Julie Harris as Eleanor, a shy woman who once experienced poltergeists. She joins a group organized by a paranormal investigator (Richard Johnson), including a mod lesbian psychic (Claire Bloom), and the son of the house’s current owner (Russ Tamblyn), to study a death-plagued abandoned haunted mansion. The filmmaker made the most of a much lower budget than “West Side Story” by taking the shoot to England. He used an experimental 30 mm wide-angle Panavision camera to unsettling effect to portray the film’s most memorable character — the house — from odd, jarring, dislocated angles, often showing Eleanor’s mentally unstable point-of-view. The crew bent walls, destabilized a spiral staircase, applied photo-sensitive makeup to make the actors look pale when they stood in a “cold spot,” delivered a jump scare when a missing woman’s head pops out, and most disturbing, “morphed” a woman from childhood to old age by photographing four actresses at different ages and uniting them with dissolves. While the movie received mixed reviews on release, it has built a cult following and is considered by many — including Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg — to be one of the scariest horror films of all time. Having seen it when it first came out, I for one am scarred for life. -AT\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/6/\n\nMy Take:\n\nI’m no Scorsese or Spielberg, obviously, so who am I to say, but I found this film to be deadly boring. I have been enjoying older films since we started our subscription to the Criterion Channel, I am a fan of Shirley Jackson, and I have loved “The Haunting of” series on Netflix based on the same novel from which The Haunting is derived. Though I admit that the angle of a susceptible person becoming intrigued (while simultaneously terrified) by a haunted house or other dark force is interesting, I did not feel at all connected to the Eleanor/Nell character here.\n\nDressed to Kill (1980; dir. Brian DePalma)\n\nIndiewire’s Rank: 68\n\nIndiewire’s Blurb:\n\nBrian De Palma was at the height of his powers as the master of pastiche when he made this riveting Hitchcockian horror tale about elevator murderers and people insecure in their own bodies. At first the story of a promiscuous woman (Angie Dickinson), “Dressed to Kill” borrows a page from “Psycho” by taking its apparent protagonist out of the picture after the first act. From there, the specter of a mysterious trans woman named Bobbi on a killing spree hovers throughout the story, as she stalks Liz (Nancy Allen) while a psychiatrist (Michael Caine) makes frantic attempts to warn the police about the threat at hand. The twist about Bobbi’s real identity is obvious to any engaged viewer, but De Palma’s stylish riff on slasher tropes uses the familiarity of its winding plot to deliver a brilliant meditation on fluid sexual identity — and the frustrations of being forced to suppress it — long before the concept had much visibility in popular culture. It’s a brilliant, risky examination of femininity, the terror involved in being the object of an insatiable male gaze, and what happens when latent desires remain underserved. No horror movie made today has the guts to go there. -EK\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/5/\n\nYes, as Indiewire and others have said, there are obvious echoes of Psycho in the shower scenes and the fairly early disappearance of who seemed to be the protagonist. The good news, though, is that the character who becomes the protagonist — Liz — is far more interesting and entertaining (she’s sassy!). There is some pretty grisly violence in this one and the mystery (well, depends on how long it takes you to figure out who it is, I guess) of who this killer really is works with that violence to fit this thriller into the horror genre, as well. To me, the visuals, the complete craziness of some of the scenes, and the rapport between Liz and the police investigator (Dennis Franz) made this one a great watch.\n\nThe Devil’s Backbone (2001; Guillermo del Toro)\n\nIndiewire’s Rank: 34\n\nIndiewire’s Blurb:\n\nThe magic of Guillermo Del Toro’s filmmaking is his ability to mix terror and wonder in a way that heightens both emotions without ever feeling trite. Set during the Spanish Civil War (it was shot in Spain and backed by Pedro Almodovar), this ghost story is told from the perspective of Carlos (Fernando Tielve), a 12-year-old boy who is a new arrival at an ominous orphanage after his father was killed in the war. Carlos, haunted by visions of a mysterious apparition, tries to piece together the mystery of what happened the night a bomb hit the orphanage’s courtyard (but strangely didn’t explode) and a young boy (who now haunts the house) was killed. The film is more unsettlingly creepy than edge-of-your-seat scary, revealing the true horror is being a child during wartime. Del Toro has called “Backbone” his most personal film. -CO\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/8/\n\nMy Take:\n\nSo there is a ghost, but beyond that, there isn’t much to qualify this film as a “horror movie.” It strikes me as more of a dark fantasy, which really is more in keeping with Del Toro’s style anyway. I think his best film is Pan’s Labyrinth, and I also enjoyed Crimson Peak. This one was worth seeing but doesn’t rank as highly for me as the others. As Indiewire points out, the “horror” here, much like in Pan’s Labyrinth, revolves around wartime and specifically being a child or growing up surrounded by the violence and uncertainty of war. The fantasy vibe starts early on, when the young protagonist Carlos arrives at the orphanage and sees the unexploded (and since defused) bomb that is lodged in the courtyard. He soon discovers the orphanage’s ghost, Santi, and starts to unravel the mystery of his death and what other students and adults at the orphanage know about Santi’s supposed “disappearance” (there is a rumor that he ran away). The film has an extremely tragic ending, and I will say that I had no idea how evil the villain of this movie actually would become until close to that ending.\n\nA Tale of Two Sisters (2003; dir. Kim Jee-Woon)\n\nIndiewire’s Rank: 64\n\nIndiewire’s Blurb:\n\nKorean horror has provided some of the greatest scares in recent years, and “A Tale of Two Sisters” is another wonderfully warped and terrifying entry, filled with vengeful ghosts and surprising twists. A young girl, Su-mi, returns home to her father’s secluded estate after a stay in a mental institution. She is happy to be reunited with her younger sister, Su-yeon, but less than pleased to see her stepmother, Eun-joo. Eun-joo was once a nurse for the girls’ dying mother, and there is mutual resentment between the girls and their stepmother. When Eun-joo begins lashing out at the girls, targeting Su-yeon especially, their father is blind to the abuse, setting up a brutal conflict that will cause painful secrets to surface, threatening to drive a wedge between the two sisters for good. “A Tale of Two Sisters” is a psychological thriller that pulls the rug from beneath viewers more than once, foregoing the more obvious twists and reveals for a truly heartbreaking ending that will make you want to rewatch the film all over again. -JR\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/5/\n\nMy Take:\n\nThis one has a few good scares, but it is more like a mind-bending thriller/family drama than “horror.” The film is full of surprises and is downright confusing at times. The family dynamic is very strange, and it even takes a while to figure out for sure that the sisters’ mom has died and this is a stepmother who apparently used to be their mother’s nurse acting as their caretaker. The father is largely absent or clueless, so we mostly see the strained and toxic relationship between the female characters. As in Goodnight, Mommy, it is unclear whose reality is “true.” Since we also know the protagonist is returning from a mental hospital, it is implied she may be a kind of unreliable narrator, but she is also made sympathetic from the start, so it’s easy to believe what she sees through her lens. Though the film kept my attention, I think there were too many twists near the end.\n\nNight of the Hunter (1955; dir. Charles Laughton)\n\nIndiewire’s Rank: 105\n\nIndiewire’s Blurb:\n\nWhat if you can’t trust the people who’re supposed to protect you? If you’re a kid, there’s nothing scarier than if the protectors in question are your parents. Young John and Pearl’s father (Peter Graves) is a bank robber and murderer who hid the $10,000 he stole in a location only his kids know. His deranged cellmate, a serial killer (Robert Mitchum) who poses as a preacher to marry women, take their money, and then kill them, learns that these tykes know where the loot is. Upon release, he moves to their town, courts their weak-willed mother (Shelley Winters), and starts menacing his new stepchildren. What follows becomes a chase thriller more than an actual horror movie — in a list of just great films, “Night of the Hunter” might appear at a loftier ranking than just 105 — but it does capture a unique strand of kid horror. You know kid horror. It’s the fear you felt when you saw the Huntsman prepare to plunge a dagger into Snow White’s heart, and then (at least in the Disney version) her expressionistic flight through the woods. It’s the chill that ran down your spine when it dawned on you what happened to Bambi’s mother. Once the chase is under way, director Charles Laughton deploys fairy-tale-like imagery: the kids, on a raft, pass a bullfrog in closeup. There’s a sense of clarity and wonder to these images (photographed by “Magnificent Ambersons” DP Stanley Cortez) like we’re in a Disney animated film come to life… with all the sense of dread that entails. Then Mitchum can be heard in the distance singing “Leanin’” and you know death is near. Chilling. –CB\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/\n\nMy Take:\n\nHonestly, I really did not like this film. It was not at all what I expected, but that’s not always a bad thing. In this case, the film was overly sappy and moralizing, though I have to credit Robert Mitchum for his performance because the preacher is a total effing creep. I thoroughly hated him from the start, and since I think we’re supposed to feel that way, I suppose the film is successful to a degree. I know they were kids, but the children’s characters were SO frustrating, especially Pearl, who would keep trying to assist stepdaddy murderer and even went over to hug him when dude discovered them at the weird Bible school halfway house where they are taken in and fed by old lady Rachel. She also sings creepy religious tunes and sits at the window with her shotgun. I have heard people say this is one of the best and most underappreciated films of its era, but I have to admit I just don’t get it.\n\nBonus Horrors!\n\nThe Devil Doll (1936; dir. Tod Browning)\n\nI had never heard of this film until I read the absolutely batshit crazy summary of it on Criterion Channel. And then, of course, I had to check it out, and let me tell you, even that summary doesn’t capture the madness of this film’s plot. So these two men escape from prison and make it to one of the men’s home where his wife (and some angry dogs) greets them. The husband is eager to check up on the science lab and the experiment he and wifey started before his imprisonment. We learn that their project is to shrink living creatures to a fraction of their actual size, apparently to eventually make the food supply last longer? This is a horrible plan. So far they have turned some of their dogs into miniatures, which they show prisoner 2, soon to be the protagonist, Paul Lavond. The little doggies function on mind control and can move their bodies accordingly but have no independent mental capability. This is obviously highly unethical, but that doesn’t stop them from wanting to try it on humans next. The first victim is the girl who has recently served as a maid in the household and has no family (so no one will be looking for her — perfect!). Around this time, original Frankenstein husband randomly dies and the project is commandeered by Paul, who wants revenge on the three bastards who landed him in jail.\n\nEven though the original m.o. for this science experiment is bad on its own, Paul’s motive is even worse: totally selfish and absurd. However, I can’t deny it also makes for some hilarious scenes — like the one in which he stares intensely to psychologically control the little former maid as she throws jewelry down from another character’s bedroom window. Then there is the cross-dressing grandma angle, which easily fools everyone, and they are just as quickly charmed by his creepy af “lifelike” dolls — oh, that’s right, THEY ARE ACTUAL PEOPLE. Another subplot ensues involving Paul’s daughter who thinks the worst of him and basically disowns him as a criminal and absent father. Meanwhile, bride of Frankenstein Malita is not happy with Paul’s new use of her and Frankenstein’s science, so she almost kills him but instead kills herself as she blows up the lab. From there, Paul just needs to (sort of?) make amends with his daughter and apparently go end his own life. The ending is not great, but the rest of the film is just so insane that it’s worth a watch.\n\nInferno (1980; dir. Dario Argento)\n\nThis is another one that is so crazy it’s laughable and entertaining. It’s not as good as Suspiria but has some of the original’s charms, like the colors and the score. The plot is basically that a young woman finds a weird witch book in an antique store and learns about the gateways of the three mothers — and she thinks she is living in one of the buildings, the one associated with the Mother of Darkness. She, of course, goes on an ill-conceived mission that lands her in a watery hole under her New York street. Meanwhile, her brother is in Rome (guess what, that’s where the gate to the Mother of Tears is) and is seen in this classical music lecture where sketchy girl with cat (above) stares at him for no apparent reason. Here we also meet Sara, who will fall into the Three Mothers investigative trap after reading Rose’s (Mark’s sister) letter. The plot is pretty convoluted, but I liked this one because some of its scenes are just so weird and hilarious. The ending, where the title finally kind of makes sense, is truly hysterial (look for and appearance by a Spirit Halloween quality costume). I don’t know (I mean, I doubt it) if this is supposed to be a funny movie, but if you like campy weirdness with cool music and visuals, I’d recommend Inferno.\n\nThe Phantom of the Paradise (1974; dir. Brian DePalma)\n\nApparently, I am a DePalma fan because two of my favorite films in this blog entry are by the director. I did not know this film existed until five minutes before I watched it, but man, where has this one been all my life? There are so many allusions to classic Gothic literature and film and musicals — Faust, Frankenstein, The Picture of Dorian Gray, and obviously the originaly Phantom of the Opera that the title reworks — so that’s an obvious plus for me. The main character Winslow is an earnest composer trying to get someone to listen to his magnum opus, but the pop music landscape is dominated by chumps like “The Juicy Fruits,” a nostalgia act that performs cheesy 50’s music. Winslow’s work is SERIOUS; he does not appreciate the suggestion that his work may be performed by those amateurs. Long story, short, Winslow’s work is stolen and will be used in the opening of the performing arts center, The Paradise. He tries to claim his ownership of the movie, ends up in jail, escapes from jail, is disfigured, and transforms into the Phantom of the Paradise. He will only let his music be used by producer Swan if his chosen singer, Phoenix, is the leading lady.\n\nOf course, Winslow is betrayed again, and this dude above — Beef — is cast as the lead in the performance. Beef is the best part of the movie. Amazing. Anyway, he is unjustly killed off during the performance because he is intimidated back into performing even though the Phantom has threatened his life. The show itself is insane, as is the aftermath. Phoenix hooks up with Swan, becomes a huge star, and forgets Winslow. This make W very VERY angry, and he gets his revenge in a show-stopping finale that is meant to be Swan’s and Phoenix’s televised wedding. Again, the theme here is the campier the movie, the more I like it, so this one is high on my list of faves from the last few months.\n\nRecap: Best of the Bunch\n\nMy favorites, in no particular order: The Phantom of the Paradise, Dressed to Kill, and The Devil Doll\n\nMy least favorites: The Omen, The Haunting\n\nI had expected to get more of the top horrors in as we approached Halloween, but between craziness at school (and the accompanying exhaustion) and a power outage from Hurricane Zeta, I only watched a few. I’m going to rank the films watched from the list and my favorite horror movies of all time in a separate post.\n\nBlack Christmas (1974; dir. Bob Clark)\n\nIndiewire’s rank: 67\n\nIndiewire’s blurb:\n\nBob Clark is perhaps best known for his other holiday-themed film, “A Christmas Story,” but 1974’s “Black Christmas” deserves just as much attention. Set in a sorority house over Christmas break, a group of college women are stalked and slowly picked off by a deranged killer hiding inside the abode. The plot sounds formulaic, but “Black Christmas” remains timeless thanks to its terrifying and elusive killer, “Billy,” whose backstory is never revealed, as well as a foreboding ending that doesn’t offer much hope for the film’s Final Girl, Jess. But beyond this, “Black Christmas” is also remarkably feminist for its time, as Jess chooses an abortion and a career over being locked into a loveless relationship. Likewise, the terror felt by the women as they are plagued by obscene phone calls makes it clear that some horrors are all too common, and don’t require a boogeyman in a mask. -JR\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/5/\n\nMy take:\n\nThe was an entertaining slasher film that stood out from other horrors for two main reasons: the Christmas setting and, as Indiewire’s JR notes above, its feminist bent. Sure, the sorority house environment and the presence of a house mother (albeit an alcoholic one — but really, how else to live with a bunch of young college women?) feel somewhat date; however, the women in the house seem to have embraced the sexual revolution and hold mostly liberated attitudes toward gender roles and relations. For example, one character becomes pregnant and tells her boyfriend she will abort the child because she wants to focus on her career, and the most dramatic part of it is how dramatically the boyfriend bombs his piano recital because he can’t handle that choice being up to his girlfriend rather than himself.\n\nAll that said, I think that for a female viewer, the way the killer preys on young women, hides in their house, and begins his stalking through making threatening, sexually harassing phone calls, strikes at very real fears. Though the problem is not resolved by any means, our culture is at least more aware of the threats women face from men because of perceptions about women’s sexuality, because of their rejection of men’s advances, and because of the ever-present possibility of being cat-called or verbally or physically assaulted. It’s pretty scary, though, that a woman in 2020 can still clearly understand what is so frightening about the predicament of these sorority sisters. I have to also mention, as Indiewire does, this film has a nice twist ending that keeps the intensity and horror going until the credits roll.\n\nAll serious commentary aside, can we take a minute to appreciate the missing student’s boyfriend’s ridiculous fur coat? It’s the lowkey star of the film.\n\nI Saw the Devil (2011; dir. Kim Jee-Woon)\n\nIndiewire’s rank: 43\n\nIndiewire’s blurb:\n\nA visually canny director with a sharp sense of humor, Kim adeptly plays with genres, from his sixth film, the wacky Oriental western hit “The Good, The Bad, and the Weird” to serial killer thriller “I Saw the Devil,” which also stars Lee Byung-hun. This time, Lee is a homicide detective on the hunt for a brilliant serial killer who whacked his pregnant wife in a haunting opening sequence. This movie is not for the squeamish — Kim takes the violence about as far as anyone ever has, bringing you along for the ride via intricate tracking cameras as the detective starts to emulate the insane devil he is chasing. This vengeance plot, with all its gore and evil, is in the service of art. And it’s funny, too, as the detective and the killer engage in a strange game of one-upmanship. Despite being hit with restrictive ratings for violence in Korea, cutting some of the violence and limiting the theaters where it could play, the movie was a monster hit. Kim was able to keep more horror in the international version. -AT\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/7/\n\nMy take:\n\nHere’s another film with an excessive focus on violence against women, but then again, I guess that is fairly common in horror films. I generally really enjoy foreign films and foreign horrors because they sometimes offer more surreal, weirder atmospheres, and off-the-wall plot devices and characters. There’s less reliance on jump scares and gore and more interest in psychology (not to say that no American films do this). All that said, you’d think I would’ve really liked I Saw the Devil, which examines the psychological effects on the protagonist after he loses his wife to a serial killer and then seeks revenge on said killer. The protagonist’s actions become more and more questionable, less and less ethical, as he devolves into a kind of grief-driven (or maybe avoidance-of-grief-driven) madness.\n\nThe problem with this movie, for me, is that the point is fairly obvious, but the film itself is super long and drawn out (over two hours running time). The killer’s identity is revealed early, and the wife’s murder is committed in the first 20 or so minutes of the film. There are some truly gruesome images in this film, and obviously it’s scary to think how far a person can and will go to avenge a loss of a loved one. However, this protagonist is not established as particularly relateable or sympathetic early on, so it was hard to care about him and his mission. Instead, it was horrifying to see how little concern he seemed to have for other people whom he put in danger as pawns in his game with the killer. And obviously his revenge wasn’t even fulfilling, as at the end of the film, he still finally has to face his grief, now compounded by the horrors he himself has committed or allowed to happen.\n\nRosemary’s Baby (1968; dir. Roman Polanksi)\n\nIndiewire’s rank: 3\n\nIndiewire’s blurb:\n\nUnsettling from the moment Mia Farrow starts singing over those haunting opening credits, Roman Polanski’s masterpiece digs its claws into you and leaves as ghastly a mark as it does on Rosemary herself. Evil isn’t an unknowable entity in this still-timely tale of a woman being gaslit by her husband and neighbors; it’s the Satanist next door. Pregnancy is stressful enough when there isn’t a coven of witches chanting in the night, and it’s made doubly distressing by poor Rosemary’s suspicions that they’ve made a pact with Lucifer involving her unborn child. So cerebral in its approach to psychological horror that it deserves a PhD, “Rosemary’s Baby” has only grown more uncomfortable with time — and not just because we know more about Polanski now than we did 50 years ago. -MN\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/11/\n\nMy take:\n\nI really liked this one, though I didn’t find it particularly scary. I love movies and books about witchcraft, covens, magic (I mean, not Satanism, but in this case, they get conflated), and it was pretty gratifying to discover that the freaky elderly neighbors are actually literally Satan-worshipping witches. Some of the films I’ve watched from the 60s and 70s are so entertaining because of the sheer weirdness, something we don’t get as much of in contemporary cinema. Maybe it was the LSD, but either way, thank you 60s and 70s for surreal oddities like Rosemary’s Baby.\n\nI felt like the writing and story were pretty clever (not sure how much is the Ira Levin novel and how much is the film): the actor husband who is so self-centered that he’d sacrifice his own “firstborn” to advance his career (I mean, I guess technically it was Satan’s child, but the hubby made a deal with the devil, so…); the kooky neighbors who end up being literally evil; the gaslighting, ooh — don’t get me started. The weirdest thing might be the suggestion at the end of the movie not that the baby is actually Satan’s spawn — since that seemed like it could’ve been a dream and not reality — but that Rosemary rocks the baby like she’s actually thinking about mothering the creature. What is this ending saying about the proverbial “mother’s love” or the detriments of gaslighting? I liked this one not only because of the weirdness and the atmosphere but also because of the psychological elements.\n\nShout out to one of the unsung heroes of 60s-70s film: the random and utterly strange parties. This film also features some gatherings of the most eccentric kind: why are these people hanging out with each other? How did they meet? What are they wearing? We see this in Rosemary’s Baby more that once but most famously in the Satan party (baby shower?) at the end of the film. The parties in The Exorcist similarly combined random groups of people: actors and priests? What? The Tenant, another Polanski film, also featured gatherings of randos in the protagonist’s apartment. I have nothing of significance to say about the parties other than that they are an added bonus of these films.\n\nAs school-year exhaustion has combined with the ever-distressing political situation in the U.S., I have found that recently I just don’t have the energy to watch many films. Since I didn’t watch many toward the end of September, I am combining those with the ones I’ve watched so far this month. I have managed to view some of those in Indiewire’s top 20, so we’re getting into the heavy hitters now.\n\nThe Exorcist (1973; dir. William Friedkin)\n\nIndiewire’s Rank: 4\n\nIndiewire’s Blurb:\n\nNearly half a century after its release, “The Exorcist” remains one of the scariest movies ever made for one reason — there is a primal discomfort from the contrast between an innocent young girl and the demon possessing her soul. Linda Blair’s seminal performance as 12-year-old Regan, whose head twists around and spews vomit as she unleashes disturbing laughter and unfiltered vulgarities, embodies the idea that nothing is sacred. Even the prospects of a Bible-toting Max von Sydow doesn’t guarantee that everything will turn out rosy for poor Regan and her family. Friedkin, who was hardly exclusive to the horror genre, approaches William Peter Blatty’s novel with the same sophistication he brought to innumerable other genres at the height of his career. One of the most profitable movies in history, “The Exorcist” gave birth to has birthed several sequels and a television series, but none of them have matched the clarity with which the original unravels the mythology of upper-middle-class America with in such profound, disturbing moments so credible that even Friedkin came out of the experience as a true believer. Decades later, his exorcism documentary “The Devil and Father Amorth,” about the inspiration for the character in the movie, proved just how much this seminal achievement continues to haunt its maker — and generations of moviegoers as well. -EK\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/11/\n\nMy Take:\n\nHow is it that I had never seen The Exorcist (or, see below, Texas Chainsaw and Silence of the Lambs)? I don’t really know, but of course I have heard repeatedly that it’s maybe the scariest movie ever made. That may have been true in the early 1970s, or maybe it’s because of all of the tragedy that befell those associated with the movie and added to its legend status. However, as a viewer in 2020, some of the elements of the film are definitely dated, and I did not find it particularly frightening. Sure, it’s scary that Regan morphs fairly quickly from a normal, sweet kid to an evil demon, but I honestly found her spewing of vomit and profanity more laughable than bone-chilling.\n\nCertainly the effects have not aged that well, but I am also noticing that in older films, the acting style is, to my eye, over the top and sometimes cheesy. I am not, like other viewers, so impressed by Ellen Burstyn’s performance as Chris to believe her worthy of acting awards. And then there are all the strange narrative threads, like the backstories of the two priests — the one played by Max von Sydow that begins the film and the one about the younger priest whose mother dies and whose guilt becomes fuel for the tween demon. Obviously, the director (and writer of the novel, I presume) wants to emphasize how secular even the priesthood has become, or maybe how much the vocation has evolved, and that is mildly interesting, but it didn’t seem to be that deep either.\n\nDon’t even ask me what the deal is with the detective who keeps trying to get priests to go watch movies with him. Or why the closing scene of the film is the detective propositioning a second priest for a movie date. Or what the dynamic is in this Georgetown community where film stars and clergymen party together. All in all, I’m glad I finally saw the movie to evaluate for myself what all the hype is about, and I get why it is important for the horror genre, but it didn’t impress me as much as I expected.\n\nThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974; dir. Tobe Hooper)\n\nIndiewire’s rank: 2\n\nIndiewire’s Blurb:\n\nThe 1970’s changed the horror genre forever, and Tobe Hooper’s “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre” was the catalyst. A group of friends stumble upon a literal house of horrors in Texas, filled with a deranged family of cannibals led by one of horror’s most terrifying villains, Leatherface, clad in a mask stitched together from human skin. By escaping the clutches of the chain saw-wielding Leatherface, Sally became horror’s first Final Girl, a survivor who emerges from a chrysalis of terror to become a blood-soaked angel of vengeance. Although Final Girls have undergone several empowering transformations over the years, the trope remains one of horror’s greatest feminist accomplishments. Like J.R.R. Tolkein’s Éowyn, who defiantly declares “I am no man” before slaying the seemingly indestructible Lord of the Nazgûl, Final Girls have destroyed some of horror’s biggest boogeymen, thanks to the path paved by Hooper’s Sally. -JR\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/11/\n\nMy Take:\n\nAnother classic that I’d never seen, Texas Chainsaw was definitely more disturbing to me than The Exorcist. There is a mood of dread and danger that pervades the movie from early on, namely when Nubbins Sawyer hitches a ride with the teens who will soon be murdered by his brother, the infamous horror villain Leatherface. This film doesn’t waste any time getting to the killing, to the point where most of the cast is done away with early enough that I was wondering how the film would manage to fill the remaining 40 minutes or so. And the killings are brutal and gory.\n\nSo the last 30-40 minutes basically involves the “final girl” Sally being chased by Leatherface, seemingly escaping but only being lured into the trap by another family member, and then being tortured in the house of depravity where her friends have previously been slaughtered. She has to suffer physical torture and intimidation, and she is also introduced to the corpse (okay, I assumed he was a corpse, but according to the TCM fandom wiki, he is just really really old) of grandpa who “attempts” to hit her on the head with a hammer. This is where the movie became almost unbearable for me because of the incessant screaming of the main charater, played by Marilyn Burns. I suppose this makes the film effective, but it was also super annoying.\n\nSomehow Sally manages to escape (I actually didn’t know the outcome of the film and was pretty sure they were going to die) and hitch a ride down an empty Texas highway away from the cannibalistic maniacs. Apparently the Sawyer family is what happens when you mix a legacy of slaughterhouse experience with severe mental illness.\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs (1991; dir. Jonathan Demme)\n\nIndiewire’s rank: 18\n\nIndiewire’s Blurb:\n\nHannibal Lecter was already a known cultural quantity when Jonathan Demme came on board to direct the second film to feature the murderous Thomas Harris creation, but the canny pairing of Anthony Hopkins as the serial killer and Jodie Foster as the bright-eyed FBI agent on his tail turned him into nothing less than a cultural touchstone. Aided by chilling catchphrases (surely, fava bean stock dropped after the film debuted, right?) and a cadre of natty prison duds (plus human-flesh face-mask), Hopkins poured his prodigious talents into every inch of Lecter’s chilling frame. It’s never entirely clear what he’s thinking, and while Demme kits out his film with enough other elements to keep it chugging right along, from Foster’s full-bodied turn to Buffalo Bill doing his own thing with literal full bodies, it’s always clear that he’s the one pulling each string. The film would be formidable enough if it was just another serial killer thriller, but Demme, Hopkins, and Foster push it to go deeper at every moment, eventually finding that real terror doesn’t always have a reason, but it does have a taste. -KE\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/10/\n\nMy Take:\n\nThis one definitely kept me engaged and invested, and I ultimately found it both scarier and more interesting than either Exorcist or Texas Chainsaw. Even without the Indiewire list, I have had Silence on my list since watching the NBC series Hannibal, and while I loved Mads Mikkelsen as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, I get why some people can only associate the character with Anthony Hopkins. Hannibal is such a complex character, both in the film and in the tv series, so here we see Clarice being drawn to him despite his heinous crimes and slippery persona, just as Will is attracted to Mikkelsen’s Hannibal on the show. And the viewer can’t help being fascinated by him either, even though he literally chews a man’s face and then skins said face to wear so he can pretend to be one of the cops he has murdered in his plot to escape his modified prison cell (side note: those cops are complete idiots to step into Hannibal’s cell — come ON!).\n\nAt first there seems to be a lot, maybe too much, going on — there is Clarice and her rising status in the program (because yes, she’s still only a student); Clarice’s memories of her father’s murder and the whole lamb slaughtering thing; the kidnapping of Catherine Martin, who later turns out to be the daughter of a senator; and the investigation into the serial killer Buffalo Bill. The most interesting scenes in the film are the conversations between Clarice and Hannibal, and it is through those dialogues that many of the film’s themes emerge. Of course, there is Clarice’s memory about trying to run away and hearing the lambs being/about to be slaughtered, which Hannibal infers becomes part of her motivation for trying to save Catherine (saving Catherine will “silence the lambs,” aka her trauma). The ironic thing, though, is that if Clarice becomes an FBI agent, which she does at the end, she will become part of countless cases of people she actually cannot save, so there’s unlikely to be an end to these callbacks to her trauma.\n\nIn another conversation, Hannibal tries to focus Clarice’s thinking on the idea of “coveting” as a motive for murder, specifically for Buffalo Bill’s brutal crimes, in which he skins victims (as it turns out, he wants to sew together a human suit to wear?). At least the way I read it, the film suggests that BB coveted this woman close to him, the first victim who is found third, Frederika. Or maybe Clarice just takes it that way. However, BB covets their identities as women, right? That is why he is making the skin suit, to become them. I assume some viewers now would think of this film as transphobic because it demonizes this character who cross-dresses and apparently desires to be or feels that he truly is a woman. His crimes are obviously inexcusable, but I would be curious to hear whether attitudes toward Silence have evolved at all over time. As in many crime films, there are some connections made by characters that seem too easy, and solutions reach that feel too quick. Ultimately, though, the film was tense and suspenseful and served up enough gore and evil to qualify it as an effective horror.\n\nCat People (1942; dir. Jacques Tourneur)\n\nIndiewire’s Rank: 15\n\nIndiewire’s Blurb:\n\nProducer Val Lewton’s films were about creating low-budget B-movie horror with cinema, and Jacques Tourneur was his greatest practitioner, adding a layer of evocative style that few A-pictures of the day could match. Tourneur’s “Cat People” uses the camera and sound to create the presence of a supernatural force without even showing it. Take this example of the pool scene and how its sense of an ominous, lurking presence is built with framing, subjectivity, and editing. Then, like with his classic noir “Out of the Past,” Tourneur employs cinematography that takes an eerily and sexually charged atmosphere that brings the film’s unusual premise — a Serbian woman (Simone Simon) who is convinced she descends from cats and transforms into one when aroused or angered — to life. -CO\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/10/\n\nMy Take:\n\nI was really excited to watch this one, but ultimately was underwhelmed. The premise is interesting, and I just felt like this film had the potential to be so much crazier than it was. The psychology angle was intriguing, raising the question of whether Irena IS a cat or just FEELS like she is a cat, but the film answers this question in the most literal way. There are some good scenes, and the main character is super weird, but the movie disappointed, especially because I was hoping Irena would get revenge on Ollie and Alice. What was this man even doing marrying Irena? Ugh.\n\nOthers (not on the list):\n\nWe Summon the Darkness (2020; dir. Marc Meyers)\n\nThis film is categorized as horror/comedy, and I watched it because a YouTuber I follow (Darren VanDamme of Flick Connection) said it was a movie that tries and succeeds at recreating the B-movie vibe. The film is set in the 1980s and follows a few young woman who appear to be metalheads as they take a road trip to attend a heavy metal concert by the fictional band Soldiers of Satan. There is a twist fairly early in the movie that I won’t give away; it was surprising but probably happens too soon, as the film loses some steam after that point. It was entertaining enough, but nothing special.\n\nThe Iron Rose (1973; dir. Jean Rollin)\n\nI liked this movie, though I’m not sure I could clearly articulate why. This is another I had never heard of until recommended by a YouTuber named Emma, aka Spooky Astronauts, on a list of bizarre films. She described The Iron Rose as a film in which not much happens, and that’s probably true. A young woman and a young man who don’t seem to know each other well go on a date. They end up at a cemetry and go in to have a picnic and explore. Heathen that he is, the young man decides to descend into a grave/tomb to check it out, and these two actually end up having sex in there. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that the woman is drawn to the cemetery and is possibly even keeping them there, even though she seems afraid at first. On the other hand, the man becomes increasingly paranoid, especially after dark, feeling trapped and eventually being lured to his death by the woman who traps him in the grave. I am not sure I could begin to explain the signficance of the beach scenes or of the iron rose itself, but this one was intriguing and fun to watch.\n\nLes Diaboliques (1955; dir. Henri-Georges Clouzot)\n\nThe premise of this film is that a wife and mistress unite to murder the husband/lover they share. Yes, this is a French film, but even for the French, that seems a bit cozy for two women banging the same guy. Luckily, there is a late twist that I didn’t see coming for most of the movie, so it was very effective. This film was suspenseful and kept my attention. The murder scene itself is pretty brutal, and some of the details that pile up and create the mystery or whether the man is still alive or is haunting the women, or the women are simply losing their minds (namely the wife), are quite chilling. This and Silence of the Lambs were probably the two best I’ve watched for this post.\n\nAs I mentioned in my post from August, I am currently trying to watch the titles on Indiewire’s list of “Greatest Horror Movies of All Time” between now and Halloween. This post includes reviews of the movies I watched in the first half of September.\n\nThe Spiral Staircase (1946; dir. Robert Siodmak)\n\nIndiewire’s ranking: 51\n\nIndiewire’s blurb:\n\n“There’s no room in the whole world for imperfection,” the main villain declares. He’s a serial killer who’s been on a spree murdering women who are disabled. And now he’s targeting a young maid (Dorothy Maguire) who’s mute — we know she’s in his sights because we see her from his point-of-view. When he looks at her, he sees her face without a mouth entirely, much like the image of Keanu Reeves with his mouth sealed shut in “The Matrix.” Director Robert Siodmak conceived a visual language for murderous hate here — the villain is so intolerant of anyone he views as less than “perfect” that he literally sees them differently. In this case, targeting the disabled calls to mind Nazi persecution of people with physical and mental disabilities — World War II had ended just a year earlier, and Siodmak himself had fled the Nazis due to his Jewish heritage. The result is that “The Spiral Staircase” is a work of Gothic Horror for a world still reeling from the Holocaust. -CB\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/6/\n\nMy take: This film centers on Helen, a young woman who is mute as a result of a past trauma, as she works in a Gothic mansion as a servant to a rich family while a serial killer is on the loose murdering young women with disabilities. I was excited to watch this one because I haven’t seen as many older, classic Hollywood films as I would like. In some ways, this movie does feel very old-fashioned. For example, the male characters are fairly domineering, even the ones who were practically disowned by their late father for being “too weak.” One of the brothers, Stephen, repeatedly harasses Blanche, another woman working in the house, while Dr. Parry, Helen’s love interest, badgers her, at one point even physically shaking her, about working harder to regain her voice.\n\nWhile I’ve seen some other horror/thriller films that incorporate the idea of disability (Hush comes to mind), I don’t know that I’ve seen this connection between trauma and disability play out in quite the way it does with Helen’s character in The Spiral Staircase. She lost her ability to speak after her family was killed in a house fire, and she only regains it here when she is traumatized by nearly being killed by the serial killer and then watching him be shot to death. It’s kind of a strange/interesting spin on the idea that survivors of trauma must revisit the trauma and then talk about it to move past it.\n\nThe killer’s motive is especially sinister, as he wants to weed out young women who are not perfect due to some disability, such as the limp we see in the film’s earliest on-screen victim. The repeated image of the killer’s eye, detached from the entirety of his body, seems to almost align him with his victims in a way, considering that in his motive, he seeks to distance himself from their “weaknesses.” He is reduced down to his eye, as the women are reduced to their lack of voice or their limp.\n\nThis one is heavy on atmosphere between the rain and the mansion itself with its foreboding staircase that leads to the dark, dangerous basement. The characters sometimes seem a bit absurd, but the maid who needs her “nip” of brandy was entertaining, despite her constant beratement of poor Carleton the bulldog.\n\nGoodnight Mommy (2014; Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala)\n\nIndiewire’s ranking: 91\n\nIndiewire’s blurb:\n\nThere’s horror that you see and horror that you can feel. A slow psychological build from unassuming start to fiery end, this is unnerving filmmaking — and not just because of the fierce bodily harm on display. It’s drenched in the insidious, unsettling feeling buried within: the idea that your own family’s inability to recognize you can metastasize into something so brutal. Featuring the rare twist that’s improved by a straightforward, matter-of-fact reveal, “Goodnight Mommy” is a harsh spin on the fear of the unknown that permeates so many of the stories on this list. Yes, it may feel like an endurance test. But there’s an extraordinary element of control here, in which each fresh affront is carefully doled out with masterful precision. -SG\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/2/\n\nMy take: This one is difficult to evaluate because I think it was well done, but it’s not the kind of film you’d say you like or enjoy, exactly. The film starts out with the perspective of twin boys, whose mom apparently just had some sort of plastic surgery procedure because her head and face are wrapped as in the image above. The boys start to suspect that this person is not “Mommy,” which is seemingly supported by a sketchy phone call that implies “Mommy” and the other person on the phone are participating in a ruse that needs to end soon. Then, “Mommy” also can’t answer some questions about herself and one of the twins correctly, so the audience joins the boys in their paranoia.\n\nLate in the movie, there is a huge reveal/twist that makes you question everything you’ve seen so far. It definitely made me think about whether the twist was satisfying and whether it made sense; I’m actually still deciding. One thing is certain: this film is really brutal in terms of the torture visuals and the feeling of claustrophobia and entrapment. It’s not a relaxing experience by any means, but it’s an engaging and thought-provoking movie.\n\nEyes Without a Face (1960; Georges Franju)\n\nIndiewire’s ranking: 7\n\nIndiewire’s blurb:\n\nFairy tales can often tap into the same primal fears as horror films: fears of rejection, loneliness, aging, the loss of beauty. In Georges Franju’s telling of a plastic surgeon father obsessed with saving his daughter’s looks — her face was disfigured in an accident — “Eyes Without a Face” is a horror movie in the guise of a twisted fairy tale, right down to its tinkly, child-like Maurice Jarre score. The father’s only solution is a face transplant: which means killing women so he can steal their faces. But his daughter’s body inevitably rejects the skin grafts. There’s so much at work here: the idea that a loss of beauty is the same as death itself (the father has held a funeral for his daughter and he keeps her hidden away from the world) and that beauty is worth killing for (with lab attendant Alida Valli as the “huntsman” archetype in this cockeyed Snow White story, going out and abducting young women). “Eyes Without a Face” says that the ultimate sadness is when happiness itself becomes inequity: that in order to gain something for yourself the only solution is to take from another. -CB\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/11/\n\nMy take: So, I won’t be telling film fans anything new when I say that this movie is completely fucked-up. Yes, the imagery is creepy, but what is this doctor even trying to do with these gruesome face transplants? It’s horrifying in every way imaginable. And don’t get me started on the fact that this asshole experiments on dogs, too.\n\nThe premise is that this doctor’s daughter has been scarred by a car accident and needs a new face. I don’t know why the doctor decided the solution to his daughter’s injuries is to kill other young women and cut off their faces, but here we are. I think maybe the worst part of this scheme (beyond the obvious) is how willing the doctor’s helper is to go out and kidnap and murder innocent young women to help with the project. She is apparently a success story and devotee, but she never seems to question her actions. Even the daughter, Christiane, gets to the point where she thinks enough is enough. Despite some frustrations with character motivations, I will say that the ending of this film is appropriate and satisfying.\n\nI recently came across Indiewire’s “The Greatest Horror Movies of All Time” list, which has been updated to include even more titles, for a total of 110.\n\nHere’s a link to the full Indiewire article: https://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/\n\nMy plan is to watch as many of these movies as I can between now and Halloween 2020, recording my thoughts on each, and then ranking or organizing them in comparison to the Indiewire list. I will write a separate post to briefly discuss each of the films on the list I had already seen. I’m only dedicating full blog posts to newly-viewed titles.\n\nDeep Red (1975; dir. Dario Argento)\n\nIndiewire’s ranking: 11\n\nIndiewire’s blurb:\n\nDario Argento didn’t create the giallo genre, that honor goes to Mario Bava, but he perfected it with 1975’s “Deep Red,” often referred to as the greatest giallo of all-time. The film kicks off with a psychic who sense the dark thoughts of a murderer in the audience, one who later targets and kills her. David Hemmings stars as a pianist who witnesses the murder, which draws him into a dark mystery that puts his life at risk. Argento employs many of the genre’s signature trades, a black-gloved, knife-wielding killer; deliciously over the top death sequences; twists, turns, and false reveals; and a wonderfully warped backstory that eventually reveals the killer’s identity. Argento would soon gain international acclaim with 1977’s “Suspiria,” but “Deep Red” remains a thrilling murder mystery and Argento’s very best. -JR\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/10/\n\nMy take: I had heard going in that this was supposed to be the best giallo ever, even better than Suspiria, which I love (both versions, actually). I kept thinking it was going to get more interesting, or that there would be some crazy twist — basically anything to justify this ranking just outside the top ten and above classics like Carrie, Silence of the Lambs, and Scream. There IS a twist, but it’s not that exciting. The gruesome scenes are part gross-out and part hilarious (not sure whether that was intentional). The main character who is investigating the psychic’s murder and the mysterious figure he thinks he saw leaving the scene, is really quite boring and takes some actions that don’t make much sense (like, he found a dead body but didn’t report it or anything?). I could not get over the stupidity of him trying to knock plaster off the wall with his finger to reveal the murder-reenactment-trauma drawing painted there. There is a super creepy doll machine robot thing that charges at one of the victims, and Goblin totally killed it with the soundtrack, but overall, this one did NOT live up to the hype.\n\nCandyman (1992; dir. Bernard Rose)\n\nIndiewire’s rank: 50\n\nIndiewire’s blurb:\n\n“A boogieman terrorizing a public housing project? The film’s setting alone separates it from many of its slasher movie brethren. Based on Clive Barker’s short story “The Forbidden,” director Bernard Rose relocates the story from Barker’s native Liverpool to the dilapidated, “scary” buildings of the Cabrini-Green projects in Chicago. It was an inspired decision that amended the original story’s classist undertones into explicitly racial ones, turning this into more of a subversive meditation on race. The unsettling legend about the hook-handed terror focuses on a skeptical white doctoral candidate working on a thesis on urban legends, who learns of the Cabrini-Green Candyman legend and goes to investigate. Starring Virginia Madsen as an atypical slasher movie heroine, the film boasts one of the more intriguing horror-movie villains, with a complexity rooted in a tragic backstory that makes him sympathetic: a famous black artist and son of slaves who pays a steep price, amputation and a grisly death, for falling in love with a white man’s daughter who hires him to paint her portrait. Digging a little deeper than your average horror film, the film stars the physically imposing Tony Todd as Candyman, whose sonorous, chilly voice haunts long after the movie ends. -TO\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/7/\n\nMy take: I feel like there is a lot going on here. While I appreciate the attempt to tackle deeper social issues than most horror movies are willing to take on, this film seems a bit messy. And it’s very ’90s. As Indiewire mentions, Virginia Madsen stars as an atypical horror film/final girl heroine: she is a grad student, married to a professor (who is the worst, btw, even beyond the fact that his name is Trevor), writing a thesis on urban legends. She proceeds to investigate the Candyman legend after hearing of some murders that have been attibuted to this figure. This requires multiple trips to the housing projects, along with all the ominous warnings you’d expect a white woman “dressed like a cop” about to cross racial and class divides to yield. It seems like most of the people who live in the Cabrini-Green development think of Candyman as a literal man (and even Helen’s first real encounter with “Candyman” involves a man holding a hook but whose hand is not actually a hook), but we soon realize there is a supernatural element involved. The villain has a history as a victim of oppression and racism, which I think makes his motives a bit muddled at times. And to be honest, the whole romantic-ish subplot/reveal between Candyman and Helen was … odd. This one is worth a watch; it kept my interest and put a new spin on some of the horror tropes.\n\nDon’t Look Now (1973; dir. Nicolas Roeg)\n\nIndiewire’s rank: 36\n\nIndiewire’s blurb:\n\nWhy are there so many horror movies about the grieving process? It’s a big question, but “Don’t Look Now” is as comprehensive an answer as you’re likely to find. For one thing, Nicolas Roeg’s masterpiece — a splintered and unshakeable portrait of two parents (Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie) in mourning over the death of their young daughter — has inspired a zillion lesser films to explore the same terrain. For another, this morbid Daphne du Maurier adaptation complicates Hitchcockian psychology with Borges-inspired surrealism to illustrate how genre language can tap into trauma more directly than standard dramas might allow. Spooky twin sisters, spectral visions, the murk of Venetian canals, one infamous sex scene, and the most disturbing reveal in all of cinema combine to articulate the isolating madness that follows loss, and the consequences that come from surrendering to it. -DE\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/8/\n\nMy take: This movie seems to be more like a thriller than a horror to me, but I guess the blind psychic lady and the person revealed during a twist at the end of the movie are pretty creepy. At the start of the film, Laura and John Baxter lose their young daughter to what appears to be a tragic drowning accident. Most of the movie takes place as the couple tries to move on from their grief in Venice, as John works on some sort of vague art / architecture restoration project.\n\nhttps://media1.tenor.com/images/99bf178fc2c4466898ff24325ef537dd/tenor.gif?itemid=16193588\n\nThe best thing about this movie is the Venice setting, since the city’s strangeness and age certainly add to the sinister mood. The blind psychic (because of course she’s blind but can “see” more than the other characters; we all know Teiresias, right?) says at one point that her sister dislikes Venice because it has “too many shadows.” So between the city itself and the psychic’s uncanny comments about/from the Baxters’ deceased daughter, the film does establish a sort of paranoia and sense of secrets hiding around the corner or beyond the surface.\n\nThat said, I didn’t find it easy to connect to the characters, despite their traumatic loss and Laura’s obvious desparation for closure. Much of the film’s action (and acting) seems sort of ridiculous, so I had a hard time taking it seriously on the whole. For example, the best scene is probably when John climbs a ladder to a very high spot in a very old church to match some mosaic tiles. He obviously should NOT go up there, but it’s worth it because it’s so hilarious to watch him dangling there while various items crash to the floor and the people below freak out and dodge debris. Yes, this is better than the infamous sex scene, which is so long and cringey, that it almost approaches Wiseau’s The Room territory.\n\nI learned that this film is based on a story by Daphne DuMaurier, so I may check that out. I guess the film has a cool twist, but honestly, I don’t understand why Indiewire has this ranked so high on their list. I didn’t feel like the “horror” elements held up that well.\n\nBONUS!\n\nTwins of Evil (1971; dir. John Hough)\n\nThis one didn’t make Indiewire’s list, but it’s on some other best horror movies lists, and I mistakenly watched it thinking Indiwire had it ranked. This one deserves some thoughts.\n\nFirst things first, Count Karnstein looks like a deranged Jimmy Fallon and the twins reminded me of a European high-class peasant version of Princess Leia.\n\nSo a bunch of asshole Puritan proto-proud boys calling themselves “The Brotherhood” (how original) start rounding up and burning women at the stake, with no sort of trial or defense. The women are suspicious because — gasp — they live alone! Without a husband! I sense evil is a-brewing.\n\nThere is an actual “evil” roaming this German village: there is a literal Satan-worshipper-turned-vampire living at the castle on top of the mountain. Yep, Count Karnstein sacrifices another innocent virgin and prays to Satan to help him have some more extreme experiences. A dead countess (his wife?) shows up and gives the Count the kiss of un-death. Once Count K is a vampire, it’s clear who is commandeering all of the murders in the woods, but it’s a bit less clear who was running that show before he stepped in. Nonetheless, the Count recruits one of the new-in-town twins, the fiesty Frieda who cannot handle being locked up in her Puritan uncle’s thatched cottage with her saccharine, guileless, and, at least for Anton, boring (“open book” is the term he uses) twin sis. Side note: Anton’s unbridled desire for one of the twins, and later, presumably, the other one is creepy an inappropriate. They are his literal students.\n\nThis film doesn’t necessarily tread any new ground, though I suppose the twin angle, especially the late act twin-switcheroo, is kind of a twist. The acting is over-the-top in a way that is often laughable, and it’s obvious that the director is looking for excuses to show off the twins’, um, “twins.” Despite the cheesiness, this was an enjoyable watch with some cool scenery and entertainingly extra performances.\n\nIntroduction: Barre Blend is Beachbody on Demand’s (Bod) first foray into barre style classes that are so popular lately with studies like Pure Barre. Barre Blend is not strictly barre/ballet, though. The “Blend” refers to the mix of cardio sculpting, yoga, and pilates (even a little, tiny bit of boxing) Elise includes with the traditional barre work. I have been wanting to attend a barre class for a long time but was intimidated. Having Barre Blend on BoD helped because not only could I try it for the first time in the privacy of my own home, but most gyms were closed due to the pandemic at least for part of my time doing this program.\n\nEquipment: You need a set of light weights, a mat, and something to use as a standing barre. I use a chair and a set of 2 lb. weights, which I got from Target. Resistance loops are optional, so if you have those hanging around from 80 Day Obsession, The Prep/The Work, or 21 Day Fix, you’re in luck! Barre socks are optional, but I bought some from Amazon that were cute and fun to wear.\n\nTrainer: Elise Joan is a dancer and yoga teacher who has specialized in barre and yoga for 20 years. She is very sweet and sincere and tries to be motivational. I think that she reaches many people, as I know so many who absolutely love her and this program. Elise’s personality is not exactly my “vibe,” so to speak, in a trainer, but I got used to her quirks with time.\n\nCast: The cast consists of some professional dancers and some ladies who were in the Barre Blend test group. I thought the latter was an interesting addition for Beachbody, but those ladies are definitely in great shape. This is the first cast I’ve seen that has not been mixed gender; all of the cast are women. There is always a modifier (Alessandra) and an intensifier (varies between workouts). Elise will generally show three or four levels for most moves; the mod will do level one and the intensifier will do level three and sometimes level four if that applies. The majority of the cast is “the mid-line,” and they do level two or sometimes three. This feature of the program is one reason Elise says that it can be done multiple times and still present a different experience each time.\n\nFormat:\n\nThere are five workout types, and you are meant to do one workout per day, five days per week, for eight weeks. In the second half of the program, the workouts are extended by five minutes, and by ten in the final two weeks. Elise also includes yoga and foam rolling recovery videos that you can do on the weekends or after any of the workouts. Finally, there are five ten-minute enhancement videos (booty, core, cardio, upper body, legs) that you can add on to any of your workouts. I tried a few of them, but I wasn’t ready in this first round of the program to pile on too much.\n\nI should note that there’s quite a bit of overlap in the workouts. Elise likes to say that every day is full body, every day is booty, every day is core, and so forth. She’s not joking. Every routine seems to have some of each of the following: some standing barre work, some cardio, some moves with light weights, some mat work (most of them, maybe not all), and some standing balances with some sort of leg lifts and pulses. The “Barre Blend Burn Zone” is certainly featured numerous times in every single workout. I would say that each routine has a signature move or two, but there’s plenty of similarity between the workouts in terms of which areas of the body are being shaped and toned.\n\nThe Warm-Up: Okay, I don’t always feel the need to talk about the warm-up, but this program’s warm-up is crazy. It’s longer than most warm-ups and definitely more challening, including push-ups and burpees almost every day. The warm-up also is “extended” in the later phases, so it’s probably 12-15 minutes on some days. When I first started the program, I had a hard time telling when the warm-up ended and the workout began, if that says anything. This program’s warm-up has inspired me to order a tub of BB Energize, which I had not used in over a year. Oh, and I forgot to mention that in Weeks 4, 6, and 8, she adds WEIGHTS TO THE WARM-UP.\n\nThe Five Workouts:\n\nClassic Full Body Blend: This was the most difficult of the five for me when I started, so it’s either great or terrible that it’s the first routine of the week. On the downside, I could see people getting discouraged from the get-go because of this one, but the upside is that it’s out of the way first thing on Monday. Personally, I found the standing barre work difficult because I felt lower back pain. Others who did the program advised me to reduce my range of motion and to check my core, and those suggestions did help a bit.\n\nThe signature move: The standing barre series in this workout stands out to me as it defining feature and also what makes it the most difficult. The posture requires you to face the barre or chair and lean over. You then do a series of leg lifts and pulses. As I said, these moves just kill my lower back, so I’m working on posture and core to try to help with that. The standing barre series also gets more difficult as the weeks progress, adding the rainbow and the straight leg lift out to the side, which is very intense. There’s also the Barre Blend Snow Angel, which is a move in C-curve where you bring the arms down to the side then up overhead while pulling the legs in and out. She adds weights to this move periodically.\n\nBooty Blend: I love a good booty workout, so this one is one of my favorite routines of the week. Like the Classic Full Body Blend, there was standing barre work, but there were not any moves that hurt my back this time. There are lots of little booty lifts and pulses to hone in on the glutes. There are also cringey booty dancing moments on the knees and on the back in a sort of bridge post.\n\nThe signature move: The pretzel is the notorious booty day move. You start out on the mat with one leg folded in front, one in back and the knee lifted and sort of angled down so the ankle is higher, and in that position, you do a series of pulses and push-backs and combinations of those moves. Later on, you add a weight behind the knee, and in Phase 4, you do standing pretzel work at the barre before coming down to the mat for even more.\n\nCardio Blend: Most of this routine is what Elise would call “cardio sculpt,” so cardio with weights, but there are also some moves without weights and some barre work in the early weeks. As the program progresses and you get stronger, those barre moves fade away and you need to use your balance and your core to get through the routine. Phase 4 Cardio Blend workouts do not use the barre at all.\n\nThe signature move: I don’t think there is just one, but there’s much more cardio in this one than in the othe routines. Early on, Elise did some “Jane Fonda” inspired, 80s aerobics moves, but those later seemed to be incorporated into the warm-up.\n\nCore Blend: I don’t generally love core-focused workouts, particularly the ones with a lot of mat work, but this wasn’t so bad at the beginning of the program. As time went on, I found it to be maybe the most challenging of the five for me, and the one I least looked forward to each week. There is definitely standing core work, but the mat core moves are the ones that kill me, even after all of the programs I’ve done. It’s hard to keep my shoulders off the ground for so long in all the C-curve positions.\n\nThe signature move: The hinge and the Pilates sequences (like the 100) are the trademarks of this workout. The 100 is a classical Pilates move where you have your knees up in tabletop (lying on your back) or legs straight and angled upward while you pulse your arms down, straight at your side, for a series of inhales and exhales. Later in the program, you do it with weights. There are other classic Pilates moves, as well, like single-leg stretches, scissor kicks, back extensions, and swimming. The hinge is a move where you are on your knees with your feet on the ground behind you, and you hinge back, trying to keep the legs steady while moving the midsection back and to the side; it’s a killer on the quads. There is pulsing and twising involved.\n\nLean Legs Barre Blend: The routine is probably my favorite of the five. I feel like it taps into what I was most looking for from barre workouts, which is the grace and long leg movements I associate with ballet. There is a lot of standing barre work in this one, but some moves progress over the week to where you do them without the barre altogether or try balances periodically. I also liked the incorporation of the resistance loop in this routine and added my loop whenever it was suggested after Week 1.\n\nThe signature move: The inner thigh mat series stands out as a signature move for this routine. You lie on your side and lift the inner thigh in a series of pulses, kick backs, and circles. Later on, Elise also adds some outer thigh work in this position with the top leg. The inner thigh work evolves to include a pulse move where you bring the lower leg up to the higher leg, which is slightly elevated, and then add beats.\n\nThe Phases: This program is broken into four phases, though the breaks are a bit less obvious at the start of the program. The major difference in phases is the amount of time you will spend working out each day, though the difficulty of some moves does increase in the later phases.\n\nPhases 1 and 2 are 30-minute workouts (really 33 by the time the cooldown is finished). When I started Barre Blend, even 30 minutes felt like a crazy-long amount of time with the lack of breaks and the pace of the movement. However, once Phases 3 and 4 come along…WOW. Phase 3 amps up the workouts to 35 minutes for two weeks, and then Phase 4 really comes at you hard wtih 40-minute workouts. I found myself totally exhausted by the 40-minute workouts and unable to do any add-ons, enhancements, or other workouts from different programs on the same day. I think if I were to go back and do Barre Blend again or throw in some workouts here and there, I could do a weight training workout followed by one of the 30-minute routines, but even that would probably be tough. I was burning between 350-400 calories per workout in Phase 4, with my highest burn being 421 calories on Week 8 Cardio Blend. My peak heart rate percentage has been significant, generally about 40-60% of the workout, which I’m not sure is good or bad, or maybe some of each.\n\nOverall Review:\n\nOverall, this program is a bit of a conundrum to me. I find that some moves I can easily up-level, and I can use the resistance band whenever that is an option. Then there are other moves I have trouble doing even at the mid-line. I can’t hold my arms up without resting most of the times when Elise says not to put the arms down (same thing for straightening the legs, though I find that more manageable than keeping straight arms with the weights for long periods). I adjusted and progressed, but I definitely understand Elise’s statement that people could do several rounds of the program and still be challenged.\n\nThe workouts can sometimes feel a little haphazard, like Elise is just making it up as she goes, even though she’s very calm and in control. I assume I feel this way because I’m accustomed to workout programs with time limits or a known quantity of reps. With Barre Blend, it’s kind of a mystery how long you will be doing a given move, and sometimes even varies leg to leg or side to side.\n\nI expect to return to this program, maybe in hybrid calendar form or maybe just a workout here and there to mix things up. I love many of the benefits of this program, but I did not find myself necessarily looking forward to these routines like I did with some of my favorite programs.\n\nPros of Barre Blend:\n\n30-40 minute workouts are relatively short and can fit into most people’s schedules and gives you a good “bang for your buck”\n\nGreat toning work for the full body\n\nAffirmation, motivation, self-care, and self-expression are big selling points with Elise\n\n*Sometimes* the moves are fun\n\nYou learn some ballet terminology, which I thought was cool since I’m not a trained dancer\n\nThe program progresses to add difficulty and intensity\n\nThe program can be repeated multiple times\n\nCons of Barre Blend:\n\nElise’s personality may not be for everyone\n\nThe program is TOUGH, even though it’s technically listed as a “Beginner” program on BoD\n\nThe workouts can feel a bit repetitive\n\nThere are really no breaks during the workouts for water or breathing\n\nSome people may be turned off by the lack of weight training (even though the two-pound weights were plenty challenging with these moves)\n\nI don’t think this program will appeal to men in the same way other BoD programs do; this isn’t to say that men can’t do it, but it doesn’t seem to be marketed toward men with the lack of men in the cast and the repeated references to “my girls,” etc.\n\nThere is a solid cringe level in some of the moves and affirmation talk in this program\n\nI have made no secret that Autumn is my favorite BoD trainer. I have done her programs multiple times (80 Day Obsession for three rounds, 21 Day Fix and Fix Extreme, and the real time versions, multiple times that I can’t even count any more). This year’s annual Coach Summit was all virtual, of course, which means access on BoD to each trainer’s summit workouts and exciting announcements about upcoming programming. I had NO idea but was ecstatic to hear that Autumn is releasing a new program at the end of this year or January 2021.\n\nThe program looks crazy intense and is called “9 Week Control Freak.” It’s also mentioned that the program will focus on nutrition and self-care. This makes perfect sense if you know Autumn also heads up BoD’s Ultimate Portion Fix and participates in the Fixate cooking show with her brother Bobby. The push to integrate nutrition and self-care is trendy amongst Beachbody coaches right now, but the first one who exposed me to all of these elements of a fitness plan was Autumn herself, with the containers and the built-in yoga days in 21 Day Fix, not to mention the additional foam rolling and stretching videos with 80 DO.\n\nThis looks like an awesome, comprehensive, challenging program. Seriously, watch the video announcement and tell me you’re not pumped:\n\nThe Sample Workout: When I saw on Facebook that I could do an exclusive Autumn workout previewing the new program, I immediately changed my plan from my regularly scheduled Barre Blend workout, and this preview was just what I needed on a day I was feeling a bit worn-out and unmotivated.\n\nAutumn explains that the workout will be a “DCT” style workout, and that 9WCF will have three days per week devoted to this type of training. The acronym stands for “Density, Complex, Tabata,” and the sample workout includes a portion dedicated to each of those training styles. She jokes about the program not having a traditional “leg day,” which is funny because of how much Autumn loves leg day. Instead, “Every day is leg day!” This was also kinda true in 80DO, but I’m okay with that. The program will also use a few new pieces of equipment: a ball, some sort of resistance pulling device (see video; I don’t know what it’s called), and a step. YAS! This means the fact that I bought the step for Transform:20, which I vow to never do again, will not be a waste after all!\n\nAfter a short warm-up, we launched into the Density portion of the workout. This is a timed, self-guided combination of five moves. Autumn says that each DCT workout will start with the Density moves: one plyo move, one leg move, one push move, one pull move, one abs move. Some of this terminology is now familiar to me from doing workouts from the Prep, but Autumn has not structured her previous workouts in this manner. First, Autumn demos each move and we do four practice reps of each. The moves are as follows:\n\nPlyo move: side to side squat jump holding a weight (this is seen in her other programs)\n\nLeg move: front-loaded squat with two weights (another common BoD move)\n\nPush move: V-shoulder press (this one is new to me; thank God it wasn’t push-ups) with two weights\n\nPull move: reciprocating bent-over row (another new one), where you alternate arms as you row up at a fairly quick pace\n\nAbs move: tabletop alternating crunch (Autumn demos this with a ball that will be required equipment for the program, but we do it without the ball)\n\nAt this point, Autumn sets a timer for 12 minutes. She says the number of rounds will vary based on the types of moves and that in the early phases (the program will have 3, 3-week phases), you will probably get in more full rounds, while in later phases, more complex moves will probably slow you down. Each move on its own is very manageable, assuming you choose the correct weights. I used 8s at first for the plyo move, 10s for the squat and pull move, and 8s for the shoulder press. I did up my plyo weight move to a 10 after a few rounds. The challenge with this format is the pacing and the number of repetitions; oh, and there are no scheduled breaks until the 12 minutes have elapsed. I ended up doing six full rounds, a seventh round of plyo squats, and four front squats in the seventh round when time was called. I should note that as this was a virtual workout, Autumn has four or five other ladies working out with her, and you can see them on the side of the screen. Once we got through a couple of moves in the first round, everyone was at a slightly different point, so it was cool to see the variety of paces and know that you just need to work at your own.\n\nAfter our one minute break, I have worked up a good sweat, and Autumn informs us that the “C” round, or Complex, will involve three moves in a combination. Rather than moving at our own pace, we will stay with her. The challenge here is to choose a weight that will allow you to complete all three moves (essentially three different weighted moves) ten times all the way through. I used 8s for this and felt that was a manageable but challenging weight for me. The moves are an inverted (sort of) hammer curl, to a triceps overhead extension, to a supine biceps curl. There is also the movement between moves, like bringing the arms overhead from the hammer curl position to the triceps position. The C portion of the workout lasts for two rounds of this 10 (but actually 30) rep format.\n\nThe final round is Tabata, which Autumn explains is a kind of high intensity cardio training with a set amount of time doing a move and a set amount of rest time. She says that in 9WCF, phase one will start with 10 seconds of the move, 20 seconds of rest; phase two will do 15 and 15; and phase three will require 20 seconds of the move and only 10 seconds of rest. This pattern continues for 4 total minutes. We are sampling the 15/15 spread today. This workout’s move is a high knee sprint/run. The move itself is quite simple, and I found that I actually enjoyed this round. The 15 seconds were a good amount of time to go all-out and an adequate rest period, as well.\n\nOverall Review/Outlook: I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS PROGRAM. I absoultely loved the sample workout, and exercising with Autumn just makes me so happy. I’m excited for the new challenge, to try out some new equipment, and to take control of my nutrition. I might even have to break down and spend the money to get this one at its earliest release date (and I NEVER do that). All the thumbs up!\n\nI finished my first round of Morning Meltdown 100 in late February, and with some time to wait before the release of Barre Blend, I decided to try the MM100/LIIFT 4 hybrid calendar. This is a 100-ish workout calendar that combines many of the workouts from MM100 with basically all of the LIIFT 4 routines. The latter is a four-day-per-week program, so it is easily combined with another program like MM100. I started this calendar on Monday, March 2, with Cardio Meltdown 1, and finished on Saturday, May 30, with Melt Mix 100. I completed every workout on the calendar and added some extras here and there. I only took a few genuine rest days over the course of this program because quarantine. So, not long after I started this calendar, we were put under the “Stay at Home” advisory for Covid-19. I’m a high school teacher who, in addition to working out most days, stays very active during my school day. Therefore, I was really missing the activity and the calorie burn, plus I’m eating much less healthily (stress, I guess), so I often doubled workouts or added some MM100 workouts that were not on the calendar. The calendar does not include one of my faves from MM100 — Meltcon — so I did that one a couple times as a bonus for myself.\n\nBefore we get into the breakdown of the program and my results, let me just say that this program, because of the nature of the workout types included on this calendar, has FAR too much of the following:\n\nPush-ups. All kinds of push-ups. We’re talking wide, regular, triceps, plyo.\n\nFlutter kicks. For the love of God, these two trainers love them some flutter kicks. With weights, without weights, for 30 seconds, for a minute. Too much.\n\nMountain climbers. This is the HIIT Cardio bane of my existence. I hate them so much. There are even twisted mountain climbers in LIIFT4, and I can’t decide: are they worse or just as bad or slightly better than normal ones? Either way, mountain climbers suck.\n\nJoel not working out. Like, seriously, it was annoying the first time I did the program, but it’s really pretty insufferable, especially when combined with his stupid jokes. Look, I get that the man obviously works out for a living, but it’s not good for morale to have him walking around while I’m doing triple bears, or, God forbid, twisted mountain climbers. Shut up, Joel! Also, if you have done his workouts and agree with me, check out this link because it’s amazing\n\nOkay, now that my complaints are out of the way, let’s focus on the logistics of this program. I will discuss what you need to complete the program and what each type of workout looks like. Then I’ll get into my general review of pros and cons at the bottom.\n\nProgram requirements: Both programs on their own require only dumbbells and a mat. The weights, though, will vary greatly. There are some moves in MM100 for which I use my lightest weights — 3 lbs. — and I only have up to a 20 lb. kettlebell. For the most part, my range of dumbbells 3-15 lbs. works for both programs, though there are a couple moves here and there that I could probably go heavier on if I had the resources. A mat is required for almost every day — every LIIFT 4 routine has core at the end, and I’d say just about all MM100 routines use a mat besides cardio. You’ll definitely need to have a very full bottle of water nearby, too.\n\nIntensity level: Both programs are listed as intermediate to advanced on Beachbody on Demand, and I’d agree with that, particularly if you’re trying to do all the moves at the pace and number of reps the trainers intend. However, as with all programs, both Joel and Jericho make use of modifiers and even the non-modifiers in each workout take modifications sometimes. I can see these workouts being frustrating for a beginner, but I guess you have to start somewhere. If you are in very good shape, you will still definitely be sufficiently challenged, though. You may want to double on some days or add another activity like running or biking.\n\nProgram Format: This program includes all four weekly LIIFT 4 workouts and a selection of MM100 workouts. The calendar includes 7 of the 10 original MM100 workout types: Cardio Meltdown, Total Body Badass, Freestyle Flow, Lit Cardio, Fight Club, Core Inferno, and Re-Vibe. This calendar cuts Upbeat and Downbeat Strength, as well as Meltcon, presumably because they’d be redundant when combined with LIIFT4’s routines. I can also attest that LIIFT4’s lifting routines are more difficult than those three MM100 workouts that are omitted. Near the end of the calendar, some earlier LIIFT4 routines have to be repeated because that program is 8 weeks, not 10, and the calendar is a 10 week calendar (or 10 times 10 workouts, rather). I’ll map out the first ten days below and then make some general comments about the way the routines progress each week.\n\nDay 1: Cardio Meltdown 1: Yes, even after finishing a full round of MM100, this first workout was still difficult. The Cardio Meltdown routines feature 12 moves, in 6 combinations. In the first half of the workout, you do the first move of the pair for a while, do the second move for a while, then combine for 4-8 reps, depending on the move. Then there i"
