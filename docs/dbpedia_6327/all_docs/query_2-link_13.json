Building upon decades of research, Peter Bondanella and Federico Pacchioni reorganize the current History in order to keep the book fresh and responsive not only to the actual films being created in Italy in the twenty-first century but also to the rapidly changing priorities of Italian film studies and film scholars. The new edition brings the definitive history of the subject, from the birth of cinema to the present day, up to date with a revised filmography as well as more focused attention on the melodrama, the crime film, and the historical drama. The book is expanded to include a new generation of directors as well as to highlight themes such as gender issues, immigration, and media politics. Accessible, comprehensive, and heavily illustrated throughout, this is an essential purchase for any fan of Italian film.\n\nMastering Fear analyzes horror as play and examines what functions horror has and why it is adaptive and beneficial for audiences.

It takes a biocultural approach, and focusing on emotions, gender, and play, it argues we play with fiction horror. In horror we engage not only with the negative emotions of fear and disgust, but with a wide range of emotions, both positive and negative. The book lays out a new theory of horror and analyzes female protagonists in contemporary horror from child to teen, adult, middle age, and old age.\n\nSince the turn of the millennium, we have seen a new generation of female protagonists in horror. There are feisty teens in The Vampire Diaries (2009–2017), troubled mothers in The Babadook (2014), and struggling women in the New French extremity with Martyrs (2008) and Inside (2007). At the fuzzy edges of the genre are dramas like Pan's Labyrinth (2006) and Black Swan (2010), and middle-age women are now protagonists with Carol in The Walking Dead (2010–) and Jessica Lange's characters in American Horror Story (2011–). Horror is not just for men, but also for women, and not just for the young, but for audiences of all ages.\n\nThis collection was inspired by the observation that film remakes offer us the opportunity to revisit important issues, stories, themes, and topics in a manner that is especially relevant and meaningful to contemporary audiences.

Like mythic stories that are told again and again in differing ways, film remakes present us with updated perspectives on timeless ideas. While some remakes succeed and other fail aesthetically, they always say something about the culture in which-and for which-they are produced. Contributors explore the ways in which the fears of death, loss of self, and bodily violence have been expressed and then reinterpreted in such films and remakes as Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Night of the Living Dead, and Dawn of the Dead. Films such as Rollerball, The Ring, The Grudge, The Great Yokai Wars, and Insomnia are discussed as well because of their ability to give voice to collective anxieties concerning cultural change, nihilism, and globalization.

Therefore, specific genre has different target of audiences such as crime genre which is usually not for all-age audiences. Each genre also has different purpose in the making of the film. Horror film is produced to make people or audiences scared by showing a horrible creature or about death (Natadjaja: 2005). Based on the purpose of horror film, in this paper I would like to discuss about the cinematography in horror film in order to see how cinematography in horror film builds scary atmospheres.\n\nThe art film Naked Lunch (1991) may have marked a turn away from the horror genre for David Cronenberg, but it also features both monsters and monstrosity.

Protagonist Bill Lee wanders passively through a surreal landscape populated with fantastical creatures feeding him orders that correspond to the impulses he does not recognize within himself. By Cronenberg’s own description, these monsters are projections, excusing and externalizing Lee’s internal, unacknowledged anxieties. Since these monsters are embodied outside himself, Lee never has to confront his\n\ninternal conflicts as such. Engaging with writings on horror and monsters by Julia Kristeva, Noël Carroll, and Jeffrey Jerome Cohen, this essay uses Naked Lunch to develop a Cronenbergian theory of monstrosity. Monsters objectify the abject, but in doing so evade the sources of abjection. Cronenberg, a filmmaker constantly exploring abjection and monstrosity, for the first time in his filmography articulates this problematic relationship between them explicitly in Naked Lunch.\n\nCall for Papers: \"The Aesthetics of Trauma, Horror, Atrocity, and the Apocalyptic\" Western culture is riven with powerful manifestations of violence - both actual and fictive.

What is the relationship between the two? On one hand the most violent episodes of our times seem to be replicated in our cultural artefacts, on the other, the aggression we see in the Hollywood action film amplifies violence to the point that it seems unreal and cartoonish. Do such cultural artefacts desensitise us to violence or do they instead relieve or absorb the traumatic experiences of our times? Does the rise of the apocalyptic war film, and our fascination with the vitrine of human brutality paraded in the forensic investigation, the horror or blockbuster suspense films, explain our inertia in the face continuing global conflict, including the ongoing eruption of genocide around the world from Rwanda to Bosnia?\n\nIntellectual Background:\n\nThis day is being organised by Dr Frances Di Lauro (Writing Hub, University of Sydney) and Dr Christopher Hartney (Studies in Religion, University of Sydney) as part of an ARC grant application that will be based on a body of films contained amongst the collections the Mu-Meson Film Archive in Annandale. Here archivists Jamie and Aspasia Leonarder curate a collection of Cold-War-framed short films that were fashioned from Christian perspectives. These films were produced from the 1950s through to the 1980s and broadcast during those years to Christian and other community groups. The films were shaped by aesthetics that exploited horror, anxiety, and the possibility or inevitability of personal tragedy to address wider simmering anxieties of world annihilation. This suite of fears was then nestled against the backdrop of trauma, holocaust, genocide and apocalyptic ferment that the century had generated.\n\nProfessor Vras Karalis, will deliver the keynote address. Professor Karalis is the author of several books on film and editor of Power, judgment and political evil: in conversation with Hannah Arendt. Surry: Ashgate, 2010.\n\nWe are eager for our colleagues and fellow academics to share with us a day in which we attempt to unpick the complexities of these emotional currents, and the role of material and cultural artefacts, film, literature, and philosophical attitudes that dealt with or perpetuate these dark legacies of the twentieth century into the twenty-first.\n\nIt is hoped papers presented on the day will be published as an edited collection.\n\nFrankenstein is a rich narrative about disability—and very rarely considered as such.

The novel offers a memorable first-person account of the creature’s\n\nexperience of being stigmatized and socially disabled by physical differences\n\nconsidered “deformities,” a process through which he becomes a monster and\n\nultimately claims monstrosity as his identity. The creature’s narrative is a harsh but\n\nnot unimaginable version of what a baby with physical singularities, pronounced\n\n“deformed” at birth, might experience being excluded from public spaces because of\n\n“ugliness” and denied sexual and reproductive agency. In the novel’s afterlife,\n\nhowever, it is almost always read as a story about science (though Victor goes rogue\n\nfrom the perspective of his professors) and medicine (though Victor never even\n\nfinishes his degree, and certainly never becomes “Doctor” Frankenstein). Through\n\nthese generative misrememberings of the novel’s details, Frankenstein (the cultural\n\nnarrative, not the novel) has become a provocative “doctor story” with much to say\n\nabout researchers, research ethics, and doctors’ responsibilities to their patients. In\n\nits bicentennial, however, I argue that it’s time to reclaim the text’s even greater\n\nvalue as a health humanities and body studies classic about the social construction\n\nof disability identity and sexuality.\n\nthe usefulness of the concept of dispositif for digital cinema, Rommy Albers and Soeluh van den Berg reflect on changes in the working routines in the film archive brought by integrating relational databases to the management of... more\n\nthe usefulness of the concept of dispositif for digital cinema, Rommy Albers and Soeluh van den Berg reflect on changes in the working routines in the film archive brought by integrating relational databases to the management of collections, and Caylin Smith shares experiences using digital forms of presentation in film exhibitions. It should be noted, however, that some essays seem to investigate their phenomenon conceptually, which does not appear to be in line with the formulated aim: does it really make sense to frame a discursive analysis of historical sources that corrects the historiography on the close-up as ‘apparatus’ or ‘technology’ (Jan Holmberg)? Also, Cécile Scémama’s approach to understand a video film as a ‘laboratory’ in which technologies of video and film editing can be analysed, seems to work rather as a metaphor. This notwithstanding, the collected essays clearly demonstrate that within the quite openly defined research problem, a number of approaches is possible and productive. The resulting heterogeneity is certainly consistent with the formulated aims and should be understood as a first mapping of the research territory. The essays demonstrate what kind of insights are to be gained from engaging with (film) apparatuses and technologies. This approach proves especially productive in those essays that investigate the (former) applications of technology or uses of an apparatus: statements about intended users; aims, promises and affordances of a certain technology; operating of apparatuses and the required level of skills; or the impact of technology on, e.g. filmic aesthetics can then be materially substantiated. This essay collection, though not explicitly, is also a call to film historians to not restrict themselves to textual analysis at this moment in time. The change from analogue to digital formats as standard in production and distribution not only has consequences for the accessibility of films; it also defines the conditions for future film historiography. Right now, museums are deciding on how to implement digital technologies. These decisions will not only affect which objects will be preserved and digitised, but they will also define how access to collections is provided and, in consequence, which forms of engaging with the data and thus, which research methods will be enabled. Scholars in (historical) film and media studies are well advised to raise their voice in this debate and to give the changes a form that assures an infrastructure for film history beyond predefined canons. In this light, the essays are more than just case studies; they also prove the potential in engaging with apparatuses and technologies and as such form a strong argument for a material turn in the discussion of the questions that are raised through digitisation. This is a slightly reworked translation from a (German) review published in MEDIENwissenschaft – Rezensionen – Review (04/2016): 473–475.\n\nIt’s always been a wild world, with humans telling stories of killer animals as soon as they could tell stories at all.

Movies are an especially popular vehicle for our fascination with fierce creatures. In Brute Force, Dominic Lennard takes a close look at a range of cinematic animal attackers, including killer gorillas, sharks, snakes, bears, wolves, spiders, and even a few dinosaurs. Lennard argues that animal horror is not so much a focused genre as it is an impulse, tapping into age-old fears of becoming prey. At the same time, these films expose conflicts and uncertainties in our current relationship with animals. Movies considered include King Kong, Jaws, The Grey, Them!, Arachnophobia, Jurassic Park, Snakes on a Plane, An American Werewolf in London, and many more. Drawing on insights from film studies, art history, cognitive science, and evolutionary psychology, Brute Force is an engaging critical exploration—and appreciation—of cinema’s many bad beasts.\n\n“The brilliance of Dominic Lennard’s Brute Force is not only that it is long overdue, but one didn’t realize it was due in the first place! Yet upon reflection and, of course, through Lennard’s engaging book, one realizes not only the ubiquity of animals in horror, but their utter centrality to so many classic horror films. In reading this, we can hear the distant rumble of footsteps of a genetically reborn Tyrannosaurus or the hurried pounding of our beloved Rover who has decided that he wants more than kibbles and bits for dinner—and we look mighty appetizing. ‘Groundbreaking’ is often overused, but in this case it truly fits.” — David Desser, coeditor of Tough Ain’t Enough: New Perspectives on the Films of Clint Eastwood\n\nThis paper brings together analyses of four films directed by Lucky McKee—May (2002), Sick Girl (2006), The Woman (2011), and All Cheerleaders Die (2013)—to trace connections between their queer female characters.

His films have often divided critics; he has been celebrated as a purveyor of female-focused indie horror, but has also been subject to accusations of misogyny through representation of gendered violence, and has been criticised elsewhere for creating ‘faux-feminist’ characters which embody bisexual and lesbian stereotypes to monstrous effect.\n\nWhile acknowledging the potential for this confusion (as a result of a thoughtful approach to sexuality which is nonetheless often represented in the brash caricatures of McKee’s aesthetic), I argue that McKee employs female sexuality, and notably female bi- and homosexuality, as part of a radical approach to interrogating patriarchal heteronormativity and its inherent violence. Queer characters directly confront a violent, controlling father in The Woman, reject homophobia and matriarchal norms in Sick Girl, and seek revenge against a misogynistic high school football team in Cheerleaders, while May addresses both the Othering of queerness and the delegitimisation or erasure of bisexual identity. McKee’s films, rather than demonising queer female identity for the sake of monstrosity, instead demonstrate the complex thematic significance of queerness in contemporary indie horror."
