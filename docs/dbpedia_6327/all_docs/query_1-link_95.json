        "text": "by James Newman\n\nViy tells the story of a mischievous theology student named Thomas Brutus who is called to read scripture beside the coffin of a recently deceased young woman. For three consecutive evenings, her father locks Thomas inside the rural church/barn where his daughter's coffin has been placed. Promptly at midnight, she then rises from the coffin -- for she was a witch -- and a savage battle takes place between the forces of good and evil. With chalk, Thomas marks off a circle around himself, and this keeps the evil forces from destroying him. But this doesn't stop the witch from trying to overpower him. Ultimately she calls forth the denizens of hell to assist her."
