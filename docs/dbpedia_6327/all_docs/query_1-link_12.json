I always put this on my Halloween watchlist and never get around to it, which is a shame because this would be perfect!\n\nCreepy, coffin surfing, the wilting daisy crown in her hair. Even a very 'well, that was fun, back to life' (or death, depending) ending where the villagers discuss what really happened...but no one knows. And when they had to prise the flaps off the viy's eyes! I'm smiling just thinking about it.\n\nFunnier than I was expecting, too: the scene where he's like 'I must have music' of course someone immediately produces a tin pipe. #149\n\nThe simple beauty of handcrafted sets and monster costumes, the intensity of the witch, the strange folktale narrative's twists and turns wrapped around something almost sensible, the monks giving a goat a book... It's not simply a preference for older ways of doing things or some sort of nostalgia; it's about seeing depth and life in a fucking movie. The huge costume of the demon at the end wouldn't be out of place in a Muppet film (I say that as both the highest of praise and an admission of its unreality), but the way it portrays its own weight (the rumbling, the eyelids) does more for the scene's atmosphere (intimidating), whimsy (it opens the world up), and the performance…\n\nSpooky Scary Horrorthons 6 - Film #11\n\nWhat starts out looking like a wild stoner comedy set in the picturesque countryside of Ukraine soon turns into a tragedy about a frightened man struggling with his fate while a witch mocks him from beyond the grave. As these mystical events unfold things get quite wacky.\n\nThe folklore roots of Viy feel incredibly apparent, with all the obvious morality lessons and whatnot. The grey, sluggish state of the world surrounding our religious protagonist seem to amplify the evolving state of misery and dread that he succumbs to as he continues to have his nightly confrontations with the witch.\n\nThe true action of Viy takes place in a church which turns out to…\n\nI like watching witch movies mostly for vibes and solidarity. I don't find witches especially scary. Generally unless we are up to some Evil Queen or Helena Markos #girlboss shit we spend our time foraging, researching, meditating, communing, tripping out, chanting, riding the night, u know, stuff that rules!!! In order for there to be witch horror someone somewhere has to fuck with a witch. Now this witch can be living or dead it does not matter. Life and death, materiality and immateriality, are less salient for witches than they are for people who care about such things? They are an alteration in form, in degree, not in kind, not in being.
