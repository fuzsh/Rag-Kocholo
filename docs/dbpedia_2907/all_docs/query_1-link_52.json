Introduction Page 1 CHAPTER 1 ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING INTRODUCTION : 1.0 GENERAL INTRODUCTION: Originally the term Environment was used to mean the surroundings in which the man lives, works and plays including the physical factors without giving much importance to living components. But in the changed situations of rapid industrialization and consequent pollution and other problems, the dimensions of total environment were enlarged to include not only the physical factors, but also factors as components of the environment. Thus the term environment is defined as all the systems namely atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere (non living components) and biosphere (living components) surroundings us. It includes air, water, food, the pollutions, waste materials and other ecological problems, which effect the life and health of human beings and other life. Environmental engineering is concerned with the control of all those which exercise or may exercise deleterious effect on his development, health and sundial with the consideration of the physical, economic and social impact of the control measures applied. Environmental engineering deals with the application of engineering principles to the control, modification and adaption\n\n6. Page 2 Environmental Engineering of the physical, chemical and biological factors of the environment in the interest of man’s health, comfort and social wellbeing. In this textbook, some aspects of environmental engineering, such as ecology, water supply systems, waste water treatment and disposal, rural sanitation and air pollution are presented. If proper arrangements for the collection, treatment and disposal of all the wastes produced from the town or city such as water from bathroom, kitchens, lavatory basins, house and street washings, from various industrial processes semi liquid wastes of human and animal excreta, dry refuse of house and street sweepings, broken furniture, crockery, wastes from Industries etc are not made, they will go on accumulating and create (i) Buildings and roads will be in danger due to accumulation of spent water in their foundation (ii) Disease causing bacteria will bread up in the stagnate water (iii) Drinking water will be polluted. Total insanitary conditions will be developed in the town or city and it will become impossible for the public to live in the town or city. Therefore in the interest of the community of the town or city it is most essential to collect, treat and dispose of all the waste products of city in such a way that it may not cause any problem to the people residing in the town. Table 1.1. illustrates waste products of town or city (outlines of sanitary engineering).\n\n8. Page 4 Environmental Engineering 1.1 OBJECT OF PROVIDING SEWERAGE WORKS: The following are the aims and objects of sewage disposal. 1. Proper disposal of human excreta to a safe place, before its starts decomposition and may cause insanitary conditions in the locality 2. To take out all kinds of wastewater from the locality immediately after its use, so that mosquitos, files, bacteria etc may not breed in it and cause nuisance. 3. Final disposal of sewage on land or in near by water- courses after some treatment so that receiving land or water may not get polluted and unsafe for its further use. 4. As far as possible the fertilizing elements of sewage may be used in growing crops through farming and getting some income in addition to the disposal of sewage 5. In unsewered areas, the treatment of sewage from individual houses, should be done by septic tank or other suitable means and the effluent should be disposed of. 6. If the sewage is disposed of on land, it should have such s degree of treatment that it may not affect the sub-soil in anyway. 1.2 DEFINITIONS OF TERMS-SULLAGE, SEWAGE, SEWER AND SEWERAGE: Sullage: The liquid waste from latrines, Urinals stable etc is known as sullage.\n\n9. Introduction Page 5 Sewage: The term sewage is used to indicate the liquid waste from the community and it includes sullage, discharge from latrines, urinals, stable etc industrial waste and storm water. Sewer: The underground conducts or drains through which is conveyed are known as the sewers. Sewerage: The entire science of collecting and carrying sewage by water carriage system through sewers is known as sewerage. Garbage: The term indicates dry refuse which includes decayed fruits, grass, leaves, paper pieces, sweepings, vegetables etc. Refuse: The term refuse is used to indicate all kinds of dry wastes of the community (i.e.,) street and house sweepings, garbage etc. 1.3 CLASSIFICATION OF SEWAGE: 1. Storm Sewage: Which includes surface runoff developed during and immediately after rainfall over the concerned area. 2. Sanitary Sewage: Which includes the liquid wastes of domestic and industrial places. This sewage is extremely foul in nature and required to be disposed of very carefully. 1.4 SYSTEMS OF SEWERAGE METHODS: 1. Conservancy System: In this system various types of refuse and storm water are collected, conveyed and disposed off separately by different methods in this system. This method is also called dry system and is in practice from very ancient times. This is method is adopting in small towns, villages and\n\n10. Page 6 Environmental Engineering undeveloped portions of large city even it is out of date system. In this method garbage or dry refuse is collected from the dustbins and conveyed by trucks or covered carts once or twice in a day. All the uncombustible portions such as sand, dust, clay, ashes etc are used for filling low lying areas and combustible portions such as dry leaves, waste paper, broken furniture etc… are burnt. The decaying fruits, vegetables, grass are first dried and then disposed of by burning or in the manufacture of manure. Human excreta or night soil is collected in separate liquid and semi-liquid wastes by animal drawn carts, trucks or tractor trailors and buried in trenches. After 2-3 years the buried night soil is converted into an excellent manure which can be used for growing crops. In this system sullage and storm water are also carried separately in closed or open drains upto the point of disposal, where they are allowed to mix up with streams, rivers or sea. ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES: ADVANTAGES: 1. Initial cost is low, because storm water can pass through open drains. 2. The quantity of sewage reaching at the treatment plant before disposal is low. 3. The sewer section is small and no deposit of silting because storm water goes in open drains.\n\n11. Introduction Page 7 DISADVANTAGES: 1. Possibility of storm water may mix with sewers causing heavy load on treatment plant. 2. In crowded lanes it is difficult lay two sewers or construct drains roadside causing great inconvenience to the traffic. 3. More land is required for human excreta. 4. Liquid refuse may get on access in the sub soil and pollute the underground water. 5. Aesthetic appearance of city cannot be increased. 6. Decomposition of sewage causes insanitary conditions which are dangerous to the public health. 7. This system is completely depends upon the mercy of sweepers at every time and may possibility of spreading of diseases in the town if they are on strike. 2. WATER CARRIAGE SYSTEM: In this system, the excremental matters are mixed up in the large quantity of water and are taken out from the city through properly designed sewerage systems where they are disposed off after necessary treatment in a satisfactory manner. The sewage so formed in water carriage system consists of 99.9 percentage of water and 0.1 percentage of solid matters. All the solid matters remain in suspension in the sewage and donot change the specific gravity of water. So all the hydraulic formulae can be directly used in the design of sewerage system and treatment plants.\n\n12. Page 8 Environmental Engineering MERITS AND DEMERITS OF WATER CARRIAGE SYSTEM: The following are the merits of water carriage system. 1. It is hygienic method because all the excremental matters are collected and conveyed by water only. 2. There is no nuisance in the streets of town and risk of epidemics reduced because of underground sewerage system. 3. Less space is occupied in crowded lane as only one sewer is laid 4. Self cleaning velocity can be obtained even at less gradients due to more quantity of sewage. 5. The land required for the disposal work is less as compared to conservancy system. 6. This system doesnot depend on manual labour at every time except when sewers get choked. 7. The usual water supply is sufficient and no additional water is required in water carriage system. 8. Sewer after proper treatment can be used fro various purposes. DEMERITS 1. This system is very costly in initial cost. 2. The maintenance of this system is also costly. 3. During monsoon large volume of sewage is to be treated compared to remaining period of year. COMPARISION OF CONSERVANCY AND WATER-CARRIAGE SYSTEMS:\n\n13. Introduction Page 9 CONSERVANCY SYSTEM 1. Very cheap in initial cost 2. Due to foul smell from latrines, they are to be constructed away from the living room 3. The aesthetic appearance of the city cannot be increased 4. Storm water is carried in usually surface drains, hence no problem of pumping the storm water 5. The quantity of waste liquid reaching the disposed point is less, hence it can be disposed of without any treatment. 6. This system is fully dependent on the human agency 7. As sewage is disposed of without any treatment it may pollute the natural water courses 8. For burying of excremental matter, large area is required. WATER-CARRIAGE SYSTEM 1. It involves high initial cost 2. As there is no foul smell, latrines remain clean and neat and hence are constructed with room. 3. Good aesthetic appearance of the city can be obtained. 4. Sewage is treated before disposing of ,it may or may not require pumping it depends on the topography of the town. 5. Large quantity of sewage highly polluted in nature, it requires its treatment before disposal so it is costly process. 6. This system is not dependent on the human agency 7. Sewage is treated upto required degree of sanitation. 8. Less area is required as compared to conservancy system.\n\n14. Page 10 Environmental Engineering 1.5 TYPES OF SEWERAGE SYSTEM AND THEIR SUITABILITY: The sewerage system are classified as follows: (a) Combined system (b) Separate system (c) Partially separate system (a) COMBINED SYSTEM: This system is best suited in areas having small rainfall, which is distributed, throughout the area, because at such places self-cleaning velocity will be available in every season. As only one sewer is laid in this system, it is best suited for crowded area because of traffic problems. The combined system can also be used in area having less sewage, to obtain the self-cleaning velocity. MERITS AND DEMERITS OF COMBINED SYSTEM: The following are the merits of combined system 1. There is no need of flushing because self-cleaning velocity is available at every place due to more quantity of sewage. 2. The sewage can be treated easily and economically because rainwater dilutes the sewage. 3. House plumbing can be done easily only one set of pipes will be required. DEMERITS: The following are the demerits of the combined system.\n\n15. Introduction Page 11 1. The initial cost is high as compared to seperate system 2. It is not suitable for areas having rainfall for smaller period of year because resulting in the silting up of the sewers due to self velocity is not available 3. During heavy rainfall, the overflowing of sewers will endanger the public health 4. If whole sewage is to be disposed of by pumping, it is uneconomical (b) SEPERATE SYSTEM: When domestic and industrial sewage are taken in one set of sewers, where as storm and surface water are taken in another set of sewers, it is called seperate system. MERITS AND DEMERITS OF COMBINED SYSTEM: The following are the merits of the seperate system 1. Since the sewage flows in seperate sewer, the quantity to be treated is small which results in economical design of treatment works. 2. Separate system is cheaper than combined system, because only sanitary sewage flows in closed sewer and storm water which is unfoul in nature can be taken through open channel or drains, whereas both types of sewage is to be carried in closed sewer in combined system 3. During disposal if the sewage is to be pumped, the separate system is cheaper 4. There is no fear of steam pollution.\n\n16. Page 12 Environmental Engineering DEMERITS: 1. Flushing is required at various points because self-cleaning velocity is not available due to less quantity of sewage 2. There is always risk that the storm water may enter the sanitary sewage sewer and cause over-flowing of sewer and heavy load in the treatment plant 3. Maintenance cost is more because of two sewers 4. In busy lanes laying of two sewers is difficult which also causes great inconvenience to the traffic during repairs (C) PARTIALLY SEPERATE SYSTEM: In the seperate system, if a portion of storm water is allowed to enter in the sewers carrying sewage and the remaining storm water flows in seperate set of sewers, it is called partially seperate system MERITS AND DEMERITS OF PARTIALLY SEPERATE SYSTEM: MERITS: 1. It is economical and reasonable size sewers are required because as it is an improvement over seperate system. 2. The work of house-plumbing is reduced because the rain water from roof, sullage from bath and kitchen, can be taken in the same pipe carrying the discharge from the water closets.\n\n17. Introduction Page 13 The water from all other places can be taken in seperate sewer or drain. 3. No flushing is required because small portion of storm water is allowed to enter in sanitary sewage. DEMERITS: 1. Cost of pumping is more than seperate system when pumping is required because portion of storm water is mixed. 2. There are possibilities of over-flow. 3. In dry weather, the self cleaning velocity may not develop.\n\n18. Page 14 Environmental Engineering SYNOPYSIS 1.

Page 16 Environmental Engineering CHAPTER 2 QUANTITY OF SEWAGE In order to find out suitable section of sewer, it is necessary to determine the quantity of sewage that will flow through the sewer. The sewage consists of dry weather flow and storm water. 2.1 QUANTITY OF DISCHARGE IN SEWERS: The quantity of discharge in sewers is mainly affected by the following factors. (i) Rate of water supply (ii) Population (iii) Type of area served as residential, industrial or commercial (iv) Ground water infiltration (i) RATE OF WATER SUPPLY: The rate of sewage may be 60 to 70 percent of water supply due to various reasons such as consumption, evaporation, use in industries etc. This may be changes daily, seasonal and also standard of living of people. (ii) POPULATION: As the population increases the quantity of sewage also increases because the consumption of water is more. (iii) TYPE OF AREA SERVED: The quantity of sewage depends upon the type of area as residential, industrial or commercial. The quantity is depends on population if it is residential, type of industry if it is industrial.\n\n21. Quantity of Sewage Page 17 Commercial and public places can be determined by studying the developing of other such places. (iv) GROUND WATER INFILTRATION: When sewers laid below the water table in the ground, the ground water may percolate in the sewer from the faulty joints and cracks in the pipelines. The quantity of infiltration water in the sewer depends upon the height of the water table about the sewer invert, permeability of soil, size and nature of the faults or cracks in the sewer line. As per the U.S.A. reports (i) 4.5 to 45 cum/hectare area/day (ii) 11 to 225 cum/hectare area/km length of the sewer line (iii) 0.7 to 7.2 cum/day/cm of dia of the sewer. DRY WEATHER FLOW: The sanitary sewage, which includes wastewater from residences and industries, is known as Dry Weather Flow (D.W.F) VARIABILITY OF FLOW: Practically the average sewage never flows in the sewer, it continuously varies from hour to hour of the day and season to season. The consumption of water in summer is more than in winter or rainy season and this change in consumption of water directly affects the quantity of sewage. Practically it has been\n\n22. Page 18 Environmental Engineering seen that the maximum to average flow of sewage is between 1.5 to 1.0 and average to minimum is between 1.2 to 1.0 2.2 DETERMINATION OF STORM WATER FLOW: The quantity of storm water, which is known as the wet weather flow (W.W.F), that will enter the sewer is to be carefully determined. The following are the factors mainly affect the quantity of storm sewage. (i) Intensity of rainfall (ii) Characteristics of catchment area (iii) Duration of storm (iv) Atmospheric temperature, wind and humidity Generally two methods are used to calculate the quantity of storm water. (i) Rational method (ii) Empirical formulae method (i) RATIONAL METHOD: In this method , the storm water quantity is determined by the rational formula C.i.A Q = --------- where Q=quantity o storm water in m3 /sec 360 C=Coefficient of runoff from table I=intensity of rainfall in mm/hour\n\n23. Quantity of Sewage Page 19 A=drainage area in hectares * The runoff coefficient ‘C’ is calculated (overall) A1C1 + A2C2 + ---------+ AnCn ∑AC = -------------------------------------- = ------------ A1 + A2 + --------------+ An ∑A Where A1, A2, A3 ------- An are the different types of areas And C1, C2, C3 ------- Cn are their runoff coeff. respectively from table. (ii) EMPIRICAL FORMULAE METHOD: For determining runoff from very large areas under specific conditions such as slope of land, imperviousness, rate of rainfall etc. These formulae are derived after long practical experience and collection of field data. (A) Burkli – Zeighar formula (used in switzerland) C.I.A 4 √S Q = ---------------- ----- 141.58 A (B) Mc.Math Formula (used in U.S.A) C.i.A 5 √S Q = ---------- ----- 148.35 A (C) Fuller’s Formula\n\n24. Page 20 Environmental Engineering C. M 0.8 Q = -------------- 13.23 (D) Funnig’s Formula Q = 12.8 M 5/8 (E) Tallbot’s Formula Q = 22.4 M 1/4 Where Q = runoff in cum/sec C = runoff coefficient i = intensity of rainfall in cm/hour S = slope of the area in metre per thousand metre A = drainage area in hectare M = drainage area in square km 2.3 SURFACE DRAINAGE: The sullage from kitchens, bathrooms and storm water, which passes through the surface drains, is called surface drainage. They are less hygienic as they are open and exposed to atmosphere REQUIREMENTS: 1. The inner surface of surface should be plastered 2. The joints of drains should be properly and neatly finished\n\n25. Quantity of Sewage Page 21 3. The drain should be laid such a gradient that self-cleansing velocity is developed 4. They should be laid on easy curves 5. They should be properly designed with reasonable provision of free board SHAPES OF SURFACE DRAINS: The following are the four shapes, which are commonly adopted in the construction of surface drains as shown in fig 2.1. 1. Rectangular surface drains 2. Semi-circular surface drains 3. U-shaped surface drains 4. V-shaped surface drains Fig 2.1 Types of Surface drains\n\n26. Page 22 Environmental Engineering 1. RECTANGULAR SURFACE DRAINS: These drains are suitable for carrying heavy discharge. They however donot develop the required velocity when depth of flow is small and they get easily deposited. 2. SEMI-CIRCULAR SURFACE DRAINS: These are suitable for streets where the discharge to be accommodated is of small quantity. These drains are readymade semi-circular sections of stoneware or concrete or asbestors cement pipes. 3. U-SHAPED SURFACE DRAINS: These drains are easy to construct and they combine the advantages of semi-circular drains and rectangular surface drains. 4. V-SHAPED SURFACE DRAINS: These drains posses better hydraulic properties but they are difficult to construct. These drains will carry fluctuating to construct. These drains will carry fluctuating discharge without depositing solids at any point and capable of producing a good velocity. These drains are constructed either in brick masonary or stone masonary in cement mortar. The inside surface is smoothly plastered with rich cement mortar. The drains are provided with suitable gradients to meinatin the velocity within the range so as to avoid either silting or scouring.\n\n27. Quantity of Sewage Page 23 2.4 Use of nomograms as per IS 1742 to determine the unknown values of gradient, diameter, discharge and velocity. In the design of sewerage scheme for a town, the calculations have to be done for every sewerline to obtain the necessary gradients, the given self cleansing velocities and estimated discharge use of the formula for every calculation and thus number of calculations flow whole scheme becomes a cumbersome job. This work is simplified by adopting tables, nomograms, partial flow diagrams etc prepared on the basis of the appropriate formula. Nomogram shown in fig 2.2 is very commonly used in the design of sewers. This nomogram is based on mannings formula in which value of ‘n’ is taken as 0.013. The values given in the Nomograma are for sewers running full. As per IS 1742, the Nomogram shown in fig can be used conveniently. For example if the required discharge of a sewer for which n=0.013 is 224 lit/sec, and the grade is 0.00125, a line is drawn through these two values. The intersection of this line on velocity scale and diameter scale gives the corresponding values. Thus for this example diameter of sewer is found to be 600mm and the velocity to be maintained is 0.765 m/sec. Hence if two values are known, the remaining two values can be easily got from the nomogram.\n\n28. Page 24 Environmental Engineering Fig 2.2 Nomogram\n\n29. Quantity of Sewage Page 25 SYNOPYSIS 1. The determination of quantity of sewage is essential for the design of system of collection, pumping, treatment and disposal 2. The sanitary sewage is called dry weather flow (DWF) which depends upon the following factors a. Rate of water supply b. Population c. Type of area d. Infiltration of ground water into sewers e. Exfiltration 3. The variations in the flow of sewage may be seasonal, monthly, daily and hourly and to get maximum flow rate the average flow rate of sewage is to be multiplied by a peak factor 4. Nomograms are used in the design of sewers for calculating the gradients, diameter of pipes, velocities and quantities of sewage based on mannings formula 5. The factors affecting storm water flow are a. Intensity and duration of rainfall b. Area of catchment\n\n30. Page 26 Environmental Engineering c. Store and shape of catchment d. Nature of soil e. Initial moisture content in the soil f. Number and size of ditches available in the area 6. Determination of storm water flow by 1. Rational formula 2. Empirical formulae 7.

Explain different types of surface drains 2. Explain different factors that effect quantity of discharge in sewers 3. How do you estimate the storm water by rational method and empirical formulae method?\n\n32. Page 28 Environmental Engineering CHAPTER 3 SEWERAGE SYSTEMS Sewerage are closed conducts are called sewers and are laid under ground for conveying foul discharges from water-closets of public and domestic buildings, chemical mixed water from industries without creating any nuisance outside the town. Sewers should have such cross-section that self-cleaning velocity should be developed even during dry weather flow. No deposit should settle down in the bed of sewers under any circumstances. These should be laid in the town at such a slope that water in case of flood in river at the outlet should not come out from manholes and cause insanitary conditions 3.1 DIFFERENT SHAPES OF CROSS-SECTIONS FOR SEWERS CIRCULAR AND NON CIRCULAR Generally the sewers of circular shape are adopted because of following facts 1. Circular shape affords least perimeter and hence construction cost is minimum for the same area of other shape 2. Deposition of organic matter are reduced to minimum because of no corners 3. They are easy to manufacture or construct and handle\n\n33. Sewerage Systems Page 29 4. Because of circular shape, these are subjected to hoop compression hence the concrete required is minimum and no reinforcement is required 5. They posses excellent hydraulic properties because they provide the maximum hydraulic mean depth when running full or half full. The circular sewers prove to be best when the discharge doesnot vary too much and the chances of sewers running with very low depths (less than half) are less. However the sewers of non-circular shapes are also used for the following reasons 1. To bring down the cost of construction 2. to improve the velocity of flow when the depth of sewage is low 3. to secure more structural strength 4. to simplify the process of construction 5. to make them large enough for a man to enter for cleaning or repairing SHAPES OF NON-CIRCULAR SHAPES: The following are the non-circular shapes, which are commonly, used for sewers. 1. BASKET HANDLE SECTION: In this type of sewer, the upper portion of sewer has got the shape of a basket-handle as shown in fig. 3.1. The bottom portion is narrower and carries small\n\n34. Page 30 Environmental Engineering discharges during mansoon and combined sewage is carried through the full section. This shape of sewer is not generally used at present. Fig 3.1 2. CATENARY-SHAPED SECTION: In this type of sewer, the shape of sewer is in the form of a catenary and only gravity force is acted upon this sewer. This is suitable for tunnelling work. 3. EGG-SHAPED OR OVOID SECTION: This type of sewer is suitable for carrying combined flow. The main advantage of this type of sewer is that it gives slightly higher velocity during low Fig 3.2\n\n35. Sewerage Systems Page 31 flow than a circular sewer of the same capacity. But construction of this section is difficult and less stable than circular section. Inverted egg-shaped sewer gives better stability and carries heavy discharges. The details are as shown in fig 3.2. 4. HORSE-SHOE SECTION: This type of sewers are used for the construction in tunnel to carry heavy discharges, such as truck and outfall sewers. This is also suitable when the available headroom for the construction of sewer is limited. The invert of the sewer may be flat, circular or paraboloid and top is semi- circular with sides vertical or inclined as shown in fig 3.3. 5. PARABOLIC SECTION: This type of sewers are suitable fro carrying comparatively small quantities of sewage and economical in construction. The invert of sewer may be flat or parabolic and upper arch of the sewer takes the form of parabola as shown in fig 3.4. Fig 3.3 Fig 3.4\n\n36. Page 32 Environmental Engineering 6. RECTANGULAR OR BOX TYPE SECTION: The rectangular or box type section of sewer is stable and it is easy to construct as shown in fig 3.5. It is some times used to work as a storage tank during the tide it becomes necessary to store the sewage for some period. 7. SEMI-CIRCULAR: This type of sewers are suitable for constructing large sewers with less available headroom and it posses better hydraulic properties as shown in figure 3.6. Fig 3.5 Fig 3.6\n\n37. Sewerage Systems Page 33 8. SEMI-ELLIPTICAL SECTION: This type of the section is suitable to carry heavy discharges and adopted for soft soil, as it is more stable. The dia of sewer may be more than 1.8m and posses good hydraulic properties except at low depths as shown in fig 3.7. Fig 3.7 9. U-SHAPED SECTION: The shape of this section is the true shape of letter as shown in fig. Or small trench of U shape can be setup in the larger section of sewer as shown in fig 3.8. The trench is known as the cunette and adopted for a combined sewer having predominant flow of storm water.\n\n38. Page 34 Environmental Engineering Fig 3.8 3.2 BRIEF DESCRIPTION AND CHOICE OF TYPES OF SEWERS The following factors are to be carefully considered while making selection for the materials of sewer. 1. Cost: The cost should be moderate and reasonable 2. Durability: The material should be durable 3. Imperviousness: The material of sewer should be impervious nature 4. Resistance to Abrasion: The material should possess enough resistance to abrasion caused due to grit moving with high velocity. 5. Resistance to corrosion: The material should be capable of offering resistance to the corrosion because the sewage posseses corrosive qualities 6. Weight: The material should possess moderate weight so as to make easy handling and transportation. The following are the various materials, which are used for sewers\n\n39. Sewerage Systems Page 35 (i) Asbestos cement sewers (ii) Brick sewers (iii) Cast-Iron sewers (iv) Cement concrete sewers (v) Corrugated iron sewers (vi) Plastic sewers (vii) Steel sewers (viii) Stoneware sewers (ix) Wood sewers STONEWARE SEWERS: The stoneware sewers are also known as the vitrified clay sewers or salt-glazed sewers and they are prepared from various clays and shapes in required proportion, allowed to dry and then burnt in a kiln. A small quantity of salt is added to kiln get glass like glaze on the surface of pipes. ADVANTAGES: 1. These pipes are strong enough to take backfilling and traffic 2. The interior surface of sewers are smooth and impervious 3. The overall performance is very good 4. These sewers are cheap and easily available 5. These sewers are durable and better resistance to corrosion & erosion\n\n40. Page 36 Environmental Engineering 6. These sewers are capable of withstand hydraulic pressure upto 0.15N/mm2 and bear a load of soil of about 4.5 m depth DISADVANTAGES: 1. These are brittle in nature and may damage in handling or transport. 2. These are not strong enough to allow sewage under pressure. 3. These are difficult to handle or transport because of heavy weight. CAST IRON SEWERS: The cast sewers possess high strength and they are durable. These are available in sizes from 150mm to 750mm diameter. These sewers can resists the action of acids in sewage if the inner surface is coated with paint or cement concrete. The cast-Iron sewers are used for following special purpose 1. Danger of contamination against leakages. 2. Expensive road surface like C.C. can be avoided. 3. Heavy external loads under railway lane, foundation. 4. Under high pressure. 5. The places subjected to considerable differences in temperature. 6. Where the ground is likely to subject to heavy movements and vibrations. 7. Where wet ground required to reduce infiltration.\n\n41. Sewerage Systems Page 37 DISADVANTAGES: 1. Cost is high 2. Transportation and handling is difficult CEMENT CONCRETE SEWERS: The cement concrete sewers may be plain or reinforced. The plain cement concrete sewers are used upto the diameter of 600mm and beyond 600mm reinforcement is provided. ADVANTAGES: 1. These are strong and imperivious. 2. Larger diameter can be made. 3. Inner surface of sewer is smooth. 4. For attack of chemical and errosive actions the inner surface should be lined with vitrified clay. DISADVANTAGES: 1. Heavy weight transportation and handling is difficult. 2. Joints should be carefully filled. 4. A.C.PIPES: These sewers are made from a mixture of asbestos fibres and cement. They are available upto sizes of 900mm.\n\n42. Page 38 Environmental Engineering ADVANTAGES: 1. Easy to cut and join. 2. Durable and good resistance to corrosion. 3. The inside surface is smooth. 4. Light in weight and hence easy to handle. DISADVANTAGES: 1. Brittle and cannot stand impact forces during handling operations. 2. The structural strength is poor and hence cannot be laid to resist heavy external loads. 3.3 LAYING OF SEWERS: The construction of sewer consists of the following works a) Marking center lines of sewers. b) Excavation of trenches. c) Checking the gradient. d) Preparation of bedding. e) Laying of sewers. f) Jionting. g) Back filling.\n\n43. Sewerage Systems Page 39 MARKING CENTER LINE OF SEWER: The centre line of a sewers are marked on the streets and roads from the plans starting from the lowest point or outfall of the main proceeding upwards. The setting out of work is done by means of chain and theodolite or compass. For checking the centre line during the construction generally wooden pegs or steel spikes are driven at 10 meters intervals on a line parallel to the centre where while laying sewers, they will not disturb them. For checking the levels of sewer pipes and their alignment temporary benchmarks are established at 200-400 metres intervals. The reduced level (R.L) of these benchmarks should be calculated with respect to G.T.S benchmarks. On the centre line position of sewer appurtenances are also marked EXCAVATION TRENCHES: After marking the layout of the sewer lines on the ground, the first step is the removal of pavement, which starts from the lower end of the sewers and proceeds upwards. Pickaxes, spade or pneumatic drills can be used in case of removing concrete pavements. After removing pavements, the excavation of trenches is done manually or machinery. The width of trench depends upon the dia of sewer and depth of sewer- line below the ground level. The width of sewerline is 15cm more than external diameter of sewer for easiness in lowering and adjusting the sewerpipe. The minimum trench width of 60 to 100cm is necessary for conveniently laying and jointing of even very small size sewers. The excavation of trench sides require shoring and shuttering and also\n\n44. Page 40 Environmental Engineering dewatering is done by gravity method or pumping method as shown in fig. 3.9. Fig 3.9 Excavation of Trenches PREPARATION OF BEDDING: Trenches are excavated with proper grade so that sewage may flow in sewer due to gravitational flow only. The centre line of sewers and their grades are transferred from the ground by means of sight rail and boning rod shown in fig no. 3.10.\n\n45. Sewerage Systems Page 41 Fig 3.10 Laying of Sewer Pipes When a sewer has to be laid in a soil underground strata or in a reclaimed land, the trench shall be excavated deeper than what is ordinarily required trench bottom or rock. In the case of very bad soil the trench bottom shall be filled in with cement concrete of appropriate grade. In areas subject to subsidence the pipe sewer shall be laid on a timber platform or concrete cradle supported on piles. In the case of cast- in-site sewers and R.C.C section with reinforcement, bearing capacity is encountered and soil stabilization shall be done either by rubber, concrete or wooden crib. The various types of Pipe-Beddings are as shown in Fig. 3.11.\n\n46. Page 42 Environmental Engineering Fig 3.11 Various types pipe-bedding LAYING: Smaller size pipes can be laid by the pipe-layers directly by hand only. But heavier and larger size pipes are lowered in the trenches by passing ropes around them and supporting through hock.\n\n47. Sewerage Systems Page 43 It is the common practice to lay the pipes with their socket end upgrade for easiness in joining. After lowering the pipes these are brought near and spigot end of one pipe is placed in the socketed end of the other after properly placing and arranging the pipes they are suitably joined. The joints are carefully cured for sufficient time. JOINTING OF SEWERS: The C.I.Pipes shall be examined for line and level and the space left in the socket shall be filled in by pouring molten piglead of best- quality as for IS:782 and IS 3114. For concrete pipes, the collars shall be placed symmetrically over the end of two pipes and the annual space between the inside of the collar and the outside of the pipe shall be filled with hempyarn soaked in tar or cement slurry tamped with just-sufficient quantity of water to have consistency of semi-dry condition, well packed and thoroughly rammed with caulking tools and then filled with cement mortar 1:2. The joints shall be finished off with a fillet slopping at 45° to the surface of the pipe and cured for 24 hours. Any plastic solution or cement mortar that may have squeezed in the pipe shall be removed to leave the inside of the pipe perfectly clean. For stoneware pipes, all the joints shall be caulked with tarred gasket in one length for each joint and sufficiently long to entirely surround the spigot end of the pipe. The gasket shall then be filled with 1:2 cement sand mortar in a semi-dry condition and a fillet shall be formed round the joint with trowel forming an angle of 45° with the barrel of the pipe as per IS 4217. Rubber gasket may also be used for jointing.\n\n48. Page 44 Environmental Engineering TESTING OF SEWERS: Following two tests are done for testing of sewer pipes. 1. WATER TEST: Each section of the sewer is tested for water tightness preferably between the manholes. To prevent the change in alignment and disturbance after the pipes have been laid, it is desirable to backfill the pipes upto the top, keeping atleast given length of pipe at the joints. Testing of sewers done by plugging the upper end with a provision for an air outlet pipe with stopcock. The water is filled through a funnel connected at the lower end provided with a plug. After expelling the air through the air outlet, the stopcock is closed and water level in the funnel is raised to 2m above the invert at the upper end. Water level is noted after 30 minutes in the funnel and quantity of water required to restore the original water in the funnel is determined. The pipeline under pressure is then inspected while the funnel is still in position. There should not be any leak in the pipe or the joint except small sweating on the pipe surface which is allowed. Leakage in 30 minutes determined by measuring the replenished water in the funnel should not exceed 15ml for smaller and 60 ml for larger diameter pipes for 100m length. 2. AIR TESTING: This testing is done in large dia. Pipes when the required quantity of water is not available it is done by subjecting the stretch of pipe to an air pressure of 100mm of water by means of hand pump. If the pressure is maintained at 75mm, the joints shall be assumed to be water tight. In\n\n49. Sewerage Systems Page 45 case drop is more than 25mm the leaking joints shall be traced and suitably treated to ensure water-tightness. The exact position of leak can be detected by applying soap solution to all the joints in the line and looking for air bubbles. BACK-FILLING OF TRENCHES: After testing and removing defects of pipeline, the trenches are back filled with excavated soil after removal of pebbles, stone-pieces and lamps by ramming the soil in layers using with water. When the height reaches to 60cm above the crown of the pipe, back filling is stopped for atleast one weak for weathering. After a week, again backfilling is started in layers and the trench is filled 15cm above the ground level. During the course of time the back filled soil gets compacted and the filled soil comes to the ground level. Back filling will be after 7 days for precast pipes and 14 days after in the case of cast-in-site sewers. Reinstatement of the pavement is carried out after about two months after the proper consolidation of the backfill material and there is no danger of risk of crank or settlement in the pavement.\n\n50.

Sewer Appurtenances Page 49 CHAPTER 4 SEWER APPURTENANCES Sewer system require various types of appurtenances for their proper functioning and maintenances. If sewerage system will not be maintained properly, salt, ashes, fats, oils and greasy matters etc will choke the sewerline. Therefore for the proper operation and maintenance of sewerage system, various devices like manholes, lamp holes, drop manholes, street inlets, flushing tanks, catch basins, ventilating shafts and storm role of works etc are essential, which should be inaccessible to the public. 1.1.1 MANHOLES LOCATION: Manholes are provided at every change of alignment, gradient or diameter of the sewer. FUNCTION: Manholes are provided for inspection, cleaning, repairs and maintenance of the sewer. CONSTRUCTION: A Manhole consists of a) Working chamber. b) An access shaft and c) A strong cover on the top flush with the road level. a) WORKING CHAMBER: The working chamber has such a size, so that necessary examination and cleaning can be done easily. The minimum internal size of the chamber are as follows.\n\n54. Page 50 Environmental Engineering (i) For depth of 0.8m or less __________ 0.75m x 0.75m (ii) For depth between 0.8m and 2.1m _____1.2m x 0.9m (iii) For depth more than 2.1m __________ 1.2m x 0.9m or 1.4dia circular chamber. b) ACCESS SHAFT: The access shaft provides an access to the working chamber. The shaft is formed, by corbelling the working chamber on three as shown in fig no. 4.1. So that the cover frame can be fitted in the opening, the minimum internal dimensions of the access shaft are 0.5 x 0.5m Fig no. 4.1 Manhole\n\n55. Sewer Appurtenances Page 51 COVER: At the top of manhole, the manhole cover of cast iron or R.C.C is provided to cover the opening depending upon the type of traffic on the road. The manhole covers are provided flush with the road level. The bottom of the manhole is usually made of concrete slightly sloped at the top towards the open channels, which are in continuation of the sewer line. The channels are sometimes lined with half-round sewer pipe section. The top surface of the concrete is called benching and the man stands on its top during cleaning and inspection of the sewerlines over the cement concrete walls not less than 20cm thickness are constructed. Circular shape is structurally more stable and stronger though it is difficult in construction. The maximum distance between two manholes should be 30m and the distance between the manhole and gully chambers should not exceed 6m. 4.1.2 DROP MANHOLE: If the difference in level between the branch sewer and main sewer is within 60cm and there is sufficient roof within the working chamber, the connecting pipe may be directly brought through the manhole wall by providing a ramp in benching. Such manholes which drop the level of invert of the incoming sewer, by providing a vertical shaft are called drop manholes.\n\n56. Page 52 Environmental Engineering The main purpose being to avoid the splashing of sewage on the man working and on the masonary work. The branch sewer line is connected to the manhole in such a way that it can be cleaned and rodded when necessary. For inspection of the incoming sewage and cleaning of vertical shaft, the vertical shaft is taken upto the ground level as shown in fig no. 4.2. Fig No. 4.2 Drop Manhole 4.1.3 STREET INLETS Street inlets or gullies are the openings in the street a or b or gutter to collect the storm water and surface wash flowing along the\n\n57. Sewer Appurtenances Page 53 street and convey it to storm or combined sewer by means of stoneware pipes of 25 to 30cm diameter. Fig No.4.3 shows the most useful location of street inlet at the street junction in such way that the storm water may not flow across any of the streets or flood the cross walks causing interference with the traffic street inlets are of three types. Fig No. 4.3 Street Inlets 1. CURB INLET: In which an opening is provided in the road curb for the entrance of storm water. The gutter opening bars are provided to prevent the passage of dry-leaves, papers etc in the sewer line as shown in fig no. 4.4.\n\n58. Page 54 Environmental Engineering Fig 4.4 Curb Inlet 2. GUTTER INLET: These are placed directly below the road gutter and storm water directly enters them from the top. Such inlets catch very large volume of water and are most suitable in roads having steep slopes. These inlets are provided with cast Iron gratings at their top to prevent floating matters entering the sewer. The top grating should be sufficiently strong the bear the traffic loads. The main difficulty with such inlets is that of the heavy cost and these are mostly stolen and the pit remain uncovered as shown in fig no. 4.5. Fig No. 4.5 Gutter Inlet\n\n59. Sewer Appurtenances Page 55 3. COMBINED GUTTER AND CURB INLET: These inlets in which the storm water enters from both the gutter and curb as shown in fig no. 4.6. Fig 4.6 Combined Gutter and Curb Inlet 4.1.4 CATCH BASINS: These are small masonary chambers (75 to 90cm in diameter and 75 to 90cm deep) which are constructed below the street inlet to prevent the flow of grit, sand or debris in the sewer lines. The outlet pipe of catch basin is fixed about 60cm above bottom as shown in fig no. 4.7. The outlet pipe is provided with a trap to prevent the escape of odours from the sewer to the catch basins. Catch basins are provided in the following sections.\n\n60. Page 56 Environmental Engineering Fig 4.7 Catch Basins 1. When the sewers are laid at very small gradient and velocity of flow is less than self-cleaning velocity. 2. When the drains are passing along the water bound mechadam road or in sandy area and market. Catch basins collect the solids from the storm water. These solids are to be removed at frequent intervals for the proper functioning of the catch basin otherwise they will block the passage of storm water in the sewers resulting in the flooding of the streets creating nuisance. Nowadays catch basins are not providing and street inlet may be directly connected with the sewers.\n\n61. Sewer Appurtenances Page 57 4.1.5 FLUSHING TANKS: These are masonary or concrete chambers to flush the sewers when the sewers gradients are flat and velocity of sewage is very low. These are usually provided at the beginning point of the sewers and may be either are automatic or worked by hand. In automatic flushing tank, the water is automatically released from the tank at required intervals, which can be adjusted by supply tap and flushes the sewer as shown in fig no. 4.8. It consists of U-tube with bell cap at its one end connects the chamber with sewer. With the water level reaches certain level in the chamber, siphonic action takes place and the whole water of the chamber rushes to the sewer pipe and flushes it. The capacity of these tanks is usually 9 to 14 litre and may be adjusted in such a way as to work twice or thrice a day depending upon the quantity of deposits in the sewer and size of sewer.

Sewer Appurtenances Page 59 OBJECT: The main object of providing a storm water regulator is to divert the excess storm water to the natural stream or river. The excess sewage will be mainly composed of storm water and it will therefore be not foul in nature and hence decrease in load on the treatment units or pumping stations. TYPES: 1. LEAPING WEIR: Leaping weir is used to indicate the gap or opening in the invert of a combined sewer. The intercepting weir runs at right angles to the combined sewer. If the discharge exceeds certain limit, the excess sewage leaps or jumps across the weir and it is carried to the natural stream or river as shown in fig no. 4.9. Fig 4.9 Leaping Weir\n\n64. Page 60 Environmental Engineering 2. OVERFLOW WEIR: The excess sewage is allowed to overflow in the channel made in the manhole as shown in fig no. 4.10 and conveyed to the storm water sewer or channel. In order to prevent the escape of floating matter from the combined sewer channel, adjustable plates are provided. In another arrangement, the openings at suitable height above invert are provided along the length of combined sewer as shown. Fig 4.10 Overflow Weir 3. SYPHON SPILLWAY: The arrangement of diverting excess sewage from the combined sewer by the syphonic action is most effective because it operates on automatically and requires least maintenance.\n\n65. Sewer Appurtenances Page 61 However it is likely to be clogged due to narrow passage as shown in fig no. 4.11. Fig 4.11 Syphone Spill Way 4.1.7 INVERTED SIPHON: Inverted siphon is a sewer section which is constructed lower than the adjacent sewer section and which runs full under gravity with pressure greater than atmosphere as shown in Fig. No. 4.12.\n\n66. Page 62 Environmental Engineering Fig 4.12 Inverted Syphone PURPOSE: The main purpose of inverted siphon is to carry the sewerline below obstructions such as ground depressions, streams, rivers, railway etc. Siphon is so designed that a self-cleaning velocity of about 90cm/sec during achieved the period of minimum discharge. For this purpose, the siphon is usually made of three pipe sections-one for carrying minimum discharge, the other for maximum discharge and the third for combined flow in mansoons. The inlet chamber contains three channels, one for each pipe section. When channel no. 1 overflows, the sewage enters in channel no. 2 and pipe no. 2 comes into commission. Similarly, when channel no. 2 also overflows the sewage enters\n\n67. Sewer Appurtenances Page 63 channel no. 3 and pipe no. 3 comes into commission as shown in fig no. 4.12. The inlet chamber should be provided with screens to remove silt, grit etc from sewage before enters the siphon DISADVANTAGES OF SIPHON: 1. As the down gradient is not continuous in inverted siphon; the silting takes place. 2. It is not possible to give side connections to inverted siphons. 3. If inlet chamber is not properly designed, the floating matter contained in sewage will separate out and it will accumulate in the inlet chamber results in the inefficient functioning of the inverted siphon. 4.2 NECESSITY OF PUMPING SEWAGE-LOCATION AND COMPONENT PARTS OF PUMPING STATION. In sewerage system at some places the sewage cannot flow under its gravitational force only and requires lifting in following circumstances, it is becomes necessary to pump the sewage. 1. If some portion of the town is low-laying and the sewage cannot flow by gravity. 2. When basements are provided in the buildings, the sewage is pumped to the sewerline.\n\n68. Page 64 Environmental Engineering 3. If a ridge intervenes, sometimes it is economical to pump sewage, instead of providing a funnel. 4. When the land is flat and it not possible to get self-cleaning velocity, the sewers are laid at the required slope and after some interval they are allowed to flow under gravity. 5. At the treatment plants to rise it upto the plant for treatment. 6. At the outfall while disposing it is required to be pump if the level of the water course is higher than the outlet of the sewer. LOCATION OF PUMPING STATION: The following points should be considered while locating the site of pumping station 1. The topographical conditions of the city should be thoroughly studied to locate the best site of pumping station 2. If the quantity of sewage is very large, the site should be near to the disposal point or at a place where the sewage can be directly disposed off during emergencies 3. The site should be such that during flexed, it should not flooded with river water or seepage from the ground. 4. Provision should be made to pump all the sewage which will be received during worst conditions of rains\n\n69. Sewer Appurtenances Page 65 ELEMENTS OF PUMPING STATION: Every sewage pumping station consists of the following 1. Preliminary screening and grit chambers 2. Sump or wet well 3. Pumproom or dry well 4. Pumps with driving engine or motar 5. Miscellaneous accessories such as pipes, valves, fittings, flow recorder, emergency over-flow etc The capacity of pumping station is determined by the present and future sewage flows based on a designed period of 15years. While designing the pump house, provisions should be made for easy removal and installation of pumps and motars for periodical repairs and replacements (i) PRELIMINARY SCREENING AND GRIT CHANNELS: The sewage contains large amount of sand, gravel , rags , paper, leaves etc should be removed before pumping so as to prevent the wear and tear of pumping machinery and increasing its life. Large floating matter are removed by passing the see page through flat bar screens. After passing through the screens, the sewage goes into grit channel where heavier inorganic solid matters are removed because of low velocity is maintained\n\n70. Page 66 Environmental Engineering (ii) SUMP OR WET WELL: The sewage from the city is received at pumping station in a tank known as sump or wet well. The tank having capacity of 20-30cm per minutes average flow is designed in modern practice. The sump well is an underground, ring or circular shape placed at such a level that sewage from trunk sewer can flow into it by gravity only. The bottom of the tank is given a 1:1 slope towards a central pit where the end of section pipe of the pump is placed. The depth of the well depends upon the depth of incoming sewage of inlet. The main storage inside the well should be free fall inside the wet well to avoid the save harging and back flow. Guide pipes filled with flats, switches of motars, cables of electric motars, sewage level indicators etc should be placed in the wet well at suitable places. Gate valves should be fitted on the incoming sewer lines to stop the sewage flow during inspection , repairs and cleaning of the wet well etc. At the top of the wet well manhole with ladders are provided for cleaning, inspection and maintenance as shown in fig no. 4.13. The overflow weirs and by-pass arrangements are also provided in the wet wells for diverting the sewage during emergency floods.\n\n71. Sewer Appurtenances Page 67 Fig 4.13 Components of a Pumping Station (iii) PUMP ROOM: This is also called as dry-well and placed in a convenient location such that the pumps can easily function The pump-room is an underground masonary or rccroom with circular or rectangular shape and sewage pumps, their\n\n72. Page 68 Environmental Engineering driving units, control valves etc are installed in it. The size of the dry well should be sufficient for the movement of operator , maintenance repair and installation of pumps etc. In some cases a small pump is also provided to pump the leakages from the wet well in this well (iv) PIPES VALVES, FITTINGS etc: Cast Iron pipes with flanged joints should be in all installation works at pumping station so that the dismantling and repair of pumping station equipment. The size of pipe should be such that the sewage can flow at a velocity of 0.6 to 0.9m/sec so as to prevent the settlement of solids in the sewage. The length of the pipe is kept small so as to avoid anerobic deterioration and also head due to more number of valves, bends, junctions etc should be kept small as possible. Check valve should be provided in the sewerline to prevent the back flow of sewage during floods in the rivers or discharge area. Gate valve should be provided on the sewerline before wet well and on the section and discharge pipe to close the flow of sewage during maintenance, inspection and repair of the pump.\n\n73. Sewer Appurtenances Page 69 Pressure gauge is note the section pressure and discharge pressure should be installed at the appropriate position to record section and delivery pressure. Sewerage level indicator should also be filled in the wet well to record the level of the sewage. (iv) PUMPS WITH DRIVING ENGINE OR MOTOR: The following are the requirements of good sewage pump. 1. It can pump the sewage upto required elevation. 2. It can pump the required quantity of sewage even in emergency period. 3. It should be reliable. 4. It should be cheap in initial cost and maintenance. 5. It should not corroded by the organic and inorganic wastes of the sewage. 6. It should not be damaged or worn out by the presence of sand , gravel, stone etc in the sewage. 7. It should require less spacing for installation. 8. It should not made more noise during working. 9. It should not require high skills in its maintenance and operation. Generally centrifugal pumps are used for pumping of sewage provided with automatic or remote control devices and fulfill most of the requirements of the sewage pumps.\n\n74. Page 70 Environmental Engineering The pumps can be placed (i) Directly in the wet well in the submerged position (ii) In the dry well above the sewerage level in the wet well driving unit is gasoline or steam engine (iii) In the dry well below the sewage level in the wet well driving unit is electric motar The B.H.P of the driving unit is calculated by the formula, W.Q.H B.H.P. = ----------------------------- 75 x np x nm where Q = discharge H = Water head np = efficiency of pump nm = efficiency of driving engine of motar SAFETY MEASURES: The following safety measures shall be taken at the sewage pumping stations 1.

Page76 Environmental Engineering CHAPTER 5 SEWAGE CHARACTERISTICS GENERAL INTRODUCTION: Sewage is a dilute mixture of the various types of wastes from residential; public and industrial places. Sewage contains 99.9% of water and small portion of solids present in the sewage pose threat as they are offensive in nature, undergo changes by bio-degradation causes nuisance and pollution. So an understanding the nature of physical, chemical and biological characteristics of sewage is essential in planning, design and operation of treatment and disposal facilities and in the engineering management of environmental quality. 5.1 STRENGTH OF SEWAGE: The strength sewage is its potential to produce nuisance to the man and his environment. It is expressed in terms of B.O.D. The nuisance is caused by the oxidizable organic matter, which is unstable in nature, undergoes biodegradation produces very bad odour and causes insanitary and unhealthy environment. If the sewage contains more organic matter is more strong and if the sewage contains less organic matter is considered as less strong. 5.2 SAMPLING OF SEWAGE: The constituents of sewage continuously change with the time. So it is necessary that a sample collected for analysis should be fairly representative of the sewage. Hence, the samples of 100 to 150 C.C. are collected at various depths and at frequent\n\n81. Sewage Characteristics Page 77 intervals of time (half hourly or hourly collection) samples are taken beneath the surface where particles are mixed due to turbulence. Such sampling is called “grab sampling”. Different grab samples collected at frequent intervals in equal volume or proportionate to flow mixed are called “composite sample”, which gives the indication of true strength of sewage. All the samples collected are kept in cool place so that the bacteriological activities may not change the character of sewage before its examination. Samples should be tested immediately as the characteristics are liable for change with the time. For certain samples, preservatives like chloroform; formaldehyde, sulphuric acid etc are also added. But care should be taken in selection of preservatives so that the selected preservative does not change the characteristics of sample. Thoroughly cleaned and sterilized bottles of quartz are used for sample collection. The bottles should be completed filled without leaving any air in the bottle. The stopper should be firmly inserted and tied with a piece of cloth. Each sample should carry a tag or lable which consists of the following details (a) Source (b) Date (c) Time (d) Preservative added (e) Collectors Identity 5.3 CHARACTERISTICS OF SEWAGE: Following are the characteristics of sewage\n\n82. Page78 Environmental Engineering a. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS: 1) Colour: It indicates the condition of sewage as fresh, stale or septic. Yellow, grey or light brown colour indicates fresh sewage. Black or dark brown colour indicates stale sewage. Other colours in sewage are due to the presence of industrial wastes, dyes etc 2) Odour: It also indicates whether the sewage is fresh or stale. Fresh domestic sewage has slightly soapy or oily smell but the stale sewage has of offensive odour due to liberation of hydrogen sulphide and other sulphur compounds 3) Temperature: temperature of sewage is measured by means of ordinary thermometers, which should be able to read upto 0.1°c. If the temperature of sewage is more, biological activity is more 4) Turbidity : It is caused due to the presence of suspended matter and colloidal matter. Sewage is normally turbid resembling dirty dish water or waste water from baths having other floating matter, faecal matters etc. b. CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS: 1) Solids: The sewage contains both organic and inorganic solids in the form of settleable suspended solids, colloidal particles and dissolved solids. The settleable solids can be removed by sedimentation but removable of dissolved and colloidal solids required some biological treatment. It is estimated that 1000kg\n\n83. Sewage Characteristics Page 79 of sewage contains approximately 0.45kg of solids of which 0.225kg is indissolved form, 0.112 kg in suspension and 0.112kg in settleable form. Further it is noted that 100parts of solids contains approximately 45 parts of organic solids and 55 parts of inorganic solids. However for a given sample the parameters are to be determined by analysis only 2) Other chemical substances: The sewage contains chlorides, compounds of nitrogen, phosphorous, sulphur, alkaline substances, toxic compounds and heavy metals. The sewage may also contain proteins, carbohydrates, fats, oils, greases, phenols etc. 3) Gases: The sewage contains dissolved oxygen, hydrogen sulphide, carbondioxide, methane etc. c. BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS : The sewage may contains micro-organisms like viruses, bacteria, algae, fungi, protozoa, rotifers etc. These organisms may be aerobic, anaerobic or facultative in nature. “Aerobic bacteria” are those, which can live and grow in the presence of oxygen dissolved in water medium but anaerobic bacteria can survive and grow in absence of oxygen. “Facultative bacteria” are those, which survive and grow both in presence and absence of oxygen.\n\n84. Page80 Environmental Engineering 5.2 ANALYSIS OF SEWAGE: The analysis of sewage test samples is to determine the nature and concentration of physical, chemical and biological parameters. The information is required for planning, design , operation and maintenance of treatment of sewage of city/town SIGNIFICANCE OF TESTS: 5.2.1 TOTAL SOLIDS: The total solids are the quantity of suspended, dissolved and colloidal solids in the sewage and the nature may be organic or inorganic. The total solids are the important indicator of the strength of sewage. The quatitative determination of all these forms is very significant in the sewage treatment depends upon the nature, amount of settleable solids and determined by means of imhoffcone. Amount of dissolved solids influence the design of biological treatment units like trickling filters; activated sludge process. The quantity of biodegradable organic matter influences the design of sludge digestion units 5.2.2 C.O.D.: The amount oxygen consumed for chemical oxidation of organic matter with potassium permanganate or potassium dichromate in an acid solution is called chemical oxygen demand (C.O.D.). Using this test, the amount of carbon in organic matter is measured. It is useful in identifying the performance of various steps of treatment plants. It is also useful in determining the strength of industrial waters in sewage, which cannot be\n\n85. Sewage Characteristics Page 81 determined by B.O.D. test. The limitation of this test is its inability to differentiate between the biologically oxidizable and biologically inert material. C.O.D. test takes only 5 hours for determination where as B.O.D takes 5 days. C.O.D test is also easy and not affected by interference as in B.O.D test. 5.2.3 B.O.D: The amount of oxygen required for biochemical oxidation of the decomposable matter at specified temperature within the specified time under aerobic conditions is known as “Biological oxygen Demand”. B.O.D. indicates the strength of sewage and if B.O.D is more, the nuisance producing capacity of that sewage also increases The complete oxidation of organic matter takes about 2-3 months. The oxidation process proceeds in two stages. In the first stage carboneous matter is oxidized and in the second stage the nitrogen matter is oxidized. But it is found that nearly 70 to 80 percent of total B.O.D. is satisfied within 5 days at a temperature of 20°. Hence the B.O.D5, B.O.D. at 5 days period, incubated at 20°C is taken as standard value in actual practice. B.O.D. is the important parameter in sanitary engineering and influences the planning design and operation of biological units in treatment works\n\n86. Page82 Environmental Engineering Sometimes for more accurate results the sample of diluting water is also incubated in the same incubator along with the sewage for 5 days.The difference in dissolved oxygen content in the incubated sewage sample and plain water in the sewage is the B.O.D. of the sewage . This test is very delicate and much care is required while conducting the test B.O.D5 = Depletion of oxygen in ppm x diltion factor 5.2.4 PH: PH value is defined as the logarithem reciprocal of hydrogen iron concentration. The PH value of sewage is determined for regulating the various operations of treatment works. It also indicates the capacity to neutralize base or acid and the activity of hydrogen ions. In chemical and biological process of treatment, the PH value is so adjusted that each process is carried out efficiently. 5.2.5 CHLORIDES: Chlorides are stable and hence not a measure of degree of treatment. The normal chloride concentration in sewage is 120mg/lit. The excess of chlorides indicates the presence of industrial waste of infiltration of sea water. The sources of chlorides for domestic waste water are kitchens, urinals and water closets.\n\n87. Sewage Characteristics Page 83 5.3 CHARACTERISTICS OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE WATER: The characteristics of industrial waste cannot be so easily generalized as in the case of domestic wastewater. The characteristics of industrial waste vary with the type of industry and also plant to plant producing same type of end products. They depends upon the actual manufacturing process in the industry. The pollutants in the industrial sewage include the raw materials, end products, process intermediates process by products and process chemicals. However, the pollutants and characteristics are used as follows 1. The organic substances that deplete the dissolved oxygen (D.O) content of stream into the which the industrial wastes are disposed. These organic substances impose greater load on the biological units of treatment plants 2. The inorganic substances like carbonates, chlorides, nitrogen etc that make the receiving water body unfit for further use and also encourage the growth of micro-plants in the body of water 3. Acids and alkalis which endanger the growth of fish and other aquatic life and also cause difficulties in the operation of treatment plants 4. Toxic substances such as sulphides, cyanides, acetylene, alcohol, petrol etc which cause damage to the flora and fauna of receiving streams and also affect the treatment processes and some times endanger the safety of the workmen 5. Colour producing substances like dyes, which aesthetically objectionable when present in water supplies 6. Oils, fats and greases and other floating substances which will make the receiving streams unsightly and interfere with the self\n\n88. Page84 Environmental Engineering purification of the same. These substances also render the treatment operations difficult. PRINCIPLES OF TREATMENT: Depending upon the way in which the industrial wastes are discharged and the nature of the constituents, the treatment may consists of any one or more of the following processes 5.3.1 REDUCTION OF VOLUME AND STRENGTH: The following are the methods for the reduction of volume and strength are a. Segregation of uncontaminated wastes from contaminated wastes b. Conservation of water c. Implementing process changes to minimize wastes d. Reusing treated waste water for processes requiring lesser quality of water e. Reduction of strength of waste by process changes equipment modifications, segregation, equalization and by-product recovery 5.3.2 EQUALIZATION: When the characteristics of industrial waste water vary in a day and also when the discharge rate is not uniform or continuous, the waste may require equalization before treatment. The equalization consists of holding the waste for some designed\n\n89. Sewage Characteristics Page 85 period in a continuously mixed basin, which produces an effluent of fairly uniform characteristics. 5.3.3 NEUTRALIZATION When the industrial waste contains excessively acidic or alkaline substances the waste water requires neutralization. This becomes very essential particularly in the case of acidic wastes. In the neutralization process the waste is held in the tanks and its PH value is adjusted suitably by either adding alkaline or acidic substances as the case may be. 5.3.4 PROPORTIONING When the industrial waste is treated along with municipal sewage, the waste may be subjected to proportioning. Proportioning consists of control of the discharge of the industrial waste into the receiving stream or sewer in a fixed proportion to the flow of domestic waste water This helps not only in protecting the treatment device from shock load, but also improving the sanitary quality of the treated effluent. 5.3.5 PHYSICAL TREATMENT The physical treatment consists of unit methods like sedimentation by which settleable solids are sedimented and floatation in skimming tanks by which finer particles, oils etc are brought to the surface and then removed\n\n90. Page86 Environmental Engineering 5.3.6 CHEMICAL TREATMENT The following are the chemical and physico-chemical processes employed in the treatment of industrial waste are a. Chemical precipitation b. Chemical oxidation c. Reverse osmosis d. Electrodialysis e. Adsorption f. Ion Exchange g. Thermal reduction h. Air stripping BIOLOGICAL TREATMENT: In addition to the conventional biological processes like trickling filters, activated sludge process, sludge digestion tanks etc special processes involving acclimatized micro-organisms are also employed Biological processes like aerated lageons, Anaerobic lagoons, oxidation ditches etc are also used for treatment of industrial wastes.\n\n91. Sewage Characteristics Page 87 SYNOPSIS 1. If the sewage contains more organic matter, then the sewage is said to be strong (i.e.,) B.O.D. is high 2.

Page 90 Environmental Engineering CHAPTER 6 SEWERAGE TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL The sewage contains various types of impurities and disease bacteria is disposed of by dilution or on land after its collection and conveyance. If the sewage is directly disposed of, it will acted upon the natural forces, which will convert into harmless substances. The natural forces of purification cannot purify any amount of sewage within the specified time. If the quantity of sewage is more than receiving water will become polluted or the land become sewage sick under such circumstances it becomes essential to do some treatment of the sewage so that it can be accepted by the land or receiving water without any objection. The main object of the treatment limits is to reduce the sewage contents (solids) from the sewage and remove all the nuisance causing elements and change the character of the sewage in such a way that it can be safely discharged in the natural course applied on the land. Practically the treatment of sewage is required in big cities only where the volume of the sewage is more as well as the quantity of various types of solids, industrial sewage etc. The degree of treatment will be mostly be decided by the regulatory agencies and the extent to which the final products of treatment are to be utilized. The sewage treatment units can be broadly classified as a) Primary treatment b) Secondary treatment\n\n95.

If the sewage is to be disposed of finally in the river or natural streams the treatment plant should be located on the river bank and it should be down stream side of city and sufficiently away from the water intake works. The layout of the treatment plant is as shown in fig no. 6.1 and table 6.2 shows the various types of impurities and required treatment processes. Fig 6.1 Layout of Sewage Treatment Plant\n\n97. Sewerage Treatment & Disposal Page 93 Impurity Process used for removal 1. Bulky floating and suspended matters Racks and screens 2. Oils and greese Floating tanks (skimming tanks) 3. Heavy and coarse suspended matter Grit chamber, detritus tanks and sedimentation tanks 4. Non-settlable suspended and some dissolved solids Chemical flocculation 5. Colloids and dissolved organic matter Biological Growth 6. Pathogenic bacteria Disinfection Table 6.2 6.1 PRIMARY TREATMENT: In primary treatment, the larger solids from the sewage are removed during the treatment process. The more complex compounds are broken up and converted into simpler compounds by decomposition. The primary treatment includes screen, grit chambers, detritus tanks skimming tanks and sedimentation tanks with or without use of chemicals. PURPOSE: The main purpose of the installation of screens is to remove the floating matter of comparatively large size to prevent the possible damage of pumps and other equipments\n\n98. Page 94 Environmental Engineering LOCATION: The screens should preferably be located just before grit chambers at an angle of 30° to 60° with the direction of flow. The screens are some times accommodated in the body of grit chambers. The screening element may consists of parallel bars, rods, gratings or wire meshes or perforated plates and openings may be of any shape generally they are circular or rectangular. TYPES OF SCREENS: (i) Racks or bar-screens (ii) Perforated or fine screens (iii) Comminuters or cutting screens. The classification can also be done based on a. Opening size as course, medium or fine screen b. Shape as disc, band , drum, wings or cage c. Hand or mechanical cleaned screens Bar screens coarse or medium size in which bars are palced 5 cm or above and remove rags , sticks, dead animals etc from the sewage and prevent the sewage pumps against damage as shown in fig no.6.2\n\n99. Sewerage Treatment & Disposal Page 95 Fig 6.2 Bar Screens Fine screens have perforations of size about 1.5 mm to 6mm. They produces a noticeable effect on the strength of sewage and they considerably reduce the load on subsequent treatment units. Fine screens may be of drum or disc type and mechanically operated. These screens are less common now-a-days because of low efficiency , high maintenance cost and difficulty in the disposal of screening materials fig no.6.3 shows disc type fine screen Fig6.3 Fine Screen\n\n100. Page 96 Environmental Engineering Comminuters or cutting screens which are very popular in modern sewage works due to their high efficiency and less maintenance cost. Fig No. 6.4 shows communiter in which cutting screen drum continuously revolves and removes the fine suspended impurities from the sewage. The disposal screenings may be burial, incenevation or digestion. Fig 6.4 Communiter 2. SKIMMING TANKS: These tanks are used to remove oil, greese, soap; wood pieces; fruit skins etc. Fig No. 6.5 shows typical skimming tank.\n\n101. Sewerage Treatment & Disposal Page 97 Fig 6.5 Skimming Tank DESIGN ASPECTS: (i) AIR DIFFUSERS: Air diffusers are provided at the bottom of the tank for efficient working of skimming tank. The period of aeration and quantity of air will depends upon the quality of sewage. The compressed air sets up the currents and it results in the floating matter of sewage (ii) COLLECTION OF FLOATING SUBSTANCES: The floating substances collected at the top of tank are removed either with hand or with the help of mechanical equipment\n\n102. Page 98 Environmental Engineering (iii) DETENTION PERIOD: The detension period of about 3 to 5 minutes are designed (iv) OUTLET: The submerged outlet is provided to prevent the floating substances into the outlet channel (v) SHAPE: The shape skimming tank may be elliptical or circular and depth may be about one metre or so The disposal of the skimming obtained from skimming tanks can be done for the manufacture of the soap, lubricants, wax, pitch and other non-edible products. The skimmings are usually disposed of burning or burying in the ground 3. GRIT CHAMBERS: The purpose of providing grit chamber in the sewage treatment process is to remove grit, sand and other organic matter by reducing velocity of flow so that the heavier organic materials settle down at the bottom of grit chamber and the lighter organic materials are carried forward for further treatment. LOCATION: The grit chambers are placed after pumping stations and before screens or may be changed to suit the local requirements. NATURE OF GRIT: The grit has a specific gravity of about 2.0 to 2.5. The weight of dry gret is about 300kg/m3 and the weight of wet grit is\n\n103. Sewerage Treatment & Disposal Page 99 about 1600kg/m3 . The grit contains voids to the extent of 35 to 40 percent. SOURCES OF GRIT: The grit in the sewage is obtained from domestic sewage, floors of garages, obtained from domestic sewage. Floors of garages, service stations, fast storm of the season etc. VOLUME OF GRIT: The following factors which affect the volume or quantity of grit in the sewage 1. Area of unpaved surface in the locality. 2. Characteristics of ground. 3. Design of suit chambers. 4. Intensity of cleaning the streets. 5. Occurance of storms and their intensity. 6. Provision of catch basins. 7. Systems of sewage – combined or separate. NUMBER: The grit chambers are provided in duplicate. A stand by unit is essential for the smooth and efficient working of the grit chamber.\n\n104. Page 100 Environmental Engineering TYPES: The grit chambers may be horizontal flow or vertical flow type. The horizontal flow grit chamber is more popular as shown in fig no. 6.6. Fig 6.6 Grit Chamber CLEANING DEVICES: The grit deposited at the bottom of the tank is to be periodically cleaned by 1. Hand cleaning. 2. Hydraulic cleaning. 3. Mechanical cleaning.\n\n105. Sewerage Treatment & Disposal Page 101 DESIGN ASPECTS: 1. CLEANING INTERVAL: depending upon the local conditions cleaning interval varies from one to two weeks. 2. DEPTH: A minimum of 300mm should be provided and depth to length ratio should be about 1/16. 3. DETENSION PERIOD: The grit chambers are designed for a detension period of about 1 minute. 4. SPACE FOR ACCUMULATION OF GRIT: It is necessary to provide sufficient space at the bottom of grit chamber for accumulation of grit which may be 12 to 27 litres per one million litres of sewage. 5. VELOCITY OF FLOW: The velocity of flow in the grit chamber is kept 200 to 300 mm per sec. This is obtained by dividing the grit chamber into compartments. DISPOSAL OF GRIT: The disposal of grit is used to reclaim the low lying land. It can also mixed with poor soil to condition it and acts as good manure for garden crops. 6.2 PRIMARY TREATMENT – PLAIN SEDIMENTATION : OBJECTS: 1. The process of sedimentation reduces the strength of sewage to the extent of about 30 to 35%.\n\n106. Page 102 Environmental Engineering 2. The quantity of settleable solids in the sewage reduces to the extent of 80 to 90%. 3. There is a reduction in B.O.D to the extent of about 30 to 35%. 4. The sewage after being treated in the sedimentation becomes fit for further treatment processes. SEDIMENTATION PROCESS: When the velocity of flow is decreased or when sewage is allowed to stand at rest, the suspended particles carried by the sewage tend to settle at the bottom of tanks. The material collected at the bottom of sedimentation tanks is known as sludge and partially treated sewage is known as effluent, both require further additional treatment to make them an objectionable. TYPES OF TANKS: 1. According to the nature of working a. Fill and draw type. b. Continuous flow type. 2. According to the location a. Primary clarifies before grit chambers. b. Secondary clarifies after filters or activated sludge process.\n\n107. Sewerage Treatment & Disposal Page 103 a. PRIMARY CLARIFIES OR PRIMARY SEDIMENTARY TANKS: The overall features of primary clarifies are more or less the same as those tanks which are provided in the water supply schemes. The following are the design aspects of the primary clarifies. 1. INLET AND OUTLET ARRANGEMENTS: The following points should be noted in the design of inlet and outlet arrangements. (i) The rate of inflow and outflow are equal. (ii) The sewage should diffused equally across the entire section of tank. (iii) The outflow should be as thin as possible. (iv) The distance between inlet and outlet channel should remain constant. 2. SHAPE OF TANK: (i) Rectangular tanks: The ratios of length to width is about 4 to 5 and the ratio of width to depth is about 2 to 3. A rectangular tank with horizontal flow is a s shown in fig no. 6.7.\n\n108. Page 104 Environmental Engineering Fig 6.7 Rectangular Settling Tank (ii) Circular tank: The circular tanks are with vertical flow and it is possible to install conveniently the mechanical scrapers to collect the sludge at bottom of tank as in the case of dorr clarifier. (iii) Hopper bottom tank: These tanks may be with horizontal or vertical flow. Hopper bottom tank with vertical flow is as shown in fig no. 6.8. Fig No. 6.8\n\n109. Sewerage Treatment & Disposal Page 105 (3) CAPACITY OF TANK: The capacity of tank is determined by considering the detension period and overflow rate. For primary clarifiers are generally designed for a detension period of 1 to 3 hours (average 2 hours) The overflow rate is generally taken as 1000 to 2000 lit per hour per m2 . (4) SCUM BUFFLES: The scum baffles in the form of troughs or boards are to be provided to prevent the entry of floating substances into the outlet channel. (5) SCUM REMOVAL DEVICES: The primary clarifiers should be provided suitable scum removal devices. The floating thus caught are sent for further treatment or for final disposal. (6) SLUDGE REMOVAL: The sludge collected at the bottom of settling tanks should be periodically removed by the following methods. (i) Hand cleaning – suitable for rectangular tank with flat bottom. (ii) Hydraulic Cleaning – This method is suitable for hopper bottom settling tank with vertical flow. In this tank the sludge is conveyed to a manhole through sludge removal pipe under hydraulic pressure.\n\n110. Page 106 Environmental Engineering (iii) Mechanical cleaning – This method is suitable for rectangular and circular tanks. ADVANTAGES: 1. The sludge is removed continuously there is no chance to become septic. 2. The sludge obtained by this method is dense. DISADVANTAGES: 1. Power required to run the mechanical equipment. 2. The steelwork is increased. 3. The efficiency of tank may be reduced due to disturbing effects of the mechanical equipment. (2) MISLANEOUS CONSIDERATIONS: The velocity of flow should be about 300 mm per minute. The clarifies should be provided with suitable facilities such as handrails, ladders, passages etc for easy access and maintenance of the tanks. 6.3 SECONDARY TREATMENT The effluent that is coming out from primary clarifies contains 45 to 50 percent of the unstable or organic matter originally present in the sewage as solution or suspension or colloidal matter. The sewage to this extent is prepared to receive the secondary treatment."
