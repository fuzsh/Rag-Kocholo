        "text": "Our experts: Professor David Airey, Professor Abbas El-Zein, Professor Gwénaëlle Proust, Associate Professor Daniel Dias-Da-Costa, Associate Professor Yixiang Gan, Dr Bowei Yu\n\nOur partners: Dr Golnaz Alipour Esgandani (Macquarie University, Australia)\n\nPhD students: Yifei Gao, Shunzhi Shen, Sepideh Taheri\n\nClay in several geoenvironmental and geotechnical engineering applications undergoes cycles of wetting and drying. This can lead to desiccation cracking, loss of key properties and an increased risk of failure in slopes, pavements, foundations and waste-barrier lining systems.\n\nDesiccation cracking has been studied extensively over the last few decades. Far less understood is the capacity of clay to autogenously close its cracks and recover some mechanical, hydrological and thermal properties upon rehydration.\n\nWe're conducting theoretical, experimental and computational investigations to develop a better understanding of processes and the capacity to predict them.\n\nOur expert: Professor Abbas El-Zein\n\nOur partners: Professor Abdelmalek Bouazza (Monash University, Australia), Professor R Kerry Rowe (Queen’s University, Canada), Associate Professor Will Gates (Deakin University, Australia)\n\nPhD student: Linxue Zhao\n\nPer and poly-fluoro alkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent organic contaminants that, until recently, have been found in a range of products, including packaging material, fire-fighting foams and cosmetics.\n\nHuman exposure to PFAS has been linked to a host of health conditions, including liver and testicular cancer, increased blood pressure in pregnant women and high blood cholesterol. Protection of groundwater from PFAS present in polluted sites and municipal waste landfills around the world is hence an important endeavour for scientists, engineers and regulators.\n\nManagement of surface sources of PFAS is made difficult by significant uncertainties and knowledge gaps about their interactions with the soil material that separate them from an aquifer in both engineered barrier systems and non-engineered disposal environments.\n\nThe investigation, part of a wider ARC linkage project, builds and validates new probabilistic models to predict PFAS transport in soil and groundwater. Our goal is to develop empirically based and scientifically sound guidelines for the management of PFAS in surface sources.\n\nOur experts: Professor Abbas El-Zein, Professor Peter Lay, Dr Elizabeth Carter\n\nOur partners: Professor Abdelmalek Bouazza (Monash University, Australia), Professor R Kerry Rowe (Queen’s University, Canada), Associate Professor Will Gates (Deakin University, Australia)\n\nPhD student: Yifei Gao\n\nMicroplastics (MP) and nanoplastics (NP) have been detected in a wide range of physical and biological systems and associated with a host of health conditions. Prevention of their proliferation is hence one of the most urgent environmental challenges of the 21st century.\n\nBentonite clay is found widely in waste-containment barrier systems around the world as a key insulation material to prevent organic and inorganic contamination of groundwater. On the other hand, little is known about the effects of MP and NP on the insulation properties of bentonite clay.\n\nWe're conducting a set of experimental investigations to better understand the effect of exposure of bentonite to MP and NP on its microstructural and macroscopic properties.\n\nOur experts: Professor Abbas El-Zein, Associate Professor Thomas Hubble, Dr Guien Miao,\n\nPhD student: Joey Zhu\n\nLandslides cause significant human suffering and economic damage around the world. Slope stability is affected by natural topological factors, wet-dry cycles, soil properties as well as human interventions.\n\nConventional geotechnical approaches to soil reinforcement vary in their effectiveness and are often costly to implement. On the other hand, the roots of plants and trees are known to provide additional cohesion to soils. However, knowledge gaps persist in our understanding of the reinforcement mechanisms triggered by roots in soils and prevent a wider adoption of this approach.\n\nOur project investigates the use of native plants in Australia to provide soil reinforcement, aiming to develop design guidelines for their use in geotechnical engineering.\n\nOur expert: Professor Abbas El-Zein\n\nPhD students: Steven Ding, Hamed Faizi, Matthew Hanna (undergraduate thesis student)\n\nThe ability to predict chemical, thermal and hydro-mechanical behaviour of soils under various environmental conditions is critical for achieving desirable environmental and engineering objectives.\n\nThis project applies state-of-art artificial intelligence, including neural networks and other nature-based algorithms, to develop new tools for predicting soil behaviour and properties.\n\nOf particular interest is the behaviour of clayey materials, including geosynthetics clay liners (GCLs) widely used in geoenvironmental engineering applications around the world. Our goal is to develop accurate and cost-effective prediction tools for use by engineers, alongside experimental measurements."
