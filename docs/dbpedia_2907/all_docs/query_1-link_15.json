        "text": "Abstract\n\nThis article paper is a design note matter for the Dry Well Ventilation requirement that has been calculated procedurally for you to understand and as your guidelines as well on whatever similar design project you are facing. The provided composition is a matter of following the environmental issue to maintain the required Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) for the facility. Environmental Possibilism Theory implies in the modern world using technological advancement for environmental engineering application. Moreover, the design calculation has been provided in conjunction with the Codes and Standards of Practice to follow for a sustainable environment.\n\nDry Well Design Parameter\n\nThe Main Pumping Station Dry Well requires to be designed at 20 ACH based on the QCS 2014 Section 22.2.1 whereas shown in below image (Figure 01) parameters.\n\nHowever, in the application of 20 ACH (Figure 01) and concerning the QCS 2014 Section 22.2.2 Wet Well Ventilation / Process Area Ventilation Item 10 as shown in below image (Figure 02) where the calculated airflow can provide 60% of the overall design ventilation requirement within the dry well areas. To simplify them, the required 20 ACH will be multiplied by 60% which is equal to 12 ACH figure.\n\nTherefore, the Dry Well has to design based on the calculated figure with 12 ACH which had been simplified and discussed in the workshop meeting and agreed internally. The 12 ACH will be used as the parameter for the dry well to figure them out with the required design ventilation airflow and thus, maintaining the required indoor air quality within the building environment.\n\nCalculation Argument\n\nIn this design note, the work of an Environmental Engineer will explicitly discuss the required Indoor Air Quality requirement for the Dry Well Ventilation of the Main Pumping Station Project. Specifically intent as the subject concerned for the necessary indoor air quality within the sewerage pumping station by providing a detailed calculation based on the interpretation of the code regarding the QCS 2014 (Qatar Construction Specification) as shown in Figure 01 and Figure 02 to justify the intent. Figure 03 described the Main Pumping Station of Ground Floor Plan where the area of drywall containment, which is highlighted in yellow color with 9.50 meters depth.\n\nWith the highlighted area in yellow as coded whereas shown in Figure 03 above of the Main Pumping Station Ground Floor Plan and with the Figure 03A of the Dry Well Section Layout is typically measured based on the required areas and volumes. The two-figures has been used as references for calculation concerning ASHRAE parameters which comes up with the calculation methodology as provided of the following;\n\nExtract Calculation Requirement\n\na) Typical Containment Compartment (“A and B”)\n\nThe length is 2-meters, the width is 5.1-meters, and the height is 9.5-meters\n\nBy cube formula with, L x W x H, then transposition;\n\n(2-meters) x (5.1-meters) x (9.5-meters) = 96.9-cubic meters\n\nBy airflow formula with 12 ACH (Air Change per Hour) requirement, then;\n\n(96.9 m3 x 12) / 3.6 = 323 liters per second\n\nb) Containment of A and Containment B\n\nSince the area is served into two divisions as shown containment of A and containment B of Figure 03, then the total airflow for the two containment compartments is equal to;\n\n323 lps x 2 = 646 liters per second\n\nc) Containment Compartment “C”\n\nThe length is 4-meters, the width is 11.8-meters, and the height is 9.5-meters\n\nBy cube formula with, L x W x H, then transposition;\n\n(4-meters) x (11.8-meters) x (9.5-meters) = 484.40-cubic meters\n\nBy airflow formula with 12 ACH (Air Change per Hour) requirement, then;\n\n(484.40 m3 x 12) / 3.6 = 1495 liters per second\n\nd) Summation of Containment Compartment “A, B and C”\n\nAdding the total airflow for the item b) and item c) then the airflow for the extract fan (EF/03) is;\n\n646 lps + 1495 lps = 2141 liters per seconds\n\nEquipment Selection Process\n\nIn the equipment selection process will be based on the QCS 2014 Section 22.2.2 Wet Well Ventilation / Process Area Ventilation Item 10 requirement. Since the calculated flow of 2141 liters per seconds which is the overall ventilation design airflow required for Figure 03, then have to provide with two identical system with the needed airflow for each duty fan that is capable of delivering 60% of the overall design requirement as;\n\n2141 lps x 60% = 1284.60 or say, 1285 lps for each Duty Fan\n\nTherefore, the designed Duty Fan, (EF/03), which is required for Figure 03 will be Two-Duty Fans (identical system) with a capacity of 1285 lps each in compliance to QCS 2014 Section 22.2.2.10. When both of the designed duty fans are operating serving the dry well will have a total of 2570 liters per seconds, which is more than the requirement. The one duty fan will have 1285 liters per seconds, which is 60% of the demand.\n\nProvision of Standby Fans for the Dry Well Requirement\n\nThe provision of Standby Fans concerning the QCS 2014 Section 22.2.3.2 Dry Well Ventilation with the provided cut sheet (Figure 04) is mandatory in the engineering practice, however, defines the function in two considerations which are the degree of fire risk, and the reliability of the fan equipment. Therefore, with the designed Duty Fans as required in the system as shown in Figure 03 layout will need additional Two-Standby Fans with a total of 4-Nos Fans (Duty and Standby).\n\nMoreover, the degree of prevention will secure the operation in the dry well continuously without interruption. Additionally, the Duty and Standby can be designed having with the application of Auto Transfer Switch (ATS) so that the Duty and Standby will work within the design of hourly intervals and thus, maintaining the reliability of the fans without interruption and maintain the required Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) in the environment.\n\nAnalysis and Conclusion\n\nThe given calculation above is 100% complied with the given code, QCS 2014, as the specified cut sheet is shown in Figure 01 and Figure 02 using the 20 ACH requirement and the 60% capable of providing the overall ventilation design requirement required for the Figure 03 of the calculated airflow.\n\nThe Fresh Air Intake will be designed too similar to the required extract airflow as calculated above. However, there’s no need to have additional supply fan but to have a passive airflow with the provision of duct opening as shown layout in Figure 03 so that there will be an airflow balance positively within the containment compartment for the required Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) in the environment.\n\nMoreover, the design duct velocity shall refer to the ASHRAE, SMACNA Duct Design or to the DW 144 for the requirement to complete the design. However, the intent in this article is to discuss and to give you a particular design note for the Dry Well Ventilation Requirement, and the process, as well as the necessary Controls, will be on the next article topic.\n\nFigure 05 shows the entire facility where the Main Pumping Station is located and as discussed for the Dry Well Ventilation requirement. A project model where helps the environment in delivering the sewerage safely from the urban city to the treated sewage effluent plant which will return it to the downtown city for irrigation purposes and grey water applications for the commercial buildings.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________"
