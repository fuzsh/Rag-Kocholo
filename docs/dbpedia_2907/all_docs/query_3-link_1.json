        "text": "What are catch basins made of?\n\nOur basins are made of a PPE plastic material, and the internal basket may be a PPE plastic or galvanized metal material dependent on the basin size.\n\nWhat load class do I need for my project?\n\nVodaland provides catch basins for any required load class. To match the right load class to your project requirements, follow this link to learn the classifications:\n\nhttps://vodaland.ca/pages/load-classes\n\nHow does the stackable basin system work?\n\nFor those that need a deeper basin than the ones we offer, they can consider a stacked basin for their project. Stacked basins are very simple: basins are stacked vertically. The top basins can then have their floors removed to allow water access to the bottom basins. The only other step is to silicone seal between the two basins for a leak-proof connection.\n\nHow do I maintain and clean my basin?\n\nRegular maintenance required for our catch basins is periodically removing the debris collected in the basket and removing sediment build-up on the bottom with a scoop or vacuum. Customers will know best how often they need to complete this process based on their risk of debris and the quantity of liquid collected.\n\nWhere are catch basins used?\n\nCatch basins are typically used in urban and suburban areas to collect and manage stormwater runoff that could potentially contaminate nearby bodies of water. They are commonly found along streets, parking lots, sidewalks, industrial facilities, parking garages, highways, and airports. Certain types are designed to have great depth to handle large volumes of water during heavy rainstorms.\n\nWhy Vodaland's catch basins?\n\nHigh-Quality and Easy-to-Maintain\n\nWhen we designed our catch basins together with high-quality materials, we wanted to provide our customers with a customizable drainage solution and an easy-to-maintain design. Unlike other brands, our catch basins do not require additional adapters to connect with a pipe because all common pipe connection sizes are already pre-installed at the installation site on all four sides. You just need to open up the desired connection size and connect your pipe.\n\nAnti-Clog Protection\n\nSay “no” to clogging! Our catch basin drains also come with a debris basket that protects your pipe from getting clogged with debris. Simply open the grate and remove debris from the basket. This will save you time and money on cleaning and maintenance of your drainage system in the long run.\n\nProduct Variety\n\nWe have an easily accessible online store that sells products typically not sold online.\n\nWe also supply product lines that are engineered for larger-scale projects and have a dedicated engineer who works to ensure that products have the right specifications.\n\nRange of Services\n\nWe cater to both residential and commercial clients in Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia.\n\nDirect Line of Communication\n\nWe deal with customers directly so you can receive immediate help from us should problems arise. This also means that we can get your products to you much more quickly.\n\nShop our selection of plastic catch basins now."
