        "text": "WE ARE EXPERTS AT CLEANING UP PROPERTIES CONTAMINATED BY DRY CLEANING SOLVENTS AND HAVE OBTAINED REGULATORY CLOSURE ON MORE DRY CLEANING SITES THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY IN THE COUNTRY.\n\nWhether you’re actively running your dry cleaning business, looking to sell, refinancing, or passing on your business to the next generation, the evolution of environmental laws and regulations has resulted in dry cleaning operators and owners being held responsible for identified releases of solvent no matter how long ago it happened. There is good cause for hope because the tools exist that can help ambitious dry cleaners put these concerns behind them.\n\nWe fix environmental issues by performing subsurface site investigation, cleaning up contamination, mitigating vapor intrusion, and providing expert technical support to legal counsel.\n\nBy conducting insurance archeology, we find your or your predecessor’s historical Commercial General Liability (CGL) policies, which are valuable assets that can be used to pay for resolving environmental issues. We’re the nation’s leader at applying historical insurance coverage to fund the costs of environmental investigation, cleanup, and legal defense against third-party liabilities.\n\nWe’ve partnered with dry cleaner for over 25 years to ensure our specialized services protect the long-term interests and personal needs of dry cleaners."
