There is planned to develop 3 piloting stations in WaterLAB and prepare laboratory tests in the field of microbiological indicators, physico-chemical characteristic extended by micropollutants and toxicity tests. Savonia together with the second leader Municipal Water and Sewerage Company in Warsaw from Poland oversees the development of pilots for other partners as well.\n\n“Improving agricultural water management for climate change adaptation”\n\n01/2023-12/2024\n\nShort description of the project: The climate system controls what we can grow and where we can grow it—and whether agriculture\n\nis possible. The negative impacts of climate change are already being felt in the industry in the form\n\nof increasing temperatures, weather variability, more frequent extreme weather events intensifying\n\nwater scarcity and risks related to food security.\n\nThe profiling area of SMAGRI is “Climate-smart agriculture” (CSA), an integrated approach to\n\nmanaging landscapes addressing the interlinked challenges of food security and climate change.\n\nSMAGRI unites 3 knowledge domains of our university (Savonia UAS) agri-food, water, and digital technology under this theme.\n\nGoals and what kind of problems the project seeks to solve: As a result of climate change, rainfall is distributed more unevenly: the soil dries out in the spring and early growing season, while the amount of precipitation increases in autumn and winter. During the growing season, the rains will also be even heavier. In plant farming, however, the moisture conditions should be optimal throughout the growing season. Instead of efficient drainage, we need more comprehensive water management.\n\nConcrete measures of the project: We develop automation that utilizes measurement and forecast data. The work is done with a local agricultural entrepreneur on a 14 ha pilot field. The goal is an automation technology, which would allow meltwater and rainwater to be retained on the field while ensuring adequate drainage.\n\nIn addition to equalizing the moisture conditions, the valuable nutrients and solid matter must remain in the field and the growth condition should be good, so in addition to the data needed for regulation, we measure the water quality and flows as well as the growth condition of the soil in the pilot field.\n\nThe target group: Farmers and companies in the technology sector\n\nFunding by Finland’s Ministry of Education and Culture.\n\nSMAGRI -hanke – Laari\n\n03/2023-11/2025\n\nRequirements for environmental management in mining have increased together with increasing demand of mined commodities. The mining industry has operated for a long time according to the principle where only a small fraction of the large amount of quarried and processed rock material ends up as commodity. Even today, up to 96% of the processed ore ends up in large impoundments as extractive waste i.e. mine tailings. This mode of operation is inefficient in terms of energy and material efficiency, environmental protection, and the economy.The SETELIT project investigates utilization of mine tailings as a cement-free paste backfill material cured with a carbon neutral method in the mining area, and outside the mine sites as a material substituting concrete. The project promotes the circular and energy economies and reduces the environmental risks and landscape impacts created by mining operations. Developed new products and methods can boost the business activities and competitiveness of companies. In addition to these, the project also promotes digitalization.The objectives of the project are (i) To develop a low-carbon, mine tailings based product similar to concrete, and to create guidelines for cancelling the end-of-waste status and for productizing mine tailings-based products; (ii) To promote research services related to cement-free paste backfill materials cured with carbon-neutral methods and to enhance infrastructure needed to carry out high quality Flow Loop tests; (iii) To develop a digital recipe tool for cement-free mine tailings-based products and paste backfill materials.Utilization of tailings outside mine sites requires a) carrying out the cancellation of the mine tailings waste status and b) a productization process. The guide and demonstration of these tasks will be implemented in the SETELIT project. In addition, since cement production is known to cause 5–8 % of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions, it is recommended to implement the curing or binding of tailings, whenever possible, without cement. Binders suitable to replace cement are various slags, ashes, bioplastic and strong alkali solutions used in alkali-activation and geopolymerization techniques. These methods will be tested during the product design phase with the selected tailings.When utilizing mine tailings as a cured paste backfill material in underground mines, it is essential to ensure the technical and environmental characteristics of the mixture (paste) as well as smooth transportation through the pipeline to the filling site. The Flow Loop testing method created in the ERDF Kove-Pro project is digitalized and optimized in the SETELIT project. The rheological properties of pastes are measured by Flow Loop tests already at the first stage of recipe design. Using the Flow Loop method, new types of cement-free cured paste backfill recipes are developed to reduce the mine’s carbon footprint and the amount of extractive wastes.All recipes generated during the project, as well as characterization results of starting materials and test pieces, will be compiled in a digital recipe library. This library helps to preserve and interpret results in a new way using the self-organizing map method (SOM). The goal is to\n\ndevelop a system to search for recipes that support carbon neutrality and circular economy for paste backfill solutions and other mine tailings-based applications. The SETELIT project is based on cooperation between Savonia University of Applied Sciences and Geological Survey of Finland (GTK). Savonia’s expertise in concrete engineering, 3D printing, and water engineering is combined with GTK’s expertise in geochemistry, mineralogy, X-ray tomography, 3D printing of geomaterials, the circular economy and environmental impact management of the mining industry.\n\nCo-funded by EU and reginal councils of Finland.\n\nThe technologies and services developed in the project will be tested and demonstrated at Savonia’s water laboratory in Kuopio on the one hand, and also at suitable field sites at Finnish water utilities. The international demonstration will be carried out towards the end of the project at a foreign water utility site in Poland.\n\nThe aim is to form a new service concept that can be cost-effectively integrated into the operation and condition monitoring systems of existing water utilities both in Finland and in international water utility sites without significant investment costs.\n\nThe result of the project will be:\n\n– An integrated co-offering that utilizes, for example, Nokia’s Impact Platform and MXIE platform as a generic platform.\n\n– New high-tech services for water utilities demonstrated in practice.\n\n-One international demo at a foreign water utility site (Poland).\n\n– Mapping potential international market areas.\n\n– New growing high-tech international business for the water supply sector with the help of a consortium of small companies and a global leading company.\n\n08/2023-12/2024\n\nFunding by The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry."
