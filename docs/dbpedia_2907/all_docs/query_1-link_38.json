They have established a reputation for providing top-of-the-line drainage solutions and have recently expanded their service offerings to include dry well systems as well. This is great news for homeowners who are in need of reliable and effective drainage solutions.\n\nIt is important to note that many townships have implemented regulations pertaining to the installation of new driveways and swimming pools. These regulations often mandate the installation of dry well systems as a means to manage rainwater runoff. Therefore, it is imperative to seek the help of experts like Dry Wells of Long Island who can provide guidance and assistance in navigating these regulations.\n\nDon’t hesitate to reach out to Dry Wells of Long Island at 516-315-8591 if you require any assistance with drainage solutions or dry well systems. Their team of professionals will be more than happy to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have.\n\nRecently the Riverhead Town board considered making it mandatory that Twenty percent of the pool’s volume would determine the size of the Dry well. This is not very practical. A swimming pool that holds 30,000 gallons of water would require six cesspool rings. The rings each have a capacity of 1,000 gallons. A 20 by 36 standard rectangular in-ground pool holds about 30,000 gallons of water, according to a water volume calculator on the swimmingpool.com website. http://www.swimmingpool.com/maintenance/testing-your-water/pool-volume-calculator.\n\nFortunately, this was considered not reasonable and was not passed.\n\nNo permission shall be granted for the installation of any swimming pool, unless the plans therefor meet the minimum Town of Hempstead Building Department construction requirements or until the owner of the premises has filed with the Building Department a certification, approved by the Town Engineer, by a professional engineer licensed by the State of New York, that the drainage of such pool is adequate and will not interfere with the public water supply system, with existing sanitary facilities or with the public highways.\n\nAll swimming pools shall have proper drainage sufficient in size, capacity and scope to be able to drain the swimming pool onsite within a proper time frame, in accordance with generally acceptable standards, as determined by the Superintendent of the Building Department and the Superintendent of Public Works. No person shall cause or permit a swimming pool to be drained onto public property or onto private property owned by any person other than the owner of the property on which the swimming pool is located."
