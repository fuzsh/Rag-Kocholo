Introduction to Architecture. 2 Units.\n\nThis class introduces students to the discipline of architecture and to the fundamental question: What is an architect and how is architecture distinct from other arts and sciences? To answer this question, the class will focus on concepts important to the practice of architecture including: project conception, drawing, modeling, materials, structure, form, and professionalism. These terms will be investigated through short talks, site visits, historical precedent, in-class exercises, panel discussions and two on-campus case studies. No prior knowledge of architecture is required.\n\nCEE 10B. Presentation Skills. 0 Units.\n\nTBD.\n\nCEE 31. Accessing Architecture Through Drawing. 5 Units.\n\nPreference to Architectural Design and CEE majors; others by consent of instructor. Drawing architecture to probe the intricacies and subtleties that characterize contemporary buildings.

Students construct conventional architectural drawings, such as plans, elevations, and perspectives. Limited enrollment.\n\nCEE 31Q. Accessing Architecture Through Drawing. 5 Units.\n\nPreference to sophomores. Drawing architecture provides a deeper understanding of the intricacies and subtleties that characterize contemporary buildings. How to dissect buildings and appreciate the formal elements of a building, including scale, shape, proportion, colors and materials, and the problem solving reflected in the design. Students construct conventional architectural drawings, such as plans, elevations, and perspectives. Limited enrollment.\n\nCEE 32A. Psychology of Architecture. 3 Units.\n\nThis course argues that architecture often neglects the interdisciplinary investigation of our internal psychological experience and the way it impacts our creation of space. How does our inner life influence external design? How are we impacted emotionally, physically, psychologically by the spaces we inhabit day to day? How might we intentionally imbue personal and public spaces with specific emotions? This seminar serves as a call to action for students interested in approaching architecture with a holistic understanding of the emotional impact of space. Sample topics addressed will include: conscious vs. unconscious design; the ego of architecture; psycho-spatial perspectives; ideas of home; integral/holistic architecture; phenomenology of inner and outer spaces; exploring archetypal architecture; and translating emotion through environment.\n\nCEE 32B. Design Theory. 4 Units.\n\nThis seminar focuses on the key themes, histories, and methods of architectural theory -- a form of architectural practice that establishes the aims and philosophies of architecture. Architectural theory is primarily written, but it also incorporates drawing, photography, film, and other media. nnOne of the distinctive features of modern and contemporary architecture is its pronounced use of theory to articulate its aims. One might argue that modern architecture is modern because of its incorporation of theory. This course focuses on those early-modern, modern, and late-modern writings that have been and remain entangled with contemporary architectural thought and design practice. nnRather than examine the development of modern architectural theory chronologically, it is explored architectural through thematic topics. These themes enable the student to understand how certain architectural theoretical concepts endure, are transformed, and can be furthered through his/her own explorations.nCEE 32B is a crosslisting of ARTHIST 217B/417B.\n\nCEE 32D. Construction: The Writing of Architecture. 4 Units.\n\nThis seminar focuses on the construction of architectural writing. The class will analyze this idea through four topics: formal analysis, manifesto, translation, and preservation. The seminar is divided into two-week modules with each of these four concepts functioning as organizing principles. nnThe first week of each module will involve familiarizing the seminar with both the terms and rhetorical tactics of the given theme by reading and analyzing specific texts and completing a short written analysis (1-2 pages). The second week will expand upon this foundation and involve further analysis in addition to each student writing a short paper (3-4 pages) drawing on the examples discussed and their own experiences in the discipline. The goal of the seminar is for each student to be able to analyze how an architectural writing is constructed and to develop his/her skills in the construction of his/her own writing.\n\nCEE 32F. Light, Color, and Space. 3 Units.\n\nThis course explores color and light as a medium for spatial perception. Through the introduction of color theory, color mixing, and light analyses, students will learn to see and use light and color fields as a way to shape experience. We will examine the work of a range of architects and artist who use light and color to expand the field of perception (i.e. Rothko, Turrell, Eliasson, Holl, Aalto).\n\nCEE 32G. Architecture Since 1900. 4 Units.\n\nArt 142 is an introduction to the history of architecture since 1900 and how it has shaped and been shaped by its cultural contexts. The class also investigates the essential relationship between built form and theory during this period.\n\nSame as: ARTHIST 142\n\nCEE 32H. Responsive Structures. 3 Units.\n\nThis Design Build seminar investigates the use of metal as a structural, spatial and organizational medium. We will examine the physical properties of post-formable plywood, and develop a structural system and design which respond to site and programmatic conditions.

This course may be repeated for credit (up to three times). Class meeting days/times are as follows:n1st session : April 4, 10am - 6pmn2nd session : April 25th, 10am - 6pm n3rd session: May 5 , 6pm-9pm (Jun will not attend) nFinal Build dates: nMay 16 10am-eveningnMay 17th. 10am- 6:30 pm.\n\nSame as: CEE 132H\n\nCEE 32Q. Place: Making Space Now. 3 Units.\n\nThis seminar argues that architeccts are ultimately \"placemakers,\" and questions what that means in the contemporary world. Part I investigates the meaning of the word \"place.\" Additional background for understanding contemporary place making will include a critique of the history of modern place-making through an examination of modern form. Part II examines two traditional notions of place by scale: from \"home\" to \"the city.\" What elements give these conceptions of space a sense of place? To answer this question, themes such as memory, mapping, and boundary, among others, will be investigated. part III presents challenges to the traditional notions of place discussed in Part II. Topics addressed include: What does it mean to be \"out of place\"? What sense of place does a nomad have, and how is this represented? What are the \"non-places\" and how can architects design for these spaces? Part IV addresses the need to re-conceptualize contemporary space. The role of digital and cyber technologies, the construction of locality in a global world, and the in-between places that result from a world in flux are topics discussed in this section of the seminar. nLearning goals: Specific goals include clsoe reading of texts, understanding of philosophical thinking and writing, argument under uncertainty, and developed concepts of place, space and architecture.\n\nCEE 32R.

The Situated Workplace and Public Life. 4 Units.\n\nThe modern workplace has undergone fundamental change and continues to evolve. The context of work in many industries is today being shaped substantially by changing workforce demographics, the pervasiveness of mobile and embedded information technologies, hyper-connected work models on a global scale, evolving notions of health and well being, etc. nnOur public realm is changing too. People are moving to cities in greater numbers than ever before posing both challenges and opportunities related to new levels of density, sustainable resource management, resilient infrastructures, as well as new forms of civic engagement at neighborhood levels, to name but a few. These changes at an urban scale impact how and where public life happens and how it interacts with new modalities at work.nnThis course will combine research, conceptual explorations, studio design work, seminars and guest lectures to explore the impact of the changing workplace on the morphology of the city by examining these bi-coastal seats of innovation. As the creative workplace continues to evolve, how will it engage the public realm within both well-established urban frameworks such as San Francisco and Boston, and emerging suburban contexts, such as Silicon Valley?nnThe course will join graduate students from the Northeastern University School of Architecture with students from the Stanford University Architectural Design program. Students will reside primarily at their prospective universities and will travel selectively for site research, team charettes and project reviews. Project sites on both coasts will be utilized for research and studio work. This is an opportunity for students from two top universities, both situated in the epicenters of workplace change, to explore and conduct valuable research on an issue that is changing their urban environments.\n\nCEE 32T. Making and Remaking the Architect: Edward Durell Stone and Stanford. 4 Units.\n\nHow does an architect establish a career? How is an architect remembered? What makes a building significant and how should it be preserved, if at all? Fundamental questions about the practice and production of architecture will be examined in this seminar that focuses on the work of Edward Durell Stone (1902-78) and specifically on his work at Stanford and in Palo Alto. By 1955, Stone was so well established that he founded an office in Palo Alto to design the Stanford Medical Center (currently slated for destruction) and several other significant local public buildings, such as the Palo Alto Civic Center. Through site visits to his buildings, research in the Stanford archives, and interviews with architects who worked in his office (among other strategies), students will question how architecture produced in the immediate post-WWII period is thought about historically and how and when it should be preserved.\n\nCEE 32U. California Modernism: The Web of Apprenticeship. 4 Units.\n\nThis course will study at the development of Modernism in pre and post WWII California. The class will investigate responses to climatic, technological, and cultural changes that were specific to the state but have now become an idealized tread. We will look at architects and landscape architects who apprenticed with significant design leaders and track how their involvement and explore resulted in changes in building technologies, and influenced the next generation of design thinking and experimentation. The investigations will occur through research, drawings and models, as well as site visits.\n\nCEE 32V.

Team Urban Design Studio. 5 Units.\n\nThis new class offers an exciting variation on the 'individual project' studio format. Students work as a team to propose a single consensus solution to a real-world design challenge. This collaborative studio experience more closely reflects the creative process in the design and planning professions where a group of individuals works together to brainstorm, shape, develop, and illustrate a community design solution. There are a number of benefits to this team-oriented approach: it is a more nurturing environment for students that do not have design backgrounds, it allows for more peer-to-peer learning, and it takes best advantage of varied student skill sets. But perhaps the greatest benefit is that a team of students working together on a common project will be able to develop a more comprehensive solution than any one student working alone. This means that the class \"deliverable\" at the end of quarter could be detailed enough to be of significant value to a stakeholder or client group from the larger community. This studio class, working under the guidance of an experienced instructor, functions like a design firm in providing professional-grade deliverables to real-world community design \"clients'.\n\nSame as: URBANST 183\n\nCEE 131G.
