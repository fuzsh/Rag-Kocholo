        "text": "Introduction/Motivation\n\nNatural disasters cause destruction all over the world. Does anyone know what a natural disaster is? (Elicit student responses). A natural disaster is a natural event such as a flood, earthquake, or hurricane that causes great damage or loss of life. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused immense human suffering for the people of New Orleans. Many factors led to people being stranded for hours or days, going without food and water for many days, and even dying. However, the flooding that occurred after the storm could have been prevented if the levees that surround the city had not broken in the first place. Civil engineers have the enormous responsibility of building projects that enable people to live together in communities. The people of New Orleans depend on engineers to build strong levees to protect their city from the ocean waters that surround it. In this activity, you will use the engineering design process to design a prototype (a small model) of a new levee to protect your city from future flooding.\n\nJust like real engineers, brainstorm and draw out your design before you start to build. After your design has been approved by your teacher, you purchase your materials from the store (your teacher or a helper) and make sure that you stay within budget. Then build and test your design. The team whose levee holds back the most water wins. I cannot wait to see your ideas! You have the opportunity to make a real difference in your community!\n\nProcedure\n\nBackground\n\nThe basic principle of the levee design is to split the plastic dish into two parts: half that represents a lake or river, and half that is the town, which we want to stay dry! On the first day of the activity, students design their levees, and on the second day, they build and test them.\n\nBefore the Activity\n\nGather materials.\n\nMake copies of the Levee Design Worksheet, one per group.\n\nWith the Students\n\nDivide the class into groups of three students each. Gve each group a worksheet.\n\nHave students design and build their levees by completing the design steps described on the worksheet. Go through each step together as a class, giving teams 5-10 minutes for each step.\n\nDesign Process Steps\n\nEDP Step 1: Ask to Identify the Need and Constraints (5 min)\n\nRead this step out loud to students so that everyone is clear on the objective: Once the designs are completed, each group fills one side of the plastic container with water to represent the lake or river. Successful levees keep the water from flooding the town. (It may be helpful to show Figure 3 as an example of a student prototype levee.)\n\nEDP Step 2: Research the Problem (20 min)\n\nProvide resources that students can use to do research on levee design. Have them look up information on the internet, or the teacher can do this in advance, and print out relevant articles for them to read. After they have researched background information, have students conduct a simple experiment. Using two materials of their choice from the list provided, have them determine how well each stops or slows down the flow of water. NOTE: Skip this step if not enough time.\n\nEDP Step 3: Imagine Possible Solutions (5 min)\n\nRemind students that in brainstorming, no idea or suggestion is \"silly.\" All ideas should be respectfully heard. Take an uncritical position, encourage wild ideas and discourage criticism of ideas.\n\nEDP Step 4: Plan by Selecting the Most Promising Solution (10 min)\n\nStudents should converge on an idea, and determine which materials they will use as their budget allows. This step completes the initial design, and is a good stopping point for the first day. Collect the worksheets so you can give students feedback before they build the next day.\n\nEDP Step 5 & 6: Create and Test the Prototype (20-30 min)\n\nHave students \"buy\" their materials with their fun money. Give them plenty of time to build their levees. When they are ready, have them bring their plastic containers to a sink. Fill it with water, and help them observe how well the levee prevents the water from flooding to the other side of the container (see Figure 3). Determine which group was able to retain water the most effectively. Offering small prizes for best levee or most creative design can add some fun to the activity.\n\nEDP Step 6 continued: Evaluate the Prototype (5 min)\n\nHave students reflect on what they learned from the design process by answering the questions on the worksheet.\n\nEDP Step 7: Redesign and Retest (time varies)\n\nThis step is not on the worksheet. If groups finish early, ask them to redesign their levees to get better results, and then retest them."
