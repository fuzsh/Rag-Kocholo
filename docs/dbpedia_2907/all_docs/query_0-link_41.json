        "text": "Well Construction Applications and Permits\n\nWell Construction Applications must comply with the provisions of the Sonoma County Code, Chapter 25B. Applications must clearly identify the proposed work in the application form and on the site plan. An application may propose one primary water well location and up to four alternative locations. A Permit may authorize only one water well to be completed and multiple wells to be destroyed. Multiple non-water wells (e.g., geotechnical borings) can be installed under one Permit.\n\nThe final well location and work completed must be identified by submitting a revised site plan before final approval of the Permit. All dry holes must be properly destroyed and shown on the revised site plan.\n\nThe applicant for a Permit must be a well drilling contractor with a valid California C-57 license. The C-57 contractor who applied for and received the Permit is responsible for the work performed under the issued Permit, including any subcontracted work. Permits are not transferable."
