        "text": "System Layout\n\nInspection Tank\n\nSeptic Tank\n\n10.5m x 2m x 2.5m\n\n24-hour retention time\n\n½ hP pump\n\nDry wells\n\nFinal Site Layout\n\nModified Dry Well (“Poso Ciego”)\n\n2 dry wells\n\n3.3 m diameter\n\n2.1 m perforated pipes extending out from dry well.\n\nRecommended Design\n\nS.T.R.8 U.P.’s final recommendation for La Base is the Modified Bolivian System. The system first moves effluent through an inspection tank used for maintenance purposes, then to a dual chamber septic tank. Solids are removed in the first chamber of the septic tank and cleaner effluent flows over a baffle to the second chamber of the tank. The pump chamber uses a ½ hP pump to dose effluent approximately 6 times a day to the two 3.3m diameter, dry wells located in the courtyard of the school. The dry wells are perforated to allow the effluent to absorb in the soil for final treatment before it reaches the groundwater. The design can handle 2,000 gallons of wastewater each day, so S.T.R.8 U.P. is also recommending La Base take part in a water conservation program to reduce their daily flow. Examples of reducing wastewater include reducing the volume of water per flush and the number of flushes per day. An educational program was developed for La Base about water conservation as part of the final design. The estimated construction cost for the modified system is $6870 USD."
