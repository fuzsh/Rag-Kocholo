        "text": "Nandita B. Basu, University of Waterloo, Canada; Tejasvi Hora, University of Waterloo, Canada; Veena Srinivasan, Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment, India.\n\nIn recent years in Southern India it’s been noted that government policies have been working in some areas in recovering groundwater. In other words, water levels in some aquifers have been increasing. And yet, in these same areas many farmers are experiencing severe groundwater stress because of a lack of groundwater. Nandita Basu, Tejasvi Hora and Veena Srinivasan looked into this seeming paradox and discovered the traditional methodology of understanding the groundwater aquifer systems in Southern India was inherently biased and not revealing the true situation. Here they explain what they discovered and how this bias can be overcome.\n\nFood security is intricately tied to water availability for irrigation. In arid and semi-arid regions of the world a significant fraction of the water demand is met by groundwater. Given the societal dependence on this water source, it is critical to identify groundwater depletion hotspots, to protect against overexploitation.\n\nTraditionally, we rely on measuring water levels in groundwater monitoring wells over time to identify critical regions of groundwater depletion – a faster rate of decline in groundwater levels implies groundwater overdraft and critical conditions. Here, we question the robustness of this methodology and highlight the potential of some inherent biases that can arise in heterogeneous groundwater aquifer systems.\n\nSpecifically, we present a case study (Hora et al, 2019) in South India where recent publications (Asoka et al, 2017) have argued that government policies have contributed to an increase in water levels in the aquifer, or in other words there has been a recovery of the groundwater system. But these findings were in contradiction to our on-the-ground experience in this region, where we have found evidence of severe groundwater stress. PhD student Tejasvi Hora and Professor Nandita Basu from the University of Waterloo have been working in the Gundar Basin near Madurai in South India, while Dr. Veena Srinivasan, a Fellow at the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) has been working in multiple river basins in South India to understand the impacts of human activity on surface and groundwater resources. Both teams of researchers independently found evidence of severe groundwater stress in their respective regions.\n\nWhat was going on? Why was ‘data’ telling a different story than the reality we were experiencing?\n\nTo explore this question a bit more formally, we did a factiva search of all newspaper mentions of the keywords “groundwater + depletion + South India”. We found an increasing number of newspapers in the last 10 years mentioning groundwater depletion that confirmed our local experience (Figure 1).\n\nWe also looked at irrigation data across India from agricultural census databases (http://vdsa.icrisat.ac.in/), and found that farmers in South India have been digging deeper and deeper wells in the last 10 years. The area irrigated by shallow wells has been decreasing, while the area irrigated by deeper wells have been increasing (Figure 2). If groundwater levels are increasing, why would farmers dig more expensive deeper wells?\n\nSurvivor bias can explain the paradox\n\nWe were finally able to explain this conundrum using the concept of ‘survivor bias’. Survivor bias is an artifact that arises in statistical analyses of data by focusing on data that were filtered based on some selection criteria. Subsequent analysis on the ‘surviving’ data has the potential to skew the interpretation. Examples of survivor bias are commonly found in finance where failed hedge funds are excluded from performance studies, or in occupational health studies where there is inadequate consideration of workers with poorer health status.\n\nWater level trends in groundwater monitoring wells are traditionally used to estimate depletion hotspots. While analyzing these data, a selection criterion is often used where wells with a certain proportion of missing data in their record are routinely eliminated from the analysis of long-term trends (Asoka et al, 2017; Bhanja et al, 2017; Reddy et al, 2009). We argue that ignoring the wells with missing data leads to the survivor bias artefact and skews our interpretation of groundwater depletion hotspots.\n\nMissing data in a well record can arise in two ways: (1) physical, where the water level in a well falls permanently or temporarily below the well depth, and (2) logistical, where operators neglect collecting data regularly. While operator errors can contribute to missing data, we argue that the ‘physical’ factor is also a key contributor to the missing well data. This is because the hard rock aquifer system of South India experiences large interannual fluctuations in water levels, such that wells can be dry and record no data in drought years, but can recover relatively quickly and become functional during wet periods (Fishman et al, 2011). However, wells that routinely go dry have a lot of ‘missing data’ and are eliminated from long term analysis of water level trends due to their incomplete datasets.\n\nTo test the hypothesis that ‘well dryness’ was not a random occurrence, we explored the relationship between the percentage of dry wells and metrics that capture climate variability and human impacts on the groundwater system. We designate wells as ‘dry’ in a given season or year if they did not record data in that time frame. We found a higher percentage of dry wells to total wells in low rainfall years, confirming that missing data are most likely related to dry spells, when water levels in wells fall below the well screen (Figure 3a). We further found a higher proportion of dry wells in regions with higher proportion of groundwater irrigated area (Figure 3b), again confirming that missing data was not random.\n\nWells with a large proportion of missing data thus contain critical information about the groundwater stress in a region. When we throw out wells with a lot of missing data and focus only on the wells that ‘survive’, we miss a critical part of the groundwater story. In a heterogeneous hard rock aquifer system, the wells with the most complete datasets are often wells that exist in local groundwater pockets, and thus their trends might not necessarily be representative of the overall trends of the aquifer. Our findings suggest that what is traditionally considered as poor-quality data is actually telling us something important about the aquifer system – the systemic bias in our data source. We argue that the reliance on groundwater level trends in monitoring wells as a sole metric for assessing groundwater stress is not appropriate especially in highly heterogeneous hard rock aquifer systems, with significant spatial and temporal variability in water levels.\n\nAlternate metrics of groundwater stress\n\nWe propose the use of “% dry wells” as an additional metric to evaluate groundwater stress in a region. We found a steady increase in the % dry wells in South India, between 1996 – 2016, highlighting increased stress in the groundwater system (Figure 4), despite groundwater levels showing no significant decline over that period. These hot spots in South India also correspond to areas where the proportion of shallow well irrigated areas has been decreasing, and where other local studies report occurrences of water stress. These hotspots were missed by earlier analyses due to survivor bias, since the surviving wells used in the analysis of water level trends were possibly in water pockets in the landscape. On average, we see an increase in dry wells at a rate of 104 wells/year in South India, with higher percentages in the drought period of 2002 – 2003.\n\nBe careful what you measure\n\nThe study was motivated by the need to answer why farmer distress is increasing in regions experiencing apparent groundwater recovery. We found that this conundrum arises due to a unique problem of survivor bias, where dry wells in groundwater depletion zones are routinely eliminated from long term water level trend analysis. We argue that in hard‐rock aquifer systems with large precipitation‐driven interannual variability and significant spatial heterogeneity, water level trends are not an adequate metric to measure groundwater stress. We propose alternate metrics (such as % dry wells that are derived from data gaps in monitoring well records), might be better suited for assessing groundwater stress in these regions.\n\nAlthough the motivation of the study was specific to South India, findings of the study are applicable to other aquifers around the world where water level trends are still used as the primary metric for assessing groundwater stress.\n\nMore information: nandita.basu@uwaterloo.ca\n\nReference\n\nAsoka A, T Gleeson, Y Wada & V Mishra (2017).
