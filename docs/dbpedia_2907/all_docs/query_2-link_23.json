        "text": "Dikes and levees are hydraulic structures that are built to retain water:\n\nDikes usually run parallel to a water body (such as a river or a sea) and have water only on one side. Dikes were first built to reclaim land from the sea and thus protect land that would naturally be underwater most of the time. They also provide protection against flooding from the sea during extreme events.\n\nLevees are embankments built for flood protection. They are usually earthen embankments and have water only on one side. Levees protect land that is normally dry but may be flooded during extreme events.\n\nDikes and levees need regular maintenance and strengthening to ensure their protection capacities and to meet safety requirements. New projections for sea level rise, magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events and increased coastal and river flood risk can lead to reconsidering safety requirements. This can lead to building new protections on identified weak points or heightening and strengthening existing ones. Re-enforcing dikes and levees can increase their stability and resistance against breaching and their safety against flooding. The most common methods to reinforce dikes and levees are:\n\nEarthworks aiming at flattening the dike or levee slope, raising and widening a dike or a levee, or constructing berms.\n\nStructural measures aiming to strengthen dikes and levees, including seepage or cut-off walls, surface sealing or the additional building of mobile or non-mobile flood protection walls.\n\nImprovements of the dike and levee material, for example through soil improvement or the use of geosynthetic materials.\n\nSurface protection of the dike and levee, for example through rock layers to prevent erosion or allow for overtopping.\n\nProtection of dike and levees through the plantation of woody plants.\n\nOne of the most common failure mechanisms of dikes and levees is breaching in case water overtops them. Dikes and levees can be built in a way that allows for overtopping (e.g. by strengthening the inner wall or broadening and reinforcing the surface). Such dikes and levees prevent the uncontrolled catastrophic breaks associated with devastating flooding of the hinterland. Damages can still occur due to the water that overtops the structures, but they are much smaller compared to a dike or levee break. A different adaptive approach to dikes and levees strengthening consists in their partial or complete deconstruction, especially in potential floodplains to allow more room for the river or sea (see the adaptation option rehabilitation and restoration of rivers and floodplains). In this case dikes or levees can be dismantled completely, opened up by slitting, or relocated further inland if necessary, offering a more sustainable and longer term adaptation potential. For dikes, developing a parallel dike system with enclosed retention polder is also an option to mitigate extreme flood peaks: the construction of double dike systems allows using the space in between to retain the water that washes over.\n\nTherefore, alternative nature-based solutions should always be evaluated to ensure long term sustainability of flood protection, minimise associated tradeoff and provide multiple benefits for the environment and the society."
