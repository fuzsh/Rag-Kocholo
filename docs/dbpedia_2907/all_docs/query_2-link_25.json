During his undergraduate studies, he contributed to ecology research at UC Davis’s Genomic Variation Lab, supporting eDNA studies on bat diets in the Sacramento Valley, post-fire pollination in the Sierra, and aquatic species surveys in the Suisun Delta.\n\nAmy Mahler is an associate economist at RAND Corporation. She has a PhD in economics from the University of Southern California and over five years of experience managing and analyzing large, complex datasets in interdisciplinary research environments. During her graduate studies, she did research with the PPIC Water Policy Center on the implications of farmland transitions in the San Joaquin Valley for land prices and county revenues. Amy’s combination of applied econometric expertise and experience collaborating with diverse research teams is coupled with her interest in public finance and environmental issues.\n\nAnnabelle Rosser is a research analyst at Atlas Public Policy. Prior to that, she was a research associate at the PPIC Water Policy Center. Her research interests include drought mitigation and adaptation, environmental land use planning, and urban water management. Previously, she worked on projects assessing the vulnerability of low-income housing and community water systems to extreme heat and wildfire and evaluating green infrastructure development incentives while working as a graduate student researcher at the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation. She holds a master’s degree in urban and regional planning from the Luskin School at University of California, Los Angeles, and a BA in international studies from the University of Chicago.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis research would not have been possible without the generous contributions of a broad network of San Joaquin Valley stakeholders who participated in an advisory group for this project, meeting with us multiple times over the past three years as a group and providing additional input through smaller meetings: Paul Adams, Reyn Akiona, Julie Allen, Stephanie Anagnoson, Laura Angell, Lynne Ashbeck, Eric Averett, Ashley Boren, Keali’i Bright, Kimberly Brown, Emmy Cattani, Vito Chiesa, Casey Creamer, Vernon Crowder, Ruth Dahlquist-Willard, Vicky Espinoza, Craig Fourchy, Michael Frantz, Aaron Fukuda, Nataly Escobedo Garcia, Amrith Gunasekara, Abby Hart, Ann Hayden, Kara Heckert, Nicole Hernandez, Matt Hurley, Angela Islas, Andrew Isner, Genelle Taylor Kumpe, Ian LeMay, Rey León, Eric Limas, Jim Maxwell, Cork McIsaac, Cannon Michael, Lauren Miller, Amanda Monaco, Greg Norris, Eddie Ocampo, Will Oliver, Jessica Olsen, Lorelei Oviatt, Amanda Peisch, Katie Patterson, Jared Plumlee, Meg Prince, Anja Raudabaugh, Jon Reiter, Mark Riley, Jesse Roseman, Steven Springhorn, Natalie Stork, Emily Tibbott, Julie Vance, Leland Villalvazo, Nancy Vogel, Keith Wallace, Earl Withycombe, Stuart Woolf, and Matt Zidar.
