Can you tell me what forms those are? (Let students raise their hands to answer. Answers: solid/ice, liquid, or gas/vapor.) These different forms are called states of matter.\n\nToday we are going to talk about water in liquid form, particularly when there is a whole lot of water! When it rains and our playground floods, we can’t go outside to play! What do you think causes flooding? (Let students discuss with their groups and offer their ideas.)\n\nFlooding is a natural event that occurs all over the world. Floods can occur anywhere that water overflows onto land that is normally dry. Floods can be caused by hurricanes, broken levees or dams, rapidly thawing snow, ice jams, and heavy slow-moving rain or repeated rains. A flood can happen in a few minutes, hours, days, or over weeks.\n\nAlthough we cannot necessarily stop hurricanes, thawing snow, ice jams or big rainstorms, we can do some things to stop certain areas from being flooded. How do you think we can stop or prevent floods? (Let students discuss with their teammates and offer their ideas.)\n\nToday we will become engineers to figure out ways to save our flooded playground!\n\nProcedure\n\nBackground\n\nFlooding is a natural phenomenon that occurs all over the world. A flood occurs when a large amount of water, that has no place to go, overflows onto what is normally dry land. Floods can be caused by hurricanes, broken levees or dams, rapidly thawing snow, ice jams, and heavy slow-moving rain or repeated rains. A flood can happen in a few minutes, hours, days, or over weeks.\n\nAlthough we cannot necessarily stop hurricanes, thawing snow, ice jams or big rainstorms, we can do some things to prevent, stop, and/or minimize floods in certain areas. These measures are called flood control. Flood control refers to actions taken to protect cities and towns, people and property from flooding.\n\nSome flood control measures include the following:\n\nNot building in flood plains or building above flood levels: A flood plain is an area that is subject to natural flooding from an adjoining waterway. The flood level is the elevation of the maximum flood level. Building structures not in the flood plain and above flood levels help mitigate risks from floods.\n\nBuilding on higher ground: Water naturally fills in low areas first, so building structures on higher ground helps mitigate flood risks.\n\nProtect and/or create more wetlands: Wetlands, including bogs, swamps, and marshes, act like sponges, soaking/absorbing up large amounts of water and then release it gradually. Each acre of wetland can typically absorb a million gallons (3.8 million liters) of water or more.\n\nProtect and/or create more woodlands: Woodland encourage water infiltration and reduce overland flow. Root growth in soils can lead to increased soil porosity, enhancing infiltration and therefore reducing overland flow.\n\nIntroduce water storage ideas: Water can be stored in flood plains and in overflow areas for rivers.\n\nImprove soil conditions: Soil can become compacted by inappropriate soil management, machinery, animal hooves, etc. so that instead of absorbing moisture, holding it and slowly letting it go, water runs off it immediately. Well drained soil can absorb huge quantities of rainwater, preventing it from running into rivers.\n\nPut up flood barriers: River flooding is commonly controlled with levees. Levees are low mounds or embankments typically made of dirt. They are built along the edges of a river or other body of water to prevent water from spilling over onto the surrounding land.\n\nPut up diversion channels: Floodways, or diversion channels, are artificial channels built to divert excess water from a river channel and carry it off by a different route. These channels can also divert water underground.\n\nImprove river/ocean channels: Engineers can make a variety of changes to water channels to make them less likely to flood. They may widen and deepen a channel to increase its water-carrying capacity. They made straighten a winding channel—usually by cutting off a loop— to shorten the river, speed its flow, and lower water levels upstream.\n\nStudents will try to stop flooding (this could be in a different area at school or within the community) by building a model and testing different materials and methods. They need to know what engineers do including their materials and constraints and how to keep a lab notebook. They may work in groups of 4 students and share their findings with their peers.\n\nThroughout the activity they will learn about water as a solid, liquid and gas. They will also be able to describe absorption, evaporation, and erosion.\n\nActivity Overview:\n\nDay 1: Introduce activity, state the problem, and research the problem.\n\nDay 2: Continue KWL Chart and Floods Reading Passage. Review the problem and constraints, students split into groups to design and test their first model.\n\nDay 3: Redesign and retest, present results and complete evaluation.\n\nWith the Students\n\nDay 1 - Playground models\n\nIntroduce the concepts of flooding and flood prevention to the students.\n\nIntroduce the activity vocabulary.\n\nIntroduce the activity by writing on the board.\n\nThe real-life problem: The rain has flooded our playground, which means we cannot go outside to play!\n\nObjective/Challenge: Create a playground model and use materials to engineer a flood prevention device.\n\nConstraints of the challenge/problem: Students can only use the materials provided. They also have a limited amount of time each day to research, design, build, test, and reiterate their designs.\n\nTell students what materials they can use to build their playground model, including the toy logs, sand, moss, rocks, and diaper (for additional absorption.)\n\nSet and display a timer and allow students to plan in their science notebooks for 15 minutes.\n\nPass out materials for the last 15 minutes for students to construct their playground models while recording steps to construct the model. (Tip: label the aluminum pans beforehand with numbers or names of each group.)\n\nDay 2 – Flood prevention\n\nReview the problem, objective/challenge and constraints. Remind students to record each step in their science notebooks when engineering their flood prevention device.\n\nSet and display a timer for 30 minutes. Monitor student work and remember to encourage but not assist or direct them. Students will have the full 30 minutes to work on their flood prevention mechanism/device. If a team finishes early, encourage them to pre-assess their work. What do you think will work well to stop flooding? Is there anything that can be improved?\n\nDay 3 - Test and redesign\n\nSet and display a timer. Give students 5 minutes to put any final touches on their flood prevention mechanism/device.\n\nAllow each team to create a flood using the beaker/pitcher to test their design.\n\nStudents should record the results of each test in the attached their lab notebooks.\n\nAs a team, students can redesign their device based on their testing.\n\nStudents can test redesigns within the 30-minute allotted time.\n\nAssessment\n\nPre-Activity Assessment\n\nKWL: Have students fill in the “What I Know” and “What I Want to Know” columns of the KWL Chart.\n\nActivity-Embedded Assessment\n\nClass monitoring: Take time to evaluate the construction process among each group and provide feedback when necessary, particularly if a group is struggling.\n\nLab notebook: Review student designs and iterations in their lab notebooks. This is a good opportunity to provide feedback to students during the course of the design process.\n\nPost-Activity Assessment\n\nAsk each team: “Do you need to redesign and build your prevention device again? What would you do differently? What would you keep the same?”\n\nKWL: Have students fill in the “What I Learned” column of the KWL Chart.\n\n(Optional) Team Presentations and evaluations: Have each team present what they did and if it solved the problem.\n\nMaking Sense: Have students reflect on the science concepts they explored and/or the science and engineering skills they used by completing the Making Sense Assessment.\n\nInvestigating Questions\n\nDid your device or structure prevent flooding? How? If not, why?\n\nWhat did you do when you redesigned your prevention device?”\n\nDid your team’s design solve the problem? Why or why not?\n\nActivity Extensions\n\nHave the students design models of other parts of the community and test their flood prevention structures.\n\nMore Curriculum Like This\n\nUpper Elementary Lesson\n\nWater, Water Everywhere\n\nStudents learn about floods, discovering that different types of floods occur from different water sources, but primarily from heavy rainfall.
