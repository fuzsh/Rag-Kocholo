        "text": "DroughtÂ is an extended period of unusually dryÂ weatherÂ when there is not enough rain. The lack ofÂ precipitationÂ can cause a variety of problems for local communities, including damage toÂ crops and a shortage of drinking water. These effects can lead to devastatingÂ economicÂ and social disasters, such asÂ famine,Â forced migrationÂ away from drought -stricken areas, andÂ conflictÂ over remainingÂ resources.\n\nBecause the full effects of a drought can develop slowly over time, impacts can be underestimated. However, drought can haveÂ drasticÂ and long-term effects onÂ vegetation, animals, and people. Since 1900, more than 11 million people have died and more than 2 billion people have been affected by drought . Drought is also one of the costliest weather -related disasters. Since 2014 California has lost at least 2 billion-dollars a year, due to drought .\n\nDefining Drought\n\nDrought is a complicatedÂ phenomenon, and can be hard to define. One difficulty is that drought means different things in different regions. A drought is defined depending on the average amount of precipitation that an area is accustomed to receiving.\n\nFor example, in Atlanta, Georgia, the average rainfall is about 127 centimeters (50 inches) a year. IfÂ significantly less rain falls, there may be water shortages and a drought may be declared. However, some arid regions, such as theÂ deserts of the American Southwest, may receive less than about 25 centimeters (10 inches) of rainfall in a non- drought year. A drought in Atlanta could be a very wet period in Phoenix, Arizona!\n\nDetermining the start of a drought can be tricky. Unlike manyÂ natural hazards that bring about sudden and dramatic resultsâsuch asÂ earthquakes,Â tornadoes, andÂ hurricanesâthe onset of a drought can be gradual and subtle. It can take weeks, months, or even years for the full effects of long-termÂ inadequateÂ rainfall to become apparent.\n\nThe end of a drought can also be difficult to determine. While a single rainstorm will provide short-term relief from a drought , it might take weeks or months before levels of precipitation return to normal. The start and end of a drought are often only clear in hindsight.\n\nCauses of Drought\n\nMost droughts occur when regular weather patterns are interrupted, causingÂ disruption to theÂ water cycle. Changes inÂ atmospheric circulationÂ patterns can cause storm tracks to beÂ stalled for months or years. This disruption can dramatically impact amounts of precipitation that a region normally receives. Changes in wind patterns can also be disruptive to how moisture is absorbed in various regions.\n\nScientists have found a link between certainÂ climateÂ patterns and drought . El NiÃ±o is a weather event where the surface water in the Pacific Ocean along the central South American coast rises in temperature. These warmer waters alter storm patterns and are associated with droughts in Indonesia, Australia, and northeastern South America.Â El NinoÂ events keep climate scientists guessing, by occurring every two to seven years.\n\nLa NiÃ±a is the counterpart to El NiÃ±o , when the surface water in the Pacific Ocean along the coast of South America decreases in temperature. The cooler waters affect storm patterns by contributing to drier-than-normal conditions in parts of North and South America. El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a both usually last about a year. The effects of La NiÃ±a on weather patterns are often moreÂ complexÂ than El NiÃ±o . Two of the most devastating droughts in the history of the United Statesâthe 1930sÂ Dust BowlÂ and the 1988 drought in the Midwestâare associated with the effects of La NiÃ±a.\n\nThere is still a lot of debate about the connection between drought andÂ global warming, the current period ofÂ climate change. A 2013 NASA study predicts warmer worldwide temperatures will mean increased rainfall in some parts of the world and decreased rainfall in others, leading to both more flooding and more droughts worldwide. Other scientists question the prediction that there will be more droughts and believe global warming will create a wetter climate around the world.\n\nImpacts of Drought\n\nTrees and other plants have adapted to withstand the effects of drought through various survival methods. Some plants (such as grasses) will slow their growth or turn brown to conserve water. Trees can drop their leaves earlier in the season to prevent losing water through the leaf surface. However, if drought conditions persist, much vegetation will die.\n\nCertain plants have adapted so they can withstand long periods without water. Yuccas, for instance, have deepÂ root systems that can seek out water with incredible efficiency. Cacti have spiny, hairy spines, spikes, or leaves that limit how much water they lose toÂ evaporation. Mosses can withstand completeÂ dehydration. Juniper trees can self-pruneÂ by steering water only to ward the branches required for survival. Other plants only grow when there is enough water to support them. In periods of drought , their seeds can survive under theÂ soil for years until conditions are favorable again.\n\nHowever, many organisms cannot adapt to drought conditions, and the environmental effects of extended, unusual periods of low precipitation can beÂ severe. Negative impacts include damage toÂ habitats, loss ofÂ biodiversity, soil Â erosion, and an increased risk fromÂ wildfires. During the U.S. drought of 1988, rainfall in many states was 50 to 85 percent below normal. Summer thunderstorms producedÂ lightningÂ without rain andÂ ignited fires in dry trees. In Yellowstone National Park 36 percent of the park was destroyed by fire.\n\nDrought can also create significant economic and social problems. The lack of rain can result in crop loss, a decrease in land prices, andÂ unemploymentÂ due to declines in production. As water levels in rivers and lakes fall, water-supply problems can develop. These can bring about other social problems. Many of these problems are health-related, such as lack of water, poorÂ nutrition, and famine . Other problems include conflicts over water usage and food, and forced migration away from drought -stricken areas.\n\nWhile drought is a naturally occurring part of the weather cycle and cannot be prevented, human activity can influence the effects that drought has on a region. Many modern agricultural practices may make land moreÂ vulnerable to drought . While newÂ irrigationÂ techniques have increased the amount of land that can be used for farming, they have also increasedÂ farmersâ dependence on water.\n\nTraditional agricultural techniques allow land to ârestâ by rotating crops each season and alternating areas whereÂ livestock graze. Now, with many areas in the world struggling with overpopulation and a shortage of farmland, there is often not enoughÂ arableÂ land to supportÂ sustainable practices. Over-farming andÂ overgrazingÂ can lead to soil beingÂ compacted and unable to hold water. As the soil becomes drier, it is vulnerable to erosion . This process can lead toÂ fertileÂ land becoming desert -like, a process known asÂ desertification. The desertification of theÂ SahelÂ in North Africa is partly blamed on a prolonged drought whose effects were intensified by farming practices that result in overgrazing .\n\nIncreased drought conditions in Kenya have been attributed toÂ deforestation and other human activities. Trees help bring precipitation into the ground and prevent soil erosion . But in 2009, it was reported that one-quarter of a protected forest reserve had been cleared for farming andÂ logging, leading to drought conditions affecting 10 million people around the country.\n\nHistorical Droughts\n\nScientists often study historical droughts to put modern-day droughts in perspective. Since ourÂ dataÂ fromÂ thermometers andÂ rain gauges only goes back about 100 to 150 years, scientists must researchÂ paleoclimatology, the study of the atmosphere of prehistoric Earth. Scientists gather paleoclimatic data fromÂ tree rings,Â sediments found in lakes and oceans,Â ice cores, and archaeologicalÂ features andÂ artifacts. This allows scientists to extend their understanding of weather patterns for millions of years in the past.\n\nAnalyzing paleoclimatic data shows that severe and extended droughts are anÂ inevitableÂ part of natural climate cycles. North America has experienced a number of long-lasting droughts with significant effects. It is thought that droughts brought about the decline of theÂ Ancestral PuebloansÂ in the Southwest during the 13th century, and the central and LowerÂ Mississippian societies in the 14th to 16th centuries.\n\nIn South America, massive migration out of the once-fertile Atacama Desert 9,500 years ago can be explained by theÂ onsetÂ of extreme drought.\n\nIn Africa, the Sahel region experienced a dry period from 1400 to 1750 that radically altered theÂ landscape. The water level in Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana, for instance, fell so low that an entire forest grew on the lakeâs edges. Today, visitors can still see the tops of trees growing out of the lakeâwhere the water is now more than 15 meters (50 feet) deep.\n\nWhat scientists have learned by looking at Earthâs drought history is that periods of severe drought are a regular part of natureâs cycle. As devastating as droughts in the last century have been, they are considered relatively minor compared to the severity of earlier droughts that have lasted more than a century.\n\nMajor Droughts in the Past Century\n\nThe Dust Bowl of the 1930s is probably the most well-known drought experienced by the U.S. By 1934, 80 percent of the U.S. was struggling with moderate-to- severe drought conditions. The drought lasted nearly a decade and had devastating effects on crop production in theÂ Great Plains. The combination of lack of rain, high temperatures, and strong winds affected at least 50 million acres of land. Massive clouds of dust and sand formed as unusually strong winds lifted the dry soil into the air. These clouds could block out the sun for days, giving the period the name â dust bowl .â In 1934, one dust cloud infamously traveled 2,414 kilometers (1,500 miles), from the Great Plains to the eastern U.S.\n\nMass migration was an indirect effect of the Dust Bowl . Farmers and their families were forced to migrate to other areas in search of work, and by 1940, 2.5 million people had fled the Great Plains . Of those, 200,000 moved to California. The influx of migrants into existing economies already strained by the Great Depression led to a rise in conflict , unemployment , andÂ poverty.\n\nIn the 1950s, severe drought returned to the Great Plains and southwestern United States, affecting half of the continental U.S. Low rainfall and high temperatures caused the production of crops in some areas to drop nearly 50 percent. Hay became too expensive for ranchers, and they had to feed their cattle prickly pear cactus and molasses to keep them alive. By the end of the five-year drought in 1957, 244 of Texasâ 254 counties had been declaredÂ federalÂ drought disaster areas.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the U.S. experienced one of the costliest drought in its history. The three-year spell of high temperatures and low rainfall ruined roughly $15 billion of crops in theÂ Corn Belt. The total of all the losses in energy, water,Â ecosystems, andÂ agricultureÂ is estimated at $39 billion. Federal assistance programs were able to help many farmers , but a longer-lasting drought would make it more difficult for the government to provide nationwide aid.\n\nDroughts continue to affect the U.S. Texas has been suffering from drought since 2010, with 2011 ranking as the driest year in the stateâs history. A September 2012Â National GeographicÂ magazine article called Texas âThe New Dust Bowl.â By 2013, 99 percent of the state was dealing with drought.\n\nAustralia is also a frequent victim of drought . The last decade has been especially severe , earning it the name The Big Dry or The Millennium Drought . Much of the country was placed under water restrictions, wildfires spread in the dry weather , and the water level in someÂ dams fell to 25 percent. In 2007, 65 percent of viable land in Australia was declared to be in a drought . The drought was officially declared over in April 2012.\n\nDroughts that occur in theÂ developing worldÂ can cause even greater devastation. The Sahel region in Africa, which includes eight countries, endured a series of droughts in the 1970s and 1980s where annual rainfall dropped by about 40 percent. In the early 1970s, more than 100,000 people died and millions of people were forced to migrate. Conditions continue to be critical in the area due to drought , overpopulation, failing crops , and high food prices. Drought emergencies for the region have been declared four times since 2000.\n\nTheÂ Horn of Africa, which includes the countries of Ethiopia, Somalia, Eritrea, and Djibouti, is particularly vulnerable to droughts . Because almost 80 percent of the population is rural and depends on agriculture for food and income, famine often accompanies drought .\n\nStruggles for the regionâs limited, remaining resources can lead to conflict and war. In 1984 and 1985, the Horn of Africa suffered one of the worst droughts of the 20th century. The U.N. estimates that in Ethiopia alone, 1 million people died, 1.5 million livestock died, and 8.7 million people were affected by the droughtâincluding being hospitalized, forced to migrate, or forced to change professions. In Sudan, 1 million people died, at least 7 million livestock died, and 7.8 million people were affected.\n\nThe cycle of drought-famine-conflict has persisted in the region, with drought conditions returning every few years since 2000. In 2006, drought affected 11 million people across the Horn of Africa, and the resulting crisis killed between 50,000 and 100,000 people and affected more than 13 million.\n\nForecasting and Measuring Drought\n\nEven though scientists are unable to predict how long a drought will last or how severe it will be, early warning systems andÂ monitoring tools canÂ minimizeÂ some of drought âs damaging impacts. There are a number of tools used to monitor drought across the U.S. Due to the limitations of each system, data from different sources are often compiled to create a more comprehensiveÂ forecast .\n\nThe Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), developed in 1965 by theÂ National Weather Service, is the most commonly used drought monitor . It is a complex measurement system and an effective way to forecast long-term drought . Its limitations are that it does not provide early warnings for drought and is not as accurate for use in mountainous areas because it does not account for snow (only rain) as precipitation . The PDSI is often used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to determine when to begin providing drought relief.\n\nInformation from the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is often used to supplement the PDSI data . The SPI, developed in 1993, is less complex than the PDSI and only measures precipitation ânot evaporation or waterÂ runoff. Many scientists prefer using the SPI because the time period being analyzed can easily beÂ customized. The SPI can also identify droughts many months earlier than the PDSI. The National Drought Mitigation Center uses the SPI to monitor drought conditions around the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor , started in 1999, is a joint effort between three U.S. government agenciesâthe Department of Agriculture , the Department of Commerce, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Monitor Â synthesizes data fromÂ academicÂ and federal scientists into a weekly map indicating levels of dryness around the country. It is designed to be a blend of science and art that can be used as a general summary of drought conditions around the country. It is not meant to be used as a drought predictor or for detailed information about specific areas.\n\nThe Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET) monitors satellite data of crops and rainfall across Africa and some parts of Central America, the Middle East, and Central Asia. Analysis of the data allows for early intervention to try to prevent drought -induced famine .\n\nPreparing for Drought\n\nPeople and governments need to adopt new practices and policies to prepare as much as possible for inevitable future droughts . Emergency spending once a crisis has begun is less effective than money spent in preparation. TheÂ Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)Â estimates that every $1 spent in planning for a natural hazard will save $4 in the long term.\n\nMany areas are extremely vulnerable to drought as people continue to be dependent on a steady supply of water. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends a series ofÂ conservationÂ practices to help farmers prepare for drought . Some preventative measures include in stalling anÂ efficientÂ irrigation system that reduces the amount of water lost to evaporation , storing water in ditches along fields, regularly monitoring soil moisture, planting crops that are more drought -resistant, and rotating crops to allow water in the soil to increase.\n\nInÂ urban areas, many cities are promoting water conservation by addressing water usage habits. Some enforce water restrictions, such as limiting days when lawns and plants can be watered, and offering free high-efficiency toilets and kitchen faucets.\n\nSome drought-ravaged cities are taking even more extreme measures to prepare for future droughts. In Australia, the city of Perth is planning for a massive wastewater-recycling program that will eventually provide up to a quarter of the cityâs water demands by 2060. Perth has been dealing with a decline in rainfall since the mid 1970s. The city, which is on the edge of a huge desert, is also struggling with its history of over-consumption of water. Water-hungry traditions such as planting large, lush lawns and parks will need to be addressed through conservation measures."
