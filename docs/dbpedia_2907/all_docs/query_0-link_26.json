        "text": "Yard Drainage Got You Down\n\nThe recent bout of wet weather has many folks struggling with the “Squishy Yard” nightmare. What may have been just a small damp area for years has now turned into a small pond, or worse yet has migrated into your basement or crawl space. We are in the midst of the wettest time period New Jersey has seen since we started keeping track of the weather (ca: 1850). And there's no sign of relief anytime soon..\n\nStories abound of home owners trying to fix their issues with crazy pipe and drain contraptions, to landscape solutions that just don’t work. This is just not something your landscaper is equipped to handle as our environment is changing in ways we never imagined.\n\nCALL (732) 223-2073 TODAY\n\nGet Rid of Moisture Problem in Your Home\n\nThe Science of the “Squishy Yard”\n\nYour “Squishy Yard” is a hydrology / soil science matter that is best addressed by a Biologist. Today’s Building / Land Science is advancing too fast for Building Codes and Environmental Regulations to keep up with. In fact, 2018 has been reported to be the wettest year in NJ history, pushing borderline soils beyond their water holding capacity and now flooding families out of their homes. There’s no Building Code that adequately addresses this.\n\nNew Jersey - The Wetlands State\n\nNJ is basically a “Swamp” and it was normal to relocate streams and fill wetlands to create developable land. Farmers liked to plant in wetlands due to natural irrigation that today might not be the best place to build a house on. With the revisions to the Clean Water Act in 1977, Wetlands became protected and this land development practice ended.\n\nBut what about those homes built on an old wetland? What about older homes that are now being re-built with bigger basements, in neighborhoods that historically were prone to water intrusion due to wetlands? Better call GreenWorks first as this stuff doesn’t go away on its own.\n\nWhat Makes GreenWorks Different\n\nEverything. We are Building Biologists and deal with moisture all the time. We look at your unique water situation by listening to your accounting of what’s been going on, improvements that have been made, reviewing the information you provide us (see attached list) and reviewing publicly available environmental information. Many times we can do this at no charge and give you an idea of how to proceed. Fee schedule is attached if we can’t.\n\nHow to Get Started\n\nContact our office and gather the requested information (see attached) if you want our help. Be sure to look over our standard recommendations to see if that helps. If a fee is needed for us to move forward we will send you a simple proposal that needs to be executed and returned. Afterwards a time to visit your site will be set up where you will learn more about your environment than you thought possible.\n\nProperty Drainage Assistance\n\nClient Provided Information (for GWE to render an opinion):\n\nMandatory\n\nProperty Survey\n\nPictures / Videos - outside area in question and of basement / crawl space.\n\nShort history of issues, timeline (no more than 300 words) starting with date home built.\n\nNote: If you can provide all the above information and we find it helpful we will research public data and provide a written recommendation at no charge.\n\nHelpful\n\nHouse Plans / Architecturals and/or Pool / Grading Plans\n\nSoil Borings / Foundation Certification (from Engineer / Municipal Inspection)\n\nSeptic Design Plan\n\nWetlands Map & Permit\n\nOther Engineering Plans\n\nSite Inspection Fees If the Above Information is Incomplete / Not Available:\n\nGWE to visit the site ($395 for E. Monmouth-N. Ocean Co (30miles)) / $795 1hr / Quote\n\nOther Fees: Soil Boring $395 / boring / 2 min\n\nTypical Water Management Recommendations with Budget (Permits not Included):\n\nGutter Corrections / Leader Extensions (You or neighbors) ($1,000 - 2,000K)\n\nWindow Well Corrections ($500 - $1,500)\n\nYard Re-Grading / Berms (3,500 - 8,000)\n\nWet Well (3,500 - $5,500)\n\nE-Z Flow Pipe Discharge ($150 per linear foot / $15-$25k)\n\nRecharge Strategies: Dry well / Cistern / Flow Well / Storm Ceptor - Quote\n\nFoundation Re-Waterproofing - Quote\n\nPatio Re-Leveling - Quote\n\nAreas Regulated by Local (Municipality) or State Agencies (NJDEP):\n\nDrainage Easements\n\nConservation Easements\n\nWetlands and their buffer (transition) areas (Mapped or Not Mapped)\n\nDrainage Swales\n\nStreams (Mapped, flowing or just a dry ditch)\n\n\"GWE does not recommend disturbing areas regulated by local, County, State or Federal agencies. These areas require a permit for any type of disturbance no matter how old the home is or how long you have owned it. Disturbance may be subject to fines and / or mandatory restoration. A \"nod\" or verbal \"ok\" from your local construction office is not a permit. And just because your neighbor did it, doesn’t mean you can do it as well.\"\n\nGreenWorks Environmental is Trusted & Certified\n\nOur Building Biologists understand not only the science of the built environment but how it collides with the natural one.\n\nWhat People Are Saying About Us\n\nGet Rid of Moisture Problem in Your Home\n\nTrust your gut, there may be more going on than you think and give GreenWorks a call (732) 223-2073."
