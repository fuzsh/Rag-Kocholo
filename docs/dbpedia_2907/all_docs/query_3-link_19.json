        "text": "Both concrete dry wells and Aquabox are used for stormwater retention. The problem with dry wells, however, is their weight, which progressively increases with capacity, making them difficult to transport and install. They are also closed with a metal or a concrete cover, usually below ground, making inspection challenging, especially if there are multiple wells.\n\nAn Aquabox cube is made of plastic and weighs 9 kg no matter what. It is light, modular, and can be manually handled and installed. It is also stackable, creating no storage problems and greatly reducing transportation costs. It is also designed to be fully inspectable with a small wheeled camera for regular maintenance and cleaning.\n\nTo put it in numbers:\n\nConcrete dry well\n\nAquabox\n\nMaterial\n\nConcrete\n\nPolypropylene\n\nWeight per element\n\n300 – 1500 kg\n\n9 kg\n\nTransport (13.6 m truckload)\n\n50 – 110 m3\n\n460 m3\n\nHandling\n\nRequires machinery\n\nManual\n\nInstallation\n\nSlow and difficult\n\nFast and intuitive\n\nInspection\n\nWith difficulty\n\n100 % inspectable\n\nCompared to dry wells, an Aquabox cube is 30 to 160 times lighter, over 4 times more compact, easy to transport, fast to install, and 100 % inspectable, which, in actuality, cannot be beaten by any traditional drainage system.\n\nContact us now to replace dry wells with Aquabox.\n\nMore about Aquabox"
