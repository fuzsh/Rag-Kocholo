        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe purpose of the Dry Canyon Well project is to provide an additional water supply to Smithfield City. Smithfield City anticipates a 100% increase in population over the next 40 years. To accommodate the future demand, Smithfield City hired T&S Engineers to design a well. T&S Engineers designed the chlorination system, pump house, pipeline to a nearby storage tank, and gravel road to access the well.\n\nAlternatives\n\nBefore choosing to design a new well for Smithfield city, several alternatives were considered as means to provide additional water. These alternatives, listed below, each approached the issue from a different direction. As such, each solution created its own challenges.\n\nAlternative 1: Do Nothing\n\nDoes not solve the water shortage\n\nAlternative 2: Build a New Water Treatment Facility\n\nPlant is a major construction project\n\nTreated water has a bad reputation\n\nAlternative 3: Buy Water from an Adjacent City\n\nRequires installing a long pipeline\n\nDependent on adjacent cities supply\n\nAlternative 4: Expand the Existing Secondary Water System\n\nRequires installation of vast amounts of pipe\n\nLong term construction necessary for install\n\nAlternative 5: Build a New Well\n\nDependent on source in usable location\n\nDecision Matrix\n\nEach alternative was analyzed qualitatively. These constraints are listed in the first table. Each criteria was selected with respect to Smithfield City’s needs. The table contains each alternative’s rank from one to five for each qualitative criteria.\n\nEach alternative was also analyzed quantitatively. The second table displays the cost estimates and estimated completion time for each alternative.\n\nSelected Alternative\n\nAfter considering all of the alternatives, the team determined that the well alternative was the best option. Research showed that the well alternative was the least expensive alternative, and also the quickest solution, as all the other options would have taken more time to construct. Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, drilling a well in Dry Canyon is the most reliable option, since the other alternatives depend on cooperation from other municipalities and the economy and or needs of the other municipality could change in the future.\n\nT&S Engineers contacted Logan City, a city near to Smithfield, regarding their well & chlorination facility located at 600 East and 700 North, Logan, UT. After visiting the well’s location and reviewing Logan City’s well-design, the team modeled the Dry Canyon well after Logan City’s design."
