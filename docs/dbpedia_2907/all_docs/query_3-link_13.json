        "text": "For decades, it was common for sump pumps to discharge directly into the sanitary sewer system. However, every year, more and more communities ban the practice. The solution? A dry well.\n\nTHE PROBLEM\n\nAll drains in your home, including floor drains, sinks, laundry tubs, toilets, and bathtubs drain directly into the sanitary sewer. The water then flows to a wastewater treatment plant.\n\nWhen a sump pump is connected to the sanitary sewer system, groundwater and rainwater collected by the pump are added to the sanitary sewer system.\n\nAccording to the Metropolitan Council Environmental Services, in Minnesota, just one home continuously pumping stormwater from its foundation or basement into the sewer system equals roughly what 40 homes would send down the drain on a typical day.\n\nSump pumps are designed for groundwater and rainwater. Sanitary sewer pipes are designed for sewage. When the two mix, it can spell disaster.\n\nA typical sanitary sewer pipe from the home to street is only 8 inches in diameter, and only so much sewage can flow through the pipe at any given time.\n\nThe extra water from a sump pump can overwhelm the system, pushing sewage back into basements. In heavy storms, sewage might come out a basement toilet or washing machine drain.\n\nIn addition to being a stinky mess, exposure to raw sewage poses a health risk.\n\nTo prevent this, communities are banning the practice of connecting sump pumps to sanitary sewer systems.\n\nSome cities permit older homes with sump pumps connected to the sanitary sewer system to be “grandfathered” in and remain connected while prohibiting the practice in new homes.\n\nOther communities are mandating all sump pumps disconnect from the sanitary sewer system.\n\nIf a sump pump can’t drain into the sanitary sewer system, where does the water go?\n\nSump pump drainage hoses should stay outside the house. They may drain water into the yard or into the street to flow toward a stormwater drain.\n\nIncreasingly, sump pump owners are opting to install a dry well.\n\nTHE SOLUTION\n\nA dry well is an underground structure that disposes of unwanted water. It is a covered, porous-walled chamber allowing water to slowly soak into the ground.\n\nWater collected in the dry well is slowly released into the ground.\n\nWhen installing a dry well, a hole for the well will be dug in a homeowner’s yard. A trench leading from the home to the dry well will be dug, with a pipe connecting the sump pump to the well laid in the trench.\n\nFlo-Well dry wells collect, retain, and discharge stormwater on-site, offering a gravel-free alternative to a traditional dry well. Flo-Well dry wells are modular and can be connected in series or stacked to meet a variety of project needs."
