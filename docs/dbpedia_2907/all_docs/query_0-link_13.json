        "text": "About this book\n\nFirst published in 1958, Salvato's \"Environmental Engineering\" has long been the definitive reference for generations of sanitation and environmental engineers. Approaching its fiftieth year of continual publication in a rapidly changing field, the Sixth Edition has been fully reworked and reorganized into three separate, succinct volumes to adapt to a more complex and scientifically demanding field with dozens of specializations. Updated and reviewed by leading experts in the field, this revised edition offers new process and plant design examples and added coverage of such subjects as urban and rural systems. Stressing the practicality and appropriateness of treatment, the Sixth Edition provides realistic solutions for the practicing public health official, water treatment engineer, plant operator, and others in the domestic and industrial waste treatment professions. This volume, \"Environmental Engineering: Water, Wastewater, Soil and Groundwater Treatment and Remediation, Sixth Edition\", covers: water treatment; water supply; and wastewater treatment.\n\nContents\n\nPREFACE.

Nemerow, PhD, was an environmental engineering and water consultant. He was a professor at the University of Miami and the former head of Environmental Engineering at Syracuse University. He published over 210 technical papers and twenty-three textbooks. Franklin J. Agardy, PhD, is founding partner of Forensic Management Associates. As a civil engineering professor, he developed San Jose State's graduate program in sanitary engineering. He has written, coauthored, or coedited seven textbooks. Patrick Sullivan, PhD, is founding partner of Forensic Management Associates. Prior to his forensics career, he was a senior environmental analyst at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology. He has written, coauthored, or coedited five textbooks. The Late Joseph A. Salvato served as a sanitary and public health engineer consultant and assistant commissioner in the Division of Sanitary Engineering for the New York State Department of Health. He was also a Fellow of the ASCE and the APHA and adjunct associate professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute."
