Dry wells are underground structures used to transmit stormwater runoff underground. They are typically 3 feet wide and 30-70 feet deep, lined with perforated casing, and can be filled with gravel or left empty. Dry wells allow stormwater to recharge groundwater, but there is a risk of contaminating groundwater if stormwater is not pretreated or dry wells are placed in areas with spills. Proper pretreatment and siting of dry wells in areas without contamination sources can safely manage stormwater and recharge groundwater.",
