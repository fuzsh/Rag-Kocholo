        "text": "The Pacific Northwest is home to some of the wettest areas in the United States, with rainfall averages of 36” per year in the city of Portland. Construction sites that may be subject to rainfall or water tables near ground level will utilize dewatering processes to safely remove the water to a location outside of the area of work.\n\nHere at Perlo, we assume that all months between October and June will involve wet weather construction but pay close attention to the weather year-round. When we are evaluating dewatering methods, a variety of factors are considered to find the best method from an efficiency and cost standpoint, as well as minimizing the environmental impact of our efforts.\n\nEvery construction site’s technique for dewatering will be different, which makes the topic an important one to pay attention to.\n\nWhat methods exist for dewatering?\n\nThere are several methods utilized on jobsites depending on the specific needs and soil conditions:\n\nMethods for water redistribution\n\nDewatering is heavily monitored by local, state and federal guidelines. Generally speaking, water from a construction site is not supposed to leave the site itself, especially if it has not been cleaned of sediment or chemicals. As with the methods for removing water from the ground, the soil types that exist on the site will often determine how the removed water should be re-distributed. For instance, in the case of porous or gravelly soils, the water may be able to be pumped to a particular area on site and allowed to percolate back into the ground. But less porous soils, like clay soils, may not accommodate this option. Here are some of the many ways water can be redistributed:\n\nSometimes the volume of water or lack of redistribution areas will require that water be pumped into the storm or sewer lines. In these cases, the water must be treated for sediment and chemicals before it can go into the public lines.\n\nJurisdictional requirements for dewatering\n\nSimilar to what we saw in the Navigating the Permit Process article, achieving dewatering permits is dependent on the rules and regulations of each individual jurisdiction. Most will require drawings be provided with engineering to demonstrate how the water will be treated.\n\nPlans for dewatering will be based on a report developed by a geotechnical engineer. This will allow the engineering and construction teams to understand the site conditions and determine how best to capture site water for redistribution. The plans must be reviewed and approved by the local jurisdictions. Often, multiple plans must be in place as contingencies for multiple weather conditions and all options must be pre-approved.\n\nPermanent construction dewatering systems\n\nWhile construction dewatering is part of our everyday construction practices, permanent dewatering systems are often installed inside buildings with underground parking structures, basements or those with active springs underneath. In these cases, the building will have a sump pump system that pulls water from the lower level and distributes it into the storm water or sanitary sewer system. Building managers will need to maintain the system to ensure proper working order for the life of the building to avoid flooding lower levels.\n\nBest practices for dewatering\n\nThe most critical piece of installing and maintaining construction dewatering is to plan ahead, review and adjust the plan frequently and remain flexible when required. This scope of work involves coordination from all parties working onsite, close communication with inspectors and the local jurisdiction and diligent attention to the system to ensure it is operating properly no matter the site and weather conditions."
