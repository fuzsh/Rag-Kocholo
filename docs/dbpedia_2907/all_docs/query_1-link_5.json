        "text": "In today's world, we live with the threat of climate change hanging over our heads. People who work in environmental engineering tackle the environmental crisis head-on every day. The work they do can be life-changing for millions of people.\n\nEnvironmental engineers use their broad knowledge of waste management, engineering, and the sciences, such as chemistry, biology, and soil science, to improve human and ecological health through innovation and technology.\n\nAnd if that isn't a good enough reason to pursue a degree in this field, we have eight more for you. So why is an environmental engineering degree a good career choice?\n\nWhat is an environmental engineer?\n\nAn environmental engineer is an engineering professional who protects people from the effects of an increasingly unstable and unpredictable environment. They work to eliminate pollution, improve recycling and waste disposal efforts, and provide clean water to communities.\n\nEver since civilization began settling down in single places, the need to manage waste has been an issue. As cities began to emerge, environmental problems increased to include providing clean water, disposing of solid waste and dealing with sewage. Add to these concerns issues of food growth, such as air quality and soil contamination, and you begin to get a picture of environmental engineers' challenges.\n\nEnvironmental engineers investigate water, soil and air pollution and devise technical solutions to control these issues. At the same time, they must keep legislative, economic, social, and political concerns in mind.\n\nThe goal is to ensure the long-term viability of societal development and the use of water, land, and air resources. This is accomplished by managing these resources to minimize environmental pollution and degradation. To do this, they must:\n\nPlan and design water systems.\n\nDevelop wastewater treatment facilities.\n\nAnalyze surface and groundwater quality.\n\nDesign soil remediation systems.\n\nCreate plans for waste collection and disposal.\n\nReuse wastewater and sludge.\n\nIf you don't mind getting your hands dirty and want to help the environment, this might be your career.\n\nSigns that you would be a great environmental engineer\n\nThe role of an environmental engineer is highly gratifying, but it takes a particular kind of person to excel in the position. So, what characteristics make someone an excellent environmental engineer candidate?\n\nYou have passion\n\nOf course, you must be passionate about protecting the environment and the earth. But that passion must also translate into caring about people and communities. They are the ones that suffer the most from pollution and poor water supplies.\n\nYou have a love of science\n\nTo solve environmental problems, environmental engineers must apply biology and chemistry principles.\n\nYou're innovative\n\nAs the earth's problems worsen, innovative solutions become more critical. Environmental engineers need a creative mind and a healthy imagination. In addition, they must possess analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.\n\nYou're team-oriented\n\nEnvironmental engineers make a difference, but they don't do it alone. Instead, they typically work with a team comprised of construction workers, ecological bioengineers, and public health professionals.\n\nYou're a good communicator\n\nThe solutions created by environmental engineers tend to be highly technical. Therefore, they need to be able to translate their instructions into a language everyone can understand.\n\nYou have technical skills\n\nEnvironmental engineers often use technology to create designs. They will need to become proficient in software such as Autocad and SAS.\n\nEven if you think you have the right characteristics to be successful as an environmental engineer, why should you pursue this career path?\n\n8 reasons you should earn your degree in environmental engineering\n\nIf you are still waffling on this career choice, consider these reasons to get a degree in environmental engineering.\n\n1. Environmental engineering is a growing field\n\nEnvironmental engineers have been around for centuries and will be around for many more. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that the job outlook for this field is as fast as average from 2021 to 2031. As climate change continues to be a concern, the need for environmental engineers will likely continue to increase.\n\n2. Environmental engineering offers a wide range of career options\n\nThe career options in this field have many applications designed to reduce waste and encourage positive relationships between manmade systems and nature. Environmental engineers work in:\n\nWater treatment – Developing water treatment plants and solutions\n\nGovernment – Working as environmental compliance specialists\n\nEducation – Educating people on the impact of climate change and what is causing it, the benefit of environmental engineering, and the skills necessary to do the job well\n\nConstruction – Working as land surveyors\n\nTransportation – Planning routes for vehicles to travel safely based on environmental factors.\n\nResearch and science – Working in the field as investigators in public health and for corporations.\n\nNatural science – Analyzing ecosystems and factors affecting them\n\nCivil design – Building infrastructures based on the environmental factors around them\n\nEnergy – Evaluating energy systems to determine their environmental impact.\n\nIt’s possible to find a job in just about any sector because most things impact or are impacted by the environment in some way.\n\n3. Environmental engineering salaries are competitive\n\nAccording to the BLS, environmental engineers make a competitive salary, with actual salaries impacted by various factors, including experience, education and location.\n\n4. Environmental engineering is a challenging and rewarding field\n\nMany people say they want a career that allows them to help people. As an environmental engineer, you’ll benefit not just individuals but whole communities, cities and the planet. What could be more satisfying? With climate change affecting the entire world, you could have a job that helps literally everyone.\n\n5. Environmental engineering offers opportunities to travel\n\nEnvironmental engineers work worldwide because problems exist everywhere. One day you may be analyzing a field in Kansas, and the next be studying what might be causing acid rain in China.You could find work almost anywhere.\n\n6. Environmental engineering provides opportunities to make a difference\n\nThe environment provides essentials such as clean air and safe drinking water. Therefore, environmental engineering has a significant impact on people's daily lives. It aids in the provision of safe drinking water, the reduction of water pollution, and the facilitation of proper waste disposal.\n\nEnvironmental engineers advise governments and private companies on managing waste, so it doesn’t pollute the environment. They examine waste generation per capita for a sample population living in a specific area and recommend waste collection, management, and disposal methods.\n\n7. Environmental engineering is interdisciplinary\n\nEnvironmental engineering uses the principles of biology, microbiology, engineering, chemistry, soil science, and environmental science to create solutions to people's daily problems. If you are struggling to choose between a favorite type of science, why not work in a field that connects them all in a way that helps others?\n\n8. Environmental engineering will allow you to help protect our planet\n\nAs the climate continues to change, ecosystems and communities in the United States and worldwide are impacted. The seas are warming, the icebergs are melting, and the ocean levels are rising.\n\nClimate change impacts different areas of society, and in culmination, they create a global issue. For example, drought has a catastrophic impact on food resources and causes health problems. Flooding spreads disease and damages natural and artificial infrastructure. The effects on humans can be severe health problems and even death.\n\nWeather and climate put lives at risk. The heat warms the oceans, so hurricanes become stronger and wetter, leading to more damage and deaths. In other areas, dry conditions mean wildfires, threatening wildlife and communities.\n\nEnvironmental engineers are creating technology to monitor and combat these changes and shape the world's response. These specialized engineers have numerous opportunities to work directly in the field of sustainability and contribute to climate change solutions.\n\nWhy study environmental engineering at CMU?\n\nOnce you know environmental engineering is the right career choice, the next step is finding a program.
