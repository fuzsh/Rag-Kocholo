        "text": "Even small hygienic articles, such as bandages, tampons, sanitary pads, strings or air freshener baskets which are either thrown away, or fall accidentally to domestic toilets, can be responsible for serious pump failures in water supply and sewage devices. Despite 25 years of experience, we were not able to prevent all failures caused by solid parts, and therefore we have created a dry well pumping station with solids separation system.\n\nWe know how to draw conclusions from previous experiences\n\nEasier access to inspection openings, lack of dead spaces where sediments could decay, execution of acid-proof steel, as well as special control system, are only some of the parameters which decide about better functionality of Instalcompact dry well pumping station.\n\nOpening distributor and separator, that is, preparation of dry well pumping station for servicing, requires the work of only one person and lasts less than 1 minute. We can guarantee this time ! Additionally, the tank and separators were equipped with indicators made of tempered glass, which facilitate device inspection without disassembly."
