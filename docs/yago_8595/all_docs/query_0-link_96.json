        "meta_description": "This chapter considers the main developments in Marcel Carne's career, from his early work as a journalist, amateur filmmaker, and assistant director, to his production of his first feature films, Jenny and Drôle de drame, and his contributions to poetic realism at the end of the decade, Le Quai des brumes, Hôtel du Nord, and Le Jour se lève. It is concerned with charting the main developments that led towards the production of these films, and with explaining what was specific to Carne's own particular inflection of poetic realist cinema. Even before producing his first feature film, he had made progress in this direction, making, along with Jean Aurenche and Paul Grimault, a number of early advertisement designed to be shown before films, as well as, more significantly, a short silent film entitled Nogent, Eldorado du dimanche.",
