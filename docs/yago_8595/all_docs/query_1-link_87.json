        "text": "November 18, 2019\n\nRoger Gilbert-Lecomte, René Daumal, Robert Meyrat, and Roger Vailland met in school as teenagers. From the start they had a shared vision: transcending the mundane and rejecting the distinctions taken for granted as social constructs, such as dream vs. reality and visible vs. invisible. Their tight-knit group grew even tighter as they united themselves through secret signs and language, and by taking part in rites of shared voluntary torture (e.g., auto-asphyxiation), experimentation with a wide range of controlled substances, and in one case even a game of Russian roulette. They began as the Simplists and grew into the Grand Jeu, adding associates along the way, eventually becoming aligned, though decidedly not integrated with, the burgeoning Surrealists.\n\nThough on the surface there appears to be a significant number of commonalities between the two groups, Le Grand Jeu and the Surrealists did not quite see eye to eye. First, there was André Breton's general dickishness toward anyone who differed with him. But more specifically, he objected to the (admittedly inexplicable, though likely intended as inflammatory) references to God in the Grand Jeu publications. Then there was the issue of Roger Vailland's pseudonymous support for the far-right Paris police chief Jean Chiappe (which led to Vailland's split with Grand Jeu) and the group's association with certain Surrealists excommunicated by Breton, including Artaud. For their part, the Grand Jeu perceived a lack of rigor in the Surrealist approach. Though prone to heavy drug use and recreational oxygen deprivation, the Grand Jeu was remarkably coherent and consistent in their messaging throughout the three published issues and one unfinished issue of their magazine, also known as Le Grand Jeu. They were a much tighter, more uniform group than the Surrealists, and they intended to maintain their independence as such.\n\nThe Grand Jeu chose the mystical over the rational, rejecting most Western philosophy in favor of that of the East. They sought to maintain the 'great primitive human spirit', so often stifled during the passage into adulthood. As adolescents, the core membership had actively continued to cultivate the 'immemorial riches of childhood—oneiric, metaphysical, poetic' so that they would not be lost. It is this preservation of the childlike state that lay at the core of their philosophy.\n\nOur prophets are among us, revealed by mythical signs. The primitive soul is not yet dead in the West so long as the bloody nourishment of dreams remains. Brutally repressed for centuries, enslaved by religions which seek to divert their furious impulses to the benefit of the most disgusting of social organisations, dreams will have their revenge on the death throes of those cults. (Gilbert-Lecomte)\n\nIn format, the magazine Le Grand Jeu typically included three sections: (1) theoretical essays, (2) literary texts including fiction and both lined and prose poetry, and (3) 'chroniques' which ranged from book reviews to commentary on current events and responses to Le Grand Jeu surveys. Of the latter, two of the more interesting were the following: a response from Carlo Suarès (translator of Krishnamurti into French) to the survey about personal pacts with the Devil (of which he claimed to have made one); and a response from Michel Leiris to the survey on Infant Sexuality (quite revealing!).\n\nThe lifespan of the journal was comparatively short—running only from 1928 to 1930. One could argue, though, that Le Grand Jeu, both as a publication and a group, still served its purpose. Their platform was built as a studied wake-up call to society. Did they hold out much hope of succeeding? Probably not, but their legacy still lives on and it is no less worthy of consideration than Breton's manifestos (I would argue in fact that it might even be more worthy).\n\nIn the end the group's members went their separate ways. Gilbert-Lecomte tragically succumbed to his self-destructive lifestyle. Daumal later took the spiritual path, eventually following Gurdjieff's teachings. The seeds of this search can already be seen in his Le Grand Jeu writings, such as the essay 'Freedom Without Hope'. Other members joined the Surrealists and/or went on to write in various capacities. Roger Meyrat alone took a different route: becoming a doctor in the group's hometown of Reims, where he made weekly visits to Gilbert-Lecomte's grave.\n\nJuly 25, 2015\n\nThe complete four issues of the journal \"Le Grand Jeu\" (The Great Game). A publication edited and published in the years 1928 to 1930 by René Daumal, Roger Gilbert-Lecomte and Roger Vailland. Surrealists by nature, but not part of the band of outsiders. Mostly had an interest in the spiritual life of drug taking, almost dying, and the difference between the awaken and dream/sleep life. The beauty of this publication is the dynamic relationship between Daumal, Gilbert-Leconte and Valland. Basically they were teenagers - super bright teenagers, but nevertheless very young and adventuresome. The first thing that occurs to me is the photographs of this editorial group. All of them are bordering on beautiful, and at the very least, very handsome. As they get older, and as drug addiction takes place, their look becomes more decadent looking. I love that. As for the writing, it is truly awesome. There is a tight collection of writers/thinkers who contribute to the publication, and this is a superb edition by Atlas Press - who specialize in European avant-garde movements and their journals. A super important publication then and now, as well a remarkable introduction by Dennis Duncan, who provides us with the sense of time and adventure that took place in Paris in the late 20s. Buy it!\n\nMarch 6, 2020\n\nA collection of prose, poetry and mystical philosophy from one of the younger Surrealist splinter groups.\n\nJuly 13, 2023\n\nAnd if we still want to describe an image torn from the hurricane of the void as \"beautiful\", its beauty will be twice as objective as what we customarily dress up in that name. Firstly because it comes from a world closer to reality and more universal than celebrated 'nature'. And also because whoever translates it into the human cannot transpose it. For it is saved from the inevitable coefficient of individual deformation by the sole fact that it cannot be the work of an individual who, in its creation, was merely its movement. Whoever has voided his consciousness of all images of our false world, which is not a closed system, can attract other images to himself which are seized by the suction of the void, but which come from outside the space where we breathe and the time in which our hearts beat, immemorial recollections or dazzling prophecies, and these he will attain by a cold flush of anguish. In an instant the universe of his flesh is dead to him: I have never been able to believe that when I close my eyes, everything would stay where it was. I close my eyes. It is the end of the world. He opens his eyes. And when everything was destroyed, everything was still where it was, but the light had changed. And what a silence. Good God, what a silence.\n\n-From \"The Death of Art After Rimbaud\" by Roger Gilbert-Lecomte in Issue #2\n\nLe Grand Jeu was a philosophical journal published between 1928 and 1930 by a small group of radical neo-Surrealists who sought mystical enlightenment through altered mental states. Unfortunately a combination of narcotics abuse and the proverbial leftist in-fighting killed their movement before it got off the ground, leaving only these three issues behind. But Le Grand Jeu is more than simply a literary oddity: it provides a window into the psychology of the Lost Generation and the search for meaning beyond the desolation wrought by the Great War. I liked this passage in particular because it reminds me of one of my favorite selections from T.S. Eliot's \"The Waste Land\":\n\n—Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,\n\nYour arms full, and your hair wet, I could not\n\nSpeak, and my eyes failed, I was neither\n\nLiving nor dead, and I knew nothing,\n\nLooking into the heart of light, the silence.\n\nOed’ und leer das Meer.\n\nAlso provides a sort of bridge between the Symbolists and Decadents of fin de siècle and the politics of drugs and revolution that fascinated artists, writers, and thinkers well into the 1970s. Very worth a read.\n\nNovember 20, 2023\n\nSimplists >>>>> Surrealists.\n\nThis book simultaneously makes me feel more connected and yet more alone, for I don't know any other artists like this right now. I'm still struggling to find my own Daumal and Gilbert-Lecomte, independently continuing where they left off, hoping one day my work will find similar, like-minded artists I can build a community with, just as the members of Le Grand Jeu did.\n\nIf you're reading this, and if you can relate to the following quote and all that's been said, if you, too, are tired of fiction and every kind of illusory addiction being used as a means of escape, if all you really want in art is insight, ontological relevance, and emotional vulnerability, to face life at every moment instead of running away, then, please, get in touch.\n\n\"With a few very rare but enormous exceptions, I renounce art as much in its highest forms as in its basest, that virtually all the world's literature, painting, sculpture, [cinema], and music has always caused me to slap my thighs in bestial laughter as if confronted by an enormous faux pas.\n\nThe genre-pieces produced by geniuses and real talents, the technical perfection acquired by the systematic exploitation of recognised or unrecognised methods, the assiduous practice of imitating 'nature', the 'long patience' of the salaried academician, all these kinds of activity have always scandalised me by their complete uselessness. Uselessness. It is art for art's sake. Otherwise known as populism. A hygienic distraction to make us forget hard-to-grasp reality.\"\n\n4.5 stars\n\nJanuary 13, 2023\n\nThis is great for a historical introduction to the grand jeu and their writings, which I thought were for the most part funny and enjoyable and even a little exciting. I liked especially:\n\nAll of Grand Jeu 4\n\nOn the origin of monsters\n\nHow to combat the cost of living\n\nPuericulture\n\nThe seductiveness of voltage\n\nThe introduction\n\nAnd others! Can’t remember which"
