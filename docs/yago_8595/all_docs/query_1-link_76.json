        "text": "The exhibition “Henri Cartier-Bresson. Le Grand Jeu” is presented from May 19th to August 22nd 2021 at the BNF in Paris.\n\nAn ensemble created in 1973 by the artist himself at the request of his friends and collectors Dominique and John de Ménil, the Master Collection brings together “the best possible prints\n\nof Cartier-Bresson’s 385 best photographs”. 6 editions of the Collection were printed and distributed across the world, providing a remarkable overview of the photographer’s body of work.\n\nThe exhibition « Henri Cartier-Bresson. Le Grand Jeu » submits the Master Collection to the viewpoints of five guest curators, all of whom have close connections with photography in\n\ncommon : François Pinault, collector, the photographer Annie Leibovitz, the writer Javier Cercas, the film director Wim Wenders, and Sylvie Aubenas, heritage curator at the BnF. No monograph, theme, geographic area or chronology in this exhibition, but rather a confrontation of five points of view on the work of the « eye of the century », revealed in the course of an unparalleled architectural walkabout."
