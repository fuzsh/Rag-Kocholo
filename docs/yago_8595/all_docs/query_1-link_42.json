        "text": "Produced by Montana Colors\n\n20.7 x 7 x 7 cm\n\nLimited edition of 500 copies\n\nColor: Colorado Red\n\n2023\n\nPlease note that orders are limited to two spray cans per person and that parcels can be shipped exclusively inside European Union. All orders that don't respect these indications will be cancelled and refunded.\n\nFred Brathwaite, more popularly known as Fab 5 Freddy, is an American visual artist, filmmaker, and Hip-Hop pioneer. He is considered one of the architects of the street art movement. Freddy emerged in New York's downtown underground creative scene in the late 1970s as a graffiti artist.\n\nHe was the bridge between the burgeoning uptown rap scene and the downtown art scene. Freddy was a member of the Brooklyn-based graffiti group the Fabulous 5, known for painting the entire side of New York City Subway cars. Freddy began to transition from street graffiti into the art world. Freddy connected with New York underground filmmaker Charlie Ahearn, whom he had met at The Times Square Show, and they began production on the film Wild Style (released 1983).\n\nThe film would go on to showcase artist Lee Quiñones as artist Zoro, from the Bronx, and of the burgeoning Hip-Hop culture. It was the first film to illustrate Hip-Hop culture, derived from an idea Freddy had to refute the negative depiction of NYC's urban youth and to link for the first time break dancing, MCing, DJing and graffiti under one umbrella or branches from the same tree.\n\nFreddy created the film's original music score, co-produced the film and even ended up being casted as one of the leading roles. In the late 1980s, Freddy became the first host of the groundbreaking Hip-Hop music video show Yo! MTV Raps, and directed many iconic rap videos and film projects into the 90s and beyond. To this day, Fab 5 Freddy remains a cultural icon and vanguard of the culture."
