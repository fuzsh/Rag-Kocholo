Le Grand Jeu” meets two of the five curators of the show: director Wim Wenders – in live connection – and Sylvie Aubenas, curator and director of the Department of Prints and Photography at the Bilbliothèque nationale de France. Together with photographer Annie Leibovitz, author Javier Cercas and collector François Pinault, they have shaped their own vision on the photographer’s work, in an exhibition collecting the most iconic and most significant pictures by Henri Cartier-Bresson."
