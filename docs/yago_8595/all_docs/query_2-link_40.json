        "text": "An Introduction to La Kermesse héroïque\n\nLa Kermesse héroïque is an iconoclast camp romantic comedy film directed by the Belgian Jacques Feyder and produced in France in 1935. It deconstructs the founding myths of colonialism. In 1616, during the Spanish occupation of Flanders, the people of Boom, a city in the province of Antwerp, are busy preparing for the carnival festivities when they learn that Spanish troops will stop over for one night. Traumatised by memories of the damage inflicted by the Spanish during the 16th century, the city’s mayor stages his own death and goes into hiding together with the city’s most important men. The mayor’s wife, Cornelia, seizes power for herself and the women of Boom, and warmly welcomes the Spaniards who stay without causing any harm. While the troops are in town, the women’s newly acquired power remains unquestioned.\n\nTaking its title from Jacques Feyder’s film, La Kermesse héroïque is three days long arts festival. It is the ﬁrst edition of the EUROPALIA RESIDENCY AWARD, an initiative of the Belgium-based EUROPALIA arts biennial, Turkey being its guest country from 6 October 2015 until 31 January 2016. Aiming to support the local contemporary art scene, EUROPALIA has provided a group of artists and curators with a residency in Istanbul in order to realise an exhibition in Brussels. La Kermesse héroïque takes place in the Beursschouwburg and Midpoint, two venues in the western half of the pentagon-shaped centre of Brussels.\n\nThe Beursschouwburg building was erected in 1885 to host a private café, party hall and shop that operated under the name of Brasserie Flamande. In 1946, its party hall was converted into a theatre ‘à l’italienne’, and it reopened its doors as Théâtre de la Bourse. After heavy renovation works in 2004, Beursschouwburg is today a theatre for multidisciplinary arts. During La Kermesse héroïque festival, the main Beursschouwburg auditorium will host two premieres of commissioned artworks by Laurie Charles and Marnie Slater.\n\nMidpoint Café & Bar opened in 2011 in a former R&B bar. From the outset, artists have frequently used Midpoint to host their openings or after parties, birthdays, farewell celebrations, etc. Between 2012 and 2013, Midpoint hosted a series of events in which newly commissioned in situ works were presented. For La Kermesse héroïque, a book of interviews about life at Midpoint will be launched in the bar. The festival will close with a concert by “Merman” Steev Lemercier and a DJ set by Olivia Dunbar, also at Midpoint."
