        "text": "While many museums remain shuttered due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Apollo’s usual weekly pick of exhibitions will include shows at institutions that are now reopening as well as digital projects providing virtual access to art and culture.\n\nAt the request of the collectors Jean and Dominique de Menil, in the early 1970s Henri Cartier-Bresson selected a ‘Master Set’ of 385 photographs that he thought had been the most significant over the course of his long career. For this exhibition at the Palazzo Grassi (which reopens on 11 July), five guest curators – including the director Wim Wenders, the photographer Annie Liebovitz, and the collector François Pinault – have been invited to select 50 works from this set each, to present a composite view of this modern master. The works range from his early candid street snaps to later photographs from his travels worldwide (until 10 January 2021). Find out more from the Grassi’s website."
