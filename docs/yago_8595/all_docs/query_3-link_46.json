        "meta_description": "In France between the World Wars, artists and intellectuals reflected on the mission of cinema, and their ideas helped to legitimate the nascent art form not only in aesthetic and cultural terms but socially as well. With his column in the Communist newspaper L’Humanité, Léon Moussinac was certainly one of the most influential figures in this process. So much so, that a close reading of his articles and an examination of his activities and convictions, places in question the accepted view of cinema during this period. By analyzing his writings and his activities within the party’s cultural organizations, this article demonstrates that they were consistently informed by a conception of film as a mass art form. Film is understood as a medium that may be employed to acculturate and educate the great mass of the population, a view which underscores the kinship between activities that are generally considered distinct from one another: militant cinema and cultural activism.",

        "text": "Film: Seventh Art or Mass Medium?\n\nFilm and Cultural Democratization: Amateurs and Professionals\n\n8Moussinac participated fully in activities that sought to use film to educate the public as well as to advance the cause of cultural democracy. However, the idea of a truly popular cinema, one realized and produced by the people themselves, independently of the dictates of industry or business, was not without its problems. Indeed, the very notion of such a cinema was paradoxical, since its component terms were so starkly contradictory. Because of their inexperience, members of the working class needed to be trained and supervised by cultural professionals who tended to belong to the middle or upper middle classes; the works produced had to satisfy standards that had been established by artistic elites, and were thus foreign to the new filmmakers. In order to encourage the rise of a cinema that would truly belong to the people, its promoters had, simultaneously, to educate the people in the subtleties of cinematic language, procure the funding needed for making films, and also reconsider the modes of evaluation. For this reason, they agreed to privilege the actions, the process of apprenticeship, rather than the oeuvres – that is, education rather than culture – since, due to a lack of expertise or funding, the films themselves did not meet the prevailing standards. All of these factors help to explain why, in a relatively short period of time, less than a decade, so many organizations came and went, each with a different name but with their objectives and individuals supporting them remaining constant.\n\n11The gradual transformation of the party’s film organizations during the 1930s reflects the shifting of roles between amateurs and professionals, workers and members of the middle class, and also Moussinac’s ability to rally around him individuals who were passionate about cinema and concerned with social equality. With Ciné-Liberté, the party’s cinematography division underwent a reorganization that gave leadership positions to prominent figures who were known for their work in commercial fictional feature films, and whose political commitments symbolized the rallying of left-wing forces. Germaine Dulac, an activist within the SFIO (Section Française de l’Internationale Ouvrière), was at Moussinac’s side at the Ciné-Club de France. Interested in educational cinema, she was president of the Fédération Française des Ciné-Clubs. Together with Marceau Pivert, she also led a film organization called Mai 36, which had similar aims. The Radical Socialists also joined the movement in the person of Jean Benoit-Lévy. This filmmaker, a convert to the cause of educational cinema, had known Moussinac since the 1920s. His company was housed in the offices of Paul Lafitte, who published the works of Louis Delluc and Jean Epstein for Éditions de la Sirène. For Ciné-Liberté, Jean Benoit-Lévy made Les Bâtisseurs (The Builders), a film produced for the Fédération Nationale des Travailleurs du Bâtiment (National Federation of Construction Workers), and directed by Jean Epstein.\n\nCinéphilie and Cultural Activism\n\nPopular Filmmaking and Militant Film\n\n20The ‘actualités populaires,’ which include Le Grand Prix Cycliste de L’Humanité (1935), Le Défilé des 500,000 Manifestants (1935), Grèves d’Occupations (1936), Garches 1936 (1936), Le 9ème Prix Cycliste de L’Humanité (1936), and Magazine Populaire No 1 (1938), represent a substantial portion of the corpus. The credits of these films reflect the various organizations involved in making them: Le Défilé des 500,000 Manifestants mentions the AEAR and indicates that it was produced with the assistance of the Service Cinématographique of the SFIO ; Le 9ème Prix Cycliste de L’Humanité opens with a title reading ‘Ciné-Liberté (ACI).’ With respect to the images themselves, one has the sense that they were shot by amateur cameramen, while the editing was done by more seasoned filmmakers, for example Jacques Lemare, who is credited as the director of Grèves d’Occupations and who wrote the column on 16 mm, an amateur format, in the bulletin of Ciné-Liberté. Grèves d’Occupations is unusual in that it offers a close-up look at the daily lives of striking employees and workers, using images shot on location.\n\n24The ‘documents,’ or documentaries, no doubt include the films commissioned by the unions’ various sections. Sur les Routes d’Acier (Boris Peskine, 1937) was made for the Fédération des Travailleurs des Chemins de Fer, Les Bâtisseurs (Jean Epstein, 1938) for the Fédération Nationale des Travailleurs du Bâtiment, and Les Métallos (Jacques Lemare, 1938) for the Union Syndicale des Ouvriers Métallurgistes. Also included in this category are the montage films depicting the difficulties faced by the Spanish people – Victoire de la Vie and Espagne Vivra (Henri Cartier-Bresson, 1936 and 1938), Espagne 1937 (Luis Buñuel/Jean-Paul Dreyfus/Le Chanois, 1937) – and the films devoted to news of the party, for example, La Grande Espérance (Jacques Becker, 1937), which dealt with the 1937 French Communist Party conference at Arles. These films, which were credited to prominent film professionals, are formal hybrids. They are primarily based on montage, combining amateur images shot at demonstrations, fictional scenes performed by non-professional actors, speeches by political figures, and sequences of illustrative images organized on the model of the Soviet aesthetic of montage. It is also worth noting that most of them culminate in a sequence involving a crowd – that is, the people – assembled for marches or demonstrations.\n\n25Thus, despite their being credited to professional filmmakers, the films accord a prominent place to amateurs and dwell at length on the working class. The credits for the Bâtisseurs, for example, indicate that the ‘two workers’ who retrace the history of building construction are played by ‘unemployed construction workers.’ In Les Métallos: ‘The characters of the workers are played by comrades from the union / The choral numbers were executed by the children of the Vouzeron colony and the little Spanish refugees.’ The presence of the working class – workers as actors and trade unionists playing themselves – ensures an authenticity not only of the spoken words but also of the characterizations. The viewers are not only able to identify with the characters, whom they resemble, but also with the various media depicted; in Les Métallos, for example, workers can be seen attentively reading communist magazines and newspapers, including Regards, Ce Soir, and L’Humanité.\n\n28Here too, the reference to L’Humanité is central, both legitimating and organizing the narrative structure of the film. After being shown a building façade on which we recognize the newspaper’s nameplate, we see Marcel Cachin, the paper’s director, opening mail sent in by readers, letters whose content goes on to provide the subject matter for the following scenes. The authenticity of the sketches is thus ensured, since they are inspired by the reports of the rabcors or worker correspondents, that is, by amateurs.\n\nMilitant Cinema and Cultural Activism: Questions for Film Historiography\n\n30When French and foreign researchers have studied the communist militant cinema of the interwar years, they have tended to limit their reflections to the 1930s, focusing on the films themselves, most of which were produced after 1932. Because they split the period in this manner, they fail to appreciate the critical role of Léon Moussinac in the emergence of communist filmmaking; in keeping with the party’s policy of openness and broad left-wing solidarity, he left it to others to personify a movement that was nonetheless defined and organized by him. This, coupled with his ‘disappearance’ as an author – his articles and statements were attributed to others – has led the majority of commentators to downplay the role of the Communist Party and to characterize the filmmaking groups as ‘left-wing’ organizations, failing to notice their close links to the newspaper L’Humanité. The fact that after the war the actors of the time were compelled by the Cold War to conceal their communist convictions also helped to minimize the party’s involvement. It is also worth noting that most researchers have judged the films by the standard of commercial fictional features and have thus regarded the short films by artistic, cooperative, or noncommercial groups as ‘ersatz’ productions or crude experiments.\n\n31Having borrowed their aesthetic criteria from the realms of art and literature, these researchers acknowledge the collegial activities of filmmakers, actors, and authors, such as the experiments of the theatrical group Octobre. What is missing, however, is the recognition of the collaboration between amateurs and professionals or filmmakers and photographers, all committed to recording historical reality. The participation of prominent figures like Jacques Becker and Henri Cartier-Bresson (though their works were not actually recognized until after the Second World War) has led most of these interpreters to underestimate the collaborative nature of the movement, thereby erasing the amateurs from the picture when, in fact, their participation in the process was critical; it confirmed the success of an endeavor whose goal was precisely to be ‘popular.’\n\n32When we consider the context in its historicity – that is to say, the entire period, from the 1920s through the 1930s – we rediscover the intellectual legitimations that made the production of filmic works possible. By following the writings and activities of Léon Moussinac, we rediscover a path of reflection on film itself and its social aims, aims that are inherent in its nature as a mass medium. In the process, it emerges that the contributions of the Communist Party were not confined to the making of films alone; on the contrary, they were an integral part of operations of cultural democratization that also encompassed other artistic practices such as theater and photography, and which, in the case of film, included efforts to educate the public in the art of filmmaking.\n\n33Thus, communist militant cinema as expressed between the wars – with its combined attention to culture and education, with both the making of films and screenings – came very close to being a form of cultural activism. It belonged simultaneously to the categories of educational, amateur, and art film, without any one of these practices coming to dominate the others. As such, film of this period forms part of a larger historical trajectory, one that legitimates noncommercial uses of the medium by linking them up to the humanist ideals of knowledge and education that led up to the French Revolution. It also shows that the conventional periodization which regards the Second World War as a historical divide is inappropriate when one turns one’s attention to social practices involving film, since from the 1920s to (at least) the 1960s the medium of film was used for purposes of social education.\n\n34The author wishes to thank Catherine Bensadek of the Service des Archives du Parti Communiste and Sébastien Layerle and Julie Cazenave of Ciné-Archives, the audiovisual archives of the Communist Party."
