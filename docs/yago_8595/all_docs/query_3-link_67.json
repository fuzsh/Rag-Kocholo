        "text": "France has been making films since the beginning of the medium. What constitutes the first “film” is a surprisingly debated topic. However, the Lumière brothers hosted the first public projection with a Cinematograph in late 1895. Since then, France has become the sixth largest film industry in terms of the number of films produced and box office. And possibly more notably, they have established an aesthetic and impressive film history. French film can feel daunting. While most Americans think about “art cinema” when they think of French film, France produces everything from comedy to romance to drama movies every year. Throw in some film noirs, war movies, and a heavy helping of the French New Wave, and you will have an idea of the breadth of French cinema. However, the best French movies stand apart from the heard, and this list is a perfect primer to delve into the greatest French movies of all time.\n\nTop French Movies\n\nThe highest-grossing film in French History is, curiously, an American film: Titanic. However, the highest-grossing French Movie, Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis, is not featured on this list. Instead, it features films from legendary directors like Jean Renoir, François Truffaut, Agnes Varda, Jean-Luc Godard and more.\n\nWhile this list considers factors like importance, influence and film history, it prioritizes the actual merit of the film. This list also excludes short films (sorry to La Jetée, Africa on the Seine, Un Chien Andalo and A Trip to the Moon.) It also features films co-produced by France and other countries, which is fairly common in the French film industry. It should also be said that this list is from an American perspective and by a writer who does not speak French. However, you don’t need to speak French to enjoy the films on this list.\n\n30. The Clouds of Sils Maria (2014)\n\nA co-production between France, Germany and Switzerland, The Clouds of Sils Maria follows an aging actress as she agrees to return to the revival of the play that launched her career. The film drips with tension, sexual and otherwise and stars Juliette Binoche, Kristen Stewart, and Chloë Grace Moretz.\n\nWhile the film lost the Best Film César to another tremendous French co-production, Timbuktu, Stewart notably won for Best Supporting Actress, making her the first American to win a César Award. The film currently holds a 91% on Rotten Tomatoes. It is currently streaming for free on Pluto TV and The Roku Channel.\n\n29. Raw (2016)\n\nJulia Ducournau’s Raw is not for the squeamish. However, for audiences with a strong stomach, it is a must-watch along with her follow-up 2021’s Titane. Raw follows a vegetarian who develops a taste for human flesh while in school for veterinary medicine.\n\nStarring Garance Marillier and Ella Rumpf, the film premiered at Cannes to rave reviews. Rolling Stone’s David Fear called it \"a contender for best horror movie of the decade.” It is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n28. Persepolis (2007)\n\nBased on Marjane Satrapi’s graphic memoir of the same name, Persepolis is about Satrapi’s life after the Iranian revolution. Directed by Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud, the film retains much of the bold black-and-white style of the graphic memoir.\n\nPersepolis premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, winning the Jury Prize. It was also nominated for Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards. The film holds a 96% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film is available to stream on YouTube TV.\n\n27. The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972)\n\nLuis Buñuel’s The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie is a surrealist dramedy about friends who repeatedly gather for a dinner party that is continuously interrupted. Buñuel’s work is often notably inaccessible; however, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie is exceptionally watchable.\n\nVincent Canby said in a contemporary review, “The Discreet Charm moves with the breathtaking speed and self-assurance that only a man of Buñuel's experience can achieve without resorting to awkward ellipsis.” The film won the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in 1973 and was also nominated for Best Original Screenplay. The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie is streaming with premium subscription on The Roku Channel and Amazon Prime.\n\n26. A Prophet (2009)\n\nA Prophet follows a young Algerian prisoner’s rise to the top of a crime syndicate. The film won the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language and nine Césars.\n\nThe film stars Tahar Rahim and was directed by Jacques Audiard. Seongyong Cho said of the film in a review for RogerEbert.com, “In addition to being Audiard’s best work to date, A Prophet is a top-notch genre piece which distinguishes itself with its deft storytelling and an impeccable performance.” The film is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Amazon Prime and Apple TV.\n\n25. La Haine (1995)\n\n\"La haine attire la haine!\" Starring Vincent Cassel, Hubert Koundé and Saïd Taghmaoui, La Haine follows the aftermath of police brutality and the arrest of a young Arab man as a riot breaks out in the suburbs of Paris. The film is notable for its grit, comedy, watchability and anti-fascist messaging.\n\nDirected by Mathieu Kassovitz, La Haine is raw and doesn’t shy away from critiquing 1990s French society. As part of a retrospective post-BLM, the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw said of the film, “La Haine is an unmissable response to an unending emergency.” The film currently holds a 96% on Rotten Tomatoes. La Haine is available to rent on Amazon Prime and Apple TV.\n\n24. Mon Oncle (1958)\n\nOne of two films on this list by Jacques Tati, Mon Oncle follows Tati’s character, Monsieur Hulot, as he connects with his nephew. Like much of Tati’s work, the film takes a comedic look at modern consumerism and leans heavily on visuals and ambiance to make its points.\n\nWhile his later movie, Playtime, is Tati’s true masterpiece, Mon Oncle is his most awarded. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film as well as a Special Prize from the Cannes Film Festival. Tati’s approach to comedy and filmmaking was so precise and informed by perfectionism that films like Mon Oncle transcend time and language barriers (especially since the film doesn’t rely on dialogue for its laughs.) It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n23. La Belle et la Bête (1946)\n\nWhile the animated Disney version is better known by American audiences, Jean Cocteau’s La Belle et la Bête or Beauty and the Beast, is a French cinematic classic. The film is an adaption of Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont’s 1700s story Beauty and the Beast. The story follows a damsel whose love can save a cursed prince.\n\nLa Belle et la Bête is full of extravagantly dark visuals that capture the magic and romance of the source material. For 1946, and arguably today, the practical effects of this film are impressive. La Belle et la Bête feels often feels more like art than a “movie.” It is currently streaming for free on Tubi.\n\n22. Beau Travail (1999)\n\nClaire Denis’s Beau Travail tells the story of a Foreign Legion officer, his time in the Gulf of Djibouti and the perils of jealousy. The film isn’t only arrestingly beautiful, but it also examines the nature of power.\n\nGirish Shambu wrote in a contemporary review, “Beau Travail is, on the one hand, a cerebral film: its narrative is rigorously minimal, it features little expository dialogue, and its elegant ellipses sustain a state of mystery. But at the same time, it is a film with an audiovisual intensity that stirs the senses.” The film has maintained its popularity amongst critics and cinephiles. It was most recently ranked as the 7th best movie of all time by Sight and Sound critic's poll in 2022. The film is currently streaming on Max.\n\n21. My Life as a Courgette (2016)\n\nAlso sometimes called My Life as a Zucchini, My Life as a Courgette is one of several co-productions on this list. The French-Swiss stop-motion animation is about a young boy’s childhood in an orphanage. The film balances themes of abandonment and belonging with colorful whimsy.\n\nThe film boasts a 99% on Rotten Tomatoes and won two César Awards for Best Animated Film and Best Adapted Screenplay. The film was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. It is currently streaming on The Criterion Channel.\n\n20. The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928)\n\nWhile most modern viewers aren’t running to watch a silent period drama, The Passion of Joan of Arc is a French film masterpiece. Directed by Danish Master filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer, the film is based on the trial record of Joan of Arc.\n\nWhile the film is silent, it feels oddly modern. Much of the emotion is portrayed with close-ups, and the acting is still arresting almost 100 years later. The film has appeared on many best-of lists, including those from the BBC and Cahiers du Cinéma. Roger Ebert wrote of the movie in 1997, “You cannot know the history of silent film unless you know the face of Renee Maria Falconetti. In a medium without words, where the filmmakers believed that the camera captured the essence of characters through their faces, to see Falconetti in Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928) is to look into eyes that will never leave you.” The film is in the public domain and can be found online.\n\n19. Rififi (1955)\n\nRififi is a French film noir about an aging jewel thief who tries to pull off a heist with help from other European gangsters. Directed by Jules Dassin, the film stars Jean Servais, Robert Hossein, Magali Noël and Janine Darcey.\n\nWhile Dassin was blacklisted in Hollywood after being outed as a former communist, Rififi was well-received even in the U.S. The film was also, however, controversial due to a nearly silent half-hour scene that is arguably too realistic in its approach to robbery. Many worried the film would teach viewers a little too much about how to rob a store. Unfortunately, the film is currently not available on streaming.\n\n18. I Lost My Body (2019)\n\nI Lost My Body is an animated horror drama by director Jérémy Clapin. The film follows a severed hand through Paris as it tries to find its body: a Moroccan delivery boy who lost it in a carpentry accident.\n\nThe film is viscerally disturbing at times, but it also sensitively examines community, love and displacement. Based on the novel Happy Hand by Guillaume Laurant, it premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival Critics’ Week and was the first animated film to win the Nespresso Grand Prize. I Lost My Body went on to win two César Awards and be nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. It is currently available on Netflix.\n\n17. The Artist (2011)\n\nMany may not know that 2011’s The Artist is a French film because it is silent and won the Oscar for Best Picture rather than Best International Feature Film. The Artist is a love letter to silent film and classic Hollywood and follows a familiar plot of a veteran actor falling for an ingénue while one of their star’s fades while the other’s rises.\n\nThe Artist, directed by Michel Hazanavicius, stars Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo. It was nominated for ten César Awards and ten Oscars. At one point, it was the most-awarded French film of all time (currently, it is 2023’s Anatomy of a Fall). It is available on YouTube TV.\n\n16. The Wages of Fear (1953)\n\nNot to be confused with the 2024 remake of the same name, 1953’s The Wages of Fear is a masterclass in suspense. Directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot, the film follows a group of Europeans hired to drive nitroglycerin over a dangerous South American route.\n\nWhile not everything ages perfectly, the film currently has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In 1992, Roger Ebert said of it, “The film's extended suspense sequences deserve a place among the great stretches of cinema.\" It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n15. Amélie (2001)\n\nAmélie is a French juggernaut. The film introduced many to the world of French cinema, It was a run-away box office success both in France and Internationally. The adorably quirky romantic comedy stars Audrey Tautou as a shy waitress who decides to improve the lives of those around her.\n\nDirected by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Amélie was nominated for five Academy Awards and won four César Awards. The film is as visually appealing as it is sweet. The BBC has called it the “most stylish film ever made,” and how French is that? It is currently streaming for free on Amazon Prime.\n\n14. The Rules of the Game (1939)\n\nJean Renoir’s dramedy-of-manners, The Rules of the Game, follows a web of interconnected marital affairs that comes to a head during a hunting trip to an aristocratic Château. The Rules of the Game was possibly too ahead of its time in 1939 and was met with poor reviews. However, the film was included on Sight & Sound’s Greatest Films list in 1952.\n\nThe film’s original negatives were destroyed in allied bombings and lost or partially lost until a restoration was carried out in 1956. The restoration was screened at the 1959 Venice Film Festival, where it was heralded as a masterpiece. Director Satyajit Ray famously called it \"a film that doesn't wear its innovations on its sleeve ... Humanist? Classical? Avant-Garde? Contemporary? I defy anyone to give it a label. This is the kind of innovation that appeals to me.” It. is available on YouTube, Google Play, Amazon Prime and Apple TV.\n\n13. Eyes Without a Face (1960)\n\nWhen most think of French films, horror is rarely the first thought. However, there are a couple of notable great French scary movies. The best is arguably Eyes Without a Face (though others like Diabolique and 1932’s Vampyr also come to mind). Based on a novel by the same name, Eyes Without a Face was directed by Georges Franju and starred Pierre Brasseur and Alida Valli.\n\nThe film follows a doctor driven to madness after his daughter was disfigured in a car accident and his attempts to get her a new face. The plot feels perfectly B-movie, but the film feels much more poetic in moments. The film has influenced other directors like Jesús Franco, John Carpenter and Pedro Almodóvar. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n12. Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1976)\n\nArguably, this film possibly shouldn’t appear on a French film list as it was made in Brussels by a Belgian filmmaker with a $120,000 grant from the Belgian government. However, the film was a French and Belgian co-production and has topped other best French film lists.\n\nJeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles is a slice-of-life drama by auteur filmmaker Chantal Ackerman about a housewife. The film is a masterpiece of the slow cinema genre for its static camerawork and notably long takes. It has also become a cult classic, and in 2022, Sight & Sound named it the greatest film of all time. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n11. Black Girl (1966)\n\nBlack Girl is sometimes called the first Sub-Saharan film by an African director to gain international recognition. However, it is a French-Senegalese production. While Black Girl isn’t the only film featuring black actors and stories from this period of French Film history (Black Orpheus, Story of a Three-Day Pass and Africa on the Seine, to name a few), it is among the best.\n\nDirected by Ousmane Sembène, the film follows a young Senegalese woman who comes to work in France only to be mistreated by her employers. The film was originally met with poor reviews but has been revisited and heralded as a classic. In an essay for Criterion, Ashley Clark writes, “[the film] can be understood as the product of a lifetime of negotiating challenging power relations.” It is currently streaming on Max with subscription or on Plex for free.\n\n10. Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019)\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire follows an 18th-century love affair between a female portrait painter and an unhappy bride-to-be on a small French Island. The film is heartbreaking and beautiful, exploring art, the female gaze and unspoken love.\n\nWhile other Céline Sciamma films like Girlhood and Tomboy are fabulous, Portrait of a Lady on Fire is her best work to date. It won the Queer Palm at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival and received a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. It is currently available on Hulu.\n\n9. Le Samouraï (1967)\n\nJean-Pierre Melville’s Le Samouraï is a crime thriller about a hitman who must evade police and his own crime bosses after a hit on a nightclub owner. The film stars Alain Delon, Nathalie Delon, Cathy Rosier and François Périer.\n\nThe film has been wildly influential on the action/hitman genre and currently holds a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film is both understated and chic. Variety’s Peter Debruge once said Le Samouraï “might be the coolest film ever made.” A 4K restoration of the film by Pathé and the Criterion Collection from the 35 mm original camera negative was recently completed and screened in 2024. The film is currently streaming for free on Tubi.\n\n8. L’Atalante (1934)\n\nL’Atalante is the last film made by ​​Jean Vigo before his death from tuberculosis at age 29 in 1934. While Virgo only made four films in his four-year filmmaking career, his work shaped not only poetic realism but also the history of French cinema. L’Atalante is his best work.\n\nL’Atalante follows a young woman and her new barge captain husband on a trip down the Seine aboard his boat. However, his new bride grows restless and flirtatious aboard the L’Atalante. The film was largely forgotten before becoming a favorite film of French New Wave directors. François Truffaut said of the film, \"When I entered the theater, I didn't even know who Jean Vigo was. I was immediately overwhelmed with wild enthusiasm for his work.\" The film went on to be referenced in films like Last Tango in Paris, Les Amants du Pont-Neuf and In Praise of Love. Since the 1960s it has been found on Best of Film lists. It is currently available to rent on Amazon Prime and Apple TV.\n\n7. The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964)\n\nThis French New Wave Opera is an unlikely masterpiece. The Umbrellas of Cherbourg follows two star-crossed lovers in the city of Cherbourg in Normandy. Written and directed by Jacques Demy, the film stars Catherine Deneuve and Nino Castelnuovo.\n\nThe film won the Palme d'Or at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival. Demy would go on to direct another iconic French musical, The Young Ladies of Rochefort, in 1967, which also starred Catherine Deneuve. While both films are well worth a watch, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg has become a favorite of other filmmakers. Both Damien Chazelle and Greta Gerwig have cited The Umbrellas of Cherbourg as an influence for their films La La Land and Barbie, respectively. The film is currently streaming on Max.\n\n6. Les Enfants du Paradis (1945)\n\nLes Enfants du Paradis has been called the French “Gone with the Wind,” and director François Truffaut once said of the film, \"I would give up all my films to have directed Les Enfants du Paradis.” The film is a sweeping romance that follows an actress pursued by four suitors: an actor, a criminal, a count, and a mime. Directed by Marcel Carné, the film stars Arletty, Jean-Louis Barrault, Pierre Brasseur, Marcel Herrand and Pierre Renoir.\n\nThe film’s production is almost as notable as the film itself. It was uniquely produced under war conditions in Vichy France and Occupied France. Due to Nazi-era laws about the length of films that could be shown, the film had to be made in two parts, and Jewish members of the production team, including the composer and designer, had to work on the film in secret. Les Enfants du Paradis is available to rent on Amazon Prime.\n\n5. Hiroshima Mon Amour (1959)\n\nThe rare French and Japanese co-production, Alain Resnais’ Hiroshima mon amour, is a nonlinear film featuring long conversations and flashbacks. It tells the story of a Japanese architect and French actress’s love affair and the destruction of the Atomic Bomb.\n\nAn icon of the French New Wave, Hiroshima mon amour wasn’t the first New Wave film to use a nonconventional narrative setup (Resnais’ work on Agnès Varda’s 1954 film La Pointe Courte even inspired the nonlinear plot). However, it is one of the best examples of this type of filmmaking. Kent Jones wrote of the film for Criterion, “It’s difficult to quantify the breadth of Hiroshima’s impact. It remains one of the most influential films in the short history of the medium, first of all because it liberated moviemakers from linear construction.” It is currently available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Amazon and Apple TV.\n\n4. Cléo From 5 to 7 (1962)\n\nCléo From 5 to 7 is a classic of the French New Wave. Directed by Agnès Varda, Cléo From 5 to 7 follows a young singer for two hours on a day when she is waiting for the results of a biopsy screening for stomach cancer.\n\nThe film stars Corinne Marchand and notably includes cameos from Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Claude Brialy. The film is intense in its intimacy and perspective while still having an undercurrent of almost black humor. Molly Haskell wrote of the film for Criterion, “It is an odyssey that, like so many French films, is about the double delight of watching a beautiful woman against the backdrop of the most beautiful of cities, but it is also a spiritual journey from blindness to awareness, and from self- absorption to the possibility of love.” It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n3. Playtime (1967)\n\nDirected by, co-written and starring Jacques Tati, Playtime is connected to his other earlier films, 1953’s Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot and 1958’s Mon Oncle. However, it is the best and most impactful of the three. The film follows Monsieur Hulot as he bumbles through a complex and modern Paris and intersects with an American tourist.\n\nPlaytime was incredibly expensive to make for its time. It was shot on high-resolution 70mm film and on a large, constructed set. Playtime feels like Chaplin for the modern man while still being notably beautiful. It. is currently available to rent on Amazon Prime and Apple TV.\n\n2. The 400 Blows (1959)\n\nThe 400 Blows is one of the most influential French films of all time. Directed by François Truffaut, this coming-of-age New Wave classic is a favorite film of directors like Steven Spielberg, Richard Linklater, Norman Jewison, Wes Anderson, and Akira Kurosawa.\n\nThe 400 Blows follows a rebellious young boy misunderstood by his parents. The film is semi-autobiographical and loosely based on Truffaut's childhood. While many Truffaut films could have made this list, including Day for Night, The Last Metro and especially Jules and Jim, The 400 Blows is amongst his best, if not his best. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n1. Breathless (1960)\n\nArguably, master director Jean-Luc Godard’s best film, Breathless or À bout de souffle, is not only one of the best French films ever made; it is simply one of the best films ever made. The film stars Jean Seberg and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Breathless follows a low-level criminal and his girlfriend after he impulsively kills a policeman.\n\nWhile other of Godard’s films, such as Contempt and Masculin Féminin, are masterpieces, Breathless stands apart for its influence. The film helped establish the French New Wave style and popularized new techniques in directing, such as the unique use of jump cuts. The film has been referenced in numerous other movies and is a true icon of the New Wave. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFrance has an impressive legacy in film history. While these films are must-watches, this list only scratches the surface of the many excellent films that have come out of France."
