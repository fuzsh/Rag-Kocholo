        "text": "Overview of the events of 1934 in film\n\nList of years in film\n\n+...\n\nThe following is an overview of 1934 in film, including significant events, a list of films released and notable births and deaths.\n\nThe top ten 1934 released films by box office gross in North America are as follows:\n\nHighest-grossing films of 1934 Rank Title Distributor Domestic rentals 1 Kid Millions United Artists $2,000,000[1] 2 Cleopatra Paramount $1,929,161[2] 3 Forsaking All Others MGM $1,399,000[3] 4 It Happened One Night Columbia $1,366,000[4] 5 Chained MGM $1,301,000[3] 6 Wonder Bar Warner Bros./First National $1,264,000[5] 7 The Barretts of Wimpole Street MGM $1,258,000[3] 8 Here Comes the Navy Warner Bros. $1,183,000[5] 9 Judge Priest Fox Film $1,176,000[4] 10 Treasure Island MGM $1,164,000[3]\n\nJanuary 26 – Samuel Goldwyn (formerly of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) purchases the film rights to The Wonderful Wizard of Oz from the L. Frank Baum estate for $40,000.\n\nFebruary 19 – Bob Hope marries Dolores Reade.\n\nApril 19 – Fox Studios releases Stand Up and Cheer!, with five-year-old Shirley Temple in a relatively minor role. Shirley steals the film and Fox, which had been near bankruptcy, finds itself owning a goldmine.\n\nMay 18 – Paramount releases Little Miss Marker, with Shirley Temple, on loan from Fox, in the title role.\n\nJune 13 – An amendment to the Production Code establishes the Production Code Administration, and requires all films to obtain a certificate of approval before being released.\n\nJuly 28 – Canadian-born actress Marie Dressler, best known for starring in films such as Min and Bill and Emma, dies from cancer in Santa Barbara, California at the age of 65. For her performance in Min and Bill, Dressler received the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nOctober 19 – Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers wham audiences again with their first joint starring roles in The Gay Divorcee, grossing $1.8 million[6] to add to the $1.5 million[6] earned by Flying Down to Rio released at the end of 1933.\n\nNovember 12 – The musical Babes in Toyland debuts, starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy as comic relief.\n\nDecember 11 – Fox releases the Sol M. Wurtzel production of Bright Eyes, starring their hot new property, Shirley Temple. Shirley sings \"On the Good Ship Lollipop\", and wins the first Academy Award ever given to a child, for her endearing portrayal of Shirley Blake.\n\nMain article: 7th Academy Awards\n\nThe 7th Academy Awards was held on February 27, 1935, at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. They were hosted by Irvin S. Cobb. For the first time, the Academy standardized the practice – still in effect, notwithstanding changes to the 93rd and 94th Academy Awards as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic – that the award eligibility period for a film would be the preceding calendar year.\n\nMost nominations: One Night of Love (Columbia Pictures) – 6\n\nMajor Awards\n\nBest Picture: It Happened One Night – Columbia Pictures\n\nBest Director: Frank Capra – It Happened One Night\n\nBest Actor: Clark Gable – It Happened One Night\n\nBest Actress: Claudette Colbert – It Happened One Night\n\nMost Awards: It Happened One Night – 5\n\nIt Happened One Night became the first film to perform a \"clean sweep\" of the top five award categories: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Screenplay. This feat would later be duplicated by One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 1976 and The Silence of the Lambs in 1992. It also was the first romantic comedy to be named Best Picture.\n\nUnited States unless stated\n\nJanuary 1934\n\n6 January\n\nThe Big Shakedown\n\n19 January\n\nFrontier Marshal\n\n22 January\n\nThe
