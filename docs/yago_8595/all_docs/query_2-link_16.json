        "text": "My shorter-than-usual trip to Il Cinema Ritrovato saw me hit the wall of exhaustion in record time, so that nearly everything I went to on my second full day saw me falling almost asleep. So we began with THE ROARING TWENTIES, which you just CAN’T sleep through but I found I could lose focus successfully. But I did pick up on one previously-unnoticed (by me) element — the way Bogart’s bad guy keeps saying lines that read like rough sketches for “Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world…” Umberto Eco would take encouragement from that, as proof that CASABLANCA really IS a sort of compendium of movie lines and situations.\n\nI stayed more or less awake for THE SNAKE PIT, which I adore. And no film festival can be really complete without a movie that reduces one to a snivelling wreck.\n\nBut then Jacques Feyder’s PENSION MIMOSAS took me to my limit: I couldn’t sleep during it, and I could follow it OK, but I couldn’t CARE. Not, I think the film’s fault, just my tired brain running out shits to give. So I bailed on it. Sorry, Jacques.\n\nI had a seat booked for COEUR DE LILAS (Anatole Litvak again) but I let some other bum sit in it while I recovered what passes for my mojo. I learned later from eyewitnesses that the film is still unrestored, the same faded print I saw at the Lumiere Festival, so taking some time out to recover was a wise investment of time, terrific though the movie is.\n\nIt enabled me to be in top condition for PEPE LE MOKO, which I hadn’t seen in decades, I fear. So I got my Gabin fix. A pristine restoration of a staggering film, and yes, again I could see more connections with CASABLANCA, and not just in the casting of Dalio.\n\nAfter that, social events took over from film-viewing. This meant I couldn’t see PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID that night — so I saw it this morning. More on that next time.\n\nAll serials reach a point in the middle where every episode is basically a lot of running around. Creeping down corridors, chasing, getting captured and escaping. John Barth says that the middle of the story simultaneously brings on the ending and retards it: in a serial the latter process predominates. After all, this “film”, BARRABAS, has not three acts but twelve (actually thirteen).\n\nChap. 3 contains: abductions, impersonations, thefts, escapes, brawls, lonely villa parkour, burglary, bicycling, and cheese.\n\nFeuillade’s cast continues to be on point. His comedian Biscot, as Biscotin the creamer, gets a lot of good business in this one. I don’t recall this much comedy in JUDEX or LES VAMPIRES. It does indicate a certain patrician attitude in Feuillade’s world-view, that the working class character is comical while the upper-middle class journalist and aristocratic lawyer are always played straight. On the one hand, Biscotin isn’t an idiot, he’s just as effective a hero as the posh dudes, he just makes (visual) jokes and is obviously not as heroically styled. On the other hand, he’s unquestioningly devoted to his social “superiors.” Feuillade’s bad guys have an attraction, of a revolutionary and subversive nature, but Biscotin’s loyalty to the status quo seems intended to demonstrate the merits of conservatism.\n\nGeorges Biscot had made his name in shorts, some directed by Jacques Feyder. His first Feuillade serial, TIH MINH, was entirely written by Louis F, so he was free to incorporate this recognisable figure. With BARRABAS, Feuillade was working with co-writer Maurice Level (great name) but again the story seems to be a screen original, so Biscot/Biscotin can easily be incorporated. Fans of Souvestre & Allain might have been discomfited by his insertion into FANTOMAS.\n\nWith the execution of the false-Rougier, Biscotin is now my rooting interest. But I am also happy to welcome into the dramatic personae a chunky henchman called “L’enflé” — translated as “the swollen” though I might prefer the more literal “the inflamed.”"
