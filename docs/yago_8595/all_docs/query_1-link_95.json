        "text": "“Spectators can walk through this ensemble as they please and create their own visit. I believe this is what attracted me to this group of works. I can choose from amongst the numerous photographs, creating an intimate relationship with them in a unique and moving experience.”\n\nFrancois Pinault\n\nBoston – Etats-Unis – 1947\n\n20170918 VNF 01D AL_VF_SELF_PORTRAIT_iPHONE_045_D - Annie Leibovitz - © Annie Leibovitz – courtesy Palazzo Grassi\n\nAnnie Leibovitz – photographer\n\nSeeing Cartier-Bresson’s Work\n\n“Seeing Cartier-Bresson’s work made me want to become a photographer… The idea that a photographer could travel with a camera to different places, see how other people lived, make looking a mission—that that could be your life was an amazing, thrilling idea.”\n\n“The first thing I did was pick out pictures that had a strong influence on my work and were indelibly etched in my mind. The ones that mean the most to me are probably the portrait of Matisse and the photograph of the picnic at the edge of the water. They are in The World of Cartier-Bresson, but I picked other pictures that are not. Over the years, other pictures have seamlessly merged with the ones I was drawn to first.”\n\nAnnie Leibovitz\n\nHenri Matisse a son domicile – Vence – France – 1944\n\n“I studied the pictures as a photographer, admiring Cartier-Bresson’s talent and his eye. An intuitive master of composition, he was out there with a small 35mm camera, working in a completely original way—framing, choosing what to include and what not to include in a picture, establishing depth and relationships.”\n\nAnnie Leibovitz\n\nIrene et Frederic Joliot-Curie – France - 1944\n\nJean-Paul Sartre - pont des Arts – Paris – France - 1946\n\nJoe, trompettiste de jazz, et sa femme May - New York, Etats-Unis, 1935\n\nEzra Pound – 1971\n\nHenri Cartier-Bresson Bougival - France, 1956 - epreuve gélatino-argentique de 1973 © Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson / Magnum Photos - courtesy Palazzo Grassi\n\n“Why these photographs? And what did the numbering system for the pictures imply? The answer that came back about the numbers was that most of the pictures were organized by country or geographical region. In any case, I used the official sequencing to pin the photographs, which I had printed the size of index cards, in rows on a wall of my studio.”\n\nAnnie Leibovitz\n\nBougival - France - 1956\n\n© Palazzo Grassi - photo by Matteo De Fina – courtesy Palazzo Grassi\n\nJavier Cercas - writer\n\nAn Imminent Revelation\n\n\"My choice was not at all based on esthetic, historic, or biographical criteria but on the sheer impact the images had on me, their simple visual force or capacity to intrigue me, in short criteria that could be considered instinctive rather than intellectual. Nevertheless, it’s true that when I was preparing the anthology, I realized that Cartier-Bresson’s work had a close, almost unhoped-for relationship with my own research, with my interests and concerns as a writer.\"\n\nProstitues - calle Cuauhtemoctzin – Mexico – 1934\n\nBrasserie Lipp - Saint-Germain-des-Pres – Paris – France - 1969\n\nAlicante - Espagne - 1933\n\nMatthieu Humery and Javier Cercas\n\n“Past is not dead. It’s not even past.”\n\nWilliam Faulkner\n\nWilliam Faulkner – Oxford – Etats-Unis – 1947\n\n“I immediately noticed an unintentional logic in my selection and I wanted to reflect that in the way the photographs were displayed in the exhibition. It is organized in the same way that I have always structured my books or music that I like—from Baroque music to rock and roll—or in other words according to repetitions and variations on the same theme, characteristics, styles, or tones that appear here and there, disappear and reappear.”\n\nJavier Cercas\n\nLourdes – France – 1958\n\n“The third point is the violence, above all the violence of war or revolution. Finally, the last point is Spanish reality, which for many had become fundamental for Cartier- Bresson since his experience of the civil war.”\n\nJavier Cercas\n\nVolcan – Popocatepetl – Mexique – 1963\n\nWim Wenders – film director\n\nAn Eye for an Eye\n\nbut in a new sense, not with that old meaning of “revenge”\n\n“I had made this selection strictly from my own gut reaction to the Master Collection that I had spread out on the floor of my studio. These thirty pictures were those that had spoken to me the most. But didn’t they represent my own personal feelings, like a mirror, rather than opening to others an “understanding” of Henri Cartier-Bresson?”\n\nHenri Cartier-Bresson – Prisoner of war – Germany - 1942\n\nWim Wenders – film still\n\n“Now I can see much better what it is that touched me! Only now do I see that all these people show themselves to me (and to you, too) today as if we were in direct touch, as if “our relation” hadn’t gone through the lens of Henri Cartier-Bresson’s Leica.”\n\nWim Wenders\n\nBruxelles – Belgique - 1932\n\n“…but the mystery is that whatever connection there was between them and him doesn’t interfere with our way, today, of seeing them. There is a directness and immediacy that we might recognize from our contemporary photographic “smartphone” practice and from all these pictures we take without thinking of them as photographs, including selfies. It’s hard to put my finger on it, but there is something in these portraits by Henri Cartier-Bresson that entirely defies the period they were taken in.”\n\nWim Wenders\n\nCantine pour les ouvriers travaillant sur la construction de l’hotel Metropol – Moscou – Russie – URSS - 1954\n\nSylvie Aubenas chez Mariage Freres - Paris 4e. Octobre – 2014 – courtesy Palazzo Grassi\n\nSylvie Aubenas - heritage conservator\n\nLife Lines - Convergence Lines\n\n‘Several things stand out in his career and distinguish him above and beyond his immense talent: his pioneering and intuitive understanding (right from the start) of the importance of exhibitions and books for a twentieth-century photographer, of organizing and reorganizing his work at crucial moments in his life and in particular eliminating images, and, finally, the categorical and concise manner with which he expressed his conception of photography. Underneath this strict,\n\nalmost rigorous sense of organization, this grand bourgeois, this well-read man, lover of painting, this man who in his texts and interviews spoke more willingly about Proust or Cezanne than photography, this elusive character who knowingly cultivated some seemingly obvious paradoxes, constructed a photographic ensemble dazzling with lightness, empathy, humanism, and humor and who, with his Leica glued to his eye, lived through more than forty years of twentieth–century and photographic history. “\n\nCoco Chanel – Paris – France - 1964\n\nVigneron – Cramont – France - 1960\n\nAlberto Giacometti - rue d’Alesia – Paris – France - 1961\n\nLivourne – Italie - 1933\n\nSylvie Aubenas chez Mariage Freres - Paris 4e. Octobre – 2014\n\n“Photo shooting. Or taking a photo if you prefer. That’s my passion. [. . .] I wasn’t interested in the result. [. . .] shooting and nothing more.”\n\nHenri Cartier-Bresson\n\nWashington DC - Etats-Unis - 1957\n\n“The more famous he became the more he expressed his distaste for fame, his total rejection of power, honors, awards, indoctrination. He proclaimed himself to be an anarchist, a libertarian, an atheist, putting his liberty and independence above all else. He expressed his taste for certain writers—Proust, Stendhal, Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Joyce, Beckett, Gracq. . . —and for painters such as Paolo Uccello, Pierre Bonnard, Matisse, Cezanne, van Eyck… He had far greater esteem for painting than photography.”\n\nSlyvie Aubenas\n\nDessau – Allemagne - mai-juin -1945\n\n“Photography is putting the head, the eye, and the heart on the same line of vision. It’s a way of living.”\n\nHenri Cartier-Bresson\n\nForteresse Pierre-et-Paul sur la rivière Neva\n\nLeningrad – Russie – URSS – 1973\n\nThe fake Leica made by Henri Cartier-Bresson’s artist friend Saul Steinberg, shown in Wim Wenders’s rooms, continues the irony and reinforces the cinematic illusion of the installation. This artefact upsets what we see and believe, similarly to an actor dressing up in a costume to play at being someone else. Cartier-Bresson would not be able to shoot anything with this Leica, a testimony to the long-standing friendship between the two creators.\n\nSaul Steinberg – Untitled – fake Leica – wood – metal - 1974"
