He also continues to inspire people across the Wikimedia movement, as with his talks at Wikimedia events and his personal celebration of each year’s new “Wikimedian of the Year” – an award that Jimmy started in 2011 to give greater recognition to our projects’ most inspiring volunteer contributors. By staying actively involved with Wikipedia and by engaging with our entire community, Jimmy evolves our projects in the best possible way: through collaboration, which has been Wikipedia’s trademark from the very beginning. Learn more about Jimmy.\n\nIn a world where information is increasingly commoditized, Wikipedia’s model has always been based on the belief that knowledge belongs to all humans."
