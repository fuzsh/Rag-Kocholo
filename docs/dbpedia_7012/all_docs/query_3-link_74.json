        "text": "by Don B. Louterfist\n\nJimbo “Jimmy” Wales, considered by many to be the “godfather” of Wikipedia, was recently stripped of advanced permissions on the site he co-founded after making false corruption allegations against one of its more respected volunteer administrators.\n\nHere’s an account of what happened.\n\nOrigins: Admin for hire (or not)\n\nIn early 2023, someone we’re calling “Person X” received a message from an unknown sender. These people haven’t been identified and the contents of this message haven’t been made public, but allegedly the sender claimed to have influence over a Wikipedia admin and could get the admin to post an article on behalf of Person X — for a fee of $15,000. (For the record, you don’t have to be an admin to post new articles on Wikipedia.)\n\nThis is a run-of-the-mill scam. The mention of a particular admin’s name in the scam message is no guarantee that the admin is involved with the scheme, or even aware of it. As for what can be done proactively in this situation, Wikipedia recommends e-mailing their “paid-editing hotline.” An inexperienced Wikipedia user might not know about this process, but maybe the site’s founder should know.\n\nEnter Jimmy “Jimbo” Wales, who was privately contacted by Person X and made aware of this message. Wales is a co-founder of Wikipedia (though he’s often claimed to be the “sole founder”), and although he hasn’t been involved in the day-to-day operations for many years, he’s still frequently contacted by people wanting to go “straight to the big boss.” His reputation among Wikipedia users is… complicated, with a variety of opinions (some very strongly-held) present on both the pro-Jimbo and anti-Jimbo sides, but it isn’t unheard-of for people (especially those who are prominent within the tech industry) to contact Jimbo directly when they encounter something on Wikipedia that might affect their business or personal reputation. So everything up to this point in the story is quite normal, and has probably happened many times over the years.\n\nBut this time, a bizarre turn of events began.\n\nJimbo demands answers!\n\nOn April 8th, 2023, the attempted scam burst into the public arena when Jimbo posted the following message on the User Talk page of a Wikipedia admin called Bradv:\n\nHave you been recommending that people use WikiExperts?\n\nI have what seems to me a credible report that you have been recommending to people that they use WikiExperts. Is this true?\n\nThe report I have is that you contacted someone through Whatsapp to recommend WikiExperts, who then charged someone $15,000 for an article in Wikipedia. I am asking you because if so, then you definitely should not be an admin in English Wikipedia. If it is a lie, then fine. But please tell me the truth.\n\nSome additional explanation about the special privileges held by Jimbo’s Wikipedia account may be helpful here. As the site’s founder, Jimbo’s account had most of the highest privileges available, potentially allowing him to block users, delete articles, suppress specific edits, and look up the IP addresses from which people are editing (or in Wiki-technical terms, “CheckUser” and “Oversight” privileges as well as Administrator rights). However, Jimbo’s role on the website in recent years has been largely that of a non-participating figurehead, representing the Wikipedia “movement” at various conferences and media appearances, not to mention speaking engagements for which he is fairly well-paid. But those activities don’t require high-level access rights, nor had he been using those rights.\n\nBradv is one of the 900-odd English Wikipedia admins, and a dormant one too, given that he hadn’t done any edits in the previous 9 months. This indicates that…\n\nThe Bradv account is unlikely to be involved in paid-editing currently, and\n\nPosting a message to Bradv’s User Talk page is unlikely to result in a response, at least not promptly, and possibly not ever.\n\nThe latter point was also reinforced by a big “This user may have left Wikipedia” message at the top of Bradv’s User Talk page.\n\nOthers question the questions\n\nJimbo’s every action is closely watched by various supporters and critics, so this substantial allegation against a relatively well-respected admin quickly gained attention. Several high-ranking users (including other admins and arbitrators) soon replied to Jimbo with concerns that could be fairly paraphrased as “What on earth are you doing??”\n\nA Wikipediocracy thread (shameless plug!) was created, and much popcorn was prepared in anticipation.\n\nAbout a day later, Jimbo’s reply included an apology “for the unnecessary tone in my inquiry,” but he also doubled down on his request for Bradv to respond as to whether he was involved in the scam. It did not go down well (scroll down to “Wow. Just wow”). Several users took to Jimbo’s own User Talk page to voice their concerns. Towards the bottom of that discussion, it was revealed that the email Jimbo provided as supporting evidence was “just a vague assertion by Jimbo” without any concrete proof of the allegations against Bradv, and that Jimbo believed the scam “victim” had indeed paid the scammer to create an article for them.\n\nOff to Wiki-court we go\n\nOn April 11th, a request was submitted to the Arbitration Committee for a case to examine Jimbo’s behaviour in the incident, and to impose sanctions if necessary. Popcorn levels were reaching new heights, since the prospect of sanctioning the remaining founder was likely to draw a lot of emotion and drama from the user community.\n\nBut two days later, just as things were heating up, Jimbo announced that he would voluntarily give up all of his advanced powers and access rights, except for the merely-ceremonial “founder” title. The Arbitration Committee case was no longer required, many vitriolic kilobytes were averted, and now Wikipedia’s founder was basically no more special than an average user.\n\nNo more veto powers\n\nBut there was one other power that Jimbo still had. One that no other user had ever had or was ever likely to get. There was a clause tucked away in the wording of the Arbitration Policy giving Jimbo the ability to overrule any decision by the Arbitration Committee, sometimes referred to as Wikipedia’s “high court.” (It’s a shaky analogy). Jimbo’s actions in this episode led people to question his judgment and wonder if it was still a good idea for him to be able to do that.\n\nChanging this via the usual methods (such as a “Village Pump” proposal) would likely be drawn-out and bitter, and would probably end in a stalemate. However, in a genius act (or shameful manoeuvre, take your pick), in early May a user invoked a process whereby the Arbitration Policy could be changed via:\n\nA petition of 100 signatures, then\n\nA referendum, which would be successful once it reached a 50% majority with at least one-hundred votes in favour.\n\nSeveral people expressed the opinion that this was not a well-thought-out process for changing the policy, but however poorly designed, that was the process, and the results would have to be considered legitimate. The petition and referendum were both successfully completed in favour of the change. Following this, a single sentence was removed from the Arbitration Policy, and the last of Wikipedia co-founder Jimbo Wales’s special powers was now gone, right along with it.\n\nSo that’s how a fairly routine scam attempt led to the co-founder of one of the world’s most-visited websites losing all of his admin rights on the site he co-founded. As mentioned earlier, he hadn’t been using those rights much, if at all, so very little (indeed, nothing) has since changed in terms of day-to-day operations. And we still don’t know who induced Jimbo to make his rather reckless accusation against Bradv, nor do we know if WikiExperts (a subsidiary of KMGi Group, a Russian-owned company based in New York whose website apparently doesn’t have an SSL certificate) was actually paid the $15,000.\n\nLastly, will tech executives and other prominent figures finally stop asking Jimbo to personally intervene when they have issues with Wikipedia and its content? You might think so, but the tech media hasn’t really covered this story. That leaves us to do it — and maybe, with our help, those tech execs will get the message and Jimbo will soon be able to read his e-mails and DMs in peace, free from the stress and anxiety of having to deal with angry businessmen he met at the World Economic Forum in Davos, or maybe some dicey “new media” symposium in Central Asia, who think he might still be “in charge over there.”\n\nGood luck to everyone involved."
