At the links provided, you can read more about each program, takeaways, speakers, and more. 1. Openness Under Pressure‚ÄîNavigating the Future of Open Access: https://loom.ly/S-Dcfuc 2. AI‚Äôs Impact on Creativity & the Commons: https://loom.ly/3YAhDjg Click on each link to vote and leave a comment on why you'd love to see these programs at #SXSW 2025. Thank you!\n\n#Wikimania by Wikimedia Foundation was amazing and we left with so many new ideas and shared moments of learning with the global community. If you'd like to catch up, you can start below with our session on the TAROCH Initiative where we discuss the value of open access to cultural heritage, co-chaired by CC and Fundacja Centrum Cyfrowe. It was a pleasure Maria Drabczyk, Fiona Romeo, Joanna Sanetra-Szeliga (UNESCO), and Ivan Martinez (R3D: Red en Defensa de los Derechos Digitales). Please watch the session here: https://loom.ly/9kduwLk.\n\nWhat can we do to foster a vibrant and healthy commons in the face of rapid technological development? And how can we ensure that creators and knowledge-producing communities still have agency? These are just some of the questions that have been at the forefront of conversations in the community in regards to #AI and the Commons. Creative Commons' CEO, Anna Tumad√≥ttir, explores questions, preference signaling, and more in our latest blog. Read: https://loom.ly/CaNsYnw.\n\nCome join CC‚Äôs legal team for open office hours. You're invited to meet with General Counsel Kat Walsh to discuss legal issues related to CC licenses, CC0, and open sharing in general. This is a casual conversation so questions, shares, and the like are welcome. RSVP here: https://loom.ly/EllhTlY.\n\nDid you see the call for translation volunteers? Two of our initiatives are looking to make specific resources available in more languages. We need your help! If you speak another language and want to support, consider signing up below: Climate Data Recommendations translation projects: https://lnkd.in/gnVUGVc7 Open Culture Resources translation projects: https://loom.ly/ZJpmWnw\n\nOver the past weeks, the CC board and team have been working behind the scenes on our strategy refresh. We are excited to share our progress as we enter the community engagement phase of the refresh and explain how you can contribute to the process. You can read more, participate in our survey, and RSVP to have real conversations with CC staff: https://loom.ly/pmd198c. We are looking forward to hearing from you.\n\nHow common is it for cultural organizations to permit the free reuse of their digitized public domain collections? Where are these materials published online, and under what conditions? The Open GLAM Survey has been looking at this for 6 years: https://loom.ly/rDymW1I\n\nThis year the Open Culture Program has already published a number of new resources, including a report on the Benefits of Open Culture and Guidelines on Institutional Referencing. This is just one of the many resources from the Open Culture Program that would have more impact if available in more languages. In 2023, our amazing volunteers translated more than 150k words into languages such as fran√ßais, Portugu√™s, italiano, and Bahasa Indonesian. So now, we need your help for 2024. Can you read and write another language? Would you like to help make these resources available in your language? Join the 2024 translation sprint today! https://loom.ly/ZJpmWnw\n\nWhat happens to the Public Domain when the works in it have restricted access or paywalls? This is the case in several countries and we wanted to talk about it with COMMUNIA. Watch the recording of the latest COMMUNIA Salon to join the conversation: https://loom.ly/Jfbq_pY."
