        "text": "Jimmy Donal Wales (born August 7, 1966), also known on Wikipedia by the nickname Jimbo Wales, is an American and British Internet entrepreneur, webmaster, and former financial trader. He is a co-founder of the online non-profit encyclopedia Wikipedia and the for-profit wiki hosting service Fandom (formerly Wikia). He has worked on other online projects, including Bomis, Nupedia, WikiTribune, and WT Social.\n\nWales was born in Huntsville, Alabama, United States, where he attended Randolph School, a university-preparatory school. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees in finance from Auburn University and the University of Alabama respectively. In graduate school, Wales taught at two universities; he departed before completing a PhD to take a job in finance and later worked as the research director of Chicago Options Associates.\n\nIn 1996, Wales and two partners founded Bomis, a web portal primarily known for featuring adult content. Bomis provided the initial funding for the free peer-reviewed encyclopedia Nupedia (2000–2003). On January 15, 2001, with Larry Sanger and others, Wales launched Wikipedia, a free open-content encyclopedia that enjoyed rapid growth and popularity. As its public profile grew, Wales became its promoter and spokesman. Though he is historically credited as a co-founder, he has disputed this, declaring himself the sole founder.\n\nWales serves on the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees, the charity that he helped establish to operate Wikipedia, holding its board-appointed \"community founder\" seat. For his role in creating Wikipedia, Time named him one of \"The 100 Most Influential People in the World\" in 2006.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nWales was born in Huntsville, Alabama, shortly before midnight on August 7, 1966; however, his birth certificate lists his date of birth as August 8. His father Jimmy Sr., worked as a grocery store manager, while his mother, Doris Ann (née Dudley), and his grandmother, Erma, ran the House of Learning, a small private school in the tradition of the one-room schoolhouse, where Wales and his three siblings received their early education.\n\nAs a child, Wales enjoyed reading. When he was three, his mother bought a World Book Encyclopedia from a door-to-door salesman. As he grew up and learned to read, it became an object of reverence, but Wales soon discovered that the World Book had shortcomings: no matter how much was in it, there were many more things that were not. World Book sent out stickers for owners to paste on the pages in order to update the encyclopedia, and Wales was careful to put the stickers to work, stating, \"I joke that I started as a kid revising the encyclopedia by stickering the one my mother bought.\"\n\nDuring an interview in 2005 with Brian Lamb, Wales described his childhood private school as a \"Montessori-influenced philosophy of education\", where he \"spent lots of hours poring over the Britannicas and World Book Encyclopedias\". There were only four other children in Wales's grade, so the school grouped together the first through fourth-grade students and the fifth through eighth-grade students. As an adult, Wales was sharply critical of the government's treatment of the school, citing the \"constant interference and bureaucracy and very sort of snobby inspectors from the state\" as a formative influence on his political philosophy.\n\nAfter eighth grade, Wales attended Randolph School, a university-preparatory school in Huntsville, graduating at sixteen. Wales said that the school was expensive for his family, but that \"education was always a passion in my household ... you know, the very traditional approach to knowledge and learning and establishing that as a base for a good life.\" He received his bachelor's degree in finance from Auburn University in 1986. He began his Auburn education when he was 16 years old. Wales then entered the PhD finance program at the University of Alabama before leaving with a master's degree to enter the PhD finance program at Indiana University. At the University of Alabama, he played Internet fantasy games and developed his interest in the web. He taught at both universities during his postgraduate studies but did not write the doctoral dissertation required for a PhD, something he ascribed to boredom.\n\nCareer\n\nChicago Options Associates and Bomis\n\nIn 1994, Wales took a job with Chicago Options Associates, a futures and options trading firm in Chicago, Illinois. Wales has described himself as having been addicted to the Internet from an early stage, writing computer code during his leisure time. During his studies in Alabama, he had become an obsessive player of Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs)—a type of virtual role-playing game—and thereby experienced the potential of computer networks to foster large-scale collaborative projects.\n\nInspired by the remarkably successful initial public offering of Netscape in 1995, and having accumulated capital through \"speculating on interest-rate and foreign-currency fluctuations\", Wales decided to leave the realm of financial trading and became an Internet entrepreneur.\n\nNupedia and the origins of Wikipedia\n\nMain article: Nupedia\n\nThough Bomis had at the time struggled to make money, it provided Wales with the funding to pursue his greater passion, an online encyclopedia. While moderating an online discussion group devoted to the philosophy of Objectivism in the early 1990s, Wales had encountered Larry Sanger, a skeptic of the philosophy. The two had engaged in detailed debate on the subject on Wales' list and then on Sanger's, eventually meeting offline to continue the debate and becoming friends. Years later, after deciding to pursue his encyclopedia project and seeking a credentialed academic to lead it, Wales hired Sanger—who at that time was a doctoral student in philosophy at Ohio State University—to be its editor-in-chief, and in March 2000, Nupedia (\"the free encyclopedia\"), a peer-reviewed, open-content encyclopedia, was launched. The intent behind Nupedia was to have expert-written entries on a variety of topics and to sell advertising alongside the entries to make a profit. The project was characterized by an extensive peer-review process designed to make its articles of a quality comparable to that of professional encyclopedias.\n\nIn an October 2009 speech, Wales recollected attempting to write a Nupedia article on Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert C. Merton, but being too intimidated to submit his first draft to the prestigious finance professors who were to peer review it, even though he had published a paper on Option Pricing Theory and was comfortable with the subject matter. Wales characterized this as the moment he realized that the Nupedia model was not going to work.\n\nIn January 2001, Sanger was introduced to the concept of a wiki by extreme programming enthusiast Ben Kovitz after explaining to Kovitz the slow pace of growth Nupedia endured as a result of its onerous submission process. Kovitz suggested that adopting the wiki model would allow editors to contribute simultaneously and incrementally throughout the project, thus breaking Nupedia's bottleneck. Sanger was excited about the idea, and after he proposed it to Wales, they created the first Nupedia wiki on January 10, 2001. The wiki was initially intended as a collaborative project for the public to write articles that would then be reviewed for publication by Nupedia's expert volunteers. The majority of Nupedia's experts, however, wanted nothing to do with this project, fearing that mixing amateur content with professionally researched and edited material would compromise the integrity of Nupedia's information and damage the credibility of the encyclopedia. Thus, the wiki project, dubbed \"Wikipedia\" by Sanger, went live at a separate domain five days after its creation.\n\nWikipedia\n\nMain article: History of Wikipedia\n\nOriginally, Bomis planned to make Wikipedia a profitable business. Sanger initially saw Wikipedia primarily as a tool to aid Nupedia development. Wales feared that, at worst, it might produce \"complete rubbish\". To the surprise of Sanger and Wales, within a few days of launching, the number of articles on Wikipedia had outgrown that of Nupedia, and a small collective of editors had formed. It was Jimmy Wales, along with other people, who came up with the broader idea of an open-source, collaborative encyclopedia that would accept contributions from ordinary people. Initially, neither Sanger nor Wales knew what to expect from the Wikipedia initiative. Many of the early contributors to the site were familiar with the model of the free culture movement, and, like Wales, many of them sympathized with the open-source movement.\n\nWales has said that he was initially so worried about the concept of open editing, where anyone can edit the encyclopedia, that he would awaken during the night and monitor what was being added. Nonetheless, the cadre of early editors helped create a robust, self-regulating community that has proven conducive to the growth of the project. In a talk at SXSW in 2016, he recalled that he wrote the first words on Wikipedia: \"Hello world\", a phrase computer programmers often use to test new software.\n\nSanger developed Wikipedia in its early phase and guided the project. The broader idea he originally ascribes to other people, remarking in a 2005 memoir for Slashdot that \"the idea of an open-source, collaborative encyclopedia, open to contribution by ordinary people, was entirely Jimmy's, not mine, and the funding was entirely by Bomis. Of course, other people had had the idea\", adding, \"the actual development of this encyclopedia was the task he gave me to work on.\" Sanger worked on and promoted both the Nupedia and Wikipedia projects until Bomis discontinued funding for his position in February 2002; Sanger resigned as editor-in-chief of Nupedia and as \"chief organizer\" of Wikipedia on March 1 of that year. Early on, Bomis supplied the financial backing for Wikipedia, and entertained the notion of placing advertisements on Wikipedia before costs were reduced with Sanger's departure and plans for a non-profit foundation were advanced instead.\n\nRole\n\nIn a 2004 interview with Slashdot, Wales outlined his vision for Wikipedia: \"Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing.\" Although his formal designation is board member and chairman emeritus of the Wikimedia Foundation, Wales's social capital within the Wikipedia community has accorded him a status that has been characterized as benevolent dictator, constitutional monarch and spiritual leader. In two interviews with The Guardian in 2014, Wales elaborated on his role on Wikipedia. In the first interview, he said that while he \"has always rejected\" the term \"benevolent dictator\", he does refer to himself as the \"constitutional monarch\". In the second, he elaborated on his \"constitutional monarch\" designation, saying that, like Queen of the United Kingdom Elizabeth II, he has no real power. He was also the closest the project had to a spokesperson in its early years. The growth and prominence of Wikipedia made Wales an Internet celebrity. Although he had never traveled outside North America before the site's founding, his participation in the Wikipedia project has seen him flying internationally on a near-constant basis as its public face.\n\nWhen Larry Sanger left Wikipedia, Wales's approach was different from Sanger's. Wales was fairly hands-off. Despite involvement in other projects, Wales has denied intending to reduce his role within Wikipedia, telling The New York Times in 2008 that \"Dialing down is not an option for me ... Not to be too dramatic about it, but, 'to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language,' that's who I am. That's what I am doing. That's my life goal.\"\n\nWikimedia Foundation\n\nIn mid-2003, Wales set up the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), a non-profit organization founded in St. Petersburg, Florida and later headquartered in San Francisco, California. All intellectual property rights and domain names about Wikipedia were moved to the new foundation, whose purpose is to support the encyclopedia and its sister projects. Wales has been a member of the Wikimedia Foundation's Board of Trustees since it was formed and was its official chairman from 2003 through 2006. Since 2006 he has been accorded the honorary title of chairman emeritus and holds the board-appointed \"community founder's seat\" that was installed in 2008. His work for the foundation, including his appearances to promote it at computer and educational conferences, has always been unpaid. Wales has often joked that donating Wikipedia to the foundation was both the \"dumbest and the smartest\" thing he had done. On one hand, he estimated that Wikipedia was worth US$3 billion but on the other hand, he weighed his belief that the donation made its success possible. In 2020, Wales said that \"I view my role as being very much like the modern monarch of the UK: no real power, but the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn.\"\n\nWikia attempted to develop a search engine but it was closed in 2009.\n\nWikia and later pursuits\n\nIn 2004, Wales and then-fellow member of the WMF Board of Trustees Angela Beesley founded the for-profit company Wikia. Wikia is a wiki farm—a collection of individual wikis on different subjects, all hosted on the same website. It hosts some of the largest wikis outside Wikipedia, including Memory Alpha (devoted to Star Trek) and Wookieepedia (Star Wars). Another service offered by Wikia was Wikia Search, an open source search engine intended to challenge Google and introduce transparency and public dialogue about how it is created into the search engine's operations, but the project was abandoned in March 2009. Wales stepped down as Wikia CEO to be replaced by angel investor Gil Penchina, a former vice president and general manager at eBay, on June 5, 2006. Penchina declared Wikia to have reached profitability in September 2009. In addition to his role at Wikia, Wales is a public speaker represented by the Harry Walker Agency. He has also participated in a celebrity endorsement campaign for the Swiss watchmaker Maurice Lacroix.\n\nOn November 4, 2011, Wales delivered an hour-long address at The Sage Gateshead in the United Kingdom to launch the 2011 Free Thinking Festival on BBC Radio Three. His speech, which was entitled \"The Future of the Internet\", was largely devoted to Wikipedia. Twenty days later, on November 24, Wales appeared on the British topical debate television program Question Time.\n\nIn May 2012, it was reported that Wales was advising the U.K. government on how to make taxpayer-funded academic research available on the internet at no cost. His role reportedly involved working as \"an unpaid advisor on crowdsourcing and opening up policymaking\", and advising the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills and the UK research councils on distributing research.\n\nIn January 2014, it was announced that Wales had joined The People's Operator as co-chair of the mobile phone network.\n\nOn March 21, 2014, Wales spoke on a panel at a Clinton Global Initiative University conference held at Arizona State University, along with John McCain, Saudi Arabian women's rights activist Manal al-Sharif and Harvard University student Shree Bose. The topic of discussion was \"the age of participation\" and the ability of an increasingly large number of citizens to \"express their own opinions, pursue their own educations, and launch their own enterprises.\" Wales exhorted young people to use social media to try to bring about societal change, and compared government suppression of the Internet to a human rights violation.\n\nOn May 26, 2014, Google appointed Wales to serve on a seven-member committee on privacy in response to Google v. Gonzalez, which led to Google's being inundated with requests to remove websites from their search results. Wales said he wanted the committee to be viewed as \"a blue-ribbon panel\" by lawmakers and for the committee to advise the lawmakers as well as Google.\n\nIn 2017, Wales announced that he was launching an online publication called WikiTribune, to fight fake news through a combination of professional journalists and volunteer contributors. Wales described it as \"news by the people and for the people\", and that it will be the \"first time that professional journalists and citizen journalists will work side-by-side as equals writing stories as they happen, editing them live as they develop, and at all times backed by a community checking and rechecking all facts\".\n\nIn October 2019, Wales launched an ad-free social network, WT Social.\n\nThe Jimmy Wales Foundation for Freedom of Expression is a UK-based charity established by Wales to fight against human rights violations in the field of freedom of expression. Wales founded the charity after receiving a prize from the leader of Dubai, which he felt he could not accept given the strict censorship laws there, but claims he was not allowed to give back. As of 2016, the charity's CEO is Orit Kopel.\n\nDevelopment and management of Wikipedia\n\nWales cites Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek's essay, \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\", which he read as an undergraduate, as \"central\" to his thinking about \"how to manage the Wikipedia project\". Hayek argued that information is decentralized—that each individual only knows a small fraction of what is known collectively—and that as a result, decisions are best made by those with local knowledge, rather than by a central authority. Wales reconsidered Hayek's essay in the 1990s while reading about the open source movement, which advocated for the collective development and free distribution of software. He was particularly moved by \"The Cathedral and the Bazaar\", an essay which was later adapted into a book of the same name, by one of the founders of the movement, Eric S. Raymond, as it \"opened [his] eyes to the possibilities of mass collaboration.\"\n\nFrom his background in finance, and working as a futures and options trader, Wales developed an interest in game theory and the effect of incentives on human collaborative activity. He identifies this fascination as a significant basis for his developmental work on the Wikipedia project. He has rejected the notion that his role in promoting Wikipedia is altruistic, which he defines as \"sacrificing your own values for others\", and he states that the idea that \"participating in a benevolent effort to share information is somehow destroying your own values makes no sense to me\".\n\nPersonal life\n\nWales has been married three times. At the age of 20, he married Pamela Green, a co-worker at a grocery store in Alabama. They divorced in 1993. He met his second wife, Christine Rohan, through a friend in Chicago while she worked as a steel trader for Mitsubishi. They were married in Monroe County, Florida, in March 1997, and had a daughter before separating in 2008. Wales moved to San Diego in 1998, and after becoming disillusioned with the housing market there, moved in 2002 to St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nHe had a brief relationship with Canadian conservative columnist Rachel Marsden in 2008 that began after Marsden contacted Wales about her Wikipedia biography. After accusations that Wales's relationship constituted a conflict of interest, he stated that there had been a relationship but that it was over and that it had not influenced any matters on Wikipedia, a statement Marsden disputed.\n\nWales married Kate Garvey at Wesley's Chapel in London on October 6, 2012. Garvey is Tony Blair's former diary secretary; the couple met in Davos, Switzerland. Wales has three daughters: one with Rohan and two with Garvey.\n\nWales is of Jewish descent but an atheist. In an interview with Big Think, he said his philosophy is firmly rooted in reason, and that he is a complete non-believer.\n\nWales has lived in London, England since 2012. He became a British citizen in 2019. In 2021, on The Tim Ferriss Show podcast, he revealed that he secretly moved to Argentina for one month after reading Ferriss's book The 4-Hour Workweek.\n\nWales says that he is a passionate chef.\n\nDistinctions\n\nWales is a former co-chair of the World Economic Forum on the Middle East 2008, and a former board member of Socialtext.\n\nHe is a member of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School, the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence, and the board of directors at Creative Commons and Hunch.com.\n\nIn 2006, Wales was listed in the \"Scientists & Thinkers\" section of the TIME 100 and number 12 in Forbes \"The Web Celebs 25\".\n\nWales has also given a lecture in the Stuart Regen Visionary series at New Museum which \"honors special individuals who have made major contributions to art and culture and are actively imagining a better future\" and by the World Economic Forum as one of the \"Young Global Leaders\" of 2007.\n\nThe 2008 Global Brand Icon of the Year Award, and on behalf of the Wikimedia project the Quadriga award of Werkstatt Deutschland for A Mission of Enlightenment.\n\nThe 2009 Nokia Foundation annual award, the Business Process Award at the 7th Annual Innovation Awards and Summit by The Economist.\n\nIn April 2011, Wales served on the jury of the Tribeca Film Festival, Wales has received a Pioneer Award, the Gottlieb Duttweiler Prize and the Leonardo European Corporate Learning Award in 2011, the Monaco Media Prize. Wales has also received honorary degrees from Knox College, Amherst College, Stevenson University, Argentina's Universidad Empresarial Siglo 21, and Russia's MIREA University.\n\nOn December 5, 2013, Wales was awarded the UNESCO Niels Bohr Medal in Copenhagen, Denmark at a conference on \"An Open World\" to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Niels Bohr's atomic theory. His presentation on \"Wikipedia, Democracy and the Internet\" emphasized the need to expand Wikipedia into virtually all the languages of the world. The \"Wikipedia Zero\" initiative was beginning to prove successful in encouraging telecommunications companies to provide children in the developing world with free access to Wikipedia for educational purposes. Wales was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nIn February 2014, Wales was named one of \"25 Web Superstars\" by The Daily Telegraph. On May 17, 2014, Wales was awarded a Doctorate Honoris Causa by the Faculty of Communication Sciences of the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI Lugano, Switzerland). On June 25, 2014, Wales received an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus at Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland. On July 10, 2014, Wales received the UK Tech4Good Awards \"Special Award\" for establishing Wikipedia. He was one of eight winners in various categories meant to honor organizations and individuals who use digital technology to improve the lives of others. In December 2014, Wales shared the inaugural $1 million Mohammed bin Rashid Knowledge Award with World Wide Web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee.\n\nIn January 2015, Maastricht University awarded a Doctorate Honoris Causa to Wales. On April 25, 2015, Wales received the Common Wealth Award of Distinguished Service along with Jon Bon Jovi and Edward Norton. On May 17, 2015, Wales received the Dan David Prize of $1 million in the \"Present\" category (others won that amount for \"Past\" and \"Future\" contributions to society). He was awarded the prize for \"launching the world's largest online encyclopedia\".\n\nIn January 2016, Wales, along with Baroness Rebuck, became a non-executive director of the Guardian Media Group. On February 2, 2016, he received a Doctorate Honoris Causa from the Université Catholique de Louvain.\n\nIn June 2016, during the opening ceremony on Wikimania 2016, Wales was awarded honorary citizenship of Esino Lario.\n\nIn September 2017, he was awarded the President's Medal of the British Academy \"for facilitating the spread of information via his work creating and developing Wikipedia, the world's largest free online encyclopedia\".\n\nSee also"
