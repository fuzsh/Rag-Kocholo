Attendees will hear from speakers and panelists sharing the challenges of the past and working to affect positive change in the state of Alabama.\n\nThe event, held over a two-day period in late August, continues traditions familiar to those who have attended symposium in the past, builds on successful recent innovations, and re-formats the content session blocks for a wider range of topics and session styles. Attendees will see opportunities for both peer gatherings and full-community networking through meals, planning sessions, and dialogue activities.\n\nSpecial features of this 25th anniversary event include the addition of content sessions specifically designed for Fellows, small community dinners for the Advisory Board and Fellows, a collaborative Poverty Simulation with the Center for Service and Leadership, family activities for guests with children, a community celebration at the Tuscaloosa River Market, and much more!\n\nEvent Dates and Locations\n\nThis year’s event will be held on Friday, August 23 and Saturday, August 24 at four locations in Tuscaloosa, AL: Ferguson Center (The University of Alabama), Alabama Museum of Natural History (The University of Alabama), The University Club, and Tuscaloosa River Market\n\nProgram Guide\n\nThe full Program Guide is now available and includes detailed schedules; session descriptions and presenter biographies; venue, hotel, and parking information; and much, much more helpful information to help guide you prepare for the weekend.

Nix Memorial Lecture, special featured speakers will present to the full community to open the event on Saturday morning at the Ferguson Student Center and to close the event on Saturday night at the Tuscaloosa River Market.\n\nKeynote Speaker (Frank A. Nix Memorial Lecture on Ethical Leadership)\n\nOne of the highlights of the weekend will be the keynote speaker, Mr. Jimmy Wales, in the Frank A. Nix Memorial Lecture on Ethical Leadership on Saturday afternoon in the Ferguson Student Center Ballroom.\n\nRanked by Forbes Magazine as a “Web Celeb”, Jimmy Donal Wales is a U.S. Internet entrepreneur, wiki pioneer, and technology visionary, who is best known as the Founder of Wikipedia, an international collaborative free content encyclopedia on the Internet, and the Wikimedia Foundation. He is also the founder of WikiTribune, a groundbreaking ad-free news platform that produces evidence-based journalism, and co-founder of Wikia, a privately owned free web hosting service he set up in 2004.\n\nThe origins of Wikipedia began in March 2000, when Mr. Wales started Nupedia (“the free encyclopedia”), which was characterized by an extensive peer-review process designed to make its articles of a quality comparable to that of professional encyclopedias. With the addition of wikis (a collection of web pages designed to enable anyone who accesses it to contribute or modify content), the project was dubbed “Wikipedia.” Mr. Wales laid down the founding principles and content, establishing an Internet-based community of contributors during that year. Wikipedia was initially intended to be a wiki-based site for collaboration on early encyclopedic content for submission to Nupedia, but Wikipedia’s rapid growth quickly overshadowed Nupedia’s development.\n\nIn a 2004 interview with Slashdot, Mr. Wales explained his motivations about Wikipedia, “Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That’s what we’re doing.”\n\nThe success of the project has helped popularize a trend in web development (called Web 2.0) that aims to facilitate creativity, collaboration, and sharing among users. As Wikipedia expanded and its public profile grew, Mr. Wales took on the role of the project’s spokesperson and promoter through speaking engagements and media appearances. His work with Wikipedia, which has become the world’s largest encyclopedia, prompted TIME Magazine to name him one of its “100 Most Influential People,” in 2006 in the “Scientists & Thinkers” category.\n\nIn 2003, Mr. Wales founded the Wikimedia Foundation, a nonprofit charitable organization dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free, multilingual content, and to providing the full content of these wiki-based projects to the public free of charge. The Wikimedia Foundation operates some of the largest collaboratively edited reference projects in the world, including Wikipedia, the 5th most popular website in the world.\n\nIn 2004, Wales co-founded, with Angela Beesley, the for-profit company Wikia, Inc. Wikia is a wiki farm — a collection of individual wikis on different subjects, all hosted on the same website. As part of his work at Wikia, Inc., Mr. Wales is developing a human-powered search engine, Search Wikia, which will be based on the same open, transparent, community-driven principles of Wikia and Wikipedia.\n\nIn 2017, Wales founded WikiTribune, an ad-free global news platform that aims to address the idea that “the news is broken and we can fix it.” By pairing standards-based journalism with a team of dedicated community contributors and a crowdfunded business model, WikiTribune ensures articles are fact-checked and un-biased, sources are transparent, and users have the ability to flag and contribute to the articles they read. As citizens’ demand for reliable, fact-based journalism grows ever-louder, Wales is blazing a path forward that will reshape news media.\n\nMr. Wales is a Fellow of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School. He serves on the Board of Directors of Socialtext, a provider of wiki technology to businesses and the non-profit organization Creative Commons. Mr. Wales has received an honorary doctorate from numerous academic institutions, including Knox College of Illinois where he was presented with a Pioneer Award from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Maastricht University, where he received the Common Wealth Award of Distinguished Service.\n\nMr. Wales received his bachelor’s degree in finance from Auburn University and started with the Ph.D. finance program at the University of Alabama, where he left with a Master’s. After that, he took courses offered in the Ph.D. finance program at Indiana University. He taught at both universities during his postgraduate studies, but did not write the doctoral dissertation required to earn a Ph.D.\n\nFeatured Speakers\n\nWe are pleased to announce two special guests that will join us for the 2019 Annual Symposium as featured speakers.\n\nNon-Student Attendees (as of 11 a.m. on 08/03/2019)\n\nAdvisory Board and Blackburn Society\n\nBaldwin, Norman\n\nBedsole, Jenna\n\nBlackburn, Gloria\n\nBriddell, Michael\n\nCarroll, Mary Margaret\n\nCleveland, Prince\n\nCobb, Sue Bell\n\nCovington, John\n\nCramer, Kathleen\n\nDavidson, Bradley\n\nDonaldson, David\n\nFoster, Benjamin\n\nGravlee, Macon\n\nHarris, Robert\n\nHeflin, Cornelia\n\nHenshaw, Russell\n\nHouse, Mike\n\nLamar, Terry\n\nLewis, Matthew\n\nLieb, Mary\n\nMartin, Gordon\n\nMathews, David\n\nMcIntosh, Marion\n\nMcNair, Stephen\n\nMoore-Miller, Rosalind\n\nMorrow, Martha\n\nNichols, Taylor\n\nNix, Marjorie Kay\n\nPatterson, Carol\n\nPatterson, Tom\n\nPiper, Holly\n\nReynolds, Pat\n\nRigby-House, Gina\n\nRoth, Julia\n\nSaxon, John\n\nSiegal, Bobbie\n\nSiegal, Don\n\nSharif, Rashmee\n\nSmith, Alex L.\n\nSmith, Christian\n\nSmith, Joan Reichwein\n\nTaylor, Mashonda\n\nThibodaux, Louise\n\nVallely, Lynne\n\nWren, O.
