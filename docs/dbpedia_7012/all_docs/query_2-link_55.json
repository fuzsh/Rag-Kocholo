For close to 40 years CPJ has defended the right of journalists to tell stories and bring news to their communities without fear of reprisal.\n\n^ top\n\nWho runs CPJ?\n\nCPJ has headquarters in New York and an office in Washington, D.C. We have representatives, correspondents, or other specialists in cities including Bangkok, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Bogotá, Delhi, Istanbul, London, Mexico City, Nairobi, and Taipei. A board of prominent journalists directs CPJ’s activities.\n\n^ top\n\nHow is CPJ funded?\n\nCPJ is funded solely by contributions from individuals, corporations, and foundations. CPJ does not accept government funding. For a full list of major donors, please click here for our latest annual report.\n\n^ top\n\nWhy is press freedom important?\n\nWithout a free press, few other human rights are attainable. A strong press freedom environment encourages the growth of a robust civil society, which leads to stable, sustainable democracies and healthy social, political, and economic development. CPJ works in more than 120 countries, many of which suffer under repressive regimes, debilitating civil war, conflict, or other circumstances that harm press freedom and put journalists at risk.\n\n^ top\n\nHow does CPJ protect journalists?\n\nSince its founding in 1981, it has been CPJ’s mandate to take action when journalists are censored, harassed, threatened, attacked, jailed, abducted, or killed for their work, without regard to political ideology. To achieve this goal, CPJ documents cases, publishes in-depth reports, conducts high-level advocacy and campaigns on journalists’ behalf, and provides comprehensive, life-saving emergency support.\n\nBy publicizing abuses to the press and acting on behalf of imprisoned and threatened journalists, CPJ effectively warns journalists and news organizations where attacks on press freedom are occurring. CPJ works through diplomatic channels to effect change.\n\n^ top\n\nWhere does CPJ get its information?\n\nCPJ has full-time program coordinators monitoring the press in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe and Central Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa. In addition, CPJ’s Emergencies Response Team tracks online risks and regularly shares developments in journalist safety.\n\nCPJ keeps journalists abreast of developments in press freedom through independent research, fact-finding missions, and firsthand contacts in the field, including reports from other journalists.\n\n^ top\n\nHow does CPJ investigate and classify attacks on the press?\n\nCPJ’s research staff document hundreds of attacks on the press each year. Each case identified as a violation of press freedom is corroborated by more than one source for factual accuracy, confirmation that the victims were journalists or news organizations, and verification that intimidation was the probable motive. CPJ defines journalists as people who cover news or comment on public affairs in print, in photographs, on radio, on television, or online. Writers, editors, publishers, producers, technicians, photographers, camera operators, and directors of news organizations are all included.\n\nCPJ classifies press freedom violations according to the following definitions:\n\nAbducted\n\nSeized and detained by a non-governmental entity. CPJ has determined that a credible claim of responsibility has been made.\n\nAttacked\n\nIn the case of journalists, wounded or assaulted, including sexualized assault; in the case of news facilities, damaged, raided, or searched; attacked because of news coverage or commentary.\n\nCensored\n\nOfficially suppressed or banned; editions confiscated; news outlets closed.\n\nExpelled\n\nForced to leave a country because of news coverage or commentary.\n\nHarassed\n\nAccess denied or limited; materials confiscated or damaged; entry or exit denied; family members attacked or threatened; dismissed or demoted (when it is clearly the result of political or outside pressure); freedom of movement impeded; detained for less than 48 hours.\n\nImprisoned\n\nArrested or detained by a government entity for at least 48 hours.\n\nKilled\n\nMurdered in retribution for, or to prevent, news coverage or commentary. Also includes journalists killed in conflict or crossfire or while covering dangerous assignments.\n\nKilled (Motive Unconfirmed)\n\nThe motive for a journalist’s murder is unclear, but there is reason to believe it may be related to his or her professional duties. CPJ continues to research the reasons for the crime and encourages local authorities to pursue investigations.\n\nLegal Action\n\nCredentials denied or suspended; fined; sentenced to prison; visas denied or canceled; restrictive legislation; libel suit intended to inhibit coverage.\n\nMissing\n\nVanished. No group has taken responsibility for the journalist’s disappearance; in some instances, feared dead.\n\nThreatened\n\nMenaced with physical harm or some other type of retribution.\n\n^ top\n\nCPJ’s killed list has “confirmed” and “unconfirmed” cases. What does that mean?\n\nCPJ investigates each report of a journalist killed to determine whether the journalist was targeted because of his or her work. We do not classify a case as “confirmed” until we are reasonably certain that the death was related to the victim’s journalistic work.\n\nWhen the motive for a murder is unclear–but there is reason to suspect that it may be related to the journalist’s profession–CPJ classifies that death as “motive unconfirmed” and continues to investigate.\n\nWith regard to both lists, CPJ continues to press for official investigations into the killings, as well as for the apprehension and punishment of the perpetrators. We also document cases of media support workers killed for their work, and journalists who go missing in the line of duty.\n\n^ top\n\nCPJ’s list of killed journalists is different from other organizations. Why?\n\nWhen CPJ publicizes journalists killed on duty, it cites only those cases in which the motive has been “confirmed.” (Please see classifications and definitions above.) Lists compiled by other organizations may include journalists whose killings CPJ has not connected to their work with reasonable certainty. Other organizations may also list media activists and/or media support workers, such as drivers and interpreters. CPJ maintains a separate list of media support workers killed on duty.\n\n^ top\n\nWhat is the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker?\n\nJournalists in the United States face hostility from local and federal governments, along with a number of legal threats to themselves and their sources. The nonpartisan website provides reliable, easy-to-access information on the number of press freedom violations in the United States–from journalists facing charges to reporters stopped at the U.S. border or asked to hand over their electronics.\n\nThe U.S. Press Freedom Tracker brings together more than two dozen press freedom groups to create a centralized repository for research. The data gathered will help inform advocacy, journalism, and legal action.\n\n^ top\n\nWhen would a journalist call upon CPJ?\n\nIn an emergency. Using local and foreign contacts, CPJ can intervene whenever local and foreign correspondents are in trouble. CPJ is prepared to notify news organizations, government officials, and human rights organizations immediately of press freedom violations.\n\nWhen traveling on assignment. CPJ can advise journalists covering dangerous assignments.\n\nWhen covering the news. Attacks against the press are news, and they often serve as the first signal of a crackdown on all freedoms. CPJ is uniquely situated to provide journalists with information and insight into press conditions around the world.\n\n^ top\n\nWhat is CPJ’s Emergencies Response Team?\n\nCPJ’s Emergencies Response Team provides comprehensive, life-saving support to journalists and media support staff at risk around the world through up-to-date safety and security information and rapid response assistance.\n\nThe team publishes safety advisories for journalists on the frontlines, and has a comprehensive toolkit with information on physical, digital, and psychological safety. CPJ also refers journalists to other resources such as grants, fellowships, and awards.\n\nSign up for CPJ security alerts here.\n\n^ top\n\nHow can I get involved?\n\nThere are many ways to support CPJ.
