An Editorial Board, composed of faculty from participating institutions, oversees the editorial and review process for our titles; an elected Oversight Committee, composed of representatives of participating institutions, directs the execution of Lever’s business plan. Lever Press is a member of the Association of University Presses.\n\nLever Initiative Bylaws\n\nEditorial Board\n\nThe Editorial Board is responsible for overseeing the acquisition, review, and development process through which individual titles have progressed, and to assure by its imprimatur both the scholarly quality of a work and its alignment with the editorial program of the Lever Press. The Board consists of faculty nominated from Lever Press pledging institutions and selected by the Oversight Committee. The Chair of the Oversight Committee holds an ex officio position on the Board and two representatives from Michigan Publishing hold non-voting positions. The Board meets monthly by teleconference and in person at least once per year.\n\nCurrent Editorial Board members:\n\nKathryne Corbin, Haverford College\n\nDarin Hayton, Haverford College (Chair)\n\nBethany Hicok, Williams College\n\nKathryn Lesh, Union College\n\nAngelo Mercado, Grinnell College\n\nJonson Miller, Drexel University\n\nFernando Nascimento, Bowdoin College\n\nHai-Dang Phan, Grinnell College\n\nStanding\n\nSara Cohen, Editorial Director, University of Michigan Press\n\nS ean Guynes, Acquiring Editor, Lever Press\n\nCurtis Brundy, Oversight Committee Chair, ex officio\n\nOversight Committee\n\nThe Oversight Committee is responsible for overall strategic guidance of the Lever Press. The Committee consists of representatives nominated from and elected by Lever Press pledging institutions, and two representatives from Michigan Publishing. The committee meets monthly by teleconference and in person at least once per year.\n\nCurrent Oversight Committee members:\n\nAndrew Ashton, Director of the Libraries, Thompson Library, Vassar College\n\nCurtis Brundy, Associate University Librarian for Scholarly Communication and Collections, Parks Library, Iowa State University (Chair)\n\nMark Christel, Librarian of the College, Grinnell College\n\nNancy Falciani-White, Library Director, Randolph-Macon College (Secretary)\n\nSusan Fliss, Dean of Libraries, Neilson Library, Smith College\n\nBryn Geffert, Dean of Libraries, Howe Library, University of Vermont\n\nAnne Houston, Director of Libraries and College Librarian, McCabe Library, Swarthmore College (Treasurer)\n\nF rances Maloy, College Librarian, Schaffer Library, Union College (Past Chair)\n\nLev Rickards, Assistant Dean, Collections & Scholarly Communication, Santa Clara University Library, Santa Clara University\n\nLuke Vilelle, University Librarian, Wyndham Robertson Library, Hollins University (Vice Chair/Chair-elect)\n\nStanding\n\nSean Guynes, Acquiring Editor, Lever Press\n\nCharles Watkinson, AUL for Publishing and Director of the University of Michigan Press\n\nOperations Group\n\nThe Lever Press Operations Group is essentially the production backbone of Lever Press. It consists of staff at Michigan Publishing with a key role in acquiring, developing, and producing Lever Press titles, or in the administration of this initiative. The current Operations Group consists of:\n\nJason Colman, Director, Michigan Publishing Services\n\nTerri Geitgey, Program Manager, Lever Press and Publishing Services Librarian, Michigan Publishing Services\n\nSean Guynes, Acquiring Editor, Lever Press\n\nJamie Jones, Director, Sales, Marketing and Outreach, University of Michigan Press\n\nSharla Lair, Sr. Strategist, Open Access & Scholarly Communication Initiatives, Lyrasis\n\nKelsey Mrjoian, Library Relations Manager, University of Michigan Press\n\nK atie Rokakis, Senior Digital Publishing Coordinator, Michigan Publishing Services\n\nCharles Watkinson, AUL for Publishing and Director of the University of Michigan Press\n\nOur Values\n\nLever Press is grounded on a set of values, and guided by clear commitments. The values on which we’re basing our work are:\n\nproducing the highest quality scholarship in an economically sustainable model\n\nembodying and reflecting the values of the liberal arts, and\n\nleading the way in establishing best practices for born-digital, peer reviewed, open access monograph publishing.\n\nAs a press aligned with the ethos and mission of liberal arts colleges, we seek out, identify, evaluate, and advocate for transformative scholarship that spurs creative dialogue within and between traditional fields of inquiry, emphasizes disciplinary innovation, draws upon new models of collaborative research, and strives to reach the broadest audience possible. We value:\n\nleadership and the courage to push existing boundaries\n\ndiverse voices and viewpoints\n\nthe principles of equity and social justice\n\nbuilding community among our members and beyond\n\ncontinuous learning\n\nBy living our values we will be responsive to the needs of readers, authors, and member institutions, share our liberal arts focus broadly, and engage globally with others in the exchange of new scholarship.\n\nOur Commitments\n\nAlignment with mission and ethos of liberal arts colleges. Like the colleges supporting our mission, we welcome works exploring intellectual connections across academic disciplines and divisions. Lever Press also champions works whose methods and modalities reach beyond the standard monograph. Inspired by the close collaborations between faculty and undergraduate students at liberal arts colleges, we seek path-breaking ideas communicated with clarity and creativity—publications that “teach what they know.”\n\nPlatinum Open Access. Lever Press is a fully open access press: all works will be freely available to readers on the web immediately upon publication. Uniquely, Lever Press is committed to what we’re calling “Platinum OA,” in which all the costs of acquiring, editing, developing, and producing the work are borne collectively by our supporting institutions—not by individual authors or their sponsoring departments or institutions. Platinum OA means Lever Press can consider works with regard to scholarly merit only. Because we take on all the costs of producing the work we select, Platinum OA means one thing more: that the work we produce is of the highest quality, and has been selected exactly because it is worth the investment.\n\nBorn digital. While Lever Press titles will appear in print form wherever possible, we approach publishing as a digital-first endeavor. Unconstrained by legacy publishing processes and leveraging the opportunities for reuse facilitated by an open-access business model, Lever Press will welcome projects of digital scholarship not well served by scholarly conventions limited to print-only outcomes. We’ll work in partnership with an emerging community of scholars in the digital humanities who are linking together narrative analysis and datasets from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and using new tools for visualization and reader engagement.\n\nPeer Review\n\nLever Press is committed to the highest standards of peer review in evaluating the work it considers for publication and to communicating the nature of review to readers in a transparent fashion. As a process of independent and informed evaluation of both argument and originality of scholarly work, peer review is the principal means by which Lever assures the quality and merit of the work it publishes. Please see our Peer Review Commitments and Guidelines page for more details.\n\nDiscovery and Reuse\n\nLever Press titles are made available under Creative Commons (CC) licenses to maximize opportunities for reuse. The particular CC license chosen is up to the author. As well as being delivered through the Fulcrum platform, Lever Press titles are delivered to a range of book indexers, library discovery services, and platforms including JSTOR Open, Muse Open, Open Research Library, and OAPEN. MARC records are available for free download under a CC0 license from this location.

You can find there as well copies of the results of a faculty survey we conducted about needs in scholarly publishing, and our first report to the Oberlin Group.\n\nIf you’re interested, you can read as well:\n\nThe request for proposals that we issued to publishers inviting submissions for ways of realizing our vision;\n\nThe proposal submitted by the Amherst/Michigan team that we selected;\n\nThe business plan we agreed to together.\n\nAfter finalizing our choice, the Task Force has met regularly with the Amherst/Michigan team to finalize the documents that set out how the Lever Press will be governed by participating libraries and guided by its editorial board.\n\nNote that while the initial agreement is between the publishing team and the Oberlin Group, participation is not limited to Oberlin Group members, and libraries committing to our work stand as equals in the governance of the Press.\n\nWe’ve also developed the document that participating libraries will be asked to sign in joining the Lever Press initiative as stakeholders."
