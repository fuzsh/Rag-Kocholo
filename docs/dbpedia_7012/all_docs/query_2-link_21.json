        "text": "Apply\n\nLicensing & copyright\n\nLicensing\n\nDOAJ recommends the use of Creative Commons licenses to inform readers how published content can be used. We do not specify which license should be used. You may select the Creative Commons license that best meets the needs of the journal, or give authors the option to choose a license for their paper.\n\nYou may not add to or adapt the terms of a Creative Commons license. This means you cannot impose restrictions on authors or users that conflict with the provisions of the license. Creative Commons licenses state clearly that \"For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply\".\n\nIn some cases, we will accept a publisher's own license if it is broadly equivalent to one of the Creative Commons licenses.\n\nCopyright\n\nThe initial copyright of a paper is held by the authors (or their employer, in some instances). When publishing that paper the copyright may continue to be held by the author, or can be licensed or transferred to the publisher.\n\nDOAJ recommends that journals allow authors to retain the copyright of their papers without restrictions. Authors will then grant the publisher the right of first publication, and other non-exclusive publishing rights.\n\nEven when the author retains copyright, restrictions may sometimes be imposed by the publisher:\n\nThe publisher requires exclusive publishing rights. This means that the author no longer holds copyright without restrictions.\n\nThe publisher requires a transfer or exclusive license of commercial rights. This means the author no longer holds copyright without restrictions.\n\nCopyright terms must not contradict the licensing terms or the terms of the open access policy.\n\n“All rights reserved” is never appropriate for open access content.\n\n\"Fair use\" is not open access and we do not accept journals with these restrictions.\n\nAuthor rights\n\nThe terms of the Creative Commons (or other) license do not apply to the copyright holder. This means that when the author retains copyright without restrictions, the license applies to the readers and the publisher.\n\nBut the license applies to the readers and the author when:\n\ncopyright has been transferred to the publisher\n\nthe author retains copyright and grants exclusive publishing rights to the publisher\n\nthe author retains copyright, transfers or grants exclusive commercial rights to the publisher, and a non-commercial license is used\n\nFurther reading\n\nFurther reading and more examples are available as a downloadable presentation.\n\nIn other languages\n\nFrench - hosted by Érudit\n\nVersion history\n\nThis is Version 1 of our Licensing and copyright page."
