They can be employees of member organisations or other experienced and suitably skilled people put forward and supported by member organisations. In all cases when they are elected to the Board they act as individuals, not as representative of their organisation or any other interests. Board members serve for a maximum of two terms of three years each. You can write to them at board [at] edri [dot] org.\n\nIt is of vital importance for EDRi to effectively identify, disclose and manage any actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest to protect EDRi’s integrity and manage risk. EDRi’s Conflict of Interest policy therefore applies to staff and Board. It covers management with respect to Board deliberations, in a universally established manner: if a Board member has a conflict of interest with regards to a “transaction” being considered, she or he recuses her/himself from the discussions, unless asked by the Board to join for information purposes; and doesn’t have a vote in the decision."
