        "text": "Jimmy Donal \"Jimbo\" Wales ( ; born August 7, 1966[3]) is an American-born British Internet entrepreneur. He is one of the people who started Wikipedia and Wikia.[4][5] Wales was born in Huntsville, Alabama, United States. There, he went to Randolph School. He then earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in finance. In 1996, he and two partners started Bomis. Bomis was an Internet portal with entertainment and adult content. The company gave money for Nupedia (2000–2003) and, after that, Wikipedia.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[change | change source]\n\nWales has been married three times. He also has three children. Jimmy is of Jewish ancestry[6][7] When he was 20, Wales married Pam.[7] Pam was a worker at a store in Alabama.[7] He met his second wife, Christine Rohan, through a friend in Chicago.[6] They had a daughter before their marriage ended. Wales moved to San Diego in 1998. In 2002, he moved again to Florida.[8] In 2007, he still lived there.[9] As of 2012 he lives in London, England.[10] In 2012, Wales married Kate Garvey, a government worker for Tony Blair.[11] Wales has three daughters: one with Rohan and two with Garvey.[12]\n\nWales says that he follows the ideas of Objectivism. He also says that he is a libertarian to some extent, meaning that he thinks people should be allowed to do whatever they want so long as they do not hurt others."
