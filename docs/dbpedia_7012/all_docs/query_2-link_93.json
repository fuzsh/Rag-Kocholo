You can save your progress and review all your answers before you submit them. To help you, a PDF list of the questions is available for download.\n\nBasic criteria for inclusion\n\nThe type of journal that can apply\n\nOpen access journals published in any language may apply. Journals should adhere to the Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing.\n\nThe journal must be actively publishing scholarly research\n\nAny research subject area\n\nPublish at least five research articles per year\n\nPrimary target audience of researchers or practitioners\n\nNewly launched journals\n\nBefore applying to DOAJ, a new or flipped journal must demonstrate a publishing history of more than one year or have published at least ten open access research articles.\n\nThe type of open access\n\nDOAJ only accepts open access journals.\n\nWe define these as journals where the copyright holder of a scholarly work grants usage rights to others using an open license (Creative Commons or equivalent). This allows for immediate free access to the work and permits any user to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose.\n\nThe journal must display an open access statement indicating that it fulfils the DOAJ definition of open access.\n\nThe full text of all content must be available for free and open access without delay.\n\nNo embargo period\n\nNo requirement for users to register to read content\n\nA charge for the print version of a journal is permitted\n\nJournal website\n\nThe journal must have its own dedicated URL and homepage that is accessible from any location\n\nEach article must be available as an individual, full-text article\n\none unique URL per article\n\nHTML or PDF, as a minimum\n\nJournals that include intrusive advertising will not be accepted. See best practice recommendations for advertising.\n\nDOAJ does not approve of using Impact Factors or ranking metrics. However, journals may display the Journal Impact Factor calculated by Clarivate and metrics from Scopus. Journals must not display any reference (images, links, logos) to Impact Factors or ranking metrics from any other service.\n\nThe website does not need to be in English. If the site is available in multiple languages, the information provided must be the same in all languages.\n\nThe following information must be available online and easily accessible from the journal homepage:\n\nOpen access policy\n\nAims and scope\n\nEditorial board (including institutional affiliations of all members)\n\nInstructions for authors\n\nEditorial process (peer review)\n\nLicensing terms\n\nCopyright terms\n\nAuthor charges\n\nIf a journal doesn’t have any charges, then this must be stated\n\nMust include all fees that may be charged to the author, from submission to publication, including:\n\nsubmission fees\n\neditorial processing charges\n\narticle processing charges (APCs)\n\npage charges\n\ncolour charges\n\nAny fee waiver must be clearly specified with the conditions of waiver, e.g. amount, time period.\n\nIf there are charges for withdrawing the article after submission, they cannot exceed the author charges.\n\nContact details\n\nInclude the name of a contact person and the journal's dedicated email address.\n\nThe country in the application and on the journal website must be where the publisher is registered and carries out its business activities.\n\nISSN\n\nA journal must have at least one ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) that is registered and confirmed at issn.org.\n\nThe ISSN(s) must be displayed on the website.\n\nThe journal's name in the application and on the website must match what is shown at issn.org.\n\nQuality control process\n\nA journal must have an editor and an editorial board.\n\nThe editorial board must be listed on the website.\n\nThe name and affiliation of all editors and board members must be included.\n\nJournals that display a list of reviewers must include their names and affiliations.\n\nThe editorial board for the journal should consist of at least five editors with appropriate qualifications and expertise. It is recommended that board members should not all come from the same institution.\n\nAll articles must pass through a quality control system (peer review) before publication.\n\nThe type and details of the peer review process must be stated clearly on the website, including the process for special issues, if applicable.\n\nAt least two independent reviewers should review each article.\n\nUse of a plagiarism checking service is highly recommended but not required for inclusion in DOAJ.\n\nEndogeny should be minimised.\n\nThe proportion of published research papers where at least one of the authors is an editor, editorial board member, or reviewer must not exceed 25% in either of the latest two issues.\n\nWhere content is not divided into issues, for example in a continuous publication model, endogeny must not exceed 25% in the last calendar year (minimum 5 articles per year).\n\nSpecial issues\n\nJournals that publish special issues or other content curated by guest editors must adhere to these additional criteria:\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief must be responsible for the content of the entire journal, including all special issues, which must fall within the scope of the journal\n\nSpecial issue articles must have the same editorial oversight as regular papers, including external peer review, and be clearly labelled\n\nJournals must ensure that guest editors’ credentials are checked and approved\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief or dedicated board members must oversee the guest editors\n\nPapers submitted to a special issue by the guest editor(s) must be handled under an independent review process and make up no more than 25% of the issue's total\n\nLicensing\n\nThe licensing terms for use and re-use of the published content must be clearly stated on the website.\n\nDOAJ recommends using Creative Commons licenses for this purpose.\n\nIf Creative Commons licensing is not used, similar terms and conditions should be applied.\n\nExtra care must be taken to state these terms clearly.\n\nIt is recommended that licensing information is displayed or embedded in full-text articles, but this is not required for inclusion in DOAJ.\n\nMore about licensing\n\nCopyright\n\nThe copyright terms applied to the published content must be clearly stated and separate from those applied to the website.\n\nCopyright terms must not contradict the licensing terms or the terms of the open access policy.\n\n“All rights reserved” is never appropriate for open access content.\n\nMore about copyright\n\nAdditional criteria for some journal types\n\nArts and humanities journals\n\nFor these disciplines (pages 10-16 only), DOAJ can accept journals that undertake editorial review, rather than peer review. Editorial review must be handled with a minimum of two editors.\n\nClinical case reports journals\n\nDOAJ only considers a case report research if it includes the retrospective analysis of three or more clinical cases or a literature review. The journal must publish at least five articles per year that meet this definition.\n\nConference proceedings journals\n\nFor DOAJ to include journals dedicated to publishing conference proceedings, the journal must have an ISSN and a permanent editorial or advisory board providing editorial oversight. Papers from each published conference must be peer-reviewed according to DOAJ criteria. Full text of all conference papers must be available. Individual conference proceedings will not be indexed.\n\nData journals\n\nDOAJ will accept journals publishing research articles about data or datasets, but not journals that simply link to datasets or announce their availability.\n\nOverlay journals\n\nDOAJ will accept journals that select and peer-review articles hosted on a preprint server or other site.\n\nStudent-run journals\n\nIf a student body runs a journal, there must be an advisory board for the journal where at least two members have a PhD or equivalent qualification.\n\nFlipped journals\n\nWhere a journal was previously published as a subscription or hybrid journal and has now flipped to a fully open access model, this information must be clearly displayed:\n\nThe date of the change to fully open access\n\nThe availability of the archive material (open access, free, or paywalled)\n\nReuse rights of the archive material (all rights reserved or open license)\n\nAll content published after the flipped date must be completely open access.\n\nDOAJ will consider flipped journals for inclusion after they have published at least ten research articles as a fully Open Access journal.\n\nMirror journals\n\nA mirror journal is a fully open access version of an existing subscription journal, with the same aims and scope, peer review processes and policies and an editorial board with at least 50% of the same members. The journal may have a similar name as the subscription title, but it must have a different ISSN. DOAJ will currently accept mirror journals if they meet the usual basic criteria for inclusion.\n\nBook review journals\n\nJournals consisting only of book reviews will not be accepted.\n\nThe application process\n\nYour application is successfully submitted when you see a Thank You screen and receive a confirmation email.\n\nIf you do not receive that email, contact us.\n\nAn editor will review your application. You may receive an email alerting you when this process has started.\n\nThe editor may need to contact you during the review process. Please answer any questions they send you. This helps us process your application correctly. Be aware that we will reject an application if, after one month, we haven't received answers to our questions.\n\nThe editor reviewing your application may be a volunteer and will not have a doaj.org email address. Check your spam folder frequently just in case the emails have ended up there.\n\nIf your application is accepted, you will receive an email to confirm this.\n\nTime from submission to decision\n\nThe time from submission to decision varies greatly and depends on the responsiveness of the journal contact and/or applicant. Generally, a decision is reached within three months. We cannot provide a status update for applications which are less than three months old.\n\nIf your application is rejected\n\nYou will receive an email giving the reasons for rejection of the application. Do not submit another application for the same journal until six months after the notification of rejection.\n\nNew applications may only be submitted within six months if these rejection reasons have been resolved:\n\nUnconfirmed ISSN\n\nWebsite unavailable\n\nInsufficient content published\n\nWhere a journal has been rejected for other reasons, a new application may be submitted after six months.\n\nYou are responsible for providing accurate information when you submit an application. Applications that contain information that is inaccurate or wrong or that have answers missing are automatically rejected.\n\nDOAJ only accepts journals that follow good publishing practice. If our review finds a publisher is not adhering to best practice, has provided information that is untrue or misleading, or has questionable publishing practices, DOAJ will not allow further applications from that publisher for a period of up to three years.\n\nJournals or publishers that have had multiple exclusions totalling six years or more will not be considered for inclusion in DOAJ and applications from them will be automatically rejected.\n\nJournals already accepted into DOAJ may be removed if they are found to be no longer adhering to DOAJ criteria or publishing best practice.\n\nPlease ensure that, if you do apply again after the exclusion period, the journal meets the DOAJ criteria for inclusion and that any necessary changes have been made to the journal website or policies.\n\nAppeals\n\nYou may submit an appeal if your journal has been removed from DOAJ or your application has been rejected and no new application is allowed for at least a year. Email the DOAJ Appeals Committee.\n\nThe appeal should contain the following information:\n\nJournal title\n\nJournal ISSN\n\nReason for appeal\n\nEvidence for the DOAJ Appeals Committee to consider\n\nThe original notification of rejection/removal\n\nAppeals are considered by the DOAJ Appeals Committee, consisting of the Head of Editorial and members of the editorial team. Committee meetings are held monthly. After your case is discussed, a member of the Committee will contact you with the result of your appeal. This will not be the same Managing Editor who handled your case originally.\n\nNo further communication will be entered into after the appeal is heard and the Committee has made their decision.\n\nAppeals or complaints that include abuse of DOAJ editors will not be considered. See our Zero tolerance policy. DOAJ reserves the right to impose a penalty on publishers for such behaviour.\n\nIn other languages\n\nWe are always looking for volunteers to translate our criteria. If you would like to volunteer to do this, please contact us.\n\nPlease note that these translations may not include the latest changes made to the Guide in November 2023.\n\nOur criteria are available in:\n\nArabic\n\nChinese (application form)\n\nChinese\n\nDanish\n\nFinnish\n\nFrench - hosted by Érudit\n\nGerman\n\nJapanese\n\nLithuanian\n\nPortuguese\n\nSlovak\n\nSpanish\n\nTurkish\n\nVersion history\n\nThis is Version 2.2 of our Guide to applying."
