        "text": "SLATA presents “Free Culture and the Future of Search,” a talk by Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia.com and wikia.com.\n\nJimmy Wales founded Wikipedia.com in 2001 with the philosophy: “Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That’s what we’re doing.” In the process, he pioneered the collaborative Web 2.0 model. Wikipedia currently has over 2 million articles and is consistently in the top ten websites visited worldwide. In 2004, Wales founded Wikia.com to expand beyond Wikipedia to more general online communities and collaborative projects. In 2005 Wales was appointed as a fellow of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School and is a member of the Board of Directors of Creative Commons. In 2006 he was named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world."
