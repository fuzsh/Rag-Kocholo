        "text": "Dong Sun was appointed secretary for innovation, technology and industry in 2022. Professor Sun is a world-renowned scholar and scientist. He is a pioneer in robotic manipulation of biological cells and robot control. His research has led to breakthroughs in the use of robotics combined with various micro-engineering tools. He has also received numerous awards. Professor Sun was elected as a fellow of the Canadian Academy of Engineering, member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts, fellow of the International Academy of Medical and Biological Engineering, fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Prior to his appointment, Professor Sun was the chair professor and head of the Department of Biomedical Engineering at City University of Hong Kong, and a member of the Legislative Council (election committee).\n\nJimmy Donal Wales is a US internet entrepreneur, wiki pioneer and technology visionary. He is best known as the founder of Wikipedia, a collaborative, free-content encyclopaedia on the internet, and the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit charitable organisation dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free, multilingual content. He is also the founder of WikiTribune, an ad-free news platform that produces evidence-based journalism, and co-founder of Wikia, a privately owned free web-hosting service he set up in 2004. As Wikipedia expanded and its public profile grew, Mr Wales assumed the role of the project’s spokesperson and promoter through speaking engagements and media appearances.\n\nMr Wales is a fellow of the Berkman Klein Centre for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School. He serves on the board of directors of Socialtext, a provider of wiki technology to businesses, and the non-profit organisation Creative Commons. He has received an honorary doctorate from numerous academic institutions, including Knox College of Illinois, where he was presented with a Pioneer Award from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Maastricht University, where he received the Common Wealth Award of Distinguished Service. He received his bachelor’s degree in finance from Auburn University and started with the PhD finance programme at the University of Alabama, where he left with a master’s degree.\n\nMichio Kaku is one of the most widely recognised figures in science in the world today. He has written five New York Times bestsellers and is the science correspondent for the national CBS This Morning TV programme. His weekly science radio show is heard in 100 cities across the country. He has hosted numerous science specials on the Discovery Channel, Science Channel and BBC TV and has appeared on many TV news, science and history programmes. He has written for Time magazine, the Wall Street Journal, Astronomy magazine, London Times, Daily Telegraph and many other international newspapers.\n\nMr Kaku graduated summa cum laude in physics from Harvard in 1968, graduating first in his physics class. He received his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1972. He has taught at City College of the City University of New York for 45 years, and holds the Henry Semat Chair in Theoretical Physics. He has taught at Harvard and Princeton as well. His goal is to complete Einstein’s dream of a “theory of everything”, to derive an equation, perhaps no more than one inch long, that will summarise all the physical laws of the universe. He is the co-founder of string field theory, a major branch of string theory, which is the leading candidate today for the theory of everything.\n\nMr Kaku is an internationally recognised authority in two areas. The first is Einstein’s unified field theory, which he is attempting to complete. The other is to predict trends affecting business, medicine, finance and our way of life, based on the latest research in science.\n\nHe frequently keynotes at major business conferences about the next 20 years in computers, finance, banking and commerce.\n\nAlexis Crowell is a seasoned technology executive with nearly 20 years in the industry. She currently serves as vice-president and general manager for the technology solutions, software and services group in Asia-Pacific at Intel Corporation.

Mr Klein has been working for AWS across Asia-Pacific and Europe to help customers implement architectural best practices and be successful in their digital transformation journey. In addition, he advises on how emerging technologies in the artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics and internet of things space can help create new products, make existing processes more efficient and leverage new engagement channels for end-consumers.\n\nPrior to joining AWS, Mr Klein ran the digital product strategy for an American multinational publishing and education company across Asia and led engineering and R&D efforts to build a virtualised web service platform for an internet service provider in Luxembourg during the pre-cloud era.\n\nHe has a bachelor of science degree in computer science from Trier University of Applied Sciences and a master’s degree in software engineering from the National University of Singapore.\n\nBen Falk joined Ernst & Young four years ago and is currently director of the global technology office.
