        "text": "Wales received degrees in finance from Auburn University (B.S.) and the University of Alabama (M.S.). From 1994 to 2000 he was an options trader in Chicago, amassing enough money to allow him to quit and start his own Internet company. Wales was a devotee of objectivism, and in 1989 he began moderating the online Ayn Rand Philosophy Discussion List. In March 2000, perhaps inspired by objectivist “openness,” he founded a free online encyclopaedia called Nupedia, which sought free contributions from scholars and other experts and subjected them to an intensive peer-review process. Frustrated by the slow progress of this project, Wales and Nupedia’s editor in chief, Larry Sanger, in 2001 turned to a new technology, a type of software called wiki, to create Wikipedia, a companion encyclopaedia site that anyone could contribute to and edit. Sanger and Wales parted company in 2002, but they continued to dispute who first came up with the idea of using the wiki software.\n\nDespite certain vulnerabilities—including the fact that Wikipedia was the object of deliberate vandalism, editorial wars, and practical jokes—the site was a huge success. By 2006 Wikipedia was available in a number of languages and was one of the Internet’s most popular sites. In 2003 Wales established the Wikimedia Foundation to oversee his expanding online enterprises. He extended the wiki model to several other projects, including Wiktionary and Wikinews. In 2004 he cofounded with Angela Beesley the for-profit Wikia, Inc."
