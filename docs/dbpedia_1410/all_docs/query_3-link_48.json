        "text": "I’m thrilled to be returning to Hampshire for the next two years. I had a great time at the The Ageas Bowl back in 2013 and I’m really excited about the progress the squad has made over the last few years.\n\nI’m looking forward to doing my bit to contribute to a successful period ahead with Hampshire Cricket.\n\nGeorge Bailey\n\nBailey, who has featured for Middlesex and Sussex as well as Hampshire during his time in England, has experience playing in all major T20 competitions across the world, including the Indian Premier League and Big Bash League.\n\nThe senior batsman is also widely regarded as a natural leader, having captained his Australian state side, Tasmania, as well as enjoying stints as Australian limited-overs captain in two World T20 campaigns as well as in the 2015 50-over World Cup."
