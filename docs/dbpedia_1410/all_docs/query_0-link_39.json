        "text": "Selectors' failed Bailey experiment cost Doolan crucial prep ahead of South Africa tour\n\nMALCOLM CONN COMMENT\n\nTHE DAILY TELEGRAPH\n\nJANUARY 21, 2014 12:00AM\n\nTHE selectors' George Bailey obsession has damaged Australia's preparation for next month's heavyweight clash in South Africa.\n\nBy failing to pick Alex Doolan, 28, for the Ashes series ahead of the now dropped Bailey, 31, the elegant if under-performed top order batsman is at a serious disadvantage preparing to confront the most highly ranked pace attack in the world.\n\nThe four-man panel of chairman John Inverarity, Rod Marsh, Andy Bichel and coach Darren Lehmann have also made a mockery of the mantra that discarded Test players must perform in the Sheffield Shield to be considered for a recall.\n\nNot if you're Shaun Marsh you don't.\n\nDuring his past three seasons Marsh, 30, has averaged 28, 19 and 31 for Western Australia in the Shield.\n\nThis season's Shield average of 31 is flattering, with more than half his runs from five matches coming in one innings, 127 not out.\n\nMarsh has not reached 50 in the other eight innings and five of them have been single figures, including one and four in last match, against Tasmania in Hobart.\n\nContrast this with Phil Hughes, 25, who has scored 549 runs at 61 for South Australia in the same number of matches this season, with two hundreds and a double century.\n\nEqually, contrast their overall Shield careers: Hughes averages 54 from 48 matches with 15 hundreds, Marsh averages 36 from 70 matches with seven hundreds.\n\nHave the selectors sated their Bailey obsession by rekindling their Marsh obsession?\n\nIt is easy to point at Marsh's 71 not out in the series-winning one-day victory against England in Sydney last Sunday night.\n\nBut the squad had already been chosen and, as Bailey has proved this summer, one-day form is no guide to Test cricket.\n\nIn four of the five Tests this season Australia was 5-143 or worse in its first innings and Bailey was a major part of those collapses with single figure scores on each occasion.\n\nHe rode on the wave of Australia's charge to a 5-0 whitewash.\n\nThe selectors had the ideal opportunity to choose Doolan shortly after he had played one of the best matches of his Shield career.\n\nIn the opening game of the season he scored 56 and 132, guiding Tasmania to victory over a NSW team led by Michael Clarke.\n\nBut the selectors were so impressed with Bailey's one-day hitting, when he averaged 96 on flat Indian wickets leading into the Ashes, that his leadership qualities tipped him past Doolan and into the Test side.\n\nNever mind that Bailey averaged just 18 in eight Shield games last season with only one half-century.\n\nDoolan had a first class average of 52 last season, which included 161 not out for Australia A against South Africa.\n\nThe selectors missed the boat on Doolan this summer. After being overlooked for the first Test his next eight first class innings did not include 50.\n\nFive were single figures.\n\nNo Shield for five weeks because of the Big Bash hiatus has left Doolan and Marsh seriously underdone, with just one warm-up match in South Africa before the first Test on February 12.\n\nhttp://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sp...outh-africa-tour/story-fni2flhh-1226806143124\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nShaun Marsh speaks of surprise at earning Test recall, grateful to WA coach Justin Langer\n\nCARLY ADNO\n\nNEWS LIMITED NETWORK\n\nJANUARY 20, 2014 6:00PM\n\nSHAUN Marsh has a great deal of faith to repay after he was included in Australia's 15-man Test squad to tour South Africa next month.\n\nThe 30-year-old admits he couldn't quite believe it when John Inverarity, chairman of selectors, rang him up on Saturday night to give him the news, and with good reason.\n\nMarsh averages 31 in the Sheffield Shield this season, below both Phil Hughes and George Bailey, the unfortunate batsmen left out of the squad.\n\nHis last Test series was against India in 2011-12, but it was a forgettable one after he made scores of 0, 3, 0, 11, 3 and 0.\n\n\"I was in a pretty bad space to be honest - it was a terrible series for me,\" Marsh said.\n\n\"I never thought I'd get back to where I am now at that stage. I had to go back to the basics and start from scratch.\n\nBut it wasn't just his batting that needed work. After a series of alcohol-fuelled incidents Marsh knew he had to change his lifestyle and he credits his mentor, Justin Langer, with helping him to do that.\n\nLanger took over as coach at WA and has worked closely with Marsh over the last 14 months.\n\n\"I had a few distractions away from cricket as well, which obviously you just can't have when you're playing for Australia,\" Marsh said.\n\n\"You've got to be so mentally tough out there and try and just block out distractions and all the other stuff that comes with being an international cricketer.\n\n\"Justin is probably the best at it. When he played he was so mentally tough and he's been fantastic for me, I've really enjoyed playing under him over the last 14 months.\n\n\"He basically just said I have to start from scratch again and we worked on a few technical things with my batting and a lot of mental stuff as well.\n\n\"When you get to this level a lot of it is mental and I had to improve on that if I ever got another opportunity to play Test cricket again.\n\n\"He's really helped my game physically and mentally and I think has put me in good stead for South Africa.\"\n\nMarsh is grateful to have Langer's influence at WA and Darren Lehmann's guidance in the national setup.\n\nBut he will have to provide them with proof of his turnaround against the world's top-ranked team.\n\n\"To get this opportunity again is amazing and I'm just very grateful for it,\" Marsh said.\n\n\"To play against the best team in the world and try and beat them on their home-ground is going to be a great experience for me.\n\n\"I'm really lucky I've got two good coaches now, obviously with Darren Lehmann as well, who has really been fantastic and he has really backed me from when he took over.\"\n\nhttp://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sp...ch-justin-langer/story-fni2fnmo-1226806031790\n\nIn-form batsman Phil Hughes left confused by Test squad snub\n\nRICHARD EARLE\n\nTHE ADVERTISER\n\nJANUARY 23, 2014 10:59PM\n\nPhil Hughes plays a shot for the Adelaide Strikers during a BBL match. Picture: Paul Kane. Source:Getty Images\n\nMYSTERY surrounds shattered Phil Hughes' omission from Australia's Test squad for South Africa with the left-hander and state officials understanding he was a certainty to tour.\n\nShaun Marsh jumped Hughes into Australia's 15-man squad to face the Proteas next month despite a first-class average of 31 this season for Western Australia - the same average that sealed Tasmanian George Bailey's Test axing.\n\nNational chairman of selectors John Inverarity's conflicting explanation of Hughes' snub, Marsh's inclusion and George Bailey's axing have also drawn the ire of South Australian coach Darren Berry.\n\nWhile Inverarity said Marsh was chosen on the basis of being \"in a good space,\" Hughes has been left in the dark and dejected.\n\nThe 26-Test batsman is on his family's Macksville banana farm dissecting the mixed signals of selectors and why making the mountain of first-class runs they demanded this season - 549 at 61- meant nothing.\n\n\"We were of the strong belief that Phil was going to South Africa,\" said a perplexed Berry of Hughes with 24 first-class tons aged 25.\n\n\"He was told that when he came back from England he was to make big Sheffield Shield runs.\n\n\"He made a double hundred, two other hundreds and sits in the top-five run scorers and South Australia is on top of the table.\n\n\"The Phillip Hughes thing is incredibly disappointing.\"\n\nBerry said he wasn't satisfied with Inverarity's logic in detailing the composition of Australia's squad to face South Africa in three Tests starting on February 12 at Centurion.\n\nInverarity said those players not selected for South Africa had to \"show their wares and push for claims\".\n\nHowever, 30-year-old Marsh's 248 first-class runs at 31 average this season and 28-year-old Alex Doolan's 391 runs at 39 suggests selectors now look beyond prolific scoring.\n\nThe pair have 14 combined first-class centuries.\n\n\"I think Shaun Marsh is a very talented player, but this is not about Marsh, Alex Doolan or Bailey. Our gripe is about Phillip Hughes.\n\n\"In our opinion his numbers, performances, age warranted selection for Australia,\" said Berry, who wants clarification of Hughes' position from selectors.\n\n\"Nobody can work out why he isn't on that tour to South Africa.\"\n\nAnother perennial selection casualty, Michael Klinger, has made the bold ploy of directly contacting selectors to determine why he has been continually overlooked for higher honours despite having a peerless domestic limited overs record for South Australia and Gloucestershire.\n\nIt appears Hughes must now convince Australian coach Darren Lehmann that he has what it takes to succeed in a third coming at Test level, replicating the magic that delivered back-to-back hundreds against the Proteas at Durban in 2009.\n\nhttp://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sp...-test-squad-snub/story-fni2fnmo-1226809074946\n\nSelectors must face Marsh reality, writes former Australian captain Ian Chappell\n\nIAN CHAPPELL\n\nNEWS LIMITED NETWORK\n\nJANUARY 26, 2014 12:00AM\n\nTONY Abbott proclaimed his would be a \"no surprises\" government. There are no such guarantees from the Australian selection panel.\n\nLeft-handed batsman Shaun Marsh was the main beneficiary of the selectors' speculation in choosing the Test squad for South Africa, while right-hander George Bailey was the only member of the Ashes whitewash squad who will miss the flight.\n\nMarsh has the sort of talent that makes batting look easy when he's in form and this can be a seductive quality.\n\nThe selectors have succumbed to his talent knowing full well that Marsh can be frustratingly inconsistent and is a recurring injury worry.\n\nThis is probably his last chance as a Test batsman.\n\nBy choosing both Marsh and newcomer Alex Doolan, the selectors have allowed for flexibility in the batting order.\n\nShane Watson is another who frustrates when his run output is compared with his prodigious talent.\n\nHis string of moderate first-innings scores has resulted in a number of options being provided for the crucial No.3 spot.\n\nIf the captain decides to bat Watson at six and utilise his bowling talents more, then it will be a straight battle between Marsh and Doolan for the first drop position.\n\nBailey's omission can't be classed as a surprise, as he was extremely fortunate to be in the side in the first place.\n\nThe batsman who could be considered unlucky is Phil Hughes.\n\nHughes has had a checkered Test career; he scored two centuries in his first four innings but has been dropped on five occasions.\n\nHe must rue the day he set foot on Thomas Lord's potato patch; he's played two Tests at the famous London ground - four unsuccessful innings - and each time he's been dropped.\n\nHowever, Hughes continues to perform in an environment that should please the selectors.\n\nHe consistently scores first-class hundreds, where others like Marsh haven't, and yet he's been overlooked.\n\nHis luck may change in five years time, as this panel has a tendency to seek out older batsmen.\n\nThey've chosen four - Ed Cowan, Rob Quiney, George Bailey and Chris Rogers - and only the last named has the look of a survivor.\n\nThis underlines the weakness in choosing older batsmen; once they start failing they're never heard of again.\n\nThe frustrating aspect for the selection panel has been the failure of any young batsman, apart from Hughes, to consistently make their mark at Sheffield Shield level.\n\nBatting is the skill that will either make or break this South African tour.\n\nAustralia have a more versatile attack, they play more aggressive cricket and have a superior captain.\n\nNevertheless, all these advantages will count for nothing if the batsmen don't provide both the bowlers and captain with enough runs.\n\nIf the top order collapses continue in South Africa it'll likely end in disaster, as the home side has a more penetrative attack than England.\n\nAustralia's attack is well-suited to the local conditions as the pitches tend to suit seam bowlers.\n\nAdd to this Mitchell Johnson's explosive qualities as well as Nathan Lyon's improved off-spin and Clarke has more choices than the conservative Graeme Smith.\n\nBrad Haddin has been in such good batting form lately that his keeping is often overlooked but he's also performed well with the gloves.\n\nThe feisty keeper is another advantage Australia hold since he's a superior glove man to the incumbent AB de Villiers, or any other option South Africa might choose.\n\nWith batting being crucial to the result of the series, Australia may opt for Marsh's previous Test experience rather than gambling on debutant Doolan.\n\nClarke may also choose to start the series with Marsh at six, as he's unlikely to be troubled by spin (his weaker department), with South Africa tending to rely heavily on their seamers.\n\nMarsh's selection is a gamble and the punters' adage is you have to speculate to accumulate.\n\nIf Marsh does amass plenty of runs then the selectors' flutter may result in a surprise Australian series victory.\n\nhttp://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sp...ain-ian-chappell/story-fni2fnmo-1226810379132"
