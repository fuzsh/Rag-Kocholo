        "text": "Blues takes the lead\n\nTuesday, 27th July 2010\n\nBlues is making steady progress towards Warriors on the first day of play in the Sheffield Shield. It was the beginning of the second day, the Bules were none for 38 at the end of the day.Phillip Hughes on 14 from 35 deliveries and Phil Jaques 24 from 21 deliveries.\n\nMaking the most helpful conditions, the warriors' pace battery smashed the Bules' openers and the top order in the opening session claiming 3 wickets in the space of 55 minutes. All the three quicks Ben, Brett, Mitchell and bustling Bandy got among the wicket.\n\nopeners Jaques was given lbw by the umpire and Hughes caught at backpad. From none for 38, the Blues' were now three for 45. Tim Armstrong playing his first innings at Shield level, opened his account for the day with a couple of boundaries, one of then from an inside edge that shaved the leg stump, before he settling down to the task. Survival was the goal for Clarke in the 35 minutes remaining to lunch.\n\nThe youngster rammed soon after when he clouted successive sixes off Aaron Heal, over mid off. Clarke followed Armstrong's example with a thumping six over mid wicket off the same spinner. Blues made it to lunch at 3 for 122 with Clarke unbeaten 48 and Armstrong 19.\n\nArmstrong added 19 to his score when his ambitions got the better of him and he holed out to Hussey at gully to give the left-arm fast Johnson his second wicket of the match. Like Armstrong, Henriques was given a caught at gully by the same bowler. Haddin the 32-year-old, combined with Clarke to swing the momentum in the second session Blues' way. They were particurlarly harsh on Edmondson whose last three overs cost 31 runs.\n\nIt was Clarke who set fifty with four boundaries and a six, in the other hand Haddin with 21 off 23 deliveries. Inform paceman, Johnson was best with 3-31. Haddin looked good as he smashed three boundaries and a big six off Bandy in his 32 when the shadow of tea that hit at the pair's growing confidence.\n\nIt was the reintoduction of pace with the new ball due that brought Haddin undone when Heal rattled his leg stump. Three figures were there for the taking for O'Keefe, but he wasn't prepared to wait. He returned to the team after missing the first odi match. He and the captain Clarke combined for important partnership of 68 for the seventh wicket. a quickfire 52 in just 32 minutes from O'Keefe, helped Blues to take the lead of 24 runs. Clarke Innings, which included nine boundaries and three glorious sixes made 84 off 165 balls. O'Keefe Attempting to drive a delivery from North that was way too short, he succeeded only in spooning it to a driving Pomersbach at mid off.\n\nO'Keefe didn't last much longer than Clarke as he was bowled for 89, to leave New South Wales at 8 for 294. Then Lee and Starc then fought had to put 24 for nineth wicket, but that came to an end when Lee was bowled for 11. Starc continued to play his shots to help Blues to a lead off 54 , but Clark couldn't stick with him.\n\nWarriors so trouble\n\nSunday, 22th August 2010\n\nHaving already conceded points to the opposition, warriors' have no chance after claimed in the first innings points with Blues. After play started 45 minutes early in the morning of day three, the warriors started pretty much like they did in they first innings, losing the opener Doropoulos for 28.\n\nBut North and Marsh went about peeling off the runs without too much bother. North held the show together with Marsh for the warriors with 50 runs stand for the third wicket. North was little bit uncomfortable to score runs as he faced 40 deliveries for just 12 runs. in terms of effectiveness, Marsh's knock was brilliant.\n\nwhile North faced 64 deliveries, he scored just 19 runs. he even took 22 balls to get off the mark, and was given a life on 8 when he subsitute Armstong spilled a dolly at cover off Lee. it was O'Keefe who finally removed Marsh for 43 from 76 deliveries, trapped in front attempting to sweep, and when a short rain interval during lunch. the warriors had moved to 2 for 87 and takes the lead to 33.\n\nWarriors' plan to build a substantial second inninngs lead. North and new partner M Hussey rode thier luck to build partnership, but it doesn't go longer Clark was too good with the bowl dismissing Hussey for the second time for a duck in this match. Hussey playing his first game of Shield after 2 years and started up with a duck. Coming in at No.5, Adam Voges cracked three boundaries in his 17, but the slash he expected to provide him was Rohrer at second slip off Starc, leaving the warriors 4 for 103.\n\nNorth and Luke Pomersbach dug in for 50 run stand in 118 minutes that was blissful to watch. Of the 148 deliveries North faced, 72 were dot balls, there were doznes of near things and at least one play and miss per over. but nothing fazed him. and the partner Luke Pomersbach played absolutely fantastic. suddenly thing looking unusual for warriors. Losing North for 31 caught at backpad off Clarke and nearly next over after the dismissal of North Pomersbach trapped lbw for 46 following Bandy for none. While the veteran Lee returned the best figures for the Blues for the 3-54, Clark (1-43), O'Keefe (1-47), Starc (1-21), Clarke (1-14) and Henriques (0-5 in 8 overs) all played their role.\n\nThe lead was just 125 and the warriors were bowled out for 218.\n\nEasy Win?\n\nWednesday, 1st September 2010\n\nChasing just 125, the warriors was bowled out for 210 in there second innings. Starting the day with none for 12 for the opening wicket, after a profitable third day, the RTA SpeedBlitz Blues were looking to score quick runs.\n\nPhillip Hughes and Phil Jaques the opening pair had added 35 run stand, when Jaques was bowled by Heal for 17 to lift the rate. Hughes carried on after the dismissal of Jaques, punishing the warrior' bowlers with this trademark lofted straight drives and fierce pull shots\n\nAlong with him Clarke (14), the pair added 50 run stand inside 25 overs. Hughes was dismissed soon after scoring his fifty. he was caught at the second slip for 51 off 56 balls with seven boundaries. Rohrer and captain Clarke then combined to steer to the lunch break at two for 97 off 34 overs and there just requie 28 to take the blues a traumatic win.\n\nClarke continued to thwart the steady warriors' attack after smashing 3 boundaries and Rohrer 12 no from 6, claimed a win in the first Sheffield against Western Warriors at the SCG.\n\nStar batsman Clarke finishes with 37, including a impressive 87 in the first innings to put the match out of reach for the warriors.\n\nA memorable outright vivtory for the blues who were on all sort of bother at 4 for 43 on the opening day."
