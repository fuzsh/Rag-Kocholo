        "text": "Australian captain Steve Smith might have collected the Allan Border Medal but it was George Bailey who stole the show after a hilarious acceptance speech at cricket's night of nights.\n\nThe Tasmanian cricketer was named the 'Domestic Player of the Year' and it wasn't long before he had the crowd in stitches after relaying the secrets behind his success.\n\nSmith found himself in hot water with Aussies fans recently after questioning the training ethic of all-rounder Glenn Maxwell but Bailey was adamant it was an approach that worked for him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I heard Smithy talking about training hard, I've gone the other way completely,\" Bailey said.\n\nGeorge Bailey plays a shot for the Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League. (AAP)\n\n\"I'm not saying this is right or wrong - choose your own path people - but at my age I've got a little daughter at home so I try and skip training as much as I can, and get home and make the big decisions about porridge or strawberries or ice cream or bedtime.\n\n\"I reckon that works just as well.\"\n\nWith the crowd on his side - including Smith who was laughing in the audience - Bailey then turned his attention to his omission from the Australian team, with his last appearance for his country coming in a T20 international last year.\n\nHe explained how being dropped from the side had prompted a pep talk from his father and was the catalyst for his unusual batting stance, where he faces towards cover.\n\nGeorge Bailey maintained his unusual batting stance was the result of a 'big misunderstanding'. (AAP)\n\n\"It's actually a big misunderstanding,\" Bailey said.\n\n\"I was shattered to be dropped from the Aussie one-day team, and no doubt the selectors realise they've made a mistake and that's ok, I had plenty of good games left in me.\n\n\"My Dad said wise words, he said 'Turn the other cheek' before you know it I was batting like that (turns around).\n\n\"It doesn't matter how you do it, just get it done.\""
