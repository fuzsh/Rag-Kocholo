        "text": "Tasmania cricket captain George Bailey \"has slammed Cricket Australia's scheduling of all Ryobi Cup games in Sydney, and says the condensed one-day tournament will affect emerging players' chances of representing their country,\" according to Chris Barrett of THE AGE. The Tigers lost by 81 runs to New South Wales on Sunday \"in the first match of the domestic season, folding to be all out for 97 as the Blues grabbed an unlikely bonus point as well.\" It \"left a sour taste in the mouth of Bailey,\" who said that NSW was being given an unfair advantage. Bailey said that \"the players and the Australian Cricketers' Association should have been consulted more on the structure of the domestic season and called on CA's cash cow, the Big Bash League, to be shortened further\" (THE AGE, 9/30)."
