We thank them for their extraordinary contributions.\n\nInducteeDate InductedInducteeDate InductedTom Horan17 Feb 2007John Chambers16 Feb 2008Harry Boyle17 Feb 2007Bob Cowper23 Mar 2012Joyce Bath17 Feb 2007Alfred Clarke23 Mar 2012Ray Steele17 Feb 2007Ian Law23 Mar 2012John Atkinson17 Feb 2007Craig Reece8 Apr 2017Jack Cahill17 Feb 2007Brian Hunt8 Apr 2017Peter McAllister16 Feb 2008Greg McLeod8 Apr 2017Frank Laver16 Feb 2008\n\nFrom the Herald Sun Feb 18th 2007\n\nHawthorn-Monash University inaugurated its hall of fame last night with a historic century by all-rounder Steve Spoljaric at its Clayton ground.\n\nSpoljaric’s 107 was the club’s first ton at its Wellington Road headquarters since moving there three seasons ago.\n\nThe Hawks were formed in 1860 as East Melbourne.\n\nAt the dinner the inductees were Australian players Harry Boyle, Tom Horan and Joyce Bath, player-administrators Ray Steele and Jack Cahill, who has been a member since 1935, and 28-year secretary John Atkinson.\n\nTom Horan – 17 Feb 2007\n\nThomas Patrick Horan (8 March 1854 — 16 April 1916) was an Australian cricketer who played for Victoria and Australia, and later became an esteemed cricket journalist under the pen name “Felix”.\n\nThe first of only two Irish-born players to play Test cricket for Australia, Horan was the leading batsman in the colony of Victoria during the pioneering years of international cricket.\n\nHe played for Australia in the game against England subsequently designated as the first Test match, before touring England with the first representative Australian team, in 1878.\n\nFour years later, he toured England for the second time and played in the famed Ashes Test match at The Oval.\n\nHoran was made a life member in 1894.\n\nHarry Boyle – 17 Feb 2007\n\nHenry Frederick (Harry) Boyle (10 December 1847 – 21 November 1907) was a leading Australian Test cricketer of the late 1870s and early 1880s.\n\nBoyle played for Victoria and had the distinction of visiting England with the three earliest Australian representative touring teams, in 1878, 1880 and 1882.\n\nThe slightly reticent Boyle was chosen as captain for the 1880 tour but a shipboard team meeting voted to replace him with the more outgoing Billy Murdoch before their arrival. An outstanding medium-pacer, Boyle’s greatest strengths were said to be the accuracy of his deliveries and his ability to probe a batsman’s weaknesses.\n\nHis bowling was considered to be particularly effective under English conditions. His achievements with the ball were often overshadowed by the exploits of his brilliant team mate, “The Demon Bowler”, Fred Spofforth.\n\nJoyce Bath – 17 Feb 2007\n\nJoyce Bath (born 27 February 1925 in Kangaroo Flat, Victoria, Australia – died 19 March 2006 in Melbourne, Australia) was an Hawthorn Ladies, Australian and Victorian cricket player. Bath played three tests for the Australia national women’s cricket team.\n\nIn 1974 Bath was made a life member of the Victorian Women’s Cricket Association.\n\nRay Steele – 17 Feb 2007\n\nRaymond ‘Ray’ Steele (19 May 1917 – 22 November 1993, educated at Scotch College, Melbourne) was an Australian rules footballer who played in the VFL from 1940 to 1943 for the Richmond Football Club.\n\nSteele played District Cricket for Hawthorn-East Melbourne between 1942 and 1949, later serving as President of the Hawthorn East Melbourne CC from 1958/59 to 1973/74 and in that season was elected President Victorian Cricket Association for 19 years and Treasurer of the Australian Cricket Board for 16 years.\n\nSteele was the manager of the Australian cricket team on its 1972 tour of England.\n\nSteele was awarded the Order of the British Empire, O.B.E. for services to cricket.\n\nJohn Atkinson – 17 Feb 2007\n\nJohn Robert Atkinson, born August 23, 1941, East Melbourne, Victoria was made a life member in 1991. He served a Honorary Secretary from 1977/78 to 2005/2006. Atkinson served as Secretary of Hawthorn East Melbourne CC, Hawthorn Waverley CC and Hawthorn Monash CC.\n\nJack Cahill – 17 Feb 2007\n\nJohn Aloysius (Jack) Cahill was Hawthorn East Melbourne Sub District First XI President and was made a Life Member in 1976. Cahill past away in the season 2009/10. He was married to Eileen who passed away in the season of 1997-98\n\nPeter MacAlister – 16 Feb 2008\n\nPeter Alexander McAlister (11 July 1869, Williamstown, Victoria – 10 May 1938, Richmond, Victoria) was an Australian cricketer who played in 8 Tests from 1904 to 1909. McAlister played 273 first XI games with Hawthorn East Melbourne\n\nHis undemocratic appointment as vice-captain-cum-treasurer of the Australian cricket team in England in 1909 irrupted latent animus between the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket and its players.\n\nAn unpopular choice, McAlister was forced to brood his way through the tour after player-appointed manager Frank Laver declined to assist him. Two years later, accordingly, the Board unilaterally repealed the players’ informal right to choose their own manager. It was this which motivated the Big Six, supported by the South Australian Cricket Association and some disgruntled members of the Melbourne Cricket Club, to pull out of the 1912 Triangular Tournament.\n\nA right-hand opening batsman, McAlister was probably more famous for his amazing 20-minute fist fight with the Australian Captain, Clem Hill, than his batting. McAlister’s opposition to the appointment of Frank Laver as manager of the 1912 team to tour England led to the sensational fracas with Hill.\n\nMcAlister was nevertheless a fine batsman who continued playing club cricket until he was 52. He devoted much of his life to the game’s welfare, serving as a state selector for 29 years and a VCA executive member for 28.\n\nFrank Laver – 16 Feb 2008\n\nFrank Jonas Laver (7 December 1869, Castlemaine, Victoria – 24 September 1919, East Melbourne, Victoria) was an Australian cricketer who played in 15 Tests from 1899 to 1909.\n\nThe son of Jonas Laver, grazier and timber merchant, and Mary Ann, née Fry, Frank Laver was the 78th player to represent Australia.\n\nHe was a right-hand batsman and right-arm medium pace bowler. In his first season with the East Melbourne Cricket Club, as a gangling six-footer from the country, he took 94 wickets and made three centuries, and held his place in the club for 25 years.\n\nIn the 1892/93 season he scored more than 1000 runs for his club, including a record 352 not out. Batting with his friend and fellow Test player Peter McAlister in 1903/04 season, Laver scored 341 in a club record score of 2 for 744 in one afternoons batting.\n\nLaver and McAlister later fell out over the management of overseas tours.\n\nJohn Chambers – 16 Feb 2008\n\nJohn Lindsay Chalmers played 148 First XI games with Hawthorn East Melbourne between 1950-51 and 1968-69 taking a break 1962-1965 due to business. Chalmers was born on 14.10.1930.\n\nA brilliant and aggressive left-handed batsman, Cocky played 27 matches for Victoria between 1949-50 and 1954-55, scoring 1457 runs at 33.11.\n\nHe hit three centuries, including a century (122) on first class debut against Tasmania at the MCG in January, 1950.\n\nCocky commenced his District Cricket career with South Melbourne in 1948-49, playing 25 matches for the Swans in two seasons before crossing to Hawthorn-East Melbourne in 1950-51.\n\nHe played 148 matches for the Hawks before retiring after the 1968-69 season.\n\nIn his 173 District matches, he scored 6,821 runs at 36.47, including 15 centuries, the highest of which was an unbeaten 209 against Richmond in 1954-55. Cocky played in two premierships with the Hawks – in 1950-51 and 1955-56.\n\nIn 1959-60, Cocky scored four successive centuries, 138 v St Kilda, 129* v Footscray, 108 v Northcote and 101 v Richmond in a hot streak of form.\n\nAfter retiring from District Cricket in 1969, Cocky continued to play for several years with the Hawks’ Sub-District sides.\n\nBob Cowper – 23 March 2012\n\nRobert Maskew Cowper (born 5 October 1940 in Kew, Melbourne, educated at Scotch College Melbourne) was an Australian Test match cricketer in the 1960s, who played Sheffield Shield cricket for Victoria and Western Australia.\n\nHe was the son of Dave Cowper, the captain of the Australia national rugby union team. Cowper was a tall, correct left-handed batsman who was dropped in the 1965-66 Ashes series for slow scoring.\n\nWhen he was recalled for the Fifth Test at Melbourne he made the first Test triple century in Australia; 307 in 727 minutes. Matthew Hayden’s 380 against Zimbabwe in 2002–03 is now the highest Test century in Australia, but Cowper’s remains the longest.\n\nAfter his triple century he was never omitted from the Test side until a hand injury forced him out of the Fifth Test in 1968. In the last 13 matches of his Test career (the 1966-67, 1967–68, and 1968 series) he scored 931 runs at 38.79 and took 31 wickets at 25.22.\n\nIn those 13 matches no other Australian player exceeded 800 runs, and only Graham McKenzie, with 49, took more wickets. Cowper was only 27 when he played his last Test, at Headingley in 1968, almost exactly four years after his first, at Headingley in 1964.\n\nHe captained Victoria to victory in the Sheffield Shield in 1969-70, then left cricket altogether to concentrate on his business career.\n\nRemarkably, he averaged an impressive 75.78 in home Tests but only 33.33 overseas. The difference of 42.45 is a Test match record. [1]\n\nSince retiring from playing, he has had a successful career in big business, and has also served as a cricket referee.\n\nAlfred Clarke – 23 March 2012\n\nAlfred (A.E.) Clark served as Honorary Secretary for 5 years 1860 to 1863 and then in 1864/65 season. Clarke was treasurer from 1869/70 to 1873/74 and was vice president on 12 occasions.\n\nBut it was as President that Clarke made his name with East Melbourne serving in that position 1885/86 to 1902/03 Clarke was elected Life Patron in 1903.\n\nIt was Clarke’ vision that sew the East Melbourne ground built and serve as the home ground for East Melbourne for many years.\n\nIan Law – 23 March 2012\n\nIn the early 1960s he played four first-class cricket matches for Victoria as a specialist batsman. Ian Kennon Law was born on 27 September 1938 in Richmond, Victoria.\n\nA left handed bat, Law captained Victoria in season 1961/62.\n\nHe was president of Hawthorn East Melbourne from 1979/80 to 1988/89.\n\nLaw played with Hawthorn East Melbourne from 1956-57 to 1972-73 and played 147 First X1 games.\n\nCraig Reece – 8 April 2017\n\nCraig arrived at the club in 1975 when his cousin, who was involved with the Hawks at the time, suggested to club officials that he could work as the scoreboard operator for a few dollars a match.\n\nThen, one day, the senior scorer was away and someone said what about that kid who does the scoreboard? He can do it and he has done it ever since.\n\nReece has always been happy to help out.\n\nHe has also been a member of Cricket Victoria’s panel of Interstate and International scorers since 1980 and has many years’ experience doing the Boxing Day test.\n\nHe has scored first-class cricket in Britain. He has written and published a number of limited edition cricket books including ‘140 years in the east – The history of the Hawks.\n\nReece was made Life Member in 1995.\n\nReece said he enjoyed his role and that the club had never done anything wrong by him, so he was happy to help out. And, such is his devotion to the club, he travels more than two hours each weekend, from his home in Euroa, to score for the Hawks.\n\nReece named Hawks greats Graham Matthews and Peter Roach as the best players had seen at the club. Peter was a great wicketkeeper and batsman and Graham was a fantastic opening batsman on uncovered wickets, its a different era.\n\nBrian Hunt – 8 April 2017\n\nBrian has worked tirelessly for the club since he joined at the inception of St John Vianney’s Cricket Club in 1975.\n\nHe won the Best Clubman award for the first four years of the club and again in 1989.\n\nIt was decided that the Best Clubman award should be named in Brian’s honour so to allow other people to win it.\n\nOver the years Brian has been barman (sometimes leaving the ground early to ensure cold beer was available for the players), Curator (Walter Galt and St. Bedes), cleaner of the clubrooms and general handyman. He also maintains the practice wicket area throughout the season as well as the off season.\n\nYou will often see Brian at the club with his head in the rubbish bin collecting the cans. The clubs trophies for the first ten years were donated by R. L. Roberts. Brian would collect the empty bottles take them to R L Roberts, “the Bottle O” and purchase the trophies with the money.\n\nBrian received Life Membership in 1985.\n\nAs an opening batsman and wicketkeeper Brian played over 250 games for the club including two premierships. He captained the lower grade teams during his time winning the batting average on a number of occasions.\n\nHis teams were affectionately known as Hunty’s Heroes. Brian will be a deserving member of the Hawk’s Hall of Fame.\n\nGreg McLeod – 8 April 2017\n\nGreg was a foundation member and committee member of the St. John Vianney’s Cricket Club in 1975 and opened the batting in the club’s first game.\n\nHe served on the committee as President (5 years), Vice President (3 years), Secretary (7), Treasurer (9) as well as general committee, social committee and match committee.\n\nHe won the Best Clubman award on seven occasions and received Life Membership in 1985.\n\nAs an opening batsman, wicketkeeper and later first slip, Greg played 246 games for the club (108 first XI games) including three premierships from 17 finals games.\n\nGreg captained the firsts, seconds and thirds during his time winning batting averages in all three grades.\n\nOne of his innovations was he started the Milo program at the club for 5-12 year olds in 2000 and this program is successfully continuing now and has become one of the clubs main revenue streams.\n\nHe was Delegate to Federal District Cricket Association for many years as well as substitute delegate with VTCA and VSDCA.\n\nWhile delegate at the FDCA he was elected to the executive and held positions as President, Secretary and Treasurer and was granted life membership of the Association in 2004.\n\nAlong with Phil O’Meara, he was a foundation member of the Walter Galt Committee of Management in 2001 and has continued as Treasurer since its inception."
