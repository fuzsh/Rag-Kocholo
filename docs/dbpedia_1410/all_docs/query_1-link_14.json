        "text": "Former Test batsman Ed Cowan has played his last match for Tasmania, admitting it had been a mistake to sign on for another 12 months with the Tigers.\n\nBut the 32-year-old, who plans to move back to Sydney citing family reasons, hasn’t ruled out the prospect of resuming his first-class career with NSW or once again playing for Australia.\n\nAn emotional Cowan told reporters on Tuesday he would not play again for Tasmania, having informed teammates on Sunday after their 10-wicket Sheffield Shield loss to NSW.\n\n“It’s time to be a family man who plays cricket rather than a cricketer with a family,” he said. “And that’s a very hard decision to make when cricket has been your No1 priority for 15 years. Times change I guess.”\n\nJust three weeks ago an eager Cowan announced he had extended by 12 months his Tigers contract, adding that he wanted to see out his playing days representing the island state.\n\n“It was probably the catalyst, actually, signing that,” he said of the contract. “I made a mistake in signing that but I didn’t realise it was a mistake until I did.”\n\nCowan said he went on to re-evaluate his priorities in life. “I’ve had a tough three weeks: very little sleep, it’s affected my cricket which has been disappointing.\n\n“I worked through ways how I could make next year work ... but at the end of the day it was going to be a compromise.\n\n“I feel very guilty that I signed that and I can’t honour it, because you are only as good as your word, but I’m also glad that it sped things up so that Tassie can look to the future.”\n\nCowan, who moved to Tasmania in 2009 after being an irregular inclusion in the Blues’ line-up, plans to take a break and said he hasn’t given much thought to his playing future.\n\n“I haven’t spoken to NSW, I don’t know what their intention is, they’ve got a very strong squad.”\n\nCowan expected that he would talk to Blues officials at some stage over coming months, but admitted that both parties might not be in a position to make a commitment.\n\n“I still desire to play Test cricket but there’s a realisation that might have gone and it’s family first from here,” he said. “I might end up playing club cricket for Sydney Uni next year and that’s the only cricket I play.”\n\nCowan made 68 on his Test debut against India in the 2011 Boxing Day Test. The highlight of his 18-Test career was his maiden century in Brisbane in 2012 against a top-line South African pace attack including Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander."
