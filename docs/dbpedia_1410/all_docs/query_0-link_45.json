        "text": "Come the 20-minute tea break at Blundstone Arena on Sunday night, Pat Cummins was confronted by a scenario he had not previously known in his brief but largely stress-free tenure as Australia Test captain to that point.\n\nEngland was not only off the mat for the first time in a mostly lopsided Vodafone Ashes contest, but seemingly on the charge having reduced their 271-run victory target by 68 in the space of just 16 overs for the loss of opener Rory Burns to the final ball before the adjournment.\n\nIn days not so far past – most notably last summer's series loss to India where Australia's performances faded and frustrations grew as the campaign wore on – the match scenario might have brought addled thinking and an inability to stick to a single strategy in the haste for opposition wickets.\n\nBut this is demonstrably a different team under Cummins' leadership.\n\nAnd when play resumed after a concise and clear chat about what was needed to stem England's push and swing momentum back Australia's way, the result was as clinical as it was swift.\n\nCummins and his men scythed through the last nine England wickets for the addition of just 56 additional runs from 116 deliveries sent down in less than two hours as Australia closed out a 4-0 series win by piling one final humiliation on their long-time foes.\n\n\"We had a really good chat, Andrew McDonald the bowling coach and (coach) Justin Langer as well,\" Cummins revealed of the tea meeting that preceded his team's 146-run win.\n\n\"I think you can get carried away under lights here that it's going to seam around everywhere, it's going to swing around corners and you get carried into bowling really full.\n\n\"It didn't feel like that was the length that was going to draw wickets, we felt that slightly back of a length (was better) and try to dry up the runs.\n\n\"So we had a really clear plan to hold just a good line and length outside off stump, put an extra fielder or two back and as soon as we did that I felt like an extra 200 runs was a long way away for the English batters if we stuck at that plan.\n\n\"No doubt bowling under lights does help, it did dart around a little bit more, but I thought we had really clear plans in that last session.\"\n\nIt's that clarity of planning – which Cummins also spoke about after the final day at Sydney where he felt his bowlers stuck to the strategy even though it netted only nine of the 10 wickets they sought – that has Australia's latest Ashes-winning skipper enthused about the future.\n\nNot just the next Test assignment, which is scheduled to come in Pakistan starting next month when Australia makes their first red-ball venture overseas since the 2019 Ashes campaign in the UK.\n\nBut Cummins also believes the experiences gained during this challenging summer (more through logistics than opposition), the seamlessness with which players swung in and out of the starting XI, and the development of talents such as Compton-Miller Medallist Travis Head and allrounder Cameron Green bodes well for an even longer stint of success.\n\nThat excitement was palpable in Cummins during his post-match media interaction last night, and he cited the manner in which his less-experienced batters counter-attacked on day one despite Australia being 3-12 on a green, seaming Hobart pitch as evidence for his confidence.\n\n\"I thought way Marnus (Labuschagne), Trav Head and Cam Green took on the game was a really good template for any conditions that are foreign to what we might expect,\" he said.\n\n\"We can be the type of team that are brave enough to take that positivity overseas if we need to, and I think that puts us in a great place.\n\n\"We had a squad of 15 players used this series, everyone brings slightly different skills and goes about it slightly differently, so I'm really excited about the upcoming Pakistan tour.\n\n\"We've played really well in Australia, it's now up to us to take that overseas.\n\n\"We haven't played a lot overseas in the last couple of years, so Pakistan, Sri Lanka (this year), India next year, England – it's all really foreign conditions to Australia.\n\n\"This is just hopefully the beginning.\n\n\"I feel like we're in a really good place, there's hopefully no imminent retirees so hopefully we're building something big for the next few years.\"\n\nThe obvious goal in that time span is the recently introduced ICC World Test Championship, the final of which is loosely pencilled in for the northern summer of 2023 prior to Australia's Ashes defence in the UK.\n\nStanding between Cummins' team and that aspiration will likely be Test series in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and India as well as planned home series against West Indies and South Africa next summer.\n\nThe new Test captain, who took over when Tim Paine stood down from the role just weeks before the opening Ashes Test in Brisbane, knows Australia's record overseas has been patchy amid a paucity of matches with just five wins from 17 offshore Tests in the past five years.\n\nAnd he also recognises it will be those away assignments, most immediately amid the steamy heat and alien pitch conditions of the subcontinent, where the seemingly seamless manner in which he's taken to the captaincy will face its harshest examination.\n\n\"I think the biggest challenges are going to be ahead,\" Cummins said. \"We're lucky we live in an age where we've got incredible support staff around who take a lot of those stresses out of what a captain might have had around strategy, man management, those kind of things.\n\n\"Probably my biggest worry in accepting the role as captain was that I'm in the team as a bowler and I want to make sure that's protected and I'm able to perform as well as I'd like.\n\n\"I think with each game I felt better at managing that.\n\n\"I could really switch off and take off the captain's hat and just be a bowler for my overs.\n\n\"Even little things around bowling changes, moving fields, in between my overs, I felt I got better at that as the series went on.\n\n\"So that's a hugely pleasing thing.\n\n\"It might be difficult in the heat, or (during) longer innings, but I feel like it's something I'm only going to get better at.\"\n\nIndeed, for all the angst and debate that accompanied the decision to ignore the convention of batting specialists in the leadership role and instead install a fast bowler as Australia Test captain, results suggest it was an outcome that amplified rather than defied history.\n\nAfter all, the only Australia Test skipper to boast a better success rate than Cummins' three wins and a draw from his first four Tests in charge was Warwick Armstrong, an allrounder.\n\nAnd having slipped comfortably into the position by overseeing a mauling of the nation's historic cricket rival, Cummins has found that balancing the duties of bowling fast alongside the tactical subtleties of captaincy are perhaps not as vexed as many wanted to believe, himself among them.\n\n\"For sure there's more scrutiny, but in terms of the actual role on the field and conversations around the changerooms and that kind of thing, it is manageable,\" he said in reflecting on his first Test series at the helm.\n\n\"It's not a helluva lot different to what I'd be having anyway as a bowler, you just have to be across a little bit more.\n\n\"The role is big and important, but it's probably not as all-encompassing as I perhaps might have thought when I first took it on.\"\n\nhttps://www.cricket.com.au/news/pat...y-success-australia-tours-pakistan/2022-01-17\n\nAustralian spinner Mitch Swepson would love to book his ticket on the tour to Pakistan in March but admits there is a degree of apprehension regarding security in the subcontinental country.\n\nThe tour is set to be Australia’s first to Pakistan for 24 years, with three Test matches, three one-dayers and a Twenty20 match slated to take place over five weeks.\n\nAustralia has only participated in “away” tours against Pakistan at neutral venues in Sri Lanka and the UAE since 1998 due to civil unrest.\n\nA terror attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team bus in Pakistan in 2009 led to almost no international cricket for a decade in Pakistan, with Zimbabwe’s two-match T20 series in 2015 the only series to be staged there in that period.\n\nThe West Indies, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and South Africa have all toured Pakistan since 2018, but New Zealand cancelled their scheduled T20 series there in September due to a security threat.\n\n“We’ve been fed bits and pieces of information on security and what it’s been like,” Swepson said.\n\n“There’s been a few tours I think over the last couple of years there with other countries so they’re feeding off that.\n\n“At the end of the day, there’s guys behind the scenes doing all the work to make sure it’s safe to go and I’m sure they won’t put us at risk if it’s not safe so we’ve got to trust those guys that are doing that job.”\n\nSwepson said peace of mind while touring Pakistan would be paramount, with the spectre of Covid looming as well.\n\n“You don’t want to have anything hanging over the back of your head while you want to be over there and perform and be in the right mental space,” he said.\n\n“You almost forget about Covid, it just adds another layer, doesn’t it? It’ll be a handful definitely, but it will just be interesting to see how it pans out.\n\n“Just excited about going somewhere else, somewhere new.”\n\nSwepson, who was part of the recent Ashes squad but failed to play a game, was hopeful that the spinner-friendly conditions in Pakistan would finally lead to his Test debut.\n\n“It would be awesome,” said Swepson.\n\n“Obviously didn’t get quite the conditions in the Ashes series to play a second spinner and that’s the way it is.\n\n“Tough team to crack into so hopefully there’s some spicy conditions for spinners when we go to Pakistan and hopefully I can get an opportunity over there.\n\n“I’m just really excited again to be around the group and I don’t want to get my hopes up too much but it would be great to get a game.\n\n“As a spinner I’m excited get over there and see some spinning decks.”\n\nhttps://www.news.com.au/sport/crick...r/news-story/69badb15ba251d6da08f8542c125c7e6\n\nAustralia will prepare for the possibility of pace-friendly Test wickets in Pakistan as March's tour looks increasingly likely to go ahead.\n\nCricket Australia's board is expected to sign off on the tour next month, its first to Pakistan since 1998.\n\nA pre-tour security reconnaissance of Pakistan late last year was largely positive, with players and staff given a preliminary briefing.\n\nPlayers are also set to be canvassed for their individual positions on whether they will tour, with Pat Cummins admitting last week he understood if players pulled out.\n\nBut selectors are planning as if the three-match series from March 3 will go ahead, as Australia hunt their first series win in Asia since 2011.\n\nOf particular note is that quicks have been the best-performing bowlers since international cricket returned to Pakistan in 2019.\n\nWhile the sub-continent has traditionally been spin friendly, Pakistan speedsters Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah have been the best bowlers in matches there.\n\n\"We don't have a great deal of information on what sort of wickets to expect,\" chief selector George Bailey told ABC Tasmania.\n\n\"We've looked at a lot of their first-class cricket. Maybe counter intuitively, it seems to favour fast bowling.\n\n\"Pakistan do have a wealth of strong fast bowlers.\n\n\"A lot of our subcontinent experience has led to thinking that the spin is going to be quite handy too.\n\n\"We're covering all bases and taking a couple of spinners and a bevy of fast bowlers just to make sure whatever conditions we do get, we're able to adapt.\"\n\nCameron Green's emergence as a genuine bowling threat in the 4-0 Ashes win could still allow Australia to play Mitchell Swepson as a second spinner, given Green could play as a third quick.\n\nThe tour of Pakistan will mark Australia's first away Test series since the 2019 Ashes, with trips to South Africa and Bangladesh postponed because of COVID-19.\n\nThe virus could still alter the team's calendar, as AAP understands three T20s in New Zealand in March could be moved to Australia.\n\nArrivals in New Zealand currently must serve 10 days in quarantine.\n\nGiven the three-match T20 series lasts just four days, that would appear unlikely to go ahead.\n\nThere is some hope isolation periods could be reduced before then.\n\nBut another option being explored is to tack the T20 games onto the end of New Zealand's tour of Australia later this month.\n\nThe two sides are due to play three ODIs between January 30 and February 5, which are likely to be played in Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney due to border and logistical issues.\n\nOne T20 match is set to follow in Canberra, but it is now possible more could be added.\n\nThose additional matches could be played before or after Sri Lanka arrive for five T20s from February 11.\n\nhttps://7news.com.au/sport/cricket/selectors-consider-pace-as-key-in-pakistan-c-5354647\n\nAustralian T20 captain Aaron Finch has locked in World Cup winner Matthew Wade as his number one wicketkeeper for upcoming internationals including the tour of Pakistan despite the Hobart Hurricanes taking the gloves off him.\n\nIt comes as Australian Cricketers’ Association CEO Todd Greenberg declared he was confident “everyone will go” to Pakistan despite some expressing concerns about travelling.\n\nIn the last four games, the Hurricanes have opted for Ben McDermott behind the stumps over the Wade, who is the Hobart captain. But with white-ball series against New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Pakistan coming up in the next couple of months, Finch moved to give him man security.\n\n“They can do what they want, I’m not fussed to be fair,” Finch said of Hobart.\n\n“How they structure up their side’s none of our business, he’ll still be the wicketkeeper for Australia in the T20s.

England will be ordering full-length mirrors by the pallet. Australia can have a quiet smirk, a few beers, pat themselves on their collective backs and look forward to touring Pakistan in March. But they cannot afford to be complacent.\n\nThe margin of victory in the Ashes was wide: 4-0 and a measly one wicket away from the sweep. England’s draw at the SCG was rain-assisted, but let’s not begrudge them a morsel of solace. Empires can be built from the scarcest of foundations, and England certainly qualify on that basis. This was the meekest performance from the oldest enemy in my recollection. They have been blanked before and have lost 19 of their past 25 Tests in Australia, but those series had fibres of resistance woven with a desire for revenge.\n\nPoliticians revel in the notion of “not wasting a good crisis”. The England and Wales Cricket Board is in more strife than Boris Johnson, so this is the prime opportunity to pivot on a humongous crisis. Good luck to them as they seek new coaches, better players and perhaps a new captain. Their system of first-class cricket has become dysfunctional as it genuflects to white-ball competitions and, in particular, the magic potion of The Hundred.\n\nCricket Australia has at times veered dangerously toward 20-over competitions and the lucre they deliver, elbowing the Sheffield Shield into a cobwebbed cornice of semi relevance. Fortunately, the excesses of sandpaper and the home loss to India have forced the Shield back to the front of mind. COVID-19 considerations apart, there has been a grudging recognition that first-class, red-ball cricket is of real importance, not just as an arena for talent to emerge, but also as the investment vehicle for the international game.\n\nScott Boland’s success came as no great surprise to those who have seen him battle though 10 seasons of Shield cricket, winning player of the year in 2019. During that time he has picked up the knowledge that he put on show this summer. He also taught a few lessons along the way. The strength of the Shield is vital to Australian Test cricket, just as the strength of County Championship is to England.\n\nCricket Australia has to concede that its board members must have among their curriculum vitae serious knowledge of the structures of the game and an idea of how it is played. Picking “independent” directors with no knowledge, and sometimes no interest, in cricket is a path to ruin.\n\nThe contrast between cricket in England and Australia is highlighted right now. You can argue about the absolute standard of the series as much as you like, but the Ashes will always command the highest level of fan intensity: 140-year-old rivalries are hard to find and harder to dismiss.\n\nEngland have a job to get better, but just how good are Australia?\n\nIt’s hard to see how Australia’s bowling could improve much. The home side won despite Josh Hazelwood missing four Tests, and began the summer with the shock international retirement of James Pattinson, widely acknowledged as the fourth man in the fast-bowling rotation. Enter Jhye Richardson, Michael Neser and then Boland. Added to that pace battery is Cameron Green, who has promised much and now looks very much like delivering. Green’s batting grew as the series progressed: his 74 in Hobart was as commanding as it was crafted. His three wickets in the second innings precipitated the English demise, just as they found a sliver of hope.\n\nGreen, as the genuine all-rounder, will make the team balance even more palatable when they go to Pakistan. It will be late season in March and the pitches are more likely to spin, giving Mitchell Swepson the opportunity he has been denied the past two summers at the SCG where Australia have not won. Nathan Lyon and Swepson together would have won both those contests, but when coach and selectors don’t have the knowledge or the gumption to change the team balance for the prevailing conditions then there can be no blaming players or late declarations.\n\nWinning at home on seaming pitches with an all-time great bowling attack is terrific. Winning away from home will require deeper thinking.\n\nTravis Head and Usman Khawaja were just about even money for the first Test in Brisbane and those odds proved correct. The two lefties were outstanding. Now their challenge becomes taking on bowlers on lower and slower surfaces with spin dominating. If you get past Shaheen Afridi, Hasan Ali and Haris Rauf then tweakers Shadab Khan and Nauman Ali will examine their footwork.\n\nSteve Smith, David Warner and Marnus Labuschagne did not dominate England, but the pitches were bowler-friendly, and that was England’s “strength”. Smith, Warner and Labuschagne did what they had to to scrape together winning totals. Making centuries is great for the scrapbook but holding the Ashes was the main game. All three have plenty of runs left in them, but Pakistan will serve up a good contest in speed and spin.\n\nMarcus Harris promised a bit, delivered a bit and was dropped for batsmen in top form. He will get a trip away because the glaring weakness in Australian cricket is at the top of the order. Harris has shown that he can play long innings in Shield cricket; the trick is taking that to the next level.\n\nSmith is 32 and has plenty of cricket to come. The opening pair in the final Test of the Ashes, Warner and Khawaja, were each 35 years old and that should raise warning flags. Henry Hunt, Bryce Street and Harris need opportunities, and who knows what will ever become of Will Pucovski?\n\nWicketkeeper Alex Carey has Josh Inglis circling in the shallow waters, and that is a good thing for competitive pressure.\n\nQuite rightly the current team should be congratulated; they were way above the fight presented by England. The next challenge is only six weeks away and promises a sterner examination and, therefore, a clearer perspective of just how good the Ashes thrashing was.\n\nhttps://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricke...lot-more-about-australia-20220122-p59qci.html\n\nAustralian selector George Bailey may as well join the circus, because his job in the next 12 months is going to require one of the all-time balancing acts.\n\nAfter a fantastic 4-0 Ashes victory over England on home soil, Australia will now turn their attention to a five-game T20 series against Sri Lanka next month.\n\nThe squad was announced on Tuesday afternoon, with 16 players named - but there were some notable names missing.\n\nDespite their performances in the recent T20 World Cup, David Warner and Mithell Marsh have both been rested, with selectors looking ahead to the upcoming Test tour of Pakistan.\n\nSpeaking to the media on Tuesday, Bailey spoke about the absence of Marsh from the upcoming T20 series, as well as the promising signs before the three-game series in March.\n\n“I believe the boards are still working through some of the minor details around that tour,\" Bailey said.\n\n\"Once that gets the formal tick of approval, we will announce the squad. We are reasonably well down the track. The two briefings I have sat in on, the security sounds very robust and very thorough.\n\n\"We are taking him (Marsh) through what the rest of the year looks like in terms of tours coming up and trying to find times for players to get some rest and rejuvenation.\n\n\"I really feel for the Western Australian contingent at the moment and their struggle to actually get that time at home.\"\n\nBailey also denied any player has said they won't be available for Pakistan, despite potential concerns over security as well as bubble fatigue.\n\nAfter the Test series in Pakistan, Australia will also be away for tours of Sri Lanka (June-July) and India (September), before a home T20 World Cup defence in October and home Test series next summer.\n\nIt makes the job of Bailey - who didn't put a foot wrong during The Ashes - extremely difficult.\n\nOn top of that, Australian selectors will have to deal with the ongoing COVID dramas across the country, with no certainties surrounding the return of Sheffield Shield cricket.\n\n“Whether we need to or not, I’m not entirely sure what opportunity we will get,\" he said.\n\n\"The one thing we have to be really okay with is, we have to accept what we get at the moment and be flexible.\n\n\"One of the great things and one of the reasons we performed so well in The Ashes, is because we had a number of players get a fair bank of Shield cricket in before Christmas.\n\n\"Whether it’s before Pakistan or not, you’d certainly hope there is an opportunity for some Shield cricket at some stage.\"\n\nThe potential lack of Shield cricket heading into three massive overseas Test tours is a difficult hoop for Bailey to jump through - but it's also difficult for players vying for selection.\n\nBailey admitted that players like Marsh and Glenn Maxwell 'would not be precluded' for Test appearances, despite a lack of red-ball cricket.\n\n“There’s a number of players – I think Glenn Maxwell, Mitch Marsh, Ashton Agar and Mitch Swpeson are a handful of guys off the top of my head who have, due to the nature of scheduling, played a lot of one format and not as much of another,\" he said.\n\n\"They are still working hard at their game, and I know the three formats are incredibly different, but there are some skillsets that do cross-over.\n\n\"If the opportunity arises and we do see fit, we certainly won’t preclude them.\"\n\nOne man who won't be on the plane to Pakistan however is fast bowler Jhye Richardson.\n\nThe 25-year-old will play in the upcoming T20 series against Sri Lanka, but will be rested for the Test series as he continues to manage a previous shoulder injury.\n\n“Each player – Jhye is no different – is dealt with on an individual level,\" Bailey said.\n\n\"Jhye is highly talented across all formats, he is a player we have long-term expectations and hopes for.\n\n\"He still hasn’t played a huge amount of cricket since coming back from the injuries he has had over the past couple of years, so we are making sure he gets the opportunity to build up the way he needs to is really important.\n\n\"I think Jhye will be comfortable and get enough cricket.\"\n\nhttps://www.sportingnews.com/au/cri...marsh-david-warner/1v20knym8f10u1qq98unt9isxb\n\nNo Australia player has indicated they want to opt out of touring Pakistan with selectors \"well down the track\" to finalising a Test squad, despite uncertainty about the resumption of the Marsh Sheffield Shield season.\n\nNational selector George Bailey said today he believed security plans were \"very, very robust and very, very thorough\" after multiple briefings for what would be the first Australian tour of the country since Mark Taylor's men visited in 1998.\n\n\"I believe the boards are still working through some of the minor details around that tour, so once that gets the formal tick of approval then we'll announce the squad post that, but we're reasonably well down the track,\" Bailey told reporters today.\n\nThe Test squad will largely pick itself following the successful 4-0 drubbing of England in this summer's Ashes series, with the emergence of Scott Boland as a reliable workhorse allowing selectors to rest Jhye Richardson.\n\nAllrounder Mitch Marsh can be locked in for the touring party after he was rested from next month's Dettol T20 series, as was opener David Warner.\n\nLess clear is how much Shield cricket selectors will have to see to finalise their squad, with the Western Australia border situation further complicating matters.\n\nAn 11-day break after the KFC BBL final, as per previous years, would see Shield cricket resuming about February 9.\n\nThat would seem to allow a maximum of two Shield rounds before the Australian squad would likely depart in the last week of February ahead of a Test series scheduled to begin on March 3 in Karachi.\n\n\"Whether we need to (see any Shield cricket) or not, I'm not entirely sure what opportunity we will get,\" Bailey said today.\n\n\"But the one thing that I think we have to be really just okay with is that we've got to accept what we get at the moment and be flexible.\n\n\"I think one of the great things and possibly one of the reasons the players performed so well in the Ashes was there were a number of players who got a good bank of Shield cricket in prior to that series.\n\n\"Whether it's for Pakistan or not, you'd certainly hope that there is an opportunity for some Shield cricket at some stage just because of the competition and to continue to see guys improving and getting the opportunity to show their wares.\"\n\nTravis Head was today named in Australia's T20 squad to face Sri Lanka on the back of his outstanding performances in the Ashes series, and Bailey said there was no reason the reverse couldn't be true with in-form white-ball players pushing for spots on overseas tours.\n\n\"I know that the three formats are incredibly different but there are skillsets that do cross over, so if the opportunity arises and we do see a fit, then it certainly won't preclude (selection),\" Bailey said.\n\n\"There's a number of players – Glenn Maxwell, Mitch Marsh, Ash Agar, Mitch Swepson off the top of my head who, just through the nature of scheduling and different opportunities, have played a lot of one format and not as much of another.\"\n\nBailey said the plight of the Western Australian contingent was a concern for selectors following that state's government pushing back its plans to reopen its border to the eastern states.\n\nCA and the WACA are working through plans with individual players to get some time at home and some rest but many face the prospect of not being able to return home again for several months.\n\n\"Some I believe are planning to get home as soon as they can, some I believe are working on plans to stay on the eastern seaboard and remain able to move about and have a few more freedoms,\" Bailey said.\n\n\"It just depends on whether some of those guys are planning to be in Pakistan, whether some have got a bit of a longer break at home as well.\n\n\"Trying to find times for players to get some rest, some physical rejuvenation, whether that be in the gym, some mental rejuvenation (is important).\n\n\"I really feel for the Western Australian contingent at the moment and their struggle to actually to get that time at home.\"\n\nFoxtel, Kayo to broadcast Pakistan tour\n\nMeanwhile, Foxtel has inked a deal with the Pakistan Cricket Board for Fox Cricket and Kayo Sports to broadcast Australia's drought-breaking tour in March, as well as the next two seasons of the Pakistan Super League.\n\nThe deal gives subscribers to Foxtel or Kayo Sports certainty more than five weeks out from the opening Test that they will be able to watch Pat Cummins lead Australia in their first Test match on Pakistani soil since 1998.\n\nThe early deal is a welcome change of pace from Foxtel's recent habit of striking last-minute deals for Australia's away tours, although it does come less than 48 hours before the opening match of this year's PSL in Karachi. In addition to the PSL this year and next, the deal includes all Pakistan's home matches until April 2023 to be broadcast on Foxtel and Kayo.\n\nQantas Tour of Pakistan 2022\n\nMarch 3-7: First Test, Karachi\n\nMarch 12-16: Second Test, Rawalpindi\n\nMarch 21-25: Third Test, Lahore\n\nMarch 29: First ODI, Lahore\n\nMarch 31: Second ODI, Lahore\n\nApril 2: Third ODI, Lahore\n\nApril 5: Only T20, Lahore\n\nThe 15th edition of the India Premier League (IPL) in 2022 is set to get underway in the last week of March. The T20 league though will coincide with Australia’s cricket tour of Pakistan which starts of March 3.\n\nThe IPL 2022 which will be a 10-team affair and will run till the end of May this year may see Australian star cricketers like Glenn Maxwell, Steve Smith and Pat Cummins may leave the Pakistan tour early.\n\nAustralian national selector George Bailey has clarified that IPL-bound players will be allowed to go home in the middle of the series before flying to India to participate in the mega event.\n\n“Absolutely it’s tough for the multi-format guys to work out that balance of where they do get time to physically replenish their energy reserves. Particularly for fast bowlers (around) when they get the time to make sure that they fit and strong and able to deal with the workload. But that’s part and parcel of the modern cricketers’ life”, said Bailey.\n\nThe former Australian ODI skipper said that while the players are handsomely rewarded for being a part of the cash-rich league, they will also get to learn a lot from the best players across the globe.\n\n“It continues to be a tournament that offers a huge amount for players both from a learning perspective and I don’t think the monetary side of things can be discounted. For a reasonably brief period of work the payday is pretty enormous for a certain percentage of them”, he said.\n\n“But I do think more so than that is the opportunity to play with the best players around the world and to have access to a different range of coaches. I think that’s a terrific opportunity,” Bailey added.\n\nAustralian cricketers are on edge barely a month before their first tour of Pakistan in 24 years amid an uptick in terror attacks in the Asian nation, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on Wednesday (August 26). “We’re all toey about it,” a source close to the team told the newspaper, using an informal Australian term for being anxious or worried.\n\nAustralia are scheduled to play three Tests, three one-day internationals and one Twenty20 match in Pakistan starting March 3. Selector Bailey told reporters on Wednesday that security arrangements would be ‘very, very robust and very, very thorough’.\n\n“I believe the boards are still working through some of the minor details around that tour, so once that gets the formal tick of approval then we`ll announce the squad post that, but we`re reasonably well down the track,” he added.\n\nAustralia has not toured Pakistan since 1998 due to security concerns, instead playing its away matches in the United Arab Emirates. Though some international touring sides have returned to Pakistan in recent years, New Zealand abruptly halted a tour there in September citing security issues and England shortly afterwards cancelled a planned tour.\n\n(with Reuters inputs)\n\nhttps://zeenews.india.com/cricket/b...ay-leave-tour-early-for-ipl-2022-2430863.html\n\nWest Australian Test hopefuls Josh Inglis, Mitch Marsh and Ashton Agar will not get the chance to play any red ball cricket before the Pakistan tour.\n\nAll three are in the frame for the three-Test series, which begins in Karachi on March 3.\n\nBut WA’s Sheffield Shield season will not resume until the borders open, meaning their selection hopes rest on white ball and training form.\n\nFox Cricket understands the Shield season is slated to recommence on February 9, though this is not locked in yet.\n\nStates are yet to be formally told where the fixtures will be and who they will be against, though Victoria and NSW have already played each other three times, which is the maximum under protocols agreed upon last year.\n\nTo constitute a season, each state must play seven matches, including at least one against every other team and no more than three.\n\nSouth Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland have all played five matches, while NSW and Victoria have a busy month ahead after notching just the three games so far.\n\nOnce each team has played seven, a final will be scheduled between the top two sides, likely in late March.\n\nBecause WA won’t play until at least early March, it means one other state will also have to miss out on a game while the other four states go up against one another.\n\n“I really feel for the Western Australian contingent at the moment and their struggle to actually get that time at home,” Australia’s chairman of selectors George Bailey said earlier this week.\n\nHe added: “There’s a number of players – I think Glenn Maxwell, Mitch Marsh, Ashton Agar and Mitch Swpeson are a handful of guys off the top of my head who have, due to the nature of scheduling, played a lot of one format and not as much of another.\n\n“They are still working hard at their game, and I know the three formats are incredibly different, but there are some skillsets that do cross over.\n\n“If the opportunity arises and we do see fit, we certainly won’t preclude them.”\n\nWhile Cricket Australia works through the remainder of the Sheffield Shield season, states are waiting on answers around the WNCL and the March Cup.\n\nThe immediate futures of both are unclear. In the WNCL, South Australia and Western Australia are yet to play a match.\n\nhttps://www.foxsports.com.au/cricke...h/news-story/f2586326e1772c60bfe476cc98da2b5a\n\nAustralia remain confident a near full-strength squad will tour Pakistan with only a few players still holding security fears.\n\nCricket Australia's board is expected to approve its first tour to the country in 24 years on Friday, happy with the pre-trip security briefing.\n\nThere were suggestions as recently as last week there was trepidation from some players over the trip, after a reported recent rise in terror attacks.\n\nBut captain Pat Cummins on Thursday confirmed most players were comfortable with the tour going ahead, while understanding and accepting a few may not make the trip.\n\n\"I think we'll get close to a full-strength squad,\" Cummins said.\n\n\"There is still a little bit of work to do. We have received a lot of information and it has been great.\n\n\"All the pre-tour security and biosecurity work has been done and it's been fantastic.\n\n\"There are a couple of players still keen to get a bit more information but everyone is really pumped and feeling relatively comfortable.\n\n\"If anyone doesn't make the tour it is absolutely okay, we will back them for sure.\"\n\nCummins comments come after fellow quick Josh Hazlewood told cricket.com.au he wouldn't be surprised if some players didn't make the tour.\n\nAustralia's players are scheduled to leave the country in a little over three weeks, ahead of the first Test in Karachi from March 3.\n\nMatches will follow in Rawalpindi and Lahore provided CA approves of the current schedule.\n\nCummins admitted he was unsure how selectors would squeeze down the Test XI, with Scott Boland making a case to keep his spot in the fast-bowling cartel.\n\nHazlewood is also due back from injury, while Australia have already made the call to rest Jhye Richardson.\n\nComplicating the matter further is uncertainty around the resumption of the Sheffield Shield before the tour, with Western Australia's closed border threatening to leave them sidelined.\n\nSelectors are also unsure whether to pick a squad for traditional spinning subcontinent wickets or greener decks, with Pakistan's best bowlers since returning home mostly quicks.\n\n\"I thought about it yesterday for the first time and thought that will be a tough decision,\" Cummins said.\n\n\"They usually have a way of working themselves out.\n\n\"We'll have a squad of 15 who did really well in the Ashes. Crystal ball, I have no idea.\n\n\"I don't even know what the wickets are going to look like over there.\"\n\nhttps://7news.com.au/sport/cricket/most-aust-stars-happy-to-tour-pakistan-c-5554898"
