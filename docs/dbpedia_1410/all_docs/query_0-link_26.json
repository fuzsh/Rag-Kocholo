        "text": "Cricket Australia (CA), formerly known as the Australian Cricket Board (ACB), is the governing body for professional and amateur cricket in Australia. It was originally formed in 1905 as the 'Australian Board of Control for International Cricket'. It is incorporated as an Australian Public Company, limited by guarantee.\n\nCricket Australia operates all of the Australian national representative cricket sides, including the Men's, Women's and Youth sides, along with various other national teams (such as Indigenous, disability or over-age teams) in conjunction with the relevant organisations. CA is also responsible for organising and hosting Test matches, one day internationals and T20 internationals in association with other nations, and scheduling home international fixtures.\n\nBackground\n\nCricket Australia is an administrative organisation responsible for cricket in Australia. Cricket Australia has six member organisations that represent each of the Australian states. These organisations are:\n\nNew South Wales – Cricket NSW\n\nQueensland – Queensland Cricket\n\nSouth Australia – South Australian Cricket Association\n\nTasmania – Cricket Tasmania\n\nVictoria – Cricket Victoria\n\nWestern Australia – Western Australian Cricket\n\nCricket ACT and Northern Territory Cricket are non-member associations, although the ACT participates in Cricket Australia tournaments such as the Women's National Cricket League and the Futures League, and previously briefly also competed in the domestic limited-overs competition.\n\nCricket Australia is governed by nine independent directors. The chief executive officer reports to the board of directors.\n\nEach state cricket association that are members of Cricket Australia also selects a representative side to participate in Australia's various major domestic cricket tournaments every season.\n\nDomestic teams, playing national tournaments\n\nState Men's side Team name Women's side Team name New South Wales New South Wales Men's Cricket Team Blues New South Wales Women's Cricket Team Queensland Queensland Men's Cricket Team Bulls Queensland Women's Cricket Team Fire South Australia South Australia Men's Cricket Team Southern Redbacks South Australia Women's Cricket Team Scorpions Tasmania Tasmania Men's Cricket Team Tigers Tasmania Women's Cricket Team Roar Victoria Victoria Men's Cricket Team Bushrangers Victoria Women's Cricket Team Western Australia Western Australia Men's Cricket Team Warriors Western Australia Women's Cricket Team Territory Men's side Women's side Australian Capital Territory Australian Capital Territory Men's Cricket Team Comets Australian Capital Territory Women's Cricket Team Meteors Northern Territory Northern Territory Men's Division Northern Territory Women's Division\n\nCricket Australia also maintains a healthy but independent association with the Australian Cricketers' Association to provide proper player's rights, welfare requirements and pay agreements.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first centralised authority for the administration of cricket in Australia was established in 1892 when representatives from the state associations of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria came together to establish the Australasian Cricket Council. However the Australasian Cricket Council was disbanded in 1898, and what is now known as Cricket Australia was established in 1905 as the \"Australian Board of Control for International Cricket\". Before its establishment, tours by Australian teams to England were organised and funded by private groups or by the players themselves. Similarly, invitations to English teams were made by private promoters or by individual clubs, such as the Melbourne Cricket Club. The Australasian Cricket Council's one lasting action was to establish the Sheffield Shield, the first-class cricket competition between the Australian colonies.\n\nThese early tours were lucrative for the players and promoters and cricket administrators looked to find ways to channel some of this money to the destitute clubs, through the state associations. Formal discussions began in January 1905 in Sydney for the formation of a body to take control of tours from the players. A draft constitution was discussed by members of the New South Wales, Victoria, South Australian and Queensland associations. The first meeting of the new board was held at Wesley College in Melbourne on 6 May 1905.\n\nThe foundation members were the New South Wales Cricket Association and the Victorian Cricket Association. South Australia's delegates refused to join the Board because the Board structure denied the players any representation. The Queensland Cricket Association was represented as an observer only.\n\nQueensland did decide to formally join the association with one delegate member the following year, and the constitution was amended in 1906, so that New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria would each have three permanent representatives, and Queensland one representative. In 1907 Tasmania was permitted to send a single representative, and Western Australia did likewise in 1913. Changes to this structure were made in 1914 and 1974 respectively when Queensland and Western Australia formally increased their representation to two each.\n\nIn 2001, Cricket Australia established the National Indigenous Cricket Advisory Committee (NICAC), which in 2002 established a strategic plan, \"Two Cultures: Australia's New Cricket Tradition\". Ngadjuri man Vince Copley was the inaugural co-chair of the committee.\n\nName changes\n\nCricket Australia has operated under three different names since its foundation. They are:\n\nAustralian Board of Control for International Cricket (ABC) (1905–1973)\n\nAustralian Cricket Board (ACB) (1973–2003)\n\nCricket Australia (CA) (2003–present)\n\nFinances\n\nThe organisation's revenue was A$380.9 million in the financial year ended 30 June 2015, with a net surplus of $99 million largely attributed to the success of co-hosting the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup.\n\nCompetitions\n\nAs well as responsibility for Australian international sides, Cricket Australia organises interstate cricket in Australia, including the premier competitions in each of the major forms of the game. These are the Marsh Sheffield Shield in first-class cricket (men's competition only), the Marsh One-Day Cup (men) and the Women's National Cricket League, which are the domestic one-day competitions, and the KFC Big Bash League and the Weber Women's Big Bash League, which are the domestic Twenty20 competitions (contested by franchises not state representative teams).\n\nCricket Australia's current and former competitions:\n\nMarsh Sheffield Shield (first-class, various forms, 1892/93-present)\n\nMarsh One-Day Cup (limited-overs, various forms, 1969/70-present)\n\nKFC Twenty20 Big Bash (T20, 2005/06-2010/11, replaced by KFC BBL)\n\nKFC Big Bash League (T20, 2011/12-present)\n\nToyota Second XI (red-ball, various forms, 1999/2000-2008/09, 2019/20-present, 2009/10-2018/19 as Futures League)\n\nAustralian Women's Cricket Championships (first-class and limited-overs, various forms, 1930/31-1995/96, replaced by WNCL)\n\nWomen's National Cricket League (limited-overs, various forms, 1996/97-present)\n\nAustralian Women's Twenty20 Cup (T20, various forms, 2007-2014/15, replaced by WBBL)\n\nWeber Women's Big Bash League (T20, 2015/16-present, 2015/16-2020/21 as rebel WBBL)\n\nCricket Australia also runs (among others) the Under 19 and Under 17 Male Championships, the Under 18 and Under 15 Female National Championships, the National Indigenous Cricket Championships and the National Cricket Inclusion Championships.\n\nHonours\n\nCricket Australia also provides awards for various categories of players, including:\n\nMale: Test Player of the Year, One-Day Player of the Year, Bradman Young Player of the Year, Domestic Player of the Year, and the Allan Border Medal for the overall best Australian men's cricketer of the year.\n\nFemale: the Belinda Clark Award for the best Australian women's cricketer of the year, the Betty Wilson Young Player of the Year, and the Domestic Player of the Year\n\nCricket Australia also honours players for exceptional service to the game of cricket in Australia by annually adding former players of great distinction to the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame.\n\nPrincipals / Chairman of Cricket Australia\n\nChairmen\n\nRichard Teece: 1892–1893\n\nRichard Best: 1893–1895\n\nMostyn Evan: 1895–1896; 1910–1911\n\nJohn Gibson: 1896–1897\n\nWill Whitridge: 1897–1900\n\nLawrence Adamson: 1905–1906\n\nErnie Bean: 1906–1907; 1912–1913\n\nGeorge Barbour: 1907–1908\n\nGeorge Foxton: 1908–1910\n\nCharles Eady: 1911\n\nWilliam McElhone: 1911–1912\n\nJames Allen: 1913–1914\n\nHarry Blinman: 1914–1919\n\nHarold Bushby: 1919; 1925–1926\n\nHarry Gregory: 1919–1920; 1922–1923; 1926–1927\n\nHarry Rush: 1920–1922\n\nJack Hutcheon: 1923–1924\n\nBernard Scrymgour: 1924–1925\n\nAubrey Oxlade: 1927–1930; 1933–1936; 1945–1948; 1951–1952\n\nAllen Robertson: 1930–1933; 1936–1945; 1948–1951\n\nRoy Middleton: 1952–1955\n\nFrank Cush: 1955–1957\n\nBill Dowling: 1957–1960\n\nSir Donald Bradman: 1960–1963; 1969–1972\n\nEwart Macmillan: 1963–1966\n\nBob Parish: 1966–1969; 1975–1978\n\nTim Caldwell: 1972–1975\n\nPhil Ridings: 1980–1983\n\nFred Bennett: 1983–1986\n\nMalcolm Gray: 1986–1989\n\nColin Egar: 1989–1992\n\nAlan Crompton: 1992–1995\n\nDenis Rogers: 1995–2001\n\nRobert Merriman: 2001–2005\n\nCreagh O'Connor: 2005–2008\n\nJack Clarke: 2008–2011\n\nWally Edwards: 2011–2015\n\nDavid Peever: 2015–2018\n\nEarl Eddings: 2018–2021\n\nRichard Freudenstein: 2021–2022 (interim)\n\nLachlan Henderson: 2022–present\n\nMike Baird: 2023– (incoming)\n\nSecretaries & Chief Executive Officers\n\nJohn Portus: 1892–1896\n\nJohn Creswell: 1896–1900\n\nWilliam McElhone: 1905–1910\n\nColin Sinclair: 1910–1911\n\nSydney Smith: 1911–1927\n\nWilliam Jeanes: 1927–1954\n\nJack Ledward: 1954–1960\n\nAlan Barnes: 1960–1980\n\nDavid Richards: 1980–1993\n\nGraham Halbish: 1993–1997\n\nMalcolm Speed: 1997–2001\n\nJames Sutherland: 2001–2018\n\nKevin Roberts: 2018–2020\n\nNick Hockley: 2020–present\n\nNational Selection Panel\n\nFor a list of national selectors, see Australian cricket selectors.\n\nThe National Selection Panel is the part of Cricket Australia responsible for team selections for each of the Australian national sides in every form of cricket.\n\nThe current three-man panel for the Australian men's sides is: George Bailey (chairman), Andrew McDonald (head coach) and Tony Dodemaide.\n\nThe current four-person panel for the Australia women's sides is: Shawn Flegler (chairman), Matthew Mott (head coach), Avril Fahey and Julie Hayes.\n\nBoard of directors\n\nCricket Australia is governed by nine directors, who work collectively in the national interest of Australian cricket.\n\nThe chief executive officer reports to the board of nine directors.
