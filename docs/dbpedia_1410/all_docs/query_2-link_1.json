        "text": "Overview of sports traditions and activities in Tasmania\n\nSport is a significant aspect of the culture on the island state of Tasmania, Australia. Outside general recreational activities such as walking, gym or bushwalking, the most popular sports in Tasmania are swimming, athletics/track and field, cycling/mountain biking, golf and Australian rules football. Netball ranks as the most popular team sport for female participation, while cricket leads among male participants. The most widely played team sport is soccer, with an estimated 36,773 Tasmanians, comprising 6.8% of the state’s population, participating annually.[3]\n\nIn 2009, Tasmania's most watched sports were Australian rules football, motor sports and horse racing,[4] however there has been a sharp increase in basketball attendance since the addition of the Tasmania JackJumpers in the National Basketball League commencing in the 2021–22 NBL season.[5] Other current professional franchises in national competitions include the Tasmania cricket team, the Hobart Hurricanes (Big Bash League) and the Tassie Tigers (Hockey One). The Tasmania Football Club was founded in 2022 and is set to compete in the Australian Football League (AFL) from the 2028 season. A-League expansion in Tasmania has been proposed since the establishment of the A-League in 2005. Major sporting events on the Tasmanian calendar are the Royal Hobart Regatta, Hobart International, Hobart Cup, Tasmanian Derby, Targa Tasmania and the conclusion of the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race in Hobart.\n\nAccording to the 2023 Sports Australia AusPlay survey, 78% of Tasmanian adults and 33% of Tasmanian children engage in some form of sport or physical activity at least once per week. While adult participation is on par with the national average, figures for child participation are significantly below the national average of 52%.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2020/21, the Tasmanian Government allocated nearly $2,000,000 (AUD) in funding for organised sports, primarily focusing on Australian rules football, basketball, cricket, and soccer. Additionally, $1,000,000 (AUD) has been earmarked for a participation program aimed at children, with supplementary grants and funding opportunities also available.[8]\n\nBat-and-ball games\n\n[edit]\n\nBaseball\n\n[edit]\n\nBaseball Tasmania is the governing body of baseball in the Australian Baseball Federation. The first Australian championships were held in Hobart in 1910 between Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales, and won by the latter.[9] The sport became more structured with the formation of the Tasmanian Baseball Association in 1950.[10] Although the sport saw significant growth during the 1970s and mid-1980s, the Launceston League disbanded by the late 1980s due to declining player numbers. The Tasmanian Baseball Association operated until the early 1990s before financial issues led to its collapse.[11] A revival began in the early 2000s, partly due to the involvement of former players in Masters baseball. In 2007, baseball returned to Hobart under the name Baseball Tasmania, which was later rebranded as the Hobart Summer Baseball League in the 2013/14 season. The league season runs from mid-October to mid-March, with games held at Prince of Wales Bay Recreation Ground and other locations. The league expanded from four to five teams in 2013/14 and has actively participated in the Victorian Masters Baseball Carnival.[11]\n\nCricket\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Cricket Tasmania Premier League\n\nTasmania is an integral part of Australian cricket. Prominent players from Tasmania include David Boon, Charles Eady, John Marshall, Laurie Nash, and Ricky Ponting.\n\nCricket Tasmania administers the Tasmanian Grade Cricket competitions of cricket in Tasmania, and selects the players for the Tasmanian Tigers, who are the state's first class cricket team for men. They are also responsible for the selection of players for Tasmanian Roar, the state's women's representative side. The Tasmanian Tigers are based at Blundstone Arena and represent the state in domestic competitions such as the One-Day Cup and Sheffield Shield. Blundstone Arena also hosts international matches (Tests and One Day matches) of the Australian cricket team and touring sides.\n\nTasmania’s cricketing history is reflected in its diverse range of venues, from historic grounds like the NTCA Ground (established in 1851) and TCA Ground (established in 1882) to contemporary stadiums like Blundstone Arena and University of Tasmania Stadium. These venues have been instrumental in fostering the growth of cricket in the state and continue to host important matches and events.\n\nCricket likely arrived in Van Diemen's Land with its earliest settlers.[12] The Rev. Robert Knopwood mentioned the game in a diary entry from 1814, and it was well established in Hobart and Launceston by the 1820s. By the 1830s, cricket was played in various settlements across the island. Clubs in Hobart and Launceston soon followed. In 1851, Van Diemen's Land won Australia's first intercolonial match against the Port Phillip District.\n\nAlthough English touring teams included the Colony of Tasmania in the following years, matches were often uneven, with Tasmania fielding extra players to level the competition. These early matches were sporadic and largely informal compared to modern standards. Regular eleven-a-side matches with mainland colonies resumed in 1889, but Tasmania was left out of early efforts to form a national cricket administration in the 1890s.[12]\n\nThroughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Tasmanian cricket developed steadily, though the team faced challenges due to geographic isolation and limited opportunities for competitive play against other colonies. Economic difficulties constrained Tasmanian cricket until after the Second World War, and attempts to join national competitions in the 1930s were unsuccessful. It wasn’t until the 1977-78 season that Tasmania was admitted into the Sheffield Shield on a full-time basis, allowing the team to compete regularly against other states in Australia’s premier domestic competition. The inclusion in the Sheffield Shield marked a significant turning point for Tasmanian cricket. It led to improvements in infrastructure, player development, and overall competitiveness.[12]\n\nFirst-class and List A cricket\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Tasmania cricket team\n\nThe Tasmanian Tigers have achieved significant success in the 21st century, winning multiple Sheffield Shield and One-Day Cup titles. They have produced several prominent cricketers who have excelled both domestically and internationally, maintaining their status as a competitive force in Australian domestic cricket. Tasmania has won the Sheffield Shield three times (2006-07, 2010-11, 2012-13) and have finished as runners-up on several occasions, most recently in the 2023–24 Sheffield Shield season. The Tigers have won the One-Day Cup domestic one-day competition four times (1978-79, 2004-05, 2007-08, 2009-10).\n\nHistorical players include David Boon, known for his solid batting at the international level, Ricky Ponting, one of the greatest batsmen in cricket history, Shane Watson, an all-rounder who has had a significant impact both domestically and internationally, George Bailey, a reliable middle-order batsman and former captain of both Tasmania and the Twenty20 Australia national cricket team, and James Faulkner, an all-rounder known for his contributions in limited-overs cricket. Current key players include Matthew Wade, Ben McDermott, Peter Siddle, Beau Webster and former captain of the Australia national cricket team, Tim Paine.\n\nTwenty20\n\n[edit]\n\nEstablished in 2011, the Hobart Hurricanes and Hobart Hurricanes (WBBL) represent Tasmania in the KFC Big Bash League and, since 2015, in the Women's Big Bash League respectively. The Hobart Hurricanes men's team have been a competitive side in the Big Bash League with notable individual performances and several strong seasons. Key players include D'Arcy Short, the BBL Player of the Tournament in 2017-18 and 2018-19, Ben McDermott, Matthew Wade, Jofra Archer, and Riley Meredith. The Hurricanes’ best seasons include BBL03 (2013-14), when they reached the final, BBL07 (2017-18), highlighted by Short’s record-setting run tally, and BBL08 (2018-19), where they finished the regular season at the top of the table. Despite their strong performances, the Hurricanes have yet to secure a BBL title.\n\nSoftball\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Softball in Tasmania\n\nSoftball, introduced to Tasmania from Melbourne in the late 1940s, grew in popularity from 56 teams in 1976 to 216 in 1984, with the first softball-only facility built in 1984. Softball Tasmania is the governing body of softball in Tasmania. Simmone Morrow is the island's best known player, serving as a member on the national team and collecting a silver medal for Australia at the 2004 Summer Olympics.\n\nVigoro\n\n[edit]\n\nTasmania is one of the three traditional Australian states to play Vigoro. The Brooks Vigoro Club in the north of Launceston was founded in 1977 by Margie Stewart.\n\nCourt and hoop games\n\n[edit]\n\nBasketball\n\n[edit]\n\nTasmania has hosted multiple teams in Australia's top basketball tiers, yet instability has been a recurring challenge. Contributing factors include limited financial resources, difficulties in attracting and retaining top talent due to Tasmania's geographical isolation, and fluctuating fan support. Historically, league restructuring has also affected Tasmanian teams and the island's ability to retain homegrown talent. Before the establishment of the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1979, Tasmania produced several notable players, such as Nita Burke, who from 1956 represented Australia six times internationally in the women's national basketball team, and John Maddock, who competed in the men's national basketball team at the 1976 Summer Olympics.\n\nNational Basketball League\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough short lived, Launceston Casino City were the first Tasmanian team to participate in the National Basketball League (NBL) and the first to become NBL champions, being victors of the 1981 NBL season and producing NBL champions Andrew Clements, Trevor Mathew and olympian Ian Davies. The Hobart Devils were stalwarts of the league, fostering local talent including two-time NBL champion Anthony Stewart, NBL champion Mark Nash, Peter Mann, Brennan Stanwix, and Justin Hickey, who would go on to found the Auckland Tuatara in the NZNBL.[13] The Devils' infamously became the first team representing a capital city to have their NBL license revoked in 1996. Devonport was also briefly represented in the NBL by the Devonport Warriors between 1983–1984. Notably, the Warriors produced Marty Clarke, who played for the North Melbourne Giants during their 1989 NBL Championship win.\n\nAfter the Devils' disbandment, Tasmania endured a twenty-six year absence from NBL representation. During this period, many Tasmanian players sought opportunities interstate, including three-time NBL champion Matthew Knight, two-time NBL champion and olympian Adam Gibson, NBL champion Sam Harris, NBL champion Lucas Walker, Tanner Krebs and Hugh Greenwood. The Tasmania JackJumpers joined the NBL in the 2021–22 NBL season with homegrown talent including Sejr Deans and development player Tre Armstrong on the inaugural roster.[14] The JackJumpers secured their maiden NBL championship in the 2023–24 season, marking Tasmania's first men's NBL title in 43 years.[15]\n\nTasmania is currently not represented in the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL), however following the JackJumpers' success, there is growing support for women's basketball in the state.[16] Historically, the Hobart Hustlers won the inaugural Women's Basketball Conference in 1984,[17] and the Hobart Islanders were champions of the 1991 WNBL season. The team was led by three-time WNBL Most Valuable Player and olympian, Kathy Foster.[18] The Islanders withdrew from the competition in the mid-1990s.[19] Foster was inducted into the Australian Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013.[20] Other notable Tasmanian champions include Carla Boyd, who won a bronze medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics and Hollie Grima, who won a silver medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Contemporary players include Alanna Smith, Tayla Roberts, Zoe Crawford and Taylor Mole.\n\nNBL1\n\n[edit]\n\nCompeting in the NBL1 South conference, Tasmania is represented by three teams in the semi-professional NBL1 league, the Hobart Chargers (men's and women's), the Launceston Tornadoes (women's) and North-West Tasmania Thunder (men's). Prior to the Chargers joining NBL1, the former Hobart Huskies competed in the inaugural 2019 season. The Chargers men's team won their first NBL1 South championship in 2022.[21]\n\nIn the former South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL), the Hobart Chargers men's team were Conference Champions in 1997, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2008, and 2018, and SEABL League Champions in 2008 and 2018. The women's team were Conference Champions in 2014. The Launceston Tornadoes were women's SEABL League Champions in 1995 and North-West Tasmania were men's Conference Champions in 1996 and 2004. The league was superseded by NBL1 in 2019.\n\nNetball\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Tasmanian Netball League (TNL) is the pinnacle of netball competition in the state, with teams like the Northern Hawks competing since 1993. The Tasmanian Wild team represents the state in the Australian Netball Championships. Netball Tasmania currently partners with the Collingwood Magpies to host some home games in Launceston and aims to establish its own team based in Hobart. CEO Aaron Pidgeon is discussing the licensing process with the Australian Netball League and emphasises the need to provide more opportunities for Australian players, including experienced players like Caitlin Bassett.[22]\n\nTasmania has demonstrated potential with the Tasmanian Magpies winning the Australian Netball League title in 2018. The success of other Tasmanian sports teams, such as the Hobart Hurricanes and the JackJumpers, indicates a supportive market for elite sports in the region. Netball in Tasmania has grown significantly, with the state actively seeking entry into the national Suncorp Super Netball league. Traditionally, the league has featured a maximum of eight Australian teams, but there are increasing calls for expansion.[22]\n\nA partnership between Netball Australia, Netball Tasmania, and the Tasmanian Government will see the Melbourne Mavericks play Super Netball matches in Hobart in 2024. This partnership aims to enhance pathway programs and provide high-performance opportunities for Tasmanian athletes and coaches.[23]\n\nCombat sports\n\n[edit]\n\nActive Tasmania ensures the safety of professional and amateur boxing and combat sports contests by applying best practice standards developed in collaboration with industry professionals and Tasmania Police.\n\nBoxing\n\n[edit]\n\nBoxing Tasmania is the governing body for amateur boxing in Tasmania and is affiliated with Boxing Australia. Recent Tasmanian champions include Luke Jackson, who won the featherweight bronze medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Jackson was subsequently named team captain for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, and represented Australia at the 2012 Summer Olympics in the lightweight division, again as team captain. Flyweight Jackson Woods also appeared at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Former Ultimate Fighting Championship fighter Rob Wilkinson won the PFL 10 (2022 season) light heavyweight title in 2022.[24]\n\nDuring the convict period, boxing was illegal but popular in isolated areas where it often accompanied drinking and gambling. The sport's popularity waned in the 1850s as societal respectability grew, but it revived in the 1870s with the adoption of the Queensberry rules, making boxing more respectable.[25]\n\nThroughout the 20th century, boxing continued to thrive in Tasmania.[25] It was particularly popular among miners on the West Coast, with significant matches held at venues like the Gaiety Theatre in Zeehan. During the Great Depression, professional boxing provided financial support to many families, and Tasmanian boxers achieved national titles and international recognition, including William Herbert Smith's gold medal at the 1938 British Empire Games.[25]\n\nA unique aspect of Tasmania's boxing history was the tradition of boxing-tent sideshows. Harry Paulsen, a notable figure, established his boxing tent in 1936 after a brief boxing career and learning the trade with other troupes. His tent became a major attraction, operating for nearly four decades. Paulsen's showmanship included using a large saltwater crocodile as a mascot, famously kept in the family's bathtub between shows.[26]\n\nBetween 1948 and 1976, Tasmania produced nine national title winners and three Olympians, showcasing the state's boxing prowess.[25] Notable among them was Ron Gower, who represented Australia in the 1948 and 1952 Summer Olympics, Gerald Freeman who competed in the 1960 Summer Olympics, Al Bourke, Wayne Devlin, who competed in the 1972 Summer Olympics and the 1976 Summer Olympics, David Taylor, who won multiple state and Australian titles, and Jerry Oakford, a junior Tasmanian Champion who won the Australian Lightweight title for three consecutive years between 1978-1980.[27]\n\nEven as professional boxing saw a decline in the 1970s, amateur boxing in Tasmania remained robust. In the 1990s, Olympians Justann Crawford and Daniel Geale emerged, continuing the state's legacy of producing top-tier boxers.[25]\n\nBoxing remains strong in rural Tasmania through community engagement like the Southern Stars Boxing Club in Geeveston[28] and O'Callaghan's Gym in Penguin.[29]\n\nJudo\n\n[edit]\n\nJudo Tasmania is the governing body for judo in Tasmania and is affiliated with Judo Australia and the International Judo Federation. Notable Tasmanian judokas include Angela Deacon,[30] who won a gold medal at the Oceania Judo Championships in 1992, the first Australian and only female to do so, Dean Lampkin, who collected several Oceania Judo Championships titles and won a silver medal at the 1990 Commonwealth Games,[31] and Chris Bacon, who won a bronze medal at the 1990 Commonwealth Games.\n\nCycling\n\n[edit]\n\nRoad cycling in Tasmania is popular due to its scenic routes, varied terrain, active cycling community and strong tourism infrastructure. Key routes include the Great Eastern Drive on the east coast, the challenging climbs of the west coast, kunanyi/Mount Wellington, and the Tamar Valley Wine Route near Launceston. Major events include the Tour of Tasmania, Tassie Gift, and various gran fondos. Cycling in Tasmania is administered by AusCycling Tasmania, a subsidiary of the national governing body AusCycling.\n\nTasmania has produced several well-known cyclists who have achieved significant success in national and international competitions. James Nevin was the first Tasmanian cyclist to represent Australia at the 1952 and 1956 Summer Olympics, while road cyclist Michael Grenda saw Tasmania achieve its first olympic gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics in the Men's team pursuit event. Some of the most prominent Tasmanian cyclists include Will Clarke and olympians Michael Grenda, Timothy O'Shannessey, Amy Cure, Matthew Goss, Scott Bowden, Georgia Baker, and Richie Porte.\n\nMountain biking\n\n[edit]\n\nMountain biking in Tasmania offers diverse terrain and well-developed trail networks. Key destinations include Blue Derby, known for its world-class trails and the Enduro World Series; Maydena Bike Park with gravity-focused trails; Hollybank Mountain Bike Park near Launceston; and St Helens Mountain Bike Trails on the east coast. Other notable trails are Wild Mersey, Kate Reed Reserve, and the North-South Track on kunanyi/Mount Wellington. Tasmania's trails range from rainforest tracks and alpine paths to coastal routes, with infrastructure such as bike rentals and shuttle services. The region also hosts numerous events and competitions, supporting a strong mountain biking community.\n\nEndurance racing\n\n[edit]\n\nMarathon\n\n[edit]\n\nHigh profile marathon events in Tasmania include the Cadbury Marathon, Point to Pinnacle, the City to Casino and the Hobart Airport Marathon Festival. Events more recently established include the kunanyi Mountain Run and the Launceston Marathon.\n\nTriathlon\n\n[edit]\n\nEstablished in 1985, the Devonport Triathlon is one of the oldest in Australia. Over the years, the event has evolved into a major triathlon event on the Australian sports calendar. Recently, the race has hosted several high-profile events, including the World Triathlon Para Series, Elite/U23 Oceania Championships, National Championships Junior/Youth, School Sport Triathlon Championships and Community Triathlon.[33]\n\nHobart was added to the Ironman 70.3 roster in 2023. Tasmania's most successful triathlete is Jacob Birtwhistle, who represented Australia at the 2020 Summer Olympics, won a gold medal in the mixed-relay and a silver medal at the triathlon events at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, and a bronze medal at the mixed-relay event at the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Birtwhistle was the winner of the inaugural IronMan Tasmania event in 2023.[34]\n\nAustralian rules football has been played in Tasmania since the late 1860s. It draws the largest audience for any football code in the state. A 2018 study of internet traffic showed that 79% of Tasmanians are interested in Australian rules football, the highest rate in the country.[35] Tasmania once held the highest participation rate for men aged 5-39 years in Australia, with 22% involvement in 2005.[36] The state has a storied history in interstate matches, having competed vigorously since its inaugural colonial match in 1884, fostering a strong rivalry with Victoria. Tasmania played its last competitive interstate match in the 1990 State of Origin series, culminating in a notable victory over Victoria at North Hobart Oval with an attendance of 18,651 patrons.[37]\n\nTasmania has produced several notable Australian Football League (AFL) players who have made significant contributions to the sport, including Peter Hudson, Roy Cazaly, Darrel Baldock, Alastair Lynch, Matthew Richardson and Ian Stewart. Prominent contemporary players include Jack Riewoldt, Jeremy Howe, Toby Nankervis and Hugh Greenwood.\n\nThe primary football competitions in Tasmania are the statewide Tasmanian Football League (TFL), which has been active intermittently since 1879, and its associated regional leagues: the Southern Football League and the Northern Tasmanian Football League. Following the announcement of the island's first AFL club, the Tasmania Football Club in 2023, the TFL will conclude its final season in 2024, followed by a major restructure of Tasmanian community football from 2025. This restructuring aligns with AFL Tasmania's commitment to strong football pathways and coincides with the Tasmania Football Club's entry into the AFL in 2028.[38]\n\nTFL competition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Tasmanian Football League (TFL), established in 1879, is one of Australia's oldest football competitions. It has fostered intense rivalries and produced many skilled players over the years. Notable teams include North Hobart, Glenorchy, Clarence, and Launceston. The league has seen significant crowds, with the 1979 Grand Final attracting over 24,968 spectators. In 2025, new Premier League divisions in the state's South, North, and North West will replace the TSL. Brighton Football Club will join five Southern TSL clubs (Clarence, Glenorchy, Kingborough, Lauderdale, and North Hobart) to form a six-team Southern Premier League for Men and Women. The Northern Premier League's composition is still being determined.[38]\n\nVictorian team home homes\n\n[edit]\n\nVictorian AFL teams have been playing AFL Premiership season matches in Tasmania since 1991, with Fitzroy Lions (1991-1992),[39] St Kilda (2001–2006), Hawthorn (2001-2025),[40] and North Melbourne (2012-2025)[41] all having hosted home games in the state at various times.[42]\n\nVFL team\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom 2001 to 2008, a representative club, the Tasmanian Devils, competed in the Victorian Football League (VFL), drawing crowds exceeding 10,000 on two occasions. Following a hiatus of eight years, at the end of the 2008 season AFL Tasmania decided to withdraw the Devils from the VFL in favour of restarting the statewide TFL.\n\nAFL team\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Tasmania Football Club is set to join the national Australian Football League from the 2028 season, following a formal announcement was made by Gillon McLachlan at the North Hobart Oval on 3 May 2023.[43] Former Richmond Tigers player Brendon Gale was named as the club's inaugural chief executive in May 2024.[44]\n\nBased in Hobart, the Tasmanian Gaelic Football and Hurling Association run a seven-a-side Gaelic Football League.\n\nRugby league\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Rugby league in Tasmania\n\nThe Tasmanian Rugby League reestablished a summer competition in 2009.[citation needed]\n\nRugby union\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Tasmanian Rugby Union[45] Statewide League consists of 10 Teams and was first established in 1933. The senior men's state representative side for the Tasmanian Rugby Union is the Tasmanian Jack Jumpers. Rugby union in Tasmania consists of the following divisions : Men's, Women's, Junior Under 18, Junior Under 16, Juniors Under 14.[citation needed]\n\nSoccer\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Soccer in Tasmania\n\nThe Football Federation Tasmania (FFT) is the governing body for association football (soccer) in Tasmania. It oversees men's, women's, and youth competitions across the state, with the main season running in winter. FFT is also dedicated to grassroots development, organising junior leagues, coaching clinics, and community programs to increase participation and foster a love for the game. It collaborates with Football Australia and other state federations to align with national standards and initiatives, including the National Club Accreditation Scheme.\n\nSince 2013, the highest level of male competition has been the NPL Tasmania, part of the National Premier Leagues system nationwide. This league includes teams from all major Tasmanian regions. Each season's champion advances to the national NPL finals series to compete against other state winners. Below the NPL, the Southern Championship and the Northern Championship serve as key developmental leagues.\n\nTasmania has several notable soccer grounds that host a range of competitions, from local leagues to higher-level matches. North Hobart Oval, known primarily for Australian rules football, also accommodates soccer games. KGV Park in Glenorchy is a key venue, serving as the home ground for the Glenorchy Knights and hosting National Premier Leagues Tasmania (NPL Tasmania) matches. Valley Road Ground in Devonport, home to the Devonport City Strikers, is renowned for its well-maintained facilities.[46] Darwin Football Park in Kingston hosts Kingborough Lions United FC's matches, while Warrior Park in Warrane is the base for Olympia Warriors FC. Lightwood Park in Blackmans Bay is also used by Kingborough Lions United FC for training and matches.\n\nA-League bid\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Tasmanian A-League bid\n\nFFT is actively pursuing the possibility of establishing an A-League club in Tasmania to provide local players with a pathway to professional careers and to meet the strong community interest in elite football.[47][48][49][50][51]\n\nTouch football has a small following in Tasmania with approximately 7,500 active participants annually. Touch Football Tasmania (TFT) aims to achieve representation in Australian youth and open squads, with teams set to compete in the National Youth Championships. Challenges include delayed entry of young talent into the sport, typically starting around age 12 or 13, unlike in rugby states. TFT focuses on incremental improvement to bridge the gap with dominant northern states over the next ten years. Bec Oliver's selection in the Australian women’s 27-and-over team highlights the potential for Tasmanian talent on the national stage.[52] Local touch football associations, like the Devonport Touch Football Association and Launceston Touch Football Association (LTA), provide platforms for players to develop skills and foster a welcoming environment.\n\nGolf\n\n[edit]\n\nTasmania has numerous golf courses spread throughout the island. The town of Bridport in the northeast is home to Barnbougle Dunes, a public golf course designed by architect Tom Doak which opened in 2004 and is ranked among the top 100 courses in the world.[53]\n\nHockey and indoor hockey\n\n[edit]\n\nHockey Tasmania[54] governs and administers the sport of hockey and indoor hockey for most of Tasmania.[55] It also administers the senior Tasmanian representative club The Tassie Tigers which fields a Men's and a Women's team in the elite national domestic competition Hockey One which generally plays its annual home and away season in the months of September, October, and November across Australia.[56] Hockey One and the Tassie Tigers club replaced the now-defunct Australian Hockey League and the former men's and women's teams the Tassie Tigers and the Tassie Van Demons in 2019.[57]\n\nHockey is predominantly played on synthetic surfaces in Tasmania, although some junior and school competitions do still play on grass fields.

Initially organised around gambling, rowing grew to include various regattas by 1831 and saw the first intercolonial race in 1861. Tasmania's competitive rowing culture stemmed from its private schools seeking to emulate prestigious English institutions, however due to the island's relationship with the water, the sport became widespread and in 1874, the former Hobart High School became the Colony of Tasmania's first public school to establish a boating club. Adult mens clubs such as the Shipwright's Point Rowing Club (1867), the Derwent Boating Club (1869), and the Tamar Boating Club (1870) were established, and annual North vs. South races began in 1891. Notable achievements include Cecil McVilly's successes, the first King's Cup win in 1906, and the women's championship win in 1921. Despite a decline in the 1950s, Tasmania produced national champions including Ted Hale. In 1978, Lake Barrington became a world-class rowing venue, hosting the 1990 World Rowing Championships.\n\nThe Tasmanian Institute of Sport continues to support competitive rowing, with recent champions such as Stephen Hawkins and Dana Faletic making significant international impacts.[68] Lightweight rowing World Champion and olympian Stephen Hawkins first represented Australia at just 17 and won a gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in the double sculls with his partner Peter Antonie at 22.
