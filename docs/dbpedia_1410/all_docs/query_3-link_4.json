        "text": "Former Australian captain and Tasmanian veteran, George Bailey has been appointed Cricket Australia's chief selector for its men's program.\n\nBailey, 38, joins four other Tasmanians — Tim Paine, Jeff Vaughan, Michael Di Venuto and Ricky Ponting — as Tasmanians holding key roles with Cricket Australia.\n\nCricket Australia said Bailey would take over from former chief selector Trevor Hohns, who is stepping down.\n\nBailey, already a member of Cricket Australia's selection panel, had been widely backed as the frontrunner for the job.\n\nThe promotion comes at an important time, with a new era of Australian cricket on the horizon: 10 of Cricket Australia's 17 contract list players are aged over 30.\n\nBailey will also be tasked with selecting Australia's squad for the T20 World Cup, which is set to begin late this year.\n\nHe will have to negotiate conflicts with franchise tournaments, such as the IPL, and COVID-19 \"bubble fatigue\" in his new role.\n\nCricket Australia will now start its search for a third member of the selection panel.\n\nBailey said he would take a similar approach to his predecessor.\n\n\"In what can be a challenging job, Trevor has always been calm, consistent and approachable,\" he said.\n\nFrom Launceston to international cricket\n\nBailey grew up in Launceston in northern Tasmania, before moving to Hobart at 18 to chase his professional cricket ambitions.\n\nBailey enjoyed a sterling international career, amassing 125 games for his country, winning an Ashes series and becoming the second Australian in history to debut as captain in a T20 in 2012.\n\nUntil recently, Bailey had still been turning out for local club South Hobart Sandy Bay Sharks, showing his ties to local cricket are anything but lost.\n\nBailey is well equipped in the field of administration, holding an MBA from the University of Tasmania. He is also the co-owner of a functional training franchise in southern Tasmania."
