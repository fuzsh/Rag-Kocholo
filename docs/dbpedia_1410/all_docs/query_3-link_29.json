        "text": "There is an episode in The Simpsons where one of Homer's workmates, Lenny, gets a facelift so he can have a perpetual smile. A similar thing could be said about George Bailey, the smiling assassin putting international bowlers to the sword for fun.\n\n''I don't know whether he had an operation to put it on there, who knows? It is always there,'' says Jason Krejza, Bailey's former Tasmanian teammate.\n\nThere have been plenty of reasons for Bailey to flash his pearly whites in the past year, but the biggest might be to come later this month if, as expected, the 31-year-old becomes Australia's 436th Test cricketer.\n\nAs a batsman, Bailey currently has the Midas touch. His hot streak in India - 474 runs at a Bradmanesque average of 118.5 - means he is the form player at the start of the season.\n\nBut at a time where culture has become the buzzword in Australian cricket, what Bailey, who averages 38 in the first-class arena, brings off the field is just as important as runs on it.\n\nAnd on this front Bailey is almost without peer. From the board room to the dressing room, there is not a bad word said about Bailey. And why would there be?\n\nThe former Launceston Church Grammar School captain can do it all. As a footballer he was good enough to play at under-18s level for Tasmania and attracted the interest of AFL scouts. He could also swing a tennis racquet.\n\nAway from the sports fields, Bailey took an interest in drama and public speaking. Oh, and he also scored in the high 90s in his HSC.\n\n''He's got a lot of interests which mightn't sound like a rough and tough footballer or cricketer,'' says his father John Bailey. ''He likes his garden. When he comes home we talk a bit about cricket but he and his mother spend a lot of time walking around the garden in their house.''\n\nBailey, though, isn't perfect. His father once banned him from playing in a tennis tournament at the age of 13 or 14 because he was unhappy with his son's behaviour.\n\n''I think the racquet might have left his hand,'' says John Bailey. ''I'd like to think he learnt from it. I can't remember him ever doing it again.''\n\nBailey's ''gift of the gab'', as his father describes it, and his smile can help him get out of a bind.\n\nNot even watching his team for the second time surrender a game, after setting India a target of more than 350, affected his demeanour - a point noted by a selector who was impressed by his sense of perspective.\n\nWhen he was described by a TV executive as someone who would be ''flipping burgers'' if not for the money brought into the game by broadcast rights, Bailey told his father: ''I think I would have moved on from flipping burgers, I think I would have been on the counter by now.''\n\nBailey's genial disposition has occasionally been misinterpreted but, his father says, ''underneath there's a very steely resolve''. His former state coach Tim Coyle, who has known Bailey since he was 14, never doubted that.\n\n''He disguises a grimace with a smile occasionally, don't be confused,'' he says.\n\n''He might show it slightly differently, but I always knew what was bubbling underneath.\n\n''He's certainly one of those guys who is very, very keen to enjoy what he's doing on and off the field when it comes to his cricket - it means he does smile a lot.'' National selectors recognised his character when they made him the first man to captain Australia on debut last year.\n\nThe bulk of CA directors had no qualms ratifying the decision either, though elements of the old board were, as one insider describes it, displaying state-based parochialism at the shock decision to dump Cameron White.\n\nAs a leader, Bailey is revered by state teammates who appreciate his honesty and selflessness. Ricky Ponting describes him as ''one of those guys who brings teams together''.\n\n''His personality rubs off on everybody. Anyone who has played with him will know and understand that,'' Ponting says.\n\nEd Cowan wrote glowingly of Bailey in his book In the Firing Line: Diary of a Season, recalling how the Tasmanian captain penned a lengthy email when asked to explain what the dogged opener needed to improve to play more one-day cricket.\n\nKrejza, too, has a tale of how Bailey went the extra mile with his captaincy. The former Test spinner was initially critical of Bailey's ability to set fields to spin. So Bailey padded up to him in the nets.\n\n''I'd tell him the field and he'll ask, 'Why is that guy there?' He didn't get it, I don't think,'' Krejza says."
