        "text": "THE Australian home summer of cricket returns this weekend with the JLT One-Day Cup kicking off in Townsville.\n\nThe tournament will see matches at suburban grounds around Queensland, Western Australia, New South Wales and Victoria, with the final taking place at the revamped Junction Oval in St. Kilda.\n\nThis year’s edition sees the tournament return to being a six-team competition that no longer\n\nfeatures the Cricket Australia XI. The experimental side of encouraging, young players will instead face international teams – South Africa, India and Sri Lanka – in tour matches during the home summer.\n\nFind out everything you need to know in our Ultimate Guide.\n\nHOW TO WATCH\n\nFox Sports Cricket will broadcast 13 of the 20 matches from the competition live. Other games will be streamed on the Cricket Australia website.\n\nGet ready for cricket like never before. FREE Sport HD + Entertainment until the first 4K cricket ball as part of 3 months free on a 12 month plan. SIGN UP TODAY. T&Cs apply.\n\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\n\nThis year’s competition utilises a slightly tweaked format – each state qualifies for the finals knock-out after a round-robin. The top two teams on the ladder advance straight through to the semi-finals, with the other four sides competing in qualifying matches – 3v6, 4v5. What follows are the traditional semi-finals and grand final on October 10.\n\nNEW SOUTH WALES\n\nDOMESTIC SEASON PREVIEW\n\nSEASON OF OPPORTUNITY: GUNS BANGING DOWN THE DOOR FOR SELECTION\n\nWATCH: PUNTER WITH A GOATEE, YOUNG GILLY AND THAT CATCH: RE-LIVE AUSSIE ONE-DAY WONDERS\n\nTIME TO SHINE: EVERY STATE’S YOUNG GUN READY TO BURST ONTO THE SCENE\n\nRAPID RANKS: AUSTRALIA’S NEXT GENERATION OF FAST BOWLERS REVEALED\n\nWATCH: OUR NEXT GENERATION OF QUICKEST BOWLERS\n\nMissing a cluster of their most influential players – including Steve Smith, David Warner, Nathan Lyon, Josh Hazlewood, Mitch Starc, Pat Cummins – New South Wales enter the tournament with an assortment of old and new faces in their squad. With plenty of potential to win the Cup, the Blues will rely on depth within their team to get them over the line this season. New South Wales have won two of the last three one-day domestic tournaments.\n\nStar Player: Stephen O’Keefe – the controversial tweaker has been in-and-out of the Test team for a few years, the highlight of his international career being an unforgettable 12-70 against India in 2017. While his List A record may not read well – he averages 55.89 with the ball in 48 matches – his experience will assist in keeping opposition scoring rates low in what will be a high-scoring competition.\n\nPlayer to look out for: Jason Sangha – a teenage Sangha turned heads last season when he scored a gritty 133 off 226 balls against the touring English side, with a bowling attack that featured Stuart Broad, Chris Woakes and Moeen Ali. While the 19-year-old may not play in the opening match of the tournament, NSW coach Phil Jacques has openly praised his batting ability.\n\nLast season result: 4th\n\nPrevious One-Day Cup Title: 2016-17\n\nSquad: Peter Nevill (c), Sean Abbott, Harry Conway, Trent Copeland, Jack Edwards, Mickey Edwards, Ryan Gibson, Moises Henriques, Daniel Hughes, Nick Larkin, Stephen O’Keefe, Kurtis Patterson, Daniel Sams, Jason Sangha\n\nQUEENSLAND\n\nEight members of the Queensland squad just arrived back in the country after touring India on the Australia A tour, five of which have been announced in the Test squad to play Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates. This depth of international standard within the Bulls camp highlights their potential to win the one-day domestic cup this season.\n\nStar Player: Chris Lynn – the big-hitting Queensland captain has played T20 cricket around the world, making headlines in the IPL, the CPL and of course, the Big Bash. The first player to hit 100 Big Bash sixes, Lynn is an intimidating threat to any opposition, and – fitness permitting – could finish the competition the leading run-scorer. This will be his first one-day domestic competition for Queensland in five years.\n\nPlayer to look out for: Billy Stanlake – the tallest player to ever represent Australia, Stanlake can strike fear into the minds of the world’s best batsmen. Fast and fierce – it’s easy to draw comparisons to Shaun Tait – the Queenslander has been a regular in the national one-day side after making his debut against Pakistan in 2017 at the age of 22.\n\nLast season result: 5th\n\nPrevious One-Day Cup Title: 2013/14\n\nSquad: Chris Lynn (c), Xavier Bartlett, Max Bryant, Joe Burns, Luke Feldman, Sam Heazlett, Charlie Hemphrey, Lachlan Pfeffer, Jack Prestwidge, Billy Stanlake, Mark Steketee, Mitch Swepson, Sam Truloff, Jack Wildermuth\n\nSOUTH AUSTRALIA\n\nRunners-up in the 2017 tournament, South Australia are strong contenders to win the Cup this season. The Redbacks – lead by their new captain Jake Lehmann – will undoubtedly miss their star batsman Travis Head, who is flying to the United Arab Emirates with the Australian Test team. Since 1987, South Australia has only once (2011/12) won the 50-over domestic cup.\n\nStar Player: Alex Carey – recent selections would suggest Carey is the second-choice keeper for the national side. The 26-year-old made his ODI debut against England in January and only four months later was handed the T20 international vice-captaincy. Despite boasting an impressive T20 record – he averages 40.61 at a strike rate of 135.38 – Carey will be looking to improve on his skills in the 50-over format this season.\n\nPlayer to look out for: Callum Ferguson – the 33-year-old batsman recently spoke of his aspiration to re-join the national side; Ferguson played his only Test in November 2016 against South Africa, and the last of his 30 one-day internationals was back in 2011. However, the South Australian has enjoyed a fruitful stint for Worcestershire in the off-season, scoring 377 runs at an average of 94.25 across his five one-dayers for the county.\n\nLast season result: 2nd\n\nPrevious One-Day Cup Title: 2011/12\n\nSquad: Jake Lehmann (c), Alex Carey, Tom Cooper, Callum Ferguson, Spencer Johnson, Joe Mennie, Harry Nielsen, Kane Richardson, Alex Ross, Chadd Sayers, Cameron Valente, Jake Weatherald, Daniel Worrall, Adam Zampa\n\nTASMANIA\n\nUnder the captaincy of veteran George Bailey, Tasmania head into the JLT Cup as unlikely victors – they finished sixth on the ladder last year, after winning only two of their six matches. The inexperienced squad features a handful of promising up-and-comers, and will undoubtedly be one of the more entertaining teams of the tournament. Tasmania were finalists in the Sheffield Shield last Summer and will aim to continue that form in the 2018/19 season.\n\nStar Player: James Faulkner – arguably Australia’s best short-format all-rounder since Shane Watson, Faulkner plays a vital role in balancing the Tasmanian line-up. Dropped from the international side last year, the World Cup-winner will be eager to prove his capabilities with both bat and ball during the death overs.\n\nPlayer to look out for: Ben McDermott – son of legendary Test paceman Craig, Ben McDermott will be hoping to cement his spot in the Tasmanian one-day team. Having played only seven List A matches, he may not be the most experienced, but his memorable 114 off 52 balls against the Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash last year highlights his potential.\n\nLast season result: 6th\n\nPrevious One-Day Cup Title: 2009/10\n\nSquad: George Bailey (c), Jackson Bird, Nicholas Buchanan, Jake Doran, James Faulkner, Ben McDermott, Riley Meredith, Simon Milenko, Tom Rogers, Clive Rose, Jordan Silk, Aaron Summers, Matthew Wade, Beau Webster\n\nVICTORIA\n\nVictoria boasts an imposing squad leading into the tournament. Led by the experienced Peter Handscomb, the Victorian team features a cluster of players currently pushing for national selection. Coached by ex-Test player Andrew McDonald, they will be looking to vastly improve on their 2017 season, where they were knocked out by South Australia in the qualifying final. Victoria has surprisingly won the one-day domestic cup only once since the turn of the millennium.\n\nStar Player: Glenn Maxwell – the big-hitting superstar was shockingly omitted from the Test squad to tour the United Arab Emirates, much to the advantage of the Victorian team. Renowned for his explosive short-format batting, 29-year-old Maxwell will be keen to show the national selectors that they’ve made a terrible mistake.\n\nPlayer to look out for: Nic Maddinson – it’s been a tough couple of seasons for Maddinson; he was dropped from the Test team in early 2017, only to then be denied a contract with New South Wales earlier this year. After taking a break from the game and featuring in a handful of T20 international matches over the winter, the 26-year-old has been offered a fresh start with the Victoria Bushrangers.\n\nLast season result: 3rd\n\nPrevious One-Day Cup Title: 2010/11\n\nSquad: Peter Handscomb (c), Scott Boland, Jackson Coleman, Travis Dean, Sebastian Gotch, Marcus Harris, Mackenzie Harvey, Nic Maddinson, Glenn Maxwell, Tom O’Connell, Matt Short, Will Sutherland, Chris Tremain, Cameron White\n\nWESTERN AUSTRALIA\n\nThe returning champions, Western Australia remain red-hot contenders to reclaim the cup this season. Losing only one match in the 2017 competition, the Warriors are now without some of their biggest stars that pushed them to the final last year, including Cameron Bancroft and the Marsh brothers – Shaun won Player of the Series. However, they have secured star all-rounder Ashton Agar for the first two matches before he flies to the United Arab Emirates with the Test side.\n\nStar Player: D’Arcy Short – the 28-year-old big-hitter was awarded Player of the Big Bash last season, after scoring 504 runs at an average of 56 with a strike rate of 147.80. He featured in three ODIs during Australia’s recent tour of England and will undoubtedly enjoy targeting the short boundaries in the JLT Cup.\n\nPlayer to look out for: Cameron Green – in February last year, 17-year-old Green became the youngest Sheffield Shield player to take a five-for on debut, when he took 5-24 against Tasmania. After working with Chris Rogers at the National Performance Squad during the off-season, the young right-arm paceman will look to continue his domestic cricket success under the guidance of WA coach Adam Voges.\n\nLast season result: 1st\n\nPrevious One-Day Cup Title: 2017/18\n\nSquad (first two games): Ashton Turner (c), Ashton Agar, Hilton Cartwright, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Cameron Green, Josh Inglis, Matt Kelly, Joel Paris, Josh Philippe, Jhye Richardson, D’Arcy Short, Marcus Stoinis, Andrew Tye, Jonathan Wells\n\nFIXTURES\n\nMatch 1 - 16 September 2018, 10:00 AM Local Time\n\nQLD vs VIC\n\nRiverway Stadium, Townsville\n\nMatch 2 - 18 September 2018, 2:00 PM Local Time\n\nWA vs NSW\n\nWACA Ground, Perth\n\nMatch 3 - 19 September 2018, 10:00 AM Local Time\n\nTAS vs VIC\n\nRiverway Stadium, Townsville\n\nMatch 4 - 20 September 2018, 2:00 PM Local Time\n\nSA vs NSW\n\nWACA Ground, Perth\n\nMatch 5 - 22 September 2018, 2:00 PM Local Time\n\nWA vs SA\n\nWACA Ground, Perth\n\nMatch 6 - 22 September 2018 10:00 AM Local Time\n\nQLD vs TAS\n\nRiverway Stadium, Townsville\n\nMatch 7 - 23 September 2018, 9:30 AM Local Time\n\nNSW vs VIC\n\nNorth Sydney Oval No.1, North Sydney\n\nMatch 8 - 25 September 2018, 2:00 PM Local Time\n\nNSW vs TAS\n\nNorth Sydney Oval No.1, North Sydney\n\nMatch 9 - 25 September 2018, 9:30 AM Local Time\n\nSA vs QLD\n\nHurstville Oval, Hurstville\n\nMatch 10 - 26 September 2018, 10:00 AM Local Time\n\nVIC vs WA\n\nJunction Oval, St. Kilda\n\nMatch 11 - 27 September 2018, 9:30 AM Local Time\n\nSA vs TAS\n\nBankstown Oval, Bankstown\n\nMatch 12 - 28 September 2018, 9:30 AM Local Time\n\nWA vs QLD\n\nHurstville Oval, Hurstville\n\nMatch 13 - 30 September 2018, 10:00 AM Local Time\n\nVIC vs SA\n\nJunction Oval, St. Kilda\n\nMatch 14 - 1 October 2018, 2:00 PM Local Time\n\nNSW vs QLD\n\nDrummoyne Oval, Drummoyne\n\nMatch 15 - 1 October 2018, 9:30 AM Local Time\n\nTAS vs WA\n\nHurstville Oval, Hurstville\n\nQualifying Final (3v6) - 3 October 2018, 2:00 PM Local Time\n\nTBD vs TBD\n\nNorth Sydney Oval No.1, North Sydney\n\nQualifying Final (4v5) - 4 October 2018, 2:00 PM Local Time\n\nTBD vs TBD\n\nDrummoyne Oval, Drummoyne\n\nSemi-Final 1 - 6 October 2018, 2:00 PM Local Time\n\nTBD vs TBD\n\nDrummoyne Oval, Drummoyne\n\nSemi-Final 2 - 7 October 2018, 10:30 AM Local Time\n\nTBD vs TBD\n\nJunction Oval, St. Kilda\n\nFinal - 10 October 2018, 10:30 AM Local Time\n\nTBD vs TBD\n\nJunction Oval, St. Kilda"
