I think I watch most, if not every game of the Big Bash, so I’ll probably be doing much the same.\n\n“It (first-class retirement) probably hasn’t sunk in … you want the fairytale finish but, reminiscing over the last few days, the last 15 or 20 years have been the fairytale.”\n\n***\n\nLISTEN!

I now know it can’t, it was very painful,” Bailey said.\n\n“I just tried to get through without too much embarrassment.”\n\nWes Agar, who ended Bailey’s final Shield innings on Monday, was named man of the match after snaring career-best match figures of 8-121."
