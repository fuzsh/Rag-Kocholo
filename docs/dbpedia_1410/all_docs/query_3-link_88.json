        "text": "Two cricketing superstars from different continents will share not only the purple shirt of the Hobart Hurricanes this summer, but an association with the University of Tasmania.\n\nLegendary Sri Lankan batsman Kumar Sangakkara and Tasmanian Tigers captain George Bailey will both pad up for the Hurricanes when the 2015-16 Australian domestic T20 season begins this month.\n\nBoth already boast an impressive contribution to international cricket – and are entering a new phase of contributing to the life of the University.\n\nhas played 130 Tests, 404 one-day internationals, and 56 Twenty20 international matches for his home country, and is widely regarded as its most successful batsman.\n\nNot only has Sangakkara signed a two-year deal with the Hurricanes, he has also signed a sponsorship arrangement with the University of Tasmania, to promote the University to potential students from Sri Lanka.\n\nA former Australian T20 captain and former vice-captain of the Australian one-day side, Bailey is one of a handful of the University of Tasmania’s elite athletes who are being supported through their tertiary studies.\n\nOn November 11 he was recognised for his outstanding contribution to Tasmanian and Australian cricket when he was announced as the Commonwealth Bank Sports Person of the Year Award at the annual University of Tasmania Sports Celebratory Event.\n\nBailey has just this year returned to studying at the University of Tasmania. He is currently enrolled in a Master of Business Administration (MBA), after taking a number of other subjects during the early and mid-2000s.\n\nThe MBA is highly regarded for its relevance to industry, ease of access and flexible delivery – no doubt a bonus for a cricketer with a hectic travel schedule for many months of the year.\n\nBailey spent much of the last international summer season as captain of the Australian One Day team, in the absence of an injured Michael Clarke. With a tri-series win over England and India in the lead up to the World Cup, George was selected as vice-captain of the Australian squad, and captained the team in Australia’s first World Cup match against England.\n\nBailey went on to captain Indian Premier League franchise Kings XI Punjab – the first IPL team Sangakkara played for – and spent the Australian winter playing with the Sussex Sharks in England's domestic T20 competition. He returns to Tasmania for a big summer of cricket at home.\n\nSee Sangakkara and Bailey team up for the Hobart Hurricanes when they take on the Brisbane Heat at Bellerive on December 22."
