        "text": "A left-arm spinner who was at his best in limited-overs cricket, Xavier Doherty had once been Australia's first-choice slow bowler in ODIs. He took four wickets on debut against Sri Lanka in November 2010 and in the same month was handed a baggy green for the first time. He struggled for impact in the two Ashes Tests he played at the Gabba and Adelaide Oval, collecting three wickets for 306 runs.\n\nIt was nearly two and a half years before he was given another chance at Test cricket, on Australia's disastrous tour of India in early 2013, and again his lack of penetration was notable. In Hyderabad and Mohali he took a combined 4 for 242 and while he often bowled tight, he pitched the ball too full and imparted too little turn to be a true Test weapon.\n\nIn one-day internationals his results were stronger and the Australians missed him at the 2011 World Cup on the subcontinent, when a back injury kept him from touring. A steady, accurate and intelligent bowler who knows his game well, Doherty had been part of the domestic scene in Australia for more than a decade and when he announced his retirement in March 2017, he had played 71 first-class, 176 List A and 74 T20s.\n\nBig things were expected of Doherty after he starred at the Under-19 World Cup and was given a Tasmanian debut at 19 in 2001-02. Consistent impact in the Pura Cup and Sheffield Shield eluded him, although in the three seasons from 2009-10 to 2011-12 he accumulated 53 wickets at 26.45 and was part of Tasmania's winning side in the 2010-11 final against New South Wales."
