        "text": "Author: Dan Stapleton Cricket Media\n\nCricket Digital Media producer, writer, editor and photographer. With a real passion for covering domestic Australian cricket at BBL and Shield Shield. Interested in different aspects of cricket. This Site aims to cover cricket with fresh prospective. Based in Sydney I aim to cover All Australian state and BBL sides from a national view Point. Content will be unmatched with each side covered. Twitter @Dan_Stapo\n\nTim Paine Back for TAS at the SCG This Week Before India Test Series\n\nAustralian test skipper Tim Paine returns\n\nto Start his Australian home summer this week from Monday Nov 5 at the world famous SCG. Paine Will wicket keep for TAS and not be captain as that is left to George Bailey so Paine can build on a very fine performance in UAE as captain. Despite a tough tour Paine is very fit and back for TAS as keeper. Matthew Wade will likely play as a batsman only for the next 4 weeks before Paine heads into the Adelaide Test match\n\nThe match at the SCG is sadly likely to be dominated by rain as the forecasts predict rain on Wednesday and Thursday (days 3 and 4) of the first class match.\n\nAustralian and NSW off spinner Nathan Lyon will be a interesting battle against Paine. Several other players are in the Australian ODI side playing South Africa. Mitch Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood.\n\nTim Paine, Steve Smith Selfies or Photos with Australian Cricket Legends\n\nTim Paine Australian Captain, the new Test Captain is a wonderful person. So is Steve Smith the forgotten and missed batsmen from Sydney. This season and right through 2019 we are encouraging people to have photos and greet sessions with both Paine and Smith (along with other Australian players) tweet or share the photos on Facebook or Instagram please tag in #timpainecricketwebsite or you can Email Us with news or suggestions on this promotion.\n\nWe are trying to help Australian Cricket bounce back and find stronger relationships with players, fans and media within Australian cricket.\n\nTim Paine Rested After Arriving Home from UAE Test Series\n\nAustralian test skipper Tim Paine will be rested from Tasmania’s Sheffield Shield match starting this afternoon in Perth at the WACA. Paine arrived home after the test series in the UAE against Pakistan which Australia lost 1-0 in extreme conditions.\n\nPaine will be resting in Hobart this week spending time at home and will be assessed physically and mentally before he is allowed to play the match at the SCG against NSW in the first week of November.\n\nUAE was a very testing tour for young skipper Tim Paine who skippered Australia for the first time since David Warner and Steve Smith suspensions from the South Africa test tour in March. The ball tampering incident and then the extreme conditions in UAE have had a collective toll on Paine. A very reliable and understanding captain Paine has enjoyed some public support for his new role as test skipper.\n\nIt’s not easy wicket keeping, captaining, setting fields then batting for long periods in testing foreign conditions. A long with assisting young batters and bowlers on their first test tours. Paine with Mitch Marsh and Travis Head we’re tested.\n\nPaine is expected to be assessed by medical staff again next week to see when the Australian skipper returns. The build up to his first summer as Australian test captain has begun. The Adelaide 1st Test from December 6 will be a great moment for Paine and his team.\n\nTim Paine Australian Test Skipper and Character\n\nTim Paine a man who most forgot apart from the person who started this website! We backed him in a real man Tim who knows his cricket! A fine respectful person who can restore respect and true values in the proud baggygreen.\n\nIt’s sad that even a former player such as Ed Cowan who in my view should be more supportive at least publicly of Paine.\n\nI always felt Paine had the ability to be a leader and Test captain and it’s no easy task leading as a Wicket keeper but Paine does it remarkably well.\n\nOften communicating with his bowlers between overs moving up to the stumps or even changing helmets or hats. All at the same time. Having time to adjust his field.\n\nPaine below on our Insta page “Tim Paine Cricket”.\n\nAustralian cricket needs characters and real people. Tim Paine is exactly that andhe encourages others like Adam Zampa to be the same. Zampa has applied his own trademark of being a vegan in the Australian sporting landscape. It’s not easy being a leg spinner with budgysmugglers and headbands on but that’s Zampa and the way he best expresses himself as anyone should.\n\nMore to Come\n\nTim Paine Leading Doing His Best – Australian Cricket Surroundings\n\nFor any professional athlete they must be surrounded by people who are subject matter experts. Businesses do not hire people who don’t understand the basic needs of their industry.\n\nAustralian captain Tim Paine needs to have\n\nsupport from those around him. Justin Langer is also the new head coach and being accompanied on tour by a rookie media man who has never been around cricket before as an alarming development and one of concern.\n\nCricket Australia need to find the right people to support a young Australian team trying to find its feet. Langer is highly professional and the smartest of cricket brains he expects those around him in the support environment to understand these basics. These things affect the chemistry of the team long before batting or bowling averages are even examined it’s about getting the right mix of people on tour.\n\nMalcom Conn should be the media communications manger a senior writer in the sport for over 30 years. Tim Paine and the team deserve better for Australian summer and 2019 World Cup and Ashes tour.\n\nThe disappointing thing is now Australia have to bat for 2 days with 8 wickets remaining and have people around them who don’t understand the team environment of test cricket.\n\nTim Paine Leads Australia in 2nd Test with Pakistan – Nathan Lyon Stars\n\nThe Australian test skipper Tim Paine lost the coin toss on the opening day of the 2nd Test with Pakistan at Abu Dhabi but it didn’t matter as Nathan Lyon took 4 wickets in the space of an over!\n\nPakistan at one stage were 5/50! An interesting moment in the series after Australia battled so well in extreme conditions in Dubai 1st test only last week.\n\nWith temperatures expected to be in the mid to high 40s on the pitch all test match in Abu Dhabi Tim Paine and his team will be looking to bat well and resume at 2/40 on the 2nd day. Travis Head, Mitch Marsh, Paine all again have a big opportunity to set up a lead and give Australian bowlers Peter Siddle, Mitch Starc and Nathan Lyon to win the test and series 1/0.\n\nIt’s a key time for Australia playing in Asia ahead of the home summer with India and Sri Lanka Test Series.\n\nTim Paine Career Timeline – Key Matches To Date\n\nBelow is a time line of Key Matches of Tim Paine’s Career By Dan Stapleton\n\nFirst class Debut vs South Australia Hobart, December 12 to December 15 2005.

The boy from Hobart nick named the kid batted for over 3 hours for 61 not out, from the number 7 spot . After3 days of wicket keeping in extreme Dubai heat.\n\nPaine is a very gutsy player. Got the job done. A very determined man Paine battled hard in the spinning conditions.\n\nThe 2nd Test in UAE starts next Tuesday October 16. With the winner taking the 2 test series 1-0 after the draw in the Dubai series opener.\n\nUnderstanding, Establishing a New Era Takes Time\n\nComment Australia has many new factors in its corner long before we look at Day 3. People need to remember that\n\nAustralia have 4 players on this tour for the first time\n\n3 players, all fine batsmen on debut\n\nTim Paine first tour as Test captain\n\nJustin Langer New Australian coach\n\nGood things take time.\n\nAustralia face challenges good experience.\n\nBuilding for the long term\n\nUnderstanding players are people.\n\nTim Paine is a great leader and will excel but things take time people need to remember that. Australia struggle in Asia have for a very long time. Things will improve give people time.\n\nAustralia Battle Hard on Flat Wicket – Come to Life in Final Session Of 1st Test\n\nTim Paine’s Australian Test Team took 3 wickets in the final session of the opening Days play of the Dubai Test against Pakistan.\n\nA inspired spell from Peter Siddle and Mitch Starc helped off spinner Nathan Lyon get the opening wicket of the test match with a sharp catch to wicket keeper Paine.\n\nIt was a tough opening session for Australia after Pakistan won the toss and bowled. It was 45 plusOn the field as Australia searched for the opening wicket.\n\nAustralian fast bowlers Mitch Starc and PeterSiddle battled away. Bowling short spells of 3 or 4Overs before Off spinner Nathan Lyon was Introduced in the first 40 minutes of play.\n\nAussie skipper Tim Paine had lots on his mind. Often changing the players around in the extreme conditions. The tough task testing Paine but hedid very well.\n\nWearing sunblock would often ask his bowlers how they felt and what fields theywanted. A smart man Paine was keeping in his trademark compression skin’s tights (under his white Australian pants) to protect his hips which have had surgery over the years.\n\nPutting aside from finger injuries to lead the team.\n\nPerhaps more drink breaks will be called on Day 2. As the testing conditions continue. Expect Siddle, Starc and Lyon to hold the keys on the 2nd day in Dubai.\n\nTim Paine Leads Australia In Opening Test in Dubai New Era\n\nTim Paine today leads Australia into battle with Pakistan in the first test in Dubai. The match will be a new look Australia team with Paine skipper for the first time.\n\nThe match marks Travis Head, Aaron Finch and Marnus Labuschargne Test debuts along with the return of Aussie quick Peter Siddle who debuted for Australia in 2008vs India and his 1st Test since 2016.\n\nTim Paine becomes the 46th Australian Test captain the first from Hobart Tasmania.\n\nToss to come soon.\n\nTim Paine Leads Australia into 1st Test with Pakistan Following Strong Preparation\n\nAustralia have been in Dubai for 2 weeks now preparing for the opening test of the 2 test series with Pakistan\n\nThe opening test match starts on Sunday at the Dubai Cricket Stadium. Mitch Marsh, Travis Head and Shaun Marsh 150, 90 not out and 94 respectively in the warm up game with Pakistan A at the ICC Academy.\n\nSkipper Tim Paine took 6 catches and a stumping\n\nIn the match and was not required to bat.\n\nIt will be a testing series in UAE as the conditions reached 45 degrees plus each day. Testing players\n\nFitness and mental strength. Coach Justin Langer has his team well prepared for a tough test series.\n\nTravis Head and Aaron Finch along with fast bowler Michael Neser are expected to debut in Dubai.\n\nAustralia Face Pakistan A In Tour Match in Dubai\n\nTim Paine Leads Australia for his first tour in charge from 4pm AEST today when Australia play Pakistan A in a 4 day warm up in Dubai at the ICC Academy Ground.\n\nPaine and Australia will face tough conditions in the test series with temperatures expected above 43 degrees every day of the 10 day test series in October and expect 2 full day 5 test matches on flat spinning wickets that will suit Pakistan.\n\nAustralian batsmen Aaron Finch and Travis Head will be looking to make the most of the tour match this week ahead of the 1st test match in Dubai in 8 days time – Sunday October 7. It’s a challenging yet exciting time as Australia looks to establish itself under the leadership of Tim Paine and Mitch Marsh this tour.\n\nWithout former captain Steve Smith and Vice Captain David Warner it’s a very interesting time for Paine and new coach Justin Langer to take charge of the Australian team.\n\nAustralian opener Matthew Renshaw is looking to find himself at test level again after being over looked last summer but with the ban to Cameron Bancroft Renshaw has a chance for a long summer period in the Australian side.\n\nThis tour is a big chance for Australian off spin great Nathan Lyon to establish himself further in the test team along with leading pacemen Mitch Starc who will lead the attack without Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood both unable to make the tour.\n\nThe Test tour of UAE is live on Fox Cricket channel 501 on Foxtel love each day from 5pm AEST. October 7 1st Test starts\n\nTim Paine and Mitch Marsh Australian Leadership Team for Pakistan Test Series in UAE\n\nTim Paine and Mitch Marsh will lead Australia as captain and vice captain in the UAE for the 2 Test series with Pakistan from October 7.\n\nFast bowler and Co vice captain Josh Hazlewood will miss the test series recovering from injury.\n\nPaine and Marsh will look to use there close friendship and combine leadership skills as 2 experienced\n\nPlayers as Australia plays without Steve Smith and David Warner for 8 tests over the next 6 months.\n\nMore to come.\n\nTim Paine Cricket Photos of the Australian Captain\n\nAustralia in UAE to Play Pakistan in 2 Test Series from October 7\n\nAustralia have arrived in Dubai for 2 and half weeks lead into the first test from Sunday October 7. Skipper Tim Paine leads the Australian side for his first full test tour in charge having taken over the captaincy for one test match 6 months ago in South Africa when Australia played without Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft. Paine will also be without fast bowlers Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood as they rest at home ahead of the home summer with a big 4 test series with India from December.\n\nfWith the heat in Dubai expected to reach over 42 degrees every day of the short 2 test series Tim Paine has indicated that he will manage his first bowlers in short spells to combat the tough conditions. UAE is a very tough tour to play but October is one of the hottest months making it important on Mitch Starc as the leader of the attack to be on top of his game.\n\nPaine will also look to off spinner and Nathan Lyon to lead the spin attack which may also see left arm spinnner Jon Holland play 1 or both tests in the likely spinning but flat batting wickets.\n\nAustralia last toured UAE in 2014 losing the series 2-0 but expect Paine and new coach Justin Langer to well prepared. A problem last tour was lack of drink breaks and this issue is likely to be addressed before the opening test. Paine will shake hands with the Pakistan team if they agree but also expect a few more stops in play when the temps rich the high 40s. A lot to consider for Tim and his team but the experience players will stand up. Give the team support and understanding this tour and over the home summer.\n\nFox Cricket Channel 501 will have the October Test Series and T20 matches live. Tests start at 5pm AEST each day from October 7\n\nTim Paine Legend at Hard Work\n\nAussie Test skipper and Test Wicket Keeper Tim Paine hard at Work in SCG nets.\n\nTim Paine Set to Lead His First Test Tour Under Justin Langer in UAE in October\n\nAustralian Test Skipper Tim Paine is set to lead Australia for his first full test series in a short but very testing 2 Test series with Pakistan in UAE.\n\nIt’s a very exciting time for Paine and Australian coach Justin Langer 2 wonderful people who have inspired this writer for years it’s just such a shame that off field administration problems have caused for these 2.\n\nOn the field Cricket is in a very good shape despite Steve Smith, David Warner being suspended for 12 months it’s an incredible over reaction from Cricket Australia and now Paine and Langer plus the bowlers of Mitch Starc, Nathan Lyon, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood who make up most of the experience in a young squad must build over the summer at home. Cummins and Hazlewood are both injury hit and will unlikely play until late October.\n\nA young quick like Jhye Richardson must continue to lift as CA struggles with its off field leadership which must support its players more. Langer is currently working 7 days per week trying to establish his best stamp in Australian crickets most testing times. Cricket Australia is struggling for leadership under James Sutherland and its extremely wrong for people to suggest that it is ok for Australian players because they are well paid it is a sad spot currently.\n\nMitch Marsh is likely to be Vice Captain and Aaron Finch set to least make the tour as a Test player for the first time. Experienced Peter Siddle who debuted in 2008 is also likely to tour as a valued player of experience to help skipper Tim Paine.\n\nWe look to the tour and what excitement it brings.\n\nEvery ball will be on Fox Cricket on Foxtel.\n\nCricket Characters In Review Adam Zampa Leg Spinner with Character Famous Vegan\n\nAdam Zampa is perhaps the best well known leg spinner in Australia currently. Until recently a main stay of Australian sides from 2016 until 2018. Zampa plays in many T20 comps around the world the CPL in the West Indies with Jamaica and in the English T20 Comp with Essex.\n\nZampa is a real character in a time when Australian cricket is searching for its next heros. Adam is a vegan and often posts on his social media channels where he has found Vegan food places that he eats at. Also a famous player for his hair styles having copied off what we think is his idol Tim Paine (both look similar with the blonde hair at times).\n\nZampa also known to wear budgysmuggler (Aussie swimwear) at the beach and when playing cricket. Just like his famous ball towel that he carries in his playing pants. Also often wears sweat bands like Tim Paine does.\n\nTim Paine Prepares to Lead Australia Via Light Build Up with Tasmania\n\nAustralian Test Captain Tim Paine is home from the USA after a short trip with Justin Langer on learning development for the sport. Paine will train with Tasmania before heading to UAE in late September for 2 tests and a warm up match.\n\nPaine a light hearted character at times is shown below relaxing and having fun with his Tasmania team mates including sometimes Australian test bowler Jackson Bird.\n\nTim Paine Australian Test Captain – Photo from 2016\n\nTim Paine Batting Insta Photo\n\nTim Paine batting before last years Ashes in Brisbane nets.\n\nAdam Zampa Australian Cricket Character Week\n\nAdam Zampa is a leg spinner, Vegan and real character that Australian cricket needs.\n\nAs Australia struggles to find itself after the ball tampering saga the player characters like Zampa must be shown and we aim to that on the Tim Paine Cricket website a Website about the Australian team and its Players.\n\nTwitter Humour on the Tim Paine Website Account\n\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nCricket Needs Characters Not Just End Less Matches\n\nCricket Australia have many outstanding people in the current crop of players but how well do people know them. The Australian Cricket Team has long been well known names but even current Australian captain Tim Paine is not that well known by the general public . Outside of this outstanding website Paine had been a forgotten sports person until 8 months ago. Tim is a very private person and I have joked with him many times about this as have his club, state and Australian team mates. It’s his job to play Cricket but Cricket Australia have forgotten the importance of its own players.\n\nThis current Australian team is full of great people and characters and people want to know the team. Cricket Australia has forgotten how popular the football codes are in Australia. Cricket is not the only sport and unfortunately the players both male and female are being forgotten about.\n\nCharacters over the years like Shane Warne, Merv Hughes of the 1990s were house hold names and heroes. The current players such as Paine, Pat Cummins, Mitch Marsh, Adam Zampa are all very funny men in there own ways. It’s up to Cricket Australia to have players characters more well known and finding ways of providing better access.\n\nIt’s not just up to Fox Sports or Channel 7 or Channel 9 who call cover Cricket in Australia and overseas. It’s about CA making the media access more open and allowing the public and digital agencies access to the team.\n\nIt’s up to the national body to allow better access and help the game grow over the coming years.\n\nFollow @tdpainetv\n\nAustralia Tour of UAE Test Matches And Limited Overs\n\nAustralia’s tour of UAE in October for a Test Series with Pakistan under captain Tim Paine and new coach Justin Langer will be the first full tour for the New leadership group.\n\nBefore that Australia have a tour “Australia A” tour of India in September which will include the return of Mitch Marsh the key Australian all rounder and eyed by many as the obvious choice for Test match and limited overs Vice Captain along with pace bowlers Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood.\n\nTim Paine will be the Test Captain but his role in the limited overs side remains in some doubt and he may look to just play Test Cricket to extent his test career. Alex Carey a smart wicket keeper who has impressed many including Paine.\n\nFast bowlers Mitch Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood are all hopeful of touring the UAE however Cummins remains under injury cloud and may not return until November when South Africa tour Australia for a 3 Match ODI series.\n\nThe tour dates for Australia’s tour of the UAE remain unknown in a some what concerning state considering the tour dates for next years Ashes have already been released.\n\nThe Australian Cricket Team will be selected by Justin Langer, Trevor Hohns and Greg Chappell after Mark Waugh is leaving his post to be a full time commentator with Fox Sports new Fox Cricket channel.\n\nThe Tour of UAE continues the new era under Tim Paine who has been extremely impressive in his test match return since coming back into the squad in November last year and will lead a team without Steve Smith and David Warner until April 2019.\n\nAustralian Cricket Attention Turns To Test Cricket Under Tim Paine\n\nAustralia’s Test Cricket Team must be the number point moving forward. Winning World Cups is important but Test Cricket and the values of the treasured Baggy Green must remain the number one aim for Justin Langer’s Australian Test side. Captain Tim Paine holds the highest honour in Australian Cricket currently, captaining the Australian Test side.\n\nThe Australian T20 side this week tours Zimbabwe for a tri series with Zimbabwe and Pakistan with all matches played at the Harare Sports Club. It seems to be strange and disappointing time for a tour of this kind. While it’s exciting for young Australian players the truth is that Cricket Australia have canceled a home test series with Bangladesh in August saying “people don’t care for a series with football nearing finals” a very poor excuse in my view by Cricket Australia.\n\nTim Paine and Soon to be appointed Vice Captain Pat Cummins have a very challenging period ahead for them over the coming months rebuilding the faith in Cricket community and with the Australian public but it’s not just up to the players they need better support from Cricket Australia a organisation who currently are having many questions raised. The lack of promotion around its own players domestically and internationally is a area that the organisation must improve on. The current captain has been let down in my view by his state and now CA they are not doing enough to help there captain. He represents them doing his best in extremely difficult times with Steve Smith and David Warner both making their respective return s to Cricket in the newly formed “Global T20 Canada Tournament”.\n\nAustralia havd a brilliant opportunity to build a impressive winning culture with a Test series against Pakistain in October before a 4 test series in Australia in December and January before 2 tests in Brisbane and Canberra against Sri Lanka 2 teams that often struggle with the extra bounce of Australian wickets.\n\nComment On Experienced Players As Australia Move Forward\n\nAustralian One day and test skipper Tim Paine will now concrete on Test Cricket and consider his one day future after a very difficult and challenging limited overs series in England which saw a greatly under strength Australian side lose the series 5-0.\n\nAustralia next face Pakistan in Test Cricket and Tim Paine will once again lead Australia for the first time In Test Cricket since the South Africa series which saw skipper Steve Smith and vice captain David Warner banned for 12 months.\n\nPaines experience along with fast bowlers Mitch Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood will be\n\nvital leading into the challenges of the next year with India touring Australia next summer and the Ashes in England in July 2019.\n\nTest Cricket for me remains the most important format of the game testing players over 5 days.\n\nTim Paine Plays on With Hit to Face after Nasty Bounce in Testing ODIs With England\n\nTim Paine the tough Australian captain again displayed his mental toughness to block out a nasty injury and complete the 2nd ODI after a lifting seam bounced twice as Paine bent down on his knee to collect the ball in his gloves only for a late bounce to lift higher than expected and hit his face including a tooth to being adjusted and then removed by the Australian Team doctor on the field.\n\nIt’s very important for Australia that Tim Paine plays on for some time given his invaluable experience while Australia wants to win every match it’s also very important in the long term to have some stability for a fine side that Australia is striving to be. His on field actions and inspirational moves to play on with Pain have been evident over last Ashes summer when hit on the hand in Perth and Adelaide tests. Then a painful blow while keeping up to the stumps to new Australian pace bowler Chadd Sayers with South African Keeper batsman De Kock on strike.\n\nGame 3 with England takes place on Tuesday at Trent Bridge\n\nNote On Tim Paine Cricket Website Next Few Months\n\nTo our dear Readers the Tim Paine Cricket website from today and Digital Media Channels (twitter Instagram ect) will have additional content some of which is going to branding as the website admin undertakes University assessments. The Website will continue to expand its Tim Paine and Australian Team coverage in general as we look to make the website the ultimate resource for Tim Paine information. This currently remains the only dedicated Media channels on the current Australian Test Wicket Keeper and skipper Tim Paine."
