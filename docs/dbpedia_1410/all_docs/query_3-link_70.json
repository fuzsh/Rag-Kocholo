        "text": "by Cricbuzz Staff • Published on\n\nThe 37-year-old will end his playing career with Tasmania and the Hobart Hurricanes in early February before joining the National Selection Panel © Getty\n\nFormer Australian skipper George Bailey is all set to become a full-time national selector at the conclusion of the upcoming Big Bash League, Cricket Australia announced on Wednesday (November 27).\n\nBailey, aged 37, will end his playing career with Tasmania and the Hobart Hurricanes in early February before joining the National Selection Panel for the Australian men's cricket team\n\nBailey has played 125 internationals across formats for Australia with a decent average and had been part of the Ashes winning team in 2013-14. The Tasmanian, during March 2012, was one of the first to be appointed as Australian captain in a debut game since 1877. Bailey has been a regular in the Tasmania set-up for the last fifteen years and is known to have a nose for identifying talents across the country.\n\n\"We're thrilled to have George join the National Selection Panel. He is an outstanding leader and one of the most respected, thoughtful and generous figures in international cricket,\" Ben Oliver, EGM of National Teams, said of the appointment.\n\n\"George's international and domestic playing career speaks for itself. His extensive experience across all formats, and deep knowledge of T20 cricket, will be invaluable as we head into a home T20 World Cup and beyond.We're also excited about the broader impact that George will have on Australian cricket as we work to connect more closely with players, coaches and high performance staff across the country,\" he added.\n\nDominic Baker, Cricket Tasmania's Chief Executive also chorused Oliver's views and congratulated Bailey on his new role. \"George has been the heart and soul of Tasmanian cricket for well over a decade and, on behalf of all Tasmanians, I thank him for his dedication, commitment and passion for the cause,\" Baker said. \"I have no doubt George will make an outstanding Selector and will provide Australian cricket with the same wisdom, drive and purpose that has defined his time with Tasmania,\" Baker said.\n\nBailey, who represented Australia in five Tests, 90 ODIs and 30 T20Is, said that he's \"been fortunate enough to contribute as a player for quite a few years, and to now have the opportunity to continue in the role of selector is a tremendous honour.\"\n\n\"I am passionate about the long-term success of the Australian cricket team and advancing the cause of Australian cricket in general,\" Bailey added. \"I'm confident I can add value to the selection process and that my experience will be complementary to that of Trevor and Justin. I am really excited to be joining them in the coming months.\"\n\n© Cricbuzz\n\nShareTweet"
