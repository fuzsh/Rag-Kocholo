        "text": "George Bailey has explained the reasoning behind Cameron Bancroft's omission from the Australian Test squad to face the West Indies, admitting it was a \"line-ball decision\" in the race to replace the outgoing David Warner.\n\nAfter the veteran opener bowed out last week in Sydney, speculation had been mounting regarding the composition of the top-order, with a litany of players in the mix to fill Warner's massive shoes.\n\nThe selection panel has since confirmed that Bancroft - who leads the Sheffield Shield run-scoring tally this season - has been overlooked, with Steve Smith set to open the batting and Matt Renshaw named as a reverse batter, while star all-rounder Cameron Green has earned a recall in the No.4 position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nREAD MORE: Aussie star's career on life support after missing ODI squad\n\nREAD MORE: Origin gun snubs rivals to sign 'richest ever' Knights deal\n\nREAD MORE: Jordan Thompson's hilarious plea to Benji Marshall\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, Bailey revealed the call came down to their desire to bring Green back into the fold, as well as Renshaw's past 18 months in first-class and Test cricket.\n\n\"I think ultimately, you can mount a statistically strong case for a number of players, and Cam is one of those,\" he said.\n\n\"Cam's Sheffield Shield record over the past couple of years has obviously been phenomenal, and it's made this decision really challenging and a line-ball call.\n\n\"He is banging down the door … it's not a bad thing that you are having to make line-ball decisions, it's actually a really good thing.\n\n\"Ultimately, the decision to get Cam [Green] into the team was to have our best six batters playing. As it currently stands, the panel sees Matt Renshaw as our next-best.\n\n\"We've gone back 18 months or so and if you take into account all first-class cricket across that time … his [Renshaw] numbers stack up as well as anyone.\"\n\nBancroft has amassed 512 runs at 56.88 for Western Australia in their campaign, with his adversary Renshaw only scoring 348 runs in the same amount of appearances, leading to question marks across the board.\n\nHowever, the lingering impact of the 2018 ball-tampering scandal did not play into the selection panel's decision to snub Bancroft, said Bailey, with the ex-Test player vehemently denying those claims during his press conference.\n\n\"Categorically, no,\" he said.\n\n\"I've shared this with Cameron on a number of occasions. It has never, at any stage, been discussed from the panel's perspective, and it is purely a cricketing decision.\n\n\"There is not a member of the team that would have an issue with Cam playing and we certainly don't have an issue with it.\n\n\"People tend to forget that Cam has actually played a Test match since returning from the ban. It was a long time ago, we've all moved past that.\n\n\"I'd be disappointed if people were looking to that as a reason … it never has been and it never will be.\"\n\nBancroft will continue his domestic run with the Sydney Thunder on Friday night - potentially opening the batting alongside Warner and opposite Smith - before returning to Shield duties with WA next month.\n\nAustralia will kick off their two-game Test series against the Windies on January 17."
