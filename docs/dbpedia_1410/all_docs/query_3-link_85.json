I had a great time at the Ageas Bowl back in 2013 and I'm really excited about the progress the squad has made over the last few years.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to doing my bit to contribute to a successful period ahead with Hampshire Cricket.\"\n\nBailey, who has also played county cricket for Middlesex and Sussex, has made 121 appearances across all three formats since making his international debut for Australia in 2012 and has played 514 domestic matches, accumulating more than 21,000 runs across his 12-year career.\n\nThe right-hander has also captained his Australian state side Tasmania as well as having stints as Australia's limited-overs captain in two World T20 campaigns and during the 2015 World Cup.\n\nHampshire director of cricket Giles White said: \"George has an excellent record across all formats of the game, has captained his country and is highly regarded as a person.\n\n\"He made a lasting impression during his previous stint with us and we are delighted to have him at Hampshire for the next couple of years.\""
