        "text": "New WA coach isn't Mickey MouseJOHN TOWNSEND, The West Australian May 1, 2010, 10:15 am Buzz up! Send\n\nEmail\n\nIM\n\nShare\n\nDeliciousTwitterMyspaceDiggStumble UponFacebook\n\nPrint\n\nMickey Arthur has opened the door for sacked South Australian Mark Cosgrove to move to WA after saying the State team needed an experienced top-order batsman to complement its trio of internationals.\n\nArthur arrived in Perth yesterday to take up his three-year contract as Warriors coach and said he would start work immediately to lift WA cricket from its current doldrums.\n\n\"The job starts today,\" he said.\n\nArthur confirmed he had reports on Cosgrove's potential value after the heavyweight left-hander was axed following a series of disciplinary issues with the Redbacks.\n\nBut Arthur said he recognised that WA needed another high-quality top-order batsman, given that Marcus North, Adam Voges and Shaun Marsh were likely to have international commitments during the season.\n\n\"I don't know enough about Mark Cosgrove, but I have done some homework on him and have had conflicting reports,\" Arthur said.\n\n\"What I do think is that we possibly need another experienced batsman because runs on the board are a key.\n\n\"Scoreboard pressure makes a bowling attack a whole lot stronger and that allows a spinner to come into the game in four-day cricket, which is something WA have lacked for a bit.\n\n\"In terms of our erratic top-order batting, we clearly need another experienced player there. We have Marcus North, Adam Voges and Shaun Marsh, but we only see them sporadically, so in my opinion we need a guy who will be around permanently and be somebody that the younger players can feed off.\"\n\nThe coming week will be one of Arthur's most critical, with an assistant coach to be appointed in the next few days and the first round of player contracts to be lodged with Cricket Australia on Wednesday. The WACA has already axed several State players, including batsman Theo Doropoulos, leg-spinner Josh Mangan and all-rounder Justin Coetzee.\n\nIt is understood Arthur insisted WA retain spinner Aaron Heal, despite the selectors looking to cut him.\n\nFormer Australian paceman Jason Gillespie and WA international Brad Hogg are candidates to become Arthur's assistant. The former South African coach would not be drawn on whether fellow countryman, former paceman Allan Donald, also would be considered.\n\nArthur said he was excited about the challenge after helping steer South Africa to the pinnacle of world cricket in 2008.\n\nHis coaching philosophy would not change, with a series of non-negotiable parameters being applied. Every player would become clearly aware of their role.\n\n\"My major strength is managing and handling players and making sure they know exactly where they stand and what their roles are,\" he said. \"It is paramount that guys must know what is expected of them. I will lay down those parameters to the players.\n\n\"There may be a little bit more required to tweak things technically at domestic level, but I am really looking forward to that.\n\n\"At international level it is more about managing players, managing teams and managing selections, but I am really looking forward to doing some hands-on coaching again.\n\n\"I have a series of non-negotiables and the players will know exactly where they stand.\n\n\"If you want to be successful and you want to be sustainable, there are non-negotiables. There are sacrifices that need to be made. There has to be a really strong work ethic, which is not to say that wasn't the case under Tom (Moody), but I will get stuck in and do it my way.\"\n\nTasmania 1st round contracts\n\nTasmania squad: George Bailey, Travis Birt, Luke Butterworth, Steven Cazzulino, Ed Cowan, Gerard Denton, Xavier Doherty, Alex Doolan, Brendan Drew, James Faulkner, Brett Geeves, Adam Griffith, Ben Hilfenhaus (Cricket Australia contract), Jason Krejza, Rhett Lockyear, Tim Macdonald, Adam Maher, Tim Paine (CA), Ricky Ponting (CA), Jon Wells.\n\nRookies: Matthew Day, Brady Jones, Hamish Kingston, Jeremy Smith, Tom Triffitt\n\narticle:\n\nThe veteran batsman Michael Dighton has been left out of Tasmania's list of contracted players for 2010-11, a group with few other changes from last season's squad. The Tigers lost Daniel Marsh to retirement and did not re-sign the rookies John Rogers and Wade Irvine in the first round of offers, but the absence of Dighton was more of a surprise.\n\nAlthough he has not been part of the first-class team since November 2008, Dighton, 34, has remained an important part of the Tasmania top order in the 50-over format. He played every match in their triumphant FR Cup campaign and two months ago scored 80 in their victory over Victoria in the final, and the coach Tim Coyle said Dighton could yet remain in the mix.\n\n\"He's played well for a number of years but his form, he would admit, has fluctuated in recent times,\" Coyle told Cricinfo. \"He played a very good innings in the final but up to then he'd had an average year, and he would have admitted that himself. We know he's a quality player so we'll just see how things roll out next week.\"\n\nThe states must finalise their full lists by next Thursday, meaning Dighton could yet win a contract in the second round of offers. However, there is a large group of axed players from other states searching for a home this season, including several top-order batsman such as Mark Cosgrove, Nick Kruger, Greg Moller and Lloyd Mash.\n\nThe Tigers have added to their squad the batsman Steven Cazzulino, 23, who was the leading run scorer in Sydney grade cricket last summer with 1289 at 71.61. A left-hand opener who can bat for long periods, Cazzulino will aim to become Ed Cowan's opening partner in the Sheffield Shield after Jon Wells and Rhett Lockyear struggled to make the position their own in 2009-10.\n\nThere was no room for Rogers or Irvine in the first round of offers, while the bowler Hamish Kingston, 19, won a rookie contract. Despite finishing second last on the Sheffield Shield table last season, Tasmania were keen to retain stability by backing the core of their existing young squad.\n\n\"We've shown some faith in quite a number of people,\" Coyle said. \"We had a number of new faces into the team last year. Having another major cleanout this year could have destablised the group.\n\n\"We blooded some players last year who did quite well - Alex Doolan, Brady Jones had some time as the wicketkeeper, Adam Maher played some cricket - all new players and developing players. There's still a lot of improvement in the group that we have.\"\n\nJason Krejza will spend the next couple of months recovering from hip surgery this week, although he is expected to be fully fit for the start of the pre-season. The other major injury worry is the ongoing knee problem for Ben Hilfenhaus, who this week started bowling again at the Centre of Excellence and is targeting the Australia A series against Sri Lanka A in late June for a possible comeback.\n\nSearch The West\n\nSEARCH\n\nPerth [change]\n\nMostly sunny\n\nMax33° Min18° Sponsored By\n\nMarsh earns full-time contract with WAAAP May 5, 2010, 7:28 pm Buzz up!
