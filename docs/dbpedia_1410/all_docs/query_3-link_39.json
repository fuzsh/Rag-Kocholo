        "text": "George Bailey by his portrait at Bellerive Oval. Picture by Cricket Tasmania\n\nAs his portrait was unveiled at Bellerive Oval, former Tasmanian captain George Bailey painted a vivid picture of his new role as national chairman of selectors.\n\nSubscribe now for unlimited access .\n\nor signup to continue reading\n\nAll articles from our website & app\n\nThe digital version of Today's Paper\n\nBreaking news alerts direct to your inbox\n\nInteractive Crosswords, Sudoku and Trivia\n\nAll articles from the other in your area\n\nThe popular 40-year-old former South Launceston batsman opened up about his transition from a hugely successful playing career which included Sheffield Shield, Ashes and World Cup triumphs.\n\n\"I still feel it's not that long ago since the playing part finished but I'm still loving the fact that I get to be involved at the Australian level and still get to see so much domestic cricket and spend some time around the Tasmanian group and other state groups as well,\" he said.\n\n\"So in some very small way, I'm very happy to still be involved.\"\n\nModestly acknowledging his granting of Cricket Tasmania life membership and his portrait by artist Effie Pryer, Bailey said he was loving his latest off-field responsibility.\n\nHe was excited by Hobart Hurricane Tim David's inclusion in the Twenty20 World Cup squad, delighted that struggling One-Day International captain Aaron Finch was able to retire on his own terms, called Test equivalent Pat Cummins an \"outstanding leader\" and revealed how Cummins' predecessor Tim Paine was pleased to be back playing the game he loves, if a little \"sore and rusty\".\n\nBailey was also pleased to see the ramping up of the Australia A program and felt the Tasmanian program was in a healthy state with an exciting mix of players on the fringes of Australian squads or aspiring to make them.\n\nHe said national selector was an \"invigorating role\".\n\n\"I was never a great cricket watcher while playing but I really enjoy it now. Not being so nervous and just being able to watch and enjoy other people's success and appreciate the contest.\n\n\"If they do well, we take credit and if not, it's their fault.\"\n\nOne of a select few Cricket Tasmania life members, Bailey, who played 90 ODIs, 30 T20is and five Test matches, said he was humbled to be recognised.\n\nIf they do well, we take credit and if not, it's their fault\n\n- Australian chairman of selectors George Bailey\n\n\"I'm very happy with the work Effie's done. It's not a face that needs painting very often.\n\n\"When you look around some of the other paintings in this room, they're all heroes of mine so to be up alongside them is very humbling.\n\n\"I have never thought I'd like to be painted so very grateful to Cricket Tasmania. This ground has felt like home for so many years and I get to continue that for the next part of my life as well.\n\nDAILY\n\nYour morning news\n\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.
