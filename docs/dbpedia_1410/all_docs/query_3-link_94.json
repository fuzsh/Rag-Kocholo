        "text": "After two brilliant seasons for St George Nathan Ellis was at that very common crossroad that many high quality performers are faced with. Should I stay or should I go?\n\nOn one hand one realises their cricket has gone to the next level thanks to the nursery they were in. Do they continue to develop and try their luck in the very difficult NSW system or do they make the massive sacrifice and go interstate. It’s a lottery to say the least.\n\nThis is where Nathan Ellis found himself in 2017.\n\nAs the 2019-20 season would demonstrate Nathan Ellis made the correct choice .... unlike many before him. He had what is known as the “Breakout” season but as you will read it wasn’t without trial and tribulation.\n\nNathan quickly propelled himself to one of the form cricketers of all three formats. Who’s knows where to from here.\n\nFirstly congratulations on an amazing season. Can you believe how the season played out for yourself?\n\nThanks very much. I’d absolutely be lying if I was to say that I saw this season coming. If you had told me in June 2019 what the upcoming season was to have in store for me, I would have laughed in your face. Cliché I know, but even at this moment, it still doesn’t feel like it really happened.\n\nWe could probably now put you into the journeyman category, tell us a little bit about where your cricketing journey began?\n\nI guess I'm a bit of journeyman now, but it wasn’t something that I planned. It was an interesting start for me. I started a little later than most, my first season was the Under 10's where I started my cricketing journey in the 10Cs wearing my white SHORTS for the Illawong Menai Kookaburras. It was then that I fell in love with the game. I remember bowling and loving to hit those plastic orange stumps that would splatter everywhere and rebound right back up afterward. But it was with the Kookaburras that I played all my junior cricket until finishing in the Under 16's. We actually had an unbelievably talented age group, with a handful of the boys going on to play first grade all around Sydney. I think we won 6 premierships from the Under 12's up.\n\nDid the game come easy to you from the start or did you have to battle hard in Juniors?\n\nFrom memory fast bowling was something that I always did, and always loved, and I was fortunate with my team that I had a pretty successful and easy ride at the very start. But it was around the age of 14 or 15 where it became not ‘just kids cricket’ anymore, and things like stereotypes and opinions really started to matter. I remember after being a regular member of the Sutherland representative side with a lot of my best mates that I had known for years, I got dropped to the ‘Presidents Shield’, which is the second XI. The reason being that this was the year we moved from synthetic wickets to turf wickets, and with my height and action, I was told at 14 that I “wasn’t a turf bowler”. At this age you think the world’s going to end, and I remember worrying not only that the cricketing dream was over, but that I wouldn’t get to spend my Sundays in summer with my best mates any more. I ended up playing in the Presidents, doing well, and thankfully I got to play my final year of reps with my mates in the Under 16's before moving into Green Shield with Randwick-Petersham. So I would say I had a pretty easy ride, but it was at an early age where I started to hit some physical barriers that I have ended up dealing with through my whole career, and still to this day.\n\nWhen did you first think to yourself, I might just have what it takes to play 1st class cricket?\n\nMate the short answer is I MAYBE felt it after my second first class game against the Blues. It’s a funny one, I have been told repeatedly over the last 3-4 years that my way in is through the white ball formats, and I think having being told it so much, I genuinely started to believe it. But even after getting my opportunity to play Shield Cricket with the mystical red ball, after a large number of injuries at Cricket Tasmania, I certainly struggled, and definitely still do struggle with believing that I belong there. But it’s funny, after talking with a few players, and in depth with St George’s prodigal son ‘Copes’, (Trent Copeland) I learnt that most players have felt it, and still do feel it, even after achieving great heights in the game.\n\nWhat was the catalyst behind leaving Randwick-Petersham to come to St George?\n\nI played 5 seasons at Randwick, and by slowly making the climb from 5th grade to 1st grade, I met some great people, who taught me a lot about my cricket and the game in general. Whilst RP's were usually a very very strong 1st grade side, they were always looking outside as well as inside to be stronger. At this point I’d had two pretty successful first grade seasons, and had just started taking the new ball. Recruitment took place, and it looked like I’d be taking a backward step, and bowling first change. Selfishly maybe (but I really didn’t want to take that backward step) and in order to make it to the next level, I knew I would have to be opening the bowling, and taking wickets. To be honest I think the ball started rolling after talking to Michael Turnbull after a few too many at Argyle, and by the Monday I had a meeting with Gav Twining and Wayne Turnbull. But it was always about opportunity for me, and there was no better opportunity than playing at one of the most prestigious clubs in the country, opening the bowling with Copes, at Hurstville, with the likes of Moey (Moises Henriques), and KP (Kurtis Patterson) watching on. The decision was one of the best I have ever made.\n\nYou appear to be the sort of cricketer that sponges from the Senior cricketers you play with, who at St George provided you with what you needed?\n\nThere is no doubt that the older, more experienced players at a grade club are the heart and soul of a successful cricket club. I feel like in every grade team I’ve played in I have always tried to be coachable and learn from the older guys in the team. Playing for St George, there are three guys that stick out in my mind as having the biggest impact on me. First, and this has been pretty well documented, is Copes. He was one of the main reasons I came to Saints, and from the outset he had a huge impact on my game, and is still a major mentor for me, despite being a competitor at times as well. Ironically, Copes’ first piece of advice for me was that I didn’t bowl my bouncer enough. So I naturally had a little chuckle to myself when he came out to bat at Blundstone Arena and Painey put a short leg in and said “Bounce him first ball”.\n\nSecond, was Steve Cazzulino. I met Cazz on a cricket camp in India, we roomed together and me being a cricket nuff, and him being a first class cricketer, I naturally chewed his ear off of a night-time asking things like “so what’s \"Punter\" like”. But Cazz fielding at mid-off, always knew what to say to me and when to say it. He also played a vital role in me moving to Tasmania, and I now play for the same club down there in Lindisfarne as he did.\n\nLastly is a club stalwart in Stewo McCabe. One of the most natural and talented players I played alongside, but also one of the most ruthless. Stewo and I got on really well off and on the field, but I think his captaincy also got the best out of me. That being spraying me from gully saying “enough with the 110km half volleys”, when I’m bowling poorly to fire me up. But also, being ruthlessly aggressive when the game was on the line.\n\nTrent Copeland\n\nNow that one takes such a giant leap going from one level to another, do you dare to dream about the next step?\n\nGot another cliché for you! For me it is genuinely one game at a time. I have just come off a season where I didn’t start with a contract, so I genuinely felt as if I was playing for my career in every game I played. I obviously want to play as high a level as I can, that’s the dream that we all have. But I’m just so stoked to be getting a gig, and I just want to play, and compete for as long as I can.\n\nIn my opinion you set yourself apart from some of your former contemporaries due to a combination of some key attributes other than just natural ability. What are some of these strengths that you would advise younger cricketers to take care of instead of simply focusing on work in the nets?\n\nObviously you have to work on your skills as we all do. But one thing I would love to tell my younger self is to emphasize goal setting, work out how you’re going to get there, and then trust the journey. IT’S NOT A RUSH. From my own experience I’d say give yourself the best chance to perform each weekend by looking after yourself and working on your skills, but just try to relax and take it one game at a time. I think I felt like it had to happen overnight, and I feel like that’s a common mindset among people my age and younger. Try and be patient and prepare yourself with the hard work, and you will enjoy it a lot more I feel.\n\nHow does someone who works so hard take things to the next level?\n\nBen Rohrer is now a coach in Tasmania, and he actually said something to me after my first or second year in Tassie after having a good season, and it has really stuck with me to this day. He said “Some blokes just have to wait longer than others”. It sucks but in cricket it’s true. Rohrs himself didn’t get his first contract until 27 or 28. So 100% it’s persistence, banging down the door by taking wickets, and scoring runs until they cannot ignore you anymore. It’s just that some have to bang on the door for longer.\n\nWe are obviously living in very strange time currently as Australia and the world take on Covid-19. What is Nathan Ellis doing to be ready for next season?\n\nSo strange! I am currently in Sydney at my family home, spending time with mum and Alan which has been nice, although I reckon their grocery bill has tripled. I have a little home gym setup, and have been doing a fair bit of running, and swimming to keep both fit and sane. Other than that it’s been Netflix and playstation like most of us. Actually I just finished Tiger king on Netflix, what a rollercoaster that is!\n\nDid it spoil of your plans for the 2020 Winter?\n\nI originally flew out to spend 6 weeks visiting my Fiancé and her family in the UK, but unfortunately due to Covid I had to fly home after 4 days, which was a real shame. I had to do the 14 day isolation, and for someone who has been told I have undiagnosed ADD, it was quite the challenge.\n\nI imagine leaving Sydney for Tasmania hasn't been easy. How close have you been to coming back to Sydney?\n\nIn July last year I had all but started packing. Moving away from home, away from family and friends obviously had its challenges. I had two really good seasons in first grade, with minimal second XI opportunity, so I was pretty content that I had given it a fair crack, and I was ready to come home and start growing up, and build a career of some sort. But at the last minute the head coach Adam Griffith called me in to his office, and asked me to do the pre-season with the full squad, but still no contract offer. He properly dangled the carrot in front of me, and I still thought about moving back home. But it was the fear of regret later in life that kept me down there. And gee I’m glad I stayed!!\n\nWhat do you like about life in Hobart?\n\nThe longer I’ve been down there, the more I love it. No doubt it’s a small place, and a lot slower pace than Sydney. But it is a beautiful place. You’re half an hour from the beach, half an hour from wineries and farm land, and you’re 5 minutes from the CBD. You sort of get the best of everything. Also, I cannot recommend the east coast of Tasmania highly enough.\n\nInitial selection and success for Tasmania followed by a great BBL campaign for the Hobart Hurricanes was there a feeling that you may then by pigeonholed as a white ball specialist or was there some indication that you may see some Sheffield Shield action?\n\nI was told countless times that white ball was my pathway in and the majority of my training revolved around one day and T20 cricket. Even whilst playing One day cricket for Tassie, and BBL with the Hurricanes, I couldn’t get a Futures league game in the red ball four day cricket. So because of this, Shield cricket wasn’t even on my radar. I thankfully got a futures game in Adelaide and bowled well, and then I was in the right place at the right time. A few bowlers went down with injuries, adding to the long list of injured Tassie quicks at the time. I was luckily one of the few fit bowlers and got my shot. It was quite a whirlwind really, but the timing was everything.\n\nWho would you count as being instrumental in your rise to forefront of Domestic Cricket in the 19-20 season?\n\nWe were lucky last season with having quite a few older, more experienced heads in the squad, who were always willing to offer some guidance to the younger players. George Bailey is one who I suspect played a major role for me. There was a preseason trip to Darwin that I unfortunately wasn’t selected to go on, and at the time Bails was coming back from his shoulder injury, and Jackson Bird was also with us In Hobart. So I spent the best part of 2 weeks bowling with Jacko, and bowling to Bails. I felt like I was bowling really well, and Bails was really positive, and invested in helping me improve. 10 days later I was selected in the squad for the first one day domestic game of the season in Perth, and told I was going to be making my debut. It really came out of nowhere, but upon reflection, and whilst he has never said anything to me, I am almost certain that Bails played a massive role in me getting my start. Turned out, that not getting selected on the preseason tour was really a blessing in disguise.\n\nAs well as this, Matthew Wade was huge for me in the BBL. I genuinely doubt he knew who I was when I signed my Hurricanes contract, but once I started playing, and he was working alongside me, I really found his straight forward, ruthless, but clear captaincy really worked for my style of bowling. He was actually really nurturing off the field too, and helped me feel more comfortable at that level despite his intimidating presence.\n\nThe same could be said for my Shield games. It was pretty amazing having the Australian test captain as my captain for my debut. And even in the lead up to my debut, Painey went out of his way to make it one of the most meaningful, and memorable weeks of my life.\n\nThere have been some unbelievable images taken of you bowling which I guess underlines the effort you put in when you bowl. How's the body holding up?\n\nThere is a lot going on in my bowling action, so I guess between that and me face planting once or twice a spell, it’s a pretty good photo op. The body is pretty good! Last season was definitely a shock to the system, and I had to learn little things like what recovery works best for me, and the importance of listening to your body. But all in all I am right as rain, and ready for next season!\n\nIs there a particular type of delivery where you become so airborne?\n\nI honestly have no idea. This is going to sound very strange but I genuinely think it’s a combination of an effort ball, and me wanting to see the outcome and forgetting to put my right foot down in time. I wouldn’t recommend it.\n\nThe talk has been all about your bowling but in your 2nd season with the Saints we saw a dramatic improvement to your batting where you emerged as a genuine allrounder. Do you believe there is potential for you at state level or are you encouraged to focus more on bowling in order to get optimum results?\n\nI absolutely love batting. I have always said that if I ever had a child that wants to play cricket, I’m going to make them be a number 4 batter, who bowls left arm tweakers. It is a batters game after all…\n\nAs bowlers we are really encouraged to work hard on our batting and during the pre-season we do a heap of role specific work. For example last 5 overs in a one dayer, or nightwatchmen facing fast bouncers etc. But I really want to lock down the number 8 or 9 role. To be able to score some late order runs, or get a top order batsmen to their hundred. As I said I love it, but struggle sometimes to fight the mental demons (as we all do) telling us to hit sixes every second ball, or ramp the opening bowler. Just me?\n\nFinally, where do you personally see Nathan Ellis in 5 years time?\n\nI feel that as of right now I am at a pretty crucial point in my career. You know, I have had one year on the big stage, I have been able to compete in most games, but it is such a volatile industry. One bad year and I could be back mowing lawns, or one good year, and who knows what could happen. So ideally I want to keep competing, and make myself un-droppable. I want to play as much cricket as I can, and push for higher honours, as I’m sure we all want to. So in 5 years time I just want to have played as much cricket as possible, and know that I have given myself the best opportunity to succeed, left nothing in the tank, and tried to soak it up, and enjoy it as much as I can."
