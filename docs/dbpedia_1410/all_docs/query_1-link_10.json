        "text": "Retiring cricket veteran Matthew Wade has been left frustrated after he was dismissed for just one run as Tasmania face a tough task in the Sheffield Shield final. Despite a late fightback, Western Australia started day two in a strong position at 8-325 at the WACA Ground, with Whiteman (104 off 154 balls), Connolly (73no off 79 balls) and veteran D'Arcy Short (50 off 127 balls) all performing for the reigning champions.\n\nTasmania bowled WA out for 347, which saw retiring cricket star Wade enter the crease in his 166th first class match. Unfortunately for the former Aussie wicketkeeper, the WACA pitch left him wanting.\n\nWade was on one off 11 balls when he was trapped in front from a darting Cameron Gannon delivery. Tasmania managed to rally after Wade's wicket having steadied the ship to reach 1-65 at lunch.\n\nWade would be disappointed with his effort, which will leave him one more opportunity to bat before calling time on his red-ball career. The veteran has 9183 runs at an average of 40.81 in first-class cricket, as well as 442 catches and 21 stumpings.\n\nWade played 36 Test matches for Australia and the 36-year-old called a press conference on Friday morning after telling teammates of his decision before Tasmania loss to South Australia in their final game of the Shield regular season earlier this week. Wade will be hoping to go out as a winner for Tasmania having never lifted the Sheffield Shield for his home state. However, Wade has won four Shield titles with Victoria - including two as captain.\n\nCooper Connolly stands up amid Bancroft loss\n\nCameron Bancroft did not take to the crease on the first day of the Sheffield Shield final after being ruled out due to concussion after a cycling accident before the match. And without their star man, Cooper Connolly's stepped up. The batter hit his first 32 runs in boundaries and he reached his maiden Shield half-century off just 48 balls.\n\nCooper attacked the Tasmanian bowling line-up and hit 10 fours and three sixes on his way to a 73. \"He's just a kid that's got no scars about batting,\" Sam Whiteman said.\n\n\"He just goes out and sees the ball and hits the ball. He's so talented. \"I'm pumped for him. He didn't even look nervous. He seems like a pretty chilled guy. He's pretty special.\"\n\nConnolly was set to play in the first Shield game of this season, but had to wait after he broke a toe while jumping off a boat. Despite the setback, Connelly made up for it in the final and will be hoping his knock helps the state lift a third straight Sheffield Shield title."
