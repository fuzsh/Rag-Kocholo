Added to it is the bad from that Paine has shown in his return to playing cricket for Tasmania second XI against South Australia.   With all things going on around Paine, his close friend and Australia’s chief selector George Bailey has pulled out of voting on Paine’s selection in the playing XI for the first Ashes Test starting on December 08 at the Gabba.   \"If the panel was not in agreeance on Tim's position going forward, and it was going to come down to a vote, then I would step aside and leave that to Tony and Justin to work through. They're both aware of that,\" Bailey was quoted as saying in the Cricket Etc podcast.  Usually, the selection panel comprises Chief selector Bailey, coach Justin Langer and the recently appointed Tony Dodemaide.  Reasoning as to why he is pulling out, Bailey said, \"By saying that (he would recuse himself of a vote on Paine), it sounds like Tim is the only close friend I have. Since the day I was given the opportunity to have that role, we've been aware that that's the case. I have strong friendships and relationships that go back a number of years with the players,\" said Bailey.  Bailey and Paine have been friends and playing mates for the last 15 years.",
