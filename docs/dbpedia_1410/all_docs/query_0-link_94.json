        "text": "South Australia squad Cullen Bailey, Cameron Borgas, Daniel Christian, Mark Cleary, Tom Cooper, Mark Cosgrove, Dan Cullen, Chris Duval, Callum Ferguson (CA), Peter George, Jake Haberfield, Daniel Harris, Michael Klinger, Graham Manou (CA), Aaron O'Brien, Gary Putland, Paul Rofe, James Smith, Shaun Tait (CA), Matthew Weeks, Allan Wise\n\nRookies Michael Cranmer, Cameron Francis, Kane Richardson.\n\nVery few changes to the squad from last year, with the only interstate recruit being Chris Duval from Tasmania. While Weeks, Smith and Haberfield have also joined the squad for the upcoming season.\n\nOverall it's a fairly strong looking squad, although I'm not sure about the number of quick bowlers with contracts. Of the 21 players in the squad, 9 are fast bowlers. And with the strong performances from Cleary, George and Haberfield at the end of last season and the inclusion of Duval and hopefully more from Tait, I can't see how Wise or Weeks are going to get games.\n\nHopefully we continue playing the young kids like Cooper, George and Haberfield. While I'd like to see the coaches actualy stick it out with both Bailey and Cullen.\n\nSheffield Shield\n\nDan Harris\n\nJames Smith / Tom Cooper\n\nMichael Klinger\n\nCallum Ferguson\n\nMark Cosgrove\n\nGraham Manou\n\nCullen Bailey\n\nMark Cleary\n\nJake Haberfield\n\nDan Cullen\n\nPeter George\n\n12th. Dan Christian / Aaron O'Brien (more than likely to play ahead of one of the spinners, but I'd prefer to play both and Bailey is a fairly good batsman anyway)\n\nFord Ranger Cup\n\nTom Cooper\n\nMichael Klinger\n\nCameron Borgas\n\nCallum Ferguson\n\nMark Cosgrove\n\nDan Christian\n\nGraham Manou\n\nMark Cleary\n\nJake Haberfield\n\nShaun Tait\n\nDan Cullen\n\n12th. Aaron O'Brien\n\nThe Redbacks have more than enough talent to push for the finals in both forms of the game this season. The key will be whether South Australia can finally start a season in good form, rather than find form in the second half and just miss the finals again.\n\nThat's easier said than done. He could well line up at the start of the season, but considering the depth in quick bowlers the Redbacks have, he is going to have to perform very strongly to stay in the team.\n\nDuval should be behind Cleary, George, Haberfield, Tait and even Christian as a bowling all-rounder in my opinion. While I'm a big fan of Gary Putland too. So I think we'll see Duval early, but he could go the way of Allan Wise.\n\nHaving said that if he performs strongly first up, he could play a bigger role. His best chance will be to take Cleary's spot in the one day team, and that might not be the worst outcome. Just as long as he doesn't stop George and Haberfield from playing.\n\nDisappointed for Jake Brown and Jason Donnelly. Their work ethic is pretty good and Brown probably wasn't given a crack in the desired format ie OD's and T20's, while Donnelly could have been in contention for the longer format. That being said, it was a difficult side to break into with the only available spots really being for the quicks as SA don't want to play any other spinners besides Cullen and Bailey while they have the part time spin of O'Brien.\n\nTrent Kelly has returned to South Australia after spending some time with Western Australia. He hasn't got a contract with the Redbacks, but is looking to force his way into the team. And is apparently going to be trying to get in on as much pre-season training with the Redbacks as possible.\n\nNot really sure if the Redbacks need another fringe fast bowler, and I wouldn't be expecting to see him in the team at any stage. But it's always good to have options.\n\nWas a good junior but hasn't really improved a lot. A quick but one-trick sort of bowler, needs to add another string to his bow to play first class cricket regularly.\n\nRedbacks should throw the ball to George and Putland as much as possible this season, they are the future of our pace stocks. Glad Duval is back, rate him fairly highly so hopefully he can get some wickets for us.\n\nDisappointed to see Brown and Delmont cut, wrong move there I think, both have a lot of talent and a lot to offer.\n\nI agree it's disappointing to see Brown and Delmont getting cut, especially Delmont in my opinion. But a good season in club cricket, and they'd be around the mark again.\n\nIt's going to be interesting to see how they play Cosgrove this season. He is currently playing for Glamorgan over in England, and is averaging over 70 with the bat. But he is playing as an opener. Opening in limited overs cricket was always where he seemed most comfortable, the selectors just never wanted him playing there though.\n\nThe only problem is that the middle order would look quite thin without Cosgrove (no pun intended ). But it would be a good chance for a young player to make his mark.\n\nMendis signs with Redbacks\n\nIt really is a huge signing for the Redbacks. Mendis is without a doubt, the best spinner in the World. I wouldn't be surprised to see him lead the Redbacks to the final.\n\nWhile this could be an excellent opportunity for Dan Cullen to learn from the best, and hopefully become an even better bowler.\n\nWith still a few months to go until the start of the domestic competition, the Emerging Players Tournament has provided plenty of positives already for the Redbacks.\n\nPeter George - 3 matches, 6 wickets, average 13, economy 3.90\n\nChris Duval - 4 matches, 5 wickets, average 22, economy 4.07\n\nKane Richardson - 4 matches, 4 wickets, average 23, economy 5.32\n\nTom Cooper - 251 runs (tournament leader), average 83.66, strike rate 95\n\nWithout a doubt the best young players of any state in my opinion. Things are looking very promising for the Redbacks this season.\n\nWith still a few months to go until the start of the domestic competition, the Emerging Players Tournament has provided plenty of positives already for the Redbacks.\n\nPeter George - 3 matches, 6 wickets, average 13, economy 3.90\n\nChris Duval - 4 matches, 5 wickets, average 22, economy 4.07\n\nKane Richardson - 4 matches, 4 wickets, average 23, economy 5.32\n\nTom Cooper - 251 runs (tournament leader), average 83.66, strike rate 95\n\nWithout a doubt the best young players of any state in my opinion.

Hughes, Warner and Moises have all represented in Australia.\n\nGive SA two years and they may be at this level however not quite yet.\n\nNo doubt Hughes, Khawaja and Warner (in limited overs cricket) are very good prospects. And Henriques and Smith has shown glimpses of promise. Forrest and O'Keefe have been OK, and Hazlewood has only played the one game.\n\nI'd argue that Cooper would be behind just Hughes, as the best young batsman in the country. While George and Haberfield are two of the better young quicks, along with NSW's Cockley. And if you include Forrest, then I'll add Ferguson and Bailey. Throw in James Smith, and a very promising player in Cranmer, and the young players from SA are right up there with the best.\n\nNSW might be just ahead at this stage, but come the end of the season I have no doubt that SA will be ahead.\n\nI dunno about our juniors being the second best in the land? Look at Wade and Holland, Quiney is regarded pretty highly (however i dont see the hype) the other McKay, Blizzard has a good eye and a few good shots if he can mature he may become something of quality, however in SA, while George and Richardson look exciting, Richardson and Haberfield also worry me, Cullen/Bailey wont ever be any better than average State bowlers and While Cranmer looks good, It will be mighty haqrd for him to progress if he is one shinning light!\n\nI dunno about our juniors being the second best in the land?\n\nIt depends what age bracket you define 'young players' as being in. Lets say you go with being under 25....\n\nCallum Ferguson, Cullen Bailey, Tom Cooper, Peter George (20 wickets from 6 Sheffield Shield games), Jake Haberfield (10 wickets at 17 in FRC) and James Smith (averaging over 30 from 4 Sheffield Shield games) have all performed well in different forms of the game. While Putland and Richardson have both shown glimpses.\n\nSo of players under the age of 25, I would say we are at least second best.\n\nI guess I know what you mean but to say they are second best etc is really debatable. Up until the end of last year, whenever Ive thought of SA Ive seen them as a dumping ground or the end of the road for experienced cricketers, ie Flower, Elliot, Fleming etc. Picking up blokes like Aaron O'Brien probably didnt help that.\n\nHowever seeing young players like Smith, Cooper, Delmont, George etc get games was a good thing last year. I certainly wouldn't be getting too carried away yet as I suspect the SA attack may still look something along the lines of Tait, Rofe and Cleary if all are fit.\n\nNSW are streets ahead in terms of their younger players, QLD are starting to follow and WA started this 2 years ago but have stopped. Vic have hardly ever promoted from within but it hasn't seemed to hurt them. This year they lost two of their brightest young stars (Davies & Ludeman) to SA as they simply wont play their kids.\n\nAnyway, SA are on the right track and no doubt will see the benefits soon enough."
