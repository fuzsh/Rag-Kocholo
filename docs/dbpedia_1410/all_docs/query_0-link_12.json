        "text": "For the first time since the triumphant departure of Justin Langer in early 2007 the top order of Australia appears to have the stability and depth required to ensure a plethora of solid foundations for seasons to come.\n\nThe unorthodox Katich and Hughes’ immediate success, emphasized by their twin tons on the first day at Kingsmead, will ensure that they have the selector’s favour for the time being. However, with Phil Jaques returning from injury, Chris Rogers continuing to score important runs and Michael Klinger fulfilling his potential, there will be no shortage of alternatives if either of Australia’s new dynamic duo begin to fail regularly.\n\nRemarkably, it is the middle order that may need renewing sooner than anticipated. Michael Clarke’s chronic back complaint and Michael Hussey’s form are a concern but rest assured the tough and ever faithful Australian system has a band of ready replacements chomping at the bit for an opportunity to test their skills against the world’s best.\n\nThe most illustrious middle-order replacement would have to be Brad Hodge who continues to dominate the Sheffield Shield with ridiculous ease. Unfortunately, Hodge is an abrasive character and apparently not welcome in Ricky Ponting’s dressing-room and that is a shame for he is a batsman of enormous talent who in his abbreviated Test career averages over 55. Plenty have questioned his technique but 50 first class tons including a magnificent double century against a quality attack deserve the utmost respect.\n\nEven with Hodge’s minimal chances of selection Australia’s middle-order reserves are still plentiful as evidenced by Marcus North’s wonderfully composed start to his international career. His ton in the Johannesburg Test was potentially match-winning yet his short innings in the last session yesterday was just as important as he quietly steered the team to safety after appearing shaky due to Ponting and then Clarke falling cheaply.\n\nOn the domestic front, Tasmania’s vice-captain George Bailey continues to impress especially when his State is in trouble. Several times this season the 26 year old has pulled Tasmania out of a deep hole and his outstanding rearguard century in Adelaide yesterday could conceivably allow Tasmania a shot at the Shield in Melbourne next weekend.\n\nNamed after his great-great-grandfather George Herbert Bailey who played in the unofficial Test against WG Grace’s MCC at Lord’s on the Australian 1878 tour of England, George the younger has been marked for a BaggyGreen since he was a babe and there is little doubt that if he continues his form and improvement he will get the honour of an official cap that was denied his legendary Tasmanian ancestor by the cruel spirited administrators of the time.\n\nAt 24, Callum Ferguson is another young batsman with the required technique and temperament to shine on the international stage and his introduction to the pyjama teams proved an instant success as his average of 102 at a strike rate of 136 suggest. Originally chosen as a leg-spinner in junior representative teams he has forgone that art and worked hard on his batting and it has proven a profitable decision. He continues to improve and hopefully his exposure to the world’s best bowlers in the next 18 months in limited overs cricket will give him the foundation required to become a Test batsman of note in the ensuing years.\n\nAnother player with a rich pedigree that is applying pressure to Australia’s middle order is Western Australian Shaun Marsh. Although he is still to dominate in the Shield, he has shown during his intermittent stints with the ODI team that he has the class to succeed internationally and that’s hardly unexpected when you consider he was facing Shane Warne in the backyard at age seven.\n\nShane Watson has returned to cricket this weekend as a batsman and of all the players mentioned he is the most likely to get the nod if a place opens up in the middle-order. He has returned with a bang, scoring an aggressive 145 in Queensland’s current match and hopefully he, his captains and the selectors will allow him to just bat and field at first slip. Too many times has the extra duty as a bowler interrupted his fitness and it’s time that all parties concerned recognize his value with the willow and allow him to concentrate solely on the most superior part of his game.\n\nI’ve heard whispers that he will be selected in Australia’s squad for Dubai to limit his IPL exposure and while that may not please Shane Warne it appears a wise decision going forward for Australian cricket.\n\nThere is one other player on the horizon but at 22 he is still a few years away from a BaggyGreen. Sydneysider, Usman Khawaja has impressed everyone with his mature approach to his initial First-Class season and it is no secret that the selectors have him marked as a player with a long international career in front of him. The competition will be stiff but the young lad from my former Grade club has the game, upbringing and attitude to fulfil the expectations placed upon him.\n\nIf Australia can win the current Test in Durban it is likely that the suffering Michael Clarke will be rested for the next at Cape Town and it will be interesting indeed to see who the selectors opt to call up and fly over for the job. Shane Watson is the obvious candidate but for Tasmania’s hopes of a second Sheffield Shield, I’m hoping Brad Hodge gets the recognition he thoroughly deserves.\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated\n\nLost 4 of the last 16? It really annoys me when the facts get in the way of a good story. I would have thought England was easier to beat, given the overall trials and tribulations they go through. I suspect the devil is in the detail, which ones did they win and lose, did they win the ones that count, did SA or WI have historic wins in England recently? (The answer to the last one is yes).\n\nAustralia hasn’t had an aggressive batting line-up, if that implies one team, its had a succession of aggressive lineups, in other words a culture and an ongoing stream of talent to execute it.\n\nI still think there is something especially fragile about the English team and mentality. I think it ties back in to the national culture, cynicism, grey weather, cautious temperament, end of empire etc. It’s why KP is so alien, and probably why he was sacked. Without wanting to be too fatalistic, it was probably inevitable the 2005 Ashes lead immediately to glorious failure, culminating in 5-0.\n\nAnyway, enough cod philosophy. I accept England are pretty good as a middling team. That’s as much as I’ll give them. After the SA wins in Australia it seemed Aus and Eng were converging. After the last 4 test matches in WI and SA, that’s been exposed as way too pessimistic.\n\nPS. I don’t blame them for losing post-Mumbai, Sewag was an irrisistable force."
