        "text": "Australian great Mel Jones and BBL10 champion Stephen O’Keefe have been added to the Australian Cricketers’ Association Masters tour of Armidale and Inverell in regional New South Wales.\n\nJones will be joining for the whole tour, while O’Keefe will feature at the ‘Sporties’ function night in Armidale on Thursday 25 February.\n\nThe remainder of the Masters team has also been confirmed. In the squad of 14, eight have played for Australia while 11 have represented New South Wales at the highest level.\n\nThere will be an opportunity to meet the team and participate in an exclusive panel discussion during the Sporties night in Armidale. Hosted by Jones, the panel will include a number of the Masters on the tour.\n\nJones, whose roots stem from country Victoria, spoke of the impact regional Australia has had on the longstanding success of Australian cricket.\n\n“I see within both the Australian men's and women's teams, and even at our state levels, the contribution made by players who have come from regional Australia has been absolutely huge. I played with the likes of Lisa Keightley, Belinda Clark, Jo Gary, and saw the impact they had on our team. And then you look at the Aussie women's team at the moment, you have the likes of Georgia Wareham and Sophie Molineux, country Australia has just given us so many amazing players.\n\n“For me, the Masters tour is a chance to reconnect with community cricket. I think for so many of us, as players that played at state or Australian level, we don't get a chance to really be able to come back and connect with the majority of people that are playing the game. So, I think that's one of the big parts for me, is to be able to come back to community cricket.”\n\nThe full team includes:\n\nSarah Andrews\n\nMark Cosgrove\n\nScott Coyte\n\nRhiannon Dick\n\nMichelle Goszko\n\nWayne Holdsworth\n\nMel Jones\n\nJason Krejza\n\nJosh Lalor\n\nGreg Matthews\n\nJonathan Moss\n\nStephen O’Keefe\n\nJulia Price\n\nDaniel Smith\n\nMel Jones was a superstar on the field and is now one of the most most-recognisable media personalities off the field. Jones, a recipient of a Medal of the Order of Australia, is a dual World Cup and Ashes winning champion and played in an era which saw Australia dominate cricket internationally. The middle-order batter smashed 131 on her Test debut against England in 1998. Jones is a regular when it comes to getting involved in charity work and initiatives surrounding equality. She has commentated around the world, calling the Indian and Pakistan Premier Leagues and is an integral part of Fox Cricket’s commentary team.\n\nProlific off-spinner, Stephen O’Keefe played nine Test matches for Australia, retiring from first-class cricket last season with over 300 first-class wickets to his name. Still plying his trade in the BBL, the left-armer will joining the Masters tour fresh from winning his third BBL championship with the Sydney Sixers. The high-point of his career came in 2017, when he took match-figures of 12-70 in Australia’s famous Test victory against India in Pune. His figures of 6-35 in each innings were the best ever by a visiting spinner in a Test in India. O’Keefe captained New South Wales between 2011-2013 and has played seven T20I’s for Australia.\n\nFast bowler Sarah Andrews played 58 games for Australia, retiring at 28 as one of Australia’s premier fast bowlers. Andrews featured in multiple World Cup campaigns during her 10-year career at the top. On the domestic level, Andrews played 83 times for the New South Wales Breakers, finishing her career with a prolific average of 22.33.\n\nJonathon Moss was a highly successful allrounder, who was named Victoria’s player of the year for the 2002-03 season. Originally from New South Wales, Moss’ professional career spanned over 200 games for Victoria as well as Berkshire and Derbyshire in the Country Championship. Moss’ highest first-class score of 172* came as stand-in captain against Western Australia. Moss has represented Australia at the Maccabiah Games.\n\nWayne Holdsworth was an out-and-out fast bowler. He claimed the Sheffield Shield title on three occasions with New South Wales and was the leading wicket-taker during the 1992/93 season with 53 at 25.96. He was also a part of New South Wales’ three domestic one-day titles. Holdsworth played over a century of games for New South Wales taking 251 wickets.\n\nMichelle Goszko played for Australia over a 10-year international career. A World Cup winner in 1997, the hard-hitting batter also scored 204 runs on Test debut against England, equaling the world record at the time for the highest-ever individual Test score. Goszko played over 100 times for New South Wales, winning multiple WNCL crowns.\n\nWicketkeeper Daniel Smith had a successful 10-year career domestically for New South Wales, and for the Sydney Thunder and Sixers in the Big Bash League. Often deputising to Brad Haddin, Smith flourished in the 50-over format, top scoring with 179, finishing his career at an average of 32.72. He was also a part of the New South Wales side that won the inaugural Champions League in India in 2009.\n\nTalent off-spinner, Rhiannon Dick, represented both New South Wales and the ACT Meteors as well as the Sydney Sixers and Adelaide Strikers in the WBBL. Her career highpoint came when she finished with figures of 6-14 for ACT against New South Wales in the domestic T20 semi-final. In 2015, she was selected to represent an Australian XI against New Zealand in two T20 games."
