        "text": "Aaron Christopher Bird is an Australian cricketer who currently plays first-class cricket for the New South Wales Blues. He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. Bird arrived from Taree, NSW as a 16-year-old to play Sydney Grade Cricket with North Sydney Cricket Club, eventually going on to play First Grade as an 18-year-old. In this time with North Sydney, Bird hit the headlines when he hit former Test batsman Michael Slater injuring the former test star in the process. Bird now plays his cricket with Bankstown Cricket Club, former home of the Waugh brothers. Bird caused controversy after appearing in a Twenty20 match, in which players wore nicknames on their shirts, with the moniker 'Flu' – a reference to bird flu. He was ordered not to wear the name again, as it upset the sponsors of the tournament, KFC. In December 2006 Bird was reported for a suspect bowling action but was later cleared by Cricket Australia. In January 2009, his bowling action was again reported. After undergoing analysis at the Australian Institute of Sport biomechanics laboratory in Canberra it was found that for some deliveries his elbow extension exceeded the 15-degree limit, he was subsequently banned by Cricket Australia.\n\nAaron James Finch (born 17 November 1986) is an Australian international cricketer who captains the Australian cricket team in limited overs cricket. Finch currently holds the record for two of the three highest individual scores in Twenty20 Internationals, with his score of 172 against Zimbabwe in July 2018 beating his previous record of 156 against England in 2013. In July 2018, he became the first player in T20Is to reach the 900 rating mark on the official T20I rankings. He made his Test debut for Australia in October 2018. He plays for Victoria, Surrey, Kings XI Punjab and the Melbourne Renegades as captain in domestic level. Finch is a top order batsman, and occasional left arm orthodox spinner. He is the fastest Australian to reach 10 ODI centuries. He scored his maiden first-class double century on 29 October 2015 while batting for Cricket Australia XI against New Zealand in a tour match.\n\nAdam Craig Dale (born 30 December 1968) is a former Australian cricketer who played in two Tests and 30 ODIs from 1997 to 2000. He played in first-class and List A cricket for Queensland Bulls and in club cricket for North Melbourne Cricket Club, Heidelberg Cricket Club, Northcote Cricket Club, Old Paradians Cricket Club and Research Cricket Club. From a short, ambling run-up, Dale delivered medium-paced outswingers with nagging accuracy. He therefore become known more as an economical bowler in one-day cricket, although he was selected for two Tests throughout his career and was very successful for Queensland in the first-class arena. He is best remembered however for taking one of the greatest catches ever seen in the game of cricket whilst playing for Queensland in the summer of 1997/98. He played grade cricket for the Wynnum-Manly Cricket Club in Brisbane, and premier cricket for Northcote, Heidelberg Cricket Club, North Melbourne and Melbourne in Melbourne, over a long career which spanned twenty-six years from 1985/86 to 2010/11.\n\nAdam Craig Gilchrist (; born 14 November 1971) is an Australian cricket commentator and former international cricketer and captain of the Australia national cricket team. He was an attacking left-handed batsman and record-breaking wicket-keeper, who redefined the role for the Australia national team through his aggressive batting. Widely regarded as the greatest wicket-keeper–batsman in the history of the game, Gilchrist held the world record for the most dismissals by a wicket-keeper in One Day International (ODI) cricket until it was surpassed by Kumar Sangakkara in 2015 and the most by an Australian in Test cricket. His strike rate is amongst the highest in the history of both ODI and Test cricket; his century against England at Perth in December 2006 is the fourth-fastest century in all Test cricket. He was the first player to have hit 100 sixes in Test cricket. His 17 Test centuries are the most by a wicket-keeper and his 16 in ODIs second only to Sangakkara. He holds the unique record of scoring at least 50 runs in successive World Cup finals (in 1999, 2003 and 2007). His 149 off 104 balls against Sri Lanka in the 2007 World Cup final is rated one of the greatest World Cup innings of all time. He is one of the only three players to have won three World Cup titles.Gilchrist was renowned for walking when he considered himself to be out, sometimes contrary to the decision of the umpire. He made his first-class debut in 1992, his first One-Day International appearance in 1996 in India and his Test debut in 1999. During his career, he played for Australia in 96 Test matches and over 270 One-day internationals. He was Australia's regular vice-captain in both forms of the game, captaining the team when regular captains Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting were unavailable. He retired from international cricket in March 2008, though he continued to play domestic tournaments until 2013."
