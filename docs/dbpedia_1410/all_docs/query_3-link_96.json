        "text": "Tasmania insist there is more to their batting than Ben McDermott.\n\nTasmanian skipper George Bailey couldn't be happier with Ben McDermott's form, but warns his side don't need another big score from the red-hot opener to win the one-day final against Victoria.\n\nSubscribe now for unlimited access .\n\nor signup to continue reading\n\nAll articles from our website\n\nThe digital version of Today's Paper\n\nBreaking news alerts direct to your inbox\n\nAll articles from the other in your area\n\nMcDermott has scored the third-most runs (393) in the tournament, with two fifties and two centuries in six innings at an average of 78.60.\n\nHe was dismissed for his lowest score of the competition (14) in the semi-final against Queensland but the Tigers still cruised to a six-wicket win.\n\n\"I don't think we've had to rely on any one player with bat or ball, which has been something that's really pleasing,\" Bailey said on Tuesday.\n\n\"On the back of that everyone in the 11 has had a really great game and helped us win at some stage.\n\n\"So we go into the final not feeling like we need someone to go off for us. We just need everyone to play their role.\"\n\nTasmania will be aiming to lift their first one-day cup trophy since the 2009-10 season when they face Victoria in Wednesday's final at Junction Oval.\n\nAnd while Bailey is confident they aren't over-reliant on McDermott's hot bat, the talented 23-year-old still figures to be a key factor as he continues to reap the dividends of a demanding off-season.\n\n\"I'm really thrilled for him, he sets a great example for the younger players in our squad,\" Bailey said.\n\n\"He went away in the off-season to England by himself and worked really hard over there.\n\n\"He lost about eight kilos, transformed his diet, and just came back with a really clear determination to improve his game and his cricket has gone to another level on the back of that.\n\n\"It's great reward for him and I think he's someone who's only going to get better and better ... I think he's someone who can play all formats for Australia, which is fantastic.\"\n\nAustralian Associated Press\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAd\n\nGet the latest Mt Isa news in your inbox\n\nSign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.\n\nEmail address\n\nWe care about the protection of your data.
