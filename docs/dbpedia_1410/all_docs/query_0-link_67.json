        "text": "The battle between India and Australia has undoubtedly turned out to be the most fascinating one in modern day Test cricket. Ever since Sourav Ganguly’s Indian team stopped Steve Waugh’s all-conquering Australian team in 2001, the rivalry between the two teams and the players have gone up several notches.\n\nAustralian off spinner Nathan Lyon, who has played a big part in the Test matches over the last decade, has put this rivalry next to the traditional Ashes. While speaking to reporters Lyon said that the Aussies were outplayed by the Indians on the last tour and they are waiting to get the record straight when India comes calling later this year.\n\n“You never like losing series or games of cricket for Australia,” Lyon was quoted as telling reporters by sportingnews.com\n\n“India a couple of years ago, they outplayed us.\n\n“But we’re looking forward to having those guys come here, it’s getting up there to the pinnacle series alongside the Ashes.\n\n“They’ve got a side full of superstars and it’s going to be an amazing challenge this Australian summer when they get out here,” he said.\n\nLyon is the most successful Australian bowler against India in Tests and that too by miles. He has 85 wickets to his name in 18 Tests against the Indians at an average of 32.60.\n\nTalking about how he has been practising in the lockdown, Lyon said, “I haven’t had a pre-season, this is basically my first winter in ten years.”\n\n“It’s exciting to be home and just to be around all the boys here and all the rookies as well trying to pass on a little bit of knowledge.\n\n“Have I started bowling? I’ve been doing a bit of bowling-coaching with young Ben Manenti from the Sydney Sixers, so I’ve been bowling with him a fair bit over the last three to four weeks.\n\n“I have started, it’s not everyday stuff but it’s coming along well though,” he added.\n\nAustralia are set to play their next Test match against Afghanistan in November before locking horns with India\n\nhttps://www.hindustantimes.com/cric...es-to-ashes/story-TDPzlu6Mv1YzXe9FeeOShJ.html\n\n\"Would Be Ideal To Go With Large Contingent\" On Australia Tour: MSK Prasad\n\nA mandatory 14-day quarantine period in Adelaide before the start of India's marquee Test series against Australia might prompt the BCCI to send a jumbo squad much like the West Indies and Pakistan in England, feels former chairman of selectors MSK Prasad. According to Prasad, it might be a good idea to have at least a 26-strong squad for the tour Down Under where both India and the 'A' team could be clubbed together for a month.\n\nPakistan are travelling with a squad of 29 (including white-ball specialists) while the West Indies have 26 on their roster in order to maintain the COVID-19 protocols in England.\n\n\"The team management and seniors will have an opportunity to look at the youngsters who are knocking the doors,\" Prasad, who till February was selection committee head, told PTI during an interaction.\n\n\"In this process, you can also monitor those players who can be the potential guys for different spots in future,\" Prasad said.\n\nA squad of 26 will ensure that India can be divided into two groups and a warm-up game could be played during the quarantine period.\n\n\"Since we cannot trust the net bowlers about their exposure to COVID, it would be ideal to go with a large contingent as we can be assured of all the players' safety as they will be in a bio-secure environment,\" Prasad reasoned.\n\n\"In case someone tests COVID positive, then the players from this contingent can be picked as they would have served the mandatory quarantine period,\" he added.\n\nPrasad opined that it will be a healthy preparation for the main team as the first-choice batsmen will have a wide variety of bowlers at their disposal.\n\n\"Even for our main bowlers, they will have fresh batsmen to bowl at unlike the same bunch of first team boys. For instance, Shreyas Iyer is very aggressive and at times can be unorthodox. So, he might offer variety of skills which the Australian batsman might posses.\n\n\"On the other hand, a left-armer Khaleel Ahmed's presence will help in preparing for Mitchell Starc's angled deliveries,\" said Prasad.\n\nA good bunch of reserve fast bowlers would be ideal as the first team bowlers like Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma and Umesh Yadav won't get tired in the nets in the absence of net bowlers.\n\nThe other reason to carry a big squad is that Sunil Joshi's panel will not have a reference frame as there would be no domestic cricket before the start of Ranji Trophy.\n\nIf there is no domestic cricket happening then taking a large group of players will help the final squad in terms of quality preparation leading up to the Test series, reckons Prasad.\n\n\"Also, if IPL is going to happen prior to this series then carrying a large contingent is better as we need to be ready with back ups in case somebody gets injured or is carrying the niggles from the IPL.\"\n\nBut there are a few disadvantages also and Prasad cited a couple of them.\n\n\"The only tough part that we will be facing because of this large contingent is managing such a large pool of players. To provide quality practise sessions to all of them will also be a challenge,\" said Prasad.\n\nThe other reason is that save for Cheteshwar Pujara and Hanuma Vihari (the two unsold Test players in IPL), others will have to switch from T20 to Test mode.\n\n\"If IPL is going to happen prior to this series then majority of these players would have played in it and then carrying extra players might become a debatable issue.\n\n\"But let's not forget that IPL is only a T20 tournament which may not be ideal preparation for Test series,\" said Prasad.\n\nAsked to put on the selector's hat one more time, the former India wicketkeeper picked up his choice of 26 players -- a mix and match of Test, ODI and T20 specialists.\n\nHis Choices:\n\nOpeners: Rohit Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Prithvi Shaw, KL Rahul.\n\nMiddle-order: Virat Kohli (captain), Ajinkya Rahane, Cheteshwar Pujara, Hanuma Vihari, Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer.\n\nWicketkeeper: Rishabh Pant, Wriddhiman Saha.\n\nSpinners:Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Shahbaz Nadeem, Rahul Chahar, Kuldeep Yadav.\n\nAll-rounder: Hardik Pandya.\n\nhttps://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/msk...on-australia-tour-2268288?pfrom=cricketwidget\n\nCricket Australia appoints Nick Hockley as CEO\n\nThe board of Cricket Australia confirms the appointment of Nick Hockley to the position of Chief Executive Officer.\n\nHockley has served with distinction as CA’s Interim CEO since June 2020, overseeing the successful delivery of last season’s international and domestic competitions in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHockley has spent almost a decade in cricket with highly successful stints as the CEO of the ICC T20 World Cup 2020 Local Organising Committee, Head of Commercial Projects at CA and as General Manager, Commercial and Marketing, at the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015.\n\nPrior to cricket, Hockley was Head of Commercial Negotiations for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games prior to which he held senior corporate finance roles at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Sydney and London, where he also qualified as a Chartered Accountant.\n\nHockley said he was honoured to be announced as CA’s new CEO.\n\n“As Australia’s national sport, cricket is at the heart of our national and cultural identity. I am under no illusion about the importance of cricket to the lives of so many Australians, nor the magnitude and responsibility of this role. Leading Cricket Australia is the greatest privilege of my working life and I am committed to doing all I can to making a positive contribution to the game and the community,” Hockley said.\n\n“Over the past 12 months, I have learnt first-hand about the breadth, scale and importance of the role. My approach has been and will continue to be to bring people across the game together, as I believe this is fundamental to achieving our full potential.\n\n“It has been extremely rewarding to be part of CA, State and Territory Associations and the Australian Cricketers’ Association working together like never before over the past 12 months, to overcome the challenges presented by Covid-19 and deliver a summer for the ages. I look forward to building on this momentum and playing my role in deepening those relationships further, as well as playing a leading role in growing the game internationally alongside fellow ICC members.\n\n“From community cricket to the international arena, Australian Cricket is in excellent shape, due to the hard work and dedication of thousands of volunteers, coaches, players, match officials and employees across the country, all of whom are an inspiration to me.\n\n“I am extremely grateful for the support and trust of our partners and the millions of fans in Australia and around the world who cheer on our teams. We are committed to being an organisation which you can be proud of and a sport where everyone belongs.\n\n“I would also like to thank the CA board for the faith they have placed in me to continue to lead CA at this important and exciting time for the sport. The change and complexity brought about by Covid-19 has created lots of challenges, but also plenty of opportunities. By working together with our partners across the game, I feel confident and optimistic about cricket’s ability to rise to the challenges of the modern world and thrive.”\n\nEarl Eddings, CA Chair, congratulated Hockley on his appointment.\n\n“Nick’s contribution to Australian Cricket has been immense and, on behalf of the board, I am most pleased to confirm his appointment as CEO, which was unanimously endorsed by the board,” Eddings said.\n\n“From delivering the historic T20 Women’s World Cup to ensuring a safe and successful 2020-21 season, Nick has already proven himself to be in the very top echelon of sports administrators both in Australia and around the world.\n\n“Nick was named Interim CEO at an incredibly challenging period for Australian sport, and society in general, and there were many instances where the once-in-a-generation obstacles in his path must have seemed overwhelming. But through his leadership, resolve, worth ethic and vision for the game, Australian Cricket emerged stronger than ever. For that, Nick deserves enormous credit.\n\n“In addition to his excellent record of strategy and delivery, Nick has been pivotal in galvanising Australian Cricket and strengthening relationships with our partners. I have no doubt those bonds will deepen further under his stewardship, which will serve to grow the game at all levels.\n\n“Only 14 people have served as CEO or secretary of Australia’s national cricket body, and just 12 since the then-Australian Board of Control for International Cricket was formally established 116 years ago. I firmly believe Nick will be regarded among the very best of them and carry on their legacy of ensuring cricket is a sport for all Australians.\n\n“The role of CEO of CA is one of the most highly regarded in sport and, accordingly, we were fortunate to have many outstanding candidates apply for the post. The board and I thank every one of them and wish them well in their future endeavours.”\n\nCricket Australia has rewarded Nick Hockley for his strong performance during the COVID-19 pandemic by appointing him as full-time chief executive.\n\nRushed in as interim CEO almost a year ago to replace the deposed Kevin Roberts, Hockley preserved CA’s financial viability by ensuring the full Indian tour and men’s and women’s Big Bash took place despite the obstacles posed by lockdowns and travel restrictions.\n\nHis performance made a mockery of the CA board’s panicked response to the pandemic, when it cut hard and early, standing down its workforce on Jobkeeper for 10 weeks and green-lighting most states to slash community cricket programs.\n\nHockley will have little time to bathe in the glory of his achievements. There are major issues on the horizon, starting with the players’ memorandum of understanding due to be signed off after next season.\n\nThis will be followed by broadcast rights negotiations with Fox Sports and a disgruntled Channel 7, who unsuccessfully attempted to bully CA into a COVID-induced pay cut despite ending up with a full schedule of content.\n\nThe last MOU negotiation, in 2017, sparked an ugly war between the CA and the players, who ended up being uncontracted for a period.\n\nBoth Hockley and the recently appointed Australian Cricketers’ Association CEO Todd Greenberg have made encouraging noises about the next round of negotiations. Hockley said CA had worked “closer than ever” with the ACA over the past few months.\n\n“We’ve already started talking about what’s important to the playing group and what’s important to the game,” Hockley said. “Those discussions will continue over the coming months.”\n\nGreenberg praised Hockley for his co-operation.\n\n“Over the past 12 months, Nick has overseen a re-invigoration of the relationship between cricket’s governing body and the ACA,” Greenberg said.\n\n“This relationship – one that is a genuine partnership – proved invaluable in delivering a full summer of cricket under difficult circumstances, maintaining not only the financial health of the game, but its vital place at the heart of an Australian summer.”\n\nAn Englishman, Hockley has a strong pedigree in sports administration, including key roles with the 2012 Olympics in London and 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nMost recently, he headed the International Cricket Council’s Twenty20 World Cup in Australia.\n\nThe Women’s T20 World Cup in March 2020 was a triumph, with more than 86,000 watching Australia beat India in the final at the MCG. However, the men’s event, scheduled for October, was postponed until next year because of the pandemic.\n\nHockley beat a shortlist of candidates including former NRL and Football Australia CEO David Gallop.\n\n“Over the past 12 months, I have learnt first-hand about the breadth, scale and importance of the role,” he said. “My approach has been and will continue to be to bring people across the game together, as I believe this is fundamental to achieving our full potential.\n\n“The change and complexity brought about by COVID-19 has created lots of challenges, but also plenty of opportunities. By working together with our partners across the game, I feel confident and optimistic about cricket’s ability to rise to the challenges of the modern world and thrive.”\n\nhttps://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricke...ces-immediate-challenges-20210531-p57wtj.html\n\nThe Cricket Australia Board has endorsed the appointment of former Australian captain George Bailey as Chair of the National Selection Panel (NSP) to replace the retiring Trevor Hohns.\n\nBen Oliver, Cricket Australia’s Executive General Manager, High Performance and National Teams, said the search had begun for a third panel member to join Bailey and head coach Justin Langer.\n\n“George is a highly respected leader who is now well established on the NSP alongside Justin as the head coach,” Oliver said.\n\n“He has brought recent playing experience with a deep understanding of the game, an open and collaborative style and a desire to keep improving the selection function.\n\n“The third panel member will add to their combined experience as we look for someone who will bring complimentary skills along with their own perspective and diversity of thinking.”\n\nBailey said he was looking forward to the new role and an exciting period ahead for the Australian men’s side with the ICC T20 World Cup, a home Ashes and away tours to the subcontinent in the short term.\n\n“Firstly, I would like to thank Trevor for his incredible work which has helped shape the success of Australian cricket over a long period, including during my days as a player and captain,” Bailey said.\n\n“In what can be a challenging job Trevor has always been calm, consistent and approachable. Similarly to his journey, he has made my transition from player to selector as smooth as possible. There is a lot I will take from Trevor’s style and very much look forward to the journey ahead.”\n\nHohns stepped back from the role having played an integral part in some of the greatest successes in Australian cricket.\n\nHe first joined the selection panel in 1991 having retired from playing after the 1989 Ashes tour and he has since logged an impressive honour roll including World Cups, multiple Ashes wins in England and at home as well as historic away victories over India and Pakistan.\n\nHe has presided over the selection of many of Australia’s greatest teams including those from the dominant Allan Border and Mark Taylor eras to the world-record winning Ricky Ponting team which won 21 successive one-day internationals.\n\nHis first tenure included five straight Ashes series wins and a record 16 consecutive Test wins, as well as back-to-back World Cups in 1999 and 2003.\n\n“The game has been great to me and I have loved every minute of it, from the good times to the bad,” Hohns said. “I have been extremely fortunate to be involved with some of the greatest Australian teams of all time and many of the best players to have played the game.\n\n“The successes of the side over the years have been great but I remember my time just as much for the wonderful people you work with and those you meet along the way. It has been an amazing journey for me, but all things come to an end. I am happy with my decision.”\n\nOliver said Hohns had been one of the game’s most successful figures over the last three decades.\n\n“The impact Trevor has had on Australian cricket has been unparalleled over a long period of time,” Oliver said. “For someone to have played such an integral part in so many incredible eras is a feat few, if any, ever achieve.\n\n“The role of national selector is one of the most scrutinised in Australian sport and Trevor has performed it with great strength, judgement and humility. We will miss his experience but respect his decision to take a step back from the game and are grateful for his stewardship.”\n\nMore recently Hohns played an integral part in Australia’s away Ashes success in 2019 as the side began a rebuilding phase. In that time the side also rose to No.1 in the world in T20 International cricket.\n\nWith Earl Eddings set to be endorsed for a second term as chair of Cricket Australia – despite the objections of both Queensland and New South Wales cricket – it has emerged that the board changed its policy to encourage repeat terms for the position.\n\nEddings has the full support of his board, but his opposite number in England resigned on Thursday after serving just 12 months into his five-year term. ECB chair Ian Watmore had fallen foul of the counties and upset many with his call to cancel a tour of Pakistan.\n\nIn Australia time limits for directors had been pushed to the side and encouragement given to chairs staying for longer than their three-year term.\n\nA number of updates were made to Cricket Australia’s Governance Policy in recent years.\n\nExcerpts shown to The Weekend Australian include this amendment which apparently dates back to 2017: “in recognition of the complexity of the role of Chair of Cricket Australia it is the preference of the board that the chair holds the position for a minimum of two terms …”\n\nEddings is seeking to continue another term after 13 years on the board. Previously it was policy that a director sit for a maximum of nine years, but that too was changed.\n\n“ … the governance policy set out the maximum expected tenure of a board member is nine years however the nominations committee is entitled to override the tenure of nine years should the specific skills, knowledge, experience or capability of that board member need to be retained,” the update read.\n\nCricket Australia told The Weekend Australian that the change to the chair’s tenure was made during David Peever’s reign.\n\nPeever, whose first term was rocked by the crisis of the Memorandum of Understanding dispute with the players and the sandpaper debacle, began a second term on the same day the Longstaff culture review was released at the AGM in October 2019.\n\nThe former Rio Tinto chief was forced to stand down before the end of that month – as exclusively revealed in The Australian – when NSW chair John Knox rang him directly and relayed that he had lost the support of the largest state.\n\nEddings was Peever’s deputy and assumed the role on a temporary, and then permanent, basis but had to later change to an independent role because he lost the support of the Victorian board in mid 2019.\n\nKnox wrote to Eddings in November 2019 passing on “a concern our (the NSW) board has on the succession planning for your role as CA Chairman … we believe you and your board need to prepare appropriately for the transition to a new Chairman in November 2021 (or sooner if something meant that you could not continue in the role)”.\n\nEddings has argued that he has not had time to groom a successor because of the pandemic which hit in early 2020, but this argument is not accepted by the NSW or Queensland boards.\n\nAs a compromise he has agreed to identify a successor and stand down some time during the next three years.\n\nThe Australian revealed on Thursday that Cricket Australia’s directors have ignored the wishes of the two states and rejected a bid placed at last week’s meeting to have Eddings agree to go by the end of May 2022.\n\nThe culture review that followed the South African scandal in 2018 included a call for the board to publish minutes of meetings subject to issues of commercial and other confidentialities.\n\nThis was pushed back against by the CA board which said its key priority was “to communicate transparently” with states and territories but it would “consider publishing media releases on key outcomes from Board meetings”.\n\nWhile the board implemented a number of the 42 recommendations it has dragged the chain on some including the first which calls for the establishment of an Ethics Commission.\n\nAt the time it was indicated a commissioner would be appointed, but three years have passed with no sign of action.\n\nEnglish cricket, reeling from the cancellation of the Pakistan tour and following a shambolic meeting with counties over the structure of domestic cricket, found itself without a chair on Friday after Watmore stood down effective immediately.\n\nMike Atherton, whose columns appear in The Australian, wrote that while the chair had accepted responsibility for his failings the fallout should not end there.\n\n“It is to be hoped the appointment of the next chairman will be done with more rigour,” he wrote. “Little in Watmore’s recent career, as a civil servant, brief chief executive of the FA and non-executive director of the English Football League, suggested he was cut out for the rough and tumble of cricket politics.\n\n“Watmore’s going should occasion others on the board to question their role as well. Anyone with an ounce of cricketing sense, or an understanding of the world game, should have been able to see how disastrous the decision to cancel the Pakistan tour was going to be, but there is a real absence of cricketing knowledge and expertise among the non-executives. It always seemed likely to me that there would be some serious fallout from cancelling the Pakistan tour. Ultimately, Watmore had to be accountable for the mess.\n\nEarl Eddings resigns as Cricket Australia Chair, new Chair appointed for AGM\n\nEarl Eddings has today stepped down as Chair of Cricket Australia and will not stand for re-election as a director at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, ending a 13-year commitment to the organisation.\n\nMr Eddings said he believed the decision was in the best interests of cricket and would provide the opportunity to continue the ongoing Board renewal process.\n\nMr Eddings said he was proud of his contribution to the sport during his 13 years as a director of Cricket Australia and three-year term as Chair.\n\n“It has been an honour and a privilege to be able to serve the sport I love as a Cricket Australia director. In that time, and particularly during my time as Chair, we have navigated some of the sport’s greatest challenges, including rebuilding the trust and reputation of Australian cricket after the Newlands incident and, more recently, the enormous impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on domestic and international cricket,\" he said.\n\n“I am particularly proud of our collective efforts to overcome the challenges of COVID-19 to stage a hugely successful Indian tour last summer and ensure the Ashes can go ahead this summer. It has been terrific to be involved in the growth of the women’s game in recent years, from the success of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup and Women’s Big Bash League to the continued increase in girls taking up our sport. I have also been pleased to strengthen relations with the players through the Australian Cricketers’ Association (ACA).\n\n“It is my sincere hope that following my resignation the State and Territory associations can unite and work together in the best interests of cricket, allowing the focus to return to the sport ahead of the 2021-22 season.\n\n“I would like to extend my thanks to all of those who have worked hard to support the sport, and me personally, during my term as Chair – my fellow directors and the entire Cricket Australia team, the players and coaching staff, the Australian Cricketers’ Association, the State and Territory cricket associations, our commercial and international partners and every club member and volunteer who keeps the sport thriving in the community.\n\n“My passion for the game is undiminished and I look forward to cheering on our men and women, boys and girls on every stage – from the forthcoming Ashes Tests to weekend club cricket – over the coming summer and beyond.”\n\nCurrent director Richard Freudenstein has been elected Chair of Cricket Australia and will serve for a short period until a permanent Chair is elected. Mr Freudenstein will chair Thursday’s Cricket Australia AGM, at which the States will have the opportunity to vote on the re-election of two directors, Lachlan Henderson and Greg Rowell.\n\nThe Board has previously announced that a deputy chair and anointed successor to the chair would be named after the end of the 2021-22 season.\n\nFollowing Mr Eddings’ resignation, that process will now be accelerated, with the aim of appointing a permanent chair by the end of the year after a rigorous process involving input from the State and Territory members.\n\nCricket Australia announces annual results and Board appointments\n\nCricket Australia (CA) today announced its financial results for the full year ending 30 June 2021.\n\nIn the 2020-21 financial year, CA delivered a 6% increase in revenue to $414.7 million, reflecting the collective efforts of the cricket community to overcome the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic to keep playing, as well as the continued support of broadcast and commercial partners.\n\nDue to an ongoing program of efficiency initiatives that began in the previous financial year, CA delivered $54 million in savings, while additional COVID-related costs of $23 million were incurred on measures such as biosecurity to keep the game safe.\n\nAs a result, CA delivered a net deficit of $151k. Although this was an improvement on revised budgetary expectations, it represented a significant adverse variation from the four-year cycle projections in the long-range plan due to the impacts of COVID-19 on match revenues and costs.\n\nThe Australian men’s team was the first international touring team from any sport on our shores to travel overseas after the onset of COVID-19, playing two ODI and T20 International series in England. It is currently ranked Number 3 in the ICC Test team rankings.\n\nThe Australian Women’s Cricket team was victorious in its summer series against New Zealand and retained its Number 1 ranking in one-day international and T20 international cricket.\n\nThe Australia vs India Vodafone Test series captivated the world, with 28 of the 31 sessions of the Test series had average domestic viewership of more than one million, the most of any sport in Australia in 2020.\n\nKFC|10 BBL was the most watched on record, with a total audience of 44.82 million across the tournament.\n\nThe entire rebel WBBL|06 series was played in a hub in Sydney, with a record 36 out of 59 matches broadcast, and was the most watched female sport in Australia.\n\n858,465 fans still attended the cricket during summer, despite COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nMore than 170,000 games of community cricket were played in a COVID-safe environment, courtesy of the army of hard-working volunteers, while girls’ registrations in club cricket and Woolworths Cricket Blast increased 17.5%.\n\nToday’s Annual General Meeting voted in favour of the re-election of WA Cricket-nominated director Lachlan Henderson and Queensland Cricket-nominated director Greg Rowell.\n\nRichard Freudenstein, Cricket Australia Chair, who was elected on Wednesday following the resignation of Earl Eddings, said it is anticipated the Board will appoint a permanent Chair by the end of 2021.\n\nRichard Freudenstein, Cricket Australia Chair, said:\n\n“Everything that has been achieved in the past 12 months shows not only the resilience of our sport but also what can be done when we work together. This is a clear lesson we have all taken from the pandemic and will remain with us throughout this coming season,” he said.\n\n“The Board has commenced the process of identifying the next Chair and it is anticipated that we will be in a position to make an appointment before the end of the year.\n\n“I would like to acknowledge Earl Eddings’ enormous contribution to Cricket Australia, including the past three years as Chair. During his 13 years on the Board, Earl has been a passionate advocate for our game and in recent years, has guided cricket through some of its greatest challenges, including rebuilding the trust and reputation of the sport after Cape Town and working with the cricket community to overcome the enormous impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“We should all be proud of the way the sport rose to the challenges of COVID-19 to stage a hugely successful Indian tour last summer and ensure the Ashes can go ahead this summer. Earl’s role in that, in particular managing our international relationships has been critical. Additionally, under his stewardship, the women’s game has gone from strength to strength, particularly the Australian women’s team and the Weber WBBL.\n\n“I share Earl’s hope that with his resignation, the cricket community can unite and work together in the best interests of the sport, allowing the focus to return to the game ahead of the 2021-22 season.\n\n“Speaking on behalf of the Cricket Australia Board, I can assure our members that we have listened and will be making a renewed effort to engage more consistently and deeply with you throughout the coming summer and beyond.\n\n“In the past 12 months, we’ve all faced significant challenges and demonstrated the resilience and collaborative spirit that defines our sport. And here we are now, heading into an Ashes summer, and towards a World Cup – we have much to be proud of and a lot to look forward to.”\n\nNick Hockley, Cricket Australia CEO, said:\n\n“In 2020-21, in a world where everyone has faced so many challenges, the collective commitment, resolve and sacrifice from so many people has meant that we delivered an incredible cricket season that gave hope and joy to people all around Australia and around the cricketing world,” he said.\n\n“Thank you to all our players, match officials, employees, and their families; the teams that have visited Australia and those who have hosted us; each State and Territory Cricket Association; the Australian Cricketers’ Association; our governments partners and world-class venues; fans; and the thousands of players and volunteers who kept cricket going at community level.\n\n“In the past year, Australia’s truly national sport has provided something positive for all Australians in the face of challenge and uncertainty. It has united and entertained in equal measure. We look forward to building on the experience, teamwork and lessons learned to deliver another uplifting season in 2021-22.\n\n“Having already hosted a fantastic Commonwealth Bank Women’s International Series between India and Australia, we look forward to the Weber WBBL starting tonight, the KFC BBL, the Men’s Vodafone Ashes series, the Women’s Commonwealth Bank Ashes series, the Men’s Dettol ODI & T20I Series against New Zealand & Sri Lanka, the WNCL, Marsh Sheffield Shield, Marsh One-Day Cup and the ICC Women’s World Cup in New Zealand. It’s going to be another massive summer of cricket.\n\n“As we look forward beyond the pandemic, it’s never been more important that we work together across the game to make our sport more inclusive, diverse and sustainable.”\n\nCricket-Governance row continues to dog Australian board\n\nMELBOURNE (Reuters) -Australian cricket remains riven by governance feuds three years after “Sandpaper-gate”, with the country’s most powerful state demanding further change to the board a day after the resignation of chairman Earl Eddings.\n\nCricket New South Wales chairman John Knox took aim at Cricket Australia’s executive board, saying the member states were not given enough say in how the game is run, while criticising the chairman’s role and pay.\n\n“It is crucial that the shareholders and the board of Cricket Australia work closely together over the next few months to learn from the past and to put in place the necessary changes to ensure the success of our great game,” Knox said at CA’s annual general meeting on Thursday.\n\nEddings resigned on Wednesday after losing support of New South Wales and other states, rather than fail in his re-election bid at the AGM.\n\nDirector Richard Freudenstein was appointed CA chairman on an interim basis.\n\nA scathing review into the culture of Australian cricket in the wake of the Newlands ball-tampering scandal triggered upheaval in CA’s executive ranks.\n\nChairman David Peever resigned while director Mark Taylor and other top executives also vacated their roles, but their replacements have failed to keep a lid on growing discontent among members through a rocky period caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCA said revenue increased 6% to A$414.7 million ($306.38 million) in the 2020/21 financial year after India’s lucrative four-test tour went ahead.\n\nHowever, the board posted a A$151,000 deficit, calling it a “significant adverse variation” from its budgeting over a four-year cycle.\n\nTours by India and England for the Ashes generate the lion’s share of income for Australian cricket through each cycle.\n\nCA, which cut dozens of staff last year amid the fall-out from the pandemic, said it had saved A$54 million in “efficiencies” but had to spend A$23 million on additional COVID-related costs to keep the game safe.\n\nRevenue was hit by the cancellation of some international matches and caps on crowds.\n\nCA expects to name a replacement chairman in the short term but Knox said the board needed to rethink the role’s duties and pay, which local media have reported at A$250,000 ($185,000) per annum.\n\n“It is highly unusual in any business or sporting environment that the chair of any organisation would be paid at such a significant multiple to what other directors are paid,” said Knox.\n\nFreudenstein said the chairmanship was different to that in other sports and that the pay was justified due to the “international aspect” of the role.\n\n($1 = 1.3535 Australian dollars)\n\nhttp://www.pakpassion.net/ppforum/showthread.php?293644-Cricket-Australia-appoints-Nick-Hockley-as-CEO-Post-166/page3&highlight=hockley+appointed\n\nFormer Australian fast bowler and senior administrator Tony Dodemaide will join the men’s National Selection Panel (NSP) alongside Chair George Bailey and Head Coach Justin Langer.\n\nDodemaide played 10 Test matches and 24 ODIs for Australia as well as 93 Sheffield Shield games for Victoria before turning to administration as MCC Head of Cricket at Lord’s, CEO of Western Australian Cricket and then the long-term boss of Cricket Victoria.\n\nAs Cricket Victoria CEO he led the redevelopment of Victorian cricket’s home at Junction Oval, turning the historic facility and home of the St Kilda Cricket Club into a world class venue for playing, training and administering the game in the state.\n\nHe is currently General Manager of Hockey One, the new elite national competition for Australian hockey. He will step down from that position to join the NSP in mid-November prior to the home Vodafone Ashes series.\n\nBen Oliver, Cricket Australia’s Executive General Manager of High Performance and National Teams, welcomed Dodemaide’s return to Australian cricket.\n\n“Tony led a field of very strong candidates and we are thrilled to have him join the NSP at an important and exciting period for the Australian men’s team.\n\n“He is an ideal fit for the selector role at this time and brings skills and experience that will complement George and Justin while adding value to the team and high performance area more broadly.”\n\nDodemaide expressed excitement on his appointment.\n\n“This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to make a contribution not only in the immediate tournaments and series but also to help chart the medium to longer term course of the Australian men’s teams,” Dodemaide said.\n\n“I can’t wait to offer my experience in cricket as a player and in management to assist George (Bailey) and JL (Langer) but also the wider Australian cricket high performance network.\n\n“Throughout my cricket journey I have often been close to high performance and selection, so I feel well suited to and prepared for this role.”\n\nDodemaide said his time in hockey was valuable and would benefit his new role.\n\n“I very much enjoyed the opportunity to work in hockey, another great and respected Australian sport, after many years in the cricket system. To experience first-hand how other sports operate brings new perspective and learnings to the table.\n\n“Like any system, high performance sport, including list management and selection, is always evolving. I believe cricket can tap further into other sports and be a world leader in these areas.”\n\nDodemaide was part of one of Victoria’s most memorable eras as a player alongside team-mates including Merv Hughes and Dean Jones before he returned as CEO. He also played County Cricket for Sussex before his posts in administration and management.\n\nThe bowling all-rounder took 6-58 in his first Test match against New Zealand while scoring a half century on debut.\n\nA confidential phone call between a whistleblower and Cricket Australia’s ex-integrity chief discussing a then-player’s alleged cocaine use and sexual activities has been leaked, exposing serious security flaws in the organisation’s anti-corruption unit.\n\nThe recording, sent anonymously to The Sunday Age, is of a call by former Cricket Australia head of integrity Sean Carroll to a woman who describes herself as a high-class escort and provides information that a well-known cricketer should “back it up” or he will end up destroying his career.\n\nIn the phone call, the woman makes allegations about the player dancing naked on a balcony, openly using cocaine and cavorting with numerous women.\n\nIt is believed the phone call took place several years ago, and the allegations against the unnamed player could not be substantiated. But the existence of the recording years later and the ease at which such recordings can be accessed has led to sports corruption experts warning that there is a risk of players being blackmailed and whistleblowers being deterred from coming forward.\n\nIt is unclear how or when the recording was obtained from Cricket Australia. It was sent to The Sunday Age through an encrypted email service from an anonymous address. The player was not identified and The Sunday Age has established that the recording is genuine.\n\nThe source of the leak said they wanted to bring attention to what they described as the integrity unit’s “abuse of power” and the lack of security around the handling of information from whistleblowers. The person said they were a former Cricket Australia staffer who wanted to expose flaws in the integrity unit and asked for the matter to be made public.\n\n“There are no rules regarding storage of these recordings, who can listen to them, or how long they should be archived,” the source said.\n\n“There are no policies or procedures in place regarding access, integrity and confidentiality of this material.\n\n“I want to protect members of the public, players and staff from an abuse of power and ensure accountability – I think this behaviour has gone unchecked for far too long.”\n\nIn the recording, the woman who contacted Cricket Australia tells Mr Carroll she is surprised at the player’s behaviour given his public profile.\n\n“He needs to back it up a bit, back it up, like deadset seriously back it up because I’m probably doing him a favour if anything,” she says.\n\n“I wouldn’t want to be publicly letting everyone seeing me party and snorting lines.”\n\nThe woman tells Mr Carroll there is “probably” video or photos of the player engaging in the reported activities but declines to provide any vision to Cricket Australia.\n\nShe says the last time she saw it happen was in the lead-up to Christmas but does not say which year.\n\n“They party a lot these boys,” the woman says.\n\nCricket Australia was unaware of the leak until an inquiry by The Sunday Age. A spokesman said it had been reported to the Victoria Police Sporting Integrity Intelligence Unit, which was providing assistance.\n\n“Cricket Australia takes this matter extremely seriously, which is why we contacted Victoria Police,” the spokesman said.\n\n“We constantly review our systems, and our controls around sensitive information are continually being improved and aligned with best practice.\n\n“We take integrity matters extremely seriously and ensure appropriate action is taken.”\n\nA Victoria Police spokeswoman said police had met with Cricket Australia but was not investigating the matter.\n\nIt is the second major leak in two months involving players investigated by Cricket Australia’s integrity unit. In November, former Test captain Tim Paine resigned when his explicit texts sent to a co-worker in 2017 became public on the eve of the Ashes.\n\nMr Carroll, who investigated the Paine complaint when it was first reported to Cricket Australia, left the organisation in December last year to take up a role as Victorian Racing Integrity Commissioner. Cricket Australia’s investigation of the complaint found Paine had not breached its code of conduct.\n\nSport corruption researcher Adam Masters, a senior lecturer in criminology at Australian National University, said the recording of sensitive information made players vulnerable to blackmail and possible match-fixing.\n\n“The big risk with that sort of information, if it went to organised crime, is you’re looking at problems in places like the sub-continent where organised crime has historically been involved with sport gambling,” Dr Masters said.\n\n“Players are much more aware of approaches by gambling interests and organised crime [than they used to be]. However, something like drug taking and prostitution really opens that blackmail element up in a very broad kind of way.”\n\nIntegrity expert Catherine Ordway from the University of Canberra said sporting organisations needed to develop strong whistleblower protections.\n\nDr Ordway, along with Dr Masters and associate professor Kath Hall, co-authored a report on sport corruption that contributed to the creation of a new national body, Sport Integrity Australia, last year.\n\n“What we found over the last decade is that most major corruption scandals in the world have come through a whistleblowing process,” she said.\n\n“It’s really important that the whistleblowing processes are strong and protected and that people who are providing information through these frameworks have confidence and trust in the system.”\n\nA Cricket Australia spokesman said whistleblowers are encouraged to come forward knowing that the security of confidential information was regularly reviewed.\n\n“We are committed to ensuring cricket is a safe environment for all, and we have no tolerance for any behaviour that compromises the safety or wellbeing of anyone involved in cricket,” the spokesman said.\n\nhttps://www.theage.com.au/sport/cri...-sparks-security-warning-20211221-p59j9p.html\n\nThe Australian Cricket Hall of Fame Committee, together with Cricket Australia (CA) and the Australian Cricketers’ Association (ACA), is delighted to announce Raelee Thompson and Justin Langer as the 2022 inductees in the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame.\n\nThompson and Langer become the 58th and 59th inductees respectively, since the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame was established in 1996.\n\nA left-handed batter hailing from Scarborough Cricket Club in Perth’s north-west, Langer’s toughness and resilience as a cricketer was on display from the beginning of his Test career.\n\nA gritty 54 on debut at the Adelaide Oval in 1993 that saw him hit on the helmet by West Indian fast bowler Ian Bishop signalled a player who relished the challenge of international cricket.\n\nHe spent the first years of his career at No.3, including when famously partnering with Adam Gilchrist to chase down 369 to beat Pakistan in Hobart in 1999.\n\nLanger moved to the top of the order in 2001, where he shared in Australia’s most successful opening partnership in Test cricket with Matthew Hayden. The pair compiled 6,081 runs together from 122 Test innings at an average of 51.53, including 14 century stands.\n\nA career built on fighting above his weight, Langer amassed 7,696 runs with a Test average of 45.27.\n\nHe also played in eight One Day Internationals in a career spanning 18 years and played first-class cricket for Western Australia, Middlesex and Somerset, scoring 28,382 runs at an average of 50.23.\n\nFollowing successful stints as coach of WA and Perth Scorchers, Langer was appointed coach of the Australian men’s cricket team in May 2018, and led them to the Men’s ICC 2021 T20 World Cup title and retaining the Ashes in 2019 and 2021-2022.\n\nRaelee Thompson, hailing from Shepparton in Victoria’s north-east, is one of the pioneers of the women’s game.\n\nA fast bowler who played 16 Tests and 23 One Day Internationals for Australia between 1972 and 1985, she captained the team four times. Thompson is the oldest player – male or female – to take a maiden five-wicket haul in Test matches at 39 years and 175 days of age.\n\nHer final Test match in 1985, the fifth and deciding Test match of the 1984-85 Women’s Ashes series played in Bendigo, saw her lead the Australians to reclaim the Women’ Ashes trophy after a 30-year hiatus.\n\nThompson took 57 Test wickets at an average of 18.24 and 24 One-Day International wickets at 18.66.\n\nThompson also represented Victoria on 45 occasions before serving as a selector for many years. She has continued mentoring future generations of female cricketers at her home club, Essendon Maribyrnong Park Ladies Cricket Club and accepted Life Membership from Cricket Victoria in 2018.\n\nPeter King, Australian Cricket Hall of Fame Chairman, said:\n\n“It was wonderful recognition for any cricketer to be inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame and, on behalf of the committee, it is honour to be inducting two cricketers who sit in the upper echelon of Australian cricket.\n\n“Justin’s contribution to Australian cricket spans across four separate decades. First as a player, as part of one of the most successful teams that world cricket has ever seen. As a coach, he entered the role at a time of great need and leads the Australian Men’s Cricket Team with great distinction, a team which the Australian public is very proud of.\n\n“Raelee is similarly a deserved induction, given her outstanding contribution to the game at a time where there was little fanfare at the elite level. She is no doubt one of our great pioneering female cricketers and represented the Baggy Green with such distinction – she is a worthy recipient of this recognition.”\n\nTodd Greenberg, ACA CEO, said:\n\n“The Australian Cricketers’ Association is humbled to induct two very deserving figures of Australian cricket into the Hall of Fame.\n\n“Justin’s record as a player speaks for itself. His record as an opener underpinned one of the most successful eras of Australian cricket. And his influence on the game has extended beyond his playing career – firstly through his commitment to the betterment of Western Australian cricket which is almost unparalleled, right through to the national team set-up which has convincingly held the Ashes on the back of winning the T20 World Cup for the first time.\n\n“Raelee is an ambassador and ornament to the Women’s game and was part of a team of trailblazing women – including four games as captain – who can be credited for the success that the current-day Australian Women’s Cricket Team enjoys. Raelee’s commitment to the betterment of women’s cricket at all levels through mentoring and administration roles is inspiring.\n\n“To this day she remains a prominent figure in cricket, particularly at Essendon Maribyrnong Park Ladies Cricket Club where she is a Life Member. She is hugely deserving of her induction.”\n\nNick Hockley, Cricket Australia CEO, said:\n\n“Honouring inductees to the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame is an important and special moment for the sport. Justin and Raelee are extremely deserving inductees and it is wonderful to acknowledge and celebrate the immense achievements and contributions of these legends of our game.\n\n“Justin has had a tremendous impact on Australian cricket, both at the top of the order alongside Matthew Hayden, as a coach of Western Australia and more recently as Head Coach of the Australian men’s team.\n\n“Raelee has been a leader and champion of cricket as a sport for women and girls through an incredible period of evolution, both as a proud player and captain of her country and continuing that passion towards ensuring that the game continues to progress and flourish for future generations.”\n\nAbout the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame\n\nThe Australian Cricket Hall of Fame was first proposed by the Melbourne Cricket Club in 1995.\n\nWith the support of Cricket Australia and Cricket Victoria, the Hall of Fame was officially opened by the then Prime Minister of Australia, the Honourable John Howard MP in 1996.\n\nThe selection philosophy for the hall of fame focuses on the players’ status as sporting legends in addition to their outstanding statistical records.\n\nThe selection panel is made up of representatives from all levels of cricket. Chaired by the current MCC Cricket Chairman, three former players are joined by the respective CEOs of Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers’ Association, along with two representatives from the media.\n\nAll inductees must have been retired from international cricket for a minimum of five years to be eligible for selection.\n\nAn inaugural group of ten players were inducted in 1996, and a further 47 players have been welcomed since:\n\nHALL OF FAME INDUCTEES\n\nInducted 1996 - Fred Spofforth, John Blackham, Victor Trumper, Clarrie Grimmett, Bill Ponsford, Sir Donald Bradman, Bill

captain Mark Taylor\n\nFormer Test batsman and former MCC President Paul Sheahan\n\nAustralian Cricketers’ Association CEO Todd Greenberg\n\nCricket Australia CEO Nick Hockley\n\nMedia representatives Ben Horne and Greg Baum\n\nAllrounder Ashleigh Gardner and prolific fast bowler Mitchell Starc are maiden Belinda Clark and Allan Border medallists respectively, having been awarded the top honours in Australian cricket\n\nBoth are first-time recipients of their respective accolade as voted by their peers, umpires and the media across all forms and every game of international cricket over the past 12 months.\n\nGardner’s ultra-consistent season with both bat and ball was fittingly rewarded with the Belinda Clark Award.\n\nAcross 10 innings Gardner struck 281 runs at an average of 35.1 that included four half centuries and a top score of 73 not out in a memorable T20 win against New Zealand in Hamilton.\n\nA valuable asset in the field, Gardner’s off-spin broke through for nine wickets, two shy of Sophie Molineux’s year-leading 11.\n\nThe quintessential allrounder, Gardner finished the voting period inside Australia’s top three run scorers and top five wicket takers across all formats.\n\nGardner won her first Belinda Clark Award with 54 votes from Beth Mooney (47) and Alyssa Healy (39) who finished second and third respectively in the voting.\n\nStarc has enjoyed a sensational year of international cricket and captured a combined 43 wickets at an average of 24.4 across all formats, 12 clear of the nation’s next best.\n\nThe left-arm quick was crowned the Male ODI Player of the Year following dominant performances in the three-match series against the West Indies which included a haul of 5-48 in the opening game.\n\nOne of the best pink-ball bowlers in the game, Starc thrived in the Vodafone Ashes series and amassed 19 wickets at 25.36 with a best of 4-37 in the first innings of the Day-Night Test in Adelaide.\n\nStarc also scored 241 runs across all formats at an average 26.8 to sit inside Australia’s top 10 run scorers over the past 12 months.\n\nStarc (107 votes) outpolled T20 World Cup hero Mitchell Marsh (106) by a single vote to win the Allan Border Medal while batter Travis Head was third in the polling with 72 votes.\n\nFor the third consecutive year Healy claimed top honours as the Female One-Day International Player of the Year with 13 votes ahead of Rachael Haynes (10) and Megan Schutt (10).\n\nTop-order batter Mooney took out the Female T20 Player of the Year with 13 votes, ahead of Tahlia McGrath (10) and Gardner (6).\n\nSouth Australian batsman Head’s outstanding Vodafone Ashes Series secured him the Male Test Player of the Year.\n\nIt is the latest in a string of honours for Head this summer, who was crowned the Miller/Compton Medallist as Player of the Series in Australia’s victorious Ashes campaign.\n\nThe left-hander struck 357 runs at an average of 59.50 in the Ashes and, alongside Usman Khawaja, was the only player to register multiple centuries in the series.\n\nAllrounder Marsh (53 votes) capped a stellar year by being voted the Male T20 International Player of the Year ahead of Josh Hazlewood (29) and Ashton Agar (26).\n\nMarsh compiled 627 runs at 36.9 during the voting period and was instrumental in Australia’s first ever victorious T20 World Cup campaign, scoring an unbeaten 77 from 50 balls to be named Player of the Match in the final.\n\nElyse Villani and Darcie Brown took the prized Female Domestic Player of the Year and Betty Wilson Young Cricketer of the Year awards respectively.\n\nVillani scored four centuries and 1,050 runs in 21 games at an average of 61.8, while Brown’s 30 wickets across all competitions during the voting period reinforced her enormous potential.\n\nSouth Australian captain Head was also voted Male Domestic Player of the Year with 902 runs at 50.1 in all forms of the game, while Tim Ward was named the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year for his 506 runs at 46 throughout the year.\n\nACT Meteor Zoe Cooke was named Community Champion for her work to support, promote and advocate for the women’s game in the ACT through coaching and mentoring roles, particularly in the pathway system.\n\nIn addition to the volunteer roles she plays within community cricket, Zoe also puts her hand up for several other charitable causes such as the Grizzly Bear Adoption Program for the World Wildlife Foundation, One Foot Forward challenge for Black Dog Institute and Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\n\nThe awards for international cricket are based on votes from players, umpires and the media on a 3-2-1 basis from each match.\n\nFor the domestic awards, the votes are collected from all players.\n\nTo be eligible for the Young Cricketer of the Year awards, players must be 24 years or less prior to the commencement of the award period and have not won the award previously.\n\nPrior to the award period, male players must have played 10 or

Australia (CA).\n\nDr Henderson, who will commence immediately, signalled his first priorities would be ensuring a strong, sustainable financial future for cricket, increased participation, particularly among girls and women, improved consultation with state and territory chairs and all stakeholders, and continuing to drive high standards of behaviour across the game.\n\nThe appointment follows a thorough process that involved a leading recruitment firm and considered a range of internal and external candidates.\n\nIt included consultation with the boards of all state and territory cricket associations, which were invited to provide feedback on suitable candidates and their views regarding the requirements of the role.\n\nFollowing interviews with a short-list of candidates, the CA board was unanimous in its decision to elect Dr Henderson as chair.\n\nAll state and territory chairs expressed their support for Dr Henderson’s election.\n\nDr Henderson has extensive experience in cricket, including having played in state junior teams for WA and first grade in Perth, been chair of the Western Australian Cricket Association and a director at CA for the past three years.\n\nDuring his time with WA Cricket, Dr Henderson played a significant role in developing strategies to drive growth in the game, including the development of Perth Stadium and the WACA Ground Improvement Project.\n\nHe is a highly successful executive, having been Group Chief Executive of Epworth HealthCare since 2017 and working in the healthcare industry for the past 30 years, including 20 years in corporate leadership roles.\n\nRichard Freudenstein will step down as interim chair with immediate effect. Mr Freudenstein, who has been interim chair since October last year, will remain on the CA board as a director.\n\nAs part of the ongoing board renewal process, the Cricket Australia nominations committee (comprising representatives of the CA board and state chairs) will commence the search for a new independent director.\n\nMr Freudenstein said: “I am delighted that Lachlan has been elected chair and would like to congratulate him on his appointment.\n\n“Lachlan’s extensive cricket administrative experience and impressive business background, leadership qualities, financial experience and deep understanding of the game ensures that cricket has a new chair who will continue to build unity, trust and respect across all levels of our national sport.\n\n“He brings a combination of fresh ideas, a clear plan and broad experience together with continuity to the position, having served as a CA director for the past three years.\n\n“The short-list of candidates for this role was outstanding but it was the unanimous opinion of the CA board that Lachlan was best suited to be our next chair.”\n\nDr Henderson said: “I would like to thank Richard, the other CA directors and the state chairs and boards for their support.\n\n“It is a privilege and honour to be elected chair and serve our national sport.\n\n“I’m really excited by the opportunities ahead. The CA board is relatively new, with seven of the nine members having been on the board for less than three and a half years, and the imminent appointment of a new independent director will bring further fresh ideas and perspectives to the board.\n\n“My love of cricket began as a kid growing up in Perth and the game has always been a big part of my life, as a player, through my involvement with WA Cricket, the board of Cricket Australia and now as the elected chair.\n\n“I’m looking forward to working closely with our states and territory cricket chairs and associations, the Australian Cricketers’ Association (ACA), our players and our partners, on how we unite and work together to ensure cricket continues to thrive into the future as Australia’s favourite sport.\n\n“As chair, my aim is to ensure the integrity and growth of the game in Australia with strong governance embedded at Cricket Australia and reflected in all levels of cricket, from elite teams to community clubs.\n\n“Among my other main priorities will be a focus on a strong, sustainable financial future for the game and building on the growth in our participation rates, particularly among girls and women, and our multi-cultural communities.”\n\nDr Henderson biography:\n\nDr Lachlan Henderson is the Group Chief Executive of Epworth HealthCare, the largest private hospital group in Victoria operating across 10 locations and employing over 7000 staff.\n\nPrior to moving to Melbourne to join Epworth in January 2017, Lachlan had nearly two decades of senior executive and CEO experience in the private hospital sector in Western Australia.\n\nHe is also a qualified medical practitioner and worked as a GP prior to embarking on a career as a healthcare executive.\n\nCritical to his success in these roles has been a focus on developing people and organisational culture while enhancing clinical and commercial outcomes.\n\nLachlan is a Graduate of the Australian Institute of Company Directors (AICD) and is the current President of the Australian Private Hospitals Association (APHA).\n\nIn 2018, Lachlan was appointed to the board of Cricket Australia, having previously been a board member of the Western Australian Cricket Association from 2013-2016, the last two years as chairman.\n\nA former state junior representative for WA at U/16 and U/19 levels, Lachlan represented both Perth and University Cricket Clubs in the 1st Grade competition in the 1980s.\n\nAustralian Cricket launches five-year strategic plan\n\nCricket Australia has released a new five-year strategic plan for Australian Cricket designed to enhance the game’s long-term financial sustainability, significantly increase participation and ensure cricket remains at the heart of Australian life.\n\n'Where the Game Grows' is underpinned by the ultimate belief that cricket is truly a game for all; one that has incredible power to bring people together and benefit society, both on and off the field.\n\nIt celebrates and respects cricket’s proud history while looking positively towards the future, seeking to drive bold, transformative change in digital experiences, junior participation, inclusion, gender equality, sustainability, reimagining the W/BBL, connection through storytelling and playing a part in developing the game globally.\n\nFour interrelated strategic pillars containing ten strategic priorities have been developed through extensive consultation with thousands of fans and hundreds of other stakeholders from all parts of cricket.\n\nThose four pillars - Brilliant Experiences, Participation Growth, Inspirational Players and Teams and Sustainable Future – reflect Australian Cricket’s priorities to strengthen the engagement between fans and players, continue to produce world class teams, entrench a strong and innovative business model and establish a framework for the game’s positive social impact.\n\n‘Where The Game Grows’ also sets the ambitious target of doubling the number of kids aged 5 to 12 registered to play cricket to 210,000 and increasing the number of girls registered in this age group to 60,000 over the next five years, contributing towards an overall registered participation target of more than 850,000.\n\nDr Lachlan Henderson, Cricket Australia Chair, said:\n\n“We are delighted to present the new five-year strategic plan for Australian Cricket. This plan comes at a critical time as we seek to ensure our national sport grows and continues to flourish.\n\n“It is important to recognise the firm footing on which cricket stands thanks to the efforts of those who have come before us and our players, match officials, staff and partners. The new strategy is informed by the knowledge and passion of those invested in cricket’s future and reflects our shared ambition.\n\n“Australian Cricket has embraced the opportunity the game provides to bring people and communities together as a Sport for All that makes Australians proud. This new strategy will ensure we maximise the resources and opportunities to realise this ambition.”\n\nNick Hockley, Cricket Australia Chief Executive Officer said:\n\n“We are exceptionally proud of the way Australian Cricket has continued to innovate and grow and particularly how it has met the vast challenges of the pandemic. This gives us even greater confidence that we can deliver on the ambitious priorities set out in the new five-year strategic plan.\n\n“Cricket is rapidly evolving and, with that, so too are the ways cricket is played, watched and consumed. This strategy contains both a vision and a clear plan for how we can achieve bold, transformative change while also meeting our core responsibilities.\n\n\"This includes ensuring that cricket has a positive social impact, whether by providing more opportunities for women and girls, making the game more accessible to participants from culturally diverse backgrounds or taking the necessary steps to make the game environmentally sustainable.”\n\n“As we look towards the future, I would like to thank everyone across the game for their passion and commitment as we work to unite and inspire everyone to love and play cricket and in so doing make cricket a sport for all that makes Australians proud.”\n\nCricket Australia announces annual results\n\nCricket Australia (CA) today released its Annual Report for 2021-22.\n\nIn the 2021-22 financial year, CA reported a net deficit of $5.1 million with significant factors including the costs of staging cricket throughout the pandemic and a challenging UK media rights market impacting this result.\n\nAustralian Cricket devised its new five-year strategy Where the Game Grows including four key pillars for the game’s future prosperity – Brilliant Experiences, Inspirational Players and Teams, Participation Growth and Sustainable Future.\n\nThe Australian men’s team won the home Ashes series 4-0, won the ICC T20 World Cup and toured Pakistan for the first time in almost 24 years, as well as fulfilling its commitment to tour Sri Lanka at a time of significant economic hardship in that country.\n\nThe Australian women’s team won the ICC Women’s World Cup, the multi-format home Ashes series and was ranked No.1 in ODI and T20I cricket.\n\nKFC BBL11 was the most watched sports league in Australia on a per-game linear TV basis with 506,000 viewers, while every game of the Weber WBBL07 season was televised making it the most watched WBBL ever.\n\nDespite COVID-19, participation and retention rates in community cricket remained robust with total registered participation increasing by 11% to 598,931. The growth of women and girls cricket continued with registered female participation increasing by 12,000 to 71,300.\n\nCA completed a record rights agreement with Disney Star to televise international cricket and the W/BBL in India and other regions, emphasising the enduring global value of the summer of Australian cricket.\n\nThe new ICC Future Tours Program was released including a five-Test home series against India putting the Border-Gavaskar Trophy on the same standing as the Ashes and multi-format women’s series against India and South Africa as well as England.\n\nFurther context around the financial result:\n\nCA again prioritised the need to deliver an almost full schedule of international cricket and W/BBL leagues on behalf of the players, State and Territory Associations and broadcast and commercial partners.\n\nA year-on-year reduction in total revenue of $14.3 million to $391 million was driven by a reduction in international media rights, partly offset by increased match revenues due to the popularity of the Ashes and improved Covid conditions.\n\nThe overall result was also boosted by a reduction in expenses, driven mainly by lower biosecurity costs than last year, the operation of the player revenue share model and strong cost controls.\n\nCA’s funding to States and Territory Associations increased by $9.5 million to $112.7 million.\n\nToday’s Annual General Meeting voted in favour of the re-election of John Harnden as a Director and the election of David Maddocks as a Director.\n\nClea Smith, a former Australian women’s international and current chief executive of The Mind Space, has been appointed to the CA Board as an Independent Director.\n\nDr Lachlan Henderson, Cricket Australia Chair, said:\n\n“We are again delighted by the spirit of collaboration demonstrated by everyone across cricket including the State and Territory Associations, the players, stadium operators and our various broadcast, commercial and government partners in confronting the challenges the game has faced throughout the global pandemic.\n\n“While there is no doubt these conditions have created financial pressure, we are confident Australian Cricket has set a strong platform from which to bring our new five-year strategy to life.\n\n“We acknowledge that this is a time of considerable change for cricket with the emergence of different formats and competitions across the world, as well as new commercial and partnership opportunities. As an organisation we will confidently embrace the future, while ensuring all our decisions benefit everyone from our elite players through to grassroots participants and volunteers.\n\n“We are enormously proud of the incredible success our women’s and men’s teams have enjoyed over the past year and, particularly, the way they have embraced their roles as ambassadors for Australian Cricket.\n\n“We also owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the hard work and resilience of the community clubs and volunteers who have kept participation and retention rates strong despite the extra burdens created by COVID-19 and, in some areas, devastating floods.\n\n“I would again like to thank Michelle Tredenick and Mel Jones for their outstanding contributions on the Board.”\n\nNick Hockley, Cricket Australia CEO, said:\n\n“So much has been achieved this year – whether on-field with Ashes success, World Cup triumphs and historic tours away, or off-field with progress to launch our next strategic plan, confirming the Future Tours Program, innovations in the Big Bash Leagues such as the inaugural BBL Draft and exciting new partnerships across our commercial program.\n\n“I am extremely grateful and proud of the many people across Australian Cricket whose hard work and sacrifices ensured we continued to deliver cricket on behalf of our players, fans, commercial and broadcast partners and communities, in the most challenging of circumstances.\n\n“The financial pressures experienced across the past two years have required focus and discipline to deliver efficiency measures and cost savings. I am particularly grateful to our players, match officials and staff who have worked tirelessly despite the added pressure and disruption these measures have sometimes created.\n\n“While cricket suffered some financial headwinds with added biosecurity costs and reduced match revenue, our partnerships with the players, broadcasters, commercial and government partners again demonstrated what can be achieved when we work together and we believe a great platform has been set for future collaboration.\n\n“Entering a summer that features the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, a record six international touring teams and the energised W/BBL, I am confident the hard work done over the past season, as well as our new five-year strategic plan, has us well placed to achieve our goal of making cricket a sport for all that makes Australians proud.”\n\nBeth Mooney and Steve Smith have capped prolific years with the bat to take out top honours at the Australian Cricket Awards held in Sydney tonight.\n\nMooney claimed her second Belinda Clark Award, following a season where across three formats she amassed 976 runs at an average of 65.1 and a strike-rate of 102.6.\n\nThe 29- year-old also took out the Women’s ODI Player of the Year, which included Australia’s 2022 ICC Women’s World Cup triumph in New Zealand, where Mooney scored an unbeaten 62 off 47 balls in the final.\n\nTahlia McGrath was voted the Women’s T20I Player of the Year after an incredible 12 months in the shortest format. McGrath averaged 62.14 with the bat and just 12.84 with the ball across the voting period, in which the Australian team lost only one match.\n\nIn the final Belinda Clark Medal tally, Mooney polled 129 votes, ahead of runner-up Meg Lanning (110) and Tahlia McGrath (95) in third place.\n\nSmith joined Michael Clarke and Ricky Ponting as the only players to win the Allan Border Medal four times, following a season where the 33-year-old scored 1547 runs in 32 matches across all three formats at an average 55.3. More than half of these runs were scored in the Test arena, where he amassed 863 at an average of 71.92.\n\nIn the final Allan Border Medal tally, Smith (171 votes) outpolled Travis Head (144 votes) and David Warner (141 votes).\n\nUsman Khawaja took out the Shane Warne Men’s Test Player of the Year Award, following an incredible return to the Australian team. Khawaja scored 1020 runs in the voting period at an average of 78.46, including three centuries.\n\nIn addition to being the leading run-scorer in men’s Test Cricket for Australia in 2022, Khawaja’s off-field contributions also earned him recognition with the Community Impact Award. The Australian opener’s Usman Khawaja Foundation helps young people from disadvantaged communities by providing educational and cricketing opportunities.\n\nWarner claimed his third Men’s ODI Player of Year, after scoring 552 runs at the top of the order at an average of 42.5. Warner scored four half-centuries and one hundred in 13 matches.\n\nMarcus Stoinis took out the Men’s T20 International Player of the Year for the first time, with the all-rounder striking at an incredible 168.5 within the voting period. In addition to his 347 runs at an average of 31.6, Stoinis also claimed eight wickets.\n\nAustralia’s top domestic cricketers were also acknowledged with Queensland’s Michael Neser and Victoria’s Annabel Sutherland taking out the Men’s and Women’s Domestic Player of the Year Awards, which includes matches in all formats.\n\nAdelaide Strikers’ Matt Short won the KFC BBL|12 Player of the Year Award, while Ashleigh Gardiner from the Sydney Sixers was the Weber WBBL|08 Player of the Year Award winner.\n\nFull List of Award winners\n\nBelinda Clark Award – Beth Mooney (129 votes)\n\n2nd: Meg Lanning (110 votes)\n\n3rd: Tahlia McGrath (95 votes)\n\nAllan Border Medal – Steve Smith (171 votes)\n\nTravis Head (144 votes)\n\nDavid Warner (141 votes)\n\nWomen’s ODI Player of the Year – Beth Mooney\n\nWomen’s T20I Player of the Year – Tahlia McGrath\n\nShane Warne Men’s Test Player of the Year – Usman Khawaja\n\nMen’s ODI Player of the Year – David Warner\n\nMen’s T20I Player of the Year – Marcus Stoinis\n\nWomen’s Domestic Player of the Year – Annabel Sutherland\n\nMen’s Domestic Player of the Year – Michael Neser\n\nBetty Wilson Young Cricketer of the Year – Courtney Sippel\n\nBradman Young Cricketer of the Year – Lance Morris\n\nCommunity Champion Award – Usman Khawaja\n\nWoolworths Cricket Blaster of the Year – Mabel Tovey\n\nAustralian Cricket Hall of Fame inductees – Marg Jennings and Ian Redpath\n\nWomen Cricketers big winners from new MOU\n\nCricket reaffirms its status as the most lucrative team sport for Australian women, with a 66% increase in payments to professional women cricketers.\n\nA major increase in women’s remuneration is a key plank of a new five-year MOU between Cricket Australia (CA) and the Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA) announced today.\n\nUnder the agreement, women players will share in $133 million (increased from $80 million in the previous agreement) rewarding members of Australia’s world champion team while significantly increasing the value of WBBL and State contracts.\n\nAs part of the new deal:\n\nThe top CA contract holder who also holds a WBBL contract can now earn more than $800,000 a year – with the capacity to break the $1 million mark with further earnings in the Women’s Premier League (India) and The Hundred (UK).\n\nThe next six CA contract holders will have the potential to earn on average $500,000 when combined with a WBBL retainer as well as the other earnings opportunities above.\n\nThe minimum and average CA Women’s contracts will increase 25%.\n\nThe number of Women’s CA contracts will increase from 15 to 18 and all of those holding contracts will now be recognised as full-time athletes.\n\nDual Format Domestic Female Players\n\nUnder the deal, domestic players who do not play for Australia, who play both WNCL (50 over) and WBBL (T20) formats can earn on average $151,019 annually (inclusive of match fees).\n\nThis makes them on average the highest-paid female players of team sports in Australia by a significant margin.\n\nWBBL Salary Cap Doubling\n\nThe substantial increase in women’s earnings extends through to the domestic game with the WBBL salary cap per team doubling to more than $732,000 each year.\n\nThe top WBBL players can now earn up to $133,000, (including superannuation).\n\nThe average WBBL player retainer will also double from approximately $26,900 to close to $54,200. The minimum WBBL retainer will jump by 30%.\n\nThese players are also able to earn additional income in the WPL and The Hundred.\n\nThe States (and the ACT) will have the ability to offer two additional contracts, increasing the number available to 16. There will be up to 130 contracts available across the national team and States and Territories and another 120 WBBL contracts.\n\nThe increases in payments and contracts for women cricketers reflect the shared ambition of CA and the ACA to reward professional women players, provide a pathway to full-time professionalism and to inspire more girls to pursue a career in cricket.\n\nFurther Parental Leave Advances\n\nAustralian cricket’s world-leading Parental Leave Policy has been further improved. Not only does it provide guaranteed contracts and retainers while a player is on parental leave, but now also offers further payment to help cover match fees foregone.

The six Test matches during the winter are in relatively short succession and we have a busy period of white ball cricket leading up to, and post, the ODI World Cup.\n\n“The NSP support and endorse the change to the MOU agreement which allows further scope for additional contracts which in turn creates additional depth to call on in the next period, as well as retaining the ability to utilise others from outside of this list.”\n\nMatthew Wade, Matthew Renshaw, Peter Handscomb and Matthew Kuhnemann received upgrades during the year but have not been offered a CA contract in 2023/24.\n\nComing off contract are Aaron Finch (retired from international cricket) and Mitchell Swepson.\n\nPlayers not awarded contracts as part of the initial squad of 24 can earn upgrades throughout the year by accruing 12 upgrade points.
