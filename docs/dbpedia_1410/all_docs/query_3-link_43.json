        "text": "Cricket Australia will steer clear of having a player-selector, with George Bailey to retire from the game in February before officially joining the national panel.\n\nBailey was on Wednesday confirmed as the country’s next selector, set to join Trevor Hohns and coach Justin Langer in one of the toughest jobs in the country. But while it was initially thought he would juggle the role with his playing duties for Tasmania, the veteran will retire from elite cricket after this summer’s Big Bash.\n\nStream the Australia v Pakistan Domain Test Series Live & Ad-Break Free During Play with KAYO SPORTS.

But you can’t pick a current player as a national selector.\n\n“I knew he was in the running. I just assumed he would have to retire ... This is as weird as it gets.”\n\nBailey won the role after the other leading contender, Michael Klinger, opted to take the BBL coaching job at Finch’s Melbourne Renegades.\n\nThe 37-year-old Tasmanian played five Tests, 90 ODIs and 30 T20s for Australia in an international career that spanned five-and-a-half years.\n\nLISTEN!
