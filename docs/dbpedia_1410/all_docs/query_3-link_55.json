        "text": "Australia’s new chairman of selectors George Bailey has put his hand up to leave the room if he is called to decide whether Tim Paine remains in the Test side for the Ashes.\n\nPaine’s future in the Australian XI is uncertain after the 36-year-old wicketkeeper gave up the captaincy when his 2017 sexting saga was made public last week.\n\nHe was already in a race to prove his fitness and form following neck surgery, with the likes of Mark Waugh and Shane Warne saying it’s now time for Australia to appoint a new gloveman.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nBut a conflict of interest threatens to overshadow the debate ahead of the first Test against England on December 8.\n\nIt is the most significant assignment for the refreshed selection panel of Bailey, coach Justin Langer and former player Tony Dodemaide.\n\nBailey - Paine’s long-time teammate, close friend and business partner - has revealed he will temporarily back out if it is not a unanimous decision to keep Paine in the side.\n\n“If the panel was not in agreeance with Tim’s position going forward and it was going to come down to a vote, then I would step aside and leave that to Tony and Justin to work through,” Bailey told a News Corp podcast with cricket journalists Peter Lalor and Gideon Haigh.\n\n“They’re both aware of that.”\n\nBailey and Paine, who played together with Tasmania and the Hobart Hurricanes, each own part of a fitness business in Tasmania, though they are not involved day to day.\n\nThe 39-year-old selector says the relationship is one of many conflicts he will navigate in his new role with the Australian team.\n\n“I feel like by saying that it sounds like Tim is the only close friend I have and I think since the day that I was given the opportunity to have this role we’ve been aware that’s the case,” Bailey said of the conflicts.\n\n“I have strong friendships and relationships that go back years with a number of players. I guess that can be viewed a number of ways. There could be a tendency to go easier or vice versa and you could be harder on those players at times.\n\n“I truly believe having strong relationships with the players. I doubly make sure to do the job to the best of my ability and I understand that the decisions we make have large ramifications both positive and negative both for the players and their families, their livelihoods and their careers.\n\n“It’s not something taken lightly and we put the work in because of that to make sure we try and make the best decision we can whether it is with Tim or with anyone.”\n\nQuestions have been raised about the merits of keeping Paine in the Test team, given the scandal, his age, lack of cricket and the captaincy being a major string to his bow.\n\nPaine is expected to bat on Tuesday at Hobart’s Lindisfarne Oval in the four-day second XI game and will have just one other hit-out, an intra-squad game, before the Ashes.\n\n“We’ve been aware that purely physically it is going to be a tight-run thing regardless, but he is certainly really confident that the injury has healed really well,” Bailey said.\n\n“This is the next step of the process: the return to play, how does it go, time on feet, the repetitive nature of wicketkeeping, batting under a game-like situation.\n\n“We’ll gather that evidence over the next few days.”\n\nSuccession plan\n\nFormer Test wicketkeeper Ian Healy believes Paine should play but said the 30-year-old Alex Carey, who is in an extended Australia A squad, is also deserving of a chance.\n\nHealy told SEN radio that selectors could go with Western Australia’s Josh Inglis, 26, or Queensland’s Jimmy Peirson, 29, if they wanted a long-term option.\n\nEx-Test captain Mark Taylor and former Victoria wicketkeeper Darren Berry believe Paine should be retained, given he holds the third-highest batting average of all glovemen to have played for Australia.\n\nBailey said selectors had already spoken about a succession plan for Paine, who took the reins of the side in early 2018 after the ball-tampering saga.\n\n“At the moment as far as batting wicketkeepers go, we are in a reasonably strong position between Alex Carey, Josh Inglis, Jimmy Pierson,” he said.\n\n“I watched Josh Philippe bat beautifully (on Sunday) as well.”\n\n- with AAP"
