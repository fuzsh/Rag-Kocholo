At that time, he was 10 years old.\n\nHe represented School Sport WA (SSWA) at the School Sport Australia Cricket Championships in 2013 in Perth, where his team won.\n\nGreen also represented WA in the Schoolboys Australian Football League (AFL) in 2011 at the School Sport Australia Championships held in Canberra.\n\nApart from that, he also played football as a key forward for the WA under-16 team.\n\nIn 2013, he captained the Scotch College 1st XI team that won the Darlot Cup.\n\nHe also captained Scotch College 1st XI in 2015/16.\n\nIn 2016, Green was an honors recipient for cricket and football at Scotch College.\n\nIn the same year, he was a part of the Scotch College 1st XVIII Football that won the Alcock Cup.\n\nHe represented the Western Australia (WA) cricket team at the 2015-16 Under-19 National Championships.\n\nOn 10 January 2017, he made his List A debut for Cricket Australia XI against Pakistanis at Allan Border Field, Brisbane during their tour of Australia.\n\nHe gave an extraordinary performance at the 2016-17 Under-19 Cricket Nationals. He scored 164 runs at an average of 82 and took 20 wickets in eight games. WA won the nationals by six wickets defeating ACT/NSW Country in the final in Adelaide. This was WA’s first under-19s title in 23 years. In the final, Green picked up 4-30 with the ball and then smashed 51 not out from just 23 balls and was named Player of the Match.\n\nEventually, he was forced to choose between his two sporting loves, football and cricket. His choice became clear when he earned a rookie contract with the Western Australian Cricket Association (WACA) ahead of the 2016/17 Sheffield Shield season.\n\nIn February 2017, Green made his first-class debut for WA against Tasmania at Bellerive Oval, Hobart during the Sheffield Shield. His career highlights include taking 5/24 in the first innings against Tasmania. The feat made him the youngest player to take a five-wicket haul in the Sheffield Shield.\n\nGreen was initially selected for his bowling talent given his advantageous height (6′ 6″) and ability to deliver fast outswing. His first 30 first-class wickets came at an impressive average of just 22.53.

He was named to Australia’s ODI and T20I squads for the 2020 India tour of Australia.\n\nOn 13 January 2019, he made his T20 debut for Perth Scorchers against Sydney Sixers in the 2018–19 Big Bash League season.\n\nIn March 2021, Green scored his first double-century in first-class cricket, with 251 runs for WA against Queensland in the 2020–21 Sheffield Shield season.\n\nIn August 2022, he took his first five-wicket haul in the ODI format against Zimbabwe in Townsville.\n\nOn 6 September 2022, in the first ODI against New Zealand in Cairns, he was named player of the match for scoring an unbeaten 89 (92) in a difficult run chase.\n\nIn October 2022, Green became an injury replacement for Josh Inglis in the Australian squad for the 2022 T20 World Cup.\n\nIn December 2022, he claimed his first five-wicket haul in Test cricket bowling in the first innings of the Boxing Day Test of South Africa tour of Australia at Melbourne Cricket Ground.\n\nGreen was bought by the Mumbai Indians for Rs. 17.5 crore (approximately $3.15 million AUD) for IPL 2023. He was the second most expensive overseas player in IPL auction history and the most expensive Australian player.\n\nOn 21 May 2023, he scored his maiden IPL century, an unbeaten 100 off 47 balls in a match against Sunrisers Hyderabad.\n\nCameron Green scored his maiden century in Tests (114) in the fourth Test against India in Ahmedabad during the 2023 Border-Gavaskar Trophy. However, the match ended in a draw.\n\nGreen was a part of the Australian squad that won the 2023 Cricket World Cup and the 2023 ICC World Test Championship final.\n\nOn 29 February 2024, he scored his second international century (174) against New Zealand at Basin Reserve, Wellington. In the match, Green and Josh Hazlewood set a record by forming the highest 10th-wicket partnership in Test cricket with 116 runs, breaking the previous record of 114 set by Jason Gillespie and Glenn McGrath in 2004.\n\nHe was bought by Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) for IPL 2024.\n\nCameron Green and Australian cricketer Tim David were schoolmates at Scotch College. David used to coach him before school.\n\nHis sister, Bella Green, lives in Florida, US. Athletic like her brother, she used to play first-division college basketball.\n\nHe is a dog lover and has a dog named Brownie."
