        "text": "George Bailey's expected appointment as a national selector while still a domestic cricketer has been backed by Usman Khawaja, who says those playing deserve a bigger say in the game.\n\nTasmanian veteran Bailey is a frontrunner for the vacancy - to serve alongside Trevor Hohns and Justin Langer - set to be filled as early as Tuesday.\n\nThe fact he's still contracted to and playing for Tasmania is understood not to be an issue for Cricket Australia and Queensland captain Khawaja said it was actually a good thing.\n\n'DISTURBING': England gun claims he copped 'racial insults' from fan\n\nSKIPPERâ€™S SPRAY: Tim Paine extends feud with India captain Virat Kohli\n\nFellow domestic veteran Michael Klinger is also in the running for the job, although the recently-retired batsman is also heavily linked to the vacant Melbourne Renegades coaching role.\n\nKhawaja, who missed selection for the current two-Test series against Pakistan, hardly needed prompting when asked his thoughts on the arrangement.\n\n\"Like a current domestic player? Like George Bailey or something? I think there is always an option there,\" he said.\n\n\"There is no one more involved and more relevant in the game than people who are actually playing the game.\n\n\"Players are one of the biggest stakeholders, sometimes the most under-utilised and undervalued stakeholders in the game.\n\n\"It's always important to have someone who still has some skin in the game.\"\n\nThe endorsement comes after Australian captain Tim Paine revealed he conducted a mock interview with Bailey in the dressing room during a Sheffield Shield game.\n\nNew high performance boss Ben Oliver said they were \"on the home stretch\" to announcing the new selector, who would bring an extra consideration to white ball cricket.\n\nHe said national talent and pathway manager Graham Manou would continue to act as a conduit to ensure no emerging talent is lost in the domestic system."
