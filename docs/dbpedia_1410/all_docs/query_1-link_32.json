        "text": "Jason Paul Behrendorff (born 20 April 1990) is an Australian cricketer, currently listed with Western Australia and the Perth Scorchers in Australian domestic cricket. Although born in New South Wales, Behrendorff grew up in Canberra, and played representative cricket for the Australian Capital Territory at both junior and senior and levels. A left-arm fast bowler, he transferred to Western Australia for the 2009–10 season, and made his debut at state level the following season, playing several matches after injuries to other fast bowlers. Behrendorff has since become a regular for Western Australia, opening the bowling in both the Sheffield Shield and the one-day Matador BBQs One-Day Cup. He made his debut for the Perth Scorchers during the 2012–13 season of the Big Bash League, and featured in the Scorchers teams that won consecutive titles during the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons.\n\nBorn in Camden, New South Wales, Behrendorff grew up in Canberra, and played cricket for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) at both under-17 and under-19 level. He played grade cricket for Tuggeranong Valley in the ACT's grade cricket competition, and represented the Prime Minister's XI in a match against the touring New Zealand national cricket team in 2009. Behrendorff was recruited by Western Australia for the 2009–10 season, having impressed state selectors during a trial match.\n\nBeginning in the Futures League, good form allowed him to make his List A debut for Western Australia in the 2010–11 Ryobi One-Day Cup, in a match against Tasmania at Hands Oval. In the match, he dismissed Mark Cosgrove with the first ball of Tasmania's innings, finishing with figures of 1/18 from five overs. Due to injuries to other fast bowlers, Behrendorff played more regularly at state level the following season, taking 4/76 on his Sheffield Shield debut against Victoria in November 2011. He finished the 2011–12 season with 13 wickets from five Shield matches and five wickets from five Ryobi One-Day Cup matches, having often competed with Nathan Coulter-Nile for a regular spot in the side.[10] At the end of the 2011–12 season, Behrendorff was given the \"Future Legend\" award at the Western Australian Cricket Association's awards night.[11][12]"
