        "text": "Every team at the Champions League has now played a match and while some are already through to the next stage and some are teetering on the edge of elimination I’ve seen enough to offer some thoughts on the tournament and the outfits involved.\n\nBefore diving headlong into that task a short word about the media’s general description of the tournament. I keep reading that the Champions League is a club tournament. This may be correct for some of the teams involved but in most cases this is grossly incorrect.\n\nThey are not clubs but representative First Class teams made up of players from lower division clubs. Grade cricket clubs in Australia’s case. Some may think this insignificant but I doubt that the players from Trinidad believe they are playing club cricket. They are representing their nation and in NSW and Victoria’s case, their individual states.\n\nEnough semantics. Harking back to cricket I’ve found this tournament most enjoyable. In this age of endless international fixturing the game at the highest level is becoming somewhat homogenised and watching the differing approaches of each individual nation’s champion has been fantastic especially when you appreciate the unique way that different cultures and geographic regions approach the game.\n\nIt is difficult to judge Indian domestic cricket using the IPL teams as a mirror due to the overwhelming number of imports and slightly less so the English representatives due to their multicultural nature, which is at least a facsimile of their international team’s make-up, but many of the best performed teams – Victoria, the Cape Cobras, NSW and Trinidad – are comprised of players brought up and educated from the same cricketing system. For the time being at least, this familiarity with each other, both from a cricketing and cultural perspective, has served them very well indeed.\n\nNSW and Trinidad are perfect examples of this with both teams playing in the style that has made them famous the cricketing world over for generations.\n\nNSW, who believe wholeheartedly that they are and have always been the best First Class region on the planet, play as you would expect. Ruthlessly, aggressively and efficiently. That is and always has been the way they play and Australia’s style reflects this.\n\nSimilarly, Trinidad are full of spinners and outrageous strokemakers which has been their approach to cricket for many a decade and it is this display of regional style that is making the tournament a delight to witness.\n\nThe BCCI, Cricket Australia and the South African Cricket Board deserve credit for putting their many differences aside and creating this tournament because it will be a success, now and in the future, although I am yet to be convinced that it will eventually be the all franchise extravaganza that many a pundit predict.\n\nI cannot imagine a time when Australian State cricket teams will be similar to IPL franchises although a couple of guest T20 players is likely to be commonplace, although a tad controversial, if the unexpected negative reaction to Lasith Malinga’s potential T20 contract for Tasmania is any indication (Some think that the money could be better spent as Tasmania have a fine bowling attack and less resources than other States).\n\nNor can I see the Caribbean nations going in a similar direction. This is their only chance to represent their nation in cricket outside their regional tournaments and the importance and prestige of that fact is not to be underestimated.\n\nI’m led to believe the English teams have tightened their import allocation. Additionally, it is doubtful teams from New Zealand and Sri Lanka would ever be able to afford the millions to replicate the IPL model either. Perhaps the South African faux-franchises may follow the IPL method but for the forseeable future the cricket world outside India will follow the same methods that they always have. That is pick the best team from the competition directly below First Class level and invest in the youth of their particular region.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen so far in the stadia of Hyderabad, Delhi and Bangalore it is doubtful that the cricketing world is about to change significantly. However, this tournament is providing an excellent platform to showcase domestic cricket and that can only be good for the game on every level and in every sense.\n\nStay Human"
