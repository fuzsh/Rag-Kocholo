        "text": "Tasmania batsman George Bailey has brought back the strange batting stance we saw him debut in a one-day international in 2016.\n\nBailey was in fine form against NSW in the Sheffield Shield on Monday, playing beautifully for a well-made 71.\n\nSPICY SCENES: Joe Root in post-play confrontation with Aussies\n\nHowever it was his batting stance that was the talk of the town after his innings came to an end.\n\nAgainst former Test quicks Dough Bollinger and Trent Copeland, Bailey stood with the vast majority of his back to the bowler, facing more towards the cover region.\n\nAussie captain Steve Smith is known for his highly unorthodox batting technique, but we doubt even he would attempt this strange stance.\n\nWe first saw Bailey's bizarre tactics in December last year when he was playing for Australia against New Zealand at the SCG.\n\nOn that occasion he was dismissed cheaply and went away from the unusual stance, until Monday.\n\nBailey's innings, as well as Jordan Silk's fifth first-class century and a Matthew Wade cameo put Tasmania in a strong position at stumps on day two in Hobart.\n\nThe Tigers were sent in under gloomy skies after wild rain wiped out the opening day's play and went on to compile 4-392.\n\nIt didn't faze Silk, who hit 104 against a four-strong NSW pace battery, while Test discard Matthew Wade smashed an unbeaten 72 off 68 balls late in the day."
