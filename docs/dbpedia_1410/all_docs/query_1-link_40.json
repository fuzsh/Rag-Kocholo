        "text": "Cameron Bancroft was sporting his facial injuries at the Sheffield Shield final after the opener was ruled out due to concussion after a nasty mishap ahead of the final game of the season. Bancroft has been Western Australia's best batter across the 2023/24 campaign, but a freak cycling accident only days out from the season showstopper left him concussed.\n\nBancroft suffered the nasty concussion with a WA Cricket spokesperson confirming the opener's absence would prompt a re-jig at the top of the order for the defending champs. The 33-year-old was forced to watch on from the stands against Tasmania as the four-day match started on Thursday at the WACA. Western Australia lost the toss and was sent the home team into bat. And the move backfired after a strong start with Darcy Short and Sam Whiteman guiding the home team to 0-82.\n\nBancroft was on hand to support his teammates in the stands. And the opener could be seen with some facial injuries after his cycling accident. Andrew Tye saw the funny side of the incident having gestured behind Bancroft after finding out the duo were on camera.\n\nThe opener has been the leading run-scorer over the previous two seasons and loomed as arguably the biggest danger man to the Tasmania side. Fortunately for his team, Short and Whiteman were in great form having piled on the runs before lunch.\n\nCameron Bancroft pushes for Australia position\n\nThe loss of Bancroft comes as WA looks to claim three successive Sheffield Shield titles for the first time since the 1988/89 season when they won their third straight. It's also a blow to Bancroft's hopes of further pressing his claims for a Test recall after being overlooked as David Warner's replacement for Australia, with Steve Smith ultimately promoted to opener but struggling to cement his spot there.\n\nWhile Western Australia are looking to win their third straight Sheffield Shield title, Tasmania are looking to win their first Shield title since 2012/13. And they are also looking at sending former Aussie star Matthew Wade off with a win.\n\nThe left-handed batter posted a match-winning knock in the T20 World Cup semi-final in 2021 amid Australia's run to the trophy and has won four Shield titles with Victoria - including two as captain. However he hasn't tasted success with Tasmania and will be desperate to go out on a high in the Shield final against his old state.\n\nTasmania will also be buoyed by the news Webster was announced as the Sheffield Shield's player of the season this week. Beau Webster edged out NSW batter Ollie Davies and Western Australia quick Joel Paris to claim the award voted on by umpires across the course of the season."
