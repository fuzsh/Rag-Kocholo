        "text": "By Andrew McGlashan\n\n24 Mar 2024, 9:52 am\n\nAwards and presentations...\n\nBeau Webster was previously confirmed as player of the season. Sam Whiteman is named player of the match.\n\nJordan Silk: \"Beau, it's probably one of the best season's I've seen in Shield cricket. Really proud of you. To our guys, a really great season. We were probably underdogs at the start of the season and to get to this position is something I'm really proud. Hopefully this fueling the hunger. Lastly, to Wadey, it's been a pleasure to play cricket with you for Tassie. I know how much it meant to come back and play for Tassie. You should be incredibly proud of your career.\"\n\nSam Whiteman and the WA team get their hands on the Sheffield Shield (again). It's quite the legacy they are building. Not sure we'll hear from Whiteman right now, but we'll have his thoughts on the site later. I'll wrap up the live blog there. Thanks for your company over the last few days and throughout the Australian season across all the various competitions. We'll be back to do it again in September. Until then, winter well down under."
