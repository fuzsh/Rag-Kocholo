        "text": "The Hobart Hurricanes are thrilled to announce that Mitch Owen has a signed a contract extension with the club, this will see the all-rounder stay in purple until at least 2025.\n\nThe home-grown youngster who had one year remaining on his current agreement with the Hurricanes – has signed an additional one-year extension.\n\nOwen has currently played 10 matches for the Hurricanes in the Big Bash, including taking figures of 1-17 in a crucial match against the Adelaide Strikers to dismiss Chris Lynn.\n\nThe Tasmanian’s talent extends beyond the T20 format, where he currently holds a contract with the Tasmanian Tigers as an all-rounder with big hitting talent and strength as a medium pace bowler.\n\nAfter earning his first contract in 2020, Owen made his List A debut for the Tigers in 2021 against Queensland and has since been in and out of the Tigers squad for both Marsh Sheffield Shield and Marsh One-day Cup.\n\nOwen was also one of the most dominant figures in the most recent Cricket Tasmania Premier League season, scoring 885 runs at an average of 49.17 and taking 23 wickets at 25.22 for the New Town Bucks.\n\nCaptain of his grade club at just 22, Owen possesses leadership qualities and experience beyond his years, best showcased in his efforts leading New Town to a historic 1st Grade Premiership in the 21/22 CTPL campaign.\n\n“I’m really excited for this season and having opportunity to win our first tournament, I feel like I’m ready to play a role within the team that can help us win games and hopefully lift some silverware,” Owen said.\n\n“It’s always a nice feeling being a local player representing your home states team - it was a dream as a younger player and now that has become reality, it’s something I’m very grateful for.\n\n“I think with the experience in the group there is enough there that I can learn from and lean on to help me improve my game. Although I haven’t had the opportunities I would’ve liked, I’ve got to keep growing my game so that when I’m called upon, I’m ready,” Owen said.\n\nHurricanes head coach, Jeff Vaughan, discussed how important it is to have young homegrown talent in the squad.\n\n“It’s great to have local talent like Mitch be part of this squad, he’s demonstrated just how much of an asset he is to the team, and we know that he will be an addition of talent that will help get us closer to where we want to be as a club.”\n\n“He’s definitely shown us glimpses of what he’s capable of with both the bat and ball, we know that under the guidance of some of our more experienced players that he will be a long-term investment for the team.”\n\nOwen joins Corey Anderson (o/s) Iain Carlisle, Tim David, Paddy Dooley, Nathan Ellis, Sam Hain (o/s) Peter Hatzoglou, Caleb Jewell, Chris Jordan (o/s) Ben McDermott, Riley Meredith, Mitch Owen, Billy Stanlake, Matthew Wade and Mac Wright as Hurricanes currently contracted for BBL|13.\n\nThe Hurricanes will get their BBL|13 campaign underway on December 11, when they take on the Sydney Sixers at home in Launceston."
