        "text": "After a long apprenticeship in domestic cricket, George Bailey was finally rewarded with regular international appearances.\n\nBailey's rapid rise to the captaincy in limited-overs cricket spoke volumes of his leadership ability and popularity in the Australian dressing-room.\n\nWhile his Test career has stalled following a disappointing 2013-14 Ashes campaign with the bat, he continued to perform well in limited-overs cricket.\n\nHe will be remembered fondly for the 28 runs he smashed off one Jimmy Anderson over in Perth in memorable summer for the Aussies.\n\nHis Test debut came on the back of his extraordinary ODI performance against India in 2013, where he plundered 478 runs at an average of 95.60 and jumped to No.2 in the world rankings.\n\nIn 2017-18, Bailey was awarded the Ricky Ponting medal after being named Tasmanian cricketer of the season."
