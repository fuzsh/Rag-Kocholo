Biography[]

After playing his junior cricket with the South Launceston Cricket Club, Bailey was first selected to play for Tasmania 2005/06, due to injuries to regular players. The season saw him score 778 runs, hitting three centuries in the process. Further prominent performances in the coming seasons saw Bailey play for Australia against the All Star team in the All Star Twenty20 match in 2009. Bailey was appointed as the permanent captain of Tasmania for the 2009/10 season, replacing Daniel Marsh.[2]

On 14 February 2011, Bailey led Tasmania to a remarkable five wicket Sheffield Shield win over Victoria where he scored an unbeaten 160. Needing 130 in the final session, he and James Faulkner pushed the Tigers past the total in the 91st over of play on the final day to lift Tasmania to second on the table behind New South Wales.[3] He captained Tasmania to its second Sheffield Shield title against New South Wales at Bellerive Oval in 2010/11.
