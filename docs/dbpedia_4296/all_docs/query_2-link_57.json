This is a spectacular natural site with a spring, natural pools and beaches in the river Mijares. This amazing thermal spot is located 1.7 km from Montanejos. The spring has a flow of 6,000 litres per minute and a constant temperature of 25ºC. Yet a bit further away from the spring, the water is much colder. The water has hydrogeochemical and biological properties. Bathing in them is beneficial to health.\n\nThere is a beautiful 7-pipe fountain right next to the natural pool. Drinking this water is also good for your health. It has medical indications for skin, kidney and digestive system diseases. Its water was declared of public utility by the Royal Order of October 13, 1863.\n\nAccording to the legend, Almohad governor Abú Zayd constructed Arab baths. He believed this place gave ‘eternal youth’ to the women of his harem. Remains of ancient Arab baths from the 12th century have been found near Fuente de los Baños. These can still be seen on the right bank of the river.\n\nFuente de los Baños is very popular. In high season, there is capacity control and tickets are sold in advance. It’s a protected natural spot. Hence, it has many limitations in place (see the Restrictions section below).\n\nThe Mijares River flows through a gorge with abundant vegetation. The photo shows two swimmers entering the canyon.\n\nMontanejos river beach is wide. In the background is the bridge across the river.\n\nFrom the nearest car park, go down this path to reach the thermal spot of ‘Fuente de los Baños’.\n\nAccording to legend, the Almohad prince, Zayd Abú Zayd built Arab baths, so that the women of his harem would always stay beautiful and young.\n\nTo the left of Fuente de los Baños is a building (open only in high season). It has toilets and showers, a place to change clothes and a kiosk for refreshments or snacks.\n\nTo the left is the fountain of Fuente de los Baños. It has ceramic altarpieces of the ‘Virgen de los Desamparados’ and the coat of arms of Montanejos.\n\nThe 7-pipe fountain recalls the legend, with an inscription about Abu Zayd.\n\nThe spring water gushes out of the reeds. The constant temperature of 25 °C facilitates bathing all year round (at least in this area).\n\nIn the high season, they charge €3 per adult and €1.5 per child.\n\nThe Mijares river canyon is impressive in this area.\n\nThe rock formations and colours of the canyon are unique.\n\nIf you turn around, you’ll see the river beach and the bridge over the river.\n\nThe strait ‘Estrecho de Chillapájaros’ is 1 km upstream from the Fuente de los Baños. It’s a section of the Mijares River with huge stone walls on either side.\n\nTake the plunge!\n\nDiscover the most mind-blowing places to swim in nature.\n\n%\n\nDIFFICULTY LEVEL\n\nSWIMMING HOLES\n\nIN CASTELLÓN\n\nCheck out the best Swimming Holes & Places to Swim INLAND!\n\nMontanejos\n\nArañuel\n\nSwimming Safety\n\nRead these Tips\n\n&\n\nbe Safe\n\nwhen Wild Swimming\n\nDESTINATIONS\n\nUK\n\nSpain\n\nBali\n\nBelize\n\nMexico\n\nTrinidad and Tobago\n\nCosta Rica\n\nIndia\n\nMartinique\n\nSWIMMING SPOTS\n\nCheck out the best places to go wild swimming, by the TYPE of swimming spot\n\nSwimming Holes\n\nLakes\n\nRivers\n\nWaterfalls\n\nSea\n\nKeep it Clean!\n\nThe Rules\n\nLike us on Facebook!\n\nFacebook Posts\n\nHOW TO GET TO - Montanejos\n\nGetting There\n\nTransport Options\n\nThe easiest way is to arrive by car at one of the 2 parking lots (see ‘Parking’ below) and then walk from there.\n\nFrom Valencia there are 5 buses per week to Montanejos (duration 1h 30 min).\n\nFrom Castellón de la Plana there are 2 buses per week (lines 323 and 322) to Jérica (duration 1 h 25 min).\n\nFrom Jérica to Montanejos there are 5 buses per week (duration 21 min).\n\nFrom Valencia, there is a suburban train to Caudiel and from there you can go by taxi to Montanejos.\n\nGetting There\n\nHow to get to Montanejos\n\nBy car from Castellón, it’s 61 km (1h 12 min).

It’s the outflow point (or spillway) of the Arenós Reservoir, through which 41,000 litres of water flow out per second. To access El Chorro you can leave your car here. There is only capacity for about 3 cars. It’s about a 5-minute walk down to El Chorro.\n\nThe ‘Estrecho de Chillapájaros‘ is a section of the Mijares River in which it flows through a 25 m wide gorge. The vertical walls are higher than 100m. It owes its name to the sound made by swallows and swifts echoing off the rock walls.\n\nIt’s a place with famous climbing areas.
