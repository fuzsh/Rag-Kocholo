        "text": "The Blue Angel Ecologo (De: Blauer Engel) is a voluntary labeling program for products and services. The label is awarded to products within dozens of categories in the German marketplace and across many unique sectors. The Blue Angel logo demonstrates that a product has assessed all possible impacts over the complete life cycle.\n\nIn this way, a product bearing the Blue Angel logo has shown a clear and thorough dedication to health and the environment. Blue Angel does not directly compare products in the same class to determine which is “better”. Instead, each candidate gets assessed according to product-specific regulation criteria. The label is then awarded based on performance and production.\n\nThe Blue Angel logo has gained a strong reputation as a quality standard for environmentally friendly products and services. Goods that bear the label have proven their dedication to sustainability across their entire life cycle. Consumers can trust these products to have a low impact (when compared to typical market products in the same class).\n\nTherefore, intermediate manufacturers concerned about supply chain sustainability can rest assured: products bearing the Blue Angel logo have shown high standards. Likewise, producers that attain Blue Angel licensure can demonstrate a well-recognized authority in ecodesign to their clients."
