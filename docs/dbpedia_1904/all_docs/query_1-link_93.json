        "text": "Performance Year: 2022\n\nGrammy winning-opera singer Angel Blue has emerged in recent seasons as one of the most important sopranos before the public today. She has taken the opera world by storm with historic performances as Violetta in Verdi’s La Traviata. Despite being told it would never happen, Ms. Blue was the first black woman to ever sing the fully staged role in Italy at Teatro alla Scala in 2019.\n\nShe opened the Metropolitan Opera’s 2019/2020 season as Bess in a new production of George Gershwin’s Porgy and Bess. These performances followed her internationally praised French opera debut and role debut as Floria Tosca at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in July of 2019. She has been praised for performances in many other theaters, such as the Vienna State Opera, Semperoper Dresden, San Francisco Opera, Seattle Opera, Theater an der Wien, Oper Frankfurt, and San Diego Opera. Also active on the concert platform, she has appeared in recital and in concert in more than 35 countries."
