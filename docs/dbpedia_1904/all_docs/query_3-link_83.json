        "text": "The plan, Angel Blue freely admits, is “nuts”. “Absolutely, 100 per cent nuts,” the American soprano says from the study in her home in New Jersey, where her husband and nine-year-old stepson have been seeing a lot more of her during the past eight months.\n\nBlue, one of a new generation of bankable and forthright opera stars, was hoping that her streamed Christmas recital for the Metropolitan Opera could be done from New York City, even if the opera house itself is closed. “I could drive — it’s like 15, 20 minutes from my house. But that didn’t work out.”\n\nInstead, the 36-year-old’s live Christmas recital has turned into a live New Year’s Eve gala, and this being the Met, the plan is wildly ambitious."
