        "text": "With [INAUDIBLE], Keiko Devaux continues her cycle of works exploring sound memory and auditory imagination. The composer’s interest in how sound can be transformed or altered in recollection is related to her compositional process, in which she often explores abstract melodic-harmonic and rhythmic gestures drawn from her memory.\n\nThe work is inspired by the effects made by the white noise of “off-air” radio and television signals and by the sound of scans and beeps of scanning signals. The work’s tensions arise from the contrasted reminiscences of these sound sources and from the act of pulling them up. Episodic memories of sounds reappear, get caught in a loop and deform. Overlaid on, melding into and interrupting each other or sometimes taking up the whole space, these evocations of noise may be expressed by the orchestra, by an instrumental section or by a soloist. The orchestra weaves long bolts of blurred sound worlds that are briefly broken by outbursts and dance fragments, often in opposition. Like tectonic plates of the memory, these layers evolve throughout the work, at times fighting for the foreground, before culminating in a moment of sonic cohesion. Fundamentally, the work is based not on quotation but on exploring rememorization, with the composer using old audible events to construct equivalent strucutral, harmonic and stylistic elements.\n\n“The title [INAUDIBLE] comes from my side project of collecting film subtitles that describe sounds. The term ‘inaudible’ is common and I find it fascinating. The idea of describing the sound of something we can’t hear is an amazing concept for me. It evokes everything and nothing.” – Keiko Devaux\n\n“I think I must have composed Knoxville within a few days… You see, it expresses a child’s feelings of loneliness, wonder and lack of identity in that marginal world between twilight and sleep.” – Samuel Barber\n\nBorn into comfortable surroundings in West Chester, Pennsylvania, in 1910, the young Samuel Barber was fascinated by the art of a maternal aunt, a contralto with the Metropolitan Opera, and her husband, a songwriter, who would long provide him with valuable advice. After privately studying piano and organ, the gifted student attended Philadelphia’s Curtis Institute of Music from 1924 to 1932, where he enjoyed his first successes as a composer. Winning the American Rome Prize, he travelled to Europe in the mid-1930s for his first extended stay, familiarizing himself with the latest trends. Yet “his music retained a fundametally classical dimension always at the service of the most direct expression” (Alain Poirier).\n\nIn 1947, on a commission from soprano Eleanor Sterber, Barber composed his “lyric rhapsody” Knoxville: Summer of 1915, setting extracts of a prose poem by James Agee (1909-1955). Written in 1938, the text conveys the impressions of a young boy (the author, already thoughtful for a child his age) during a summer evening in Knoxville, Tennessee, shortly after the turn of the century. In a gently nostalgic atmosphere, the child recalls sights, sounds and smells, members of his family and his feeling of lonliness; Agee would lose his father the following year, which shattered his world, and he later made the poem the preamble to his 1957 novel A Death in the Family.\n\nTo judge from the quality of his setting, Barber was deeply affected by the subject and evocative power of Agee’s poem. In lush, wind-dominated sonorities, he superbly depicts the reverie of memory, combining musical images that bring it to life: the descending night, the muted atmosphere of a summer sunset, the quiet conversations, a passing streetcar with its clatter, lights, movement and the crackling spark that powers it along. Later, when the text mentions the father, the music breifly imagines his impending death, before the child’s final thoughts about who he is bring the piece to a close with a return to the initial dreamlike atmosphere.\n\nExceptionally gifted from a young age, Samuel Barber began learning piano from his mother while his aunt Louise Homer, a contralto with the Metropolitan Opera, sparked an interest in vocal music, which would ultimately form nearly two-thirds of his output. Enrolled at Philadelphia’s Curtis Institute of Music, where he studied singing, composition and orchestral conducting, and the recipient of many awards, Barber forged a brilliant career in Europe and his country of birth by cultivating an “elegant neo-Romanticism” (Virgil Thomson). Despite the occasional foray into dodecaphony and polytonality. his writing remains “elegiac, lyrical and refined” (Marc Honegger), though it also doesn’t shrink from dissonance and, in contrast to his compatriots Bernstein, Copland and Florence Price, doesn’t incorporate typically American jazz and folklore elements.\n\nAmong his few stage works, Barber left us two operas. The first, Vanessa, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1956. Barber then received a commission for a second, this one for the 1966 inauguration of the Metropolitan Opera House at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. It would be Antony and Cleopatra, with a libretto by Franco Zeffirelli based on selected passages drawn from the Shakespeare play of the same name. Despite the presence of Leontyne Price in the role of Cleopatra, the premiere was poorly received and, due to the cast of hundreds, which included live animals, deemed vulgar and extravagant. However, the New York Times did note that “Mr. Barber’s score, as we discovered from subsequent exposure to revised excerpts, was to a great extent an innocent victim of the over-all fiasco.” Barber was devastated and put the opera back on the drawing board, working with his partner, Gian Carlo Menotti, to premiere a revised version in 1975.\n\nOn Cesar’s death, Mark Antony inherits Egypt and its queen, Cleopatra. The two fall madly in love. But Antony’s rival, Octavius Cesar, forces Antony to marry his sister Octavia to strengthen ties. He then declares war on Egypt, for he too is taken with Cleopatra. Defeated, Mark Antony takes his life and, in a grand final scene, the queen joins him in death from the bite of an asp. In an atmosphere alternating between agony and resignation, Cleopatra, in royal garb, voices her thoughts as her servants present her with the basket that contains the fatal snake. Sumptuously orchestrated, the intense and dramatic music brilliantly expresses all the feelings that cross the queen’s heart and mind before she draws her final breath.\n\nThe origin of Florence Price’s current fame can be traced back to 2009, when a large number of her manuscript scores were found in an abandoned country house near Chicago that once belonged to her. Despite a prolific career, she had fallen into near total obscurity. Born Florence Beatrice Smith in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1887, she began learning the piano from her mother and later enrolled at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, where she studied piano, organ and musical education and took private composition courses from George Chadwick, who would long be a mentor. Returning to the Deep South of her birth, she taught for a while in Little Rock and at Clark Atlanta University, an Afro-American institution, despite having her application for membership in the Arkansas Music Teachers Association rejected, among other annoyances. In 1912, she married lawyer Thomas J. Price, whose name she would keep after their divorce in 1931.\n\nThe family soon moved to Chicago where, in a more supportive social and artistic climate, her First Symphony was premiered in 1933 by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the first symphony by a black woman to be performed by a major American orchestra. Price was very active, especially in the National Association of Negro Musicians, and received the occasional honour but struggled to have her compositions performed due at least as much to her sex as to the colour of her skin. Her work is abundant and in every genre. Though it derives from the post-romantic European tradition – Dvořák’s influence is strongly felt – it also draws on spirituals (Leontyne Price and Marian Anderson, among others, would sing her arrangements) and displays a very personal sensibility.\n\nCommissioned in 1938 by the Works Progress Administration’s Federal Music Project, part of the New Deal, Price’s Symphony No. 3 in C minor makes less use of Afro-American folk themes than the First Symphony but does so more skillfully. After an almost Wagnerian-sounding brass prelude, the first movement briefly presents an impetuous theme that alternates with more lyrical passages involving all the desks. The Andante ma non troppo combines a very romantic treatment with recollections of spirituals. The following Juba is a dance brought from Africa by former slaves, with a syncopated rhythm, leaps, tapping and clapping (slaves were not allowed to use drums) that Price handles in a somewhat smiling manner, with rare and colourful percussive effects. The symphony concludes with a lively, joyful Scherzo."
