        "text": "Hey there. I love angelfish and my tank would be too small for any of those angels. I would absolutely love a Maculosus, King / Passer, Clarion (super expensive!), Koran and Emperor.\n\nHowever, with the exception of the Clarion which gets to 8”, the rest all get to well over a foot long. If you want all of them you’ll need a very large tank to accommodate them.\n\nQueen, Cortez, Clarion, Passer all belong to the genus Holocanthus. The rest you mentioned belong to the genus Pomacanthus. Not sure how multiple species of the same genus (with these two genuses specifically) would work out, so I’m not the best person to ask.\n\nI don’t know how big your tank is, but mind if I suggest some medium sized angelfish if you can’t get all those large-Large angels into the same tank?\n\n1. Genicanthus Angels- Lamarck’s (9”), Spot Breast and Bellus (7”), Watanabei (6”), Masked Swallowtail (8.25”), Red Sea Lyretail (8.25”).- Can be kept as a male / female pair or as a harem of one male to two or more females. The only completely reef safe genus. From everywhere I’ve heard they’re among the hardiest of angels given they are well-collected / well acclimated.\n\n2. Chaetodonplus Angels- You can find the Scribbled (10”) and Blue Lined (8”) Captive bred. In fact a Captive Bred Scribbled Angel is very high on my stocking priorities. You could also consider a captive bred Singapore / Vermiculated Angel (8”) from Poma Labs but it’s nowhere near as striking as the Scribbled IMO.\n\n3. Apolemichthys Angels- Xanthurus Cream (8”) is the easiest and not a hard angel to keep overall. You could also consider the larger but rarer / more expensive Goldflake Angel (10”). I believe both can be found captive bred.\n\n4. If (and only if) you’re up for a challenge, a Regal Angel (10”). Best to get a specimen that’s healthy, eating, and from the Red Sea. Genus Pygoplites.\n\n5. The Majestic is the smallest out of the large-Large angelfish. I haven’t been able to find consensus on how easy or hard it is to keep, I’ve heard both.\n\nGood luck with your angelfish tank!\n\nAnd since you’re inquiring about these very large angelfish, I assume your tank will fit any of the Centropyge dwarf angels. If you get lucky, I’d go with a mated pair or harem of Flame Angels for Centropyge in a large tank.\n\nUnfortunately though, don’t want to burst your bubble man (I’d love to have an angelfish tank too lol) but maybe the safest is to have one Holocanthus and one Pomacanthus for the very large angels and have the rest of your angels be medium and small angels, either one of each species or pairs / harems.\n\nCurrently in my 650 display I have a Pomocanthus paru and Holocanthus Ciliaris. Pomocanthus annularis is finishing up QT. Plan on still adding an H. Imperator and a Blueface. So far things are going fine but as the mature we will have to see. The French is between 10-12” and Queen is about 7”. Annularis also 7”.\n\nHey there. I love angelfish and my tank would be too small for any of those angels.
