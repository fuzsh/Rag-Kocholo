        "text": "(Contains affiliate links)\n\nBoth of the Thierry Mugler classic Alien and Angel fragrances have to be some of my all-time favourites. They’ve been part of my collection for as long as I can remember. They’re both such unique scents and I can always tell when someone is wearing one of them. I’d go as far as saying they’re definitely of cult status. It’s no surprise that we often see good old classics given a seasonal twist and relaunched periodically throughout the year.\n\nIt’s definitely the time of year for all of the seasonal launches across the board. When it comes to perfume I don’t often stray away from my old favourites. I tend to find scents I love and stick with them.\n\nHowever, recently on board a Jet2 flight, a few double gins down when they announced they had a further 20% off the inflight shopping prices. Well, I don’t know if it was the gins, the pre-holiday excitement or my inability to resist a bargain but I ended up with two new fragrances to add to my collection. Maybe it was a mix of everything but as soon as I heard the word discount my inner beauty junkie went wild!\n\nThierry Mugler Angel Eau Croisière’ Eau de Toilette 50ml\n\nThe infamous star bottle of Angel has been given a summery makeover. The usual crystal blue bottle now fun and playful pink fade into yellow colour. The delicious scent is reminiscent of fruity cocktails on the beach, it smells good enough to eat. This was the perfect summer fragrance, I used it constantly on my short break in Ibiza recently. The intoxicating scent combination is a bottle of tropical paradise.\n\nI can detect a lot of mango within the scent and I absolutely love it. I’d never expected a scent like this to work but it does and oh so well. This scent won’t be for everyone as it is so sweet, fruity and tropical. It has a certain creaminess to the fragrance as it settles into the skin, I also feel the scent gets a little stronger.\n\nI don’t, unfortunately, find this to be great in terms of longevity, after a few hours I can barely smell it on my skin. Initially, it does give a great projection that lasts a good hour or two, but it seems to fade thereafter.\n\nAngel Eu Croisière Eau de Toilette belongs to the fruity oriental fragrance family:\n\nCitrus Cocktail Facet: Mango / Blackcurrant Sorbet\n\nVoluptuous Facet: Patchouli / Praline, Angel Eau De Parfum signature\n\nOne thing I noticed with this is that I couldn’t make a link between this and the original Angel scent. Despite being a limited edition version for the summer I had expected to pick up on the familiar scent tones I know and love. I was a little disappointed that it didn’t carry any detectable hints of the original Angel, that said I do think it is a gorgeous fragrance regardless. If you’re a fan of sweet and fruity fragrances, you’ll love this.\n\nThierry Mugler Alien Flora Futura Eau De Toilette 60ml\n\nThere is definitely that familiar Alien scent underlying in this fragrance, but it is subtle. A delicate and gentle scent that has been wrapped in floral notes. It is both fresh and sweet all at once but definitely not overpowering. It is the most beautiful fragrance for the warmer months.\n\nAlien Flora Futura Eau De Toilette belongs to the Floral Green Amber fragrance family and unfolds in three successive notes:\n\nEnergising Revelation: Orange\n\nRadiant Revelation: Jasmine\n\nEnveloping Revelation: White Amber\n\nThe iconic Alien Talisman bottle has been given a softer make-under to suit this lighter scent. The bottle is a stunning crystalline pink shade with gold accents. I adore the packaging of the Alien fragrance I know and love, and this is no different. Alien Flora Futura is pretty and feminine which really matches the scent encapsulated within. Bravo, Thierry Mugler, bravo.\n\nIn terms of wear, I found this to stand the wear test and I got great longevity from this. It was, of course, a lot stronger initially, once it settled it did remain strong and long-lasting. If you love floral scents this one is for you. I love that you get the hint of original Alien coming through.\n\nSo there we have it, two new summer fragrances to choose from. I love to mix my scents up depending on the time of year it is. I’ll definitely be reaching for both of these to see me through the summer months. Shop Angel here and shop Alien here.\n\nWhat is your go-to fragrance?\n\nIn keeping with the summer theme, you might also enjoy my summer beauty edit post."
