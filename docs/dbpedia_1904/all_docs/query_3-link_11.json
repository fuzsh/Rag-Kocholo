        "text": "Soprano Angel Blue’s importance in opera today cannot be overstated.\n\nOn September 23, 2019, she opened the Metropolitan Opera’s 2019-20 season as Bess in a new production of George Gershwin’s Porgy and Bess for which she earned a Grammy Award in the Best Opera Recording category. She reprised this role at the Met in Autumn 2021, which immediately followed her triumphant role debut as Destiny/Loneliness/Greta in the Met’s historic 21/22 season opener of Fire Shut Up In My Bones, the first production at the Metropolitan Opera by a Black composer. Additionally, she was the 2020 recipient of the Met’s prestigious Beverly Sills Award – the first African American artist to receive this honor – and she was the 2022 Richard Tucker Foundation Awardee. She has been praised for performances in nearly every major opera house in the world, including Teatro alla Scala, Covent Garden, the Vienna State Opera, Semperoper Dresden, San Francisco Opera, Seattle Opera, Theater an der Wien, Oper Frankfurt, and San Diego Opera.\n\nThe 2022-23 season is a display of Angel’s immense versatility and virtuosity on operatic and concert stages internationally. Blue opens Houston Grand Opera’s season with her house debut as Violetta in Verdi’s La Traviata, in a production co-starring tenor Bryan Hymel, conducted by Matthew Aucoin; she sings Violetta later in the spring of 2023 at The Metropolitan Opera. The California native returns to longtime collaborator LA Opera performing the titular role in Puccini’s Tosca, and she reprises this role at Santa Fe Opera in early summer 2023. Blue travels to Detroit for a special one-night-only performance of Aida in Concert at the Detroit Opera, which will be Blue’s debut in the title role. Blue appears with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Lyniv, singing Samuel Barber’s beloved Knoxville: Summer of 1915 along with selections from Fire Shut Up in My Bones. In spring 2023, Angel appears as Aida at the Royal Opera House.\n\nAngel Blue was born and raised in California and completed her musical studies at UCLA. She was a member of the Young Artists Program at the Los Angeles Opera, after which she moved to Europe to begin her international career."
