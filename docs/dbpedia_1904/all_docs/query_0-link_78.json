        "text": "Unlike most temp tattoos, Inkbox works by sinking into your skin and doesn’t just stick on top. Our tattoos are painless and super easy to apply - there are only a few steps involved! Once applied the ink reacts with the proteins and keratin in your skin, and darkens over 24-36 hours. For more on catalog designs, click here. To see how the Freehand Tattoo Marker works, click here.\n\nOur tattoos can last up to 10 days. How long it lasts is highly dependent on where you apply your tattoo, your daily activities and skin’s moisture. Our ink gradually fades away as your skin naturally regenerates.\n\nWant to remove it sooner? Lightly scrub your skin with an exfoliant (like warm saltwater or a body scrub). Be gentle with your skin - it may take a few tries to remove the ink entirely.\n\nOn the tattoo applicator, you’ll notice the ink is a light blue shade. This is how the tattoo will look when first applied to your skin - but don’t worry! Over 24-36 hours, your tattoo will darken into a tattoo-like shade - it’s all part of the Inkbox magic! For more on how our ink develops, click here.\n\nYes, our For Now Ink™ formula has been tested for product safety to ensure it meets cosmetic regulatory requirements. Our tattoos are clinically tested. Check out a full list of ingredients here.\n\nIf you’re worried about skin allergies or you’re experiencing discomfort post-application, please send us an email at hi@getinkbox.com!\n\nOur tattoos come in the following canvas sizes: 1x1”, 2x2\", 3x3\", 4x4\", 5x2”, 7x2\", 6x3\", 6.5x6.5\", and 5.5x9\". Please note that the usable design space for the tattoo design is roughly 0.25” smaller than the canvas itself. More information on this can be found here.\n\nOur For Now Ink™ has a shelf life of 9 months and should be stored in a cool, dry location.\n\nOur Freehand Tattoo Markers have a shelf life of 30 months and a 3 month PAO (Period After Opening). This means the product should be used within 3 months after opening. Make sure to always keep the cap on, keep the marker horizontal, and store at room temperature out of direct sunlight.\n\nWe ship to most international locations!
