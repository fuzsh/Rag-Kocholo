        "text": "Incandescent American soprano Angel Blue has performed, to date, in more than 35 countries with companies including the Vienna State Opera, Semperoper Dresden, San Francisco Opera, Frankfurt Opera, the Aix-en-Provence Festival, La Scala (where she was the first black singer to portray Violetta), and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Her most recent triumph was headlining the Metropolitan Opera’s 2019/20 season-opener, Porgy and Bess. The Gershwin classic was seen in theaters all around the world as part of the Metropolitan Opera’s “Live in HD,” and was also featured on PBS’s “Great Performances.” Over the course of her career, Ms. Blue has earned enthusiastic acclaim in numerous roles, including the title role of Tosca, Violetta in La traviata, Liù in Turandot, Marguerite in Gounod’s Faust, Elena in Boito’s Mefistofele, Giulietta in Les Contes d’Hoffmann, Micaëla in Carmen, and both Clara and Bess in Porgy and Bess. She is perhaps most popularly associated with Puccini’s La bohème, making her U.S. debut with LA Opera as Musetta, and going on to make her La Scala debut in the same role. Since singing her first Mimì at English National Opera in 2014, the doomed heroine has become her signature role with performances at Vienna State Opera, the Canadian Opera Company, Hamburg State Opera, the Semperoper Dresden, and at the Met. American audiences will have the opportunity to experience her as Mimì in upcoming productions with Seattle Opera, San Diego Opera, Metropolitan Opera, and Washington National Opera. International engagements in 2020 include Violetta at La Scala and the title role in Tosca at Semperoper Dresden."
