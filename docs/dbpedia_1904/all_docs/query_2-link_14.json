You will find all of the currently valid Basic Award Criteria in alphabetic and numeric order in the list below. Click on the title of the product group or service to download the relevant Basic Award Criteria and its annexes. If your company complies with the criteria, you can submit an application to RAL gGmbH for the award of the Blue Angel for the relevant product or service.\n\nNo results found.\n\nSanitary Paper\n\nEdition 2022 | Valid until 31.12.2026\n\nThe use of recycled paper instead of paper made from virgin fibres not only conserves our forests but also protects the climate and helps to reduce waste. The Blue Angel promotes the use of 100% recovered paper in its criteria for sanitary paper. Sanitary paper cannot be recycled and the valuable fibres are thrown away or flushed into the sewers. Therefore, it makes sense to use recovered paper sourced from ordinary, medium and kraft paper grades that are primarily recovered from household collections. The Blue Angel restricts the addition of critical production aids and paper refining agents in its criteria for the production of paper in order to, on the one hand, minimise the pollution of waste water and, on the other hand, reduce the pollutant load in the paper. For example, the use of optical brighteners, halogenated bleaching agents and not readily biodegradable complexing agents is prohibited during the production of the recycled paper. In addition, the Blue Angel also sets requirements for the emissions to waste water and air, the generation of waste and energy consumption during the production of sanitary paper.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\nlow use of energy and water in the manufacturing process\n\nmade from 100 % waste paper\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\nEnvironmentally Acceptable Pipe Cleaners (new)\n\nEdition 2024 | Valid until 31.12.2028\n\nEffective pipe cleaning without the use of chemicals\n\nIt is true that often chemical pipe cleaning agents can be more easily used but, unfortunately, they mainly consists of strong alkalis and salts which contribute to the salinization of our water bodies and may even form irritant gases. Traditional mechanical pipe cleaners do without such aggressive chemicals and work equally well.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\ncleans without chemicals\n\nNote about this criteria\n\nThere is an older edition of this Basic Award Criteria.\n\nEnvironmentally Acceptable Pipe Cleaners (until 12/2024)\n\nEdition 2005 | Valid until 31.12.2024\n\nEffective pipe cleaning without the use of chemicals\n\nIt is true that often chemical pipe cleaning agents can be more easily used but, unfortunately, they mainly consists of strong alkalis and salts which contribute to the salinization of our water bodies and may even form irritant gases. Traditional mechanical pipe cleaners do without such aggressive chemicals and work equally well.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\ncleans without chemicals\n\nNew Basic Award Criteria\n\nPlease note that there is a newer edition.\n\nNon-Toxic Pest Control and Prevention\n\nEdition 2017 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nFewer pests combined with better health\n\nPests – like cockroaches, moths or bugs – in the house need to be removed. A spray will quickly solve the problem. Unfortunately, many customary pest control sprays contain toxic substances and impact the indoor air quality. Traditional pest control textiles or fly strips which work by means of glue or light are a good alternative.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\nnon-toxic substances\n\nUnbleached Paper Filters for Use with Hot or Boiling Water\n\nEdition 2014 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nCoffee with milk and cream – and a clear conscience\n\nNeither bleaching processes nor a series of other critical auxiliary substances are used in the manufacture of Blue Angel-labelled filter papers. The manufacturing process must meet stringent wastewater treatment requirements. In addition, the manufacturers of such filter papers only use fibres from certified sustainably managed and semi-natural forests or plantations - under no circumstances will they use wood from tropical forests. Knowing all this makes the coffee taste much better right away.\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health\n\ncontent biodecradable\n\nwood fibres from sustainable\n\nunbleached\n\nHand Dishwashing Detergents and Hard Surface Cleaners\n\nEdition 2022 | Valid until 31.12.2026\n\nHand Dishwashing Detergents, All-Purpose Cleaners, Sanitary Cleaners, Glass Cleaners and Descalers\n\nWashing and cleaning agents are used on a daily basis for maintaining cleanliness and hygiene. Approx. 319,000 tonnes of cleaning and care agents (excluding dishwashing detergents) and around 139,000 tonnes of hand dishwashing detergents are sold each year in Germany. All of these products contain ingredients that find their way into the wastewater system and can have a negative effect on the environment and human health. If these ingredients cannot be completely retained or degraded in sewage treatment plants, they will enter into bodies of water and can be ingested there by water organisms and, in some circumstances, enriched. Furthermore, washing and cleaning agents can negatively affect human health when substances hazardous to health such as fragrance allergens and preservatives are used.\n\nIn the interests of the environment, climate and nature conservation, cleaning agents certified with the Blue Angel ecolabel should thus be produced in such a way that they have the least possible impact on the environment and human health. These products should also help to reduce any risks to the environment and human health by avoiding the use of hazardous substances, as well as helping to minimise packaging waste. Renewable raw materials that have been cultivated under sustainable conditions or which support sustainable cultivation should also be used in their production.\n\nConserving resources is also an important focus of this environmental label. Therefore, the packaging should contain information that enables consumers to not only use the product efficiently but also with the least possible impact on the environment.\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health\n\nWidespread avoidance of substances damaging to the environment and healt\n\nPromotes the sustainable cultivation of renewable raw materials\n\nReduces packaging waste\n\nDishwasher detergents\n\nEdition 2022 | Valid until 31.12.2026\n\nDishwashers and washing machines are used on almost a daily basis to wash dishes and clothes in a normal household. Dishwasher detergents and laundry detergents are now considered everyday products and around 312,000 tonnes of dishwashing detergent are sold each year, of which about 173,000 tonnes is accounted for by dishwasher detergent. Their ingredients can find their way into the wastewater system via the washing or rinsing water and pollute bodies of water later on if these ingredients cannot be completely retained or degraded in sewage treatment plants. In addition, detergents and cleaning agents can contain substances relevant to health e.g. certain preservatives or allergenic fragrances. The Blue Angel either prohibits the use of these substances in the first place or, if there is no other alternative, reduces their use to a minimum.\n\nAn important component of detergents are surfactants. These can be manufactured based on petrochemicals and/or renewable raw materials. The use of sustainably produced raw materials makes a significant contribution here to sustainable development. Detergents certified with the Blue Angel ecolabel should thus make a contribution to the protection of the environment by using renewable raw materials in their production that have been cultivated as far as possible under sustainable conditions or which support sustainable cultivation.\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health\n\nWidespread avoidance of substances damaging to the environment and health\n\nPromotes the sustainable cultivation of renewable raw materials\n\nReduces packaging waste\n\nLaundry detergent\n\nEdition 2022 | Valid until 31.12.2026\n\nWashing and cleaning agents are used on a daily basis for maintaining cleanliness and hygiene. Approx. 1.5 million tonnes of these washing, cleaning and care agents are sold each year, whereby laundry detergents account for around 604,000 tonnes.\n\nTheir ingredients can find their way into the wastewater system via the washing or rinsing water and pollute bodies of water later on if these ingredients cannot be completely retained or degraded in sewage treatment plants. In addition, laundry detergents and cleaning agents can contain substances relevant to health e.g. certain preservatives or allergenic fragrances. The Blue Angel either prohibits the use of these substances in the first place or, if there is no other alternative, reduces their use to a minimum.\n\nAn important component of detergents are surfactants. These can be manufactured based on petrochemicals and/or renewable raw materials. The use of sustainably produced raw materials makes a significant contribution here to sustainable development. Detergents certified with the Blue Angel ecolabel should thus make a contribution to the protection of the environment by using renewable raw materials in their production that have been cultivated as far as possible under sustainable conditions or which support sustainable cultivation.\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health\n\nMaximum avoidance of substances harmful to health and environment\n\nPromotion of sustainable production of renewable raw materials\n\nReduction of packaging waste\n\nShampoos, shower gels and soaps and other so-called rinse-off cosmetic products\n\nEdition 2020 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health\n\nlow impact on bodies of water\n\nrequirements for renewable raw materials\n\nlimits on packaging waste\n\nNappies, feminine hygiene and incontinence products (absorbent hygiene products, AHP)\n\nEdition 2021 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nAround ten million nappies are used and then thrown away every day in Germany. In addition, there are approximately 46,100 tonnes of feminine hygiene products sold every year1. Around 5 million people are affected by incontinence in Germany. In outpatient care alone, statutory health and nursing care insurance providers use about 4.9 million incontinence products every day2. Not only are a large amount of raw materials used in their production but they also produce a lot of waste: According to projections based on these figures, 154,680 tonnes of waste nappies are produced annually.\n\nIn addition, the wearing of absorbent hygiene products means that these products are in regular contact with the skin or mucous membranes and thus even the smallest quantities of chemicals harmful to health could have a negative impact. Furthermore, the use of lotions and fragrances is prohibited in those products awarded with the environmental label to avoid the risk of allergies.\n\nAnother main focus is placed on the origins and production processes for the fluff pulp. The fluff pulp must be exclusively sourced from certified, sustainably operated businesses that remain close to nature (e.g. FSC, PEFC) and engage in energy efficient and low emission fluff pulp production. In the case of other biogenic raw materials that may be used in the products, only certified biomass is approved. One example is the requirement for 100% organic cotton.\n\nIn an application test, the products must also achieve a minimum level of satisfaction with respect to their fitness for use and quality from 80% of the test subjects.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\ntested for harmful substances and free from cosmetic additives\n\n100% pulp from sustainable forestry\n\nhigh usability\n\nVacuum Cleaner Bags\n\nEdition 2019 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nVacuum cleaner bags are a widely distributed product used in almost all households. It is estimated that around 140 million vacuum cleaner bags are used every year in Germany. Vacuum cleaner bags are a product that cannot be disposed of as either recyclable waste (dual system) or – due to their non-biodegradable content – as organic waste. Vacuum cleaner bags must be disposed of as residual waste and are thus only subjected to thermal processing. The raw materials used to produce the bags are lost as a result. Therefore, the use of high-quality primary materials for this product group should be avoided – as far as this is technically possible.\n\nIn order to reduce the consumption of resources for vacuum cleaner bags, the Blue Angel thus requires that they are produced using a high proportion of recycled materials. In addition, it places requirements on the bag's good fitness for use to ensure that this single-use product has a long service life and also to improve the technical service life of the vacuum cleaner. For this purpose, the Blue Angel places requirements on the bag's capacity to retain dust particles and its strength. A bag with a high capacity to retain dust particles but with a low strength can break at an early stage and thus even damage the motor inside the appliance.\n\nTo round off the requirements for overall environmental performance, the Blue Angel also focuses on the secondary packaging of the products. For vacuum cleaner bags, this packaging must only be made out of paper or cardboard containing at least 90% recycled materials. Packaging made of plastic or other materials is not necessary for vacuum cleaner bags.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\nat least 60 % recycled materials\n\ngood fitness for use\n\nhigh retention of dust particles\n\nLow-Emission Furniture and Slatted Frames made of Wood and Wood-Based Material\n\nEdition 2022 | Valid until 31.12.2026\n\nWood for a good indoor climate\n\nProducts made of wood or wood-based materials, such as furniture or slated frames, may cause an environmental impact during their production, use and disposal.\n\nThe Blue Angel eco-label considers the whole life cycle of a product and promotes, above all, the use of wood from sustainably managed forests and of low-emission wood-based materials.\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health\n\nlow emissions\n\nwood from sustainable forestry\n\nLow Emission Upholstered Furniture\n\nEdition 2018 | Valid until 31.12.2026\n\nHealthy Living with the Blue Angel\n\nA living room without upholstery, unthinkable.\n\nSome upholstered furniture can be significant sources of pollutants in indoor environments because of their large surfaces and their long service lives.\n\nPollutants that may adversely affect the environment and human health usually come from glues, upholstery materials, cover fabrics, or the leather. The Blue Angel for low-emission upholstery indicates that - starting from its production through its entire service life to its recycling and disposal - the piece of furniture causes less impact on environment and health than comparable products without the Blue Angel eco-label.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\nlow emissions\n\nlow pollutant content\n\nMattresses\n\nEdition 2018 | Valid until 31.12.2026\n\nWhy is it that pollutant-tested mattresses are so important?\n\nWe sleep seven hours per day on the average. There is just a piece of cloth between us and the mattress and that is why we are freely exposed to chemical emissions. Such emissions may cause numerous health problems and damage the environment. Formaldehyde, for example, may cause allergies or even cancer. In addition, emissions may produce unpleasant odours which may interfere with healthy sleep and, thus, have a negative impact on our well-being. Blue Angel-labelled products are particularly low in emissions. Thus, they contribute to environmental protection even while sleeping.\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health\n\nlow emissions\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\nLeather\n\nEdition 2015 | Valid until 31.12.2027\n\nBlue Angel for Leathers\n\nLeathers can be a significant source of indoor air pollution because of their large surfaces and their long service lives. Pollutants that may affect our health and environment usually originate from leather tanning and preservation processes. The Blue Angel eco-label for low-emission upholstery leather signals to the consumer that leathers bearing the Blue Angel have been manufactured with the aim of minimizing their impact on health and environment during manufacture, the entire useful life as well as during recycling and disposal. The new Blue Angel eco-label enables the manufacturer of upholstery furniture as well as the upholstery craftsman to deliberately choose Blue Angel-ecolabelled low-emission upholstery leathers for their products and, thus, offer upholstery furniture to the consumer that does not pose a risk to their health.\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health\n\nlow emissions\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\nenvironmentally friendly production\n\nTextiles\n\nEdition 2023 | Valid until 31.12.2027\n\nGreen clothes - more than a fig leaf\n\nThere are many textile standards on paper - but on most products they are missing. And not all label guarantee environmentally friendly standards for the entire production chain. Many consumers are overwhelmed by the sheer number of labels. They don´t know which labels they should consider. To be of practical use in every day´s life, a label must be well known and trustworthy. The aim of the Blue Angel is to provide a reliable guidance for sustainable textiles.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\nenvironmentally friendly production\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\ndurable\n\nShoes\n\nEdition 2018 | Valid until 31.12.2027\n\nNo more tiptoeing around - a decision your feet can support\n\nShoes are important consumer products - every German consumer buys an average of 4-5 pairs per year. But what many consumers do not bear in mind: the manufacturing of the shoes includes several environmental relevant processes from tanning of the leather to finishing the final product. The aim of the eco label is to define high standards throughout the production chain protecting the environment and health. With the Blue Angel it will be easier to recognize good shoes in the future.\n\nBenefits to the environment and health\n\ntested for pollutants\n\nenvironmentally friendly production\n\nsocial criteria in the raw materials extraction and end production\n\nToys\n\nEdition 2017 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nConsumers place high demands on toys, i.e. they want them to be free from hazardous substances. That is why the criteria place a strong focus on avoidance and minimization of harmful substances as well as on the verification of compliance by periodic tests. The Blue Angel eco-label goes beyond the requirements of the European Directive on the Safety of Toys and bans further substances that pose a risk to the environment. These present Basic Criteria for Award of the Blue Angel require compliance with fundamental social standards in the production of raw materials as well as at the final production sites. Moreover, greater transparency on the part of the toy manufacturers regarding their suppliers shall guarantee, in the future, compliance with key labour standards also at other levels of the value chain.\n\nThe Blue Angel eco-label may be awarded to toys made of textiles, wood, plastic, leather, paper, natural rubber and metal.\n\nBenefits to the Health and Environment\n\ntested for pollutants\n\nsafety tested\n\nsocial aspects of raw materials extraction and end production\n\nFoam and water fire extinguishers\n\nEdition 2023 | Valid until 31.12.2028\n\nWhether in the home or in the office, fire extinguishers perform not only their vital function in fire protection but also an important task in environmental protection: extinguishing incipient fires prevents the emission of numerous toxic combustion products into the environment. When selecting fire extinguishers, it is therefore all the more important to look for products that contain extinguishing agents that are as low in pollutants and as environmentally friendly as possible. Foam and water fire extinguishers that have been awarded the BLUE ANGEL therefore do not use persistent per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) as additives to the extinguishing agent and only contain surfactants that are classified as readily biodegradable according to standard OECD tests. This way, consumers can contribute to preventing the accumulation of persistent PFAS in living organisms and the environment as well as long-term damage to water bodies caused by emitted extinguishing agents.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\ndoes not contain any PFAS or other fluorinated organic compounds\n\ncontains only readily biodegradable detergents\n\nminimized hazard to the environment\n\nComputer and Keyboards (until 12/2025)\n\nEdition 2017 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nHow can computers pay off for environment and health?Today, the use of computers is part of our daily lives - both in private and professional life: The great majority of German workplaces is equipped with a computer. This makes it all the more important that computers and keyboards meet all demands of modern office work, are environmentally friendly and have no adverse effects on users’ health.\n\nThe manufacture of computers, notebooks and keyboards does not only require a great amount of energy but also plenty of resources the production of which is associated with significant environmental impacts. The resources are usually very scarce materials, such as rare earth elements, gold, indium, cobalt or tantalum. They are extremely important for modern technologies but their availability is not guaranteed. With a view to a resource-efficient economy the aim is to allow long-time use of computers in order to derive the greatest possible benefit from the resources used once. Blue Angel eco-labelled computers meet this requirement because they are, for example, repairable and upgradable.\n\nAlso, Blue Angel eco-labelled computers and keyboards meet stringent requirements for recyclable design and material selection, thus creating favourable framework conditions for an efficient recovery of the materials used and helping to conserve natural resources.\n\nTo protect users' health, the plastic parts of the devices are exclusively made of particularly low-emission materials.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\nlow energy consumption\n\ndurable\n\nrecyclable design\n\nNew Basic Award Criteria\n\nPlease note that there is a newer edition.\n\nComputer, Keyboards and Mice (new)\n\nEdition 2024 | Valid until 31.12.2028\n\nHow can computers pay off for environment and health?Today, the use of computers is part of our daily lives - both in private and professional life: The great majority of German workplaces is equipped with a computer.

They have become a matter of course for most of us to make calls, send emails, surf the Internet or take photos wherever we are.\n\nThe Blue Angel criteria are a perfect help when buying one of these new mobile devices if social standards and the conservation of resources are of importance. A number of requirements have been included to ensure the longevity of the devices. The battery, for example, must meet particularly high-quality standards and, of course, it must be replaceable by the user without expert knowledge being required. Spare parts must be available for components that typically break down (above all, battery, front glass and display). A key reason why people are often reluctant to give or sell their mobile device for second-hand use are their personal data stored on the device; here, the requirement for Blue Angel eco-labelled devices is that the user himself/herself must be able to easily and securely delete these data. For precautionary health protection, the devices must demonstrably not exceed limit values for electromagnetic radiation and only have pollutant levels reduced to a minimum.\n\nA mobile phone, smartphone or tablet has to travel a long way until it finally reaches the consumer. That is why the Basic Criteria for the Blue Angel also include requirements for the origin of raw materials, i.e. the so-called conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold) as well as for the conditions of production. Compliance with fundamental social standards at the manufacturing plants will be monitored on site by independent third parties.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\ndurable\n\nlow radiation\n\nConsideration of social aspects of raw materials extraction and end production\n\nSolar-Powered Products\n\nEdition 2012 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nUsing the sun to generate electric power\n\nSolar technology is an important solution for securing future energy supplies. Solar cells can be intelligently integrated into products to reduce the use of standard batteries or make access to the electricity grid unnecessary. The electrical power generated by the solar cells can be stored in rechargeable batteries so that the products work with a sufficient degree of reliability. This environmental label covers products for indoor and outdoor use such as milk frothers, wall clocks, alarm clocks, house number lighting, lights and fences.\n\nBenefits to health and environment\n\nenergy efficient\n\nrenewable energie\n\nbaby monitors\n\nEdition 2018 | Valid until 31.12.2024\n\nMaximum protection for small children\n\nBaby monitors provide parents with valuable assistance in the first months of a baby's life – because they can save lives! And they can also make everyday life for mothers and fathers easier in subsequent years. The main focus should always be placed on the safety of babies and children and providing the highest possible protection against radiation should already be taken into account when purchasing these devices. Baby monitors with the Blue Angel have particularly low emissions and ensure parents have peace-of-mind while their small one sleeps safely and calmly in their cot.\n\nBenefits for the environment and health:\n\nlow exposure to radiation\n\navoidance of environmentally damaging materials\n\nDigital cordless phone\n\nEdition 2020 | Valid until 31.12.2027\n\nCordless phones are gaining in popularity with today’s consumers – they can be found in many homes and offices. It is so convenient to make a „cordless call“ but still use the landline. However, with these phones another source of electromagnetic radiation enters your home or office. One major objective of the Blue Angel eco-label is a preventive limitation of this radiation. And, of course, we also want the Blue Angel to contribute to climate protection. Even though the saving in electrical power consumption is only a few watts for a single device the number of devices is what makes the difference – resulting in a significant economic impact.\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health\n\nlow energy consumption\n\nlow radiation\n\nRouter\n\nEdition 2018 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nEnergy-efficient and Durable Routers\n\nSurfing the Net with the Blue Angel\n\nIt is almost impossible to imagine life without the Internet nowadays. 88 percent of all private households in Germany have access to the Internet. To this end they need networking equipment that is usually on around the clock.\n\nThe Blue Angel eco-label may be awarded to particularly energy-efficient routers that automatically switch to “Idle” state when not in use. Unused interfaces are automatically disabled or can be fully turned off by the user in order to reduce energy consumption.\n\nTo ensure the longest possible service life for the devices Blue Angel eco-labelled routers can rely on guaranteed software updates and repair services. Easy data deletion and product take-back offered by the manufacturer allow the reuse of the router when the device is no longer needed in the household.\n\nAnd when the router is finally recycled the design optimised for recycling makes sure that 90 percent of the plastics and metals used in the housing parts can be recycled.\n\nBenefits to the Environment and health\n\nlow energy consumption\n\ndurable\n\nData Shredders\n\nEdition 2018 | Valid until 31.12.2026\n\nData shredders, as, for example, file shredders, are used to destroy confidential documents that are no longer needed by shredding them into pieces. A lot of shredders do not just shred paper but also other data carriers, such as CDs / DVDs or credit cards and, thus, protect them from data misuse. The maximum power of data shredders for personal and small office use is between 130 and 700 watts. The maximum power of appliances for open-plan offices or office floors is between about 700 and 2600 watts. The greater part of the annual power consumed by inefficient data shredders (90 to 97 %) is not consumed in the actual operating mode (paper shredding) but in “standby” and “off” mode. The Blue Angel eco-label for data shredders may be awarded to appliances featuring low power consumption, long-lived design and avoidance of environmentally harmful materials.\n\nEnvironmental and Health Benefits\n\nenergy saving\n\ndurable\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\nHair Dryers\n\nEdition 2019 | Valid until 31.12.2027\n\nHair care appliances are basic items that can be found in most German households. The power consumption of a hair dryer is between 960 and 2300 watts. The annual power consumption of an average hair dryer is 65 kWh if used every day. This is about as much as the consumption of, for example, an iron or an efficient cooling device. Blue Angel eco-labelled hair care appliances achieve power savings of at least 30 percent compared to standard appliances. In addition, Blue Angel eco-labelled hair care appliances meet requirements for noise emission, the plastics and materials used as well as for product safety and durability. Moreover, the Operating Instructions include information on environmentally conscious user behaviour and product safety.\n\nBenefits to the environment and health\n\nhigh energy efficiency\n\nlow noise emissions\n\nextended warranty period\n\nRemanufactured toner cartridges and ink cartridges for printers, copiers and multifunction devices\n\nEdition 2021 | Valid until 31.12.2026\n\nGreat benefit, less waste\n\nBlue Angel eco-labelled toner modules help to reduce the amount of waste and, thus, to conserve resources. These toner modules must also meet stringent requirements for the materials used, the monochrome or colour toners as well as for serviceability properties. Last but not least, the Blue Angel eco-labelled remanufactured toner modules made available to interested suppliers and users must - in combination with low-emission office equipment according to DE-UZ 171 or DE-UZ 205 - meet the stringent requirements for the release of fine and ultrafine particles during printing.\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health\n\nreconditioned\n\nlow emissions\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\nVakuum Cleaners\n\nEdition 2020 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nEnvironmentally friendly suction power\n\nThere are currently around 39 million vacuum cleaners in German households, which consume around 3.4 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year in total. The electricity costs during an 8-year service life are often higher than the purchase price.\n\nThe environmental label for vacuum cleaners may be awarded to appliances with low energy consumption and a high dust pick up, as well as low dust re-emissions. They must have a recyclable design and low noise emissions. These appliances also avoid the use of environmentally damaging materials. A special focus is placed on durability and ease-of-repair.\n\nIn the case of corded vacuum cleaners, the environmental label requires that the motor has a service life of at least 600 hours, the active floor nozzle has a service life of at least 300 hours, the passive universal nozzle can withstand 1200 falls from a height of 80 cm, the appliance can withstand 500 impacts with thresholds and door posts and the suction hose can withstand at least 40,000 deformations. In the case of cordless vacuum cleaners, the run time must be at least 75% of the initial run time after 600 charging cycles and the battery must be removeable. These requirements also send a clear signal to manufacturers to increase the service life and improve the easy-to-repair design of their products and help to avoid waste as a result.\n\nBenefits to health and environment\n\nrecyclable and easy-to-repair design\n\nhigh dust retention\n\nlow energy consumption\n\nGarden tools (new)\n\nEdition 2024 | Valid until 31.12.2027\n\nIn areas worthy of protection, as well as in private gardens, many people consider noise generated by garden tools to be significant noise pollution.

Their manufacture requires the use of a variety of raw materials that are sourced in a complex and often environmentally damaging way. That is why, from the environmental point of view, the focus should be on a long useful life of the devices. This can be achieved if at the end of their initial use mobile phones are reused. To this end, they need to be carefully collected and treated beforehand.\n\nThe objectives of this eco-label are avoidance of waste and preservation of natural resources. The Blue Angel allows consumers or public authorities to spot take-back schemes for mobile phones whose primary objective is to prepare the devices for reuse. Second life use of the devices helps not only to save resources and energy but also to avoid waste.\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health:\n\nparticularly easy handover\n\ncareful receipt of the devices\n\nthorough inspection for reusability\n\nServer and Data Storage Products\n\nEdition 2020 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nThe demand for the central processing and storing of data has increased continuously for many years and has been strengthened by new business processes dealing with digitalisation and the increasing networking of products. This trend is also reflected in the sales figures. According to data from the market research institute IDC, global revenue from the sale of servers doubled between 2009 and 2019 from 10 billion to 20 billion US dollars1. The constant increase in the global volume of data has an impact on the sales figures for data storage products. The storage capacity at cloud data centers is thus expected to increase by 29 percent annually between 2018 and 2023.2 It is anticipated that the importance of servers and data storage products will continue to increase substantially over the next few years.\n\nWhen analysing servers and data storage products as a whole, it is clear that most of the greenhouse gas emissions occur during the use of these products. The usage phase for servers accounts for around 80% of the total greenhouse gas emissions, while this figure is around 90% for data storage products. In order to comprehensively evaluate the environmental burden caused by servers and data storage products, however, it is also important to focus on the consumption of raw materials. The situation is reversed in this area because more than 70% of the abiotic raw materials are consumed during production of the servers.\n\n1 IDC: Worldwide Server Tracker, https://www.idc.com/tracker/showproductinfo.jsp?prod_id=7\n\n2 Hülskötter, Michael (2019): Multi-Cloud-Bewegung wird den Storage-Markt verändern. Published by the magazine “speicherguide”. Available online at https://www.speicherguide.de/cloud/multi-cloud-bewegung-wird-den- storage-markt-veraendern-24337.aspx\n\nIn the case of data storage products, the production process accounts for around 60% of the abiotic raw materials consumed.\n\nAgainst this background, the aim of the Blue Angel is to reduce the overall energy consumption by servers and data storage products and improve resource efficiency. The impact on the environment can be significantly reduced by developing suitable and ambitious criteria for servers and data storage products. Saving energy in the operation of servers and data storage products pays off twice in the data center: On the one hand, there are the direct energy savings achieved by the devices themselves and, on the other hand, there is a reduced demand for cooling.\n\nThe Blue Angel environmental label for Servers and Data Storage Products sets high minimum requirements for the energy efficiency of servers, data storage products and power supply units, as well as for the elimination of pollutants in the plastic materials used in the products. In addition, the label requires the early adoption of the European Ecodesign Directive for servers and data storage products including the guidelines for energy and material efficiency, as well as compliance with the energy efficiency criteria and documentation obligations in the “Energy Star” label. The Blue Angel can thus be used to label devices that stand out due to their high energy efficiency, long service life and avoidance of environmentally polluting materials.\n\nBenefits to the environment and health\n\nenergy efficient\n\nsave resources\n\nResources and Energy-Efficient Software Products\n\nEdition 2020 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nSoftware and hardware belong together like a book and its pages. One makes no sense without the other. A computer, notebook and even a smartphone can only be as energy efficient as the software allows. Although it is the hardware that consumes energy, it is the software that triggers the consumption of this energy. The design of the software and its programming also have an influence on the hardware specifications and are thus also responsible for the replacement of supposedly less powerful hardware.\n\nThe European Ecodesign Directive defines requirements for the environmentally friendly design of energy-related products and sets minimum requirements. Most of the products that come under the scope of the Ecodesign Directive are controlled by software. There are no legal requirements for the energy efficiency of software products despite the fact that software has a major influence on energy consumption.\n\nThe aim of the environmental label for resource and energy-efficient software products is to reduce the total energy consumed by information and communication technology and improve resource efficiency. By purchasing software that has been awarded the Blue Angel, consumers and public procurers can be sure that the software uses hardware resources in a particularly efficient manner and saves energy. Due to lower performance requirements, the hardware has a longer service life. In addition, the software stands out due to its high level of transparency and grants users greater freedom in their use of the software.\n\nFurthermore, the criteria for the environmental label also provide developers of software products with useful guidance for identifying possible weaknesses in the software and taking the right measures to reduce the impact on the environment.\n\nUFOPLAN-SSD 2015 (umwelt-campus.de)\n\nBenefits to the environment and health\n\nenergy efficient\n\nsave recources\n\ntransparent interfaces\n\nOffice Equipment with Printing Function (Printers and Multifunction Devices)\n\nEdition 2021 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nLots of functions, sustainable and transparent\n\nPrinters and multifunction devices are complex devices with a diverse range of functions and are used on a daily basis in both a private and work environment. The low energy consumption of devices certified with the Blue Angel supports climate change mitigation. The contribution of electrophotographic devices to indoor pollution by ultrafine dust is small in the work place or at home and will be further reduced gradually. In addition, the devices must comply with strict requirements with respect to the selection of materials and the recyclable design of the products. The criteria for the selection of materials in the devices also stipulate that a minimum level of recycled plastic must be used. Low-pollutant materials must also be used in the plastic parts to reduce the impact on the environment and the risks to human health. Furthermore, these devices have a low energy consumption and thus make a significant contribution to climate protection. Last but not least, those companies who sell printers and multifunction devices certified with the Blue Angel are also obligated to gradually fulfil ambitious social standards during the production process and comply with due diligence requirements in the supply chains for conflict materials by 2024 at the latest.\n\nCooperation agreement between the Blue Angel Ecolabel and the Nordic Swan\n\nThe criteria of the Nordic Swan Ecolabel for \"Imaging Equipment\" are based on the criteria of the Blue Angel “Office equipment with printing function (printers and multifunctional devices) - DE-UZ 219”. The background document of the agreement is available for download here.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\nlow energy consumption\n\nlow emissions and noise\n\ndurable\n\nTelephone systems and corded voice-over-IP telephones\n\nEdition 2021 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nConvenient and energy-efficient telephone conversations over the Internet\n\nThere is a growing trend for companies to replace their analog or ISDN phone systems with voice over IP phones. They provide a greater variety of functions and save costs using existing data networks. To make sure that this plus for convenience is not accompanied by an increase in energy and material consumption the Blue Angel sets strict requirements. Blue Angel eco-labelled VoIP phones feature low electric power consumption, high compatibility with data networks, updatability and high voice quality. Spare parts supply must be guaranteed for at least 6 years, used devices can be returned to the manufacturer and the materials used are subject to strict requirements as to pollutant contents.\n\nTelephone systems transfer data between both a variety of terminals like telephones, fax machines or answering machines and also between these terminals and one or more lines on the public telephone network. As telephone systems installed for commercial use are generally operated 24 hours a day, every day of the week, reducing their energy consumption makes an important contribution to climate protection and also saves operating costs. The upgradability and updatability of the hardware and software are also decisive factors for guaranteeing the longest possible service life of the telephone system and thus helping to preserve resources.\n\nThe \"Blue Angel\" environmental label for VoIP telephones and telephone systems signals to purchasers of these systems that devices issued with this label provide greater preventative protection for the environment and the consumer than is required by statutory regulations. Therefore, the environmental label acts as a decision-making aid for purchasing new devices with the longest possible service lives.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\nlow energy consumption\n\ndurable\n\nrecyclable design\n\nData Centers\n\nEdition 2022 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nThe Blue Angel ecolabel has now been certifying data centers that are operated in a particularly energy efficient and resource-conserving manner for 10 years. The importance of data centers has certainly not diminished over the last 10 year as they provide the technical infrastructure for digital services in the private, business and public sectors – whether for network environments, platforms, data storage, cloud solutions or other services. The demand for centralised computing and storage capacity has grown significantly due to digitalisation and thus so has the demand for valuable energy resources and raw materials. This was reason enough to adapt the criteria for the award of the Blue Angel to the latest developments and changed conditions, such as the current state of technology and commonly established practices, so that they continue to provide good guidance for more environmental and climate protection in the data center sector in line with prevailing developments.\n\nThe previous environmental labels “Energy Efficient Data Center Operation” (DE-UZ-161) and “Climate Friendly Colocation Data Centers” (DE-UZ 214) have now been consolidated. The consolidated ecolabel for “Data Centers” (DE-UZ 228) will not only certify existing operator models but also those operators who manage their information technology at a colocation data center that has been awarded the Blue Angel.\n\nIn order to be awarded the Blue Angel, operators of data centers and information technology must comply with minimum requirements and this must be verified by an independent auditor (mandated by the German Environment Agency). The environmental label for “Data Centers” may be awarded to those data centers:\n\nwhose technical building equipment is operated in a particularly energy efficient, climate friendly and resource-conserving manner,\n\nwhose operators develop and successfully implement a long-term strategy for increasing the energy and resource efficiency of the data center,\n\nwhose information technology is operated efficiently,\n\nwho enable their customers to implement measures to improve energy efficiency,\n\nand who offer guaranteed minimum standards and transparent reporting to create the conditions for IT operators to operate information technology in an energy efficient manner.\n\nBenefits to the environment and health\n\nenergy efficient\n\nsave resources\n\ntransparent interfaces\n\nLow-emission and low-pollutant Varnishes\n\nEdition 2019 | Valid until 31.12.2027\n\n“Varnish is a coating substance that is thinly applied to surfaces and hardens due to chemical or physical processes. The surface is sealed and protected as a result. Enhancing the visual appearance of the surface is also part of the various different applications for varnishes. Coating indoor surfaces with varnishes and paints similar to varnish can pollute the indoor air and it is thus essential to select the right product. The Blue Angel is awarded on the basis of an evaluation of the product formulation or an emissions test. This guarantees that varnishes holding the Blue Angel are low in emissions and solvents and also have low levels of pollutants.”\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health\n\nlow in solvents\n\nlow pollutant content\n\nWallpapers and Woodchip Wall Coverings primarily made from Recycled Paper (until 12/2025)\n\nEdition 2014 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nWhy should we use wallpapers made from recycled paper?\n\nWallpapers made from waste paper help to conserve resources and avoid the environmental impacts associated with the production of pulp. Paper production is among the major energy-consuming and water-burdening economic sectors. Wood-chip wallpapers, above all, are additionally breathable und, thus, have a positive impact on the indoor air quality.\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health\n\nlow use of energy and water in the manufacturing process\n\nprimarily made from waste paper\n\nparticularly low level of harmful materials\n\nNew Basic Award Criteria\n\nPlease note that there is a newer edition.\n\nInformation for manufacturers and retailers \"The Blue Angel for wallpapers and woodchip wallpapers\"\n\nWallpapers and woodchip wall coverings made from recycled paper (new)\n\nEdition 2024 | Valid until 31.12.2029\n\nWhy should we use wallpapers made from recycled paper?\n\nThe use of recovered paper in the production of wallpapers contributes to the conservation of resources, especially ecosystems such as forests, and thus helps to protect the climate and reduce waste. The environmental pollution associated with the cellulose and pulp production is avoided. Woodchip wallpapers are also breathable and can thus improve the indoor climate.\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health\n\nmade from 100 % recovered paper\n\nlow use of energy and water in the manufacturing process\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\nBasic Award Criteria follow soon\n\nApplication documents follow soon\n\nNote about this criteria\n\nThere is an older edition of this Basic Award Criteria.\n\nLow-Emission Panel-Shaped Materials (Construction and Furnishing Panels)for Interior Construction\n\nEdition 2016 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nCan wood be injurious to human health?\n\nIn chipboards and other materials pollutants may dissolve from the binders and get into the indoor air. This may cause mucosal inflammation of eyes and ears as well as irritation of the throat, sickness, headache and breathing problems.

That is why it is important that the products have low emissions and are also not detrimental to health in other ways.\n\nIngredients in wall paints can increase the concentration of pollutants in the indoor air imperceptibly. It is therefore advisable to obtain accurate information before purchasing and applying paints.\n\nIf you would like to keep pollutants as low as possible when using wall paint and brushes, you should use products with the Blue Angel label when renovating your own four walls. Wall paints labelled with the Blue Angel ecolabel have been tested beyond the legal requirements for their ingredients and therefore for their environmental and health compatibility.\n\nWall paints with the Blue Angel ecolabel\n\nLow emissions due to strict limits for the use of volatile and semi-volatile organic substances\n\nNo biocides\n\nNo lead-containing pigments or perfluorinated and polyfluorinated chemicals\n\nFree from harmful plasticisers\n\nExclusion of carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic substances\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health\n\nlow emissions\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\nLow-Emission floor-covering adhesives | and other covering materials\n\nEdition 2019 | Valid until 31.12.2027\n\nDo adhesives have an impact on human health?\n\nFortunately, the days when floor coverings were laid by the use of solvent-containing adhesives are over. Today, we use water-dilutable adhesives which may, however, also cause health problems because solvent-free is not equal to pollutant-free. The adhesive may still contain various non- volatile organic substances. These substances gradually evaporate from the adhesive over a long period of time and make their way through the flooring and, thus, get into the air we breathe or attach themselves to the house dust. This is not the case with Blue Angel-labelled adhesives.\n\nBenefits to environment and health\n\nlow emissions\n\nlow in solvents\n\nElastic Floor Coverings\n\nEdition 2011 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nImproved home quality thanks to environmentally safe floorings?\n\nHealthy living is a trend and the Blue Angel has a clear focus when assessing the health effects of products used in indoor spaces in particular. Blue Angel-labelled elastic floor coverings emit very few pollutants to the indoor air of children’s rooms, bedrooms and other rooms and, thus, do not affect the health of the inhabitants. The floor coverings are best laid by use of adhesives also carrying the Blue Angel eco-label.\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health\n\nlow emissions\n\nlow pollutant content\n\nno adverse impact on health in the living environment\n\nLow-Emission Sealants for Interior Use\n\nEdition 2019 | Valid until 31.12.2027\n\nCan silicone sealing material be a clean product?\n\nSilicone and other joint sealing materials are high-performance construction materials protecting, for example, the bathroom from water seepage for many years. This property requires a complex mixture of chemicals, such as plasticizers or anti-mould agents. However, from the perspective of environmental protection and health the pollutant impact of such sealants on indoor areas must be low in order to guarantee the lowest possible emissions from these products.\n\nBenefits to environment and health\n\nlow emissions\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\nLow-Emission Textile Floor Coverings\n\nEdition 2016 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nBetter living with environmentally sound floorings?\n\nHealthy living is a growing trend and the Blue Angel sets a clear focus when assessing the health effects of products for indoor use. Because of their large surface floor coverings have a particularly high potential for affecting the indoor air quality. By awarding the eco-label to textile floor coverings – in addition to resilient floor coverings - the Blue Angel draws the consumer’s attention to a health-compliant alternative in this product sector. The label is awarded to textile floor coverings that outgas particularly small amounts of organic compounds and formaldehyde into the indoor air.\n\nBenefits to health and environment\n\nlow emissions and odours\n\nlow pollutant content\n\nno adverse impact on health in the living environment\n\nLow-Emission Thermal Insulation Material and Suspended Ceilings for Indoor Use\n\nEdition 2020 | Valid until 31.12.2026\n\nBlue Angel-labelled low-emission thermal insulation material and suspended ceilings.\n\nThermal insulation material and suspended ceilings are an effective way to save energy and reduce noise in indoor spaces. However, if the products are manufactured from pollutant-containing materials these measures may, in fact, harm the environment. That is why the Blue Angel eco-label may be awarded to those thermal insulation materials and suspended ceilings which beyond the legal provisions have been produced in a low-pollutant manufacturing process and pose no health hazard in indoor spaces. The Basic Award Criteria include requirements for thermal and sound insulation and define limits for emissions from the products.\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health\n\nlow emission / low emission and low odour\n\nlow pollutant content\n\nno adverse impact on health in indoor spaces\n\nExternal Thermal Insulation Composite Systems (ETICS)\n\nEdition 2019 | Valid until 31.12.2026\n\nFacade insulation is often the most effective way for consumers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to act effectively in terms of climate protection. Due to reduced heating costs, even money can be saved in the long run. By using environmentally friendly and resource-saving materials and components in External Thermal Insulation Composite Systems (ETICS) with the Blue Angel, possible health and environmental impacts can be reduced to a minimum. ETICS are robust and durable. In addition, the Blue Angel certifies good optical properties through tested resistance to growth.\n\nBenefits to the environment and health\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\nenvironmentally friendly thermal insulation\n\nfaçades without algacides and fungicides\n\nFlooring Underlays\n\nEdition 2019 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nWhat are flooring underlays made of and why should they be low-emission?\n\nFlooring underlays are products installed under laminate, parquet or carpet floorings. Their purpose is to absorb the impact sound, even out uneven subsurfaces and, by the way, combat cold feet. Flooring underlays are made of different materials, depending on the mode of application: for example, wood, paperboard, cork, rubber or various foam and non-foam plastics.\n\nThe materials are as different as are the respective environmental requirements for award of the Blue Angel. However, all flooring underlays must be low-emission because in order to guarantee a health-oriented floor structure all individual components – from adhesive to cover layer, including sealants – must be low-emission because it is an unpleasant characteristic of pollutants that they can also travel through the floorings.\n\nBenefits to the environment and health\n\nlow emissions\n\nlow pollutant content\n\nEnergy-Efficient and Water-Saving Hand-Held and Overhead Shower Heads\n\nEdition 2022 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nShowering in a Climate-Friendly Way\n\nIn Germany, the average amount of water used per person per day for personal hygiene is 44 litres which is approximately one third of the total water use. Since the water used for personal hygiene is usually hot, lower consumption will also result in lower energy consumption as well as in lower climate-harming greenhouse gas emissions. That is why shower heads with a restricted maximum flow rate of 6 to 8 litres per minute independent of the pressure are recommended in particular. They can achieve savings of 40 percent and more compared with customary products!\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\nenergy efficient\n\nlow use of water\n\nLow-Emission Floor Coverings, Panels and Doors for Interiors made of Wood and Wood-Based Materials\n\nEdition 2013 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nWood for a good indoor climate\n\nProducts made of wood or wood-based materials, such as interior floor coverings, panels and doors, may cause an environmental impact during their production, use and disposal.\n\nThe Blue Angel eco-label considers the whole life cycle of a product and promotes, above all, the use of wood from sustainably managed forests and of low-emission wood-based materials.\n\nBenefits to the Environment and Health\n\nlow emissions and pollutants\n\nwood from sustainable forestry\n\nno adverse impact on health in the living environment\n\nBiodegradable Lubricants and Hydraulic Fluids\n\nEdition 2022 | Valid until 31.12.2026\n\nLubricants are used in various applications where an entry of substances into the environment cannot be completely avoided, especially when used for loss lubrication of rails, points, block trains or for sealing purposes and similar fields of application where high lubricant losses occur during the intended use. Also, loss lubrication during wood cutting causes the release of approximately 10,000 tons of chain lubricants into the environment per year. Even during the intended use of hydraulic fluids in agriculture and forestry as well as in the building industry significant quantities may escape in an uncontrolled way into the environment due to leakages and other defects. If the lubricants include components that are toxic to humans or the environment or have insufficient biodegradability, these releases into the environment can have an adverse effect on soil and water. This negative effect should be minimized in order to preserve intact ecosystems and avoid indirect impact on human health.\n\nThe aim of the Blue Angel eco-label for biodegradable lubricants and hydraulic fluids is to enable the user to choose products that, for example, consist primarily of renewable raw materials (vegetable or animal oils) and, first and foremost, stand out due to their good biodegradability. In order to conserve resources, the plastic canisters/containers are required to contain a minimum proportion of post-consumer recycled materials (PCR).\n\nWith regard to the DE-UZ 178 Basic Criteria for \"Biodegradable Lubricants and Hydraulic Fluids\" it was decided to set up, in Appendix 1, a publicly accessible \"Lubricant Component Classification List\" based on the LuSC List of the EU Ecolabel for Lubricants. This list is meant to make application filing easier for manufacturers of lubricants since the products which will be listed in said Appendix 1 will not require the submission of further data. The manufacturers of lubricant components shall be able, from now on, to have their products evaluated with costs in accordance with DE-UZ 178 and to apply for inclusion in Appendix 1 to DE-UZ 178.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\nbiodegradable\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\nLow-Emission Internal Plasters\n\nEdition 2019 | Valid until 31.12.2027\n\nEnvironmentally friendly internal plasters\n\nInternal plasters are used to cover large surfaces indoors just like wall paints. Therefore, it is important that these products have low emissions and are also not harmful to human health in other ways. The Environmental Label Jury established new criteria for internal plasters at its meeting in December 2018. The most important new requirement is that internal plasters with the Blue Angel are no longer permitted to use preservatives containing biocidal substances. Manufacturers must provide analytical verification of compliance with this requirement. The information that must be stated on the container and the technical data sheet has been supplemented to include a note about consumers wearing protective goggles for their own protection.\n\nAs these new requirements for even safer products require far-reaching changes to the production process, the Environmental Label Jury agreed to extend the validity of the still existing Basic Award Criteria until 31/12/2020. This will give manufacturers the opportunity to change the formulations for their internal plasters over to preservative-free versions.\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health\n\nlow emissions\n\nlow pollutant content\n\nConcrete products containing recycled aggregates for outdoor flooring\n\nEdition 2021 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\nconserves resources\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\nenvironmentally friendly\n\nMechanical frame fasteners for room doors without the use of building foam\n\nEdition 2021 | Valid until 31.12.2028\n\nAvoidance of pollutants and waste: two important factors for a circular economy\n\nSeveral million frame fasteners are installed in doors every year in Germany alone. The Blue Angel for mechanical frame fasteners for room doors is awarded to products that are installed without the use of fitting foam and which can be easily removed and recycled separately when they are no longer required. This reduces any possible pollutant emissions e.g. from flame retardants in the fitting foam. The ability to remove and recycle the mechanical door frame fasteners at the end of their period of use also reduces waste. The environmental label thus promotes the concept of a circular economy.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\ncan be recycled by type\n\nreusable\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\nUnderwater coatings and other anti-fouling systems\n\nEdition 2022 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nThe submerged part of a ship will over time become overgrown with water organisms such as algae, barnacles or muscles. To prevent this from happening, an anti-fouling coating containing biocides is usually applied to the hull of the ship. The poisonous biocides are systematically released from the coating and this results in continuous pollution of the environment. There are various non-biocidal anti-fouling systems that can be used as an alternative, e.g. non-stick coatings, ultrasound systems or cleaning systems. However, some of these alternative anti-fouling systems do not provide sufficient protection and can also contain substances with properties that are harmful to the environment and health.\n\nThe aim of the new ecolabel is thus to certify those non-biocidal anti-fouling systems that are both effective and also environmentally friendly. In combination with an obligation to provide information on the safe and correct use of the product, the ecolabel guarantees that end consumers receive an effective and environmentally friendly product.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\neffective anti-fouling protection\n\nwater friendly\n\nRoof and Sealing Sheets\n\nEdition 2022 | Valid until 31.12.2026\n\nWater-friendly roof sheets support the shaping of climate-resilient cities\n\nThe use and infiltration of discharged water from roofs contribute to climate adaptation in urban areas. Blue Angel roof sheets are ecotoxicologically uncritical in contact with rainwater and minimise pollutant loads into the discharged water from roofs making them compatible with a wide range of uses for such water. The Blue Angel for roof sheets is awarded to products that have harmless formulations, are manufactured in a resource-conserving manner using at least 50 % green electricity and meet strict criteria for ecotoxicological effects in leaching tests. In order to create transparency, a minimum service life of the product is specified in the processing instructions or consumer information to be supplied.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\nwater friendly\n\nsave resources\n\nFacade Paints\n\nEdition 2022 | Valid until 31.12.2026\n\nExterior paints on facades are used as large-surface coating materials in the design of buildings and for their protection. Biocides are often used in coating systems designed for exterior areas to protect against algal and fungal growth. These biocides do not prevent this algal or fungal growth on the building façade but merely delay it and are washed out of the paint over time. The environmental label is designed for the labelling of products without a protective biocidal film that are low in pollutants. It is based on the Basic Award Criteria for external thermal insulation composite systems. By using low-pollutant façade paints with the Blue Angel ecolabel, you can reduce any possible environmental pollution to a minimum.\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health\n\nwithout biocide film protection\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\nRoofing tiles and fittings\n\nEdition 2023 | Valid until 31.12.2026\n\nGreenhouse gas neutral roofing tiles and fittings conserve resources and protect the climate\n\nRoofing tiles and fittings (in short: roofing tiles) are installed over large areas and come into contact with rain water. It is important to minimise the release of pollutants from these products during their use in order to reduce their environmental impact within the natural water cycle. Therefore, all roofing tiles certified with the Blue Angel ecolabel must verify that they are safe for the environment from an ecotoxicological perspective. Due to the high number of roofing tiles used every year in both new buildings and renovation projects, it is also important that the products are manufactured using climate friendly solutions. The Blue Angel requires the use of solutions that comply with a strict life cycle assessment benchmark for greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, roofing tiles certified with the Blue Angel are obligated to offset their non-avoidable and non-reducible greenhouse gas emissions. The methods used to offset these emissions are subject to strict rules to ensure that they demonstrably help to mitigate climate change over the long term.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\nwater friendly\n\nsave resources\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\nHeat pumps\n\nEdition 2023 | Valid until 31.12.2027\n\nThe heat pump is a key technology for moving away from fossil fuel heating systems and is used not only for space heating but also for producing hot water. The use of regenerative heat sources (e.g. water, geothermal energy and air) saves fossil fuels. Nevertheless, there is still considerable potential for reducing the environmental impact of heat pumps. The Blue Angel requirements are therefore designed in a way that combines the absence of fluorinated refrigerants with energy-efficient operation of the heat pumps to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the formation of long-lasting degradation products of refrigerants (PFAS) is avoided and noise emissions are limited.\n\nBenefits to the environment and health\n\nclimate friendly natural refrigerants\n\nenergy efficient\n\nlow noise\n\nChillers\n\nEdition 2023 | Valid until 31.12.2027\n\nChillers are refrigerating machines that extract heat from the medium to be cooled via a water circuit. They are used in a wide range of cooling applications in the commercial and industrial sectors, but also for air conditioning in residential and especially non-residential buildings. They contribute to climate change in two ways: firstly, by requiring electrical energy and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy conversion (indirect emissions), and secondly, through the direct emissions of refrigerants, which often have a very high global warming potential (GWP). Direct emissions are caused by leaks during operation, maintenance and repairs as well as disposal. Against this background, greenhouse gas emission savings can be realised by using environmentally friendly and energy-efficient chillers. Starting points here are in particular the use of natural refrigerants and increasing the efficiency of the machines. The aim of this ecolabel is to be able to identify products that work with natural refrigerants and are characterised - beyond the legal requirements - by additional environmentally friendly properties. These are, in particular, high energy efficiency and low noise emissions.\n\nBenefits to the environment and health\n\nclimate friendly natural refrigerants\n\nenergy efficient\n\nlow noise\n\nFoam and water fire extinguishers\n\nEdition 2023 | Valid until 31.12.2028\n\nWhether in the home or in the office, fire extinguishers perform not only their vital function in fire protection but also an important task in environmental protection: extinguishing incipient fires prevents the emission of numerous toxic combustion products into the environment. When selecting fire extinguishers, it is therefore all the more important to look for products that contain extinguishing agents that are as low in pollutants and as environmentally friendly as possible. Foam and water fire extinguishers that have been awarded the BLUE ANGEL therefore do not use persistent per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) as additives to the extinguishing agent and only contain surfactants that are classified as readily biodegradable according to standard OECD tests. This way, consumers can contribute to preventing the accumulation of persistent PFAS in living organisms and the environment as well as long-term damage to water bodies caused by emitted extinguishing agents.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\ndoes not contain any PFAS or other fluorinated organic compounds\n\ncontains only readily biodegradable detergents\n\nminimized hazard to the environment\n\nBuilding waterproofing with liquid plastics\n\nEdition 2023 | Valid until 31.12.2027\n\nLiquid plastics are required for exterior waterproofing of existing buildings. They are applied in a liquid state to the components to be waterproofed and, after curing, form a jointless, waterproof layer. Liquid plastics with the Blue Angel are ecotoxicologically harmless in contact with rainwater and minimise pollutant loads in the roof run-off water. This means that the roof run-off water can be used in an environmentally friendly way. The Blue Angel for structural waterproofing made of liquid plastics distinguishes products that have harmless formulations, are manufactured in a resource-saving way using at least 50% green electricity and meet strict criteria for ecotoxic effects in leaching tests. Products with hazard pictograms indicating environmental or health hazards are excluded.\n\nLiquid plastics are required for exterior waterproofing of existing buildings.

In particular, the introduction of microplastics from the artificial turf into the environment has been a much-discussed topic in recent years. This is mainly due to the loss of the infill granules and the impact of the sporting activities, maintenance measures, wind and rain. One important goals of the new ecolabel is thus to reduce the introduction of microplastics into the environment. Although legislation to restrict microplastics was published at the end of October as part of the EU Chemicals Regulation REACH, the ban on placing rubber and plastic materials on the market for use as filling materials for sports fields will only come into force across the EU in 8 years. The Blue Angel will establish appropriate requirements until this legislation comes into force.\n\nAlongside a reduction in plastic emissions, other important goals of the new ecolabel are minimising pollutant emissions into the soil and groundwater and conserving resources by placing requirements on the minimum use (utilisation) of the products as well as on the stability and durability of the artificial turf, promoting the use of post-consumer recycled materials and placing requirements on the ability to dismantle and recycle the artificial turf. In addition, the design, structural integration of the artificial turf sports field and behaviour of the sportspeople using it can also influence the level of any microplastic emissions. Part B places requirements on the use, care and maintenance of the artificial turf sports fields. For example, the sports fields must have a high use efficiency (based on a needs analysis of the hours of use by sportspeople), they must be maintained mechanically without the use of biocides and limits are also placed on the amount of water consumed.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\nPART A\n\nThis artificial turf system complies with the requirements of Part A of UZ 235 and enables the construction of an artificial turf sports field (Part B) certified with UZ 235.\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\nreduced introduction of microplastics into the environment\n\nrecyclable and durable\n\nPART B\n\nThis artificial turf sports field was constructed using an artificial turf system certified according to UZ 235 Part A and fulfils the criteria for Part B of the UZ 235 ecolabel, edition 2024.\n\nlow level of harmful materials, recyclable and durable artificial turf system\n\nreduced introduction of microplastics into the environment\n\nmechanical maintenance without the use of biocides\n\nefficient operation and intensive use\n\nBasic Award Criteria\n\nApplication documents follow soon\n\nPrinting inks, inks and toners for paper and cardboard on professional printing machines\n\nEdition 2024 | Valid until 31.12.2028\n\nBenefits to Environment and Health\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\nsupports high-quality paper recycling\n\nBasic Award Criteria follow soon\n\nApplication documents follow soon\n\nHousehold Energy Meters (new)\n\nEdition 2024 | Valid until 31.12.2028\n\nFind the Power Hogs in Your Home\n\nUnnecessary standby power consumption of household appliances can add up to 400 kWh per year and household.

The refrigeration systems for cooling food account for the largest proportion of the total energy consumption at almost 40 %, as well as for the largest share of the indirect greenhouse gas emissions from grocery stores in the food retail sector. Around 30 % of the total energy consumption is used for heating, around 20 % for lighting and 8 % for air conditioning. In all of these areas, there is significant potential for making savings in terms of energy consumption and thus reducing the green house emissions.\n\nIn addition, refrigeration systems can contain halogenated organic compounds as refrigerants and in their insulation materials. As a result of the use of natural refrigerants that have no ozone depletion potential and no or little global-warming potential in combination with the energy-efficient operation of the refrigeration systems, a significant proportion of the greenhouse gas emissions caused by refrigeration systems in the food retail sector can be saved. Other emissions savings are possible through good thermal insulation in the building, energy-efficient lighting, ventilation and the use of more energy-efficient electrical equipment.\n\nThose grocery stores in the food retail sector issued with the Blue Angel ecolabel will be operated in a particularly energy-efficient way and use climate-friendly natural refrigerants.\n\nDie mit dem Blauen Engel ausgezeichneten Verkaufsmärkte des Lebensmitteleinzelhandels werden besonders energieeffizient betrieben und verwenden klimafreundliche natürliche Kältemittel.\n\nBenefits to the Environment and Health:\n\nenergy efficient operation\n\nclimate friendly natural refrigerants\n\nuse of electricity from renewable energies\n\nStationary air conditioners\n\nEdition 2016 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nStationary air conditionersAir conditioners are designed to control the thermal comfort of living and working rooms and are especially used in those countries that regularly experience high outdoor temperatures. Yet an increased use of air conditioners in Germany, in parallel to more frequent hot spells, is also expected. If it is not possible to avoid the use of air conditioners with the aid of construction measures, environmentally friendly and energy efficient air conditioners could enable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, above all due to the use of natural refrigerants and increasing the efficiency of the devices. In addition, the requirements set by the environmental label should ensure that suppliers of air conditioners provide services of a higher professional quality.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\nenergy efficient\n\nclimate friendly natural refrigerants\n\nlow noise\n\nAvailable directly from the manufacturer.\n\nhttps://www.midea.com/\n\nStoves for wood\n\nEdition 2020 | Valid until 31.12.2028\n\nEven if it is carried out in a proper manner, heating with wood causes significantly more air pollutant emissions than other energy sources such as heating oil or natural gas. It can result, therefore, in higher levels of particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) in the air in residential areas – especially if a lot of wood-burning stoves and fireplaces are operated at the same time during colder months in combination with weather conditions causing inversion or if the wood-burning stoves are located in valleys and basins. In particular, manually fuelled log firing systems (log-burning stoves) also emit soot (as a component of the particulate matter). Alongside its negative effect on human health, soot also has a very high global warming potential. Against this background, a reduction in the emissions of particulate matter caused by, amongst other things, the operation of log firing systems is an important environmental goal.\n\nThe Blue Angel for stoves aims to encourage innovation in the sector and promote new developments in the design of stoves for the improvement of air quality. This will be achieved using equipment to lower emissions for an efficient and controlled combustion process with a significant reduction in the emission of particulate matter and other flue gases in comparison to conventional stoves.\n\nThis includes:\n\nSeparating technologies for reducing air pollutants that are harmful to human health, especially particulate matter and fine particles\n\nAutomatic air regulation that largely avoids any user influence and incorrect use\n\nThis will enable the sparing use of wood and reduce the high level of pollutants released into the environment.\n\nTo be certified with the Blue Angel, the stoves are subjected to an expanded test process that better reflects the real emissions from burning wood in the stove than is the case in the current type testing process. On this basis, stricter limits for pollutant emissions including the mass of the particulate matter have been defined. Heating appliances holding the Blue Angel must comply with a particle mass concentration limit of 15 mg/m³. The statutory limit according to the 1st BImSchV is 40 mg/m3. This reduction will be achieved above all through the use of innovative technologies such as particle separators.\n\nA large number of ultra-fine particles (smaller than 0.1 µm) are generated when burning wood that are considered to have their own negative impact on human health.\n\nTherefore, the Blue Angel for stoves is for the first time calling for the introduction of a particle count limit for wood-burning stoves in order to protect human health. The suitability of this measurement method has been confirmed in round robin tests carried out as part of a research project and a maximum limit for the particle count in the exhaust gas of 3 million has now been defined in the revised Basic Award Criteria.\n\nThe Blue Angel can thus provide guidance to those people who want to purchase a particularly environmentally friendly stove.\n\nBenefits to the environment and health\n\nreduction of particulate matter\n\neasy to use\n\nParticle separator for firewood single-room heating appliances\n\nEdition 2022 | Valid until 31.12.2028\n\nEven if it is carried out in a proper manner, heating with wood causes significantly more air pollutant emissions than other energy sources such as heating oil or natural gas. It can result, therefore, in higher levels of particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) in the air in residential areas – especially if a lot of wood-burning stoves and fireplaces are operated at the same time during colder months in combination with weather conditions causing inversion or if the wood-burning stoves are located in valleys and basins. In particular, manually fuelled log firing systems (log-burning stoves) also emit soot (as a component of the particulate matter). Alongside its negative effect on human health, soot also has a very high global warming potential. Against this background, a reduction in the emissions of particulate matter caused by, amongst other things, the operation of log firing systems is an important environmental goal. Particle separators can be fitted to wood-burning stoves to reduce the particulate matter produced during the burning of the wood and thus significantly decrease the amount of particulate matter that is particularly harmful to health.\n\nThe primary objective of the new environmental label for “particle separators” is to improve air quality by contributing to a reduction in the emissions of particulate matter from manually fuelled log firing systems. The certified devices reduce particulate matter emissions to a much greater extent and more reliably than conventional particle separators. In addition to the statutory regulations for building approval tests for particle separators, the special requirements imposed by the Blue Angel mean that certified particle separators have to comply with a significantly higher minimum separating efficiency and they must also be effective during the ignition phase that involves a particularly high level of emissions. The particle separators must have user-friendly additional functions that e.g. display the operating hours and indicate whether maintenance is required. Manufacturers are required to optimise the design and guarantee the provision of spare parts in the long term, while the criteria also help to improve the durability and reliability of the devices.\n\nParticle separators certified with the Blue Angel are primarily recommended for reducing particulate matter emissions from existing log firing systems. This additional equipment is not recommended for new stoves because stoves with an optimally matched particle separator that comply with the Blue Angel criteria are available instead.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\nreduction of particulate matter\n\nease of maintenance\n\ndurability\n\nHeat pumps\n\nEdition 2023 | Valid until 31.12.2027\n\nThe heat pump is a key technology for moving away from fossil fuel heating systems and is used not only for space heating but also for producing hot water.

It also significantly reduces waste water pollution and the consumption of water and energy. Recycled paper that has been awarded the Blue Angel environmental label is guaranteed to be made from 100% recovered paper. The use of chlorine, halogenated bleaching agents and not readily biodegradable complexing agents is also prohibited during the production process.\n\nThe products covered by DE-UZ 14a include office paper (copying and multifunctional paper), writing paper and printing and publication papers. These recycled papers meet the highest standards with respect to their fitness for use (DIN EN 12281) and the durability of the paper (ISO 20404). If handled and stored with care, these products are resistant to ageing over many hundreds of years. The papers are also suitable for the production of high-quality printed matter in accordance with DE-UZ 195, such as books, newspapers, magazines and brochures. In the case of office paper used for laser printing, the VOC (volatile organic substances) emissions are also restricted.\n\nHere, you will also find other recycled paper that is used to produce finished products e.g. for office and school supplies.

Finished products made from recycled paper that has been awarded the Blue Angel environmental label are guaranteed to be made from 100% recovered paper. The use of chlorine, optical brighteners and halogenated bleaching agents is also prohibited during the production process. In addition, other materials such as plastic, metal, etc. are only permitted to account for a maximum of 5% of the total mass of the product.\n\nIf you are looking for copy and multifunctional paper made from 100% recovered paper, you will find it under the scope of DE-UZ 14a.\n\nBenefits to the Environment\n\nmade from 100% waste paper\n\nsaves energy, water and wood\n\nlow level of harmful materials\n\nPrinting and Publication Paper made primarily from Waste Paper\n\nEdition 2020 | Valid until 31.12.2025\n\nIn contrast to the production process for paper made out of fresh fibres, producing paper from recovered paper not only saves resources but also generates less waste water and uses less water and energy. Printed matter that has been awarded the Blue Angel environmental label and which contains a percentage of fresh fibres is guaranteed to only contain those fresh fibres sourced from sustainably managed forests and forestry companies with high ecological standards. It is not permitted to use timber from forests that are particularly worthy of protection e.g. tropical or boreal forests.\n\nAt least 80% of the fibres used to produce the printing and publication papers primarily made from recovered paper listed here must be recycled. The addition of fresh fibres is sometimes necessary for paper used for quick printing processes because the high-speed printing presses require thin paper that has a very high resistance to tearing. Therefore, no test for the resistance to ageing is required for short-lived products such as paper used for newspapers.\n\nPrinting and publication papers made out of 100% recovered paper within the scope of DE-UZ 14a are available for durable and high-quality printed matter such as brochures and books. The papers listed there are also tested for their resistance to ageing and also include papers with heavier weights.\n\nThe production of printed matter is now also included within the scope of DE-UZ 195.

Energy and resources such as paper and ink are required for their production. The printing process and the cleaning of the machines can lead to the emission of volatile organic solvents that contribute to the production of ozone and \"summer smog\". In a comparison of their impact on ecological systems, those paper products made out of recovered paper perform significantly better in terms of their use of resources, waste water load and water and energy consumption than paper products made predominantly from virgin fibres. Therefore, the use of paper with a high proportion of recovered paper contributes to the preservation of resources, especially ecosystems such as forests, and to a reduction in waste during the manufacture of printed matter. In addition, the printed matter should allow for the recycling of its paper fibres through the use of suitable inks, varnishes and adhesives. Optimising procedures during the printing process can also reduce energy usage, waste paper and air and water emissions. Printed matter that has been awarded the Blue Angel environmental label thus represents an environmentally-friendly alternative to standard printed matter available on the market.\n\nAre you looking for the right printing company for your printed matter?
