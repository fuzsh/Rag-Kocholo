        "text": "2024 has had a handful of memorable K-pop moments in North America so far. From boy group ONEUS's La Dolce Vita tour to TWICE's one-night-only show at Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium in March, the industry has kept a steady flow of entertainment for lovers of Korean music and culture. Last month, ATEEZ, LE SSERAFIM, and indie band The Rose also left their mark at Coachella Festival in California, proving that K-pop acts at major festivals are a rising trend.\n\nWith summer right around the corner, even more tours, festivals, and conventions are set to pop up across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. From mid-May to September, whether on weekdays or weekends, there will always be something to do or someone to see. Among the most-awaited events are singer IU's first world tour and ATEEZ's massive trek in July, as well as Stray Kids, IVE, and VCHA's performances at Chicago's Lollapalooza Festival.\n\nTo help you enjoy the most out of this busy season, GRAMMY.com assembled a list of all the K-pop concerts and events happening in the next few months below.\n\nMay\n\nCIX: 0 or 1 in North America\n\nMay 10-26\n\nBoy group CIX will be back in North America for their third tour this May.

The quintet will likely perform hits like \"Cinema\" and \"Movie Star,\" as well as their latest single, \"Lovers or Enemies,\" and celebrate their upcoming fifth anniversary.\n\nHead in the Clouds Festival\n\nForest Hills, New York\n\nMay 11-12\n\nFollowing the success of last year's edition in Queens, New York, Head in the Clouds Festival returns to the big apple in 2024. In their mission to spread Asian diaspora talent, the lineup for this year enlists (G)I-DLE to headline on Saturday and singer BIBI on Sunday, along other names like ATARASHII GAKKO! and Joji. Korean acts Balming Tiger, Wave to Earth, and newcomer girl group Young Posse will also join them. HITC Festival is usually based in Los Angeles, but this year's L.A. edition has yet to be announced.\n\nBM (KARD): After the After Party Tour\n\nMay 14-25\n\nHailing from co-ed group KARD, Korean-American singer BM will kick off his first U.S. solo tour in mid-May.
