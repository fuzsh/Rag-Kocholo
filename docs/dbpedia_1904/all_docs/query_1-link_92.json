        "text": "Before Cyndi Lauper went solo, she recorded one album with the band Blue Angel, for which she sang lead. It was kind of a '50s-'60s pastiche thing, and the album isn't 100% strong, but the best tracks (about half of them) are great.\n\nIt came and went in the blink of an eye in the early '80s, and was out of print already when Girls Just Wanna Have Fun was released.\n\nAnyway, on several songs on the album, Cyndi really sings at the top edge of her range, with a pretty good amount of abandon. It sound exciting and great, but one could imagine that live it might have just been ragged.\n\nSo I'm curious if anyone here ever saw them live when they were a band? Were they able to keep it together, or was Cyndi out of control on the high energy songs?\n\nI thought they had appeared on the Uncle Floyd Show (airing from New Jersey), but when I asked \"Mugsy\" about it years later (not too long before he passed away), he insisted that they were never on the Show. They certainly fit the format. I've got a couple of copies of the Polydor album (from 1979, IIRC), a favorite track being \"Maybe He'll Know\", something I believe she re-recorded on an early solo album. She also does a killer version of a Gene Pitney song, \"I'm Gonna Be Strong\". That's where she shows her true vocal abilities.\n\nFred Clemens\n\nYes. Two or three times. I can't recall any details, at this late date. But I do remember be being blown away enough by their high energy show and Cyndi's voice, to pick up the LP the next time I was in the store. Oh wait, IIRC correctly they didn't even have the LP in stock. I ordered the LP, and bought the cassette, to tide me over, until the LP came in.\n\nI saw them 3 times in the early '80's. Cindy was very energetic and always put on a great show. I liked the band behind her, but they seemed like a typical bar band who got lucky with a charismatic lead singer (I thought the same thing about Blondie- I saw them in 1979 and the band looked awkward and stagestruck, no personality at all). When Cindy got really pumped, she'd go back and grab a drum stick and help the drummer out.\n\nI thought the same thing.\n\nProbably my favorite song on the record is the one that sounds the most like Blue Angel...\"Yeah Yeah!\n\nBut, what do you and I know? Cyndi herself described the Blue Angel record as going 'lead' on release. Whereas the first solo record, had four or five top 40 singles, and went multi-platinum.\n\nAhhh, thanks thats what it is...she did a cover of it. I saw an old MTV video, that had her doing the song, and they didnt mention \"with Cynday Lauper\", they just had it titled \"The Brains\", and that was it......"
