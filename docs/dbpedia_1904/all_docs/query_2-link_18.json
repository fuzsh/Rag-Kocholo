        "text": "This article largely borrows its content from another wiki, such as Wikipedia or EvaGeeks. Substantial cleanup and reformatting may be needed.\n\nThis article has a collection of images to further represent its content. To see its gallery, visit Ninth Angel/Gallery.\n\nThis article is about the character from Rebuild of Evangelion film series. For the character from the Neon Genesis Evangelion, see Bardiel.\n\nNinth Angel (第9の使徒, Dai 9 no shito?) is the 9th Angel belonging to the Rebuild of Evangelion film series. It was introduced in the Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance film.\n\nProfile[]\n\nHistory[]\n\nEvangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance[]\n\nIn Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance, the Ninth Angel is a luminescent blue ooze that takes over Unit-03 during its activation test with Asuka Shikinami Langley. As link-up is initiated, the inside of the entry plug is converted into the Angel’s core. Asuka develops “wings” that forcibly push her toward the EVA’s core unit. The entry plug fills with feathery blue “spores” and childish giggling, and an unidentifiable childish face appears deep within the plug. The Angel begins to grow on Asuka’s face.\n\nThe Evangelion then activates and goes out of control, destroying the Matsushiro facility with a massive blue explosion and leaving behind a crater similar to the one at the South Pole. The JSSDF and Unit-01 are deployed to halt its approach to NERV HQ, with Unit-00 kept at the base on standby. The former’s tank Company are completely ineffective, with Unit-03 simply walking pass all of the defensive lines while shrugging off tank fire, and initiates its attack on Unit-01. Shinji quickly notes the presence of the entry plug—designated as the Ninth Angel’s core and the hostile target according to the on-board targeting computer—and has misgivings about fighting back due to the implications for Asuka.\n\nWhile Unit-01 is being throttled, Shinji manages to break the other Angel’s choke hold, although Unit-03 simply responds by growing another pair of arms. These are flesh-coloured with red upper arms, as though to signify that Asuka is participating on some level. Unit-03 then proceeds to restrain Unit-01 with one set of arms and throttle it with the other, and the Ninth Angel begins to invade Unit-01’s neck through Unit-03’s new set of hands.\n\nDue to the danger to Unit-01 and its pilot, Gendo orders the use of the Dummy System. Shinji is restrained within the entry plug as Unit-01 reactivates and quickly returns Unit-03’s gesture, immediately overwhelming it and crushing its neck in short time. Unit-01 throws Unit-03 to the ground and, without regard for the fallen enemy’s feeble struggling, gruesomely eviscerates and dismembers it.\n\nUnit-01 finally retrieves the entry plug and crushes it with its mouth. A faint scream can be heard as LCL spurts out of the plug. The Ninth Angel’s remains dribbles like blood from Unit-01’s jaws as a rainbow arcs over the dusky sky.\n\nEvangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon A Time[]\n\nThe Ninth Angel remained contained in some fashion within Asuka, who eventually has a sealing pillar implanted into her left eye to contain it. While trying to render Evangelion 13 permanently inoperable, New Unit-02α's own A.T. Field prevents it from reaching it in an instinctive act of fear.\n\nAsuka decides that she must turn into an Angel herself to gain an A.T. Field strong enough to penetrate Evangelion 13's. Asuka removes the sealing pillar, removes the Evangelions limiters and injects a stored supply of Angel blood into the system. Asuka's A.T. Field envelops the remains of Unit-02 as a massive figure of light, and Asuka uses her empowered Field to neutralize the EVA's resisting one.\n\nBefore Asuka could pierce Evangelion 13, it awakens and destroys the override plug. Asuka realises that Evangelion 13 has a dual plug system, and requires an Angel pilot to replace the dead 13th Angel; this scenario was a trap from the beginning. Asuka's plug is removed, rendering Unit-02 inert. The plug is consumed, and thus Asuka the Ninth Angel, awakening 13 once more.\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nUnit-03 (the Ninth Angel) had is coloring changed from before and a 3D model was created, but most of the hand-to-hand combat between Unit-03 and Unit-01 was rendered in hand drawn animation. Ikuto Yamashita created a new design for the Dummy System for the film. The design fulfilled the requests on the part of the directors to have a system that would not only hold Shinji down, but would tower over him to block his vision, while still allowing him to hear everything going on. The slow and unnaturally smooth movement of the Dummy System as rendered by CGI instinctively stirs the viewer's revulsion.[1]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIt's status as the Ninth Angel in Evangelion 2.0: You Can (Not) Advance may be a reference to the Japanese belief that the number \"nine\" is an unlucky number because of its pronunciation which is the same as the word \"pain\".\n\nThe song that plays during the defeat of the Ninth Angel is \"Kyou no Hi wa Sayounara\".\n\nReferences[]"
