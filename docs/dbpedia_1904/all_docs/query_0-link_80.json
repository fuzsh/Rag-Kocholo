        "text": "Jennifer Aniston\n\nLOLAVIE, VITAL PROTEINS\n\nAniston has long led the entrepreneurial pack in Hollywood, negotiating brand deals with Smartwater and Living Proof that went beyond run-of-the-mill endorsements. The Friends star partnered with the Glaceau-backed water in 2007 as the face of the brand and an investor, forging a long-term partnership that ran through 2019. Similarly, she took an equity stake in Living Proof, the haircare brand she joined in 2012 as co-owner and spokesperson until it was acquired by Unilever in 2016. More recently, Aniston struck an elevated partnership with collagen supplement brand Vital Proteins as chief creative officer in 2020. (The company and her rep declined to disclose if she has an equity stake.) Last year, The Morning Show star and executive producer launched her own haircare brand LolaVie, born of her self-described obsession with “medical journals, technological advances and the latest beauty and health innovations.” Hands-on in all facets of the company — from product development and marketing to creative direction and promotion — Aniston has been methodical about rollout, offering up products only when she feels they are ready. Thus far, LolaVie sells a glossing detangler, lightweight hair oil, perfecting leave-in and restorative shampoo and conditioner with more on the horizon. Says Aniston, “I love the research and development phase of creating a product and testing it with people for feedback.”\n\nMy business motto is…\n\n“It’s okay to be tough — but also kind and fair. So many people only focus on being cutthroat and I think that doesn’t always serve you in the end.”\n\nDrew Barrymore\n\nBEAUTIFUL, FLOWER HOME, FLOWER BEAUTY\n\nDrew Barrymore’s entrepreneurial universe extends across media (Drew Magazine), cosmetics, and housewares. Her cruelty-free Flower Beauty line (sold at CVS and Kroger and online at Ulta Beauty and Walmart) features liquid highlighters and lip masks, and her partnership with Walmart has produced the Beautiful and Flower Home lines, which are made up of a range of kitchenware items and furniture and home décor items, respectively. Renewed this year for a third season, her daytime talk show — by consistently reinforcing her relatability and presence — helps propel all of her consumer-product endeavors. She credits Magnolia Network’s Joanna Gaines with inspiring her as an entrepreneur: “She helped me believe I could pivot my life and go after other dreams.” As for her advice to other entrepreneurs? “Always be aware of the economy,” says Barrymore. “I really care about trying to make things that are affordable but don’t lack in quality our innovation.”\n\nBiggest lesson I’ve learned as an entrepreneur:\n\n“Fight for your gut instincts. There’s a reason you’re there and not someone else. That said, be a good collaborator.”\n\nJessica Biel\n\nKINDERFARMS\n\nPain management for her teething children — sons Silas and Phineas with husband Justin Timberlake — inspired actress and producer Jessica Biel to seek medication that was both effective and healthy, and when she couldn’t find one, she created a solution. While deep in projects for Iron Ocean Films, the production company she shares with fellow producer Michelle Purple, Biel’s research in 2021 led her to partner with natural products entrepreneur Jeremy Adams and Venice Brands CEO Greg Willsey to create KinderFarms, a health and wellness brand the trio positions as a “farmaceutical” company. The current selection ranges from infant and children’s pain reliever and nighttime cough medicine to nutrition shakes, while KinderFarms’ flagship product, KinderLyte, a natural, medical-grade hydration drink, is currently available in more than 35,000 stores. Says Biel of her 10-year goal for the brand: “I would love to see my business as the No. 1 parent- and doctor-trusted company for clean infant and children over-the-counter medicine.”\n\nBest business advice I’ve gotten:\n\n“Bank on authenticity and transparency. If you love your products, believe in them and trust your company and partners implicitly, then so will your consumers.”\n\nKristen Bell\n\nHELLO BELLO, THIS SAVES LIVES\n\n“Being in front of the camera hasn’t interested me much this past year,” says Bell, who has been focused on her family and growing her creative studio, Dunshire Productions. “I’m finding the creativity behind the scenes much more inspiring. That may change, but for now, I’m content.” Dunshire, which she co-founded in February, has created brand campaigns for Guinness and Lagavulin (starring Nick Offerman) as well as Bell’s own Hello Bello. Since Bell and husband Dax Shepard launched the diaper brand in 2019, it has expanded into apparel, vitamins, and personal care products. Hello Bello also sent nearly 200,000 diapers and essentials to Poland to benefit Ukraine refugees at the beginning of the conflict, and created a registry fund to help families afford diapers. (The company has donated more than a million diapers to various organizations since its founding.)\n\nMeanwhile, on Nov. 10 it was announced that Bell’s snack brand with a mission to end child hunger, This Saves Lives, was acquired by GOOD Worldwide for just under $5 million. And, earlier this year, Bell invested in sustainable cottage cheese brand Good Culture. When it comes to marketing her socially-conscious brands, Bell keeps it fresh by focusing on concepts she personally finds interesting. “Be weird. Be quirky,” she says. “Business is hard. But it’s way less hard when you are building great stuff with great people who like to create together.”\n\nBiggest lesson I’ve learned as an entrepreneur:\n\n“Run your idea by someone who will challenge you or give you an opposing view. For me, this is my husband. And every time I run things by him, I’m able to see my blind spots, and the idea becomes better because of it.”\n\nJesse Bongiovi and Jon Bon Jovi\n\nHAMPTON WATER\n\nJon Bon Jovi lent his name to one of the most successful bands of all time. But what does a legendary rocker know about rosé? Quite a bit, it turns out. Before launching popular rosé wine label Hampton Water in 2018, Bon Jovi conducted two years’ worth of R&D; his son Jesse Bongiovi handled marketing and bottle design; and they partnered with Gérard Bertrand, a renowned biodynamic winemaker — and former rugby player — in the South of France. The result, a blend of Grenache, Cinsault, Mourvèdre and and Syrah, landed 90-point ratings from Wine Spectator four years in a row. “We intend to be the biggest rosé brand in the world,” vows Bongiovi. “Either that or I lose my mind trying.”\n\nI wouldn’t have launched a business if it weren’t for …\n\nBONGIOVI “Always running out of rosé.”\n\nBryan Cranston and Aaron Paul\n\nDOS HOMBRES\n\nMost celebrity spirits sink because the famous face is unwilling to put in the work. But the lead stars of Breaking Bad don’t believe in half-measures. You can frequently find them behind the bar at food and drink festivals from coast to coast or signing bottles of their Dos Hombres mezcal at BevMos across the San Fernando Valley — and the heavy lifting is paying dividends. Just three years after coming to market, they boast the third best-selling mezcal in the U.S. Of course, the quality of the liquid also helps. It’s crafted by Gregorio Velasco — a seventh-generation maestro mezcalero who the actors encountered on a journey into the remote hinterlands of Oaxaca. As a surprise birthday gift last year, they gifted him equity in the brand. “It was [Aaron’s] idea to launch Dos Hombres,” says Cranston. “So he’s the brains behind the brand. I just supply my extraordinary beauty.” Paul says he enjoys co-running the company because, “Many people see me as Pinkman and that couldn’t be further from the truth. I love that I get to use my mind, my heart and my passion for design in everything that I decide to create.”\n\nOur brand’s most engaged social post was…\n\nCRANSTON: “Our recent Halloween video was a lot of fun and garnered a massive number of views.”\n\nPAUL: “Bryan Cranston pushing me on a luggage cart full of Dos Hombres through a hotel hallway. It was something we already were doing and I said ‘We should maybe film this.’”\n\nGal Gadot\n\nGOODLES\n\nWith a lasso-swinging role as one of the most iconic superheroes in Hollywood (and the DC universe), the Israeli actress surely had options when it came time to expand her portfolio. But rather than zero in on a liquor brand, lip gloss or luxury fragrance, Gadot linked up with Goodles, a Santa Cruz-based boxed mac and cheese start-up. While the brand, launched in November 2021, serves up plenty of the goods — offerings now include Twist My Parm, Shella Good, Cheddy Mac, Movers & Shaker and Vegan is Believin’ — the company has a mission of spreading kindness and doing good. Goodles donates one percent of all products sold to organizations that address food insecurity. Business is off to a brisk start: In August, Goodles announced a nationwide launch into Whole Foods stores after already being available in Target and on Amazon. Gadot, a lifelong mac and cheese lover who regularly posts about the brand to her 89.6 million Instagram followers, also maintains a deal as an ambassador for Tiffany & Co. and runs Pilot Wave Motion Pictures alongside husband Jaron Varsano. She tells THR she’s enjoyed helping build the brand because she gets to learn “so much from great people. This is a fairly new territory for me. I’m curious, hungry and enjoy every second of it.”\n\nFellow celebrity entrepreneur who inspires me:\n\n“Ryan Reynolds. He shared his experience with me and what it takes to bring a brand to life. I love the ways he communicates his brand to the world as they are always fun, original and very Ryan. You gotta make sure the brand is in your voice with your spirit.”\n\nJennifer Garner\n\nONCE UPON A FARM, VIRTUE\n\nOrganic baby and snack company Once Upon a Farm is tracking to do $100 million in sales this year, according to co-founder and chief brand officer Garner. The line is also the first brand to receive the independent Clean Label Project’s 1,000 Day Promise certification, which tests baby food for contaminants such as heavy metals and pesticides. (The designation is based on the American Academy of Pediatrics’ determination that the first 1,000 days of a child’s life makes a major impact on long-term health.) Garner’s advice to budding entrepreneurs? “Be nimble, be transparent, be kind. It is a big deal to earn someone’s trust.” The actress is also a partner and spokesperson for Virtue hair care; its healing oil helped protect Reese Witherspoon’s hair at the 2022 Emmys.\n\nBiggest lesson I’ve learned as an entrepreneur:\n\n“All I do is learn lessons, I am the student here surrounded by experts. Learning every single thing from scratch is the gift in itself.”\n\nSelena Gomez\n\nRARE BEAUTY, SERENDIPITY\n\nBefore she became a business owner, Gomez agreed to a brand partnership only if there was a philanthropic element to the campaign. Today, she upholds that commitment with her own Rare Beauty line of cruelty-free makeup. Sold in 45 countries and 1,700 doors globally in less than two years, the company donates 1 percent of sales to the Rare Impact Fund, a nonprofit dedicated to mental-health services. So far, Rare — which makes blush, highlighter, foundation, bronzer sticks and more — has distributed $1.7 million to 17 grantees worldwide. Says the Only Murders in the Building star, “I hope in 10 years we’ve made a difference.” Gomez is also an investor in grocery delivery service Gopuff; co-founded mental health platform Wondermind in 2021; is a co-owner of desert brand Serendipity; and collaborates with Our Place on a cookware line.\n\nA different side of myself that I’m able to explore as an entrepreneur:\n\n“What I love about acting, singing/songwriting and producing is exploring my creative side. When it comes to my business interests, there is still an element of creativity, but what I truly love is the strategy behind the decisions we are making.”\n\nKevin Hart\n\nSeemingly every A-lister has a production company, plenty shill for brands (Care for a Nespresso?), a select few have built successful ones of their own (Casamigos, anyone?), and an even smaller number have launched their own venture capital funds. What differentiates Kevin Hart — named THR’s Entrepreneur of the Year 2022 — is not just that he does all of the above, but also the pace of his ambition: No one can claim to have had a more prolific 2022. This year alone, the comedian — who inked partnerships with numerous brands, including Sam’s Club and DraftKings, and continues to do ads for JPMorgan Chase — has introduced his own premium tequila (Gran Coramino), a plant-based fast food chain (Hart House), and a new media company, Harthouse, with $100 million in private equity backing. Hart plays a leading role in several fitness brands, including Hydrow and Fabletics; in January, Fabletics Men, the activewear line he launched in 2020, released its third collection. And in October, for good measure, Hart’s VC fund, Hartbeat Ventures, announced its first outside investment, from JP Morgan.\n\nKate Hudson\n\nFABLETICS, KING ST. VODKA, INBLOOM\n\nRefusing to be confined to one entrepreneurial lane, Kate Hudson has become a force across fitness and fashion as a co-founder of Fabletics, which has become a major player in the activewear space and enlisted partners like Kevin Hart and Lizzo; in alcohol, with her King St. Vodka brand, which she co-founded and where she serves as chief creative officer; and in wellness, with her InBloom nutritional powders; and even in tech and crypto, as an investor in MoonPay and the Future fitness app. After years as the face of Fabletics (which was reportedly preparing for an IPO last year), Hudson moved to a strategic adviser role in December 2021. “I like the game that is played in business,” says Hudson. “I like the challenges that I face being a woman in what is still a very, very male-driven environment — especially at executive levels.”\n\nMy business motto is…\n\n“I guess it’s, ‘What’s your why?’ What drives you and what is it about the business that moves you to want to be a part of it, and how does it give back, whether it be movies or products? That, to me, is always my motto; move with purpose.”\n\nVanessa Hudgens\n\nCALIWATER, THOMAS ASHBOURNE\n\nVanessa Hudgens puts her money where her mouth is, so to speak. In 2021, the actress joined functional cactus water brand Caliwater as a co-founder —her friend, actor Oliver Trevena, initially launched the company in 2014, targeting a boom in plant-based waters. Since relaunching last year, the antioxidant-rich Caliwater, currently in three flavors plus kids pouches, has grown over 700 percent and raised $2 million in seed funding from investors such as Gerard Butler, Aaron Rodgers, Ross Butler, Glen Powell and Brooke Burke. In another beverage venture this spring, Hudgens teamed with Rosario Dawson, Ashley Benson, Sarah Jessica Parker, John Cena, rapper Playboi Carti, and former L’Oreal exec Cara Kamanev to co-found premixed cocktail brand Thomas Ashbourne Craft Spirits. Sold in over 2,500 doors nationwide, the drinks include a Margarita conceived by Hudgens, Dawson and Benson. “You really have to get your hands dirty,” says Hudgens. “Do the work. Take the store visits. Be on the calls. Having a business doesn’t work if it’s something you’re just slapping your name onto. You really have to be in the mix and be passionate about it. Otherwise it’ll just get lost in the shuffle.”\n\nI see consumer patterns changing this way right now…\n\n“Consumers more than ever want transparency. To easily know exactly what is it that they are buying. Having all the information allows a deeper connection between consumer and product.”\n\nDwayne Johnson\n\nTEREMANA, XFL, ZOA\n\n“We’re still a very young company, not even 3 years old, but our valuation is well over $2 billion,” Johnson says of his tequila company, Teremana. “That is an extraordinary achievement.” The brand has shattered domestic sales records, becoming the largest launch in the history of the spirits business by selling more than 300,000 cases in its first year. German spirits giant Mast-Jägermeister, which had been a distribution partner, earlier this year bought a stake in the company to boost its impending 2023 international rollout. Similarly popular, Johnson’s energy drink brand ZOA has exceeded $100 million in sales this year. “We have become the fastest growing energy drink in the history of the industry,” he says. In October, ZOA expanded into Canada, its first international market.\n\nMeanwhile, as owner of the XFL — which saw business partner and co-owner Dany Garcia become chair, the first woman in a U.S. sports league at that level — he’s gearing up ahead of the 2023 season which will be broadcast on ESPN, ABC and FX through a partnership with Disney. Says Johnson, “We are all very inspired at this opportunity to create a culture and a league that gives hardworking, passionate athletes the chance to live their dream.”\n\nUnderlying all of his endeavors is an eye on the next generation. “They’re all legacy ventures for us,” says Johnson, adding that there’s an Easter egg on each bottle of Teremana, which nods to the goal. “An embossed word: TIJASI. That’s the first two letters of my three daughters’s first names Tiana, Jasmine, and Simone. That just gives you a little idea of the legacy effort that we put into Teremana.”\n\nJohnson continues, “When I am no longer here, all these brands will become generational. That’s the goal.”\n\nMy business motto is…\n\n“Always take care of the audience, the consumer, the people. Always take care of them and always send them home happy. That’s the motto I live by in all my businesses.”\n\nBlake Lively\n\nBETTY BUZZ\n\nLively is a household name as an actor, but her new juice-based mixer brand Betty Buzz, made with only clean ingredients, may be an even bigger star in the consumer space. While Lively has made some clever ads for the brand — a few featuring a crossover with “infamous gin slinger” husband Ryan Reynolds’ Aviation Gin (he also appears on THR’s list) — she’s mostly letting the product speak for itself. “It’s been incredible to see the response to simply giving people something made of pure quality,” she says, adding that the company is on track to sell more than 6 million bottles by the end of 2022. “Over the latest six months alone, Betty Buzz was responsible for 24 percent of the growth to the entire mixer category in the U.S. For one brand to be growing an entire category by a quarter is insane. We are ecstatic.”\n\nDespite growing up in a family of entertainers, Lively didn’t plan on a career in Hollywood and she’s finding this new professional challenge to be especially rewarding. “I saw how emotionally brutal [the industry] could be on people, and also I’m quite shy by nature,” she says. “I didn’t know what I wanted to do for a living, but I always worked harder than what was asked in everything I did because I loved the feeling of earned accomplishment.”\n\nLively says she’s driven to create with her “hands, mind and unrelenting will” and has only recently discovered that the work she does that isn’t forward-facing brings her more fulfillment. Now, she’s “finding my place and balance while working hard in an industry I never meant to be a part of and falling deeply in love with it.” She adds, “So many parts of myself haven’t been able to be fully realized, welcomed, or seen given the nature of the job. It’s only been in recent years that I’ve seen what I really want. What and where my value is.”\n\nSo, armed with this knowledge, does she have any other business endeavors in the works? Lively answers coyly, “Yes. Stay tuned …”\n\nA different side of myself that I’m able to explore as an entrepreneur….\n\n“Product development. It taps into my inner childhood dreams of being an inventor. Maybe I just watched Flubber too many times.”\n\nLizzo\n\nYITTY\n\nLizzo partnered with Fabletics this year to launch Yitty, her stylish, body-inclusive shapewear label. Marking the Grammy-winning musician’s first business foray outside of the music world, the colorful brand offers affordable bras, leggings, bodysuits and loungewear in sizes 6X to XS. ​​“I have spent the entirety of my life trying to change the way that I look or reshape my body,” the Emmy-winning Watch Out for the Big Grrrls star told THR earlier this year. Yitty is “a totally new take on shapewear, and believe me when I say there is plenty of space for innovation and creativity in the category.” Adds the singer, “I wouldn’t have launched a business if it weren’t for the overwhelming need for the product I created.”\n\nI see consumer patterns changing this way right now…\n\n“The idea of influence is changing and who we are getting that influence from is changing. Everything has been so overly branded and marketed, and now organic marketing and genuine word of mouth is what’s moving consumers, and that comes from a good product. You can’t fake that.”\n\nEva Longoria\n\nCASA DEL SOL, RISA, ANGEL CITY FC\n\nActress-director Eva Longoria’s ventures revolve around gastronomy. In 2021, she co-founded Casa del Sol premium tequila, sustainably produced in Mexico from Blue Weber agave sourced in the Jalisco highlands (leftover fibers fuel the distillery) and aged in French Limousin oak barrels. Investors include Kathy Hilton, interior designer Kelly Wearstler and photographer Brian Bowen Smith. Casa Del Sol rolled out to 47 U.S. markets and more than 3,000 stores this year and plans to expand internationally in 2023. “My tequila is made by women and that matters in a patriarchal industry,” she says, adding that her business moto is “produce with purpose.” She also just launched Risa, a non-toxic, non-stick cookware brand that is the first celebrity collaboration for e-commerce company Heyday and aspires to capture 10 to 15 percent of the non-toxic cookware market on Amazon. The actress has equity stake in the brand, which will release more colors and products in 2023. Having a strong team is all important says Longoria (who is also an investor in L.A. women’s pro soccer team Angel City FC): “You never want to be the smartest person in the room. If you are the smartest person in the room, you’re in the wrong room.”\n\nA different side of myself that I’m able to explore as an entrepreneur….\n\n“My business acumen. I use different tools in my brain when I’m in entrepreneurial businesswoman mode, as opposed to actor-director mode, which is more creative. It’s the practical, logical, reasoning side of my brain, more than the creative side.”\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nJLO BEAUTY, JLO JENNIFER LOPEZ FOR DSW\n\n“Being an entrepreneur is about creativity and limitless ideas, and not putting yourself into one box,” says Jennifer Lopez, who juggles acting, producing, singing, dancing, investing and being the all-around boss as founder of JLo Beauty. The star, who regularly keeps her 226 million Instagram followers apprised of her entrepreneurial endeavors, expanded into the body care category this year (with her new Firm + Flaunt Targeted Booty Balm) and partnered with dermabrasion company Hydrafacial on a new booster inspired by her face serum, which sold out presales on its first day. She also continues as owner of JLo Jennifer Lopez shoe collection for DSW and as principal and founder of Nuyorican Productions. She also fronts Coach campaigns, signed a new deal with Intimissimi as a global brand ambassador, and maintains investments in Goli nutritional supplements, BodyArmor and Virgin Voyages.\n\nWhere I see my business in 10 years …\n\n“I’ll see it in the next generation of entrepreneurs that we inspire and help open doors for.”\n\nMachine Gun Kelly\n\nUN/DN LAQR\n\nSinger and actor Machine Gun Kelly, aka Colson Baker, launched his vegan, nontoxic nail polish UN/DN LAQR last year, promoting the genderless line as an avenue for self-expression and reinvention. When he needs business advice, he says “I usually make a wrong call first, and then get a call from the person who actually knows what to do.” His take on today’s consumers? “They are attracted and engaged with the rawness of DIY campaigns more than the glossy, big-budget ones” — a sentiment that has hit home for his brand’s fans. Some nail polish colors temporarily sell out within hours of release. The line also includes sweatshirts, hats and nail stickers.\n\nFellow celebrity entrepreneur who inspires me:\n\n“Robert De Niro, because he got in business with Chef Nobu and made one of the most amazing upper-echelon sushi restaurants, which expanded to becoming its own hotel [brand].”\n\nKaty Perry\n\nDE SOI, KATY PERRY COLLECTIONS\n\nChart-topping singer-songwriter Katy Perry has a track record of backing wellness brands. With a group of investors, she and Orlando Bloom acquired apple cider vinegar producer Bragg Live Food Products in 2019. This January, after noticing a “greater trend towards non-boozy [drink] options,” says Perry, she co-founded the De Soi line of sparkling non-alcoholic wine-inspired apéritifs with master distiller Morgan McLachlan. Offered in three flavors, the drinks are crafted with natural adaptogens (reishi mushrooms and ashwagandha), fruit juices and botanicals. In July, De Soi announced $4 million in seed funding, led by Willow Growth and CAA, which represents Perry. The bubbly beverages are now available in 41 states and over 200 doors. A business motto Perry takes to heart is “stay true to yourself.” Following a hiatus, the musician completely bought back and relaunched her Katy Perry Collections (KPC) footwear line, which first debuted in 2017, for spring 2022. The brand reflects Perry’s signature whimsical style; she notes that the Laterr heel — “our architectural take on a kitten heel” — is a huge seller. “We got used to comfy flats, but we’re already ready to party!” says Perry. In regards to her 10-year goals, Perry says, “For KPC, I hope to increase sustainability in my product mix, and be a trusted source for affordable personality pieces. For De Soi, I hope to be a top five leader in the non-alcoholic space.”\n\nA different side of myself that I’m able to explore as an entrepreneur…\n\n“Honestly, I think I live a lot of my life with an entrepreneur mindset — what’s the risk vs. the reward, what’s the balance between unfiltered creativity and consumer-friendly. … I love learning the nuts and bolts of how to run a CPG business.”\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer\n\nHENRY ROSE\n\nPfeiffer had the purest of intentions when launching her own perfume brand. After becoming a mom, the big-screen icon more carefully considered what she put in and on her body and was surprised to learn that fragrance companies didn’t have to disclose ingredients. And as someone who loved fine perfumes, that didn’t sit right with her. After years of development, Pfeiffer launched Henry Rose in 2019 — named by borrowing the middle names of her now-grown children (John Henry and Claudia Rose) with David E. Kelley — by making sure the brand met the stringent safety and sustainability standards of the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. Henry Rose gradually built its portfolio with luxe offerings ($120 for 50 ml bottles) and has since expanded its categories to include body (body cream, bar soap, sanitizer, and hand and body lotion) and home (candles). Pfeiffer says her brand’s mission is to help educate “the public, especially young people, about the importance of ingredient transparency and safety, so they don’t spend decades dousing themselves with products filled with harmful ingredients.”\n\nA different side of myself that I’m able to explore as an entrepreneur…\n\n“As an actor, I’ve had agents, lawyers, managers, etc., to have all of the difficult conversations for me. Now, as a leader, I have had to learn to have those conversations. Your baggage and hangups that mess you up in life will also bleed into your leadership. So, it’s been a deeper dive into myself.”\n\n.\n\nIssa Rae\n\nHILLTOP COFFEE, SIENNA NATURALS\n\nIssa Rae wears multiple hats as a writer, producer and founder of media production company Hoorae. But ever true to her South L.A. roots, she also co-owns Hilltop Coffee & Kitchen (locations include Inglewood and Windsor Hills). She is also a co-owner of Sienna Naturals, a vegan product line for textured hair sold at Target and Nordstrom. The actor’s “wash day ritual” is made up of her company’s cleansing shampoo, hydrating treatment mask, smoothing leave-in conditioner, and sealing product. One upside of becoming an entrepreneur? Says Rae, “I’ve gotten so much better about managing my time because it’s so precious. And one unproductive meeting or event or task can literally take time away from the business — so I choose a lot more wisely how and where I spend my time.”\n\nFellow celebrity entrepreneur who inspires me …\n\n“Diddy aka ‘Love’ has been influential since I was in middle school, does everything I want to do, owns most of what he does, and seems to have the best time doing it.”\n\nRyan Reynolds\n\nAVIATION GIN, MAXIMUM EFFORT MARKETING, MNTN, MINT MOBILE, WREXHAM AFC\n\nDespite multiple projects in the pipeline, including Deadpool 3 and a Free Guy sequel, Reynolds managed to take a year off from shooting films. “I continued to work on my other businesses,” he notes. “But, in doing that, I could be in New York and remain present with my family.” It’s a lot to balance. Especially when that family includes a famous partner — his wife, Blake Lively (also on this list) — and when those businesses include a continued ownership stake in Aviation Gin (which sold to Diageo in 2020 along with its parent company in a potentially $610 million deal), MNTN, Maximum Effort Marketing, Mint Mobile and, most recently, Welsh football club Wrexham AFC. In Reynolds’ case, he feels being part of a Hollywood power couple actually makes things easier. “We do everything together,” says Reynolds of Lively. “She works on my projects and I work on hers. I’d say our partnership is a big reason we’ve managed to make inroads in so many industries which, historically speaking, wouldn’t involve showbiz types.”\n\nReynolds says he’s focused on “mindful growth,” and making sure his endeavors maintain their core mission of “bringing people together in smart, fun and unexpected ways.” Perhaps one of the most surprising things he did during his acting sabbatical was film the FX docuseries Welcome to Wrexham with club co-owner Rob McElhenney. Then again, storytelling is a common thread in his professional life. “The documentary is designed to not only highlight how exciting Wrexham is as an historic football club trying to gain promotion, but primarily, to center the folks in and around the club,” says Reynolds. “The community is arguably as interesting, if not more, than the third oldest football club on Earth. It’s been one of the most unexpected and exciting ventures I’ve ever been a part of.”\n\nBest business advice I’ve gotten:\n\n“Lose the layers. Do things yourself. Be on calls. Meet in person. Everything changes for the better when face to face.”\n\nSeth Rogen\n\nHOUSEPLANT\n\nRogen has taken his reputation as one of Hollywood’s most 420-friendly stars and built Houseplant, a thriving marijuana business that’s sold in more than 35 dispensaries across California. Rogen — and his producing partner Evan Goldberg, with whom he co-founded Houseplant — hand select (and smoke) their product, which is sold as flower and pre-rolled joints, alongside weed-related products like trendy lighters and ashtrays. “If I didn’t love weed as much as I do,” says Rogen, “Houseplant would not exist.” Rogen has also brought his social-media-documented passion for pottery to the business, now selling some of his vase and planter designs through the brand. The company, he says, allows him to explore the side of himself “that loves design … things like graphic design, interior design, product design. It’s incredibly gratifying to work not only on the aesthetics and function of the product, but to also be in control of exactly how the product is presented to the world. Maybe that’s something I feel I’m missing from my other job…”\n\nMy business motto is…\n\n“Shit, am I supposed to have one of those? What’s Ryan Reynolds’? I’ll take his.”\n\nIan Somerhalder and Paul Wesley\n\nBROTHER’S BOND BOURBON\n\nThe Vampire Diaries lasted eight seasons on The CW. After it ended in 2017, its popular co-stars were eager for an excuse to continue working together. A mutual love of bourbon provided an ideal opportunity. In May 2021 they launched Brother’s Bond, named in honor of their enduring friendship. The easy-drinking wheated whiskey, in turn, has earned many friends along the way. Just over a year after launch, increasing demand inspired the duo to launch an extension to the line: a limited-edition cask-strength variation which expands their reach into the realm of connoisseurs. Somerhalder says the biggest lesson he’s learned so far is, “You are only good as your team,” while Wesley adds, “The dream is that someone goes to a bar and orders a Brother’s soda instead of a whiskey soda and every bartender knows exactly what they mean.”\n\nBest business advice I’ve gotten:\n\nSOMERHALDER: “I was involved in a very humbling and tough business deal that my wife actually helped me navigate using her amazing business prowess. She called in a mentor and dear friend of ours, a well-known investor named Lyndon Lea to bestow some important business advice. He said, “Ian, business is not about WHAT you see. It’s about what you DON’T see…” I’ve never looked at a situation or a deal the same again.”\n\nMy business motto is…\n\nWESLEY: “People always joke that I am glass half empty and Ian is glass half full. I tend to focus on consistently improving rather than celebrating any success. I am grateful I have people on my team who balance me out so that I can take a step back and enjoy the wins.”\n\nMichael Strahan\n\nAPPAREL LINES, MICHAEL STRAHAN DAILY DEFENSE\n\nStrahan — who personally signs off on the design of every garment in his men’s suiting and athleisure lines (Michael Strahan at Men’s Wearhouse, Collection by Michael Strahan at JCPenney and the NFL-licensed MSX by Michael Strahan) — expanded into skin care in 2022. His Michael Strahan Daily Defense moisturizer and shave products (sold at CVS) are made with Activated Silk, biotechnology from a natural silk protein. “For years I was having trouble finding the perfect shaving lotion, so I set out to make it. I wanted it to be clear so you can see your beard and know where to shave yet still make it thick enough to protect your skin. Mission accomplished and I’m obsessed,” says Strahan, who also runs talent management and production company SMAC with business partner Constance Schwartz-Morini. His long-time motto? “Hustle like your broke.”\n\nBiggest lesson I’ve learned as an entrepreneur:\n\n“Never stop believing in yourself. I live by my dad’s motto, ‘Not if, but when” it will happen. Having that mindset in every entrepreneurial decision is crucial. ‘Failures’ or ‘nos’ are just redirections to something bigger and better. I accept failure as part of the journey and figure out another way to make it happen.”\n\nGabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade\n\nPROUDLY, FLAWLESS BY GABRIELLE UNION, WADE CELLARS\n\nThis Hollywood power couple makes equally strong entrepreneurial moves. In 2017, the actress debuted her Flawless by Gabrielle Union hair care label as well as a licensed size-inclusive, namesake fashion line for New York & Company. Reimagined during the pandemic, Flawless brought on longtime hairstylist Larry Sims in 2020 with 12 new products under $10; Union’s fashion brand was reintroduced last year and expanded to Lord & Taylor and plus-size retailer Fashion to Figure. And two years ago, Union launched a mommy-baby workout on fitness/wellness app FitOn (in which she has an equity stake), and also signed on as co-founder of organic snack brand Bitsy’s, sold at Walmart. (The company received a $1.34 million investment in September from Fearless Fund, which finances women of color-led companies.) Jointly, Union and Wade co-own Proudly, a baby-care brand focused on melanated skin. Last month, the collection expanded to Target and added diapers. “I wouldn’t have launched a business if it weren’t for the consistent de-centering of the needs, wants, and desires of Black women and children specifically, as well as other melanated folks who have been marginalized in every sector of business and life,” Union tells THR. Meanwhile, her 13-time NBA All-Star husband founded the Way of Wade footwear, clothing and accessories label a decade ago with Chinese sportswear company Li-Ning. Other ventures include wine company Wade Cellars, in partnership with Napa Valley vintner Jayson Pahlmeyer — where sales are up 35 percent over 2021 — and co-ownership of California cannabis lifestyle brand Jeeter. He also purchased a minority stake last year in the Utah Jazz. Wade says the best business advice he’s been given is, “You have to believe in the people more than you believe in the business.”\n\nBiggest lesson I’ve learned as an entrepreneur:\n\nUNION: “Be prepared for success. We didn’t anticipate the demand and it actually set us back. Being out of stock sounds like high-class problems but is terrible for a new business.”\n\nA fellow celebrity entrepreneur who has inspired me:\n\nWADE: “I have always been inspired by Magic Johnson and the work that he has done both in business and the community. As an athlete, he has dispelled any limit to our success and set the bar high for my generation and those to come.”\n\nSofía Vergara\n\nFOSTER GRANT, ROOMS TO GO, WALMART PARTNERSHIP\n\nWhile Sofia Vergara has been appearing as a host on America’s Got Talent and starring in Netflix’s upcoming Griselda (also exec-produced by Vergara and partner Luis Balaguer for Latin World Entertainment), she’s also been expanding her product lines and licensing deals. Her Walmart collection comprises denim, apparel, activewear, intimates and shapewear, jewelry and most recently home furnishings and décor, including tableware and bedding. The star also has a reading-glasses line with Foster Grant and a furniture collection for Rooms to Go. As for where she sees her business in 10 years, Vergara tells THR, “I am lucky to be offered many kinds of business opportunities and can be selective, but I’m always interested in new ways to expand what I’m able to offer that are aligned with my interests. I have some things I’ve been working on that I’m really excited to be able to share more about soon. It’s also important to me to continue finding ways to give back and give the new generations of entrepreneurs tools to grow their own businesses.”\n\nFellow celebrity entrepreneur who inspires me:\n\n“There are so many, but I’ve always been inspired by Oprah, Martha Stewart and Jennifer Lopez. They do so many different things and are constantly evolving their businesses. I admire them a lot.”\n\nCiara and Russell Wilson\n\nOAM, HOUSE OF LR&C\n\nPower couple Ciara and Russell Wilson are involved in a range of entrepreneurial pursuits. This year, Ciara, currently working on her eighth studio album, debuted OAM (On a Mission), a timed-release vitamin C-based skin-care line, after becoming a co-owner of Ten to One Rum. (One of its recent releases was named by Robb Report as one of the best new spirits of 2022). Meanwhile, her Denver Broncos player husband — who says his motto in business is “Only do things that are meaningful and authentic to you” — is the founder of Good Man Brand apparel; the brand, along with her LITA by Ciara fashion line and their gender-neutral clothing brand Human Nation, is part of the couple’s House of LR&C fashion retail company, co-founded with former Lululemon CEO Christine Day. The pair also have a his-and-hers duo fragrance R&C. The Wilsons donate 3 percent of profits — after product costs (and excluding her Ten to One rum deal) — to their Why Not You Foundation, which supports equal education opportunities and children’s health initiatives. As for Ciara’s take on contemporary customers? “When it comes to fashion, people are looking for brands that are built on values, they want to see diversity and inclusion, and they want us to make sustainability easy for them without giving up personal style.”\n\nMy business motto is…\n\nCIARA: “When you get a chance to introduce your brand for the first time, swing big!”\n\nI see consumer patterns changing this way right now…\n\nWILSON: “1) If you don’t have a direct path to the consumer, aka DTC, you’re losing. 2) People want to wear, breathe, and root for brands that have purpose.”\n\nReps Behind the Brands\n\nCAA, ENDEAVOR, UTA\n\nFor clients at major agencies looking to start a brand, there’s a go-to team ready to help guide them. Here are the names to know.\n\nCAA: At Creatives Artists Agency, Toby Borg heads up the Global Client Strategy division; Peter Hess is the co-head of commercial endorsements and Michael Yanover is the head of business development. Between them, they’ve worked on deals for celebrities and brands including Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade (Proudly), Katy Perry (De Soi), Lady Gaga (Haus Labs), Vanessa Hudgens (Caliwater) and Drew Barrymore (Flower Beauty). “There are several key factors that go into making a successful celebrity brand,” Borg tells THR, “including great category and consumer insights, an organic and authentic relationship with the founder/artist, and a strong management team. Most importantly, the brand or product must be exceptional in its own right.”\n\nEndeavor: Ben Enowitz, Sherif Hamid and Vince Sirianni lead Talent Ventures at Endeavor, where the trio has worked on brand deals for Eva Longoria (Casa Del Sol, Risa), Shay Mitchell (Béis, Onda), Gal Gadot (Goodles), Mark Wahlberg (Flecha Azul) and Selena Gomez (Rare Beauty). Sirianni says his motto in business is “There’s always a solution,” while Hamid’s is “Always read your important emails three times over.” Adds Hamid today’s marketplace, “The pendulum has shifted back to retail and [to] where scalability only through direct-to-consumer has become more challenging.”\n\nUTA: At United Talent Agency, the UTA Ventures division is headed by partner Sam Wick, with Courtney McHugh serving as its vice president and head of brand management and Shelly Marchetti as vice president of Ventures Studio and co-head licensing. Celebrity brands they’ve worked on include Issa Rae’s Sienna Naturals haircare line, Elizabeth Banks’ Archer Roose canned wines, Emma Chamberlain’s Chamberlain Coffee, Lisa Rinna’s Rinna Beauty and Tia Mowry’s Spice by Tia housewares brand. Wick’s advice for a celebrity who wants to start a brand is, “Enter the market from a place of authenticity, passion and ownership.”\n\nA version of this story first appeared in the Nov. 21 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
