        "text": "BERKELEY HEIGHTS, NJ, March 01, 2023 /24-7PressRelease/ -- On Thursday, March 9, 2023, Wharton Arts will honor two-time Grammy Award winning opera singer Angel Blue with its Lifetime Achievement Award at its Annual Gala. Angel Blue has taken the opera world by storm with historic performances including Violetta in Verdi's La Traviata, where Ms. Blue was the first Black woman to ever sing the fully staged role in Italy at Teatro alla Scala. She also opened the Metropolitan Opera season as Bess in a new production of George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, and in their groundbreaking production of Terrance Blanchard's Fire Shut Up In My Bones. She currently sings the role of Violetta Valéry in the new Metropolitan Opera production of La Traviata.\n\nWharton Arts' annual gala is a lavish cocktail party and will feature student performances and a live auction during a three-course sit down dinner. The Gala will take place at the Westmount Country Club, 728 Rifle Camp Road in Woodland Park, NJ. To attend the gala and support Wharton Arts, including its silent auction, please visit WhartonArtsGala.org.\n\nThe prestigious Wharton Arts Lifetime Achievement Award distinguishes individuals who, during their lifetime, have made creative contributions of outstanding artistic significance to the performing arts and represent a beacon of inspiration to Wharton Arts' students. We are extremely honored to have Angel Blue accept the award at the annual event celebrating Wharton's thriving, life-changing performing arts education programs. The event will feature Ms. Blue performing Puccini's O mio babbino caro as well as collaborations with students from the New Jersey Youth Chorus, New Jersey Youth Symphony, and Paterson Music Project. Previous Wharton Arts Lifetime Achievement honorees were Jamie Bernstein, John Debney, and Paul Shaffer.\n\nPeter H. Gistelinck, Executive Director of Wharton Arts, shared his enthusiasm for the honoree and said, \"Angel Blue is not only an amazing internationally-recognized and celebrated opera singer with huge credentials, but also represents the tenacity and courage necessary to persist in the professional world of classical music. Her career and life path are testimonies to this, and she definitely is an example to all of us. \"\n\n\"I am so honored to be recognized with the 2023 Lifetime Achievement Award of Wharton Arts, an organization I admire for their work and creative mission of offering accessible, high quality performing arts education that sparks personal growth and builds stronger communities,\" said Angel Blue, Grammy Award winning soprano. \"I am very much looking forward spending time with youth musicians and guests at the Gala.\"\n\nAbout Angel Blue\n\nAngel Blue has emerged in recent seasons as one of the most influential sopranos before the public today. The two-time Grammy Award winner, 2020 Beverly Sills Award recipient, and the 2022 Richard Tucker Award winner is celebrated worldwide for her honeyed soprano and affecting deliveries of many of the most beloved roles in the operatic repertory, such as Violetta in Verdi's La Traviata, Bess in Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, Mimí in Puccini's La Bohéme, and Destiny/Loneliness/Greta in Terrence Blanchard's Fire Shut Up in My Bones.\n\nThe 2023 spring and summer season begin with Ms. Blue as Violetta in Verdi's La Traviata at the Metropolitan Opera with Maestro Nicola Luisotti, and her debut in the titular role in Aida at the Royal Opera House with Sir Mark Elder. She can be seen in concert with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and Maestro Oskana Lyniv, and in recital with distinguished Canadian pianist Dr. Bryan Wagorn at Arizona Opera. Ms. Blue's first summer appearance begins in Europe on tour with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, under the direction of world-renowned conductor Yannick Nézét-Seguin. She will then make appearances at the Hollywood Bowl in Verdi's Requiem with the star maestro Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, shortly followed by her return to the Santa Fe Opera to sing the title role in Tosca. She makes her Aspen Music Festival debut in a solo recital with pianist Myra Huang.\n\nThe 2023-2024 season introduces audiences to Angel Blue as Leonora in Verdi's Il trovatore at the San Francisco Opera, followed by a highly anticipated return to the Vienna State Opera as Tosca. She continues her season with performances as Micaëla in Carmen and a role debut as Magda in La Rondine at the Metropolitan Opera. Angel Blue was raised in California and completed her musical studies at UCLA. She lives in New Jersey with her husband and son.\n\nAbout Wharton Arts\n\nWharton Arts is New Jersey's largest independent non-profit community performing arts education center serving nearly 2,000 students through a range of classes and ensembles.
