        "text": "THE BLUE ANGELS TEAM\n\nThe goal of our Blue Angels' team is to inspire a culture of excellence and service to country.\n\nWe are representatives from the fleet, showcasing the pride and professionalism of the United States Navy and Marine Corps. We are thrilled to perform demonstrations across the country, sharing our Navy and Marine Corps experiences with our fellow Americans, bringing Naval aviation to communities across the country that may not have a large military presence.\n\n2024 marks the 78th year of the Blue Angels. Since 1946, it has been our honor to represent the hundreds of thousends of men and women who serve in the United States Navy and Marine Corps to audiences both at home and abroad, showcasing the excitement, precision, and power of Naval aviation.\n\nOur 158 active duty Sailors and Marines uphold the rich tradition of excellence instituted by those who have served before us. Our goal for 2024 is to continue to inspire young men and women, not just to pursue a career in Naval aviation or the military, but to excel in all areas of their lives.\n\nEach performance provides the American public an opportunity to view the incredible capabilities of our service members serving aboard every ship, squadron, and unit in the United States Navy and Marine Corps.\n\nIt is our goal to see that tomorrow's leaders will be inspired and motivated by what they see our men and women accomplishing today."
