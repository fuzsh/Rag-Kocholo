        "text": "During the 1930s, James Stevens (Anthony Hopkins) serves as a proper English butler to the doltish Lord Darlington (James Fox). Stevens is so dedicated that he forgoes visiting his father on his deathbed in order to serve, and overlooks Darlington’s Nazi sympathies and growing anti-Semitism. Twenty years after his employer’s death, Stevens tries to reconnect with Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson), Darlington’s head housekeeper, and begins to regret his loyalty to his former master.\n\nAlongside the documentary Merchant Ivory, we will be playing classic films by the iconic filmmaking duo, such as A Room with a View, Howard’s End, and Maurice."
