        "text": "The visceral pain at the center of this adaptation from period drama powerhouse Merchant-Ivory comes not from fading or unrequited love but unrealized affection. Try as he might to repress his feelings, devoted butler Mr. Stevens (Anthony Hopkins) canât stifle the blossoming attachment he shares with housemaid Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson). And yet, at every opportunity she gives him to do something about it, he balks, squandering the potential for something truly beautiful â something that actually belongs to them, not their aristocratic employer.\n\nThe Remains is partly told in flashbacks to the period leading up to the Second World War. From his stately home, Stevensâ master Lord Darlington and his peers play at international relations and try to avoid another war by pandering to the Nazis, but find theyâre woefully under-equipped to decide the fate of Europe in this changing world. One of the many brilliant things about The Remains is the way this political drama doubles the devastation of Stevensâ die-hard commitment to his job â because now, heâs sacrificing his one chance at love for something that wonât even survive the decade. Sublime filmmaking and performances turn Stevensâ every minute choice into a pillar of profound tragedy, giving us a maddeningly heartwrenching life lesson for the ages."
