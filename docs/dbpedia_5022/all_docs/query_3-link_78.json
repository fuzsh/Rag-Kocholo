        "text": "Legendary film director James Ivory, 95, would be forgiven if he wanted to retire in peace at his historic Claverack, New York estate, one that's reminiscent of the bucolic properties that grace many of his movies. But Ivory is still working, traveling and spending time with his dedicated audiences. On September 16, and 17, Hudson Hall will host A Celebration of James Ivory. The event will include the screening of three of his movies, discussions with Ivory and guests, and even a dinner at Feast and Floret.\n\n“Few filmmakers can boast the excellence and longevity of Jim’s incredible career,” says Hudson Hall Executive Director, Tambra Dillon. “We are so proud to have the opportunity to honor his contribution to the arts in the community he’s called home for many years now, and in the presence of his collaborators and friends.”\n\nThe films Ivory made with partner and producer Ismail Merchant, and writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala — under the shingle of Merchant Ivory Productions — defined the aesthetic and atmosphere of period dramas for a generation. However, classic costume dramas like \"Howards End,\" \"Remains of the Day,\" and \"Room With a View\" are just a part of his prolific output. A few years ago, at 89, he became the oldest recipient of an Academy Award, for his writing of the script for the acclaimed coming-of-age gay romance, “Call Me By Your Name.”\n\nThat film will be the main event Saturday evening with a discussion before, but Ivory says he’s even more excited about the other two offerings on the lineup. “The Bostonians,” an emotionally intricate suffrage drama released in 1984 plays on Saturday, and \"Shakespeare Wallah,\" one of Merchant Ivory’s first films (1965), will play Sunday, followed by drinks at The Red Dot.\n\nFrom \"Shakespeare Wallah\"\n\n“Everyone wants to see \"Call Me By Your Name\" but I do feel like most people have already seen that,” says Ivory. “I’m happy that they are showing a film like \"The Bostonians\" because it's not seen that often, and it's one of our best films, I think. It has some extraordinary performances. Vanessa Redgrave got nominated for an Oscar and visually, it's a very interesting film. And, I always like it when people want to see one of our Indian films, because people forget that that’s where I began.”\n\nIvory and Merchant met by chance, when a young Ivory was showing a documentary on Indian art at India's New York consulate. Their public professional partnership and private personal one, was prolific, until Merchant’s passing in 2008.\n\nIn 1975, Ivory needed to buy a piece of property as a condition of a business deal. He found and became quickly enamored with a historic home in Claverack. Built in 1805 by French architect Pierre Pharoux for Jacob Rutsen Van Rensselaer, the gorgeous and unusual Colonial Revival, with its two front octagonal rooms, was broken up into six apartments at the time. But behind the tacked-on renovations was a home with classic details that rivaled those featured in his productions.\n\n“It’s a beautiful place and I prefer to be in a beautiful place, but it’s completely accidental that I ended up in Claverack,” Ivory said. “I had to reinvest some money in some sort of business situation but then I loved it, even though it was broken up. I like to think I was a good landlord, but by the late 80s I had it all to myself and had the walls taken out and everything original was still there. I started to restore the house as best I could. That went on for years and years, and it’s still going on, really.”\n\nMany of Merchant Ivory films were written and conceived in Claverack and some were even edited in a barn studio out back. Ivory still works from the house, though less over the past year due to the Writers Guild of America strike.\n\n“I am a member of the Writers Guild, and I am a member of the Directors Guild,” he says. “So if they go on strike, I go on strike. It's keeping me from working on a TV series about Tennessee Williams that I would like to be working on. [The studio system] sure seems greedier to me. The issues people are fighting for are important.”\n\nThe notion of not working doesn’t cross Ivory’s mind. He has a busy schedule coming up, with a lot of travel. Just five years away from his personal centennial his dance card is quite packed.\n\n“What keeps old people like me going is a basic thing, and that is curiosity,” Ivory says. “That's the only thing. If you have that then you never stop. I've always had it, and I still have it and I have a lot of plans coming up in the next few months, I'm going go to Mexico. So, you know, it's curiosity. That's really what makes you tick.”\n\nOn September 16 and 17, join Ivory in an exploration of that curiosity. Omnibus tickets for all the events and the dinner are sold out, but all three screenings still have seats available individually. It’s a truly unique opportunity to spend time with a local and international legend.\n\nA Celebration of James Ivory\n\nHudson Hall\n\n327 Warren Street, Hudson, NY\n\n(518)822-1438\n\nSaturday, September 16, 2 p.m.\n\n\"The Bostonians\" (1984)\n\nFollowed by a Q&A with James Ivory and special guests\n\n\"Call Me By Your Name,\" (2017) 7 p.m.\n\nWith a pre-film discussion with James Ivory, producer Peter Spears and special guests"
