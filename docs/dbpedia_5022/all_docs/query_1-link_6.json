        "text": "James Ivory began his career as a documentary filmmaker before teaming up with producer Ismail Merchant to make \"The Householder\" (1963). Based on a novel by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, the film marked the first of the trio's features centering on the people and culture of India. The team's second effort, \"Shakespeare Wallah\" (1965), attracted international attention for its sensitive portrayal of a family of British touring actors and its insights into the legacy of colonialism. Merchant and Ivory went on to earn a reputation for quality films made on shoestring budgets, with their best work--heavily influenced by Satyajit Ray--examining the interplay between different cultures (\"Bombay Talkie\" 1970, \"Heat and Dust\" 1983)."
