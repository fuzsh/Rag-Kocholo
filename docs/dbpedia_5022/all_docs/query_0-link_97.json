Registration information here.\n\n“It has been my privilege to see the best of England over the years, sir, within these very walls.”\n\nThis class will offer a three-part reading of Kazuo Ishiguro’s masterpiece of emotional and historical memory, The Remains of the Day, followed by a discussion of the heartbreakingly beautiful 1993 film adaptation directed by James Ivory. Together, the novel and film offer a timely meditation on lost opportunities—personal, political, and moral."
