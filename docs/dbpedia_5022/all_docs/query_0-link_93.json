        "text": "In late 1930s England, Anthony Hopkins is a butler so meticulous and devoted he misses his father’s death in the name of service and overlooks his master’s increasing Nazi sympathies. Emma Thompson is the housekeeper for whom he quietly pines. Nominated for eight Oscars, including Jhabvala’s adapted screenplay, this is the definitive film version of recent Nobel Prize winner Kazuo Ishiguro’s novel."
