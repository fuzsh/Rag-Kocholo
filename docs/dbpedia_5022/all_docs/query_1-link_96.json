        "text": "''I'm a writer's daughter,'' the young heroine of ''A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries'' finally insists, though her father, a World War II veteran, has always repeated the title phrase in times of trouble. ''It's okay then,'' he assures her. ''They cry all the time.''\n\nOn the evidence of James Ivory's latest film, another thing writers' daughters do is recall with abundant sensitivity the experience of growing up in the shadow of literary celebrity. Adapted by Mr. Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala from an autobiographical novel by Kaylie Jones, daughter of the author of ''From Here to Eternity'' and ''The Thin Red Line,'' the film describes how Charlotte Anne Willis (Leelee Sobieski) reaches her own maturity while closely watching the world of her father. He is, as James Jones could be, described as a writer of ''brutal but honest'' prose.\n\nIn a film that, like ''Jefferson in Paris'' and ''Surviving Picasso,'' creates a colorful panorama of people and places while also suffering from autobiographical sprawl, the Ivory-Jhabvala-Ismail Merchant team brings as much careful detail to this young girl's story as they have to E. M. Forster or Henry James. But with no real narrative shapeliness and a loosely anecdotal pace, ''A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries'' must rely on more than historical interest to hold attention. In Ms. Sobieski, who was only 14 when the film was made and has the cool, alert look of a younger Helen Hunt, the story finds a sympathetic adolescent heroine. But Charlotte Anne (nicknamed Channe) remains a more slender and peripheral figure than the film's wide-ranging ambitions require.\n\nIf this episodic account of Channe's formative years lacks an essential focus, it's also broad enough to accommodate a large and interesting cast in supporting roles. The film begins with the lovely French actress Virginie Ledoyen writing a message to her unborn baby, an image that will take on added meaning years later when her son arrives at Channe's home. The boy's name is Benoit, and he is welcomed in (for Channe) bewilderingly short order by her parents, Bill and Marcella Willis. As Bill, Kris Kristofferson makes a gruffly affectionate literary lion who can't easily pull off a line like ''I should be there more for you, but this book's driving me crazy.'' As Marcella, Barbara Hershey flaunts a garish exoticism that makes her the most unpredictable figure in the story.\n\nIn narrative sections that are named for three male figures around whom Channe's life revolves, the film dwells first on the events in Paris that cement Benoit's place in the Willis family. (By his own request, he is eventually renamed Billy.) Along the way, with a diarist's thoroughness, Channe notices the culture clash at her bilingual school, the boozily flirtatious circle of friends around her parents, the startling vulgarity of American children who come visit and an encounter with a budding French rapist who tries to seduce Channe with the help of large snails. (He insists that she take off her shirt and let them crawl on her skin.)\n\nAll the while, Mr. Ivory vividly conjures the family's bustling existence on the Ile St.-Louis and shows how Channe forms an important friendship in the film's middle chapter. ''I'm crazy about opera!'' exclaims Francis Fortescue, a musical prodigy with a merrily bohemian stage mother (Jane Birkin), as he blusters his way eagerly into Channe's life. Though Francis, played exuberantly by the newcomer Anthony Roth Costanzo (who does his own operatic singing), is seen only in this middle section and not heard from again, his character is treated with particular fondness and fascination. ''Like Francis, both as a small boy and later as a teen-ager,'' Mr. Ivory has said, ''I lived a life of constant self-dramatization, a fact most people meeting me now might not imagine.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
