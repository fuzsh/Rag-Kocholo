        "text": "Director Stephen Soucy Attending\n\nTheir films were perennial Oscar nominees, showcases for some of the best actors in the world, and they delighted audiences everywhere. Merchant Ivory tells the story of the incredible creative team of James Ivory, Ismail Merchant and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.\n\nFrom director Stephen Soucy comes the first definitive look at the Merchant Ivory team, which also includes composer Richard Robbins. Their films, often period dramas, redefined art house cinema. Using numerous interviews with actors and technicians, archival material and more, Merchant Ivory is not an in-depth look at these particular films, but a fascinating examination of moviemaking in general.\n\n“Merchant Ivory pulls back the curtain on the fascinating lives of everyone who was lucky enough to move in the orbit of Ismail Merchant and James Ivory and reveals how those marvelous films got made.” –Bradley Gibson, Film Threat"
