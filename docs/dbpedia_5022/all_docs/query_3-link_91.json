        "text": "Chances are, you can spot a Merchant Ivory production just from a single scene. There's often stunning cinematography, dazzling costumes, star-studded casts, a mature script and a sweeping score, all working to whisk you off your feet and immerse you in a new world.\n\nProducer Ismail Merchant and director James Ivory were life and business partners for more than 40 years, making just as many films together, several of which have ingrained themselves into the film lexicon. But it wasn't just the two of them behind hits like \"A Room With a View,\" \"Howards End\" and \"The Remains of the Day.\" With screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and composer Richard Robbins, they became a \"four-headed creature,\" as Ivory put it, that formed one of the most unique collaborations in film.\n\nPalm Springs resident and director Stephen Soucy was heavily inspired by these filmmakers, and was particularly fascinated by their relationship — so much so, that he set out to make the \"definitive look at what Merchant Ivory has done\" in cinema. It led to the documentary \"Merchant Ivory,\" which will screen at the Palm Springs International Film Festival on Jan. 6, Jan. 7 and Jan. 13.\n\n\"There was such drama that was part of that story. The Ismail and Jim piece, they were the nucleus, I guess, of Merchant Ivory, but then there were these interesting things happening around them, like Jim’s close relationship with Ruth as a co-writer … and how he worked with Ruth as a director working with a writer. There was so much there,\" Soucy said. \"Who stays with the same screenwriter for every single film? How do you navigate being partners in life, Jim and Ismail, with being partners in business?\"\n\nFor Ivory, who is so used to being behind the camera, he was \"ready to do (the documentary) and talk.\"\n\n\"When that happens and it’s over, you think, 'Oh, gosh, why didn’t I say that? Why didn’t I tell them about that?\" he said about the production. \"You always have those kinds of regrets, but apart from that, it was enjoyable enough.\"\n\nThe celebrated director will also receive a career spotlight at the Palm Springs International Film Festival with screenings of \"Quartet\" (4:45 p.m. Jan. 7 at Palm Canyon Theatre), \"Shakespeare Wallah\" (10:45 a.m. Jan. 8 at Palm Canyon Theatre), \"Maurice\" (8 p.m. Jan. 9 at Palm Canyon Theatre), \"The Bostonians\" (5:30 p.m. Jan. 12 at Regal Cinemas Palm Springs) and \"Howards End\" (7:45 p.m. Jan. 14 at Palm Canyon Theatre). Tickets can be purchased for $15 at https://psfilmfest.org.\n\nGrand tales\n\nLong before some of Merchant Ivory's most recognizable work came films shot in India like \"The Householder,\" which marked Jhabvala's first collaboration with the duo, \"Shakespeare Wallah,\" \"The Guru\" and \"Bombay Talkie.\"\n\nThose first few films stand out as some of Ivory's most cherished memories.\n\n\"It’s so long ago that it all happened, but now I like thinking about when we started out working in India. That’s where we made our first four films, and then I made another one later on there,\" Ivory said. \"We worked in a lot of different countries, and I have very good memories of all the different places that we did work, but I particularly like now thinking about India.\"\n\nMany of those first films might come as a surprise to audience members, as Merchant Ivory Productions was more known for its period pieces set in the United Kingdom. Those films have also led to some confusion with the director himself. Ivory said many people assume he's from England, but he grew up in Oregon.\n\n\"They overshadow the work we did in other countries, even the United States. I made a lot of American films, I’ve made more French films than English ones, but still they stick to 'The Remains of the Day' and 'Howards End' and 'A Room With a View,'\" Ivory said. \"Which is fine, I like all those films, I’m happy with them, I wouldn’t change a moment of any of them, but it’s a pity that they know less about my other films in other places, especially in the United States and India.\"\n\nAs \"Merchant Ivory\" tells the story of the core four members, Soucy and editor Jon Hart decided to pair each person to a specific film − \"A Room With a View,\" \"Maurice,\" \"Howards End\" and \"The Remains of the Day.\" Interviews with cast and crew members from those films and other Merchant Ivory productions are included in the documentary as well, including stars Helena Bonham Carter, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant and Vanessa Redgrave.\n\n\"A Room With a View,\" starring Bonham Carter, Julian Sands, Maggie Smith, Daniel Day-Lewis and Judi Dench, follows a young woman, Lucy Honeychurch (Bonham Carter), who travels to Venice for the summer and falls in love with a free-spirited young man. The film was a huge success for Merchant Ivory, earning three Academy Awards, and Bonham Carter called it \"the first commercial hit for costume dramas.\"\n\nIvory's next film, \"Maurice,\" came as a surprise for many. Adapted from E. M. Forster's novel of the same name, it is a love story between two men. Producer Paul Bradley questioned why Merchant Ivory decided to make \"Maurice,\" especially as they had the world at their feet following the success of their previous film. But it came at a time when the AIDS crisis was raging on and homophobic attacks and commercials were common in the UK.\n\n\"I really thought it was so important to note Jim’s dogged determination to get 'Maurice' made after 'A Room With a View.' It was a very bold choice,\" Soucy said. \"I think we know why Jim made that film because at the time that film needed to be made. It was one of the first gay love stories with a happy ending.\"\n\nSoucy recalled that he first saw the film on a VHS tape, but its impact was still grand for him — as it was for many gay men who saw it in the 1980s.\n\nMore than just uncovering the relationships between the four key players, Soucy wanted to preserve cinema history with \"Merchant Ivory.\"\n\n\"I really felt that the Merchant Ivory story is one thing, but then it's also the Merchant Ivory productions, film after film, the 44 films that they did,\" Soucy said. \"Jim being the anchor of the film, he’s the last one with us of the four, and just being able to have his voice to talk about their story and what they did, I just felt like I had to do it for that reason.\"\n\n'They got it done'\n\nAs glamorous as Merchant Ivory films look, the production process was often plagued with budget issues and tough conditions, as Soucy uncovers in the documentary.\n\nMany of the talking head interviews reveal that people weren't always getting paid on time, and Grant, who was in \"Maurice,\" also questioned where funds were coming from. Actress Thompson, who starred in \"Howards End\" and \"The Remains of the Day,\" said that being on a Merchant Ivory film required a lot of stamina, and at the end of every movie everyone said, \"never again.\" However, people kept coming back.\n\n\"What I was most blown away by and impressed by is the fact that Ismail and Jim, Ismail gets more credit for this, but anything that they set out to do, he brought it over the finish line. I think we’ve all talked to people and friends who have artistic ambitions, and maybe they have an idea for a film and they start that idea, but maybe it falls apart at some point or they let it go,\" Soucy said. \"But one of the things I’m so impressed about the Merchant Ivory story is that even if they only had a third of the budget that they needed when the cameras were rolling, they got it done.\"\n\nDespite some tough moments, many of the cast and crew members look back fondly on the films they worked on. Bonham Carter and Thompson credit Merchant Ivory for giving them their big breaks, and Thompson won a best actress Academy Award for \"Howards End.\"\n\nEven Soucy said Ivory gave him a chance with \"Merchant Ivory.\" Soucy had only done short films, including \"Rich Atmosphere: The Music of Merchant Ivory Films,\" which he said impressed Ivory. He decided to approach the legendary filmmaker about a documentary, and Ivory \"took a chance on me.\"\n\nDuring their time together, Soucy said he's learned a lot from Ivory about filmmaking, like the importance of working with a core team and trusting your instinct.\n\nLooking back and forward\n\nHaving a spotlight on his films at the Palm Springs International Film Festival is a sentimental moment for the director, who lived in the desert city as a teenager.\n\nIvory said his mother had to live in a warmer climate for some time, thus leading to the family's move to Palm Springs. He attended Nellie N. Coffman Middle School.\n\n\"That was a great place to land when you’re 13 years old. So many things opened up,\" Ivory said. \"I’d always gone to a parochial school until that time, and then I went to a very worldly junior high, which was great.\"\n\nHis time in the Coachella Valley \"made a new person out of me,\" and he wished he could have lived in the area longer.\n\nWhile many of his classic films will be screened at the festival, Ivory recommends viewers also seek out his lesser-known films, like \"Jefferson in Paris,\" \"Mr. & Mrs. Bridge\" and \"A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries.\" He called those films \"some of my best work.\"\n\nIvory will not be able to attend the festival, but Soucy said he flew out to shoot opening remarks with the director, which will play ahead of each film.\n\n\"My thought when I got there was we'll do maybe one or two different setups, and he was like, 'No, let's do five different setups,' and he was running all over the house,\" Soucy shared. \"You can't get the director out of Jim.\"\n\nThe final Merchant Ivory film he directed was \"The City of Your Final Destination\" in 2009. When asked if he still wants to be in the director's chair, Ivory said he's not sure he'd have the \"energy and strength to do it,\" especially with how much has changed in the world of filmmaking over the years.\n\nBut that doesn't mean he's entirely done gifting audiences with films. In 2017, he adapted André Aciman's novel, \"Call Me By Your Name,\" for director Luca Guadagnino's film of the same name. The film follows 17-year-old Elio (Timothée Chalamet) as he falls in love with his father's graduate-student assistant (Armie Hammer) set in 1983 Italy. Ivory won an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay.\n\nIf a project came along that Ivory liked, he said he would likely write the script. At the moment, however, there isn't anything in the works.\n\nHow to watch\n\nWhat: \"Merchant Ivory\" screenings at the Palm Springs International Film Festival\n\nWhen and where: 4:30 p.m. Jan. 6 at the Annenberg Theater; 12:30 p.m. Jan. 7 at Regal Cinemas Palm Springs; and 10:15 a.m. Jan. 13 at Regal Cinemas Palm Springs\n\nCost: $15\n\nMore info: https://psfilmfest.org\n\nEma Sasic covers entertainment and health in the Coachella Valley.
