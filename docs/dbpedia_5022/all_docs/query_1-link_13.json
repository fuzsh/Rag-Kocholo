        "text": "The 167th Best Director of All-Time: James Ivory\n\nIvory. James Ivory is the director of the Merchant Ivory brand- and it is a brand- a clear and distinct style and taste. Ismail Merchant is the producer and James Ivory is most often credited with being the artistic creative engine of the partnership (not totally unlike the Archers – Powell/Pressburger with Michael Powell getting the bulk of the artistic credit). It shouldn’t go without mention that the majority of their work as from the screenwriting pen of Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (which may seem odd because Ivory is a heck of a screenwriter himself and just won the Oscar for his work on Guadagnino’s Call Me By Your Name). They made polished period films, sophisticated literary adaptations with brilliant costume design work and acting. They weren’t often directed with great flair and bravado (a few exceptions in their best work) but there’s a uniformity and depth here in the body of work worth rewarding. They have nine archiveable films, two that land in the top 100 of their respective decade and again, per the “brand” comment—James Ivory is no hired-handed who happens to make intelligent films—he makes Merchant/Ivory films!\n\nBest film: Howards End\n\nIt’s peak Merchant/Ivory- A Room With a View is there, too\n\nHandsomely mounted by Ivory, Oscar-Winning script from Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, and the cast is phenomenal- Redgrave is great in her small role, Bonham Carter- wow—but it’s Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins that are really revelatory. She won the Oscar here and Hopkins is in an incredible stretch and late-career renaissance started by Silence of the Lambs the year before\n\nSet direction- Oscar win as well\n\nFirst of four merchant/ivory collaborations with Hopkins\n\nI adore the silent opening- classical music- Redgrave walking the grounds of her splendidly gorgeous Howards End—floral arrangements, looking lovingly at her family in the windows\n\nSimon Callow- one of four archiveable films with Merchant Ivory (this, Maurice, Room With a View, Mr.& Mrs. Bridge)\n\nNatural lighting by the window- like the climax romance kiss at A Room With a View\n\nRedgrave is anomalous- almost other worldly—but she’s immensely likeable here- which she rarely is throughout her career even when she gives a great performance.\n\nMassive set design period set pieces—Christmas shopping, train station- so well detailed\n\nThompson so good-natured—love seeing her win for playing a character\n\nIvory throws away his trademark two awful wipe edits in a film trademark and goes with some really nice dissolves here- much more fitting his visual style\n\nJaw-droppingly beautiful floral sequences—the bluebells in the surrealism sequence of Samuel West’s Leonard Bast escaping his desk\n\nThese are brilliant intellectual sisters—piques the interest of Bast stuck with his earlier lover—it’s such a sympathetic tragedy\n\nThe Wilcox children are largely just awful—not bad acting or bad characters- just hard to stomach— as is some of Bonham Carter’s impertinence and spirit\n\nThere’s such wonderful narrative form- the rug from Thompson and Bonham Carter fits Howards end—\n\nSlow-motion shot of Charles Wilcox carried into the carriage at the end\n\nHighly Recommend/ Must-See—leaning Must-See- a to 5 of the year quality film\n\ntotal archiveable films: 9\n\ntop 100 films: 0\n\ntop 500 films: 0\n\ntop 100 films of the decade: 2 (A Room With a View, Howards End)\n\nmost overrated: Nothing here for Ivory. They have zero films sadly in the TSPDT top 1000. I’m surprised. I thought The Remains of the Day would be there for sure. If you expand it to the TSPDT consensus top 2000 it’ll include A Room With a View and The Remains of the Day– but shockingly no Howards End– which is why….\n\nmost underrated: … Howards End is wildly underrated. It’s easily in my top 1000 and doesn’t land in the TSPDT top 2000 as I was saying above. The acting, writing are sublime—but the massive set design set pieces (Christmas shopping, train station) and the set piece of Howards End itself (in that magnificent opening with Redgrave) make it, indeed, very cinematic.\n\ngem I want to spotlight : Mr. and Mrs. Bridge\n\nIt’s a strong bounce-back for Merchant/Ivory after 1989’s Slaves of New York\n\nFeatures real life husband and wife Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward- Woodward is nominated here but they’re both superb\n\nStrong period piece study of an affluent Midwestern family—practicality and conservatism\n\nmade at the most fertile period artistically for Merchant Ivory\n\nWoodward plays the naïve, well-intentioned but often nattering housewife=– she’s painfully sheltered and captive\n\nStrong mise-en-scene—wallpaper and period detail- really a gorgeous film- I love the Papier-mâché at the school dance which is shown with a reverse tracking shot like a Curtiz slow-tracking establishing shot\n\nKansas WASP- “the city can be the devil”, Eagle scouts,\n\n“meticulously detailed”- Ebert\n\nTrip to France- gorgeous churches, stunning, museums, tapestries\n\n“why don’t these artists get jobs like everyone else and then they can paint on the weekends”- haha\n\nBlythe Danner and Simon Callow in small roles- great- add color and verboseness\n\nIt’s almost Sirkian—fall leaves, American suburbia—décor—dueling twin beds for the married couple\n\nSexuality and nudity which is always nodded to in Merchant Ivory- here in the young son’s magazine\n\nThe film has aged fantastically\n\nHate the two sloppy wipe edits- another, sadly, trademark from Ivory\n\nFamily vignettes- reminded me of Fanny and Alexander\n\nGenerational dissonance\n\nNewman plays a very hard man—and Woodward’s performance starts out as a bit of a parody but it comes full circle—the breakdown with the son- it’s a layered performance- strong—the car stuck in the garage is a great metaphor for her helplessness\n\nstylistic innovations/traits:\n\nMerchant Ivory means period piece to most people- elevated material, great acting\n\nPolished literary adaptations, always handsomely mounted – naysayer would call this “stuffy” and uncinematic and though some of their work suffers from that- their best have impeccable mise-en-scene and clearly have as much care in the set and costume design as the words chosen from and adapted from the literary material\n\nPeriod films, travel, elitist, décor and costume\n\nOften the discussion of sex, love, generational disconnection, art—in Shakespeare Wallah in 1965 Ivory introduces us to the film with a bunch of sculptures and a character reading Lolita—there you go\n\nBeautiful wallpaper historical décor and detail\n\nGardens, floral\n\nBest costume 6 times nominated\n\nMerchant/Ivory trademark- a crest on the titles- importance, upper class, regal\n\nDissolve transitions in remains of the day are a nice editing touch— too often Ivory threw in these awful out of place edits that never fit and were never set up formally (traits can’t always be positive things here)\n\nLike almost all of Ivory’s film’s the ensemble is fantastic in their work- Vanessa Redgrave, Anthony Hopkins often\n\nThe quality and beauty of say Anthony Minghella. This precedes Minghella’s great trilogy of English Patient, Talented Mr. Ripley and Cold Mountain but Ivory has that sharp of an eye for attractive filmmaking- it’s a compliment—shot in super 35mm\n\nUnstuffy again—certainly not prudish—there is nudity in nearly all their films\n\nTheir big three films below, two Oscar wins for best adapted screenplay (Ruth Prawer Jhabvala), three noms, and three noms for director (Ivory) and picture (Merchant) during their heyday—their best five films come between 1985 and 1993\n\nHenry James Adaptations (at least 2) and E.M. Forster (3 I believe)\n\ntop 10\n\nHowards End\n\nA Room With a View\n\nThe Remains of the Day\n\nMr. and Mrs. Bridge\n\nMaurice\n\nHeat and Dust\n\nThe Bostonians\n\nShakespeare Wallah\n\nQuartet\n\nBy year and grades\n\n1965- Shakespeare-Wallah R 1981- Quartet R 1983- Heat and Dust 1984- Bostonians R 1985- A Room With A View HR 1987- Maurice R 1990- Mr. and Mrs. Bridge R 1992- Howards End HR/MS 1993- The Remains of the Day R/HR\n\n*MP is Masterpiece- top 1-3 quality of the year film\n\nMS is Must-see- top 5-6 quality of the year film\n\nHR is Highly Recommend- top 10 quality of the year film\n\nR is Recommend- outside the top 10 of the year quality film but still in the archives\n\nShare This Story, Choose Your Platform!\n\nRelated Posts"
