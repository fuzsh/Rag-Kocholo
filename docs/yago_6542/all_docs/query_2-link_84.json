        "text": "Français | English\n\nThe Mid­dle-East­ern Cin­e­ma Acad­e­my is an asso­ci­a­tion found­ed in 2012 in Diyarbakır in order to respond to the needs of Kur­dish movie makers.\n\nMetin Ewr, for­mer­ly in charge along with Zinar Karabaş and Rojhi­lat Aksoy, cur­rent­ly direct­ing the acad­e­my, agreed to answer our questions.\n\nCould you intro­duce yourselves?\n\nMetin Ewr: I start­ed work­ing in the cin­e­ma through TV series, in 2009 when I arrived in Amed. I’m a scriptwriter. I wrote texts for the the­ater pri­or to that, in the Mesopotami­an Cul­tur­al Cen­ter’s the­ater in Adana. At the same time, I led work­shops in script writ­ing, direct­ing and act­ing. When I came here, the series Ax û Jiyan was about to be shot. Kur­dis­tan has been sub­ject­ed to a cul­tur­al geno­cide. In films, Kurds were in the back­ground and shown in a neg­a­tive way. We then decid­ed “if a film or a series must be shot, we are the ones who know our own real­i­ty best, so let’s do it our­selves”. It was a total­ly Kur­dish shoot for the first time, from the team direct­ing to the actors. The char­ac­ters, the sto­ry, every­thing was Kur­dish. We pro­duced 52 episodes. Then we man­aged to keep the team togeth­er and found­ed the Mid­dle-East­ern Cin­e­ma Asso­ci­a­tion. From there, we have con­duct­ed our cin­e­mato­graph­ic activ­i­ties. Our objec­tive was to devel­op alter­na­tive cin­e­ma and Kur­dish cin­e­ma simul­ta­ne­ous­ly. Because the sit­u­a­tion is such in Turkey that those who want to make films get no State sup­port or are even kept from doing so. We wished to be an open door as a rem­e­dy. We sup­port projects that offer a cin­e­ma that does not humil­i­ate women, chil­dren, nature but who respects them instead.\n\nZinar Karabaş : I’ve been work­ing at the Mid­dle-East­ern Cin­e­ma Acad­e­my since 2015. I became part of a sys­tem already set up. I arrived at a time when the most impor­tant steps were being tak­en, right in the mid­dle of a big pro­duc­tion project. At first, I was sur­prised by the dif­fi­cul­ties caused by work­ing in a cli­mate bring­ing vis­i­bil­i­ty to Kur­dish cin­e­ma. Arriv­ing in a heav­i­ly sig­nif­i­cant sit­u­a­tion con­fused me at first. I took part in it and devel­oped the aware­ness of what we could bring to Kur­dish cin­e­ma lat­er, by being a part of it. Enter­ing in such a seri­ous project, I real­ized it was a dif­fi­cult approach. You’ve grown up with Turk­ish cin­e­ma, world cin­e­ma. With all that, you’ve devel­oped a cer­tain inter­nal aware­ness and then, you work in Kur­dish cin­e­ma. In this way, you end up being in con­flict with your­self: it’s a shock but which allows for the under­stand­ing of cer­tain things… All that improves over time. The Acad­e­my’s aim is per­haps to cre­ate this shock in peo­ple, to push them into a jour­ney that will make them progress in their own aware­ness. In Bakur, we are one of the few alter­na­tive cin­e­ma asso­ci­a­tions. As peo­ple come and go, we attempt to safe­guard the mem­o­ry of the work done. Under­stand­ing what we do and main­tain­ing this mem­o­ry are also part of the Acad­e­my’s objec­tives. In attempt­ing to keep the Acad­e­my alive, we have the pos­si­bil­i­ty of form­ing the peo­ple who come to it through what we do. More­o­ev­er, you find your­self in a posi­tion where you are con­stant­ly learn­ing yourself.\n\nRojhi­lat Aksoy : I grew up in Istan­bul. It all began by meet­ing friends from over here after uni­ver­si­ty, at a time of film­ing the series Ax û Jiyan. Real­iz­ing this series in Kur­dish impressed me. The friends asked me if I want­ed to stay and work here. But at the time, I still had in mind plans for stud­ies, work, a career… I was ill pre­pared to the idea of doing some­thing for our cause even though my fam­i­ly has always been part of the strug­gle for the safe­guard­ing of iden­ti­ty in Istan­bul. But then I told myself, “why not?”. Instead of going back to Istan­bul and work­ing somewhere…The notion of this Kur­dish cin­e­ma moved me. With this series, I saw how use­ful telling one’s own sto­ries could be.\n\nWe have been work­ing for 8 years. Fes­ti­vals, short and full-length films, documentaries…The asso­ci­a­tion does not only man­age its own projects. It is open to all the peo­ples liv­ing in Turkey. Fes­ti­vals offer the oppor­tu­ni­ty for meet­ings with oth­er film mak­ers. Oth­er ini­tia­tives exist­ed pri­or to our asso­ci­a­tion, for exam­ple, Aram Tigran, with­in the Met­ro­pol­i­tan City Hall of Diyarbakır, Cigerxwin in Kara­pı­nar offer­ing teach­ing at high­er grades. The asso­ci­a­tion was born lat­er. In Istan­bul there was the Mesopotamia Col­lec­tive, Yapım 13. In Kur­dis­tan, the Cin­e­ma Acad­e­my became active as an asso­ci­a­tion in 2012 and has trans­formed itself into a space where Kur­dish film mak­ers meet and strug­gle to cre­ate their own cinema.\n\nWhat are you work­ing on currently?\n\nRojhi­lat: Giv­en the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion, our work is a bit restrict­ed. The asso­ci­a­tion fin­ished the series Ax û Jiyan, fol­lowed by a dra­mat­ic series of 13 episodes, Ref. Then Mari­na, a sit-com. This was also a series in which the direc­tors, tech­ni­cians, and actors were Kurds. Fol­low­ing this series, a film, 14 Tem­muz (July 14) was pro­duced under Haşim Aydemir’s direc­tion. This was our first fea­ture-length film, fol­lowed by a sec­ond one Böğürtlen Zamanı (Mul­ber­ry Sea­son). Dis­tri­b­u­tion and entry in fes­ti­vals will cer­tain­ly occur this year for this lat­ter film. Then we made short films and doc­u­men­taries. They were rather small­er projects because with the nam­ing of admin­is­tra­tors (kayyım) in the city halls , some things have changed.\n\nFor instance?\n\nRojhi­lat: We orga­nized fes­ti­vals with city halls, such as the Amed Inter­na­tion­al Film Fes­ti­val, the Amed Doc­u­men­tary Film Fes­ti­val, the Axdama­ra Film Fes­ti­val in Van, the Yıl­maz Güney Fes­ti­val in Bat­man… These fes­ti­vals pro­vid­ed spaces in which film mak­ers could meet, Kur­dish cin­e­ma could obtain vis­i­bil­i­ty, oppo­si­tion cin­e­ma could be screened. With the arrival of the admin­is­tra­tors, our finan­cial means were reduced. By obtain­ing aids and fund­ing from abroad, we orga­nize work­shops, we also man­aged to put togeth­er the 7th edi­tion of the Amed Film Fes­ti­val by col­lect­ing funds here and there. Recent­ly, we had pre­pared the Yıl­maz Güney Film Fes­ti­val which was sup­posed to take place in Bat­man but, in the end, an admin­is­tra­tor was named at city hall there also. Our prepa­ra­tions were stopped. Because in select­ing con­tent, our choic­es go most­ly to alter­na­tive cin­e­ma, rather oppo­si­tion­al, using Kur­dish, the tongue of “the oth­ers” and it becomes dif­fi­cult to set up this type of ini­tia­tive when an admin­is­tra­tor is named to city hall.\n\nWe cur­rent­ly have sup­port com­ing from Cat­alo­nia. We will be con­duct­ing work­shops dur­ing a year in cin­e­ma, music, the­ater, paint­ing, with chil­dren, youth and women. We recent­ly made a short film direct­ed by Ilhan Bakir and anoth­er by Metin Ewr, we still need to final­ize post-production.\n\nHow do you organize?\n\nMetin: We are a group of vol­un­teers. Here, every­thing is done col­lec­tive­ly. From the from the Board of admin­is­tra­tion to the every­day tasks, we pur­sue a col­lec­tive approach. We see this place both as a train­ing venue and one where we attempt to devel­op our cin­e­ma. When we start on a project, we do so togeth­er in dis­trib­ut­ing the work. Some of us have spe­cial­iza­tions, for instance, I usu­al­ly han­dle scriptwrit­ing, oth­er friends han­dle the admin­is­tra­tion, and oth­ers the cam­era work. But when required, the direc­tor can become a light­ing or a sound tech­ni­cian, the scriptwrit­ers can clean the premis­es. The roles are shared and when a void appears, we fill it. In fact, we don’t have a mind­set where each per­son would han­dle one spe­cif­ic thing. Every­thing is done together.\n\nCan you share a few shoot­ing experiences?\n\nZinar: The hard­es part is cre­at­ing a col­lec­tive envi­ron­ment on the set, cre­at­ing the lan­guage set­ting us apart from the clas­si­cal cin­e­ma sec­tor… It’s some­thing like gueril­la cin­e­ma, each of us grabs one end, we help one anoth­er. The last short film was hard. It’s our sec­ond shoot dur­ing the pan­dem­ic which impos­es rules, and men­tal­i­ties and sit­u­a­tions in flux. Every­thing can eas­i­ly become con­fused. Per­haps com­mer­cial cin­e­ma very quick­ly adapt­ed to this, or since they have a work-cen­tered approach, the fact one per­son becomes ills is of no par­tic­u­lar con­cern because he or she can be replaced and the show goes on. Here, things are dif­fer­ent, more del­i­cate. If some­one falls sick because of us, because of some­thing we wish to cre­ate, if some­thing hap­pens to some­one… fatigue takes over at times, espe­cial­ly intel­lec­tu­al­ly. The fact of film­ing in Sur keeps you under con­stant pres­sure. This is relat­ed to the theme of what we are filming…Yes, we have autho­riza­tions but over there, you are under sur­veil­lance and can be stopped at any moment. Over there, even with offi­cial autho­riza­tions, you are not nec­es­sar­i­ly pro­tect­ed. There is also the pres­sure of artis­tic creation.\n\nIs film­ing in Kur­dish some­thing impor­tant for you?\n\nThey laugh and all say “yes” at the same time.\n\nMetin: Of course. Because you have expe­ri­enced assim­i­la­tion, the erad­i­ca­tion of your cul­ture, you have been denied. In Bakur, until 1995 there were no Kur­dish edi­tions at all. It was for­bid­den. You could not speak Kur­dish at school. In vil­lages deep in Kur­dis­tan, teach­ers were named who did not speak a sin­gle word of Kur­dish. The chil­dren were all Kurds and did­n’t speak Turk­ish. But the teacher in the school, is the rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the State, of assim­i­la­tion, she puts togeth­er a pun­ish­ment sys­tem for the pupils who speak in Kur­dish. You go to the bank, you can’t speak it, in admin­is­tra­tive ser­vices, you can’t, your inter­locu­tor would­n’t even answer you. Even in the fam­i­ly, you feel the oppres­sion. Your iden­ti­ty, your cul­ture, your lan­guage are denied. You expe­ri­ence all this and to this day you go on pay­ing the price for it…\n\nIn 1995, Turgut Özal, then Pres­i­dent of the Repub­lic said dur­ing an inter­view, “so what, my grand­moth­er also speaks Kur­dish”. Fol­low­ing these words which were not even an offi­cial dec­la­ra­tion, a Kur­dish news­pa­per saw the light of day. In order to express your­self, you must use your own tongue. Even today, I have prob­lems when I speak in Turk­ish. It’s dif­fer­ent with Kur­dish. What I expe­ri­ence, I expe­ri­ence in my own lan­guage, so I can best express it that way.\n\nSo, begin­ning in 1995, works in Kur­dish start­ed being pub­lished. And Kur­dish artis­tic cre­ation pro­gressed along­side this. With the open­ing of the Mesopotamia Cul­tur­al Cen­ter (MKM), artis­tic and cul­tur­al activ­i­ties began in the moth­er tongue. When you put the ques­tion to us today…it’s a bit like tak­ing the med­i­cine appro­pri­ate to what ails you: you cre­ate accord­ing to what you feel. Your coun­try is under occu­pa­tion, you are sub­ject­ed to a cul­tur­al geno­cide, your free­dom is con­fis­cat­ed, you are nec­es­sar­i­ly going to express all that through your art. You will express what con­cerns you. Even if you keep me from doing so, even if you deny me, I will do it anyway…Our most recent short film, on Kur­dish media, spoke about that also. Because there exists a for­bid­den press, a for­bid­den tongue, a for­bid­den peo­ple. It is the sto­ry of a press organ which throws the light on the real­i­ty expe­ri­enced by our peo­ple who pay a heavy price for this, dozens of jour­nal­ists, cor­re­spon­dents, dis­trib­u­tors were assas­si­nat­ed. We must be aware of these things, we must keep them in our mem­o­ry. These things are not for­got­ten, you feel them, you come across them all the time. Today, now that tech­nol­o­gy is so advanced, that the whole world knows about every­thing, schools teach­ing in Kur­dish, insti­tu­tions offer­ing course in Kur­dish are shut down, again, Kur­dish media are being shut down…This assim­i­la­tion is ongo­ing today before the eyes of the world. There­fore, we shall car­ry on.\n\nWhich was the first Kur­dish film in your opinion?\n\nMetin: The cin­e­ma sec­tion opened in the MKM in Istan­bul in the nineties. Our cin­e­ma began around that time…We’re slow­ly mov­ing forward.\n\nRojhi­lat: Before us, in Turk­ish cin­e­ma, there were pro­duc­tions ori­ent­ed toward the Kurds such as Mem û Zin, Siyabend û Haxe… When Yıl­maz Güney shot Yol, Sürü, they were also sto­ries about Kurds but the film’s orig­i­nal lan­guage was not Kur­dish. Because when the film is in Kur­dish, it can encounter prob­lems with Turk­ish author­i­ties. In Istan­bul, Yapım 13 served as an advance, again in the nineties, with the films Bahus, Afla and others.\n\nYıl­maz Güney is a Kur­dish film mak­er, but his films are in Turkish…\n\nRojhil­hat: Yes but the sto­ries are Kurdish.\n\nMetin: The lan­guage is Turk­ish. But if we look at the theme, at the characters…\n\nRojhil­hat: The geog­ra­phy…\n\nMetin: In those days, Kur­dish was for­bid­den. And Yıl­maz Güney was one of the first to film in Bakur… When you look at the con­tent, they are Kur­dish films. Only the lan­guage is miss­ing. He was a pop­u­lar film mak­er, noto­ri­ous, so the Turks say he belongs to Turk­ish cin­e­ma. But in his inter­views, his state­ments, he expressed who he is and what he want­ed to do. When he made some of his films, he was in prison. He direct­ed his films from prison. The scenes were shot and brought to him and he could pro­vide his direc­tives in this way.\n\nRojhi­lat: Yıl­maz Güney says he is Kur­dish but he adds that he makes… Turk­ish films. Per­haps this is because of the absence of a State, one can­not speak of a Kur­dish cin­e­ma, a “nation­al” cin­e­ma. Per­haps Yıl­maz Güney could have made his films in Kur­dish. But they would have been for­bid­den, they would not have been dis­trib­uted every­where in the world, he prob­a­bly would­n’t be as famous in Turkey. He also worked as an actor in Yeşilçam . He said in the reportages that it was a mon­ey-mak­ing ven­ture, to make him­self known, find his place in the film world, become a pro­duc­er who could make his own films on Kur­dis­tan. For instance, I think it was in Yol… you could see a sign read­ing “Kur­dis­tan” for a moment and that film was for­bid­den for a long time. It’s a risk for film makers…Under assim­i­la­tion poli­cies, it is very hard to work in your mater­nal tongue. The State uses Kurds in its poli­cies, but there is no offi­cial recog­ni­tion. That’s pre­cise­ly what Kurds are fight­ing for. When Halil Dağ was mak­ing Berî­tan he man­aged to cre­ate his own cin­e­ma and his own cin­e­mato­graph­ic expres­sion with “resis­tance cin­e­ma”, far from these fears, in a free cli­mate, on free lands. How was this film dis­trib­uted in Turkey? I was small but I remem­ber, the film arriv­ing with lead­ers of the Kur­dish par­ty of those days and it was shown secrete­ly. It was impos­si­ble to fea­ture a Kur­dish film in a cinema.\n\nWe made July 14 in 2017 . Since it is a film about the pris­ons, there is Kur­dish spo­ken as well as Turk­ish. It was impos­si­ble to show the film in a cin­e­ma or to dis­trib­ute it via the Cul­ture min­istry. In South­ern Kur­dis­tan [Irak], the film made it to a cin­e­ma but the author­i­ties for­bade the screen­ing. Even though this is an autonomous Kur­dish fed­er­a­tion, the screen­ing was stopped due to Turkey’s influ­ence over there.\n\nMak­ing films in the mater­nal lan­guage in Turkey is still very dif­fi­cult. For instance, recent­ly we made a short film. We car­ried out the admin­is­tra­tive pro­ce­dures in Turk­ish. Had we done them in Kur­dish, we would not have obtained the required autho­riza­tions. In the spir­it of “resis­tance cin­e­ma”, we look out for means. We set up the files for films in Turk­ish or we sub­mit the project for anoth­er film. Because even if the film is in Turk­ish, if the theme is polit­i­cal, secu­ri­ty forces con­sid­er it must be for­bid­den. We look for alter­na­tive ways and means to bring our projects to fruition. Yet, when we sub­mit one project and make anoth­er, this means addi­tion­al pres­sure on us. Because even if you obtained autho­riza­tions, you are film­ing secretely…\n\nDur­ing the “res­o­lu­tion peri­od” , sev­er­al films were made such as Kla­ma Dayi­ka Min (My moth­er’s song), Dengê Bavê Min (My father’s voice) but those are also half in Turk­ish, half in Kur­dish. Kur­dish film mak­ers and pro­duc­ers attempt to make their films with­out encoun­ter­ing prob­lems with the Min­istry of Cul­ture, and not “dis­turb­ing” the State polit­i­cal­ly. Which means they don’t say “it’s for­bid­den, so we stop”. They fight, they encounter problems…For exam­ple only recent­ly, Kazım Öz made his film Zer for which he even obtained the sup­port of the Turk­ish Min­istry of Cul­ture. The sto­ry was about a char­ac­ter in search of his iden­ti­ty and the film showed his expe­ri­ence in Der­sim. In one scene, the char­ac­ter met a group of fight­ers there. The Min­istry of Cul­ture pro­hib­it­ed this film. So Kazam Öz who is a Kur­dish film mak­er in an oppo­si­tion­al stance and who car­ries out his strug­gle this way, replaced this sequence with a black­out indi­cat­ing that the scene had been cen­sored. It was a way of protest­ing against censorship.\n\nKazım Öz’ filmsare avail­able with French sub-titles at the Bre­tagne & Diver­sité cinémathèque\n\nIs there an audi­ence for Kur­dish cinema?\n\nRojhi­lat: Of course. Recent Kur­dish films were screened before the arrival of the admin­is­tra­tors in the city halls. The fes­ti­vals we orga­nized over 8 years were fol­lowed drew a lot of inter­est and attract­ed sub­stan­tial audi­ences of most­ly young people.\n\nMetin : This shows the impor­tance of our asso­ci­a­tion… For exam­ple, you make a film but you can­not show it to an audi­ence. This is true not only for Kur­dish films, it holds true for all alter­na­tive and oppo­si­tion­al cin­e­ma. There are cin­e­mas avail­able but the dis­trib­u­tors don’t want to screen the films, for fear of a police raid, or oth­er prob­lems. With the fes­ti­val we orga­nized via our asso­ci­a­tion, we could ride over the bar­ri­ers. Because the audi­ence is there with a great poten­tial. An audi­ence thirst­ing for Kur­dish cin­e­ma because they see some­thing of them­selves in it. The screen­ings are always full, whether it takes place in a hall or in oth­er spaces such as parks or gar­dens. At a cer­tain peri­od we even had a cin­e­ma where we could screen alter­na­tive films.\n\nDo you have thoughts about how to make cin­e­ma avail­able to a wide audi­ence in Kurdistan?\n\nRojhi­lat : We pay par­tic­u­lar atten­tion to bring­ing films to audi­ences who can­not go to cin­e­mas. We con­sid­er cin­e­ma must move out­side the four walls, so we attempt to widen the spaces. For instance, since halls screen­ing Kur­dish films are few, when we orga­nize fes­ti­vals we usu­al­ly have a pub­lic com­ing from large towns. But a moth­er, a youth in a vil­lage, they can’t take advan­tage of it. So, at each fes­ti­val, we also pro­vid­ed open air screen­ings in vil­lages. Lack of finan­cial means keeps a part of the pop­u­la­tion away from cin­e­mas. It can­not come so you must go toward it. We made this manda­to­ry with the fes­ti­vals. But for the past two years, we haven’t been able to fol­low through because of the poli­cies of the State admin­is­tra­tors in the city halls, no longer financ­ing us. This is suf­fo­cat­ing us…\n\nHow does the State impede your action?\n\nRojhi­lat: The film Bakur was con­demned . Cin­e­mas were fined for screen­ing Nû jîn (New Life). Kur­dish films are avail­able but in order to screen them, you must be will­ing to take risks, includ­ing that of being impris­oned. Oppo­si­tion cin­e­ma in Turkey, films that talk about Arme­ni­ans, Syr­i­acs, Yazidis are sub­ject­ed to exact­ly the same prob­lems. Per­haps our asso­ci­a­tion dis­played a bit more courage than oth­ers. This also explains its noto­ri­ety. Some­times, film mak­ers con­tact­ed us ask­ing “could you at least screen this film?”… For instance Ban­ga Roj (Call of the day) a doc­u­men­tary about the return of guer­ril­la fight­ers dur­ing the res­o­lu­tion peri­od. There were no screen­ings out­side our fes­ti­vals. Bakur was sched­uled dur­ing con­ven­tion­al fes­ti­vals in Istan­bul, in Ankara, its show­ing cre­at­ed huge ten­sions in the teams orga­niz­ing the fes­ti­val. It was pulled from the programs…\n\nSee Bakur with Eng­lish sub-titles in the Bre­tagne & Diver­sité cinémathèque\n\nSame thing for Selim Yıldız’ doc­u­men­tary Bîra Mitêin (I remem­ber) which talks about the Robos­ki mas­sacre, it was pulled off fes­ti­val pro­grams. Dur­ing a fes­ti­val we orga­nized in Van, the police showed up and for­bade the screen­ing of the films, using the absence of exploita­tion visas as an excuse… They drew up state­ments against us, we were called up before the tri­bunal… We even­tu­al­ly received a doc­u­ment for­bid­ding half of the films on the pro­gram. We screened them any­way. Under tremen­dous pres­sure, of course.\n\nHow can you escape from such repression?\n\nRojhi­lat: In Kur­dis­tan, if you are involved in an oppo­si­tion­al activ­i­ty, you must cre­ate your own space for expres­sion. With the arrival of admin­is­tra­tors in the city halls, a num­ber of cul­tur­al asso­ci­a­tions were closed down, but also, press out­lets, pub­lish­ing hous­es, lit­er­a­ture spaces… But as Kurds have learned to fight con­stant­ly against clos­ings, restric­tions, pro­hi­bi­tions, each shut­ting down is fol­lowed by the cre­ation of a new space replac­ing the pre­vi­ous one. Resis­tance is the objec­tive. Per­haps friends involved in asso­ci­a­tions and struc­tures were arrest­ed at the time, but oth­ers took up the relay in new struc­tures. For a time, such as that of the res­o­lu­tion , you breathe a bit and you can work a bit more freely, then, things change in the State’s poli­cies, a new peri­od arrives of chaos, arrests, pro­hi­bi­tions… We are under sur­veil­lance now. If our asso­ci­a­tion were to be shut down, we would cre­ate anoth­er struc­ture. We have to do this, because we exist and we pro­duce. We are not the type to give up. And even if we did give up, those fol­low­ing us would keep on with the work. This is what we learned from the war, with the pro­hi­bi­tions. They allowed us to devel­op a way of think­ing, a log­ic that will always allow us to find alternatives…\n\nWhat can cin­e­ma pro­vide to the Kur­dish struggle?\n\nMetin: Cin­e­ma allows the spread­ing of a peo­ple’s think­ing and lan­guage. It is the visu­al trans­mis­sion of what you wish to express. If you want to make a peo­ple’s cin­e­ma, you must put that peo­ple’s real­i­ty forward.\n\nZinar: Oth­er film mak­ers crit­i­cize us a lot. “Go beyond pure pro­pa­gan­da films, beyond polit­i­cal films, you don’t widen your scope enough, you always express your­selves with­in that frame­work,” they say. Yes, cin­e­ma is a very wide space of expres­sion, but that is our focus. Polit­i­cal films or films about top­ics inspired by dif­fer­ent expe­ri­ences, of life, of nature, of women… films that project these real­i­ties back to the viewer.\n\nMetin: Is not the artist the mir­ror of soci­ety? The artist must put for­ward what that soci­ety needs. Then, you are in a full, com­plete strug­gle. You can­not deal with top­ics inde­pen­dent­ly from this.\n\nKurds are mas­sa­cred and denied con­stant­ly. You have no iden­ti­ty. Until the 70s in the metrop­o­lis, they called us “Kurds with tails”. My father told me how he had gone to work in cen­tral Ana­to­lia. He said “I see some­one turn­ing around me. I ask him what he’s doing. He asks me ‘where is your tail?” This is what they were told about us.” We are now in the 20s of this cen­tu­ry and we are still oppressed, attempts are still made to con­fis­cate our free­dom. Your iden­ti­ty, your lan­guage are still being denied. Your insti­tu­tions are shut down. If you expe­ri­ence all this, you are going to fight against it in your cin­e­ma, your the­ater, your music, your paint­ing, your sculp­ture… If the artist is aware, if he or she is a mir­ror for the peo­ple, this is what he or she must express. Because it is the real­i­ty and you must hold it up for all eyes to see. This is a need. Like hunger. This is what peo­ple ask of you…\n\nRojhi­lat: How to con­tribute to the strug­gle, we aks our­selves the same ques­tions. For instance, here, in Sur, in Cizre, etc, there were upris­ings in favor of auton­o­my. You want to show this strug­gle through your cam­era. There are doc­u­men­taries, short and full-length fea­ture films. The artist, the Kur­dish film mak­er, influ­enced by the strug­gle, does these things naturally.\n\nTake the Roja­va rev­o­lu­tion, for instance. Sev­er­al films were made on this top­ic. Les filles du soleil (The girls of the Sun), Les sœurs d’armes (The Sis­ters in Arms), French films. No doubt impressed by the rev­o­lu­tion, those film mak­ers’ atten­tion was sud­den­ly drawn toward Roja­va. As this rev­o­lu­tion is talked about all over the world, Kur­dish film mak­ers can­not be indif­fer­ent to it. But what are their pos­si­bil­i­ties? Does a film mak­er in Roja­va have the tech­ni­cal means with which to work? Can he shoot his own sto­ries him­self? Or is he depen­dent on the out­side world? A for­eign pro­duc­tion comes on loca­tion to shoot a film using the rev­o­lu­tion as its top­ic and we, the Kurds, look at this film, and feel embar­rassed: the fact that the style smacks of Hol­ly­wood, the fact they talk about us or about a hero, inte­grat­ing him in that style…It makes you ques­tion the lev­el of knowl­edge or igno­rance of the Kur­dish lib­er­a­tion move­ment, and the film dis­turbs us. Style: Hol­ly­wood, top­ic: the Kurds, French real­iza­tion, French production…And yet, we look at it as being a part of Kur­dish cin­e­ma. As we have no nation­al cri­te­ri­on, no State, we take into account all films treat­ing of the Kurds, made any­where in the world. But to what extent are Kurds the mas­ters of their own cin­e­ma? How do the Kurds talk about them­selves? Are Kurds con­tent with being nar­rat­ed by oth­ers? No, we are not. Per­haps those films have a cer­tain impor­tance in bring­ing world atten­tion on the rev­o­lu­tion in Roja­va, to raise aware­ness, pro­vide some pub­lic­i­ty, but at the lev­el con­tent and in the way of talk­ing about rev­o­lu­tion­ar­ies, of the move­ment, we find them prob­lem­at­ic. As a Kur­dish film mak­er, these top­ics also hold my atten­tion, when a for­eign film mak­er comes and makes a film on this top­ic, it pro­duces an expres­sion we find dis­turb­ing. For this rea­son, Kur­dish film mak­ers must car­ry out their own strug­gle, devel­op their own cin­e­ma. A film mak­er, a rev­o­lu­tion­ary in Roja­va will best express his or her revolution.\n\nThere is a cin­e­ma col­lec­tive in Roja­va which orga­nized a fes­ti­val and shoots films. They made Ji Bo Azadiyê about the resis­tance in Sur . In fact, it is an ongo­ing mon­i­tor­ing of the strug­gles. The four parts of Kur­dis­tan, even though they are sub­ject­ed to oppres­sions, observe one anoth­er. A sto­ry here, in this part, may be picked up as a top­ic in anoth­er part. Cur­rent­ly a film is being shot on Kobanê. The film mak­ers told them­selves “oth­er film mak­ers have always talked about us. We must talk about our­selves.” There may be prob­lems in terms of tech­ni­cal means but as far as con­tent goes, the Kur­dish film mak­er can offer some­thing that is more authen­tic and seen through the eyes of this artist, this war, this rev­o­lu­tion will cer­tain­ly be some­thing else. We want Kurds to ori­ent their own art, their own cinema.\n\nIn Yıl­maz Güney’s films, the lan­guage was not Kur­dish. From time to time, there were lit­tle things. Names for exam­ple. Slow­ly, they have intro­duced the Kur­dish lan­guage in cin­e­ma even if it was hard to do so. For a long time we were embar­rassed by the fact that Turk­ish film mak­ers used for the Kurds the image of “peo­ple from the East, who speak a mas­sa­cred Turk­ish”. That is not even a reflec­tion of the Kur­dish lan­guage… Per­haps it is too much to ask of a Turk to inter­pret us in our tongue, but… For them, we were noth­ing but peo­ple from the East, and they showed us in their films, in their series with our “mas­sa­cred Turk­ish”. They described our sto­ries as prob­lem­at­ic. They were nar­rat­ed against a feu­dal, trib­al back­ground. This dis­turbed us and it was the rea­son why we began orga­niz­ing. When we wish to tell a Kur­dish love sto­ry, we want to do it with the Kur­dish feel­ings and lan­guage. While the Roja­va rev­o­lu­tion is ongo­ing, we want to see it and hear it through the eyes and the tongue of a Kur­dish film mak­er. Kurds must be able to cre­ate with their feel­ings, their fight­ing spir­it. With expe­ri­ence as well as con­tent, nar­ra­tion and tech­nique will devel­op and improve. And Kur­dish cin­e­ma will gain even more visibility.\n\nWatch all the Kur­dish films with French sub-titles, offered by Bre­tagne & Diversité.\n\nCin­e­ma and the wom­en’s point of view…\n\nZinar: In Kur­dish cin­e­ma, the treat­ment of women is often lim­it­ed to death, to murder…In many pro­duc­tions, the top­ic is intro­duced in a bru­tal way with a moral dimen­sion: the hon­or killings, the fact that the woman is forced to stay at home or to be assas­si­nat­ed, that she has a lim­it­ed awareness…We make a lot of efforts to sup­port Kur­dish cin­e­ma, but con­tent-wise, the same mis­takes keep on being repeat­ed. Why is it always the woman who is killed? These top­ics almost become a genre in them­selves: “Search­ing for an actress for the role of assas­si­nat­ed woman”. We need to get out of this. In fact, the cam­era lan­guage is mas­cu­line and remains lim­it­ed. The esthet­ics and the form of the films are mod­eled on this lan­guage and, some­where, this lim­its the pres­ence of women in the field. We need to open up a larg­er space, to widen the imagination…\n\nFor instance, we orga­nized a trav­el­ling ini­tia­tive, “The Days of Wom­en’s Films”. We went from one vil­lage to the next. We pro­ject­ed the film Sibel. This takes place in the Black Sea region. Despite being mute, Sibel is a strong woman. She com­muncates by whistling, espe­cial­ly with her father and her sis­ter. She is a woman respect­ful of a nature which under­stands her lan­guage, she strug­gles against the macho men­tal­i­ty, she knows what she wants, who can love, embrace or not embrace. This dimen­sion is often for­got­ten in films that talk about women…During our trav­el­ling screen­ings, we encoun­tered cer­tain prob­lems. In one bath scene, you see Sibel’s back. The audi­ence react­ed pret­ty vio­lent­ly to this scene, not tol­er­at­ing this image from a moral­i­ty point of view. You could ana­lyze the reac­tions, espe­cial­ly thanks to the chil­dren. They react­ed quick­ly and spon­ta­neous­ly, and accord­ing to the top­ics, you could pret­ty much guess the tabus in their fam­i­ly, at home. An arm, a naked back, the women turned their faces away, embarrassed…We then reached the con­clu­sion that if, the pop­u­la­tion was not offered films that con­sid­er the per­son as a human being, if we don’t make them avail­able, peo­ple with­draw with­in them­selves. What is nor­mal becomes abnor­mal. Yet, scenes of fights or taunts were con­sid­ered nor­mal by the audi­ence because they are part of the mas­cu­line men­tal­i­ty and of the dom­i­nant patri­ar­chal cul­ture. When you leave the screen­ing hall and move with your screen and your pro­jec­tor, there are pow­er­ful inter­ac­tions. You meet a much more spon­ta­neous pub­lic – not at all the same as that in con­ven­tion­al halls.\n\nAre you con­sid­er­ing a pro­duc­tion with­out men?\n\nZinar: Only with women? Yes. We’ve been think­ing about it for a long time and are attempt­ing to build the infra­struc­ture. We have to think about it, we, the women, be it on set or else­where we are a bit in the back­ground when it comes to the tech­ni­cal aspects. We are very involved in the prac­ti­cal, artis­tic and orga­ni­za­tion­al areas, in the pro­duc­tion, the con­trol room, make­up, we are often con­cen­trat­ed with­in these lim­its. As in many oth­er sec­tors, the tech­ni­cal aspects remain the men’s depart­ment. Some tech­ni­cal jobs are still pre­sent­ed as requir­ing phys­i­cal strength. Mak­ing a film only with women would be inter­est­ing. I’m curi­ous to see such a set, I think if we can pull this off, we will be more at ease in express­ing ourselves.\n\nRojhi­lat: Dur­ing this peri­od, we are attempt­ing to car­ry off more mod­est activ­i­ties. Things might change. Per­haps city halls will be regained dur­ing elec­tions in forth­com­ing years…And we can then make and offer more films, orga­nize ini­tia­tives. A con­quest, once again…Perhaps young peo­ple can con­tin­ue to pro­vide an audi­ence via inter­net. But what do they watch? Kur­dish cin­e­ma? Series? Which ones? Poli­cies impose Turk­ish pro­duc­tions on young peo­ple, this is what they watch main­ly. Our objec­tive is to bring them to watch­ing some cin­e­ma in their mater­nal lan­guage, to show them their lan­guage exists in the world of art.\n\nMetin: In Kur­dis­tan, on these lands where we live, noth­ing is unre­lat­ed to pol­i­tics, and noth­ing can be achieved with­out struggle.\n\nOur leader (Apo) says this also, “In Kur­dis­tan, with­out pol­i­tics, even the leaf can­not budge on a tree.” You only win by strug­gling. And all those strug­gles, those efforst are in order to win. If today, we can speak of a Kur­dish cin­e­ma, it is thanks to the efforst and strug­gles of Yıl­maz Güney, Halil Dağ…\n\nInter­view con­duct­ed by Loez\n\nEng­lish adap­ta­tion from the French trans­la­tion by Naz Oke\n\nIn order to con­tact the Mid­dle-East­ern Cin­e­ma Acad­e­my: sineakademi@gmail.com\n\nTranslation by Renée Lucie Bourges\n\nYou may use and share Kedistan’s articles and translations, specifying the source and adding a link in order to respect the writer(s) and translator(s) work.
