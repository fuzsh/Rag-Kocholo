        "text": "Yol is the Palme d’Or winner Yılmaz Güney film that directed by Şerif Gören in 1982 when whole Turkey was under authoritarianism after the military coup in 1980. Screenwriter Güney was in jail while Yol was filming, nevertheless, he gave the directions from there and that is why all credits go to him. The film is known as Yılmaz Güney’s best film all over the world. Yol is known as one of the most daring films in Turkish cinema history. It received great acclaim abroad but prohibited in Turkey. After 17 years of film screening, the ban was removed in 1999 and be released with the Fatoş Güney efforts.\n\n. The film is a panorama of Turkish society; inequality, discrimination, ignorance and so on… There is martial law in the country and the poor conditions in the prison have become even more unbearable. In the very beginning in the film, we see that the authority is reflected only through a voice. The authority, which is abstracted while inside, is embodied by the soldiers when we go out. Yilmaz Guney ‘s concrete opposition to the way he embodies the Yol in his own words. Radically everything in the Yol is dramatically realistic. The factors which provide this realism in the film those who contributed (cast, director, and screenwriter) Everyone was aware of the sociologic and politic situation of Turkey and their reflection into play supplied realism. We must remember that Yol is a political film. We should also note that the political stance of the Güney has turned into the political stance of the film but the political view is not in front of artistic cinematography. Furthermore, the way of telling the story of 5 prisoners’ one week is based on; state against folk conflicts in society and individualistic agency via symbols.\n\nIn the first scenes of the film in prison, power and authority crystallize on sound. The ruling authority became a voice hidden behind the invisible bodies. The transformation of authority into a sound reveals its harsh reality, that prison scene displayed the situation for main characters. Gören tells the stories of our main character in parallel. We understand how great the one-week permit is for our characters. But soon we witness the bad surprises waiting for them. At the same time, they face both their bitter reality and the realities of the country. Underlines that the outside is as disturbing as the interior director Gören. This is the message that Güney wanted to give to the audience, there is no difference between prison or normal life. For example, we see that Yusuf’s bird is used as a metaphor in the film. In addition to this, the budgerigar is one of the most striking imaginary expressions in the scenario since the bird symbolizes a life that prisoners left in outside. Even if budgerigar is in a cage, -like prisoners- it sings. The singing of the bird is high hopes of people in the prison. Güney wanted to give the all captivity of the prisoners to the bird. When we investigate anything in the movie, we got the same theme, misery. After they got permission, the story begins. The common point of those 5 prisoners was their love and people who are waiting for them but reaching them was not easy. To illustrate it, Ömer who lives in Şanlıurfa had to face with the military to live a life just like in his dreams, that necessity caused by terrorism which was active in that region. When he reached his village, he remembers and lives old beautiful memories with his friends in short-term happiness but sound of weapons that divide his happiness. The region where the conflict never stops is another prison for Ömer. He cannot get past the border; he does not want to go back to prison either. Ömer’s helplessness is the desperation of the countryman He and peers were against the state due to the Kurdish problem.\n\nAs that problem treated in the Yol, living conditions were terrible for people in Ömer’s village. Kurdistan issue might be the biggest problem in Turkey, even today. The main reason for that is the nation-state concept since it is based on the domination of a nation. The two sides (State and Rebellious Kurds) of this problematic are right for their way. Three key notions that state is based on are the monopoly of the force, legitimacy, and territory as Weber mentioned. (Fulcher & Scott, 2011, s. 559)Kurds are often in the news as they struggle to establish their state against the opposition of other countries in a conflict-ridden part of the world. (Fulcher & Scott, 2011, s. 599) According to dependency theory the reason why Kurdish people in a situation like that is because of the core countries which exploit them. In that point of view is Kurds are the sufferer of the film but with human dignity. Since activities in Şanlıurfa harms these notions for the Turkish state, killing the people in the village can be considered an obligation, however, the fact that this is a movie of Yılmaz Güney, the audience can easily understand which side he recognizes. Besides, when Ömer came to his home writing of Kurdistan appears in the screen while there was no legitimized state like that. Most important scene of Ömer in terms of cinematic expression was the way he learned his brother’s death. Pretend not to know his brother to resist the state authority due to personal honour and whole Kurdish case. Furthermore, before soldiers pulling over the van full of with dead bodies, they announced that “This homeland is for all of us, we are sorry too but the law is law” actually this is the main problem which those people is against, the law. In short, they believe that murder for maintaining the order should not be defined as a law.\n\nAnother subject which was treated in the film was conflicts between members of the same society. For years, Turkish society’s political opinion has separated into two; traditionalist conservatives and modernist lefties, however, Güney handled this by putting perspective that comes and goes in between those two political opinions into players. To continue with Ömer, his situation fits uncertainty. According to Kurdish customs which called ‘levirate’. If one’s brother dies, he has to get married to his brother’s wife. Unfortunately, Ömer was in love with someone else thus he had two options observing the unenacted law or being rejected by family, maybe death. While he could not adapt himself to the political situation of the state he lives in, now, he is contrary to the society which he belongs. That puts him into between two fires, therefore he cannot achieve peace in both sides of life; inside (prison) and outside. This movie is the story of the people who cannot find the world as in their dreams. (Which one of us can find). The screenwriter is one those men who had that dilemma in a harsh time for Turkey, this is the main reason why he is good at reflecting the reality into cinema. We won’t be mistaken if we say that Mevlat, who is going to ask the girl he loves, is the only character who can look into the future with hope among the five inmates. On her way to ask for the girl he loves, Mevlat reaches his goal. He will be able to establish a home after serving his sentence. Mevlat’s problem could not stay alone together with his love. The girl’s family does not allow it. She is under the supervision of relatives all the time. We can also link this oversight to the state of martial law in the country. The reason why he was so disturbed in detention is his desire to move away from jail life during his brief freedom, however, he cannot and do this also in outside. Imagine a generation that did not hear by anyone and could not explain what they were thinking while having difficulties in every part of life, and compelled to live a life which they had no opinion by the society and state. None of the main prisoners except Mevlat had a successful education life or a peaceful lifestyle. This situation led to the anomie and if you watch it more carefully that 5 prisoner has the symptoms of anomie. In Durkheim’s suicide studies, psychological state of the anomic suicide is irritation and frustration due to lack of regulation, although, another type of suicide which fits into the prisoners is fatalistic one due to excessive regulation in prison. Both are proper for them because they have a regulation in irregular position, in other words, all the things happen to them was happening in a state which has inconsistent management. This caused to clash in mind and led them to both anomic and fatalistic situation. As a matter of fact, everyone who watched Yol does not surprise if one of the prisoners would suicide since conflicts among society have effects on individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, troubles in the community affect women as much as men, maybe more than men. When patriarchy comes together customs, there is no calm life for women. I mentioned Ömer’s heart-wrenching situation but how about his brother’s wife? Her husband dies and she has to marry his brother, just because being a widow considered as a stigma. Oppression of women has a significant mention in the film. In every scene includes a woman, there is a pressure on her. For example, when Mevlat and his fiancée had a conversation in the street Mevlat says: “Look when you marry me, I do not want any conversation with any men, do not wear clothes I don’t want, do not go out, do not look around.” And she replies: “Write me long letters, but don’t send it to our address, my dad gets mad.” Mevlat: “Your dad is very close-minded” The thing that more than weird is girl’s feeling of love to Mevlat, unluckily, in those time women were not aware of the oppression.\n\nPersonal will creates the emotional side of the film. Mehmet and after him Seyit are the leading role of this situation. What they both have experienced is a tragedy and that differs them from others. The dramatic structure of the Yol, we can say that burdened on these two characters. Mehmet Salih (the character of Halil Ergün) is hated by his wife’s family and is not allowed to see his wife. It is a real tragedy that the passengers try to lynch them because they want to dally with their wife on the train, and what happens afterwards. Understanding the power of the society, the inability to find answers to their problems and create a more livable Turkey cannot be criticized, opens a parenthesis in human understanding of the individual. All of this blood vengeance caused by Mehmet’s fear of police. His wife’s brother convinced him to rob a bank. Mehmet was the driver but while brother-in-law was trying to reach him after the robbery, police came then Mehmet scared and gone. All the family blames him for the death of the brother. After all, when the train arrived a station little brother of the wife murdered Mehmet’s whole family and that was the last murder of customs in the film.\n\nEqually important the leading role ‘Seyit’ who is portrayed by Tarık Akan has got enormous agony from those challenges. After the temporary permission, he went Konya to see his wife and children but when arrived there he learned Zine (Wife) shipped to her mother’s home due to breastfeeding problems. Seyit’s mother said: “She infamies our family” and that line explains what kind of atmosphere women are in unfortunately, even women do not respect women. After that news, Seyit trot along Sancak where Zine and children live. On the road he came across with Mehmet from prison, his situation was no different from Seyit. Mehmet’s mind was full of with pangs of conscience and fear since he left his brother-in-law to death. A beautiful conversation scene they had was about the mind. Seyit said: “How can the man’s mind become an enemy to itself? My mind is an enemy of mine.” And he continued “I have pity in a corner of my heart, hate in another corner.” These words show his ambivalence for the decision he is going to make. When he reached to Sancak, there was a heavy snowfall. A beautiful cinematographic shot strengthens the atmosphere of the loneliness of Seyit. To reach where his wife and children live, he had to board a horse, people from there also gave him a gun in case of need. On the foothills of a mountain the horse walking barely and suffering due to weather conditions. The only solution was shooting it since makes Seyit slower. (Background of this scene is on notes since horse died for the movie) He left the carrion after him and finally met with Zine. In my personal opinion, this scene and continuous scenes are the most emotional part of the film. Seyit found ‘his woman’ handcuffed in a barn. Customs adjudicate his punishment as death and that was Seyit’s duty. On the one hand, he is driven away by his own will as a poor man due to dicta government and traditions, however, he has strong characteristics, he is a helpless prisoner, caught by his arm, his leg but not taken literally.\n\nThis long path is the basis for the voice of Seyit Ali’s conscience, as well as Zine’s exhaustion. Zine slowly begins to freeze. He asks for help from the man who took him to death. That’s the last moments after asking for help. When he realizes that the woman he loves is dying, Seyit Ali starts to shake and drag. It wouldn’t even make sense if he tried to revive him with a whip. Zine also draws a penalty for both her husband and his son’s hand. The whip, on the one hand, revolves to life, but at the same time descends to punish. Two men with punish her for the count. Zine, of course, has long since passed away with a deep calm. He has no intention of returning to this damned life, nor of punishing the men. From that point of view, both Zine and Seyit were the victims of cruelty. The cinematically main focus on faithfulness between man and woman through a ring on the finger, when Zine’s brother came morgue for recognition, again, we see the ring. At the end of the film when Seyit goes back to prison, he resists to cry due to preserving the masculine and strong man image but after all, he has been through cannot resist and start crying. The film ends on the ring on his finger.\n\nIn conclusion, Yılmaz Güney and everyone who contributed to the film achieved a magnificent job for the whole Turkish Cinema. 17 years of ban shows that the wretchedly position of Turkish society in coup years demonstrated like as it is. Why Turkey has a terrorism problem, why there is so much opposition and why young people (physically and mentally) wants to change somethings Yol explains all of them through a political stance of state and individuals on cultural conditions. In short, 2 hours of a masterpiece."
