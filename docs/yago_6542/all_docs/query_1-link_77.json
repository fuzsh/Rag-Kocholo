        "text": "Şerif Gören is a Turkish film director. Aside from important films under his own signature, he is also the winner of the Palme d'Or (\"Golden Palm\") award in Cannes Film Festival in 1982 for the film Yol, which he had directed on behalf of Yılmaz Güney, who at the time was serving a prison sentence for the murder of Yumurtalık judge Sefa Mutlu.\n\nGören started his film career as an editor, and then continued as an assistant director to Yılmaz Güney. He and Güney started directing \"Endişe\" (The Anxiety) in 1974, in the beginning of which Güney was arrested and sent to prison. Gören continued directing Endişe which makes Endişe as the first film directed mainly by him. He directed more than thirty films in a decade."
