        "text": "This documentary explored the way in which Cannes award-winning Turkish director Yilmaz Guney (sadly now dead) was forced to make his films under Turkish military rule. After being a major star in scores of popular low-budget movies, he directed films sympathetic to the working class which challenged successive repressive military regimes. Every one of his films was either banned or censored. He made his award winning film, \"Yol\" from prison with Director Serif Goren. Guney escaped from prison, smuggled the rushes out of Turkey and completed it in Europe (where he was hunted by Interpol)and won the Palme d'or. I made this documentary with a fine team and was thrilled that Julie Christie agreed to do the commentary."
