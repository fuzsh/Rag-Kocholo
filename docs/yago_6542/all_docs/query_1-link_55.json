        "text": "The study at hand relates to the history of Turkish cinema from 1895 to 1990 with respect to the accompanying political events and their analysis. Cinema´s upcoming in Turkey was initally staged by non-muslims, continued by the military and came under the one-man rule of Muhsin Ertugrul after the downfall of the Ottoman Empire. From the 50´s on it was generally referred to as Yesilçam. This name followed the screening of an Egyptian film in Istanbul in the late 1940´s as a label for a certain film genre and became a synonym for cinema itself. Tax cuts for domestic productions became a main reason for Turkish cinema´s thriving. The 60´s became its golden age and the 70´s were characterized by Yilmaz Güney´s work and art. Finally economic and socio-political circumstances lead to a crisis in the 80´s and resulted in the demise of Yesilcam.\n\nPopulism is defined as a political manner engaged with many political ideologies and has deep roots in the political culture of Turkey. But after the emergence of Demokrat Party and its success to gain power in 1950s, populism became the main source of hegemony for different ideologies. Socialist thought with a strong populist emphasis embodies the criticism of Demokrat Party government. Turkish Cinema in this period became politically alerted by this political tide. Metin Erksan’s films “Karanlık Dünya”, “9 Dağın Efesi” ve “Gecelerin Ötesi” were the examples of populist cinema in the late 1950s. After the 1960 coup d'état, socialist ideas were championed by the political elites and gain recognition in the cultural life of Turkey. And this creates a debate between two tendencies in socialist ideology, namely populist socialism that tries to maintain popular support and elitist socialism that depends to power elites especially military elites to create socialist change in society. In 1960’s Turkish Cinema creates a populist imagination with political films and as well as popular films. But after 1965 a new type of cinema thought emerged and became evident in the “Sinematek Movement” that has a self declared elitist agenda for Turkish Cinema. 1965 is also a date that elitist and Jacobin style of socialism win over the populist tendencies because of the loss of the faith in popular style socialism. This made a pessimist impact on the imagination of politically engaged directors and gave power to the “Sinematek Movement” that tries to break off with the legacy of Turkish Cinema. Yılmaz Güney’s film “Umut” in 1970 signals the end of optimism in social life and also the end of the populist cinema.\n\n􀀀This chapter provides an overview and analysis of the key periods, directors, feature films, and aesthetic styles in T􀀀urkish independent cinema. Without financial b􀀄acking and with little pub􀀄lic interest and an authoritarian censorship 􀀄board – curtailing individualistic and political forms of expression – 􀀀Turkish independent cinema developed, against all odds, in the 1960s. 􀀅Since that time independent filmmaking has evolved as a result of different movements led 􀀄by urb􀀄an and well- educated directors. Y􀀆et, many of these cinematic movements never made it past their fringe existence, 􀀄Because T􀀀urkey’s mainstream film industry has always relied on the commercial and entertainment aspects of film production. Consequently, these movements played a minor role in the country’s overall cinema history; nevertheless, their influence and importance with respect to inspiring new generations of filmmakers continues to this day.\n\nDiscussing the debate and ideological background regarding national cinema, this form of art shall be compared to several other contemporary cinematic currents in Turkey. In this study, a content analysis comprising one of the rarer examples of national cinema, the film Güneş Ne Zaman Doğacak? (Mehmet Kılıç, 1977) will be conducted while scanning secondary sources on Turkish cinema to present a concise picture; of the phenomenon that is known as 'national cinema.' Distinctive characteristics of the artistic language and the ideological background of the post-1960 Turkish cinema will be provided, among those, the phenomenon of a very blurred line between creative expressions and underlying ideological affiliations and the non-static developmental nature of cinematic fashions in influencing each other.\n\nCinema as an art form was established in Turkey as long ago as 1896, when the first picture houses opened in the cosmopolitan area around Pera in İstanbul (now known as Beyoğlu). The industry grew up around one particular street – Yeşilçam (The Green Pine) – which later gave its name to a style of filmmaking that reached a peak of popularity during the 1960s and 1970s. Since its inception, the Turkish film industry has focused on the struggles – whether social, personal or political – experienced by a people caught between two cultures, European and Islamic. This is especially important in a country which for the past half-century has made strenuous efforts to join the European Union, yet keeps being repelled by an institution that remains fearful of the ‘Islamic other’. The Turkish Republic, meanwhile, has been reluctant to consider itself a part of the Middle East, even though it shares its religion with neighbouring countries such as Iraq and Egypt."
