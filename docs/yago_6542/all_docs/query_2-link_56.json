        "text": "In 2009, the Turkish government started the \" Kurdish Initiative \" , a comprehensive policy-making process, in an attempt to improve the democratic standards and civil rights of the Kurdish population. Even though the initiative ended in 2015, it made it possible for a significant number of independent films to emerge which deal with the Kurdish issue. Historically, mainstream cinema's symbolic representation of Kurdish identity served to neutralise its Kurdish characters by portraying them as Turkish speaking and one-dimensional. Breaking this tradition, these independent films offer multi-layered, Kurdish speaking characters with progressive narratives. This article investigates three films produced on the eve of and during the \" Kurdish Initiative \" : My Marlon and Brando (Gitmek: Benim Marlon ve Brandom, Hüseyin Karabey, 2008), The Storm (Bahoz, Kazım Öz, 2008) and Future Lasts Forever (Gelecek Uzun Sürer, Özcan Alper, 2011). In addition to interrupting the traditional acceptance of stereotypes by the mainstream cinema, each film discusses the symbolic representations of Kurdish identity through different aspects: transnationality, the role of discriminative processes, and memory and trauma.\n\nIn 2009, the Turkish government started the “Kurdish Initiative”, a comprehensive policymaking process, in an attempt to improve the democratic standards and civil rights of the Kurdish population.

Some filmmakers include non-fiction sequences within a fictional narrative; others choose to re-write and re-enact true stories; and some edit documentary images make them feel fictive. The most common feature among the films in this category is that they deal with social and political matters in a personal and/or autobiographical way. This paper discusses the essayistic tendencies in contemporary Kurdish filmmaking in Turkey mainly through three examples: Gitmek (Hüseyin Karabey, 2008), İki Dil Bir Bavul (Özgür Doğan & Orhan Eskiköy, 2008) and Dûr (Kazım Öz, 2005). By blurring past and present, fiction and non-fiction and personal and public, these films open up fresh ways to discuss social and political matters. Through their detailed analysis, I argue that the essayism in these films allows them to resist to the conventional structures of documentary and fiction, to dispute the problems of representation that these structures bear, and to survive within a conservative and biased cultural, social and political environment.\n\nKurds have come to occupy an increasingly important position in the contemporary Middle East, notably in the struggle against Islamic State (IS). This has brought about an increased presence of Kurds in global media. At the same time, the Kurdish media landscape in the Middle East and in the diaspora has developed rapidly. The timing is thus appropriate to reconsider Kurdish media and cultural production in the light of the recent political, cultural, social and technological shifts. In this editorial introduction to the special issue on Kurdish media and cultural production we reflect on this growing field of research, focusing on three questions: How do media and cultural production contribute to contemporary (discourses on) Kurdish movements, and vice versa? How can we explain the emergence of a Kurdish mediascape in the Middle East and Europe theoretically and methodologically? And, what is the relevance and potential effect of this emerging Kurdish mediascape for the existing politics of media at the national and international level? We give a brief overview of the current state of research on Kurdish media and cultural production and discuss the articles in this special issue and how they contribute to a stronger understanding of the relations between media, culture and society in the Middle East.\n\nIn recent years, advancements in digital film technology have empowered counter-cinema filmmakers like myself to create films that approach the quality and technical standards of mainstream Hollywood cinema. From its beginning as a 'cinema under oppression' to its later evolution as a 'cinema of diaspora,' Kurdish cinema has served as a platform to assert and depict Kurdish existence as a nation. In this context, Kurdish cinema, as a manifestation of 'counter-cinema,' has transitioned into an innovative form of political expression. This paper aims to illustrate how digital technology has facilitated 'counter-cinema,' particularly within Kurdish films, by blurring the distinction between conventional filmmaking and countercinema techniques. To substantiate this claim, I will analyse my film 'The Sultan and the Kings' as a representative example of a Kurdish production crafted in exile. I will demonstrate how digital film technology enables 'counter-cinema' filmmakers to challenge the prevailing influences and conventions of mainstream Hollywood cinema. This is achieved through digital film manipulation while also incorporating the crucial element of 'entertainment,' which constitutes the foundational essence of popular cinema.\" Navigating the Cinematic Landscape: Counter-Cinema's Evolution and the Emergence of Mini Mainstream Cinema\n\nThis exegesis contextualises my feature-length film The Sultan and the Kings, a studio-based project produced for the Doctorate of Visual Arts. As a Kurdish émigré and filmmaker who left Iran in 1997, lived in Turkey for a couple of years, then emigrated to Australia in 2000, I studied film and also continued the filmmaking practice that I had begun in Iran in 1988. The exegesis examines the shortage of literature about Kurdish films, the misrepresentation of Kurdish filmmaking, the emergence of Kurdish cinema and the obstacles faced by it, as well as the emergence of Kurdish cinematic styles. By considering how my film relates to Kurdish cinema overall, what is referred to as the &quot;cinema under oppression&quot; and the &quot;cinema of diaspora&quot;, this exegesis examines the development of a form of storytelling that I term digital docu-fiction, which blends elements of documentary, fiction and digital film manipulation. Through this form of practice, Kurdish filmmakers aim t..."
