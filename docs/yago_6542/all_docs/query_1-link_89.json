        "text": "ÇİRKİN KRAL EFSANESİ (THE LEGEND OF THE UGLY KING), 2017\n\nGermany, Austria | DCP, Color, 122’ | Turkish, Kurdish, English, German, French, Spanish\n\nDirector:Hüseyin Tabak\n\nEver since his student years, Hüseyin Tabak had been dreaming of filming a documentary about Yılmaz Güney. Preproduction, filming, and editing took a total of seven years and finally his documentary, The Legend of The Ugly King, is ready. We watch the now legendary artist Yılmaz Güney through archive footage and the director’s candid interviews with Yılmaz Güney’s mother, older sister, daughter, ex-wife Nebahat Çehre, and wife Fatoş Güney, as well as renowned directors and colleagues, including Costa Gavras, Michael Haneke, Yilmaz Atadeniz, and Duygu Sağıroğlu. Bringing to the fore Yılmaz Güney as a screenwriter, director, and actor as well as a revolutionary and activist, the documentary also reflects all aspects of Güney’s personality. A striking life story, The Legend of The Ugly King is an homage to a legend who was as “undaunted” as the meaning of his name in Turkish, writing screenplays even during the years he was in prison, also directing films from prison, and continuing to pursue his passions.\n\nHaving been informed within the scope of the “Istanbul Foundation of Modern Art Istanbul Museum of Modern Art Economic Enterprise” (“Istanbul Modern”) Information Note on the Processing of Personal Data of Istanbul Modern’s E-Newsletter Subscribers, I consent to the processing of my personal data for the purpose of the promotion and marketing of events, products, and services specific to me, to commercial electronic messages, such as emails related to events, exhibitions, parties, advertisements, promotions, campaigns, etc., to be sent to me using my contact details given above, to the use of my personal data and its processing and storage in Türkiye, or abroad with appropriate security measures, for these purposes, and to the disclosure of my personal data to third parties from whom Istanbul Modern receives services and with whom it partners to send me messages and achieve these purposes, until I withdraw my consent.\n\nI consent."
