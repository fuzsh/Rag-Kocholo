        "text": "My second favorite Yilmaz Güney film.\n\nFor those that have ventured well enough into classic Turkish cinema, that infamous name must be familiar. Imprisoned FOUR TIMES during his life from 1960 to his death in 1983, he became one of the most popular actors during the 60s and one of the most prolific Turkish screenwriters of the industry for his time, and an exceptional indirect director, as many directors, from Şerif Gören to Zeki Ökten, would follow Güney’s specific instructions to direct the screenplays he kept writing in prison. Yol is no exception. Since the beginning of his career as a director and writer, his brutally honest and realistic views on the hardships of his people with not very subtle…\n\n2nd Yilmaz Güney (after Live Target), 1st Serif Gören\n\nThe winner of the Palme D'Or in 1982, Yol is perhaps more famous for its production background. Güney was in prison while the film was being filmed (this wasn't the first time- he'd been in and out of prison during the 1970s for a mixture of political protest and drunken brawling) and apparently smuggled out his directing notes to Gören on pieces of toilet paper. Yol stands as a testament of one man's resilience to Turkey's martial law, although it certainly helped that he was already something of a folk hero in his home country. The film itself doesn't hold up so well, though it has an impressive scope and some…\n\nRevered Turkish film (that was initially banned in its home country) about men on leave from prison who embark on various journeys home, that are unusually harsh and hostile journeys—though, I’m not even sure why they seem to choose the most horrible treks to travel. Military dictatorship, unjust imprisonments, extreme poverty, corruption of the youth, all this is in the picture… but it is amorphous. To put another way, this is the kind of film where the people are so damned and depressed it doesn’t have a single gesture in it to suggest there’s ever been a spontaneous joy at any point in their lives. The actors all have grim, clenched jaws.\n\nThe human condition is sunken in debasement, with…\n\nJuries at the Cannes Film Festival are no strangers to awarding controversial films with their coveted Palme d'Or, but among the divisive roster of trophy-holders, Yol's source of contention has less to do with its content on a global scale than with that content from a far more localized view. For those unaware, Kurdish director Yılmaz Güney wrote Yol while serving the last of a series of politically motivated prison stints, handing off directing responsibilities (aided by detailed directing notes) to his assistant Şerif Gören. Güney then resumed his creative responsibilities during post-production after escaping from prison and fleeing to Paris. Now I say \"for those unaware,\" but that statement comes with a heavy asterisk, for if you know anything…\n\nWhen five prisoners are given some free time to visit their homes and family, they will find to their dismay that no one outside likes them and feel mostly everything but hate.\n\nBoy, talking about a life that represents the \"thug life\" in such a specific and fascinating way. According to some info, the director had his assistant directing when he was taken into prison, and then edited the film in Switzerland and in Paris when he escaped from prison. Oh, and the film was banned in Turkey for like a decade or so after its released.\n\nThe script of the movie doesn't leave up to the fascinating behind the scene story, but its concept and critique are good enough…\n\nPalme d’Or Winners Project, 1982\n\nThe title translates as The Way or referred to as The Road by some and Turkish (Kurdish) director Yilmaz Guney's film is set out as such, following the fortunes of five prisoners given short term leave. We join their long journeys back to the difficult circumstances they have left behind, reflecting a turbulent time in a country becoming accustomed to another military coup.\n\nGuney himself was in prison and managed to direct the film with longtime collaborator Serif Goren, who acted as his eyes and ears outside. He eventually managed to flee the country and attend the Cannes premiere although sadly illness took his life a few years later. This was the third time the…\n\nPride, shame, honor, repression and oppression run deep in Yol as three inmates are granted one week of leave during which they find out that the homes they are returning to have changed. There's a consistent frustration in the movie at the state of the culture both on the systematic level and on the individual, where people at least could choose to reject the worst their environment expects of them.\n\nNot sure how I can exactly explain it, but for something as serious and rough as this, the film is also not oppressively bleak? Like there aren't any light moments or moments where things seem like they look up, but the roughness of the story is still not so bad…"
