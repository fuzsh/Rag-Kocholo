        "text": "Akser looks at the establishing factors of the production mode in Turkish cinema from the perspective of finance, production regime, the role of the screenwriter, and presentation of stars. Focusing on the organization and production of the Turkish film industry, this chapter also draws attention to the change within Turkish cinema from an artisanal, local Asian aesthetic to its reemergence as a televisual western artifact of modernity. Akser later explores the use of traditional Turkish art forms in the creation of a film aesthetics within the production modes of the 1960s–1970s Turkish cinema. “Locating Turkish Cinema” concludes with a discussion of how the production modes, narrative forms, genres, and acting styles borrowed from Western cinema conform to Turkish traditional arts.\n\nThe study at hand relates to the history of Turkish cinema from 1895 to 1990 with respect to the accompanying political events and their analysis. Cinema´s upcoming in Turkey was initally staged by non-muslims, continued by the military and came under the one-man rule of Muhsin Ertugrul after the downfall of the Ottoman Empire. From the 50´s on it was generally referred to as Yesilçam. This name followed the screening of an Egyptian film in Istanbul in the late 1940´s as a label for a certain film genre and became a synonym for cinema itself. Tax cuts for domestic productions became a main reason for Turkish cinema´s thriving. The 60´s became its golden age and the 70´s were characterized by Yilmaz Güney´s work and art. Finally economic and socio-political circumstances lead to a crisis in the 80´s and resulted in the demise of Yesilcam.\n\nPopulism is defined as a political manner engaged with many political ideologies and has deep roots in the political culture of Turkey. But after the emergence of Demokrat Party and its success to gain power in 1950s, populism became the main source of hegemony for different ideologies. Socialist thought with a strong populist emphasis embodies the criticism of Demokrat Party government. Turkish Cinema in this period became politically alerted by this political tide. Metin Erksan’s films “Karanlık Dünya”, “9 Dağın Efesi” ve “Gecelerin Ötesi” were the examples of populist cinema in the late 1950s. After the 1960 coup d'état, socialist ideas were championed by the political elites and gain recognition in the cultural life of Turkey. And this creates a debate between two tendencies in socialist ideology, namely populist socialism that tries to maintain popular support and elitist socialism that depends to power elites especially military elites to create socialist change in society. In 1960’s Turkish Cinema creates a populist imagination with political films and as well as popular films. But after 1965 a new type of cinema thought emerged and became evident in the “Sinematek Movement” that has a self declared elitist agenda for Turkish Cinema. 1965 is also a date that elitist and Jacobin style of socialism win over the populist tendencies because of the loss of the faith in popular style socialism. This made a pessimist impact on the imagination of politically engaged directors and gave power to the “Sinematek Movement” that tries to break off with the legacy of Turkish Cinema. Yılmaz Güney’s film “Umut” in 1970 signals the end of optimism in social life and also the end of the populist cinema.\n\nCinema as an art form was established in Turkey as long ago as 1896, when the first picture houses opened in the cosmopolitan area around Pera in İstanbul (now known as Beyoğlu). The industry grew up around one particular street – Yeşilçam (The Green Pine) – which later gave its name to a style of filmmaking that reached a peak of popularity during the 1960s and 1970s. Since its inception, the Turkish film industry has focused on the struggles – whether social, personal or political – experienced by a people caught between two cultures, European and Islamic. This is especially important in a country which for the past half-century has made strenuous efforts to join the European Union, yet keeps being repelled by an institution that remains fearful of the ‘Islamic other’. The Turkish Republic, meanwhile, has been reluctant to consider itself a part of the Middle East, even though it shares its religion with neighbouring countries such as Iraq and Egypt.\n\nDiscussing the debate and ideological background regarding national cinema, this form of art shall be compared to several other contemporary cinematic currents in Turkey. In this study, a content analysis comprising one of the rarer examples of national cinema, the film Güneş Ne Zaman Doğacak? (Mehmet Kılıç, 1977) will be conducted while scanning secondary sources on Turkish cinema to present a concise picture; of the phenomenon that is known as 'national cinema.' Distinctive characteristics of the artistic language and the ideological background of the post-1960 Turkish cinema will be provided, among those, the phenomenon of a very blurred line between creative expressions and underlying ideological affiliations and the non-static developmental nature of cinematic fashions in influencing each other.\n\nIn a social environment where Turkish guest workers have been depicted as isolated, incapable victims who could not speak for themselves or for their people, German directors were the first to provide portrayals of immigrants in Germany. Then emerged the second generation of Turkish filmmakers who brought along a breakthrough for Turkish‐German cinema. These filmmakers wanted to move beyond the cinema of duty and enjoy their double occupancy by interpreting their in‐betweenness as cultural richness. The third generation filmmakers are now no longer the silenced and disadvantaged members of the host society; instead, they have been active agents who are qualified, skilled, educated and thus self‐confident.\n\nModern Turkish cinema is a space in which different versions of national history coexist. Mainstream cinematography produced during the period of AKP rule is a field for broadcasting Turkey’s ‘glorious history’, both within and beyond the country. In mainstream historical films, neo-Ottomanism is brought to the fore. The heroisation of the Ottoman past is conducted through the depiction of Turkish military glory. At the same time, acute ethno-confessional issues are ignored, and Turkey is represented as a homeland of many peoples. Religious myths are used to support the idea of Turkey as the legal successor to the Ottoman Empire and the Caliphate. Conversely, Turkish art house films focus on complicated moments in the history of the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Turkey (such as the Greek, Armenian and Kurdish questions). Niche films are a forum for expressing critical attitudes to the ‘traditional’ vision of Turkish history. Overall, this disagreement between Turkey’s creative intelligentsia and the ruling elite over the interpretation of history is part of a wider discourse on cultural hegemony and resistance. In contrast to mainstream films, art house cinematography details history by focusing on the lives of individuals and telling their (often tragic) stories. This chapter is devoted to exploring the formation of ‘different histories’ of Turkey in modern Turkish cinema as a discourse of hegemony and resistance.\n\nTurkish Cinema studies goes back to 1968 with the publication of Nijat Ozon’s filmography. Before that, there has been film criticism by journalists in short-lived film magazines and newspapers. The first theoretical attempt define Turkish cinema as a culturally distinct cinema came from a film director, Halit Refiğ’s Fight For a National Cinema (Ulusal Sinema Kavgasi), and works after that came to view Turkish cinema as an umbrella term used to describe the cinema produced by filmmakers living in the Republic of Turkey established in 1923."
