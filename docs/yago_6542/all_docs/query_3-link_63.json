        "text": "Today the great Kurdish director Yilmaz Güney will be 83. He died prematurely in 1984 in Paris, where he was exiled. In 1982 he had won the Cannes Festival with the masterpiece “Yol”.\n\nTo pay tribute to Yilmaz Güney we repropose an interview with cinema director Fatih Akin.\n\nWhen “Duvara karsi” (“Against the wall”, distributed internationally with the title “Head On”), made its appearance on the screens of the Berlinale in 2004, it surprised many people. The harshness and the rage of that film, in fact, was clearly recalling the works of the Kurdish director Yilmaz Güney. At that time, the director of Duvara Karsi was a young Turkish filmmaker born and grown up in Germany. Today, Fatih Akin is one of the most appreciated directors, working in between Europe and Turkey, the West and the East.\n\n“A link” as he likes to define himself: not by chance he chose a bridge, the one on the Bosphorus, as the symbol of the film that followed Duvara Karsi: “Crossing the Bridge. The Sounds of Istanbul”, a documentary on the traces of the thousand sounds of Istanbul. Another way to show that, despite of the ideology of Ataturk followers, Turkey is much more than one. There are a thousand Turkeys in Turkey and in Europe. In Hamburg, where he’s born and grown up (in the Turkish-Kurdish neighborhood of Altona), Akin is now working on a new documentary, telling the struggle of a small town on the Black Sea (where Akin’s grandparents are from) against the government, who is planning to build there a garbage dump. Also this documentary, like Crossing the Bridge, comes after a feature movie, that is “The Edge of Heaven”, being the second part of a trilogy on love, death and the devil, that started with Duvara Karsi.\n\nA few years ago the young filmmaker has been contacted by Fatos, the widow of “the Ugly King”, that is how Yilmaz Güney was called."
