        "text": "(NEW YORK) – The Space Between: A Panorama of Cinema in Turkey is the largest retrospective of films from Turkey to be presented in the United States. The retrospective is produced by The Moon and Stars Project of The American Turkish Society and the Film Society of Lincoln Center. The program includes more than 25 films and runs from Friday, April 27 through Thursday, May 10, presenting award winning Turkish films from the 1950s to the present.\n\nProgram Director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, Richard Peña said, “Turkey has an extraordinarily rich cinematic tradition that, despite the growing importance of that country on the world stage, has remained largely unknown to even the most dedicated American film goers. This 29-film series focuses especially on the many socially-engaged works–works often made under difficult and even dangerous conditions–that offered a counterpoint to Turkey’s prolific commercial cinema.”\n\nOpening night kicks off on Friday, April 27 at 6:30 p.m. with the New York premiere of Can (2011) directed by Raşit Çelikezer. The film was Turkey’s first ever entry at the Sundance Film Festival, receiving the “Special Jury Prize for Artistic Vision.” This modern day love story, based in Istanbul, relates a heart wrenching tale of a young couple faced with infertility, who plot to illegally buy a child. Their plan appears to be successful until the wife finds herself incapable of accepting the child as her own. The Closing Night film, Özcan Alper’s The Future Lasts Forever (2011), will screen on May 10 and is the story of an Istanbul music student who travels the country to record traditional music and confront her past.\n\nOther films chosen for the rare retrospective show how Turkish cinema, like the country, embraces both the East and the West. The filmmakers are influenced by American and European traditions while incorporating ideas from Egyptian – and more recently – Iranian cinema. Yeşilçam (“Green pine”) is a metonym for the Turkish film industry, similar to Hollywood. The name is derived from Yeşilçam Street in Istanbul where many actors, directors, and crew members were based. As in Italy and Japan, the existence of a thriving popular cinema inspired filmmakers to create more personal works. Several of the filmmakers moved back and forth between Yeşilçam and more personal projects.\n\nYeşilçam’s heyday was from the 1950s – 1970s, when 250 – 350 films were produced. The retrospective features notable films from this era including O Beautiful Istanbul (1966) by Atıf Yılmaz, a bittersweet comedy about the chance friendship between a failed, but wise street photographer and a peasant girl, who has run away to Istanbul to become an actress. Other films from that period include Metin Erksan’s Revenge of the Snakes (1962), one of the first examples of social realism through its depiction of social injustices and economic hardships faced by a poor farmer and Dry Summer (1964) the bitter struggle between two brothers set in a rural farming community. Dry Summer won the Golden Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival and signaled to the film world that Turkey was an important player on the international stage.\n\nFilms by director Yılmaz Güney, who was one of the most iconic movie stars in Turkey in the 1970s (later to be imprisoned and forced to go abroad), include Elegy (1971) depicting the lives of four smugglers juxtaposed with the quiet determination of a woman doctor and Hope (1970) where a poor carriage driver invests all his hope in lottery tickets. One of Güney’s darkest films, The Road (1982) is a co-effort scripted and monitored by Güney from prison with the help of Şerif Gören. It tells the story of five prisoners who are given one-week leave to see their families. This “road movie” was smuggled out of the country and singled out for awards by the London Critics Circle, the French Syndicate of Cinema Critics and Golden Palm Award at Cannes. Another director of the Güney school is Ali Özgentürk, whose film Hazal (1979) shows the despair of rural life when a recently widowed woman is forced by her in-laws to marry her deceased husband’s twelve-year-old brother.\n\nThe program also presents the city of Istanbul as a beautiful, yet at times evil place, where dreams collide. The earliest of these films is Three Friends (1958) directed by Memduh Ün .It is a story of three young men living in a dilapidated mansion. They befriend a blind girl and plot how they will find a way to pay for surgery that will allow her to see again.\n\nMy Cinemas (1990) features the work of three women: director Gülsün Karamustafa, writer Füruzan, and star Hülya Avşar. A young woman looks to escape poverty by losing herself in the movies. Don’t Let Them Shoot the Kite (1989) directed by Tunç Başaran is a cult classic. It is a prison melodrama centered on women in an Istanbul prison from different walks of life and a little boy who grows up among them. In Somersault in a Coffin (1996), by Derviş Zaim, the Bosphorus is the city’s showpiece and those living on its margins tell their stories.\n\nThe literature of Turkey is captured on film with Motherland Hotel (1987) based on a novel by Yusuf Atılgan. Director Ömer Kavur’s dark drama of loneliness and obsession captures a mysterious woman’s promise to a lonely hotel keeper that causes his mental breakdown. Kavur was one of the first generation of directors coming from a film school background. He also directed The Secret Face (1991) based on “The Black Book” by Nobel Prize winning author Orhan Pamuk, which received the Best Film award at the Istanbul Film Festival and the Montreal New Cinema Festival. Atıf Yılmaz’s The Girl with the Red Scarf (1977) inspired by Kyrgyz writer Cengiz Aytmatov, is a love story about a man who leaves his family only to come back years later demanding his wife and child return to him.\n\nThe best Turkish auteur cinema can offer is Climates (2006) by internationally acclaimed filmmaker Nuri Bilge Ceylan. Cited as a masterpiece at the Cannes Festival, the climates of two towns on opposite ends of Turkey are the backdrop for the tumultuous relationship between the main characters.\n\nThe Space Between: A Panorama of Cinema in Turkey will feature Q & A’s with stars after the screenings as well as a panel discussion “The Space Between: The Trajectory of Cinema in Turkey” to be held at the Walter Reade Theater on Sunday, April 29 at 2:45PM. All films are in Turkish with English subtitles and will be shown at the Walter Reade and Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center (Howard Gilman Theater).\n\nThe retrospective is made possible through the generosity of lead sponsor Chobani and the company’s charitable arm, the Sherherd’s Gift Foundation, as well as other sponsors, Ramerica International and The Marmara-Manhattan. The program is also supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council and by a generous grant from Ramerica Foundation. The organizers would like to extend special thanks to Republic of Turkey Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Consulate General of Turkey in New York.\n\nTickets are on sale both at the box office and on-line Thursday. Discounts are available for students, seniors and Film Society members.

Yet the journey has another purpose, even if Sumru can’t admit it to herself: to find the man she herself loved and “lost.” Along the way she meets Ahmet, also wounded by the war, a street vendor who sells bootleg DVDs. Each comes to recognize the ongoing grief in the other, and as they probe their respective wounds they provide an outline of the great wound that continues to bleed the nation.\n\nThursday, May 10 at 8:10PM\n\nCLIMATES (İklimler) (2006) 101min\n\nDirector: Nuri Bilge Ceylan\n\nCountries: Turkey/France\n\nNuri Bilge Ceylan’s NYFF hit Once Upon a Time in Anatolia was a favorite among audiences with a mournfully droll Turkish analysis of male melancholy.

Harun (Taner Birsel) and Nilgün (Başak Köklükaya) have been married for seven years. Their relationship seems uneventful enough, with little outward strife. Then Harun suspects his wife of having an affair, and he begins to draw apart from her. Yet he fears that confronting her might actually bring the affair into the open—or end the marriage.\n\nSunday, May 6 at 5:45PM and Thursday, May 10 at 4:10PM\n\nCROSSING THE BRIDGE: THE SOUND OF ISTANBUL (İstanbul Hatırası: Köprüyü Geçmek) (2005) 90min\n\nDirector: Fatih Akın\n\nCountries: Germany/Turkey\n\nCrossroads between Europe and Asia, eastern and western cultures, as well as the former seat of a major empire—it’s little surprise that Turkey’s greatest city has developed an astonishingly rich and varied musical scene. Award-winning director Fatih Akın (Head On, The Edge of Heaven) takes us on a breathtaking tour of the sights and especially the sounds of Istanbul: you get to meet and hear Turkish rappers, Roma jazz musicians and traditional Kurdish singers, not to mention neo-psychedelic bands such as Baba Zula and various street performers.\n\nSaturday, April 28 at 10:20PM and Thursday, May 10 at 6:15PM\n\nDESPITE EVERYTHING (Herşeye Rağmen) (1988) 87min\n\nDirector: Orhan Oǧuz\n\nCountry: Turkey\n\nReleased from prison for unspecified offenses, Hasan (Talat Bulut) finds himself unable to reenter or even recognize the society into which he emerges. Even the most basic communication with other people is a challenge, and Hasan increasingly draws into himself.

At last she seems to find it, on a clockmaker working in a provincial town, and she sends the photographer off to find him. But soon this woman also disappears, setting the photographer off on a search that will bring him into an increasingly mysterious space made up equally of the physical world and the recesses of his own consciousness.\n\nFriday, April 27 at 1:30PM and Sunday, May 6 at 3:30PM.\n\nSOMERSAULT IN A COFFIN (Tabutta Rövaşata) (1996) 76min\n\nDirector: Derviş Zaim\n\nCountry: Turkey\n\nWriter/director Derviş Zaim focuses his camera on a rarely seen side of Turkish life with the alternately darkly comic and unsettling Somersault in a Coffin.

But Mahsun’s attention soon drifts to Rumelihisar Castle, a tourist attraction of this very old neighborhood, and the fifty peacocks that occupy the grounds.\n\nFriday, April 27 at 9:15PM and Wednesday, May 9 at 1:00PM\n\nSTEAM: THE TURKISH BATH (Hamam) (1997) 94min\n\nDirector: Ferzan Özpetek\n\nCountries: Italy/Turkey/Spain\n\nThe thin curtain of steam rising from the floor of a traditional Istanbul hamam (steam bath) provides an apt symbol for a film concerned with the permeable boundaries between nations, cultures and people. A Turkish director and longtime resident of Italy (frequently featured in our annual Open Roads: New Italian Cinema series), Ferzan Özpetek burst on the international scene with Steam: The Turkish Bath. Francesco, a young Italian designer with a rocky marriage, discovers that an aunt whom he’d never met has left him property in Istanbul in her will.

Meanwhile, Ali’s mother grows suspicious of her husband’s increasingly frequent business trips. And for Ali, something has to be done about the bullies forever picking on him.

The village mayor seeks to exert strict control over his electorate; his principal opponent is Latif, an opportunist who runs open air film screenings. But the villagers are growing tired of Latif’s recycled movies, and the mayor decides to break Latif’s monopoly by introducing the village’s first TV set—which is when the battle (and the fun) really begins.\n\nSunday, April 29 at 9:00PM and Thursday, May 10 at 2:00PM\n\nTHE ROAD (Yol) (1982) 111min\n\nDirector: Şerif Gören\n\nCountries: Turkey/Switzerland/France\n\nWinner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes, this most famous of all Turkish films starts in a prison, where those prisoners who have served at least a third of their time are given a week’s furlough to go home. Yet, as the film makes shockingly clear, going outside the prison walls doesn’t necessarily end one’s personal incarceration. Directed from a highly detailed screenplay by Yılmaz Güney (who was in jail at the time) by his close collaborator Şerif Gören, Yol renders each of its five principal stories with sympathy and clarity, creating a vibrant, visceral sense of prisoners’ world, while offering insights into their dreams and fears.

In 2011, following a decade of unprecedented arts and culture programs, Moon and Stars Project became the culture division of The American Turkish Society, America’s oldest not-for-profit organization, founded in 1949, seeking to enhance economic, diplomatic, educational and cultural ties between Turkey and the United States.\n\nMoon and Stars Project offers year-round programming including traditional and contemporary programs in music, visual arts, literature, theater and film, as well as project sponsorships, grants and scholarships, for emerging and established artists.\n\nOne of its flagship programs is the New York Turkish Film Festival, which has screened over 200 films in its 12-year history.\n\nFilm Society of Lincoln Center\n\nUnder the leadership of Rose Kuo, Executive Director, and Richard Peña, Program Director, the Film Society of Lincoln Center offers the best in international, classic and cutting-edge independent cinema. The Film Society presents two film festivals that attract global attention: the New York Film Festival, currently planning its 50th edition, and New Directors/New Films which, since its founding in 1972, has been produced in collaboration with MoMA. The Film Society also publishes the award-winning Film Comment Magazine, and for over three decades has given an annual award—now named “The Chaplin Award”—to a major figure in world cinema. Past recipients of this award include Charlie Chaplin, Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese, Meryl Streep, and Tom Hanks. The Film Society presents a year-round calendar of programming, panels, lectures, educational programs and specialty film releases at its Walter Reade Theater and the new state-of-the-art Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center.\n\nThe Film Society receives generous, year-round support from Royal Bank of Canada, American Airlines, The New York Times, Stella Artois, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the New York State Council on the Arts.
