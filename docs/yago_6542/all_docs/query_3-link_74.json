        "text": "not sure why i chose one of the coldest days of the year to watch the snowiest movie since 'the great silence' -- which i suspect was an inspiration for this bleak spaghetti style turkish western starring director güney as mysterious badass bounty hunter mehmet the sparrow, who one by one hunts down the bandits terrorizing a village and delivers their heads for his reward, calling himself azrael... there's a great stark beauty to the black and white snowbound world with a gruff anti-hero who rarely speaks. güney, of kurdish descent, was quite a famous actor and prolific screenwriter of bloody genre films before he began to direct and as one of his earliest efforts this is quite impressive. the…\n\nTurkish western a la Yilmaz Güney. Made me hate Morricone actually because the film has a strange obsession with playing his western themes in places where they do not really belong. Poor characterizations, Güney taking use of his rugged charisma. Honestly, I don't understand what people see in this one. It's just so nondescript.\n\nAn atmospheric western in the snowy tundra of Anatolia? Yes, please! I loved the way in which Memed is built up as a bad-ass, first creating his myth and then revealing his past and motivations, leading up to the tragic (and allegoric) ending. This was my first Güney movie and I'm really looking forward to see more of his movies.\n\n¿Un western atmosférico en la tundra nevada de Anatolia? ¡Sí, por favor! Me encantó la forma en que se construye a Memed como un tipo rudo, primero creando su mito y luego revelando su pasado y motivaciones, llevándolo hasta el trágico (y alegórico) final. Esta es la primera película de Güney que veo y realmente me dejó con muchas ganas de ver otras."
