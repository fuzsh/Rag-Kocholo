OneRepublic is the first rock band to be signed on to Mosley Music Group, Timbaland's record label, and the guys tell us why they think they fit in with the label so well. They also talk about why they think their single, "Apologize," has been such a big hit and what they do before they go onstage. Hosted by Michelle Marie.
