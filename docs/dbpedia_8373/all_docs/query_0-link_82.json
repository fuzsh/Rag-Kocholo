        "text": "Today, OneRepublic released a new song called, “Better Days,” which was literally written and recorded while the group is in quarantine. The group and its label, Interscope Records, will donate a portion of the proceeds from the streaming of “Better Days” through September 2020 to benefit MusiCares’ COVID-19 Relief Fund, which aims to help those in the music community affected by the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOn writing the song, frontman Ryan Tedder says, “We were in the final week of our fifth album deadline when a global pandemic was declared by the WHO. A few of us unknowingly got exposed to somebody with Covid-19 in London and ended up in quarantine in L.A. at my studio for two weeks. With only two songs left to finish, one of them happened to be ‘Better Days.’ We write about real experiences and events that happen to us – this is what happens when you write a song during a crisis.”\n\nThe song is slated to appear on the group’s next album, “Human.”\n\nPopular on Variety"
