        "text": "OneRepublic play The Limelight on Wednesday 14th April. The band was nominated for a Grammy in 2008 for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Tedder, plus guitarists Zach Filkins and Drew Brown, bassist/cellist Brent Kutzle and drummer Eddie Fisher have sold almost 2 million albums and 8 million singles.\n\nThe band’s 2007 hit “Apologize,” from their album Dreaming Out Loud went to No. 1 in 16 countries, going gold in 14 of them. It broke records for airplay when it finally made it to radio (and was only bested by Lewis’s “Bleeding Love,” which Tedder co-wrote). Their second single, “Stop and Stare,” propelled OneRepublic beyond platinum status. Waking Up is their second album on Mosley/Interscope Records.\n\nTheir latest single “All the Right Moves” comes with a huge heap of anticipation from the millions of fans of OneRepublic and Tedder. But there are countless others who may not know the band or its members’ names but recognize their heartfelt songs from the soundtrack of their last bad breakup or emotional meltdown. OneRepublic is that band.\n\nâ€œYou’re only as good as your worst song,” says OneRepublic’s front man and chief songwriter Ryan Tedder.\n\nNot that he knows anything about writing a dud. The 30-year-old born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has obsessed over the art of pop music for more than a decade. Along the way, he’s worked with Rihanna, BeyoncÃ©, Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Jennifer Lopez, Leona Lewis (he shared a 2008 Best Record Grammy nod for her “Bleeding Love”), and other massive stars. And it’s all lead him back to his own Denver, Colorado-based band, where he pours out his most heartfelt music. “The writing approach I take for OneRepublic is completely different from the approach I take with anyone else — it’s infinitely harder,” Tedder says. “These songs have to be personalized. And I write each of them like it’s the last one I’ll be able to put out.”\n\nWhile breaking sales, the members OneRepublic have proved for years that hard work pays off. As sensational as their rocket trip up the charts may have seemed, nothing happened for them overnight."
