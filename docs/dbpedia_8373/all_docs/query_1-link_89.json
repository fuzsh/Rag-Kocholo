        "text": "Welcome to Music Friday when we bring you great songs with jewelry, gemstones or precious metals in the title or lyrics. Today, we feature “Someone to Save You,” the 2007 power ballad by OneRepublic. In this song about a destructive relationship, lead singer Ryan Tedder is making a desperate attempt to pull his friend from the depths of depression before it’s too late.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nIn the first verse, he sings, “Patience took you for everything / Looked like a diamond ring / You wore it so much longer / Than made sense.”\n\n“Someone to Save You,” which one critic called “a big song, with big vocals and big sound, kind of a ballad on steroids,” is the 11th track on OneRepublic’s platinum-selling debut album, Dreaming Out Loud. The album generated five singles, including the hit “Apologize,” which reached #1 in 16 countries and earned the band a Grammy nomination.\n\nDespite it’s great success, OneRepublic was nearly relegated to a footnote in the annals of “Bands That Almost Made It.” The band formed in 2003 and got its first break when Columbia Records signed the group only nine months later. For the next two and a half years, the band worked on its first full-length album, but two months before the album was set to release, Columbia dropped the band from its label.\n\nWith no record label, OneRepublic turned to the Internet to build a fan base. The band quickly became MySpace’s #1 unsigned act, with more than 28 million songs played. That success attracted the attention of a bunch of interested labels, including the Mosley Music Group, which signed the band.\n\nPlease click the video at the end of this post to see OneRepublic performing “Someone to Save You” live at Philadelphia’s Electric Factory in 2008. The lyrics are below if you’d like to sing along.\n\n“Someone To Save You”\n\nWritten by Eddie Fisher, Timothy John Myers and Ryan B. Tedder. Performed by OneRepublic.\n\nPatience took you for everything\n\nLooked like a diamond ring\n\nYou wore it so much longer\n\nThan made sense\n\nApathy in disguise\n\nCrept on you like a spy\n\nHurt you in ways\n\nYou can’t describe\n\nBack to the start now\n\nI won’t let you go this way now\n\nHonesty is what you need\n\nIt sets you free like someone to save you\n\nLet it go, but hurry now\n\nThere’s undertow and I don’t want to lose you now\n\nAlright, sit down and spill your heart\n\nLet’s start from the very start\n\n‘Cause I can see by your eyes\n\nYou’re wasted\n\nYour energy comes and goes\n\nYou’re taking your time, you know\n\nNothing can change what happened\n\nSo, back to the start now\n\nI won’t let you go this way now\n\nHonesty is what you need\n\nIt sets you free like someone to save you\n\nLet it go, but hurry now\n\nThere’s undertow and I don’t wanna lose you now\n\nDon’t wanna lose you now, and now\n\nOh, my, look at your pride starts fading so\n\nHow much can you take?\n\nHonesty is what you need\n\nIt sets you free like someone to save you\n\nLet it go, but hurry now\n\nThere’s undertow and I don’t want to lose you"
