(Maybe because the band’s from Colorado, crustaceans seem exotic.) “They were all very nice,’’ said the restaurant’s GM Ben Korman. “It was a little hectic because we were busy, but they were great.’’ (The band filmed its evening at the Barking Crab for a DVD.) On Thursday, OneRepublic dropped by Mass Ave Tavern to tackle the Uncle Buck Pancake Challenge: 6 pounds of pancakes, butter, and syrup eaten in one hour. The band failed. . . . It seems New Order also enjoyed its brief visit to Boston. During a pause in the English band’s show at the Pavilion Wednesday, singer Bernard Sumner told the crowd he’d taken a Duck Tour during the day and quite liked it. Sumner said he could see himself leading such a tour, but he can’t. “I play music,’’ he said. “I’m in this band.’’"
