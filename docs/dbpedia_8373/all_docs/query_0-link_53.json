        "text": "Q&A: OneRepublic's Eddie Fisher on songwriting, touring\n\nEddie Fisher listed all of the elements that fans will see and hear during OneRepublic's show at Riverbend Tuesday: \"Beautiful lights. Beautiful sound. Beautiful music. A lot of energy.\"\n\nHe paused and then added: \"Big drums.\"\n\nFisher and OneRepublic are out on the road to support \"Native,\" the Colorado pop-rock band's third album, released last year. The drummer talked about the songwriting process and his role as a writer in the band.\n\nThe band went to Paris, Greece, London, New York, Seattle and Vancouver to write and record \"Native.\" Was your record company financially committed to allowing you to make the record you wanted?\n\nThat was all during touring. We would do it on days off in between shows on European tours. Greece was the only one where we took two weeks of vacation-slash-work to record a song – \"Counting Stars,\" as a matter of fact – to write and record and finish that song up.\n\nOther than that, as far as the label letting us or not letting us, it's logistics as far as what we want to do, how we write, and the label being OK with it. Some of it, yeah, of course, they're not OK with it, like, \"No, you can't spend this amount of money on this stupid stuff.\"\n\nIf you had instead spent a few months in a studio in L.A., would the results have been different?\n\nYeah. When we're in the same place for too long, we get bored. We get antsy. We can't sit in one space for too long. Going to different places inspires us to write and record different songs. It just motivates us and gives us a reason to write better songs and honest lyrics.\n\nMost of the lyrics that (singer) Ryan (Tedder) writes are based on what he's experienced in life and what we've experienced in life. Absolutely it benefits us and benefits the label for us to be able to write these songs.\n\nYou mention writing. You didn't get any writing credits on the \"Native\" as you have in the past. Is there any reason for that?\n\nIt just depends on who writes the songs, you know? If Joe Schmo came in and wrote a song, he's gonna get writing credits. I did a lot of the tracking, the drum tracking, but I didn't have any credits on songs that made the album. There's a few songs that I wrote a little bit of that didn't make the album. That's the luck of the draw. It happens.\n\nDo you want to do more writing, inside the band or outside?\n\nI write for other artists outside the band. You keep playing the same songs over and over and over again, and you don't get that musical release of wanting to do something different. When we're recording songs, there are times where I give them an idea, whether it be on guitar or bass or keyboards or piano, even drums. Sometimes it's cool, and sometimes it's not.\n\n\"What do you guys think of this?\" \"Ah, it's amazing?\" Or \"what do you guys think of this?\" \"What were you thinking? That's horrible.\" But we all do that.\n\nLast album, (guitarist) Zach (Filkins) didn't get a lot of credits. This album, I didn't get a lot of credits. The best song wins. And that's five guys filtering out what we think are the best songs for the album.\n\nI'm not familiar with the circumstances that lead you to joining the band. Other than your skills as a drummer, what made it a good fit?\n\nWe had a lot of things in common. I wasn't born with a religious background. But I did have somewhat of a faith in God. Played in a lot of churches. Zach played in churches. Our old bass player played in churches with me. We've all grown up around that kind of thing. That was the similarity.\n\nOur personality just clicked as well. And to top it off, you have musical interests. It's literally like dating. You find out what the person likes, who the person is behind closed doors. I went through that typical audition process and they decided to pick me.\n\nI really liked the band from the start. And when I heard the songs I was like, \"heck yeah, I want to try out.\" I was excited to get the job. Here I am eight years later, loving my life and living the dream.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: OneRepublic with The Script and American Authors\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Tuesday\n\nWhere: Riverbend Music Center\n\nTickets: $75; $55; $26; $72 lawn 4-pack"
