        "text": "By Markus Weinzinger\n\nThere’s one band that has taken the world by acoustic storm. They have performed brilliant melodies and catchy tunes that refuse to leave our minds. Songs like “Apologize”, “Secrets”, “Feel Again”, and more are synonymous with their name. It can be assured that OneRepublic “did it all.” However, fame did not come easily to these artists. Take a dive into the story of the band with “all the right moves.”\n\nThe band known today was forged in 2002 by songwriter and lead singer Ryan Tedder and Zack Filkins, buddies from high school. The duo performed songs inspired by their favorite bands under the name “This Beautiful Mess”. The venture was short-lived, as the two parted for college, but they were not done yet.\n\nRyan Tedder began to build a reputation in songwriting, and even won an MTV songwriting contest. Filkins would return to play music with Tedder after his college years. Eventually the two got together with Drew Brown, Eddie Fisher, and Brent Kutzle to form Republic, later changed to OneRepublic after concerns of bands already possessing the name. Signed to Columbia Records, the new band got dropped after an issue in composing their first album. In a gracious rescue, the famed Timbaland, after viewing Tedder’s performance in the MTV contest, offered a deal with him and the Mosley Music Group.\n\nMyspace played a role in supporting the sprouting band. At one time, their works were the number one downloaded act, a testament to the power of social media. Their page is still active today.\n\nUnder Timbaland’s label, OneRepublic’s first album, Dreaming Out Loud, debuted in late 2007. The most popular song, “Apologize”, would become the band’s claim to fame song, and further grew in appeal in Timbaland’s Shock Value. In an interview featurette, Ryan Tedder described the song as having “this pixie dust on it […] I never thought […] it would be the biggest song in radio history.” Indeed, the 10 million selling single would be the start of a line of hits: “Stop and Stare”, “Say (All I Need)”, and more.\n\nOneRepublic saw even more success. Ryan Tedder would personally go on to write songs for many bands and artists, including B.o.B., U2, Far East Movement, Gwen Stefani, Maroon 5, and Kelly Clarkson. One Republic released its next album, Waking Up, in 2009. Featured are the hit singles “Secrets”, “Good Life”, and “All the Right Moves”. The band has received nominations for World Music, Teen’s Choice, and MTV related awards.\n\nOneRepublic continues to impress itself in the daily lives of people. Two years ago, they launched their latest album, Native. “Counting Stars” seemed to play for days since its release. OneRepublic courteously shares its “good life” with others. They have gone on tour around the world, energizing crowds with jarring experiences. The band performed a special remix of one of their songs, “I Lived”, for (RED) Global Funds, to help hasten the cure of AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria epidemics.\n\nWith the momentum that OneRepublic has built, refreshed, and expanded in the past thirteen years, it can be assured that they are going down as one of the most popular bands of our time. What will be their next greatest hit? Only time will tell."
