        "text": "8 things you didn’t know about OneRepublic\n\nOneRepublic is coming to blow the roof off GrandWest Casino, Cape Town, on 15 November 2022!\n\nWe’re so excited to have this monumental international band come to South Africa, we thought it only proper to help brush up on Mzansi’s OneRepublic knowledge.\n\nBelow we’re taking a look at eight things you didn’t know about OneRepublic, and one premier hotel you can stay at if you’re attending the show from out of town.\n\nThe band’s origins can be traced back to 1996 OneRepublic’s life story begins with Ryan Tedder and Zach Filkins, lead singer and guitarist, discussing their shared music tastes on a drive home one night.\n\nAfter assembling a few musicians, This Beautiful Mess was formed by the pair, but the early iteration of OneRepublic split soon after starting, when Tedder and Filkins began attending different colleges.\n\nThey were influenced by some amazing musiciansWhile the band prefers not to place themselves in any genre boxes, they have mentioned a few musicians whose works left a profound impact on individual band members.\n\nSome of these inspirational musicians include Mozart, U2, the Beatles, and Prince.\n\nLead singer, Ryan Tedder, is ridiculously talented Looking at OneRepublic’s lead singer, Ryan Tedder, on the microphone, you wouldn’t guess that he’s actually a seriously talented musician. His instrumental contributions to the OneRepublic repertoire include keyboards, rhythm guitar, percussion, and even the occasional violin!\n\nThey’re dropping a new album in 2022 It It might already be out by the time you read this, but that’s okay. We know it’s going to be filled with absolute bangers!\n\nAfter teasing fans with singles sprinkled throughout the first half of 2022, it’s rumoured that OneRepublic is launching its sixth studio album this year.\n\nYou can hear these two sounds in most of their songsListen to every single OneRepublic song and write down the instruments you can hear in each song. In most of them, you’ll hear the sweet sounds of various orchestral instruments, the clapping of hands, and different styles of booming drums. Could that be the secret to their unique sound?\n\nRyan Tedder has won Grammy Awards for songwritingAs a solo artist, lead singer for OneRepublic, Ryan Tedder, has seen some noteworthy fame in the music industry. He has earned, among others, Grammy Awards for songwriting, regularly writing hits for the likes of Taylor Swift, Beyonce, Maroon 5, and even Adele.\n\nSome members are talented on stage and on screen Do you enjoy your series and movies like the rest of us? If you’ve seen the 2008 Jessica Alba film, The Eye, or you’ve watched season 7 of Criminal Minds, you’ll have seen OneRepublic band members Brent Kutzle and Zach Filkins in cameo appearances.\n\nAs they grew as a band, so did their band name After college, Ryan Tedder and Zach Filkins reconnected and tried out the band thing once more, but this time they were serious about it. OneRepublic was originally called Republic, with the One being added once they’d been signed by their first record label to avoid future legal action from similarly-named bands.\n\nSore fingers from searching for ‘hotels near me?’\n\nLooking for a place to stay near the concert?\n\nWe bet you didn’t know we’re always giving you great specials on quality accommodation. It’s our way of helping you explore, experience and enjoy life on the southern tip of Africa!\n\nIt might be too late to apologise, but it’s not too late to reserve a room to stay close to the show at a fantastic rate. Explore our 176-room City Lodge Hotel GrandWest, a short walk from the OneRepublic concert.\n\nPS: Don’t forget to check out the hotel specials and holiday accommodation promotions we’re running, they’re all on the City Lodge Hotel Group website!\n\nRelated Posts"
