        "text": "Welcome to Music Friday when we bring you fantastic songs with jewelry, gemstones or precious metals in the title or lyrics. Today, OneRepublic frontman and songwriter Ryan Tedder emphasizes the importance of overcoming obstacles and enjoying life to the fullest in the international hit, \"I Ain't Worried.\"\n\nHe sings, \"I don't know what you've been told / But time is running out so spend it like it's gold.\"\n\nThe gold reference advances the idea that Tedder has the confidence of a billionaire (\"I'm nine zeroes\") and has no regrets even when he's broke.\n\n\"I Ain't Worried\" was the second single released from the soundtrack of Top Gun: Maverick (2022), the blockbuster sequel to Tom Cruise's Top Gun (1986). The 2022 film grossed $1.496 billion worldwide and was nominated for six Academy Awards. The song was also a tremendous success, charting in 37 countries.\n\n\"I Ain't Worried\" sets the mood for the memorable beach scene where we see Cruise and his students engaging in dogfight football, a two-ball version of the game where the teams play offense and defense at the same time.\n\nTedder told Ryan Seacrest that Cruise had already turned down about 30 songs for the movie's soundtrack when a friend at Paramount Pictures invited him to work on the original piece for that transformative scene.\n\nDue to the secrecy surrounding the film's production, Tedder was not given a copy of the scene. Instead, he got to see it for the first time during a Zoom call with Cruise's team. Tedder reportedly viewed the scene on his computer and recorded the screen with his smartphone. Then, he went to work on the whimsical, upbeat song that reflected the mood and length of the scene.\n\n\"We edited it, trying to guess what the film editor himself or herself would do,\" he told Variety. Apparently, Cruise was thrilled with the song and impressed with Tedder's ingenuity.\n\nOneRepublic was established by Tedder and Zach Filkins in Colorado Springs, CO, in 2002. The group earned a dedicated following on Myspace and then attracted the attention of major record labels after playing shows around the Los Angeles area.\n\nThe group has sold more than 16 million records worldwide. Separately, Tedder earned 11 Grammy nominations and three Grammy Awards feting his songwriting prowess. He's written for top acts, such as Adele, Taylor Swift, U2, Beyoncé, Miley Cyrus, Ed Sheeran, Jennifer Lopez, Camila Cabello, Lady Gaga, Maroon 5, One Direction and more.\n\nPlease check Tedder and OneRepublic performing \"I Ain't Worried\" in the videos below. The first is is the official lyric video and the second is a clip of the beach scene from Top Gun: Maverick. The lyrics are here if you'd like to sing along…\n\n\"I Ain't Worried\"\n\nWritten by Ryan Tedder, Brent Kutzle, Tyler Spry, John Eriksson, Peter Morén and Björn Yttling. Performed by One Republic.\n\nI don't know what you've been told\n\nBut time is running out, no need to take it slow\n\nI'm stepping to you toe to toe\n\nI should be scared honey, maybe so\n\nBut I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)\n\nKeeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes\n\nI ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)\n\nSwimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below\n\nI ain't worried 'bout it\n\nI ain't worried 'bout it\n\nI don't know what you've been told\n\nBut time is running out so spend it like it's gold\n\nI'm living like I'm nine-zeros\n\nGot no regrets even when I am broke (Yeah)\n\nI'm at my best when I got something I'm wanting to steal\n\nWay too busy for them problems and problems to feel (Yeah, yeah)\n\nNo stressing, just obsessing with sealing the deal\n\nI'll take it in and let it go\n\nBut I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)\n\nKeeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes\n\nI ain't worried about it right now (Right now)\n\nSwimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below\n\nI ain't worried 'bout it\n\nI ain't worried 'bout it\n\nOoh, oooh, oooh, I ain't worried\n\nOoh, ooh, oooh, no, no\n\nI ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)\n\nKeeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes\n\nI ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)\n\nSwimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below\n\nI ain't worried 'bout it (Ooh, ooh)\n\nI ain't worried 'bout it (Ooh, ooh)\n\nI ain't worried 'bout it\n\nOfficial lyric video\n\nScene from Top Gun: Maverick"
