        "text": "“I was determined to make a living doing music,” says Ryan Tedder of his early start writing music for commercials, movies and TV series. And while, for a time, he thought that would be the extent of his music career, that experience is what made him the perfect choice to write and produce the official Paris Olympics song in partnership with the Coca-Cola Company.\n\n“It was the perfect combination of fun and challenging,” he says of crafting the song titled “Hello World” and performed by Gwen Stefani and Anderson .Paak. “It definitely tested my Rolodex. There’s a list of desired artists [from the International Olympic Committee and Coca-Cola], then they have to find where those artists commingle.”\n\nTedder, who grew up watching the Olympics, says he never misses gymnastics, track and field or swimming. And he’s already thinking ahead to the 2028 games, which will take place in Los Angeles. He says, “I definitely would like to do the song for 2028, I’ve already made that abundantly clear with the IOC and Coke. Sonically, I would want to encapsulate the essence of California. Some combination of West Coast hip-hop, but then I also think Beach Boys.”\n\nIt’s surprising Tedder has much time to watch the Olympics at all, considering his schedule not only writing and producing for others, but also his own band OneRepublic. The band released its sixth album this July, titled Artificial Paradise. The project includes the previous Billboard Hot 100 top 10 hit “I Ain’t Worried” from Top Gun: Maverick as well as “Hurt” and “Runaway.”\n\n“The weirdest thing about this album — and the next album will be different because we’re always trying to switch it up — but this represents, more or less, the end of our album cycle,” he says, noting the lead single “West Coast” arrived about two years ago. “I Ain’t Worried” came next, which he says “strangled” “West Coast” to become the album’s best-known track.\n\nHe has plenty more on the horizon as well, teasing he and Tate McRae (for whom he executive produced her second album Think Later) are talking “every day” about what is next. “I was texting her this morning,” he says with a laugh, before adding he is keeping his lips sealed about what’s to come. “When it comes to work ethic, she’s Olympic-level focused.” He’s also eager to work with Rosalía and Sabrina Carpenter (he’s more “Espresso” than “Please Please Please,” he says) and has been working a bit more with rappers lately too.\n\nHe says those sessions have made him think about remixing one of OneRepublic’s biggest hits, “Apologize,” saying it would “go crazy right now. “It’s been 17 years, it’s time,” he adds. “I want to figure out who the right rapper is. … I’ve dropped some hints to Jack [Harlow]. I did a record with 21 Savage last year and I asked his crew, like, ‘Does he like “Apologize”?'”\n\nAnd when it comes to re-recording your own hits, he acknowledges the tireless work that Taylor Swift has done in that department. “Somebody yesterday was like, ‘When’s she running for president?’ It would be the biggest sweep of all time — but don’t do that to yourself,” he says with a laugh. “She’s got plenty more songs to write. She’s the most prolific… I’ve said in countless interviews who the most talented people [I’ve worked with are]: [Paul] McCartney blew my mind and then Taylor.”\n\nWatch the full interview — in which Tedder also discusses his publishing company Runner and which OneRepublic era is his favorite — above."
