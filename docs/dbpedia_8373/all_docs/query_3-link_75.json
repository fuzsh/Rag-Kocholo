        "text": "Add new music from OneRepublic to things you can look forward to next year. The group’s Grammy-winning singer and songwriter, Ryan Tedder, broke the good news to fans on Sunday (Dec. 17), tweeting that he is “working on New @OneRepublic,” tracks and noting that he’s been “quietly gathering loads of songs for 2024.”\n\nEven better, the prolific producer/writer added, “think we have the next single picked 😉 (praying hands, raising hands and heart emoji).”\n\nTedder has written and produced hits for everyone from Beyoncé, Ed Sheeran, Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga to Taylor Swift, Lil Nas X, Adele, Paul McCartney and, most recently, Tate McRae (“Greedy). He has also been the mastermind behind his own band’s Billboard Hot 100 No. 2 hits “Counting Stars” and “Apologize.” The group that also includes guitarist Zach Filkins, multi-instrumentalist Drew Brown, drummer Eddie Fisher, keyboardist Brent Kutzle and keyboardist Brian Willett released their most recent album, Human, in 2021; the LP topped out at No. 11 on the Billboard 200 albums charts.\n\nIn the period since, OneRepublic released the single “I Ain’t Worried” from the Top Gun: Maverick soundtrack in May 2022, followed by this May’s “Runaway” single and September’s “Mirage” from the Assassin’s Creed Mirage video game.\n\nOneRepublic was one of the headliners for this summer’s inaugural Bud Light Backyard Tour summer concert series, a four-city tour that also included sets from Midland, Dashboard Confessional, Bush and Lindsay Ell. In September, OneRepublic released a majestic, re-recorded version of their breakthrough hit, “Counting Stars,” the song that Tedder said in an Instagram post “changed the trajectory of our band.”\n\nSee Tedder’s tweet about the new music for 2024 below."
