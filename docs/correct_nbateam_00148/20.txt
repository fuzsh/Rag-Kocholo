Early career[]

Allen played at Chicago's Crane High School, where he was a basketball standout. At Crane, Allen played alongside future Celtics prospect Will Bynum. A shooting guard, Allen spent his freshman year (2000-01) playing for Butler County College in El Dorado, Kansas, where he averaged 16.5 points, 6.1 rebounds and 2.8 steals, going on to being named Jayhawk West Conference Freshman of the Year. During his sophomore year (2001-02) at Wabash Valley College in Mount Carmel, Illinois, he led his team to 32-6 overall record and fourth place at the NJCAA championships.

He spent two nights in jail, but was not implicated in the shooting. Due to this incident and a rather severe right knee injury that Allen had suffered prior to the shooting, Allen missed much of the first half of the 2005-06 season. On April 24, 2007, the charges against Allen were dropped in a Chicago court. tearing both the tearing (ACL) and Medial collateral ligament (MCL). Allen underwent a successful tearing on January 13 at New England Baptist Hospital and was sidelined for the rest of the season. He made a fast return to the court for his type of knee injury only nine months later during the following preseason, even though not at full strength. However, the explosiveness he displayed prior to the injury was noted as "sorely lacking".
