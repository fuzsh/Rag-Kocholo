Tony Allen helped the Memphis Grizzlies get back into the winning column last night in Boston, as the Grizz handed the struggling Boston Celtics their fourth consecutive loss.

According to Allen, these Celtics resemble nothing like the championship winning squad that he was a part of in 2008. Allen says the C’s need to integrate new players into their system, and above all, re-establish their defensive identity.

From the Boston Herald and WEEI:

Is he surprised by the Celtics’ early season struggles this year? “You can’t win a championship in October, November, December, January. They are just pretty much ironing it out right now, get it out of the way.”

“They’re missing a lot of pieces,” said Allen, who left Boston for a three-year deal in Memphis two summers ago. Somewhat offering his stamp of approval on the replacement of Ray Allen‘s 3-point shooting prowess with fellow veteran Jason Terry, Allen instead harped on the absence of players … well … like himself. “I don’t think they’ve really got a defensive-minded guy yet,” added Allen. “I mean, they’ve got one [Avery Bradley], but I can’t say he’s 100 percent just yet. I don’t think they’ve got the center like Perk [Kendrick Perkins]. It’s kind of hard finding a guy like — a guy who clogs up the paint, talks trash to you and can actually back it up. They’re just missing a lot. I don’t know. I don’t see the same team from 2008.”

Tony Allen added that the Boston Celtics’ championship-tested veterans shouldn’t be counted out yet, however, despite their early-season struggles.

The Celtics are now 3 games under .500 (14-17), and are counting on the likes of Avery Bradley to help jumpstart their defense.
