Former Boston Celtics shooting guard Tony Allen, part of the Celtics’ 2008 title team, has been sentenced in connection with the NBA’s $5 million benefits scam, per new reporting from Law 360 reporter Pete Brush. Allen was charged with illegally taking close to $420,000 from the scam but paid back most of the money before being sentenced. Instead of prison time, Allen received a sentence of community service and supervision.

During his court appearance, Allen gave a tearful apology, acknowledging his responsibility and expressing regret for not upholding the NBA’s core values. “I fully acknowledge my individual responsibility and I understand the gravity of my actions,” Allen reportedly told the court.

The judge presiding over the case expressed concern about overbilling but noted that Allen had repaid the money he took.
