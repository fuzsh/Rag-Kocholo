In an interview, Boston Celtics ex-defensive warhorse Tony Allen revealed details of his strategies for stopping LeBron numerous times in their rivalry in the NBA. He shared details about chasing James up and down the court, a period which he described as a fierce contest between the Celtics and the Cavaliers, both powerful teams from the Eastern Conference. In the light of memories, he mentioned the time when he was under the impression that he never saw the threat of James on some parts of the game grid, for example, in the trend of the ball getting past.

“Cleveland LeBron Scouting Report, well at the time, I must say his game was as advanced as it is now,” Allen stated. “I really wasn’t worried about him posting me because he didn’t have a post game at the time.”

Tony Allen’s Assessment of LeBron James

Allen’s detailed orientation and understanding of James’ tendencies show that he applied the mindset and tact that actually got his defensive job done. Allen planned on reading James’ anticipated movements and by using the scout, he aimed to affect James’ flow and limit his impact.

Allen’s point makes a view that James is only a single aspect of the overall defensive strategy. While James’ physique and versatility of playing either wing or center aroused a high appreciation from GMs and fans, Allen saw that there was a potential hole in his skill set, especially in the low post. Inspired by this information, Allen started to build his gameplay so he could be the exact opposite of James: a player who is a threat from the outside.

In fact, his endgame has turned out to be extremely fearsome. His capability of converting shot attempts, plus the fact that he has good court vision and passing quality makes up a complex player who can lead the entire game.
