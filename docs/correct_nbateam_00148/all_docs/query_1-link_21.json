        "text": "Former Memphis Grizzlies basketball player Tony Allen plead guilty on April 5 after being part of a $4 million health benefits scam.\n\nAllen was one of 18 former NBA players who were charged in October 2021. The 41-year-old Allen, who was a guard for the Grizzlies from 2010-17, plead guilty to conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud.\n\nCourt records showed that Allen received $265,000 for chiropractic services and $155,075 for dental services. According to Pete Brush of Law360, New York U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Moses concluded that Allen won't face restitution or forfeiture penalties since he has already repaid the money back.\n\nAllen's wife, Desiree, was also charged in the case and has plead guilty.\n\nGIANNOTTO: Of everyone Ja Morant disappointed, one person matters more than the rest | Giannotto\n\nAlso: Ja Morant's Instagram posts prompt welfare check by police on Memphis Grizzlies star\n\nAllen initially plead not guilty and was released on $500,000 bond in 2021. He will be sentenced on Aug. 8 and faces up to two years in prison. Tony Wroten, who also played for the Grizzlies, and Jamario Moon are among the other players who have plead guilty and didn't receive jail time.\n\nThe court determined Allen \"understood the consequences of his plea, including potential sentences that may be imposed,\" according to the April 10 documents.\n\nThe Grizzlies were scheduled to retire Allen's jersey in January 2022 before the ceremony was postponed. In seven seasons with the Grizzlies, Allen helped orchestrate the \"Grit and Grind Era\" by being one of the NBA's best defenders. He has also made himself available to current Grizzlies players like Ja Morant to offer career advice.\n\nAllen's jersey has not yet been retired by the Grizzlies."
