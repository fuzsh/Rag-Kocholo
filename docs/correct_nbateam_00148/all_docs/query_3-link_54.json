As a sophomore, he averaged 21.3 points and 9.4 rebounds per game.[2] For his junior season, Allen transferred to Red Mountain High School in Mesa, because the school was closer to where his mother was receiving cancer treatment. He sat out his first nine games due to Arizona Interscholastic Association transfer rules.[3][4] As a senior, Allen averaged 29.8 points, 11.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game.[5] He played Amateur Athletic Union basketball for the Compton Magic.[6]\n\nAllen was a consensus four-star recruit, with 247Sports considering him the top player from Arizona in the 2018 class.[7] On September 19, 2017, he committed to play college basketball for Utah over offers from Iowa State, Texas Tech, San Diego State and UCLA, among others.[6][8]\n\nUS college sports recruiting information for high school athletes Name Hometown High school / college Height Weight Commit date Timmy Allen\n\nSF Mesa, AZ Red Mountain (AZ) 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) 200 lb (91 kg) Sep 19, 2017 Recruiting star ratings: Scout: N/A Rivals: 247Sports: ESPN: ESPN grade: 80 Overall recruiting rankings: Rivals: 96 247Sports: 101 ESPN: —\n\nNote: In many cases, Scout, Rivals, 247Sports, and ESPN may conflict in their listings of height and weight.\n\nIn these cases, the average was taken.

He was the only Power Five player that season to average at least 17 points, seven rebounds, 2.5 assists and one steal per game.[14] Following the season, he declared for the 2020 NBA draft,[15] before returning to college.[16] As a junior, Allen averaged 17.2 points, 6.4 rebounds and 3.9 assists per game, earning First Team All-Pac-12 honors.[17]\n\nAfter a coaching change at Utah, Allen transferred to Texas.[18] He was named to the Second-team All-Big 12 as well as the All-Newcomer Team.[19] Allen averaged 12.1 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 1.2 steals per game.
