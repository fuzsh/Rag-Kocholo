        "text": "The Memphis Grizzlies have re-signed Tony Allen to a four-year contract worth $20 million, a person familiar with the agreement said Tuesday.\n\nAllen is one of the league's best perimeter defenders and a key to the Grizzlies' run to the Western Conference finals last season. He drew interest from other teams but decided to stick with a Memphis team coming off the best season in franchise history.\n\n\"Memphis stand up!!!!\" Allen wrote on his Twitter page.\n\n\"Thank you Lord for all that you've done and all that (you're) doing in my life. I am so grateful and humbled.\"\n\nAllen also thanked the Milwaukee Bucks and new coach Larry Drew for their interest in him.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because deals can't become official until July 10. Allen's signing was first reported by the Memphis Commercial Appeal.\n\nAllen was the leading vote-getter for the All-Defensive team and finished fifth in voting for the Defensive Player of the Year, an award won by Grizzlies teammate Marc Gasol.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 Allen won a championship with the Boston Celtics in 2008 before coming to Memphis. Relied on mostly for his defence, he also averaged 8.9 points this season and followed the Rudy Gay trade by making 55.7 per cent of his shots in February, tops among all guards.\n\nAllen has earned first-team All-Defensive honours in each of the last two seasons. He has made the playoffs in seven of his nine seasons since coming into the NBA as a first-round pick of the Celtics from Oklahoma State."
