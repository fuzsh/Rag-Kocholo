        "text": "The Memphis Grizzlies and Tony Allen have agreed to a four-year, $20 million deal, according to Adrian Wojnarowski. The deal will not become official until July 10 when the NBA moratorium on signings and trades comes to an end and Allen can sign the contract.\n\nAllen was named to the NBA's All-Defensive first team last season and also averaged 8.9 points and 4.6 rebounds per game. The 31-year-old helped the Grizzlies reach the Western Conference Finals with an excellent postseason peformance. In addition to his great defense, he averaged 12 points in a first round win over the Clippers, including 19 points, seven rebounds and six assists in the series-clinching victory.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks, Detroit Pistons, Los Angeles Clippers and Atlanta Hawks were all rumored to be in pursuit of Allen, but he spurned them for a Memphis return. He was considered a key part of the team that captured the attention of the city with its tough, gritty play, which is a style that suits Allen's defensive intensity.\n\nThere are concerns about the length of the deal because he will be 35 when it ends and $5 million per season is a lot to pay a defensive specialist, but Memphis officials deemed him integral to their team and paid him like it.\n\nMore from SB Nation:\n\n• The NBA's top 90 free agents | All NBA free agency news\n\n• Grading the NBA free agent deals\n\n• Tyreke Evans and the suddenly hot free agent market\n\n• Rondo's on board with Boston's rebuild"
