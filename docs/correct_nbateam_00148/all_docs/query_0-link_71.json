        "text": "One of Tony Allen’s favorite tools was the long-outlawed arm bar – as good a means as any of keeping an attacker from muscling his way to the basket. That’s why, when he looks out at the league now, Allen isn’t sure how his old style of defense would work in an NBA re-jiggered for more scoring and less contact on the wing.\n\nThat’s also why the former Celtic and Grizzly, three-time all-defense first-teamer and two-time second-teamer, is so impressed by how Marcus Smart manages under the new conditions.\n\n“That’s my boy,” Allen said last week of his fellow Oklahoma State alumnus. “I’ve been tracking his career for a long time. We were both recruited by the same guy at Oklahoma State (Chris Ferguson). There were times I visited the school and would see him, and it excites me to see what he’s doing now.\n\n“I won’t say he’s my protégé, really, but he’s become that 3-and-D player everyone wants. With what he does defensively, he’s also become a shooter. He’s really transitioned to the new game.”\n\nAllen has a confession here. There’s one part of the defensive game, anyway, where Smart has the edge between these two former Cowboys.\n\n“I hated taking charges – you get older you get it in the back of your mind you’re going to get hurt,” Allen said of something that Smart has turned into an art form, with the help of a dramatic flair that draws laughs and curses from opponents across the league.\n\n“Those antics,” Allen laughingly calls it.\n\nBut Smart’s emergence as a defender for all positions – he’s already guarded all five this season – has taken another step after making his first all-defensive first team last year. He’s defending from the opposite end of the range as Draymond Green, but their versatility is the same.\n\nKendrick Perkins’ fertile Twitter account jumped late in overtime last Wednesday, when Smart lunged parallel with the floor while stripping the ball from Kawhi Leonard and knocking it out of bounds off the Clippers star’s foot.\n\n“We might just be watching this year DPOY, Marcus Smart,” tweeted the former Celtic, whose job it once was to protect the back of the 2008 Defensive Player of the Year, Kevin Garnett.\n\nAnd as in most other seasons, save for Leonard in 2014-15 and ’15-16 and Ron Artest in 2003-04, the award is dominated by players like Garnett – traditional rim protectors. You have to go back to 1995-96 to find the last guard (Gary Payton) to win the award.\n\nThat’s why there may have been a bit of wishful thinking behind Perkins’ love for Smart.\n\nA young Allen was also on that 2008 Celtics team. He eventually emerged as one of the greatest perimeter defenders of his era, but beyond a few supporters like Tom Thibodeau, never had a strong chance of winning Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nAllen believes it’s time to re-think who wins the award. And Smart may not be a bad place to start.\n\n“I would think he would get consideration for that,” said Allen. “For a long time it’s been bigs, bigs, bigs, and the narrative should change, because there are some guards who are the best defenders in the game.\n\n“You have (Rudy) Gobert, (Anthony Davis), and not a lot of other centers in the league that I would call elite defenders. For guards, the assignments are tough every night. There’s not a lot of off-nights. It’s a big plate to eat off of, man.”\n\nIt wasn’t lost on Allen, who literally coined the “Grit and Grind” movement in Memphis, that teammate Marc Gasol was named the 2013 Defensive Player of the Year despite making only the second team. Allen was a first-teamer that year, but to no avail.\n\n“I was cool about it,” he said. “But for a lot of things get overshadowed by blocked shots. Setting the perimeter is just as difficult.\n\n“We’ll have to see how it goes now, because so many teams are going small – you see the Golden State Warriors with four guards and Draymond Green. I know there’s a lot of coaches who wouldn’t mind just putting two bigs on the floor and making the other team adjust, but maybe that’s changing now in the other direction.”\n\nA direction personified, increasingly, by the Celtics guard.\n\n“He’s already a tough-nosed player,” said Allen. “I like his intensity, his toughness, defensive aptitude – he likes to take charges, something I wasn’t for. He’s always fired up. The list goes on and on.\n\n“I see a lot of ways in him that I used to wire myself up. The way he makes a steal and then he starts screaming. All the antics. I love it. It takes a great defender to know another one. If I had a chance to say something to him now, I’d say keep up what you’re doing, but make the commitment that whoever you’re guarding that night, they’re only going to get half of what they average.\n\n“Just another fiery kid, man.”\n\nRise of Allen?\n\nPerkins’ rise from omnipresent tweeter to one of ESPN’s newest stars has inspired Allen, his old Celtics teammate.\n\nAllen still lives in Memphis, and is taking part in a podcast in conjunction with the Grizzlies. But he also has his eyes on a lot more.\n\n“Trying to take over, re-ID myself,” said Allen, who also has plans to start his own elite youth camp in Memphis, along the lines of Kobe Bryant’s youth academy, except with a focus on, naturally, defense. “Perk’s doing great with it. Him, Paul Pierce, Kevin, they’re all great at sharing their knowledge of the game.”\n\nCeltics timeline\n\nMonday, 7:30 p.m. vs. Sacramento – A revenge game so soon. The Celtics lost in Sacramento by a point on Nov. 17 when Smart rimmed out a floater, and after Buddy Hield exploded with 35 points.\n\nWednesday, 7 vs. Brooklyn – Kyrie Irving played in Cleveland once as a Celtic – opening night of the 2017-18 season – and never returned. Now that he’s been ruled out of the Nets’ three-game road trip with an ongoing shoulder issue, beginning today in MSG against the Knicks and continuing through, you guessed it, Cleveland, he’ll then get off on a similar foot in his post-relationship with Boston. He would have faced the music here, undoubtedly. Those still curious about what an Irving return to the Garden will look like have to wait until March 3. Unless these two teams somehow meet in the playoffs, that will be Brooklyn’s last Garden visit of the season."
