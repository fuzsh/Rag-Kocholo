        "text": "Tony Allen, a longtime fan favorite for the Memphis Grizzlies, is back on the basketball court.\n\nThe 41-year-old Allen, dubbed \"The Grindfather\" during his seven-season tenure in Memphis as a member of the \"Core Four,\" signed Wednesday with the BIG3, a professional 3-on-3 summer basketball league co-founded and run by rapper and actor Ice Cube.\n\nAllen will suit up for 3's Company, which features several other prominent former NBA players, including Mario Chalmers, who played two seasons for the Grizzlies.\n\nAllen is slated to be in uniform Sunday for 3's Company's at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nMemphis is among the sites of the BIG3's 10-week season, which began June 25. The league will play its games at FedExForum on July 15.\n\nFormer Memphis Tiger Robert Dozier is on the 3 Headed Monster roster.\n\nIn April, Allen pleaded guilty on April 5 after being part of a $4 million health benefits scam. He was one of 18 former NBA players who were charged in October 2021. The Grizzlies were scheduled to retire Allen's jersey in January 2022, but the ceremony was postponed. In seven seasons with the Grizzlies, Allen helped orchestrate the \"Grit and Grind Era\" by being one of the NBA's best defenders.\n\nJA MORANT: Why Isaiah Thomas believes Derrick Rose signing could lead to Ja Morant's 'best season yet'\n\nReach sports writer Jason Munz at jason.munz@commercialappeal.com or on Twitter @munzly."
