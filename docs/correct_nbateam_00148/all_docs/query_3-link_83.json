        "text": "CHICAGO – The Celtics were given yesterday off, and Tony Allen presumably remained close to the team base following the news that he has been the subject of death threats in his hometown.\n\nTeam officials continued to decline comment, though at their request NBA security beefed up its detail during Monday night’s Game 2 at TD Banknorth Garden because of the threats.\n\nTwo Chicago sources familiar with Allen and his hometown associates – past and present – yesterday connected a group of Allen associates to a fatal shooting in the parking lot of the famous Rock ’n’ Roll McDonald’s last August.\n\nThe group had been attending a birthday party for former Celtic Antoine Walker at the downtown club Excalibur when a fight occurred, extending into the McDonald’s parking lot.\n\nCurtis Ellis, 25, was killed, and another person riding in the same car with Ellis was taken to a nearby hospital in critical condition.\n\nAccording to both sources, this is the same group that was with Allen when the Celtics guard had an early morning fight with Marktwain Johnson and Nigel Odum in a Chicago restaurant in August 2005.\n\nThough Allen was charged with aggravated battery, the charges from the 2005 incident were later dismissed.\n\nOne source said that Allen later offered to pay the medical expenses for one of the two men – which man is unclear – though Rahsaan Gordon, the attorney representing Johnson and Odum in a pending civil suit, denied that claim yesterday.\n\nAllen will return to Chicago in July for a court date in the civil suit. At that time he will have to testify about the 2005 incident.\n\nBoth sources said Allen’s current troubles are somehow connected to last summer’s incident, and that the Celtics guard allegedly has incurred a heavy financial debt to someone in Chicago and he now refuses to repay.\n\nElla Allen, who moved out of Chicago shortly after her son became a Celtic five years ago, expressed surprise yesterday, and said she was unaware of reports that the death threats started last year.\n\n“I’m trying to find out what’s going on right now,” said Ella, who saw her son once briefly since the Celtics arrived in Chicago on Wednesday night for Game 3 and Game 4 of their NBA playoff series against the Bulls. “When I got to the office and heard about it, it knocked me completely off my feet.\n\n“I saw Tony only briefly – I kissed him and kept moving,” she said. “He was in great spirits. But right now what I’m feeling is panic – like oh my God, where is this coming from?”"
