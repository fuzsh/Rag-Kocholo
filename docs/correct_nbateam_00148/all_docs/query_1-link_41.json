        "text": "STILLWATER - Former Oklahoma State standout Tony Allen of the Memphis Grizzlies earned NBA first-team all-defense recognition, it was announced today. Allen secured 207 points and 88 first-team votes from a panel of 129 sportswriters and broadcasters throughout the United States and Canada, with both of those totals leading all guards in the NBA.\n\nThis recognition marks the third time Allen has earned a first-team spot on the NBA all-defense team and marks the fifth time in his six years with the Grizzlies that he has finished in the top seven in voting for NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Allen previously earned first-team all-defense honors in 2011-12 and 2012-13 and was a second-teamer in 2010-11.\n\nAccording to the NBA, Memphis' defensive rating was 8.7 points better with Allen on the floor (94.9 per 100 possessions) than with him off the floor (103.6 per 100 possessions) and according to SportVU data, he held opposing shooters to a field goal percentage 7.5 percent lower than their usual shooting percentage during the regular season.\n\nDuring his time in Stillwater (2002-04), Allen was honored as the 2003 Big 12 Newcomer of the Year and 2004 Big 12 Player of the Year. He earned a spot on the Big 12 all-defense team in 2004 before being selected in the first round (27th overall) of the 2004 NBA Draft.\n\nJoining Allen on the 2014-15 NBA all-defensive first team are NBA Defensive Player of the Year Kawhi Leonard from the San Antonio Spurs (242 points/116 first-team votes), Draymond Green from the Golden State Warriors (229 points/107 first-team votes), DeAndre Jordan from the Los Angeles Clippers (187 points/84 first-team votes) and Chris Paul from the Los Angeles Clippers (170 points/67 first-team votes.)"
