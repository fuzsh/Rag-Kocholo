        "text": "It felt like things were about to take a turn for the worst for Grizzlies legend Tony Allen, but fortunately, that won't be the case.\n\nAllen was officially sentenced to community service and supervision for his part in a $4 million health benefits scam, according to Pete Brush of Law360. He had previously pleaded guilty in April to conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud, and also paid back most of the $420,000 he illegally took before getting charged. According to Brush, Allen gave a tearful apology.\n\n“I fully acknowledge my individual responsibility and I understand the gravity of my actions,” Allen said. \"As a member of the NBA community I failed to uphold our core values.”\n\nTony Allen is one of many ex-NBA players that avoided prison in the case. However, Terrence Williams, Keyon Dooling, and Alan Anderson all received shorter sentences. The judge gave an official statement about Allen's role in the case.\n\n“You seem not quite to have found your footing after your basketball career has ended,” the judge said. \"You may need to think about having a new goal – something you can work towards every day.”\n\nThis situation could have been much, much worse for Tony Allen. Fortunately, he seems to be legitimately upset about his role in the case, and will only have to serve community service as a consequence.\n\nMemphis Grizzles GM Gets Honest About Current Roster\n\nWarriors and Lakers Expected to Show Interest in Former Grizzlies Star"
