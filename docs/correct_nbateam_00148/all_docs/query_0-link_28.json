He began to show his potential in high school where he became a standout star of his team. That led him to playing in college where he began at Butler and finished at Oklahoma State. In his collegiate career he was regarded as one of the top transfers during his junior season in route to being named the Big 12 Player of the Year and Big 12 Tournament MVP in his senior season where he led his team to a Final Four appearance. Allen became the 25th overall selection in the 2004 NBA Draft going to the Boston Celtics where he played until 2010. In that span of time he became ranked 3rd in the league in steals per 48 minutes with nearly 3. Tony also aided the Celtics in capturing the 2008 NBA Championship.
