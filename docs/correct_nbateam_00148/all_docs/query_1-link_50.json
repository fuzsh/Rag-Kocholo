        "text": "STILLWATER - Former Oklahoma State All-American Tony Allen was named to the NBA's All-Defensive Second Team on Wednesday, which marked the fifth career selection to either the first or second team for Allen.\n\nAllen (6-4, 213) averaged 8.4 points, 4.6 rebounds, 1.1 assists and 1.72 steals in 25.3 minutes in 64 games (57 starts) for Memphis this season. The 34-year-old was tied for the NBA lead with Minnesota's Ricky Rubio in steals per 48 minutes (3.3) among players with a minimum of 1,500 total minutes played. The Grizzlies' defensive rating was 2.2 points better with Allen on the floor (104.1) than with him off the floor (106.3). In addition, Allen led the team with 1.7 steals per game.\n\nHe garnered First Team honors in 2014-15, 2012-13 and 2011-12 and a Second Team nod in 2010-11 to go along with his selection this season.\n\nAt OSU, Allen helped the Cowboys win the 2004 Big 12 regular season and tournament titles, and advance to the Final Four. He was named the 2004 Big 12 Conference Co-Player of the Year and the Big 12 Tournament MVP. He was drafted with the No. 27 overall pick by the Boston Celtics, and has played 12 seasons in the NBA."
