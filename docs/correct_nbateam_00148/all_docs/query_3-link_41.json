        "text": "Jonathan Givony\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nOverview: Role player who has established himself as a solid backup. Gets by mostly on his instincts and physical tools, rather than on a polished skill-set. Mostly a defensive oriented shooting guard who can contain either guard position. Extremely athletic and brings great toughness and energy to the floor. Has a role off the bench, but must harness his skill-set and learn to consistently play within himself. Slightly undersized at 6-4, but makes up for it with his 6-9 wingspan. Ranked as the 3rd best athlete in the 2004 draft. Has had some off-court distractions early on in his career.\n\nOffense: A superb athlete with outstanding explosiveness getting off his feet. Extremely quick and strong. Not a great ball-handler, cannot be expected to create his own shot on a consistent basisalthough he certainly wants to. Fairly turnover prone. Can get to the basket, though, thanks to his excellent first step and very aggressive mentalitywhich leads to a good amount of free throw attempts. Often out of control once there, making him just an average finisher. A poor outside shooter due to his extremely awkward shooting mechanics. Cocks the ball and releases it from his right shoulder. Can hit a shot from time to time, particularly when in rhythm, but is not the type of threat you want taking shots from behind the 3-point line. Not much of a passerbasketball IQ is limited. Causes his fair share of unforced errors and does not always play within himself. Tough as nails. Excellent offensive rebounder for size. Has huge hands and sticks his nose in all kinds of places. Has a decent pull-up jumper from 16-17 feet.\n\nDefense: The best man to man defender on Bostons roster. Combination of length, strength and tenacity makes him outstanding in this area. Has excellent lateral quickness. Can defend either guard position, and even some small forwards. Fantastic instincts getting in passing lanes. Will come up with his fair share of steals and go coast to coast. A little bit foul prone due to the aggressiveness he plays with."
