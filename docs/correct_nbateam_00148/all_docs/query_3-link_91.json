        "text": "2008 NBA Champion and former OSU Cowboy Tony Allen penned a heartfelt thank you letter to the city of Memphis on Wednesday afternoon via The Players Tribune.\n\nAllen thanked the city for embracing him. His blue collar style of play matched the personality of the city and he created the “grit and grind” motto that has stuck with the team through the past several seasons. Allen helped start a movement within the Grizzlies that emphasized an aggressive style of play hallmarked by elite defense and a slow-it-down style of offense. Memphis brought in other players like Allen who have made a living for themselves on the defensive end, guys like Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph.\n\nGrizzlies controlling owner Robert Pera and general manager Chris Wallace released a statement last week saying that Allen’s No. 9 jersey will one day hang in the rafters at FedEx Forum. Allen earned three first team All-NBA Defense awards and three second team All-NBA Defense awards during his career in Memphis. This helped him earn his “Grindfather” nickname. Pera and Wallace accredited Allen with being one of their “core four” guys in the process of turning around their “fortunes and surge in popularity.”\n\nIn Allen’s piece he talks about how the G&G was a way of life for the good people of Memphis.\n\nAnd I think what that showed, also, is like — man, that Grit and Grind basketball, that style of hoop that people know they’re in for when they’d come play the Grizz? It ain’t just a style of play. It’s a way of life. That’s what people don’t realize about the Grit and Grind movement. It was a way of life for our entire city. It’s a city that’s been handed nothing, and had to work for everything. You feel me? It’s like when Showtime was happening with the Lakers — it’s that flashy, starry style of play, right? And then you see Los Angeles, as a place, you know, and it’s all movies and things. Grit and Grind, it’s that same type of vibe between team and city. It’s a fit.\n\nAnd no one fit better than me. I’ll never forget it. I’ll always appreciate the city of Memphis for that: How they didn’t just let me play for them — nah. They were willing to let me represent them. [Players Tribune]\n\nAllen signed with the New Orleans Pelicans this past offseason and will join a backcourt that already boasts scoring guard Jrue Holiday and crafty pass-first playmaker Rajon Rondo. Allen will join Anthony Davis in bringing a strong defensive presence to the Pelicans and could see minutes at small forward this season. The 13th year guard and his Pelicans opened the season against his former squad in Memphis on Wednesday.\n\nHere’s TA signing off with a nod to the posters they hung of him at the Memphis airport.\n\nSo, you know — thank you for everything, Memphis. I know I wasn’t perfect … but the time I spent here was. I came over as a young player, and left as the Grindfather. I came looking for a team, and found a home.\n\nAnd I hope you’ll still remember me a little for that. I hope you’ll remember how I left it all on the court, every night. I hope you’ll remember the Spurs series, and the Clippers series, and the OKC series, and all of the others. I hope you’ll remember how we created an identity to be proud of in this city, an identity that became bigger than basketball.\n\nAnd you know what, if that’s too much — then I hope you’ll just remember me as the guy from the airport. Last person you saw going out. First person you saw coming in. That was me, man. I was Memphis. And it was one of the greatest experiences of my life. [Players Tribune]"
