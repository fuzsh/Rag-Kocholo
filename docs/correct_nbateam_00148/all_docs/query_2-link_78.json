        "text": "Tony Allen is one half of legendary country music duo Foster and Allen.\n\nAlongside his bandmate and best pal Mick Foster, Tony's incredible career has taken him all over the world to record bestselling albums and to play to sold out crowds.\n\nAway from the music, Tony is a devoted husband and father.\n\nThe Westmeath native shares two grown-up sons with his first wife, and he found love again with fellow singer Trionagh Moore, who we married in 2009.\n\nRead more: Foster and Allen's Mick Foster says separation from first wife was 'controversial' at the time\n\nMarriage to wife Trionagh\n\nTony has been married to wife Trionagh for 15 years, having met through the music scene in the early noughties.\n\nTrionagh is also a singer and provides back-up vocals for legendary country artist Daniel O'Donnell, having first worked with him in 1987. She has also recorded solo material of her own.\n\nTony says it helps his other wife is also involved in the music industry because she understands how the business works.\n\nHe told Brendan Courtney on Keys to My Life: \"I think it was a huge help. We tour around the same time because we play to the same age group of people.\"\n\nThe couple now live in Armagh and opened up their stunning home on the hit RTE Show: \"We got married in 2009. I’ve lived here nearly 35 years and Tony 20,\" Trionagh said.\n\nBreakdown of first marriage\n\nTony's marriage to Trionagh is his second. He became a dad to two sons during his first marriage, but sadly things didn't work out. The marriage came to an end in the dream home Tony built in his native Westmeath, which he unfortunately went on to lose when he went bankrupt back in 2011.\n\n\"I was here on my own for about five or six years, when I was coming and going and touring. I’d come home and I’d be there on my own,\" he said on Keys to my Life.\n\nTony Allen's children\n\nTony is a dad to grown-up sons Keith and Ian, whom he shares with his ex-wife. Trionagh also has sons Jon and Lee from a previous relationship.\n\n\"My sons are all grown up now. Keith, my youngest son, works in events in Ireland. My eldest son Ian doesn’t get involved with music. Trionagh’s son John plays music with a band in Liverpool and he’s a music teacher,\" Tony previously told RSVP Country.\n\nBeing on the road so much was tough when his kids were younger, so he and Mick made the call to lessen their workload.\n\nHe told us: \"When Maggie was number 1 in Australia in the mid 80’s Mick and I had to make a decision to pull back.\n\n\"We couldn’t play every night of the week in Ireland. So we began to tour, playing a few nights and then taking two or three nights off."
