        "text": "Tony Allen Position Shooting guard/Point guard/Small forward Height 6ft. 4in. Weight 213lb. Jersey # 42 Birthdate Jan. 11, 1982\n\nAnthony Allen (born January 11, 1982 in Chicago, Illinois), commonly referred to as Tony Allen, is a swingman for the Boston Celtics, who can play as a guard or a forward.\n\nLatest News[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nStatistics[]\n\nCollege: Oklahoma State\n\nYears pro: 4\n\nAcquired: Drafted No.25 by Boston in 2004\n\n2008/2009 salary: $2.5 million\n\nSigned through: 2009-2010\n\nLast year's numbers: 6.6 ppg, 1.5 apg, 2.2 rpg in 18 minutes\n\nStrengths[]\n\nTony Allen is a great defender, and now that James Posey is gone he is one of the only players on the team who can go up against players like LeBron James and Kobe Bryant.\n\nWeaknesses[]\n\nAllen is an inconsistent scorer.\n\nEarly career[]\n\nAllen played at Chicago's Crane High School, where he was a basketball standout. At Crane, Allen played alongside future Celtics prospect Will Bynum. A shooting guard, Allen spent his freshman year (2000-01) playing for Butler County College in El Dorado, Kansas, where he averaged 16.5 points, 6.1 rebounds and 2.8 steals, going on to being named Jayhawk West Conference Freshman of the Year. During his sophomore year (2001-02) at Wabash Valley College in Mount Carmel, Illinois, he led his team to 32-6 overall record and fourth place at the NJCAA championships.\n\nHe spent two nights in jail, but was not implicated in the shooting. Due to this incident and a rather severe right knee injury that Allen had suffered prior to the shooting, Allen missed much of the first half of the 2005-06 season. On April 24, 2007, the charges against Allen were dropped in a Chicago court. tearing both the tearing (ACL) and Medial collateral ligament (MCL). Allen underwent a successful tearing on January 13 at New England Baptist Hospital and was sidelined for the rest of the season. He made a fast return to the court for his type of knee injury only nine months later during the following preseason, even though not at full strength. However, the explosiveness he displayed prior to the injury was noted as \"sorely lacking\".\n\nPersonal[]\n\nIn his spare time, Tony Allen enjoys listening to music, and is considered somewhat of a music \"connoisseur\" by his Celtic teammates. He also frequently assists the Celtics in charity work in and around the Boston area. Allen was born to Ella Allen, and he has two sisters, Ebony and Dominique, and a brother, Ryan."
