        "text": "His longest streak of scoring in double figures during the 2007-08 Boston Celtics’ season was just two games.\n\nTony Allen needed just a month this season to surpass that number, cracking double digits in three straight recent Celtics’ victories.\n\nAllen, whose minutes were reduced a year ago in favor of James Posey, averaged 14 points on 16-for-23 shooting off the bench in wins over the Detroit Pistons, Minnesota Timberwolves and Toronto Raptors.\n\nWith Posey now playing for the New Orleans Hornets and Allen bouncing back from January 2007 knee surgery, he is making consistent contributions off the bench.\n\n“He’s been great,’’ said Ray Allen, whose team faced the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday night at the TD Banknorth Garden. “He’s given us a lift. He’s given us that punch off the bench.\n\n“Scoring off the bench is big in the NBA and to have one of the better benches in the league is definitely important.’’\n\nTony Allen, who is averaging nearly 20 minutes per game, had not scored in double figures in more than two consecutive games 2006-07 season. He went on a 14-game tear from Dec. 13, 2006-Jan. 10, 2007, taking the scoring load when Paul Pierce was injured.\n\nThen, Tony Allen injured his knee against the Indiana Pacers, missed the rest of the season and struggled a year ago.\n\nSlowly but surely, he is rounding back into form and helping to fill the void left by Posey.\n\n“My biggest thing is not getting complacent,’’ said Tony Allen. “I’m still working hard, still trying to get after it every day. I’m going against Paul Pierce, one of the most prolific scorers in the league and Ray Allen, one of the best shooters. Just switching up with those two in practice every day (helps).\n\n“A year ago at this time I was down, I was sad. Practice was a lot quicker and faster than me. This year, I feel better.’’\n\nNelson proud:\n\nWarriors coach Don Nelson, whose No. 19 is retired in the Garden rafters, was pulling for his former team during their run to the championship last spring.\n\n“I was very proud of them,’’ said Nelson, who played 872 games for the Celtics from 1965-76. “I wish I could have been here, but it wouldn’t have looked good, probably.\n\n“You’re always part of this franchise if you played here. That’s the beauty of being a Celtic. That’ll never change. I root for them when we’re not playing them and I was one of their biggest fans (last season).’’\n\nReunion for O’Bryant:\n\nLittle-used center Patrick O’Bryant, who spent the first two years of his career with Golden State, met up with his former team. O’Bryant left the Warriors after signing a free-agent contract with the Celtics last summer.\n\nO’Bryant played only 22 games through the first 15 games and has been on the inactive list at times.\n\n“He’s coming along,’’ said Rivers. “He’s working hard. He’s a great kid. Early in the year and in preseason, we were really on him about the tempo of his work and he’s been terrific.\n\n“In the few practices we’ve had you can see the improvement and he’s just got to keep working.’’\n\nHome for the holiday:\n\nRivers was scheduled to take a private jet home to central Florida after the game and spend Thanksgiving with his family.\n\n“It’s my favorite holiday. No gifts,’’ said Rivers. “No greed involved, except with your fork and knife, and that’s always pretty good.’’"
