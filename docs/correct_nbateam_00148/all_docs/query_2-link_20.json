        "text": "Carmen, a fact-checking friend of the Doo-Wop Society, has researched the life of Tony Allen, who was known for his biographical creativity, and come up with the following information:\n\nFor Tony Allen to fondly call a woman \"Mother\" whom he states was his aunt implies that his birth mother, Johnnie M. Allen, was probably gone from his life, by age 7 per the 1940 U.S. Census, during which the alleged aunt & her husband Claude L. Love are shown living in Shreveport with their 7-year-old cousin Oscar Allen. Oscar almost certainly is the young Tony Allen. No documentation has been found yet which confirms that Neiti Jones Love and/or Claude Love are actually related to Tony Allen.\n\nThe Loves relocated in 1942-1943 to Los Angeles, the city where Tony Allen eventually became known as a singer/recording artist. Whether young Tony was brought with the couple during the move, or at what point he arrived in Los Angeles, is not yet known. He stated in his bio that he attended junior high & high school in Los Angeles, and named four known music figures as his schoolmates. However, per birth dates he was too old to have gone to school with three of these music figures; only the fourth, Arthur Lee Maye, was near his age.\n\nThe first found record of Tony's being in Los Angeles is 1955, in a local newspaper article for a gig. His father Oscar Allen, a butcher, is documented as living in Shreveport as of 1941 until 1946, after which he disappears from any found public documentation. Note that Tony says in his bio that his father disapproved of his musical aspirations, even after Tony began making records (i.e. the 1950s). This indicates that Oscar was still in existence in the 1950s (unless Tony was fabricating the lore about the disapproval). Possibly young Tony was passed back to his dad to live with him in the early 1940s, and did not arrive in Los Angeles until later.\n\nA chronology of what public records info can be found on Tony's alleged aunt & uncle Neiti & Claude is as follows:\n\n1. 1896, Claude Love born on June 28 in Arcadia, Louisiana (30 miles east of Shreveport), per his WWII draft card; the 1940 Census says he was born in Texas.\n\n2. 1898, Neiti Jones born on February 27 in Louisiana to Pearl Taylor & Alex Jones. This is per retroactive data on other documents. There is no contemporary 1898 birth record found.\n\n3. 1900-1910, Neiti grows up in semi-rural Sabine County, Louisiana, which is about 40 mi. S of Shreveport.\n\n4. By 1937, Neiti Jones & Claude Love marry. She has a 5th grade education, he first. He works as driver for a family, and mechanic's helper for Arkansas-Louisiana Gas Co.\n\n5. The 1940 Census, conducted in April, lists a household in Shreveport, Louisiana, of the married couple Neiti & Claude Love; the household includes their 7-year-old male cousin named Oscar Allen. No other children are shown. Age 7 would be Tony Allenâs stated age at the time, and this child has that same surname, plus âOscarâ was the name of Tonyâs father. This Oscar Allen (Jr.) almost certainly is the young Tony Allen.\n\n6. 1942 or 1943, Neiti & Claude Love move from Shreveport to Los Angeles. Neiti later lives in several different residences, all within the same general vicinity in South Central L.A., without Claude shown listed with her. Tony Allen says in his bio that he was sent to live \"with his aunt [Neiti];\" but doesn't mention Uncle Claude at all. By 1946, Neiti lives at 4403-1/2 S. Central Avenue.\n\n7. The 1950 Census, conducted in April, shows Neiti Love living alone in Los Angeles at 1579-1/2 E. Vernon Avenue. Her marital status is âseparated.â Tony would have been age 17 at the time and in his senior year of high school. Oscar/Tony Allen and Claude Love do not appear on the 1950 Census, anywhere. Neiti lived at that address as late as 1958.\n\n8. 1960, Neiti is at 4305 Morgan Ave.\n\n9. 1965, Neiti is at 1523 E. 43rd Street., and Claude says he lives there too. For this reason, it appears they are no longer separated. She is working as a maid at The Belmont, a vintage hotel which was in DTLA at 251 S. Hill St. Claude is a porter, but his employer is unknown.\n\n10. 1965, August 11 - The infamous Watts Riots commence, and four days later, August 15, Neiti is fatally shot in the neck in the riot zone by a National Guardsman at 51st St. and Avalon Blvd., a bit south of her home. Time was around 10 pm. Claude was in the car as a passenger and survived a bullet to each his left arm and left leg. The reason for the shooting as reported in the Los Angeles Times is that she drove through a barricade at that location, where the Guard was stationed. She is one of 34 persons to die in the Watts riots.\n\n11. There was no explanation why a poor, struggling black senior citizen couple, ages 67 and 69, working menial jobs as a maid and porter, would be doing out at night in a riot which had been raging for five days, intentionally driving through a militarized barricade.\n\n12. August 26, 1965 - Neiti's death certificate information is signed as dictated by Claude as widower. Burial is slated for Lincoln Memorial Park in Carson. In the following month, the Los Angeles Coroner's inquest jury returned a decision of \"Justifiable Homicide\" re Neiti, for \"ignoring the Guard's warning to halt\" at the blockade. The Guard testified that the car had been traveling 30mph toward them, then its headlights went out and the car speeded up and proceeded toward the blockade. Six to eight Guardsmen fired at the car. Claude Love gave conflicting testimony, that they were on their way home from a friend's house, were stopped by police, and fired upon.\n\n13. After 1966, Claude Love disappears from any found records in Los Angeles and Louisiana."
