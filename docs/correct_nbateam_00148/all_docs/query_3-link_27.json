        "text": "STILLWATER Days before his first class at Oklahoma State, months before the first practice, Tony Allen was arrested for his role in a parking lot riot at a Whataburger.\n\nNearly two years later, a player who bounced between two junior college programs and was once shielded from the media because of his poor communication skills is a team spokesman, a baptized believer and soon-to-be college graduate.\n\n\"The Tony I knew 10 years ago is not the Tony I see now,\" said his mother, Ella. \"By the grace of God, it's worked out better than I could have ever thought in a million years. Tony had a lot of kinks to work out. The change has been tremendous. It makes me want to cry.\"\n\nAllen has led Oklahoma State in scoring this season. He's been picked by coaches as the Big 12 Conference Player of the Year and conference tournament MVP. He and the Cowboys leave today for the NCAA Tournament first round in Kansas City, Mo. OSU opens the tournament Friday afternoon against Eastern Washington.\n\nBut with all his basketball success, it's Allen's transformation away from Gallagher-Iba Arena that most pleases OSU coach Eddie Sutton.\n\n\"Of all the players we've had here, Tony has made more progress off the court than any of them,\" Sutton said. \"This is why I've stayed in coaching.\"\n\nChicago streets Allen grew up in Chicago in a single-parent home with a younger brother and two younger sisters. He has a relationship with his father, but his mother raised him, steering him toward sports to keep him out of trouble.\n\nThe tough world of Big 12 basketball taking charges from Colorado 7-footer David Harrison and banging inside with Texas bruiser James Thomas is nothing compared to the lessons Allen learned on concrete slabs of his youth.\n\n\"When you went into the lane, you might get an elbow to the eye. It would be swollen for a whole week,\" Allen said. \"Busted lips. Scraped arms. If it's game point, they'll keep fouling you. You have to (almost) throw in a half-court shot just to win a game. But it gives you a tough mindset.\"\n\nBut those rough and troublesome neighborhoods can be a bad influence. Some of Allen's childhood friends are in prison. Others are holding down menial jobs.\n\n\"Tony had a street mentality,\" said Marilyn Middlebrook, OSU's assistant athletic director for academic services. \"He was rough around the edges. He had never really excelled in school. He wanted to play basketball. That's why he came here.\n\n\"He came in doubtful. He wondered if he was worth anything, whether he could succeed at anything. Sure, he still has a lot of the Chicago streets in him. But with Coach Sutton, the other coaches and teammates, who he dearly loves, he has come so far.\"\n\nAllen and his former coach at Butler (Kan.) Community College won't elaborate, but Allen admitted, \"I got into a little trouble at Butler.\"\n\nBecause of that, Allen transferred to Wabash Valley (Ill.) College, the defending junior college national champion. With advice from his mother, Allen chose OSU over Clemson, Cincinnati, Michigan State and Kansas.\n\nBut Allen's troubles continued at OSU. The Whataburger incident involved 300 people and was linked to rival groups from OSU and Langston. Allen and teammate Cheyne Gadson were arrested for obstruction, assault and resisting an officer.\n\n\"I'm a different person now,\" Allen said. \"It's little things. I try to watch how I talk around kids, have more respect for everyone, try to be a more humble person. Not be so wild all the time and do my own thing.\"\n\nSpiritual transformation OSU basketball equipment manager Collin Walker constantly asked Allen if he'd like to attend Sunday service at Eagle Heights Baptist Church in Stillwater. Allen always declined.\n\nThen one day, he agreed.\n\nLast September, Allen was baptized at Eagle Heights, dunked into a metal trough.\n\n\"It kind of had me in tears,\" Allen said. \"After all the bad things I had done, I felt it was time to get baptized. My body just felt clean. I felt like a new person.\"\n\nAsk anyone around him and they tell you Allen is a new person. His mother, a domestic violence counselor in Chicago, was convinced Stillwater would be a good fit for her son.\n\n\"I wanted Tony to come to place where the pace was slow,\" Ella said. \"Tony needed time to find out who Tony was. He didn't need to be around those bad elements he had been used to.\"\n\nAllen always had confidence on a basketball court. But deep inside, he searched for answers. Surrounded by coaches, teammates and administrators who stressed the benefits of making wise choices, Allen matured.\n\n\"Before I got baptized, before I got saved, I was worried all the time,\" Allen said. \"I was worried how my life was going to go, worried where I was headed, whether I was going to be a failure. A lot of worrying. I thank God that He now has a purpose for me.\"\n\nTerrence Crawford is one of several teammates who said they've noticed a dramatic difference in Allen since he arrived on campus the summer of 2002.\n\n\"Definitely,\" Crawford said. \"You can tell he's more at ease with God in his life. He knows he can depend on other people. That's what is so good about this team we know we can lean on each other if we need help with anything.\"\n\nMaking the grade Allen's friend, Will Bynum, was a sophomore at Crane Technical Prep Academy. Allen remembers the day Bynum bragged about recruiting letters he received from Division I basketball powers Arizona, Mississippi State and Georgia Tech.\n\n\"Man,\" Bynum told Allen. \"I think they're looking at me because my grades are on track.\"\n\nAllen rarely took school seriously. He ignored homework assignments. As a result, poor grades prevented Allen from playing at Julian High School.\n\nAfter talking with Bynum, who plays at Georgia Tech, Allen transferred to Crane his junior year and was determined to improve his grades. It wasn't until his senior year that Allen finally became a starter.\n\nAt OSU, Allen has approached academics as if he were trying to race past a defender for a slam dunk. Assisted by a facilitator, who has helped him improve his study habits, Allen needs only a three-hour foreign language course this summer to earn his degree in education.\n\nAllen's grades have improved so much he has made the honor roll at OSU four times. He will graduate with a grade point average better than 3.0.\n\n\"Tony has enough street in him. That's what makes him tough on the ball court,\" Middlebrook said. \"We tried to show him it could also make him tough in academics. You just have to challenge him in the class room the same way. We set high expectations, and he's succeeded.\"\n\nLast season, Sutton didn't allow Allen to talk to the media for more than three months.\n\nHe was protecting Allen, who needed to polish his communication skills. This season, Allen has conducted dozens of interviews.\n\n\"He's come so far,\" Middlebrook said. \"Now he's the one who is teaching other people how to write papers or work the computer. His vocabulary is so much better. He loves to use big words now, words people don't expect from him. He really enjoys that.\"\n\nPro potential Once OSU's season ends, Allen will focus on a possible NBA career. Allen will be among 60 players invited to an NBA pre-draft camp June 1-4 in Chicago.\n\nLabeled a \"tweener,\" a guard who can play on the perimeter or post up smaller defenders, Allen could make an NBA roster. If not, there will be overseas opportunities. Regardless of where he ends up, Middlebrook predicts Allen will triumph.\n\n\"Tony knows he can succeed at things he never thought he could,\" Middlebrook said. \"He knows hard work and high expectations will get him to the next level, whatever that may be, whether it's the NBA or life.\n\n\"He has a confidence now he didn't have when he first got here. He knew he could play ball. That wasn't a doubt. What he didn't know was he could be as good as he wanted to be in every aspect of life.\"\n\nDuring his 34-year career, Sutton has witnessed firsthand, and heard stories from other coaches, about kids who \"would either be dead or in prison\" if it wasn't for college sports.\n\nSutton said, without question, he gets the most gratification of his career from success stories like Allen.\n\n\"I know what he's achieved on and off the court,\" Sutton said. \"There are so many (bad) things you read in the newspaper and see on television. There's not enough stories told about people like Tony.\"\n\nAfter the Cowboys clinched their first Big 12 title with a win over Texas, Sutton and Allen embraced near midcourt at Gallagher-Iba Arena.\n\n\"We're all close,\" Sutton said. \"But after that game, when I went to shake hands, Tony came up to me and gave me the biggest hug. He'll always be very, very special to me because of what he's done, how far he's come.\"\n\nArchive ID: 1764183"
