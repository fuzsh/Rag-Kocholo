        "text": "BOSTON -96—- LOS ANGELES-89\n\nGAME 4- Boston, Massachusetts\n\n*The first three quarters of last night’s Game 4 might have been the most miserable 3 quarters of basketball I have ever seen. The first three quarters of last night’s game rivaled any CYO game ever played. The game was downright ugly. The Celtics missed several lightly contested layups and many open look jumpers. The offense of the Celtics has left a lot to be desired through four games, but their defense has been relentless. Thank Thibodeau for that!\n\n*The Celtics also got a huge pick me up from the bench. Words will never do justice to describe exactly what they accomplished last night. Glen Davis plays with heart and sometimes that is even better than having any talent. He battles for every ball, crashes the glass, and hustles on every play. I can’t even make fun of him for drooling and slobbering on himself after a huge and one put back. He got me fired up to the point where I was screaming and yelling, jumping up and down, and fist pumping in my own living room. I love seeing players play with emotion and The Ticket Stub has it. Of course the line of the night came from Mark Jackson: “What do babies do? They drool, babies do that.”\n\n*Eddie Who? Doc Rivers has said all along that Nate Robinson would win a playoff game for the Celtics. He did that in Orlando for Game 6, and along with his partner Shrek (Big Baby) they won Game 4 for the Celts. In case you missed it, Nate the Great referred to he and Baby as Shrek and Donkey. Ya gotta love it! Nate provides that same spark that Davis does off the bench. They play with all the emotion and heart in the world. Nate banged 2 quick 3’s and then was able to penetrate into the paint and get some buckets there as well. I didn’t even mind the technical he got for getting in Odom’s face. That got the crowd into a frenzy and picked up the team as well. It helped the Celts get that swag back. It didn’t hurt that D-Fish missed the free throw as well.\n\n*While Tony Allen can be somewhat frustrating on offense, he has played lockdown defense all playoff long. When called upon he has played Kobe Bryant as good as anyone can play the greatest player on the planet. He has forced Kobe into taking difficult shots and Kobe hasn’t had anything easy. Tony has come a long way from the days of biting on every single upfake causing him to foul someone in the act of shooting. I am really going to hate to see Tony leave for a higher pay day at the end of this season. I love his ADHD mentality on the court and also on the bench when he simply can’t sit down for more than 3 minutes. He is constantly up screaming and yelling encouragement to those on the floor. He is the consummate team player.\n\n*There was no bigger shot in last night’s game then Sheed nailing the three from the top of the key to ice the game. I have been hard on Rasheed all year long and I stick by that. However, the truth is the man knows how to win and his experience in the post season has been invaluable to this team. He has played in your face defense on the big pansy known as Pau Gasol. More importantly he hasn’t done anything to hurt the team which was characteristic of him throughout the regular season.\n\n*Huge props to Doc for staying with the bench in the 4th quarter. The man can coach and he showed that last night. The bench wasn’t looking to “get anyone going” which has been the problem with the starters. The bench just ran the offense and took what the Lakers gave them. This needs to translate to the starters for the rest of the series. If that happens the Celtics will take the title.\n\nFiled under: Celtics, NBA | Tagged: Doc Rivers, Glen Davis, Nate Robinson, Rasheed Wallace, Tony Allen | 2 Comments »\n\nAs tough as it is for me to admit, I confess to watching the majority of the Celtics vs. Lakers game last night. For those of you that regularly follow this blog, you know how I feel about the NBA. Last night did little to dissuade my hatred for the brand of basketball that the NBA presents on a nightly basis, but I felt obligated to at least pay a moderate amount of attention to the game. That being said, I certainly didn’t limit myself to one sporting event, that just wouldn’t be right (looking forward to seeing Strasburg vs. Heyward for the next 6-10 years)…\n\n-Consider these statistics:\n\nfg: 11-33, 3pt fg: 8-19, ft: 4-4, reb: 7 total, ast: 4, pts: 34\n\nFor those of you who haven’t figured it out yet, those are Ray Allen’s stats over the last two games. Not great, but not overly terrible either. Granted, all 11 fg’s, 8 3pt fg’s, and 32 of 34 points were scored on Sunday…but did you really expect a repeat performance? We have all come to know and love Ray Allen, and know and love the fact that when he’s hot the man is unstoppable (see Sunday night). But, we have also consequently come to know and…accept that when Ray is off his game it’s pretty damn ugly. If you showed me that stat line above for Ray and told me over those two games the Celts would be 1-1, that would be just about what I have expected. All Celtics’ fans should be thankful that Ray Allen won game two (with a moderate amount of assistance from Rondo), but it would be (or have been) very unrealistic for fans to expect him to continue that performance throughout the course of the series.\n\n-I do have some real concern regarding Allen though. Despite his dreadful performance for the first 40-44 minutes of game 3, I always expect Ray to hit at least one big three down the stretch…which never happened. May this possibly be a sign that 34 year old legs on a jump shooter need more than one day off in between games to fully recover?\n\n– It was nice to see Kevin Garnett show up to the game. I actually began to miss his consistent barrage of F bombs a bit. But, despite Garnett’s improved performance offensively, I still wasn’t happy with his play. Garnett ended the game with only 6 rebounds and 1 block (while only managing to get to the line 4 times). In order for the Celtics to be successful, they need Garnett to impose his will underneath. Perkins is trying to battle underneath, but he’s overmatched against two seven footers. Garnett needs to stop doing his best Misty May-Treanor impression and start grabbing some boards.\n\n-Rasheed Wallace has been the Celtics’ best post defender so far in this series…no wonder why they are down two games to one.\n\n-As I said when I commented on Scotty’s 2010 NBA Finals Preview, If Pierce doesn’t get the best of Ron Artest, the Celtics would have a tough time winning this series. So far it’s Artest 2 – Pierce 0, with 1 no decision (considering Artest was in foul trouble almost all of game 3). Doc needs to find a way to get the catalyst going. Whether is implementing screens for Pierce to run off of (similar to the offense run for Ray), or maybe going with a different lineup to create some match up issues, something needs to be done to get Pierce into this series.\n\n-Glen “Big Baby” Davis essentially defines the term “leave it all on the court.” On a nightly basis he is clearly hardest working Celtic on the court, diving after rebounds, flopping all over the place, taking elbows to the face, doing whatever it takes to try and grab a victory for his team. Sadly, Baby’s inability to finish at the rim has really hurt Boston this series. Countless time his size underneath has hindered his offensive performance by either his shots getting blocked or not being able to get his shot off at all. He’s a great role player, but to rely on him to contribute consistently on offense is unrealistic, and has hurt the Celtics in this series.\n\n-Tony Allen is doing a pretty good job playing tight defense on Kobe, but every time Allen touches the ball I cringe at the possibility of him committing a turnover or taking a stupid shot.\n\n-When Nate Robinson enters the game, the offense falls apart completely. The ball doesn’t rotate, players are not moving, and before you know it Robinson is throwing up a three pointer because there are three seconds left on the shot clock. I know Rondo needs a breather on occasion, but the Celtics can’t afford to have periods of offensive stagnancy. I wouldn’t mind seeing Nate get some time alongside Rondo and see what kind of spark that would give the offense (granted then you need to determine who is going to cover Kobe).\n\n-Thank god Lamar Odom has yet to show up or this series would be over.\n\n-Rondo has improved his game dramatically even from the beginning of the season. He has recently shown the ability to consistently knock down the 15-18 foot jump shot. He is getting to the hoop with relative ease, and while his ability to finish at the hoop is questionable at times, he has a knack of finding the open man in a crowded paint. Sadly for Rajon, the open man has been unable to finish the play consistently throughout this entire series. Too many times has Garnett and Perkins either missed bunnies or didn’t even attempt to take the shot at all and kick the ball out to the three point line. What happened to the days when KG was stuffing the ball down Gasol’s throat after he slammed it through the rim? What happened to the Perkins of March that kept the ball above his shoulders when he caught it? Rajon has supplanted himself in the discussion as one of the top point guards in the game (although I’m still saying he’s maybe top 5), but he’s not yet good enough to carry this team through the Los Angeles Lakers on their way to an NBA Championship. Rondo needs help, and I have yet to see where it is going to come from…\n\nFiled under: Celtics, NBA | Tagged: Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis, Kevin Garnett, Nate Robinson, Paul Pierce, Rajon Rondo, Rasheed Wallace, Ray Allen, Tony Allen | 1 Comment »\n\nThis post season has been spectacular thus far for the Boston Celtics. They have taken down 2 superstars in Dwayne Wade and LeBron James. They are up two games on Dwight Howard. If I had of been told this between January and February, I would have laughed in your face. But like a light switch the Celtics were able to turn it on at the right time. Not because anyone player has stepped up, but because the synergy of the Celtics has reigned supreme.\n\nSure, Rajon Rondo has played out of his mind and has proven that he is in fact a top five point guard in the League. But the ability of the team to play around him and for him to set everyone up has been the key to success. In 2008 Rondo had to learn how to play with The Big Three, and they took home the title that year. In 2010, The Big Three have learned to play around Rondo, and that has made the difference. The most telling stat of the Celtics post season thus far is that not one player has led the team in scoring in back to back games. Its not that the Celtics have too many weapons, they are just a well oiled machine.\n\nThe bench play has been spectacular as well. I am eating my words watching Rasheed Wallace be the defensive stopper I once thought he was. If he continues to hit his 2 threes a game off the bench and goes down in the post every so often like he has, I have zero reason to complain. Glen Davis has been able to draw his 2 charges a game by sacrificing his body under the basket and taking away lanes to the basket. He has played Dwight Howard as well as Perk and Sheed have and that is all the more surprising. His occasional jumper from 15-18 feet seems like a post season fixture for Davis.\n\nThe only unfortunate thing I have seen in these playoffs is that after 5 years in the league, Tony Allen has finally learned his role. He has played lock down defense on the opposing team’s best scorer and has gotten into the flow of the offense. Watching him and Rondo run a fast break is a thing of beauty. Why is this unfortunate? In comparing 2008 to 2010 Tony Allen is James Posey. I hate to see Tony go but he is playing himself into a nice contract for himself next season. But i guess I will take the good with the bad. In the case the good is far greater than the bad.\n\nThe Celtics are 2 wins away from a berth in the NBA Finals hopefully against the Lakers. 6 wins from an NBA title. All because they are the best team in the world up to this point. A team that will refuse to lose. A team that when it is all said and done will have taken down, DWade, King James, Superman, and Kobe.\n\nFiled under: Celtics, NBA | Tagged: Rajon Rondo, Rasheed Wallace, Tony Allen, Ubuntu | Leave a comment »"
