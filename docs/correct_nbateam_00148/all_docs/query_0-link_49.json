        "text": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nBOSTON — Boston Celtics backup guard Tony Allen is expected to be sidelined for eight weeks after undergoing thumb surgery Wednesday.\n\nDoctors repaired ligaments in Allen’s left thumb after he was hurt during practice last week. Allen has spent all five of his NBA seasons with the Celtics.\n\nHe is averaging 7.8 points in 40 games this season and 7.4 for his career. His career high of 11.5 points per game came in 2006-07, but he was limited to 33 games by a knee injury.\n\nThe surgery took place one day after the Celtics sent guard Sam Cassell and cash to the Sacramento Kings for a second-round pick in the 2015 draft. Cassell did not play for Boston this season."
