        "text": "On this day in Boston Celtics history, champion shooting guard Tony Allen played his first game for the team in a 98-95 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers in 2004.\n\nThe former Oklahoma State Cowboy — taken by the Celtics with the 25th pick of that summer’s draft — didn’t have the most spectacular outing in his first appearance in green and white. However, the performance wasn’t indicative of his potential, thankfully. Allen put up 2 points on a single shot attempt and grabbed as many rebounds in his inaugural performance against the 76ers.\n\nHe was on the floor for just inside six minutes, with a single turnover and one personal foul.\n\nIt is also the date former Celtic forward Eric Williams made his debut for Boston in another close one, a 101-100 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nThe one-time Providence College standout logged 16 points, 6 rebounds, and an assist in 20 minutes of floor time.\n\nThese two share their debut date with former Celtic center Al Jefferson, who debuted in the same game as Tony Allen against the Sixers.\n\nIt was an especially rough game for the Mississippi native, who went scoreless in 3 minutes, logging 2 personal fouls.\n\nOn that date in 1995, Charles Claxton debuted for the Celtics at center in a 101-100 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks in 1995 at (then) Fleet Center (now, TD Garden).\n\nClaxton — father of NBAer Nick — ended up going scoreless as well in just 1 minute of floor time.\n\nIn the same game, Celtics center Junior Burrough played his first contest as a Boston Celtics big man.\n\nThe North Carolina native put up 4 points, 2 rebounds, and a block in 14 minutes of play.\n\nIn 1949, big man Hoot Gibson debuted for the Celtics on this date, a 98-83 loss to the (now defunct) Sheboygan Red Skins.\n\nThe Creighton product recorded 5 points and a personal foul in the loss.\n\nThat same game was also the debut tilt for forward Ed Leede, who put up a solid 13 points and 5 personal fouls.\n\nA Dartmouth standout, Leede had been selected by the (defunct) Providence Steamrollers in the 1949 Basketball Association of America (BAA – a precursor league to the NBA) draft.\n\nListen to the “Celtics Lab” podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3GfUPFi\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3F9DvjQ\n\n[mm-video type=video id=01gggcmxn5bk7s5z3rms playlist_id=01eqbzegwgnrje4tv2 player_id=01eqbvq570kgj8vfs7 image=https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/video/thumbnail/mmplus/01gggcmxn5bk7s5z3rms/01gggcmxn5bk7s5z3rms-c7008615fd5c894f63e2076cfe2c9eec.jpg]\n\n[lawrence-related id=111483,111625,111636,111480,111646,111631]\n\n[vertical-gallery id=111649]\n\n[listicle id=111623]\n\n[listicle id=111663]\n\n[listicle id=111616]\n\n[listicle id=111597]"
