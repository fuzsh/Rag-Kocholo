        "text": "Former Grizzlies guard Tony Allen on Tuesday was sentenced to community service and supervision for his role in a $4 million health benefits scam, according to Pete Brush of Law360.\n\nAllen, who pleaded guilty in April to conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud, had faced jail time in connection with the case. He was one of 18 former players who were charged in October 2021.\n\nAllen gave a tearful apology during the sentencing hearing, Brush reported.\n\n“I fully acknowledge my individual responsibility and I understand the gravity of my actions,” he said. \"As a member of the NBA community, I failed to uphold our core values.”\n\nCourt records showed that Allen received $265,000 for chiropractic services and $155,075 for dental services. According to Brush, Allen paid back most of the money he illegally took.\n\nMore: Former Memphis Grizzlies player Tony Allen pleads guilty in health care fraud case\n\nAllen played for the Grizzlies from 2010 to 2017 and was named to the NBA All-Defensive first team three times. He won a championship with the Boston Celtics in 2008.\n\nHe was one of several ex-NBA players who pleaded guilty and did not receive jail time. That group included former Grizzlies guard Tony Wroten.\n\nThe Grizzlies had been scheduled to retire Allen's jersey in January 2022, but the ceremony was postponed. In seven seasons with Memphis, Allen helped orchestrate the \"Grit and Grind era\" as one of the NBA's best defenders. He also has made himself available and offered advice to current Grizzlies players like Ja Morant.\n\nReach sports writer Jonah Dylan at jonah.dylan@commercialappeal.com or on Twitter @thejonahdylan."
