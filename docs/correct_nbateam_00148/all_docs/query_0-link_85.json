        "text": "The Boston Celtics were able to re-sign one free-agent named Allen, but not the other.\n\nTony Allen, who had developed into a reliable defensive player, is leaving the Celtics for the Memphis Grizzlies, according to reports Sunday night.\n\nThe Celtics were hoping to retain him, but after agreeing to terms with Ray Allen last week, they were unable to seal the deal with Tony Allen.\n\nThe Grizzles have reportedly signed Allen to a three-year contract worth nearly $10 million after he earned $2.5 million with the Celtics last season.\n\nThe loss of Allen leaves the Celtics without a key member of their bench as he was asked to guard Dwyane Wade, LeBron James and Kobe Bryant during the run to the NBA Finals.\n\nAllenâ€™s career was disrupted over and over by injuries after he was drafted by the Celtics in the first round in 2004.\n\nThroughout his stay in Boston, Allen rarely showed consistency and was erratic on offense.\n\nThis season, after working his way back into the rotation following an extended say on the bench, Allen became one of the first players Coach Doc Rivers turned to off the bench."
