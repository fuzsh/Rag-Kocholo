        "text": "Allen was waived by the Bulls on Friday.\n\nWith the Bulls unable to put a trade package together for Allen, who they acquired in a deal with New Orleans at the start of February, the team will release him and allow him to land on a team of his choice. While the veteran is near the end of his NBA career, he is still a strong perimeter defender and could be a key player in a playoff team's rotation. However, given his lack of offensive production, no matter where Allen lands, he won't be a viable fantasy asset.\n\nAllen, Jameer Nelson, Omer Asik and a first-round pick will be traded from the Pelicans to the Bulls in exchange for Nikola Mirotic and a second-round pick, Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN reports. Allen is expected to be waived by the Bulls.\n\nAllen has spent the bulk of the season injured with the Pelicans, but was recently cleared for a return to the court and will now be included in a trade that will send him to Chicago. While nothing is official at this point, Allen is expected to be waived by the Bulls and will then have the opportunity to sign with a contender. Mostly prided for his defensive prowess, the 36-year-old veteran likely won't be a fantasy contributor no matter where he lands.\n\nAllen, returning to the active lineup following a lengthy absence due to a fractured leg, did not see the floor in Tuesday's 114-103 loss to the Kings.\n\nAllen hasn't played in a game since Dec.10, and he is averaging only 12.4 minutes through 22 appearances in 2017-18. Dante Cunningham (back), who drew the start in place of DeMarcus Cousins (Achilles), left and did not return. It's conceivable that Allen will be called upon to fill in during Friday's matchup with the Thunder, especially if Cunningham sits. Nevertheless, Pelicans' coach Alvin Gentry has been sticking with short rotations for much of the year, and Allen never solidified his role earlier in the season.\n\nAllen (leg) is active and available to play in Tuesday's game against the Kings.\n\nAllen, who's been out since mid-December following a fractured leg, is finally making his return to the lineup after going through pregame warmups without incident. Considering the lengthy absence, there's a good chance he's on some sort of restrictions and most of his value will likely come on the defensive side of the ball. For that reason, he's likely not worth a look in fantasy and as of now, it's merely a situation to monitor.\n\nAllen (leg) has been upgraded to questionable for Tuesday's game against the Kings.\n\nAllen saw his recovery from a left fibula fracture extended after suffering a setback back at the start of January, but now appears to be on track for a return following a few additional weeks off. Look for him to be reevaluated after the team's morning shootaround Tuesday, with a final word on his availability coming shortly after that session. Even if Allen were to be cleared, the veteran would likely be on some hefty restrictions considering the lengthy absence. Prior to the injury, Allen had averaged 4.9 points and 2.2 rebounds across 12.9 minutes in 21 games.\n\nAllen suffered a setback in his recovery from a left fibula fracture and will be sidelined for another 2-to-4 weeks, Jennifer Hale of Fox Sports New Orleans reports.\n\nAllen suffered the injury exactly a month ago, and he was said to be nearing a return to action before re-aggravating the ailment. The veteran hasn't been a major part of the Pelicans' rotation when healthy this year, but Darius Miller should continue to see a slight uptick in minutes as a result of his continued absence.\n\nAllen has been diagnosed with a non-displaced left proximal fibula fracture and is expected to be sidelined for 3-to-4 weeks, Radio Broadcasting Manager/Studio Host for the New Orleans Pelicans, Daniel Sallerson reports.\n\nAllen left Sunday's game with what was thought to be a knee injury, which subsequently caused him to miss Monday's contest. Upon further examination, it was revealed that Allen had suffered a fractured fibula, which could keep him out upwards of a month. He hasn't been a huge part of the team's rotation, but his 12.4 minutes per game will have to get distributed elsewhere. E'Twaun Moore, Ian Clark and Darius Miller are all candidates to see a slight uptick in workload.\n\nAllen (knee) has been ruled out for Monday's game against the Rockets.\n\nAnthony departed Sunday's game against the Sixers with an unspecified left knee injury, and the ailment will keep him out Monday on the second night of a back-to-back. With Jameer Nelson also out, the Pelicans will be a bit shorthanded in the backcourt off the bench, though Allen hadn't been a major factor in the rotation of late."
