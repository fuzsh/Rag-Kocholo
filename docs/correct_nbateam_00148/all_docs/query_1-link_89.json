        "text": "Tony Allen is a fantastic basketball player, a thrilling and often dominant defender and team leader for the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\n[Follow Dunks Don't Lie on Tumblr: The best slams from all of basketball]\n\nTony Allen is unique.\n\nTony Allen’s high school grades were so bad when he wasn’t playing basketball they stuck him on the football team in order to keep his scholastic interest up while giving him a fake name in order to shield him from the eyes of those who knew he was ineligible to play.\n\nTony Allen’s grades moved back up, and he became amazing at football.\n\nAntonio Brown Tony Allen had to stop playing football because people were starting to take too much notice of this really good football player.\n\nTony Allen is the best.\n\nFrom Michael Wallace’s great feature on Allen over at ESPN:\n\nWallace went on to note that Allen went on to college at Oklahoma State, graduating with a degree in education.\n\nThat anecdote, Allen’s turnaround and the eventual result (he graduated with a degree in education!) are as fantastic as Allen himself. He certainly had his NBA missteps in years’ past, including a Chicago-area shooting incident (for which Allen was found not guilty) that led to rumors that he was held out of a 2009 playoff game against the Chicago Bulls because of fear of reprisal.\n\nHe was a stellar member of that outfit, however, and remains the heart and soul of a Grizzlies team that is currently giving a 67-win Golden State Warriors squad all it can handle. Allen wasn’t being disrespectful when he shrugged off league MVP Stephen Curry after Game 1, and he’s not being boastful or self-promoting when he pulls off stuff like this:\n\nThat’s just Tony, that’s why he endures. That’s just the guy who had to start playing football for the weirdest and most troubling of reasons – his grades slacked off during basketball’s offseason – and had to stop for even stranger reasons, because he became too damn good at it.\n\n(Also, I wonder if you’re at a game and yell “ANTONIO BROWN!” at Allen during a contest what his reaction would be. Would he flinch?)\n\nAllen, the surgically repaired face of Mike Conley, the once-mocked Marc Gasol and obvious team cancer Zach Randolph fell in Game 4 on Monday against a Warriors club desperate for a win. While you might be rooting for this record-setting Warriors squad to advance to what seemed like their obvious championship destiny, you also cannot help but love this Memphis Grizzlies crew. Er’rybody should be smitten with this team.\n\n(Hat-tip to SB Nation.)\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nKelly Dwyer"
