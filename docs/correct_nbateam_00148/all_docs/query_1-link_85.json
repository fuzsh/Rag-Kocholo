        "text": "Former Boston Celtics guard Tony Allen was arrested on charges of domestic assault, domestic vandalism and interference with emergency calls following a domestic dispute with his wife on Sunday night, according to the Memphis Commercial Appeal.\n\nPolice in Collierville, Tennessee were reportedly called to Desiree Allen’s apartment on Sunday evening. Allen allegedly broke open a door and threw his wife’s phone forcefully before being apprehended.\n\nThis was the second time Allen has found himself in legal trouble over the past two months. Back in October, Allen was one of 18 former NBA players arrested (in addition to his wife), in an alleged health insurance fraud scheme. Allen, his wife and several recent NBA retirees submitted fake claims for medical and dental services but those services were never actually performed.\n\nThe groups’ claims totaled nearly $4 million according to federal prosecutors, with Allen being charged with conspiracy to commit health care and wire fraud following the arrest. Allen and his wife pleaded not guilty to the charges and are due back in court in May and could face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty.\n\n“The defendants’ playbook involved fraud and deception,” Audrey Strauss, a U.S. attorney based out of New York, said back in October of the fraud charges. “Thanks to the hard work of our law enforcement partners, their alleged scheme has been disrupted and they will have to answer for their flagrant violations of law.”\n\nAllen began his NBA career in Boston, playing the first six years of his career with the Celtics, serving as a key defensive role player off the bench during the team’s deep playoff runs from 2008-2010 before moving on to the Grizzlies in free agency. The Memphis Grizzlies were set to retire his jersey number this season but Allen announced recently that honor had been postponed amid his ongoing legal troubles."
