        "text": "Tony Allen stood outside the visiting locker room at Staples Center with eyes reddened and nearly unable to speak about a half hour after Game 7 of the NBA Finals last June.\n\n\"I love this group of guys,\" he said as he broke down in tears. \"I love all this group of guys. It's just really an emotional time. It's a tough one to swallow.\n\n\"I definitely want to see this group back.\"\n\nWhile most of the group did come back to Boston this season, Allen did not. He signed a three-year contract with the Grizzlies in a move Celtics coach Doc Rivers admitted last night surprised him.\n\n\"He was the one guy who, at least in my mind, we were assuming (would return),\" Rivers said, \"and then you lose him. That's what happens in free agency. That's why free agency is so dangerous.\"\n\nAllen finally made his return to Boston last night, putting on a uniform other than the Celtics' in the Garden for the first time in his seven-year career. Enigmatic and often moody during a run in Boston that included an ACL tear, persistent injuries and a felony battery charge - of which he was later cleared - that threatened his career early, he was downright giddy about being back as he spoke with reporters before the game.\n\n\"It's definitely strange,\" he said while watching highlights of his old team on the trainer's table. \"I've never been in this place (the visiting locker room) before. I'm a little jittery, a little anxious. Zach Randolph just asked me if I had eaten a bowl of sugar because I kept walking around.\"\n\nAllen, averaging 8.3 points in 19 minutes per game this season, said he had no regrets about his decision to leave Boston this summer, crediting former Celtics general manager and current Grizzlies GM Chris Wallace for recruiting him and showing him \"the blueprint\" they had for him in Memphis.\n\n\"He told me this team was missing toughness, a hard-nose defender - pretty much the same role I had here,\" Allen said. \"He thought this club could use me. He told me we could do something special and I believed him.\"\n\nAllen admitted it was a hard decision to leave. Rivers said he could tell that from his conversations with Allen during free agency.\n\n\"He was really emotional about it, being Tony,\" the coach said. \"It was tough because we have, obviously, a pretty good relationship.\"\n\n\"He was like a dad to me - a basketball dad,\" Allen said of his former coach. \"When I wasn't doing good, he'd tell me and I'd sit. When I was doing good, I'd stay in the game and play. When I wasn't practicing hard, he'd tell me. It was pretty much staying on me at all times.\"\n\nAllen said he finally \"got it\" last season when he worked his way into the playoff rotation after seeing limited minutes earlier in the year.\n\n\"Every game was a quiz to show him I should be playing in the postseason,\" he said. \"I think I focused more. I worked hard in practice every day last year. I stayed disciplined and ready. He noticed that and stuck with me through the long haul. I thank him for everything he did for me.\"\n\n* * *\n\nLeon Powe also made his return to Boston last night. He signed with the Grizzlies earlier this month after negotiating a buyout from Cleveland - where he saw limited playing time due to knee injuries - the day of the trade deadline.\n\n\"We looked at him,\" Rivers said. \"We couldn't take the chance (signing him) with the injuries we already had.\" ...\n\nRivers said Shaquille O'Neal is still \"four or five days away\" from returning from a sore Achilles and foot. Jermaine O'Neal is also nearing a return after arthroscopic knee surgery in January.\n\n\"Obviously, the clock is ticking,\" Rivers said. \"There is nothing we can do about this. We would love to have (Shaquille O'Neal) now. We would love to have (Jermaine O'Neal) now. It puts you in a little bit of a bind.\" ...\n\nVon Wafer (strained right calf) ran and shot on the parquet before the game, but Rivers said he was unaware if Wafer would be seeing game action anytime soon.\n\n(Scott Souza can be reached at 781-398-8006 or ssouza@wickedlocal.com.)"
