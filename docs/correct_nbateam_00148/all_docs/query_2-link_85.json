        "text": "Former Memphis Grizzlies guard Tony Allen was arrested in Collierville Sunday night and faces charges of domestic assault, domestic vandalism and interference with emergency calls following an incident involving his wife, Desiree Allen.\n\nCollierville Police were called to Desiree Allen's apartment at around 10:21 p.m. regarding a domestic assault, according to the police report. Officers on the scene said Allen told them she moved \"approximately two weeks previously\" because she said her husband had \"changed\" and become \"dark\" without further elaborating.\n\nThat evening, Desiree Allen said Tony Allen called and accused her of keeping him from their two children. He came to the apartment and banged on the door asking to be let in. When he wasn't let in, he returned and \"broke open the door damaging the inside of the door frame.\"\n\nAllen then confronted his wife in the master bedroom, which led Desiree Allen to say she'd call the police. According to the report, she said Tony Allen then forcefully took the phone from her and threw it in the master bathroom toilet. In the struggle, Desiree Allen's left knee rubbed against the bed frame and caused \"a rug burn.\"\n\nAfter officers investigated the scene, Tony Allen was taken into custody.\n\nThis is the second time in less than two months Allen has been charged with a crime. In October, both Allen and his wife were among 19 people, including 18 former NBA players, charged in federal court with one count of conspiracy to commit health care and wire fraud involving the league's Health and Welfare Benefit Plan.\n\nPrevious arrest: Tony Allen arrested, pleads not guilty in NBA health care fraud scheme\n\nFraud scheme: Tony Allen, Chris Douglas-Roberts among former NBA players charged in fraud scheme\n\nTony and Desiree Allen each pleaded not guilty and were released on their own recognizance after Tony Allen paid a $500,000 bond and Desiree Allen paid $250,000. Both are scheduled to return to federal court in New York on May 5 for their next status conference.\n\nThe Grizzlies planned to retire Allen's jersey in January but in a message through Grind City Media last week, Allen asked the team to postpone his ceremony until the 2022-23 NBA season. Earlier Wednesday, Allen was named in a team release as one of several guests who will be present for Zach Randolph's jersey retirement ceremony on Dec. 11.\n\nStaff writer Dima Amro contributed to this report\n\nWant to stay informed on the latest Memphis sports news?
