        "text": "Tony Allen on his future: 'I wouldn't mind coaching'\n\nIt’s easy to tell, just by being around you, that the fire for the game still burns. Have you considered getting into coaching? Does something like that have any interest in the future for Tony Allen? Tony Allen: Well with the way they’re letting defense come back in the game now, I wouldn’t mind coaching. Coaching is an opportunity for me to pull out some of these slick techniques I used to use when I was playing and if I ever got the opportunity, I definitely wouldn’t shy away from it. I definitely would embrace it like I do anything else — give it 110 percent. Giving my knowledge to the game, would be me giving back, honestly. Because they took the art of defense out of the game for these past six, seven years. And to see how they’re calling the game now, letting you be a little more physical, if coaches need that deep, physical presence, I wouldn’t mind sharing. I wouldn’t shy away from the opportunity. Trust.\n\nTony Allen on Ja Morant: 'I want him to take his time with his injury'\n\nAnd what advice do you have for him as far as keeping basketball a focus? Tony Allen: I want him to take his time with his injury. Give himself the proper healing time, get his strength and conditioning up to be ready for the next season. Getting back to being himself, having fun on the court. He knows he’s electrifying. Just be Ja, the Ja that we’ve known up until this point on the court. Everything else will take care of itself. I’m a huge fan of Ja Morant. I look at him like a little brother. Real cool with his dad, his mom is a very sweet lady. It was a minor setback, it’s behind him. Basketball is the first priority and I’m sure he’ll cherish that moving forward.\n\nWhen you hear about your jersey getting retired in Memphis given everything you’ve given the city and Grizzlies in your career, how does that resonate with you? Tony Allen: Oh man, It’s a dream come true, honestly. This is every hooper’s dream and I’m very thankful. Big shout out to the Grizzlies for always holding it down for me. Embracing me. Acknowledging the fact that I struck a match to the organization with my phrase ‘Grit-n-Grind’ and that lives forever. Now we’re going to raise the jersey of No. 9. I’m a Grizzly forever.\n\nGrizzlies to retire Tony Allen's jersey next season\n\nAnother member of the Memphis Grizzlies “core four” is expected to receive an upcoming jersey retirement ceremony. The Grizzlies are planning to retire Tony Allen’s jersey during the 2024-25 season, the former All-NBA defender told The Commercial Appeal. Allen would be the third Grizzlies player with a jersey in the rafters, joining Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph. “Yeah, they told me next year I’m going to get my jersey retired,” Allen said.\n\nThe Grizzlies are also expected to begin filming a documentary soon that will go back to Allen’s roots of growing up in Chicago. That documentary is expected to be released around the time of Allen’s ceremony. A date has not been set yet for the 2024-25 season. “I’m looking forward to it,” Allen said. “Hopefully, I have a box of tissue with me.”"
