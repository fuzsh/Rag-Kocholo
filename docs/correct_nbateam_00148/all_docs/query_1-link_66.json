        "text": "Former Boston Celtics shooting guard Tony Allen, part of the Celtics’ 2008 title team, has been sentenced in connection with the NBA’s $5 million benefits scam, per new reporting from Law 360 reporter Pete Brush. Allen was charged with illegally taking close to $420,000 from the scam but paid back most of the money before being sentenced. Instead of prison time, Allen received a sentence of community service and supervision.\n\nDuring his court appearance, Allen gave a tearful apology, acknowledging his responsibility and expressing regret for not upholding the NBA’s core values. “I fully acknowledge my individual responsibility and I understand the gravity of my actions,” Allen reportedly told the court.\n\nThe judge presiding over the case expressed concern about overbilling but noted that Allen had repaid the money he took."
