        "text": "I’m thrilled to announce my new album ‘Live in London’ - recorded from my show on my 79th birthday at London’s Union Chapel. Watch the live performance of my first single “No Time For Cryin’” and pre-order the record, out 2/08/19, all at https://ffm.to/mavisstaples_live\n\nThe Richmond Folk Festival seeks to create an environment that is representative of varying cultures and traditions. Staples performance certainly helped add to the mission. Her performance garnered “what appeared to be the largest audience for a single performance.”\n\nThe “legendary Mavis Staples,” as quoted by Ellen, was joined by Hozier to perform ‘Nina Cried Power’ in a special tv exclusive. The two took the stage with the same fire that is present all throughout the lyrics of this song dedicated to activism.\n\nMavis Staples has been named the Female Blues Artist of the Year by Living Blues magazine as a part of their 25th annual Living Blues Awards.\n\nMavis Staples stopped by the Newport Folk Festival this past weekend, surprising audiences in spectacular fashion and joining many of the artists throughout the weekend including, the closing sets on both Saturday and Sunday\n\nNarrated by Mavis Staples, \"The Story of Ben Harper & Charlie Musselwhite\" is an animated short that dissects how these two Grammy-winning musicians have come together to share their histories with listeners on their new album 'No Mercy in This Land'.\n\nMavis Staples delivered a powerful performance on the Which Stage, offering a powerful civil rights lesson to a crowd full of young people in the throws of their own political movement.\n\nContinuing with a long standing tradition of honoring individuals who have made \"significant or meritorious contributions\" to society, Delta State University conferred an honorary doctorate to Mavis Staples at it's spring commencement on May 5th, 2018.\n\nIf All I Was Was Black, consists of 10 songs written by Jeff Tweedy with three co-written with Mavis Staples, including the title track we're premiering here. (Jeff wrote the music while Mavis contributed to the lyrics).\n\nGorillaz just keeps trickling out the jams from its very stacked album Humanz, due April 28 via Warner Bros. Pusha T and Mavis Staples feature on the psychedelic, yet sharp-edged \"Let Me Out.\" So far, this is the most satisfying of all the guest-heavy collaborations released, the spirit of the downer-pop hit \"Clint Eastwood\" swirled into fervent soul.\n\nThe months leading up to the 2016 presidential election were filled with one-off protest songs, most of them directed at eventual winner Donald J. Trump. The months since, as you might imagine, have been no quieter. The occasion of Trump's inauguration Friday is inspiring weekend demonstrations and benefit concerts across the country, and more protest songs keep rolling out right alongside them."
