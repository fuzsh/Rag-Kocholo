        "text": "Margo Price has teamed ujp with Mavis Staples and Adia Victora for the new collaboration âFight to Make It.â Sales of the song on Bandcamp will benefit ‘Noise for Now‘ and its mission of supporting grassroots organizations working for reproductive justice.Â Victoria released her own single âIn the Pinesâ to support the Carolina Abortion Fund in May, and Staplesâ musical collaboration with the late Levon Helm was documented in the live album Carry Me Home.Â\n\nPrice said in a statement about “Fight To Make It”:Â âEvery day I see more of our rights stripped away in America. The right to reproductive health in this country has become a luxury for the wealthy. The United States has a higher maternal death rate than any other developed country. Black women in particular experience maternal mortality at a rate two to three times higher than white women. When we stand together and sing together we are stronger.â\n\nYou can catch Price out on the road, with multiple festival stops scheduled through the end of the year. For a full list of upcoming concert dates and ticketing information, head to Price’s official website.\n\nEditorial credit: Kathy Hutchins / Shutterstock.com"
