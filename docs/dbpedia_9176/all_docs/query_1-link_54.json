        "text": "In 2014, a slew of special guests honored Mavis Staples and her legendary career at a hometown Chicago concert. Footage from that evening will air on AXS TV on April 16. It’s then coming out as a special CD/DVD set on June 2 (via Blackbird Presents Records). Among the many artists involved in the concert were Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, Bonnie Raitt, Gregg Allman, and Arcade Fire’s Win Butler and Régine Chassagne. Below, watch Butler and Chassagne perform with Mavis Staples. They sang Talking Heads’ “Slippery People” from the 1983 record Speaking in Tongues.\n\nStaples previously teamed up with Arcade Fire on the track “I Give You Power,” which benefitted the American Civil Liberties Union. She also recently appeared on Gorillaz’s new Humanz track “Let Me Out” (also featuring Pusha T). Check out her Chicago performance of the Band’s “The Weight” (with Tweedy, Michael McDonald, Arcade Fire, and many others) here.\n\nListen to Talking Heads’ “Slippery People”:"
