        "text": "There is so much to say about Mavis Staples. With her five feet, she's a little piece of woman with an impressive wingspan and a golden voice. It's an extraordinary trajectory, a lifelong commitment to civil rights and a musical career that has spanned more than 60 years alongside some of the world's greatest artists without ever running out of steam.\n\nWith a deep, husky, and full of life voice, Mavis Staples awakens buried emotions and energizes like no one else. And when she sings her soul or gospel music, all in vibes, it seems as if God himself stops for a moment to listen to her. The one who started with her father and sisters has come a long way. By emancipating herself from her family, she has collaborated with the greatest producers and artists of this world. Prince, Curtis Mayfield, Ry Cooder and even Bob Dylan, whose marriage proposal she had the luxury of refusing, not impressed by the singer's fame.\n\nBecause yes, since her beginnings and even more so as she gets older, the singer knows what she wants. In the pure soul tradition, singing Love and hope, again and again, is her mission. It must be said that she learned from the best: Martin Luther King was her friend and made her grow up on the road to defending civil rights in the United States. It was the fight of a lifetime for the singer who opened the Doctor's meetings with her repertoire of freedom songs, to give support to the black population, then struggling against racial segregation.\n\nAnd while the latter fortunately fell, the battle did not stop for the tireless activist. After her immense success in the 60s and 70s, she found a second wind in the 2000s, recently delivering one of her best albums, full of protest songs about the fate of African-Americans in Trump's America."
