        "text": "Have you heard the track \"Someday\" that Mavis Staples does with Los Lobos on their latest album \"The Ride\". WOW, what a performance! Her voice penetrates every cubic inch of your mind and body! She also leaves me speechless on The Band's Last Waltz bonus track version of The Weight (along with Pops Staples). Likewise on Buckwheat Zydeco's version of This Train. Pops does a great version of Fleetwood Mac's World Turning (I forget what album it comes from)\n\nWho else has a favorite Staples family track?\n\nThis thread is sinking fast, so i'll add my two cents.\n\nMy favorite period is the early 70s, from when they recorded on Stax, up to the song \"Let's Do It Again\" on Curtom Records. I haven't really heard too much else besides the stuff Mavis did with Prince.\n\nFavortie tracks are:\n\nWe The People\n\nRespect Yourself\n\nI'll Take You There\n\nCome Go With Me (If You're Ready)\n\nI had the album where they are sitting on an airplane wing engine, and recently rebought it as a cd, plus The Greatest Hits cd.\n\nHaven't had a chance to listen yet, but this reminds me to take them down from the shelf.\n\nI had one of Pops cds from the 90's.\n\nCould I add them to \"needs a box set\"?\n\nI've been listening to the recent 3CD release, Music from the Wattstax Festival and Film. It includes five great live, Staples tracks. The Wattstax DVD is coming out in September. It includes a few Staples clips. More info at: http://www.wattstax.com\n\nJonathan\n\nPops had at least a couple solo releases that are quite good, though not up to classic Staple level. Some of the early gospel stuff is also very good, but Grant's right on the real core of their best--running from early Stax to Do It Again.\n\nMavis's cut and Bobby Womack's are the highlights for me on the Los Lobos release.\n\n(Seeing them in Ashville, mid-July.)\n\ndoug\n\nthanks for the link\n\nHow long has Mavis been singing? I just read a review of a Staples gospel album in a 1965 Playboy...no mention of her but that doesn't mean she wasn't there.\n\nAlways loved the way Scorcese shot \"The Weight\" with Band and Staples on LAST WALTZ. Chills, mon.\n\nLet me breathe a little more life into this thread. There is a various artists album called \"Fish-Tree-Water-Blues\" on which Mavis Staples does a blistering version of \"I'll Fly Away\" (here it's called \" I'll Fly Away From Here\" ). It is just Mavis and someone playing a Hammond B-3 (I think) organ.\n\nI have only heard Respect Yourself and I'll Take You There. I'm curious to check out some of their albums. Where should I start?\n\nI'd like to know also. I am more familiar with the guest appearances and one or two of the hits."
