        "text": "Hamilton is a historical hiphop musical that tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, an orphaned immigrant who became the United States' first Treasury Secretary.\n\nMavis says: \"You have to see it! My heart was pounding when I left the theatre. It is so great. The music, the thunder, the message - oh my, people were crying, people were sniffing. There’s some sad moments, but there are some joyous moments too. And the music is awesome!\"\n\nThe original Broadway production, which starred its creator Lin-Manuel Miranda (above, centre) in the title role, has been an incredible success, winning 11 Tony awards and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The show has just begun its UK run in London's Victoria Palace Theatre.\n\nImage credit: Joan Marcus\n\nChance the Rapper is a Grammy Award-winning rapper and producer from Chicago, Illinois, best known for his albums Acid Rap (2013) and Colouring Book (2016).\n\nMavis says: \"I love Chance; you know his music is more gospel, his music is very churchy. I tried to get him on my latest album!\n\n\"He’s so positive; you know, we have a Governor now that does nothing for the school children in Chicago and this kid Chance puts his money where his mouth is. He had a meeting with the Governor, and he came out of the meeting shaking his head like ‘no, it just didn’t happen,’ then the next couple of days he comes donating a million dollars to the school, so the kids can go to school and have lunch.\"\n\nChance the Rapper makes his music available for free on Soundcloud.

Until I saw the movie, ‘til anybody saw it, none of us knew that there was a black woman who was so smart that she was helping the astronauts. And that character, played by Taraji P. Henson, is really worth seeing. She's great.\"\n\nHer favourite part? \"Everyone at NASA is waiting for John Glenn, the astronaut, to go up in the spacecraft, you know? He came in and told them he wasn't going - 'I am not going until I see that she is here, and she says so,' and that was the black girl. It's gonna blow your mind.\"\n\nHidden Figures is available on DVD and Blu-Ray. Image © 2016 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation. All rights reserved."
