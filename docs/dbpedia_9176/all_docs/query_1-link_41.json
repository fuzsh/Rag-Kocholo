She marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., performed at John F. Kennedy’s inauguration, and sang in Barack Obama’s White House. Over the past few decades alone, she’s collaborated with everyone from Prince and Bob Dylan to Arcade Fire and Bon Iver, blown away countless festivalgoers from Newport Folk and Glastonbury to Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo and graced the airwaves on Fallon, Colbert, Ellen, Austin City Limits, Jools Holland, and the Grammys.\n\nDon’t miss Mavis Staples 85th: All-Star Birthday Concert will take place on Thursday, April 18, 2024, at the YouTube Theater, featuring once-in-a-lifetime performances with Mavis Staples and an incredible lineup of superstar artists, including Black Pumas, Chris Stapleton, Grace Potter, Hozier, Jackson Browne, Jeff Tweedy, Keb’ Mo’, Michael McDonald, Nathaniel Rateliff, Norah Jones, Robert Randolph, Taj Mahal, The War And Treaty, plus more to be announced."
