        "text": "But the family group – patriarch Roebuck “Pops” Staples, lead singer Mavis and siblings Pervis, Cleotha and Yvonne - had been, by then, a major force in American music, culture and politics for more than a decade. Their downhome Mississippi-rooted gospel helped put the cross in “crossover,” taking the group from success in the sacred field to headlining status at the Newport Folk Festival and a frontline position in the battle for civil rights alongside the Rev. Martin Luther King. Their rural roots even caught the ear of Roebuck’s fellow Mississippian, the self-styled King of Hillbilly Rock, Marty Stuart, who performed and recorded with the Staples and who, along with GRAMMY-winning producer/guitarists T-Bone Burnett and Buddy Miller, helps keep the Pops Staples guitar sound alive today as one of the keystones of Americana.\n\nRoebuck Staples was born Dec. 28, 1914 in Sunflower County, Miss., raised one of 14 children on Will Dockery’s plantation. His most vivid childhood musical memory was Delta blues great Charley Patton performing at Dockery’s general store.\n\n“He used to sit out there on the grocery store and play and entertain all of the people on a Saturday. Everybody’d go up to the big store when he’d play,” Staples told me a few years before he died. He picked up what he could from Patton and from a neighbor closer to his own age, Chester Burnett, the future Howlin' Wolf. Learning from them as well as the Staples family phonograph, stocked with 78s by Blind Lemon Jefferson and other early country bluesmen, Roebuck soon became an accomplished guitarist.\n\nBut the rambling bluesman’s life was not for him. He married at 18, giving up blues for gospel music. He and his wife Osceola soon had a daughter, Cleotha, and the young family decided they wanted a better life than plantation sharecropping. In 1935, they followed the well-worn path to Chicago, where Roebuck worked in the stockyards.\n\nOn weekends, he performed with local gospel groups like the Trumpet Jubilees. But he and Osceola were busy raising their own group, and Cleotha soon had a younger brother, Pervis, and three little sisters, Yvonne, Mavis and Cynthia. “At night, after we finished our homework, rather than turn the radio on, Pop picked up the guitar and we’d all sit on the floor in a circle and he’d give us our (harmony) parts,” Mavis said in a Commercial Appeal interview.\n\nThat feeling was mutual, and universal. The Staple Singers sounded like no other group, led by Mavis’ husky, sensual lead voice, contrasting with Pops’ lighter, reedy vocals, buoyed by the rich vocal harmonies of the other siblings.\n\nThey left Vee Jay in 1960, recording for the jazz/folk label Riverside, followed by a lengthy stint with major label Epic Records, a Columbia subsidiary.\n\nTheir music remained profoundly spiritual, but they were singing for social justice, working with Rev. King, who would often request Pops’ song, “Why (Am I Treated So Bad?).” The Staples anthem to the movement, “Freedom Highway,” was revived in the 21st century by The North Mississippi All Stars.\n\nBut it was when the Staples returned to Memphis that the group found its ideal combination of gospel, soul and social conscience. They signed to Stax Records in 1967, and over the next eight years, the label took full advantage of their many talents. Pops’ unique sound earned an invitation to play sessions with Aretha Franklin, which he turned down because it wasn’t gospel (that’s Joe South playing Staples-style guitar on “Chain of Fools”). But Pops did record Jammed Together, a guitar summit with Albert King and Steve Cropper. Mavis had a secular deal with Stax, making excellent, if commercially unsuccessful, solo records, including her Cropper-produced debut."
