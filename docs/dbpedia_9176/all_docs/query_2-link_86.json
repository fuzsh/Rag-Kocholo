        "text": "About Mavis Staples:\n\nMAVIS STAPLES RECALLS CROSSING INTO ARKANSAS AROUND 1:00 AM IN NOVEMBER 1964 WHEN WEST MEMPHIS POLICE PULLED OVER HER FAMILY'S CADILLAC, ORDERING THEM OUT OF THE CAR WITH SHOTGUNS AND DOGS. BEFORE THINGS HAD GONE BADLY WRONG, SHE HAD BEEN DRIVING FOR SOME TWO HUNDRED MILES WHEN THEY STOPPED FOR GAS, WITH POPS AND SISTER CLEOTHA ALONG FOR THE RIDE, AND HER BROTHER PERVIS ASLEEP UNDER THE FAMILY'S COATS IN THE BACK SEAT.\n\nAt the station, she asked the attendant to clean the windshield and recalls him doing it but responding with a slur when she asked for a receipt for the gas. He said if she wanted a receipt, she would have to come back to the office for it. Pops headed to the office in her place, only to be insulted with the same slur. Grabbing the slip from the attendant's hand, Pops clocked the man, who fled into his office. As he returned, Mavis saw a crowbar in his hand.\n\nMeanwhile, Cleotha woke up Pervis in the backseat. The family managed to free Pops and escape in the car but realized they were in serious trouble. Pops told Mavis to head for the state line, but police caught up as they crossed from Tennessee to Arkansas. In the trunk, officers found a gun and a cigar box holding more than $1000 cash in receipts from the family's latest performance.\n\nThe attendant had called in a story about them beating and robbing him, and everything in the trunk looked like evidence. Pops was put in one squad car, Cleotha in another, and Mavis was handcuffed to her brother in a third. At that time, Mavis says, \"black people could just be killed.\" She remembers that as they were driven off into the night, \"I thought they were going to lynch us.\"\n\nThis history is still with us. At the beginning of her eighth decade of singing truth, Mavis Staples has delivered If All I Was Was Black (ANTI- Records), ten songs about America today, where the present is filled with ghosts of the past. \"Nothing has changed,\" Mavis said in early August, just days before the world watched neo-Nazis march with swastika flags in Charlottesville, Virginia, as a young woman was murdered. \"We are still in it.\"\n\nIf All I Was Was Black represents Mavis' third collaboration with songwriter and producer (and Wilco frontman) Jeff Tweedy. Their first partnership in 2010, You Are Not Alone, won a Grammy Award for Best Americana album. Their second effort together, One True Vine, was a Grammy nominee. But If All I Was Was Black marks the first time Tweedy has composed an entire album of original songs for Mavis' legendary voice and a nation she's uniquely poised to address.\n\nIn the wake of the race-baiting and rhetoric of exclusion appearing not just on the streets in 2017 but issuing from statehouses and even the White House, Mavis and Tweedy found themselves in sync and wanting to say something about the fissures dividing the country. \"We're not loving one another the way we should,\" Mavis confided, as if sharing the secret to happiness, or something better. \"Some people are saying they want to make the world great again, but we never lost our greatness. We just strayed into division.\"\n\nExplaining why he decided to tackle the state of the union, Tweedy said, \"I've always thought of art as a political statement in and of itself—that it was enough to be on the side of creation and not destruction. But there is something that feels complicit at this moment in time about not facing what is happening in this country head on.\"\n\nEmerging from this pairing is an interracial, multi-generational collaboration. If we've fallen short of our brightest promises, this record stands to remind us what we're still capable of. The partnership itself is part of the point.\n\nThe album opens with another position statement (\"This life surrounds you, guns are loaded\") and runs immediately down a \"long, narrow road\" where any misstep can be deadly. Mavis leads listeners through call-and-response vocals in a soundscape that recalls Sly and the Family Stone's mix of joy and social criticism unfolding over a funk-edged rhythm section.\n\nAfter years of working with Mavis, Tweedy tried to imagine the words that she would want to sing, and also wrote music with the sound of her band in mind. The first track, \"Little Bit\" swells into a cautionary anthem of all the ways in which those regarded as suspicious have to weigh their actions just to survive day to day: \"A little bit too high, a little bit too low, a little bit out of line, and my baby won't make it home.\" The joyous groove of the title track then tackles the same issue by directly addressing those who respond to someone's race without seeing their shared humanity. \"If all I was was black, don't you want to know me more than that?\"\n\nCurrent events appear on the record, but only obliquely. \"We Go High\" borrows its chorus from Michelle Obama's speech on the first night of the 2016 Democratic National Convention. \"Build a Bridge\" parses exactly which lives matter and how we can begin to talk about it. But across 35 minutes of music, there is not a single proper name to bind any song to a specific place or individual.\n\nAsked why he didn't come up with narrative songs tackling specific recent moments of violence or injustice, Tweedy explained that when he first wrote \"Little Bit,\" it had included a roll call of the dead. And there is no shortage of names from which he could have chosen: 12-year-old Tamir Rice shot on a playground. Eric Garner, who suffocated in a police chokehold on the ground. Sandra Bland, who died three days into custody after a routine traffic stop. Walter Scott, shot in the back running away from an officer in South Carolina.\n\nMavis' hometown of Chicago agonized over the death of Laquan McDonald, as a video emerged establishing that contrary to official reports, he had been shot sixteen times while walking away then lying on the ground. Yet one misgiving Tweedy felt about putting the names of the dead in songs for Mavis was that so many have died under unbearable circumstances, it would be impossible to include everyone. He worried he would be doing an injustice to the memory of those left out.\n\nInstead, the songs take a universal approach. \"We didn't make the songs point to a specific person,\" Mavis explained. \"If you follow the lyrics it's about yesterday and today.\"\n\nThe lyrics are still occasionally shot through with anger. \"I have a mind to bury them whole, when they go low,\" Mavis sings on \"We Go High.\" \"There's evil in the world, and there's evil in me\" opens the first verse of \"Try Harder.\" \"Oh, they lie, and they show no shame\" adds a harsh undercurrent to \"Who Told You That,\" an anthem against accepting the status quo. Unsettling musical elements wind their way through the record, too, from the abrasive guitar distortion of \"Try Harder\" to a descending bassline that signals danger on \"Little Bit.\"\n\nDespite all this, the mood ring on Mavis' 2017 outing is set to love, which runs through and over both fury and despair. The songs move less like a hammer and more like the tide, with Mavis countering the anger with an eye toward the work that is required to bring change. She is singing the world as it is, but also a way forward.\n\nIn the end, Mavis is sure that the answer is to lift each other up. She's not embracing the anxious hesitation of respectability politics but the possibilities of love. \"It's the compassion that I feel,\" she said. \"I want you to feel that same compassion.\"\n\nTalking about writing for Mavis, Tweedy said, \"The love I have for Mavis and the desire to be part of some kind of positive change are a big part of this album for me.\"\n\nIf All I Was Was Black contains elements of many styles that Mavis has performed in her lifetime, tying them together with the closing number declaring that she would \"Do It All Over Again.\" Handclaps on \"Peaceful Dream\" recall the Staple Singers' legendary use of the same percussive technique. \"Ain't No Doubt About It,\" a duet between Mavis and Tweedy, underlines the fluidity between the gospel, soul, rock, and country genres of the Americana roots music in which both artists have innovated and built careers.\n\nMavis sang with family for her first paying gig at Holy Trinity Baptist Church in 1948, moving over time from the gospel circuit to radio and eventually even to stadium shows, collecting a number one hit along the way and adding almost every musical form to her repertoire. She has performed with Bob Dylan, Booker T., Ray Charles, and The Band, among many others, and has had music written for her by everyone from Prince and Nick Cave to Neko Case.\n\nAt the age of fourteen, Mavis made a trip into the studio with the Staple Singers in September 1953 to record for United Records. Two years later, a boy who had himself just turned fourteen was found dead in the Tallahatchie River near Money, Mississippi. Emmett Till, like Mavis, was from Chicago, and they brought his body home to bury him. \"I grew up with all this,\" Mavis says.\n\nFor the funeral, Emmett's mother kept the casket open, so that everyone could see the brutality of the men who murdered her son and the system that would let them get away with it. Mavis met Till's mother after his death, and notes that more than fifty years passed before the woman whose honor had been the justification for murder admitted to a historian that she fabricated her testimony about Till making advances toward her.\n\nNearly a decade after Till's funeral, the Civil Rights era hit full stride, and the Staple Singers threw in with Martin Luther King, Jr.'s vision of America, even though some churchgoers felt that God's holiest work might be done in some less political realm. Mavis and her family had built a vast audience around the country, one they visited by driving show to show in their car—the same Cadillac that was stopped leaving Memphis late in 1964.\n\nArriving in handcuffs at the West Memphis police station that night, they were recognized by the police chief and the custodian. Producing the receipt showing they had paid for gas, they instantly obliterated the station attendant's false accusation of robbery. The chief and his men released the Staples family, and even made a point of coming to one of their shows soon after.\n\nWithout their celebrity, however—and without that receipt—what would have happened? If All I Was Was Black doesn't turn away from that part of America, the part in which black Americans can be shot by the side of the road. But it embraces the idea that the country can redeem itself, that we can, one by one, each rise above our worst selves.\n\nAnd Mavis thinks she has an idea how to do it. \"Bring us all together as a people—that's what I hope to do. You can't stop me. You can't break me. I'm too loving,\" she says. \"These songs are going to change the world.\"\n\nAbout Blind Boys Of Alabama:\n\nHailed as \"gospel titans\" by Rolling Stone, the Blind Boys first rose to fame in the segregated south with their thrilling vocal harmonies and roof-raising live show. They released their debut single, \"I Can See Everybody's Mother But Mine,\" on the iconic Veejay label in 1948, launching a 70-year recording career that would see them rack up five GRAMMY Awards (plus one for Lifetime Achievement), enter the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, collaborate with everyone from Mavis Staples and Stevie Wonder to Prince and Lou Reed, and perform on the world's most prestigious stages. It would be difficult to overstate the Blind Boys' influence on their contemporaries and the generations that came after. The New York Times said that they \"came to epitomize what is known as jubilee singing, a livelier breed of gospel music,\" adding that \"they made it zestier still by adding jazz and blues idioms and turning up the volume, creating a sound...like the rock 'n' roll that grew out of it.\" TIME Magazine raved that \"they're always hunting for -- and finding -- the perfect note or harmony that lifts an old tune into the sublime,\" while The Washington Post praised their \"soul-stirring harmonies\" and \"range of cross-genre collaborations,\" and The New Yorker simply called them \"legendary.\"\n\n\"When the Blind Boys started out, we weren't even thinking about all these accolades and all that stuff,\" founding member Jimmy Carter told NPR. \"We just wanted to get out and sing gospel and tell the world about gospel music.\" Mission accomplished!\n\nThe goal of the Sprint Pavilion is to provide a safe, enjoyable environment for all of our patrons, our performers, and our staff. With that in mind, beginning in 2018, we will enact new security procedures to make sure that prohibited or dangerous items are not brought into the venue. For all events, including Fridays After Five, patron points of entry will be limited and there will be a bag check for any packages brought inside the gates. We encourage our patrons to travel light but, if you do have bags or packages with you, plan for the entry to take a few moments as our staff inspects the bags. We appreciate your patience so that we can all feel safe. Unfortunately, we do not offer any bag check so please familiarize yourself with our list of prohibited items and leave them at home.\n\nFor all ticketed events, we will be instituting a higher level of security. All patrons will be asked to walk through our metal detectors after emptying their pockets of any metal objects. Patrons may opt for a pat down inspection should they choose. We will have plenty of lines open and we hope that this procedure will flow smoothly and not delay your entrance to the venue. Should you bring bags with you to ticketed events, we will still need to inspect the parcel prior to you passing thru the metal detectors. Once again, we appreciate your patience as we work to ensure the safety of all of our patrons."
