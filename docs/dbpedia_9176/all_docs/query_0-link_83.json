        "text": "Two days before festival tickets go on sale, Moon River Music Festival organizers have announced The Avett Brothers, Trampled By Turtles, Mavis Staples, and The Head and the Heart will perform at the Sept. 8-9 festival in Chattanooga.\n\nFor the first year, the festival, founded in 2014 in Memphis, will be an easy drive from Knoxville: After partnering with Knoxville's AC Entertainment, festival founders Drew Holcomb and Paul Steele decided to move it to Chattanooga's riverfront Coolidge Park.\n\nMore: Big Ears Festival 2018: What to know before you go\n\nMore: Dolly Parton breaks down what’s new for Dollywood’s 2018 season at park’s opening day\n\nIn all, 22 bands will play on two stages at opposite ends of the park. Along with Knoxville favorites the Dirty Guv'nahs, scheduled are Judah and the Lion, Margo Price, I'm With Her, Joseph, Mandolin Orange, Penny and Sparrow, Durand Jones and the Indications, the Secret Sisters, the War and Treaty, Darlingside, the Ballroom Thieves, Caamp, Liz Vice, Boy Named Banjo, Wilder, Family and Friends, and Drew Holcomb and the Neighbors.\n\nFestival passes go on sale at 10 a.m. Thursday at moonriverfestival.com. General admission passes range from $99.50 to $139.50; as the limited quantity of less expensive tickets sell, only the more expensive ones will be available. VIP passes are $374.50 and include priority entrance lane into the festival grounds; premium main stage viewing area; access to the VIP lounge, restroom and bar; a commemorative gift package; and admission to a VIP event Friday evening.\n\nHolcomb said the decision to move came after the festival, intended to showcase his Memphis hometown, outgrew the historic Levitt Shell.\n\n\"In our dreaming and searching for a new home, we realized we could showcase other parts of my home state, Tennessee, and we have found the perfect place,\" said Holcomb, who said he's lived all over the state. \"Chattanooga is primed for a music festival like Moon River, and the city has opened its arms to us. It is the gateway to the Appalachian Mountains and one of the most beautiful cities in the region. Coolidge Park is right in the center of town, connected to one of the world’s largest pedestrian bridges, Walnut Street Bridge, overlooking the Tennessee River.\""
