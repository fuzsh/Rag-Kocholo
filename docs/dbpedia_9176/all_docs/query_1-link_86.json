Fitting that Mavis’ record should come out the same day that one of the most momentous elections in U.S. history will be decided, as her dedication to social justice and freedom spans over 40 years of modern history; first as lead singer of the Staples Singers, where her voice became the living soundtrack to the Civil Rights Movement, continuing through to 2007 when she won a Free Speech award created to honor artists that have incited discussion and worked against the status quo through their music and their actions.\n\nWith the election season kicking into high gear with the Democratic National Convention in Denver, CO and the Republican National Convention in Minneapolis, MN, Mavis is releasing the first track off “Hope At The Hideout”. Entitled “We Shall Not Be Moved,” the song is a soulful rendition of a classic freedom song. While the song, which includes lines like “we’re fighting for our children / we shall not be moved,” could be the theme song for either of the current political campaigns, Mavis puts it squarely into context during an instrumental break-down in the middle of the song. In the South in the 1960s, Mavis drawls, just trying to have a meal in a restaurant was in itself an act of civil disobedience, and when she and her fellow marchers would be forcibly ejected by the police, they sang “We Shall Not Be Moved.” By the end of the song, we get a real sense of where this amazing figure has been, and how much we have to learn from her. “We Shall Not Be Moved” is available at www.anti.com\n\nMavis has deep roots in this election. She and Barack Obama attended the same church in Chicago. Obama, the man Mavis has called “in a way, so much like Dr. King” — and she would know, for Mavis and her family worked side by side with Dr. King fighting for civil rights — will deliver his highly-anticipated speech to the DNC on Thursday, the 45th anniversary of Dr. King’s famous “I Have A Dream” speech. Congressman John Lewis, who figured prominently in Monday night’s moving tribute to Senator Ted Kennedy, wrote the liner notes to Mavis’ last record “We’ll Never Turn Back.” But her connection goes deeper than personal relationships. In a year where “hope” and “change” are buzzwords of the day, “Mavis Staples Live: Hope At The Hideout” highlights how those two words are aspirations she has lived her life striving for.\n\nMavis Staples live album set for November release\n\nTuesday, August 5, 2008\n\nTruly great live albums are about capturing lightning in a bottle, that rare and perfect convergence of time, place and performance. When legendary soul/gospel artist Mavis Staples returned home to Chicago this last June for a performance at The Hideout, Chi-Town’s renowned stronghold of alt country and purist rock and roll, it was undeniably such a moment.\n\nThose who packed the sold-out club were blessed with a riveting musical statement as Staples, backed by her fiery three-piece band and three backup singers, put on a rousing musical tour de force. Fortunately, for those of us unable to be there in person, the show was recorded and the album, Mavis Staples Live: Hope at the Hideout, is set for release November 4th.\n\nAcclaim for Staples’ Hideout performance:\n\n“Anyone who was hearing this American treasure in concert for the first time learned precious lessons about where we have been and where we are today. Staples stood tall and shouted, ‘My mind is made up, my heart is fixed.’ And she smiled. She was not alone. – Chicago Sun Times\n\n“There are few living musicians who can lay claim to being America’s conscience, even fewer who continue to make vital music. On Monday night at The Hideout, Mavis Staples proved she’s still capable of both… Staples showed she can light a fire, agitate for change or re-energize the American songbook.” – Time Out Chicago\n\n“While performing a 14-song set that canvassed her 52-year career, Staples sang with a voice that has long distinguished her from the R&B greats of her era and those who reach for that crown today.” – Chicago Tribune\n\n“Staples’ sold out performance at Chicago’s Hideout last night brought the Civil Rights movement and all those souls who marched, sang and prayed during that critical time, to the crowded little room… The ghosts of the marchers stood among us, swaying, stamping, clapping.” – Popmatters\n\nTrack Listing for Mavis Staples Live: Hope at the Hideout\n\n1.

Time Out Chicago’s Scott Smith wrote a nice The TOC Blog > Music post about the recent Mavis Staples show at Hideout, and then updated it with a quote on Hideout from Mavis Staples herself!\n\nYou know how every once in a while you hear about a show that from the sound of it will likely be one of the best shows of the year? Jon Brion’s show at Hideout comes to mind, and another upcoming show at the Hideout is giving me that “Must-see” vibe: Mavis Staples will record a new live album there on Monday June 23.\n\nUpdate: As for why she chose the Hideout for this show, Ms. Staples – via her publicist – had this to say: “I definitely wanted to do something in my hometown. I love playing at Symphony Hall, Millennium Park, Ravinia and places like that but for the live recording, I wanted to do something that was really intimate. I wanted to be able to feel the closeness of the crowd, see the smiling faces up close, you know, feel the spirit, and The Hideout is a perfect place for that.“"
