        "meta_description": "Mavis Staples started her music career as a member of The Staple Singers, where together with members of her family, she recorded a string of hit songs, including \"I'll Take You There,\" \"Respect Yourself,\" and \"Let's Do It Again.\" By the early 1970s, Staples had embarked on a solo career that has been going strong ever since. She’s both a Blues and a Rock n' Roll Hall of Famer; a civil rights icon who marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; a three-time Grammy Award winner; a chart-topping soul, gospel, and R&amp;B pioneer; a National Arts Awards' Lifetime Achievement Award recipient; and a Kennedy Center honoree. She's also performed at John F. Kennedy’s inauguration and at The White House, during Barack Obama's administration, and has collaborated and performed with many famous artists including Prince, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Levon Helm, and more.",
