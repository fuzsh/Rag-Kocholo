        "text": "'Change' is one of the best new songs added to Double J this week.\n\nHaving too much good music to listen to it the best problem to have.\n\nTruth is, we could probably make this article ten times longer each week and still not cover all the excellent new tunes released on a weekly basis. It’s out of control.\n\nToo much great music. So overwhelming. Must find time to listen to Bruce Springsteen.\n\nAs always, our Spotify playlist is here. It’s handy to have it in your playlists, cos you can ignore it for a few weeks, come back, and suddenly there’s a whole stack of amazing new tunes in there for you.\n\nMavis Staples – ‘Change’\n\nOkay so Mavis Staples is literally my hero and without doubt one of my favourite living musicians, so don’t go looking for a fair and balanced review. No, my friends, this was always gonna be a gush\n\nBut I will argue that if you don’t find something beautiful and powerful in this track, taken from her forthcoming, Ben Harper-produced album We Get By, then you are unwilling to be moved by the power of rock’n’roll.\n\nThe dirty guitar shuffle, the light-handed drumming, the sweet, gospel backing vocal, the single handclap that slaps constantly – they’re all perfect. Because they sit right back and let this 79-year-old take centre stage with her impossibly powerful voice and simple, direct message.\n\nMavis has been calling for change for over 50 years now. She’s still doing it and you should be listening. Honestly, every time you hear this brilliant piece of music, why not think about what you can do to change to improve the lives of your fellow citizens – especially those who have it a bit tougher than you?\n\nWe Get By is out Friday 10 May and Mavis will be in the country for Bluesfest over Easter.\n\nDidirri & Ro – ‘Tea Stains’\n\nThis article contains content that is not available.\n\nThis cute duet probably won’t change your life, but it’ll make you feel real good. Didirri and Ro have both charmed their way into our playlists over the past couple of years, thanks to their majestic voices and genuinely unique songcraft. They’re genuinely two of the most exciting emerging artists in the country. So, it stands to reason they’d be perfect in duet as well.\n\nThe best thing about this song is that it sounds both exquisite and casual at the same time. Even though plenty of work would’ve gone into the writing and recording of this to make it so good, it still feels like they just walked into a studio and poured their hearts out without thinking about it too much. It’s a beautiful vibe.\n\nI also drink a minimum of one cup of tea per day – usually Earl Grey, but I’m very openminded – which gives me an immediate predilection for any songs that reference this hot salve (shoutout to Adam Gibson). But even if this was using bourbon (gross) as the metaphor of choice, I’d probably still love it.\n\nAn Horse – ‘This Is A Song’\n\nKate Cooper has been writing amazing hooks for powerful indie rock songs forever. Ask any Brisbane indie rock fan about the best bands of the early-oughts and her name will come up quickly.\n\nSo, it’s such a joy to finally have An Horse back in our lives. They’ve rocketed back into our lives with the kinda power we always want them to possess; driving, straightforward indie rock with melodies that will knock you down.\n\nFans of mid-era Magic Dirt or the sharp power pop of bands like The Thermals will find much to love about this track. An absolute stomper.\n\nFRANCO – ‘Money Over Matter’\n\nThis article contains content that is not available.\n\nI’m on record as claiming Natalie Slade to be one of the best voices in the country, and this website is littered with praise for Plutonic Lab’s slick and soulful productions. The two of them together as FRANCO was one of our favourite new collaborations of 2018, so we’re thrilled to be able to share another new song from this powerful duo.\n\n‘Money Over Matter’ has that same untouchable coolness that we’ve come to expect from these artists. A synth-heavy modern soul jam with some impressive harmonisation and a vibe that can’t be beat. They’ll have an EP out this Friday, please listen.\n\nDevon Gilfillian – ‘Get Out and Get It’\n\n‘Get Out and Get It’ is a very tidy modern soul monster from Devon Gilfillian, an artist I literally have never heard of in my life before this song.\n\nThis thing took some putting together, with co-writer Jamie Lidell and producer Shawn Everett helping Gilfillian create a seriously dense and seriously cool piece of psychedelic soul. Gilfillian says the inspiration from the song came from a song called ‘In The Jungle’ by 1970s Nigerian group The Hygrades, and that is pretty damn obvious when you hear it.\n\nBut the message is just as important here. It’s a track that oozes with optimism and preaches empowerment; perfect for your daily session of staring at the mirror.\n\nUnderworld – ‘Brussels’ and ‘Appleshine’\n\nTwo new tracks from Underworld’s latest EP, DRIFT Episode 2 “ATOM”.\n\n‘Brussels’ is big and bassy. A bold, heavy hitter of a track propelled by a deep rumble, while also offering something atmospheric and beautiful over the top. It feels very freeform in the way that much of Underworld’s best work always does, but comes together really neatly by its conclusion.\n\nThere’s no getting around the fact that ‘Appleshine’ is ten minutes long. But I promise it’s worth it. It’s the kinda song that makes you want to move forward, hurtle yourself into the next dimension. It’s amazing how a well-constructed, deep and propulsive electro track can do that. The whole thing is very gentle; the vocals, the atmospheric synth and even that pulsing beat. But it has great power. A lovely piece. If you can’t get enough, Australian jazzniks The Necks have collaborated with the band for a version that goes for a totally normal and not at all intimidating 47 minutes.\n\nThe British prog-house kings will be back in Australia for Vivid in May.\n\nBig Thief – ‘UFOF’\n\nBig Thief released one of 2017’s most powerful albums in Capacity. This means we approach ‘UFOF’ with a great deal of excitement, but I don’t think we were quite ready for what was to come. The song is a fantastical tale about being meeting a new friend from outer space, and bidding them goodbye. It’s probably a metaphor, but you can imagine it’s about an actual alien if you like.\n\nLenker’s vocal is gentle, as is the rolling guitar and drums that kicks the song off. But then it gets weird, which takes it from being a really sweet little indie-folk song into something far more ambitious, far riskier and with a far greater payoff. It starts with an unexpected chord change, then a barely audible, alien-sounding vocal drone that sits below everything. Then it’s strange, chopped up vocal samples that, in other hands, would come across as a bit naff. But they just add to the alien elegance of this track. Fascinating stuff.\n\nBig Thief’s new album U.F.O.F. is out Friday 3 May. Get ready.\n\nBillie Marten – ‘Betsy’\n\nIt feels like you’re listening in to a private conversation when you play this new track from 19-year-old British singer Billie Marten.\n\nLike you’re on the train and the person in front of you is talking loudly on the phone to someone called Betsy and you know that you shouldn’t be listening in but it’s their fault for making this call in the quiet carriage and the guests on the podcast you’re listening to don’t know how to speak into a microphone.\n\nThis is all backed by a gentle, indie-folk arrangement and Marten’s impossibly beautiful voice, making it both gripping and pleasant. Marten’s new album Feeding Seahorses By Hand is about a month away.\n\nThe Laurels – ‘Monkey On My Back’\n\nSome great late-60s vibes here. You can feel the Revolver influence right from the outset. Sometimes pulling such a strong influence from the best band of all time goes very badly, but The Laurels channel it in precisely the right way. They inject a sense of fun and a modern sheen that proves they’re inspired by the past but not trying to replicate it. The band will release their third album some time fairly soon.\n\nRob Snarski – ‘All God’s Creatures’"
