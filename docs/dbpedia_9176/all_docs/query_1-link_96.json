        "text": "Arcade Fire members Win Butler and Régine Chassagne covered Talking Heads‘ art-funk classic “Slippery People” with Mavis Staples at a 2014 concert honoring the R&B icon. That live collaboration, featured in upcoming CD/DVD set Mavis Staples: I’ll Take You There – An All-Star Concert Celebration, is available to stream via Spotify.\n\nThe one-night-only supergroup nails the funky guitar and synth strut from the original version, which appears on Talking Heads‘ fifth LP, 1983’s Speaking in Tongues. Staples and Butler swap lead vocals over the layered groove, which builds toward a climax with soulful brass.\n\nButler and Chassagne joined a genre-spanning line-up for the 2014 concert, held in Staples hometown of Chicago. Other performers included Bonnie Raitt, Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, Emmylou Harris, Gregg Allman, Eric Church, Michael McDonald, Joan Osborne, Glen Hansard, Widespread Panic, Grace Potter, Taj Mahal, Buddy Miller, Otis Clay, Keb’ Mo’ and Patty Griffin.\n\nTrending\n\nThe concert was documented for an upcoming TV special, which airs April 16th at 10 p.m. ET on AXS TV. The CD/DVD set is out June 2nd via Blackbird Presents Records. Among the highlights is a bombastic all-star version of the Band’s “The Weight.”\n\nStaples previously teamed with Arcade Fire for the band’s disco-gospel hybrid “I Give You Power,” which benefited the ACLU. She also recently appeared alongside Pusha T on Gorillaz’ “Let Me Out” from their upcoming fifth LP, Humanz."
