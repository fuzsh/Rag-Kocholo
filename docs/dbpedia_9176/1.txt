History Highlight:

Mavis Staples is 85 today. Born July 10, 1939, in Chicago, Illinois, she first started singing with her family as a part of the Staple Singers in 1950 at church and occasionally on the radio. The group scored their first hit in 1956 with "Uncloudy Day". Eventually the family would not just blow up the gospel scene, but also transitioned their focus to covering songs with a message as a part of the civil rights movement - songs such as Bob Dylan's "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" and Stephen Stills' "For What It's Worth" as long as their own songs with a message. She released her first solo album in 1969 - and has been recording and performing since. In February of 2016 her album Livin' on a High Note was released. Produced by M. Ward, the album features songs written specifically for Staples by Nick Cave, Justin Vernon, tUnE-yArds, Neko Case, and others. She released her latest album, the live collection Carry Me Home, in 2022 with Levon Helm. Staples put out “Worthy,” a collaboration with MNDR, in June.
