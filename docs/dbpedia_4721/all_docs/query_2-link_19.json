        "text": "Just returned from Russia on Uniworld's River Victoria and had a wonderful trip. This was our first river cruise, so we were not sure what to expect, but we thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nTransfers: we were met at the airport in Moscow by Uniworld representatives. We had to wait about 30 minutes for another flight, but then it was off to the ship. Unfortunately the transfer to the ship took almost 3.5 hours. We did arrive at Domodedovo, which is well south of the city center (the cruise terminal is on the northwest side of Moscow). Sheremetyevo is on the same side of the city as the terminal, so wouldnâ€™t think it would take nearly that long to get to the ship. It was also Friday, which we were told is by far the worst traffic day (all the other bus trips into the city centers only took less than an hour). When leaving in St. Petersburg, we had to leave at 3:30am to catch a 6:20am, so if you have an early flight, be prepared to get up very early. They did provide a continental breakfast that morning for the early transfers.\n\nThe ship: the ship was spotless and seemed well maintained. I personally wasn't crazy about the decor: too much white for me, but that's totally subjective. Our room was a Cat 4; at only 135 sq ft, it was on the smaller size, but was big enough since we were not in the room that much. It had plenty of storage and enough room under the bed for 2 suitcases. There were 2 North American electrical outlets (one in the bathroom for shavers), one UK, 1 Australian, and 4 European. There was also a safe, an alarm clock, and hair dryer in the room. We were also provided with a 1.5 liter bottle of water that was changed out as it was emptied (although we were skipped a few times).\n\nFood: the food overall was very good. Some of the beef dishes were a little tough and the fish was slightly overcooked at times, but was always edible and seasoned well. The pork dishes were usually spot on. The desserts were never overly sweet and the ice cream was fantastic. The Baked Alaska, or I guess in this case Baked Siberia, was the best I've ever tasted. Generally you had the choice of 2 appetizers, a soup, the choice of 3 entrees (meat, fish, & vegetarian), and a choice of 2 desserts. Portion sizes were on the smaller size, but was always enough and presented nicely. Breakfast was generally the same every morning. There was always scrambled eggs, bacon, and sausage (although more along the lines of a hot dog wiener). Fried eggs were generally rotated with various types of omelets and there was usually some type of potatoes available. Lunch was served buffet style with usually a meat and fish dish offered, with various vegetables and desserts.\n\nTours: this was our biggest concern since we're not overly fond of organized tours, but all of our guides were great. They all gave us free time after the tours to wander off and explore on our own which we loved. We did hear some grumblings about other guides, but we had no complaints with any of ours. For each tour, they did offer a slower paced group for anybody that wanted to join it. Before getting off the ship, you'd go the the reception desk and get your boarding pass, then hand it back in when you came back onboard. If you were going on a tour, you picked up your boarding pass and group number. As you can imagine, there is a great deal of walking and the Moscow and St. Petersburg portions of the cruise are rather intensive. A word of warning, the itineraries for Moscow and St. Petersburg were switched around completely from what the Cruise Companion stated they would be, so if you're considering hiring a private guide for the leisure time, be aware that the itinerary could be altered. Our day of leisure in Moscow was supposed to be on Monday according to the Cruise Companion, but was switched to Sunday.\n\nActivities: while sailing between Moscow and St. Petersburg, a few activities were offered such as lectures, shopping tips, language lessons, blini demonstration and tasting, and vodka tasting. There was also nightly music and dancing in the Chagall Lounge, as well as a guest talent show. Unfortunately, we only made it to the blini tasting; we were content relaxing on deck watching the beautiful scenery pass by.\n\nStaff & crew: everyone aboard was great. Although most could only speak basic English related to their specific job duties, they were always friendly and tried very hard to please. This being the first sailing of the season you could see that they were still a little unorganized and timid, especially the dining staff, but we saw improvement each day and it was great to see them become more comfortable with us and start to engage us in conversation. Lena, the cruise director was absolutely great. She learned our names on the first day and was always quick to help with advice on how to spend our leisure time. Unlike previous tour managers we've had, she encouraged exploring on your own, which we liked.\n\nThere were a few nitpicking issues. The wifi was spotty and very slow, and didn't work at all in Moscow. It did improve as the cruise went on, but overall wasn't very reliable. Sometimes, the dinners were 2 to 2.5 hours, with lags of 30 minutes or more between courses, but that too improved as the cruise went on. Also, while docked in Moscow and St. Petersburg, it seemed they turned the air off at night. It was freezing cold during the day, and burning hot in the early morning hours. I had sinus issues right before leaving Moscow and felt a couple times like I was running fever, so I thought maybe it was just me imagining it, but after talking to other people on the last day of the cruise, I discovered I wasn't the only one who thought that. There was a thermostat in the room but I think it was mostly for show. Lol.\n\nAgain, all of the issues were minor and didn't detract from the overall experience. For me personally, this was an incredible experience. I'm in my late 30's and remember growing up listening to all the \"saber rattling\" between the US and the Soviet Union, worrying about nuclear war, and watching clips on the news of the military parades in Red Square, and to actually get to walk in Red Square, it was just an amazing experience, one I'll never forget.\n\nIf you're considering going to Russia, whether on a river cruise or land tour, my advice is \"GO.\" For us, it was an almost perfect trip. We had great weather, great tour guides, and a perfect mix of fast paced touring in Moscow and St. Petersburg with the slower relaxing pace of the river cruise between the two. We also liked the fact there was plenty of leisure time. Uniworld has created a nice mix of guided tours with leisure time. We basically had a full day and an afternoon of free time in Moscow and each afternoon in St. Petersburg was free to join an optional tour, explore on your own, or relax on the boat.\n\nSome tips for those of you going: bring mosquito repellant - they were bad a couple of nights transiting the locks and in Uglich. The toilet paper on the Victoria made sandpaper feel soft, so may want to bring some from home. Bring a European adapter for the electrical outlets. Shampoo, conditioner, soap, and body lotion were all provided. Don't be afraid to use the metro and explore on your own - its a 10-15 minute walk in both cities and getting around is easy. Do not miss the Amber Room at Catherineâ€™s Palace - indescribable. And again, if you're considering Russia, \"GO.\"\n\nI'll be happy to answer any questions so feel free to ask. Also, I will try to post pictures somewhere, and I will be happy to share a link for that too once I get around to doing it. Hope this helps.\n\nTim\n\nI posted this on the ROLL CALL boards, but thought some may not read that one...\n\nSorry it's taken me a while to post upon our return on Jun 15th, but the last few days of the cruise I caught the inevitable cold that was going around the ship, and am just now feeling like a human being.\n\nAs many of you know, Fran, Else and I (and spouses) were on the same River Victoria cruise from May 30 to June 11. Fran and I finally met each other about half way through the cruise.\n\nI agree with her totally about the mobility issue in Russia - it's not very friendly to those with those kinds of issues, although I was constantly amazed by those on our ship who were mobility challenged that did manage to keep up. There are however, endless stairs and cobbled streets. The walking was fairly level, but staircases a plenty.\n\nWe had room 427 on the Victoria, and it was a delight. It's a Junior Suite and had plenty of room. There was ample room for both of us to move around the cabin at the same time without getting in each others way. From looking at some of the other cabins, I wouldn't say the same thing, but the Junior Suite was spacious. If you are booking either of the Junior Suites, do be aware that the showers in both cabins leak out from the bottom. Uniworld is aware of the problem, but it's a design flaw that has the lip of the shower on the floor in the wrong position and will require a complete redo of the shower area, so this is unlikely to be fixed before next year. It's not a big problem, just ask for extra towels to mop up after each shower. I would book this room again, even with this slight flaw.\n\nI also agree with Fran's assessment that the food exceeded our expectations. I would rate the food as good (not great) in general, with some meals being fantastic. The fish was always good, and the beef slendom was. When beef was on offer, I took the fish and was not disappointed. The pork was always good, but the chicken tended to be a little on the dry side. The breads were good, and the croissants in the morning were fabulous! The bread pudding Fran mentioned was some of the best I've ever had, and I consider myself to be a bread pudding expert.\n\nService was very freindly and attentive, although the dinner meal tended to take longer than it probably should have, but we enjoyed meeting others on the cruise, and there's nothing else to do. The typical dinner took well over an hour.\n\nWe loved our cruise director, Elena! She went out of her way to make sure everyone was as satified as they could be. This is a tough job though, as some people want the tours to go fsster and take in more sights, and others want them to go slower. And of course, as you've no doubt already read, the traffic in St Petersburg and Moscow is a nightmare, so folks were a bit grumpy about the time spent on busses. But Elena was gracious and very well informed about everything and made it all enjoyable. The hotel manager, Alexander, is very young (25), energetic, and responsive.\n\nInternet was horrible. We had brought our own mini-laptop, and could only get connected one or two times, even in St Pete and Moscow. Totally pitiful! Free, but pitiful.\n\nI'll post later about the excursions, but someone asked what to do with a half day in Moscow. I would suggest going INSIDE St Basil's cathedral on Red Square. I know, you will see plenty of churchs on this trip, but St Basil's was complletely different from the inside of any other church we saw. Most cruise tours do not take you inside this church, and it was one of the best things we did and I'm so glad we did it on our own and didn't miss it.\n\nOverall, this was a fabulous trip! Hope you all enjoy yours as much as we did ours.\n\nLater."
