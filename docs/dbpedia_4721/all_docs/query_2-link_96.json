I just follow the facts in this case: The description says: Factory PR photo, the license says {{PD-Italy}}, thats it. If there is not a 100% proof that the image is from the government you cannot simply change the license to keep the image, assumption are not accepted here. I keep the image deleted because of the {{PD-Italy}}, maybe you like to ask others for undeletion of the image. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nI followed the edits made by User:G.dallorto to your images, he reverted your license change back from PD-ItalyGov to PD-Italy. I dont marked the image with the speedydeletion but with no source, because if an image is PD-ItalyGov it must be the work of the Italian Government. --Martin H.

It would be a valuable addition to a composite figure demonstrating the basic principles of sonar ranging. As this will be such a small part of the figure, do you still desire attribution?\n\nYours faithfully\n\nR.bares (talk)\n\nI don't desire attribution in this case.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nThat is very kind of you. Not meaning to take advantage of your generosity but may I also make the same use of the svg for Quebec class SS in the same figure? This would work nicely as the vessel towing the sonar array. At present the figure shows the Typhoon SSBN towing an array and with reverberant reflections from the sea floor. If I included the Quebec SS as the transmitter the Typhoon SSBN could be used as a target instead, which would naturally be preferable. R.bares (talk)\n\nOK. You can use \"Quebec class SS\" in the same way.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nFile:Tango_B-396_Model.JPG has been listed at Commons:Deletion requests so that the community can discuss whether it should be kept or not.

Simple request: Please make a difference between the details of the ship herself and her history. I myself always use:\n\n==Ship==\n\nType:\n\nDesign by:\n\nOrder date:\n\nBuilt by:\n\nYard No:\n\nKeel laid:\n\nLaunch date:\n\nDate of completion:\n\nLength over all: m\n\nLPP: m\n\nBeam: m\n\nDraught: m\n\nGRT:\n\nDWT:\n\nNET:\n\nSail area:\n\nMain engine:\n\nSpeed: kn\n\nTEU:\n\nReefer points:\n\n==History==\n\n(year) Named:\n\nand leave out what isn't applicable, as Sail area for motorships and TEU and Reefer points for old ships. See that you make a difference between the builder of the hull and the final builder. That is much better than what I did. I'll try to follow that. --Stunteltje (talk)\n\nOK. But, what is LPP? What about displacement and tanker's volume?--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nLPP means Length Per Perpendiculars, as far as I know measured on the waterline. I haven't an opinion on displacement and tanker's volume. --Stunteltje (talk)\n\nPlease realise that you create a hell of a lot of work when you categorise by old names of coutries. For the Netherlands we will have in that case at least:\n\nShips of the Seven United Provinces (translated)\n\nShips of the Republik\n\nShips of the Kingdom of Holland\n\nand so on. I just used Russia and did not deviate between the old country names. Do you see what will happen with the ships of the former DDR ? --Stunteltje (talk)\n\nOK. But what about Category:Naval ships of the Soviet Union, for example? And what about Category:Ships of the Soviet Union, which was created in 2006?--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nSorry for the delayed anwer. (Brought my ship from Meerkerk to Gorinchem.) The categories were created far before I started in Wikipedia and I haven't a solid answer. I saw you opening a new category and was afraid that we have to split all ships by ancient countrynames. Perhaps the question was raised earlyer. So perhaps you can ask this at the right place. (Village pump ? Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Ships on the English Wikipedia?) Problem must be wider than for ships only. --Stunteltje (talk)\n\nAfter all I think you were right. We are all working on the basic material of an encyclopedia and extra work is not a good reason not to do things right. I assume you are in the position to give a correct timetable and the correct countrynames. It has to come on top of the categories, to make clear what happend. We have to recategorise the Russian ships (and the German, I am afraid). Some ships will have two countries in succession, but they had, in fact. --Stunteltje (talk)\n\nThe other day I created Ships of the German Democratic Republic. I guess it's debatable if this should go into Category:Ships by country or into a separate hierarchy. Personally, I think it's an advantage if ships can also be found by historic entities, especially for naval ships. Obviously, for ships that still exist, the current flag is also of importance.\n\nEventually, I will try to generate another list (Commons:Ships by flag), similar to Ships by shipyard. As there are a couple of things I'd like to do before, this might take some time though. -- Docu at\n\nI think the Category:Ships by flag will be equal to Category:Ships by country because ships are categorized by flags into categories by country.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nAccording the English Wiki the Soviet Union existed between 1922 and 1991. The Russian Federation assumed its rights and obligations. Can the move be done by bot or have we te recategorise by hand? --Stunteltje (talk)\n\nIf the photo created between 1922 and 1991 the ship's category with it must be move into Category:Ships of the Soviet Union. But all ship's category from Category:Ships of the Soviet Union will not in Category:Ships of Russia because some of ships was got other flags after 1991, for example, flag of Ukraine. I think bot can do first condition.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nHi Mike, if you find the time, please correct Project 667BDRM drawing [1]:\n\n667 BDR = ПМУ радиосекстана & перископ астрокорректора «Волна»\n\n667 BDRM = ПМУ радиосекстана &перископ астрокорректора «Волна»\n\nWith best regards, Alexpl (talk)\n\nWhat is your source? I have photo of 667BDRM with astrocorrector only. So I should delete radiosekstant.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nThe one and only Ю.В.Апальков from Корабли ВМФ СССР Том I, his drawing of a 667BDRM turret shows only \"радиосекстана\".\n\n667BDRM one hatch only in the middle of the turretroof: [2]\n\n667BDR two hatches in the middle of the turretroof [3] Alexpl (talk)\n\nPhoto with astrocorrector. I think Ю.В.Апальков made mistake.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nIs that from a book ? Alexpl (talk)\n\nI found the photo on forum (previous link).--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nHm, I´m working on a 667BDRM drawing (turret only) myself - so I wonder if the photo from the forum may be photoshopped. Alexpl (talk)\n\nI don't think so. For what?--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nOnly picture of its kind on the web, bad quality, greyscale, 90° sideview - are good indicators. I will try to find out more, but it may take a while. Alexpl (talk)\n\nI think it's official photo. They were shoot near 90° in gray scale. Bad quality is a result of non qualified scanning or scanning from book. For example, see ISBN 5-85879-155-7 for other such photos.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nDone according photo.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nGood work. I checked the photo with others (not showing the astro-sensor) and found out that the dimensions do match. So it could be correct. From right to left we have now: 1.Sintez Sat Com/Nav (Pert Spring) 2. MT-70-8 TV-periscope 3.IBA-MB antenna 4. commanders periscope 5. astrocorrector 6. \"Park Lamp\" (7. \"Kaskad\" Radar 8. Anis antenna \"Shotgun\") 9. I dont know 10. MRP-21A Zaliv-P ESM.Alexpl (talk)\n\nThank you. 9 is snorkel.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nOh, so they used a different snorkel on Delta IV compared to the models used on Delta-I/II/III. Do you know a photo of the Radiosextant on Projekt 667BDR, 667BD, or 667B ?Alexpl (talk)\n\nYes. Delta IV have combined device: snorkel and VAN-M antenna (ru: ПМУ РДП и ВАН-М). Unfortunately I didn't find photo of Radiosextant.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nOk, I uploaded my drawing. I would appreciate your help in checking it for mistakes. Alexpl (talk)\n\nGood. All major elements are correct. Minor elements have differences: wire laid on the turret side differently; turret has two rectangular elements (I don't know what is it), but you draw only one; you didn't draw front antenna. --Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nOk, you think the second (left) \"diving plane\" [4] should be visible and the wire on the turretside follows a different path. Ok. What \"front antenna\" do you mean ? Alexpl (talk)\n\nNo. I talk about two little panels near roof of turret and not about diving plane (And I think portside diving plane willn't be visible). The second of them (from front to poop) is where the wire end. Front antenna is on turret. It has rectangular shape. It's like Delta III has but bigger. Апальков didn't draw all of this elements.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nSee photos from [5]--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nAh, I see, the antenna left from the windscreen ! I have uploaded a new version of the file, but I´m not totally sure about the wire, going down on the right side of the turret. Alexpl (talk)\n\nHi, Mike\n\nCongratulations for your identification of the ship on my photo. --Tangopaso (talk)\n\nYou are doing a great job, but unfortunately on the last move I have to make a remark. Please look at the bow of the ship. She isn't the Vera Cruz, but the P&O Nedlloyd Vera Cruz. --Stunteltje (talk)\n\nYes. That's why I changed sorting key in the Category:Ships of P&O Nedlloyd only. It's like Category:Ships of CMA CGM or Category:Ships of COSCO.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nThanks, understood. --Stunteltje (talk)\n\nStunteltje, what sorting key use for shipping vessels in Category:Ships by name? I found two variants: by license number and by name.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nFor Category:Fishing vessels by license number there is no sorting key, as the number is painted in big capitals on the ship and the name in most cases somewhere in smal capitals only. For that reason the title of the category of a fishing vessel starts with the license number, followed by the name. I used the sorting key \"name\" for category:Ships by name. --Stunteltje (talk)\n\nOK. Thank you.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nAppreciate it. Ingolfson (talk)\n\nI have my doubts about the bunker vessels. Here in Rotterdam we see a bunker vessel as a barge that brings the fuel to sea-going vessels. Sometimes somewhat bigger, an old coaster, but we see no chemical tankers as bunker vessels. Please have a look. --Stunteltje (talk)\n\nWhich ship makes you doubt?--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nE.G. This one File:Bestella at Panama.jpg. Might be that in other countries the bunker vessels are bigger, or this one is a speciality. Cannot find the one you added to the category any more, as Docu filled my list with ships :=)) --Stunteltje (talk)\n\nDear Mike1979Russia, not all small ships travelling on the rivers Elbe or Weser to the ports of Hamburg or Bremen are sea-river going vessels. We understand this term for sea ships that are capable of using the river Rhine to the interior of Germany. Bremen and Hamburg have ports that can be reached by big vessels although it is a three-hours-journey from the sea. Please have a look on the website of the shipping company of the ship you want to categorize before telling the world that a ship is a sea-river going ship.78.55.61.122\n\nDear Mike1979_Russia, please be aware that Hong Kong has an own ship register which is separated from the ship register of the People's Republic of China. Hong Kong has a special status, see Wikipedia article about Hong Kong.78.55.4.84\n\nTemplate:Ship --AVRS (talk)\n\n[6]:\n\nSource: \"In this regard, in February 2002, the GPA on behalf of the Government entered into a contract with Kiev Shipbuilding and Repair Yard of Ukraine (KSSRY) for the construction and delivery of 3 new passenger Ferries to the tune of USD 6.65 million. Due to delay in the construction works, the ferries were transferred to Damen Shipyard in Romania for completion. Construction works on the first ferry-Kanilai, have since been completed and delivered to the Authority. This ferry was commissioned on 25 th of July 2005 and is fully operational between Banjul and Barra. As regards the other two ferries, namely Soma and Farafenni, Construction works are at an advance stage and they expected to be delivered in 2006, and will be deployed to Transgambia.\"\n\nIn servcie: 4. September 2006 [7]\n\n--Atamari (talk)\n\nI get info from seaagent.com. There's a place of building specified Ukraine. Maybe some works was done in Romania but most of ship was built in Ukraine.\n\nWe write the date of completion in template which is not equal to the date of commission.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nHello Mike!\n\nAn IP editied this image by having identified the submarine differently. I do not know which sub it is. Can you help? Do you know if this edit by the IP is correct? Thank you in advance. --High Contrast (talk)\n\nShe is TK-202.\n\n1. TK-13 has pairing the light hull near the Rescue chamber more smoother. So she is TK-208 or TK-202 with sharp pairing.\n\n2. The source of the photo give a date 27.11.2007. But another photo of the same ship [8] and the article have date august 1999.\n\n3. Only TK-202 went to utilization in 1999. You can see she during utilization in GoogleEarth on Severodvinsk 2003 photos in the same place.\n\n4. TK-208 has name \"Dmitriy Donskoy\" and never been utilized.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nHello. I identified this sub as TK-13 according only to date, stated in description (2007). TK-202 and TK-12 were scrapped before 2007. TK-208, TK-17 and TK-20 are still \"in service\", so TK-13 was the only variant. But now I see that flickt tells that photo was taken on November 27, 2007, while this one in the same time is stated to be taken in 2009, despite the fact that it describes the event in 1999. According to Mike's arguments about differences between TK-208+TK-202 and other ships of class, I claim that there is a mistake in flickr dates, and this is TK-202 without any doubt, 'cause TK-208 is still in service at the moment. This photo must be renamed, because it was taken not in 2007, but much earlier. --Rave (talk)\n\nЯ сегодня утром не смог найти фото для немецкой и эстонской страницы, так как этого проекта (Октябрьская революция) нет в перечне. Я поставлю категорию проекта сейчас.

Спасибо Вам, иначе бы многие из моих статей были бы инвалидами, с уважением\n\n--PjotrMahh1 (talk)\n\nThanks for correcting the tanker categories. I have no idea where the information can be found, so I just use \"tankers\" as category. --Stunteltje (talk)\n\nВ описании возможно(?) пропущено промежуточное название \"Речное облако\" Rechnoye Oblako, видел на сайте - Volga Drim\n\n--PjotrMahh1 (talk)\n\nДополнил.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nThank You Mike, ещё один момент, я сегодня дополнил эту категорию, там ошибочно дана верфь ГДР, там был построен океанский Александр Пушкин (1965), я сам ставил фото на немецкую страницу - это сейчас Marco Polo, даю линк для проверки [Photo Aleksandr Pushkin (1965)]. А тут австрийская верфь, есть статья в Википедии по-русски, сейчас напишу по-эстонски, всего хорошего, спасибо за фотографии и отличные тексты,\n\n--PjotrMahh1 (talk)\n\nПоправил.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nBadzil (talk)\n\nMike, ты случайно не в курсе, как эту фотку Xian Ni (я сегодня сделал статьи на эстонском и немецком) и другие загрузить в Wikimedia Commons, я в основном пока загружаю фотки от Алексея Яблонского типа File:785 shevchenko 3.jpg, и не могу понять, как получить разрешение у других участников, фотки которого есть на его сайте, особенно проект Россия 785-й интересует.\n\nВторой момент, многие сайты пишут, что Xian Ni (Princess Jeannie) - это Александр Грин, что самое неприятное, даже те, кто путешествовал на нём. У меня в статьях этот пошёл как \"Константин Станюкович\".\n\nЗаранее спасибо, --PjotrMahh1 (talk)\n\nЧитай ru:ВП:ДОБРО. Единственный способ списаться с авторами фотографий. С автором Xian Ni можно попробовать связаться через Фликр, возможно он даст разрешение или заменит лицензию на Фликре на поддерживаемую Коммонс. А с авторами фотографий с сайта Яблонского через него.\n\nТакже при загрузке фотографий Яблонского нужно указывать только лицензию GDFL насколько я понял из описания. Лицензию CC нужно убрать. Не знаю насколько это критично.\n\nДополнительные вопросы можно задать на ru:ВП:Авторское право.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nСпасибо за ответ, я загрузил от Алексея Яблонского (Aleksey Yablonskiy) десятки фотографий на Викисклад и проблем ни разу не было, а вот до Фликр я так и не дошёл пока. Я даже не совсем понимаю, что это такое. Я сейчас пишу по поводу \"Дмитрий Фурманов\"а, информация, что это был Сергей Рахманинов не подтвердилась, возможно в Infoflot ошиблись, а в регистре никаких других названий не видно, там тоже масса фоток, вот бы достать! Регистр с фотографиями, и я подал заявку на переименование категории с Dmitri ... на Dmitriy Furmanov, с праздниками,\n\n--PjotrMahh1 (talk)\n\nMike1979 Russia/Archive 1== New line drawings ==\n\nHello Mr Mike, I'm a Wikipedian from the English subdomain, and I'm at the moment working on Soviet/Russian articles. I'd like to know if you would mind creating a number of line drawings of missiles and ships for my work. I'm very passionate about Soviet/Russian maritime affairs, and I would have thought it would be great I can have some assistance from a great person like you. You can contact me at en:User talk:Sp33dyphil. Thanks Sp33dyphil\n\nThe reason why I put the pennant number in front of the name has no other reason the consistancy with the fishing vessels. They have a license number painted in big figures on the hull and very small painted nameplates. That is why we have categories like Category:Fishing vessels by license number. The image is of a certain date and at that time she had that pennant number. Glad to see that i wasn't completely mistaken about the vessel. Cannot read nor speak the Russian language. --Stunteltje (talk)\n\nThis number is tactical number in Russian NAVY. It isn't pennant number (constant during ship's life in most cases) or hull number (constant during ship's life). It changes randomly and it doesn't mean anything (so there isn't any consistency with fishing licenses). And ship can have many tactical number or only one during her life. That's why Russian navy ships categories are without it now.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nThanks for the explanation. Understood. No problem with renaming of category. Please copy the reason to the category too. --Stunteltje (talk)\n\nHi, I thought it would be possible to run a bot to put existing ship info into a template but actually it seems rather complicated as there are so many parameters and data are not page structures are not totally standardized. I am afraid that it will not be much quicker than to do it by hand. Another thing, is there are any freely accessible authoraritative database for ships on the internet ? If so it could be a good idea to add a link to it in the template. To an external reader there is always a suspicion that data in Wikipedia / Wikicommons have been vandalized or are otherwise incorrect, so having a link to another website could be a kind of warrant of reliability. --Zolo (talk)\n\n1. I think too because the information is enough formalized. Docu advised me to ask about it on Commons:Bots/Work requests‎‎. Maybe you'll make a request.\n\n2. There isn't any complete authoritative database for ships in the internet. There are some open official registers (Russian, DNV, German Lloyd, Nippon, ABS). But they don't have information about all ships. Сontent of the information from them differ to each other, for example, DNV has info about previous flags but German Lloyd hasn't. When ship dead information about she is deleted from registries. That's why I find additional info and info about dead ships on non so authoritative databases, for example, on shipspotting site. But I think it's possible to make a string for registry from which info was got.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nOk the simplest solution may be to add a \"reference\" field, so that we can add registries or any source from which we can get info. Maybe add a reference section in a separate section below ship history ?--Zolo (talk)\n\nYes. (May be \"sources\"?)--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nI think that if we have just one field for all info, (rather than the more demanding \"one info = one source\" format), we should use \"reference\" rather than \"source\", so that if we change the source of the info and do not update the references, it is still correct. Beside \"references\" has already been translated in many other languages for other templates. --Zolo (talk)\n\nOK Try to do it.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nDone--Zolo (talk)\n\nI try it Category:IMO 7945869. It can be more than one sources. I think It'll be better if references will be in the end of page after name categories.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nAnother Category:Itelmen (ship, 1918). I think references must be after photos in the end of page.\n\nAnd \"text\" string must be separate and be first.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nI dont know how to put references below subcategories and images. I am not sure it can be done with simple templates. Maybe put registry links at the bottom of the infobox like database links in Creator:Leonardo da Vinci ?\n\nYes.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nI have added a \"russian registy\" paramter. See Category:IMO 7945869. It can be done for national registries but not for all possible databases. Other will still have to go to \"references\". When there are several of them, they should go in the same parameter (that is |references= Ref 1 Ref 2 not |references= Ref 1 |references= Ref 2).\n\nLet's add other official registries: German Lloyd, DNV, ABC and Nippon.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nAbout the \"text\" parameter, I'll try to do it, but it seems to be a bit tricky to do it correctly. For cases with a simple word like \"decommissionned\", I think it should go to the \"type\" parameter. This way we can check afterwards which common events are missing and thus add them to {{ShipEvent}}--Zolo (talk)\n\nThere is no list of type parameters so it is difficulty to use this variant for me. And De/Comissioned words will not be bold because of confusion with the name. And nevertheless \"text\" must be separate.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nI have tries do simplify {{ShipEvent}}, moved the \"text\" parameter and removed the bold. If there are other type of events that can be useful, you can add them to {{ShipEvent}} and {{Ship/i18n}}, simply following the same pattern as \"shipwreck\" and \"scrapped\". --Zolo (talk)\n\nOK Update the docs, please.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nI think reference to registry can be done with two strings. The first will have the code of registry (RU, GL, ABC and so on), and the second - register number. Like this:\n\n|registry=DNV |registry number=18269\n\n--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nIf a ship is in several registers, we cant do it this way, there cannot be two parameters with the same name in the same template. As {{Ship}} is already so long that we cannot document all parameters using a {{TemplateBox}}, I think the best solution would be to have one \"register\" parameter, that should be filled with a {{ShipRegister}}, like {{Authority control}} here.--Zolo (talk)\n\nShip cann't be in several registries at the same time. But your idea is good.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nDone in {{Ship register}} (example). I did not find how to do it for NK. If thhey remove destroyed ships from public databases, it is also a bit bothering. Apart from that it should work. --Zolo (talk)\n\nExcellent. When I find how NK work I ask you.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nHi Mike, Just to let you know that New ships and Commons:Ships by shipyard have been updated. -- Docu at\n\nI see. I think you was right when delete from New ships ships with IMOcat only.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nUsually there are not that many. There was a bit of a backlog in them (ships by name kept updating). -- Docu at\n\nHi, Mike. I know that photograph is one of Lukull. But your this blind revert is not appropriate. Because we (both you and me) used thıs source: MV Cankaya (Çankaya) (+1942). Moreover you deleted correct information about this ship.Takabeg (talk)\n\nHello. Ships are categorized according to the current name. If the name of the ship on the photo is Lukull the photo should be in Category:Lukull (ship, 1886) only. And Lukull wasn't turkish ship so the Category:Ships of Turkey is not correct in such case. When somebody upload photo of Çankaya this new photo will be in Category:Çankaya (ship, 1886) and Category:Çankaya (ship, 1886) will become \"mother\" category for Category:Lukull (ship, 1886). See description on the page Category:Ships by name.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nI uploaded only one picture (of Lukull). But other users (maybe I) may upload pictures of this ship. Some of them will be of Lukull, some of them will be of Çankaya). As long as I know, projects of Wikimedia are sustainable projects. So we have to consider this point. Shall we continue to discuss this issue at Category talk:Lukull (ship, 1886). Takabeg (talk)\n\nHi Mike, It is possible that the date on my camera was not set right! It was may years ago so i have no other indication than my camera date. Sorry for the confusion. Regards, Alf\n\nThank you.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nFor your fixing up the Svitzer Falcon info - it is appreciated ! SatuSuro (talk)\n\nThank you.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nIts really good to think IMO numbers and info are accessible to help fix info so well SatuSuro (talk)\n\nExperienced a new phenomenon: ships built at the same yard in the same year. Solved it by adding the yard number. But of course this had te be discussed. I am preparing an extension of the on-going discussion about ships by name. See the first parts of User:Stunteltje/Sandbox/Ships, not finished at all, just a start. Please comment there between the lines, because after all I intend to present the suggesions without comments, if we agree on the subjects. I'll ask a few other people too to react there. What do you think? --Stunteltje (talk)\n\nYes. But I think it is not necessary to add a place of built in such cases because the name of category become too long and difficult. And I would add a \"№\" or \"No\" before the yard number to avoid confusion with the year. Example, Stena Tractor (ship, 1999, No 666).--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nHi Mike, отдельные части судов лучше не переносить в категорию (ship, year of build), я раньше ставил, но кто-то потом всё удалил, и наверно это было правильно. Будут ли новые фотографии речных Викингов (не Viking)? С приветом, --PjotrMahh1 (talk)\n\nТы про трубы? Я думаю, лучше вносить, т.к. в противном случае не найдешь, от чего труба. Я столкнулся с этим, по этому, думаю, удаливший был не прав. Будут. --Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nMike, наверно категорию надо поменять - Sergei Yesenin (ship, 1984) на Sergey? С приветом --PjotrMahh1 (talk)\n\nНе уверен, какой вариант правильный. В англ. вики en:Sergei Yesenin, собственно написание я взял оттуда. На самом \"Есенине\" таблички с названием судна на латинице, к сожалению, нет (в отличие, например, от \"Бенуа\", у которого такая табличка есть). --Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nЯ посмотрел статьи в en Sergei Yesenin и en:Sergey Kirov, если посмотреть текст, то всё идёт в перемешку, особенно у Кирова, он то Sergey, то Sergei, Есенин там реже Sergey. Я полагаю, что нужно исходить из RS, как они передают названия морских судов. И применить это дело для речных. Я поэтому Бенуа и не пишу статью, что на судне вывесили Benois или что-то в этом роде. Ну типа Peugeot - Пежо. Мне в принципе всё равно, но должен быть какой-то порядок. Турфирмы ставят, что им вздумается, лишь бы завлечь туристов. Типа Alexandre Pushkine. Ещё у меня вопрос по категории в Викимедиа. Мы ведь ставим дополнение в скобках типа Costa Concordia (ship, 2006) по году постройки согласно регистру, а не по спуску на воду. Правильно?\n\n--PjotrMahh1 (talk)\n\nПока ты отдыхаешь, я посмотрел [Регистр], SERGEY по регистру. Кроме того я подал на исправление ошибки по Красину (1917). В названиях файлов стоит ошибочно (дата постройки 1916). Там написано, что об ошибке можно сообщить по-русски. Посмотрим, кто этим занимается, и какой будет результат, мне нужно исправить на Category:Krasin (ship, 1917), --PjotrMahh1 (talk)\n\nПервое. Да, дата постройки должна соответствовать таковой в регистре. В российском регистре дана только дата постройки, в остальных, как правило, три: закладки, спуска и постройки. Для категории берется последняя. Второе. Базы российского речного регистра в публичном доступе пока не нашел, возможно там вообще нет латиноязычных имен (как в морском). Таблички с латинскими названиями вешают не турфирмы, а операторы или владельцы судов, которые и определяют название судна. Думаю, именно эти название присутствуют в англоязычных документах компаний (например, в договорах с иностранными турфирмами). Следовательно, для судов с табличками нужно использовать написание согласно табличке, для судов без можно использовать систему транслитерации, как в морском. Третье. Т.о. категорию с Есениным стоит переделать аналогично остальным Сергеям. Это можешь сделать и ты, не сообщая об ошибке. Для этого переносишь файлы и инфу, если есть, в новую категорию, а со старой ставишь перенаправление. Последнее. Статью всегда можно переименовать, если выясниться, что название не верное, поэтому смело пиши статью про Бенуя. Если все-таки выясниться, что в речном регистре другое латинское название, просто переименуем статью.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nWas there ever any clearance to do stuff like that [9] on commons and put data on image pages ? Information like that should better be kept in wikipedia, not in commons, since we have no option here to discuss data in an appropriate way. wbr. Alexpl (talk)\n\nI don't know when and where discussed this question but I agree the minimum standard information about ship in category help a user to reliably identify the ship because most of the ships changed their names, owners, numbers, bases and so on. This minimum information is too little for discussing and if you find any errors fix them. The template has \"references\" field so you can check the info in any time. Of course this info should be in wikipedia too if wiki has an article about ship but this minimum is not enough for a wiki article.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nWell, I think this could be potentially dangerous, as it allows to post false information. But since such information are also used in much more delicate fields (Introtext Muhammed for example), I may be ok. At least until Wikidata starts to work. Alexpl (talk)\n\nMike, спасибо за ответ выше, я так и не разобрался с Красиным, дело дошло до международного скандала, но тебе можно ты из России - посмотри работу Витольда Муратова Красин, там неправильно озаглавлен файл, а из-за этого и категория Krasin (ship, 1916). Год постройки - 1917. Ещё один международный скандал разгорается с Хирургом Разумовским. Там у людей окончательно съехала крыша, и они начали переводить названия судов. Появилась доска на судне, см. фото , дискуссия на немецкой странице de:Diskussion:Rodina-Klasse, и есть попытка ввода категории - Category:Surgeon Razumovsky (ship). Категория уже есть, только не подключена к верхней.\n\nЯ начинаю на русских страницах Википедии вставлять таблицы с английской транскрипцией судов по правилам согласно Российскому морскому регистру судоходства, иначе вообще полный отстой. В соседней республике Михаил Ломоносов уже давно с доской Викинг Ломоносов ходит, как впрочем ещё недавно Викинг Киров. И ты наверно видел, что с Александром Блоком сделали. Alexandre Green, да ещё Дату постройки, верфь и т.д. на доске сфальсифицировали, с приветом, --PjotrMahh1 (talk)\n\n\"Сергей Киров\" не переименовывался в \"Викинг Киров\", также не нашел ни одной фотографии с \"Викинг Ломоносов\", так что этот \"креатив\" можно не учитывать.\n\nТаблицы с латинскими названиями отличными от написанных на судах - плохая идея: фактически ты создаешь ОРИССное название, которое нигде не встречается и вносишь дополнительную путаницу. Интервик достаточно.\n\nПравила наименования статей о судах в каждой вики различны. На коммонс название Krasin (ship, 1916) неверное, надо поправить. Но названия фотографий здесь не причем.\n\nНужно четко понимать, что название судна \"Хирург Разумовский\" - по ходу никакой латиницы в речном регистре вообще нет. (Иначе официально был бы \"Viking Truvor\", а не \"Викинг Трувор\"). Т.к. перевод названия значительно отличается от официального названия судна, эту табличку можно игнорировать как исключение.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nIn the german Wikipedia-article \"Funchal\" I have set a photo of 2 passenger ships. - 2 cruise ships of the Black Sea Shipping & Co. - 1978. - As you know, in front is the Maxim Gorkiy and rear ? - Can you find out which ship it is ? - Thanks for the effort. -- Buonasera (talk)\n\nI think she is Category:Odessa (ship, 1974)--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nI am sure you are right, thank you ! -- Buonasera (talk)\n\n-- Docu at\n\nMike, спасибо за новые фотографии судов, которых раньше на складе не было.

Никулиным, на fleetfoto его тоже написали полным именем, так как не было фотографии. Ты же видишь, что на носу и на корме написано Ю. Никулин, ну а посередине на фанере для тех кто не знает, как расшифровывается Ю., я буду в Википедии править на Ю. Никулин по схеме Л.

Поправил.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nWe got a bunch of pictures from a new user, including this one, but the user didnt give us much info about what we see or when the picture was taken. I´m not 100% sure, but I guess we see a Kirov-Class cruiser or maybe a Project 956 destroyer. I added \"Category:Kirov class battlecruiser\", what do you think? wbr, Alexpl (talk)\n\nI think you're right she is Kirov-Class cruiser.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nOk, I asked user Y7mx to add the correct dates for his pictures, so we may be able to find out which cruiser it is. Shouldnt be very difficult since GDR ship \"Wismar\" never left the baltic sea - and not many Kirovs came into the baltic sea if i remember correctly. Alexpl (talk)\n\nДоброго времени суток! Mike1979 как с Вами связаться? Есть вопросы по изображениям подводных лодок.

Категорию Lembit 1936 (спуск на воду), я поменял на 1937 (Year of build), Indienststellung - 14 мая 1937 года. С приветом,\n\n--PjotrMahh1 (talk)\n\nСкорее всего да. Но надежного АИ по этому судну нет: RiverFleet.ru имеет тот же статус как АИ, что и множество иноязычных источников с датой 1995 год. Сложно будет обосновать. Хорошо бы реестр найти.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nMike, извини за беспокойство, тут на fleetphoto.ru у некоторых работ стоит Общественное достояние, не знаю, можно ли грузить, там где было CC-BY-SA, я вчера пару фоток загрузил, а у меня нет Франка, с приветом, --PjotrMahh1 (talk)\n\nА сайт указать я забыл, уже 4 часа утра, Ivan Franko --PjotrMahh1 (talk)\n\nНе стоит. В источниках указаны книги и брошюры, т.о. загрузившие вряд ли имели права на фотографии. Теоретически можно загрузить только изображение открытки, аналогично маркам и конвертам, но этот вопрос я бы уточнил.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nСпасибо за ответ, я вот тоже подумал, что если бы он к своей фотографии поставил Общественное достояние, это одно дело, а тут супер-фотки из советских журналов, в принципе понятия Copyright на фотки в СССР не было, но вот кто бы это проверил и поставил в Commons, причём под свободной лицензией, Александр Савин по идее должен знать, но мне как-то не с руки на него выходить, с приветом, --PjotrMahh1 (talk)\n\nI've reverted your edit.

All Project 588 Riverboats are built by MTW, Wismar (hence in Germany) and already sorted acordingly. Best, --MB-one (talk)\n\nNo. The categorization by class (project) is additional, optional ship categorization. Main ship categorization tree don't include categories by class (see Category:Ships and User:Stunteltje/Sandbox/Ships). So you can add categories by class (for example, add Project 588 Riverboats to the Ships built by MTW, Wismar) but don't delete categories from main tree. And it is explained in the discussion why such cases isn't overcats.--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nThe main category isn't deleted. It is still there just one step away. There is absolutely no reason, why G.V. Plekhanov and all the others must be in Project 588 Riverboats and in one or more of their parent categories. --MB-one (talk)\n\nI think Rolf H. give clear explanation on your discussion page.

We're interested in your opinion as to which images qualify to be the Picture of the Year for 2012. Voting is open to established Wikimedia users who meet the following criteria:\n\nUsers must have an account, at any Wikimedia project, which was registered before Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000 [UTC].\n\nThis user account must have more than 75 edits on any single Wikimedia project before Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000 [UTC]. Please check your account eligibility at the POTY 2012 Contest Eligibility tool.\n\nUsers must vote with an account meeting the above requirements either on Commons or another SUL-related Wikimedia project (for other Wikimedia projects, the account must be attached to the user's Commons account through SUL).\n\nHundreds of images that have been rated Featured Pictures by the international Wikimedia Commons community in the past year are all entered in this competition. From professional animal and plant shots to breathtaking panoramas and skylines, restorations of historically relevant images, images portraying the world's best architecture, maps, emblems, diagrams created with the most modern technology, and impressive human portraits, Commons features pictures of all flavors.\n\nFor your convenience, we have sorted the images into topic categories. Two rounds of voting will be held: In the first round, you can vote for as many images as you like. The first round category winners and the top ten overall will then make it to the final. In the final round, when a limited number of images are left, you must decide on the one image that you want to become the Picture of the Year.\n\nTo see the candidate images just go to the POTY 2012 page on Wikimedia Commons\n\nWikimedia Commons celebrates our featured images of 2012 with this contest.

But categories like Category:Ships of COSCO‎, Category:Ships of CMA CGM etc are of course subcats of Category:Container ships. Hence it is plain overcategorization to put categories of specific vessels in both of them. Best regards --MB-one (talk)\n\nI don't agree with you. There are two branches of categorization: by customer (ship's operator) and by function. When user doesn't know ship's operator it's very difficult to find ship because he must search in all ship's operator categories. It's OK work if ship's name consists of operator's name (COSCO Xxxx, CVA CGM Yyyy, etc).--Mike1979 Russia (talk)\n\nHello Mike1979 Russia!\n\nThank you for your very good drawings of watercraft.

Правый борт закрывает рампа для подъёма на уровень моря, по легенде пол ангара - это дно моря. В ангаре мрак, хотя в 2012 бывало светло, судя по фотографиям. Вспышка не пробьёт с расстояния. Отойти от лодки подальше для съёмки всего правого борта под прямым углом помешает стена ангара.

Thank you!\n\nP 1 9 9 ✉\n\nA community discussion has been closed where the consensus was to grant all file movers the suppressredirect user right. This will allow file movers to not leave behind a redirect when moving files and instead automatically have the original file name deleted. Policy never requires you to suppress the redirect, suppression of redirects is entirely optional.\n\nPossible acceptable uses of this ability:\n\nTo move recently uploaded files with an obvious error in the file name where that error would not be a reasonable redirect. For example: moving \"Sheep in a tree.jpg\" to \"Squirrel in a tree.jpg\" when the image does in fact depict a squirrel.\n\nTo perform file name swaps.\n\nWhen the original file name contains vandalism. (File renaming criterion #5)\n\nPlease note, this ability should be used only in certain circumstances and only if you are absolutely sure that it is not going to break the display of the file on any project. Redirects should never be suppressed if the file is in use on any project. When in doubt, leave a redirect. If you forget to suppress the redirect in case of file name vandalism or you are not fully certain if the original file name is actually vandalism, leave a redirect and tag the redirect for speedy deletion per G2.\n\nThe malicious or reckless breaking of file links via the suppressredirect user right is considered an abuse of the file mover right and is grounds for immediate revocation of that right. This message serves as both a notice that you have this right and as an official warning. Questions regarding this right should be directed to administrators. --Majora (talk)\n\nFile:USAAF Roundel 1942-1943.svg has been listed at Commons:Deletion requests so that the community can discuss whether it should be kept or not.
