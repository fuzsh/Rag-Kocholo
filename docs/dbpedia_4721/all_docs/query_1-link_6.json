        "text": "Itinerary\n\nDay 1\n\nMoscow: Board the ship in the morning. The ship departs at 12:00 p.m.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The program of this cruise doesn't include any sightseeing in Moscow. We will be glad to help you arrange a pre-cruise program in Moscow (hotel, excursions, transfers), just ask your reservation specialist.\n\nDay 2\n\nUglich: Walking city tour with the visit to the territory of the Kremlin, exclusive concert of choir “Kovcheg”, visit to the home of local family (Russian izba, degustation of Russian home-made vodka, pickled goods, tea-party with pies), free time\n\nUglich was founded in 1148 as a small princedom bordering on Muscovy and is one of the most beloved towns in Old Russia. The view of the town as you approach it from the Volga River is breathtaking with the Cathedral of the Resurrection and St. John's Church rising on the horizon. The history of the town is fascinating; At the end of the 16th century, Maria Nagaya, seventh wife of Ivan the Terrible, lived in honorary exile at the Kremlin in Uglich. It was here in her garden that the 10 year old Prince Dmitry of the Rurik Dynasty, heir to the Russian throne was murdered by Boris Godunov who wanted to seize power for himself. On the spot of his death, the Church of St. Demitrius of the Blood was built and still stands today. The death of Prince Dmitri brought on the start of the Time of Troubles, a dynastic and political crises and one of the most tumultuous periods in Russian history which ended 15 years later after the election of a new Tsar, Mikhail Romanov (the first Tsar of the Romanov Dynasty). Inside the Kremlin the oldest building in Uglich, the Palace of Tsarevich Dmitry also stands. During your time in Uglich you will learn more about the town's past and walk along the paths of Russian history.\n\nDay 3\n\nGoritsy: Visit to Ferapontov monastery\n\nGoritsy is a tiny settlement 7 kilometers from the St. Cyril on the White Lake Monastery. The remains of the Nunnery of the Resurrection that sits on the banks of the Sheksna River can be visited and is within a quarter of a mile of where the ship stops. Goritsy is definitely a site to see for anyone with an interest in Russian history. St. Cyril on the White Lake was founded in 1397 by Kirill Belosersky on the shore of Lake Siverskoye. The monastery had wide trade in the 15th to 17th centuries and was used as a fortress to protect Russia's nobility during the Times of Troubles.\n\nDay 4\n\nKizhi: Open-air museum of wooden architecture, interactive program “Music of Northern Village”\n\nKizhi Island: Via the Volga Baltic Canal, our cruise takes us to the tiny island of Kizhi, located at the northern end of Lake Onega. The island is renowned for its open-air Museum of Architecture, which is assembled from over 80 monuments of wooden architecture from various areas of the country and restored to form a glimpse of the past. The most impressive site on the island is the Church of the Transfiguration or Preobrazhenskaya (the church of twenty-two wooden domes). This masterpiece of architecture, featuring five tiers of 22 domes, was built in 1714 without the use of a single nail, only an axe and pine trees. The church magically changes color as the day grows old, it is certainly one of the most interesting things you will see during your time in Russia.\n\nDay 5\n\nMandrogui: Walking tour “Acquaintance with the life of the Russian village”, visit to museum of vodka, picnic ashore\n\nMandrogui is really more of a living museum than a live-in village. It features a collection of old wooden houses and is geared towards showing visitors what a traditional Russian village resembled in the past. One of the features here is the Vodka Museum, which contains thousands of different brands and types of Russia's favorite pastime.\n\nDay 6\n\nValaam: Visit to the Valaam Monastery of the Transfiguration of the Savior\n\nValaam is an archipelago of about 50 islands in Ladoga Lake. It is also the largest island in the area of Karelia, at one time belonging to Sweden. In the period of 1811-1917 the island belonged to the Grand Duchy of Finland, a part of the Russian Empire. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Finland received its independence. Valaam was one of the few holy places that was not destroyed and closed. After the war between the Soviet Union and Finland, Valaam was returned to the USSR. Valaam is famous for the Valaam Monastery as well as for numerous sketes. A skete is the place where monks live keeping much stricter rules than in monasteries. On Valaam, many monks who were searching for salvation through renunciation of the world, would move from monasteries to sketes, and later become hermits. By the beginning of the 20th century, there were 13 sketes and numerous hermitages with their churches and chapels throughout the islands.\n\nDay 7\n\nSt. Petersburg: Bus city tour, lunch in the city, visit to Peterhof (Grand Palace + Lower Park), night pass under the bridges from Utkina Zavod pier to the English Embankment\n\nSt. Petersburg is Russia's second largest and second most important city - the Northern capital of the country, Russia's cultural center, and considered the world's 'Northern Venice' due to its extensive system of canals and islands. Walk along Nevsky Prospect and experience the grandeur of pre-revolutionary imperial Russia. Pass palaces from the past and gaze at the famous embankment of the Neva River with its numerous bridges and striking architecture. St. Petersburg is also home to Russia's largest and busiest port and with its many world class theaters and museums has a very high level of cultural life.\n\nDay 8\n\nSt. Petersburg: Disembarkation after breakfast\n\nPrices and Terms\n\nThis cruise is currently not available.
