The 6-deck newbuilds (sisterships Mustai Karim and Pyotr Velikiy/Пётр Великий) were both designed and constructed in Russia. Vessel's scheduled launch is in May 2020. This new-design Russian riverboat (Project PV300, sea-and-river vessel) is currently under construction at Shipyard Krasnoye Sormovo (Nizhny Novgorod Russia).\n\nThe cruise vessel is named after Mustai Karim (Mustafa Safich Karimov Bashkir / 1919-2005).

Under this agreement, the vessel was built by Krasnoye Sormovo Shipyard (part of USC/United Shipbuilding Corporation) and scheduled for delivery to the customer Goznak-Leasing and the consignee Vodohod on July 10, 2020 (previously for February 1). Vessel's construction started with the keel-laying ceremony on March 28, 2017. In August 2016, at Lotos Shipyard (fully-owned by USC/United Shipbuilding Corporation) in Astrakhan Russia started the construction of the sistership Pyotr Velikiy.\n\nThe PV300 shipbuilding project (management firm MNP Group) stated that these ships can be operated in waterways with waves up to 3 m (10 ft) high, which allows them to operate on Russia's largest inland waterways (rivers and large lakes, like Volga, Neva, Don, Onega, Ladoga), as well as on The Black Sea, Azov Sea, and the Caspian Sea.\n\nDesigned by Marine Engineering Bureau, the liner Mustai Karim is the second (within the PV300 project) built at Russian shipyards - following Pyotr Velikiy. With optional 5 more such units, with the PV300 ships, VODOHOD targets both Russian and foreign customers who consider river cruises in Russia among the best value-for-money travel vacation alternatives in Europe. These premium leisure ships feature modern design and implement the latest marine technologies developed for passenger ships. They also provide top-luxury hotel amenities, the highest level of comfort, and superior services (both onboard and ashore).\n\nOn August 13, 2019, the cruise liner Mustai Karim was moved out of the shipyard's building hall after all the hull works were completed. Followed the launch (float-out from drydock) on September 11. Sea trials were successfully carried out on November 15-20, conducted in Gorky Reservoir (near the town Chkalovsk, region Nizhny Novgorod).\n\nRussian cruise ship Project PV300VD\n\nIn August 2016, the \"Lotos\" plant in Astrakhan started the construction of the first Russia-made cruise liner for the past 60 years. It is expected to construct 2 more same-design vessels, following the scheme PV300.\n\nThe new Mustai Karim ship has maritime class \"river-sea\" (река-море) and 5-star level of luxury and comfort. The RSCM (River Shipping Company of Moscow) and affiliated company Mosturflot took part in the development of the vessel's technical plan. \"Mosturflot\" is the first company to operate the newbuild, featuring the following main characteristics: LOA length 141 m (463 ft), max-width/beam 16,8 m (55 ft), height 16, 2 m (53 ft), max draught 3,2 m (11 ft), passenger capacity 300+, endurance 15 days (fuel) and 10 days (total supplies).\n\nThe PV300VD project was developed by Marine Engineering Bureau (Морское Инженерное Бюро in Odessa) in the period 2010-2015. The project was ordered by Russia's \"Federal Agency for Sea and Inland Water Transport\".\n\nShipbuilder Krasnoye Sormovo\n\nKrasnoye Sormovo Shipyard is one of the Soviet Union's (USSR's) oldest shipbuilding factories. The yard is located in Sormovsk (city district of Nizhny Novgorod). The shipyard was founded in 1849 by the companies \"Nizhny Novgorod Machine Factory\" and \"Volga Steam Navigation\".\n\nThe shipbuilder started construction of solid metal steamers (steam-powered ships) in 1851 and 3 years later developed screw schooners production. In 1858, Nizhny Novgorod Machine Factory (yeard's original mane) produced Russia's first steam dredger. The first Russian 2-decked steamship (Perevorot) was constructed at the yard in 1871. In 1913, it produced Danilikha - a dry bulk cargo steamship. The factory-built a total of 489 steam-powered vessels in the period 1849-1918. It also produced carriages, steam engines, steam locomotives, bridges, tramcars, diesel engines, pontoons, even cannons, and projectiles.\n\nDuring the Russian Civil War (1918-1920), Nizhny Novgorod Machine Factory constructed armored carriages, armored trains, and various weapons for ships of the Volga Military Flotilla. During World War 2 (the period between 1941-1945), the renamed shipbuilder Krasnoye Sormovo Factory constructed T-34 tanks. After the war, it switched to large-block and sectional construction of vessels - (ocean and river ships, oil tankers, river dredgers). Krasnoye Sormovo was among USSR's most innovative factories.\n\nNote: You can see the CruiseMapper's list of all river cruise ships and riverboats in the \"itinerary\" section of our River Cruises hub.
