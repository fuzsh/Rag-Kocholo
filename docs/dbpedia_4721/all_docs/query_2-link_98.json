        "text": "April 2, 2012\n\nThe Ministry of Emergencies issued a unified register of tourist itineraries\n\nThe Ministry of Emergencies of the Russian Federation issued for the first time a unified register of tourist itineraries for seven federal districts of the country, excluding the Central one. According to the joint results with the Federal Tourism Agency, the unified register of tourist itineraries is composed of the registers developed in the National Emergency Management Center.\n\nThe register includes information not only about title, type and length of a tourist itinerary, but also a passage time, a level of complexity, as well as data about dangers on the way.\n\nMarch 27, 2012\n\nProtection fund for Russians abroad in case of tour operators bankruptcy\n\nThe fund for consumer right protection in the sphere of tourism will be established soon in Russia. It will provide observance of Russian citizens rights abroad in case of operators bankruptcy, said the director of the International Cooperation and Tourism Department of the Andrey Gavrilov.\n\nAccording to his words, the means of the fund will be directed to tourists urgent transportation in case of tour operators inability to pay, as well as to pay for accommodation in a hotel, if a tour operator doesnt perform the commitments. He stated that the fund will be created at the expense of tour operators. The Ministry of Sports, Tourism and Youth Policy proposes to establish a fee of 0.5% from the volume of realized tourist production, but the mechanism of establishing and legal form of the fund are still being worked out.\n\nMarch 19, 2012\n\nThe Transport Ministry of Russia will issue a list of river ports open for foreign yachts by the end of April\n\nUntil the end of April 2012 the Transport Ministry of Russia will approve the list of rivers ports open for foreign leisure and sport boats, as well as rules of navigation on the inland water ways (IWW) of Russia. It was stated by the Deputy Transport Minister Viktor Olersky in the course of the board meeting of the Federal Marine and River Transport Agency at Friday.\n\nAccording to the amendment to the article 23 of the Inland Water Transport Code of the Russian Federation, the inland water ways of Russia are open for foreign leisure and sport boats without need to issue special decrees for each particular vessel, as it used to be before.\n\nAs was said by Olersky, the navigation season is to begin soon, by that time well have all the documents for foreign vessels. We believe that it may raise attractiveness of our inland water ways. However several years should go by so we could see the result.\n\nMarch 19, 2012\n\nThe Transport Ministry of Russia will issue a list of river ports open for foreign yachts by the end of April\n\nUntil the end of April 2012 the Transport Ministry of Russia will approve the list of rivers ports open for foreign leisure and sport boats, as well as rules of navigation on the inland water ways (IWW) of Russia. It was stated by the Deputy Transport Minister Viktor Olersky in the course of the board meeting of the Federal Marine and River Transport Agency at Friday.\n\nAccording to the amendment to the article 23 of the Inland Water Transport Code of the Russian Federation, the inland water ways of Russia are open for foreign leisure and sport boats without need to issue special decrees for each particular vessel, as it used to be before.\n\nAs was said by Olersky, the navigation season is to begin soon, by that time well have all the documents for foreign vessels. We believe that it may raise attractiveness of our inland water ways. However several years should go by so we could see the result.\n\nMarch 12, 2012\n\nMedvedev issued an order to minimize financial risks of tourism investments in the North Caucasus region\n\nThe President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev issued an order to the government to minimize financial risks of tourism investments in the North Caucasus region by means of government guarantees. Medvedev expressed gratitude to Russian and foreign investors who accepted quite serious obligations and started their works on the South of Russia.\n\nMarch 6, 2012\n\nExhaustion of cruise motor ships in Russia reaches 75%\n\n«There are 128 cruise motor ships in the Russian rivers, the average age of which is 45 years and the exhaustion exceeds 75%», - reported a representative of the National Emergency Management Center of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia.\n\nHe also added that the major part of such vessels (86%) was constructed abroad in a period of 1950-1990. According to the data of the agency, there are more than 31 thousand multi-purpose vessels in the Russian inland water ways, 2.5 thousand of which are cargo vessels and over 2 thousand  are commercial ones.\n\nThe largest cruise disaster in Russia over the last years has happened last summer in Tatarstan. Constructed in 1955 in Czechoslovakia, the double-decked diesel-electric ship called Bulgaria has sunk during the storm in the Kuybyshev Reservoir on 10th of July. There were 201 persons aboard at the moment of the shipwreck, 122 of which died.\n\nMarch 2, 2012\n\nNew rules of sea access into Finland for Russian tourists came into force\n\nNew visa regulations for Russian sea tourists in Finland are being introduced from 1st March 2012. They restrict possibilities of cruise ferries tourists what may cause reduction of the passenger traffic.\n\nNow Russian citizens who arrive in Helsinki on ferry and get a mark of a Shengen border control have to stand one more time in a passport control queue to get a departure mark when they leave the EU. This decision is contradictory to the rules of the Schengen agreement, as passengers stay on the territory of the EU. Upon arrival to Stockholm and Tallinn Russians will go through a passport control one more time. Thus the owners of a single entry visa will have to choose only one port of destination where to go ashore.\n\nIt should be stated that foreign cruise tourists have an opportunity of visa-free visit to Russia for a period of up to 3 days (72 hours).\n\nMarch 1, 2012\n\nA strategy of help for Russian tourists abroad is developed\n\nThe Russian Federal Agency for Tourism (Rosturism) and the Federal Bio-Medical Agency (FBMA) of Russia have reached a decision to cooperate of medical aid to Russian tourists abroad. The heads of the both agencies are sure that from now on in case of emergencies they wont have to work with our fellow citizens on holidays in emergency mode.\n\nA certain operation scheme is described in the document if our tourists have health problems (both abroad and on the territory of our country). The agreement provides procedures for emergency transportation of sick people by air medical service, actions in emergencies and information provision for citizens.\n\nThe Head of the FMBA Vladimir Uyba said at the signing ceremony: This document is important not for being limiting or containing letters of intent. Its a detailed document with an operation scheme for cases when a person gets in a difficult situation while on holiday.\n\nVladimir Uyba also gave examples of situations when a host country requires that an injured person should be urgently transported back home, but Russian medics believe a patient to be untransportable. Or in a reverse situation: a patient is able to return in Russia and get medical help, but he is being kept in a foreign hospital and told to be untransportable. Afterwards such tourists often get huge invoices.\n\nTo prevent these situations its important to control both a sort of medical help being rendered to our tourists, and pricing policy of this sphere, because a tourist insurance is unlikely to cover treatment expenses. And sometimes tourists even appear to be uninsured.\n\nWe need to cooperate closely with insurance companies, - stated Radkov. In his opinion, amendments in the act about insurance should affect positively this issue. According to these amendments, the current sum of medical insurance (US$ 15 000) is not enough. It must be at least US$ 30 000. But in case of extreme tourism, it must be even higher.\n\nFebruary 6, 2012\n\nInvestments in tourism development in the North Caucasus will exceed 600 billion rubles\n\nThis was announced by presidential envoy in the North Caucasian Federal District, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin at the meeting on Friday with the Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.\n\nKhloponin noted that in the frames of this project will be build 1,100 km of slopes, 227 ski lifts, hotels for more than 100,000 people.\n\nAccording to the deputy prime minister directly in the project more than 100,000 people will be employed, and taking into account the jobs that will open in areas related to small and medium businesses - more than 300,000 jobs.\n\nFebruary 1, 2012\n\nAmendments to the Law on tourism will strengthen control over tour operators\n\nThe State Duma promised to accelerate the adoption of amendments to the Law on Tourism, which are designed to prevent situations like the crisis around \"Lanta-Tour.\" This was announced on Tuesday, January 31, by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Economic Policy, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Igor Rudensky, commenting on coming now offers from the expert community in this area.\n\nCurrently, in the State Duma there is the law, which seriously correct active standards in the field of tourism, in November its second reading was deferred to a later date. He pointed out that the main story of the first reading of the document states that \"travel agencies may operate only on behalf of tour operators.\" In addition, he said, \"now the classification of objects of tourist industry is introducing, it will improve service quality of travel agencies.\" As a result, \"the equality of requirements will be achieved throughout the Russian Federation.\" \"All of the amendments (in the draft of the bill) will strengthen the control of tour operators, it will enable our citizens to feel more secure,\" - said the head of the committee.\n\nThe idea to establish a fund to assist tourists Rudensky described as \"good\", but, he says, \"at the legislative level, most likely, we can solve all problems without its inception.\"\n\nJanuary 31, 2012\n\nTour operators are not ready to invest in the emergency fund for tourists who are in emergency situation, prior to the introduction of legislative norms\n\nThis was announced on January, 31 by the executive director of the Association of Tour Operators of Russia (ATOR) Maia Lomidze.\n\n\"The market is not ready to create such funds without the mandatory rules in the law. There should be strict regulations on the proper use of the fund. ATOR is ready to create such a fund only in the self-regulatory organization, so we will instruct on an amendment to the law on the introduction of self-regulation in tourism\", - she said.\n\nThis question appears on the January 31 meeting, to which the Ministry of Sport, Tourism and Youth Policy has caused the heads of major Russian tour operators. Its main theme was the suspension of one of the largest and oldest Russian tour operators - \"Lanta-Tour\".\n\nJanuary 25, 2012\n\nIn 2013 a global code of tourists rights protection will enter into force\n\nThe World Tourism Organization is currently developing a code of tourists rights protection. This is the first convention of the World Tourism Organization, which will be transboundary in nature and will apply to all travelers of States that acceded to it. Ratification of this convention is planned for 2013.\n\nThe Federal Agency for tourism is an active member of the working group. \"We are preparing our own proposals in the light of the Russian experience\", Deputy Head of Federal Agency for Tourism (Rosturizm) Eugene Pisarevskii said.\n\n\"Events with cruise ship Costa Concordia showed that Russian tourists increasingly entering into deals with foreign tour operators, bypassing domestic ones. In this regard, for such individuals the question of protection of their rights raises. In particular, what law should be applied in this case\", he stressed.\n\nJanuary 12, 2012\n\nIn the seaport of Sochi a system of double customs corridor began to operate\n\nThe double corridor system began working at the checkpoints of Sochi Customs in the Port of Sochi, on the border with Abkhazia. The main objective of innovation - the simplification and acceleration of customs procedures with respect to individuals.\n\nThe double corridor system provides an independent choice by an individual, crossing the customs border, the customs declaration in writing items for personal use and selection of \"green\" or \"red\" corridor, depending on the presence or absence of the goods subject to written declaration. The movement to \"green\" corridor implies the absence of human goods, mandatory for written declaration.\n\nSochi customs has a positive experience with this system: the \"green\" and \"red\" corridors are functioning successfully at the international airport of Sochi from September 2001.\n\nApplication of the system in the international terminal of Sochi sea port is dictated by the increase in dynamics of arriving cruise ships and aliens.\n\nDecember 27, 2011\n\nEco-tourism is being developed in Sochi\n\nIn preparation for the Olympics 2014 in Sochi, recreational facilities are being remodeled and upgraded.\n\n\"In Sochi, a functional working group\"Ecology\" is created, the city administration of Sochi said. This group brought together experts of profile departments of administration, representatives of the Organising Committee \"Sochi-2014\", National Park, the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, the Geographical Society and tourism companies.\n\n\"The time-schedule of activities for the development of eco-tourism, providing efficient use of Olympic facilities and infrastructure is established in after Olympics period\", it was noted in the city administration.\n\nThe time-schedule of ecotourism development includes \"reconstruction and modernization of existing recreational facilities Sochi, water tourism, and even the introduction of new environmental programs in the school curriculum\".\n\n\"A separate item in the plan is to create a new environmental Sochi routes for family, extreme and other types of recreation with a detailed description of attractions, centers of recreation, meals, overnight stays. All this will contribute to the development of ecological tourism in Sochi at the international level\", the city administration stressed.\n\nDecember 13, 2011\n\nThe UNO is to evaluate opportunities for the cruise tourism development in Caspian Sea Region\n\nThe UNO together with the Azerbaijan, Iranian, Kazakh, Turkmenian and Russian governments and with the British experts prepares a preliminary estimate of opportunities for the cruise tourism development in the Caspian Sea Region. Mr. Robert Kleverdon (UK), the UNO legation expert, visited the region to evaluate its potential.\n\nThe purpose of the mission is to prepare an overall review and to estimate the existing cruise tourism in the Caspian Sea Region, supported by the national tourism administrations, and to develop a regional development strategy. Mr.Kleverdon should have visited Astrakhan branch of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise \"Rosmorport\", CJSC \"Commercial Sea Port of Olya\", and he should meet with the representatives of the region.\n\nNovember 22, 2011\n\nThe head of the Russian Federal Agency for Tourism told about the problems in Russian tourism industry\n\nThe Head of the Russian Federal Agency for Tourism (Rostourism) Alexander Radkov told about the federal program concerning rebranding of Russia and attraction of foreign people in our country.\n\nThe main problem is poor infrastructure. In the capitals there are a lot of hotels and tourist centers, but in regions it is acute problem, - Alexander Radkov said. In addition, transportation costs and logistics in general are also in bad condition. Till the travel price is up to 70% of tour, the foreign people wont visit Russia.\n\nRadkov also paid attention to manpower policy in this industry. He recognized that over last 20 years the quantity of specialists in service reduced.\n\nTourism business has the staff shortage, because this activity sidelined. To correct the situation it is necessary to develop training courses and to establish training centers together with travel agencies, - he thought.\n\nTo improve the service, tour operators were offered to cooperate more actively with each other in staff training, and send their specialists abroad on the probation for further training.\n\nTo attract the foreign tourists, the Rostourism suggests, firstly, to create additional travel agencies which will deal with inbound tourism; secondly, to promote and to support small- and medium-sized enterprises, participating in the reception of foreign tourists. Among the measures, taken by the state, the Rostourisms representative called government program on tourist attraction development. It supposed a more active advertising policy and development of tourist centers all over Russia.\n\nNovember 14, 2011\n\nBoundless horizons of cruise tourism\n\nIn Russian domestic tourism structure sea and river cruises make only 3%. It indicates about unrealized development potential of this industry.\n\nWater tourism development issues are reflected in the resolution of the III International Conference \"Maritime Tourism\" within the framework \"United Russia\" Party Project \"Saint-Petersburg - the sea capital of Russia.\"\n\nAs Arthur Chilingarov, the Project Coordinator and Member of the Party Supreme Council, said - \"some resolution clauses are already reflected in the Federal Law \"About Amendment of Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation in Connection with the State Support of Shipbuilding and Navigation, signed by Russian President. «In particular, the law granted significant tax incentives to Russian building companies. In addition, the federal law \"About Obligatory Insurance of Career Civil Liability for Injury to Passengers\" is at the final approval stage in the State Duma. The necessity of the document adoption is emphasized in the resolution of our conference\".\n\nRemind, the conference was held this July. It was attended by the representatives from federal and regional authorities, by 350 delegates from 34 regions of the country. The foreign countries were represented by the Great Britain, Germany, Switzerland, Finland, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Azerbaijan, Ukraine and Romania.\n\nThe event was also attended by leading Russian and international travel agencies, shipbuilders, ship owners, by the representatives from companies which produce equipment and infrastructure for the industry, by independent experts and scientists. Work on the resolution took a long time, because the participants identified a wide range of problems and sent a lot of suggestions of their solution to the conference organizers.\n\nHaving discussed the most important issues of the tourism industry, conference participants noted the positive changes in Russian legislation. In particular, the Russian Government approved the concept of the federal target program \"Domestic and Entrance Tourism Development in the Russian Federation (2010-2016 years)\", where sea and river tourism development issues are reflected.\n\nOne of the important regulatory innovation was the adoption of amendments to the Inland Water Transport Code of the Russian Federation in 2011. The Russian inland waterways opening for freight ships (in sports, cultural and recreational purposes) gives a significant impulse not only for the tourism development, but also for infrastructure construction.\n\nConference participants appealed to the \"United Russia\" Party leadership to support the number of initiatives aimed at water tourism development at the federal level.\n\nThe Russian Government was proposed to provide Russian tour operators with new cruise ships at the federal level and include this topic in the federal target program \"River cruise tourism Development in the Russian Federation\". There are several schemes which are more topical from point of experts view:\n\n- equity state participation in ships building and farming them to tour operators with the right to buy back them;\n\n- a scheme based on public-private partnership, where the state takes part in the design and construction of tourist cruise ships, in the establishment of leasing companies, in the mechanism development for compensation of a part of lease payments from the federal budget.\n\nTransport Ministry of the Russian Federation together with Economic Development Ministry and the Natural Resources and Environment Ministry were advised to consider reducing the land rents to install berths, gas stations and arrangement of green parking, as well as simplify the process for registration of water management.\n\nIn order to promote tourism activities in the regions the Project experts propose to include Murmansk, Arkhangelsk and Onega ports in the \"List of ports through which the foreign citizens and stateless persons, arriving in order to travel by ferries with permission to passengers' transportation, can enter into the Russian Federation. It was approved by the Russian Government resolution of 07.05.2009, ¹ 397.\n\nThe resolution authors recommend to Sport, Tourism and Youth Policy Ministry to develop a project of national standard for the types of boating and state standard specification \"Travel Services. River cruises. \"\n\nA large number of proposals is addressed to the Regional Development Ministry, and they concern the development of infrastructural facilities in the regions. Thus, representatives from Tatarstan Republic took the initiative to create clusters of river cruise tourism in the regions, including the design, construction, reconstruction, repair of cruise ships, the coastal infrastructure development, and training. As a pilot region, they offer their own republic, where there are all necessary conditions and resources: Zelenodolsk design bureau, Zelenodolsk Plant named after A.M. Gorky, shipyards in the Kama mouth and Chistopol, Kazan Branch of Water Transport Academy and Zelenodolsk Shipbuilding College.\n\nThe Regional Development Ministry together with the Transport Ministry were recommended to develop the project documentation and to implement dredging and shore protection works, reconstruction or construction of berths, engineering and transport infrastructure networks development in some federal subjects. Among the regions where there are cruise centers, needed such works are called: Nizhny Novgorod Region, Krasnoyarsk Region, Moscow Region, Vologda Region, and Yaroslavl Region.\n\nTo realize the tourist potential of the Lake Baikal it is proposed to give the international status to the airport of Ulan-Ude City. It is necessary to fulfill scheduled international flights and to increase the tourist flow to Lake Baikal. At the same time it is necessary to establish a special ecological fleet of waste collection and recycling on the lake.\n\nThe Conference Resolution is studied attentively by the \"United Russia\" Party leadership. A number of appeals to the executive and legislative authorities, containing specific solutions of the identified problems, is prepared.\n\nNovember 10, 2011\n\nTourism under the Northern Lights\n\nWithin the framework of interior entrance tourism development program in Komi Republic for 2010-2012 some unique travel routes, not having analogues in Russia, are already used and some of them are prepared for launching.\n\nIn Syktyvkar there was meeting, devoted to the tourism development, where the UNITED RUSSIA Party regional project coordinator St.Petersburg  the sea capital of Russia, Deputy Komi Republic Head Alexander Burov was present.\n\nAfter the meeting Alexander Burov told about innovation tourist technologies and travel routes in Komi Republic.\n\nRecently our region attracted basically tourists, loving extreme sports, who drifted on numerous local rivers. But in Komi Republic there are many things which will be interesting not only for Russian, but also for foreign tourists, who are not inclined to the extreme. It is say enough that in the Republic there are such world tourist brands as the Northern Lights and one of seven wonders of Russia - giant weathering columns on Manjpupuner plateau (Small Mountain of idols), which took the 5th place in the contest Seven Wonders of Russia. But the climatic and natural conditions of Komi Republic make impossible attraction of many tourists. Thats why during travel routes development we use innovation technologies. We try to employ foreign know-how, adapted to our conditions, or attract unique audience, who can be interested in our routes and objects.\n\nFor example, in many European countries the railway tourism is widespread. This year in commemoration of the 90th anniversary of Komi Republic we launched tourist train Shining of the North. It consists of two comfortable wagons for tourists, assembled on the government order, and wagon-restaurant. The sense is that Russian and foreign tourists can go in exotic journey in Komi Republic directly from Moscow. Passing through Mosow, Yaroslavl, Arkhangelsk and Vologda Regions they can stop and see local sights. In our republic tourists can visit different places such as national park Ugyd va or Pechoro-Ilychsky sanctuary. Wagon-lit is attached to the regular train; therefore it is unnecessary to make a transfer. At tourists will hunting, fishing and deer team riding can be included in the tour program.\n\nAs for travel routes, attracting unique audience, first of all, we should pay attention to water cruise By Old Believer steps, which will be available for tourists since 2012. In Russia and in CIS states about 1000000 old believers live. I think, many of them will want to make a pilgrimage to the execution place of famous old believer, the archpriest Awakum, and to see by their own eyes other saint places. But cruise by Pechora river will be interesting not only for old believers, - Alexander Burov said, - for this program the comfortable motorship was freight and in Pechora City the hotel will be built.\n\nIn 2012 people, who are interested in particular extreme, can visit museum of Vorkuta camp, which was a part of the GULAG system. If we remember popularity of museum in St.Petersburg prison Crosses, I consider that there will be enough those who will desire to be in historical and memorial complex Vorkutlag.\n\nAs for one of the main republic sights  unique monument of nature  giant columns on Manjpupuner plateau, which were objects of Mansi cult, the tourists can achieve them not only by means of helicopter.\n\nThere are some travel routes, supposing flight up to Syktyvkar, then trip by train up to Troitsk-Pechorsk, next ascent on boat, and finally way by foot up to plateau. I dont consider these routes to be extreme. It takes maximum 2 nights in tents, rest of time is in way - stops in comfortable hotels and guest houses. On the other hand, you can see yourself a wonder of the world, which millions of people saw only on the pictures, and others dont know about it at all.\n\nAs the UNITED RUSSIA Party regional project coordinator St.Petersburg  the sea capital of Russia and as Deputy Komi Republic Head I believe that our region has a large tourist potential and we will develop it  Alexander Burov emphasized.\n\nNovember 10, 2011\n\nAltai came to world markets\n\nThe Altai Republic has continued to attract foreign tourists, where the emphasis is not on the nearby China, but on the accustomed to a high level of tourist service visitors from Western Europe.\n\nFor the first time the region was presented at the World Travel Market (WTM), that was held in London from 7 to 10 of November and considered one of the most prestigious and largest travel forums in the world.\n\nIn what way the Altai Republic is going to attract sophisticated Western tourists was told by the regional coordinator of the \"United Russia\" Party Project \"Saint-Petersburg - the Sea Capital of Russia\" First Deputy Prime Minister of Altai Republic Sergei Tevonyan.\n\n\"First of all, our exposition is intended to pass the unique flavor of Gorny Altai. Our republic has unique brands that can attract the most sophisticated tourist gourmet. Its enough to mention the Altai honey, which is usually served at the table of the British Queen. Or unique medicinal properties of antlers of deer, which lead to the rejuvenation of the body and the healing of many diseases. Well, of course, our delegation will present priority tourism investment projects of the Altai Republic. Among them: the development of water tourism, creation of special economic zone of tourist-recreational type \"Altay Valley\" and all-season ski resort \"Manzherok\".\n\nAt WTM our republic presents its tourist potential in a single stand of Russia, which will locate on more than 500 square meters. We have chosen this platform to promote our tourist product not accidentally. Since 1980 WTM is considered to be the most important event in the world tourism industry. The event takes place in one of the key venues of modern British capital ExCel and annually attracts 40,000 professionals.\n\nI believe that participation in these high-status events will significantly increase the flow of foreign tourists in the Republic\", Sergey Tevonyan said.\n\nLet us recall the flow of Russian and foreign tourists visiting the Republic, in 2008, was more than 1 million people and has since been growing annually by nearly 100 thousand people a year. The country has over 190 hotels, tourist camps and campgrounds, offering visitors more than 9 thousand bed-places. The target program \"The long-term territorial organization and development of domestic tourism in the Altai Republic in 2011 - 2016 years\" is adopted. The amount of funding originally built into the program is 23 billion rubles. Moreover, it is planned to attract more than 14.5 billion rubles from extra-budgetary sources.\n\nAmong the main areas of the tourism industry in the Republic are eco-tourism, skiing and water tourism. Water tourism is developing in the Altai Mountains because of the unique lakes. Teletskoye lake is the most popular among tourists. Almost all of the boarding houses, tourist camps and campgrounds located over there offering excursions on boats and yachts. In all more than 500 vessels service tourist on lakes and rivers of the Republic.\n\nOctober 28, 2011\n\nThe authorities of the Krasnodar region are beginning to develop sea cruise tourism\n\nThe authorities of the Krasnodar region are now beginning to develop sea tourism actively due to changes in legislation on ships and on the possibility of cruise ships call in ports of the country. It was declared by the Head of the regional Department of complex development of resorts and tourism Eugene Kudelya.\n\nAccording to him, we are talking about the construction of several moorages on the Black Sea coast.\n\n\"Now we discuss the mechanism of experience exchange with the two most advanced countries in this regard: France and Turkey. How to create sea infrastructure for a short time in the province. This is very promising area, and most importantly it is profitable\", he said.\n\nOctober 4, 2011\n\nFederal Agency for Tourism begins rebranding of Russia\n\nFederal Agency for Tourism begins rebranding of Russia as a tourist destination.\n\nCampaign to promote Russia as a country that is favorable for tourism, will take place within the framework of the federal target program \"Development of domestic and inbound tourism in Russia\" from 2011 to 2018 in the international and domestic markets.\n\nAccording to the Head of Federal Agency for Tourism Alexander Radkov 2.47 billion rubles is allocated to promote the tourist product.\n\nThese funds will be invested in advertising umbrella brand of the country and its regions in all major areas, including outdoor advertising, radio, television, press tours, conferences, as well as upgrading the Internet portal of Federal Agency for Tourism.\n\nAccording to Alexander Radkov, for the further development of tourism in Russia it is necessary to improve transport infrastructure and accessibility of the sites, raise the level of tourist services, the availability of qualified personnel and effective advertising.\n\nAccording to the World Tourism Organization, now tourism is directly or indirectly provides 3-5% of global GDP, RATA-news states.\n\nSeptember 27, 2011\n\nTourist-recreational SEZ will appear in Primorye\n\nThe working out of the concept of creation and development of tourist-recreational special economic zone on the Russian island has started in Primorye.\n\nMajor international companies will be engaged in the work at the project. In particular, MasterConsult Services (Singapore), specializing in tourism development strategies, analysis of the international tourist market. In order to work out alternative development concept for the Russian island and strategic master plan its planned to invite an international consultant on urban development of the AREP company Nicolas Bouchaud (France), Chapter Development Council of Barcelona city infrastructure Jose Asebilio (Spain), as well as one of the leading architectural firms of China ETOPIA.\n\nThe concept will be implemented in two phases. The first one is the preparation of the concept of training and development of tourist-recreational special economic zone in the Russian island (analytics), the second - the development of architectural and construction concepts (architectural and planning materials).\n\nLet us recall the decision on the establishment on the island of Russian of special economic zone of tourist-recreational type was signed by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in March 2010. The island of Russian has special opportunities to attract tourists - in 2012 there will be the APEC summit.\n\nSeptember 26, 2011\n\nThe MORFEST is on the top of the student wave!\n\nThe V Interuniversity Sea Festival Cruise, devoted to M.V. Lomonosovs 300th anniversary, went from Saint-Petersburg to Moscow.\n\nThe 2d stage of the MORFEST-2011 started in Saint-Petersburg. The extensive educational and cultural programs will be presented to the best sea universities students on the ship board.\n\nArthur Chilingarov, Saint-Petersburg - sea capital of Russia project coordinator, said that the project supported the MORFEST interuniversity festival. According to his words this event, gathered the students and teachers more than from 40 Russian regions on the Neva side this year, is a good youth area to popularize Saint-Petersburg as the Russian sea capital and as the biggest scientific and educational sea training centre. Besides, the festival promotes pupil and student creativity discovery.\n\nThe I Interuniversity Festival, devoted to 300th of Saint-Petersburg, was held in 2003 on Saint-Petersburg State Sea Technical University and Sea Education Fund initiative.\n\nThe festival program includes 5 Scientific and Practical Conferences:\n\n- M.V.Lomonosovs Heritage in Education, Science and Art;\n\n- Students Education. Innovations and Realities;\n\n- Scientific Educational Ecological and Water Tourism Development Prospects;\n\n- Baltic Equator (legal, technical and humanitarian aspects of sea activity safety in Baltic Region).\n\nIt is interesting, but the ecological, training and boating issues are subjects of three annual conferences of Saint-Petersburg is Russian sea capital project. It means a particular importance and urgency of chosen problems. So, modern students, gathered in the MORFEST can become the professional project participants in the future.\n\nSeptember 23, 2011\n\nIt is planned to create a tourist zone in the Rostov region\n\nIn the Aksai district of Rostov region it is planned to create a tourist zone worth about 2 billion rubles.\n\nInvestment project will be implemented within the framework of the federal target program \"Development of domestic and inbound tourism in the Russian Federation in 2011-2018 years\".\n\nTourist Zone with total area of 57 hectares will be located near the town of Aksai. It is planned to build all-season ski resort, a hotel of 500 seats, all-season water park and roadside service more than one thousand jobs will be created. Completion of work is scheduled for 2016.\n\nImplementation of the project aims to develop the tourist complex area, the creation of civilized environment for tourists, the organization of family and active leisure.\n\nExpected number of visitors of the resort that want to stay in a hotel will reach 80 thousand persons. The number of day visitors will be more than 1 million people a year.\n\nSeptember 02, 2011\n\nTo ancient Rus by cruise ship\n\nThe Novgorod region in 2012-2013 is going to become one of the largest centers of the cruise boating\n\nIn Novgorod, September, 2 a meeting devoted to development of water tourism was held chaired by the regional coordinator of the \"United Russia\" Party Project \"Saint-Petersburg - the Sea Capital of Russia\", the deputy head of the Novgorod Region Administration Alexander Smirnov.\n\nAs the result Alexander Smirnov told about what has been achieved and the prospects of work in this area. According to him this year the administration of the Novgorod region has begun to develop a regional program of boating. This was preceded by research. Experts of St. Petersburg State University of Water Communications came to the conclusion that it is tourism is the most perspective direction of development of inland waterway transport in the region.\n\nAt the beginning of 2011 in the area considerable experience in this field have already gained. Cruises to Novgorod from both Russian capitals by tour operators in Moscow and St. Petersburg with the participation of the regional administration were organized. Arriving in Novgorod tourists get acquainted with local attractions on tours and recreational craft \"MO-28\", \"Veche\", \"Yalta\", \"Sadko\", \"Moscow-101», «Viktor» and motor-sailer vessel \"Varyag\" stylized Slavic boat of X century.\n\nThe regional administration is developing new tourist routes. For example, last year it was opened a sightseeing tour \"Where have gone the Russian land\" with a visit to Rurik settlement, and in May of this year excursion trip took place from Vologda to Novgorod on the ship \"Nikolay Yakovlev\".\n\n\"But compared with what is necessary to organize - this is just a drop in the ocean. Everyone knows how popular among Russian and foreign tourists cruise to Valaam, Kizhi, other tourist and pilgrimage routes of Lake Ladoga are, Alexander Smirnov said. There is no doubt that the cruise tours to this beautiful center of ancient Russia, as Veliky Novgorod, will be very popular. Furthermore the region has not only unique historical monuments, but also developed tourist infrastructure. This is hotels, camping, camp sites (a total of 72 objects), the total number of rooms which is more than 6,000 seats. In the year they take more than 280 000 tourists, only 25 000 of which are foreigners. In 2011 in the Novgorod region construction and commissioning of new tourist facilities. Total investment cost of construction is 4.4 billion rubles, as a result 500 places of tourist accommodation will be brought. With the development of water cruises, we hope that the number of our guests will increase by times.\n\nNow our task is to go to new quality and quantity level of water tourism. Studies have shown that the most promising water inter-regional routes: Nizhny Novgorod - Moscow - St. Petersburg - Novgorod and back, Moscow - St. Petersburg - Novgorod, St. Petersburg - Old Ladoga - Sosninskaya Pier - Novgorod, as well as internal river routes with visits to Rurik settlement and Staraya Russa.\n\nBut in order the cruise to these directions ran at full capacity its necessary to solve some problems, including within the framework of developing regional program and with the support of the party \"United Russia\" Party Project \"Saint-Petersburg - the Sea Capital of Russia\" .\n\nNow the number of parking lots and terminals are not enough, as well as items of their refueling. There is a lack of modern vessels that meet the requirements of navigation on the inland waterways of the Novgorod region. Another serious problem is the need for dredging in some parts of the river Volkhov, the New Ladoga and Onega channels. There is a problem with the class of cruise ships that will be used for new tourist routes. For example, along route St. Petersburg  Veliky Novgorod with accordance with the rules vessels with no more than 2-2.2 meters, which should have the category of \"L-S\" (Lake-sea) can go, since the route passes through Lake Ladoga, is assigned the category S.\n\nWorking to solve these problems is already underway. Consultations are underway to amend the regulations of the Volkhov hydroelectric station to maintain the hydrological regime of the Volkhov River, which provides depth throughout the river 2.4 meters. Specialists of St. Petersburg University of Water Communications, a preliminary estimation of dredging operation cost at the channels mentioned above. It is 1 billion rubles. Now we have to ensure works investment in this volume.\n\nWork is also underway to obtain the Ministry of Transportation permission to pass on the planned routes of various classes of ships.\n\nWe are doing our best to solve the problem fundamentally, to overcome all the restrictive barriers to the development of cruise shipping. If they are removed, in 2012-2013 already the Novgorod region will become a major center for the cruise boating \", Alexander Smirnov said.\n\nAugust 25, 2011\n\nThe Altai Republic: \"Swiss\" resort is being created in Siberia\n\nThe Altai Republic is to become one of the largest centers of domestic and international tourism.\n\nAugust 25 in Gorno-Altaisk, a meeting devoted to development of tourism and boating was held chaired by the regional coordinator of the \"United Russia\" Party Project \"Saint-Petersburg - the Sea Capital of Russia\", First Deputy Prime Minister of Altai Republic Sergei Tevonyana.\n\nSergei Tevonyan summarized the past in the Gorno-Altaisk 10th meeting of the International Coordinating Council \"Our Common Home - Altai\" and outlined the strategic directions of development of the tourism industry, which require the full support, including the Party Project.\n\nAccording to him, the jubilee meeting of the ICC \"Our Common Home - Altai\" was attended by delegations from China, Mongolia and Kazakhstan. Let us recall the border areas of these countries are included in the international zone jointed by brand name \"Great Altai\", and are interested in the development of closer inter-territorial cooperation. According to Sergei Tevonyana at the meeting of ICC priority investment projects in the Republic of Altai were discussed. Among them: the development of water tourism, creation of special economic zone of tourist-recreational type \"Altai Valley\" and all-season ski resort \"Manzherok\".\n\nIn the comments for ER.RU Sergei Tevonyan named the main priorities of its work in this area as the coordinator of the project \"United Russia\".\n\n\"The flow of Russian and foreign tourists visiting the Republic in 2008 accounts more than 1 million people and since that has been growing annually by nearly 100 thousand people per year. Our goal is to become one of the major tourist centers in Russia, Sergey Tevonyan pointed. Gorny Altai is compared to the resorts of Switzerland. We have the same unique lakes, mountain rivers, vast meadows of edelweiss and spectacular waterfalls in our republic. However, we are constantly developing tourist infrastructure. The country has more than 190 hotels, holiday camps and campgrounds, offering travelers more than 9 thousand places.\n\nA year ago the target programme \"The long-term territorial organization and development of domestic and inbound tourism in the Altai Republic in 2011 - 2016 years\" was adopted. The amount of funding originally pledged to the programme is more than 23 billion rubles. Moreover more than 14.5 billion rubles is planned to attract from extra-budgetary sources, which in itself speaks about the investment attractiveness of the region as a tourist destination. The main directions of the programme became: the creation of infrastructure for investment projects realization, improvement of safety for tourists, a massive information campaign to promote the Republic of Altai as an international tourist center. Well, of course, the expansion of tourist facilities.\n\nIf we talk about the main directions of regional tourism, one of the most important is eco-tourism. Water, hiking, climbing, caving tours are very popular among the guests of the republic. Traditionally hunting and fishing attract tourists. Also, in recent times, we are actively developing ski resorts.\n\nBoating in Altai develops because of the unique lakes of our republic. The most popular among tourists is Teletskoye lake. Almost all boarding houses, camping sites and camping of located in it offer excursions on boats and yachts. In all in lakes and rivers of the republic tourists are served by more than 500 vessels. Here are the best places for fishing.\n\nAnother unique facility is a cascade of seven Karakol lakes. In each of them the water is different in color and chemical composition. Hiking and horseback riding tours to the chain of lakes Shavlinskih tour operators often offer to complete by rafting on the river Katuni. We develop and other modern areas of boating: diving, kite surfing, kayaking and windsurfing. In the near future the further expansion of the infrastructure of tourist facilities, especially the construction of docks and piers are planned. Particular attention will be paid to the security of boating.\n\nBy 2016 we plan to expand significantly the network of tourist sites in the Altai Republic. When the activities of the programme will be successfully implemented Altai, in terms of attractiveness to tourists, will be able to compete even with such tourist mecca like Moscow, St. Petersburg and Golden Ring,\" Sergey Tevonyan said.\n\nAugust 17, 2011\n\nRussia may close two tourist-recreational zones due to the lack of investors\n\nThe Russian government may decide to close the tourist-recreational zones in the Kaliningrad region and the Stavropol region, if till the end of September there wont be any investors in these zones, the director of the Department of Special Economic Zones and Project Financing of Ministry of Economic Development Dmitry Levchenkov.\n\nAccording to him, Ministry of Economic Development has prepared a draft decree on the closure of special economic zones in the two regions. He noted that the draft resolution had been agreed upon by all departments, but in a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak it was decided to postpone this issue until the end of September and try to find investors in these zones.\n\nSo far, according to Dmitry Levchenkov, no company showed serious interest in these zones (the decision to create them was made in early 2007 - IF). Therefore, if the investors will not be attracted till the end of September, the Government will reconsider the closure of these two zones.\n\nAlso he said that another problem of tourist-recreational zone is a special economic zone in Irkutsk Region. Dmitry Levchenkov said that so far in this SEZ there are no any resident and any investor.\n\nAt the same time, he noted that the Irkutsk region administration prepared a conception for a new site and now we are working on planning of the territory near the town of Baikalsk.\n\nDmitry Levchenkov said that in principle three investors confirm their interest in the special economic zone in Irkutsk region, but they put conditions to limit emissions from \"The Baikal Pulp and Paper Mill\", namely, to transfer BPPM on a closed production cycle.\n\nIt was reported that in 2010 the government has decided to close the tourist and recreation zone in the Krasnodar region.\n\nTourist and recreational areas in Buryatia, Altai Territory, Altai Republic are currently actively developing, and an active preparatory work on the tourist-recreational zones creation on the island Russian (Vladivostok) and tourism cluster in the North Caucasus (six sites in six regions of Federation).\n\nAugust 12, 2011\n\nSummer cruise season was completed in Murmansk\n\nSummer cruise season was completed in Murmansk. City was visited by the american tourists who came by the liner «National Geographic Explorer». Moorage lasted only 6 hours.\n\nBasically, the americans arrived in Murmansk, but there are citizens of other countries - the europeans and even a married couple of Australians. During the time spent on the road, the travelers get to know each other.\n\nIn Murmansk the liner stood at the pier just a few hours. He became the ninth and the last passenger ship that visited polar capital in the summer. There have been instances and much larger, so for a while visitors have to be met at the fishing port. Theres no any infrastructure for this, because the port has other goals. But it is possible to serve ocean giant technically.\n\nAssistant General Director of JSC \"Murmansk Sea Fishing Port\" Roman Voynilo said, \"For the first time its a sufficiently large influx of cruise ships to Murmansk. This is due to the fact that the opportunity to take them has appeared. MSFP receives them, as the fishing port has the appropriate depth at the berths and the capacity to implement border controls\".\n\nIn the future, tourists will be taken by marine passenger terminal immediately after global reconstruction. The organizers of cruises predict that by the time there will be more work at the station than today the port serves. Each year, Murmansk increasingly attracts foreign tourists.\n\nAugust 5, 2011\n\nThe infrastructure of water tourism will be developed in the Leningrad region\n\nThe Governor Valery Serdyukov intrusted to develop the concept of water transport development in the inland waters of Leningrad region on the results of the workshop with vice-governors, chairmen of committees and industry leadership Ltd. \"The Russian yachting\".\n\nThe company appealed to the regional government and proposed the creation of infrastructure for the small size fleet on the Neva River within the limits of Kirov and Vsevolozhsk regions.\n\nInvestment Initiative is connected with the decision of the federal authorities to open waterways for sport, recreational and tourist foreign ships up to 18 people and need of renovation and construction of new mooring for boats and ships.\n\nAccording to deputy general director of Ltd. \"Russian yachting\" Dmitry Sokolov, St. Petersburg has several points for the mooring of vessels of this type. The company worked through the issue of placement of additional 5 berths with service in the Neva River in Leningrad region. This is a moorings with different capacities at Nevsky Forest Park, the memorial \"Hill of Glory\", the museum \"Breakthrough the Leningrad Siege\", Nevsky patch in Shlisselburgskaya harbor.\n\nAccording to the chairman of the Committee of Transport Nicholai Yanchenko, new infrastructure can be used not only for sailing but also for the organization of river passenger transport. Committee works out a two-stage scheme of development of water transport and travel. In the first phase - the creation of yacht infrastructure on the river Neva, while the second - in the Gulf of Finland, Lake Ladoga, on the rivers Volkhov and Svir. This will require attracting of investors, one of which made his proposal today.\n\n\"Development of a new infrastructure of water inland waterways will be complex, based on a single concept that brings together several areas related to the construction of piers, not only for small, but large vessels, car approaches, equipment, control points, fuel stations and even a helicopter landing\", Valery Serdyukov said.\n\nAugust 2, 2011\n\nTen cruise ships will visit Chukotka in the summer of 2011\n\nWith the opening of the summer tourist season in Chukotka international navigation has started. In 2011 ports in the region ten putting of sea cruise ships at ports are planned. In the beginning of July, motor ship \"Bremen\" with foreign tourists on board has already visited Providence Bay, Anadyr was also visited by \"Professor Khromov\" with foreign guests on board.\n\n\"Control Service, working at checkpoints, have done a big preparatory work to process border crossings as quick and convenient. With the new scheme of cruise ships execution, tourists could spend more time for sightseeing and cultural program \", the Chairman of the Committee for Sports and Tourism of Chukotka Irina Ryabukhina said. At the height of tourist season, a concerted effort on getting permission to enter the border zone is especially important, Ms. Ryabukhina said. The Committee works closely with the Border control of Federal Security Service of Russia on Chukotka. \"Despite the fact that we live on the border, Chukotka is open to tourists, including those who want to check yourself for strength. So in the beginning of July a world record for crossing the Bering Strait on kiteboard was set. And we can say that the record took place due to frontiers \", Irina Ryabukhina added.\n\nIn 2011, the number of cruise passengers who will visit Chukotka will grow by almost 40%. According to the Committee on Sport and Tourism of Chukotka, 1,300 people will visit the region in the tourist season.

A single tourist route which will unite the country will be its basis.\n\n\"Attempts to win tourists over to one's side, decoying by the fact that someone has something better, more interesting, original are not constructive, the Head of Khakassia Viktor Zimin said during a visit to Tuva. Taking into account the advantage of our neighborhood its much more promising to gain access to the tourist potential with joint tourism products. There will be a place for a unique natural beauty of Tuva, its distinctive culture, and an emerging tourist infrastructure of Khakassia and experience\".\n\nThe Head of Tuva Sholban Kara-ool and Viktor Zimin expect that Krasnoyarsk Territory can take part in the creation of a cluster.\n\nIn May 2009, during the Days of Tuva in the Krasnoyarsk region an agreement on cooperation between the regions in which the subjects of the Russian Federation pledged to support each other in various undertakings was signed.\n\nJuly 21, 2011\n\nAnniversary of the the public reception Head of the project \"St. Petersburg - the Sea Capital of Russia\" Sergey Sedov\n\nOn the 20th of July, 2011 the manager of \"Saint-Petersburg - the Sea Capital of Russia\" Project, Chairman of the Legislative Assembly Vadim Tulpanov congratulated the honored worker of Transport of Russia, Head of the public reception of the Project Party \"UNITED RUSSIA\", \"Saint-Petersburg - the Sea Capital of Russia\" Sergey Sedov on the 65-year anniversary.\n\nThe meeting was held in a festive atmosphere in one of the most beautiful buildings in St. Petersburg, where currently the Russian Sea Register of Shipping is situated. Life of hero of the day is closely connected with this place. For 27 years Sergey has been working for the benefit of the Russian Sea Register of Shipping, Russia's first classification society with the nearly 100-year history. Currently Sergey is the First Deputy Director General of Sea Register.\n\nNot by chance he was appointed as the Head of the public reception of the project \"St. Petersburg - the Sea Capital of Russia\". All work activity of celebrant was and is associated with the sea and waterways. For example, in 1984 Sergey Sedov was appointed as Deputy Director of the Register of the USSR by the Minister of Sea Fleet of the USSR. Sergey Sedov made a significant contribution to almost each area the Register. This is the solution of problems which is faced by the maritime world and the Russian fleet (including work to ensure its competitiveness), and the introduction of quality systems according to international ISO standards, aimed at improving the quality of the PC, and work to ensure recognition of MS by international organizations and other states, and much, much more. Dignified work of Sergei Nikolaevich for the benefit of maritime industry of the country was marked by the Decree of the President of Russia and the medal \"For Service to the Motherland» II degree.\n\nDespite the fact that the meeting of Tyulpanov and Sedov was held in a festive atmosphere, attention was also paid to work issues. During the meeting they touched upon the theme of the project \"St. Petersburg - the Sea Capital of Russia\" as a whole, as well as preparations for the international conference \"Transport and Transit Potential\", that is to be held in September 2011\n\nJuly 20, 2011\n\nVice Prime Minister will make an inspection of the tourist zone project in Kaliningrad Region\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak has ordered to make an incpection of the project of tourist and recreational zone on the Curonian Spit in the Kaliningrad region. The reason for the decision was the last meeting in Moscow, where the governor of the region, Nikolai Tsukanov spoke about the problems of development of the tourist facility.\n\nAccording to Tsukanov, one of the reasons hindering the development of the project is a long negotiation about planning area with the Ministry of Natural Resources. Its also associated with lack of interest from the leadership of the National Park \"Curonian Spit\", a weak engineering and municipal infrastructure.\n\nKaliningrad Governor said that if the project of tourist and recreational zone on the Curonian Spit is cut down, it will stop development of tourism in the region as a whole. At the moment the project does not work, the infrastructure of the Curonian Spit is not developing.\n\nTsukanov addressed the meeting participants with a proposal to support the initiative of the regional government for the conservation of this project and suggested that the Ministry of Natural Resources needs to include functioning of the SEZ in the Medium Term Development Plan of the National Park \"Curonian Spit\".\n\nJuly 15, 2011\n\nThe rules for foreign yachts on the Russian rivers\n\nThe Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed the Federal Law \"On Amendments to the Code of Inland Water Transport of the Russian Federation\". The law allows the sports and recreational vessels flying foreign flags swimming on the inland waterways of Russia.\n\nThe Code of inland waterway transport introduced a new Article 23.1 The sailing of vessels flying foreign flags on inland waterways. It establishes that the rules for navigation on inland waterways of sports and pleasure boats and vessels navigating with the purpose of tourism flying foreign flags are set by the Russian government.\n\nThe government also establishes a list of ports that are opened for entry of vessels flying foreign flags, and inland waterways, which are allowed for these boats sailing.\n\nTotal number of persons on such vessels shall not exceed 18, including not more than 12 passengers. The documents confirming the purpose and type of vessel and the right to fly the flag of the state in which the vessel is registered shall be on board.\n\nJuly 13, 2011\n\nRussiaTourism: The law should defy the liability for causing harm during river cruises\n\nLegal liability for damage causing during river transportation should be clearly defined in the legislation of the Russian Federation, the Deputy Head of the Federal Tourism Agency Eugene Pisarevskiy said at a press conference in Moscow devoted to the tragedy on the Volga, where the ship Bulgaria sank.\n\nIt is clear that it is impossible to make up the loss of human death, but there are certain legal relationships that allow families to receive compensation. In my opinion, the legal liability for causing damage must be clearly defined in the legislation. Maybe this should be done by analogy with air travel, where the insurance for causing damage was introduced, Eugene Pisarevsky said.\n\nLet us recall that a passenger aircraft is subject for compulsory personal accident insurance for the period of transportation.\n\nEugene Pisarevskiy said that a bill on compulsory insurance of civil liability of carriers is under consideration in the State Duma.\n\nDeputy Head of the Federal Tourism Agency also considers that its necessary to raise the legal culture in the market of river carriers.\n\nIn turn, the Executive Director of the Association of Tour Operators of Russia (ATOR) Maya Lomidze believes that the development of river cruise tourism in Russia is impossible without state support. According to her, only about 50 ships of 120 more or less comply with the requirements of services provision to tourists. These vessels were mostly built 25-30 years ago, while in Europe the age of such ships is 5-7 years.\n\nJuly 11, 2011\n\nNorth-West territorial administration Rosgranitsa: 4,000 people in 2.5 hours\n\nAt an international conference Saint - Petersburg - the Sea Capital of Russia. Sea tourism Deputy Director of the North-West territorial administration Rosgranitsa Constantine Kalnins said At a checkpoint Passenger Port of St. - Petersburg favorable conditions for passengers crossing the border have been created - about 4,000 people go through state control in a relatively short period of time (2 - 3 hours). The report On measures of creating of favorable conditions for crossing the state border of the Russian Federation in the North - West Region was presented at the second plenary session.\n\nPlan of cooperation and coordination of state control bodies and organizations developed by Rosgranitsa and approved by Coordinating Council and supporting agency for passenger vessels and services during passenger operations at the seaport Passenger Port of St.  Petersburg has allowed organizing the work of checkpoints more clearly. Daily meetings at the port of dispatch for planning of all services, including State Defence Committee, the next day preliminary information about the number of tourist arrivals and crew makes it possible to coordinate the activities of inspection services and to influence the capacity of the checkpoint.\n\nOpportunity of completing of migration card until the arrival in practice reduces the time of the control by each passenger. Previously, when making a card at the time of control directly, it would take up to the one third of the time required for its passing in general. Now Rosgranitsa supports the idea of abolishment of the procedure of the migration cards filling for cruise tourists. This may be the next step to optimize the process of operations inspection at the checkpoint Passenger Port of St.  Petersburg.\n\nThe main financial instrument in the implementation of measures to improve the checkpoints is the Federal Target Programme (FTP) State Border of the Russian Federation. Rosgranitsa ends the forming of the program for years 2012-2017. Within the framework of this federal program it is supposed the financing of a series of checkpoints in the North-West region reconstruction.\n\nJuly 8, 2011\n\nIII International Conference \"Sea Tourism\" in St. Petersburg\n\nOn the 7th of July, 2011 in St. Petersburg the III International Conference «Sea Tourism» was held within the framework of the project Saint Petersburg - the Sea Capital of Russia supported by the United Russia Party.This year's conference was attended by over 350 participants from 34 Russian regions and 10 foreign states.\n\nSuch issues as the solution of state regulation and support of boating problems that are included in the federal target programme \"Development of domestic and inbound tourism in the Russian Federation (2011-2018 years)\" were discussed at the plenary and working sessions of the conference. Representatives of the regions and foreign countries shared their experience of sea tourism, told about the problems and how they are solved.\n\nIn addition the issues of the domestic shipbuilding industry and the Russian passenger fleet, upgrading of coastal infrastructure, not only for shipping, but also for river boats, as well as the development of yacht tourism in Russia were raised.\n\nOne of the central topics of discussion was the introduction of \"72 hours\". An important direction of this regime development will be his introduction to such regions of the Russian Federation, as the Republic of Buryatia (Lake Baikal), Chukotka, Russia's Black Sea coast.\n\nIn the opening speech t, \"St. Petersburg - the Sea Capital of Russia\" Project Coordinator, Member of the Supreme Council of the Party \"UNITED RUSSIA\", State Duma deputy, the Arctic explorer and the first vice-president of the Russian Geographic Society Artur Chilingarov noted the progress that has been achieved by the work of the Project \"St. Petersburg - the Sea Capital of Russia\". Artur Chilingarov said, The revival of ferry service in the Baltic was an important event. The number of cruise tourists has increased by 300 thousand. Visa-free entry to Russia for passengers of cruise liners played the key role. The decision that was taken by the Government of the Russian Federation provided a favorable stay regime for cruise travelers and had a huge impact on the attractiveness of Russia for tourism\".\n\nDeputy Minister of Transport of the Russian Federation Viktor Olersky announced the planned measures for the development of Russian shipping, such as expanding of the scope of activity of the Russian International Ship Register (RISR) at all types of ships (sea, river and mixed \"river-sea\" navigation), built at the Russian shipyard after January 1, 2010, exemption from income tax in respect of the implementation of the operations of ships registered in the RISR, as well as the income from coastwise navigation, rating of a zero VAT on freight received with the vessels renting for a while (time charter) during the international transportation. Victor Olersky noted that the implementation of planned measures would involve the vessels under the national flag of the Russian Federation, create economic incentives for fleet renewal, including the river one, and provide additional tax revenues of $ 18.4 billion rubles to budgets of all levels (2011 - 2016 years), including tax payments from wage fund of crew in the operation of newly built vessels will be about 1.1 billion rubles. (2011 - 2016 years). Also additional revenue from tonnage tax (state tax) on the registration of newly built ships in the RISR and growth of the domestic fleet competitiveness in the market of international transportation can be expected. \"One workplace on the ship will create up to fifty workplaces in related sectors of the economy\", Olersky said. In general, all these measures will strengthen the mobilization potential of the country, Deputy Minister of Transport of Russia said.\n\nDeputy Minister of Regional Development, Alexander Viktorov touched on the issue of the development of tourism in the regions, and noted that Russia \"has great potential, especially in the development of river and sea tourism. We have programs in the South Federal District, the North West and the Far East. Such an important issue as the development of cruise tourism on the highway of the North Sea Route wasnt ignored. \" In the future the tourist market in the Arctic should become an important and integral part of the national tourism market and an important component of the tourism market of other countries of the Arctic region\", Viktorov said. He was supported by the report of the Deputy Minister of Economic Development of Murmansk oblast Victor Gorbunov, telling about the plans to transform Murmansk to the center of the Arctic cruise tourism. Gorbunov told about the main problems impeding the development of cruise tourism in the Murmansk port and announced the development prospects of Murmansk as a center of Arctic tourism.\n\nAn important statement was made head of the Federal Tourism Agency Alexander Radkov, \"Now we are on the threshold of the adoption of the Federal target program for the development of domestic and inbound tourism. Such a program will be adopted in Russia for the first time in history. The amount of funding will be about 330 billion rubles, including 96 billion rubles from the federal budget\".\n\nMuch attention was paid to the consideration of regional projects of the tourism industry. In addition to the Murmansk region, the projects were presented by such regions of the Russian Federation as Buryat Republic, Chukotka Autonomous District, Astrakhan, Vologda, Ivanovo, Novgorod regions and Republic of Karelia.\n\nAnnual Conference \"Sea tourism\" is supported by the Ministry of Sport, Tourism and Youth Policy, Ministry of Transport, the Federal Tourism Agency, Federal Agency of Sea and River Transport, the Federal Water Resources Agency, the Federal Migration Service; The Federal Agency for the Development of the State Border Facilities, Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment, Federal Agency for Fisheries.\n\nThe result of the III International Conference \"Sea Tourism\" will be resolution, which will include all suggestions for improving Russian legislation for the further implementation of tourist and recreational potential. Resolution will be sent to relevant ministries and agencies to improve the legal framework in the area of sea tourism.\n\nJuly 4, 2011\n\nTarget programs for tourism development are worked out in Primorye\n\nTarget programs of domestic and inbound tourism development for 2011-2016 will be developed in towns and districts of the Primorsky territory.\n\nTraining seminar on guidance in the creation of programs for tourism development in provincial offices took place in Ussuriysk.\n\nThe organizer is the Department of International Cooperation and Tourism of the Primorsky territory with the support of the Municipalities Council of Primorsky territory and Vladivostok State University of Economics and Service. Among the participants there are representatives of 21municipality of the Primorsky territory.\n\nThe seminar was dedicated to issues related to the strategy of tourism development in the Primorsky territory and the main provisions of the regional long-term target program for domestic and inbound tourism development for 2011-2016 years of regional program. Also typical structure of the municipal program and the specifics of its development in tourism were presented.\n\nParticular attention of the participants was paid to the problems of choosing of the priority tourism areas for different regions, the development of the management and financing program and the justification of the key program activities. A workshop on the development of the investment project as the basic element of the technical and economic support programs was the final step of the seminar.\n\nAccording to participants, most cities and districts of the territory have a high potential for tourism. Adoption of tourism development program will give new impetus to socio-economic development of municipalities.\n\nJuly 1, 2011\n\nAbolition of visas has increased the number of Finnish tourists in St. Petersburg\n\nIn 2010 180 thousand Finnish tourists arrived by sea in Russia. In 2011, as expected, this figure will be even greater. Thus, by April 50 thousand guests from Finland visited St. Petersburg, and in the summer the popularity of sea travel will increase traditionally.\n\nKey role in the growing of cruises popularity has played the visa-free entry to Russia for passengers of cruise liners. Thus tourists save time and money: a ticket to the liner can be purchased the day of departure, there is no need to wait for a visa and pay the application fee. However, additional costs will still be. The condition of a visa-free visit is pre-purchased travel services. This role is played by a bus provided by the cruise company. Ticket from the port to the center of St. Petersburg and back costs ? 20.\n\nLet us recall that the decision of the Government of the Russian Federation according to which foreign passengers of ferries can travel to St. Petersburg without a visa was taken in May 2009.\n\nJune 30, 2011\n\nForeign ships will be able to sail in the rivers of Russia\n\nYesterday the State Duma adopted in the second and third readings a bill that allows ships flying the foreign flags with sports, cultural and recreational purposes to go in lakes and rivers of Russia. The only condition is a number of people on board, no more than 18 people including crew.\n\nAccording to one of the authors of the law, the Head of the Duma transport committee Sergei Shishkarev the current version of the Code of inland water transport of the Russian Federation allows navigation in inland waterways only ships flying the national flag of Russia. The exceptions may be made only by a decision of the Government of the Russian Federation. According to him this restriction holds back not only the development of boating but the economy as a whole.\n\nThe bill specifies that navigation flying the flags of foreign countries with sport, cultural and recreational purposes (if its not on board more than 18 people, including maximum 12 passengers) in the inland waterways of Russia is carried out in accordance with the rules that Russian government will establish. At the same time such vessels must have the proof of type and purpose of the vessel and the right to fly the flag of the State in which it is registered.\n\nMr. Shishkaryov said, So instead of individual exceptions that have an extremely complex procedure of realization and that hardly can be achieved by the average foreign ownership in a one-off procedure standing rules for the entire class of ships will be established .\"\n\nIn addition, the bill stipulates that vessels flying the foreign flag shall be subjectet to compulsory pilotage, if otherwise is not stipulated by international treaties of the Russian Federation. The Russian government is empowered to approve the list of ports and inland waterways that are opened for entry and navigation of such vessels.\n\nVice-President of Russian Union of Travel Industry Yuri Barzykin noted that the Union lobbied for the bill, as many tour operators in the regions who are interested in tourists, raised this issue during meetings with his management. \"Tour operators are constantly paying our attention to the fact that this is an additional opportunity to attract tourists, as Russia has a vast network of rivers. But the question of infrastructure is appeared. We need comfortable, well furnished dock, floating fuel service stations, new hotels on the landing stage and the coastal strip with moorages. Now there are almost none of that. At a recent meeting in the Ministry of sport and tourism dedicated to the federal target program for the development of domestic tourism, I suggested to regions the building of financing boating in their infrastructure development programs. If it appears the number of Russian and foreign tourists will rise, the Vice-President of the Russian Union of Travel Industry said. He added that the yacht tourism is more profitable than usual, as the sailors are mostly wealthy people who spend more than others on the spot.\n\nYuri Barzykin expressed the confidence, «It is important that they come to where the usual way is difficult, as there are no roads. Many of our towns and villages, with rich natural and cultural resources, do not accept visitors because of lack of roads. But its possible to get there by the water. Therefore, the appearance of foreign yachts will give impetus to the development of those places where is no tourism today.\"\n\nJune 28, 2011\n\nOn June 29 during the second reading the State Duma will consider a new order of foreign sailing vessels entry in Russian waters\n\nThe press service of the Lower house of Parliament reports that on June 29, 2011 in the second reading the Russian State Duma will consider a draft of federal law ¹ 355723-5 «On Amendments to the Code of Inland Water Transport of the Russian Federation\" (on the order of sailing sports and recreational craft flying the flag of a foreign state).\n\nThis issue is on the agenda for tomorrow's meeting of parliamentarians. Up to now Russia's current legislation allowed foreign sailing yachts to locate only within the checkpoint. Changes to the Code of Inland Water Transport (KVVT) will allow yachts to enter the inland waters of the Russian Federation without the special permission of the Government of Russia.\n\nThereby, this measure will contribute to the development of boating and sailing in Russia. The involvement of participants in international sailing regattas will also contribute to it.\n\nThe bill was passed by the State Duma on May 20, 2011 in the first reading. The bill is prepared by the Ministry of Transport of Russia.\n\nJune 27, 2011\n\nThe official Partner of the Roundtable the Union of construction associations and organizations presents Day of the builder  2011\n\nThe official Partner of the Roundtable The development of inland waterways.

Construction and modernization of coastal infrastructure. The Vice-Governor of St. Petersburg and the Chairman of the Union Roman Filimonov will welcome the delegates of the conference.\n\nThe work session participants that are managers and representatives of construction companies, banks, investment companies will discuss the following issues: construction of infrastructure facilities in ports and coastal areas, hydrotechnical, alluvial and shore protection works, development of the institution of state-private partnerships, state support measures, changes in the taxation of the construction industry. Jointly developed proposals to improve legislation and management in the construction industry are expected to be the result of the discussion.\n\nThe Union of construction associations and organizations was established in 2002. Using direct and associative membership it includes more than 2,000 construction companies of various sizes. The entry of new companies into the Union is continuing.\n\nThe supreme organ of the Union of construction associations and organizations is the General Members Assembly. Its terms of reference cover the identification of the Union priority activities and the principles of formation and use of the property.\n\nThe Presidium is standing collegial governing body of the Union. It consists of the heads of subindustry professional associations which are founders of the Union. The Presidium is headed by the President Roman Filimonov who is the Vice-Governor of St. Petersburg. Chief Executive Director is Oleg Britov.\n\nJune 27, 2011\n\nThe State Duma Committee recommended to adopt the amendments to the Law on Tourism in the first reading\n\nLast Friday the State Duma Committee on Economic Policy and Entrepreneurship recommended Lower House of Parliament to pass a bill on state regulation of tourism activity in the first reading.\n\nAmong the amendments that concern reducing the size of financial guarantees for tourism a ban on the activities of tour operator entity details of which are absent in the registry, as well as the individual entrepreneur, the mandatory audit of tour operators on outbound tourism with an annual turnover of more than 100 million rubles. There is also a proposal to introduce a single contract form between the tour operator and travel agent. According to this form travel agent must work exclusively for and on behalf of tour operator. Let us remind that the last amendment gave rise to active discussions on the market.\n\nVice-President of Russian Union of Travel Industry Jury Barzykin explained that the recommendations of the State Duma Committee to adopt the amendments do not mean that the issue is finally resolved. Its a procedural formality. Usually the bill is not changed up to the first reading. No matter what.\n\nThe consideration of amendments in the first reading is planned for June 29. After that, the bill will be modified. The changes will be based on the numerous recommendations of the ministries and departments, regional administrations and, hopefully, taking into account the views of tourist industry. Yuri Barzykin supposes that things will go as far as that to the autumn only.\n\nJune 23, 2011\n\nRussian Union of Tourism Industry proposed to set up a working group to address problems of the inbound tourism to the Foreign Ministry\n\nRussia will not be able to increase the flow of inbound tourists, if the consulates of the country abroad are unfriendly to the tourist business, and the procedure for issuing visas is equally challenging. Its not enough to improve infrastructure, improve the level of service and optimize the quality-price ratio, especially considering that in both capitals, all this is quite in line with international standards. We should also make sure that foreign tourists want to visit Russia, and could come to us without much hassle.\n\nProblems hampering the development of inbound tourism were discussed yesterday at the roundtable in the RIA \"Novosti\". Vice-President of the Russian Union of Tourism Industry Yuri Barzykin noted that in 2010 the Russians, who left for abroad, took 26.5 billion dollars. And foreigners imported into Russia $ 8.9 billion. The difference between the two figures - $ 17.5 billion - a deficit of balance of payments under the item \"Travel.\" \"For example, the tourists have imported 12.9 billion U.S. dollars to the U.S. from January to April, the plan of 2011 is achieving the target of 151 billion\" - added Mr. Barzykin.\n\nHe recalled that, despite the high rates of Russia in different ratings of natural and cultural resources, it is far behind the developed countries in the field of inbound flow. \"The inbound tourism has many problems: poor infrastructure, lack of the international market promotion, quality-price ratio, and more. Today, measures are taken to build the infrastructure for major events, but how it will be used later? This year, as we see, is a year of decline of incoming flow from those areas, which have always shown good volumes, \"- said the vice-president of the Russian Union of Tourism Industry.\n\nPress secretary of the Russian Union of Tourism Industry Irina Tyurina recalled how the national offices of tourism, that are in amount of almost 50in Moscow, help Russian tour operators sending tourists abroad. \"They have money involved in the tour operator advertising, return them part of the money spent on the publication of catalogs, pay extra money for empty seats on charters,\" - said Ms. Turin. Russia doesnt have any full-fledged tourism office abroad.According to Irina Tyurina, the operators who accept tourists in Russia noted the complexity of the procedures for issuing visas, as well as troublesome and humiliating procedure of registration of foreigners in Russia among the main problems hindering the development of tourism. Among other problems - lack of modern cruise ships, modern buses for group tourist traffic as well as lack of necessary information in foreign languages, the absence of signs in Latin. \"Addressing these and other issues are not involved in the competence of any single ministry or agency. Tourism is an inter-farm complex.\"\n\nThe Russian Union of Travel Industry has stated the concerns of tour operators of inbound tourism in a letter that was sent to the Foreign Ministry on June 21. \"Many countries of the Schengen Agreement issue tourist visas to Russians that are valid for one year, the options for issuing visas to three or even five years are also being considered, the statement says. Of course, it stimulates the trips of our compatriots. According to experts, any simplification of visa formalities increases number of tourists in a direction for 20-30%. This trend is reflected in the statistics: in 2010, traveling abroad among the Russian tourists grew by 32%. And we are very interested in seeing that this movement was bilateral.\"\n\nThe Russian Union of Travel Industry proposed to establish a working group with representatives of the Russian Foreign Ministry Minsporturizm, Rostourism, industry non-governmental organizations and other interested parties - to jointly solve problems and discuss the future development of tourism in Russia.\n\nJune 22, 2011\n\nThe prices of cruises at the moment are similar to those in 2001, after the act of terrorism in the U.S.\n\nThe majority of Russian tour operators, who sell cruises, noted a sharp drop in the prices of the cruises and at the same time increasing demand for this type of vacation.\n\nLet us remind that recently it was published that European tour operators had to lower the cost of sea cruises in the Mediterranean because of weak sales - discounts up to 50%. In answer to this news CEO of \"Atlantis Line\" Natalia Andronova said that there are no any enormous discounts on cruises this summer in Russia. On the contrary the prices of cruises have grown on average by 10-15%.\n\nNot all tour operators have agreed with this point of view. According to the President of International Cruise Centre \"Neptune\" Valentine Eliseev prices for weekly trips in five-star liners have already fallen below the limit. For example, Holland America Line sells 10 nights for $ 700 now. Similar offers are in Royal Caribbean and Costa Cruises. According to Mr. Eliseev, on the average cruises this year compared to last one fell by 50%. And the cost of some routes and on some dates went down to 2-2.5. \"The cruise prices were reduced in the crisis, but not so much. What's happening with the prices now, it was only in 2001 when in the United States the twin towers collapsed as a result of act of terrorism, \"- said Valentine Elisha.\n\nAccording to the Director of cruise company \"Lanta-Tour Voyage\" Mary Murakinoy prices on cruises from Malaga, Palma de Majorca, Venice and Rome are reduced. Cruise company Royal Caribbean, which has the largest number of innovative liners in Europe, this season offered lucrative stock for traveling with the whole family that includes free accommodation for children and discounts up to 50% for extra space in the cabin.\n\nExperts see at least two reasons for this phenomenon. General Director of \"Breeze Line\" Radionovsky Maxim believes that one of them must be sought in the U.S. market, \"Last years rise in price of jet fuel led to a sharp drop in stream of passengers on air routes across the Atlantic. Many tourists abandoned the flight and sea cruises accordingly.\" And so far as the European market mainly rests on the giant cruise industry of the United States, most of freight capacity found itself in independent activity, Mr. Radionovsky continues. The competition with European companies has aggravated the situation. All this has led to the regular appearance of various special offers. All companies bear losses and want to minimize them. Although events in North Africa stand in the second place in the list of reasons for the current crisis its hardly comparable in importance, says Maxim Radionovsky.\n\nValentine Eliseev is sure that the current situation plays into the Russian tourist business and the consumers hands. Because of the crisis in the cruise industry, this type of vacation that was always quite expensive has passed into the category of mass. Now the opportunity to choose between marine recreation and tourism in Turkey for the same money has appeared. \"During the spring months our company has fixed an increase in demand by 30%. Active Cruise Sale with big discounts began in June. We can suppose that in the end of the season our results will be even higher, \"- says Mr. Elisha.\n\nHowever, high demand has not yet led to a marked increase in profits of the cruise tour operators. \"Income per unit of sale fell, the check was reduced. Although there is still the increase in the final turnover on the level of 10%, \"- says Valentin Elisha. According to Maxim Radionovsky, agencies and operators need to respond correctly to these trends - to sell more, spend less time for order processing. Experts believe that low price today creates an opportunity for the emergence of recurring customers. However, if the price of the cruise is the decisive factor of the choice in this situation hardly this effect can work.\n\nJune 21, 2011\n\nThe new ferry will operate between the Jewish Autonomous Region and China.\n\nA new self-propelled passenger ferry \"Primorets\" built in China will perform international trips along the Amur River between Russia and China, according to the press service of \"Rosgranstroy\". The cost of the vessel is more than 25 million rubles.\n\nCurrently, the China Ferry Terminal transports travelers across the Amur River, it can not cope with the growing needs of freight and passenger traffic. Voyages of the new ferry will run from the port Nizhneleninskoye in the Jewish Autonomous Region. \"Primorets\" will make the first voyage at the end of June.\n\nLet us recall that an agreement on the joint construction and operation of the railway bridge that connects the village Nizhneleninskoye (Jewish Autonomous Region) and the Chinese city of Tongjiang was signed between the Government of the Russian Federation and China on October 28, 2008. The length of the new bridge will be 2.2 km, and it will be one of the most convenient transportation corridors on the border between Russia and China.\n\nJune 20, 2011\n\nVolga as the basis of inter-regional tourism products\n\nAlmost a year ago eight Russian regions teamed up to jointly develop tourism and to promote their tourism potential. Agreement on cooperation in tourism was signed by Samara, Nizhny Novgorod, Ulyanovsk, Saratov, Penza regions, Chuvashia, Tatarstan and Mari El. It involves a comprehensive development of the areas, situated on the banks of the Volga, the development of new and consolidation of existing programmes to create a large-scale inter-regional tourism product with a unified marketing policies. The working title of the project - \"Big Volga\".\n\nActually the first presentation of the project took place on the Volga River as part of the cruise conference, organized with the support of the Federal Tourism Agency, the Russian Union of Travel Industry and the regions included in the agreement. The ship \"President\", provided by the \"Samara travel\" company, with tour operators, journalists and government officials on board traveled by the river for almost a week. In addition to meetings with travel agents on the route, the participants got acquainted with the Volga cities, assessing the state of infrastructure and tourist potential.\n\nPress Secretary of the Federal Tourism Agency Oleg Moseev said at the presentation that the regions gathered for joint positioning and promotion of their tourist potential on different shows. This year, the regional project coordinator is Tatarstan, in the future, the baton will be passed to the Samara region. In addition, the negotiations are carried out with other regions that also want to take part in the agreement. For example, the Orenburg region expressed its interest.\n\nAs a good example of an existing inter-regional project the head of the department of regulation and organization of tourist activity of Minsportturizm of Tatarstan Catherina Barabanova cited the brand \"Three Capitals of Russia\", uniting Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kazan in a common tourist route. In this case, Ms. Barabanova said that since most tourists traveling by the water fall into the category of return, they need new and interesting programmes. And they can occur only if the capabilities of several regions will be combined.\n\nIt is all about the river routes because that's the Volga that can be a link in this project, and the real inter-regional product yet is only cruising. This view is supported by the Head of the Tourism Committee of Physical Education, Sport and Tourism of the Penza region Alexei Ukolov. Although the region has no access to the Volga, it also has its interest in the practical implementation of the project. After completion of the river route, for example, in Saratov, the tourists may travel by bus to Penza, to see the sights of the city, and right after that they can disperse to their homes. The main thing is to build up the logistics of inter-regional travel.\n\nThe press secretary of Russian Union of Travel Industry Irina Tyurina, speaking at the roundtable, said that incentives of the regions to jointly develop tourism are commendable. But it is very difficult. Similar attempts have been undertaken, and not all of them were successful. In particular there was a tourist pool \"Big Volga\". In 2001, several tour operators from different cities of the Volga - Nizhny Novgorod, Samara, Saratov, Togliatti, Ulyanovsk were united under the title. The aim was the same - joint promotion, the creation of inter-regional routes. Tour operators were common booth at trade shows, they released a joint catalog. But the pool existed not for long; it was destroyed by the competitive ambitions of the participants.\n\nAccording to Irina Tyurina the most striking example of successful inter-regional product is \"The Great Sayan Ring\" - a route with a visit to the Krasnoyarsky krai, Khakassia and Tuva. It was designed 10 years ago by the Krasnoyarsk company \"Sayan Ring\" and has being successfully developed since; last year regional tourism administration guided a route familiarization tour for journalists and tour operators of Siberia. Curious to relate, this trip was the first experience of inter-regional information tour at the level of regional authorities.\n\nIrina Tyurina drew attention to an interesting regularity: the inter-regional product lives only if it is a real commercial product and a specific tourist market party is interested in it. Talking about the same river cruises, each of them is a business initiative of a given tour operator which is attracting colleagues from neighboring regions. Each participant of the process should be interested in profit. Therefore, according to Ms. Tyurina, the viability of the \"Big Volga\" depends largely on the interests of the local tourist industry. \"Logically, the inter-regional routes as their own product shall be developed by tour operators, and regional administrations that have adhered to the agreement, will provide support in establishing the necessary infrastructure and promotion\", - said Irina Tyurina.\n\nOthers participants of the roundtable agreed with this point of view. General Director of \"Wind Rose\" Sergey Zenkin believes that tourism product should be on a level that can be easily sold. But so far, in his opinion, the existing infrastructure in the regions is not enough for successful tourism activity.\n\nDirector of Ulyanovsk resource center for tourism and service of the regional Ministry of Economy Sergey Lakovsky, in turn, noted the problems of the cruise market.\n\nMost of the ships were built half a century ago, and almost exhausted their resources. The same can be said about the state of the river piers and other infrastructure. \"The private companies will not solve this problem without government intervention. I think option grants would suit the business, same as in agriculture where the state partially finances the purchase of new farm machinery \", - Mr. Lakovsky believes.\n\nJune 15, 2011\n\nNorthern tourism in Russia will be supported in the legislation\n\nTourism Development in the Northern regions of Russia is kept under by many factors. Among them - cold climate, poor transportation infrastructure, lack of long-term and multi-level planning, lack of participation of small and medium-si"
