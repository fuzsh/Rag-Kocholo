        "text": "Teresa Levonian Cole marks the 400th anniversary of the birth of the Romanov dynasty with a cruise between the country's two greatest cities, St Petersburg and Moscow\n\nIN Uglich, 200km north of Moscow, a red-and-white church overlooking the River Volga marks the spot where, in 1591, eight-year-old Tsarevich Dmitry, the youngest son of Ivan the Terrible and the last of the Rurik dynasty, was murdered, allegedly on the orders of Boris Godunov.\n\nTo quell the ensuing uproar, Moscow despatched investigators, who concluded that the young boy had fallen, accidentally stabbing himself (\"Seven times!\" add locals, wryly) in the process.\n\nMoscow ordered reprisals for the uprising. Among those castigated was a church bell, which was flogged, had its tongue cut out, and was exiled to Siberia, where it remained for the next 300 years: punishment for spreading false rumours of murder. A mural in the church depicts these events, which would later form the basis of Pushkin's play Boris Godunov and the eponymous opera by Mussorgsky.\n\nRussia is a country whose operatic complexity often calls on the suspension of disbelief. But whatever the cause, the death of Dmitry paved the way for the Romanovs, whose eventual accession to the throne in 1613 is being celebrated during this 400th anniversary year. My river cruise between Romanov St Petersburg and Russia's present capital, Moscow, began with a whirlwind tour of the former, from the Peter and Paul Fortress, from which the city stemmed and where Russia's tsars, from Peter the Great onwards, lie buried, to the Yusupov Palace, where Rasputin met his end.\n\nWe sped through the State Hermitage museum, pausing to allow for photography before selected masterpieces of European art, which include Leonardos (two), Rembrandts (two, among dozens) and the country's only Michelangelo sculpture. There were serendipitous discoveries, too.\n\n\"Does this remind you of anyone?\" asked the guide, pointing to a 12th-century bronze statuette of a dog. His features are the spitting image of one Vladimir Putin and the subject of much mirth in the city of his birth.\n\nOn the fourth night, our ship, the AmaKatarina, finally embarked on the 130km journey along the Volga-Baltic Waterway to Moscow.\n\nPeter the Great had dreamt of uniting the Neva and Moskva rivers to provide a much-needed trade route, though his project would take 250 years, and the help of Stalin's gulag prisoners, to complete. To reach our destination, a mere three-and-a-half hours by express train, we would sail through three lakes, five rivers, two reservoirs, three canals, 20 or so locks, several hundred flooded villages, and some astonishing feats of engineering that would raise us from sea level to 162m above.\n\nOur ship was part of the large Vodohod Russian river fleet - leased by AmaWaterways and staffed by a charming Russian crew. Refitted in 2011, and with the number of cabins reduced to a comfortable 106, standards and facilities were, nonetheless, a source of less-than-happy surprise to seasoned AmaWaterways clients used, for example, to larger bathrooms and more luxurious cabins. Speaking later of the \"challenges\" of operating in Russia, the operations vice-president Jon Burrows said this voyage \"emphasises the destination rather than the ship\". The trips sell like hot cakes.\n\nThe majority of our number was past the flower of youth - many of them Americans on their virgin voyage to a country known only through the filter of US political rhetoric. Pace and information were tailored accordingly; historical and cultural information meted out in easily digestible doses. It was, apparently at the request of previous passengers, a \"silent ship\", with no commentary on the sights or places we cruised past - though our cruise director, Inna, would deliver a daily river update over the loudspeaker. Then, at each stop, we would divide into groups of around 30, each with a local guide well versed in the exasperating priorities: photographs, location of \"comfort stops\", and souvenir shops. I was disappointed by the superficiality of the information, and the brevity of the stops in a destination that yields a rich seam of touring sites.\n\nAnd yet, compensation came in many forms. On the first night, we sailed through Lake Ladoga, the largest lake in Europe, to wake on the mirror-smooth Svir River, its banks dense with birch and pine. We disembarked at the village of Svirstroy, where we were invited into wooden dwellings \"to experience authentic rural life in Russia\".\n\nLyuba, my hostess, was celebrating her 56th birthday. Her skin was smooth, her eyes a cerulean blue, her hair white as snow. She lived with her sister, Natasha, who sported a moustache and gold incisors.\n\nIcons gazed from the walls, china figures adorned a cabinet, and a translation of Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe squatted among a row of paperbacks. In the corner, a wood-burning stove protected against subzero winter temperatures, aided by radiators, heated by steam from the nearby hydroelectric power station. As we sipped tea from a samovar, Lyuba chatted about her life as a postal worker.\n\n\"We've always lived here,\" she said. \"But young people now go to the cities to seek work, and return only to retire. And though our houses are modest, they were rebuilt by German prisoners after the village was destroyed in the Great Patriotic War - so they are solid.\" I tried to imagine the house in winter, buried under 3m of snow.\n\nWith the luminous \"White Nights\" sun still shining at 11pm, we reached Lake Onega. I woke at 5am to find mist rising from the water as we approached Kizhi, an island sacred since pagan times, and the northernmost point of our journey. In the eerie silence, the Church of the Transfiguration hove into view, the aspen shingles covering its 22 onion domes shimmering like quicksilver. I blinked. The church seemed to be levitating 10m above shore.\n\nOnly later was the mystery revealed. Currently under restoration, the church is supported by scaffolding while its early 18th-century pine beams are removed, from the bottom up, to create the wondrous illusion of an edifice floating on air. Today, Kizhi is a tranquil museum-island of wooden architecture, where artisans in traditional dress practise ancient crafts. Among them, a grizzled carpenter - straight from the pages of Tolstoy - demonstrated the cutting and shaping of shingles, solely with the use of an axe. Two missing fingers from his left hand are his mark of authenticity.\n\nOn board, meals were plentiful and fresh, if a little unimaginative - an anodyne compromise of East-meets-West. Entertainment ranged from a traditional Russian tea ceremony to elementary Russian classes, a competition for the best-painted matryoshka, and - best of all - a wry talk by Larisa, our resident lecturer, entitled: \"Lenin to Putin: the Alternation of Bald and Hairy Presidents\".\n\nNaively, perhaps, I hadn't expected crowds in remote spots. The beautiful Monastery of St Cyril in Goritsy - whose massive fortifications had resisted attack by Polish and Lithuanian troops - we found invaded by a horde from six cruise ships. Founded in 1397, St Cyril's houses a magnificent collection of icons, and was once the most important monastery in northern Russia. Ivan the Terrible had ambitions to retire here. Legend has it he once arrived late for dinner, to be turned away by the punctilious monks. \"We fear the Tsar,\" they told him, \"but we fear God more.\" Somehow, they escaped exchanging their monastic cells for those of the monastery's prison - a favoured place of exile for dissidents and troublesome priests.\n\nYaroslavl, situated at the confluence of the Volga and Kotorosl rivers, we had to ourselves. In a detour from the Rybinsk Reservoir - created by Stalin at the cost of 100 lives a day - we sailed past the spires of Tutaev to the ancient Golden Ring city.\n\nA thousand years old, Yaroslavl reached its zenith in the 1600s and served as Russia's capital in 1612, during the between-the-dynasties Time of Troubles. Gracious architecture bespeaks her merchant wealth and the domes of 77 churches and 25 monasteries once graced her boundaries. The revolution of 1917 may have destroyed 60% of her heritage but the city's importance, commemorated on the 1000 rouble note, would have rewarded a longer visit than our allotted three hours.\n\nThe final leg of our journey was from the Uglich reservoir along the Volga. We cruised over the submerged town of Kalyazin, whose lone bell-tower poked out above the swollen waters like an admonitory finger. \"You experienced the comfort and convenience a cruise offers,\" it seemed to say, \"but you barely scratched the surface of the cruel history that marks this waterway\": a call to return, perhaps, in more leisurely vein. - ©Daily Telegraph\n\nGETTING THERE\n\nThe writer travelled as a guest of AmaWaterways (amawaterways.co.uk). It offers an 11-night cruise in either direction between St Petersburg and Moscow on the AmaKatarina, along the Volga-Baltic Waterways, from £2532 (about R40600) per person. Excludes flights.\n\nWHEN TO GO\n\nCruises run between May and September, as rivers are frozen over in winter.\n\nTIPS\n\nSvirstroy offers the best shopping opportunities along the route, with authentic handmade crafts at reasonable prices. These include wood carvings, hand-knitted shawls and fur hats.\n\nMake sure you come armed with roubles for local purchases, as there are no currency-exchange facilities on board.\n\nTipping: reckon on paying £140 (about R2200) per person, to be shared among the crew and cruise directors (cash only). In addition, around £2 (R30) for the services of the local guide is expected.\n\nMORE READING\n\nMoscow, St Petersburg and the Golden Ring (Odyssey Guides)."
