        "text": "In February 2019, the Ministry of Economic Development of the RF approved the spatial development strategy of Russia as part of 12 macro-regions.\n\nInformation agency Credinform represents an overview of activity trends of the largest enterprises of the real sector of the economy in the Central economic region of Russia.\n\nEnterprises with the largest volume of annual revenue (TOP-1000) were selected for the analysis, according to the data from the Statistical Register for the latest available periods (for 2013 - 2018). The analysis was made on the basis of the data of the Information and Analytical system Globas.\n\nNet assets value is an indicator, reflecting the real value of company’s property, is calculated annually as the difference between assets on the enterprise balance and its debt obligations. The indicator of net assets is considered negative (insufficiency of property), if company’s debt exceeds the value of its property.\n\nThe largest enterprise of the Central economic region of Russia in terms of net assets is GAZPROM PJSC, INN 7736050003, Moscow. Its net assets amounted to 11 067 billion rubles in 2018.\n\nThe smallest amount of net assets in the TOP-1000 list was hold by UNITED CHEMICAL COMPANY URALCHEM NJSC, ИНН 7703647595, Moscow. The insufficiency of property of this company in 2018 was expressed as a negative value of -113 billion rubles.\n\nThe average values of net assets of TOP-1000 enterprises tend to increase over the five-year period (Picture 1).\n\nPicture 1. Change in the average indicators of the net asset value of TOP-1000 companies in 2014 – 2018\n\nThe shares of TOP-1000 enterprises with insufficiency of assets have a tendency to decrease in the last five years (Picture 2).\n\nPicture 2. Shares of enterprises with negative values of net assets in TOP-1000\n\nSales revenue\n\nThe revenue volume of 10 leading companies of the region made 35,5% of the total revenue of TOP-1000 in 2018. (Picture 3). It points to a high level of capital concentration.\n\nPicture 3. Shares of participation of TOP-10 companies in the total revenue of TOP-1000 enterprises for 2018\n\nIn general, there is a tendency to increase in the revenue volumes (Picture 4).\n\nPicture 4. Change in the average revenue of TOP-1000 companies in 2014 – 2018\n\nProfit and losses\n\nThe largest company in terms of net profit value is GAZPROM PJSC, INN 7736050003, Moscow. Company's profit amounted to 933 billion rubles in 2018.\n\nOver a five-year period, TOP-1000 enterprises showed a tendency to growth of profits (Picture 5).\n\nPicture 5. Change in the average indicators of profit of TOP-1000 companies in 2014 – 2018\n\nAverage values of net profit’s indicators of TOP-1000 enterprises have a tendency increase over a five-year period, at the same time the average value of net loss decreases. (Picture 6).\n\nPicture 6. Change in the average indicators of net profit and net loss of TOP-1000 companies in 2014 – 2018\n\nKey financial ratios\n\nOver the five-year period, the average indicators of the total liquidity of TOP-1000 enterprises were mainly in the range of recommended values - from 1,0 up to 2,0, with a tendency to increase. (Picture 7).\n\nThe total liquidity ratio (the relation of the amount of current assets to short-term liabilities) shows the sufficiency of company’s funds for repayment of its short-term liabilities.\n\nPicture 7. Change in the average values of the total liquidity ratio of TOP-1000 companies in 2014 – 2018\n\nOver the course of five years, there is a high level of average indicators of return on investment ratio, with a tendency to increase (Picture 8).\n\nThe ratio is calculated as the relation of net profit to the sum of own capital and long-term liabilities and demonstrates the return on the equity involved in the commercial activity and the long-term borrowed funds of an organization.\n\nPicture 8. Change in the average values of the return on investment ratio of TOP-1000 companies in 2014 – 2018\n\nAsset turnover ratio is calculated as the relation of sales proceeds to the average value of total assets for a period and characterizes the efficiency of use of all available resources, regardless of the sources of their attraction. The ratio shows how many times a year a complete cycle of production and circulation is made, yielding profit.\n\nOver a five-year period, this indicator of business activity showed a tendency to increase (Picture 9).\n\nPicture 9. Change in the average values of the asset turnover ratio of TOP-1000 companies in 2014 – 2018\n\nSmall business\n\nNone of TOP-1000 enterprises is registered in the Register of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Federal Tax Service of the RF.\n\nMain regions of activity\n\nTOP-1000 companies are registered in all 13 regions and distributed extremely unequal across the territory. More than 82% of the largest enterprises in terms of revenue are concentrated in Moscow (Picture 10).\n\nPicture 10. Distribution of the revenue of TOP-1000 companies by regions of the Central economic region of Russia\n\nFinancial position score\n\nAn assessment of the financial position of TOP-1000 companies shows that the financial position of the most of them is above average. (Picture 11).\n\nPicture 11. Distribution of TOP-1000 companies by financial position score\n\nSolvency index Globas\n\nThe vast majority of TOP-1000 enterprises got Superior/High or Strong/Medium Solvency index Globas, that points to their ability to pay off their debts in time and fully (Picture 12).\n\nIndustrial production index\n\nAccording to the Federal State Statistics Service, there is a tendency towards an increase in indicators of the industrial production index in the Central economic region of Russia during 12 months of 2019 (Picture 13). At the same time, the average index month-over-month made 101,6%.\n\nPicture 13. Averaged industrial production index in regions of the Central economic district of Russia in 2019, month-over-month (%)\n\nAccording to the same data, the share of enterprises of the Central economic region of Russia in the total amount of revenue from the sale of goods, works, services made 30.309% countrywide for 2018, and for 9 months of 2019 – 30.409%, that is higher than the indicator for the same period of 2018, which amounted to 29,991%\n\nConclusion\n\nA comprehensive assessment of activity of the largest enterprises of the real sector of the economy in the Central economic region of Russia, taking into account the main indices, financial indicators and ratios, points to the prevalence of positive trends (Table 1).\n\nTable 1.
