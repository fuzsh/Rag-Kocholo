        "text": "There are few better ways to explore a destination than by cruise. Here are some of our cruise specialists’ favourite reasons to book a Silversea Cruise.\n\nInfinite Possibilities\n\nSilversea voyages and cruise expeditions sail to over 900 destinations on all seven continents, more than any other cruise line — large or small. Their itineraries include many ports with late-night and overnight departures providing you with more time to experience the local colours and cultures. For those who want to explore beyond the shore, an extensive collection of land adventures offer a convenient, seamless way to extend your travels.\n\nAll-Inclusive, Nothing Extra\n\nEnjoy the ease, convenience and value of an all-inclusive cruise fare that includes almost all of your discretionary onboard expenses such as gratuities, room service, and both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages – those extra charges that can add up to so much more.\n\nGlobal Flavours for Wordly Travellers\n\nRenowned for culinary excellence and innovative spirit, Silversea’s luxury cruises offer a choice of open-seating dining options throughout the fleet, as well as several specialty venues aboard all non-expedition ships. In fact Silver Muse has eight restaurants to choose from; more dining options than any other ultra-luxury ship at sea. Daily changing menus present a wide range of offerings including Continental, vegetarian and CuislineLite™ selections, as well as regional specialities unique to the destination."
