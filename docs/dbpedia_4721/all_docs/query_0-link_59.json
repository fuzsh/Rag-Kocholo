        "text": "Ekokhod has all-aluminium construction, a length of 31 metres, a beam of nine metres, a displacement of 74 tonnes, and capacity for three crewmembers and 130 passengers on two decks. The main deck features a business class cabin with seating for 16 passengers near the bow while the remaining 114 will be accommodated in the larger economy seating area.\n\nThe onboard facilities include toilets on the main deck and an observation area on the upper deck. Toilets are also available for use by mothers with small children and by passengers with reduced mobility. All interior spaces also feature air conditioning.\n\nThe interior spaces can also be configured to accommodate a variety of private events such as corporate gatherings and live musical performances, and the distances between seats can be adjusted even to ensure greater legroom for regular passenger excursions. This attribute is made possible partly due to the vessel's modular construction.\n\nThe catamaran hulls, the wheelhouse, and the main passenger cabin were all built as individual components and may be separately removed for maintenance, repair, or modification without any impact on the rest of the vessel. Emperium said this also enables the vessel to be disassembled, transported by rail, and then reassembled anywhere within Russia in as little as five days.\n\nPropulsive power is provided by a 1,200kW lithium iron phosphate battery pack driving two 400kW motors connected to propellers. This arrangement allows the vessel to sail up to 180 kilometres at a cruising speed of seven knots, though the maximum speed is rated at 22 knots.\n\nThe multi-level security of the system is provided by three degrees of electronic protection and a built-in fire extinguishing system with gas exhaust channels. The battery system is built on a modular principle on quick-release couplings, which allows for easy removal of the batteries and the control modules for replacement or service.\n\nEkokhod is the first in a planned series of five catamaran tour boats. The vessel's initial sailings will be along the Yenisei River in the city of Krasnoyarsk in Siberia.\n\nSome of our readers have expressed disquiet at our publication of reviews and articles describing new vessels from Russia. We at Baird Maritime can understand and sympathise with those views. However, despite the behaviour of the country's leaders, we believe that the maritime world needs to learn of the latest developments in vessel design and construction there."
