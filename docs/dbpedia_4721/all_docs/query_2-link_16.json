        "text": "On the fourth night our ship, the AmaKatarina, finally embarked on the 82-mile journey along the Volga-Baltic Waterway to Moscow. Peter the Great had dreamt of uniting the Neva and Moskva rivers to provide a much-needed trade route, though his project would take some 250 years, and the help of Stalin’s gulag prisoners, to complete. To reach our destination, a mere three-and-a-half hours by express train, we would sail through three lakes, five rivers, two reservoirs, three canals, some 20 or so locks, several hundred flooded villages, and some astonishing feats of engineering that would raise us from sea level, to 162 metres above.\n\nOur ship was part of the large Vodohod Russian river fleet – leased by AmaWaterways and staffed by an unfailingly charming Russian crew. Refitted in 2011, and with the number of cabins reduced to a comfortable 106, standards and facilities were, none the less, a source of less-than-happy surprise to seasoned AmaWaterways clients used, for example, to larger bathrooms and more luxurious, spacious cabins. Speaking later of the “challenges” of operating in Russia, the operations vice-president Jon Burrows explained that this voyage “emphasises the destination rather than the ship.” The trips sell like hot cakes.\n\nThe majority of our number was past the flower of youth – many of them Americans on their virgin voyage to a country known only through the filter of US political rhetoric. Pace and information were tailored accordingly; historical and cultural information meted out in easily digestible doses that ensured no one would choke. It was, apparently at the request of previous passengers, a “silent ship”, with no commentary on the sights or places we cruised past in blissful ignorance – although our delightful cruise director, Inna, would deliver a daily river update over the tannoy. Then, at each stop, we would divide into groups of around 30, each with a local guide well versed in the exasperating priorities: photographs, location of “comfort stops”, and souvenir shops. It is fair to say I was disappointed by the superficiality of the information, and the brevity of the stops in a destination that yields a rich seam of touring sites.\n\nAnd yet, compensation came in many forms. On the first night we sailed through Lake Ladoga, the largest lake in Europe, to wake on the mirror-smooth Svir river, its banks dense with birch and fragrant pine. We disembarked at the village of Svirstroy, where we were invited into wooden dwellings “to experience authentic rural life in Russia”.\n\nLyuba, my hostess, was celebrating her 56th birthday. Her skin was smooth, her eyes a cerulean blue, her hair white as snow. She lived with her sister, Natasha, who conversely sported a moustache and whose smile revealed gold incisors flanking a gap where her front teeth formerly resided. Icons gazed from the walls, china figures adorned a cabinet, and a translation of Sir Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe squatted among a row of paperbacks. In the corner, a wood-burning stove protected against sub-zero winter temperatures, aided by radiators, heated by steam from the nearby hydroelectric power station. As we sipped tea from a samovar and munched cabbage pierogi (dumplings), Lyuba chatted about her life as a postal worker. “We’ve always lived here,” she said. “But young people now go to the cities to seek work, and return only to retire. And though our houses are modest, they were rebuilt by German prisoners after the village was destroyed in the Great Patriotic War – so they are solid.” I tried to imagine the house in winter, buried under three metres of snow.\n\nLake Ladoga, the largest lake in Europe\n\nWith the luminous “White Nights” sun still shining at 11pm, and to the accompaniment of live folk music, we reached Lake Onega. I woke at 5am to find mist rising from the water as we approached Kizhi, an island sacred since pagan times, and the northernmost point of our journey. In the eerie silence, the Church of the Transfiguration hove into view, the aspen shingles covering its 22 onion domes shimmering like quicksilver. I blinked. The church seemed to be levitating 10 metres above shore.\n\nOnly later was the mystery revealed. Currently under restoration, the church is supported by scaffolding while its early 18th-century pine beams are removed, from the bottom up, to create the wondrous illusion of an edifice floating on air. Today, Kizhi is a tranquil museum-island of wooden architecture, where artisans in traditional dress practise ancient crafts. Among them, a grizzled carpenter – straight from the pages of Tolstoy – demonstrated the cutting and shaping of shingles, solely with the use of an axe. Two missing fingers from his left hand are his mark of authenticity.\n\nOn board, meals were plentiful and fresh, if a little unimaginative – an anodyne compromise of East-meets-West. To keep us amused, entertainment ranged from a traditional Russian tea ceremony to elementary Russian classes, a competition for the best-painted matryoshka, and – best of all – a wry talk by Larisa, our resident lecturer, entitled: “Lenin to Putin: the Alternation of Bald and Hairy Presidents”.\n\nNaively, perhaps, I hadn’t expected crowds in remote spots. The beautiful Monastery of St Cyril in Goritsy – whose massive fortifications had resisted attack by Polish and Lithuanian troops – we found invaded by a horde from six cruise ships. Founded in 1397 and royally endowed, St Cyril’s houses a magnificent collection of icons, and was once the most important monastery in northern Russia. Ivan the Terrible had ambitions to retire here. Legend has it that he once arrived late for dinner, to be turned away by the punctilious monks. “We fear the Tsar,” they told him, “but we fear God more.” Somehow, they escaped exchanging their monastic cells for those of the monastery’s prison – a favoured place of exile for dissidents and troublesome priests.\n\nYaroslavl, situated at the confluence of the Volga and Kotorosl rivers, we had to ourselves. In a detour from the Rybinsk Reservoir – created by Stalin at the cost of 100 lives a day – we sailed past the fairy-tale spires of Tutaev to the ancient Golden Ring city. Fortuitously, Valery, a laconic professor of philosophy, fell to my group as Cicerone.\n\nA thousand years old, Yaroslavl reached its zenith in the 1600s and served as Russia’s capital in 1612, during the between-the-dynasties Time of Troubles. Gracious architecture bespeaks her merchant wealth and the domes of 77 churches and 25 monasteries once graced her boundaries. The revolution of 1917 may have destroyed 60 per cent of her heritage but the city’s importance, commemorated on the 1,000 rouble note, would have rewarded a longer visit than our allotted three hours.\n\nThe final leg of our journey was from the Uglich reservoir along the Volga. We cruised over the submerged town of Kaliazin, whose lone bell-tower poked out above the swollen waters like an admonitory finger. “You experienced the comfort and convenience a cruise offers,” it seemed to say, “but you barely scratched the surface of the cruel history that marks this waterway”: a call to return, perhaps, in more leisurely vein.\n\nEssentials\n\nGETTING THERE\n\nTeresa Levonian Cole travelled as a guest of AmaWaterways (0808 223 5009; amawaterways.co.uk). It offers an 11-night cruise in either direction between St Petersburg and Moscow on the AmaKatarina, along the Volga-Baltic Waterways, from £2,532 per person including tours. Excludes flights.\n\nBritish Airways (0844 493 0787; ba.com) flies three times a week from London to St Petersburg and three times a day to Moscow; returns cost from £218 to the former and from £265.95 to the latter, including taxes.\n\nWHEN TO GO\n\nCruises run between May and September only, as rivers are frozen over in winter. In summer, when temperatures hover around 25C (77F), the northern latitudes experience the White Nights, with the sun barely setting between June 11 and July 2.\n\nVISAS\n\nSeveral companies can arrange Russian visas, for varying costs. VFS Global (ru.vfsglobal.co.uk) is efficient and competitively priced. A single-entry tourist visa costs from £77.60 (seven-day service) to £134.80 (24 hours).\n\nTIPS\n\nSvirstroy offers the best shopping opportunities along the route, with authentic handmade crafts at reasonable prices. These include wood carvings, hand-knitted shawls and fur hats.\n\nMake sure you come armed with roubles for local purchases, as there are no currency exchange facilities on board.\n\nTipping: reckon on paying $220/ £140 per person, to be shared among the crew and cruise directors (cash only). In addition, $2-$3/£1.30-£2 for the services of the local guide is expected.\n\nREAD\n\nMoscow, St Petersburg and the Golden Ring (Odyssey Guides, £16.95)."
