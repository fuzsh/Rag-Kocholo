Here are a few recent reviews from our customers around the world:\n\nDalmatian Paradise – Croatia Cruise Sept 2023\n\n“…We absolutely loved every aspect of the cruise and we didn’t want for anything. It really was one of our highlights of our 5 week holiday. The crew, especially the lead Cruise Co-Ordinator (Phillip) was great, the food was delicious and plentiful and the facilities onboard always clean and catered for all of our needs over the duration of the cruise. We actually all commented on how generous in size the cabins were. The itinerary took us to beautiful islands and I loved that there was a good blend of group and free time. The tour guides that were organised for us on-land were all very experienced and passionate and generously shared their knowledge of the various islands we visited. We got to enjoy very special swimming spots too and we never felt rushed. Our only less than positive feedback was the island stop on the last day was quite boring in comparison to the rest of the island stops and even the Captain himself commented the same. Other than that, we would highly recommend the cruise to others and feel very fortunate to have experienced the Croatian islands in this very special way. Thanks again Becky for all of your help to co-ordinate our booking. We’ll be living on our happy memories for years to come. If other boutique cruises of this nature become available in the future, we’d loved to receive information…” J & A L from Australia\n\nKvarner Bay of Islands – Croatia Cruise Sept 2023\n\n“…I had a really great trip. I have no complaints. Loved the boat, it was exactly what I was looking for. Had my exterior cabin. That’s so important for a cruise like this. Food was excellent too! Honestly, what a positive difference from last year’s cruise. Now that I’ve seen most of the Croatian coastline, I think the best is the Split-Split cruise. My schedule won’t permit me to go next summer but for 2025, I would love to go again. I really want to see that blue cave! As always, thank you for all your help!!…” JW from USA\n\nKvarner Bay of Islands – Croatia Cruise Sept 2023\n\n“…Your pre cruise service was very good & easy to understand, the cruise was very enjoyable, the crew were fantastic, the meals were great, although a bit big, we had to ask cook to cut back a little, the cabin we had was very small although comfortable, some of the swim stops were a little too long, one was 6 hours, the cruise tour manager had a few problems trying to explain what our next stop was all about & some passengers felt she was very hard to understand, otherwise all very enjoyable…” GM from Australia\n\nMini Cruise Croatia + Medjugorje Aug 2023\n\n“…Your personal assistance was impeccable! I really appreciate it. The overall cruise was ok, would like to mention Azra at the dinning room was very good and efficient girl. Erina, our manager excellent, caring and on top of everything. Medjugorie was wonderful also, the drivers, Antonio, Nikolas, Mili and Felano were very good and professional. Thanks again Becky!…” LA from USA\n\nMini Cruise – Croatia Aug 2023\n\n“…Everything was fantastic!…” SS from Canada\n\nKvarner Bay of Islands – Croatia Cruise Aug 2023\n\n“…First many thanks to you for the good and fast response to all our requests. I think the management of our booking and pre-trip documentation & information was far better than I can remember on other holidays so far. Regarding the trip itself:-\n\nGenerally a good trip\n\nExcellent tour manager Josephina\n\nWould have rather had a tea/coffee station available at all times\n\nIn the morning rather a queue for toast so larger toaster or more of them would be good\n\nPre-dinner drinks – crew were pushed so not easy for them to serve drinks whilst setting up the dining room\n\nThe rear side screens should have been removed more frequently\n\nNon reservation of sun beds might make it better\n\nWe had previously done the southern islands and would have preferred smaller ports on this last trip…”\n\nKW from UK\n\nSupreme Croatia Cruise – July 2023\n\n“…We are back on home soil. Had an amazing trip through Europe. As advised to you on WhatsApp you have been an absolute pleasure to work with. From the beginning in the planning stage to the end of our trip you were always there for us. Nothing was ever hard for you and you always answered all our questions. The cruise itself was absolutely amazing. We had an amazing group of people ranging in all age groups. The food on board was beautiful and tried foods we would not normally eat or order so it definitely opened up our taste buds. The ship was beautiful and there really isn’t anything we could change to be honest. The places we saw were beautiful and our tour guide made the right call to see the Blue Cave the day before due to weather-conditions. And she did make the right call as it was closed the day after. Overall it was better than expected so thank you again for your patience and service. We would definitely be in touch with you again in the future for hopefully another cruise somewhere in Europe. Thanks again…” SL from Australia\n\nDivine Dalmatia – Croatia Cruise June 2023\n\n“…The cruise was absolutely amazing there was nothing that was not perfect. Their attention to detail and their service was very personalized and on point. Furthermore the cleanliness in the boat was impeccable. I walked around in my white socks and they never got dirty – That tells you something! I would recommend this cruise to any of my friends. As for your planning and booking it all worked out perfectly with our transfers and everything else…” I & J D from South Africa\n\nMV Crucestar – Danube Cruise June 2023\n\n“…Good Afternoon Becky! The river cruise was fantastic. Overall, we had a great time. We have no complaints whatsoever. The organised tours were fantastic with very fluent English guides, very experienced, and we could say that they were very knowledgeable and helpful. The itinerary was well on time. I wish to highlight the exceptional cleanliness and good environment on board. The Restaurant team was very nice and well-groomed, always on the lookout for us all…” JS from Malta\n\nMS Fidelio – Danube Cruise Dec 2022\n\n“…Well where do I start! The level of service and response to my questions, queries and sadly one complaint have been dealt with promptly politely and totally professionally. I understand only too well in business some things are just beyond your control but it is how we deal with them is important. You and the rest of your company were 1st class. As far as the rest of the cruise. Every member of the staff and particularly Jessica went far and beyond just making you feel welcome but making you feel special. The restaurant staff were just fabulous and very talented as your Christmas show proved. They were particularly amazing knowing that they all must be so worried about family and friends back home. I must say I was very pleasantly surprised by both the level of service and quality of food as I have had far worse on more expensive excursions. My only suggestion would be possibly to have a coffee station in the Panorama lounge as it was the only place that internet was available and it is 580 steps from there and back to the bar ! Maybe internet in the bar would be nice as well …or maybe it would stop people actually talking to each other! The ‘singles table’ I was put on turned out to be one of the best things as I have made three new friends and know we will meet again in some corner of the world. My kindest regards to you all…” AJ From Switzerland\n\nMPS Crucevita – Rhine Cruise Sept 2022\n\n“…The pre cruise communication with Becky as excellent. Phone calls were returned, emails answered daily and all requests were promptly resolved. We had a great week. Everything went fine and we were never disappointed, as our expectations were highly met. Also, as the cruise had only 51 passengers, we were pampered quite a lot. The restaurant staff got to know us all by name. They found time to chat with us. The cabins were excellent and had ample storage space. Always spotless. As was the whole ship. In short, I would definitely book another cruise with you should the opportunity arise…” PD from Malta\n\nOne Way Wonders Croatia – July 2022\n\n“…The cruise was a great success and worth waiting for, though next time we’d choose early June rather than late July. As for feedback, all positive. The cabin was just as detailed and very comfortable; the ship’s crew/staff were all charming and always helpful; they always seemed happy and cheerful, which makes a significant difference to passengers’ enjoyment.\n\nThe ship and cabins were always kept clean and the food served with meals was a good variety, copious and well presented. The ability to swim from the ship every day was wonderful and in perfect weather and outstanding locations, little coves with very few other people, idyllic!\n\nThe tour guide was exemplary, he was extremely knowledgeable on a very wide range of subjects and delivered it all as if we were his first group, not the umpteenth! It makes each visit so much more enjoyable when the guide is not only exceptionally knowledgeable but interesting. The range of sites visited was excellent and made the cruise all that much more enjoyable.\n\nThe cruise certainly lived up to our expectations and the advertised descriptions, and we would have no hesitation in wholeheartedly recommending it (and your own service) to anyone…” CB from France\n\nDeluxe Adriatic Inspiration Croatia – Jun 2022\n\n“…The Antaris is a beautiful small ship, the cabins are well appointed and size and storage adequate. The staff carried our suitcases on board from the coach, for which we were all very grateful. As there was 18 people in our family group alone, I obviously heard quite a lot of their thoughts. They were very impressed with the ships crew and the friendliness. Sacha was very good at arranging all of our off boat scheduled activities and knew a lot of local information. We made some new friends and got along really well with the other holiday makers. I think the fact that we were able to make our own seat choices at every meal really helped in this regard. As a large group we all tried hard to include others in our conversations.\n\nWe all thought that it would have been really beneficial to have been able to pay our bar bills by credit card at the end of the trip and in this day and age could see no reason for the ship not to have this facility.\n\nI hope this has been of some help. We would all definitely do the trip again and have already recommended it to others…” AF from UK/USA\n\nMPS Crucevita – Rhine Cruise Apr 2022\n\n“…I had a wonderful time! I wish the cruise was about three nights longer. You and your company have been so helpful through this crazy time. I really appreciated you keeping me up to date with any changes. I really want to do another river cruise and would be more than happy to cruise with you again. Please keep me posted of any sales or offers select-a-cruise may have. I’m thinking for 2023. Amsterdam to Basel…” JW from USA\n\nSouthern Explorer Croatia Apr 2022\n\n“…The cruise was great!!! I’m so glad I was finally able to go after booking this in September of 2019. Your company is great!\n\nThanks again for all your help!…” JW from USA\n\nMV Crucestar – Dec 2019\n\n“…it was really good, enjoyed ourselves tremendously. Your office were informative and responded promptly to emails. Best surprise of all was the quality of the meals, presentation, taste, attention to detail. The cruise itself was well paced and interesting. Overall the staff were great, found the cleaners, cabin attendants, waitresses etc far more helpful and friendly than reception staff/ managers! Thought the public areas could have done with a bit of ‘pizazz’ but for the price it was very good. Also, telling friends about the cruise, we would like to go on something similar, 7 of us, 4 doubles and a single, this year sometime dates flexible, MUST be either the same chef or of equal standard! Danube or elsewhere?…” YS from UK\n\nMS Chernyshevsky – Aug 2019\n\n“…We’ve just returned from our cruise on Nicolai Chernyshevsky and had a marvellous time. From the word go (booking the cruise), everything was exceptional. The executives we dealt with, Julia, and later Irina, were prompt, efficient, understanding and answered my zillion questions patiently. No query was too small or insignificant for Julia. The cruise itself was fabulous! It was a true Russian experience – the documentaries, song, dance and language classes (all optional, of course), the special experiences like Vodka & Blini tasting and the tea ceremony all added to the experience. At the Vodka museum in Mandrougi, we discovered there were more than 3000 types of Vodka! And the on-board guides demonstrated the many ways of knocking back shots!! The shore excursions/visits were well planned, with excellent local guides and were a nice mix of art, history and culture. The food was amazing; such a wide variety, and delicious. While breakfast and lunch were buffet style, dinners were specially curated menus, 4-5 courses, beautifully plated, fine dining all the way… The wait staff was exceptional, quick, efficient and friendly. I celebrated my birthday on the cruise and a wonderful surprise was planned for me. Our cabins were comfortable with adequate wardrobe space. The boat itself was ship shape with many lovely spaces to relax, socialize or just enjoy the charming vistas along the way while sipping on a cocktail or a cup of tea. A special mention of our 5 very young on-board guides, ours was Kirill. Each one took care of a group of about 40 seniors. They were kind, patient and understanding and addressed a host of varied issues from dietary requirements, lost baggage, packed or delayed lunches/ dinners and transport and logistics. They served as guides, interpreters, anchors and song and dance instructors. They were simply the best. We highly recommend this cruise – we loved every minute, from start to finish. Thank you Select-a-cruise for making it possible…”\n\nJL from India\n\nDeluxe Visa Free Tour – Aug 2019\n\n“…There wasn’t any part of this experience which left us feeling anything other than complete satisfaction. From the first email contact until we finished in St Petersburg with Maria seeing us through the departure gate it was 100% customer service at its best. We are willing to say that if you need someone to get you through the visa free process and have a fabulous guide for three days in Russia the Select tour team are hard to beat. Special mention for our St Petersburg guide,Maria, for being a wonderful warm friend who shared her great depth oh Russian history and passionately spoke of her home town. Many thanks to you all…”\n\nP & T W from New Zealand\n\nGanges Cruises MV Rajmahal – Aug 2019\n\n“…I was very happy with the services you provided—very professional and timely in your responses my questions. The Ganges Cruise was handled superbly. They are extremely guest-centric in their approach. They hire sensitive crew members and all are very very well trained. They provide an authentic, unique small group experience and entire journey was thoroughly enjoyable…”\n\nDA from USA\n\nCroatia One way Wonders Cruise – Aug 2019\n\n“…That was an absolute fabulous trip and is only to be recommended :))))\n\nI have to say that this VIP cabin is well worth it as you have always a brilliant view …especially when docking side by side….I was the lucky one with a view 🙂 Simply loved it!!!!…”\n\nHB from Germany\n\nDeluxe Visa Free Tour – Aug 2019\n\n“…Thank you for arranging this tour – wow it was superb – we were absolutely delighted – all went like clockwork – the guide was outstanding and really made this tour so memorable – we enjoyed every minute and highly recommend would do it again!!!!!…”\n\nH & L B from New Zealand\n\nMS Chernyshevsky – Aug 2019\n\n“…I would like to thank Julia for all her work organising this tour for me. Everything was fabulous. The pickup drivers all arrived on time. MS Chernyshevsky was very good, the people and service excellent especially our on board guide, Kiril. The boat condition was very good. I stayed at the Budapest Hotel in Moscow which was extremely central to everything and would highly recommend it. Also the Hilton Leningradsky was right across the road from the main railway station in Moscow after I caught the high speed train from St Petersburg. All in all, I could highly recommend your company and this tour. Many thanks!…”\n\nPR from Australia\n\nMS Chernyshevsky – Aug 2019\n\n“…Hi, we just arrived home. We enjoyed the cruise very much. Cruise Staff are professional and well trained. I shall say it is one of the best cruise tour. We won’t hesitate to join another cruise again in the future. Thank you…”\n\nMY from Malaysia\n\nMS Chernyshevsky – Aug 2019\n\n“…In my name and also on behalf of my group, I must say that the cruise was very good in all aspects. Accommodation, food, guides and all other services functioned in perfection. We spent a marvellous time in Russia. In two years’ time, we will consider to work with you again in a Far East adventure…”\n\nMS (group) from Portugal\n\nStandard Visa Free Tour – Aug 2019\n\n“…We had a great trip, all very well organised and orchestrated. Kristina our guide was very knowledgeable and made the sightseeing very interesting. The only comment was that the overnight accomodation on the boat (6th floor Rm 6916) was under the disco, a little too noisy well into the night (1am). Thanks again I will surely be recommending your services to friends…”\n\nRP from Australia\n\nDeluxe Visa Free Tour – July 2019\n\n“…We had a wonderful time. The boat bettered our expectations- the meals we had were really delicious and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Our stay in St Petersburg was way beyond our expectations. The hotel was fantastic, as was our guide. The city was awesome. A truly wonderful experience- thank you…”\n\nJC from Australia\n\nMS Nizhny Novgorod – July 2019\n\n“…Thank you for managing our booking for MS Nizhny Novgorod river cruise. Your prompt response to my query is highly appreciated and recommendation for pre-cruise stay at Novotel Moscow Centre hotel is excellent. Cruise itinerary is well balance for shore excursion, relax time and on-board entertainment. Cabin is clean and staff service is perfect. We enjoyed our trip very much and give a 10 for the score card! Looking towards another trip with Select-a-Cruise…”\n\nDY from Singapore\n\nStandard Visa Free Tour – July 2019\n\n“…We are back from a fabulous trip to St. Petersburg. Such an amazing city, exceeds all expectations. Moreover, the services offered by Select Tours on ground was flawless. Maria, the guide was excellent and the driver Alexi was great too. Maria’s knowledge and enthusiasm really added to making all the sightseeing visits very interesting and informative. She was great company throughout, very friendly, jovial and helpful. When we were taken back to the port to be dropped off, the queues were so long and Maria immediately took our passports, went into the office directly and organised for our boarding documents within minutes. Thanks to her help we saved a couple of hours of queuing and the boarding process. Many thanks to you for all your help throughout the process and quick responses always. The whole process of booking and travelling was smooth and very enjoyable from start to finish. It is definitely a trip I will be recommending to clients, family and friends. Thanks once again and very best wishes,\n\nSR from UK (Travel agent)\n\nDeluxe Visa Free Tour – July 2019\n\n“…The tour was outstanding ! Our guide Julia was great, as were the drivers and vehicles. She was extremely knowledgeable and made us feel welcome. The boat was ok the cabins were dated and there wasn’t working AC in our cabin. The food was good. Helsinki processing was relatively easy, however Russia not so much. Although Julia got us past the initial long line of getting into the terminal next step was an unknown. In summary I would rate the trip a 9 out of 10 and I would recommend adding some information instructions about checking in at the terminal. I will recommend this cruise to others…”\n\nN L from USA\n\nStandard Visa Free Tour – July 2019\n\n“…The guide, Maria, was very knowledgeable, easy to talk to, and all in all a wonderful person. Driver did a nice job as well. The lady that helped me with the booking the evening before departure was very helpful and responsive. I am very happy overall with the level of customer service…”\n\nCS from USA\n\nIndependent Shore Excursions – June 2019\n\n“…We have just returned home from our Baltic Cruise with Celebrity Cruises. Part of the cruise involved a stop in St Petersburg and on our second day we booked a private tour with yourselves. It could not have gone better. We were met on time by our guide for the day – Tatiana. Perfect English and a lovely lady. The car provided was spacious and comfortable. A day programme was planned but when we explained that our sole reason for touring on the second day was to spend as much time as possible in the General Staff Building, Tatiana was able to rearrange her schedule to fall in line with this. We saw the Peter and Paul Fortress in the morning and then some time shopping. Lunch at the Grand Hotel and then to the Hermitage. We skipped the tour and went straight to the General Staff Building. We were in heaven. The worlds’s second largest collection of French impressionists was almost too much for us but we survived. We had to check a couple of times that our guide was not bored but she was lovely. We just had time to get back to the ship. A truly memorable day for us. We thank everyone at Select-a-Cruise for making this the highlight of our cruise. Kindest regards and fondest memories\n\nS F from UK\n\nStandard Visa Free Tour – June 2019\n\n“…Recently we did a tour of Saint Petersburg with your company 26th to 29th June. Our tour guide was Oksana and driver Daniel. Our tour was 10 out of 10. Oksana’s knowledge was first class and her itinerary was exceptional. The tour was the best we have ever had and we have travelled to many countries. We will be recommending your company to all our friends as the Friendliness, knowledge, English and prompt schedule from tour guide was the best we have encountered. Thanks again…”\n\nW&M H from Australia\n\nDeluxe Visa Free Tour – June 2019\n\n“…My wife and I booked a Select deluxe visa-free tour from Helsinki to St Petersburg, then to Tallinn, in June. We could not have been more delighted with our choice! From the time I first contacted Select, the communication from them was excellent. They provided clear and complete information on all aspects of the tour, including what documents we needed, where to board, and exactly what to expect. Our first face to face contact with anyone connected to Select didn’t happen until we cleared immigration control in St Petersburg, but the whole process went exactly as described, and was relatively painless. Having the priority disembarkation in St Petersburg, that was included in the deluxe package, was far more of an advantage than I would have expected, saving us fully between one and two hours of queuing up. Immediately on the other side of passport control our guide was waiting, with a Select Cruises sign. Once the other six members of our travel group gathered- another couple, and four friends travelling together- we were on our way in the very capable hands of our guide, Kristina. I have encountered more than a few guides in previous travels, and I would rank Kristina as fantastic! She is a certified guide for St Petersburg and area, and her knowledge and english skills were excellent. Reading that the maximum size of our group would be eight, I expected that we would be packed into a van with a driver-guide, but fortunately That was not the case. Our transportation throughout the tour was in an 18 passenger minibus, with a dedicated driver. The itinerary was packed during the day- we opted for the Catherine Palace and Peterhof tour on the second day in Russia- but we did have time in the two evenings to explore on our own, and managed to book tickets to the ballet through our hotel. The hotel itself was fully five star, and very well located just off Nevsky Prospekt, a minute’s walk from the canal. Even the St Peter Line ferry itself was a pleasant surprise. It’s certainly not a luxury cruise ship, but our deluxe cabins were quite comfortable and the boat had plenty to keep us entertained for our two overnight sailings. In all, I found our tour with Select Cruises to be a first class experience, and one I would recommend…”\n\nSS from Canada\n\nMS Rostropovich – June 2019\n\n“…The cruise was marvellous. The crew, the rooms, the food, the scenery and excursions, the guides and all the lectures and entertainment were more than I expected. I loved it all and will recommend this cruise very highly. The student waiters and interpreters were excellent. Lovely people. Thank you!…”\n\nSH from New Zealand\n\nMS Rostropovich – June 2019\n\n“…I have just returned from my eight day cruise from Moscow to St Petersburg on the MS Rostropovich. The cruise went way beyond my expectations, the crew were superb, the accommodation excellent, food well presented and varied and activities arranged at every port of call also excellent. I also enjoyed the Russian history lectures provided by Vladimir – a great insight into the history of the royal family. Our visit to the Kremlin and short city tour on our first day with our wonderful guide Olga was so informative and well paced. On our last day, we visited St Petersburg – a tour of the city by coach and time at the Hermitage Museum – again very good. The experience of visiting different ports, travelling through amazing locks and enjoying the company of the crew and other passengers was something very special. I certainly would recommend this cruise to everyone!!!! A wonderful week, memories forever. I hope to have the opportunity of visiting Russia again in the future. Thank you Select…”\n\nL & F M from New Zealand\n\nCroatia Dalmatian Paradise Cruise – May 2019\n\n“…We have just returned from our fabulous cruise booked through your firm , it was a wonderful experience and We would like to thank you for all your help in arranging our holiday. The ship Aquamarin was in pristine condition and our accommodation was just as you had described and arranged, the staff were all most friendly and nothing was too much trouble ,the cuisine was superb and thoroughly enjoyable particularly my wife’s allergy was well taken care of. The company of fellow passengers was well mixed and everybody got on very well together particularly as we were from diverse countries. Finally We would not hesitate to recommend your agency to any friends who wished a Croatian cruise. Thanks for your help and understanding…”\n\nC & V B from UK\n\nMPS Crucevita – May 2019\n\n“…We enjoyed the cruise from start to finish! All the emails pre-cruise were very helpful, I have no complaints about anything. Thank you for everything…”\n\nDM from Canada\n\nDeluxe Visa Free Tour – May 2019\n\n“…Hi there! The cruise went smoothly both ways. The hotel was one of the nicest that I’ve stayed in. Our tour guide for the three days, Elena, did an excellent job. We were very happy with everything. Thanks!!\n\nPC from Canada\n\nDeluxe Visa Free Tour – May 2019\n\n“…The pre-tour service from Julia was absolutely excellent. Her communications were clear and complete. During the tour, our private tour guide was Elena Timokhina. Elena did a fabulous job… she was knowledgeable, informative, and organized. And your drivers were friendly and excellent as well. I would give Elena a top 5-star rating and enthusiastically recommend her to any of my friends or acquaintances that may travel to St. Petersburg. Truly she made the trip even better than we expected. Elena and Julia are the reason that I would give your tour company a high rating. Also our 5-star hotel was excellent and in a great location, so that was all very good! However, the ferry ride itself was slightly disappointing. I would give it a 2 or 3 star rating. The ship décor and entertainment needs updating in my opinion. The younger entertainers were talented but the material was not very interesting. The food was good but the wait staff was not very friendly. We had a deluxe suite that was supposed to include WiFi, but there was no band width to the WiFi (i.e. we could get connected but not google or download any information). So I think the cruise part of the tour could be improved upon. I hope this is helpful, constructive feedback. We very much enjoyed our time in St. Petersburg!…”\n\nSS from USA\n\nStandard Visa Free Tour – May 2019\n\n“…The tour guides in St Petersburg and Tallinn were excellent – please pass on our thanks for their very thorough and enjoyable tours. The hotels were very good. The ferries were not that good – the cabins were rather shabby – and getting off was like queuing in a winter sale. The experience on a whole was very good and if not for the ferries excellent. Your schedules worked out perfectly. Really impressed – I will definitely be looking at your tours for next year…”\n\nPR from UK\n\nDeluxe Visa Free Tour – May 2019\n\n“…We loved everything. The accommodations were fantastic. Both tour guides were knowledgeable and shared so much with us. Transportation ran smoothly and no delays. Would recommend upgrading to Commodore. It was well worth the money. Thank you for a wonderful experience…”\n\nRK from USA\n\nMS Chernyshevsky – May 2019\n\n“…Our trip was excellent, Katya and Nastya made our trip extraordinary. They were attentive, courteous and went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of. We went in 2017 to Budapest, Hungary and Germany with Viking and it was nice. But this trip by far passed our expectations. The hands-on attention, cleanliness of ship, food and staff surpassed Viking by a stretch. Thank you for a wonderful trip and thank you again Katya and Nastya for your care and assistance – you made the difference thank you…”\n\nMO from USA\n\nMS Chernyshevsky – May 2019\n\n“…I am back in Canada after a very satisfying cruise experience. Your preparatory assistance and counsel was most useful and the actual cruise surpassed my expectations. I enjoyed every minute and also all the excursions. I made allowances for the tour company being Russian with slightly different definitions of entertainment and food. All in all the cruise surpassed my expectations and I am happy to recommend both your services and the cruise. Russia and particularly the two big cities we also visited has so much to offer. I really enjoyed every minute of the waterways and scenery. I will mention the cruise guide Katya as a very attentive and professional coordinator looking after all the persons assigned to her, very pleasantly and professionally…”\n\nBN from Canada\n\nStandard Visa Free Tour – May 2019\n\n“…this reply is brief because we were extremely happy with the tour and all the organisation associated with it. This includes the tour guides who were on time and most professional and informative. The only painful experience was the Russian passport control which was soooo slow but this is obviously totally out of the control of the tour. We would highly recommend the tour to others. Thanks for the professionalism of all involved…”\n\nIP from NZ\n\nCroatia One way Wonders Cruise – April 2019\n\n“…our trip was terrific it was above our expectations well organised from start to finish. We certainly enjoyed our tour guide Stano and Neno the senior staff person so accommodating kind funny professional. That great staff adds a bonus. Maybe we would suggest a change of swimming stops in early season when it is cool / cold water for another activity, (not always easy) as vessel cannot land easy in some ports early…”\n\nF & M K from Australia\n\nStandard Visa Free Tour – April 2019\n\n“…My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our time on the MS Princess Anastasia, and our visa-free tour of the beautiful city of St. Petersburg. The experience on the ship was extraordinary and unforgettable, including many excellent meals and very helpful staff. Sailing through the broken ice as we neared Russia was especially amazing! When we arrived in St. Petersburg, we were greeted by our tour guide named Olga, and she made our time in the city very enjoyable, educational and special. Olga’s knowledge of the city was astounding, and she supplemented the historic facts with personal details and anecdotes that really helped us to understand the city in a profound and more meaningful way. Our drivers were also very professional and helpful. This was our first time ever visiting Russia, and we REALLY loved this trip. We will certainly recommend Select Tours & Cruises to our friends in the United States…”\n\nJ & B J from USA\n\nStandard Visa Free Tour – April 2019\n\n“…We have been very satisfied in every way. All practical things worked well. You have also followed me up in a good way. I felt that you had control, and you had! You have delivered!!!…”\n\nMA from Norway\n\nStandard Visa Free Tour – April 2019\n\n“…Your pre tour service was excellent. St Petersburg was fantastic and the guides and hotel were great. The Princess Anastasia was a bit of a let down as our shower rarely got to warm let alone hot and the entertainment appeared to come straight out of the 80s. Apart from the ship everything else was great and I would recommend the tour to others….”\n\nAG from Australia\n\nStandard Visa Free Tour – November 2018\n\n“…We had a great time in St Petersburg. The pre-travel arrangements were very efficient and our time in St Petersburg was fantastic. We had a fabulous guide (Maria) who made everything so interesting. The hotel was also very good as was the boat trip. We would recommend it to others. Thank you…”\n\nC & AW from Australia\n\nMS Chernyshevsky – September 2018\n\n“…Other than the weather, the trip was excellent.

From making the enquiry, your staff could not have been more helpful, particularly Masha who guided me through the requirements making the whole process so very easy and meeting all the extensions I wanted for this very special VISA FREE visit to St. Petersburg and Estonia. My family came back buzzing, saying it was the best city holiday EVER, an experience they will never forget, everything being so fantastically arranged by SELECT and your Tour Guides were the icing on the cake !!!! Please pass on our thanks to everyone for making this dream visit come true…”\n\nCB from UK\n\nIndia Lower Ganges Cruise – August 2018\n\n“…This was a wonderful experience.

There was plenty to entertain on board if you wished and staff most helpful. Would certainly recommend…”\n\nLM from UK\n\nCroatia Dalmatian Highlights Cruise – July 2018\n\n“…I enjoyed my trip immensely !! Was fantastic.

Thanx so much…”\n\nAB from USA\n\nMS Chernyshevsky – June 2018\n\n“…We would like to thank everyone on board for an absolute amazing cruise. The cabin was well equipped and everything was kept neat and tidy by the cabin attendants. The food was well prepared, well presented and tasteful. All personnel on board were helpful and friendly. We had an amazing tour operational manager that went out of her way to make sure we had a good time. All excursions was well planned and organised. Local guides were knowledgeable and communicated well. Anastasia is a next level host for whom personal attention to detail comes naturally. She was amazing from day one until she saw us off after the cruise. Thank you for the good weather as well, it was most enjoyable 😄…”\n\nEV from South Africa\n\nCroatian Rhapsody land Tour and Dubrovnik Discovery Croatia cruise – September 2019\n\n“…Just a quick note about my tour to Croatia, Slovenia and Montenegro. From my first contact with Becky then Irina you impressed me so much with your efficiency and attention to detail, explaining all the arrangements and confirming them all the way through. Our guide Bart in Slovenia was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and showed us some out of the way places not listed on the itinerary. In Croatia for the Croatian Rhapsody tour and the Dubrovnik Discovery cruise everything ran like clockwork, our driver and tour guide for the Croatian Rhapsody was Zoron who treated us all like friends, showing us the beautiful scenery and organising everything perfectly. Our Dubrovnik Discovery cruise was also amazing, stopping at one spectacular port after another. The crew worked tirelessly to make sure we all had the best possible time. I will certainly be contacting you again when I’m ready for my next trip and will recommend you to all my friends. Thanks so much for a wonderful holiday…”\n\nDC from Australia\n\nStandard Visa Free Tour – September 2018\n\n“…The tour was easy to find on the internet and research. Bookings on the internet, replies to queries and documentation all went like clockwork and made visiting St Petersburg easy. Boat accommodation was what we expected and instructions for getting to ferry, documents needed and tour inclusions were all easy to follow and thorough. While some immigration procedures were rather lengthy it is important to realise that we are visiting sovereign nations with their own rules. The hotel Sokos Vasilevsky was very comfortable and convenient for independent excursions. Our two guides Julia and Maria were really excellent, great English and eager to make our stay enjoyable. St Petersburg itself was truly incredible: it was a wonderful experience and we are so glad we took this opportunity. With thanks!…”\n\nA and A L from Australia\n\nStandard Visa Free Tour – August 2018\n\n“…We have just returned to UK. YOUR tour of St Petersburg was excellent. We had 2 guides who were very knowledgeable and looked after us very well indeed. The Hotel was also excellent. We were glad that there was free time too during the tours. We would recommend your company and were surprised that you have very few clients from the UK on this tour…”\n\nD and S B from UK\n\nStandard Visa Free Tour – August 2018\n\n“…The hotel and tour guides/drivers were exceptional. The boat itself, just okay rooms. Pretty dated but sufficient for the overnight travels. Thanks…”\n\nBG from USA\n\nDeluxe Visa Free Tour – August 2018\n\n“…Our whole journey went very well. The ferry suite was excellent, the food onboard as well. We were very happy with the Kempinski Hotel in Saint Petersburg, and Marie, our guide, couldn’t have been better. We will definitely recommend your company to our friends who may follow us to Helsinki. Thank you for organizing all this for us…”\n\nR & S S from USA\n\nCroatia Dalmatian Paradise Cruise – August 2018\n\n“…Our Croatian Cruise was perfect and we enjoyed every bit of it. The boat accommodations was excellent. The captain and the rest of the crew were all friendly, happy and attended to our needs and Spazzo was exceptional. He explained where we were and always there for us. Our tour manager was very knowledgeable. The meals in the boat was fantastic and very delicious. The islands visited & the stops for a swim was perfect & enjoyable. Croatia is for sure the garden of Europe and I’ll be encouraging my friends to come & visit. As for me, I’m already planning to visit the second time…”\n\nS C from Saudi Arabia\n\nHistoric Lower Ganges Cruise – August 2018\n\n“…This was a wonderful experience.

I wanted to send a note of thanks for the professionalism and patience you showed in helping sort out the last minute changes. The cruise we took, Dalmatian Paradise, was excellent. We felt well looked after by the tour guide (who actually was supposed to be on the Northern Gems himself) and we enjoyed the itinerary. Other than the worry and hassle caused by the late change, we have no disappointment with what we ended up doing. Thank you again for working with me to correct what could have been a nasty situation. Your willingness to help and professional approach helped save the day … and the holiday…” (MS Futura)\n\nM L from USA\n\nCroatia Dalmatian Highlights Cruise – June 2018\n\n“…I enjoyed my trip immensely !!

The pre – cruise service was efficient offering us a cruise at the standard and price and dates that were best for us with timely communication . The cruise itself was fabulous . The boat was brand new and had excellent facilities . The cruise program and food were most enjoyable and the crew kind and helpful . Our only suggestion for improvement would be a place to dry our swimsuits / swimming towels and provision of some sort of laundry facilities . Thank you for booking us on such a wonderful holiday . We will certainly use Select again should we be looking for another cruise in the future…” (MV Ave Maria)\n\nM and S S from New Zealand\n\nCroatia Dalmatian Paradise Cruise – June 2018\n\n“…Hi we enjoyed the cruise very much .

Thanks again for a lovely experience…” (MS Futura)\n\nRS from Australia\n\nCroatia Dalmatian Paradise Cruise – June 2018\n\n“…The cruise, the preparations, the on and off-board services were excellent and I gladly recommend your services to friends. We had our big family reunion of 17 on board and for us this was unique because our children live all over the world and even though they meet with us, they rarely meet all three with their families together. This was the best occasion and being taken care of in all details, much time was available to meet. Aida did a great job with her attention to details, her deep knowledge of history, culture and politics. She was always available for more. The kitchen and staff were such an important part of vacation and we were surprised at what could be achieved in small quarters with diets and 4 course meals. Rooms were tidied up and safety was well protected. The daily city tours and swimming in open waters, the high jumps, the chances to go jet-ski, kite boarding and the hot jacuzzi on our deck were all beyond expectations…” (MS Futura)\n\nPV from USA\n\nCroatia Adriatic Explorer Cruise – June 2018\n\n“…Most enjoyable. Let me know what you have for mid next year for the northern part of Croatia/Slovenia – 5-7 days – Black Swan?…” (MS Fantazija)\n\nSM from South Africa\n\nMS Chernyshevsky – May 2018\n\n“…Our Russian River Cruise via Select Tours and Cruises, can be described in one word: SUPERB. We dealt with three different agents during the initial booking, Ekaterina Sevostyanikhina, Becky Coulter and Carolyn Penney. The service from these three agents was simply excellent. All queries were responded to immediately and efficiently. We cannot thank these ladies enough. We arrived in Moscow one day early and stayed an extra day in St. Petersburg, on both occasions the hotel accommodation was excellent as were the prearranged transfers. The complete cruise including itinerary, cabin, food, excursions both with the cruise and additional, were very well organised. Our group guide Anastasia, was fantastic. She dealt with our involvement in the cruise in a cool, capable and informative manner.\n\nWe both consider your product was excellent value. Thank you to the Select organisation for a wonderful trip…”\n\nD and S C from Australia\n\nMS Chernyshevsky – May 2018\n\n“…We are writing this very belated note to extend our thanks to you and the entire staff for organizing such a wonderful trip for us to Russia – St Petersburg to Moscow May 10-22, 2018. Where to begin? Foremost, you did say that you were glad that your colleague Anastasia would be our guide on board the MS Chernyshevsky, and she was charming, personable, organized, and very concerned that Damian would be able to get the most out of the trip with his walker and cane, and that Susan would not have to worry so much because we were in such good hands. Anastasia and Sergey (who was on board with the Vodohod Company) both made sure that we were well taken care of. Of course we are very grateful to you for arranging our stay at the Golden Triangle Hotel for May 10-12, and for our driver Vadim and our guide Timur who took us to the Russian State Museum, the Hermitage, and the Faberge collection. We wish that we were better able to converse in Russian, but found everyone to be kind, courteous, and patient. Our experience at Customs both in St Petersburg and Moscow could not have gone any better. The airport staff was wonderful in both cities. In St Petersburg, Vadim made sure we did not have to worry about anything, and Timur was the perfect guide in all three museums: knowledgeable, interesting, and smoothing the way for us to avoid lines and crowds. Timur even recommended a small vegetarian restaurant near our hotel just off Nevsky Prospect, and it was clear to us that he wanted to share his love of St Petersburg. We were exposed to a wide range of Russian culture and history, enhancing our trip. Please extend our thanks to him, and make sure to let him know that we highly recommend him to all your prospective future clients. Vadim and Timur made sure we got on the boat safely, and we appreciated that your colleague from the St. Petersburg office visited us at our cabin. On board ship, our cabin was comfortable, the food very good, the ship crew was warm and friendly, and all the excursions and guides were delightful. We especially enjoyed Alex in St Petersburg and at the Peterhof, and Oxsana in Moscow. The guide Alex in Yaroslavl is very fond of his native city, and we very much liked the tour and dance in the Governors Mansion. We liked the cultural presentations on the tea service, food traditions, and Anastasia’s lessons in the Russian language, and we will include our diplomas as part of our CVs (Just kidding!). We were very impressed with how hard everyone worked (including the tour bus drivers, who made sure that Damian’s walker was within reach at all times). Our driver from the boat to the Moscow airport was very conscientious. Anastasia had called Aeroflot prior to our departure, and the driver had us wait while he checked in with the Special Assistance Desk, brought out a luggage cart and a porter with a wheelchair for Damian. Anastasia also insisted that we email her when we arrived home! We would be pleased to recommend this trip and your company to our friends and family. We hope that Anastasia, our guides, the staff and crew enjoyed being with us as much as we did with them.\n\nAgain, we want to thank you for your patience and assistance.\n\nIt was a pleasure to work with you. All the best…”\n\nS and D N from USA\n\nMS Chernyshevsky – May 2018\n\n“…We thoroughly enjoyed our cruise on the MS Chernyshevsky. The service was excellent, the tours were interesting, the food was good.I think the lunch buffet was a little chaotic, as the area where the main courses were served was a bit small for the large crowd. Wifi was sporadic and that was a bit of a problem–but I guess it is good to disconnect occasionally. Please thank our tour leaders Anastasia and Serghey, who were both very helpful and always pleasant. I enjoyed seeing the small towns between St. Petersburg and Moscow. Beautiful and interesting. I learned a lot about Russian history. Also, thank you for the perfect weather!..”\n\nLE from USA\n\nVisa Free Tour – May 2018\n\n“…we want to congratulate you for your effort to make our trip to St. Petersburg so pleasant and so memorable. Great selection of the hotels in Helsinki and St.Petersburg. Have to mention our driver and very knowledgeable guide. Both with great personalities which made our daily tasks very enjoyable. Great trip, great organization and we would not hesitate to recommend your company to anyone.We will definitely spread a good word about your organization in Canada.\n\nThank you again for the great time we experienced in St. Petersburg…”\n\nM and L J from Canada\n\nCroatia One way Wonders Cruise – May 2018\n\n“…The cruise was more than we expected and we had a most enjoyable time.

The boat was exactly as expected however the staff exceeded our expectations – they were truly amazing. So hospitable and accommodating. They really made the cruise an enjoyable experience. The only thing I would comment negatively is that it would have been nice to spend a little longer in some of the places. But I appreciate that is difficult due to time it takes to get to each one. Would definitely do something like this again…”\n\nLB from UK\n\nDubrovnik Discovery – May 2018\n\n“…I think this was one of the best holidays I have ever been on! The captain and crew of Pape Prve made it an unforgettable experience. The communication and organisation from Select Tours was good, many thanks. The information we received was as needed. Our party found the boat easily and were welcomed aboard by a representative. The itinerary itself was wonderful. The only comment I could make, is that I would have liked a little more time on each island, and a little less time sailing to each (which would have been possible if swimming stops were shorter). The boat was basic but fulfilled all our needs. The other travellers on board were very easy to get along with and soon became friends. Throughout the tour, Yelena and the team made our holiday perfect. They were accessible, communicated well, helpful and great fun. Even our awkward dietary requirements were met without complaint. In fact, considering the size of the kitchen, the cook managed exceedingly well. I would highly recommend this tour to other travellers. Thank you…”\n\nJD from UK\n\nMS Rostropovich – May 2018\n\n“…It was good talking with you on Saturday, especially about our River Cruise. It was just plain wonderful! The staff, accommodations, meals, classes, entertainment, and shore excursions were just right…”\n\nC M from USA\n\nVisa Free Tour – May 2018\n\n“…Christina and Daniel were outstanding as guide and driver. The sites we visited were awesome and we never felt rushed. The commentary was interesting and Christina spoke clearly with beautiful English. The ferry was fun and provided a wonderful breakfast. We easily found something for dinner too. Unfortunately our room was quite hot enroute to St. Petersburg and the communication system in the room was broken. It was cooler going to Tallinn. However, we would definitely give the tour trip a perfect 10. 😊 …”\n\nE & H J from USA\n\nDeluxe Visa Free Tour – May 2018\n\n“…I am happy to provide feedback related to our recent trip to St Petersburg and Tallinn. My wife and I were somewhat cautious about visiting Russia but felt totally reassured by Select Tours in advance. Every aspect of the tour was excellent and exactly as described in the various literature in advance. The Mobyline ferry, Princess Anastasia, from Helsinki and then to Tallinn was fine – punctual and efficient. The Commodore cabin was OK, if a bit tired, but clean and functional. We appreciated the double bed and the mini-bar. Champagne breakfast on board was excellent in the New York Restaurant. (As was dinner the night before at our own expense.) Priority disembarkation worked efficiently, with no queuing, but some embarrassment for us seeing all the other passengers waiting to begin the process. Similarly on our return to the ship on the last day. Our guide, Olga, was visible to meet us through customs and provided clear, structured, entertaining and informative guidance throughout the three days. The three day itinerary was very good, with a reasonable balance between structured visits to iconic sites and free time. The mini-bus provision with own driver was excellent. Features such as providing secure space for luggage on the first and last day in the city, being whisked across the city and out into the countryside providing a chance to get a wider perspective of the Russian way of life beyond the honey-pot down town tourist centre, the pre-purchased privileged tickets, enabling avoidance of almost all queuing except at the Faberge museum, were all important and valued features. There were only 8 of us (4 couples) on the trip, as predicted in the literature. The was an important feature in our decision to book with Select Tours. Clearly well-briefed, Olga maintained a good pace through the various palaces, museums and cathedrals, giving us incisive insights into the relevant history yet allowing just enough time to pause and reflect individually. One issue for improvement would be to build in time for toilet and coffee stops. She was very reluctant to pause for such events. It seems the ‘coffee culture’ of western Europe has not registered with her yet. Half an hour for lunch on the second and third days would have been appreciated. The Hotel Kempinski was very good overall and fully warranted its five star category. Location was perfect, service was excellent as was breakfast and support from all the staff. The room was good, with well furnished and presented facilities, but not outstanding with poor outlook from the internal window overlooking the glass domed atrium. We opted not to take the city tour in Tallinn, recognising the intimate nature of the medi-eval city and believing your walking tour to be over-priced. This proved a good decision for us and was endorsed by two of the other couples we met by chance during our time in Tallinn. Overall I would thoroughly recommend Select Tours for a smooth, professional experience where the reality easily met if not exceeded the prior information…”\n\nM & J K from UK\n\n*Managers note: Lovely to receive more positive feedback from our customers.\n\nFor readers, please note we offer only an Inclusive Package in Tallinn, which includes;\n\n2 nights in hotel, daily breakfast, transfer from ferry to hotel, 1 x 2 hour walking tour with private guide. Price €195 per person.\n\nDeluxe Visa Free Tour – May 2018\n\n“…Just a line to say that the cruise is going very well. Nice cabin and good service on the boat, excellent arrangements in St. Petersburg including the hotel and the guide, Olga. Actually, my Commodore cabin on Level 6 is quiet, but some of the guests who were with me on the shore tour said that their Deluxe cabins on Level 8 were quite noisy because of people drinking and talking loudly in the open decks outside. Just thought I would pass it on to you as feedback. Hoping for a smooth passage back to Tallinn.\n\nYour prompt and clear responses persuaded me to embark on this cruise ,and I would like to thank you. I will certainly write a good review on TripAdvisor and recommend this cruise to my friends. ”\n\nJA from Singapore\n\nDeluxe Visa Free Tour – May 2018\n\nThank you Irina.

We had a great time on our trip to St Petersburg – everything was well organised and the tour guide Ekaterina was exceptional.

We would definitely recommend this tour to others…”\n\nCF from Canada\n\nDeluxe Visa Free Tour – Apr 2018\n\n“…I am writing to give you my comments on the visa-free travel from Helsinki to St.Petersburg and Tallinn. The instructions of Select Tour and Cruises before the travel were very explicit and gave enough details about the trip. Invoicing was accurate and done in due time. The ferry trip went very smooth and met our expectations – easy to check-in, right on schedule, clean cabin and good food. In St. Petersburg we were welcomed by Olga, a very friendly and efficient guide who took very good care of the group. The visits to Hermitage, Faberge Museum and the several cathedrals went smooth and we learned a lot about their history. The driver was also very supportive and always on time. The chosen hotel – Kempinski Moika was very nicely located with friendly staff and excellent facilities. We had enough time to stroll around the city on our own and explore local food and culture. Thanks to the good service provided by Select Tours and Cruises, we spent lovely days with no issues whatsoever and good memories. Many thanks!..”\n\nEG from Bulgaria\n\nVisa Free Tour – Apr 2018\n\n“…I was impressed both by the pre information and the tour itself.

I would like to give you positive and negative feedback:\n\nPOSITIVE:\n\nNeat clean safe ship, Bellejour.\n\nVery nice cabin with very good cleaning service.\n\nExcellent food with good service from chef and okay service from waiter.\n\nExcellently planned route and times allocated in places.\n\nGood price for what you receive.\n\nFriendly staff\n\nNEGATIVE:\n\nWe were not part of a group and felt a bit left out. I think Arty (cruise director) could have made us feel much more included. He was luke warm and sometimes even short tempered.\n\nEntertainment was not up to scratch. I found the staff concert underwhelming and unprofessional, bit embarrassing. Why no professional entertainment from locals at ports where we docked.? Even just every second night.\n\nThe wifi thing is stupid.

Thanks to all the staff from receptionists and all the rest of the crew, we had a marvellous holiday preparing for our 50th Wedding anniversary which comes on the 28th April. It was our beginning of our celebrations and sure it was a marvelous idea which comes true with our recent cruise on MS BELLEJOUR.

We had such a good time and were well looked after all the way…”\n\nPW from UK\n\nVisa Free St Petersburg – Nov 2017\n\n“…Thank you so much for our wonderful tour. I will start by saying that the whole trip went without a hitch. From the very start of my communication with your company, I was given all the necessary information I needed to make this trip a success. The communication I received via email was excellent, and all questions I asked were answered promptly and clearly. We stayed at the Solo Sokos Hotel Vasilievsky, which was all arranged for us. On our arrival, after our overnight ferry trip, our Guide Maria met us, and along with only another 2 travellers, were taken to the Faberge museum. This was outstanding. The transport used was a Mercedes people carrier, most comfortable. From the Faberge museum, Maria dropped us of at the hotel. The hotel itself was perfect in every way for us. The breakfast offered everything we could have asked for. The staff there were so helpful. We were able to book tickets for the Ballet at a kiosk in the hotel. In the evening we were able to walk to a nearby pedestrianised street where there were restaurants and shops. Our pre planned tours to the Hermitage/winter palace, Catherine’s palace, Pavlovsk Palace and the Peter and Paul Fortress on our last day, were amazing. Although we were collected every day at the hotel to go to these places of great interest, we were still able to have free time later in the afternoon and the evening to spend in St Petersburg. As we both walked everywhere to see the sights and absorb the atmosphere of the city, we never once felt threatened or uncomfortable walking in the streets or going into restaurants or cafes. I will say that the only part of the journey which was not so wonderful, was the ferry trip from Helsinki to St Petersburg on the Princess Anastasia. This is in no way a reflection on Select a Tour and Cruise. It is the way it has to be done to get the 72 hour free visa. The ferry itself is basic, and the hours spent before sailing and disembarking seemed such a waste of time, although I know this was necessary. There was only one small café opened on the ferry at these times, and with so many people on board, it could not always cope. The cabin on the ferry was extremely basic, and we had no hot water to take a shower on the morning of our arrival in St Petersburg. Had it been a modern ferry with good facilities, it would have made the ferry trip a pleasure. This would not however stop me making a similar trip in the future. We enjoyed every minute of our trip, and would have no hesitation in recommending this company to others. We felt our trip was made more special due to our Guide Maria and our taxi driver, who’s name I have forgotten. Both were so accommodating and pleasant. Please convey my sincere thanks to them both…”\n\nCY from UK\n\nVisa Free Tour to St Petersburg – Sept 2017\n\n“…I would like to say a big thank you for the excellent organisation of this tour. From booking to the time we arrived back in Helsinki, everything was made clear and all went to plan. The tours covered all that you would want to see in St Petersburg and our guide Olga was very informative and helpful. My family and I enjoyed our stay and would most certainly recommend your company to our friends. Thank you…”\n\nJW from UK\n\nMS Tolstoy – Sept 2017\n\n“…We thoroughly enjoyed our cruise tour. The booking and arrangement for transfers worked well. We appreciated the clear instructions and prompt support when arrival and departure times were changed. We thought the cruise was good value with comfortable clean accommodation, very good food (I’m sure we’ve put on weight), well organised mix of excursions both included and optional. Our on board tour guide looked after us very well. We would certainly recommend Select a Cruise to our friends and encourage them to look at taking a river cruise in Russia.\n\nThank you. It has been a memorable trip of a lifetime for us…”\n\nL and RM from NZ\n\nMS Select Explorer Danube Cruise – Sept 2017\n\n“…The cruise was perfect in any and all aspects, starting with Masha’s service.

We had a very nice time cruising with you. It was fantastic & we will surely do it again sooner or later. The crew were all fantastic especially our tour guide Anastasia. Thank you so much for making my 50th birthday a very memorable one indeed…”\n\nJ & EK from Australia\n\nMS Bellejour – Aug 2017: and MS Select Explorer Danube Cruise – Sept 2017\n\n“…we had 2 great trips. The better was the Amsterdam to Basel. Many beautiful towns. Both boats were good. food excellent. Many thanks for the 2 bottles of wine, went down well.\n\nCabins perfect, had suite on Explorer, well worth the extra. Please convey our thanks to Masha, she did a great job.\n\nCheers…”\n\nB & MV from NZ\n\nMS Rostropovich – Aug 2017\n\n“…my recent cruise on the MS Rostropovich was very enjoyable. The ship was of first class standard, cabin sufficient for our needs. Staff were friendly and efficient – nothing was too much of a problem for them. Tours were interesting and tour guides extremely knowledgeable. Food was not always to my liking i.e. lacked sauces/herbs/spices etc. but was sufficient and well presented. It was necessary for me to visit the doctor daily. The doctor unfortunately did not speak English, but she was extremely caring and very professional. Overall I enjoyed my stay onboard and the onshore excursions and would certainly recommend both the cruise and your company…”\n\nBW from Australia\n\n“…We had a very enjoyable 6-day group visa free ferry/land tour (August 13-August 21, 2017) to St. Petersburg. Wish we had more than 72 hours on land to explore and enjoy the magnificent city of St. Petersburg. Our guide Olga and the driver were very helpful and professional. Our hotel was very centrally located, walkable to the major sights, shops and restaurants. The breakfasts in the ferry and at the hotel were very good. Everything was arranged perfectly by Select-a-cruise. Our pre-tour help provided by Ms. Masha Fatima and Ms. Irina was excellent. Overall we had a very positive experience! Thanks very much!…”\n\nR & ML from USA\n\nMS Select Explorer Danube Cruise – Aug 2017\n\n“…We really enjoyed the Danube Cruise. The crew was very helpful and always courteous especially Gunnar, always a gentleman, Zoland, knowledgeable about everything that pertained to our cruise, and Elena, the sweetest girl in reception .Thank you for a wonderful week…”\n\nMC from USA\n\n6 Day Visa Free St Petersburg – Aug 2017\n\n“…Visiting St Petersburg was a fascinating and amazing experience. We saw more grandeur than we’ve ever seen anywhere else; I’m sure the Romanov’s wanted that comparison to be made! Our tour guide, Olga, was very knowledgeable and helpful, not only with the tour sights themselves but also with finding restaurants etc. The hotel was comfortable, and handily placed allowing us an easy walk into the centre. We enjoyed it very much…”\n\nSE from UK\n\nDeluxe Adriatic Cruise Split to Split – July 2017\n\n“…Thank you for booking us on the MS Emanuel, at first we did not know what to expect since there were not really any reviews of the boat. We were also ready to spend twice the amount on a boat that was rated higher. We definitely made the right choice, the boat is extremely clean, rooms were made spotless every day. The crew is very accommodating and informative, it was like travelling with friends. The cook is a real gem, every meal was delicious and there was plenty of food. When we docked we were able to walk through the more expensive ships and the difference was their flooring was newer but rooms really weren’t bigger.\n\nMy wife and I again would like to thank you 😊 …”\n\nSF from USA\n\nMS Chernyshevsky – July 2017\n\n“…Just a short note to say thank you for all your help. The booking experience with you and select cruise was exceptional All transfers and pick ups in Russia were perfect,all drivers arrived early were very nice and managed to understand us a bit.All cars were in Excellent condition. The cruise was Excellent, cabin we had was perfect, the only thing is we were a bit disappointed with was the food, there was plenty to eat but was bland, possibly as it was typical Russian would have been nice to have a few western dishes every few days. The boats excursions were great,The optional extra excursions were so expensive we did them on our own at 3/4 the price, possibly the cruise co. should consider reducing their prices.We stopped at 2 islands on cruise to St Petersburg they were both interesting with traditional houses etc, but were much the same selling all tourist goods. Could have spent the extra time in Moscow. Your select cruise representative Anastasia was exceptional, spoke very good English,very informative and had a good knowledge of Russian cultures. She went the extra mile on helping us with our own little tours. All in all we had a wonderful holiday in Russia and on board your cruise. Once again thank you Becky for all your help and advise and answering all our e mails which must have been at least 25 …”\n\nRS from UK\n\nMS Chernyshevsky – July 2017:\n\n“…Hello, I have just come back from our cruise holiday in Russia and I would like to thank you for all your support and help. We had one of the best holiday ever, Everything was just amazing. Very good organisation, quality and comfort. I am very satisfied with everything and I am sure I will go via your agency again in the future. Many thanks, Have a lovely day…”\n\nIV from UK\n\n6 Day Visa Free St Petersburg – June 2017\n\n“…It had been my dream for many years to visit St Petersburg and now that dream has been realised. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to this amazing city. The itinerary was excellent covering the main highlights of St Petersburg in 72 hours in a reasonably relaxed fashion. The optional tours I chose (Summer Palace and Peterhof) were excellent and well-worth the additional cost. Our tour guide was very informative and organised, ensuring that our schedule was adhered to. As a native of St Petersburg, he clearly has a deep knowledge of the city’s history and culture, and has great pride in the city. I particularly appreciated travelling in a very small group. This allowed us to get to know each other and share some extraordinary experiences. Most importantly, the small group size allowed many opportunities for us to ask questions, which our tour guide answered comprehensively. The Solo Sokos Vasilievsky Hotel, located on the other side of the Neva River to the Hermitage, was very comfortable, clean and provided good guest service. Although the hotel wasn’t located near Nevsky Prospect, it was a 30-40 minute walk to the Hermitage. The only aspect of the tour which I wasn’t impressed with is the ferry trip from Helsinki. The ferry journey is quite long, and you need to spend additional time on the ferry while in the Port of St Petersburg in order to comply with the conditions of a visa-free visit. In addition, I found the cabins on the ferry very basic and cramped. Nevertheless, I’m very glad I chose a visa-free tour to St Petersburg, avoiding the hassle of applying for a visa, and that I chose Select Tour. In my initial research, I found the Select Tours website the most detailed in terms of itinerary, ferry schedules, costs, etc. Moreover, in telephone conversations and e-mail correspondence, I found the Select Tour staff to be very responsive to my requests, thorough in the information they provided, professional and courteous…”\n\nMP from Australia\n\n6 Day Visa Free St Petersburg – June 2017\n\n“…We had a wonderful time and would like to thank you for organising this excellent tour to St Petersburg. Everything went very smoothly exactly as you described. Olga the guide whisked us in to the museums past very long queues and explained everything clearly but she was not pushy or overbearing and she provided lots of interesting extra detail on life in St Petersburg from her own personal experience. We were the only two to opt for the tour of Peterhof and the Summer Palace so we had individual service which was incredibly good value.We felt it was the perfect mix of an independent visit as we had plenty of time to do our own thing (the ballet and travelling by Metro for example ) and an organised tour.The crossing on the Princess Anastasia was very enjoyable and trouble free. I honestly cannot think of any criticisms and I would recommend this tour to anyone as a fantastic opportunity to visit a fascinating city. With best wishes to all your staff…”\n\nCD from UK\n\nMS Bellejour – June 2017\n\n“…A very nice cruise,comfortable room,great staff and lovely food and places to visit.Just a couple of suggestions,I think there could be two sittings for dinner in the evening because the dinner was quite early and maybe more buffet style lunches so less staff would be needed…”\n\nE and K from Spain and UK\n\n6 Day 5 star Visa Free St Petersburg – June 2017\n\n“…I would like to say how much we enjoyed the trip. The organisation was great and we had excellent support before we sailed. Documentation arrived promptly and queries dealt with in a helpful and efficient manner. The hotel in Saint Petersburg was very comfortable although security was high because of the football event in the city. Our guide was exceptional, I couldn’t praise her enough. She was extremely knowledgeable, and looked after us very well. We managed to see so much in a very short time and we were pleased we had chosen the extra excursions. The boat itself was a ferry, fairly basic and with staff who seemed exceptionally disorganised but comfortable enough, if seen as a way to get from A to B it was fine as a cruise it was perhaps a disappointment…”\n\nJG from UK\n\n6 Day Visa Free St Petersburg – June 2017\n\n“…We really enjoyed our trip to St Petersburg. Everything went exactly according to plan, and the itinerary was excellent (including the optional tours). Our guide, Andrei, was wonderful. He had very clear English, was very knowledgeable, and looked after us very well. Thank you!…”\n\nS and B D from New Zealand\n\n4 Day Visa Free St Petersburg – June 2017\n\n“…We had a great time on the cruise and visit to St. Petersburg. We especially liked our tour guide, Marie. She was great and made our first day really nice. Without her, we would not have known where to even begin, so it was a big plus to start things off with her. The hotel was very nice and the beds were wonderful. Best hotel of our whole trip. This had nothing to do with your company, but it’s too bad the process to get through immigration from boat to Russian side isn’t a little smoother. Poor Marie had to wait almost 2 hours for us to get through the huge lines. I know you have no control over that part. Again, we had a wonderful time and were thrilled to visit some place so exotic. Thanks for all your help…”\n\nCA from Australia\n\n6 Day Visa Free St Petersburg – April 2017\n\n“…Both Guide and Driver in St Petersburg were absolutely excellent. Could not praise them enough! The driver was very alert to our every need, and went out of his way to fit in what was needed.\n\nOur beautiful guide was so knowledgeable and friendly and spoke very good English, and again went out of her way to make the tour work. And St Pertersburg was well worth the visit.\n\nOur rating for the land section and driver and guide is 200% at least! Re the ship, boarding in Helsinki was just as we would expect from any cruise line, including easy movement of our luggage etc thru the boarding tubes. The ship was very good for the voyage and the night, with many bars and eateries and the cabins were also good…”\n\nBG from Australia\n\nDeluxe Adriatic Cruise MV Futura Split to Split – May 2017\n\n“…Both the boat and trip exceeded my expectations. A quality vessel with nice intimate atmosphere and an extremely attentive crew. Very comfortable deck space and sun deck, perfect for relaxing (and watching for dolphins) as you sail between the islands. My lower deck cabin with en suite bathroom was spacious and well appointed (excellent shower). I didn’t regret (or notice) not having an upper deck cabin as I spent so little time in it. All our Croatian ports of call were interesting and beautifully preserved/restored. The short walking tour with a local guide was a great introduction before having free time to enjoy the local facilities. You could hire a bike, sit in a bar, swim, visit a museum or winery .. plenty of relaxing options. One highlight is the swim stop away from the crowds. Food onboard was very good, prepared with care, nicely presented and plentiful, a glass of local wine with lunch and there is a reasonably priced bar list. Split is a gem, worth a night pre or post tour to explore the bars and restaurants. My one extra night in Trogir at the end of the cruise was perfect for an early flight home from Split airport, less than 10 minutes from Trogir by taxi…”\n\nDM – Managing Director Asla Ltd (As this is a relatively new product for us at Select Tours and Cruises, I am happy to share my personal recommendation)\n\n4 Day Visa Free St Petersburg – May 2017\n\n“…Just a note to say thank you for arranging the wonderful 3 day visa free trip to St P. We thoroughly enjoyed it and it fitted in so well with our other plans to provide a happy and memorable trip to the wonderful Baltic. We had a super 3 day choral trip in Tallin, 24 hours in Helsinki which we loved before boarding P Anastasia for St P. on Weds May 31st. We enjoyed the ferry, but had to wait in long queues to get off and again through passport control. Having been slightly concerned that we would miss our guide…..we were so thrilled to be greeted by the lovely Irina and Constantine the driver…..and most of all to find it was just us on a personal tour. Couldn’t believe it!! It was excellent and felt wonderful to whizz past all the crowds outside the Winter Palace up the fabulous staircase to be personally guided by the lovely Irina….who was so knowledgeable and spoke good English. They dropped us off at the very pleasant hotel for the night and we were able walk around and capture the atmosphere of the great city by ourselves for a while, ate in a lovely small, restaurant nearby recommended by hotel. Picked up again at 10 the next morning to visit the other places on the tour, enjoyed coffee and pastry with Irina in the cafe at Yusupov Palace….to hear a little of her life…before they dropped us back for the return ferry. A memorable trip kindly arranged by yourself. Please pass on our appreciation to Irina and her team back in St Petersburg.\n\nWe will definitely recommend you to anyone wanting to do this trip…”\n\nS & MM from UK\n\n6 Day Visa Free St Petersburg – May 2017\n\n“…We had a fabulous time, St Petersburg was a truly spectacular city. I would have loved some extra days. Our guide was great, she was knowledgeable & very helpful & could ensure we had the best experience we could. It was sometimes difficult as we could have spent so much more time at a venue, but she was able to get the highlights so we could see other things in the tight time frame. The extra tour to the summer palace & gardens was well worth it. I think there some glitches with the cabin bookings but these were sorted, so no complaints from us re this. The hotel was great, it was comfortable & the breakfast was excellent. The way the 72 hours is structured with the disembarkation in the afternoon & having to be back on board in the afternoon seemed like a huge waste of time, however I realise it is beyond your control. I appreciated your staff always getting back to me promptly when I sent an enquiry. Thanks again for a truly memorable experience.\n\nPS please pass on our special thanks to our guide Julia…”\n\nRR from Australia\n\nMS Tolstoy – May 2017\n\n“…I have just returned from a river cruise on MS Tolstoy. It far exceeded my expectations. The ship was clean, the food healthy and adequate and the crew were excellent. From the cleaners to the restaurant staff to the guides, they were all excellent. Having been brought up in Britain during the Cold War I admit that I had a few preconceived ideas as to what to expect. However, I find that the Russian people were very welcoming and friendly and I learned so much about the history, culture and the wonderful art and architecture. It was overwhelming and I would like to return to Russia at a later date to learn more. The cabins are small but, hey, how much time do you spend there? The itinerary had something for everyone. I would definitely recommend this trip to anyone…”\n\nRP from UK\n\n6 Day Visa Free St Petersburg – May 2017\n\n“…Hi, glad to report all went very well. Enjoyable and informative trip, Julia the guide was excellent, always on time, answered all queries well.\n\nAll in all would recommend without reservation…”\n\nKJ from UK\n\nMS Rostropovich – May 2017\n\n“…Thank you so much for arranging everything for us. Considering we had only a day in Moscow we had a superb guide who helped us make the most of the day, finishing at the Kremlin. The cruise was affected by ice on Lake Onega and the crew could not have been more assiduous in rearranging the schedule to the maximum advantage of everybody, which must have made for a great deal of work (and stress) for them. Due to the delay we were flying out of St Petersburg on the same afternoon we arrived, but they arranged a half day touring the city with an excellent guide again, finishing at the airport in time for our flights. Nothing but praise is due to the staff of M S Rostropovich. If you could pass this on to them I would be grateful…”\n\nC G from UK.\n\n6 Day Visa Free St Petersburg – May 2017\n\n“…Just to let you know we had a super time on this trip, no complaints at all. The weather was excellent – clear blue skies, very good Tour Guide Irina who was very friendly, knowledgeable and made good use of our time. As such, it meant we had quite a bit of time on our own to wander around, which for us was good. Ferry trip OK and luckily for my partner, very smooth both ways! So, once again many thanks\n\nPS: The hotel in Helsinki was very good and accommodating\n\nPS: Interested in your Danube river cruise, albeit in a year or two’s time…”\n\nDW from UK\n\nPrivate Visa Free St Petersburg – October 2016\n\n“…IT WAS A FANTASTIC TOUR!!!!!

Hotel and staff were very good.\n\nSt Petersberg was just wonderful. Olga was a really good guide. Sokos Hotel was amazingly good especially breakfast. We did get lost at night but eventually got a taxi. Despite having nil language skills. We did find places to eat nearby which were interesting. I do want to go back to Russia especially as i have read a bit more about the history.I wanted to go to the Russian Museum which is not so popular. Even without a guide it was very worthwhile.\n\nSo everything very positive. All contacts have been good and would use your company again….”\n\nKS from UK\n\n5 star Visa Free St Petersburg – July 2016\n\n“…Everything went to plan and was very straightforward and smooth. The hotel in St Petersburg was great – clean, spacious and the staff really helpful – they also gave us a very unexpected free upgrade. Only having 6 people on the two tours was a great bonus and our Russian guide was fantastic- knowlegable, efficient and helpful. The way she navigated us around the city and the Hermitage and the wonderful buildings was really enjoyable. Please can you pass on our comments to her. Our driver on the city tour was also great as the traffic was very heavy. We both loved the city and we made full use of our free time to explore. Really pleased with the organisation of our holiday – we had a great tripand have already recommended to others. We would certainly consider using Select Tours again.\n\nJust for info it might be worth warning people that when they arrive in Russia they may have to carry bags down a very steep set of steps to get off the ferry. The queues at Russian immigration can also take a long time (it took us over an hour) and can feel a bit daunting. We were fine but some people really struggled with large and heavy cases and the crowded and hot immigration hall. That said it was worth it and our Russian guide greated us with a big smile once in Russia – the tour was so much easier than using the ferry minibus…”\n\nAE from UK\n\nMS Rostropovich – August 2016\n\n“…When R and I arrived in St Petersburg on Saturday, our luggage did not! Your driver waited for more than two hours in the Arrivals Hall not knowing where we were, but we were of course dealing with the bureaucracy and the paperwork. We tried unsuccessfully to call the local numbers you had provided us with to explain our delay. Our relief at seeing him holding our name card when we finally escaped into Arrivals was huge, and we would like you to pass on our renewed thanks to him. Additionally, would you be kind enough to contact the management team in our ship ( the Rostropovich) for the enormous help the Cruise Director Nalatia and crew member Micha gave us in the nightmare scenario which was our lost luggage retrieval – Richard and Micha in a taxi dash to the airport late yesterday afternoon and returning on board with both suitcases just ten minutes before we sailed last night. Natalie’s huge efforts and constant harrying of the airport people were the difference between failure and success.\n\nAnd thanks for the wine! We have been singing your praises to some of our fellow passengers…”\n\nMP from UK\n\nMS Tolstoy River Russian Cruise Review – July 2016\n\n“…I was very impressed with service provided by Select a Cruise. I’m in Australia and received very prompt replies to emails. Booking was efficient and simple. As far as the cruise go, it exceeded my expectations. Having done many luxury ocean cruises, I didn’t expect much from a Russian River Cruise! It wasn’t luxurious but very well organised and we enjoyed it immensely. The food was not excessive but healthy and certainly enough to eat. Plenty of variety over the cruise. Wine provided was pretty bad (especially in comparison to Aust wine). Included tours were great. Only issue was the cruise card which normally covers everything on a cruise. This cruise card only covered drinks. We had to pay in roubles for laundry and gifts bought on board. Photos had also to be paid in cash – either roubles or euros. Would also recommend upgrading to junior or full suite for a bit of extra room\n\nIn summary, its a great cruise as long as you dont expect the luxury of an ocean cruise. Included tours were great and the cruise was an enjoyable experience…”\n\nK and K W from Australia\n\nMS Rostropovich – August 2016\n\n“…I would now like to write to express my warm appreciation to you both for your efforts in organising our tour and cruise in Russia. All the steps involved, all the information and all the arrangements you made worked perfectly! Although I had frequently been to the USSR twenty-five and more years ago, it was very interesting to see how Saint-Petersburg and Moscow have evolved, even if there is a tremendous gradient of wealth between the centres of these cities and all the surrounding country. The cruise, including the visits at each end was very enjoyable and relaxing, with a very pleasant atmosphere and attentive crew and the local guides at each stop were excellent. It was just a pity that high waves on Lake Onega did not allow us to visit the Isle of Kizhi (probably the highlight between St Petersburg and Moscow).\n\nSo: thank you VERY much: I have good reason to recommend Select Tours and Cruises!…”\n\nND from Switzerland\n\nVisa Free St Petersburg – September 2016\n\n“…I wanted to thank you for arranging our St Petersburg visit in September and give you some feedback on our 3 day visa free tour. All arrangements went exactly to plan and the hotels, ferries and guide surpassed our expectations. Our guide Svetlana was nervous at first but we warmed to each other quickly. She was extremely efficient and covered everything on our requested agenda in the short time allowed. She had pre arranged tickets at all venues and she was able to usher us in front of long queues and large tour groups, much to their surprise (and ours!). Her knowledge was extensive and there was no question she could not answer.\n\nMany thanks for your help and attention to our requests and for making this trip possible and also most enjoyable for us…”\n\nLP from Australia\n\nMS Tolstoy River Russian Cruise Review – August 2016\n\n“… We’ve just returned from our holiday.

The crew on the cruise went out of its way to make us feel at home.Every body, starting from the receptionists to the waitresses, the guides, the musicians,the photographers, the chambermaids &of course the’hidden’staff gave us a no complaints holiday. We’d like to say a big big thank you to Ksenia, our on board tour guide. No amount of praise is enough! Olga ,our onboard tour manager,deserves a special mention. She helped us in many ways too.

Could not fault anything on board and the tour guides were exemplary. We had a lot of fun with Russian dancing and singing and there were plenty of other things to enjoy (Russian history classes for example) which were very popular. Dining room, food and accommodations were first class with service crew friendly and helpful at all times and even though some of them had limited English, it was FAR better than my Russian! It would appear that passengers are designated restaurants by language. English was probably the least spoken so we were allocated the Symphony Restaurant which is the smaller and more intimate of the two on board. Met some lovely people and the entire experience was orchestrated by our guide in ANDREW, who really did look after and organise us flawlessly.\n\nExcellent value and extremely enjoyable cruise and would strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys river cruising…”\n\nRH from Australia\n\nVisa Free St Petersburg – August 2016\n\n“…Our trip to St Petersburgh was excellent. We really enjoyed the ferry travel and our hotel was superb. Our guide was very informative on the tours.\n\nOne issue was the access on and off the ferry at St Petersburgh. As we had larger cases and were not young, the very steep gangway access was an issue and we were grateful for help from other passengers to get on and off.\n\nI would recommend looking at improving it to allow passengers similar access as that in Helsinki…”\n\nL W from NZ\n\n“Customer Services: Thank you for your kind comments.

The cruise ship, staff, food , excursions and amenities were excellent.

Thank you again for all your assistance with the booking and upgrades…”\n\nSM from USA\n\n5 star Visa Free to St Petersburg – June 2016\n\n“…The overall 5 day cruise experience was fantastic, although the actual cruise was more like a ferry – it provided several options for food and a shop. On the way from Helsinki to St Petersburg, we spend most of the time inside on the ferry. Arrival in St Petersburg required patience and energy, the cuing was very long. However, once in st Petersburg we were met by our guide Olga, who spoke fluent English. She was knowledgeable about St Petersburg, the architecture, history and art. She was efficient and extremely easy going and personable and was great company throughout the stay. The hotel was excellent, the city out of this world and the art to die for! The return journey was much better than getting there, we spend a lot of time enjoying the sun on the deck, had lovely food in one of the restaurants, and the immigration processing in Helsinki was much faster. Overall it was a worthwhile, very memorable and excellent value for money experience which I would happily recommend to anyone…”\n\nOA from Netherlands\n\nPrivate Visa Free tour to St Petersburg – July 2016\n\nI thought I would send this very lovely feedback from our clients who are currently in St Petersburg on the Visa Free St Petersburg.

This is greatly appreciated:\n\n“….Just a quick note from St Petersburg. All the flights etc have gone well to date – thanks. But especially, we’d like to let you know that the St Petersburg tour is simply awesome !! We were met at the Ferry wharf as arranged by Svetlana (guide) and her driver (Phiordor) and saw so much on the 1st day. She was a fountain of knowledge and extremely friendly and he dropped us at the entrance to each location and was perfectly positioned to pick us up later. Unfortunately our tour was interrupted early due to a rain storm – but she suggested several other things to do on our own – which turned out to be simply spectacular. We are with them again tomorrow and the next day – but I thought you should know that we grateful to you for arranging them (at short notice). In addition the hotel Helvetia in the Nevsky Prospect is very comfortable, well located and very well appointed.”\n\nTravel Agent in New Zealand\n\nMS Rostropovich – June 2016\n\n“…We had a very enjoyable time, the hotels were good and everything went like clockwork, always good news when you are far from home! We enjoyed the boat trip although the weather was not good so we missed out on the trip to the UNESCO World Heritage site which was a shame. Our tour guide Andre was excellent, very helpful and attentive making sure the trip went as well as could be hoped.\n\nThanks for a lovely trip…”\n\nJ and P B from UK\n\n5 star Visa Free to St Petersburg – May 2016\n\n“…We had a most wonderful tour. Your guide in St. Petes , Andre is good and knowledgeable. However, the arrangement with the hotel Sokos Palace for the wine on my husband’s birthday did not materialise. Upon enquiry, they said they did not promise anything of such and they only hand out fruit platter which did not appear at all. Overall we are pleased with the cruise and tour!…”\n\nLM from Malaysia\n\nDanube MS Select Explorer – May 2016\n\n“…The cruise exceeded our expectations, food, staff,accommodation, everything was first class,with the result that we would love to do another cruise next year d.v.the Captain suggested Amsterdam to Basel on the Rhine. As an example.So could you let me have detail of your cruises for May/ June. 2017.If possible with Airport collection arrangements ( 8 days) many thanks for your help and advice, well done to you and your company. Kind regards…”\n\nNS from Eire.\n\nMS Chernyshevsky – Russian River Cruise – June 2016\n\n“…First of all – the correspondence with your offices in the UK, and all arrangements re payments, etc, was done with a lady called Becky – she was SUPERB!! She answered my multitude of queries promptly and was always so helpful . I have read positive remarks about Becky on the internet pages, but she was even more amazing than that!

(we could not get a visa for Russia for longer than 30 days, so had to abandon that part of our intended trip)\n\nThe ship MS Chernyshevsky, was comfortable, and thankfully not as “WHA-WHA” as the cruise ships around the Americas, which can be very noisy and organised with entertainment beyond endurance… We had time to relax and not be “entertained” all the time, which was great. The only complaint was that the wifi on the ship hardly ever worked, which is understandable in way-off places, but even in the cities, it was not viable. The company should invest in satellite wifi. The meals on board were really beautifully presented, but I found the portions far too big for a normal person – not something to complain about , is it? The staff were always helpful and friendly.\n\nWe had a young guide for the 12 English passengers, Konstantin, very quiet but efficient young man, who looked after us well, and got us at the right places at the right times, every time.
