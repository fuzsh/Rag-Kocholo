        "text": "The Volga, Europe’s longest river and a fixture of Russian folklore and song, is just one leg of the six-day voyage between Moscow and St. Petersburg, the most popular Russian cruise itinerary. Along with museums and iconic architecture, the Moscow-St. Petersburg voyage offers splendid isolation amid those same lakes and rivers and gives you time in Russia’s two most famous -- and beautiful -- cities. To complete the journey by water, river cruise lines also rely on a number of other waterways, including other rivers, canals and Europe’s two largest lakes.\n\nWhile cruise itineraries on the Moscow to St. Petersburg voyage may range up to 11 to 13 days, the time spent on the boats themselves is typically six days, while the extra days will be spent in Russia’s two main cities.\n\nIf starting in Moscow, you’ll have plenty of time to visit Red Square (with onion-domed St. Basil’s Cathedral) , the Kremlin, GUM Department Store and other sights in the Russian capital – using the riverboat as your hotel and restaurant -- before setting off on the Moscow Canal out of the city. The canal leads north to the Volga, Russia’s most famous river and Europe’s longest.\n\nThe Volga\n\nHighlights on the Volga include exploring some of the ancient Golden Ring cities northeast of Moscow -- Yaroslavl and Uglich are the headliners -- where traditional Russian cultural treasures, including colorfully painted and intricately carved wooden houses and Russian Orthodox churches such as the Church of Elijah the Prophet and the Church of St. Dimitry on the Blood -- are on display. You may get a chance to enter one of the local homes for tea or lunch and conversation.\n\nAfter sailing the Volga, the Volga-Baltic Waterway, composed of a number of rivers, lakes and canals, then leads to the Baltic Sea over a distance of 230 miles, passing through seven locks. Throughout this area of northern Russia, you can get a sense of solitude and isolation as immense as the land itself.\n\nVillage Port Stops\n\nBut there will still be port stops at villages such as Kuzino or Goritsy for visits to 14th-century monasteries and perhaps a children’s school. Later along the way, you’ll cruise through Europe’s two largest lakes, whose names are unfamiliar to most non-Russians.\n\nThe first, Lake Onega -- Europe’s second largest lake -- features the island of Kizhi, a frequent stop for viewing the Open Air Museum of Wooden Architecture, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that includes traditional windmills and wooden churches. One multi-domed early 18th-century church, Transfiguration Cathedral, was built without hammer or nail.\n\nThe Svir River then leads to Europe’s largest lake, Lake Ladoga. On the shores of the lake sits Mandrogi, a colorful center of Russian folklore with a number of museums, including the popular Museum of Russian Vodka.\n\nSt. Petersburg\n\nFinally, the Neva River flows into St. Petersburg, where you can tour the enormous Hermitage Museum (with the largest collection of paintings in the world), St. Isaac’s Cathedral, Peter and Paul Fortress (where St. Petersburg began), and the rococo-style Catherine’s Palace and Park in nearby Pushkin, built by Catherine I, wife of Peter the Great and Empress of Russia.\n\nYou can also reverse the journey, starting in St. Petersburg and ending in Moscow, with the same basic stops. But whichever direction you travel along Russia’s timeless waterways, Stride can help you find the river cruise that best meets your needs and budget."
