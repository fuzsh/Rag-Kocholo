It was its political concept and determination, but also its confirmed practise and resolution to create the so- called Macedonian model of peace and security in the Balkans. In the interest of this extended importance of these principles for the region, let me stick to some of them.\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia achieved its independence after the fall of former Yugoslavia, in a peaceful and legitimate way. It refused to participate in the outrageous war on the territory of former Yugoslavia, and by referendum and adoption of its Constitution, it proclaimed its independence. This is how, not only centuries long aspiration of the Macedonian people to create its own independent state, was accomplished, but also it was demonstrated that it is possible to fulfill the right to self-determination and statehood without bloodshed in the Balkans on the eve of 21 century. Normally, this act was possible because of some important assumptions.\n\nFirst, on the internal political plan: It was possible because the Republic of Macedonia chose the peaceful way of disassociation from former Yugoslavia, and not the military conflict. The former Yugoslav National Army left Macedonia upon an agreement.\n\nMacedonia proclaimed its independence and state within the existing borders, as internationally defined borders. Not only it did not choose the road of territorial pretensions and attempts for a violent change of the borders, but it is constantly indicating that this is the basic reason for a future 100 years' war in the ethnically mixed Balkans. Bearing in mind the typical Balkan surroundings, the Republic of Macedonia, and this is really uncommon in the European practice, wrote in its new Constitution that it does not have any pretensions whatsoever toward any of its neighbors. Today, Macedonia has practically not any border disputes with the neighbors.\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia opts for fast and radical economic, reforms, for a consistent transformation toward a market economy. In spite of the high social price, as well as the difficult problems caused by the UN sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, as well as by the illegal Greek embargo against Macedonia, the knowledge that this is the only possible way for economic progress and well-being prevailed.\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia decided to be a modern European legal state, with a parliamentary democracy, and with constitutional high standards of a civil society. The EU Badinter's Commission in 1991 assessed the Macedonian Constitution as a modern European constitution and it recommended a fast recognition of the Republic of Macedonia.\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia opts for interethnic understanding and tolerance, as well as for development of the rights of the nationalities in Macedonia. It is a model based on the traditions of the Macedonian people and nationalities living here, but it is also a model based on the standards of the international Law and practise in this area. This confirmed Macedonia to be a non-typical Balkan country, in time when ethnic cleansing and genocide, suffocated ethnic rights, religious and ethnic discrimination are a Balkan reality and one of the greatest security dangers for Europe.\n\nSecond, on the foreign political plan: The Republic of Macedonia has completely accepted the European option for integrations and cooperation. The long range aim and the basic political philosophy of my country is to join the European Union, the NATO, and the other European associations and institutions. We believe this to be the unique resuscitating option for the whole region of the Balkans. This is the only way for the protection of dignity of the independent states and nations, for making borders a formality - opened for a free flow of people, goods, and ideas.\n\nIn the basis of our Balkan policy lies the policy of good neighborly relations on the principles of inviolability of borders, non-interference into internal affairs and a developed economic, political, and cultural cooperation. Bearing in mind the fact that there is not a single Balkan state in which there are no national minorities from the neighborly countries, it is our firm stance that the rights of national minorities are a question that has to be dealt with by the OSCE and appropriate European international institutions. These questions belong to the internal democratic development and fulfillment of human rights and liberties in every separate Balkan country. The Republic of Macedonia has demonstrated this by its own example, in cooperation with the Council of Europe, the OSCE, the Conference for former Yugoslavia, whose missions are active in the Republic of Macedonia.\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia views its international position as an equal member of the family of the European nations and the United Nations. Unfortunately, in spite of all its essential determinations, the Republic of Macedonia, although it is not its fault, cannot take its equal place in an organization as is the OSCE. This is a fact that, first of all, makes great damages to the OSCE - because the Republic of Macedonia is the only European country that is not a member of this organization, although it fulfills all criteria for becoming a member. It is true that the reason for this is well-known and on this occasion I would only like to recall a kind of an absurdness, which is detrimental to the all-European security. The reason why the Republic of Macedonia cannot be admitted to the \"Partnership for Peace\" project is identical.\n\nPeace and security in the Republic of Macedonia is of an interest of the international community at large, which was demonstrated by the fact that UNPREDEP forces in our country. The preventive diplomacy of the UN peace-keeping forces have in this case shown its real efficiency. I would particularly like to indicate to the importance of the U.S. contingents within the framework of the UNPREDEP.\n\nI believe,\" Gligorov said at the end, \"that I do not have to reassure you of the importance of maintenance and protection of peace and stability of the Republic of Macedonia for Europe. First, because of the fact that the Republic of Macedonia has a central position in the south of the Balkans, on which position the east and the west, peace and war, nations and cultures have been always meeting and intersecting throughout history. Second, but not less important, in this dark Balkan decade, it proved to be a model for the solution of the Balkan crisis with its peaceful policy, European option, and democratic orientation. This is why I am certain that we shall meet at the next Assembly as a country member of the OSCE and 'Partnership for Peace.'\"\n\n\"...The strengthening of peace and security in the Balkans must start from the new Balkan political reality: Former Yugoslavia has fallen apart because it was an artificial creation. The newly created and internationally recognized states are independent and sovereign states with internationally defined borders. All former six members of the Federation are equal successors of former Yugoslavia. Another experiment of an imposed or violently created new state community on this territory is impossible. On the contrary, the only solution is support to the independence of these countries and their faster inclusion into the European economic, political, and military integrations. This is the only way for transforming the geographic Balkan powder keg into a stable, secure European region.\n\nAfter his speech, President Kiro Gligorov answered questions of the delegates of the WEU Assembly. Sir Rafael Johnston from Great Britain wanted to know about the damages that the Republic of Macedonia is suffering from the Greek embargo.\n\nPresident Kiro Gligorov replied that the embargo costs Macedonia $50 million every month, and the embargo has lasted for 17 months. We hope that it will be soon lifted and that the road for a lasting cooperation and friendship with Greece will be opened.\n\nDelegate Fassino from Italy also wanted to know about the relations between the Republic of Macedonia and Greece, and therefore he asked: \"What are the preconditions that Macedonia is forwarding for the beginning of the negotiations, but also how does the President intend to solve the problems with the Albanian minority in the country?\" Gligorov replied that Macedonia has a long range determination to provide for a common life to all nationalities with tolerance and mutual understanding. President Gligorov also made an appeal from the WEU Assembly floor to any of the neighborly countries in the Balkans to announce if it has a higher level of secured rights, and that Macedonia is ready to follow such an example.\n\nIn connection with the questions on preconditions in the negotiations, Gligorov recalled that since the very outset Macedonia has been prepared to have bilateral discussions, but unfortunately, it has not been accomplished. He thinks that the problem posed by Greece does not have any real background and that our country does not have any territorial disputes and pretensions with the southern neighbor.\n\nGerman delegate Scholter asked about Macedonia's stance on a possible deployment of German troops within the framework of UNPROFOR in Bosnia, to which President kiro gligorov said that there are no obstacles for the German troops to participate in the peace-keeping mission in the Balkans.\n\nGreek delegate Kastanidis, in greeting the address of the President, asked him if he wished a lasting solution and if he was willing, as he said, \"to sit on a table and start negotiations tomorrow.\" President Gligorov replied that it is Greece's long range interest to have Macedonia exist and that in spite of all the problems that it is causing to Macedonia, there is no adversary mood and antagonism toward the Greek people. Gligorov also added that Greece, being the only member of the NATO, the EU, and recently of the WEU, must be the promoter of the European ideas, and not the brake.\n\nJust after that, President Gligorov held a news conference in the building of the WEU Assembly. As usual, representatives of the Greek media asked most of the questions, on the mood and willingness of Macedonia to sit on a negotiating table with Greece. \"We are ready,\" Gligorov said, \"to sit and negotiate right away, but under equal conditions. Are the conditions equal,\" he asked, \"if someone is pressing with an embargo and would the Greek side accept to sit and negotiate under such circumstances? So far,\" Gligorov said, \"Greece was the one that constantly made up new conditions and it constantly asked Macedonia to show good will.\"\n\n[02] STEFKOVSKI GOES FROM IMRO-DPMNU TO IMRO-DP\n\nFrom the day before yesterday, the member of the City Assembly Pandil Stefkovski is no longer a member of IMRO-DPMNU. Starting from next month, he will carry out his function as a member of IMRO- Democratic party. This is the first case of a deputy to cross over from one to another party in the City Assembly, but in view of the political turbulence and inter-party games surrounding the election of mayor, it is unlikely that this will also be the last.\n\nThe deputy became even more resolute these days, with the birth of the new coalition IMRO-DPMNU-PDP. According to him, it is imaginable to have a coalition between two parties that are so different in their stances and attitude toward Macedonia. Stefkovski feels the coalition is unnatural, regards it as betrayal of the ideas of IMRO and for these reasons, he no longer wants to be a member of IMRO-DPMNU.\n\n[03] COALITION OR COORDINATION OF INTERESTS AT LOCAL LEVEL\n\nIn his statement for \"Nova Makedonija,\" Ljupcho Georgievski feels there is no need for excitement in the Macedonian public over the fact that IMRO-DPMNU realized certain talks at a local level with PDP representatives, which also dealt with some possibilities of closer cooperation and coalitioning at a local level.\n\nAccording to the IMRO-DPMNU leader, this will contribute to the stabilization of Macedonia, especially on an inter-ethnic plan, and publicly demonstrates that IMRO-DPMNU can cooperate with all political subjects in a citizen's state. He emphasized that such negotiations have still not been led at a higher party level, although both party leaderships know about the cooperation at a local level, and in a way, support it. Ljupcho Georgievski sees no reason why this cooperation should not continue on to a higher level. The president of this non- parliamentary oppositional party even announced an open possibility for IMRO-DPMNU to form a coalition with PDP in the future, provided, as he said, PDP proclaims stances for a stronger and more stable Macedonia.\n\nYesterday in Tetovo, we also established contact with the president of PDP, who was categoric that it was not a question of a coalition, but inter-party coordination of interests. Or, as he said, had there been no need, IMRO-DPMNU would not have negotiated with PDP. Aliti, too, quite identically with Georgievski, repeated that all the talks so far, were led at the level of town leaderships and the City Assembly, and not in the form of cooperation or negotiations of the party centers or leaderships. Otherwise, PDP's general stand, according to Aliti, remains unchanged - that the party will continue to cooperate with the Macedonian political parties from the center, meaning the present coalition partners.\n\nWhat's common for both party leaders is that they emphasize their accord for concrete cooperation in concrete situations, foremost at a local level, like the cases with the Assemblies of the municipalities of Kichevo and Tetovo, while both sides also announced that they would coordinate their stances on the assembly benches and in the Skopje City Assembly. As a reminder, the coalitioning between IMRO-DPMNU and PDP is specifically incarnated in the Kichevo Assembly, where the division of power between these two parties is lasting more than three years. In Tetovo, the situation is more complicated, as the coalition is not formally achieved, but practically imposed with administrative measures, while the cooperation between IMRO-DPMNU and PDP is expected to be realized in the Skopje City Assembly, especially on the plan of the current election of mayor.\n\n[04] MEETING WITH VANCE TODAY\n\nAt the invitation of the mediator in the Macedonian- Greek dispute Cyrus Vance, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Macedonia Stevo Crvenkovski left for New York today for a consultative meeting. The meeting will take place today.\n\n[05] WHEN WILL THE PROCESS IN THE EUROPEAN COURT RESUME?\n\nThe process in the European Court of Justice over the Greek embargo, will probably resume in September, the Athens press claimed yesterday, without revealing the source.\n\nThe moderate left-wing newspaper \"Elefterotipia,\" explains the delaying of the decision with \"the difficulty in bringing the opposite stances closer,\" due to which it will be difficult to foresee the decision of the Court in Luxembourg.\n\n[06] START OF CLOSER RELATIONS\n\nThe Chief of the General Staff of the Macedonian Army, Gen. Col. Dragoljub Bocinov ended his two-day visit to the Czech armed forces today. During his visit, as we were informed by the Czech Ministry of Defence, Gen. Bocinov had a chance to meet some organs from the Ministry and the Czech army which he was interested in meeting and for whom he came to the Czech Republic in the first place.\n\nThe Macedonian army is interested in cooperating with the Czech partners, especially in the field of training of military professionals. Besides discussions on this topic with the Chief of the General Staff of the Czech Army Gen. Col. Yirzi Nekvasil, Bocinov paid a visit to the Center for the education and training of the Czech Defence Ministry, for the training of officers who will carry out activities abroad, as members of peace missions. Most of the courses are of international character and the Macedonian side expressed particular interest in them.\n\nToday, Bocinov is scheduled to visit the aircraft factory \"Aero Vodohod,\" which supplies the Czech army will quality aircraft of the type \"L-159.\" Third-world countries have shown great interest in the aircraft manufactured at \"Aero Vodohod,\" as well as Russia, where they are used for training. At the end of his visit, Bocinov was also received by the Deputy Defence Minister Miroslav Kalausek.\n\n[07] MACEDONIAN INTELLECTUALS IN GREECE\n\nA group of independent intellectuals and members of the Helsinki Citizen's Parliament in Macedonia stayed in Greece, in Lagosini-Athens, for two days, at the invitation of the Helsinki Citizen's Parliament in Greece.\n\nThis meeting, which was attended by independent Greek intellectuals and representatives of various citizen's organizations, focused on the current situation on the Balkans and in that context, the Macedonian-Greek dispute.\n\nMONEY - Economy, Business, Finance & Market\n\n[08] GOVERNMENT - US$ 1.07 BILLION FOR PUBLIC SECTOR\n\nAt its latest session the Government accepted the draft-program for investments in the Macedonian public sector, which includes projects that have to be realized in the next three years.\n\nFor the realization of this program, US$ 595 million will be set aside from the budget and funds for health, pension insurance, and the fund for roads, while additional US$ 475 million are expected to be provided from the international financial organization and by means of various donations.\n\nThe minister-spokesman Gjuner Ismail underlined that priority in the development strategy of the Government would be given to the economy, infrastructure, road network and telecommunications. This mainly applies to the key projects in the electric economy, the road and railroad network, i.e. the realization of the East-West corridor and the construction of the hydro-electric plant \"Kozjak.\" The tendency, according to minister Ismail, will be to reconstruct and modernize the existing infrastructure capacities, finishing up the object that are still in a phase of construction, as well as the supply of the necessary equipment for maintaining the standards and functions in the public sector, foremost, the objects in the field of health, education, culture and science.\n\n[09] ILLEGAL IMPORTS - TURKISH TOMATOES ENDING UP IN SERBIA\n\n40 tugboats carrying tomatoes were imported in Macedonia these days, in spite of the seasonal ban on vegetable imports, for the purpose of protecting the domestic production, the agency \"Makpress\" reports from sources in the Macedonian Chamber of Commerce.\n\nWhich firms are importers, is still not known, and according to the same sources, the Chamber has asked the inspection services to introduce more rigorous measures in controlling imports of vegetable products.\n\n\"Vecer\" claims that 300 tones of tomatoes have been imported from Turkey, and that firms from Gevgelija have also done the same, which were then re-exported to Serbia. \"Vecer\" claims that the registered 15 trucks carrying 300 tones of Turkish tomatoes brought in a clean profit of 150,000 DEM.\n\nThe Macedonian Government reviewed the information of the Ministry of Agriculture about the uncontrolled imports and re-export of agricultural products to Serbia, under the markings that they were produced in Macedonia. The Government has reinforced the control at the borders in order to prevent such illegal activities which affect the Macedonian vegetable producers.\n\n[10] AIR TRANSPORTATION\n\nFIRST FLIGHT FOR TIRANA: The aircraft \"DC-9,\" owned by the Macedonian air company \"Avioimpex\" landed at the Tirana airport yesterday, at 12.15 hours. This is the first flight of a Macedonia air company on the line Skopje- Tirana-Skopje.\n\nThe director of \"Avioimpex\" Ilija Smilev told reporters that this is the company's 15th line, which is coordinated with the terms of the more important destinations toward Western Europe.\n\n[11] TELECOMMUNICATIONS -5TH FORUM ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN PRAGUE\n\nThe 5th Annual Forum on Telecommunications - \"Telecom '95 - East-West\" starts in Prague today. 16 countries will be taking part in the Forum, including ministers that cover this department, directors of companies from the field of telecommunications from a number of countries from East and Central Europe, as well as representatives from the financial institutions - the World bank, EBRD and equipment manufacturers.\n\nMacedonia's Minister of Transport and Connections Dimitar Buzlevski will be representing Macedonia at this convention. In his expose, he stated that by the year 2000, Macedonia plans to install 160,000 telephone connections, to introduce cellular telephony as soon as possible, while one of the strategic projects is the construction of the trans-Balkan telecommunications line. As for the legislation, the liberalization, which the international institutions insist on, will be made possible with the recently adopted laws on concessions and foreign investments, as well as those laws that are already in a phase of adoption - the law on public companies and on telecommunications.\n\n(end)"
