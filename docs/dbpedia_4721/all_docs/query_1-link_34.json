        "text": "Not your ordinary sightseeing tour, a river cruise by Vodohod is an entirely different way to discover Russia, one that has been gaining more popularity with travelers who value a blend of comfort and adventure.

The same cannot be said for most landing sites, which lack wheelchair access and might have stairs, hills, and uneven terrains. Our managers can help you find an appropriate itinerary for your case.\n\nTop 3 Best River Cruise Ships\n\nN. Novgorod\n\nThis is a four-star vessel that has been in operation for more than 40 years and went through a major renovation just two years ago. Its specialty is taking passengers on the Volga River cruises between the two Russian capitals with comfort and confidence.\n\nMustai Karim\n\nA luxury vessel that has just recently joined our fleet, the Mustai Karim offers the latest cruising technology and 5-star hotel accommodation. With this ship, the experience of being onboard can come close to the level of excitement of the onshore adventures. The thoughtful design takes river cruising to the next level.\n\nK. Korotkov\n\nOriginally from Germany, the ship first set sail over 45 years ago and has been brought to today’s standards with a 2020 renovation. This is a premium-category vessel with a fresh Scandinavian design, pastel colors, and detailed interiors to add aesthetics to your journey.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat river goes from St Petersburg to Moscow?\n\nThe longest river in Europe, the Volga, flows almost 3700 kilometers through Russia. Also along the route is Yaroslavl, the unofficial capital of the Golden Ring.\n\nHow many locks are there between Moscow and St Petersburg?\n\nA lock is a device used for raising and lowering vessels between stretches of water of different levels. You will pass approximately 20 locks as the Captain navigates the rivers, lakes, canals of the Volga-Baltic waterway.\n\nHow many days do I need in St Petersburg?\n\nYou should plan to spend at least three days to cover the central sites. Add an extra day for each suburb you want to visit, like the Peterhof Palace or the Catherine Palace.\n\nWhat should I not miss in Moscow?\n\nAmong key places to visit is the Red Square and Kremlin, GUM department store, Lenin’s Mausoleum, and the St. Basil’s Cathedral. Other attractions are the Bolshoy Theatre, Tretyakov Gallery, the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, the Sparrow Hills, and the Gorky Park.\n\nDo I need a visa for a Russian river cruise?\n\nYou do, as you will cross the border when your flight lands. If you apply in advance and gather the necessary documents, the process will go as with any other visa.\n\nHow far is Saint Petersburg from Moscow?\n\nThe distance on the map is 634 kilometers. By car, it is about 700 kilometers. Cruising between them will take several days, as you wouldn’t want to miss the cities and sites conveniently situated along the way.\n\nWhat should I not miss in St Petersburg?\n\nYou should definitely plan an excursion to the Hermitage museum, one of the largest art museums in the world. Stroll along the Nevsky Prospect, visit St. Isaac Cathedral, the Kazan Cathedral, and the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood, and see the drawbridges at night.\n\nIs it safe to visit Moscow and St Petersburg?\n\nTraveling to Moscow and St. Petersburg is safe for tourists, especially if you follow the group onshore excursions and do not wander too far during your free time. Do watch your belongings carefully, as pickpocketing may be common in the major sights.\n\nCan you apply for a Russian visa online?\n\nSome nationalities can, but the process may be subject to changes due to the pandemic restrictions currently in place. ​​Citizens of Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, or the United Kingdom are not eligible.\n\nIs Moscow or St Petersburg better?\n\nThe two Russian capitals are very different in architecture, pace, atmosphere, and scale. St. Petersburg has more of a European vibe, with paved streets, cafes, and canals. Most of the sites are palaces or cathedrals of astonishing grandeur. Moscow is a metropolis with long walking distances, busy nightlife, and impressive buildings that reflect modern and Soviet-era times.\n\nWhat should I not wear in Russia?\n\nThere are really no restrictions when it comes to your clothing. Dress comfortably and according to the weather. Try to avoid flashy clothing that attracts unnecessary attention. Keep in mind that to visit a cathedral or a church, women generally need long skirts below the knee and a headscarf, and men will be asked to not wear shorts and take off their hats."
