        "text": "Marc is a Distinguished Engineer and VP in the Office of the CTO (OCTO) at Microsoft. His current role is to drive the strategic and technical direction of the company on silicon and hardware systems from a cross-divisional standpoint. This includes Artificial Intelligence, from supercomputer to client devices to Xbox, etc., and general-purpose computing. Throughout his career, Marc has demonstrated a passion for translating high-level application requirements into optimizations up and down the stack, all the way to silicon. AI has been his focus for the past several years, but his interests also encompass accelerators for the cloud, scale-out systems, and process technology. He has given multiple keynotes on AI Hardware, published many papers on throughput computing, multi-cores, multithreading, transactional memory, speculative multi-threading, Java computing, etc. and he is an inventor of over 300 patents on those topics.\n\nPrior to Microsoft, Marc was the CTO of Microelectronics at Sun Microsystems. As a Sun Fellow and SVP, he was responsible for the technical leadership of 1200 engineers. Throughout his career, he has started, architected, led, defined and shipped a variety of microprocessors such as superscalar RISC processors (UltraSPARC I/II), bytecode engines (picoJava), VLIW, media and Java-focused (MAJC), and the first processor to implement speculative multithreading and transactional memory (ROCK – first silicon). He received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Sciences from UCLA and his Physics Engineering degree from Laval University in Canada. Marc is on the board of directors of QuantalRF.\n\nJia is Co-founder, Chief AI Officer and President of a Stealth Generative AI Startup. She is elected as IEEE Fellow for Leadership in Large Scale AI. She is co-teaching the inaugural course of Generative AI and Medicine at Stanford University, where she has served multiple roles including Advisory Board Committee to Nourish, Chief AI Fellow, RWE for Sleep Health and Adjunct Professor at the School of Medicine in the past. She was the Founding Head of R&D at Google Cloud AI. At Google, she oversaw the development of the full stack of AI products on Google Cloud to power solutions for diverse industries. With the passion to make more impact to our everyday life, she later became an entrepreneur, building and advising companies with award-winning platforms to solve today's greatest challenges in life. She has served as Mentor and Professor-in-Residence at StartX, advising founders/companies from Stanford/Alumni. She is the Co-founder and Chairperson of HealthUnity Corporation, a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization. She served briefly at Accenture as a part-time Chief AI Follow for the Generative AI strategy. She also serves as an advisor to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). She is a board member of the Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose. She was selected as a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader, a recognition bestowed on 100 of the world’s most promising business leaders, artists, public servants, technologists, and social entrepreneurs in 2018. Before joining Google, She was the Head of Research at Snap, leading the AI/AR innovation effort. She received her Ph.D. degree from the Computer Science Department at Stanford University.\n\nFausto has two PhDs (Information & Computer Science respectively), earning his second master’s and PhD at the University of California, Irvine. Fausto also holds multiple certifications from MIT, Columbia University, London School of Economics and Political Science, Kellogg School of Management, University of Cambridge and soon also from the University of California, Berkeley. He has worked in multi-disciplinary teams and has over 20 years of experience in academia and industry.\n\nAs a Physicist, Mathematician, Engineer, Computer Scientist, and High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Data Science expert, Fausto has worked on key projects at European and American government institutions and with key individuals, like Nobel Prize winner Michael J. Prather. After his time at NVIDIA corporation in Silicon Valley, Fausto worked at the IBM T J Watson Center in New York on Exascale Supercomputing Systems for the US government (e.g., Livermore and Oak Ridge Labs).\n\nI was drawn to Rambus to focus on cutting edge computing technologies. Throughout my 15+ year career, I’ve helped invent, create and develop means of driving and extending performance in both hardware and software solutions. At Rambus, we are solving challenges that are completely new to the industry and occur as a response to deployments that are highly sophisticated and advanced.\n\nAs an inventor, I find myself approaching a challenge like a room filled with 100,000 pieces of a puzzle where it is my job to figure out how they all go together – without knowing what it is supposed to look like in the end. For me, the job of finishing the puzzle is as enjoyable as the actual process of coming up with a new, innovative solution.\n\nFor example, RDRAM®, our first mainstream memory architecture, implemented in hundreds of millions of consumer, computing and networking products from leading electronics companies including Cisco, Dell, Hitachi, HP, Intel, etc. We did a lot of novel things that required inventiveness – we pushed the envelope and created state of the art performance without making actual changes to the infrastructure.\n\nI’m excited about the new opportunities as computing is becoming more and more pervasive in our everyday lives. With a world full of data, my job and my fellow inventors’ job will be to stay curious, maintain an inquisitive approach and create solutions that are technologically superior and that seamlessly intertwine with our daily lives.\n\nAfter an inspiring work day at Rambus, I enjoy spending time with my family, being outdoors, swimming, and reading.\n\nEducation\n\nPh.D., Electrical Engineering, Stanford University\n\nM.S. Electrical Engineering, Stanford University\n\nMaster of Engineering, Harvey Mudd College\n\nB.S. Engineering, Harvey Mudd College\n\nKarl Freund is the founder and principal analyst of Cambrian AI Research. Prior to this, he was Moor Insights & Strategy’s consulting lead for HPC and Deep Learning. His recent experiences as the VP of Marketing at AMD and Calxeda, as well as his previous positions at Cray and IBM, positions him as a leading industry expert in these rapidly evolving industries. Karl works with investment and technology customers to help them understand the emerging Deep Learning opportunity in data centers, from competitive landscape to ecosystem to strategy.\n\nKarl has worked directly with datacenter end users, OEMs, ODMs and the industry ecosystem, enabling him to help his clients define the appropriate business, product, and go-to-market strategies. He is also recognized expert on the subject of low-power servers and the emergence of ARM in the datacenter and has been a featured speaker at scores of investment and industry conferences on this topic.\n\nAccomplishments during his career include:\n\nLed the revived HPC initiative at AMD, targeting APUs at deep learning and other HPC workloads\n\nCreated an industry-wide thought leadership position for Calxeda in the ARM Server market\n\nHelped forge the early relationship between HP and Calxeda leading to the surprise announcement of HP Moonshot with Calxeda in 2011\n\nBuilt the IBM Power Server brand from 14% market share to over 50% share\n\nIntegrated the Tivoli brand into the IBM company’s branding and marketing organization\n\nCo-Led the integration of HP and Apollo Marketing after the Boston-based desktop company’s acquisition\n\nKarl’s background includes RISC and Mainframe servers, as well as HPC (Supercomputing).
