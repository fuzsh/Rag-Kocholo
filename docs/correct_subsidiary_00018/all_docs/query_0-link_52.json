Analyst firms Piper Sandler, Baird, and KeyBanc have respectively raised their price targets for Synopsys to $687, $661, and $690, maintaining positive ratings on the stock.\n\nIn terms of company news, Synopsys unveiled the first complete PCIe 7.0 IP solution, a significant milestone in data transfer technology for AI and high-performance computing data centers. The company also announced the availability of its AI-driven multi-die reference flow and Synopsys IP for Intel (NASDAQ: ) Foundry's embedded multi-die interconnect bridge technology, aiming to expedite the design and production of heterogeneous multi-die systems.\n\nThese recent developments reflect Synopsys' robust financial performance and promising trajectory in the semiconductor industry.
