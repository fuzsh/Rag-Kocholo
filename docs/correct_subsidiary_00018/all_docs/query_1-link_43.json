        "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.----Oct. 16, 2000--Synopsys, Inc. (Nasdaq:SNPS), today announced that Unisys Corporation has successfully used Physical Compiler, Synopsys' Physical Synthesis tool, to tape out a high-performance, 200 MHz, 1.5 million gate, 0.18 micron ASIC. Physical Compiler has now been adopted as a standard part of the Unisys ASIC design flow.\n\nBefore adopting Physical Compiler, the conventional Unisys back-end flow required intensive designer intervention resulting in design schedule unpredictability. Physical Compiler's unified synthesis and placement capability allowed Unisys to fix the last 1,000 timing violations in less than a week -- saving weeks of typical iterations.\n\n``Timing closure is a significant challenge,'' said Wayne Engstrom, engineering director, Unisys Systems and Technology. ``With Physical Compiler, we saved several weeks of manual iteration on a very complex design. We have successfully inserted Synopsys' Physical Compiler into our standard ASIC design process, which includes Synopsys' Design Compiler and our ASIC vendor-supplied back-end tools.''\n\n``We are extremely pleased at the success Unisys has achieved with Physical Compiler on one of their toughest designs,'' said Sanjiv Kaul, senior vice president and general manager for Synopsys' Physical Synthesis business unit. ``Tape outs are the true measure of success for an implementation tool. This tape out builds upon the success that Synopsys' Physical Synthesis has demonstrated through more than 25 tape outs of networking, communications, computing, and graphics chips.''\n\nSynopsys' Physical Synthesis Solution\n\nPioneered by Synopsys, Physical Synthesis helps designers address the implementation challenges of next-generation system-on-chip designs. Physical Synthesis brings key physical design considerations to the front-end, allowing RTL designers to rapidly achieve high quality of results. The overall design flow includes Chip Architect design planner, Physical Compiler unified synthesis and placement, and FlexRoute top-level router. Synopsys' Physical Synthesis leverages industry-standard tools such as Design Compiler(TM), Module Compiler(TM) and PrimeTimeÂ® and its proven interfaces to third-party solutions allow it to easily plug into an existing design flow.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nPhysical Compiler is available now. Pricing for a single-user, one-year term license begins at $100,000. Support and maintenance options vary and are in addition to the product license.\n\nAbout Unisys\n\nUnisys is an e-business solutions company whose 36,000 employees help customers in 100 countries apply information technology to seize opportunities and overcome challenges of the Internet economy.
