        "text": "DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The \"Digital Twins Market by Technology, Twinning Type, Cyber-to-Physical Solutions, Use Cases and Applications in Industry Verticals 2024 - 2029\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\nThis report evaluates digital twinning technology, solutions, use cases, and leading company efforts in terms of R&D and early deployments. The report assesses the digital twin product and service ecosystem including application development and operations. This includes consideration of use cases by industry vertical.\n\nThe report also analyzes technologies supporting and benefiting from digital twinning. The report also provides detailed forecasts covering digital twinning solutions in many market segments and use cases including manufacturing simulations, predictive analytics, and more from 2024 to 2029 with global, regional, and major country forecasts.\n\nSelect Report Findings:\n\nThe report found 47% of IT decision makers have never heard of digital twins\n\nDigital twin supported solutions in smart cities will reach $5.9 billion by 2029\n\nOver 95% of all IoT Platforms will contain some form of digital twinning capability by 2029\n\nDigital twinning will become standard feature/functionality for IoT Application Enablement by 2028\n\nLeading digital twin solutions involve Asset Twinning, Component Twinning, System Twinning, Process and Workflow Twinning\n\n96.5% of vendors recognize the need for IIoT APIs and platform integration with digital twinning functionality for industrial verticals\n\n47.2% of executives across a broad spectrum of industry verticals understand the benefits of digital twinning and 63% of them plan to incorporate within their operations by 2029\n\nA digital twin is a virtual object representation of a real-world item in which the virtual is mapped to physical things in the real world such as equipment, robots, or virtually any connected business asset. This mapping in the digital world is facilitated by IoT platforms and software that is leveraged to create a digital representation of the physical asset.\n\nThe digital twin of a physical asset can provide data about its status such as its physical state and disposition. Conversely, a digital object may be used to manipulate and control a real-world asset by way of teleoperation. The publisher of this report sees this form of cyber-physical connectivity, signaling, and control as a key capability to realize the vision for Industry 4.0 to fully digitize production, servitization, and the `as a service` model for products.\n\nThere are many potential use cases for digital twinning including monitoring, simulation, and remote control of physical assets with virtual objects. Solutions focus on Part, Product, Process, and System twinning. Leading digital twin solutions involve Asset Twinning, Component Twinning, System Twinning, Process and Workflow Twinning. We see digital twinning playing a key role in many related IoT operations processes including IoT application development, testing, and control.\n\nThe implementation of digital twins will also enable distributed remote control of assets, which will place an increasingly heavy burden on IoT Identity management, authentication, and authorization. IoT authentication market solutions are also important in support of the \"things\" involved in IoT, which vary from devices used to detect, actuate, signal, engage, and more. This will become particularly important with respect to digital twin solution integration.\n\nAs reflected by the Digital Twin Consortium, we see some of the key industries to lead cyber-to-physical integration and solutions include aerospace, healthcare, manufacturing, military, natural resources, and public safety sectors. In terms of integrating digital twin technology and solutions with telecommunications and enterprise infrastructure, we see a need for careful planning from a systems integration, testing, and implementation perspective. This will be especially important in the case of mission-critical applications.\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n1. Executive Summary\n\n2.
