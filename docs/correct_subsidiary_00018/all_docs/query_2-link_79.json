        "text": "Synopsis\n\nUS-based chip design company Synopsys will help Tata Electronics in multiple aspects of its fab facility—India’s first—coming up in Gujarat and its assembly and testing unit in Assam, chief executive Sassine Ghazi told ET. Ghazi also met with Tata Electronics CEO Randhir Thakur and Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran in Mumbai. He held talks with Ola Cabs chief Bhavish Aggarwal in Bengaluru.\n\nUS-headquartered semiconductor design company Synopsys will help Tata Electronics ramp up designing of custom semiconductor products, help in factory automation, data analytics, computer-aided design and supply product design kits, and develop intellectual property for chip fabrication, chief executive Sassine Ghazi told ET.\n\nGhazi met Tata Electronics CEO Randhir Thakur and Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran in Mumbai. He also held talks with Ola Cabs chief Bhavish Aggarwal in Bengaluru.\n\nElevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill Courses\n\nOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteMIT xPROMIT Technology Leadership and InnovationVisitIndian School of BusinessProfessional Certificate in Product ManagementVisitIndian School of BusinessISB Product ManagementVisit\n\n“They (Tatas) are bringing the technology from a partner. We’re going to be working with them to tune it, bring it to their expectation of yield, power and performance and to bring their customers in,” he said.\n\nSynopsys’ collaboration with the Tatas will be like its partnerships with Rapidus, TSMC, Intel, Samsung and GlobalFoundries, he said. Synopsys will also provide IP and design tools to Ola’s artificial intelligence startup, Krutrim, to develop an AI chip and a digital twin of the Indian company’s electronics systems, Ghazi said.\n\n“We will be the on-ramp to help customers get to the fab because you can build the most beautiful, sophisticated manufacturing facility but if you don’t have enablement where you provide the IP, and how semiconductor companies design with certain rules, for the manufacturing capacity, you cannot use the manufacturing. We’re the leader in providing the IP and the enablement for the semiconductor to on-ramp to the fab,” he said.\n\nTata Electronics plans to build India’s first fab in Dholera, Gujarat, with an investment of $11 billion. Another Rs 27,000 crore will be invested in a greenfield facility at Jagiroad, Assam for the assembly and testing of semiconductor chips.\n\nDiscover the stories of your interest\n\nBlockchain\n\n5 Stories\n\nCyber-safety\n\n7 Stories\n\nFintech\n\n9 Stories\n\nE-comm\n\n9 Stories\n\nML\n\n8 Stories\n\nEdtech\n\n6 Stories\n\nTogether, these facilities will produce semiconductor chips for applications across automotive, mobile devices, AI and other key segments.\n\nAs construction of the facilities progresses, it is critical to grow partnerships across the entire semiconductor ecosystem spanning process and design technology, and equipment suppliers.\n\n“We are an enabler and there is a technology transfer that is happening. To enable that technology to go through the manufacturing process, there are tools that are required to enable that to happen and that is exactly what we are doing,” Rituparna Mandal, VP, customer success at Synopsys India, said.\n\nOla, Krutrim partnership\n\n“Anyone who is trying to design a chip will make the first call to us, especially for advanced chips or those required for data centres that he (Bhavish Aggarwal) is planning on building. He has already hired a leader and is expanding the team to architect and design a ‘future’ chip. We have engaged with them in a range of IP, tools, and expertise, to accelerate that effort,” Ghazi said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Aggarwal in a post on microblogging site X, said he had a meeting with Ghazi “on exploring the development of India’s first AI chip Krutrim”. More details would be announced on August 15, he wrote.\n\n“We will leave it to our customer when they want to announce (a deal), but we have an active engagement with them,” Ghazi said, hinting at an upcoming announcement from Ola.\n\nGhazi said technology, skilling and startups will be the three areas he expects opportunities for the company to participate in India.\n\n“There are several factors in the investment India is making which is very similar to other governments. One is from a technology resilience point of view, which we are in the middle of. Two, skills. We have a strong academic programme SARA (Synopsis Academic and Research Alliances), in collaboration with the Indian government and certain universities,” he said.\n\nSynopsys has partnered with IIT-Bombay, Indian Institute of Science, and Jadavpur University to develop talent for the chip industry and address workforce shortage as a part of SARA programme.\n\n“Last year, we trained 12,000 university students focused on specific domains where there is a shortage for that skill,” Ghazi said.\n\n“The third pillar is funding for startups to do certain execution,” he said about the government’s Chips to Startups (C2S) initiative that aims to train 85,000 people over five years in very large-scale integration and embedded system design.\n\nThe company’s target is to grow 15% compared to 2023. In the March quarter, Synopsys reported revenue of $1.46 billion. The company is also expecting 20% revenue uplift in the areas it applies artificial intelligence to, Ghazi said.\n\nOut of Synopsys’ 20,000 employees globally, more than 10,000 are software developers, with the rest being semiconductor design engineers.\n\n4 reasons why MFs are stocking up on CreditAccess Grameen and other microfinance lenders\n\nOnce declared dead, Nifty Next 50 is up 70%.
