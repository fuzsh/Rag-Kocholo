        "meta_description": "Since 2017, we have awarded over $269,000 in TechAccelR grants to 23 projects involving 56 professors and graduate students (29% female participants) who have also received personalized mentorship along with the funding in order to help them advance their research towards commercialization.  2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2018 2017 2015  2024    Production of High-Quality Spinel Nanoparticles  Professor Jeffrey Bergthorson, Kartik Mangalvedhe, PhD Candidate, both from Mechanical Engineering  Executive Summary  Spinel nanoparticles play a big role in today’s world with applications ranging from electronic industry to medical field due to their excellent properties associated with conduction, magnetism, catalysis, etc. (1). The production of high-quality nanoparticle spinel, a compound with the form AB2O4 where A and B are metals and O is oxygen, is an expensive and time-consuming process with current technologies. Furthermore, these processes lead to carbon emissions responsible for the global climate change. We have developed a technology that enables a cheap, quick, and carbon-free production of spinel. Currently, we have developed one type of nanoferrite spinel called Hercynite. Through the support of the grant, we would like to explore other spinels and study their properties for different applications.    A Cost Effective Infectable Lung Organoid for Drug Testing and Toxicological Studies  Professor Luc Mongeau, Dr. Malvika Nagrath, both from Mechanical Engineering, and Alicia Reyes Valenzuela, PhD Candidate, from Biological and Biomedical Engineering  Executive Summary  Lower respiratory tract (LRT) infections are the fourth leading cause of death worldwide and the available antiviral therapies do not effectively combat most of these viral infections. The existing models are inefficient to develop antiviral drugs. We have developed a unique 3D lung organoid (3DLO) model using a novel process that recapitulates complex morphological and biological aspects of the lung in a single dish providing an ideal model for the antiviral drug development. Next proof of principle experiment is to show 3DLOs’ capability to assess antiviral drug screening (ongoing), and that 3DLOs can be cryopreserved. With this grant, we aim to optimize the cryopreservation process. In parallel, we are working on automizing the 3DLO manufacturing using robotic device. Ultimately, automatically fabricated, and cryopreserved 3DLOs will be sold frozen, ready to use ‘off the shelf’, providing a high throughput invention enhancing the drug testing, especially in pandemics and epidemics.    3D Printed Ferroelectric Spinodoid Metamaterials  Professor Agus Sasmito, from Mining and Materials Engineering and Professor Hamid Akbarzadeh, from Bioresource Engineering  Executive Summary  With their intensified sensitivity to mechanical, electrical, and thermal stimuli, ferroelectric materials are widely utilized in sensors, actuators, and energy-harvesting devices. Introducing porosity has been a common method to enhance their sensitivity, while keeping them lightweight. However, existing fabrication techniques often constrain the improvement potential by limiting control over pore topology in ferroelectric materials. In this innovation, we introduce a specialized 3D printing platform capable of creating ferroelectric ceramics with customizable topologies, offering unprecedented design freedom. Moreover, we develop a systematic approach for designing ferroelectric metamaterials, leading to remarkable enhancements in piezoelectric (electromechanical coupling) and pyroelectric (thermoelectric coupling) properties.    Shared Autonomy Framework for Articulated Machines Operating in Field Conditions  Professor Inna Sharf, Ehsan Yousefi, PhD Candidate, both from Mechanical Engineering  Executive Summary  We are developing end-to-end shared autonomy solutions for optimized human-in-the-loop operation of heavy machinery. We achieve this through a safe integration of advanced AI and robotics tools. The key unique features of our shared autonomy framework are: (i) a variable (sliding) level of autonomy which, by design, adjusts to the operator skills and operation needs; (ii) a safe and mutually understandable human-robot cooperation and interaction. Thus, the autonomy is designed for a safe cooperation with the human operator and more broadly, to allow the human to operate the machine jointly with AI. The safety aspect is particularly critical to operation of heavy field machinery, under uncertain environmental and task conditions. Our technology, backed fundamental research and experimentation in the lab, will offer the following advantages: a) optimized decision-making by providing advanced planning solutions; b) increased productivity and lower costs through end-to-end control and less reliance on human operator; c) reduction of accidents, operator mental load and operator training time. As well, the technology will provide access to a wide range of data on the operator and their interaction with the machine. As discussed next, we have conducted preliminary market analysis, explored potential partnership and commercialization routes.    Nanowire-Based Substrate Release Layer for Mass-Transfer of μLEDs  Professor Songrui Zhao, from Electrical and Computer Engineering  Executive Summary  This project is to establish a technology related to the mass-transfer of micro/nano-scale light emitting diodes (μLEDs) using a nanowire-based substrate release layer. The success of this project will have a profound impact on semiconductor device industries, e.g., display, flexible electronics, to just name a few.   2023     A high-throughput microfluidic setup for rapid, automated and multiplexed antibiotic susceptibility testing  Professor Sara Mahshid, Sripadh Guptha Yedire, PhD Candidate, Seyed Imman Isaac Hosseini, PhD Candidate, and Tamer AbdelFatah, PhD Candidate, all from Bioengineering  Executive Summary  As antibiotic-resistant infections continue to rise, they are projected to become the second leading cause of death by 2050. Current antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) methods suffer from prolonged turnaround times, high costs, and labor-intensive processes, often leading to either overprescription or conjectural prescriptions. Consequently, the timely initiation of effective antibiotic treatments is of paramount importance, as each hour of delay increases mortality by 7%, especially in cases of severe sepsis. Here, we propose to develop a multiplex ultra-rapid AST device that reports on effective antibiotic regimes within just 20 minutes without any delay for clinical culture and user involvement. Our technology leverages additive manufacturing to advance multiplexing capacity of microfluidics to 96 parallel tests for measuring minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotics in an all-in-one device. This grant will provide the necessary resources to optimize the design and fabrication of the device and conduct proof-of-concept testing for preclinical validation. We aim to deliver a cost-effective, fast, and user-friendly AST solution, on par with 96-well plates in microbiology labs to reduce over-prescription and contribute to mitigating the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis.   Artificial intelligence powered optimization and automation toolkit for atomic-precision molecular-beam epitaxy material synthesis  Professor Jun Song, Mining & Materials Engineering, and Professor Songrui Zhao, Electrical and Computer Engineering  Executive Summary  Molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) is an advanced technology for high-precision material synthesis, but suffers from being highly cost and time intensive. This invention aims to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) powered automation apparatus to achieve automated, real-time material quality assessment and optimization of growth conditions, to provide drastic productivity/material quality enhancement and cost reduction for MBE growth of thin films, quantum dots and nanostructures. With this grant, we aim to accomplish the first proof of concept with validation, a well-informed go-to-market assessment, and to bring our technology from TRL3 to TRL5 level to prepare us for next stage of innovation.   Simple and portable time-delineated water sampling system  Professor Viviane Yargeau, Chemical Engineering  Executive Summary  There are currently no simple and affordable samplers for time-delineated water sampling on the market. The technology we developed will fill this need for environmental sampling and wastewater surveillance.    Highly Accurate and User-Friendly Contact Angle Analysis  Professor Anne-Marie Kietzig, Damon Aboud, PhD, Michael Wood, PhD, Mohammad Bagher Asadi, PhD and Gianluca Zeppetelli, all from Chemical Engineering  Executive Summary  Contact angle measurements (CAM), which are widely used in industry and academia alike, have the reputation of being a seemingly low cost and simple surface analysis technique owing to rather simple infrastructure requirements. However, literature showcases many examples of wrongly executed analysis and accordingly false conclusions being drawn on surface characteristics. Our novel software eliminates user error by automating key steps such as contact point determination and the identification of advancing and receding contact angles (CAs) and improves measurement accuracy by employing a novel curve fitting method. This grant will be mainly used to cover HQP salary expenses to advance our patent-pending invention from the laboratory to the market   Commercialization of a Universal, Multi-Functional Platform for Covalent and Oriented Antibody Immobilization for Cell Capture  Professor Corinne Hoesli, Hugo Level, PhD Candidate and Marc-Antoine Campeau, Postdoctoral researcher, all from Chemical Engineering  Executive Summary  Strategies to recruit high-potential regenerative cells is one of the pillars for emerging cell-based therapies. When it comes to implantable devices for instance, those cells could promote better healing and reduce the risks of critical implant failure. In the last decade, there has been an increasing academic and industrial effort to create surfaces that could take advantage of such cells, by capturing them directly from the blood flow. To this end, we patented a biofunctional surface treatment that could not only capture cells but also enhance their proliferative properties. Part of our technology relies on antibodies, as they have been largely studied for their specificity and flexibility. However, grafting antibodies is not trivial: getting a proper orientation is key to preserve the antibody target-binding efficiency. Current strategies often rely on random reactive moieties which can drastically hinder their efficiency. The use of larger binding protein fragments which usually provide a better orientation is also problematic for in vivo applications. To solve these issues, our strategy has been to use specific small peptide sequences that specifically anchor at the bottom of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of antibodies, ensuring the right orientation for maximum target-binding efficiency. Unfortunately, this approach is currently limited to only one isotype of antibody and relies on weak interaction bonds. The grant will be used to model a library of different peptides and antibody isotypes and explore the possible matches. Subsequent efficiency and stability of those interactions will be studied in vitro, so that we can further optimize the cell-binding capacities of our surface. This project will be of critical help to increase the relevance and readiness level of our invention before moving forward with industrial partners.   2022     PreFab: Prediction and Correction of Fabrication-Process-Induced Structural Variations in Nanophotonic Devices  Professor Odile Liboiron-Ladouceur and Dr. Dusan Gostimirovic, Post-Doctoral Researcher, both from Electrical and Computer Engineering  Executive Summary  The project consists of developing machine learning models of different fabrication facilities. Up to now, the models are based on the fabrication done at Applied NanoTools Inc. (ANT), which is an electron-beam lithography process used for low-volume production. Most commercial silicon photonics prototyping is fabricated in an optical lithography process which allows for more volume from the nature of its parallel patterning process. There are a few places in the world offering such fabrication. For research, my team has fabricated devices through AMF in Singapore, IMEC in Belgium, and IHP in Germany. The project would consist of developing models for AMF through the collaboration of CMC Microsystems. The technology has been validated and is currently at a technology readiness level 5. It requires software development, some product polishing for production and commercialization.   ‘Multimeter’ of the nano-age: a cost-effective system for multi-physics characterizations of ultrathin structures  Professor Changhong Cao, Mechanical Engineering  Executive Summary  As silicon-based electronics have almost reached their physical limitations, the class of ultra-thin structures (i.e., atomically thin two-dimensional materials (2DM)) is one of the most promising alternative building blocks due to their superior physical properties for next-generation electronics (e.g., photodetectors, field-effect transistors, solar cells). The market size of 2DM-based devices is projected to $203 billion by 2028. While exotic lab-scale 2DM electronics have been demonstrated with unprecedented performance, a critical step before they can be transferred to the marketplace is to assure their consistent performance (e.g., mechanical, electrical, etc.), which determines the long-term sustainability of this new generation of electronics. However, it is much more challenging to do quality check of 2DM-based than silicon-based devices because of their ultra-thin and delicate nature (nanometers thick). Our patent-pending technology, a single-chip micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) has significant advantages over the one product currently on the market. With the support from TechAccelR Grant, we will develop additional functionalities to make our system a ‘multi-meter’ for ultrathin structures on top of its existing mechanical characterization capability. The commercialization of our development will significantly accelerate the transfer of thin/ultra-thin structure-based applications to the marketplace to support a range of disruptive technologies including augmented reality (AR), autonomous vehicles (AV) and Internet of Things (IoT).   A feasibility study of the effect of high-frequency vibration on mandibular posture through hyoid bone-anchoring  Professor Natalie Reznikov, Bioengineering, Professor Julia Cohen Levy, Orthodontics, Professor Joyce Fung, School of Physical & Occupational Therapy, Dr. Alexei Morozov  Executive Summary  Sedentary lifestyle is a new reality of modern times, and it is harmful to human health in many ways ‒\"sitting is the new smoking.\" In particular, habitual stooping posture of the neck and the abnormally tucked-in position of the lower jaw lie at the root of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders and obstructive sleep apnea. While these conditions are not life-threatening, they are painful, and reduce quality of life in 1 person out of 10. We have designed a non-invasive physiotherapy device for the correction of a habitually poor posture of the mandible to alleviate dental clenching, TMJ disorders and neck pain, and to improve airway patency. By focally applying mechanical vibration to the attachment sites of certain muscles, this oscillating device will equilibrate muscle tone to restore the mandible to its normal, physiological resting position. We propose a preclinical feasibility study to test our patent pending device as an essential step towards clinical trials and commercialization.   On-Chip Chemiluminescence Biosensor for Food Safety  Professor Sebastian Wachsmann-Hogiu and Dr. Juanjuan Liu, research associate, both from Bioengineering  Executive Summary  Pathogenic contamination of food is one of the major issues for foodborne illness. Hence, food safety inspection and quality control with food pathogen detection is of significance. Commonly used techniques for food pathogen detection include culture-based methods and nucleic acid-based methods such as PCR. These techniques are time-consuming, tedious, and are highly demanding for laboratory consumables and equipment. Our proposal is aimed at the identification and quantitation of food pathogens using our novel chemiluminescence technology.  We anticipate that our approach will overall speed up the cleanliness assessment and increase the uptime for the processing facility or kitchens. Successful validation will lead to a robust tool for food safety inspection and quality control.    Vascularized bioartificial pancreas for the treatment of diabetes  Professor Corinne Hoesli, Chemical Engineering, Jonathan Brassard, PhD candidate, Biological and Biomedical Engineering, Professor Richard Leask, Chemical Engineering, Professor Steven Paraskevas, Surgery  Executive Summary  Insulin injections is the current treatment for diabetes but fails to eliminate the related health risks associated with periods of hypo and hyperglycemia. In the last decades, transplantation of cadaveric islets has shown major glycemic control improvement compared to insulin treatment, drastically ameliorating the life of patients. Islet transplantation, however, is currently limited to a minuscule proportion of patient suffering from diabetes (",

However, literature showcases many examples of wrongly executed analysis and accordingly false conclusions being drawn on surface characteristics. Our novel software eliminates user error by automating key steps such as contact point determination and the identification of advancing and receding contact angles (CAs) and improves measurement accuracy by employing a novel curve fitting method. This grant will be mainly used to cover HQP salary expenses to advance our patent-pending invention from the laboratory to the market\n\nCommercialization of a Universal, Multi-Functional Platform for Covalent and Oriented Antibody Immobilization for Cell Capture\n\nProfessor Corinne Hoesli, Hugo Level, PhD Candidate and Marc-Antoine Campeau, Postdoctoral researcher, all from Chemical Engineering\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nStrategies to recruit high-potential regenerative cells is one of the pillars for emerging cell-based therapies. When it comes to implantable devices for instance, those cells could promote better healing and reduce the risks of critical implant failure. In the last decade, there has been an increasing academic and industrial effort to create surfaces that could take advantage of such cells, by capturing them directly from the blood flow. To this end, we patented a biofunctional surface treatment that could not only capture cells but also enhance their proliferative properties. Part of our technology relies on antibodies, as they have been largely studied for their specificity and flexibility. However, grafting antibodies is not trivial: getting a proper orientation is key to preserve the antibody target-binding efficiency. Current strategies often rely on random reactive moieties which can drastically hinder their efficiency. The use of larger binding protein fragments which usually provide a better orientation is also problematic for in vivo applications. To solve these issues, our strategy has been to use specific small peptide sequences that specifically anchor at the bottom of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of antibodies, ensuring the right orientation for maximum target-binding efficiency. Unfortunately, this approach is currently limited to only one isotype of antibody and relies on weak interaction bonds. The grant will be used to model a library of different peptides and antibody isotypes and explore the possible matches. Subsequent efficiency and stability of those interactions will be studied in vitro, so that we can further optimize the cell-binding capacities of our surface. This project will be of critical help to increase the relevance and readiness level of our invention before moving forward with industrial partners.\n\nPreFab: Prediction and Correction of Fabrication-Process-Induced Structural Variations in Nanophotonic Devices\n\nProfessor Odile Liboiron-Ladouceur and Dr. Dusan Gostimirovic, Post-Doctoral Researcher, both from Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe project consists of developing machine learning models of different fabrication facilities. Up to now, the models are based on the fabrication done at Applied NanoTools Inc. (ANT), which is an electron-beam lithography process used for low-volume production. Most commercial silicon photonics prototyping is fabricated in an optical lithography process which allows for more volume from the nature of its parallel patterning process. There are a few places in the world offering such fabrication. For research, my team has fabricated devices through AMF in Singapore, IMEC in Belgium, and IHP in Germany. The project would consist of developing models for AMF through the collaboration of CMC Microsystems. The technology has been validated and is currently at a technology readiness level 5. It requires software development, some product polishing for production and commercialization.\n\n‘Multimeter’ of the nano-age: a cost-effective system for multi-physics characterizations of ultrathin structures\n\nProfessor Changhong Cao, Mechanical Engineering\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nAs silicon-based electronics have almost reached their physical limitations, the class of ultra-thin structures (i.e., atomically thin two-dimensional materials (2DM)) is one of the most promising alternative building blocks due to their superior physical properties for next-generation electronics (e.g., photodetectors, field-effect transistors, solar cells). The market size of 2DM-based devices is projected to $203 billion by 2028. While exotic lab-scale 2DM electronics have been demonstrated with unprecedented performance, a critical step before they can be transferred to the marketplace is to assure their consistent performance (e.g., mechanical, electrical, etc.), which determines the long-term sustainability of this new generation of electronics. However, it is much more challenging to do quality check of 2DM-based than silicon-based devices because of their ultra-thin and delicate nature (nanometers thick). Our patent-pending technology, a single-chip micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) has significant advantages over the one product currently on the market. With the support from TechAccelR Grant, we will develop additional functionalities to make our system a ‘multi-meter’ for ultrathin structures on top of its existing mechanical characterization capability. The commercialization of our development will significantly accelerate the transfer of thin/ultra-thin structure-based applications to the marketplace to support a range of disruptive technologies including augmented reality (AR), autonomous vehicles (AV) and Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nA feasibility study of the effect of high-frequency vibration on mandibular posture through hyoid bone-anchoring\n\nProfessor Natalie Reznikov, Bioengineering, Professor Julia Cohen Levy, Orthodontics, Professor Joyce Fung, School of Physical & Occupational Therapy, Dr. Alexei Morozov\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nSedentary lifestyle is a new reality of modern times, and it is harmful to human health in many ways ‒\"sitting is the new smoking.\" In particular, habitual stooping posture of the neck and the abnormally tucked-in position of the lower jaw lie at the root of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders and obstructive sleep apnea. While these conditions are not life-threatening, they are painful, and reduce quality of life in 1 person out of 10. We have designed a non-invasive physiotherapy device for the correction of a habitually poor posture of the mandible to alleviate dental clenching, TMJ disorders and neck pain, and to improve airway patency. By focally applying mechanical vibration to the attachment sites of certain muscles, this oscillating device will equilibrate muscle tone to restore the mandible to its normal, physiological resting position. We propose a preclinical feasibility study to test our patent pending device as an essential step towards clinical trials and commercialization.\n\nOn-Chip Chemiluminescence Biosensor for Food Safety\n\nProfessor Sebastian Wachsmann-Hogiu and Dr. Juanjuan Liu, research associate, both from Bioengineering\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nPathogenic contamination of food is one of the major issues for foodborne illness. Hence, food safety inspection and quality control with food pathogen detection is of significance. Commonly used techniques for food pathogen detection include culture-based methods and nucleic acid-based methods such as PCR. These techniques are time-consuming, tedious, and are highly demanding for laboratory consumables and equipment. Our proposal is aimed at the identification and quantitation of food pathogens using our novel chemiluminescence technology.\n\nWe anticipate that our approach will overall speed up the cleanliness assessment and increase the uptime for the processing facility or kitchens. Successful validation will lead to a robust tool for food safety inspection and quality control.\n\nVascularized bioartificial pancreas for the treatment of diabetes\n\nProfessor Corinne Hoesli, Chemical Engineering, Jonathan Brassard, PhD candidate, Biological and Biomedical Engineering, Professor Richard Leask, Chemical Engineering, Professor Steven Paraskevas, Surgery\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nInsulin injections is the current treatment for diabetes but fails to eliminate the related health risks associated with periods of hypo and hyperglycemia. In the last decades, transplantation of cadaveric islets has shown major glycemic control improvement compared to insulin treatment, drastically ameliorating the life of patients. Islet transplantation, however, is currently limited to a minuscule proportion of patient suffering from diabetes (<1%), for whom the lifelong immunosuppression needed to avoid graft rejection outweighs the health complications linked to their uncontrolled glycemia. We have developed an encapsulation device that can both protect the cells from the immune system and allow the graft to regulate blood glucose through insulin secretion, opening the market to the 100 million people needing insulin worldwide ($30 billion annual market). The TechAccelR Grant will help us validate our device in an ex vivo perfusion system, enabling us to prepare for a future pilot study in large animals.\n\nOptimizing Sequential Decision-Making (A/B Testing)\n\nProfessor Daniel Varro, Sebastian Pilarski, PhD candidate, both from Electrical and Computer Engineering; and Slawomir Pilarski (Versyn)\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nSequential decision-making such as A/B testing is commonly required across many modern industries. Optimizing such decisions is often at the core of business success. Today, most businesses rely upon time-consuming and suboptimal manual processes. More sophisticated businesses make use of existing optimization solutions such as reinforcement learning multi-armed bandit algorithms. However, A/B-style sequential decision-making may exhibit delayed information response (e.g., a retailer does not sell all products immediately after stocking; there is a time delay between the stocking decision and the products being purchased). Such delays make optimization via manual decision-making extremely labor intensive. They also result in tremendously sub-optimal decisions. Moreover, existing automated solutions provide very poor decisions when decision feedback is delayed. We have developed state-of-the-art multi-armed bandit methodologies for optimizing sequential decision-making in the presence of delay. These methodologies significantly outperform existing solutions. The TechAccelR Grant will enable us to build prototypes of our technology for specific industrial retail business cases. In doing so, it would empower us to shift our focus from academic research to commercialization-focused research and development. Our technology has the power to transform businesses into more competitive, high-efficiency operations by improving required core decision-making.\n\nAdditive that Prevents Surface Defects in PVC Films\n\nProfessor Milan Maric, Professor Richard Leask, both Chemical Engineering and Professor Jim Nicell, Civil Engineering\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nGas checks are visible fleck-shaped defects that occur on the surface of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) films during industrial calendering. Films containing these surface defects often do not meet minimum product specifications and therefore must be disposed of or recycled, resulting in increased cost and material waste. Currently, gas checks are controlled by keeping film gauge low and through trial-and-error modifications of processing parameters by calender operators. We found that a series of poly(caprolactone) (PCL)‐based compounds with diester linkers and alkyl chain cappers were all effective at preventing the formation of gas checks during calendering, with additive concentrations as low as 8 phr producing films with no gas checks.\n\nHigh Temperature Te-Based Solder Alloys\n\nProfessor Mathieu Brochu and Dr. Sunyong Kwon, postdoctoral fellow, Materials Engineering\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nHigh-temperature solders require solidus temperature at least 270 °C and the liquidus temperature at most 350 °C. Small solidification ranges are preferred to avoid solidification defects. The conventional high-temperature solders mainly comprise of Pb, which include Pb-5Sn, Pb-10Sn, Pb-5Ag, Pb-2Ag-8Sn, etc. Sn-based solder alloys are currently used for lead-free solders; but they suffer from high temperature properties due to their low solidus temperature (<260 °C). Alternatively, Bi-based solder alloys were invented (e.g. Bi-Ag), but their solidus temperature (262 °C) is still considered relatively low. For this reason, Pb-based alloys for HT solder applications have been exempted from the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), but this exemption will not be permanent. The present invention provides four alloy compositions, whose eutectic temperatures ranging from 300 to 350 °C depending upon compositions. The alloys contain over 50 atomic percent Te, and an effective amount of Ag and Cu, optionally with Sn. Although Te is mildly toxic for humans, it is not hazardous for the environment. As such, Te is not listed in RoHS. Te has been used as an essential element for photovoltaic solar cell and thermoelectric materials. The technological limitation to be addressed is to develop lead-free, high solidus temperature, high service temperature alloys. The main advantage of the invention is the ideal eutectic temperatures (small solidification range) for high-temperature solder applications. In addition, Te is less reactive to oxygen than Bi and Sn, as such, oxidation during soldering can be reduced.\n\nAccelerated Alloy Discovery Through Machine Learning: The KASSANDRA Method\n\nProfessor Mihriban O. Pekguleryuz and Dr. Luis Angel Villegas-Armenta, postdoctoral researcher, Materials Engineering\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nDesigning new materials is crucial to face the ever-increasing engineering challenges of the future. Particularly for metals, the light-alloy design is a process that involves great time and expenses to perfect a proposed material. This is traditionally done by incrementally adding elements to an alloy and testing various heat treatments until the desired properties are obtained, which involves substantial work at each iteration. The KASSANDRA method is a novel solution to design light alloys that relies on artificial intelligence to dramatically accelerate the design process. It is a flexible approach that can be applied to a wide range of challenges: mechanical resistance, corrosion resistance, ductility improvement, cost reduction and more. It has the potential to reduce the development process from years to weeks, reducing costs and giving companies a competitive edge over others traditional approaches.\n\nSpecifically, a CMOS imaging sensor is coupled with a sample microfluidic system. Samples swabbed from regions with high fluorescence will be placed on the microfluidic channels/wells on top of the CMOS sensor. Light will be generated during the ATP-mediated chemiluminescence reaction from the samples containing aerobic microorganisms, and the emitted light will be recorded and further analyzed for quantitatitation. We anticipate that a combined fluorescence and chemiluminescence approach will overall speed up the cleanliness assessment and increase the uptime for the processing facility or kitchens. Within the frame of this proposal, we will work on the adaptation and validation of the ATP chemiluminescence detection on a CMOS sensor and evaluate its use in conjunction with the CSI-D fluorescence device. Successful validation of this combined approach will lead to a robust tool for food safety inspection and quality control."
