        "text": "“The megatrends of AI, silicon proliferation and software-defined systems are requiring more compute performance and efficiency in the face of growing, systemic complexity. Bringing together Synopsys’ industry-leading EDA solutions with Ansys’ world-class simulation and analysis capabilities … is the logical next step for our successful, seven-year partnership,” said Sassine Ghazi, president and CEO of Synopsys.\n\n“Since inception 37 years ago, Synopsys has been an innovation pioneer, central to world-changing semiconductor advances in computation, networking, and mobility, and now enabling the new era of ‘pervasive intelligence’,” said Aart de Geus, executive chair and founder of Synopsys.\n\n“For more than fifty years, Ansys has enabled customers to design, develop and deliver cutting-edge products that are limited only by imagination. By joining forces with Synopsys, we will amplify our joint efforts to drive new levels of customer innovation,” said Ajei Gopal, president and CEO of Ansys.\n\nAnsys Zemax’s industry-leading optical product design and simulation software, OpticStudio, OpticStudio STAR Module, OpticsBuilder, and OpticsViewer, helps optical, mechanical, and manufacturing engineering teams to design their systems. Standardizing on Ansys Zemax software reduces design iterations and repeated prototypes, speeding time to market and reducing development costs.\n\nThe transaction is anticipated to close in the first half of 2025, subject to approval by Ansys shareholders, the receipt of required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
