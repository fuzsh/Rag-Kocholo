        "text": "We are in collaboration with Synopsys to accelerate the development and validation of software features and applications for the Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV). This partnership marks a significant step for Continental in accelerating automotive software development and system testing. This collaboration integrates Synopsys’ industry-leading virtual prototyping solutions for virtual Electronic Control Units (vECU) within Continental’s Automotive Edge (CAEdge) cloud-based development framework, resulting in digital twin capabilities for accelerated software development and reduced time to market.\n\nThe modern SDV promises drivers a cutting-edge user experience with continuously improved and enhanced software features. OEMs and suppliers rely on comprehensive tools to simulate the performance of digital features and confirm their compatibility with existing and new car models to fulfill this demand. Our CAEdge framework provides vehicle manufacturers and their partners with a cloud-based development environment for software-intensive vehicle architectures to develop solutions in a fraction of the time traditionally needed. Within this framework, digital representations of the real-world physical devices, such as vECUs and the vehicle digital twin, facilitate the development and validation of software solutions prior to general hardware availability."
