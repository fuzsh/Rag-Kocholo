        "text": "Market Report Description\n\nThe Global Technology CAD Software Market size is expected to reach $272.7 Million by 2026, rising at a market growth of 12.3% CAGR during the forecast period. Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) is an imitation software that is used to design and augment semiconductor processing devices and technologies. Technology Computer-aided design has basically two major functions that are process simulation and device simulation. The software achieves these functions by taking the description of the device behavior, transistor layout, and fabrication process in order to make silicon. By using model-based simulation, technology Computer-aided design expands wafer yield. It is used mostly used by semiconductor or Integrated Circuit (IC) manufacturers to decrease the time consumed for testing wafer runs for the development of a new device. Technology Computer-aided design enhances process modules and decreases the development of experimental cycles.\n\nTechnology CAD Software Market Size, By Application, 2020-2026\n\nIt also escalates the yield and stoutness and captures then analyses the effect of process variation on the performance of the device. These factors are expected to drive the growth of the market for CAD software technology over the foreseeable period. Advancements in technology and the growing adoption of more advanced electronics components in the healthcare industry are getting more evident. For example, the introduction of smart healthcare systems, like Implantable and Wearable Medical Devices (IWMD), and the occurrence of transformative technologies, have a positive impact on market growth. Moreover, the growing usage of digital equipment, like computer-controlled medical equipment, is likely to encourage the manufacturers of this equipment to adopt TCAD software in order to design the necessary PCBs and MCMs.\n\nTechnology CAD Software Market Share, By Region, 2019\n\nThe growth of the CAD software market has shown a fall in the year 2020, due to the outbreak of COVID-19 that resulted in complete lockdown in many countries. Many factors like break-in production in several industries due to the partial or complete lockdown have been considered to be responsible for the slow growth of the market in 2020. Moreover, in the entertainment, and media industry, there has been an intermittent interruption in the production of movie and advertisements. Moreover, the construction of the building has also been on hold in some countries, thus decreasing the demand for CAD software.\n\nTechnology CAD Software Market Report Coverage Report Attribute Details Market size value in 2019 USD 140 Million Market size forecast in 2026 USD 272.7 Million Base Year 2019 Historical Period 2016 to 2018 Forecast Period 2020 to 2026 Revenue Growth Rate CAGR of 12.3% from 2020 to 2026 Number of Pages 133 Number of Tables 183 Report coverage Market Trends, Revenue Estimation and Forecast, Segmentation Analysis, Regional and Country Breakdown, Competition Analysis, Companies Strategic Developments, Company Profiling Segments covered Application, Region Country scope US, Canada, Mexico, Germany, UK, France, Russia, Spain, Italy, China, Japan, India, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Brazil, Argentina, UAE, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Nigeria Growth Drivers\n\nAdvancements in technology & Increased penetration of IoT\n\nAdoption of CAD in designing smart healthcare devices\n\nRestraints\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 slowed down the manufacturing process\n\nBased on Application, the market is segmented into Solar Cells, Analog/RF Devices, Image Sensors and CMOS.
