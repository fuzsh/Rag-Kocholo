Embark on an exciting exploration into the realms of optical design and #simulation with our latest Ansys Innovation Course: Car Projection Lamp Simulation using Ansys Speos. The principle of car projection lamps involves directing #LED light into a film and then refracting it through a lens to project-specific images from the film onto objects. This design is primarily used for illuminating the ground area near the car doors during nighttime. Typically, we start by designing and optimizing the lenses using Ansys Zemax #OpticStudio and then import the optimized lens into Ansys #Speos for simulation. This free course will demonstrate light simulation for car projection lamps and conduct reverse ray tracing and visual effects analysis. Course Content: Lesson 1: Example Device for Car Projection Lamp Lesson 2: Set Up the Simulation for Car Projection Lamp Lesson 3: Run the Simulation for Car Projection Lamp Lesson 4: Analyzing Results for Car Projection Lamp üìã Register today for this free course today: https://ansys.me/3uIldH3 üìö Additional Resources: On-Demand Webinar: Optical Design and Simulation of a Logo Projection System with Ansys Optics https://ansys.me/3OHH4VP #AnsysInnovationCourses #Optics #projectionlamps\n\nüí° Tech Tip Tuesdays with #Ansys #Optics: enhanced filtering & path analysis options When using Ansys Zemax OpticStudio in non-sequential mode, ray filters and path analysis options are useful to isolate ray paths. They may be used to get a cleaner view of a specific set of rays, and/or analyze its properties. The 2024 R1 update comes with new options, particularly useful for more complex systems using diffractive optical elements, like AR/VR for instance. Additional properties can be tracked and filtered using the new filters X_TIR, X_DIFF, and X_NDIF which filter for TIR events at a specific object or face, diffraction events at a particular object or face, and a total number of diffraction events, respectively. Note that X_TIR, X_DIFF like many other filters now support the object and object.face formats. For example, X_DIFF(n,xo,yo) and X_DIFF(n.f,xo,yo) if you need to consider the object n, or a specific face f for this object. Additionally, the new filter X_GHOSTN returns rays that ghosted a specific number of times at a particular object or face. Then, the X_SEQ filter identifies the rays that follow the sequence specified n1.f1 , n2.f2, .. n#, f#. Where n# is the object number and f# is the corresponding face number. The filter supports diffraction orders when specified. For example, X_SEQ(2,4.1/(2,*),4.2) will return the ray that originated in source 2 and diffracted in object 4 face 1 (diffraction order xo=2, and yo=none) and ended in object 4 and face 2. These filters can be used in the 3D views, in analysis windows and in the Zemax Ray Database (ZRD) file viewer. This ZRD viewer has also been improved to include new ray segment properties: total internal reflection (TIR) as a flag, optical path length (OPL) in lens units, OPL in wave units, and diffraction orders, providing valuable additional insight on the system. The path analysis tool then leverages these ZRD enhancements to increase insights and data usability in complex systems. The tool now constructs path sequences using objects‚Äô faces and diffraction orders along the ray path. The path sequence includes object and face using the object.face notation and diffraction using the /(OrderX,OrderY) notation. Additionally, the path sequences can now be sorted by two new options: Average Optical Path Length and Number of Diffraction Events. üìΩÔ∏è Want to learn more about the features included in the Ansys Optics 2024 R1 Release Join our next webinar: Ansys 2024 R1: Ansys Optics What‚Äôs New February 14 I 11:00 am EST https://ansys.me/3HZHq6K üìöAdditional Resources: Knowledgebase Article: Identifying specific rays using filter strings ‚Äìhttps://ansys.me/42CehYA Ansys Zemax OpticStudio 2024 R1 Release Notes - https://ansys.me/3SEtMup #Ansys2024R1 #ARVR\n\nWe are thrilled to unveil the #Ansys 2024 R1 Release of Ansys Lumerical, Ansys Speos and Ansys Zemax, packed with cutting-edge features and enhancements to take your optical design and #simulation experience to the next level.
