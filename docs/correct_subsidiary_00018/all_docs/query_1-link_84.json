New use cases of semiconductors in automotive such as in-vehicle networks and vehicle to cloud connections lead to new architectures abandoning the unsecure ECU based network, by moving to architecture domain controllers and eventually to a central zonal architecture controlled by a vehicle server. Ensuring these systems are both functionally safe and secure from cyberattacks has become mission critical.

The need for rapidly processing and enhancing incoming camera images or quickly resolving objects in a LiDAR image is driving growth in the processing requirements for automotive smart sensors and edge devices. Additionally, these edge devices, which often incorporate programmable elements in the form of classic control CPUs or high-throughput DSPs, must also meet stringent functional safety requirements such as those specified by ISO 26262. In one classic model for functional safety, the edge devices are protected against random faults to the ASIL-B level, while sending fault information to an ASIL-D certified centralized device that would be in charge of managing the safety goals for the entire subsystem. However, as intelligence in the edge grows, it is often necessary for these edge devices to manage their own safety requirements, thereby requiring ASIL-D level of protection from random faults. SOC vendors addressing this market would often need to develop two classes of devices, some certified to ASIL-B and others certified to ASIL-D. Additionally, these devices must also be secured from attacks by malicious entities. Cadence's Tensilica IP processors include CPUs and DSPs for automotive applications such as radar and LiDAR processing, camera and sensor image enhancement, ADAS, auto infotainment and sensor fusion. In this session, learn how Cadence Tensilica processors can be used to create a flexible, functionally safe subsystem that can meet either ASIL-B or ASIL-D requirements through the use of its FlexLock dual-core lockstep capability, while also addressing the need for increasing security at the hardware level. You will also learn how Tensilica processors can be uniquely tailored to the end user's application requirements, and how Cadence provides its users with an ASIL-D certified compiler toolchain for the development of functionally safe firmware to run on these smart devices. ...\n\nOnline Only\n\n2.30 pm\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nChairperson: Andrea Battistella - Imagination Technologies Group Ltd.

Each nearbAI core is an efficient neural network inference engine. The L3-Optimizer technology enables the user to optimize the solution in terms of area, power and performance. Our proof of concept implements live face detection on the Kria KV260 FPGA board with an inference time of 5ms with core running at 200MHz. ASIC synthesis using TSMC 22nm ULP technology for a medium core - 512 MACs - infers in 3.6ms at 300 MHz and consumes an average of 140 mW, with peak power at 280 mW. (Average power is estimated to be 20-30 mW when using TSMC 5 nm technology). The inference time for the medium core running at 600MHz is 1.7ms.

What are the challenges in developing PUF? What system considerations should be considered for a PUF to generate a secure cryptographic key? In this presentation, we describe the challenges which need to be overcome when developing PUFs, and we take a deep dive into lessons learned as we developed our 2nd generation quantum driven PUF, QDID. ...\n\nRuud Derwig\n\nSenior Principal Architect\n\nSynopsys, Inc.\n\nPost-Quantum Cryptography: Theory to Accelerated Practice\n\nPost-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) has received a fair amount of attention over the past few years, especially with the quantum threat becoming a closer reality. NIST's PQC standardization process is fully underway. Just recently, a significant milestone of the path where the PQC algorithms are gradually becoming the cryptographic default was achieved – NIST has announced the first set of standardized PQC algorithms. For transition to PQC, there are various challenges to overcome in commercial solutions. Crypto agility is required in protocols and implementations such that today's algorithms can be seamlessly replaced with the PQC alternatives. Agility in software via firmware updates is much easier than agility in hardware. However, like today's algorithms, hardware acceleration and implementation are required for PQC to meet performance and security targets. ...\n\nGeert-Jan Schrijen\n\nCTO\n\nIntrinsic ID\n\nBuilding a Root of Trust with SRAM PUF and tRoot HSM\n\nAn embedded Hardware Security Module (HSM) is one of the strongest ways to implement secure authentication, trusted communication, and data protection on SoCs. Combining such an HSM with Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) technology adds an additional layer of protection by generating secure cryptographic keys from device-unique variations within the silicon of the chip itself. PUF technology enables reconstruction of a cryptographic root key every time the chip is powered up without storing any sensitive data in non-volatile memory, making it significantly harder for attackers to obtain key material and thereby substantially raising the level of security. We show how the Synopsys tRoot HSM is combined with Intrinsic ID's SRAM PUF technology to provide a complete security offering for modern SoCs. ...\n\nIsmail Guedira\n\nHead of Sales EMEA\n\nSecure-IC\n\nThe importance of security lifecycle management\n\nTo ensure a fully managed and secure end-to-end cybersecurity solution, it is necessary to have full control over the product lifecycle and its security. A lifecycle management solution ensures at every stage of a product's life, from IC manufacturing, to the field deployment and then the decommissioning of devices that include those ICs, that product security is maintained, and that each stakeholder only has access to the relevant functions and services at each step of the product's life. Especially for connected devices lifecycle management, a comprehensive chip to cloud solution that enables provisioning, device management, device monitoring and device identity management, and offers differentiated security services for chip manufacturers and users can bring high additional value to the products. ...\n\n6 pm\n\nHave you visited all the booths ?\n\n7.30 pm\n\nWine tasting contest !!!\n\n8 pm\n\nD&R 25th Anniversary Banquet !!!\n\n8.40 am\n\nChiplet and Die-to-Die Interface\n\nChairperson: Nicolas Gaude - Dolphin Design (About me)\n\nLetizia Giuliano\n\nVice President Solution Engineering\n\nAlphawave Semi\n\nChiplet and Die-to-Die Interface Interoperability - how to accelerate path to a real Open Ecosystem\n\nHeterogeneous chiplet-based designs enable the integration of die from multiple process nodes and vendors into a single-package product. This emerging technology is needed to boost compute power while building cost-effective systems for High-Performance Computing (HPC), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine-Learning System On Chip (ML SOC) products. In this paper, we introduce industry efforts to accelerate the chiplet ecosystem and the key metrics used to ensure design and technology interoperability between chiplet die coming from different sources. Today, most chiplet-based logic products are based on closed interfaces and integrate die from a single company, thereby creating silos of inter-company technical specifications, workflows, and business requirements. It is an obvious choice for the industry to demand more with regards to chiplet integration and have reason to accelerate its adoption. Efforts to build an ecosystem for chiplets have been materialized through the standardization of Die-to-Die (D2D) IP subsystem interfaces for plug-in solutions (thereby addressing interoperability at different levels) by the Open Domain-Specific Architecture (ODSA) Working Group, the Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF), and most recently, the Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) . The chiplet industry has placed more emphasis on the newer UCIe specification due to its completeness on what is required for an open D2D interface; this translates into new opportunitiesas well as challengesin testing standards compliance for multi-chiplet products. The opportunity to leverage established protocol interfaces and practices readily available by product designers means that those currently integrating interfaces, such as PCIe and CXL protocols, can simply reuse proven methodologies. While the challenge in enabling a high degree of interoperability using standard defined form factors and test structures when integrating different chiplets across multiple vendors is not to be underestimated, this enablement of interface/practice democratization on the concept of chiplet product will be invaluable. This paper reviews recent developments in chiplet interoperability metrics (including protocol layer definitions and physical interfaces) by leveraging current industry work on PCIe and CXL protocols and High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) interfaces. This paper also discusses the extension of chiplets to test products based on open D2D interfaces. After defining the path towards protocol and electrical interface compliance, product designers will then have to address packaging and test challenges that will be inherent when integrating chiplets from multiple vendors. Thus, this paper further discusses how the work in HBM interfaces and Design For Test (DFT) scan standards for system-in-package devices can be extended to heterogenous chiplet-based products. ...\n\nAndreas Vielhaber\n\nSr. Staff Application Engineer\n\nSynopsys, Inc.\n\nStrength of UCIe for Multi-Die Systems\n\n9.20 am\n\nLow Power Design\n\nChairperson: Nicolas Gaude - Dolphin Design (About me)\n\nKen Potts\n\nCOO\n\nAlphacore, Inc.\n\nFDSOI High speed, low power hybrid ADC's for Communications, AI, and Automotive applications\n\nAlphacore has continued to expand the FDSOI offering at GF22FDX.

This protocol offers a connection-oriented communication that guarantees the data delivery through data acknowledgments and retransmissions, while also implementing flow control and congestion control mechanisms. The performance of the implementation depends not only on the design itself but also on the included protocol features that allow efficient operation in different network environments and different peers. In unreliable or highly congested networks, where packet loss is very common, the implementation of congestion control methods is crucial to avoid overwhelming the network while maintaining an equilibrium between conservative behavior and aggressive claiming of additional bandwidth. In addition, different transmit and receive policies affect the network performance since the transmission of small data packets and acknowledments consumes the bandwidth, whereas sending larger packets is generally more efficient. Finally, the TCP protocol is tightly coupled with other network protocols, the integration of whom in a single solution can provide seamless communication for a higher-layer application over the network. The TCPIP-1G/10G core from CAST implements a complete TCP/IP Hardware Protocol Stack, which opens, maintains, and closes TCP connections. The system integrating the TCPIP-1G/10G core can configure network parameters and preferences by accessing its control registers, and the core is then able to receive and send data via streaming data interfaces. The highly configurable core can adapt to different applications and diverse system requirements while offering low-latency communication and considering the performance of the network. ...\n\n12.30 pm\n\nEnjoy your Lunch Break, sit down with your client and rest in \"Le Jardin\"\n\n1.30 pm\n\nVideo & Imaging IP\n\nChairperson: Nikos Zervas - CAST, Inc.\n\nMahmoud Banna\n\nGeneral Manager\n\nMixel, Inc.\n\nLeveraging MIPI DSI-2 & MIPI CSI-2 Low-Power Display and Camera FPGA-based Subsystems\n\nThis presentation looks at how MIPI D-PHY℠, MIPI CSI-2® and MIPI DSI-2℠ specifications were implemented on an FPGA IC supporting a wide range of applications for smart phones, tablets, wearables, VR headsets and other devices.

The LMR CODEC is the smallest visually lossless CODEC in the industry, with a gate count equivalent to 500 pixels. The core can be used for saving silicon area for any line memory which is longer than 1k pixels. For 4K+ imaging subsystems the area saving and corresponding power saving, when using LMR is significant. This is increasingly important for sub 10nm designs, as memory no longer scales at the same rate as logic, at these process nodes. LMR IP can be used in convolution blocks, scalers and other filters used in camera and display pipelines. In addition LMR IP can be used to reduce the size of memory in Computer Vision accelerators, line/tile memory in GPUs and line buffers in SLAM accelerators. With the emerging AR/VR headset market, the need to reduce power by replacing DRAM with on chip SRAM is becoming paramount. LMR IP can reduce this SRAM area by 50% so helping to reduce cost and power. ...\n\n2.10 pm\n\nIP based SoC Design\n\nChairperson: Pascal Vivet - CEA (About me)\n\nChouki Aktouf\n\nCEO/CTO\n\nDefacto Technologies\n\nUnified methodology for SoC design assembly including logic, power and timing constraints\n\nDefacto's presentation will focus on a unified methodology to build complex SoCs at the front-end by managing jointly several dimensions including logic, power intent and timing constraints. Such methodology is made possible thanks to unified data structure were an SoC is described by capturing simultaneously information given RTL description, UPF description, SDC description, etc. with open APIs to let designers extract information from such data structure and update them.\n\nUnified design assembly means having the same level of automation when managing the SoC logic, the power intent, the timing constraints, etc.. During the assembly process, designers expect ease insertion of internal and third party IPS and promoting design information (RTL, IPXACT, UPF, SDC, ..) to the top level. Such a methodology also requires an underlining checking capabilities like coherency between different design files. To make such methodology real, advanced EDA tools and platforms are needed.\n\n...\n\nIlya Temnikov\n\nDirector of EDA Engineering\n\nThalia\n\nwith Jean-Francois Lambert\n\nDirector of Business Development\n\nThalia\n\nTackling ROIC SoC Design Reuse challenges with AMALIA platform\n\nA high-quality image processing IC design company needed to reuse their readout IC from 350 nm to 180 nm.

The platform allowed Thalia and the customer to analyse and estimate the impact of the new technology on both design, performance and to minimize any impact on the system development schedule. A successful IP migration and thorough analysis of the target process means the customer was able to cost-effectively extend the product's lifeline and avoid End of Life decisions. ...\n\nDan Alexandrescu\n\nCore Team Leader\n\nSynopsys, Inc.\n\nEssential IP for the Enablement of Silicon Lifecycle Management\n\nSilicon Lifecycle Management (SLM) is gaining momentum within the industry and makes product development and deployment more deterministic by enabling greater levels of observability into silicon health. Using embedded monitors as well as existing test infrastructure allows real time, meaningful data to gathered at every phase of the device lifecycle, this data is then transported off chip and stored in a unified SLM database ready to be analysed. Based on this analysis, insightful decisions can be made and the correct action taken. This foundation of enriched in-chip observability, analytics, and integrated automation, enables improved silicon health. In-chip environmental monitors provide real time data on dynamic conditions like process variability, voltage supply and thermal activity. Structural monitors enable the measurement of timing margins of real functional paths. Alongside the embedded monitors, high speed access and test IP provides adaptive high bandwidth testing over a functional interface, reducing test time and cost with a lower pin count, enabling testing through entire silicon lifecycle. This presentation will explain the importance of these essential IPs in enabling effective management of the silicon lifecycle from In-Design, In-production, In-Ramp and ultimately In-Field operation, as well as exploring some specific use cases. ...\n\nYoan Dupret\n\nCTO and Managing Director\n\nMenta\n\nProgrammable logic for ASIC/SoC without pain\n\nThe combination of edge computing, highly parallel always evolving algorithms and increasing design costs is leading to a strong requirement of adaptive computing acceleration - which is best served by integrating programmable logic, in the form of embedded FPGA IPs. However, integrating an eFPGA IP is often seen as a complexed, costly, risky and long process - in one word: painful. In this talk, we will explain how Menta is offering the way to integrate programmable logic without pain. ...\n\n3.30 pm\n\nOpen Forum Abdelgader Abdalla\n\nSenior Researcher\n\nInstituto de Telecomunicações\n\nA Deep Learning-based Surrogate Model and Automata Synthesis Convergence For Jitter and Eye Estimation in Nonlinear High-Speed Links\n\nThis work proposed a fast hybrid short transient simulation assumption method based on the Barycentric Lagrange chaos surrogate model and automata synthesis convergence to estimate Jitter parameters, and built an eye diagram over high-speed SerDes channel systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a hybrid methodology that uses finite automata to guide a deep machine learning-based surrogate model has been proposed for eye diagram synthesis and jitter parameters estimation at the receiver. The proposed Barycentric Lagrange chaos has reduced the computational cost from O(n2) to O(n) in contrast to legacy state of the arts transient simulation and polynomial chaos (PC) model-based surrogate model. Moreover, integrated finite automata within the proposed machine learning method have reduced computationally expensive eye diagram synthesis steps inherent in the current state of the arts mentioned above. The proposed technique shows excellent synthesis, accuracy and less simulation runtime compared to the traditional transient analysis simulation and PC method. ...\n\n4 pm\n\nEvent closure !!!
