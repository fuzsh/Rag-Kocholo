        "text": "Program Solicitation NSF 21-551\n\nSubmission Window Date(s) (due by 5 p.m. submitter's local time):\n\nProposals Accepted Anytime\n\nSMALL and MEDIUM Proposals\n\nJune 01, 2023 - June 15, 2023\n\nFRONTIER proposals\n\nImportant Information And Revision Notes\n\nThe Cyber Physical Systems program solicitation has been revised and prospective Principal Investigators (PIs) are encouraged to read the solicitation carefully. Among the changes are the following:\n\nThere is no deadline for SMALL and MEDIUM CPS proposals — they will be accepted at anytime. Although proposal submissions to the Small and Medium project classes are \"Accepted Anytime\", Research.gov requires a \"due date\" and displays one for you to select. You can choose any of the listed deadlines in Research.gov from the Due Date drop down window to submit to the Small or Medium project class.\n\nThere remains an annual deadline for FRONTIER proposals\n\nAny proposal submitted in response to this solicitation should be submitted in accordance with the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) that is in effect for the relevant due date to which the proposal is being submitted. The NSF PAPPG is regularly revised and it is the responsibility of the proposer to ensure that the proposal meets the requirements specified in this solicitation and the applicable version of the PAPPG. Submitting a proposal prior to a specified deadline does not negate this requirement.\n\nSummary Of Program Requirements\n\nGeneral Information\n\nProgram Title:\n\nCyber-Physical Systems (CPS)\n\nSynopsis of Program:\n\nCyber-physical systems (CPS) are engineered systems that are built from, and depend upon, the seamless integration of computation and physical components. Advances in CPS will enable capability, adaptability, scalability, resiliency, safety, security, and usability that will expand the horizons of these critical systems. CPS technologies are transforming the way people interact with engineered systems, just as the Internet has transformed the way people interact with information. New, smart CPS drive innovation and competition in a range of application domains including agriculture, aeronautics, building design, civil infrastructure, energy, environmental quality, healthcare and personalized medicine, manufacturing, and transportation. CPS are becoming data-rich enabling new and higher degrees of automation and autonomy. Traditional ideas in CPS research are being challenged by new concepts emerging from artificial intelligence and machine learning. The integration of artificial intelligence with CPS especially for real-time operation creates new research opportunities with major societal implications.\n\nWhile tremendous progress has been made in advancing CPS technologies, the demand for innovation across application domains is driving the need to accelerate fundamental research to keep pace. At the same time, the CPS program seeks to open new vistas for the research community to think beyond the usual cyber-physical paradigms and structures and propose creative ideas to address the myriad challenges of today's systems as well as those of the future that have not yet been designed or fielded.\n\nThe CPS program aims to develop the core research needed to engineer these complex CPS, some of which may also require dependable, high-confidence, or provable behaviors. Core research areas of the program include control, data analytics, and machine learning including real-time learning for control, autonomy, design, Internet of Things (IoT), mixed initiatives including human-in- or human-on-the-loop, networking, privacy, real-time systems, safety, security, and verification. By abstracting from the particulars of specific systems and application domains, the CPS program seeks to reveal cross-cutting, fundamental scientific and engineering principles that underpin the integration of cyber and physical elements across all application domains. The program additionally supports the development of methods, tools, and hardware and software components based upon these cross-cutting principles, along with validation of the principles via prototypes and testbeds. This program also fosters a research community that is committed to advancing education and outreach in CPS and accelerating the transition of CPS research into the real world.\n\nAll proposals must include the following as part of the Project Description:\n\nA Research Description that describes the technical rationale and technical approach of the CPS research, including the challenges that drive the research problem and how the research integrates cyber and physical components. This section must also describe how the research outcomes are translational to other application domains. Specifically, it must include:\n\nA subsection titled \"CPS Research Focus\" which describes the cyber-physical system attributes of the challenge problem and clearly identifies the core CPS research areas addressed in which the novel and foundational research contributions are being made;\n\nAn Evaluation/Experimentation Plan that describes how proposed concepts will be validated and outlines the metrics for success;\n\nA Project Management and Collaboration Plan that summarizes how the project team is ideally suited to realize the project goals and how the team will ensure effective collaboration; and\n\nA Broader Impacts section that describes how the research will be disseminated to a broad and diverse audience. This should go beyond traditional academic publications and includes education and outreach from the research team spanning multiple levels of engagement. Broader Impacts encompasses Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) and Engineering (BPE).\n\nNSF is working closely with multiple agencies across the federal government, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T); the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA); several National Institutes of Health (NIH) institutes and centers including the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR), and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS); and the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA NIFA, hereafter referred to as NIFA).\n\nProposals for three classes of research and education projects — differing in scope and goals — are supported through the CPS program:\n\nSmall projects may request a total budget of up to $500,000 for a period of up to 3 years. They are well suited to emerging new and innovative ideas that may have high impact on the field of CPS. There is no deadline for Small projects.\n\nMedium projects may request a total budget ranging from $500,001 to $1,200,000 for a period of up to 3 years. They are well suited to multi-disciplinary projects that accomplish clear goals requiring integrated perspectives spanning the disciplines. There is no deadline for Medium Projects.\n\nFrontier projects must address clearly identified critical CPS challenges that cannot be achieved by a set of smaller projects. Furthermore, Frontier projects should also look to push the boundaries of CPS well beyond today's systems and capabilities. Funding may be requested for a total of $1,200,001 to $7,000,000 for a period of 4 to 5 years. Note that the Frontier projects have a specific deadline.\n\nCognizant Program Officer(s):\n\nPlease note that the following information is current at the time of publishing.

The complete text of the PAPPG is available electronically on the NSF website at: https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg.\n\nFull Proposals submitted via Grants.gov: NSF Grants.gov Application Guide: A Guide for the Preparation and Submission of NSF Applications via Grants.gov guidelines apply (Note: The NSF Grants.gov Application Guide is available on the Grants.gov website and on the NSF website at: https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=grantsgovguide).\n\nB. Budgetary Information\n\nCost Sharing Requirements:\n\nInclusion of voluntary committed cost sharing is prohibited.\n\nIndirect Cost (F&A) Limitations:\n\nFor awards made by NSF, Proposal & Award Policy & Procedures (PAPPG) guidelines apply. Proposals selected for funding by DHS and/or DOT will be awarded by NSF using funds transferred from DHS and/or DOT, respectively, and so they will follow NSF's PAPPG.\n\nFor awards made by NIH, indirect costs on foreign subawards/subcontracts will be limited to eight percent.\n\nFor awards made by NIFA: Indirect Cost (IDC) is not to exceed 30 percent of Total Federal Funds Awarded (TFFA) of the recipient.\n\n7 U.S.C. § 3310 limits IDC for the overall award to 30 percent of Total Federal Funds Awarded (TFFA) under a research, education, or extension grant. The maximum IDC rate allowed under the award is determined by calculating the amount of IDC using:\n\nthe sum of an institution's negotiated indirect cost rate and the indirect cost rate charged by sub-awardees, if any; or\n\n30 percent of TFFA.\n\nThe maximum allowable IDC rate under the award, including the IDC charged by the sub-awardee(s), if any, is the lesser of the two rates.\n\nIf the result of number 1) above is the lesser of the two rates, the grant recipient is allowed to charge the negotiated IDC rate on the prime award and the sub-award(s), if any. Any sub-awards would be subject to the sub-awardee's negotiated IDC rate. The sub-awardee may charge its negotiated IDC rate on its portion of the award, provided the sum of the IDC rate charged under the award by the prime awardee and the sub-awardee(s) does not exceed 30 percent of the TFFA.\n\nIf the result of number 2) above is the lesser of the two rates, then the maximum IDC rate allowed for the overall award, including any sub-award(s), is limited to 30 percent of the TFFA. That is, the IDC of the prime awardee plus the sum of the IDC charged by the sub-awardee(s), if any, may not exceed 30 percent of the TFFA.\n\nIn the event of an award, the prime awardee is responsible for ensuring the maximum indirect cost allowed for the award is not exceeded when combining IDC for the Federal portion (i.e., prime and sub-awardee(s)) and any applicable cost-sharing (see 7 CFR 3430.52(b)). Amounts exceeding the maximum allowable IDC is considered unallowable. See sections 408 and 410 of 2 CFR 200.\n\nOther Budgetary Limitations:\n\nOther budgetary limitations apply.

Introduction\n\nCyber-physical Systems (CPS) are engineered systems that are built from, and depend upon, the seamless integration of computation and physical components. CPS tightly integrate computing devices, actuation and control, networking infrastructure, and sensing of the physical world. The system may include human interaction with or without human aided control. CPS may also include multiple integrated system components operating at wide varieties of spatial and temporal time scales. They can be characterized by architectures that may include distributed or centralized computing, multi-level hierarchical control and coordination of physical and organizational processes.\n\nAdvances in CPS should enable capability, adaptability, scalability, resilience, safety, security, and usability far beyond what is available in the simple embedded systems of today. CPS technology will transform the way people interact with engineered systems just as the Internet has transformed the way people interact with information. CPS are driving innovation and competition in a range of sectors, including agriculture, aeronautics, building design, civil infrastructure, energy, environmental quality, healthcare and personalized medicine, and transportation.\n\nCPS may be very large systems such as airplanes and automobiles. They may be an integration of diverse systems at city-scale or larger such as a transportation management system, a system for controlling urban air transportation, or the smart grid. Alternatively, they may be smaller-scale systems comprising ensembles of components such as sensors and actuators, lab-on-chip, medical devices, or micro-scale robots. The advent of IoT allows CPS components to communicate with other devices through cloud-based infrastructure, and to interact with (potentially) safety-critical systems, posing new research challenges in safety, security, and dependability.\n\nWhile tremendous progress has been made in advancing CPS technologies, the demand for innovation across application domains continues to grow and is driving the need to accelerate fundamental research to keep pace. CPS are becoming data-rich enabling new and higher degrees of automation and autonomy. Traditional ideas in CPS research are being challenged by new concepts emerging from artificial intelligence and machine learning. New methods to combine data-driven machine leaning and model-based learning for decision and real-time control of cyber-physical systems are encouraged. Similarly, what do high confidence and verification mean in the context of autonomous systems that learn from their experiences? How does one reconcile the concepts of machine learning and data-driven modeling with approaches used in model-based design and formal methods? The CPS program seeks to inspire the research community to explore these and other new vistas. Researchers are encouraged to go beyond the current CPS systems and structures, to propose creative ideas that address these challenges.\n\nOther Funding Opportunities: PIs are encouraged to consider other relevant funding opportunities. In particular, for FY 2021, proposals for cyber manufacturing should be submitted to the recently established NSF cross-directorate Future Manufacturing (FM) program solicitation since the cyber manufacturing theme of the FM solicitation strongly aligns with the CPS research community. FM program directors can be consulted for further clarification.\n\nIn addition, proposers should also consider the programs listed at https://www.nsf.gov/eng/robotics.jsp for proposals that will enable transformative new functionality or substantially enhance existing functionality to a robot or a class of robots but do not contribute to a broader set of CPS systems beyond robotics. These proposals are not in scope for the CPS program.\n\nII. Program Description\n\nThe CPS program aims to develop the core research needed to engineer these complex CPS, some of which may also require dependable, high-confidence, or provable behaviors.\n\nCore research areas of the program include control, data analytics, and machine learning including real-time learning for control, autonomy, design, IoT, mixed initiatives including human-in- or human-on-the-loop, networking, privacy, real-time systems, safety, security, and verification. By abstracting from the particulars of specific embodiments and applications, the CPS program seeks to reveal cross-cutting fundamental scientific and engineering principles that underpin the integration of cyber and physical elements across all domains. The program additionally supports the development of methods, tools, and hardware and software components based upon these cross-cutting principles, along with validation of the principles via prototypes and testbeds. This program also fosters a research community that is committed to advancing education and outreach in CPS and to transitioning CPS research into the real world.\n\nTo achieve these aims, the program supports:\n\nCross-disciplinary, collaborative research that will lead to new fundamental insights;\n\nProjects that take a coordinated approach, balancing theory with experimentation;\n\nNew perspectives on existing systems yielding breakthroughs as well as revolutionary new system concepts opening up new CPS research horizons;\n\nProjects that address important basic research needs for synergistic collaboration with mission agencies as described in Section II.D below; and\n\nPromising innovations that have the potential for accelerated maturation, demonstration, and transition to practice.\n\nThe program also supports effective use of testbeds that spur innovations and accelerate research by providing scalable and open environments for experimentation. Researchers should consider using existing testbeds that include virtual simulation environments for early experimentation, higher fidelity hardware-in-the-loop environments, and live platforms. The program strongly encourages proposers to describe how their research may take advantage of such testbeds as a means for experimental validation and maturation in realistic environments. In addition, proposals may explore creation of testbeds for external use. In that case, the testbed concepts must also show their value through integration with research explorations, and the proposal must address how the proposers plan to establish a constituency of users that reaches beyond the developing organization(s). A separate review criterion has been added for proposals whose primary research outcome is creation/construction of a testbed. Simply stating that a testbed will be useful for other researchers does not satisfy this criterion.\n\nNSF is working closely with multiple agencies across the federal government, including DHS S&T; DOT FHWA; NIH NIBIB, NCI, OBSSR, and NCATS; and NIFA. Key goals are to identify basic CPS research directions that are common across multiple application domains, including those with high potential for later transition to practice. The proposer may also wish to consider well-justified international collaborations that add significant value and leverage to the proposed research and/or education activities.\n\nAll proposals must include the following in the Project Descriptions:\n\nA Research Description that describes the technical rationale and technical approach of the CPS research, including the challenges that drive the research problem and how the research integrates cyber and physical components. This section must also describe how the research outcomes are translational to other application domains. Specifically, it must include:\n\nA subsection titled \"CPS Research Focus\" which describes the cyber-physical system attributes of the challenge problem and clearly identifies the core CPS research areas addressed in which the novel and foundational research contributions are being made;\n\nAn Evaluation/Experimentation Plan that describes how proposed concepts will be validated and the metrics for success;\n\nA Project Management and Collaboration Plan that summarizes how the project team is ideally suited to realize the project goals and how the team will assure effective collaboration; and\n\nA Broader Impacts section that describes the societal impact of the proposed research and how the research will be disseminated to a broad and diverse audience. This should go beyond traditional academic publications and include education and outreach from the research team spanning multiple levels of engagement.\n\nII.A Research Areas and Challenges\n\nThis solicitation seeks to address foundational issues that are central across core CPS dimensions including science, engineering, and technology as well as application domains. Research topics that span the lifecycle of CPS are encouraged, including design, synthesis, integration, and real-time operation and performance, including integration with humans. CPS projects are frequently motivated by challenge problems in application domains, including but not limited to: aeronautics, agriculture, automotive, manufacturing and transportation systems, energy, and health and wellness, including medical devices. Researchers must focus on one or more core CPS research area(s), including: control, data analytics, and machine learning including real-time learning for control, autonomy, design, IoT, mixed initiatives including human-in- or on-the loop, networking, privacy, real-time systems, safety security, and verification. Proposals focused on cyber manufacturing should be submitted to the cyber manufacturing theme of the NSF Future Manufacturing program solicitation which strongly aligns with the CPS research community.\n\nIt is essential that proposals not simply describe the development of a CPS, but also emphasize the areas of CPS-focused research contributing to this development in which novel and foundational research contributions are being made. Systems of interest will be at the same time transformative and translational, demonstrating inventive new ideas and multi-disciplinary technical approaches to address societal challenges. Challenge applications can range from highly focused inventions enabled by CPS technology to revolutionary approaches for next-generation infrastructures. The program strongly encourages projects that address concerns shared by other federal agencies such as agriculture, transportation, health, energy, and national security.\n\nII.B Classes of Projects\n\nProposals for the following three classes of research and education projects, that differ in scope and goals, will be accepted pursuant to this solicitation. The proposer is expected to describe in the Project Description how the project fits within the selected category in terms of its scope and goals.\n\nSmall Projects: Small projects may be requested with total budgets of up to $500,000 for periods of up to three years. They are well suited to exploration of emerging and innovative ideas with substantial potential for impact. Proposals for Small projects are required to clearly describe why/how the research, if successful, would influence the field of CPS.\n\nMedium Projects: Medium projects may be requested with total budgets ranging from $500,001 to $1,200,000 for periods of up to three years. They are well suited to multi-disciplinary efforts that accomplish clear goals requiring an integrated perspective spanning the disciplines. Proposals for medium projects are required to clearly describe why the research to be undertaken requires this multi-disciplinary approach. The research plan must include validation of theory through empirical demonstration in a prototype or testbed.\n\nFrontier Projects: Frontier projects may be requested with total budgets ranging from $1,200,001 to $7,000,000 for periods of four to five years. The proposal must clearly identify and address critical CPS science, engineering, and/or technological challenges that cannot be achieved by a set of smaller projects. Furthermore, Frontier projects should also look to push the boundaries of CPS well beyond today's systems and capabilities. The goal, scale, and degree of integration of the proposed research must clearly require this major investment. The research plan must include validation of theory through empirical demonstration in a prototype or testbed. There must be a plan for sharing results, including testbeds and artifacts, with the CPS research community, including through the CPS Virtual Organization (CPS-VO). Frontier projects are expected to go beyond simply sharing PI meeting artifacts (such as slides) via the CPS-VO, and to have concrete plans for sharing results, testbeds, and/or artifacts. In addition, Frontier proposals must describe education approaches that prepare students for careers in CPS practice and research, and how these education goals extend beyond the participating organization(s). Frontier projects must include actionable components that seek to increase participation of underrepresented groups in computing. These efforts to broaden participation can be undertaken by an individual PI or in collaboration with others, working within proposing organization(s), professional organizations, and/or community groups. Additional information on broadening participation efforts can be found below.\n\nMission agency partners for CPS do not typically consider funding Frontier projects. Proposals at the Frontier scale must have a clear NSF target with significant research focus in the CPS core areas and in particular those most directly relevant to CISE.\n\nII.C Broadening Participation in Computing and Engineering\n\nNSF has long been committed to Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) and Engineering (BPE). The underrepresentation of many groups — including women, African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, Native Pacific Islanders, and persons with disabilities — in computing and engineering deprives large segments of the population of the opportunity to be creators of technology and not only consumers. Ending underrepresentation will require a range of measures, including organizational programs and activities as well as culture change across colleges, departments, classes, and research groups.\n\nThe CPS program is committed to enhancing the community's awareness of and overcoming barriers to BPC and BPE, and to providing information and resources to PIs so that they can develop interest, skills, and activities in support of BPC/BPE at all levels of the CPS community (K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate). Specifically:\n\nFor Frontier CPS proposals, a meaningful BPC plan is required as a one- to three-page Supplementary Document and will be evaluated during merit review.\n\nEach Medium project must, by the time of award, have in place an approved BPC/BPE plan. The managing program director will work with each PI team following merit review and prior to making an award to ensure that plans are meaningful and include concrete metrics for success. The CPS program will also provide opportunities for PIs to share BPC/BPE experiences and innovations through program PI meetings. CISE PIs of Medium proposals are therefore strongly encouraged to consider this eventual requirement as they develop their proposals, and to include one- to three-page descriptions of their planned BPC activities under Supplementary Documents in their submissions. Feedback will be provided on such plans. Similarly, ENG PIs are strongly encouraged to include one- to three-page descriptions of their planned BPE activities under Supplementary Documents in their submissions.\n\nPIs of Small proposals are strongly encouraged to include plans, or begin preparing to include plans, for broadening participation activities in their proposals.\n\nMore information, including examples of BPC/BPE activities and metrics, can be found at: https://www.nsf.gov/cise/bpc/ and at https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504870.\n\nII.D Sponsoring Agency Mission-Specific Research\n\nNSF welcomes proposals addressing any of the fundamental CPS research target areas described in Section II.A above. In addition, through this solicitation, multiple federal agencies are interested in addressing CPS basic research needs of relevance to their missions, along with opportunities for accelerated transition to practice. The specific interests of each participating agency are described below. Please note that the mission agencies (DHS, DOT, NIH, and NIFA) look to this basic research program for new and creative project ideas that would not be typically submitted to their own agency solicitations.\n\nAll proposals, whether targeted for a mission agency or NSF will be reviewed by NSF panels adhering to standard review criteria for intellectual merit and broader impacts.\n\nAll sponsor-targeted proposals:\n\nProposals that are targeting a specific agency sponsorship should indicate so just above the keywords in the Project Summary, e.g., \"Requested funding agency:\" followed by that agency's abbreviated name, i.e., \"NSF,\" \"DHS,\" \"DOT,\" \"NIH,\" or \"NIFA,\" but only if the proposers have previously communicated with a Program Officer from that agency and received permission or instruction to do so. Those not so designated will be considered for funding by all the joint sponsoring agencies. Also, please note that unless otherwise specified, agencies listed below do not accept Frontier proposals.\n\nII.D.1 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate Technology Centers Division (TCD)\n\nWithin DHS S&T, TCD encourages research and development in cybersecurity to enhance the resilience of critical information infrastructure. TCD seeks to develop and transition new technologies, tools, and techniques to secure systems, networks, and infrastructure. Its research interests include foundational research in cybersecurity technologies with applicability in the 3-5 year time horizon.\n\nTCD has particular interests in security technologies relevant to CPS and IoT. The federal Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) CPS Senior Steering Group's CPS Vision Statement notes CPS research gaps and identifies drivers and technologies for CPS1. CPS related to industrial control systems are considered especially relevant for TCD. Relevant technologies include cybersecurity approaches for guarding against malicious attacks on CPS as well as diagnostics and prognostics that aim to identify, predict, and prevent or recover from faults. TCD is interested in CPS technologies that address privacy concerns and manage the use of sensitive information while protecting individual privacy. Validation, verification, and certification that speed up design cycles while ensuring high confidence in system safety and functionality also align well with TCD interests\n\nMore information about DHS S&T TCD can be found on the following website: https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/Technology-Centers.\n\n1 https://www.nitrd.gov/nitrdgroups/images/6/6a/Cyber_Physical_Systems_%28CPS%29_Vision_Statement.pdf\n\nII.D.2 U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration\n\nFHWA has interest in research and development that provides improved safety and mobility in the development and operation of the highway system. At the same time, CPS for highway transportation must be scalable, reliable, adaptable, and secure while also being cost-effective.\n\nIn particular, FHWA is interested in fundamental research that also is aimed towards solving important public needs and can scale across transportation systems and modes, and into other domains. The approaches should consider the open nature of the transportation system, legacy components and processes, and the distributed nature of asset ownership and operations.\n\nThe following are examples of how CPS research could respond to public needs across transportation and other domains:\n\nTraffic management and control systems that improve safety and reliability and enhance social and economic connections within or outside of metropolitan areas;\n\nLeveraging the differences between machines and people in sensing, analytics, and control to improve system safety, efficiency, and sustainability;\n\nIncreasing safety and convenience for vulnerable travelers through connected and automated systems; and\n\nTechnologies that extend the infrastructure lifecycle and reduce costs through automated maintenance with little or no disruption of service.\n\nThese are only illustrative examples of how CPS could result in public benefits for transportation. Investigators are encouraged to consider and propose truly novel solutions to a broad range of public needs that could overlap the examples above or be entirely different.\n\nFHWA and other agencies within the U.S. DOT are focused on measuring impacts across programs including the impacts of innovative technologies on how government agencies operate. Accordingly, FHWA encourages CPS research that can quantify how these new technologies meet public needs and can measure the impact of new technology systems on public health, safety, mobility, economic performance, equity, or on the environment.\n\nFHWA encourages leveraging existing tools and infrastructure for connected, automated and cooperative systems and real-world data.\n\nWith a multimodal approach, the CARMASM Program was initiated by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to encourage collaboration on automated driving technology to improve transportation safety, efficiency and mobility. CARMA focuses on advancing Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA), defined in SAE J2316 https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3216_202005/, which enables machine-to-machine (M2M) sharing of information between two or more participating entities in the transportation system including automated vehicles, infrastructure devices and road users such as pedestrians and cyclists. CARMA provides a suite of open-source software (OSS) tools (i.e. CARMA Platform, CARMA Cloud, CARMA Messenger, CARMA Streets, CARMA 1Tenth, V2XHub, etc.) to represent a cooperative transportation system for researchers to use and develop concepts together within a growing community. CARMA open source code is located at https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol and continually developed by the growing community of users through CARMA Collaborative. More information is located at https://highways.dot.gov/research/operations/Cooperative-Driving-Automation and https://www.its.dot.gov/research_areas/automation.htm.\n\nProposed solutions need to account for a combination of legacy equipment and new systems. Initial deployment of new technologies may begin in specific corridors, but the technologies need to be scalable, reliable, affordable, and adaptable to enable nationwide deployment as well as operation over periods of 30 or more years. While people may update mobile devices every two years, the average age of private motor vehicles is now over 10 years. Roadway signals, infrastructure sensors, truck trailers, and other elements of the highway system have even longer life-cycles before being replaced. This also implies interactions among a mix of human-driven and machine-driven (at various levels of automation) vehicles for many years into the future. Accordingly, new systems need to work with existing equipment while anticipating future technologies.\n\nII.D.3 National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n\nThe NIH expects to fund Medium projects. Medium projects must demonstrate innovation at the intersection of multiple disciplines, to accomplish a clear goal that requires an integrated perspective spanning the disciplines. Funding for Medium projects may be requested of between approximately $100,001 and $250,000 per year in direct costs for a period of three to four years. Funding may include applicable indirect costs, with total budgets ranging from $500,001 to $1,200,000.\n\nApplications being proposed should be relevant to the missions of the participating NIH institutes and centers:\n\nNIBIB: The mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering is to improve health by leading the development and accelerating the application of biomedical technologies. NIBIB is committed to integrating the physical and engineering sciences with the life sciences to advance basic research and medical care.\n\nNCI: The National Cancer Institute mission is to conduct and support research that will lead to a future in which we can prevent cancer before it starts, identify cancers that do develop at the earliest stage, eliminate cancers through innovative treatment interventions, and biologically control those cancers that we cannot eliminate so they become manageable, chronic diseases.\n\nNCATS: The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences strives to develop innovations to reduce, remove, or bypass costly and time-consuming bottlenecks in the translational research pipeline in an effort to speed the delivery of new drugs, diagnostics, and medical devices to patients. NCATS is particularly interested in a comprehensive matrix of human diseases and conditions with known targets and pathways, and all available drugs tested in humans, that can be used for discovery and development of targeted therapeutics — for facilitating the research and development of systems pharmacology aimed at the discovery of multi-target drugs and drug combinations.\n\nOBSSR: The Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) was created by Congress in 1993 and is responsible for coordinating the health-relevant behavioral and social sciences and identifying challenges and opportunities to advance these sciences at the NIH.\n\nThe NIH encourages CPS research and technology development to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. Specifically, the participating NIH institutes on this solicitation are interested in targeting this solicitation to support the development of CPS research and technology to facilitate medical treatment during a national crisis (e.g. SARS-CoV-2); achieve functional independence in humans; improve quality of life; assist with behavioral therapy and personalized care; monitor or generate accurate readouts of therapeutic effects of therapies; prevent disease and disability; and promote wellness/health.\n\nAdvances in sensors, wearable devices, and patient-facing technologies hold great promise in improving healthcare across the continuum from prevention to survivorship. Little is known, however, about how advances in CPS can integrate these technologies and interfaces to increase patient engagement and activation. In the healthcare setting, CPS systems such as wireless body area networks (WBANs), assistive healthcare systems, and wearable sensors and implantable devices are actively being developed to improve outcomes and quality of life, provide cost-effective healthcare, and potentially speed-up disease diagnosis and prevention. In nonclinical settings, consumer-oriented CPS research can create supportive home environments to accommodate residents' functional deficits while offering insights to patients and caregivers on how best to manage their own care outside of the healthcare setting.\n\nOne vision of medical CPS could be the development of personalized patient-care systems which are tightly knit with other non-medical CPS systems. Such a closed-loop environment could enable optimal and timely delivery of healthcare improvements at a significant cost reduction. It is envisioned that such systems will also generate a significant amount of data; technologies for analyzing these data on-the-fly will need to be developed.\n\nExamples of medical CPS research and technology development include, but are not limited to:\n\nDeveloping CPS technology that allows first responders and medical practitioners to provide medical care during an outbreak, while protecting them from threats\n\nDeveloping CPS technologies to amplify and extend the capabilities of standard-of-care medical devices without significant degradation of their baseline safety and efficacy;\n\nDeveloping CPS technologies to manage the workload of medical practitioners and provide decision support during an outbreak or other crisis situation;\n\nImplementing CPS technology to reduce medical errors in intensive care units (ICUs);\n\nDeveloping prototypical closed-loop CPS for medical systems such as artificial organs or continuous monitoring systems;\n\nImplementing CPS technology for real-time monitoring and analysis of complex biomedical research systems such as micro-physiological systems or cancer research models for understanding cancer biology;\n\nPursuing approaches to enhance interoperability between various medical devices and/or systems;\n\nDeveloping human-system integration (HSI) applications designed to optimize the role of human cognition in relation to CPS support within the context of either clinical or consumer health environments;\n\nDeveloping applications to monitor physiologic, motor, and cognitive functioning across environments to inform treatment and facilitate research;\n\nDeveloping approaches to understand the behavioral and social aspects of medical CPS implementations;\n\nDeveloping real-time patient-specific clinical decision-making approaches;\n\nDeveloping real-time data analytic techniques for medical CPS systems, such as machine learning approaches to develop on-the-fly analyses and prediction models;\n\nDeveloping CPS applications to improve access, utility, and management of biomedical big data for basic research; and\n\nDeveloping hospital-wide applications to decrease fragmentation, improve quality of care, and conserve costs by tracking medical assets and conjoining informatics data flows to enable a \"learning healthcare system.\"\n\nApplicants should describe how the ideas being proposed will address the healthcare needs of the end user (healthy individuals, patient populations with specific targeted diseases, persons with disability, and/or health disparity populations).\n\nII.D.4 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)\n\nThe USDA has launched the Agricultural Innovation Agenda for using automation, artificial intelligence and data to transform American agriculture (https://www.usda.gov/aia). USDA/NIFA is pursuing an aggressive research agenda to meet the \"grand challenges\" for agriculture and society and has embarked on a multi-horizon research agenda to address these challenges. Foundational and applied research in CPS are important elements of this agenda that address the following goals of the USDA science blueprint (https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/usda-science-blueprint.pdf): sustainable agricultural intensification, climate adaptation in agriculture, value added innovation in agricultural systems, and translation of food and nutritional information technological advances in food industry.\n\nThese efforts address the USDA strategic goals (https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/usda-strategic-plan-2018-2022.pdf). USDA emphasizes automation and associated development of decision tools for plant and animal production and protection; particularly as it applies to fruit and vegetable production and of precision livestock farming and processing.\n\nFor this solicitation, NIFA anticipates funding amount of $5,000,000 in FY 2021. NIFA encourages projects that advance science and technology applied to Smart & Connected Communities (both rural and urban) and to real-time agricultural data analytics and control. While other applications of CPS in agriculture might be considered, strong preference will be given to these two topics. Today's traditional CPS notions of control, sensing, and real-time behavior may require new perspectives on modeling, performance prediction, and control to account for the spatial, temporal, and environmental considerations fundamental to agriculture. NIFA is interested in foundational technologies that can be developed and demonstrated in the context of agricultural challenges, and then rapidly converged into capabilities that will transition into practice.\n\nSmart & Connected Communities (S&CC):\n\nThe \"sharing economy\" has explored and built new business models, new marketing opportunities, and new options for consumers. Much of that sharing has been facilitated by location-aware, take-anywhere technology, such as the smart phone. Now, by overlaying that expanded level of human connectivity with networks of connected devices and infrastructure, not just mobile phones, we create new possibilities to enhance the livability and sustainability of communities in both urban and rural settings. While the same basic needs for environmental, social, and economic sustainability exist for both urban and rural communities, solutions to meet those needs can vary quite dramatically.\n\nThe following two NIFA goals have been identified for S&CC in urban and rural settings, respectively:\n\nIncreased food and nutritional security through the development of high-output and efficient controlled-environment urban agriculture technologies and systems; and\n\nMore resilient, robust, and reliable agricultural systems leading to more viable and thriving rural communities.\n\nReduced population densities, fewer socio-economic resources, and a greater percentage of non-point source pollution means that metrics for rural sustainability will look much different than their urban counterparts. And yet, food security, clean air and water, mobility, quality jobs, disaster preparedness and mitigation, and good healthcare are desirable and important aspects of livability regardless of where one resides.\n\nCPS technology challenges that are directly relevant to NIFA goals for S&CC include:\n\nRobust and intelligent control systems and sensors to help monitor, optimize, and manage an entire controlled-environment urban agriculture facility including physical environment (lighting, temperature, water, and fertilizers);\n\nModel-based development and control integrating horticultural knowledge of pests, cultivars tailored to controlled environments, and companion production;\n\nIntegration of renewable energy sources such as solar technology and improved high-efficiency lighting based upon physics and photonics advances; and\n\nNew connectivity paradigms and applications for integrated devices, communications, control systems, and databases in dispersed rural settings that enable overlain software to bring quality-of-life improvements to citizens for benefits such as education, health, economic development, mobility, or environmental quality.\n\nReal-Time Agricultural Data Analytics and Control:\n\nAddressing many of the agricultural grand challenges demands new advances in the integration of CPS (including sensors, communication systems, and control systems) with real-time information and analytic engines tightly coupled with agriculture and food systems. This integration forms a large-scale CPS that enables data collected throughout the supply chain to be analyzed and used for control and decision-making in other stages of production, processing, distribution, storage, and consumption. Much agricultural data is currently single-use and static. For example, current technology allows for the collection and use of many different types of agricultural data, from soil moisture and chemistry, meteorology and climate, crop and market conditions, and consumer nutrition and preference, to gene sequences and ecological variables. However, these data are often used only at the time and place of collection, and necessarily require a human-in-the-loop. Datasets in many of these fields need to become dynamic (regularly updated, or real-time in some cases) and actively engage in control operations and decision-making in other segments of the supply chain. These datasets are massive and vary in scale and precision, which presents challenges for accessibility, analytics, interoperability, and persistence. Nonetheless, they have potential to significantly impact environmental quality, product traceability, agricultural input use, regional pest management, and system-wide sustainability.\n\nNIFA is interested in new approaches for analytics that can extract actionable information from these datasets and provide real-time control of agricultural CPS. While application of these massive datasets and real-time analytics in controlling CPS may be difficult in many domains, the multiple time scales of agriculture offer an opportunity to reorient our thinking of real-time, and may be highly compatible with the processing and data delivery timelines for these massive datasets. Proposals should briefly present metrics and methodology for evaluating the metrics to show the impact of the research.\n\nGiven the integrative and multi- or trans-disciplinary nature of agricultural sciences, NIFA expects to fund Medium projects. In addition, Frontier projects that demonstrate an agriculture-related critical challenge would also be considered by NIFA, but funding will be limited to the lower end of the Frontier range.\n\nII.E Transition to Practice\n\nProposals for Small, Medium or Frontier projects may include a Transition to Practice (TTP) option. Proposed activities under the TTP option MUST NOT be described in the Project Description section, and instead MUST be described in a Supplementary Document of no more than five pages. The TTP option is meant to leverage proposed research activities and ideas to move results beyond the laboratory. Proposals including this option should clearly describe how the results will be further developed, matured and experimentally deployed in organizations or industries, including in networks and end systems. Any software developed in this program area is required to be released under an open source license listed by the Open Source Initiative (http://www.opensource.org/) (this requirement is specific to the TTP option supplement). The TTP funding request may not exceed more than one-third of the base award amount or $400,000, whichever is less. Note that the budget for the TTP option must be specified separately within the five-page Supplementary Document. The proposal budget should reflect the base project without TTP option. If the TTP option is to be awarded, the proposer will be requested to update the Project Budget and Justification to include TTP costs.\n\nNote: The TTP option is an optional component, above and beyond the requirement for experimentation on an actual CPS for Small, Medium or Frontier projects. It is also recognized that TTP option activities may need to overlap with the base project timeline to support the accelerated maturation and TTP goals. This may include early testing of theory, additional robustness in design, and higher fidelity simulation. Proposers should carefully describe in their TTP option description and budget justification the scope of this additional activity, especially if it is anticipated in the early project years.\n\nProposals submitted with a TTP option will be evaluated with careful attention to the following:\n\nThe expected impact on the deployed environment described in the Supplementary Document;\n\nThe extent to which the value of the proposed CPS research and development is described in the context of a needed capability and potential impact;\n\nThe feasibility, and utility of the capability in its proposed operational role, including potential partnering with industry that will incorporate the TTP technology;\n\nA plan that addresses in its goals and milestones the demonstration and evaluation of a working system in the target environment;\n\nTangible metrics described to evaluate the success of the capabilities developed, and the steps necessary to take the system from prototype status to production use; and,\n\nThe appropriateness of the budget for the option. The Supplementary Document should explain how the additional budget will be used to execute the option.\n\nIf you submit a Transition to Practice (TTP) option, the title should begin with \"TTP Option\" followed by a colon, then the project class followed by a colon, and then the descriptive title. For example, a CPS Frontier project with the TTP option should have a title of the form CPS: TTP Option: Frontier: [descriptive] Title.\n\nII.F Cloud Computing Resources\n\nProposals may request cloud computing resources to use public clouds such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), IBM Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Cloud computing resources described in proposals may be obtained through an external cloud access entity (CloudBank) supported by NSF's Enabling Access to Cloud Computing Resources for CISE Research and Education (Cloud Access) program.\n\nProposers should describe this request in a Supplementary Document including: (a) which public cloud providers will be used; (b) anticipated annual and total costs for accessing the desired cloud computing resources, based on pricing currently available from the public cloud computing providers; and (c) a technical description of, and justification for, the requested cloud computing resources. The proposal budget should not include the costs for accessing public cloud computing resources via CloudBank. Also, the total cost of the project, including the cloud computing resource request, may not exceed the budget limit described in this solicitation.\n\nFor example, a proposal submitted to the Small size class, has a total proposal budget limit of $500,000. If a PI wishes to request $20,000 in cloud computing resources through CloudBank, then the proposal budget should not exceed $480,000. The remaining $20,000 for cloud computing resources should be specified in the Supplementary Document. If a proposal is a collaborative project with two PIs from two different organizations, then each PI may request cloud computing resources separately through independent Supplementary Documents as long as the total budget (on the budget pages plus the amount requested for cloud computing resources in the Supplementary Documents) does not exceed $500,000 for a Small project, or $1.20 million for a Medium project.\n\nIf incorporating this request into the proposal, a proposer should include \"CloudAccess\" (one word without space) as a keyword on the Project Summary page, at the end of the Overview section (before the section on Intellectual Merit). Proposers may contact CloudBank (see https://www.cloudbank.org/faq) for consultation on estimating the costs for using cloud computing resources.\n\nSee Section V.A. Proposal Preparation Instructions, Supplementary Documents, for more information on how to describe the cloud computing resource request as well as the associated budget.\n\nII.G CPS PI Meetings\n\nThe CPS program hosts required, two-day PI meetings every year. For all awards, one or more designated CPS project representative(s) (PI/co-PI/senior personnel or NSF-approved replacement) must attend the entire program on both days of every annual CPS PI meeting held throughout the duration of a given CPS grant, including during no-cost extensions. Exceptions due to academic-year teaching constraints will be considered in extreme circumstances. For collaborative projects, PIs (or a NSF-approved replacement) from each collaborating organization of a given project are expected to participate. Graduate students are also encouraged to attend if space is available. The meeting also includes representatives from the research community, government, and industry.\n\nFor the PI meeting, PIs or other project representatives must also provide a poster for the poster session and a short video describing their project(s) that will be made available on the CPS Virtual Organization (CPS-VO).\n\nThe CPS program sponsors the CPS-VO, a broad community of interest for CPS researchers, developers, and educators. Projects are encouraged to use the CPS-VO to coordinate activities and disseminate artifacts along with research results.\n\nIII. Award Information\n\nAnticipated Type of Award: Continuing Grant or Cooperative Agreement or Standard Grant\n\nEstimated Number of Awards: 20 to 30\n\nSubject to receipt of sufficient meritorious proposals and pending availability of funds.\n\nAnticipated Funding Amount: $32,400,000 in FY 2021, subject to receipt of sufficient meritorious proposals and pending availability of funds.\n\nAll awards made under this solicitation by NSF or NIH will be as grants or cooperative agreements as determined by the supporting agency. Note that NCATS will only make cooperative agreements. Projects supported by DHS, and/or DOT will be awarded by NSF using funds transferred from DHS, and/or DOT, respectively.\n\nAll awards made under this solicitation by NIFA will be as standard grants. A standard grant is an award instrument by which the agency agrees to support a specified level of effort for a predetermined project period without the announced intention of providing additional support at a future date. NIFA anticipates funding amount of $5,000,000 in FY2021.\n\nUpon conclusion of the review process, meritorious research proposals may be recommended for funding by one of the participating federal agencies, determined at the option of the agencies, not the proposer. Subsequent grant administration procedures will be in accordance with the individual policies of the awarding agency and may require submission of a revised proposal that meets the administrative requirements of the funding agency. (See section VI.B for additional information on agency-specific processes.)\n\nIV. Eligibility Information\n\nWho May Submit Proposals:\n\nProposals may only be submitted by the following:\n\nInstitutions of Higher Education (IHEs) - Two- and four-year IHEs (including community colleges) accredited in, and having a campus located in the US, acting on behalf of their faculty members. Special Instructions for International Branch Campuses of US IHEs: If the proposal includes funding to be provided to an international branch campus of a US institution of higher education (including through use of subawards and consultant arrangements), the proposer must explain the benefit(s) to the project of performance at the international branch campus, and justify why the project activities cannot be performed at the US campus.\n\nNon-profit, non-academic organizations: Independent museums, observatories, research labs, professional societies and similar organizations in the U.S. associated with educational or research activities.\n\nWho May Serve as PI:\n\nThere are no restrictions or limits.\n\nLimit on Number of Proposals per Organization:\n\nThere are no restrictions or limits.\n\nLimit on Number of Proposals per PI or co-PI: 2\n\nFor the CPS program, during any contiguous 12-month period, an individual may not participate as PI, co-PI, or Senior Personnel in more than two proposals across all size classes. This limit will be applied beginning with this solicitation and continue to apply to future versions of this solicitation, unless noted otherwise.\n\nThese eligibility constraints will be strictly enforced in order to treat everyone fairly and consistently. Any proposal that exceeds this limit at the time of submission for any PI, co-PI, or Senior Personnel will be returned without review. No exceptions will be made. Proposals that are withdrawn prior to commencement of merit review, or those that are returned without review by NSF, will not count against this proposal limit. Proposers are strongly encouraged to verify the dates of prior submissions to the CPS program for all personnel on their teams to avoid their proposals being deemed non-compliant.\n\nAdditionally, proposals submitted in response to this solicitation may not duplicate or be substantially similar to other proposals concurrently under consideration by other NSF, DHS, DOT, NIH, or NIFA programs. Duplicate or substantially similar proposals will be returned without review, including those substantially similar to previously declined proposals.\n\nAdditional Eligibility Info:\n\nThe CPS program encourages applications from groups eligible to compete as Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI; see NSF 14-579) or Grants Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI; see PAPPG, Chapter II.E.4) under the CPS program deadlines.\n\nIn addition, the organization limit above does not preclude eligible organizations from submitting proposals that involve participation of for-profit corporations as subawardees, unfunded collaborators, contributors, or GOALI partners.\n\nFor proposals that designate NIFA as the requested funding agency, in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the Proposal Preparation Instructions, eligible applicants include:(1) State agricultural experiment stations; (2) Colleges and universities (including junior colleges offering associate degrees or higher); (3) University research foundations; (4) Other research institutions and organizations; (5) Federal agencies, (6) National laboratories; (7) Private organizations or corporations; (8) Individuals who are U.S. citizens, nationals, or permanent residents; and (9) any group consisting of two or more entities identified in (1) through (8).\n\nEligible institutions do not include foreign and international organizations.\n\nThe eligibility criteria for all other proposals, including those targeting a specific agency other than NIFA for sponsorship, are as listed under \"Who May Submit Proposals\" above. Proposals that do not meet these criteria, and do not explicitly designate NIFA as the requested funding agency in the Project Summary, will be returned without review.\n\nV.

Paper copies of the Grants.gov Application Guide also may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-8134 or by e-mail from nsfpubs@nsf.gov.\n\nIn determining which method to utilize in the electronic preparation and submission of the proposal, please note the following:\n\nCollaborative Proposals. All collaborative proposals submitted as separate submissions from multiple organizations must be submitted via Research.gov. PAPPG Chapter II.D.3 provides additional information on collaborative proposals.\n\nSee PAPPG Chapter II.C.2 for guidance on the required sections of a full research proposal submitted to NSF. Please note that the proposal preparation instructions provided in this program solicitation may deviate from the PAPPG instructions.\n\nThe following information supplements the guidelines and requirements in the NSF PAPPG and NSF Grants.gov Application Guide:\n\nProposal Titles: Proposal titles must indicate the CPS program, followed by a colon, then the project class, followed by a colon, then the title of the project. For example, a CPS Frontier proposal title would be CPS: Frontier: Title. Titles of collaborative proposals should be prepared as above, but should also include \"Collaborative Research\" followed by a colon at the beginning of the title of the project. For example, the title of each proposal for a collaborative set of proposals for a Medium project would be Collaborative Research: CPS: Medium: Title. Proposals that include a Transition to Practice (TTP) option should include \"TTP Option\" followed by a colon immediately after identifying as CPS. For example, a CPS Frontier project with the TTP option should have a title of the form CPS: TTP Option: Frontier: Title. Proposals from PIs in institutions that have RUI (Research in Undergraduate Institutions) eligibility should also include \"RUI\" followed by a colon before the project title, for example, CPS: Medium: RUI: Title. Similarly, GOALI (Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry) proposals should include \"GOALI\" followed by a colon as the last identifier before the project title.\n\nProject Summary:\n\nAt the top of the Overview text box, enter the title of the CPS project, the name of the lead PI, and the name of the lead institution. Provide an overview description of the CPS project. This description should explicitly identify the core CPS research areas addressed by the proposal. In separate statements, provide a summary of the intellectual merit of the proposed project in the \"intellectual merit\" box, and broader impacts in the \"broader impacts\" box. If submitting a proposal for a specific agency, this must be indicated just above the keywords in the Project Summary, e.g., \"Requested funding agency:\" followed by that agency's abbreviated name, i.e., \"NSF\", \"DHS\", \"DOT\", \"NIH\", or \"NIFA\". If no agency is designated, the proposal will be considered for funding by all of the joint sponsoring agencies. If proposers choose to target a specific agency, they must first communicate with a Program Officer from that agency and receive permission or instruction to do so.\n\nAt the end of the Project Summary, all proposals must include a prioritized list of 2-4 keywords maximum separated by \",\". The keywords must be drawn from the lists below and best characterize the project from the perspectives of the core CPS research area(s) and application domain(s). include a prioritized list of keywords extracted from the list below which identify the core CPS Research Area(s) addressed, and the Application Domain(s) that best characterize the project. CPS proposals are grouped into \"review panels\" of related proposals for merit review and discussion. Panelists are selected for their expertise in the panel topic area. The suggested topic areas span the core CPS areas of research and application spaces and indicate the areas of panelist expertise that are most important for understanding the innovative aspects of the proposal.\n\nAll proposals must include a prioritized list of 2-4 keywords maximum separated by \",\". The keywords must be drawn from the lists below and best characterize the project from the perspectives of the core research area(s) and application domain(s). Proposers must include at least one keyword each from the core research areas and the application domains. In addition, the keyword list should include at least one element that is not \"other - please specify\". Proposals that do not include keywords will be returned without review.\n\nCore Research Areas:\n\nAutonomy\n\nControl\n\nCPS System Architecture\n\nData analytics and machine learning including real-time learning for control\n\nDesign of CPS\n\nInternet of things (IoT)\n\nMixed initiatives including human-in- or on-the-loop\n\nNetworking\n\nSecurity and privacy\n\nReal-time systems\n\nSafety\n\nVerification.\n\nOther (Please specify)\n\nCore Application Domains:\n\nAgriculture\n\nCivil and Mechanical including infrastructure\n\nEnergy\n\nManufacturing\n\nMedical including Health and Wellness\n\nTransportation including air and ground\n\nOther (Please specify)\n\nFor example:\n\nKeywords: Data analytics and machine learning, Energy\n\nKeywords: Autonomy, Control\n\nKeywords: Agriculture, Autonomy, Internet of Things (IoT)\n\nProject Description:\n\nDescribe the research and education activities to be undertaken in up to 15 pages for Small and Medium proposals and up to 20 pages for Frontier proposals.\n\nProposals that address a next-generation CPS application in conjunction with research in one or more of the core dimensions of CPS-science, engineering, and technology, should clearly specify the target application in the Project Description.\n\nThe Project Description must include the following subsections specifically labeled as below. Proposals that fail to include one or more of these sections will be returned without review (RWR), without exception.\n\nResearch Description: This is the intellectual heart of the Project Description. The Research Description section must describe the technical rationale and technical approach of the CPS research. It should describe the challenges that drive the research problem. It must identify how the research integrates cyber and physical components. It must explain how the proposal goes beyond sensing and how the system \"closes the loop.\" For research focusing on \"tools for CPS design or verification\", the proposal must show how these tools are applicable to CPS, which have cyber and physical components that \"close the loop.\" This section should describe specific activities for performing the research. It should provide the project research plan including descriptions of major tasks, the primary organization responsible for each task, and the milestones. The research description must include a Gantt chart which lays out the sequence of major activities and their inter-dependencies.\n\nThe CPS Research Focus subsection of the Research Description is where the PI describes how the research is driven by the unique cyber-physical system attributes of the challenge problem and clearly identifies the core CPS research areas addressed (as listed in the Project Summary section above) in which the novel and foundational research contributions are being made.\n\nEvaluation/Experimentation Plan: This section should describe how the research concepts proposed will be demonstrated and validated. It should present metrics for success. It should identify critical experiments, and describe how the research will be demonstrated, including through simulation, prototyping, and integration with real (including sub-scale) cyber-physical systems. For Medium and Frontier projects, the validation plan must include experimentation on an actual cyber-physical system.\n\nProject Management and Collaboration Plan: This section should summarize how the project team is appropriate to realize the project goals and how the team will assure effective collaboration. It should provide a compelling rationale for any multi-institution structure of the project, if appropriate. The plan should identify organizational responsibilities and how the project will be managed, including approaches for meeting project goals. Specific information should include: 1) the specific roles of the project participants in all involved organizations; 2) information on how the project will be managed across all the investigators, institutions, and/or disciplines; 3) approaches for integration of research components throughout the project and, 4) identification of the specific coordination mechanisms that will enable cross-investigator, cross-institution, and/or cross-discipline scientific integration. In the case of Frontier projects, the plan should also identify a single individual who will be responsible for executing the management and collaboration plan, identify any specific roles for, and the amount of the budget to be allocated for project administration. Frontier projects must also include a kick-off meeting with all participants in coordination with NSF, as well as at least annual in-progress meetings with NSF. For Frontier projects, PIs and all co-PIs must be present in-person for the kick-off meeting. NSF also strongly prefers that PIs and all co-PIs for each Frontier project (including collaborative projects) be present in-person for annual in-progress meetings.\n\nBroader Impacts: In addition to the specific information required in the PAPPG, this section should provide plans for integrating research outcomes into education and more broadly advancing CPS education. It should also describe how the research and education outcomes will be disseminated in a manner that enables the CPS research community and others to use the results in ways that go beyond traditional academic publications. For Frontier proposals, the education and outreach discussion should be described within a separate subsection titled Education and Outreach Plan, within Broader Impacts, and must provide significant detail on the planned activities to explain how it will have meaningful impact.\n\nSupplementary Documents:\n\nIn the Supplementary Documents section, upload the following. Please note that Research.gov currently can only accept one file for Other Supplementary Documents. If submitting via Research.gov, please combine all documents designated as Other Supplementary Documents into one PDF.\n\n(1) A list of Project Personnel and Partner Institutions (note: in separately submitted collaborative proposals, only the lead institution should provide this information):\n\nProvide current, accurate information for all personnel and institutions involved in the project. NSF staff will use this information in the merit review process to manage reviewer selection. The list must include all PIs, co-PIs, Senior Personnel, paid/unpaid Consultants or Collaborators, Subawardees, and Postdocs. If the project includes a Transition to Practice (TTP) option, this list must include personnel and institutions involved in the option. This list should be numbered and include (in this order) Full name, Organization(s), and Role in the project, with each item separated by a semi-colon. Each person listed should start a new numbered line. For example:\n\nMary Smith; XYZ University; PI\n\nJohn Jones; University of PQR; Senior Personnel\n\nJane Brown; XYZ University; Postdoc\n\nBob Adams; ABC Inc.; Paid Consultant\n\nMary White; Welldone Institution; Unpaid Collaborator\n\n(2) Transition to Practice (TTP) Option Proposals:\n\nProjects may include a Transition to Practice (TTP) option. Proposals submitted with a TTP option must include a Supplementary Document of up to five pages in order for the option to be considered for funding. This document should describe how successful proposed research results are to be further developed, matured, and experimentally deployed in organizations, networks and end systems. It should also include an option budget that indicates what additional funds would be needed to carry out the TTP option. This budget for the TTP option may not exceed one third of the base project budget or $400,000 whichever is less. Note no TTP funds should be requested for the first project year.\n\nNote that the budget for the TTP option must be specified separately within the five-page Supplementary Document. The proposal budget should reflect the base project without TTP option. If the TTP option is to be awarded, the proposer will be requested to update the Project Budget and Justification to include TTP costs.\n\n(3) Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan (if applicable):\n\nEach proposal that requests funding to support postdoctoral researchers must include, as a Supplementary Document, a description of the mentoring activities that will be provided for such individuals. In no more than one page, the mentoring plan must describe the mentoring that will be provided to all postdoctoral researchers supported by the project, irrespective of whether they reside at the submitting organization, any subawardee organization, or at any organization participating in a simultaneously submitted collaborative project.\n\n(4) Data Management Plan (required):\n\nProposals must include a Supplementary Document of no more than two pages labeled \"Data Management Plan.\" This Supplementary Document should describe how the proposal will conform to NSF policy on the dissemination and sharing of research results.\n\nSee PAPPG, Chapter II.C.2j for full policy implementation.\n\nFor additional information see https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp.\n\nFor specific guidance for proposals submitted to the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) see https://www.nsf.gov/cise/cise_dmp.jsp.\n\nFor USDA/NIFA: A Data Management Plan (DMP) is required and is to clearly articulate how the project director (PD) and co-PDs plan to manage and disseminate the data generated by the project. The DMP will be considered during the merit review process (see Section VI). The requirements for preparation and inclusion of a DMP in your application is included on the following web page, https://nifa.usda.gov/resource/data-management-plan-nifa-funded-research-projects. Also included on the web page are FAQs and information about accessing examples of DMPs.\n\nAll projects are strongly encouraged to share results, including software and other artifacts, with the CPS research community through the CPS Virtual Organization (CPS-VO). Plans for sharing should be described in the Data Management Plan. Frontier proposals are required to include a plan for such sharing with the CPS-VO that goes beyond hosting PI meeting information such as posters and videos to the website.\n\n(5) Broadening Participation in Computing and Engineering Plans for Frontier, Medium projects:\n\nEach Frontier project is required to include as a one- to three-page Supplementary Document a meaningful BPC plan that will be evaluated during merit review.\n\nEach Medium project must, by the time of award, have in place an approved BPC / BPE plan. In this ongoing pilot phase, the CPS program will work with each PI team following merit review and prior to making an award to ensure that plans are meaningful and include concrete metrics for success. The CPS program will also provide opportunities for PIs to share BPC / BPE experiences and innovations through program PI meetings. CISE PIs of Medium proposals are therefore strongly encouraged to consider this eventual requirement as they develop their proposals, and to include one- to three-page descriptions of their planned BPC activities under Supplementary Documents in their submissions. Feedback will be provided on such plans. Similarly, ENG PIs are strongly encouraged to include one- to three-page descriptions of their planned BPE activities under Supplementary Documents in their submissions.\n\n(6) Cloud Computing Resources:\n\nIf requesting cloud computing resources, include a description of the request (not to exceed two pages) as a supplementary document that includes the: (1) title of the proposal; (2) institution name, (3) anticipated total cost of computing resources, with yearly breakdown; (4) specific cloud computing providers that will be used; and (5) technical description and justification of the request, along with how the cost was estimated. The NSF Budget should not include any costs for accessing cloud computing resources via CloudBank. The total cost of the project, including this cloud computing resource request , may not exceed the budget limits for the chosen project class, as described in this solicitation. Proposers should include \"CloudAccess\" (one word without space) as a keyword on the Project Summary page, at the end of the Overview section (before the section on Intellectual Merit).\n\nSingle Copy Documents:\n\nCollaborators and Other Affiliations Information: Proposers should follow the guidance specified in Chapter II.C.1.e of the NSF PAPPG. Grants.gov Users: The COA information must be provided through use of the COA template and uploaded as a PDF attachment.\n\nNote the distinction to the list of Project Personnel and Partner Institutions specified above under Supplementary Documents: the listing of all project participants is collected by the project lead and entered as a Supplementary Document, which is then automatically included with all proposals in a project. The Collaborators and Other Affiliations are entered for each participant within each proposal and, as Single Copy Documents, are available only to NSF staff.\n\nProposal Preparation Checklist:\n\nThe following checklist is provided as a reminder of the items that should be included in a proposal submitted to this solicitation. These are a summary of the requirements described above. For the items marked with (RWR), the proposal will be returned without review if the required item is noncompliant at the submission deadline.\n\nFor all proposals:\n\n(RWR) At the end of the Project Summary, include a prioritized list of 2-4 keywords maximum describing the core CPS Research Area(s) addressed and the Application Domain(s) that characterize the project as described in the section.\n\n(RWR) Project Description not to exceed 15 pages for Small and Medium Proposals, and 20 pages for Frontier Proposals.\n\n(RWR) Specific labeled sections in the Project Description for \"Research Description,\" \"Evaluation/Experimentation Plan,\" and \"Project Management and Collaboration Plan.\"\n\n(RWR) A subsection labeled \"CPS Research Focus\" is required in the \"Research Description\" section of the Project Description.\n\n(RWR) A section labeled \"Broader Impacts\" is required within the Project Description.\n\nFor Frontier proposals, a subsection labeled \"Education and Outreach Plan\" is required in the Broader Impacts section of the Project Description.\n\nProposed activities under the TTP option MUST NOT be described in the Project Description section, and instead MUST be described in a Supplementary Document of no more than five pages.\n\nProposal titles must indicate the CPS program, followed by a colon, then the project class, followed by a colon, then the title of the project.\n\nProposals targeting a specific agency sponsorship should indicate so just above the keywords in the Project Summary, but only if the proposers have previously communicated with a Program Officer from that agency and received permission or instruction to do so.\n\nProject Personnel and Partner Institutions list as a Supplementary Document must be included.\n\n(RWR) Frontier projects are required to include one- to three-page plans for Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) as a Supplementary Document.\n\nThere are a number of additional items (such as Data Management Plan, Post Doc Mentoring Plan, Results from Prior NSF Support, etc.) that are required in all NSF proposals unless otherwise stated. The proposer is strongly advised to consult the PAPPG for the complete list of requirements.\n\nB. Budgetary Information\n\nCost Sharing:\n\nInclusion of voluntary committed cost sharing is prohibited.\n\nIndirect Cost (F&A) Limitations:\n\nFor awards made by NSF, Proposal & Award Policy & Procedures (PAPPG) guidelines apply. Proposals selected for funding by DHS and/or DOT will be awarded by NSF using funds transferred from DHS and/or DOT, respectively, and so they will follow NSF's PAPPG.\n\nFor awards made by NIH, indirect costs on foreign subawards/subcontracts will be limited to eight percent.\n\nFor awards made by NIFA: Indirect Cost (IDC) is not to exceed 30 percent of Total Federal Funds Awarded (TFFA) of the recipient.\n\n7 U.S.C. § 3310 limits IDC for the overall award to 30 percent of Total Federal Funds Awarded (TFFA) under a research, education, or extension grant. The maximum IDC rate allowed under the award is determined by calculating the amount of IDC using:\n\nthe sum of an institution's negotiated indirect cost rate and the indirect cost rate charged by sub-awardees, if any; or\n\n30 percent of TFFA.\n\nThe maximum allowable IDC rate under the award, including the IDC charged by the sub-awardee(s), if any, is the lesser of the two rates.\n\nIf the result of number 1) above is the lesser of the two rates, the grant recipient is allowed to charge the negotiated IDC rate on the prime award and the sub-award(s), if any. Any sub-awards would be subject to the sub-awardee's negotiated IDC rate. The sub-awardee may charge its negotiated IDC rate on its portion of the award, provided the sum of the IDC rate charged under the award by the prime awardee and the sub-awardee(s) does not exceed 30 percent of the TFFA.\n\nIf the result of number 2) above is the lesser of the two rates, then the maximum IDC rate allowed for the overall award, including any sub-award(s), is limited to 30 percent of the TFFA. That is, the IDC of the prime awardee plus the sum of the IDC charged by the sub-awardee(s), if any, may not exceed 30 percent of the TFFA.\n\nIn the event of an award, the prime awardee is responsible for ensuring the maximum indirect cost allowed for the award is not exceeded when combining IDC for the Federal portion (i.e., prime and sub-awardee(s)) and any applicable cost-sharing (see 7 CFR 3430.52(b)). Amounts exceeding the maximum allowable IDC is considered unallowable. See sections 408 and 410 of 2 CFR 200.\n\nOther Budgetary Limitations:\n\nCost Sharing Requirements for awards made by NIFA:\n\nMatching funds requirements may be found at 7 U.S.C. 3157 (b)(9). If an applied Research (see Part VIII, D of this RFA) or Integrated Project with an applied research component, is commodity-specific and not of national scope, the grant recipient is required to match the USDA funds awarded on a dollar-for-dollar basis from non-federal sources with cash and/or in-kind contributions.\n\nNIFA may waive the matching funds requirement based on submitted document (see Part IV, C(6) of this RFA), for a grant if we determine that:\n\nThe results of the project, while of particular benefit to a specific agricultural commodity, are likely to be applicable to agricultural commodities generally; or\n\nThe project involves a minor commodity, the project deals with scientifically important research, and the grant recipient is unable to satisfy the matching funds requirement\n\nBudget Preparation Instructions:\n\nBudgets for all projects must include funding for one or more designated CPS project representatives (PI/co-PI/senior researcher or NSF-approved replacement) to attend each CPS PI meeting during the proposed lifetime of the award (per Section II.E above). For budget preparation purposes, PIs should assume these meetings will be held in the fall of each year in the Washington, DC, area.\n\nC. Due Dates\n\nSubmission Window Date(s) (due by 5 p.m. submitter's local time):\n\nProposals Accepted Anytime\n\nSMALL and MEDIUM Proposals\n\nJune 01, 2023 - June 15, 2023\n\nFRONTIER proposals\n\nD.

For proposers that submitted via Grants.gov, until an application has been received and validated by NSF, the Authorized Organizational Representative may check the status of an application on Grants.gov. After proposers have received an e-mail notification from NSF, Research.gov should be used to check the status of an application.\n\nVI. NSF Proposal Processing And Review Procedures\n\nProposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as ad hoc reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in PAPPG Exhibit III-1.\n\nA comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/.\n\nProposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in Leading the World in Discovery and Innovation, STEM Talent Development and the Delivery of Benefits from Research - NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2022 - 2026. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.\n\nOne of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.\n\nNSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.\n\nA. Merit Review Principles and Criteria\n\nThe National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission \"to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes.\" NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.\n\n1. Merit Review Principles\n\nThese principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:\n\nAll NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.\n\nNSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These \"Broader Impacts\" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.\n\nMeaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should b"
