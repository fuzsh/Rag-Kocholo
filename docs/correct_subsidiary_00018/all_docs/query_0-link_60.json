        "text": "Ideally any test should provide a clear pass or fail indication. In the case of RISC-V processor DV this is achieved with a comparison against a quality reference model.\n\nSTING helps generate portable, architecturally correct and self-checking tests targeted at the corner-case scenarios by automating the comparison of the DUT against the Imperas reference model results.\n\nWe are delighted to be working with Imperas to deliver the fastest Instruction Accurate (IA) simulation solution for our many MIPS partners. We have been impressed how Imperasâ€™ simulation technology significantly outperforms other commonly-used solutions. Faster simulation results in more tests being run, and therefore higher quality software being developed - and that is good news for our extensive MIPS ecosystem community. Since acquiring MIPS, Imagination has committed to working more closely with innovative partners like Imperas to deliver superior CPU modelling solutions. As a result, we are confident our MIPS licensees and many software ecosystem partners will have access to the best tools in the industry, enabling them to create the best possible software and products."
