        "text": "Synopsys’ SaberES Designer™ provides an integrated process for electrical system design from concept to manufacturing. Redundant data entry is nearly eliminated fostering correct-by-construction and first-pass success. SaberES Designer is used to author electrical connectivity and design content and then populates the CATIA 3D model with wires, connectivity, connectors, splices, harnesses, etc. After the wire harness is routed in CATIA, wire lengths, layout, positions, and mechanical passives can be passed back to the Saber environment for simulation and manufacturing outputs to suppliers. The close, two-way integration greatly improves product quality and engineering productivity."
