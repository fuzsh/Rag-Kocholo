        "text": "Synopsys, Inc. announced that it has executed an agreement to acquire Integrated Systems Engineering AG (ISE), a leader in Technology CAD (TCAD) software products and services. TCAD tools are a critical part of an overall design-for-manufacturing (DFM) solution as they precisely simulate advanced semiconductor processes down to the atomic level before they are put into production. This can reduce the number of test chips required to optimize and characterize a new semiconductor process, shortening the time and cost to ramp up yield in leading-edge fabs. Combining the predictive capabilities of ISE's software with Synopsys' design tools will help Synopsys customers achieve the highest possible yields by tuning their designs to the precise characteristics of a particular process.\n\n\"Design and fabrication are becoming increasingly interdependent and require a comprehensive solution with a top-to-bottom focus on improving yields,\" said Dr. Aart de Geus, chairman and CEO of Synopsys. \"We have multiple features in our Galaxy Design platform that address yield today, as well as the broadest portfolio of DFM products in the industry. ISE's capabilities are highly complementary to ours and will allow us to provide a more robust solution that addresses yields throughout the design and manufacturing process.\"\n\n\"During the past few years, the adoption of TCAD in the semiconductor industry has grown tremendously,\" said Dr. Wolfgang Fichtner, founder and CEO of ISE. \"The acquisition by Synopsys will create synergies that enable Synopsys to provide robust next-generation DFM solutions and TCAD products to customers worldwide.\"\n\nISE is a privately held company headquartered in Switzerland with principal offices in Zurich and San Jose, California. The acquisition will be made by way of a cash tender offer to all ISE stockholders and option holders. The acquisition price is approximately $95 million, net of cash estimated to be held by ISE at closing, plus a three year earnout based on product line performance and employee retention, with a maximum potential earnout payment of $20 million. The transaction is expected to close in November 2004. The transaction is subject to the condition that 90 percent or more of ISE shares be tendered in the offer and other customary closing conditions. The impact of the transaction on Synopsys' fiscal year 2005 financial forecast will be discussed on Synopsys' fourth quarter and fiscal year 2004 earnings conference call."
