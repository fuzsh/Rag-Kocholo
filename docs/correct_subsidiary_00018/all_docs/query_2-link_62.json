        "text": "FPGA-Based Prototyping Market Leader Chooses CR-8000 PCB Design Platform\n\n2 September 2015 – Zuken announces that Synopsys has chosen Zuken’s CR-8000 PCB design platform for their HAPS® FPGA-based prototyping family of products.\n\nSynopsys sought the highest-performing PCB design platform available to assist with designing complex high-speed boards for their HAPS prototyping systems. Synopsys’ integrated and scalable hardware and software FPGA-based prototyping systems accelerate pre-silicon software development, hardware/software integration and system validation of IP and SoC designs. HAPS systems are used by design and validation teams to accelerate their SoC design schedules and avoid costly device re-spins.\n\nJohn Koeter, Vice President of Marketing for IP and Prototyping at Synopsys says: “To develop Synopsys’ highest performing SoC prototyping systems, we need a PCB design environment that can address the routing, signal integrity and timing margin challenges on these complex boards. Zuken’s CR-8000 met all of our requirements and we are using it to design the new high performance components in our next-generation HAPS systems.”\n\nZuken’s CR-8000 is the industry’s only 3D, multi-board PCB design platform based on product-centric design principles. CR-8000 takes advantage of today’s multi-core processors and the latest graphics standards to maximize performance.\n\nKent McLeroth, CEO Zuken USA Inc., says: “Synopsys and Zuken have a long history of successful collaboration, and we look forward to continuing this relationship. The size and complexity of Synopsys’ HAPS systems is exactly the type of challenge we had in mind when developing the next generation CR-8000 design platform.”\n\nFor more information see www.zuken.com/cr-8000 and www.synopsys.com/HAPS\n\n- ends -\n\nFor a downloadable Word document and press images visit the press kits area of the press center www.zuken.com/presskits.\n\nWords = 259\n\nCaptions\n\nImage: Zuken-Z0404-SynopsysHAPS.jpg\n\nCaption: Synopsys has chosen Zuken’s CR-8000 as the PCB design platform for their HAPS® (High-performance ASIC Prototyping System) FPGA-based prototyping family of products.\n\nImage: Zuken-Z0404-John Koeter.jpg\n\nCaption: John Koeter, Vice President of Marketing for IP and Prototyping at Synopsys\n\nFor more information contact your local PR person:\n\nAmericas\n\nAmy Clements, Zuken USA Inc., 238 Littleton RD, STE 100, Westford, MA 01886\n\nTel: 1 972-691-3284\n\nE-mail: amy.clements@zuken.com\n\nTwitter: @ZukenAmericas\n\nNorthern & Southern Europe\n\nSally Wilkes, Zuken Ltd., 1500 Aztec West, Almondsbury, Bristol, BS32 4RF, UK\n\nTel: 44 (0)1454 207800\n\nE-mail: sally.wilkes@zuken.com\n\nTwitter: @ZukenUK_SCAN\n\nPoland\n\nDionne Hayman, Zuken Ltd., 1500 Aztec West, Almondsbury, Bristol, BS32 4RF, UK\n\nTel: 44 7980 797040\n\nE-mail: dionne.hayman@zuken.com\n\nTwitter: @ZukenUK_SCAN\n\nCentral Europe\n\nKlaus Wiedemann, Zuken GmbH, Am Söldnermoos 17, 85399 Hallbergmoos, Deutschland\n\nTel.: 49 89 607696-58\n\nE-mail: Klaus.Wiedemann@zuken.com\n\nTwitter: @ZukenCentralEur\n\nAbout HAPS®\n\nSynopsys HAPS® (High-performance ASIC Prototyping Systems) FPGA-based prototyping solution provides an integrated and scalable hardware-software solution used by design and validation teams to improve their ASIC design schedules and avoid costly device re-spins. HAPS systems enable a more parallel hardware/software development strategy where software developers, validation engineers and system integration experts have access to prototypes running at near real time speed months before tape-out of new ASIC silicon. FPGA-based prototypes are ideal for pre-silicon software development, system validation and hardware/software integration of ASIC IP and SoC designs. www.synopsys.com/HAPS\n\nAbout CR-8000\n\nWith a fully integrated design flow from initial planning through circuit engineering, physical layout and manufacturing output, CR-8000 is the only concept-to-manufacturing, native 2D and 3D, single and multi-board system design platform on the market. It was developed from the start to address the challenges of system-level design optimization, offering companies a competitive edge in their product design by supporting faster design turnaround and improved time-to-market. Base components include: System Planner, Design Gateway, Design Force and DFM Center. www.zuken.com/cr-8000\n\nAbout Zuken\n\nZuken is a global provider of leading-edge software and consulting services for electrical and electronic design and manufacturing.
