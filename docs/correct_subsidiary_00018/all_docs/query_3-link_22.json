However, challenges remain in accurately estimating target dimensions due to beam geometric expansion and overlap, particularly in athwart-beam measurements, which tend to be overestimated with increasing distance from the transducer. We present an interactive web application that simulates distortion caused by beam overlap and expansion in multibeam sonars using simple geometric equations. Users can define sonar characteristics, such as the number of beams, swath opening, or degree of overlap, as well as specify an elliptical target’s dimensions, orientation, and distance from the transducer. The application estimates and visualises the true and distorted shapes of the target, calculating the level of distortion. It can run simulations in both forward and inverse directions, either simulating the distortion of a true school or correcting the shape of a distorted school. This tool aims to enhance the interpretation of multibeam sonar signals and improve the accuracy of target dimension estimates, facilitating more effective use of these sonars in scientific research.

The complexity of the integrated system applied to shipbuilding and software errors have increased with the high degree of automation. Direct on-site inspection methods are associated with high costs and safety risks, whereas software-based simulations rely heavily on the accuracy of the models of power system components. Hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS) can be utilized for designing and testing intricate real-time embedded systems. Specifically, HILS offers a reliable means of evaluating power management system (PMS) performance for LNGCs, which are high-value vessels commonly used in offshore plants. This study proposes a PMS–HIL test bed comprising a power supply unit, consumer, simulation control console, and main switchboard. The proposed HILS test bed utilizes the real equipment data of the shipbuilding industry to replicate the conditions associated with actual LNGCs. The proposed system is verified and validated through a software acceptance test procedure. Additionally, load-sharing, load-dependent start, blackout prevention, and preferential tests are performed for the PMS function evaluation. Test results indicate that the proposed system has great potential for conventional PMS commissioning. Therefore, it exhibits the potential to replace traditional factory acceptance tests. Additional development of the system will be conducted for ship automation, utilizing PMS control and an energy management system.

In this study, the flow-induced vibration characteristics and energy conversion efficiency of a D-section prism were investigated using the k-ω SST turbulence model and Newmark-β method. The vibration amplitude, frequency, equilibrium position offset, and energy conversion efficiency of the two-degree-of-freedom cylinder were systematically analyzed at seven angles of attack between 0 and 180 degrees. The Reynolds number ranged from 368 to 14,742, corresponding to equivalent speeds of 2 to 20. The results indicate that the angle of attack has a significant influence on the flow-induced vibration response of the D-section prism. As the angle of attack changes, the vibration amplitude of the cylinder continuously increases, and the cylinder sequentially enters the vortex-induced vibration, vortex-induced vibration-galloping, and fully galloping branches. The change in the angle of attack disrupts the symmetry of the cylinder’s vibration in the streamwise direction, leading to a shift in the equilibrium position of the cylinder’s vibration. When the angle of attack is 0°, the energy conversion efficiency of the column reaches a maximum of 11.75%. Additionally, at high Reynolds numbers, the vibration of the cylinder is not self-limiting, making it more advantageous for energy conversion devices compared to cylinders with circular cross-sections.

Using the horizontal rectangle baffle is a promising way to restrain its sloshing motion. But the location height and optimal baffle area rate to achieve a better anti-sloshing effect should be studied first. The discrete element method was adopted to establish the simulation model, and the direct shear test was used for verification. Through the static tilt tests, the definite relationship between the effects of moisture content on cargo motion and particle friction coefficients was acquired. Then, liquefied cargo motion in a cargo hold without baffles and with one and two pairs of horizontal baffles was simulated. Based on variations in the cargo gravity center offset and the sloshing-induced force on the cargo hold, the anti-sloshing effect of different settings of the baffles was compared. Results show that the baffles have the ability to restrain cargo sloshing, and this is important for sea transportation safety. The anti-sloshing effect is better when the baffle plane is right on the cargo top surface compared to the other location heights. Further, there is an optimal length–width combination, e.g., a single baffle plane with a length of 0.26 L and a width of 0.46 B, at which a better anti-sloshing effect could be achieved with the smallest baffle area rate. This study could be useful for the practical application of horizontal baffles for bulk granular cargo carriers.

In the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea, the influence of grid resolution and assimilation window size on simulating storm surge levels was investigated during Typhoon 7203. In order to employ a more realistic wind stress drag coefficient that varies with time and space, we corrected the storm surge model using the spatial distribution of the wind stress drag coefficient, which was inverted using the data assimilation method based on the linear expression Cd = (a + b × U10) × 10−3. Initially, two grid resolutions of 5′ × 5′ and 10′ × 10′ were applied to the numerical storm surge model and adjoint assimilation model. It was found that the influence of different grid resolutions on the numerical model is almost negligible. But in the adjoint assimilation model, the root mean square (RMS) errors between the simulated and observed storm surge levels under 5′ × 5′ and 10′ × 10′ grid resolutions were 11.6 cm and 15.6 cm, and the average PCC and WSS values for 10 tidal stations changed from 89% and 92% in E3 to 93% and 96% in E4, respectively. The results indicate that the finer grid resolution can yield a closer consistency between the simulation and observations. Subsequently, the effects of assimilation window sizes of 6 h, 3 h, 2 h, and 1 h on simulated storm surge levels were evaluated in an adjoint assimilation model with a 5′ × 5′ grid resolution. The results show that the average RMS errors were 11.6 cm, 10.6 cm, 9.6 cm, and 9.3 cm under four assimilation window sizes. In particular, the RMS errors for the assimilation window sizes of 1 h and 6 h at RuShan station were 3.9 cm and 10.2 cm, a reduction of 61.76%. The PCC and WSS values from RuShan station in E4 and E7 separately showed significant increases, from 85% to 98% and from 92% to 99%. These results demonstrate that when the assimilation window size is smaller, the simulated storm surge level is closer to the observation. Further, the results show that the simulated storm surge levels are closer to the observation when using the wind stress drag coefficient with a finer grid resolution and smaller temporal resolution.

Liquefied natural gas is a low-carbon fuel, and when liquefied natural gas (LNG) is used on ships, dual-fuel methods are often used. The pre-chamber plays a key role in the working process of dual-fuel engines. In this paper, an effective three-dimensional simulation model based on the actual operating conditions and structural characteristics of a marine low-pressure dual-fuel engine is established. In addition, the effects of changing the Precombustion chamber (PCC) volume ratio and the PCC orifice diameter ratio on the mixture composition, engine combustion performance, and pollutant generation were thoroughly investigated. It was found that a small PPC volume ratio resulted in a higher flame jet velocity, a shorter stagnation period, and an acceleration of the combustion process in the main combustion chamber. When the PCC volume was large, the Nitrogen oxygen (NOx) ratio emission was elevated. Moreover, the angle of the PCC orifice affected the flame propagation direction of the pilot fuel. Optimizing the angle of the PCC orifice can improve combustion efficiency and reduce the generation of NOx. Furthermore, reasonable arrangement of the PCC structure can improve the stability of ignition performance and accelerate the flame jet velocity.

The cylindrical shell is the most sensible and rational packaging structure for these detectors. New technical challenges for enhancing the pressure resistance and lightweight design of the pressure-resistant cylindrical shell arise from the need to ensure that the detector packaging structure can withstand the immense water pressure at tens of thousands of meters in the underwater environment, while simultaneously reducing the detector packaging structure’s self-weight. This article examines the detection system’s deep-sea pressure-resistant cylindrical shell. To address the issue of the pressure-resistant shell’s insufficient ability to counteract the overall instability caused by the inability to form unstable half-waves in the radial direction when the ring rib pressure-resistant shell experiences it, a design method for the ribs inside the unequal-stiffness pressure-resistant cylindrical shell is suggested. The shell’s instability pressure increases by 9.65 MPa following the stiffness adjustment. Simultaneously, in order to attain even more lightweight optimization, the optimal inner rib section was obtained by applying the orthogonal topology optimization method, which also reduced the weight by 106.8 g and effectively improved the compression stability of the high-pressure cylindrical shell structure. Based on this, key optimization variables were found by performing sensitivity analysis on the cylindrical shell structure’s parameters. Then, with lightweighting as the primary objective, the high-pressure-resistant cylindrical shell’s optimal structural parameters were found using a multi-objective optimization process using the second-generation fast non-dominated genetic algorithm (NSGA-2). This resulted in a weight reduction of 1.2492 kg, or 17.26% of the original pressure-resistant shell. This has led to the development of a lightweight, highly pressure-resistant method for packaging marine exploration equipment structures.

In the numerical calculation of ship maneuvering, uncertainty analysis is a necessary step to ensure the accuracy of the calculation. In this study, uncertainty pair analysis is carried out in the simulation of the turning circle motion of the standard ship model ONRT in waves. According to the uncertainty analysis procedure recommended by the International Towing Tank Conference (ITTC), the change of ship resistance caused by the number of grids is studied to determine the influence of grid density on the numerical prediction. The simulation of turning motion in waves is carried out based on the uncertainty analysis. It is found that the minimum number of overset grids for this simulation is 1.4 million. The numerical results are fairly accurate compared to experimental results, and this technique provides a method with low calculated cost for this simulation.

The forces of the AAMV exhibit strong nonlinear and water–air coupling characteristics, resulting in particularly complex motion characteristics. This paper presents a longitudinal and lateral stability model of the AAMV, which considers the effects of aerodynamic alleviation. Additionally, a numerical model of wind and wave turbulence forces is established, which considers viscous correction based on the potential theory. Finally, the effect of wind and wave turbulence forces on the motion stability of the AAMV under regular and irregular waves is analyzed by numerical solution. The simulation results demonstrate the influence of these disturbance forces on the stability of the AAMV under different sea states. The motion parameters of the AAMV exhibit a pronounced response to changes in sea state level. The aerodynamically alleviated effect is enhanced as speed increases, and the influence of winds and waves on the AAMV is greatly weakened, reducing the possibility of instability. During the cruising phase under class V sea state, the pitch, roll, and heave response are 0.210°, 0.0229°, and 0.0734 m, respectively. This effect can effectively improve the motion stability of the AAMV in winds and waves.

The enzymatic hydrolysis of R. okamurae, non-pretreated and hydrothermally acid-pretreated (0.2 N HCl, 15 min), was carried out, reaching reducing sugar (RS) concentrations of 10.7 g/L and 21.7 g/L, respectively. The hydrolysates obtained were used as a culture medium for PHB production with Cupriavidus necator, a Gram-negative soil bacterium, without supplementation with any external carbon and nitrogen sources. The highest yield (0.774 g PHB/g RS) and biopolymer accumulation percentage (89.8% cell dry weight, CDW) were achieved with hydrolysates from pretreated macroalga, reaching values comparable to the highest reported in the literature. Hence, it can be concluded that hydrolysates obtained from algal biomass hydrothermally pretreated with acid have a concentration of sugars and a C/N ratio that favour PHB production.

However, overfishing and unsustainable practices have led to a decline in fish populations and the degradation of marine ecosystems. Moreover, fishing activities can contribute to climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) from fishing vessels and seafood transportation. To mitigate the environmental impacts of fishing activities, sustainable fishing practices must be implemented to minimize the negative impacts of fishing on the environment while maintaining the productivity and diversity of fish populations and ecosystems. These practices include using selective fishing gear, avoiding fishing in vulnerable habitats, implementing fishery management plans, and reducing the carbon footprint of the fishing industry. To this end, and as a first step in defining efficient and effective measures towards the sustainability of capture fishing activity, an analysis of the environmental sustainability of the Galician fishing sector, one of the main European regions in this field, is presented in this work. An ecosystem-based indicator (ecological footprint, calculated by adding the so-called fishing ground footprint and the carbon footprint) was employed to quantify the main impacts of capture fishing during extractive activity. The catch composition and fuel consumption of the fleet based on the vessels’ power, and economic benefits, were the parameters used in this analysis. The results showed that ports with larger vessels and fleets seem to be more eco-efficient than those concentrating smaller vessels in targeting lower trophic level species.

Installing cameras on buoys can effectively monitor and collect evidence from ships. However, when using a camera to capture images, it is often affected by the continuous shaking of buoys and rainy and foggy weather, resulting in problems such as blurred images and rain and fog occlusion. To address these problems, this paper proposes an improved YOLOv8 algorithm. Firstly, the polarized self-attention (PSA) mechanism is introduced to preserve the high-resolution features of the original deep convolutional neural network and solve the problem of image spatial resolution degradation caused by shaking. Secondly, by introducing the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism in the neck network, the interference of rain and fog background is weakened, and the feature fusion ability of the network is improved. Finally, in the head network, this model combines additional small object detection heads to improve the accuracy of small object detection. Additionally, to enhance the algorithm’s adaptability to camera detection scenarios, this paper simulates scenarios, including shaking blur, rain, and foggy conditions. In the end, numerous comparative experiments on a self-made dataset show that the algorithm proposed in this study achieved 94.2% mAP50 and 73.2% mAP50:95 in various complex environments, which is superior to other advanced object detection algorithms.

This study compares the ternary diagram method and employs the comprehensive concentration index (CCI), Lerner index (LI), and spatial shift-share analysis (SSSA) methods to delve into the intricacies of concentration, inequality, and evolving competitive dynamics within the Bohai Rim multi-port system over the four decades spanning from 1981 to 2023. The aim is to analyze the evolutionary trajectory and underlying dynamic mechanisms of this multipartite port system. The analysis delineates the development trajectory of the system into three stages: the dominant stage of Tianjin Port from 1981 to 1990, the efficiency competition stage from 1991 to 1996, and the ascendancy of Qingdao Port from 1997 to 2023. The results indicate that: (i) the Bohai Rim multi-port system exhibits a relatively low level of concentration, ensuring balanced growth within a non-monopolistic competitive environment; (ii) the internal competitiveness of the Bohai Rim multi-port system has gradually shifted from Tianjin Port to Qingdao Port, with Dalian Port experiencing steady development in its container transport capabilities. (iii) Dalian Port has witnessed a decline in container throughput since 2015, indicating a weakening competitive posture. These revelations suggest that Qingdao Port is a viable candidate for development into the northern China shipping center, leveraging its increasing competitiveness and strategic location. The method applied in this study may also prove beneficial for similar multi-port systems elsewhere.

In order to guarantee the rationality, efficacy, and credibility of the MASS autonomous collision avoidance scheme, it is essential to design the MASS autonomous collision avoidance algorithm under the stipulations of the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). In order to enhance the autonomous collision avoidance decision-making capability of MASS in accordance with the relevant provisions of COLREGs, an improved NSGA-II autonomous collision avoidance decision-making algorithm based on the good point set method (GPS-NSGA-II) is proposed, which incorporates the collision hazard and the path cost of collision avoidance actions. The experimental results in the four simulation scenarios of head-on situation, overtaking situation, crossing situation, and multi-ship encounter situation demonstrate that the MASS autonomous collision avoidance decision making based on the GPS-NSGA-II algorithm under the constraints of COLREGs is capable of providing an effective collision avoidance scheme that meets the requirements of COLREGs in common encounter situations and multi-ship avoidance scenarios promptly, with a promising future application.

This study analyzes the distribution pattern, morphological characteristics, and influencing factors of Zhejiang sandy beaches using statistical analysis, based on field data and historical records. Results show that the mean grain size distribution of Zhejiang sandy beaches ranges from fine sand to very coarse sand, and the beach slope and sediment grain size correspond well with the wave heights in the three regions of Zhejiang. The extent of beach headlands in central Zhejiang appeared the largest, suggesting an increased susceptibility to wave erosion due to the less sheltered headlands. Most sandy beaches in Zhejiang formed on the islands and the areas far from the estuaries, showing quantity difference in beach distribution. The comparison of the regional difference in Zhejiang sandy beaches shows that embayment is the main factor affecting the beach distribution pattern and morphological characteristics. The different embayment characteristics provide the space for beach formation and the interaction with the coastal process, the sediment supply, the nearshore hydrodynamic environment, and human intervention also have influence on the morphological characteristics of Zhejiang beaches.

However, due to weak correlation between adjacent multibeam sonar data and difficulties in inter-frame feature matching, the resulting underwater mapping accuracy frequently falls short of the desired level. To address this issue, this study presents the development of a multibeam data processing system, which includes functionalities for sonar parameter configuration, data storage, and point cloud conversion. Subsequently, an Iterative Extended Kalman Filter (iEKF) algorithm is employed for odometry estimation, facilitating the initial construction of the point cloud map. To further enhance mapping accuracy, we utilize the Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP) algorithm for point cloud registration, effectively merging point cloud data collected at different times from the same location. Finally, real-world lake experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) of 15.10 m and an average local point cloud registration error of 0.97 m. Furthermore, we conduct measurements on various types of artificial targets. The experimental results indicate that the average location error of the targets calculated by our method is 4.62 m, which meets the accuracy requirements for underwater target exploration.

To enhance the pursuit performance and facilitate strategic interaction during the target pursuit, this paper proposes a novel game theory-based maneuver planning method for pursuit ISVs. Firstly, a specific two-player zero-sum pursuit–evasion game (ZSPEG)-based target-pursuit model is formed. To ensure the vehicles reach a quick consensus, a target-guided relay-pursuit mechanism and the corresponding pursuit payoffs are designed. Meanwhile, under the fictitious play framework, the behavioral pattern and the strategies of the target could be fictitiously learned. Furthermore, mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (MNE) is employed to determine the motions for the vehicles, the value of which is the best response in the proposed ZSPEG model. Finally, simulations verify the effectiveness of the above methods in multi-ISV surface pursuit.

However, ocean data typically contain substantial amounts of noise, including outliers (incomplete data) and inherent measurement noise, which heightens the complexity of sensor deployment. Therefore, this study optimizes the sparse sensor placement model by establishing noise indicators, including small noise weight and large noise weight, which are measured by entropy to minimize the prediction bias. Building on this, a robust sparse sensor placement algorithm is proposed, which utilizes the block coordinate update (BCU) iteration method to solve the function. During the iterative updating process, the proposed algorithm simultaneously updates the selection matrix, reconstruction matrix, and noise matrix. This allows for effective identification and mitigation of noise in the data through evaluation. Consequently, the deployed sensors achieve superior reconstruction performance compared to other deployment methods that do not incorporate noise evaluation. Experiments are also conducted on datasets of sea surface temperature (SST) and global ocean salinity, which demonstrate that our strategy significantly outperforms several other considered methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy while enabling autonomous sensor deployment under noisy conditions.
