        "text": "[The plot is essentially that of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s original made for TV musical (see Musicals), though the multiracial cast and message, along with the shaping of a more independently minded Cinderella creates an altogether different effect from the Leslie Ann Warren and Stuart Damon version. Here the practical-minded princess asks for respect; the prince needs someone who will talk with him as a person, rather than as a “prince,” ergo, a good catch. Cinderella is African-American, the Prince is Philippine born, the fairy godmother, the queen, and one of the stepsisters are African-American, but the king is Caucasian, as is the prince’s valet. The sumptuous ballet scene is a melting pot, done in high style. The sets and costumes often evoke Edwardian taste, with touches of Klimt and Maxfield Parrish.]\n\nReviews\n\nJ. Max Robins, “A Happy Ending for a Musical Tale.” San Diego Cox Cable edition, TV Guide, 1 November 1997, pp. 53-54.\n\n[“The story behind the fairy tale is much more about Hollywood deal-making and maneuvering than it is about magic and make-believe. The project began with Houston, who, after seeing CBS’s 1993 production of Gypsy starring Bette Midler, got the idea for an African-American version of Cinderella in which the pop diva would play the title role. CBS signed on to the project as did Storyline Entertainment (one of the producers of Gypsy) and another company, Citadel Entertainment. There were the requisite press releases announcing the project, but year after year, nothing happened. When working with a superstar, constant delays are often part of the downside. ‘Whitney was committed to the project, but every time we were ready to begin production, there was a scheduling conflict,’ says Craig Zadan, a partner in Storyline and an executive producer of Cinderella. ‘Sometimes it was a recording session, and other times it was a film commitment. We’d be ready to go, and then she had the opportunity to do Waiting to Exhale or The Preacher’s Wife. Finally she decided she was getting too old to play Cinderella, and we were back to square one.’ It was sometime in the summer of 1996 when Houston, then 33 years old, made that decision. Still, neither she nor the producers wanted to let the project go. Zadan then had a brainstorm. Why not have Houston play Cinderella’s fairy godmother and tap Norwood, who was riding high on the pop charts and making her mark on the hot sitcom Moesha, for the title role? Norwood signed on, but the project was stalled again by more of the inevitable scheduling conflicts. The last round of delays and escalating costs of the project caused Citadel Entertainment, which was to pick up a big portion of the hefty price tag in return for such back-end rights as home-video and foreign sales, to back off…. With Citadel out, CBS decided to pass, unwilling to pay the full $12 million, a bill that would be three to four times what the average TV-movie costs. ‘I can’t blame CBS — they were honorable throughout the whole process,’ says Zadan…. At this point, it looked as if a Houston-Norwood Cinderella would never make it past the press-release stage. Houston was about to do another movie, and Storyline had struck a deal with Disney and was turning its attention to other projects. ‘Then out of the blue we got a call from Whitney, and she said her movie had fallen through, so there was a window of opportunity,’ says Zadan. ‘At that point we approached Disney, and they signed on for the full freight. “If [Disney] hadn’t stepped up, nobody would have…. Disney, with its powerful home-video division, was in a good position to recoup a portion of the costs and eventually make money on the project.”]\n\nEugene Marino, “Glass Act: Cinderella’s Shoe Fits Pop Singer Well on a TV Night as Crowded as a Prince’s Ball.” Rochester Democrat and Chronicle C Section Saturday, 1 November 1997.\n\n[The production “merits the buzz it has created. It’s livelier, funnier, more romantic, more musical and much better mounted than the oft-aired 1965 staging” (p. C1).]\n\n“Colorful twist on fairy tale.” Editorial Page, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, Tuesday, 4 November 1997.\n\n[The new version of Cinderella \"sent a powerful message to its audience, both young and old: that a good story knows no racial boundaries\" (p. 8A).]\n\nVeronica Chambers, \"The Myth of Cinderella.\" Newsweek, 3 November 1997, pp. 75-77.\n\n[“For generations black women have been the societal embodiment of Cinderella … relegated to the cooking and the cleaning, watching enviously as the women they worked for lived a more privileged life …. Finally, a sister is getting to go to the ball” (p. 75). Whoopi Goldberg loves the casting of this Cinderella “because Brandy is a beautiful, everyday-looking black girl” (p. 75). The multiracialism of the film has caused some controversy in the black community: “I’m genuinely bothered by the subliminal message that’s sent when you don’t have a black Prince Charming,” says Denene Millner, author of “The Sistahs’ Rules” (p. 75). But, according to Rita Dove, “there are a lot of women who feel that black men have done them wrong …. It’s also a way of taking charge and saying, ‘I’m waiting for Prince Charming, but the important thing is that he’s charming, not that he’s black’” (p. 75). According to bell hooks, “Most black women under the age of 30 would rather have a rich white man than a poor black man” (p. 77). “In the 1970s, many black women were reluctant to embrace feminism because it seemed that just when it was about to be their turn to be Cinderella, white women were telling them that the fantasy was all wrong. ‘I think there was always more ambivalence about the women’s movement on the part of some black women,’ says [Dr. Alvin] Poussaint. ‘It meant that they were losing out on their chance to be in this dependent role’” (p. 79). Virginia Hamilton’s \"Catskinella\" is akin to the new vision in Houston’s film: it is evidence, Hamilton says, that “when black women were at their most oppressed, they had the extraordinary imagination to create stories for themselves, about themselves: (p. 79). For bell hooks, Zora Neale Hurston’s “Their Eyes Were Watching God” is the best Cinderella story going: “Janie rejects her rich husband for Tea Cake, the laborer...Janie talks about how there is a jewel inside of her … Tea Cake sees that jewel, and he brings it out. which is very different from the traditional cinderella myth of the prince holding the jewel and you trying to get it from him” (p. 79).]\n\nLaura Shapiro, “When the Shoe Fits.” Newsweek, 3 November 1997, p. 77.\n\n[Houston originally planned the production with CBS, with herself cast as Cinderella. But CBS lost interest and Houston got older. Meanwhile her agents Mr. Zadan and Mr. Meron had moved to Disney and ABC, where the idea took hold again, but with different casting. Robert Freedman’s teleplay retains Hammerstein’s cockeyed optimism but with a post modern, Oprah-fied intouchness. According to Robert Iscove, the director, the project had been conceived as “multi-ethic from the very beginning” (p. 39). Bernadette Peters, whose “Falling in Love with Love” was at first opposed by Mary Rodgers, the composer’s daughter who herself is the composer of “Once Upon a Mattress,” was won over by the spin Peters put on it. She explained, “In fairy tale, you don’t draw with charcoal; you draw with Crayola” (p. 39). Jason Alexander agreed to the role of Lionel at a fraction of what he gets for a single episode of “Seinfeld,’ partly because “he covets the title role in the film version of Stephen Sondheim’s ‘Sweeney Todd,’ for which Mr. Zadan and Mr. Meron own the rights and in part, he says, because he wants musicals to have a future. ‘We’ve spent endless hours talking about what a pathetic crime it is that this form is so rarely done in film these days, and more often than not, not done well,’ Mr. Alexander said. ‘This is a big responsibility and a big opportunity. Because if Cinderella doesn’t work, if it doesn’t get ratings and isn’t successful, it’s going to clamp the lid down on this kind of work pretty hard’” (p. 39).]\n\nMargy Rochlin, “Fresh Princess.” TV Guide, 45, no. 44, 1 November 1997, pp. 20-31.\n\n[“The new script by Robert L. Freedman takes a modern tack on the ‘Cinderella’ story, making the Fairy Godmother something of a 1990s-style self-improvement motivational speaker — ‘Believe in yourself, Cinderella!’ But the story must end the way it always has — poor Cinderella finds happiness by marrying the fabulously wealthy prince and, we are led to believe, living happily ever after. It’s an old-fashioned message, but ‘Cinderella,’ like it or not, is an old-fashioned story” (p. 6).]\n\n[The British film explores nine love stories in the weeks approaching Christmas, portraying different types of love relationships. In its themes and variations, the plan bears a resemblance to Arthur Schnitzler’s La Ronde, with its ten actualizations of sexual encounters without love. In the extensive DVD commentary, Curtis admits to removing a tenth love story between the headmistress and her partner Geraldine in which the headmistress loses her partner to death. When approaching the individual narratives, it is useful to think of the film’s title as “Love Almost” since the stories assess love relationships that are threaded with loss, frustrated desire, and faulty envy. The individual stories (all set in London) overlap with characters from one story arcing into another to reveal the love circumstances of “normal people.” Given the fact that love can be seen almost randomly affecting people, whether salesclerks or airline passengers, Curtis uses an angel to assist the many disconnected characters. The narratives culminate on Christmas Eve at a local school Christmas panto, which brings many of the disconnected characters together. Although not an obvious Cinderella film, the narratives repeatedly contain aspects of the Cinderella story, with incomplete Cinderella plots, ugly stepsisters, godmothers, sexual encounters, conditional love, and almost-heroines all being partially actualized.\n\nA. John and Judy. This couple reveals the role of sex and its potential distancing affects on love. They meet when performing as body doubles on a film set by simulating multiple sex acts. Although they demonstrate a number of meaningless “intimate” acts, both are quite shy in their off-screen life, and John must work up the nerve to ask Judy out on a date. At the end of their evening together, he hesitates when wanting to kiss her, so she gently kisses him instead and indicates her affection for him. When the other characters return to the airport at the end of the film, John and Judy are leaving on a trip together. Judy reveals that she is wearing an engagement ring, and John tells a friend that he “might get a shag at last.” Although they appear to have a “happy ending,” it is unclear exactly what such commitment might mean.\n\nB. Billy Mack and his manager Joe. An aging rocker begins the film as a Cinderella figure, having lost his riches to battles with drug addiction. Billy and Joe attempt to reinvent the singer’s career by rereleasing a new version of one of his earlier hits in an attempt to achieve a Christmas number one. Billy must fight against several evil stepmother and stepsister figures as he faces criticism from DJs and a popular boyband, and his struggles mirror the competition usually seen among women for the chance to marry the Prince. On Christmas Eve, he receives an invitation to a party from Elton John, a type of Prince figure, and achieves his almost “happily ever after” by gaining a kind of recognition within the music industry for his number one hit song. At least, for the moment, it is what he thinks he “wants.”\n\nC. Jamie and Aurelia. This tale comes closest to actualizing a Cinderella plot. After Jamie discovers his girlfriend is having an affair with his brother, he retreats to France to write a crime novel. There he meets Aurelia, his maid, and becomes drawn to her as she looks after him. The couple overcomes a language barrier as Jamie only speaks English and Aurelia, Portuguese. Before Jamie returns to England, Aurelia kisses him goodbye, so he begins to study Portuguese; on Christmas Eve, he, like the Prince, travels to find Aurelia by seeking out her home. When he tells her father that he wishes to marry his daughter, the father assumes Jamie wants his other daughter, who functions as an ugly stepsister, with the film making several comments about her weight and attitude. Once the father, sister, and neighbors get his request straightened out, they escort Jamie to Aurelia’s job, where she works as a waitress. Jamie proposes to his Cinderella in extremely broken Portuguese. She accepts in English, and they return to England to begin their new life together.\n\nD. Daniel and Sam. When the film begins, Daniel has just lost his wife Joanna to a terminal disease. He worries about his stepson, Sam, who becomes more withdrawn, but unlike the typical Cinderella story, Daniel is not wicked stepparent. When he realizes that his son is in love with a classmate also named Joanna, he becomes a fairy godmother figure. He assists the boy in his attempts to court the girl and facilitates his son’s transformation into a drummer. At the school pageant, Sam fails to tell Joanna how he feels, so his father drives him to the airport in order that he can tell Joanna the truth before she flies home for the winter break. At the gate, Sam is assisted by an unnamed figure who also acts as a love angel by distracting security; Sam finds Joanna just as she is about to board her plane. She returns his feelings and gives him a kiss before he triumphantly returns to his father.\n\nE. Karen and Harry. This couple represents a ruined Cinderella story as their “happily ever after” ends with an extramarital affair. Karen and Harry’s marriage revolves around routines involving his job and her life with their two children. Harry’s receptionist takes advantage of this problem and begins to flirt with him. At the company Christmas party, a type of ball, she dances with Harry while wearing a red dress and small devil’s horns despite the everyday attire of the other guests. Her presence threatens Karen, making the seductress function as a fiendish stepsister figure. A few weeks later, the receptionist convinces Harry to buy her “something pretty” for Christmas while he is out shopping with his wife. When he first tries to purchase the necklace, the angel who helps Sam tries to delay him by taking too long to wrap the present in an effort to discourage Harry’s purchase since he fears Karen will discover the truth. Karen discovers the gold necklace in his coat pocket a few days later but returns it, thinking her husband means to surprise her at Christmas. When she receives a CD instead, she realizes what has happened and after her children’s school pageant confronts her husband. At the end of the film, the couple appears to be attempting to move beyond the affair, but the hurt is deep, and their reconciliation remains uncertain—their fairy tale can never again be complete.\n\nF. Colin and Three Girls from Wisconsin—a saturnalian fantasy. Colin represents an extremely sexual figure who considers himself to be a “God of Sex.” This would be “Prince” does not want wealth or a happy ending; instead, he needs promiscuous love aplenty. Unfortunately for him, his vulgar aggression turns women off. He decides that British women cannot understand him and rents out his flat; he becomes his own fairy godmother and flies to America with a backpack full of condoms, imagining that American women will be more receptive. He travels to a bar in Milwaukee where he meets Stacy, Jeannie, and Carol-Anne. They offer to let him stay with them but plead that due to their poverty they can only afford one bed and must sleep naked. Colin accepts their offer, and, as a fourth roommate, Harriet, approaches, all four figures undress and fall onto the bed with Colin presumably achieving a “happy ending.” Colin returns to London with Harriet and brings her sister Carla for his friend Tony.\n\nG. Mark and Juliet. Mark is a not-so-evil stepsister who watches his best friend, Peter, marry the woman Mark loves. Juliet serves as a Prince Charming figure when Mark distances himself from Peter and Juliet when trying to hide his inappropriate affection for his friend’s wife. After Juliet finds evidence of Mark’s affection, he arrives at the couple’s home with a series of posters and a radio playing carols. He uses the radio to deceive Peter, a Cinderella character in his own right, into thinking that carolers are at the door for him, while Mark uses the posters to tell Juliet of his true feelings and his plans to move past them and find someone else. As he leaves, Juliet comes out and gives him a single kiss as a way to recognize his confession but uses a passionate look to indicate that she cannot return his feelings, then returns to her husband.\n\nH. Sarah and Karl. This couple represents an aborted Cinderella story. For over two years, Sarah, a quiet and deserving Cinderella, has been in love with Karl, the handsome Prince, but has not told him of her feelings. Her boss, Harry, becomes impatient with her and acts as a fairy godmother by telling her to express herself because everyone, including Karl, can see how she feels. At the ball-like Christmas party, Sarah and Karl dance, and their attraction grows. They go to her apartment and begin to undress each other when her phone rings. Her mentally ill brother calls her and is clearly in the midst of a bad attack. She addresses his concerns and ends the phone call before hesitantly telling Karl about her brother’s condition. At first, Karl claims to accept the situation and Sarah, but as they begin kissing, her phone rings again, and Karl asks her to choose him over her brother. Sarah immediately rejects Karl, ends their encounter, and leaves to spend time with her brother. A few days later, Sarah sees Karl at the office, and their conversation is brief and awkward, suggesting that any potential happy ending has been lost.\n\nI. David and Natalie. This couple represents a typical modern Cinderella story where a working class woman becomes involved with a powerful leader. When David begins to serve as Prime Minister, he meets Natalie who brings him cookies and tea. He soon becomes attracted to her cheerful personality, and she returns his affections. A visit from the U.S. President, however, nearly destroys the relationship. When the president attempts to seduce Natalie, David’s jealously grows, and he resists the demands of his fellow diplomat and orders his assistant, Annie, to transfer Natalie to another office. On Christmas Eve, Annie provides David with Christmas cards from his staff, including Natalie, making the assistant a fairy godmother figure. David reads Natalie’s card, realizes she cares for him, and sees the card as a sign that she wants him to find her again. The card acts as a paper slipper, and this Prince quickly tries to find Natalie’s home only to remember that she lives on “the dodgy end” of Wadsworth Street by Harris Street. David begins going door to door in an effort to find Natalie and, after many attempts, arrives at her door just as her family, running late, leaves for the Christmas pageant. During the ride there, Natalie confesses her feelings, and David proves his acceptance of her life by hiding backstage to watch the performance with her. They are caught kissing by the pageant’s audience, but at the end of the film, they kiss in a public announcement to the world of their relationship and yearned for happiness.] [Annotation by Martha Johnson-Olin]"
