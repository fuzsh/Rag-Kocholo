        "text": "This thread has been super fun to read so far. I haven’t seen nearly as many movies as you guys have, so it’s interesting to see what all of your picks for the past years of the Oscars would have been. I’m going to join in right at the end with my picks for the 92nd Academy Awards ceremony, since 2019 was the first year in which I saw enough movies to do this. I’m also going to pull a 93rd Academy Awards and extend the eligibility period into March of 2020, so I can include the few films I saw in the beginning of 2020 and fill in the gaps of this list. Also these will only be the main categories, since I don’t watch many documentaries or short films (though from what I’ve seen I do think Free Solo and Hair Love deserved their wins).\n\nWinners will be in bold and noms that the Oscars didn’t choose will be italicized.\n\nBest Picture\n\nAvengers Endgame\n\nFord v Ferrari\n\nJoker\n\nJojo Rabbit\n\nLittle Women\n\nMarriage Story\n\nParasite\n\nUncut Gems\n\nBest Director\n\nAnthony and Joe Russo-Avengers Endgame\n\nBenny and Josh Safdie-Uncut Gems\n\nBong-Joon Ho-Parasite\n\nGreta Gerwig-Little Women\n\nTaika Waititi-Jojo Rabbit\n\nBest Actor\n\nAdam Driver-Marriage Story\n\nAdam Sandler-Uncut Gems\n\nChristian Bale-Ford v Ferrari\n\nJoaquin Phoenix-Joker\n\nRobert Pattinson-The Lighthouse\n\nBest Actress\n\nAna De Armas-Knives Out\n\nLupita Nyong’o-Us\n\nScarlett Johansson-Marriage Story\n\nSaoirse Ronan-Little Women\n\nTaylor Swift-Miss Americana\n\n(I know Taylor Swift was a weird choice. I threw her in partially because I saw very few films in 2019 with female leads [it was either her or Brie Larson in Captain Marvel, LOL], but I also genuinely thin Taylor did a great job, Yes, it’s just a documentary, but she had some seriously emotional moments that caught me off guard and a great on-screen presence, as always.

Also, since I decided to make all the Oscar ceremonies represent a single year now, every Oscar ceremony is now a number up in this alternate timeline. For example, the 50th Oscars are now the 51st Oscars and so on and so forth.\n\n12th Oscars (1938)\n\nOutstanding Production\n\n• Pygmalion – Gabriel Pascal for Pascal Film Productions\n\n• The Adventures of Robin Hood – Hal B.
