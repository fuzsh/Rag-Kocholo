Written for the U.S. Air Force Band, this virtuosic transcription begins with quiet opening depicting a magical moonlit night which leads to an extended fast section. This allegro vivace is in turn delicate, exciting, beautiful, and virtuosic.\n\n- Program Note from publisher\n\nThe Merry Wives of Windsor (in German: Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor) is an opera in three acts by Otto Nicolai to a German libretto by Salomon Hermann Mosenthal based on the play The Merry Wives of Windsor by William Shakespeare.\n\nThe opera is a Singspiel, containing much spoken dialogue between distinct musical numbers. The opera remains popular in Germany, and the overture is sometimes heard in concert in other countries. Otto Nicolai composed the music from 1845 to 1849. He had previously achieved great success with a few Italian operas, but this opera was to become his masterpiece in the German language. The composer himself made some changes to the libretto.\n\n- Program Note from Wikipedia\n\nMedia\n\nAudio: Reference recording.
