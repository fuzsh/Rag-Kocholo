For once, Lou Costello, the short, roly-poly member of the team, won't argue with his pal. Lou has felt the same way for as long as he can re¬ member, even in the days when he was only a laborer at the studio where he now is a comedy star. Abbott was reared in show business. His father was Harry Abbott, advance man for Barnum and Bailey circus, his mother was Ray Abbott, star bareback rider. Bud was born in Atlantic City on Oct. 2, just as the show was preparing to go into winter guarters. Later, his father launched a chain of bur- lesgue theaters, and Bud worked in the box office, gradually drifting from that into a comedy turn on the stage. Costello's theatrical background was not so foreordained. He was born Louis Francis Cristello, in Paterson, N. J., on March 6. His father, Sebastion Cristello, was a naturalized Italian engaged in the prosaic insurance busi¬ ness. His mother, Helene, was an Irish non- professional. It wasn't until Lou completed high school in Paterson and journeyed to Hollywood that he became mixed up in show business. He landed a job on the labor gang at Warner Brothers. A short time later, he moved over to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, in the same capacity. Finally he met Helene Costello, daughter of the screen idol of his kid days, Maurice Cos¬ tello, and through her went to work as a stunt man. He also changed his name to Cos¬ tello in tribute to his cinema hero. Hired to double for Dolores Del Rio — of all persons — in Trail of '98, he made a leap from the second-story window of a burning building. On leaving the hospital, he caught a wildcat bus aiming in the general direction of Brooklyn. But the driver left him behind in St. Joseph, Mo., broke and decidedly dis¬ couraged. A burlesque troupe landed in town a few days later, offering Lou his long-sought oppor¬ tunity. He was 1 soon traveling on burlesque wheels, earning $45 a week. Two years later Abbott and Costello, as separate acts, chanced to be booked on the same bill at a Brooklyn theater. ''Why don't you guys spot your acts to¬ gether,\" the manager casually suggested. They tried it out at a matinee performance, and by the night performance they were a hit. Since that day they have never been sep¬ arated in their careers as actors. Abbott and Costello, as a team, continued to wow burlesque audiences for seven years. Then, in 1938, they appeared on Kate Smith's radio program. \"I'm a ba-ad boy,\" a phrase that Lou had written 100 times on a black¬ board years before as a school punishment, became a byword of American radio listeners. In 1939, they starred for the first time on Broadway in Streets of Paris, and a year later they were on the screen in Hollywood. Their first picture was One Night In the Tropics, followed swiftly by their initial star¬ ring film, Buck Privates. In 1942, they made their first picture for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the studio where Cos¬ tello last had worked as a laborer. It was Rio Rita, and came in the same year that they were named the number one boxoffice attrac¬ tion in motion pictures. Their latest picture, Lost In a Harem, marks their most elaborate film musical comedy to date. LIFELINES Bud Abbott, born William Abbott, Atlan¬ tic City, N.

[5] J>juud thicuM THERE'S nothing slow about them now. But it was with dragging leet that, as a tow-headed urchin of four, Fred Astaire went reluct¬ antly to dancing school in Omaha, Neb., his nimble sis¬ ter two' jumps and a year and a half ahead of him. Kidlike, he \"just tagged along.\" Dancing meant nothing in his young life, and he wanted none of it. But one day the teacher coaxed him out on the floor to try some steps. Progress was rapid, though by no means smooth. Within a year both Fred and his sis¬ ter Adele were stepping at such a lively gait that their mother, bent on a stage career for her talented offspring, took them to New York. Fred was five when the two of them made their first vaudeville appearance in Paterson, N. J. There were other scattered \"dates\" in the same region. Fred was eleven when he and Adele made their New York debut, destined to be a de¬ bacle, at Proctor's Fifth Avenue Theater. But there was no keeping good feet down. Practice kept up unflaggingly for six months. Once again the hopeful pair gave it a try, this time with a new \"act\" of singing and dancing. All went well enough at the old Union Square Theater in Fourteenth street, where Will Rogers first spun jokes with his rope. For six years or more the young people, accompanied by their mother, toured the coun¬ try in vaudeville. Fred had reached the age of seventeen when the Astaires, as they came fondly to be known, made their initial appearance in a Broadway production. It was Over the Top, with Ed Wynn and Justine Johnson. They never returned to vaudeville. By that time they had brought to their in¬ spired dancing a youthful freshness and gaiety. They were the first to let humor slip, almost slyly, into their dances. The Astaires danced together for twenty- six years. The magic spell of their dancing was broken when they went to London in The Band Wagon and Adele retired from the stage in 1930 to marry Lord Charles Arthur Cavendish, whose death occurred in March of 1944. Dancing Lady was Astaire's first film. After its preview he returned to Broadway to again appear in The Gay Divorcee on the stage. His next screen venture was Flying Down To Rio. When it was released he was hailed as a new picture star, and was soon back before the cameras again in Hollywood. The screen rights of his stage success The Gay Divorcee were purchased as his next film vehicle, and its phenomenal success launched Astaire in a string of hit pictures, including Roberta, Top Hat, Follow The Fleet, Swingtime, Shall We Dance, Carefree, Damsel In Distress, The Castles and Broadway Melody of 1940. Fred Astaire's dancing partners in motion pictures have included Joan Crawford, Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell, Rita Hayworth, Paul¬ ette Goddard, Marjorie Reynolds, Joan Leslie, and Lucille Bremer. By this time Astaire was firmly entrenched as the screen's greatest filmusical and dance star. He further clinched this honor with such remembered films as Second Chorus, You 11 Never Get Rich, Holiday Inn. The Sky's The Limit, and gathers new laurels in the greatest of all his film vehicles to date, Zieg feld Follies. Astaire lives in a Beverly Hills home with his wife and three children, Peter, Fred, Jr., and Phyllis Ava. Golf is his chief recreation and he also writes songs, plays the piano, clarinet and accordion. LIFELINES Born, Fred Austerlitz, May 10, in Omaha, Neb.; educated, Highwood Park, N.

[6] Jjicilh Salt HER triple assets as a fine act¬ ress, a rare Ti¬ tian beauty and the possession of a per¬ sonality plus have rocketed Lucille Ball to a solid and deserv¬ ing screen stardom. While her rise has been speedy in Hol¬ lywood, it was not always so. She came up the hard way, via the Broadway stage and modelling, and after breasting a series of misfortunes that would have deterred one less hardy and courageous. Born in Butte, Montana, on August 8, she spent her childhood in Jamestown, N. Y. Her mother, a concert pianist, enrolled her in the Chautauqua Institute of Music for two seasons. Later, Lucille entered the John Mur¬ ray Anderson Dramatic School in New York. After a year, her teacher admitted that Lucille was wasting her money. Lucille went job hunting. She found one with Florenz Ziegfeld's Rio Rita, in the third roadshow. After three weeks of rehearsal she was dismissed. For a while, Lucille jerked sodas. Next came a chance to model for a wholesale house at $25 a week. This led to an excellent opportunity with Hattie Carnegie. Lucille stayed with the famous designer five years and became one of the top models of the country. An auto¬ mobile accident almost ended Lucille's career and life. The doctors said she would recover, but never walk again. After three gruelling years of perseverance, grit, and unending patience, she again went back to modelling. As \"The Chesterfield Girl\" of magazine ads and bill boards she was discovered by Holly¬ wood and offered a showgirl role in Eddie Cantor's Roman Scandals. A Columbia contract followed her screen debut and she sent for her mother, grand¬ father and sister. The morning following her wire to them, Columbia's stock company was dissolved. By the time her family arrived Lucille had a job as an extra at Paramount. A role in Robeita proved a turning point. She was awarded an RKO contract. Lucille was the mainstay of the studio Little Theater. She did everything from playing leads to small bits. The second lead in one of her first big pictures. The Girl From Paris, won her another chance at Broadway in Hey, Diddle, Diddle. She returned to Hollywood for Stage Door, and Too Many Girls. In the latter she co- starred with Desi Arnaz, Cuban heartbreaker. And on November 30 of that same year, 1940, they were married at Greenwich, Connecticut. In her seven years at RKO she made twenty-five pictures, even a western. Then on her birthday in 1942, she signed a long¬ term contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Her first picture under that deal was also her initial bow in Technicolor. With Red Skelton, Lucille appeared in Du Barry Was a Lady. Two other successful stellar roles followed in Best Foot Forward and Meet The People. She is 5 feet, 6 inches tall, weighs 120 pounds, has blue eyes, freckles, china white skin, and strawberry red hair. She insists on washing her own stockings, loves feathers, fussy negligees, small hats, slacks, steak, raw onions, frilly night gowns, never wears white, believes Hedy Lamarr the most glamorous star, Bette Davis the best actress. She also likes blue, flowered wallpaper, old china, knitting, chickens, her three cocker spaniels, three-inch heels, oversized handbags and she sleeps in a bed 7x7 feet!

[7] <£wmi ScuuupywM HOLLYWOO D. like Broadway and the nation at large, regards with affection what is known as the Barry¬ more tradition. It is the essence of all that is the theater. The tradition has been ably maintained by Lionel Barrymore, the dean of stars, since the death of his younger brother John. Their sister Ethel keeps it perennially alive in the theater. This shaggy-browed son of Maurice Barry¬ more and Georgia Drew is probably the only actor in the world who can dare to play any part in a story and make it a starring role. Lionel Barrymore was bom in Philadelphia, April 28, 1878. He first breathed the air of a fine old Quaker City home, although it was permeated with the atmosphere of the theater, naturally. He made his stage debut at 5 with his illustrious parents. Aside from his abiding devotion to his pro¬ fession, Barrymore is versatile in other fields. His etchings rank him among the foremost artists of the day and he is a music composer of considerable note. He has been an illus¬ trator and also a motion picture director. He was educated in New York and by private tutors, attending Seton Hall, at Orange, N. J., where he came to know Thomas A. Edison, who lived in the town. At 18, young Barrymore appeared on the stage with his grandmother, Louisa Drew, but quit to study art in Paris. Returning, he was an illustrator for a year, then joined his brother John in Du Maurier's Peter Ibbetson. There never was any question of his forte. He became a star with his performance in The Copperhead. Following in The Claw, he appeared with Irene Fenwick, formerly of musical comedy. They were together again in Laugh, Clown, Laugh, marrying on July 14, 1923. Their romance until her death in 1936, was one of the most ideal in the profession. They starred together in Taps on Broadway. In 1926 he joined the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer organization to star in The Barrier. When sound came to the screen Barrymore turned to directing. He triumphed with Confession, then later he moved a microphone for the first time. He later directed The Rogue Song, with Lawrence Tibbett. Ten Cents a Dance, with Barbara Stanwyck, then returned to acting in Madame X, starring Ruth Chatterton. In A Free Soul, with Norma Shearer, he won an Academy Award. Since then he has starred in scores of pictures. Barrymore has been the recipient of singular honors. In 1928 he was awarded the Speech Arts Medal. Every year he broadcasts the role of Scrooge in A Christmas Carol. He is a member of the Society of American Etchers. Barrymore is six feet tall, with penetrating steel blue eyes beneath shaggy white brows. His once brown hair is white now, a pictur¬ esque mane familiar to millions. He lives in San Fernando Valley, where he raises a variety of flowers, specializing in roses. He also grows Indian corn and breeds razorback hogs, paints and writes music.

His older brother, William, finished school and joined the Forepaugh-Sells circus. Noah, the second brother, left the seventh grade to brave New York for a job in musical comedy. Wallace, known then as Jumbo, due to his size, ran away as a fourth-grade school boy, \"bumming\" his way to Mobile. When he returned he persuaded his father to get him a job in a roundhouse. After six months of it he sought a tougher job as a riveter. That kept him too much in one place, so young Beery joined the Ringling circus as an elephant tender. For several years he worked at that odd calling, then joined his brother Noah, in New York. To this day, Beery occasionally breaks into song, usually in comparative seclusion. It might be the result of his first job in the theater in the chorus of Henry W. Savage's Babes In Toyland. That was in 1904. In those days he sang all right, because he went on in The Balkan Princess, The Prince of Pilsen, and The Student Prince. The theater held him until 1913 when he joined the old Essanay Film Company in Chicago. His success led him to form his own com¬ pany which he took to Japan to film pictures. Returning to Hollywood, wiser but not the least disillusioned, Beery became a free-lance actor and appeared in many notable pictures includ¬ ing The Four Horsemen and Behind the Door. In this period he married Gloria Swanson, from whom he was subsequently divorced. He married Rita Gilman, of Roanoke, Va., in 1924, and in 1931 they adopted Carol Ann, nine months old daughter of her cousin, who made her screen bow with Beery in Rationing. In a series of comedies with Raymond Hat¬ ton, Beery appeared in a picture called Now We're in the Air, which awakened his interest in aviation. He became an accomplished pilot and in 1940 acquired his ninth plane with 7,000 flying hours on his log. The world still remembers Beery’s teaming with the late Marie Dressier in 1930, in Min and Bill. A year later he won the Academy Award for The Champ, for Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer. He received the Italian award for his characterization in Viva Villa, in 1934. He owns a ranch in the famous Jackson Hole country in Wyoming, where he hunts and fishes. He has another in Idaho, both with landing fields. Until the war he commuted from Hollywood by air for his out-of-door activ¬ ity with gun and rod. Beery holds the rank of Lieutenant Commander in the U. S. Naval Air Force Reserve, and is an officer of the Califor¬ nia Aero Patrol. He and Rita Gilman were divorced in 1939. Beery is six feet, one inch in height, weighs 225 pounds and his hair a sandy brown, only lightly touched with gray.

[9] <£cUiaim (Day TH E Ute Indians held a great pow¬ wow when La- raine Day was born. They had long known of the White Man's miracles, but this was one of especial sig¬ nificance, for here was a white papoose side by side with an¬ other in duplicate. Twins were a rare sight to the Utes, and there was much rejoicing. The scene was in Roosevelt, Utah. The new¬ comers, euphoniously named Laraine and La¬ mar, were the son and daughter of Clarence Irwin and Ada M. Johnson. The father was a grain dealer who for 20 years had served as government interpreter for the Utes. The day was Octqber 13th. Until she was nine years old, Laraine mingled with the Indians, learned to ride bare- back, rope calves, and be stoical when she was hurt. The family moved by truck to Rialto, Calif. Lacking Indians, the Johnson kids collected turkey feathers, stained themselves with berry juice and played Indian. There were five of them including the double portion. Rialto was fun, too. Then they moved to Long Beach. Laraine was ten. Almost at once she attracted the attention of the late Elias Day, an accomplished dra¬ matic coach. It was he who trained her and his name was the one she chose to use when at last she began her professional career in pictures at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1939. While a student with Day she also attended Long Beach High School and became a mem¬ ber of the Little Theater Guild there. At thirteen she went on tour with the Guild production of Conflict. She played at Salt Lake City where friends from Roosevelt came in to see her. Two years later she had a screen test in Hollywood, but nothing came of it. Another one followed and she signed a contract with Sam Goldwyn. She traveled to the studio from Long Beach by bus, dragging herself from bed in the dawn to get there on time. Next she joined Paramount and appeared in her first picture, Scandal Sheet, with Lew Ayres. Her subsequent roles in Border G-Men. Painted Desert and Arizona Legion, with George O'Brien, put her back in the saddle, but only temporarily. In 1939, she appeared in the Long Beach Little Theater play. Lost Horizon. A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer executive observed her and a contract followed. She played the ingenue in I Take This Woman, with Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr. There has been no interval of inactivity. Miss Day not only acts, but writes, directs and produces plays for the Wilshire Players Guild. She has the reputation of being a hard taskmaster, but understanding. She clings to old friends. By nature she is reserved, a quality which sometimes causes strangers to regard her as aloof. She isn't. Her favorite recreations are dancing, bicycling, and arranging extraordinary parties. Laraine's grandfather, Charles C. Rich, was sent to California by Brigham Young to found a colony. He acquired a tract of land and started a settlement in what is now San Bernardino. Miss Day lives in Westwood, Los Angeles residential section. She was married May 6, 1942, to Ray Hendricks, instructor in aviation at Felson Field, Arizona. Her father is her frequent visitor, but his duties as government agent keep him with the Utes most of the time. They still inquire about the twins. She is regarded as one of Hollywood's most beautiful actresses. Her eyes are unusually deep blue and her hair is light brown. Her lithe carriage is the product of early training. Also, she can ride any bronc that she has seen in Hollywood. _ _ LIFELINES Born, Laraine Johnson, at Roosevelt, Utah, Oct. 13, daughter of Clarence Irwin and Ada M. Johnson.

[10] 9 TLoud&m (DisdUiixJi America, addict¬ ed to slogans and phrases, coined the term “Gla¬ mour Girl,\" for Mar¬ lene Dietrich, when she first came to this country in 1931. With emphasis on feminine charm, a perfect fig¬ ure, red gold hair, and big blue eyes, she consistently has justified her title. The motion picture, Morocco, introduced Marlene Dietrich to American audiences, and started a vogue of Dietrich films, among the most recent of which is Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer's Kismet, starring Ronald Colman, and featuring Marlene as Queen of the Bagdad dancers. As such she is garbed in a sheer black chiffon and gold costume revealing her famous legs glittering with gold paint. A very different Marlene is the Dietrich of the Hollywood Canteen, the Government hos¬ pitals for war wounded, the weekly broad¬ casts in six different languages sending en¬ couragement to countries under the Axis heel, the proud, naturalized American citizen whose dream is to return to Europe after the war to aid in its rehabilitation, because she has known what it is to be hungry and the victim of war, and because she loves children. Dietrich was born on a Dec. 27. Her early years were filled with the spectacle of march¬ ing soldiers and pervaded with the tradition of military aristocracy. Her father, Edouard von Losch, was a Prussian first lieutenant in a patrician Regiment of Grenadiers. He was killed on the Russian front in the first world war. The feudal-like existence, the slow tempo of life was over for Marlene. Her mother placed her in a boarding school in Weimar, where she showed a marked apti¬ tude for music and later enrolled as a violin student. She made great progress, then one of those fateful things happened; she injured her wrist and all the dreams of a musical career, were gone forever. She turned to the stage — a rather unusual move for a girl of her background in those days. Under the name by which the world now knows her, she enrolled as a pupil of the late Max Reinhardt. Her first appearance under his guidance was in a minor role in The Taming of the Shrew. She alternated ap¬ pearances between Berlin and Vienna, ap¬ pearing in six different theaters. The UFA company was making pictures in Berlin, and she obtained several bit parts. Her marriage to Rudolph Sieber, an assistant director, now a film company executive in New York, took place at this time. Returning to the stage, she was a hit in The Great Baritone, and continued in other parts until the birth of her daughter, Maria, in 1925. Resuming her career a year later, she played a second lead in a musical com¬ edy, It's In the Air, Josef von Sternberg saw her and was struck with the idea of bringing her to America. Her first talking picture. The Blue Angel, established her reputation through¬ out the world and brought the still celebrated Dietrich legs their fame. Dietrich is always learning something — a new language, how to jitterbug, a new recipe, magic tricks; her interest never flags. She fairly sparks ideas: \"Glamour is assurance — the feeling, and knowing that you look right, are acting correctly and have overcome all your inner fears.\" On clothing: \"You don't save money by buying cheap clothing; one good dress that retains its shape, its rightness, is better than six cheaply made dresses — and costs less.\" On living: \"Do not empty your¬ self — save some of yourself for other occa¬ sions, other times.\" LIFELINES Born Dec. 27 in Berlin, Germany. Her parents were non-professional, her step¬ father, Edouard von Losch a military man; educated in Weimar and private schools; studied drama under Max Reinhardt.

[11] ftobstidt (Domed THE artistry that won for Robert Donat, an English actor, the Motion Pic¬ ture Academy Award in 1940, was inspired o r i g i n a 1 1 y by the American Western star, William S. Hart. The slight, retiring boy was fired by the famous two-gun man of the screen to take lofty aim and he hit the target unerringly. Presently, Donat appeared in The Private Life of Henry VIII, with Charles Laughton, which caused Hollywood to regard him with new interest. Then he played The Sleeping Clergy¬ man at the London Piccadilly Theater for seven months and Korda informed him that Holly¬ wood was bidding. He made the voyage and starred in The Count of Monte Cristo, which is still remem¬ bered. Returning to England he resumed his film career in Thirty-Nine Steps and James Hilton's Knight Without Armor, with Marlene Dietrich, then took a six months leave of ab¬ sence to regain his health. Donat proved his merit many times, but he won his crowning fame in Goodbye, Mr. Chips, in which he progressed from youth to age with astonishing realism. That picture, adapted from the book by James Hilton and produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in England, estab¬ lished Donat as a star of foremost rank. He was born in Withington, Manchester, England, on March 18, the son of Ernst and Rose Donat. Never endowed with great health, the boy was studious, but he reveled in pic¬ tures, especially Hart Westerns. A recitation of \"A Christmas Carol\" by James Bernard impressed him so deeply that he was permitted to join Bernard's dramatic class. Bernard later arranged an interview for him with Sir Frank Benson, the distin¬ guished actor-manager. Young Donat received his initial professional opportunity with Henry Baynton, Shakespearean actor, in Julius Cae¬ sar, at Birmingham in 1921. Prior to that he worked unhappily as a private secretary. The lure of the theater became so compelling that in 1923 Donat accompanied Benson on a five-year theatrical tour of England. He next joined a repertory company in Liverpool and married Ella Annesly Voysey, whom he knew in Withington as a dance teacher. They encountered failure when they first appeared in London in Knave and Queen, with Mary Ellis. For a time he became an instruc¬ tor of drama at the Royal Academy. He be¬ came known as ''Screen Test\" Donat in the film industry in London, due to his numerous efforts to get into pictures. Alexander Korda finally signed him for a role in Men of To¬ morrow, and he followed in That Night In London and Cash. He continued stage appearances in Shaw's St. Joan, and The Unknown Warrior, appearing also in Malvern Theater repertory. The pace was hard, for his health was never the best. His next assignment was in Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer's The Citadel, under a long-term con¬ tract. His second was the unforgettable Goodbye, Mr. Chips, filmed at Denham, with Greer Garson. The war halted his plans to appear in other pictures. He quit his country home in the Chiltern Hills to tour the provinces in Shaw's The Devil's Disciple, which he later took to London. He continued to devote him¬ self exclusively to wartime entertainment in his own country, declining to go back to Hol¬ lywood at least for the duration. Donat is six feet tall, weighs 165 pounds and is soft-spoken and humorous. He is forced to guard his health, but he walks and rides frequently. He is a reader of wide choice, pe¬ culiarly tolerant, due perhaps to his own en¬ counters with a critical world.

[12] (BhJuan (Donhvij, B' (RIAN DONLEVY, 'the big, mild- mannered Irish¬ man who first became outstanding in screen \"tough guy\" roles, has opened a new set of books on his career by signing a four-pic¬ ture contract with Me- fk tro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Brian, who has the broadest shoulders in Hollywood and looks like a highly cultured pugilist, has had varied experiences befitting a personality that is typically an Irish combination of fighter, mys¬ tic, advocate, slugger and peacemaker. As a mere schoolboy, but big for his age, he served as a bugler with General Pershing on the Mexican punitive expedition; then, not yet 15, became a sergeant-pilot in World War I. He wrote poetry, and still does. Brian was born, February 9, in Portadown, County Armagh, Ireland. His parents brought him to this country when he was 10 months old. His father, formerly in the wool business, died in 1923. His mother lives in Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin. Brian went to school there, at Beaver Dam, in Cleveland, St. John's Mili¬ tary Academy in Delafield, Wisconsin, and then won an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. He wanted to fly, but because he had to do four years of sea duty beforehand he resigned. Leyendecker, famous magazine cover and poster artist, posed him for collar and cigar¬ ette advertisements — and that's where you saw that face before. He told the artist he wanted to go on the stage, and Leyendecker suggested he join the Green Room Club where he would meet theatrical people. This worked; the late Louis Wolheim cast him in What Price Glory as the corporal. He was on Broadway for twelve years, in comedies, farces, musicals and dramas — Rain¬ bow, Queen Bee, Up Pops the Devil, Hit the Deck, Three Corner Moon, and The Milky Way. His first Hollywood role was in Barbary Coast, as the black-shirted killer. Starred in M-GM's America, directed by King Vidor, Don- levy is doing his fortieth picture since coming to the screen seven years ago. Donlevy admits he believes in \"fate\" and breaks.\" But for a \"break,\" he says, he wouldn’t be alive today. He was wounded twice in World War I, once in the head and once in the leg. When he was hit in the head, he passed out, and his plane wobbled earthward. As it neared the ground, he managed, groggily, to miss a building and set it down. He was badly in need of first aid, but everything turned out all right. The building toward which he had drifted was a hospital. Donlevy has an extraordinary constitution. He weighs 190 pounds, and is nearly six feet tall, but because of his barrel chest doesn't look it. He was large even as a schoolboy, and it was this that caused other boys to wonder when he began to write poetry. He had several fist fights to decide the question of whether or not a big boy who writes poetry is, perforce, a sissy. The boys also discovered his middle name is Waldo, and that, too, caused some fights. These taunts must have had effect on him, for when he was far under age he decided to do the most masculine thing he could think of, be a soldier. He joined a Wisconsin National Guard company as bugler — - and that's how he got to go to Mexico with Gen¬ eral Pershing. Later, rounding out his military career, he joined the Lafayette Escadrille, spent three years in pursuit duty. Donlevy is married to Marjorie Lane and they have a new daughter, Judith Ann.

He was supervisor of steamships for the United States Government. He passed the greater part of each winter in Washington, D. C., during Con¬ gressional sessions. His letters home to Irene, her younger brother Charles, and their mother, were highlights in their lives. Miss Dunne still has many of these letters. Her home in Louisville, Kentucky, where she was born on December 20, was one of charm and gayety. In direct contrast to her dark¬ haired dynamic dad, was her gentle, fair, and very pretty mother. homes, one in New York, where the doctor had his main practice, and the other in Holly¬ wood, where Miss Dunne pursued her career. In 1936 they adopted a little girl, Mary Fran¬ ces, but whom they call \"Missy.\" Today, the three are together in Hollywood, in a roomy, liveable home in Holmby Hills. Five-feet-five inches tall, weighing 115 pounds. Miss Dunne has warm grey eyes, long slim hands that have a delicate musical touch *yet can hit a golf ball as far as the average male player, and red-gold hair. Devoted to music, she has not missed a daily singing lesson since childhood. Next to music, she prefers reading. Shaw, Barrie and Coward share her favor with good biographies. Partial to cooking, her specialty is apple pie and doughnuts, both from her mother's recipes. A great lover of perfume, she often blends her own, adores cookies and milk in a be- tween-meal snack, with chicken a la king a favorite dish. She also likes white satin eve¬ ning clothes, golf and dancing. Her pet peeves? Her mother, an accomplished pianist, taught her to play the piano. When she was ten, she entered the Loretto Convent at St. Louis. From the convent, she en¬ rolled in the Chicago Musical College from which she graduated with honors. As a child. Miss Dunne thought she would become a nun. Then she decided she wanted to teach. While on her way to teach school in East Chicago she entered a voice contest at the Chicago Musical College. She won the contest and left for New York. Within a short time was singing leads in Clinging Vine, Sweetheart Time, and other Broadway shows. Then Florenz Ziegfeld no¬ ticed the fair-skinned Titian-haired beauty with the golden voice. He gave her the star role in Showboat, and a film contract followed. In Hollywood, she became a star overnight with her memorable characterization of Sabra in Cimarron. From then on, Irene Dunne's name sparkled on theater marquees in such hits as Roberta, The Magnificent Obsession, Theodora Goes Wild, The Awful Truth, Love Affair, Penny Serenade, and dozens of others. Under a new long term M-G-M contract, she played her first role there opposite Spencer Tracy in A Guy Named Joe, with The White Cliffs of Dover, following.

[14] Qjuudjuj. 'CjcUiLand THE only time that Judy Garland ever made an in¬ glorious exit from the stage, her father car¬ ried her kicking and squalling into the wings. She wanted more of the spotlight even then, at three, and she's been get- t i n g it consistently and increasingly since those days. The stage has always been home to her. Even through what is known as the awkward age she carried on in pictures without pause. In Hollywood she is regarded as a typical example of American girlhood, 1944 model. She was born Frances Gumm, daughter of Frank A. and Ethel Gumm, both of the theater, on June 10, in Grand Rapids, Minn. It was on the stage there that she sang Jingle Bells as a Christmas week added attraction, pre¬ pared to repeat it at the clap of a hand, but her father packed her off. The family moved to California and on the way played one-night stands, with Frances and her sisters, Virginia and Suzanne, aiding their parents with the act. They settled in Lancaster and presently the Gumm Sisters were singing juvenile close harmony in a Los Angeles theater. They accepted an offer in Chicago, appearing on the bill with George Jessel. It was he who suggested the name Garland, after his friend Robert Garland, critic on the New York Sun. Frances chose the front part, Judy. Virginia and Suzanne married. Judy kept on singing until she attracted the attention of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1936. She first appeared on the screen in a short subject called Every Sunday Afternoon, with Deanna Durbin. She has never known an idle mo¬ ment since. Broadway Melody of 1938 established her as a juvenile singing star. Her fame mount¬ ed as she sang in other pictures and made personal appearances. Following Babes In Arms, in 1939, she and Mickey Rooney made a. tour of the East on which they visited the White House. In 1941 Judy sang in New York for a national Greek benefit and again in Chicago at a patriotic rally at which Wendell Willkie was the prin¬ cipal speaker. She also appeared on the Treasury Hour and has been making a steady round of Army camps since the United States entered the conflict. On her nineteenth birthday her mother an¬ nounced Judy's engagement to David Rose, a young composer, whom she married on July 28, 1941. In 1943 they separated. Fame and success have not spoiled Judy. She lives in a modest bungalow in Westwood, just two blocks from her mother. She idolizes her niece and namesake, Judy Sherwood, daughter of her sister, Virginia, who is now working as script clerk at the studio. Judy already has carved a niche for herself in the writing world. Two volumes of her poetry have been privately printed and the check she received for writing a national magazine article is framed and hangs right next to the Oscar awarded the star for her performance in The Wizard of Oz. She has changed in many ways during the years since she came to Hollywood, a mite of a girl with a tremendous voice. Now she is five feet, three inches in height, weighs 115 pounds and is constantly active. She requires no rigorous diet. Spaghetti and chili is one of her favorite dishes, and she can follow it up with ice cream and chocolate cake. Her reddish-brown hair has the sheen of health and her large brown eyes are nearly always sparkling with mirth, excepting when she sees a sad picture, or listens to melan¬ choly music. Then she cries and enjoys it. Since her graduation from Los Angeles High School in 1939, she has been painting in oil with considerable success. She sings to herself when she paints. It's a dual pleasure.

[15] t/AzoA IjaAAjon I REEN-EYED, red- haired Greer G a r s o n , of County Down, Ire¬ land, became a star in her first motion picture, but it wasn't due to the luck of the Irish. She worked for it a long, long time in advance. On her arrival in Hollywood in 1939, following the production of Goodbye. Mr. Chips, in England, she fasci¬ nated the town as few new arrivals ever had done before. Her personality was as colorful as her beauty. Her background provides an arresting story of determination and pluck. She was born on September 29 in County Down, in the North of Ireland, into a family that lacked any as¬ sociation with the theater. Her father, George Garson, was a business man from the Orkney Isles. Her mother, Nina Greer, was descended from the Scotch McGregors. Miss Garson, like her ancestors on both sides, is a rebel against the commonplace. At the age of four she recited in the town hall and the applause kindled her ambition to become an actress. After the death of her father, she and her mother moved to England, where she trained to become a teacher, hating the thought, but winning one scholarship after another. She was graduated with honors from the University of London and the Uni¬ versity of Grenoble, in France. She escaped a teaching career by taking employment with a London advertising firm, where she eventually maneuvered an intro¬ duction to the manager of the Birmingham Repertory Theater. Her enthusiasm won her a role in Street Scene and the critics acclaimed her as a promising find. The die was cast ir¬ revocably. She continued in Birmingham for two sea¬ sons, then went on tour in George Bernard Shaw's Too Good to Be True. Returning to London, she was approached by Sylvia Thompson, novelist, who had just written a play called Golden Arrow. She offered Miss Garson the lead opposite Laurence Olivier. The producer was doubtful of a comparative unknown, but Olivier overcame his objections. The play failed, but she won a personal tri¬ umph. For three years Miss Garson starred in West End plays, including the remembered Made¬ moiselle, directed by Noel Coward, Old Music, Accent on Youth and Vintage Wine. She de¬ clined many film offers in this period, deter¬ mined to first establish herself in the theater. Louis B. Mayer, visiting London, saw her in Old Music, instantly recognizing her merits. Miss Garson conducted her own negotiations. She went to Hollywood where inactivity at first made her ill. Studio executives were choosing her initial picture with extreme care. A week before her contract expired she was assigned to the role of Mrs. Chips and re¬ turned to England to make it. She and the picture made screen history. Her first American film was Remember, op¬ posite Robert Taylor. Then she starred in Pride and Prejudice, reunited with Laurence Olivier. The picture was a success and she next appeared in the memorable Blossoms in the Dust, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's tribute to Mrs. Edna Gladney, whose devotion to the cause of child welfare made her a notable figure in American life. She followed in When Ladies Meet, then in Mrs. Miniver, early in 1942. She won the Academy Award for 1942 for her performance in Mrs. Miniver. On July 24, 1943, she married Richard Ney, now an ensign in the Navy. Miss Garson is five feet, six inches in height, weighs consistently 112 pounds. Her famous hair is the color that Florentine artists im¬ mortalized and her eyes are blue-green. She lives quietly, and is intensely serious about her work. With all the varied foods that Hollywood markets and cafes have to offer, her favorites are potatoes and stew — both Irish.

JlcdfaujM ^fAcuyAon A deaf janitor at the St. Louis Municipal Opera House was largely instrumental in opening to Kathryn Grayson a singing ca¬ reer in pictures. He couldn't hear her voice, but he sensed the spirit behind it. She was 12 at the time. It was a kid's imaginative impulse that led her to venture into the deserted building late one afternoon. Song was bursting from her heart. The old janitor watched her from the shadows and when she finished, he ap¬ plauded. She went back often for the next two years, always at the same time. He ex¬ pected her. By then her young voice filled the audi¬ torium. Frances Marshall, starring with the Chicago Civic Opera Company, then playing the house, happened to come in as she was singing. Miss Marshall took the girl in tow, coached her personally, opening the way to the career that has skyrocketed her to star¬ dom at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. There were setbacks and disappointments in the interval, but fortune hovered in her vicinity with more than ordinary consistency. An example occurred when the family moved to Hollywood. Kathryn continued her singing lessons as she attended Manual Arts High School. An opportunity to sing on Eddie Can¬ tor's radio program was interrupted when Louis B. Mayer happened to hear her. The result was a contract without even the for¬ mality of a screen test. This singular girl, now an acknowledged dramatic actress as well as singer, was born Zelma Hedrick, the daughter of Charles E. and Lillian Gray Hedrick, in Winston-Salem, N. C., on Feb. 9. There were two older brothers. Buddy and Hal, and a sister, Millie, was bom later. The family moved to St. Louis when the first daughter was three. She was educated there in public and pri¬ vate schools. Her father was a successful real estate contractor. Soon after her meet¬ ing with Miss Marshall, business affairs called the family to Texas. They collided with a fruit truck on a Texas highway and for five months Kathryn and her mother were in a hospital. When that ordeal ended they went to Cali¬ fornia. Kathryn continued with her singing, enjoying the new surroundings, her mind oc¬ cupied largely by plans for the theater and opera. In that period she received the pro¬ posal to sing with Cantor. At Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer her professional name was chosen from her own middle name, and Grayson, from her mother's maiden name. Gray. She began immediately to study under the studio's musical and dramatic specialists to further her musical career, and to improve her acting technique. A year later, in July of 1940, Miss Grayson made her screen debut in Andy Hardy's Pri¬ vate Secretary , starring Mickey Rooney. Next she appeared in the leading romantic femi¬ nine role in The Vanishing Virginian, with Frank Morgan, then in Rio Rita, with Abbott and Costello. Seven Sweethearts and Thou¬ sands Cheer followed. Before going into her role in Anchors Aweigh, Miss Grayson was elevated to stardom. In 1940 Miss Grayson was married to John Shelton, an actor, now a Lieutenant in the armed forces. She devotes considerable time to her garden and she walks long and often. The night life of Hollywood fails to attract her, for the reason that she is so vitally con¬ cerned with her work. She sleeps ten hours a night ordinarily and social affairs are ar¬ ranged accordingly. That schedule, however, has been changed abruptly by the war. Miss Grayson, like her colleagues in the profession, is devoting vir¬ tually all of her spare time to war work in the canteens, to efforts on behalf of War Bonds and Stamps and to entertaining the troops. She has thrown her schedule into the discard for the duration. Her hobbies are music, drawing and paint¬ ing; her recreations hiking, horseback riding and golf. She plays the piano, and her pets are a canary and a bull dog. She is five feet, three inches in height, weighs 120 pounds and has hazel eyes and gleaming brown hair. She still remembers the old deaf janitor in St. Louis. LIFELINES Born, Zelma Hedrick, Winston-Salem, N.

[17] DiaJthaJum Kspbuum THE Hepburns of Hartford, Conn., must be number¬ ed among America's most remarkable fam¬ ilies, each an indi¬ vidualist, and none more so than Kath¬ arine Hepburn. Her father. Dr. Thomas Norvel Hepburn, is a Johns Hopkins grad¬ uate, and a prominent surgeon of that city. Her mother, who was a Boston Houghton, is best known as a spirited advocate of birth control, and once picketed the White House in the cause of women's suffrage. Her broth¬ ers and sisters, Robert, Richard, Marion and Peggy, have widely divergent interests. All have one in common, the Hepburn family, to which the seven Hepburns are devoted. Katharine was born in Hartford on Novem¬ ber 8. Following completion of grade and high school in Hartford, Katharine matricu¬ lated at Bryn Mawr College, her mother's alma mater. She graduated with the degree of Doctor of Psychology. Instead of opposing their daughter's en¬ trance into the theater, the Hepburns helped pack her bags and wished her well. She learned that Edwin Knopf, who operated a stock company in Baltimore, Md„ was in need of an ingenue, applied for the job, and got it. After remaining with the company for a short time, Katharine went to New York, study¬ ing voice with Frances Robinson Duff and the Russia ballet under Michael Mordkin. Then she tackled Broadway. Her first good role was the lead in The Big Pond. When the play was tried out at Great Neck, Long Island, she and the director dis¬ agreed as to her interpretation of the role, and Katharine left the cast. The same thing hap¬ pened when she was chosen for the lead in Death Takes a Holiday, and again with The Animal Kingdom. Despite these difficulties, Katharine was winning a reputation as an actress of promise. This brought her the lead in The Warrior's Husband, and it was a hit. She was imme¬ diately signed by RKO to appear with John Barrymore in Bill of Divorcement. From Bill of Divorcement, her screen career boomed. Morning Glory, in 1933, won her the Academy Award. Other successes were Chris¬ topher Strong, Little Women and Alice Adams. Then came Sylvia Scarlett, Mary of Scotland, A Woman Rebels, Quality Street, Stage Door, Bringing Up Baby and Holiday, the last two filmed in 1938. At this stage of her career, along came Philip Barry with a play titled The Philadelphia Story. There wasn't much excitement when she took the play into the Shubert Theater on Broadway. But it wasn't long before inter¬ est was aroused. Katharine had a hit. For weeks, the SRO sign hung outside the box- office. The sparkling Barry comedy made Katharine an entirely new career. The play ran for fifty -two weeks, 416 performances. It was purchased, along with Katharine's serv¬ ices, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The picture version firmly reestablished her on the screen. It won her an Academy Award nomination. She next co-starred with Spencer Tracy in Woman of the Year, again being nominated for an Academy Award, then returned to the stage to appear in another Barry play, With¬ out Love. Turning from comedy to drama, she made Keeper of the Flame. Completely happy in her picture work, she signed a new M-G-M contract in 1944, which permits her to do a stage play between films. Her first picture under the new contract was Pearl S. Buck's Dragon Seed, story of China's courageous fight against the Japanese invaders, in which she played Jade. Katharine wants people to like her but will not pretend to be something she is not, to win regard. Her complete honesty and fairness are among her chief charms. A natural ath¬ lete, she was once a semi-finalist in the Con¬ necticut Golf Championship for Women, plays a bang up game of tennis and is a good swim¬ mer and rider.

[ 18] Uan QjohnAjon THEY were re¬ hearsing a show. New Faces, at the Vanderbilt Theater in New York, when Van Johnson, a young real estate salesman from New¬ port, R. I., walked in with a friend and member of the cast. The director waved an impatient signal, calling them to the stage. Johnson went behind the footlights with his companion and danced his way right into a Broadway hit. That was in 1937, when his only experience had been high school dra¬ matics back home. He remained through the engagement, then joined Buster West and Lucille Page in vaude¬ ville. That turned out another success and he became one of Eight Men of Manhattan, with Mary Martin, at the famous Rainbow Room. He went into the Broadway success. Too Many Girls, in 1940, and the following year he was in Pal Joey. That remembered triumph was still running nine months later when John¬ son left to accept a motion picture offer. In Hollywood he appeared in one picture, called Murder In the Big House. Nothing else followed at once and he was beginning to wonder if he had been wise to quit Broad¬ way. Having a lonely dinner in a Hollywood restaurant one evening in 1942, he encountered a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer executive. Johnson promptly signed a contract for a term of years at the Culver City studio. It is typical of Van’s modesty that he re¬ gards his phenomenal rise in the theater and films in such brief time as a stroke of luck, coupled with a strong mixture of nerve. He remembers that he might never have gone on the stage that day if the light had been better, or if the director had looked closely when he summoned the cast. Accordingly, Johnson is planning his career in pictures on a basis of practical knowledge. He still hopes for luck, but he won't depend upon it. Johnson is a native of Newport, R. I. His parents, Charles E. and Loretta Johnson, were not in sympathy with his early interest in the theater. He attended public schools and par¬ ticipated in class dramatics at high school, usually to sing, or dance, frequently both. Upon graduation he went to work for his father, a well-known realtor in Newport, as stenographer and bookkeeper. No subdivision in the colorful community was so attractive in his eyes as a stage set, and no sale of property was as desirable as a berth with a Broadway show. It was during this period that Van vis¬ ited New York and encountered the actor friend in the cast of New Faces. Johnson also sings as a baritone, but he hopes his hoofing and vocal talents prove secondary to his acting. He prefers comedy. His personality reflects humor. He is six feet, two inches tall, weighs 185 pounds, and he has red-gold hair and very blue eyes that usually glint with mirth. His second venture before the cameras, in The War Against Mrs. Hadley, was his first under a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contract. It earmarked him as one of the hottest potential stars among the younger set of actors on the M-G-M lot. In two Dr. Gillespie pictures in succession, followed by featured roles in A Guy Named Joe, Madame Curie, Two Girls and a Sailor and The Human Comedy, he proved his claim to stellar ranking and joined the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer galaxy of stars with his role in Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo, as Lieut, (now Captain) Ted Lawson, one of the Tokyo raid heroes and author of the book of the same name from which the screenplay was adapted. In Ziegfeld Follies, together with the cream of the crop of M-G-M's stars, he shows a new versatility, appearing in several of the spec¬ tacular numbers making up this greatest of all filmusicals to date.

[19] Jisdhj. r*- 5HH / rHEN Gene Kelly revealed to screen and stage audiences, and to Metr o-Goldwyn- Mayer particularly, that he was not only tops as a dancer but was an impressive and moving dramatic actor as well, he charted a straight and speedy course to cinema stardom. Executives of M-G-M were convinced of Kelly's rare ver¬ satility when they saw him score an overnight hit in the Broadway stage play. Pal Joey. When that play finished its run more than a year later, Kelly affixed his Irish name to a long term M-G-M contract, and made his screen bow with Judy Garland and George Murphy in For Me and My Gal. In a little more than two years and in six pictures under the M-G-M banner. Gene has won the coveted, rank as a star. Those films, following For Me and My Gal, were Pilot No. 5, Du Barry Was a Lady, Thousands Cheer, The Cross of Lor¬ raine and Ziegfeld Follies. For other studios, on a loan-out, he scored in Cover Girl and Christmas Holiday. It was in high school that Gene decided to be a dancer. Interested in dramatics, he learned that a dancer could get a part in the class plays. On his own volition, to the amaze¬ ment of his mother, he went to dancing school. This all occurred in Pittsburgh, where Kelly was born on Aug. 23, the son of James Patrick and Harriett Kelly. His father was an executive with the Columbia Gramo¬ phone Company. His mother was an artist. Joan and Louise, his sisters, are teachers, the former in high school, the latter a dance in¬ structor. He has two brothers, James P., Jr., an accountant in Canton, O., and Frederic N., also an actor and dancer. Gene enrolled at Pennsylvania State Col¬ lege, majoring in law, but it became neces¬ sary for him to finance his own education. He devoted his first summer vacation to a job as apprentice bricklayer. He also mixed con¬ crete and in the evenings mixed sodas at a college drugstore. That fall he entered the University of Pittsburgh. Quite by chance that winter Gene danced at several obscure night clubs. It was a pay¬ ing proposition. He began an intensive study of the art and directly he was acting as tutor for college acquaintances. Nevertheless, he enrolled in law school. but Blackstone could not keep step with the sudden mania for dancing. Gene dropped out to teach others what he had learned. The Kelly family joined forces. Both sisters and one brother served as instructors and their mother designed costumes for their amateur shows. Directly, there were two Kelly Dance Schools operating. Thus it became a family affair that not only paid them well, but afforded them amusement because they enjoyed the work. The Kelly schools had the younger generation of Pitts¬ burgh on their toes literally, and dancing technique improved noticeably all over town. Gene determined that they could run on their own rhythmic momentum while he looked over the situation in New York. Two days after he hit Broadway, he had a dancing role in Leave It to Me. That led to the juvenile lead in One for the Money, followed by 22 weeks in Saroyan's Time of Your Life. Several offers came from Hollywood, but Kelly was doubtful of his ability in a new medium. He wished more experience. He played in summer stock, then in 1940 he starred in Pal Joey. In Hollywood, after his appearance in such film hits as DuBarry Was a Lady and Thou¬ sands Cheer, his nimble feet and Irish charm would alone have brought him success. When, however, he turned in such a moving dramatic performance in The Cross of Lorraine his repu¬ tation zoomed to stellar rating. Married in 1941 to Betsy Blair, of the New York stage, Kelly now lives in an English provincial house in Hollywood. He has no regrets whatever that he danced his way through college and away from the law.

JjCLMcUiA THE name of Hedy Lamarr has be¬ come a house¬ hold word wherever motion pictures are shown. To millions of moviegoers her dark beauty has today be¬ come a measuring rod for the acme of feminine pulchritude. But she has not de¬ pended on her looks alone. Her dramatic ability, not her beauty, won her stardom. Within a brief span of years, Hedy Lamarr has carved a niche for herself in cinema's Hall of Fame that is unique and unprece¬ dented in the annals of Hollywood. She was born on November 9, the daughter of Emil Kiesler, director of the Bank of Vienna, then an institution of international power. She was raised in comparative luxury, educated by private tutors, but even then the theater lured her irresistibly. At 15, a student in a Vienna private school, she played \"hookey\" and applied for a job as script clerk at the Sascha Studio. There was an unfilled role and she pleaded for it. The title of that picture was Storm in a Water Glass. There was a tempest at home, too, but Hedy weathered it. She was soon cast in One Doesn't Need Money , after which she went to Berlin. Almost at once she met Max Rein¬ hardt, who cast her in The Weaker Sex. She followed in Noel Coward's Private Lives. She was attracting wide attention. Berlin was al¬ ready toasting her beauty. Then she accepted a role in a picture filmed in Prague, called Sympathy of Love. It was released as Ecstasy and exploited, to her re¬ gret, as a sensation. She left pictures and back in Vienna starred in the play Cissy. It was then that she met Fritz Mandl, interna¬ tional financier, and married him. When she proposed to return to the stage, her husband objected. She ran away in the night to Paris, then to London. There, by chance, she learned that Louis B. Mayer was in town and he granted her an interview. He arranged for a test in London, but, fearing pursuit from Vienna, she sailed for America. That was in 1937. Hollywood bewildered her. Already fluent in French, German, Hungarian and Italian, she proceeded to mas¬ ter the new tongue. Her American debut was made in Algiers, an immediate triumph. She followed swiftly in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's Lady of the Tropics, I Take This Woman, Boom Town, Comrade X, Come Live With Me, Zieg- feld Girl, H. M. Pulham, Esq., and in 1942, Tortilla Flat, with Spencer Tracy. Since then she has won new laurels and shown great versatility as an actress in Crossroads, White Cargo, and most recently in The Heavenly Body and The Conspirators. She married Gene Markey, writer and pro¬ ducer, following her divorce from Mandl. The new romance proved to be a clash of careers and they parted in 1940. She married John Loder in May, 1943, and they reside in an early American type house high in Beverly Hills. She has adopted a young son, James, whom she calls Jamesie and to whom she is devoted. She has become one of the most popular stars in Hollywood, especially with the service¬ men at the Hollywood Canteen. She likes to go shopping for antiques at out-of-the-way places. She always re-decorates her own house and loves music. Biographies are her favorite reading, together with Shakespeare's plays and sonnets. She wears dirndls at home, plays tennis, skis and swims for exercise. Miss Lamarr's famous eyes are what she herself calls chameleon blue, which is to say that they are variable from hazel to gray and in some lights green. Her hair is deep brown, almost black. She weighs 120 pounds, and is five feet, six inches in height. LIFELINES Born, Hedy Kiesler, November 9, Vienna; Father, Emil Kiesler, deceased. Mother, Gertrude Kiesler.

THERE is signifi¬ cance in the fact that Myrna L o y still plays two songs which featured her first piano recital in Helena, Montana, when she was seven. She also owns the cattle ranch where she was born — and she clings to the freckles which adorned her piquant face in childhood. Myrna Loy is a constant, and a consistent person as well as a fine actress. She is the daughter of David and Della Williams, who were veteran Montana cattle raisers. Her father, taking a bunch of beef on the hoof to Kansas City, saw a station sign on a ramshackle building. It bore the name Myrna. He liked the sound of it. When his daughter was bom on August 2, that was the name they gave her. She chose Loy as a professional name when she was first cast in sultry Oriental roles. She was in her grammar school years when her mother's health failed, causing the family to move to California. She attended school in Venice, seaside suburb of Los Angeles. She began to study dancing and was acknowl¬ edged as talented. Her initial tragedy was the death of her father in the 1918 epidemic of influenza. The mother, with Myrna and her younger brother, David, moved to Los Angeles. Myrna attended the Westlake School for Girls, but when fam¬ ily finances dwindled she transferred to Venice High School and earned something as a teach¬ er of dancing in Culver City, within sight of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios. Eventually she went to work in the Horsley studio as a film cutter. This led to her initial appearance as a gilded, slant-eyed dancer in the prologue of The Thief of Bagdad at Grau- man's Egyptian Theater. Twelve years later she returned to leave the imprint of her foot in the forecourt of Grauman's Chinese theater among those of other famous stars. Christy Cabanne, director, cast her as the Madonna in Ben Hut, but Betty Bronson re¬ placed her and Myrna played the part of a fallen woman instead. The Valentinos were influential in having her play the sinuous Oriental siren in What Price Beauty. The siren captured Hollywood. Lowell Sherman, actor - director, induced Warner Brothers to place her under contract and for some seasons thereafter Myrna Loy was a Chinese girl, a Hindu or a Polynesian. Her first departures from the exotic seduct¬ ress roles for which she had become famous came in 1932 when she was cast in featured parts in Transatlantic, The Devil to Pay, and especially in The Animal Kingdom. Though Miss Loy covered herself with glory in many fine Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer pictures, such as The Prize Fighter and the Lady, Test Pilot, with Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy, When Ladies Meet, Great Ziegfeld, Libeled Lady, Stamboul Quest, Too Hot to Handle and a host of others, she has won her great¬ est celebrity and entrenched herself as one of the first stars of Hollywood in The Thin Man series, with William Powell. She has red hair, her eyes are blue-green and she is five feet, five inches in height and weighs 120 pounds.

[22] $whcf& Vyfouiphy LET George do it is more than just a wise-crack in the life of George Murphy. When they wanted melody in the movies he sang and when they called for hoofing he danced. At Yale he starred on the gridiron, was an ace on the college nine and a fast man on the track. He also found time to major in engineering. After graduation he became a Pennsylvania coal miner and was badly hurt in an accident. Upon recovery, he took up dancing to restore the use of his limbs and as a form of exer¬ cise and relaxation. Whatever happened to be required, George did it, and he still does, affably and with eclat as one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's highly valued stars. His background is revealing. He was bora in New Haven, Conn., July 4, the son of Michael (Mike) Murphy, the celebrated track coach. When George was two years old, the family moved to Philadelphia where his father coached at the University of Pennsylvania. After his father's death, the family settled in Detroit. George attended public schools and enrolled at Pawling and Peddie Institute, advancing through his prep years in scholas¬ tics and on the field withount difficulty. He later graduated from Yale. His interest in engineering and mechanics led him to work in Detroit automobile factories in summer vacations, where he met Juliette Johnson whom he married in 1927. She taught George to dance. They made their bow as a dance team in a chop suey res¬ taurant, accepting their meals in payment. When they could no longer look at or eat chow mein or chop suey, they quit. They got an engagement at a club in the East Sixties and scored with the customers. Suddenly they were a star team at the Mont¬ martre, then the Central Park Casino. Next they went to London, appearing at the fash¬ ionable Mayfair, then the Opera Club in Paris. Back in New York, Murphy played juvenile leads in Good News, Hold Everything, Shoot the Works, Here Goes the Bride, Of Thee I Sing and Roberta. After making his screen debut in Kid Mil¬ lions, with Eddie Cantor, and appearing in several other pictures and the musical show. Anything Goes, he signed with M-G-M in 1936.

[23] TiflahqWisd O’&jum Though one of the most gifted and sensational child actresses ever to brighten the Holly¬ wood horizon, wee and winsome Mar¬ garet O'Brien bears none of the earmarks of the prodigy or pre¬ cocious child. Away from the cameras she is a normal youngster who likes to skip rope or play with jacks, daub with crayons, look at picture books, dress her dolls or play with her pets. Undoubtedly a born actress, with a family theatrical tradition behind her and millions of moviegoers of all ages as her ardent fans, she has, in the brief span of nine pictures, attained a deserved place in Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer's galaxy of great stars. Her first two screen appearances, in a government short film with James Cagney and in Babes On Broadway with Mickey Rooney brought forth unprecedented acclaim from the theatergoing public and critics alike. At the time just five years old, she was im¬ mediately cast in the title role of Journey For Margaret. Once again in magazine and news¬ paper reviews, and via a deluge of fan mail to M-G-M Studios, the tiny actress was hailed as a child marvel and future star. She more than fulfilled this latter prediction in The Lost Angel, The Canterville Ghost and Meet Me in St. Louis and was immediately made a star in her own right, her name now sharing the spotlight with the present roster of thirty-three great marquee names which are included in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's list of stars. Margaret was born in Los Angeles, January 15, 1937. Her mother is Gladys O'Brien, who was formerly known on the stage as a dancer under the name of Gladys Flores. Eight years ago, Mrs. O'Brien abandoned her own career to coach her sister, well known on Broadway as Marissa Flores, an accomplished dancer, and at present under contract to M-G-M. The little star neither dances, sings, nor plays any musical instrument. Her forte is exclusively acting. Her hobby is drawing, with dime store water colors or crayons. She has recited Lincoln's Gettysburg ad¬ dress over the radio and played in dramatic sketches on the air, but has never been on the stage. Paul Hesse, the artist, attracted by her piquant face and hazel eyes, has often used Margaret as his model for magazine cover illustrations. Her hair is medium brown and straight. She is 44 inches tall and weighs 41 pounds. It is difficult for her to be inactive. Life is too full of a number of things, including a 14-months old Cocker spaniel which she named Maggie. She has taught Maggie to stand on her hind legs and dance. Her fancy for toys and play things runs to animals and she has practically a miniature zoo of calico cats, toy rabbits, horses, tigers, teddy bears and such. Still unconscious of her talent, Margaret is totally unconcerned with fame and fortune. To her the job is fun — so she takes it home with her and works at it there, borrowing anything her mother will lend in the way of a costume or props. Her vivid imagination makes other material accessories unnecessary. She started to school in 1943, but even before she took up regular studies in the studio class¬ room she had mastered the alphabet, could print her name and add and subtract a little. Robert Young and Lionel Barrymore are her favorite screen stars. Observing her at work before the cameras as she laughs, cries, cringes in terror or smil¬ ingly fondles a toy, the ordinarily unimpres¬ sionable studio experts, workers and her older fellow actors and actresses have unanimously and readily agreed with those moviegoers and critics, who first fell under the spell of her wistfully mobile little face, her great, and as yet still hardly tapped, talents.

[24] SuAan fisd&M Susan peters set a three - year deadline on her chances of becoming a movie star. The first two years of patient training and prepara¬ tion for the screen had to be written off as a dead loss. Or at least so Susan thought. For at the expiration of her probationary period, Miss Peters' contract expired and was not renewed. Then, when things looked darkest, her fortunes changed. Today she is one of M-G-M's most scintillant stars. Chronologically, Miss Peters was bom in Spokane, Washington, on July 31, the daugh¬ ter of Mrs. Abby Carnahan. She left her home town at the age of one, and after brief resi¬ dences in Seattle and Portland, went to Holly¬ wood with her mother. Educated at the Flint- ridge Sacred Heart and La Rue Schools, she graduated from Hollywood High at eighteen. A level-headed young woman, whose early ambition was to be a doctor, she realized that, of the thousands of girls who storm Holly¬ wood's gates every year, few make good. So she set her goal at stardom, or nothing. Feeling a sense of responsibility for her mother and younger brother, the very deter¬ mined high school graduate decided to take a three year fling at the movies. If she did not succeed by the end of that time she would resume her study of medicine. Right off, she made two tests, one for Our Town and the other. So Red the Rose. Nothing came of them, but Warner Brothers thought Miss Peters was worth taking a chance on, and signed her to a contract. She was sent to the studio dramatic school, instructed on make-up and other details. Also, she was given a screen name. The one she bore from birth, Susanne Carna¬ han, was deemed too ponderous for screen purposes. Without her knowledge, since no¬ body bothered to ask her, she was named Sharon O'Keefe. This she objected to, so Miss Peters was asked to select her own name from fifty suggested. Susan Peters appealed to her the most. Through two years of disappointments. Miss Peters applied herself to learning the rudi¬ ments of acting. She became probably the most screen-tested girl in the movies. Occa¬ sionally, she was given bits and small speak¬ ing roles in such films as Santa Fe Trail, Sockeroo, Scattergood Baines Pulls the Strings and Escape from Crime. But nobody would give her a major role. After some twenty tests, with parts that didn't materialize, she was tested for King's Row. After that test, her contract option wasn't taken up. She had a year to go, with prospects fading. So it was in that dismal hour for her, Direc¬ tor S. Sylvan Simon came to the rescue. He needed a very youthful girl to play Cora Edwards in Tish. She had to be young, but a fine dramatic actress. Simon thought Miss Peters could do it. He gave her the oppor¬ tunity, and she made good. Miss Peters was so good, in fact, that Simon told others about her. At the time. Producer Sidney Franklin and Director Mervyn Le Roy were frantically searching for a young actress to play Kitty in the picturization of James Hilton's Random Harvest, starring Ronald Col- man and Greer Garson. It was a star-making part opposite Colman. They tested scores of actresses. Then they saw Miss Peters, and didn't even go to the trouble of testing her. Onward and upward, toward the stardom she has recently achieved, she travelled fast, in such following pictures as Andy Hardy's Double Life, Assignment In Brittany and two Dr. Gillespie film roles. In Song of Russia she achieved co-star rating, sharing the spotlight with Robert Taylor in his final picture for the duration. Thus, almost to the day, and after two years of frustration. Miss Peters has achieved the goal she sought and within the time she set for herself.
