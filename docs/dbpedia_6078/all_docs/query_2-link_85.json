Because every chapter explores a spectrum of particularly signiﬁcant motion pictures and the broad range of historical events in one year, readers will gain a continuing sense of the decade as it came to be depicted on movie screens across the continent. The integration of historical and cultural events with the sprawling progression of American cinema illuminates the pervasive themes and the essential movies that deﬁne an era. Our series represents one among many possible ways of confronting the past; we hope that these books will offer a better understanding of the connections between American culture and ﬁlm history.

By the decade’s close, America’s global supremacy as a supplier of commercial goods was secured, in part due to the disruptions caused by World War I. Progressivism, the dominant political movement of the era, guided social policy and legislation with the goal of taming the mayhem of unchecked modernization. An enhanced sense of American identity was promoted by the spread of national distribution and communication networks that disseminated everything from mass circulation magazines to nationally branded consumer items, trends and fads like the wristwatch, the Raggedy Ann doll, and the Ouija board, and—of particular signiﬁcance for a shared notion of Americanism—the movies. A host of new products, from Oreo cookies to the Frigidaire and the Model T, demonstrated how technological innovation continued to affect daily life. The horrors of World War I, the ﬁrst highly technologized war, underscored that fact in a grim way. Liberalization within the social sphere brought the introduction of Planned Parenthood and the nation’s ﬁrst no-fault divorce law (in Nevada). In popular culture, ragtime music, the fox-trot dance craze, and lavish revues like the Ziegfeld Follies signaled the weakening grip of Protestant moral austerity and the growing importance of amusements emphasizing stimulation and fun. In the realm of high culture, American artists in various ﬁelds participated in the modernist experiment, with ﬁgures as diverse as painter Joseph Stella and writers Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein redeﬁning the boundaries of aesthetic expression. Stein, tellingly, related her stylistic innovations to a quintessentially modern and American mode of constant change encapsulated in the moviegoing experience. If the movies were indeed representative of American modernity during this decade, it was arguably the ever-changing nature of motion pictures and 1\n\n2\n\nBEN SINGER AND CHARLIE KEIL\n\nthe rapid transﬁguration of the industry creating them that capture most vividly their representative quality. For many, the image that comes to mind when thinking about America at this time is of teeming masses and trafﬁc jams in Lower Manhattan or Chicago’s Loop. Such pictures convey the strikingly modern experiential milieu of at least some portion of the population. It is important to bear in mind, however, that most Americans still lived in distinctly quieter places. The country’s population in the 1910s was one-third of its current size (around 100 million versus 300 million) and, while urbanization was escalating, America remained a predominantly rural society. Quantifying population distribution is complicated due to idiosyncrasies and changes in the categories and methodologies employed by the census bureau, but as a rough approximation one can say that in this period about 60 percent of Americans lived in small towns or rural areas. One person in three worked on a farm, compared with one person in ﬁfty today. Only about one person in four or ﬁve lived in a major city (that is, one of the twenty to twenty-ﬁve cities with populations over a quarter million). Given the rural majority, what justiﬁes emphasizing modernization as the keynote of the 1910s? One answer would be that all cultures have centers and peripheries, and it is invariably the centers—hotbeds of expression, innovation, industry, commerce, politics, and civil society—that deﬁne an age and rightly attract historical attention. A more compelling answer, the one that informs this volume, is that the 1910s was a time when the center reached into the periphery on an unprecedented scale, due to new technologies and systems of transportation, communication, and distribution. The boundaries between urban and rural America became less distinct. An urban national culture inﬁltrated the hinterlands as never before, rendering the periphery’s consciousness of and contact with the cultural center more extensive and palpable than in previous decades. With ever-expanding transportation networks and the emergence of mass production, mass marketing, and mass communications (especially the cinema), American society became more integrated, more interconnected, and more dynamic in its circulation of goods, images, ideas, and people. This is not to suggest that a rural/urban divide no longer existed; smalltown America was largely buffered from the sensory and heterosocial intensity of the nation’s metropolitan centers, and even a casual glance at the period’s entertainments will ﬁnd that popular culture never tired of highlighting comic and moral differences between provincial country folk and urbane urbanites. In the many ﬁlms focusing on small-town life, country lads and lasses are virtuous, albeit awkward and naive, while city slickers\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nand “vamps” are suave but degenerate. Yet this very motif underscores the fact that the issue of contact and interaction between the two was a timely phenomenon engaging social reﬂection. The primary engine driving new forms of interconnection was the tremendous rise of big business during the decade, a force reﬂecting major technological innovations, a movement toward stringent “rationalization” (i.e., the implementation of optimally efﬁcient techniques and systems of corporate management, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, accounting, and so on), and access to enormous sums of investment capital to ﬁnance large-scale commercial expansion. The growth of big business is exempliﬁed by the rise of Ford Motors, a company whose stunning success stemmed from quintessential examples of industrial rationalization (to such a degree that the term “Fordism” is often used as shorthand for “rationalization”). Automobile manufacturing began in the mid-1890s in the United States. In the 1910s, Henry Ford and his engineers transformed the automobile from a ﬂimsy plaything of the rich to a rugged, practical machine affordable to mainstream consumers. He did so by focusing on a single simpliﬁed and standardized design—the Model T— and innovating ultra-efﬁcient manufacturing techniques, most signiﬁcantly the moving assembly line, which, upon its introduction in 1913, cut the labor required to assemble a chassis from 12.5 hours to 1.5 hours. Six thousand Model Ts were manufactured in 1908, its ﬁrst year of production. By 1916, that number had increased almost one-hundredfold, to nearly 600,000 cars, while the purchase price had dropped from $850 to $360 (equivalent, in today’s dollars adjusted for inﬂation, to a drop from just over $19,000 to $7,000). During that period, Ford’s distribution network rose from 215 to 8,500 dealerships across the country (Tedlow 125, 137). Overall, 8 million automobiles (of every make) were registered in the country by the decade’s end, up from just under half a million in 1910 (Blanke 3). To cite a few other examples of the decade’s shift toward big business on a national scale, the A & P discount grocery chain expanded from 650 stores in 1914 to 4,600 stores six years later. Mail-order giant Sears, Roebuck saw its net sales increase from $61 million in 1910 to $245 million in 1920 (adjusted for inﬂation, the equivalent of $1.4 billion and $2.5 billion today). Sales of Coca-Cola rose from just over 4 million gallons in 1910 to almost 19 million gallons in 1919 (Tedlow 29, 194, 280). Such ﬁgures indicate not only the upsurge in consumerism that characterizes the decade, but also the degree to which the conveniences afforded by an ever more technologically sophisticated manufacturing sector, delivered through ever\n\n4\n\nBEN SINGER AND CHARLIE KEIL\n\nmore intricate delivery systems, permeated the life of every American who could afford to partake of them. Many could, as the decade witnessed unprecedented increases in economic output and average wages. But balancing the unbridled expansion was increased concern for the social costs attached to that expansion. With the election of Woodrow Wilson as president in 1912, the continued inﬂuence of Progressivism on American politics was assured. Progressivism, sustained through the previous administrations of Roosevelt and Taft, had affected not only government, but the related spheres of journalism, academia, and activism. Committed to battling the excesses of big business and the potentially dehumanizing effects of modern life (largely attributable to the Industrial Revolution), advocates of Progressivism were proponents of efﬁciency, expertise, social justice, and, above all, the notion that it was the proper role of government to implement them. As the name implies, Progressivism was committed to an ideal of progress, a betterment of living conditions that nonetheless often put its faith in the power of trained authorities and bureaucratic systems to effect the necessary changes. Progressivism accounted for many of the notable achievements and trends of the decade, from the introduction of labor reforms (such as the eight-hour work week, minimum wage guarantees, and the increased acceptance of unionism) to the journalistic tradition of muckraking (dedicated to exposing fraudulent business practices, social inequities, and government corruption) to the reining in of industrial combines through trust-busting. The Progressive commitment to efﬁciency often found itself at odds with its own drive for improved social justice and enhanced democracy. For example, Progressives championed the employment of city managers— professionals hired to oversee the daily operations of municipal governments—even though this empowered non-elected ofﬁcials and potentially opposed the will of the people. Similarly, their zeal to eradicate social problems that they believed interfered with progress, such as prostitution and the consumption of liquor, led them to propose solutions that not only impeded individual liberties, but also were ultimately ineffective, since they tended to attack the symptom without addressing the root causes. Critics would argue that the Mann Act of 1910, prohibiting the transportation of women across state lines for “immoral purposes,” may have thwarted socalled “white slave” trafﬁc, but also led to a crackdown on brothels that simply forced many prostitutes onto the streets. Similarly, the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1919, which rendered the production and sale of liquor illegal beginning a year later, created a huge\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nunderground economy and inadvertently aided the operations of organized crime in the process. Even though the Progressive agenda was riven by its own inconsistencies, the movement’s achievements during this decade remain remarkable. Aside from the labor reforms already mentioned, the Wilson administration alone was responsible for an extensive list of changes to the operations and inﬂuence of the federal government, among them the introduction of a national income tax; the establishment of both the Federal Reserve system and the Federal Trade Commission; changes to tariff laws, loan policies, and, eventually, in 1920, ratiﬁcation of the Nineteenth Amendment, extending the right to vote to women. Progressive reforms touched many other aspects of public life as well. An emphasis on the value of education led to a substantial rise in funding, so that it reached $1 billion by the end of the decade, with per-student spending vaulting from $4.64 to $9.60 (Blanke 26). Progressives were inﬂuenced by John Dewey’s child-centered approach to pedagogy, a philosophy that led to curricular reforms, better training of teachers, and more attention paid to the beneﬁts of age-speciﬁc learning environments (including the widespread introduction of kindergarten during the decade, and a large increase in the number of high schools). The need for child protection prompted the creation of a wide range of social service agencies, epitomized by the federal Children’s Bureau, established in 1912. The Bureau gathered statistics on everything from infant mortality to juvenile delinquency, an endeavor that helped provide the data required to support Progressive legislation. Overall, the Progressive tendency was to educate mothers in the proper raising of their children and to lessen the strain on childrearing (even to the point of providing monetary support, as with the provision of “mothers’ pensions” throughout the decade). While Progressive efforts deﬁnitely helped ameliorate some of the most pernicious policies of earlier eras (including child labor), they also led to intrusive and moralizing attempts to monitor the lives of the poor and of immigrants under the assumption that professional experts possessed superior knowledge. While poorer females were often the focus of Progressive initiatives, the burgeoning middle class produced numerous women who helped deﬁne the activist dimension of Progressivism, particularly within the domain of social justice. Civic leaders such as Jane Addams set the agenda for aiding urban ills through settlement houses (institutions established to provide support for poor urban women), while crusaders like Margaret Sanger pushed for birth control to be provided to women. The common drive for suffrage proved a unifying issue. Its implicit demand for a rejection of outmoded\n\n6\n\nBEN SINGER AND CHARLIE KEIL\n\nways of deﬁning womanhood also contributed to the social phenomenon of the “New Woman.” This label attached itself to those who broke with previous traditions by pursuing a more active and independent lifestyle, replete with dancing in public, smoking, and engaging in athletic pursuits. As consumerism increased throughout the decade, advertisers used the image of the New Woman to entice women to embrace a lifestyle deﬁned by indulgence and self-involvement, an aim at odds with the loftier goals of the Progressive impulse. Despite the expressed Progressive concern for the improvement of living conditions of all Americans, certain groups fared better than others. Poverty continued to be widespread, especially among immigrants, rural inhabitants, and African Americans. Upholding segregationist policies, the Wilson administration did little to aid the plights of Blacks in America during this time, leaving advocacy for their rights to groups like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), founded in 1909 and dedicated to upholding the Fourteenth Amendment provisions that had expressly ensured equal protection under the law to former slaves. Blacks found themselves subject to sustained and often violent racism during the decade, particularly demonstrated by the recurrence of lynchings and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan. By the latter part of the decade, increased dissatisfaction with their situation and better prospects in the North resulting from World War I (as enlisted men vacated jobs and immigration slowed to a trickle) fueled the Great Migration and contributed to major race riots in 1917 and 1919. Barred from equal access to most of the practices and institutions that deﬁne a citizen’s daily life, African Americans still managed to inﬂuence white society through one means in particular—music. Syncopated rhythms, derived from African musical styles, became popularized through ragtime. Demand for sheet music ﬂourished, due largely to dramatic increases in the sale of pianos for home parlors. Vying with the music of Tin Pan Alley as the popular choice of sheet music consumers, ragtime was played in the parlors of millions of white Americans, raising the hackles of many cultural critics, but also paving the way for the acceptance of other homegrown musical forms created primarily by Blacks, such as the blues and jazz. The broad popularity of music by Scott Joplin, W. C. Handy, and “Jelly Roll” Morton pointed to ways in which black culture could inﬂuence the white-dominated mainstream. Irving Berlin appropriated ragtime, for example, for his massive hit “Alexander’s Ragtime Band.” It also demonstrates how the spread of popular music became increasingly dependent on centralized distribution (mass-produced sheet music and audio recordings)\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nand was fostered by an urban ethos of sophisticated entertainment that motion pictures would also tap into as the decade progressed. Modernization inﬂuenced the fads and leisure pursuits of Americans throughout the decade. Mass production and improved systems of delivery sped the dissemination of prized consumer goods across the nation, and even toys and games capitalized on the fascination with technology that deﬁned the age. The Erector Set, which allowed children to construct their own miniature versions of skyscrapers, the Singer toy sewing machine, and Model T joke books, are different examples of playthings owing their existence to the modern era. Modern marketing also inﬂuenced the way goods were sold, with corporate icons (like the Campbell Soup kids, which became the model for a pair of popular dolls) demonstrating the newfound popularity of the tie-in. The omnipresence of advertising is one of the clearest markers of the ethos of modernity that blanketed the country, as advertising revenues soared, doubling to a total of close to $1.5 billion by the end of the 1910s (Lears 162). The most obvious beneﬁciary of this additional advertising spending was the mass circulation magazine, including such stalwarts as the Saturday Evening Post, Ladies’ Home Journal, and Cosmopolitan. It was not uncommon for half of such a magazine’s pages to be devoted to advertising. Since the substantial revenues generated by the sale of advertising space offset production costs, publishers could keep the price of magazines low, maintain high circulations, and, in turn, ensure their attractiveness to advertisers. Inevitably, advertising also helped sell the war to the American public: the single most recognizable image attached to enlistment efforts was James Montgomery Flagg’s poster of Uncle Sam soliciting prospective soldiers through the direct “I Want You.” America’s involvement in the war was measured at ﬁrst: when war broke out in August 1914, Wilson issued a formal proclamation of neutrality. However, economic ties with Allied Powers, especially Britain, and a British naval blockade obstructing trade with Germany soon made the United States neutral in name only. The war was a tremendous economic boon to Americans, as the Allies purchased billions of dollars of weaponry and supplies and took out billions more in loans from American banks. By contrast, the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria) gained virtually no material or economic assistance. Tensions escalated in early 1915, when Germany announced that it would target for surprise submarine attack all enemy ships in the seas around the British Isles. On 7 May, a German U-boat sank the British passenger liner Lusitania off the coast of Ireland (en route from New York to\n\n8\n\nBEN SINGER AND CHARLIE KEIL\n\nThe ﬁlm industry’s patriotism on display: Fatty Arbuckle in Times Square putting up a poster for the 1917 Liberty Loan drive. National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nLiverpool): 1,198 people perished, including 128 American citizens. Although the incident spurred anti-German sentiment and prompted Wilson and Congress to initiate measures toward increased military preparedness, many Americans still opposed involvement. Antiwar separatism became an untenable position in March 1917, after U-boats sank seven American merchant ships and after revelation of “the Zimmermann telegram”: a secret communiqué from the German foreign secretary to his ambassador in Mexico advancing the idea of a GermanMexican alliance (encouraging Mexico to invade the United States and win back Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona). On 6 April, after exhorting that “the world must be made safe for democracy,” President Wilson issued a declaration of war. Domestic opposition receded quickly as America mobilized, in part due to a major propaganda initiative mounted by the government’s purpose-created Committee on Public Information. The ﬁlm industry played an important role in the success of the CPI, especially promoting the sale of war bonds. In accordance with the Selective Service Act, 24 million men registered for the draft, and 2.8 million were called up for service, joining roughly 2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nmillion volunteers. American forces engaged in their ﬁrst battles in northern France in May 1918. Helping stop a German offensive, and then ﬁghting a successful counteroffensive, U.S. troops hastened the armistice, which began on 11 November 1918. In all, 52,000 Americans died in battle—a small fraction of the nearly 10 million military casualties suffered in the war overall. Sixty thousand more American soldiers died from an outbreak of inﬂuenza that would soon spread around the globe, causing an estimated 50–100 million deaths worldwide. It was by far the deadliest pandemic in modern history (or perhaps recorded history: by some estimates, it claimed more lives than even the Black Plague). At home, the postwar “return to normalcy” was anything but normal, marked by widespread labor strife, racial conﬂict, and political repression triggered by terrorist bombings and a resulting Red Scare. Wilson participated actively in the European peace treaty negotiations, calling (ultimately unsuccessfully) for nonvindictive conditions of surrender by the Central Powers. His one great diplomatic accomplishment was the formation of a League of Nations as a mechanism for avoiding future wars. In a bitter defeat at home, however, Congress rebuffed the plan, fearing it would entangle the United States in international conﬂicts without pressing national interest. Casting an inﬂuence over every aspect of life in America, the war years offered enhanced employment opportunities to Blacks and women, while also bolstering the fortunes of unions that helped support the war effort. Federal bureaucracy increased during this period, including the formation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1917. Popular culture channeled patriotism through songs like George M. Cohan’s “Over There” and through the resonant work of magazine illustrators, the most famous of whom was Norman Rockwell; his iconic work for the cover of the Saturday Evening Post ﬁrst appeared in 1916. Rockwell’s combination of realism and nostalgia for the simple pleasures of a premodern era remind us again of the transitional nature of this period. By the same token, changes to the ways Americans ate and dressed during the 1910s demonstrate as clearly as any other social shifts the combined inﬂuence of modernity and World War I on the decade. Whereas 1910 still saw women’s fashions favoring the hourglass silhouette produced by the constricting corset and layered, ornate clothing, the inﬂuence of the New Woman as a model of increased freedom and vitality prompted the adoption of looser, more comfortable garments as the decade wore on. Numerous developments affected fashion trends. The increased popularity of public dancing by mid-decade, spurred by various\n\n10\n\nBEN SINGER AND CHARLIE KEIL\n\ndance crazes, including the fox-trot and turkey-trot, required female clothing that permitted freedom of bodily movement. Similarly, the growing acceptance of athletics as part of a middle-class existence (encouraged in part by the active lifestyles of celebrities, including movie stars) translated into a more liberal conception of casual clothing. The normalization of automobile travel also dictated the adoption of garments for riding that permitted one to ride in the open air. And the scarcity of materials during the war years led to simpler, more relaxed clothing styles for both sexes and a reduced palette of colors. Advertising played a role in transmitting fashion trends all the more readily to the national populace and certainly led to the popularization of cosmetics and other beauty aids. A parallel trend toward lighter diets and increased convenience deﬁned the way Americans approached eating and food preparation during the decade. Technological innovations in the realm of kitchen appliances and cookware permitted a wider range of meal choices, while lifestyle changes rendered the eating habits of an earlier era outdated. Breakfast, in particular, became a meal deﬁned by both convenience and lighter foods. Packaged breakfast cereals proliferated during the decade as companies like Kellogg’s, Quaker, and Post proﬁted from the assumed health beneﬁts of their products. Of course, not all convenience foods conferred healthiness onto their consumers: snacks of various kinds became popular ways to satisfy appetites between meals, and World War I only increased the appeal of chocolate bars and chewing gum, not to mention cigarettes. Overall, the lifestyle changes introduced during the 1910s are evidence of a nation constantly involved in the process of redeﬁning itself in light of the inﬂuence of technology and media, among other modernizing forces.\n\n■■■■■■■■■■\n\nStruggles for Control, Systems of Efficiency\n\nAs American society faced a series of challenges and changes, the American ﬁlm industry was undergoing its own transformation. The decade began with a relatively new structure imposed by the recently established Motion Picture Patents Company (alternately known as the MPPC or the Trust) in its attempt to monopolize production. Strictly speaking, the MPPC was set up as a patent pooling organization, but it was designed to drive out of business all producers and distributors who were not members. The Trust desired to restrict the market only to those producers who were part of the original cartel, organizing exchanges (small-scale distributors working within deﬁned territories) and exhibitors in the process, by issuing licenses allowing them to show Trust ﬁlms (and use Trust-produced equipment).\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nThese licensed exchanges and exhibitors were charged fees for the privilege of showing MPPC product, a practice that invited considerable resentment. The Trust also chose to disregard a substantial number of peripheral exchanges and exhibitors that were unlicensed and therefore, they assumed, would wither away. Ignoring this portion of the market would prove to be a fatefully unwise business decision. Although its chief aim was to proﬁt by eliminating competition, to its credit, the MPPC injected some much-needed supply stability into what had become an industry growing too quickly on the demand side. An estimated 12,000 nickelodeon theaters clamored for ﬁlms. The Trust initiated numerous improvements that allowed exchanges and exhibitors to plan their own business practices with more conﬁdence. Chief among these was the establishment of a 1,000-foot format standard, regular release schedules, and more attentive control over the quality of prints in circulation. In 1910, the MPPC moved to extend its monopolistic designs by creating the General Film Company, a parallel organization that systematically purchased every licensed exchange, effectively placing a large sector of the distribution sector under its control. The sole holdout among the licensees was the Greater New York Film Company, owned by William Fox (who would subsequently found the Fox Film Corporation). As vigorously as the MPPC pursued its goal of total market control, it could not keep pace with the burgeoning market. Intense demand for ﬁlms allowed for the emergence of an opposing faction, the Independents. These producers, who primarily courted those exchanges and theater owners who remained unlicensed (and those licensees who chafed against Trust control), emerged almost as soon as the MPPC made its intentions known, and by 1910 there were several Independents already in operation, including the New York Motion Picture Company, Powers, Nestor, and, most important in terms of later developments, Carl Laemmle’s Independent Moving Picture Company, commonly known as IMP. Nineteen ten saw the creation of more Independent ﬁrms of substance, including Thanhouser, Reliance, Solax, and the American Film Company. Many of these companies established themselves by hiring away personnel from established Trust ﬁrms, particularly the most prized asset, actors. This poaching of acting talent by upstart companies demonstrates that “picture personalities” were fast becoming one of the cinema’s most identiﬁable and promotable ingredients. The various ﬂedgling Independent producers soon realized that they would need to organize themselves in a manner similar to the Trust if they were to survive. Accordingly, a few of the leaders of the Independent\n\n12\n\nBEN SINGER AND CHARLIE KEIL\n\nAn example of the Independents’ campaign against the MPPC, ca. 1910 (Bowers 63). (“Simoleon” is period slang for “dollar.”)\n\nfaction, Laemmle among them, established the Motion Picture Distributing and Sales Company in April 1910 to provide unlicensed exchanges with a steady supply of Independent ﬁlms. The Sales Company was sufﬁciently successful in its efforts that it managed to provide twenty-one reels a week to its exchanges by June, while the Trust was guaranteeing thirty (Bowser 81). The basic structure of Trust versus Independents would prevail for several years, and this version of limited competition within a climate of strong demand led to an increasingly powerful production sector. Limiting the presence of foreign ﬁlms on domestic screens also tipped the balance. While ﬁlms from France in particular had dominated the U.S. market in the preTrust years, the MPPC cannily limited the number of foreign ﬁrms allowed to join its cartel. As Eileen Bowser has pointed out, the combination of curtailed access to the American market by foreign ﬁlm companies and an improving rate of productivity led to a growing percentage of American ﬁlms circulating within the market: “By the end of 1912, national production accounted for well over 80 per cent of the American market, at least according to the number of ﬁlm titles released (not copies sold)” (Bowser 85). By the time World War I had decimated foreign production (most pointedly in France and Italy), U.S. control of the world market would fol-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nlow. American domination of its own market was the economic foundation upon which its subsequent success in many other countries was built. Producers could sell their ﬁlms at a relatively low price to ensure competitiveness elsewhere. Ironically, the Independent faction experienced its own internal divisions by the time it had reached parity with the Trust. The Sales Company’s domination of Independent distribution was shaken by the formation of the Mutual Film Corporation in 1912, a breakaway ﬁrm that soon attracted numerous companies that had previously leased their ﬁlms through Sales. The success of Mutual forced a reorganization of the Sales Company, renamed Universal Film Manufacturing Company later the same year. Universal would remain a vital force within the industry, much more so than the MPPC, which found itself attacked on numerous fronts. Competition from the Independents eroded the Trust’s early domination of the market, and the growing popularity of features caught at least some of its members off-guard. Beset by government legal attacks (for violation of antitrust legislation), the Trust was ofﬁcially dissolved by court decree in 1915. It was effectively defunct by that time anyway, a victim of ever-changing market forces. The robust demand for ﬁlms during this decade spurred producers to ﬁnd ways to ensure a steady ﬂow of product. The reforms introduced by the MPPC went some way to ensuring supply would meet demand, but changes to the mode of production aimed further at increasing efﬁciency and, hence, productivity. It is during the decade of the 1910s that one sees concerted efforts toward increased rationalization of production duties, leading to the ascendancy of the producer as the central organizing ﬁgure. Investing control in the position of a central producer introduced the concept of managerial oversight to ﬁlm production: no longer did directors have the same autonomy that previously they had enjoyed. Scripts became blueprints for budget-based decision making and delegation of duties. These changes were prepared for by establishment of the 1,000-foot reel as the standard length for ﬁlms, a common unit of exchange that deﬁned norms for the production sector, leading to a greater standardization in production procedures. Key craft areas were identiﬁed, and labor divided among task-specialized departments. A Vitagraph promotional pamphlet from 1913 depicts a host of departments, ranging from scenic to costume to property to carpentering and upholstering. The company lists its workforce as numbering 400 in its Brooklyn studios alone (exclusive of extras). In describing its managerial structure, the pamphlet notes that “each one of [the company’s] branches is governed by its head, and the whole force is under the Studio Manager,\n\n14\n\nBEN SINGER AND CHARLIE KEIL\n\nwho lays out the work, and is responsible for the performance of the work and the fulﬁllment of the duties apportioned each day. The regular Vitagraph production is one complete picture a day, or six a week. Often it reaches ten a week.” As long as distribution practices favored the delivery of a slate of singlereel ﬁlms to exhibitors, the overall quality of a producer’s output proved more important than the attributes of any individual title. The price of leasing a ﬁlm was standardized, so there was little incentive for producers to undertake ambitious, expensive productions or multi-reel ﬁlms. When on occasion a producer did make a multi-reel ﬁlm, invariably it would be broken up and distributed as a set of single-reel units. For the ﬁrst several years of the decade, the dominance of the singlereel format led to a degree of predictability in every sector of the ﬁlm industry. Within the realm of production, the 1,000-foot length provided the parameters for scenario construction: ﬁlmmakers came to know exactly what was required to turn out a story lasting approximately the same amount of time for each title. For distributors, the uniform length ensured an interchangeability of product, so that different titles from different producers could be mixed and matched at will when programs of ﬁlms were offered to exhibitors. And theater owners easily integrated ﬁlms of this nature into their preexisting variety programs. An evening’s entertainment at a small-scale theater would involve a bill of ﬁve to six one-reel ﬁlms, illustrated song slides (that encouraged audience participation), and a range of live entertainment, typically music or vaudeville performance, depending on the theater’s budget, size, and cultural aspirations. The ever-changing bill of fare meant that patrons did not need to worry about start times for the performance: if one walked in during the middle of a ﬁlm, one could be certain that another would commence in a few minutes. When the singlereel format was displaced by the feature, exhibitors lost control over the organization of their programs; producers assumed that power. Since ﬁxed receipts and ﬁxed ﬁlm lengths discouraged individually distinctive productions, some producers focused on strength in particular genres to differentiate their products. For example, Keystone was known almost exclusively for comedy; American for westerns. Other studios relied more on the popularity of familiar actors. Promotion of motion picture actors did not begin in earnest until the start of the 1910s, in part as a tactic by Independent producers to draw attention to their new offerings. The most high-proﬁle defection of a star from an established company to a new concern at the beginning of the decade was that of Florence Lawrence. Previously billed as the Biograph Girl, her fame derived from her presence in\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\nthat company’s ﬁlms. Lured by Carl Laemmle to IMP, Lawrence was made the focus of an elaborate advertising campaign devised by Laemmle to manufacture controversy and put her name in the news. The IMP ads stressed the falseness of “reports” of Lawrence’s death in a streetcar accident and asserted they were planted by unnamed “rivals” to deceive the public into believing one of its favorite actresses would no longer be making ﬁlms. Through this hoax, IMP achieved both its objectives: it cemented the association of Lawrence with her new employer, and it changed the terms of her recognition, transforming her from the Biograph Girl to Florence Lawrence. Despite what some accounts have argued, the Trust companies were no more reticent about advertising their stars by name than their Independent counterparts. The MPPC’s Kalem was the ﬁrst ﬁrm to publicize its stars by making lobby cards of their images available to exhibitors; Edison provided full cast lists in its advertising before any other company; and Vitagraph promoted its premiere star, Florence Turner (the Vitagraph Girl), with personal appearances at the same time that IMP was capitalizing on the Lawrence rumors. Recognition of fan interest in stars fueled companies’ efforts to promote them in whatever way possible. Just as ﬁlm was a reproducible commodity that could be circulated easily, so too were star images, most obviously through photographs. Images of stars soon appeared in numerous different forms, on everything from postcards to pennants, from pillow tops to the handles of spoons. Every star image further spurred audience interest in the originating vehicles—the ﬁlms in which they appeared. And, as audience investment in stars intensiﬁed, advertisers learned to employ stars to sell an array of consumer goods, connecting them to soap and perfume, among other health and beauty items. Such campaigns initiated a longstanding tradition of aligning stars with both consumerism and physical self-improvement. With studios now employing the collective resources of publicity departments (Vitagraph’s 1913 pamphlet claimed that to “popularize its players” was one of its promotion people’s chief aims), an entire infrastructure developed to cultivate fan interest, including the emergence of publications designed to provide more information on the stars for a curious public. Several new publications emerged that devoted themselves to stories about stars, typically adorned with full-page photos. Journals such as Motion Picture Story Magazine and Photoplay existed chieﬂy to provide the public with a never-ending stream of copy about the stars whom ﬁlmgoers had come to adore. Popularity contests were held to determine which stars commanded the largest fan base, and as the industry structure shifted to\n\n16\n\nBEN SINGER AND CHARLIE KEIL\n\nprivilege the presence of particular stars in feature ﬁlms, the salaries of the most popular stars rocketed upward to reﬂect their market value. The centrality of stars to the industry’s publicity machine and to key industrial strategies such as block booking (in which theater managers had to accept numerous ﬁlms packaged together) afﬁrms the growing clout of actors, but also points to how quickly fan culture had developed around the ﬁgure of the star. Aiding in this process was the concentration of production activity on the West Coast, gravitating toward a cluster of communities near Los Angeles that would eventually come to be known as Hollywood. Although geographic and symbolic identiﬁcation of the ﬁlmmaking community with this iconic name still lay in the future, the industry began to be associated more consistently with the West Coast from the mid-1910s onward. Filmmaking companies had been traveling west for the beneﬁts of extended sunlight and varied terrain since the beginning of the decade, and by 1915 the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce reported that “close to ﬁfteen thousand residents earned their living in the ﬁlm industry, drawing some ﬁve million in wages annually” (Stamp, “Filmland” 334). With numerous companies building extensive studios on the cheap land California provided, an image of exoticism and extravagance attached itself to motion picture production, especially when the studios promoted themselves as glamorous versions of municipalities, devising names like Inceville and Universal City. The latter studio actively courted visitors by offering tours that afforded ﬁrsthand views of the wonders of moviemaking. Fan magazines played their part in promoting the appeals of the so-called movie colony, featuring photo spreads of both the studios and the lavish lifestyles of select stars. Readers were encouraged to imagine the lives of those in “Filmland” as an enhanced version of reality, a parallel to the increased opulence on display in the ﬁlms produced. The ﬁlm industry coveted the female audience in particular, in part because women aided its campaign for respectability, but equally because they were a prime consumer group. And with women (and children) a central target of motion picture promotion, through newspapers and mass-circulation magazines, in addition to theater advertising and fan magazines, custodians of public mores continued to pay attention to the content of motion pictures and the conduct of those making them. At the turn of the decade, exhibitors in New York convinced the People’s Institute, a civic body, to establish what would become the National Board of Censorship. The Board viewed most of the ﬁlms shown in the country, deciding whether they violated obscenity standards or condoned criminal acts. Despite this effort on the industry’s part, state censorship boards\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n17\n\nemerged throughout the 1910s, arising in reaction to the perceived laxity of the Board (which was often seen as an arm of the industry it was supposed to oversee). Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kansas, and Maryland all set up censor boards during the decade, and a pivotal legal case emerged out of the industry’s attempt to challenge the constitutionality of these state regulators. The Mutual Film Corporation sought to have the boards disbanded on the grounds that they thwarted free speech. In 1915 the Supreme Court heard the case and decided that movies were not worthy of the protection accorded the press and forms of artistic expression, opting instead to describe motion pictures as “a business pure and simple.” For many years thereafter, this decision left cinema vulnerable to the prospect of increased external regulatory pressures; fearing the repercussions of oppressive state censorship, the ﬁlm industry instead practiced various forms of self-regulation over the succeeding decades, steering clear of controversy and contentious subject matter in an effort to prove that it was nothing more than a purveyor of “harmless entertainment” (Grieveson, Policing 202).\n\n■■■■■■■■■■\n\nThe Feature Era Begins: Stars, Picture Palaces, and a New Business Model\n\nThe mid-1910s was a period of revolutionary transformation in the ﬁlm industry, one in which virtually every practice of production, distribution, exploitation, and exhibition underwent profound reconﬁguration. The upheaval recast not just the moviegoing experience but the entire business model upon which leading ﬁrms in the industry operated. The years immediately preceding the advent of the feature had been a period of hyper-demand in which the industry’s principal goal was to impose order and deliver a ﬁxed commodity at a ﬁxed price, and in which a well-deﬁned oligopoly sought to stiﬂe competition by controlling patents and exerting legal barriers to entry. The next phase involved a redeﬁnition of both the industry’s central commodity—from single-reeler to feature ﬁlm—and its dominant exhibition venue—from small nickelodeon to grand picture palace. The focus shifted from simply coping with demand to doing everything possible to expand the market and maximize proﬁt potential. The stupendous rise of the feature ﬁlm and picture palace entailed a new commercial calculus: bigger, better ﬁlms enjoyed in bigger, better theaters would generate greater public demand for cinema, and, in conjunction with considerably higher ticket prices and hugely increased seating capacities, would ultimately yield much larger proﬁts. The costs would be much greater, but so would the returns. Bold entrepreneurs like Paramount’s\n\n18\n\nBEN SINGER AND CHARLIE KEIL\n\nAdolph Zukor proved the familiar economic dictum that you have to spend money to make money. Thinking big not only maximized proﬁt, but also impeded competition. The more or less ineffectual legal constraints on competition employed by the MPPC gave way to brute economic constraints, as industry leaders turned moviemaking into a big money proposition demanding prohibitively huge capital and logistical resources. The earliest experiments in the exhibition of feature ﬁlms took place in 1912, when a handful of historical-biographical epics based on successful plays such as Queen Elizabeth, Cleopatra, and Richard III were screened in rented legitimate theaters. The publicity and commercial success they enjoyed led to a seven-fold increase the following year, when 56 features were made by American companies, and again in 1914, when almost 350 features were produced. Still, those numbers were insigniﬁcant next to the roughly 5,000 shorts that were released each year (Singer, “Feature”). Rankand-ﬁle exhibitors were entirely satisﬁed with the daily-change variety format to which they were accustomed. Given the industry’s well-established ﬁlm-rental infrastructure and comparatively low rental prices, few saw any reason to rock the boat. Not only were feature ﬁlms much more expensive to rent (around $600 or $700 per week for a large urban theater, compared with $100–$150 for a week of daily changed variety programs), they were also a hassle; since supply was erratic, there was no coherent distribution network, and contracts and prices had to be negotiated on a ﬁlm-by-ﬁlm basis with a scattering of different distributors. Moreover, mainstream movie theaters served an informal, come-and-go-as-you-please audience. Exhibitors understandably would have had concerns that long narratives demanding that the entire audience be in place from the start would curtail casual walk-ins. They also saw variety programs as inherently ﬂop-proof, since, unlike features, a short ﬁlm that failed to please would not spoil an entire showing. Consequently, feature ﬁlms had virtually no impact on mainstream exhibition for several years after their introduction (contrary to accounts by many historians). Features belonged to an essentially different exhibition circuit comprised of playhouses, concert halls, and general-purpose auditoriums. In most cases, features were screened only irregularly, often just on Sundays, or during the summertime that was off-season in legitimate theaters. This began to change at the end of 1914, however, when Paramount— by far the most active feature-ﬁlm concern—introduced the ﬁrst full-service standing-order rental program. Exhibitors contracted for a year’s worth of ﬁlms, two ﬁve-reelers a week. Booking features was now just as convenient as booking shorts. But the high cost was still a major problem for most the-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n19\n\naters. Paramount established a zone-clearance system so that smaller theaters in smaller markets could pay considerably less than large urban ﬁrst-run venues. Even so, Paramount’s package was still well beyond the reach of a great many modest theaters. Features were predicated on a new calculus, designed for theaters that could sell tickets in high volume and at high prices. Big, well-appointed theaters proﬁted very handsomely. Run-of-themill theaters—rural theaters, neighborhood theaters, vestigial downtown nickelodeons, dog-eared converted playhouses—were in a bind, not fancy enough to justify signiﬁcant price hikes and, even with swanky remodeling, still less alluring than picture palaces offering newer ﬁlms, grander amenities, and better music. More to the point, they still were simply too small to sell enough tickets to turn a proﬁt after paying out the cost of feature programming. A great many theaters of fewer than 600 seats went out of business in the mid-1910s. Feature ﬁlms and picture palaces were mutually enabling and dependent, bound together like the two strands of a double helix. One could not exist without the other: high-volume, high-price exhibition norms gave producers the revenue necessary for making expensive, attractive features with major stars; expensive, attractive features with major stars were necessary to ﬁll large theaters and merit higher ticket prices. The highest-proﬁle early picture palace was the 3,500-seat Strand Theater in Times Square, which opened in mid-1914. It marked the inauguration of a theater building boom across the country. More than just an urban phenomenon, it reshaped the contours of ﬁlm exhibition far and wide. As Zukor commented in 1918, “It is no longer surprising to ﬁnd a $200,000 theater in a town of 25,000 people” (483). Features surged in number after 1914 and by any measure constituted the ﬁlm industry’s dominant product by around 1916. Interestingly, more short ﬁlms were produced in 1915 than in any previous year, but thereafter they declined sharply for several years, ﬁnally settling into a production level consistent with their new role as accompaniments to the main feature (Singer, “Feature”). The proﬁt margin on shorts was slim, and studios that were behind the curve on the industry’s transformation were never able to recover: Kalem and Lubin ceased production in 1916; Edison and Biograph called it quits in 1917; Essanay and Selig closed down in 1918. Vitagraph and Universal were able to survive the transition by focusing on serials (which, while shorts, resembled features in their reliance on high-proﬁle star-centered promotion) and by ramping up feature production. Although stars were a commercial factor in the industry from early in the decade onward, their importance in the ﬁlm industry grew exponentially as\n\n20\n\nBEN SINGER AND CHARLIE KEIL\n\nMary Pickford’s salary is already newsworthy in early 1913, detailed here in the Des Moines News. It would grow 200 times greater in the next ﬁve years.\n\nthe decade progressed. The amazing trajectory of Mary Pickford, the decade’s leading star, drives this point home. When she joined the Biograph Studio in 1909 at the age of seventeen, Pickford’s starting salary was $40 a week, a sizeable income for a young woman, equivalent to four or ﬁve times the earnings of an average public school teacher. Over the next eighteen months, her salary rose to $100 a week. In 1911, Carl Laemmle wooed\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n21\n\nher away to IMP with an offer of $175 a week. After another spell at Biograph, where she earned roughly $200 a week, and then some acting on Broadway, she signed with Adolph Zukor’s Famous Players Company in 1914, starting at roughly $400 a week (a year-long contract of $20,000). Her box ofﬁce appeal soon prompted Zukor to boost her salary to $1,000 a week. Within just a few months, Pickford’s popularity (and her hardnosed business acumen) yielded another successful salary renegotiation: a January 1915 contract gave her $2,000 a week and half the proﬁts of her productions (ten ﬁlms a year). That deal would soon be dwarfed by another one signed in mid-1916: Pickford would earn a guaranteed minimum of nearly $16,200 a week (or, if more lucrative, about a third of a million dollars plus half the proﬁts of her contracted six ﬁlms per year). Additionally, she would be given her own studio, her own production and releasing company (Paramount Artcraft), total choice of cast and crew, top production budgets, and a host of other perks. Astonishingly, Pickford’s star value would soon command even more. Two years later, Pickford signed with Zukor’s key rival, First National, which offered her a package assuring earnings of at least $1 million a year—perhaps $2 million or more factoring in her 50 percent share of box ofﬁce proﬁt—for only three ﬁlms a year. That translates into between $20,000 to $40,000 a week (or between $15 to $30 million a year in today’s dollars) (Wing; U.S. Bureau of the Census, “Index” 91; Hampton 148–49; Balio 160–63). Pickford’s career is far from typical, needless to say. Nevertheless, the very fact that such a salary trajectory was even possible in the 1910s demands attention. It is important to stress that the story of Pickford’s skyrocketing income is not just an early version of the kind of narrative we are familiar with today about, say, a waitress earning minimum wage in Los Angeles getting discovered and catapulting onto the Hollywood A-list. The Pickford phenomenon was utterly unheard of, with no precedent. Indeed, if it merited a newspaper article in 1913 when Pickford was making a jawdropping $200 a week, one can only imagine how mind-boggling it must have been just ﬁve years later when she was making 200 times that much. What accounts for the increased centrality of stars to the commercial and competitive strategies of the ﬁlm industry in the second half of the 1910s? To begin with, producers simply became ever more convinced that stars were the crucial magnet attracting ticket buyers. The industry took its cue from the empirical observation that fans fell in love with stars. The spectator’s sense of personal afﬁnity and connection to a star was, more often than not, what motivated moviegoers’ ﬁlm selections. Other factors, such as the production company or the story, while sometimes important,\n\n22\n\nBEN SINGER AND CHARLIE KEIL\n\nwere secondary considerations. As Zukor noted, “A star is more important than the play [the narrative], for the people know the star and do not commonly know the play” (481). Stars were particularly crucial, as already intimated, in the context of the industry’s new higher-volume, higher-price business model based on bigger, better ﬁlms shown in bigger, better venues. Stars were recognized as the most important signal of a ﬁlm’s presumed “bigness” and quality, and hence tied directly to the high-volume consumption. Leading producers were particularly keen to make ﬁlms capable of capturing income from major ﬁrst-class, ﬁrst-run theaters. Since such theaters had the highest ticket prices, greatest box ofﬁce volume, and an ability to assume the highest possible rental charge, the ﬁrst run was by far the most lucrative (relative to number of screenings), accounting for one-quarter of a ﬁlm’s gross income. Access to ﬁrst-class, ﬁrst-run screens was limited, so failure to attain exhibition in a prime theater meant foregoing that income, losing out on ripple-effect income (ﬁrst-run successes created publicity and boosted subsequent-run proﬁts), and surrendering those beneﬁts to a competitor (Seabury 50). Under such circumstances, the importance of star power was compounded. Paramount, in particular, aimed to monopolize ﬁrst-runs by securing the services of the top-tier stars whose ﬁlms invariably would be chosen by the owners of ﬁrst-class ﬁrst-run theaters. Stars were also central to the drive for market expansion undertaken by Paramount and other industry leaders because growth required expansion into broader demographic sectors—winning over well-to-do audiences— and into all regional and international markets. The industry believed that stars were the key wedges into both. As Zukor noted with respect to the latter, “From [exhibitor feedback] reports, we have learned that a good play will go anywhere; that a star who is popular in Maine will be equally so not only in Arizona but also in England, China, and the Argentine. The whole world loves Mary Pickford” (481). Moreover, star magnetism became especially pertinent with the rise of the feature ﬁlm, since longer narratives demanded greater characterological depth and psychological involvement on the part of spectators if these stories were to hold interest for ﬁve or six reels. The importance of star value grew in proportion to the reliance on longer, more sophisticated, narratives. More concrete business practicalities were also a factor in the ascendancy of stars. Paramount and other distributors had established the practice of block booking, whereby an exhibitor was obliged to rent an entire year’s worth of ﬁlms altogether, sight unseen. This regularized producers’ revenue by protecting them from the risk of losses that would be incurred\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n23\n\nwhen they made a ﬁlm that, for whatever reason, fell far below the anticipated number of rentals. Producers tried to convince exhibitors that block booking was a win-win proposition, since overall rental costs could be reduced. As Hiram Abrams explained, “The exhibitor agreed to take the program of the producer over the contract period. The producer was thus insured against losses, while the exhibitor could have his ﬁlms at a much lower price than if he had been compelled to pay for [a] producer’s losses— for a good picture sold alone would otherwise have had to stand the money wasted on the bad ones” (Abrams 203). Whether or not this was true, exhibitors disliked block booking because it obliged them to buy blind and prevented them from tailoring ﬁlm selections to suit audience preferences in their particular theaters. Throwing star vehicles into the mix made it much easier for producers to sell program blocks. Keen to secure probable hits, exhibitors were more willing to take a gamble on the unknown balance. In the late 1910s, Paramount switched to a modiﬁed version of block booking that they called the “star selective system.” It involved contracting for star-centered blocks, composed of eight pictures a year all featuring the same star. The producer was again protected against unforeseeable losses, but probably the main virtue from the producer’s perspective was that it was an efﬁcient way of passing on the ever-increasing expense of star salaries. Abrams claimed that it was devised in part as a response to exhibitor preferences for smaller blocks, permitting at least some ﬂexibility in program selection. One ﬁnal beneﬁt producers accrued from stars should be mentioned. As the ﬁlm industry became more and more rationalized, studios became increasingly concerned with commercial predictability. Success depended upon the accuracy of two calibrations. First, a ﬁlm’s production budget had to be aligned with its subsequent earnings. As Zukor put it, “Knowing the possible and probable revenue, then we can decide how much money can safely be spent upon production.” Second, producers had to set a ﬁlm’s rental charge so that, relative to its subsequent box ofﬁce performance, it was neither too high (creating angry exhibitors) nor too low (throwing away proﬁt). Studios came to rely upon stars as the most reliable predictors of a ﬁlm’s possible and probable gross, based upon records of past performance. Expensive as they were, stars provided ﬁscal rationality. They were not actually expensive if they enabled outlay and income to be properly attuned. Losing money through inaccurate calibration was much more damaging to the bottom line. Given their utility along these lines, one can better understand why producers were willing to acquiesce to astronomical pay demands by the most consistent performers.\n\n24\n\nBEN SINGER AND CHARLIE KEIL\n\n■■■■■■■■■■\n\nSome Reflections on Reflectionism\n\nScholars often take it for granted that ﬁlms reﬂect the times in which they were made. Such reﬂection, however, can take any number of forms. A ﬁlm might portray contemporaneous news events directly, effecting a kind of reportage about issues of public concern. Many ﬁlms dealing with World War I would be examples in this decade. Or a ﬁlm might engage with social issues and debates of the day, participating overtly in discourses already animating other channels of social commentary. Films advocating Progressive reforms (or, alternately, those highlighting the damage done by sanctimonious meddlers) might fall within this category. Typically, such social problem films forward some clearly communicated didactic position. Alternately, a ﬁlm might tap into topical issues less for the sake of earnest message-mongering than for sensationalism and curiosity value. Many ﬁlms, like those in the white slavery cycle of this decade, harbor some degree of ambiguity in this regard, accommodating opposing assessments of their motivations. Or, as it is commonly argued—probably correctly— ﬁlms can (or cannot help but) reﬂect their cultural moment and inﬂuence spectators’ conceptions of the world, in a more implicit, non-intentionalist way by displaying contemporary customs, norms, manners, lifestyles, trends, fashions, behaviors, tacit assumptions, material environments, consumer ideals, and so on. It is unlikely that a director shooting a thrilling race-to-the-rescue chase between a locomotive and a roadster, incorporating telegraphs, cut phone lines, and so on, proceeded with any consciously formulated objective of reﬂecting “modernity” or the spatio-temporal transformations brought about by new technologies. These elements of iconography are the raw materials for constructing stories and only inadvertently chronicle the cultural milieu. Finally, ﬁlms often reﬂect their times in deliberate but indirect ways that normally fall even further below the threshold of spectator awareness. A case in point would be a kind of negative reﬂectionism underlying what kinds of ﬁlms are not produced at a given historical juncture. One might assume that World War I primarily shaped American cinema through forces of propaganda (motivating depictions of Hun atrocities) or through moderately topical reportage (motivating representations of the experiences of doughboys or of the folks back home). But the war probably shaped American cinema more substantially through producers’ sensitivity to escapist counter-impulses and situational biases. As Adolph Zukor observed in 1918, There are some styles that none of the people want right now. They do not want “costume” plays, fairy stories, or anything that is morbid or depressing.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n25\n\nLa Tosca was exquisitely presented, but it did not take because it was in costume. In these war times, there is enough of the depressing in the air and people go to the movies to be amused. Therefore we have to cut out all costume play, “wig stuff,” and “sob stuff.” At the beginning of the war, war plays were fairly attended, but today the people ﬁnd enough war in the newspapers. They do not care for war drama except in small doses and then only if the scenes are real and there is not too much featuring of some actor who they may think ought to be at the front and not merely playing at being a soldier. (481)\n\nThe chapters that follow aim to elaborate on various facets of cinema’s relation to American social history. Throughout, it should be borne in mind that the two interacted in many different and complicated ways. This volume highlights some of the most illuminating examples of their crucial interrelationship.\n\n1910 Movies, Reform, and New Women SCOTT SIMMON\n\nAt the start of the decade, it was still possible to call “moving pictures” a “passing” fad that “have had their day” and to classify them alongside the roller skating craze, as did the feminist reformer Rheta Childe Dorr (228). But others saw the movies growing into the new century’s deﬁning mode of entertainment, and perhaps destined for something more. Typical, in both its awe over the phenomenon and its worry over unruly audiences and under-regulated ﬁlms, was a magazine piece titled “A Theatre with a 5,000,000 Audience”: Squads of police are necessary in many places to keep in line the expectant throngs awaiting their turn to enter the inner glories. . . . Five million people are thought to be in daily attendance at the picture shows. If it is a matter of public concern what sort of plays are run on the stage and what sort of articles are published in the newspapers and magazines, it is surely important that the subject-matter of the most popular medium of reaching the people be at least not degrading.\n\nThis chapter looks into a few of the more revealing movies of the year—a year without any agreed-upon canonical masterworks—and into some of the fears and dreams that movies inspired, but it helps ﬁrst to remember what it was like to live then. Because it was a federal census year, it is possible to characterize life in the United States with a little more precision than usual. The population was less than a third of what it is today, some 92 million. The frontier lingered: the Paciﬁc and Mountain West remained male-dominated (with 130 men per 100 women), while New England had more women than men. European immigration had declined from its peak of three years earlier in the face of nativist resentments and labor union pressures, although close to two million entered during the year, most settling in larger cities. Immigrants and children of immigrants made up roughly three-quarters of the population of most large eastern cities, including New York, Boston, Chicago, and 26\n\n1910 — MOVIES, REFORM, AND NEW WOMEN\n\n27\n\nDetroit. For all the focus in the muckraking press on the problems of crowded cities, however, America was still predominantly a rural and small-town country: more than half the nation lived in communities of less than 2,500. Agriculture remained the largest occupation, accounting for some 12 million of the nation’s 37 million workers, but if one includes manufacturing, construction, and mining in “industry,” that adds up to another 11 million in occupations that were often dangerous: about 25,000 were killed in industrial accidents during the year (U.S. Bureau of the Census, “Thirteenth” 21, 54–55, 93–94, 98; Cashman, Ascendant 90, 67; Schlereth 55). Rapid communication and transportation were still available only to a few. Eighty-ﬁve percent of homes lacked electricity; there was one telephone for every ninety people; less than 5 percent of eighteen- to twentyone-year-olds went on to college (Schlereth 115; Cooper 136–37). The number of automobiles had grown to almost half a million (from fewer than ten thousand at the turn of the century), but that meant just one for every two hundred people (Cooper 133). Long-distance travel meant taking the railroads; travel within cities generally meant taking streetcars or trolleys. Rural travel meant walking or riding a horse, mule, or horsedrawn wagon. Even New York City had a horse population sufﬁcient—as one of the era’s intrepid statisticians calculated—to deposit three million pounds of manure and sixty thousand gallons of urine on its streets every day (Schlereth 20, 24). With the year’s ﬁrst tests of electric “self-starters” in place of hand cranks on cars, driving was opening more widely to women (Cooper 134). Seven million of the nation’s wage earners were women, who still had voting rights in only four sparsely populated western states. The November election added one more western state, Washington. More signiﬁcant, however, was the increased shift toward a national suffrage campaign, including more activist tactics by the women’s movement, such as the ﬁrst large U.S. suffrage marches and a petition to Congress signed by 400,000 asking for an equal voting-rights amendment to the constitution (Flexner and Fitzpatrick 242–48). Economically, it was a prosperous time, following the recession of 1907–08. American Federation of Labor unions had tripled in size since the turn of century, to 1.5 million members (Cooper 145). “Reform”—of cities, business practices, and the excesses of wealth—was in the air, even if few agreed on what it meant. President William Howard Taft, who had taken ofﬁce the year previous, was more of an activist trustbuster than his predecessor, Theodore Roosevelt, but lacked the former president’s charisma,\n\n28\n\nSCOTT SIMMON\n\nnotwithstanding his 350 pounds. (“When I hear someone say ‘Mr. President,’ Taft told an aide, “I look around expecting to see Roosevelt” [Cashman, Age 98].) The national midterm election ushered in a decade of Democratic control, with Taft’s Republican Party ceding the House of Representatives for the ﬁrst time in sixteen years and losing ten seats in the ninety-two-man Senate. Among Democrats swept into ofﬁce were future presidents Woodrow Wilson (as New Jersey governor) and Franklin D. Roosevelt (as a New York state senator).\n\n■■■■■■■■■■\n\nAudiences, Stars, and the Birth of Hollywood\n\nGoing to the movies at the start of the decade most often meant going to nickelodeons, an accurate enough name in terms of ticket prices, although ten cents was becoming common in larger cities. The year saw many reports about the demise of live popular theater, and with surprisingly little lament. A New York Times article, “Moving Pictures Sound Melodrama’s Knell,” asked, “Why pay 30 cents to see a rehash of an ancient theme by an obsolete troupe of archaic players when for 10 cents the village critic can see . . . a play by Shakespeare with all the appearances and vanishings of Banquo’s ghost or Puck effectively wrought by the ﬁlm art?” Both entertainment options sound inexpensive, but one must take into account that average percapita income was $517. Reformers were not amused. Dour accounts of the typical moviegoing experience regularly appeared in muckraking periodicals like McClure’s Magazine, which reported that “the moving-picture show has become a problem in all large cities,” especially because “the managers paid no attention to ventilation” (Hendrick 383). Health magazine fretted over “eye strain,” “unsanitary conditions,” “foul air,” as well as “another aspect . . . which we hesitate to discuss. . . . The performances being of necessity given in a darkened house, opportunity for undue familiarity between the sexes is afforded” (“Moving Pictures”). Few others hesitated to dwell on the opportunities dark theaters afforded for fraternizing between the sexes. The key technical fact about American movies in the immediate prefeature era—central to both moviegoing this year and to the sense one can feel today of these ﬁlms’ desperate narrative compression—is that virtually all ﬁlms were standardized at “one reel” in length (that is, from about 700 feet to a maximum of 1,050 feet of 35 mm ﬁlm). This meant that the longest ﬁlms, seen at the slowest of the variable projection speeds, would run about seventeen minutes. Most ﬁlms were shorter, and from these\n\n1910 — MOVIES, REFORM, AND NEW WOMEN\n\n29\n\nbuilding blocks theater managers constructed their shows, sometimes by mixing in vaudeville acts but usually by interspersing ﬁlms with songs— typically this year three reels of ﬁlm divided by two songs (Altman 182–93; Abel 127–33; Bowser 191). Films were virtually everywhere, not only in schools, YMCAs, and department stores. On Sundays in Manhattan’s 1,600-seat Grace Methodist Episcopal Church, life-of-Jesus “Passion Play” ﬁlms were “thrown on the screen just back of the pulpit.” On other days the church showed more secular movies on the theory “that if the people ﬁll the building throughout the week they will be more likely to ﬁll it on Sundays” (“Pictures in Church”). Contrary to the nervous troubles predicted for viewers by Health, the Nebraska state asylum for the insane installed a projector because “these pictures appear to soothe patients and . . . they can watch them without the exciting effects of other forms of diversion” (“Pictures to Soothe Insane”). A screen was installed for bored commuters in Pittsburgh’s central railroad station, with ﬁlms changed daily, if subjected to one bit of censorship: “‘There will be no pictures of train robberies,’ said Albert Swinehart, who is in charge of the Pennsylvania Railroad detectives, ‘nor of train wrecks. It would leave a bad impression on the minds of the travelers’” (“Films for Commuters”). At nickelodeons, moviegoers came to know on which days of the week new ﬁlms from their favorite companies were shown; the most popular were from Vitagraph and Biograph. Sadly for today’s viewers, a huge ﬁre in July at Vitagraph’s Manhattan studio ignited the company’s entire twelveyear library—one factor in the poor survival rate now of Vitagraph ﬁlms (“150 Trapped”). This was also the year when the monopolistic Motion Picture Patents Company—known to most simply as “the Trust”—was at its most powerful, but behind the scenes came the ﬁrst hints that the industry was already growing out of its control. An early indication of the emerging star system came when Carl Laemmle’s aggressive Independent Moving Picture Company (known by its IMP or “Imp” acronym) tempted away the most recognizable actresses— Florence Lawrence and then eighteen-year-old Mary Pickford—from the Biograph Company, which was holding out against mention of its actors’ names. Lawrence, the “Biograph Girl,” had jumped to IMP near the end of the previous year, and it was in March that the company sprang the era’s best-remembered publicity stunt, planting news stories of her death and then piously refuting them in “We Nail a Lie” advertisements (Bowser 112; Abel 232–33). The term “star” seems to have ﬁrst been applied to ﬁlm actors early this year, and a February Los Angeles Times article described how fans\n\n30\n\nSCOTT SIMMON\n\nrecognized favorite players even when ﬁlms and promotional posters lacked credits: “Regular patrons of the many moving picture theaters of the city— and most of the patrons are regulars—have learned to know the different characters of the pictures, and no matter what character is assumed by the actors, their mannerisms are easily detected. . . . To see those whom they have learned to know, large numbers of them ﬂock to the motion picture theaters.” The headline added that “Real Stars May Be Seen in Los Angeles, Too.” That is, movie patrons—“these same young persons”—could “stroll through the lobbies of half a dozen Los Angeles hotels” and “encounter the majority of the characters they have admired upon the screen” (“New Hero”). As another February Los Angeles Times article noted about location shooting, “The participants have been handicapped by the number of spectators. That is one of the things most dreaded by the picture actors” (“In the Motion”). Movie fan culture had evidently arrived. The L.A. dateline of such news items seems unremarkable now, but that winter of 1909–10 was the ﬁrst time major ﬁlmmaking companies put down roots on the West Coast. With the Trust companies and Independents together supplying about ﬁfty ﬁlms a week, studios couldn’t dream of slowing for the winter. The Los Angeles Times already trumpeted that the “Climate and Scenic Settings Here are Ideal” for motion pictures in February, when it counted “upward of 200” production personnel in the city. With the many new warm-weather studio locations—including IMP in Cuba, Méliès in San Antonio, Vitagraph in San Diego, and Essanay in northern California—few would yet have guessed that “Hollywood” alone would win out and become synonymous with American studio ﬁlmmaking, but the Times exhibited a prescient boosterism in talking about the touring companies: “At ﬁrst they came here to escape the snow and ice, but the bright quality of the sunshine and the number of clear days in which they may work, together with the variety of scenery, has all been found ideal, and their making here is now permanent” (“In the Motion”). Those ﬁrst fan-culture articles also give hints about who was going to the movies this year. To judge from commentaries and a precious few surveys, what was new about the audiences, especially in comparison with those who attended live melodrama and vaudeville, was the increased proportion of children and young women, and notably from the working classes. It’s anecdotally evident too that most polite society did not deign to go to nickelodeons—although they would willingly see movies in lecture halls and the other socially acceptable venues. Even the industry paper Moving Picture World admitted in April, “It cannot be pretended that as yet the\n\n1910 — MOVIES, REFORM, AND NEW WOMEN\n\n31\n\nmoving picture in any of its phases has attracted the sympathetic notice and patronage of the educated classes” (“Educated”). The relatively short duration of nickelodeon programs—typically about an hour this year—also meant that workers were able to squeeze in time for movies, even when only 8 percent of them had a regular schedule of forty-eight hours a week or less (Cashman, Ascendant 96). A survey by the reformist Russell Sage Foundation about the mill town of Homestead, Pennsylvania, discovered that “many people . . . ﬁnd in the nickelodeon their only relaxation. . . . On a Saturday afternoon visit to a nickelodeon, which advertised that it admitted two children on one ticket, I was surprised to ﬁnd a large proportion of men in the audience” (Byington 111). Though this report’s author was taken aback by the number of men in the audience, worried reformers focused much more on children and female viewers. A survey of a Connecticut town at the end of the year found 90 percent of children ten to fourteen going to the movies, more than half attending once a week or more, and over a third going without a parent or guardian (Jump). Percentages in a survey by New York City’s reformist People’s Institute were higher, with “fully three-quarters of the children” attending at least once a week (Inglis). Concerns about children centered on their exposure to films about crime, and a seemingly endless series of news stories bemoaned how previously angelic kids spiraled downward toward their destruction because of the movies. “Turned to Arson by Moving Pictures” told of a twelve-year-old girl who twice set fire to her Bronx apartment house after her father failed to pay the $50 demanded by an extortion note she left for him signed by “the Black Hand” (the popular name for the Italian mafia, especially in movies). She told the judge she had devised the scheme by combining plots from two films. Her hapless father, who had taken her to those movies himself, received a stern lecture from the judge: “Fathers should be very careful about such things and see to it that pictures that exert evil influence are not seen by their children.” Pittsburgh officials blamed a rash of streetcar crimes on popular western movies that depicted daring stagecoach robberies. The New York Times concluded in August that the growth in such crimes could only be explained by the hypnotic power of film on the susceptible young (“Moving Picture Hypnosis”). Recurring worries about the morals of teenaged girls and young women permeated such accounts, prompting claims that their repeated attendance at movies would lead to the compromising of those morals. Because they could be paid less, women had for some time been replacing male workers\n\n32\n\nSCOTT SIMMON\n\nin increasingly mechanized factories, and for more than a decade women had dominated the sales force in department stores (Schlereth 57, 151). The special problem for reformers was that long working hours meant that young women were now going to the movies unchaperoned in the late evenings, too. A survey taken this year of Chicago shopgirl life found a typical working day of nine or ten hours for salaries ranging from $2.50 to $11 a week (with much of that given to parents), leaving the inexpensive movies one of the few entertainment options and the evenings almost the only time to go. The president of Chicago’s Juvenile Protective Association in reporting on this survey warned that in nickelodeons “the darkness afforded a cover for familiarity and sometimes even for immorality” (de Koven Bowen 56, 14). One of the year’s best-selling novels, Reginald Wright Kauffman’s The House of Bondage, ﬂeshed out this narrative. Its heroine, Mary, a high school senior in a small Pennsylvania town, allows herself to be taken to a nickelodeon by a handsome Hungarian immigrant. The chase comedy they watch seems unobjectionable, but it is shot in New York City and the chase goes past the Waldorf and Park Avenue hotels, plunging Mary into a “fairyland” of riches. Twenty pages later, she’s in Lower Manhattan, her drink drugged, and the next morning she wakes up naked in a strange brass bed, her face in the mirror “alien, a ruin, an accusation.” Her life as a prostitute spirals downward for the next four hundred pages (Kauffman 27, 53). Lest anyone think the novel exaggerated, later editions reprinted as an appendix the June ﬁndings of a New York grand jury—known as the Rockefeller Report—on the “white slave trafﬁc.” “Mention should be made,” the report said, “of the moving picture shows as furnishing to this class of persons [the ‘so-called pimp’] an opportunity for leading girls into a life of shame. . . . In spite of the activities of the authorities in watching these places, many girls owe their ruin to frequenting them” (Kauffman 475–76). The same month, Judge Frederick B. House made a sweeping indictment: “Ninety-ﬁve percent of the moving picture houses in New York are dens of iniquity. More young women and girls are led astray in these places than in any other way” (“Unwarranted”). While commentators feared the inﬂuence of moviegoing on young women, a few pointed out how women might be inﬂuencing motion pictures. As Bertha Richardson suggested in her revision of The Woman Who Spends: A Study of Her Economic Function, women were a growing force in “the economics of consumption, otherwise known as the spending of their money” (21). The nickels from new audiences added up, and the year saw active, heroic female leads take the screen.\n\n1910 — MOVIES, REFORM, AND NEW WOMEN\n\n■■■■■■■■■■\n\n33\n\nNew Heroines\n\nBy this time, ﬁlm audiences had already grown accustomed to genres— relatively formulized plot patterns. As Eileen Bowser points out, in this era when nickelodeon programs always were built from several short ﬁlms, exhibitors expected to receive new ﬁlms in three large genre categories— comedies, dramas, and westerns. A “balanced program” of genres was the ideal (Bowser 167–68). Below we look into a few genre ﬁlms as well as a couple of less easily classiﬁable titles, and take as our guides the year’s many female heroines: in the social drama A Child of the Ghetto, the westerns Ramona and The Red Girl and the Child, the Civil War ﬁlm The House with Closed Shutters, the Shakespeare adaptation Twelfth Night, and the advertising ﬁlm The Stenographer’s Friend. One fact needs noting about the ﬁlms of this year: more than in any other except 1909, ﬁlm survival distorts ﬁlm history. It is not possible to say with any precision how many ﬁlms in total were made in the United States this year—there are no surviving production records for most companies and most nonﬁction ﬁlm types—but it would be a reasonable guess that at least 3,000 ﬁlms were released. (This impressive number is less surprising when one remembers that most theaters changed programs daily and that the Trust and Independent distribution “exchanges” competed, each with a full slate of releases.) Another fair guess would be that at least 90 percent of these titles are now “lost”—that is, all copies were thrown away, allowed to deteriorate, or burned in such ﬁres as the one at Vitagraph. This has been the common fate of the ﬁrst thirty-ﬁve years of ﬁlmmaking worldwide, but the particular distortions this year come from an unusual imbalance. Films directed by D. W. Grifﬁth for the Biograph Company represent more than one-quarter of the surviving U.S. ﬁction ﬁlms of 1910, well over half the year’s U.S. ﬁlms of all types currently viewable in archives, and more than three-quarters of the year’s U.S. titles currently viewable outside of archives. A full history would want to correct this imbalance, but one-reel ﬁlms from the pre-feature era remain difﬁcult enough to see under any circumstances, and so I have chosen titles to discuss below mainly from among those available on video. It is compensation that, this year at least, Grifﬁth’s ﬁlms are unrivaled in stylistic sophistication, if not in their range of subjects. Some of the year’s most fascinating ﬁlms are in a genre that doesn’t have a precise name: docudramas of social reform, melodramatic reﬂections of the concerns of the Progressive Era, such as Grifﬁth’s Simple Charity, which contrasts “the red tape” of reform societies with an impoverished\n\n34\n\nSCOTT SIMMON\n\nDorothy West (in shawl, foreground) on Rivington Street, Manhattan, in A Child of the Ghetto.\n\nwoman’s selﬂessness. Grifﬁth’s A Child of the Ghetto manages to be both a documentary-inﬂected look at social problems and a timeless fable. It opens in a dingy tenement room in Manhattan’s Jewish ghetto, as a girl in her late teens (Dorothy West) watches her mother die. “SHE MUST FIGHT LIFE’S BATTLE ALONE ,” an intertitle tells us as the girl ventures among “THE STRUGGLERS ” of Rivington Street.1 The documentary exterior shot, like several in the ﬁlm, is evidently taken with a hidden camera in a street crowded with pushcart peddlers and shoppers, and it takes a moment to spot the actress among them. In a ghetto garment shop, she picks up home-assembly work, but when she brings back the ﬁnished goods, the owner’s son plants on her money stolen from his father’s wallet—leading to the presumption of her guilt and pursuit by a policeman, Ofﬁcer Quinn. She loses him on the Lower East Side and hops a trolley into the country, where she ﬂees along a dirt road until collapsing outside the gate of a rural home. Rescued by a farmer and his mother, she “LEARNS TO SMILE ” and to ﬁnd love. Some time later, Ofﬁcer Quinn heads out for “A DAY’S FISHING ” and stops for water at that very farm. (Such coincidence is at the core of melodrama.) The ﬁlm toys with suspense—through staging and cutting—ﬁrst over whether\n\n1910 — MOVIES, REFORM, AND NEW WOMEN\n\n35\n\nQuinn will see the young woman and, after he does, whether he will remember who she is. Quinn ﬁnally does puzzle out the mystery and runs back to make the arrest. But her pleas, or perhaps just the country atmosphere, make him hesitate, and when the farmer walks up, Quinn pretends to search for something lost in the grass to explain his return. He strolls back to the river with a smile. The ﬁlm, like so many this year, draws from America’s long cultural clash between urban modernity and rural traditionalism. The speed with which ﬁlms were made and released meant that it was easy for them to react to contemporary events. A Child of the Ghetto may have drawn one inspiration from the New York City garment workers strike known in labor history as the “Uprising of the Twenty Thousand,” which was settled in February. Especially newsworthy—thanks to the backing from Manhattan socialites—was the strike’s leadership by the teenaged Clara Lemlich, who used Yiddish to rally the strikers, young women earning about six dollars a week (Howe 295–300). Filmed two months after the conclusion of the strike and released to theaters in June, A Child of the Ghetto feels like a nostalgic recuperation of the sympathy shown by the public—and no doubt especially by nickelodeon audiences—to the plight of young garment workers. A slatternly landlady shoos the girl into the streets after her mother’s death, a melodramatic enactment of the fact that housing for “ﬁghting life’s battle alone” was simply not affordable on one garment worker’s salary. (About 90 percent of female factory workers and clerks lived with other family members [Peiss 52, 204].) “Child” is not the name one would apply now to the ﬁlm’s teenaged heroine, but it ties into questions of child labor being debated in this year’s midterm elections (Cooper 159). Unlike the ﬁlm’s documentary snapshot of the city, the rural world— with its lazy river, broad shade trees, and grazing cows—comes across as a timeless “pastoral” (a genre category in Biograph’s advertisements this year for In the Season of Buds and A Summer Idyl). Three dancing girls, dressed in white, laughing, waving blossoming branches, are presumably younger sisters of the farmer but also symbols of the bucolic freedom thus far denied the immigrant city girl. The ﬁlm’s solution will be to integrate the Jewish girl into a country home (just as the Irish cop Quinn represents an earlier wave of assimilated immigrants) and to protest the masculine bustle of commerce via female images. (Biograph ﬁlms this year are less sympathetic to men who complain of the urban system, as in The Iconoclast, where a printing plant worker’s sarcastic gestural style illustrates—in the words of the company’s publicity—how “selﬁshness is the seed of irrational socialism, nurtured mainly by laziness and, very often, drink.”) Social reformers\n\n36\n\nSCOTT SIMMO"
