In fact, the movie rates as somewhat disappointing, considering the talents involved. Both the screenplay and the movie itself really needed even sharper editing than that given the 91-minute American version. Van Johnson himself put up half the money to make the film, but I very much doubt of he received any dividends.

[The Warner Archive plan a DVD release in 2012].\n\nSYNOPSIS: While campaigning for the governorship of a southern state, Bo Gillis, a folksy politician, falls in love with and marries, Ada, a reformed prostitute, whose dubious background alarms both Bo’s press agent, Steve Jackson, and his political advisor, Sylvester Marin.\n\nCOMMENT: Despite its name cast, this movie seems to be totally forgotten today. True, it’s a curate’s egg of a picture, and not one that’s likely to send Dean’s fans into raptures. He sings a snatch of a song right at the beginning and that’s it as far as Dino’s harmonizing is concerned. His performance is great, but halfway through he drops out of the action for quite a spell while Susan Hayward takes control.\n\nAnd what a naïve perspective the scriptwriters have of legislature procedure as Susan is sworn in as lieutenant-governor! And director Daniel Man’s relentless use of Hayward close-ups (even in tracking shots) doesn’t help either.\n\nNonetheless, Wilfrid Hyde-White has a field day. Admittedly, his dialogue is the sharpest and most interesting in the picture. Maybe he brought his own writer along to the set. Maybe he wrote it himself. In a lesser role, Ralph Meeker’s fascinating performance as a slimy police chief also deserves watching.\n\nAs said above, Ruttenberg’s superb cinematography is often wasted on ineffective close-ups, but CinemaScope does come to the fore in some of the location set-ups in what certainly look like real government buildings and legislative chambers. These scenes, plus the cab trip and our first exposure to the executive office, give the film much-needed dramatic effectiveness plus an engrossingly taut political atmosphere. What a shame, it’s so often undermined!\n\n--\n\nAdvance to the Rear (1964)\n\nGlenn Ford (Captain Jared Heath), Stella Stevens (Martha Lou), Melvyn Douglas (Colonel Claude Brackenby), Jim Backus (General Willoughby), Joan Blondell (Jenny), Andrew Prine (Private Owen Selous), Jesse Pearson (Corporal Silas Geary), Alan Hale (Sergeant Beauregard Davis), James Griffith (Hugo Zattig), Whit Bissell (Captain Queeg), Michael Pate (Thin Elk), Yvonne Craig (Ora), Chuck Roberson (Monk), Bill Troy (Fulton), Frank Mitchell (Belmont), J.

[The Warner Archive plan a DVD for 2012].\n\nU.K. release title: COMPANY OF COWARDS (cut to 86 minutes).\n\nSpoiler Alert! COMPLETE SYNOPSIS: During the Civil War a Union Army general officer has a comfortable encampment and a pleasant agreement with the enemy: every morning his company fires at them, they fire back, and no one gets hurt. When finally he is ordered to attack, his horse bolts and charges to the rear with the infantry following. As punishment for his apparent cowardice, he is put in charge of a company of misfits and sent west to Indian Territory. Through an error, the fact that his unit is replacing one that is protecting Union gold has been overlooked. The men journey westward by riverboat and are joined by a group of camp followers led by Easy Jenny and including Martha Lou Williams, a Confederate spy. A romance develops between Martha Lou and Captain Jared Heath, though he perceives her devious purpose. Her efforts to obtain information, while retaining her virtue, produce a result in which the misfits lose their horses, their pants, and the Union gold to a group of renegades. Undertaking a countercharge in their long underwear, they then lose their weapons, but using their eccentric talents to defend themselves, they save the gold by building and using a catapult.\n\nNOTES: Jack Schaefer expanded Chamberlain’s short story into a novel Company of Cowards which was published in 1957. The property was acquired by producer Charles Schnee as a vehicle for Hugh O’Brian. M-G-M inherited the package and announced on 11 April 1957 that Rod Serling would write the screenplay. He didn’t!\n\nCOMMENT: Good entertainment (70%). The cast was appealing — who could resist Stella Stevens and Melvyn Douglas? Glenn Ford was at his most amiable and the support cast including Australia’s Michael Pate (was his voice dubbed?) as a villainous Red Indian, was delightful (did you spot Eddie Quillan in an uncredited though sizable bit as a Confederate corporal?); we also liked Alan Hale’s easy-going impression of a conscience-stricken sergeant and James Griffith’s glumly philosophical man-who-has-his-price. However, Joan Blondell’s admirers will be disappointed by the smallness of her part. The script is amusing enough — it has some lively situations and witty dialogue. George Marshall’s direction is capable and there is a jocund music score which cleverly adds to the humor of almost every scene.\n\n--\n\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn (1960)\n\nEddie Hodges (Huckleberry Finn), Archie Moore (Jim), Tony Randall (the king), Patty McCormack (Joanna Wilks), Neville Brand (Pap Finn), Mickey Shaughnessy (the duke), Judy Canova (sheriff’s wife), Andy Devine (Carmody), Sherry Jackson (Mary Jane Wilks), Buster Keaton (lion tamer), Finlay Currie (Captain Sellers), Parley Baer (Grangerford man), Josephine Hutchinson (Widow Douglas), John Carradine, Dean Stanton (slave catchers), Dolores Hawkins (river boat singer), Sterling Holloway (barber), Minerva Urecal (Miss Watson), Royal Dano (sheriff), Sam McDaniel (servant).\n\nDirector: MICHAEL CURTIZ.

[Warner Archive plan a DVD for 2012].\n\nSYNOPSIS: Hannibal, Missouri, 1840s. Daredevil youngster runs away from home.\n\nCOMMENT: Taking a leaf out of his father’s book, producer Samuel Goldywn, Jr., has spared no expense in bringing Huckleberry so artistically and excitingly to the big screen. Odd that this version has slipped into obscurity, because it’s undoubtedly the best of the batch. Not only is the familiar story given fresh life by a first-rate cast, but Curtiz and McCord have imbued the movie with exactly the right atmosphere. A great music score and superb art direction help too. Who could forget such scenes as the deserted river-boat, tilted at a crazy angle, lapped in the green slime of the swamp, its lantern swinging horribly in the room of death; or that on board the steamer as Finlay Currie expounds in his beautifully resonant voice the splendor and treachery of the Missisippi?\n\n--\n\nAdventures of Quentin Durward (1955)\n\nRobert Taylor (Quentin Durward), Kay Kendall (Isabelle), Robert Morley (Louis XI), Alec Clunes (Burgundy), Marius Goring (de Creville), Wilfrid Hyde White (Master Oliver), Ernest Thesiger (Lord Crawford), Harcourt Williams (bishop of Liege), Duncan Lamont (de la Marck), Laya Raki (Gypsy dancer), George Cole (Hayraddin), Eric Pohlmann (gluckmeister), Michael Goodliffe (Count de Dunois), John Carson (Duke of Orleans), Nicholas Hannen (Cardinal Balue), Frank Tickle (Petit-Andre), Moultrie Kelsall (Lord Malcolm), Billy Shine (Trois-Eschelles).\n\nDirector: RICHARD THORPE. Screenplay: Robert Ardrey. Adapted by George Froeschel from the 1823 novel by Sir Walter Scott. Photographed in Eastman Color and CinemaScope by Christopher Challis. Film editor: Ernest Walter. Art director: Alfred Junge. Costumes designed by Elizabeth Haffenden. Music: Bronislau Kaper. Sound recording supervisor: A.W. Watkins. Producer: Pandro S. Berman.\n\nCopyright 1955 by Loew’s Inc. An M-G-M picture. U.S. release: 21 October 1955. New York opening at the Mayfair: 23 November 1955. U.K. release: 26 March 1956. Australian release: 11 April 1956. Sydney opening at the St James. 9,011 feet. 100 minutes.\n\nU.S. and Australian release title: QUENTIN DURWARD.\n\nSYNOPSIS: Refusing to marry her aged suitor, a duke’s ward flees to the king.\n\nNOTES: M-G-M embarked on a movie version of Sir Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe in 1952. (This marked the first time any Scott novel had been filmed since way back in 1923). Its enormous box-office success prompted Quentin Durward. Both these films were directed by super-fast, economy-conscious Richard Thorpe, who also turned his hand to M-G-M’s first CinemaScope production, Knights of the Round Table (1953). These three movies all share two other features— they were all lensed in England and all starred Robert Taylor.\n\nCOMMENT: Knighthood is indeed in full flower in this handsomely produced, energetically directed adaptation of Sir Walter Scott’s classic novel of a Scottish swordsman’s adventures at the French court. Mind you, Robert Taylor is certainly no Scot, but he plays the role with such dash and finesse, it really doesn’t matter that his accent is all wrong for the part. And he’s helped out by a truly wonderful support cast, including the lovely, high-spirited yet suitably vulnerable Kay Kendall in an ideal role, and Robert Morley perfectly at home as the crafty king.\n\nExcept for one unfortunate scene (the rape of the monastery), director Richard Thorpe and screenwriter Robert Ardrey keep a nice balance between adventure and comedy. With the exception of this one scene, the film maintains the right flavor of derring-do and then comes to a really fine action climax in a blazing bell-tower, which really knocked us blasé critics right out of our seats. The sets and color ’Scope photography are most attractive. Whatever, you do, don’t bother to see this movie in a non-’Scope print. An excellent ’Scope DVD is available from Warner Archive.\n\n--\n\nAll the Fine Young Cannibals (1960)\n\nRobert Wagner (Chad Bixby), Natalie Wood (Salome), Susan Kohner (Catherine), George Hamilton (Tony), Pearl Bailey (Ruby), Jack Mullaney (Tinker), Onslow Stevens (Joshua Davis), Virginia Gregg (Mrs Davis), Anne Seymour (Mrs Bixby), Addison Richards (McDowell), Mabel Albertson (wife), Louise Beavers (Rose).\n\nDirector: MICHAEL ANDERSON.

Australian release: 29 August 1960. 10,990 feet; 122 minutes.\n\nSYNOPSIS: Physically and mentally scarred by the cruelty of his clergyman father, Chad Bixby turns to Salome, the hard-working daughter of poor and puritanical Joshua Davis; but she rejects him and flees to New York, where she marries a playboy student.\n\nCOMMENT: Even a few songs from Pearl Bailey and a few snatches of hot trumpet-playing cannot save this hoke. All four principals are both uninspired and unconvincing. The plot is a tired amalgam of trite clichés, and director Anderson (who has slipped a long, long way from his peak with Around the World in 80 Days) seems as utterly bored with the absurdly melodramatic proceedings as we are. Ludicrous, preposterous and utterly ridiculous, this movie is every bit as boring as its catchpenny title suggests. I’m glad to say that no DVD is available at present, but beware if it does hit the stores in the future.\n\n--\n\nthe Angry Hills (1959)\n\nRobert Mitchum (Mike Morrison), Elisabeth Mueller (Lisa), Stanley Baker (Konrad Heisler), Gia Scala (Eletheria), Theodore Bikel (Tassos), Sebastian Cabot (Chesney), Peter Illing (Leonides), Leslie Phillips (Ray Taylor), Sir Donald Wolfit (Dr Stergiou), Marius Goring (Colonel Oberg), Jackie Lane (Maria), Kieron Moore (Andreas).\n\nDirector: ROBERT ALDRICH.

This would certainly explain the totally inept concluding sequences, but not the general slackness and lack of suspense throughout the last hour or so of a rather rambling yarn. (Even an attempt to tighten the movie still further has worked no magic. The print under review runs 97 minutes).\n\nSome of the acting is best described as hesitant. Aldrich states in a rather roundabout way (he blames himself rather than the actor) that Mitchum was totally uncooperative, although it is really only in the last third of the movie that Mitchum suddenly decides to stop taking direction. Up to that point, he is quite acceptable. Perhaps he simply lost confidence in the script. Indeed, until the sudden introduction of Elizabeth Mueller, the screenplay is one of Bezzerides’ best. The plot deploys some memorable characters and out-of-the rut dialogue. I particularly enjoyed Marius Goring’s brilliant portrait of a punctilious, hypochondriacal German major who dreams of a little man as big as his thumb.\n\nThe first half of the movie is all directed in an appropriately bravura style. A swinging light in a museum sequence, heralds a really breath-catching chase scene. The interrogation sequence with Baker running his finger along the map, the night raid and the execution episodes are also prime examples of Aldrich’s masterly directorial flair.\n\nNo DVD version is available as we go to press.\n\n--\n\nAround the World Under the Sea (1966)"
