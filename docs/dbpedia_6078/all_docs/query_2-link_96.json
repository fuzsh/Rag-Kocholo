Through Dick, I had the opportunity to work with Henry Mancini and chat with him when he came to town to conduct his most popular TV and motion picture scores. I learned what it was like to be a studio musician during that time period. And though as my idol, the pianist and film composer Oscar Levant, has remarked, I was but “a cog in the wheel,” nevertheless, the experience was exciting and taught me a great deal about collaboration and the vicissitudes and complexities of being part of a film production. This insider’s perspective also shaped me as a music critic. I say this because the film score inevitably and always operates within an intricate web of interrelated texts, a dependency that, on the one hand, immediately expands and problematizes the critical boundaries of the text but that also, on the other, enlivens the study of film music and gives it its greatest appeal. That music does not dominate the screen does not lessen its impact or importance. To interpret the film and its score is to expose the manipulative nature of music, how it functions and operates within its wider ecosystem. Music’s relationship, whether subliminal, covert, inaudible, direct, or indirect within the film’s complexity, gives music its greatest advantage for the critic by invoking a vast network of signification, associations, and connections within and outside\n\nPreface\n\nthe filmic system and therefore provides a highly rich interpretive pallet from which to draw cultural meaning. It elevates and celebrates musical function to reveal how in a multitude of ways music can create meaning. In this context, music has never been more vital. Concealed behind this textual complexity, operating within a film’s production, is a panoply of collaborations, artistic and technical partnerships that on the surface do not reveal the artistic decision-making process involved in the production. Hidden layers of procedures, conflicts, negotiations, struggles, and power relations are invested in the final musical score, a condition that other scholars, such as Ronald H. Sadoff and Nathan Platte, have discussed. Aaron Copland and Hanns Eisler fully understood that film production was a collaborative affair, even though they resisted it in their writings and in their scores, a posture that reflected their personal biases and perspectives. As a scholar, however, no matter how conscientiously I acknowledge these collaborative processes, my ability to penetrate all of their complexities can only succeed within the limitations of the sources available. In film musicology, the presumption of single authorship has been blamed for perpetuating canon building, itself a disciplinary blunder that opens up numerous political questions around status, prestige, and ethics. Ben Winters has written perceptively on this delicate issue. In the two scores I am considering in this study, we know that many types of collaborations shaped the final product. Copland and Eisler, in their own accounts, reveal some of these layers and entanglements. Yet, as is the predicament for all historians, we do not always have the sources to track the various relationships and contestations. Copland’s and Eisler’s own descriptions must be subjected to critical evaluation, and they cannot always be weighed against independent sources, including those that represent others who participated in creating the final score. Against the idea that these collaborations exist and played an essential role, I use Copland’s and Eisler’s personal autograph scores (themselves negotiated sites of contention), which coincide with the recorded commercially released film in the United States. In this study, I seek not to build up these scores as important monuments of aesthetic glory. Instead, I hope to present a critical perspective about the state of one aspect of American modernism during the late 1930s and early 1940s and a means to understand Copland’s and Eisler’s political orientations through their associations with Hollywood.\n\nx\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nLike the curious and political publication history of Hanns Eisler’s Composing for the Films, this book too has taken an unusual and circuitous path toward its final publication. The long and winding road has not always been easily trodden, but in the process, I truly found wonderful friends and colleagues who supported me, especially when the going got tough. Early on, Michael Denning, Peter Burkholder, Carol Oja, Howard Pollack, Judith Tick, Mitchell Morris, and Leta Miller provided mentorship and support, as did David Nicolls, whose great sense of humor and friendship sustained me and still does. I am grateful to Joy Calico, Arved Ashby, and Richard Leppert, who read portions of this book, as did Christopher Gibbs; they all gave careful and extremely helpful comments. Parts of this book were published earlier. David Nicholls, editor of the Society for American Music’s journal, American Music, published chapter 3, for which I received the ASCAP Deems Taylor Award, and a version of chapter 5 appeared in Musical Quarterly. During the initial research for this book Dr. David Culbert discovered correspondence between Theodor Adorno and the editors at Oxford University Press. He generously made them available to me, and for this I am extremely grateful. The results were published in German Studies Review and form part of this book’s chapter 4. Each year, a small group of wonderful friends meet over dinner to discuss our projects and ideas. To them, Judith Peraino, Leslie Sprout, Arved Ashby, Amy Bauer, and David Metzer, I raise a toast and give you my heartfelt thanks.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nDavid Metzer in particular has been a constant and sustaining friend in all things. Other colleagues who helped me along the way include Jennifer DeLapp and James Buhler. I would also like to thank Gayle Murchison, Katherine Preston, Jacqueline Warwick, Steve Bauer, Julia Foulkes, and Ivan Raykoff, all of whom invited me to share some of my ideas at their institutions and with their students. I would also like to single out Andrea Bohlman and especially Anne Schreffler and Eric Bentley, whose words of wisdom and support on the German front were strategic and especially kind. Special thanks go to Gayle Sherwood McGee and Sabine Feisst, who helped shepherd the book through and provided important support and constructive criticism. I would also like to thank my colleagues at the University of Windsor: Janice Waldron, Jonathan Bayley, Mary Abt-Pacquet, and especially Chris Blais, as well as my students Austin DiPietro, Meghan Chamberlain, Mitch Glover, Lilly Korkontzelos, and Zack Harrison. My thanks also go to Elizabeth Simpson, John Gingrich, Dana Gorzelany-­ Mostak, Caleb Boyd, Claire Harrison, and Peter Jarrett. I am especially grateful to Tim Page, as well as to Lisa Robinson and Andy and Ben Baharlias, all of whom understand what being a mensch really means. I am particularly grateful to the Feuchtwanger Memorial Library, the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the National Endowment for the Arts, Dr. Michael Ku, Natasha Wiebe, and Brent Lee from the Faculty of Arts and Social Science at the University of Windsor in Canada, and the Henry and Edna Binkele Classical Music Fund for generous support at critical moments in the unfolding of this research. The Society for American Music also supported the final research for the book, honoring me with the Virgil Thomson Award. In the various libraries where I performed exhaustive research, I acknowledge the help of Dr. Werner Grunzweig at the Akademie der Künste in Berlin and George Boziwick, Jonathan Hiam, and especially my friend Channan Willner at the New York Public Library. No words can express my heartfelt thanks to the University of Illinois Press for taking on this project. Working with Julianne Laut and the team was lucky and amazing. Most of all, I am deeply indebted to my editor, Laurie Matheson, whose wisdom and support for this book have meant such a great deal to me. Laurie read every word of the manuscript and offered sage advice and meaningful feedback. Few editors today show such investment in their authors. In so many ways, my parents inhabit this book. My mother adored films and influenced my love of classical Hollywood films. My father, like Eisler, was a German Jewish émigré and grew up in Berlin during the Weimar years. While he immigrated to Toronto to escape Nazism with his family in 1939, my\n\nxii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\ngrandparents eventually resided in Los Angeles as part of the German émigré community. Their stories, told through the lens of my father, brought to life an understanding of Weimar culture and the vicissitudes of émigré life; those stories became influential to this book. I’m so grateful to have had the opportunity to share my work with my father. I know he and my mother would be proud of the outcome. My daughter, Bianca, grew up during the gestation of this book and came to be an important sounding board for me. Because of the censorship around the Hays Code, classical Hollywood films emerged as an ideal platform for a mother and her young daughter. We watched, we listened, we talked about films incessantly, and, as happened a generation earlier with me and my mother, Bianca developed a great love for classical Hollywood films. As her expertise and taste developed, she became my most ardent critic, for which I am very grateful. She also taught me that time away from the book could provide an essential and critical corrective for my thinking, and she was right. Finally, what can I say about my best friend, Jim, my mentor and partner in crime . . . te amo. It is to you that I dedicate this book.\n\nxiii\n\nUNSETTLED SCORES\n\nChapter 1\n\nBackground Stories\n\nIn 1924 culture critic Gilbert Seldes published The Seven Lively Arts, an impassioned manifesto praising popular culture. It marked a strategic moment when American intellectuals began to take seriously the artistic and cultural significance of contemporary mass-produced entertainments in the United States.1 In the wake of the devastation that Europe experienced during World War I, the United States emerged in the 1920s as a significant cultural and political force primarily through the power and strength of its industrialization. As technology, assembly line manufacturing, and consumerism rapidly developed, Seldes and others acknowledged that the industries creating “mass art” and “mass culture” were distinctive features of the American political and artistic ethos, a signature of its brand of modernism.2 Hollywood played a defining role in that identification. In the cultivated musical arts, modernist composers in the United States also began to initiate their own intellectual debates about film music and the implications of mass culture during the 1920s and 1930s.3 Much of their attitude was shaped by the aesthetic and partisan tensions that separated the communities of high and low forms of culture. Whereas the high arts in the United States were underdeveloped, especially in the cultivated musical arts, which were primarily borrowed from Europe’s bourgeois classes, the American culture industries were robust, a situation reinforced by the country’s limited elite tradition and its underlying political ideals of a democratized egalitarian society.\n\nChapter 1\n\nThese conditions should have opened up new attitudes and possibilities for modernist composers in the United States, but as important as Hollywood was within popular culture, few of them embraced its potential. Most instead disdained it, holding the preconception that the enterprise committed a multitude of aesthetic sins.4 This book focuses on the collision of these competing cultures by examining the Hollywood activities of Aaron Copland and Hanns Eisler, who were among the earliest modernist art composers to challenge the movie capital both in their writings and in the scores they created for the industry. They considered Hollywood to be an imperious institutional authority, a political and aesthetic force to be reckoned with, but also a powerful platform that could affect the minds and hearts of the public and, most importantly, contribute to the political discourse of the period. This latter concern was significant. Both composers saw firsthand how the ills of capitalism and war had created social crises, profoundly shaping their political ideals and, in turn, their cultural and aesthetic thinking. Confronting these social problems led them toward experimenting with new artistic forms and values and to Hollywood, where they found possibilities to articulate their modernist political ideals. As a contemporary art form, motion pictures offered an opportunity to communicate musically through current technologies. The notion was not unfamiliar to modernist art composers, but in the United States, they generally turned to documentary film as their genre of preference. Modernist composer George Antheil, one of the few who penetrated Hollywood, observes that the emphasis upon pictorial rather than dramatic narratives (the latter associated with Hollywood’s commercial films) made documentary films more hospitable, easier for the art composer. It allowed them to employ symphonic or ballet-like underscoring, a natural condition that coincided with their skills and values.5 But American composers also felt that the culture around documentary productions was more attractive; there were better opportunities to integrate progressive techniques, elevate music as a dominant voice (largely in agreement with Antheil’s assessment), and take seriously the film’s more persuasive political subjects.6 While modernist composers believed that Hollywood was artistically restrictive and relied on kitsch and that its productions were formulaic, nevertheless, by the end of the Great Depression, the public, whose power of the purse held consequences, and the industry’s own independent directors began to demand better-quality films. In response, Hollywood began to move away from the escapist narratives that characterized most of its films to more realistic and higher-quality projects.7 For Copland and Eisler, the opportunity was ripe.\n\n2\n\nBackground Stories\n\nThey pursued Hollywood in part for monetary reasons but also as a provocative vehicle that could offer professional possibilities for the expression of their deeply held political and aesthetic conscience and convictions. Nevertheless, both men occupied different points on the political spectrum of the Left, while their musical upbringing represented contrasting stylistic propensities. Copland, an American, studied with Nadia Boulanger in Paris and subsequently forged a place in the limited modernist circles at home during the 1920s. The shadow of capitalism during the Great Depression, however, forced him to address the political implications of this economic and social crisis and to reconsider his elite inclinations. He moved toward the creation of an American aesthetic, an ideal that represented a more democratized outlook. Copland’s idea of bringing together art and mass industry not only reflected this political reality but also mirrored the values of American culture about which Seldes had argued, a posture that helped the composer cultivate his distinctive musical sensibility. Hollywood would play a central role in this endeavor. Many of the same political questions regarding egalitarianism and democratization raised by modernists like Copland had already emerged in Germany a decade earlier in response to the devastation caused by World War I. The war and its horrific human cost led Eisler to leave the rarefied circles of his teacher Arnold Schoenberg in order to embrace Marxism (his siblings were already central figures in the Austrian and later German Communist Parties) and become among the most-sought-after political Marxist musicians on the international stage. Eisler’s European film scores formed an essential aspect of his political and aesthetic contributions. The crises of capitalism, then, were pivotal moments for Copland and Eisler. The brutal economic and social conditions created enormous adversity, which in turn galvanized their social conscience, motivating them to interpret more keenly their contemporary political environment and the culture that defined it. Unlike those of Copland, Eisler’s political investments were problematized beginning in 1933 because of his émigré status first in Europe and then in the United States after 1938. Yet, both composers were closely aligned to various communist and cultural front organizations, a common link in their respective communities. Each in his own way cultivated a place for his activities in the Popular Front (Eisler as a continuation of his previous political commitments), the movement organized by the Soviet Comintern in 1935 to combat fascist developments in Europe, exploring new ways to transfer his musical modernist ambitions into the political realm.8 By the time Copland came to Hollywood in 1939 (Eisler arrived two years later), an estimated 85 million people from the country’s population of 132\n\n3\n\nChapter 1\n\nmillion, all diverse and mixed communities, attended and consumed movies each week.9 It was a powerful democratized platform. Despite Hollywood’s relationship to industrialization, its appeal to wide audiences, and the appearance of violating modernism’s ideals of originality and individuality, mass culture nevertheless still retained certain innovative and experimental qualities. For example, to capture its diverse mass public, those from different classes and ethnicities, Hollywood nurtured an ability to negotiate between high and low forms of art. The cultivated arts, once the purview of the educated or bourgeois classes, were now easily and inexpensively distributed to the masses, while folk, ethnic, and working-class entertainments, previously consumed locally and ignored by highbrow audiences, were made accessible by virtue of the media and could not be dismissed so easily.10 These cultural democratized forms created a powerful synthesis in the medium that Copland and Eisler expertly cultivated within their film scores. Though profits were valued over taste, taste nevertheless was now shaped by diverse consumer expectations. One manifestation of this condition, for example, was the emergence of the prestige picture, whose more elevated production values attracted Copland to work in Hollywood and Hollywood to be interested in him. To stimulate demand and profitability, the industry also invested tremendous capital to achieve a high level of technical brilliance and, in turn, the extraordinary reputation for which the movie capital was known. This appealed to Eisler, who held a keen interest in film’s technology and was very impressed with Hollywood’s sound facilities.11 When Antheil reported in 1936 that “Hollywood cannot be equaled; that our directors, cameramen, cutters, soundmen, and musicians are technically superb and that the entire cinema process in our studios is, from start to finish American efficiency at its very best,” he not only legitimized Hollywood’s industrialized supremacy but also elevated these technical achievements as part of the country’s nationalistic virtues, a cultural value that Copland did not overlook.12 More than any other modernist art composers of the era, Copland and Eisler insinuated their individual political and aesthetic values in Hollywood. As outsiders to the film studios, they wrote highly critical, sometimes hostile assessments of the enterprise but also contributed directly through their writings, which were designed to reform Hollywood in ways that reflected their own particular sensitivities, both political and aesthetic, as modernist composers. Copland and Eisler held serious reservations about the institution’s corporate culture and hierarchy of power relations, its factory-influenced modes of production, and its methods of collaboration, which they felt more often corrupted the musical enterprise. In this, they were echoing the complaints that musical modernists had used to rail against industries of mass culture, maintaining 4\n\nBackground Stories\n\nwhat Andreas Huyssen has coined the “anxiety of contamination,” arguments of exclusion that reinforced the high/low dichotomy.13 Copland and Eisler experienced a similar anxiety in Hollywood because of the cultural boundaries they were straddling and the conflicts that arose in their practical experiences working there. Such baggage distorted many of their critical judgments or even more neutral observations about the industry, often at the expense of obfuscating the good. I approach their musical activities in Hollywood not only through an interpretation of their writings on the subject but also through their first Hollywood film scores, Copland’s for Lewis Milestone’s 1939 film Of Mice and Men and Eisler’s for Hangmen Also Die!, directed by Fritz Lang (1943). The choice is strategic, since these two motion pictures reflect Copland’s and Eisler’s respective initial experiences within the industry and coordinate with their critical Hollywood writings. More important, these films are highly politicized topical narratives of the period, each addressing a particular and salient crisis that engaged these composers’ individual ideologies concerning society and the human condition. The central personalities involved in making these two pictures also shared political sensibilities with the two composers. In the case of Copland’s experiences writing for Of Mice and Men, both Milestone and novelist John Steinbeck were invested in the political advocacy of those whose lives were dislocated by the Great Depression. Hangmen Also Die! was created by a circle of German émigrés in Hollywood whose political identifications lay firmly on the Left, particularly playwright Bertolt Brecht, an intimate friend and comrade of Eisler’s who helped write the story and script. The parallel structure of this book, formed by the two film music analyses I present, illuminates the differing ways Copland and Eisler treated the score as an agent for political expression. It also reveals how they transformed their individual modernist styles into the commercial sphere. Simultaneously, their critical writings, which form a complement to their own film scores, are among the most detailed reactions to Hollywood and have since become central historical documents from the period. Eisler: A European Film Composer\n\nEisler and his coauthor, the cultural critic Theodor W. Adorno, intended the introductory statement in their 1947 book Composing for the Films, quoted below, to function as an indictment of the Hollywood enterprise and, in turn, American capitalistic culture.14 The motion picture cannot be understood in isolation, as a specific form of art; it is understandable only as the most characteristic medium of 5\n\nChapter 1\n\ncontemporary cultural industry, which uses the techniques of mechanical reproduction. . . . In this advanced industrial age, the masses are compelled to seek relaxation and rest, in order to restore the labor power that has been spent in the alienated process of labor; and this need is the mass basis of mass culture. On it there has arisen the powerful amusement industry, which constantly produces, satisfies, and reproduces new needs.15\n\nSuch stark reactions arose from the authors’ European Marxist identities and experiences and, in the case of Eisler, his compositional activities as a political musician and film composer. Like Copland, Eisler believed in the social purpose of music, that music should not only mirror society but also participate in it. In comparison to Copland, however, who saw Hollywood more generally as a positive icon of American culture, Eisler characterized the enterprise as part of the larger political crisis in capitalism, a perception influenced by his experiences in Berlin following World War I. At the time, the chaos of debt and hyperinflation had taken ahold of the metropolis in a pervasive way, and the social price was heavy. The misery in the crowded streets, characterized by the paintings of George Grosz, a friend of Eisler’s, exposed the vulgarity between a poverty-stricken underclass that included the unemployed, old and young prostitutes, crippled beggars—vestiges from the war—and outsiders who could buy almost anything with their valuable foreign currency, only to be surpassed by the greed of local plutocrats. The city’s vulnerability was characterized by two nationalistic ideals: everything American, with that country’s image of money and technocracy, and the fledgling Soviet Union, which offered hope and social progress. Though Eisler’s sympathies were heavily invested in communism, both ideals would come to occupy his dialectic perspective in Hollywood.16 As the center for the workers’ movement after World War I, Berlin offered Eisler a variety of musical opportunities with the more aggressive communist artistic organizations, such as Das Rote Sprachrohr (The Red Mouthpiece), the first agitprop troupe (politicized theater) of the Communist Youth League (KJVD). Actor Franz Boensch, who worked within this political network, recalled that Eisler had been well established within the inner circle of the party, a relationship that would follow him to the United States.17 Within these theatrical circles, Eisler also met and introduced the playwright Bertolt Brecht to the revolutionary working-class cultural world that the composer inhabited.18 Brecht, an enfant terrible in the city’s theater community, where he cultivated his proletariat image, was fundamentally a shrewd and merciless artist with business savvy who played one producer off another.19 Even so, Brecht and Eisler forged an important personal and professional relationship, collaborating 6\n\nBackground Stories\n\nFIGURE 1.1.

They invoked shock and irony, using materials to encourage more critical engagement with the narrative, an approach characteristic of the modern epic theater. Eisler would continue to implement these ideas with Brecht in film and later in Hollywood when they collaborated on Hangmen Also Die! Berlin’s urban chaos, its entertainments, and its amusements were all fueled by the emergent technologies of mass media: radio, gramophone, and sound films. While these new fields contributed to the city’s cosmopolitan modernity, 7\n\nChapter 1\n\nthey were also controlled by capitalistic enterprises that ensured the public was, as Eisler would say, intoxicated by them. The commercial German movie industry thrived during the 1920s, especially on escapist comedies and metaphorical narratives that paralleled the doom and gloom percolating all around. Fritz Lang, who later conceived and directed Hangmen Also Die!, was among the most prominent filmmakers whose motion pictures focused on these dark subjects. His film Metropolis (1927), for example, is a ruthless depiction of capitalism. Nearly half the films shown in Germany, however, came from Hollywood and, by their very nature of being American, appealed to the German sensibilities of the period with their narrative exposés of violence, crime, wealth, and excess.21 The rampant bourgeois capitalistic domination over media and information in Berlin prompted the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) to produce an alternative film culture. Willi Münzenberg, the powerful propaganda organizer for the KPD, bought the German distribution rights for Soviet films and released Sergei Eisenstein’s revolutionary propaganda motion picture Battleship Potemkin, exemplifying to German left-wing filmmakers a political approach to film.22 He also helped to establish the Prometheus Film Collective and financed collaborative partnerships with Moscow’s Mezhrabpom-Russ (1924).23 These studios attracted a like-minded community of left-wing avant-garde artists, including Eisler and Brecht, and produced films that fused agitprop theater techniques with a fictionalized documentary style. Unlike the entertainment narratives that defined Hollywood productions, these films were largely noncommercial political documentary or documentary-style endeavors. Eisler’s experiences in this environment helped shape his perspectives on collaborative production values and the use of music in film for political ends. In 1931, during the early stages of sound film, he collaborated on the KPD-sponsored proletariat film Kuhle Wampe oder: Wem gehört die Welt? (Kuhle Wampe, or Who owns the world?) (produced by the Prometheus Film Collective, script written by Brecht and Ernst Ottwald) and later Song of Heroes (Mezhrabpom), films that promoted strong revolutionary agendas and embraced the social values enunciated by Münzenberg.24 Many of Eisler’s compositional techniques were designed to enhance the film’s political affect by creating a more rational and reasoned approach and by utilizing the music as a strong and independent voice rather than a subordinated appendage that functioned only to reinforce on-screen actions. Such strategies, among others, were devised to stimulate audiences and to counteract the manipulative approach that Hollywood scores achieved through escapist effects. Eisler’s commitment to these activities led him to write about the subject. In one of his first published articles for the London magazine World Film, for\n\n8\n\nBackground Stories\n\nexample, he emphasizes the importance of working side by side with the filmmaker, such as Victor Trivas.25 In Niemandsland, a pacifist film set amid the conflicts of World War I, Trivas called for sound and music to function in conflict with the screen. This strategy, explored by Russian formalists like Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and Grigori Alexandrov, captured through sound some of the ideas that could not be visualized or identified on-screen and drew out deeper meanings that might underlie the film’s depiction. In Niemandsland, therefore, the conflict between sound and screen might metaphorically be construed as the conflicts existing between nations in World War I, and Eisler’s score materially contributed to these effects. In comparison, similar antiwar films of the period, such as Lewis Milestone’s American film All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), used sound and music in tandem with the visual images to capture the realistic aspects of war, illustrating what was already apparent on the screen.26 Few films in Hollywood would have employed the type of sonic musical style or counterpoint that Eisler used in films like Niemandsland or the commercial film Dans les rues, also made by Victor Trivas.27 As Eisler would discover, his European experiences in film and those of Hollywood seemed to be worlds apart. By 1933, when Hitler became chancellor, Eisler was no longer welcome in Germany, and in exile he could not always choose his film commissions. Still, he continued to work primarily with a close, politically leftist émigré circle who shared the artistic views and partisan politics that infused aspects of their motion pictures. In England he participated in two commercial films, Abdul the Damned, a film that criticized Hitler’s dictatorship through a veiled historical parable set in pre–World War I Turkey, and Pagliacci, an opera adaptation.28 The cultural and political milieu in which these pictures were made placed them well outside the general motion picture fare produced in England and revealed a cultural divide. Novelist Graham Greene’s xenophobic response to these “British” productions, in which Eisler was involved, highlighted the problems when he said, “We have saved the English film industry from American competition only to surrender it to a far more alien control.”29 Film practice was cultural practice defined by particular characteristics of identity politics and ethos; Greene’s comments reflected things to come. By now, Eisler had become a highly skilled European film composer and critic, but this expertise would not entirely prepare him for his own immediate experiences in Hollywood. Eisler’s first impressions of the United States (and Hollywood) came on a cross-country tour of the country in 1935, promoting his political music and lectures primarily within the fledgling American Marxist circles, an environment where he was celebrated. The American Music League’s Composers’\n\n9\n\nChapter 1\n\nCollective, a communist-front organization directed toward professional composers, used Eisler’s example as a model for their own work. Members such as Charles Seeger and Henry Leland Clarke, among others, revered his ability to transform modernist musical language politically to reach a mass audience.30 Because Copland participated in some of these organizations, Eisler’s example provides a common political link between the two composers, even though their modernist and cultural inclinations would lead to quite different outcomes. More important, the trip laid the foundation for Eisler’s later residency in the United States when he finally fled Europe. The connections he made, especially in left-wing political circles, created opportunities for him to work in film as both a critic and a composer and eventually in Hollywood itself. Few German émigrés looked favorably to America as a viable place of exile, perhaps because of its distance and certainly because of its alien culture. Eisler’s initial observations during his 1935 tour, for example, reflected elements of this posture. German exiles came from a society that catered to a different set of cultural ideals and values (as Greene emphasized in Britain) that relied on a historical elite tradition, even if, like Eisler (and Brecht), those exiles came into conflict with that tradition. German artists of all stripes still enjoyed political and aesthetic autonomy through a diverse but wide infrastructure that supported their traditions.31 The proletariat had an expansive network of social and cultural agencies in which Eisler participated, and political parties like the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Communists (KPD), through Münzenberg’s leadership, controlled independent and powerful distribution mechanisms. Within art circles, exhibitions like the Baden Baden Festival, where Eisler’s score for Walter Ruttman’s experimental film Opus III was premiered in 1927, showcased modernist trends. European artists, even controversial and political ones, still had a public and an infrastructure that supported them in a tradition of critical engagement. Furthermore, Eisler had witnessed a mythologization of American culture in 1920s Weimar Germany through German films, jazz cabaret, and detective novels. These productions fostered a perception on the part of many intellectuals and artists that the United States was a diabolical place, exotic and vulgar, void of intellectualism, and tied to money, capitalism, and the clutch of technology. Consequently, when Eisler and Adorno collaborated on Composing for the Films or when Eisler, Brecht, and Fritz Lang worked together on Hangmen Also Die!, their responses to the Hollywood enterprise and its public often exposed an undercurrent tied to this kind of cultural animosity and naïveté. After Eisler arrived in Hollywood, as he had done in Berlin, England, Paris, and New York, he immediately integrated himself within a like-minded partisan émigré group. Each of his compatriots carried different attitudes toward 10\n\nBackground Stories\n\ntheir new American context, especially Hollywood, where they would reside. Brecht despised it and could never acclimate himself to the culture, while Fritz Lang embraced it. Eisler negotiated between the two extremes, openly expressing his critical disdain for American culture in Composing for the Films, yet as a Hollywood composer he became a pragmatist, writing a score for Hangmen Also Die! that bridged the two cultures. Copland’s Emergent American Modernism\n\nIn historical hindsight, it seems ironic that Aaron Copland should have emerged as the quintessential twentieth-century American composer in the cultivated musical arts. As a modernist of Jewish descent, a homosexual, and a leftist, he had to negotiate his career through a field of arduous political and aesthetic hurdles in a community that embraced conservative musical ideals, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and later anticommunism.32 But in many ways, these characteristics helped to shape his political sensitivity and orientation toward the pursuit of inclusion and egalitarianism, values that would become determining factors in his artistic and political outlook and central to his engagement with Hollywood film. Howard Pollack and Elizabeth Crist have carefully documented Copland’s progressive ideals and his movement toward Marxist political activities during the 1930s.33 The political orientation Copland adopted motivated him to rethink more acutely the relationship between modernist composers, who he feared were “working in a vacuum,” and their audiences. In order to capture a new public, Copland turned to the generation that now consumed music through the new technologies of radio, phonograph, and film, themselves not only products of modern culture but simultaneously the means by which modern culture was disseminated. Moreover, in the pursuit of that new public, he introduced an “imposed simplicity,” a conscious and deliberate effort to create an accessible yet modern musical complexion.34 The opportunity to compose scores for Hollywood films allowed him to combine his “imposed simplicity” with the mass medium of film. Hollywood, as a powerful cultural enterprise, with its vast and diverse audiences, its appeal, and its ability to cross cultural boundaries, helped to establish Copland as the iconic Americanist composer. In this regard, film music held important implications for Copland’s career because the medium’s visual and narrative content brought a dynamic quality to his scores (of course, his music reciprocally animated the films), branding them with their American sensibilities. It was a stylistic ethos that he had already begun to develop in his ballet scores and concert music in the mid-1930s. But unlike the ideals of originality that defined these cultivated practices and were 11\n\nChapter 1\n\ncoveted by art composers, Hollywood relied more often on repeated stylistic identification from film to film, a practical inevitability of the production process that led to the creation of a historic and cultural network of musical codes.35 When studio music departments discovered the American modernist qualities that defined Copland’s film music, they too adopted them, invoking his stylistic features as a model for other Hollywood films of American contemporary content. More than the ballet scores, his film music became popularized through a pyramid structure of dissemination, distributing his musical ideas well beyond his own film scores.36 Ironically, this prestige of popularity, itself tied to Copland’s political ethos, found its way back into the concert hall, but now with a vibrant and more particular meaning enhanced by the nationalistic program with which Copland had invested it and the branding Hollywood gave it through its wide-reaching democratized power. After Copland wrote Hollywood scores, critics would come to understand the more difficult of the composer’s high modernist works through the interpretive and cultural lens that his film scores had provided.37 Copland’s early experiences in Paris with Nadia Boulanger shaped his modernist outlook and heightened his appreciation for American culture through its dissemination and consumption in France. The aesthetics of simplicity, a characteristic that would later distinguish his film music style, were qualities introduced to him in the compositional work of the notorious French composers Les Six through their audacious embrace of “Une musique de tous les jours” (music of the everyday).38 Their rebellious approach, itself a modernist posture, challenged French traditions that they considered to be no longer relevant while legitimizing a utilitarian role for music. For Copland, their musical courage validated the juxtaposition of an accessible language within contemporary art music, much as Eisler was doing in late 1920s Berlin, a new way of thinking that profoundly affected both composers’ outlook. Perhaps more shocking to Copland was Les Six’s bold fascination with American popular forms of jazz, a phenomenon he experienced within the circle associated with Boulanger, as well as in the café culture of Paris and Vienna.39 Copland was an outsider to Paris, so the idea of American popular music transplanted into European modernist culture created for him a new perspective on American culture.40 Moreover, the way the French consumed and hotly debated jazz showed Copland that such popular forms could cut across class boundaries through the diverse strands of French society. The distinction between high and low culture was becoming blurred.41 Copland was also surprised to find the wide-ranging presence and importance of Hollywood movies, which dominated theaters in Paris. To his parents,\n\n12\n\nBackground Stories\n\nhe expressed it as a sign of modernism.42 Even Boulanger, Copland’s teacher, went to the movies, an activity that Annegret Fauser considered one of several social factors that identified Boulanger as a “modern European woman.”43 This exposure to American culture in Europe demonstrated to Copland its intrinsic value and validated for him these forms of popular expression as viable artistic outlets, in distinction to prevailing views in the United States of high and low culture, views that critics like Seldes were beginning to question.44 Copland’s idol, the Russian-born composer Igor Stravinsky, provided another lesson while Copland was in Paris. As a Russian émigré, Stravinsky’s own outsider status in France gave him the conviction that as a twentieth-century composer he could invent his own tradition.45 This idea was fundamental to Copland because music in the United States, at least within the cultivated arts, relied on a European tradition. Without a musical history of its own either to reject or to rely upon, the concept of a truly American modernist aesthetic was still an empty book ready to be filled.46 When Copland returned to the United States after his studies, American modernist composers suffered a double burden: they were ignored by the mainstream concert communities, who viewed them as parochial because they were American, and as modernists they were disdained because the American public could not understand their difficult style.47 As Elie Siegmeister, a colleague of Copland’s, put it, “Modernism galvanized the young composers, but was royally rejected by major orchestras and the broad musical public, and survived in those tiny concerts attended by 100—always the same 100 people.”48 Part of the problem lay in the fact that much of the modernist music performed in the United States was European; that is, it was an imported art form that was bound to the culture’s own particular contemporary social and political conditions. Hanns Eisler’s reading of Schoenberg’s dodecaphonic music, for example, which I discuss below in the context of Eisler’s score for Hangmen Also Die!, was an evocative interpretation of the social problems in Europe following the war but did not pertain to the situation in the United States. Accordingly, the rebellious ethos that defined the European modernist aesthetic and its cultural significance found little relevance in the American context, a situation that compounded Copland’s resentment regarding the special privilege accorded European composers. Copland wanted to combat this problem by creating a music that represented a broader conception of American culture and address the values of a mass audience. Copland was extremely sensitive to the cultural politics involved in realizing such a goal. Some of the negative criticisms he received regarding his jazzinflected works during the 1920s, for example, revealed an underlying personal\n\n13\n\nChapter 1\n\nand ethnic hostility that arose from the allusions to African American culture and his own Jewish background.49 Critics drew lines of segregation between the highbrow culture of American concert life, which belonged to establishment Yankee culture, and Jews and Negros, who stood at the margins of American society’s cultivated establishment.50 As an outsider to the establishment, how might Copland bring to audiences a modernist musical ethos that embraced his own inclusive American ideals? These were his central concerns during the Depression. Because Copland and Jews in the United States generally maintained an outsider status in mainstream American culture, the motivation to participate in politics was underscored by its promise for a more egalitarian, tolerant, and pluralistic country.51 At stake was what Marc Dollinger has called “the politics of acculturation,” an opportunity for American Jews to help shape their own social inclusion and, in turn, be a part of mainstream American life.52 In 1936 Joseph Freeman, editor of the New Masses, a magazine closely tied to the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA), expressed the notion that “if you are born into an oppressed nationality you are likely to think a great deal about oppression and about nationalism.”53 For Copland, the perspective seemed fitting, particularly as anti-Semitism began to rise following the Depression. Jews, especially those from emigrant families, had grown up with the promise of democracy free from the prejudices they had encountered in Europe.54 The political ideals of inclusion, particularly those associated with the Left, provided a more hopeful and genuine perspective of what the United States might look like for Jews, particularly secularized ones like Copland. Much of Copland’s writings, his music, and, as I discuss later, his score for Of Mice and Men address these themes and, as the crisis of the Depression advanced, the plight of the worker in relation to a nationalistic rhetoric associated with the Popular Front in the United States, “the people.”55 His creative efforts during this period contributed to the cultural movement that helped to sustain the US progressive political agenda.56 Copland’s validation of Hollywood in works like Of Mice and Men reveals how the industry could blur the distinction between the popular and the exclusive. Rather than deny their aesthetic limitations, Copland embraced the culture industries as a contemporary platform that strengthened, not weakened, his art. As Copland said in 1940, “The composer of today has a brand new audience to write for. The radio and the phonograph and the movies have broadened the democratic bases of music so suddenly that composers have been taken by surprise. . . . It is our job to give these new listeners a music that is fresh, direct, simple and profound. I can think of no better program for the composer of today.”57\n\n14\n\nBackground Stories\n\nHollywood: The State of the Industry\n\nIn 1939 critic Margaret Farrand Thorp published this thumbnail sketch of the tensions between industry and art in Hollywood: “‘It must be remembered that the production of motion pictures is not only an art but an industry.’ Or: ‘It must be remembered that the production of motion pictures is not so much an art as an industry.’ Or: ‘It must be remembered that the production of motion pictures is not an art but an industry.’ That sentence, in one of its variants, occurs in every discussion of the movies.”58 Copland and Eisler fully appreciated this condition only after they began working in the movie capital. By that time, the industry had already evolved into a powerful creative and commercial enterprise. Musical practice emerged from its historical position in relation to the progress of the industry as a whole, the development of technology, a distinctive narrative practice and mode of production, and stylistic preferences, all of which were shaped by a hierarchy of power relations and economic considerations. These conditions generated a musical culture that was forced to negotiate between artistic considerations and commercial dictates unique to Hollywood. In essence, Hollywood had its own way of doing business. With this in mind, I begin the discussion by considering the state of the Hollywood industry and the historical rationale behind its values, its working conditions, and its practices as Copland and Eisler found them and to which they responded. Though most histories glorify the coming of sound as a technological triumph, its aesthetic intrusion to film was by many accounts disruptive.59 Since the early 1900s, Hollywood filmmakers had developed a host of visual strategies particularly in editing that proved to deliver, from the perspective of the public, a highly persuasive narrative style focused upon a convincing seamlessness and coherence between film shots. The art of invisible editing or montage cultivated an illusion of naturalism and, in turn, the psychological notion of a visual reality on-screen, a key strategy that contributed to the style of classical Hollywood film. As technical innovations in sound film developed, they were used primarily to enhance dialogue (and sound effects) as they contributed to the aesthetic of on-screen realism.60 Because sound effects and music were recorded during postproduction, after image track and dialogue, they acquired the status of an afterthought within the filmmaking process, which had long-standing consequences for the plight of music.61 In particular, nondiegetic music, which does not emanate or cannot be implied from a source on-screen, functions outside the film’s narrative space.62 Therefore, the score cannot participate so readily\n\n15\n\nChapter 1\n\nin the realistic ideology that classical style was developing and indeed could be considered to undermine that realism. Because of these technical developments, studios positioned music as an add-on to the film’s artistic complex. Moreover, musical underscoring continued to be treated further down the aesthetic hierarchy in the mixing process because sound effects, like dialogue, were considered a part of the natural and realistic world and were therefore required to be heard over music. These conditions relegated nondiegetic music as an accessory to enhance the importance of existing screen events and a servant to narrative constructions instead of a full-fledged participant. Rather than including music as part of an integrated artistic conception that placed it on an equal footing (an approach commonly used in Europe and to which Eisler fully subscribed), Hollywood filmmakers often exploited nondiegetic scores as a means to cover up problems and rescue any of the editorial, acting, or dialogue flaws on the completed image track (or rough cut). Music was the fix, curing problems that potentially challenged the integrity of the screen. That the role of music should be reduced to such subservient and menial applications was, to Copland, an abomination.63 Practice: Music in Hollywood Film\n\nCompared to the more concrete ideological demand to create realism onscreen, the functions assigned to music in its subordinated position focused on the less tangible, more enigmatic qualities, those like music itself, that could not be seen and therefore were harder for the audience to grasp. These qualities generated an alternative reality to the illusion of reality created by image and dialogue. Filmmakers used music to evoke characteristics that the image track or dialogue could not capture so readily, including psychological characterization, emotion, and the rendering of mood.64 Hollywood therefore developed a variety of functional and stylistic strategies that accorded with music’s subordinated position and played upon the audience’s human weakness, that of the ear, which Eisler understood to be a passive organ in comparison to the eye.65 To exploit music in these less tangible contexts and still maintain the goal of realism on-screen, the classical Hollywood film demanded that the musical score establish a type of invisible discourse, an auditory verisimilitude parallel to the visual illusion of naturalism established through Hollywood’s editing strategies. As a general convention, musical underscoring had to maintain a discreet and self-effacing presence in order to function in an unconscious way, in effect, to be “inaudible.”66 To support this goal, cinematographers and composers worked toward concealing both the technical apparatus (the sound and visual equipment) 16\n\nBackground Stories\n\nand the technical processes of a motion picture in order to preserve the illusory character of realism on film.67 Like its visual counterpart in editing, the sound apparatus, such as microphones, speakers, the studio orchestras, or any sonic device generating music, was concealed from viewers. In cases where the physical sound apparatus was presented on-screen, the classical aesthetic would require that it be “naturalized”: the source of the music or the apparatus becomes part of the diegetic world visually presented on-screen, whether from a radio or other natural sound source, and therefore maintains the perception of realism. Nevertheless, how could filmmakers explain the ontology of music whose source was not part of the diegesis? This question continued to provoke heated aesthetic and theoretical debates on the role and function of Hollywood’s nondiegetic music during the 1930s and beyond. Conflicts arose over whether music should be heard, where it should be positioned, whether it enhanced or disturbed screen events, and the nature of the music itself, issues that Copland would address well into the 1940s.68 To deal with this conundrum, Hollywood film composers used a variety of compositional strategies to conceal the musical underscoring from the conscious awareness of the viewer.69 For example, they introduced or completed a musical cue by carefully preparing a soft lead-in, a strategy that was dubbed “sneaking” or “stealing” the music into the narrative in order not to draw attention to it, as Copland does in his score for Of Mice and Men, as I discuss in chapter 3.70 Similarly, to end the musical cue or tailing out, they might focus on a moment of shifting emphasis on-screen. Moreover, subtle melodic constructions remained discreet to restrict the audience’s direct apprehension, while complex rhythms were avoided and slower tempos were carefully controlled. Other compositional elements, such as orchestration, were subjected to the same aesthetic and ideological goals that fostered a fluid unobtrusive style. Copland keenly observed that composing for celluloid often required the avoidance of harsh or strident effects and articulations.71 Sensitivity toward microphone techniques was important, because instruments projected differently in recording.72 In response, Hollywood tended to exploit the wash of a full string section as a solution to the problems of reproduction, while woodwinds had to be treated unobtrusively because of their diverse and more idiosyncratic timbres, a convention that Copland thwarted.73 Essentially, Hollywood’s aesthetic and theoretical ideals of inaudibility governed most compositional problems in score writing and in turn became central issues in Copland’s and Eisler’s critical discussions. Copland, for example, admired Hollywood composers who showed expertise in creating what he called a depersonalized or neutral style, music that would not draw attention to itself particularly under dialogue, whereas Eisler (and Adorno), in comparison, loathed this type of banal music. 17\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe most common strategy aligned to the classical Hollywood aesthetic was to exploit music as a means of illustrating the materials initially introduced visually on-screen. In essence, music was made to be mimetic, functioning to establish close synchronization between image and music. The most extreme application of this approach was coined “Mickey Mousing” because it often occurred in cartoon scores. Max Steiner, though not alone, was among its most famous proponents in Hollywood: “The ‘Mickey Mouse’ scoring (my way of scoring) is a method which I consider the best for the screen, as it fits a picture like a glove.”74 Critics, beginning with Rudolf Arnheim, labeled the close synchronization between music and film as “parallel.”75 The processes of mixing and sound editing were also designed to support the established ideology by creating a homogenized flow, masking production and controlling the presence of the musical track by leveling the dynamics within a limited range and divesting the music of its distinctive articulations in what Eisler and Adorno called “neutralization.”76 Copland was also outraged that his efforts were reduced literally (rather than theoretically) to the point of inaudibility during the dubbing procedures.77 Ironically, the industry spent a great deal of money on the production, recording, editing, and mixing of music, only to render it “inaudible,” figuratively or otherwise, in the final product. The Composer and the Studio Music Department\n\nWhen the new technology of synchronized sound was implemented across all studios and the mechanisms housed in theaters (the transition period is usually identified from 1927 to 1932), initially most films released from Hollywood were musicals.78 To service this need, studios established music departments, hired large orchestras, and attracted arrangers and conductors who typically came from the music theater industry: Tin Pan Alley, Broadway, and silent film.79 Even those who did have training within the art music tradition, such as Max Steiner, concealed these alliances and instead embraced the values and ideals of the commercial world. These musicians established the working culture and creative requirements that characterized the role of music in film and the values and ideals of the Hollywood studio music departments. Nathaniel Finston, who founded the music department at Paramount Pictures and became its first director, was a classically trained violinist who conducted in a variety of motion picture theaters in New York and Chicago before arriving in Hollywood.80 Alfred Newman, who eventually became head of the music department at Twentieth Century Fox studios, was a piano prodigy who, like Copland, studied at an early age with Rubin Goldmark but whose\n\n18\n\nBackground Stories\n\nprofessional experience was cultivated on Broadway as a conductor before his Hollywood arrival in 1930. Max Steiner, who studied composition with Gustav Mahler and received his formal training at the Imperial Academy of Music in Vienna, composed and directed professionally for operettas in Europe and eventually on Broadway as copyist, arranger, orchestrator, and conductor before coming to Hollywood in 1929.81 These musicians acquired their professional experiences in the entertainment industries and adapted their skills to meet the new compositional needs of the motion picture enterprise. As Hollywood shifted its attention away from musicals toward the application of instrumental nondiegetic music, many of these musicians continued to work and experiment closely with industry executives, establishing a range of conventionalized practices, some of which I discuss above.82 Rather than bring the latest developments of modernism into the studio, a practice exercised to some extent in the European motion picture industry and certainly in the emerging American documentary movement, Hollywood composers shaped their scores with the familiar styles of entertainment music that traced their musical lineage back to the repertoires exploited in silent film: light classics, operetta, musical comedy, and popular song.83 This music complemented the ideals of industry executives who demanded what they believed suited public taste and mass appeal. That industry executives assumed control over their film product had been legally enshrined already in 1916. Charlie Chaplin pursued a court injunction against Essanay Studios and their distributor, V-LS-E, for tampering with one of his films, which he felt had been compromised. Chaplin lost his suit and with that set a precedent that would establish the employer’s rights of ownership (the studio) over the employee’s authorship (Chaplin’s creative contributions). In essence, the law solidified the control of studio executives over the artists they hired, a condition that would have important implications for composers working in Hollywood.84 The power structure of the studio system (ownership of production, distribution, and exhibition) and collective workforce reflected the imposition of a large bureaucratic management organization. During the 1930s, most of the studio’s administrative structures were formalized through intensely fought union negotiations with musicians (American Federation of Musicians) and arrangers (American Society of Music Arrangers, ASMA) but not with composers.85 And although unions helped to define the stratification of various professional tasks in each studio, composers were put in the position of negotiating their own financial contracts.86 Nevertheless, composers were considered employees, and their status as such legally nullified any of their individual rights or identification\n\n19\n\nChapter 1\n\nwith the creative investment of the score, a condition that arose directly from the Charlie Chaplin v. Essanay Film Manufacturing Company case. Though film composers generally accepted their employee status within a collective unit, art composers, even those like Copland, who embraced the industrialized notion of American culture (Eisler did not) nevertheless found it difficult and professionally stifling. In Composing for the Films, Eisler published a standard contractual agreement, probably his own when he worked under Arnold Pressburger for Hangmen Also Die! The document exposes the weak legal position of the composer: “All material composed, submitted, added or interpolated by the Writer pursuant to this agreement shall automatically become the property of the Corporation, which, for this purpose, shall be deemed the author thereof, the Writer acting entirely as the Corporation’s employee.”87 Both Copland and Eisler, however, found ways to reuse materials they had developed from their Hollywood films to circumvent the question of creative ownership. In 1942 Copland wrote Music for the Movies, a suite that incorporated musical materials from his film scores, including Of Mice and Men. The brilliance of reusing these materials was not just out of prudence; it also transferred the programmatic meaning he had established from these films back into the concert hall, disseminating the central American musical trope that would define and make famous his identity as an art composer.88 In 1948 Eisler borrowed the opening musical gesture for East Germany’s newly created national anthem from a heroic and patriotic moment (music for the death of a Czech resistance leader) in his score from Hangmen Also Die! This self-borrowing reflects an ironic political and ideological twist in view of the differences between Hollywood, the most capitalist of American enterprises, and the newly formed country of East Germany, the most communist.89 Both composers boldly moved outside the legal constraints of the studio system to assert ownership over the music they created for it. The Artist as Businessman; or, How to Fit In\n\nIn 1937 J. B. Priestley, the famous novelist and an erstwhile screenwriter in Hollywood, provocatively described the internal professional tensions of the industry: “Its trade, which is in dreams and at so many dollars a thousand feet, is managed by businessmen pretending to be artists and by artists pretending to be businessmen. In this queer atmosphere, nobody stays as he was; the artist begins to lose his art, and the businessman becomes temperamental and unbalanced.”90 This characterization epitomized Nathaniel Finston, the founder of Paramount’s music department, who personified the business mentality that\n\n20\n\nBackground Stories\n\nwould drive artistic decisions in Hollywood. He made two significant statements in December 1929 regarding the future of film music in Hollywood that would have lasting implications. He affirmed that composers were tied to an industry and therefore required to shape their work according to the criteria determined by the “industrialist” and that the business model employed by the film industry paralleled the industrial standards of a factory. Hollywood, he said, required composers who were “different” from those in the art tradition.91 Like many other musical directors who later in the decade expressed a similar sentiment, Finston believed that to hire art composers implied individualism, an emphasis on the value of originality over public appeal and taste, and especially creative control.92 These were characteristics closely aligned to the historic ideals of romanticism and the values invested in art music, traditions that were irrelevant to an industry in pursuit of mass-market ideals and commercial expediency.93 As Max Steiner ashamedly revealed, far from acknowledging his musical training at the Imperial Academy of Music or compositional studies with Mahler, he emphatically stated, “I wouldn’t dare. They wouldn’t let me stay in Hollywood anymore.”94 Finston’s alternative to using art composers was to create a more specialized approach to the creative tasks of writing a score. Rather than assigning an entire film score to a single composer, he preferred that the task be achieved collaboratively through individualized tasks: each musical idea would be assigned to a highly trained expert, a specialist dedicated to writing one particular musical concept, emotion, or mood. The music director, like a factory foreman, would then coordinate the individual efforts to produce the full score. In fact, by the mid-1930s, most studios had developed Finston’s model, employing an efficient system that, relying on extreme specialization of labor, emulated a factory assembly line. According to one journalist, Finston got the idea from visiting the Armour and Company meat-packing plant in Chicago. Finston did not shy away from the comparison. In a conversation with composer Oscar Levant, Finston proudly characterized his music department as running “like a well-oiled machine. Every man a cog in the wheel.”95 It was a calculation that Finston made as a means to elevate musical standards: “Each [musical] number must be a peak of effort.”96 Nevertheless, many composers did not view these procedures in the same way. Hugo Friedhofer, for example, felt that he was typecast by this approach. Working for Fox Studios (from 1935 Twentieth Century Fox) during the early 1930s, he was often assigned to do mechanical-sounding music, that is, music with a rhythmically invested style to emulate typewriters, trains, planes, and so on.97 Ernst Toch, considered by Copland to be among the most distinguished German composers, was\n\n21\n\nChapter 1\n\nrelegated to what Copland describes as the industry’s composer of “screwy music.”98 This was precisely the type of overspecialization that Eisler satirizes in his account of the MGM Studios when he visited in 1935, as I discuss in chapter 4. David Raksin, who also came to Hollywood the same year, wrote extensively about his experiences in the studio and unmasked the real meaning behind the collective process under which he worked at Twentieth Century Fox. Far from elevating musical standards, the process was designed, Raksin observed, to expedite the completion of the score, a goal that resulted from improvements in sound technology and the consequent demand for composers to create vast quantities of music.99 George Antheil and Copland, among many others, observed that speedwriting was an essential professional skill if one wanted to succeed in the industry. In 1935 Antheil proclaimed, however, that such methods discouraged originality and fostered what quickly became a highly formulaic approach to the techniques and strategies of film composition.100 Studios reused musical materials from one film to another, while composers often relied on common solutions in similar narrative situations for every film. The repetitive use of these proven techniques was consistent with the values of studio executives, who, secure with familiar formulae, resisted stylistic change and diversity. Few studios could tolerate the possibilities of risk that arose from new developments or experimentation because there was so much at stake, whether economic consequences or a studio’s reputation.101 The culture of the status quo, however, was not entirely created by studio executives. Part of the problem also lay in the film composers themselves; they were keenly protective of their professional domain. By preserving these conventions, they perpetuated a professional language and culture particular to industry insiders. Both Copland and Eisler in their writings exposed some of the political undercurrents that discouraged new blood in Hollywood and therefore new ideas. Even so, the industry understood that they needed to keep in place aspects of the score that proved successful with audiences while simultaneously innovating in order to stay competitive. One way in which Hollywood addressed these issues was to hire composers whose reputation outside the industry held cachet as a way to reinforce the prestige of their films. Over the objections of music directors like Finston, then, studios occasionally turned to composers from the art music tradition to raise the status of their productions. Paradoxically, the studios often assigned insiders from the music department to ensure that the art music composers did not move too far from the accepted norms.102\n\n22\n\nBackground Stories\n\nIt was a circular process that only in a limited way achieved the kind of dramatic innovation that studio heads claimed they were seeking. Copland and Eisler, however, were able to achieve a measure of innovation in the two film scores treated in this book because they worked for small independent studios where the filmmakers exerted more control over the creative processes. Lewis Milestone’s film Of Mice and Men, for example, was made and produced as a prestige picture to enhance the reputation of its filmmaker (Lewis Milestone), while Hangmen Also Die! was created by the independent Arnold Pressburger under the umbrella of United Artists. Innovation happened, but less frequently, because the industrial conventions were so rigidly entrenched, as Copland and Eisler found when they arrived in Hollywood. Oscar Levant, a classically trained and multitalented Hollywood musician known for his wit and intelligence, sarcastically remarked that Hollywood music departments were plagued by “a vicious circle in which the talented men do not have the experience, and the experienced men—largely speaking—have no particular talent. Thus, the same clichés are repeated over and over in the same lush tradition of over-orchestrating.”103 Such were the conditions that led to the theoretical notions and standardized practices of classical Hollywood scores to which Copland and Eisler would react both in their critical writings and in the first scores they produced for Hollywood.\n\n23\n\nChapter 2\n\nCopland on Hollywood\n\nAt the invitation of Iris Barry, curator of the Museum of Modern Art’s (MoMA) recently established Film Library (1935), Copland was asked to speak about his experiences composing music for his first film effort, the documentary motion picture The City.1 Between Barry’s invitation and the time of the lecture in January 1940, Copland was unexpectedly called to Hollywood to compose the score for Lewis Milestone’s feature film Of Mice and Men.2 Copland’s involvement in Hollywood had been “refreshing” and positive, and, he admitted, the immediacy of having worked there changed his perspective on film and the Hollywood enterprise.3 Now, for this lecture, he wanted to talk about it. Preserved as a fifty-eight-page typewritten transcript of his remarks, the MoMA lecture provides a critical and nuanced discussion of his theoretical and aesthetic views about Hollywood film music, its practice and practitioners, and his assessment of the industry as a commercial enterprise. This was a field Copland took seriously. He embraced Hollywood as an American cultural institution and wanted to legitimize it for the American modernist composer, an agenda that suited his nationalistic aims. The tone of the MoMA lecture, therefore, focuses on rescuing the industry from the worst transgressions of a commercial enterprise. Copland immediately sets this aesthetic agenda by establishing boundaries between “serious” American composers, namely, himself and his modernist colleagues, from “film composers,” those who work exclusively for Hollywood.\n\nCopland on Hollywood\n\nCopland was not alone in making this distinction. Various contemporary American composers and critics also separated the two communities professionally. The designation of “film composer,” however, from the perspective of those outside the industry, often implied a negative bias, suggesting that staff composers, “insiders,” those whose careers depended on the industry, were somehow inferior to “serious” composers whether because of their differences in training or because they lacked broader musical experiences within the realm of art music. Worse, “film composers” closely protected access to Hollywood. The perspective on this divide depended very much upon where composers stood in relation to the industry and where the industry stood in relation to them.4 The idea of validating Hollywood film remained controversial within highbrow institutions such as MoMA. For example, Barry encountered opposition among MoMA’s trustees to include Hollywood motion pictures in its Film Library, a skepticism they shared with many American modernist composers. She had to persuade the trustees that along with MoMA’s investment in European and documentary motion pictures, Hollywood films also had a place as an art form worthy of collecting, preserving, and studying.5 In this climate, many American modernist composers were reluctant to involve themselves in the “entertainment industry,” which they felt had the potential to sully their already precarious status as “serious” artists at home. Unlike their European counterparts, who more often successfully negotiated between their concert careers and work in the European film industry, American modernists felt professionally vulnerable and could not seem to achieve a similar balance. And while modernist composers found Hollywood inhospitable, it was a two-way street, because for the most part, Hollywood also found modernists unsuitable to the demands of its industry.6 The Hollywood film music community viewed itself as an autonomous and self-sufficient enterprise and was notoriously difficult to penetrate to the degree that modernist composer George Antheil described it as a “closed corporation.”7 In 1939 Virginia Wright, drama editor of a Los Angeles newspaper, summed up the perilous condition for composers imported to Hollywood: in an article announcing Copland’s arrival to score Of Mice and Men, she wrote, “The life of the modern composer in Hollywood usually is very short. In one of the town’s periodic progressive outbursts he may be signed, exploited, and set to work. But the cases of those who have been imported, and actually allowed to complete a motion picture score without dictation, are few, indeed.”8 Harold Clurman, an intimate friend of Copland’s working as a screenwriter in Hollywood, reported to him that Hollywood music directors, who were in control of artistic decisions, were still distrustful of art composers. Even\n\n25\n\nChapter 2\n\ndirectors who were considered more sympathetic, such as Paramount Pictures’ Boris Morros, who attempted to recruit Igor Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg, expressed the need for the art composer to be practical, to adjust, and to be flexible.9 Implied in Morros’s statement is the notion that art composers would not willingly conform to collaborative production requirements. To “adjust” meant to work within Hollywood’s norms and conform to a Romantic or post-Romantic idiom, exemplified by the work of Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Max Steiner, and their contemporaries. And though progressive composers working in Hollywood, such as Werner Janssen (The General Died at Dawn, 1936), George Antheil (The Plainsmen, 1936), and Ernst Toch (Peter Ibbetson, 1935), composed musical moments that stepped outside Hollywood practice and were considered innovative by some critics, their scores nevertheless still fit within the stylistic boundaries of studio expectations. Part of the disconnection between these two camps lay in the fact that most modernists knew nothing about Hollywood and its practices, to the astonishment of Copland, although the American popular press reported these developments in articles by journalists and occasionally by the film composers themselves.10 This lack of awareness discouraged meaningful critical engagement with the specialized nature of the industry. Their naïveté helped to perpetuate a mystique about Hollywood, one that continually focused on its negative aspects rather than on the professionalism and potential artistry and craft involved in the enterprise.11 Copland’s shift in perspective after working there is a case in point. In contrast, as Hugo Friedhofer and Oscar Levant reported, film composers studied and made it their business to be aware of the newest modernist trends, even though they did not adopt them during this period.12 The communities remained largely isolated from each other. Modern Music, published by the League of Composers and directed toward American modernist composers, constituted one exception, as it had commissioned articles that focused on the new sound film technology as early as 1926. Nevertheless, these authors (mostly composers) wrote primarily about documentary or European films, areas in which some modernists were actively engaged, and they largely ignored Hollywood, viewing it, one presumes, as an enterprise unworthy of consideration. In 1935, when the editors of Modern Music finally called on someone to address Hollywood from the perspective of the industry, they did it primarily through one voice, that of George Antheil, for whom Copland had great respect.13 Antheil’s observations provide both an interesting parallel and a foil to Copland’s own ideas on Hollywood, as well as sharing some perspectives with Eisler. An American who had gained notoriety as a modernist composer in Europe, Antheil had by 1933 returned to the United States as his career began to wane. 26\n\nCopland on Hollywood\n\nHe worked in various film studios as a way to generate income, first in New York and then, beginning in 1936, in Hollywood.14 Though not a central figure in the industry, nevertheless, his observations still carried weight among his modernist musical peers, including Copland, who benefited from his advice.15 After all, Antheil not only identified with them as a group and valued their ideals but also acquired modest personal experience and even some success within the industry. Not a true insider, still he embraced Hollywood as a viable and potentially lucrative professional platform. After publishing two articles on Hollywood, Antheil wrote a regular column for Modern Music entitled On the Hollywood Front (1936–39).16 The title seems apt and a loaded term, alluding to an ongoing military conflict, while the political overtones pointed to the ideals of the recently established Popular Front. Antheil writes with the ethos of an art composer and the tactlessness of a gossip columnist, offering critical assessments of the industry, as well as extensive practical, theoretical, and artistic comments, some useful and pointed, some unreliable. His column is filled with newsy tidbits, ranging from sage advice for his modernist colleagues to cynical criticisms that vacillate between the industry’s glories and its failings. His writings provided one of the few gateways to Hollywood for the modernist musical community, including Copland.17 While Copland’s writings about Hollywood often echo Antheil’s own sentiments and criticisms, nevertheless, Copland’s experience in Hollywood was by and large positive; therefore, he offers a far more encouraging outlook. “No one interested in wider publics, the education of the people, or the general emotional vibrations of the times, can leave motion pictures out of his calculations,” Antheil dutifully explains. Copland, however, was far more enthusiastic, emphasizing that film music is a “revolutionizing force . . . so new, and the possibilities so vast,” while he believes that, historically, Hollywood music “is certain to loom large in any stocktaking of filmdom’s musical achievements.”18 Copland’s working conditions were to some extent more privileged and not subject to the same limitations as those of Hollywood staff composers. He was the sole composer for Of Mice and Men, received more time to complete his projects, and, under Lewis Milestone’s directorship, certainly held more control over the music than most film composers in Hollywood.19 These conditions would have a bearing on his perspective. Copland and the Attraction of Hollywood\n\nNow that Copland had entered the arena of Hollywood, his writings about film music functioned much like his publications devoted to American concert music: to legitimize the medium through critical engagement. He sought 27\n\nChapter 2\n\nto promote film composition as an important part of the American cultural landscape, and he wanted to influence the dialogue about Hollywood. As he retrospectively queried later in his famous Norton lectures, “How are we to make contact with this enormously enlarged potential audience, without sacrificing in any way the highest musical standards?”20 His answer is embedded in these writings. Copland did not shy away from acknowledging the benefits of working in Hollywood: the emphasis is placed on living composers, the composers’ music is needed, they compose every day, their work is relevant, and they are paid well for it. The industry is, at least on the surface, “the most wonderful place for composers” and a “composer’s Eldorado.” Copland completes his positive discussion by hoping that “[Hollywood] might be at some future time for all composers,” not just film composers but also his modernist colleagues.21 He fosters this last position by publishing his first article on Hollywood in Modern Music, a significant decision because of the journal’s modernist orientation. To promote the revisionist history he was now perpetuating, Copland entitled the article “Second Thoughts on Hollywood.” Simultaneously, Copland also recognized the shortcomings of his contemporaries in art music. They seemed to carry the aesthetic burden of creating awe-inspiring objects or masterpieces devised to be admired historically.22 In this characterization, he invokes the term “reverential” and the more derogatory image of “embalmed” to express these notions in an effort to demystify some of the romantic ideals still embraced by the “serious” composer.23 Hollywood is not the place, according to Copland, for this mentality, because above all the film industry is a collaborative enterprise and does not tolerate complete self-expression, autonomy, or aesthetic control on the part of the composer.24 Even Copland, however, chafed at some of the compromises that collaboration in Hollywood demanded, as I discuss below. Despite his own positive experiences with Milestone, Copland nevertheless has made the point that in most cases, the direction of authority in Hollywood seemed to flow one way, from producer to composer, a dictatorial culture in which the studio, not the employee, legally held control over the product and authorship. He saw this system as flawed in the distribution of authority, because composers, not producers, who claimed to be “accurate barometers of public taste” (“If I can’t understand it, the public won’t”), should have the monopoly on understanding musical reception.25 In his writings, Copland employs language that elevates the composer, clearly positioning him as artist, not employee. In his words, once one is engaged, the producer or director should “let him [the composer] decide what is best for the film,” and “the only\n\n28\n\nCopland on Hollywood\n\nway to get the best out of any artist is to let him alone.”26 The comment reflects how Copland saw his own position in Hollywood, working with Milestone on Of Mice and Men, and what he hoped would become the norm. If the system were to change, he believed that “movie music” would in the future define both an artistic genre and a specialized musical style characteristic of the unique forms and strategies of the medium.27 But Copland saddles much of the blame for this working culture on the film composers themselves. They have become so obligingly attentive to everything the producer or director says because at the bottom line, their livelihood depends upon it. This harsh depiction portrays the Hollywood film composer as unprincipled and only concerned with “a house and tennis courts and all the other things that composers don’t usually invest in.”28 Simultaneously, Copland invokes the romantic notion of the starving artist while revealing a double standard, since he too concerned himself with Hollywood’s financial rewards.29 Nevertheless, film composers never unionized to protect some of their autonomy (as did other creative sectors within the industry) because they wanted to preserve the fiction of their artistic pretensions, a fiction many were more than willing to reinforce and perpetuate, as they did in their memoirs, particularly in regard to questions of musical authority and authorship.30 Despite this posturing, however, the reality of the matter was that the success of the film composer depended on his or her willingness to work within the industry’s authoritative structure. Yet the restrictive trends that coincided with the high economic stakes of a commercial production made it difficult for serious composers to adapt to the production modes of Hollywood. In comparison, European composers who worked in film, many from the art music tradition, such as Arthur Honegger, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, and Benjamin Britten, were not under the same controls imposed by the Hollywood studio system. As Copland put it, his European colleagues were able to create “serious” film scores because “they are all composers primarily, and film composers in the second place.”31 They subscribed to individualism and originality, while imitation seemed to be the requisite ideal in Hollywood. The truth, however, was that European composers were not threatened by mass-market production. Because their studios produced fewer films per year and spent much less money per production, there was less financial risk involved.32 Composers, therefore, could develop long-term relationships with directors, working together side by side in the production of each film, and they had the luxury to experiment. Copland felt himself to be very fortunate to work on Of Mice and Men, a motion picture that spoke to his own ideals\n\n29\n\nChapter 2\n\nand values.33 Immediately following his experience on this film, Copland was asked to write music for another, an invitation he declined because he felt the picture was not deserving.34 In comparison, Hollywood studio composers on contract were not in a position to make such decisions. In essence, Copland’s situation was exceptional. The “Serious Composer’s” New Dramatic Art Form\n\nCopland viewed film as a hybrid dramatic musical form, a compositional category that borrowed heavily from some of the techniques of opera, including an adaptation of Wagner’s musical concept of the leitmotif. Yet while he recognized similarities between the two genres, he also saw that the requirements of cinema posed new and unexplored problems for the composer, some of which had yet to be solved by Hollywood’s composers. One of these was the leitmotif, a basic strategy exploited or perhaps corrupted (as Eisler and Adorno might say) in the earliest nondiegetic scores.35 In the hands of early film composers, the leitmotif became a musical signifier assigned to a character, concept, or scenic event; the leitmotif was closely keyed to screen events and reinforced by its repetition.36 Copland recognized that Max Steiner, one of the most celebrated early film composers in Hollywood, helped to conventionalize the use of the leitmotif in classical Hollywood film scores, but he felt that the technique was exploited indiscriminately and mechanically to save time rather than for artistic value. And although Copland later applied a loosely conceived form of what he called “leitmotif style” in the 1949 film The Heiress, nevertheless, his reaction to the practice remained highly critical. Copland pondered whether audiences were actually aware of the thematic device, which he felt operated as a redundancy in cinema.37 Copland explains that in cinema, if the leitmotif is taken out of the context of Wagnerian opera, where the device is integrated into a larger musical fabric and developed dramatically and psychologically, and strictly imposed as an audible marker, the results become farcical: “One theme announced the Indians, another the hero. In the inevitable chase, every time the scene switched from Indians to hero the themes did, too, sometimes so fast that the music seemed to hop back and forth before any part of it had time to breathe.”38 Here Copland is addressing the artificial and noticeable structural articulations that occur in the rapid shifts that he describes. The juxtaposition of contrasting musical themes brings them to the attention of audiences, paradoxically, and in turn breaks the screen’s illusion of reality, a contravention of Hollywood’s classical practice. Copland reveals that leitmotifs in a context of\n\n30\n\nCopland on Hollywood\n\ncrosscutting and edits cannot sonically yield to the discontinuity inherent in montage. His solution is that if one subscribes to the use of a leitmotif, then it was more appropriate to connect the theme to a larger and more general underlying idea in order to express either the film’s overarching atmosphere or its narrative concept and not a specific character or scenic event.39 It was an approach that Copland employed in Of Mice and Men, where he used a recurring theme to portray the hopes and dreams of the two protagonists, as I discuss in chapter 3. Although Copland connected the theme to these two characters, each musical repetition, nevertheless, helps to develop the film’s larger concept of hope in a fallen world, and this is the theme’s stronger association. Used in a more subtle application like this one, the leitmotif can function as a powerful aspect of the film’s narrative construction in what Copland would later identify as an idea and a thought that cannot be seen visually in the screen events, the “psychological refinements—the unspoken thoughts of a character or the unseen implications of a situation.”40 In addition, Copland felt that Mickey Mousing, the musical rendering of physical actions on-screen, was absurd under dramatic situations.41 As with the leitmotif, the effect often elicited potentially humorous and unnatural attention away from the main dramatic narrative by reinforcing trivial visual elements. Steiner was best known for Mickey Mousing’s exploitation in dramatic films, and it was in this context that Copland criticized the technique. In his score for Of Human Bondage, for example, Steiner provided a musical gesture to depict and emphasize the clubfoot of the main protagonist, a medical student played by Leslie Howard. Because the handicap was a minor aspect of the film’s narrative, the musical gesture created a completely irrelevant commentary focusing on the character’s disability. Steiner’s music, in Copland’s words, was an “unfortunate effect.”42 Copland strongly felt that the industry’s musical pallet required far more stylistic diversity because it had become too familiar and clichéd, not least because of the constraints of time under which composers habitually worked.43 In view of the fact that film composers had drawn, for the most part, on the same strategies initially introduced by Steiner in the early 1930s, Copland lamented that Hollywood continued to employ a kind of stylistic borrowing, pastiche, or model composition based upon a limited range of musical sources that invoked the symphonic styles of Romantic and post-Romantic idioms. A variety of modern critics have explored the justification for the sustained use of those styles whether through precedents established in silent film, culturally through the influence of European émigré composers, or methodologically as part of film’s appropriation of Wagnerian principles.44 Copland, however, views the overuse\n\n31\n\nChapter 2\n\nof these styles in terms of reception, as a method that creates easy intelligibility and expressive emotionalism.45 In the opening chapter of his book Our New Music, he reiterates the idea that music lovers who are more familiar with nineteenth-century idioms will find the music easier to understand because it has the ability to exert an “almost hypnotic effect” and to “induc[e] psychological reactions in the hearer.”46 Later, in the second edition of What to Listen for in Music, Copland subscribed to the Marxist notion (coinciding with Eisler’s views) that listeners do not want to be disturbed by something provocative or innovative; instead, they want to be consoled from the stress of life by using music as a relaxant, a “soporific.”47 From Copland’s observations, romantic idioms would seem to suit the very nature of the classical Hollywood film, which the preamble to the industry’s Production Code defined as “entertainment” and, as such, typically centered on fantasy, illusion, romance, and escape.48 Although the political environment during the 1930s influenced filmmakers to create more realistic contemporary narratives (as was the case with Milestone and John Ford in his picture The Grapes of Wrath), many film composers within the authoritarian studio system, which feared musical innovation, persisted in overusing the thick symphonic idiom. This style had the tendency to evoke the same emotional reaction no matter the narrative, as Copland saw.49 His plea for differentiation was, of course, an appeal to modernist scores, especially in realistic dramatic portrayals such as Of Mice and Men, for which Copland of course provided a modernist score, or “hard-boiled” films like Golden Boy, a 1939 drama about boxing, which, unfortunately by Copland’s standards, had a conventional Hollywood score. Consequently, in order to muster a spectrum of emotional possibilities, scores needed to explore a variety of approaches and new styles; these, according to Copland, were imperatives.50 Finally, Hollywood brought composers into the production process only after the film was completed, as was the case for Copland, a condition he lamented.51 He only began work on Of Mice and Men once Milestone had completed the rough cut of the film, a circumstance that undermines what Copland himself would consider true artistic amalgamation and collaboration by isolating the composer from the narrative or visual process. Hanns Eisler shared this opinion. His experiences in European film conventionally allowed him to begin during the earlier preparatory stages of the film’s production process. Of course, as Copland acknowledged, working relationships depended on the nature of individual producers and their flexibility.52 American composer Werner Janssen, for example, reported that while working on The General Died at Dawn (1936) he participated in the early story conferences and so was able to work closely with the director and writer.53 The result was that the music 32\n\nCopland on Hollywood\n\nand narrative could grow together, a symbiosis that helped to establish a more unified and integrated artistic design. Nevertheless, Janssen’s experiences were the exception and not the rule. The Process\n\nCopland devotes a significant amount of discussion to describe the various stages in the process of creating a Hollywood film score, detailing the contributions of collaborators such as arrangers, music editors, and other personnel who facilitated each step. And while he recognized that filmmaking is a collaborative process, simultaneously, he undermined his collaborators and their efforts, retaining the romanticized perspective of the autonomous art composer. Copland, for example, portrays many of those who worked alongside him as “henchmen” rather than professional colleagues, unmasking the hierarchical nature of the process.54 Here, the image of collaboration invokes a dubious authority from the top that controls a community of followers whose sole purpose is to protect the studio methods from any creative notion that a modernist art composer might inflict on the score. Rather than acknowledging what Nathan Platte has described as the negotiated space, Copland instead saw his score purged and debased as the production took a toll on his independent and autonomous labors. He retained a negative perspective regarding certain aspects of the collaboration while also expressing his frustrated desire for control. The first task, according to Copland, was to provide a temp track, a temporary soundtrack using preexisting music as a stand-in until the completion of the commissioned score.55 Unfortunately, he provides no information c"
