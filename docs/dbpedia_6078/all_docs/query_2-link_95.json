He left no known surviving recordings, but he was known for his very loud sound and constant improvisation.\n\nWhile there is substantial first-hand oral history about Buddy Bolden, facts about his life continue to be lost amidst colorful myth. Stories about him being a barber by trade or that he published a scandal sheet called The Cricket have been repeated in print despite being debunked decades earlier. Reputedly, his father was a teamster.\n\nBolden suffered an episode of acute alcoholic psychosis in 1907 at the age of 30. With the full diagnosis of dementia praecox, he was admitted to the Louisiana State Insane Asylum at Jackson, a mental institution, where he spent the rest of his life.\n\nBolden was buried in an unmarked grave in Holt Cemetery, a pauper's graveyard in New Orleans. In 1998 a monument to Bolden was erected in Holt Cemetery, but his exact gravesite remains unknown.\n\nMany early jazz musicians credited Bolden and the members of his band with being the originators of what came to be known as \"jazz\", though the term was not yet in common musical use until after the era of Bolden's prominence. At least one writer has labeled him the father of jazz. He is credited with creating a looser, more improvised version of ragtime and adding blues to it; Bolden's band was said to be the first to have brass instruments play the blues. He was also said to have taken ideas from gospel music heard in uptown African American Baptist churches.\n\nInstead of imitating other cornetists, Bolden played music he heard \"by ear\" and adapted it to his horn. In doing so, he created an exciting and novel fusion of rag-time, black sacred music, marching-band music and rural blues. He rearranged the typical New Orleans dance band of the time to better accommodate the blues; string instruments became the rhythm section, and the front-line instruments were clarinets, trombones, and Bolden's cornet. Bolden was known for his powerful, loud, \"wide open\" playing style. Joe \"King\" Oliver, Freddie Keppard, Bunk Johnson, and other early New Orleans jazz musicians were directly inspired by his playing.\n\nNo known recordings of Bolden have survived. His trombonist Willy Cornish asserted that Bolden's band had made at least one phonograph cylinder in the late 1890s. Three other old-time New Orleans musicians, George Baquet, Alphonse Picou and Bob Lyons also remembered a recording session (\"Turkey in the Straw\", according to Baquet) in the early 1900s. Researcher Tim Brooks believes that these cylinders, if they existed, may have been privately recorded for local music dealers and were never distributed in bulk.\n\nSome of the songs first associated with his band such as the traditional song \"Careless Love\" and \"My Bucket's Got a Hole in It\", are still standards. Bolden often closed his shows with the original number \"Get Out of Here and Go Home\", although for more \"polite\" gigs the last number would be \"Home! Sweet Home!\".\n\n\"Funky\"\n\nOne of the most famous Bolden numbers is a song called \"Funky Butt\" (known later as \"Buddy Bolden's Blues\"), which represents one of the earliest references to the concept of \"funk\" in popular music, now a musical subgenre unto itself. Bolden's \"Funky Butt\" was, as Danny Barker once put it, a reference to the olfactory effect of an auditorium packed full of sweaty people \"dancing close together and belly rubbing.\" Other musicians closer to Bolden's generation explained that the famous tune actually originated as a reference to flatulence.\n\nI thought I heard Buddy Bolden say,\n\nFunky-butt, funky-butt, take it away.\n\nThe \"Funky Butt\" song was one of many in the Bolden repertory with rude or off-color lyrics popular in some of the rougher places Bolden played, and Bolden's trombonist Willy Cornish claimed authorship. It became so well known as a rude song that even whistling the melody on a public street was considered offensive. However, the strain was incorporated into the early published ragtime number \"St. Louis Tickle.\"\n\nBolden is also credited with the discovery or invention of the so-called \"Big Four\", a key rhythmic innovation on the marching band beat, which gave embryonic jazz much more room for individual improvisation. As Wynton Marsalis explains, the Big Four was the first syncopated bass drum pattern to deviate from the standard on-the-beat march. The second half of the Big Four is the pattern commonly known as the habanera rhythm, one of the most basic rhythmic cells in Afro-Latin and sub-Saharan African music traditions.\n\nSidney Bechet wrote and composed \"Buddy Bolden Stomp\" in his honor.\n\nDuke Ellington paid tribute to Bolden in his 1957 suite \"A Drum is a Woman\". The trumpet part was taken by Clark Terry.\n\nThe Bolden band tune \"Funky Butt\", better known as \"Buddy Bolden's Blues\" since it was first recorded under that title by Jelly Roll Morton, has been covered by hundreds of artists, including Dr. John in his Goin' Back to New Orleans and Hugh Laurie in his record \"Let Them Talk\".\n\nIn 2011, Interact Theater in Minneapolis created a new musical theater piece entitled Hot Jazz at da Funky Butt in which Buddy Bolden was the feature character. Music and Lyrics were composed by Aaron Gabriel and featured the New Orleans Band \"Rue Fiya\". The song \"Dat's How Da Music Do Ya\" featured the Buddy Bolden Blues.\n\n\"Hey, Buddy Bolden\" is a song on the album, Nina Simone Sings Duke Ellington.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1877 - Petar Stojanovic, composer is born.\n\nin 1882 - John Powell, American pianist, composer, and ethnomusicologist, is born at Richmond, Va. His father was a schoolteacher, and his mother an amateur musician. He received his primary musical education at home, then studied piano with F.C. Hahr, a pupil of Liszt. He subsequently entered the University of Va. (B.A., 1901) and then went to Vienna, where he studied piano with Leschetizky (1902-07) and composition with Navratil (1904—07). He gave successful piano recitals in Paris and London; returning to the U.S., he toured the country as a pianist, playing some of his own works. His most successful piece was Rapsodie negre for Piano and Orchestra, inspired by Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness; Powell was the soloist in its first performance with the Russian Symphony Orchestra (N.Y., March 23,1918). The titles of some of his works disclose a whimsical propensity. Perhaps his most important achievement lies in ethnomusicology; he methodically collected rural songs of the South; was the organizer of the Va. State Choral Festivals and of the White Top Mountain Folk Music Festivals. A man of versatile interests, he was also an amateur astronomer, and discovered a comet. – Died at Charlottesville, Va., Aug. 15, 1963.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1883 - Percy Heming, English baritone, is born at Bristol.

In his music, he combined the elements of the cosmopolitan modem idiom with strong Hungarian rhythms and folklike melodies; in his treatment of these materials, and particularly in the energetic asymmetrical passages, he was closer to the idiom of Bartok than to that of Kodaly. The lyrical element in modal interludes adds to the Hungarian charm of his music. – Died at Budapest, March 30, 1983.\n\nin 1904 - Lyubomir Pipkov, composer is born.\n\nin 1908 - Paul Lavalle, Beacon NY, bandleader (Cities Service Band of America) is born.\n\nin 1912 - Wayne Barlow, American composer, pedagogue, organist, and choirmaster, is bonr at Elyria, Ohio.

His parental name was Kashareftsky, which his parents Americanized to Kraft. The family moved to Calif. and Kraft began to study piano. He took music courses at San Diego State College and at the Univer of Calif. at Los Angeles, where he also had professional percussion instruction with Murray Spivack. In 1943 he was called to arms, and served in the U.S. forces as pianist, arranger, and drummer in military bands; while in Europe with the army, he attended music courses at the University of Cambridge. Returning to the U.S. after discharge from military duty, he earned a living as percussionist in jazz bands.\n\nIn the summer of 1948 he enrolled in the Berkshire Music Center in Tanglewood, where he studied composition with Fine and conducting with Bernstein. In 1949 he entered Columbia University, where his instructors in composition were Beeson, Luening, Bingham, Ussachevsky, and Cowell; he also attended classes in musicology with Hertzmann and Lang (B.S., 1951; M.A., 1954). He continued to perfect his technique as a percussionist, and took lessons with Morris Goldenberg and Saul Goodman; he attained a high degree of virtuosity as a percussion player, both in the classical tradition and in jazz.\n\nIn 1955 he became a percussionist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, retaining this position until 1981. In the meantime he developed his natural gift for conducting; from 1969 to 1972 he served as asst. conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic; in a parallel development, he composed assiduously and successfully. From 1981 to 1985 he was composer-in-residence of the Los Angeles Philharmonic; also founded the Los Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group, presenting programs of modern works for chamber orchestra combinations.\n\nFrom 1988 to 1990 he was a visiting professor at the University of Calif. at Los Angeles. He held 2 Guggenheim fellowships (1967, 1972). As a composer, he explores without prejudice a variety of quaquaversal techniques, including serial procedures; naturally, his music coruscates with a rainbow spectrum of asymmetrical rhythms. There is a tendency in the very titles of his works toward textured constructivism, e.g., Momentum, Configurations, Collage, Encounters, Translucences, Triangles, and Mobiles; but there are also concrete representations of contemporary events, as in Contextures: Riots-Decade '60.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1925 - Jimmy Reed, Mississippi, blues singer (Soulin', Big Boss Man) is born. A country blues guitarist, Jimmy Reed was reared in a Mississippi sharecropping family. After passing through a gospel vocal group, Reed was taught to play guitar by childhood friend and future blues star, Eddie Taylor. Settling in the Chicago area in 1947, Reed worked in the steel mills. Accompanying himself on the guitar and harmonica, he also landed an occasional stage gig. Buying a table-top record-making machine, Reed peddled his amateur recordings to Vee-Jay Records in 1953.\n\nReunited in the studio with Eddie Taylor, Reed scored a local hit with 'Found My Baby' (1953). But with several follow-up singles garnering little attention, Reed took a job as a butcher for Armour meats. With the release of a nearly two-year-old track 'You Don't Have To Go', Reed scored his first national hit and was able to quit his day job. Grounded in a backwoods Delta style, Reed's hit run continued with 'Ain't That Lovin' You Baby' (1956), 'Can't Stand To See You Go' (1956), 'You've Got Me Dizzy' (1956), and a crossover pop hit, 'Honest I Do' (1957). With the popularity of blues waning in the early Sixties, Reed's last major hit came in 1961 with his self-penned and often recorded standard, 'Bright Lights Big City'. Abusing alcohol since navy days, Reed began missing concerts as his health failed.\n\nFollowing Vee-Jay's bankruptcy in 1965, Reed recorded for a series of labels beginning with Exodus. Suffering a severe epileptic seizure in 1969, Reed spent the next three years convalescing. Finally quitting the bottle in 1975, Reed died a year later. He died in San Francisco after performing at the Savoy Club in nearby Oakland. A myth later circulated that Reed was buried in a whiskey-shaped coffin. - Died August 29, 1976.\n\nin 1926 - Aaron Schroeder (American songwriter; Elvis Presley/Roy Orbison/many more) is born.\n\nin 1926 - Fred Below is born.

He studied violin and composition at the National University (1949-53), and in 1954 he went to Paris to study violin at the Ecole Cesar Franck and music history and analysis at the Sorbonne (1956-58). He also studied with Jolivet and Messiaen at the Paris Conservatory. In 1959 he returned to Taiwan, where his first concert (1960), which introduced avant-garde ideas to Taiwan audiences, met with both censure and enthusiasm. He taught advanced composition techniques and founded several organizations to promote contemporary music, including the Chinese Composers' Forum (1961) and the Chinese Society for Contemporary Music (1969); he also was active in the League of Asian Composers. Hsu made extensive study of Taiwanese folk music, elements of which are integrated into his compositions. He co-founded the Centre for Chinese Folk Music Research (1967), and was appointed examiner in charge of folk-music research by the Taiwanese provincial government (1976). He held professorships at the National Academy of Arts, Soochow University, and the College of Chinese Culture, and lectured throughout East Asia and the U.S. His early compositions show a variety of influences, including aspects of impressionism, atonality, and serialism, along with traditional Chinese and Taiwanese elements; his later works are less aggressively modern, but have a distinctive identity and unified style. His writings reflect his interest in folk music research.\n\nin 1932 - Gilles Tremblay, Canadian composer, teacher, and pianist, is born at Arvida.

[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hadley was born in Somerville, Massachusetts, to a musical family. His father, from whom he received his first musical instruction in violin and piano, was a secondary school music teacher, his mother was active in church music, and his brother Arthur went on to a successful career as a professional cellist. In the Hadley home, the two brothers played string quartets with their father on viola and the composer Henry Gilbert on second violin.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hadley also studied harmony with his father and with Stephen Emery, and, from the age of fourteen, he studied composition with the prominent American composer George Whitefield Chadwick. Under Chadwick's tutelage, Hadley composed many works, including songs, chamber music, a musical, and an orchestral overture.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1893, Hadley toured with the Laura Schirmer-Mapleson Opera Company as a violinist. But he left the tour when the company encountered financial difficulties and was unable to pay his salary.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1894, he travelled to Vienna to further his studies with Eusebius Mandyczewski. Hadley loved the artistic atmosphere of the city, where he could attend countless concerts and operas, and where he occasionlly saw Brahms in the cafes. He heard Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony while there, and it made a strong impact on him. During this period Hadley also befriended the German-American conductor Adolf Neuendorff, who gave him advice regarding his compositions.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Professional life[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He returned to the United States in 1896 and took a position as the musical instructor at St. Paul's Episcopal School for Boys in Garden City, New York, where he worked until 1902. He wrote some of his important early compositions during his time there, including his overture In Bohemia, and his first and second symphonies. He also found prominent conductors to perform them, such as Walter Damrosch, Victor Herbert, John Philip Sousa, and Anton Seidl. Hadley made his own debut as a conductor on 16 January 1900, at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, leading a program mostly made up of his own works.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In an age when American orchestras preferred European conductors to home grown ones, Hadley felt that he needed to establish himself in Europe. So he returned to Europe in 1904 to tour, compose, and study with Ludwig Thuille in Munich. It is possible that his studies with Thuille were suggested by Richard Strauss, whom Hadley met shortly after arriving in Europe. Hadley composed his symphonic poem Salome in 1905, not realizing that Strauss, whom he greatly admired, was working on an opera on the same subject. The work was eventually performed in at least 19 European cities, and he was invited to conduct it, along with his newly finished third symphony, with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1907. In the same year, he obtained a position as an assistant conductor at the opera house in Mainz. In April 1909, his first opera, Safié, premiered in Mainz under his baton.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Later that year he returned to the United States to take a position as conductor of the Seattle Symphony. In 1911, he became the first conductor of the San Francisco Symphony. Hadley encountered some difficulties in San Francisco, where he tried to turn a group of theater musicians into a first rate orchestra. He brought a number of excellent musicians from the east, including his brother Arthur, to be principals in the new orchestra, but this created some resentments among the locals. Nonetheless, by his departure in 1915, the orchestra had made great strides.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hadley returned to New York in 1915, where he made many appearances as a guest conductor, and premiered many of his best known works. In 1918 he married the lyric soprano Inez Barbour, who thereafter sang many of her husband's works. Between 1917 and 1920 three of Hadley's operas received high-profile premieres, including Cleopatra's Night which bowed at the Metropolitan Opera on 31 January 1920. Hadley conducted some of the performances, becoming the first American composer to conduct his own opera at the Met, and the opera was revived the following season. Several critics judged it the best among the ten American operas to appear at the Met to that point.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1921 Hadley was invited to become the associate conductor of the New York Philharmonic, the first American conductor to hold a full-time post with a major American orchestra. During his years there, his conducting received excellent reviews. As well as occasionally taking the helm for regular Philharmonic concerts, Hadley was assigned to lead stadium concerts during the summer, where he selected many works by American composers. He was eventually asked to regularly select American works for the Philharmonic to perform. He remained in this post until 1927, when he resigned.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In that same year, Hadley was invited to conduct the first half of the season of the Philharmonic Orchestra of Buenos Aires, the first American to conduct the orchestra (the second half was conducted by legendary Clemens Krauss).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1929, Hadley was invited to become the conductor of the newly formed Manhattan Symphony Orchestra. He led the orchestra for three seasons, including an American work in every concert. He then stepped down due to his frustrations with fundraising for the orchestra in the wake of the stock market crash.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1930, was invited to conduct six concerts with the New Symphony Orchestra of Tokyo. His visit to Asia was met with great enthusiasm, and he composed a new orchestral suite, Streets of Pekin, inspired by a side trip to China, and led its world premiere with the Japanese orchestra.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Composing[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Henry Hadley was one of the most performed and published American composers of his day. He considered himself first and foremost an orchestral composer, to which his many overtures, symphonic poems, orchestral suites, and symphonies attest. He also wrote brief concertos for both cello (his Konzertstück) and piano (his Concertino, Op. 131).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Yet he also wrote a large number of stage works, including several operettas and musicals, along with his five operas. Though his operas Azora and Cleopatra's Night received the most attention, his comedy Bianca, which won a prize offered by the American Society of Singers for the best chamber opera in English, perhaps due to its modest demands, received a number of performances during Hadley's lifetime and a few afterwards, even in Japan in the early 1950s.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]During his years in San Francisco, Hadley made friends among the city's elite, which led him to become a member of the exclusive Bohemian Club, for which he wrote three \"music dramas\", designed to be given a single performance outdoors at the Bohemian Grove in Northern California. These works were very similar to operas, but also contained some spoken dialogue. Hadley later adapted music from these works to be performed as orchestral suites.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He also wrote a number of chamber works, although \"he had no compelling desire\" to compose it. He produced a violin sonata, two string quartets, and two piano trios. According to Tawa, his most noteworthy chamber effort was the quintet in a minor for piano and strings, Op. 50, written in 1919.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hadley also wrote a large number of cantatas and oratorios, some of them, such as Resurgam, conceived on a very large scale. His work as a song composer is also noteworthy. Villamil claims that \"Of his nearly 200 songs many can still be recommended for their unaffected, buoyant lyricism.\"[5] She praises their \"supple vocal lines\" that are \"sensitive to poetic concerns\" and accompaniments that \"can be inventive and provocative.\" One of his choruses from The New Earth titled, \"Song of the Marching Men,\" has been recorded.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hadley was also a pioneer in film music. He was invited by Warner Bros. to conduct The New York Philharmonic for the soundtrack music for its 1926 film, Don Juan with John Barrymore; this was the first feature film with synchronized music and sound effects. He was also filmed with the New York Philharmonic conducting the overture to Wagner's opera Tannhäuser. He wrote a complete original score for the 1927 Barrymore film When a Man Loves.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1933, Hadley founded the National Association for American Composers and Conductors, which exists to this day. In spite of a cancer diagnosis in 1932, he decided to pursue his dream of establishing a summer classical music festival.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the Spring of 1934 Hadley scouted the Berkshire Hills of western Massachusetts for a site and support for his seasonal music festival. The region's well known Gilded Age summer colony had not entirely faded in spite of the Great Depression. Hadley's inquiries led to the formidable and cultured Gertrude Robinson Smith. Within a few months they staged three days of concerts in August with Hadley conducting sixty-five members of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. The first concert on August 23 was under the stars before an audience of 3,000, including Mrs. James Roosevelt, the President's mother. For two more summers Hadley and Smith worked to achieve their vision of an permanent seasonal music festival. Initially known as the Berkshire Symphonic Music Festival, it soon became known as Tanglewood.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hadley's cancer surgery was initially successful, and he continued his career as a composer and guest conductor. However, his popularity as a composer began to wane, as popular and especially critical opinion turned against the robust romanticism which Hadley's music embodied. The quick success of the Berkshire Philharmonic Festival's first three seasons was a dream fulfilled at the end of his life. Hadley's cancer recurred, and he died in New York City on September 6, 1937.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]During his lifetime he was awarded several honors: an honorary doctorate from Tufts University in 1925, membership in the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the Order of Merit from the French government.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The majority of Hadley's personal papers and scores are housed in the Music Division of The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. During his lifetime, Hadley's music was immensely popular, and was a regular part of the repertory of America's top orchestras, and was also performed in Europe. Many legendary conductors performed his music, including Gustav Mahler, Leopold Stokowski, Serge Koussevitzky, and Karl Muck. In recent years his music has been largely neglected, although a few recordings of his music have been issued. An enduring aspect of his legacy is Tanglewood, the realization of his dream to create a classical summer music festival.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1937 - Wolf-Dieter Hauschild, German conductor, is born at Greiz.

He then played bass guitar for Stevie Wonder and other popular musicians (1969-73); during this time he also made hundreds of transcriptions of recorded solos by John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy, and Charlie Parker, which he has sold through the mail. His Coltrane transcriptions are legendary for their meticulous detail and because he has transcribed every commercially issued recording as well as a number of broadcasts. In 1976 he arranged the music for and performed in the big-band tribute to Coltrane at the Newport in N.Y.Jazz Festival. He has since focused on performing jazz, playing alto and soprano saxophone as a sideman to Elvin Jones and Beaver Harris.\n\nin 1944 - Roger Waters, Cambridge England, rock bassist (Pink Floyd-Wall) is born.\n\nin 1944 - Aki Takahashi, innovative Japanese pianist, sister of Yuji Takahashi, is born at Kakamura. She studied first with her mother, then with Yutaka Ito, (Miss) Ray Lev, and George Vasarhelyi at the Tokyo University of the Arts (M.A., 1969). She made her public debut in Tokyo in 1970; her European debut followed in 1972. While acknowledged for her classical musicianship, she is particularly lauded for her imaginative interpretations of contemporary music; among the composers who have written works for her are Cage, Rzewski, Yuasa, Feldman, and Satoh.\n\nHer recording career is also distinguished; her Aki Takahashi Piano Space (20 works, including those by Berio, Boulez, Cage, Stockhausen, Webern et al.) earned her the Merit Prize at the Japan Art Festival in 1973. Her series of Satie concerts performed in Tokyo (1975-77) heralded the so-called \"Satie Boom\" in Japan and resulted in her 3572 editing and recording the composer's complete piano works; other noteworthy recordings include Triadic Memories (Feldman), Planetary Folklore (Mamoru Fujieda), Eonta (Xenakis), and L'Histoire de Babar (Poulenc).\n\nHer Hyper Beatles (1990- ) features arrangements of Beatles songs by internationally recognized composers.

An outlandish, androgynous, glitter-wearing Seventies disco star, \"Sylvester\" James was born and raised in south Los Angeles. Growing up in a Pentecostal church, he toured professionally as a child on the gospel circuit under the guidance of his grandmother, a blues singer in the Thirties. Moving to San Francisco in 1967, he joined a musical troupe called The Cockettes, an all-male drag revue that sang show tunes. Quitting in 1972 to attempt a solo career, Sylvester appeared in the Los Angeles production of Hair.\n\nInitially assuming the stage name of Ruby Blue, he performed in the style of a torch singer like Billie Holiday (whom he claimed as a cousin); during this period, he began hormonal therapy to alter his gender. Signed to Blue Thumb Records in 1973, Sylvester and his backing group, The Hot Band (which featured future Journey guitarist Neil Schon), recorded two unsuccessful albums; tackling rock material with his funky gospel-trained falsetto, Sylvester was unable to find an audience. Rediscovered in 1977 by Fantasy Records A&R man Harvey Fuqua (formerly of The Moonglows), Sylvester embraced the disco craze. From his second Fuqua-produced album, Step II (1978), the cross-dressing, overweight, and openly homosexual performer was thrust into the national limelight with two high-energy disco standards, 'Dance (Disco Heat)' and 'Mighty Real'.\n\nBut with the death of disco in the summer of 1979, Sylvester tried in vain to reignite his career. Releasing a number of albums in the Eighties including, Mutual Attraction (1986), Sylvester scored club hits with 'Do You Wanna Funk?' (1982) and 'Someone Like You' (1987). Sylvester appeared in the 1980 Bette Midler film, The Rose. Sylvester's back-up group, Two Tons Of Fun, included Martha Wash and later evolved into the soul group, The Weather ...... Although it is generally reported that Sylvester succumbed to AIDS, he was never diagnosed. - Died at Oakland, California December 16, 1988.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1948 - Claydes Charles Smith (US lead guitarist, co-founder of Kool & The Gang) is born.\n\nin 1948 - Roger Dean (UK avant-garde jazz pianist, double bassist, vibraphonist) is born.\n\nin 1949 - Jimmy Litherland (English guitarist; Colosseum) is born.\n\nin 1952 - Buddy Miller (American country music singer-songwriter) is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1952 - Jose Forns y Cuadras, composer, dies at 54.\n\nin 1953 - Guy Mitchell was at No.1 on the UK singles chart with 'Look At That ....' his second No.1 this year.

German-Austrian composer born in Leipzig, in 1925 Hanns moved to Berlin, then a hothouse of experimentation in music, theatre, film, art and politics. There he became a member of the Communist Party of Germany and became involved with the November Group and in 1928, he taught at the Marxist Worker's School. He wrote music for several Brecht plays, including The Decision - 1930, The Mother - 1932 and Schweik in the Second World War - 1957. They also collaborated on protest songs that intervened in the political turmoil of Weimar Germany in the early 1930s. Their Solidarity Song became a popular militant anthem sung in street protests and public meetings throughout Europe, and their Ballad of Paragraph 218 was the world's first song protesting laws against abortion. A promising career in the U.S. was interrupted by the Cold War. He was one of the first artists placed on the Hollywood blacklist by the movie studio bosses. In two interrogations by the House Committee on Un-American Activities, the composer was accused of being \"the Karl Marx of music\" and the chief Soviet agent in Hollywood. Among his accusers was his sister Ruth Fischer, who also testified before the House Committee that her other brother, Gerhart, was a major Communist agent. The Communist press denounced her as a \"German Trotskyite.\" Among the works that Eisler composed for the Communist Party was the \"Comintern March\", \"The Comintern calls you / Raise high Soviet banner / In steeled ranks to battle / Raise sickle and hammer\". His supporters, including his friend Charlie Chaplin and the composers Igor Stravinsky, Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein, organized benefit concerts to raise money for his defense fund, but he was deported early in 1948.
