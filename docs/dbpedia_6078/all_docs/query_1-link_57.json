At Drury Lane, Grimaldi performed “Cinderella”, however, a critic dubbed his song and performance as “base,” and Grimaldi left Drury Lane in the fall of 1805 (98). Disher notes that this version of the folklore tale was “strangely perverted” considering Venus, instead of the fairy godmother, is responsible for Cinderella’s eventual triumph. Venus role in the Drury Lane production brought together ballet and melodrama, as it included a ballet of Loves and Graces on the island of Cytherea (303). In 1807, Covent Garden performed Rossini’s “Cenerentola” as “Cinderella, or the Fairy and the Little Glass Slipper.” When Drury Lane burned down, the company moved to the Lyceum and performed a Cinderella pantomime there as well. Disher discusses the styles of various harlequins and pantomime actors from Grimaldi to Charlie Chaplin.

In the days of 'Mother Goose' they made no claim to a literary status. But nowadays they are carefully written by literary men, and aspire to literary merit. We must go back to earlier periods, if we will compare things new with old, when the pantomime was a classical production. Mr. Rich, to whom their English origin is ascribed, merely revived an old classical form of drama. `The Royal Shepherd of Mount Ida' was the favourite subject with the ancient theatres - the audiences of Greece and Rome were entertained with the Shepherd, the Mountain, and the Apple, all of which were to them intelligible objects, and, therefore, especially suitable to pantomimic exhibition. The same principle was extended in the middle ages, and is still in Italy and Spain to the Mysteries and Moralities, and the dramas that are statedly acted in Catholic churches. A previous acquaintance with the subject is needful for the thorough enjoyment of pantomimic action, though the rule has not always been acted upon either in ancient or modern times, and in some instances been mistaken altogether. Serious pantomimes were once as frequent as comic; and it is recorded that they were occasionally found so pathetic that both actors and audiences were equally affected. Tears both on and off the stage were shed in great abundance. But no opportunity has been given of late years for a Tragic Pantomimist to make a reputation...\" (p. 640).]\n\nMarill, Alvin H. \"Cinderella.\" In More Theatre: Stage to Screen to Television.

The \"Principal Boy\" is always played by a woman. \"In former days she was immense of bosom and magnificent of thigh which she slapped like a thunder-clap before singing a popular song in a powerful contralto voice. Although slimmer dotay, she wears the traditional garments. She carries a riding-whip or a jewelled cane, and a cocked hat, usually with an erect feather in it. Over her fine bosom falls a cascade of lace ruffles, and nestling in the lace is a large oval diamond the size of a hen's egg. This jewel, as I see it, symbolizes the feminine genital\" (pp. 128-29). Rather than a sex-change he represents a sex-fusion, which is not the case with the Ugly Sisters, played by men, who are like mean brothers depriving Cinderella of her feminity by abuse—a grotesque masquerade. Cinderella longs for the impossible ideal figured in Principal Boy (both mother and father figure) and cannot appreciate Buttons, who loves her and \"is the only human being in this galaxy of Panto mortals and immortals. He is the one who makes contact with the children in the audience so that they sing together, shout slogans together, laugh and cry together. But Cinderella has no use for reality, or rather, try as she will, she cannot make contact with reality, so she turns from poor Buttons with his human loves and hates to the impossible ideal, Prince Charming\" (p. 129). The Ugly Sisters' attempts to fit their feet into the slipper are castration attempts to have female genitals. Cinderella gets back her feminity. She turns her back on Buttons and is united in a kind of deathlike way (forever after) \"with an ideal combined mother-father figure, the dashing Principal Boy with the long cane and the magnificent bosom\" (p. 130), who makes up for the missing mother and the inept father and completes her mythic dream as the real Buttons could not do.]\n\nWilson, A.

The first pantomime in England was John Weaver's The Cheats; or, the Tavern Bilkers, at Drury Lane Theatre in 1702. John Rich, inventor of the Harlequinade, was the first to describe a play as a pantomime. He was a performer and founder of Covent Garden Theatre. The first Cinderella stage production was in 1804, though the first real pantomime treatment was not until 1864. Cinderella is the most popular of the pantomimes. In 1948 alone, there were 37 different Cinderella productions in England. The first stage production of Aladdin was in 1788 at Covent Garden Theatre. In 1813 it appeared again, with Grimaldi as the dumb slave Kasrac. Includes a chapter on Grimaldi.]\n\nCINDERELLA PANTOMINE SCRIPTS\n\nCinderella, or The Glass Slipper. A Pantomime Ballet in Two Acts. Performed at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane 24 December 1803. Application submitted to the Lord Chamberlain 17 Dec. 1803, by John Bannister, of the Theatre Royal. Huntington Library Manuscript, Larpent Coll 1396.\n\n[Cast: The Prince, Cupid, Hymen, Page, Pedro; Venus, the Graces, Cinderella, Two Sisters, Fairy. The play, a ballet, alternates miming dance with music in the form of recitatives, arias, and choruses. Sc. 1: Bower of Venus. The Immortals sing praises to Venus, who announces her plan. The Prince appears and the immortals entertain him with a dance while Cupid fixes an arrow in his heart. Sc. 2: The Palace of the Prince. The Prince dreams beside a statue of Diana. Sc. 3: A Mean Apartment. Cinderella tends the fire. Voices call from off stage insulting her and demanding work. A wrinkled old woman leading a ragged boy enters begging. Cinderella gives them bread and water. Instantly they are transformed into a beautiful female and lovely page. With a wave of the wand Cinderella is transformed too, and then Pedro as well. The little page fondles Cinderella, a sign of love twining himself around her heart. Sc. 4: The Ball Room. Cinderella appears, accompanied by Pedro and the page. The Prince is delighted and dances with her. The clock strikes twelve and Cinderella flees, losing one of the glass slippers. Sc. 5: Cinderella's Apartment. Cinderella throws herself on the floor in despair. A nymph sings a comforting song. Act II. Sc. 1. Nymphs and Venus sing of Cinderella. Sc. 2: An Apartment in the Palace. the Prince dreams then wakens. Sc. 3: The Town. A procession and proclamation of the search for the slipper's owner. Sc. 4: Cinderella's Apartment. News of the proclamation reaches Cinderella. The sisters taunt her, but Cinderella can scarcely conceal her joy. She produces the other slipper, hugs it, and sings an \"Air.\" Sc. 5: Grand Palace. The Prince anxiously awaits in hope that the right woman will appear. At first the sisters would block Cinderella from her chance, but the Prince insists on a fair trial; the slipper fits and Cinderella produces its mate. Both Cinderella and Pedro are transformed. Pedro struts, enjoying his new clothes. Heavenly music is heard. Cupid and Hymen appear holding the nuptial torch. An air welcomes Venus and the chorus sings \"for ever and for ever\" as a dance concludes the play. The script is available on Readex Fiche, without musical score.]\n\nCinderella: A Pantomime: An accurate description of the grand allegorical pantomimic spectacle of Cinderella, as performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; to which is added, A critique on the performance and performers by a lover of the drama, together with the story of Cinderella. London: J. Fairburn, 1804. The pantomime was originally produced at Drury Lane, January, 1804. Music by Michael Kelly (1762-1826). Dir. Mr. Byrne. Scenes designed by Mr. Greenwood. Machinery and costumes by Mr. Johnston, Mr. Underwood, Mr. Banks, and Miss Rein. Cast: Immortals: Hymen (Mr. Byrne), Cupid (Oscar Byrne), Venus (Mrs. Mountain), Nymph commissioned by Venus (Miss Tyrer), The Graces (Miss B. Menage, Miss Seerle, Miss Bristow). Mortals: Prince (Mr. Byrne), Pedro the servant to the sisters (Mr. Grimaldi), the sisters (Mrs. Byrne and Miss Vining), Cinderella (Miss Decamp). With a variety of Pantomimic characters.\n\n[Summary: Venus and her court relax to music on Mt. Ida. In an outburst of delight Venus greets Cupid who affirms that they have captured the Prince in a silver net. He sees Cinderella and Cupid fixes an arrow in his heart. Sc. 2. Prince's Palace. The Prince starts up from bed and seeks frantically the beautiful figure that possesses his heart. He sends invitations to the ball. Sc. 3. Cinderella in the kitchen, surrounded by implements. Pedro tries to help her as she sings \"Heigho, Heigho.\" The sisters join in to mock her. Pedro brings Cinderella food after they leave for the ball. The Nymph appears and transforms her with the touch of a wand. Pedro brings the pumpkin, mice, and lizards that become the transport and entourage to the ball. A grand dress descends from the clouds and fixes on Pedro. The Nymph warns Cinderella about midnight, she enters the carriage and goes to the palace. Sc. 4. The Palace Ballroom, with splendid banquet and music. The Prince sees Cinderella in the dress of his dream and is enchanted. He decorates her with a scarf and diamond ring as tokens of his love. Midnight comes, but Love moves the clock's hands backward, as if to give them another hour. Pedro's watch shows midnight, however, and he's worried. The clock strikes creating confusion. Her dress changes, Pedro's dress flies off too, and he \"commits many laughable blunders by jumping over the tables etc.\" (p. 14). The Prince finds the slipper, kisses it, and places it against his bosom. Sc. 5. On the road. Cinderella is in rags as the Prince's men pass by. The Nymph appears to sing a song of comfort. Pedro enters with the pumpkin, and they go home. The sisters return and the announcement of the Prince's search is made. Sc. 6. Mt. Ida, where Venus, Cupid, and the Nymph sing of their triumph. As they do so the Prince comes with the slipper, various candidates try it on, for ludicrous effect. Pedro introduces Cinderella. The Prince looks into her face lovingly and the slipper fits. She produces its mate from her bosom. The Nymph enters, Hymen attends with his torch, and the Prince and Cinderella kneel at the altar and are made happy. She forgives the sisters and introduces them to two noblemen.\n\nThe critique and its publication have been ascribed to Mr. James. He notes that the grandeur and magnificance of the grand tale has rarely been equalled, never excelled to the infinite credit of the ballet. \"It is perhaps one of the happiest tales that possibly could be selected to instruct and amuse the rising generation. Too much cannot be said, where the morals are kept in view, and virtue held forth in such fascinating colours. How lovely is virtue! How base and degrading is vice!\" (p. 20). The story, which follows the critique is based on Samber's translation of Perrault, where after the first night at the ball Cinderella asks Charlotte for one of her dresses but is denied and mocked as \"Cinderbreech\" for playing \"Miss Pert.\" Another edition of this work was published in 1808.]\n\nHarlequin and Cinderella; or, The Little Glass Slipper. A New Pantomime. Anon. 1820. The application for permission to perform is registered with the Lord Chamberlain by John Fawcett 20 March 1820, with performance at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, beginning 22 March 1820. The pantomime is in manuscript, a part of the Larpent collection, no. 2144, in the Huntington Library. The manuscript is five pages long and includes 14 scenes of dialogue and choruses, in couplets. Characters: Prince Calidore, afterwards Harlequin; Baron Pomposini, afterwards Pantaloon; Pedro, his servant, in love with Cinderella and afterwards Dandinee; the Baroness, afterwards Clown; Clotilda and Tabitha, two sisters; Cinderella, afterwards Columbine; Finetta, the Fairy Godmother to Cinderella.\n\n[Sc. 1. Recitative by Cinderella on her scullery work, her \"doom.\" Sc. 2. The Baron receives news of the ball and reads the invitation that admits the Baron, his lady, and her two daughters. Sc. 3. Finetta the godmother appears, and tells \"Moth and gaudy Fly\" to fetch the pumpkin, trap with dappled mice, the sleek , fat, \"old grey whisker'd Rat\" in the barn, \"six dainty Lizards green,\" and changes Cinderella's dress for the ball, with glass slippers to crown all. Sc.4. Finetta warns Cinderella about the midnight deadline when she must \"be at home.\" Sc. 5 Finetta punishes Cinderella for spurning her command. Cinderella pleads for mercy. The Baroness sides with the Fairy godmother's scolding of Cinderella. But Finetta drives them all away, informing the Prince that Cinderella was the beautiful maiden at the ball that he so loved, and transforming Cinderella into Columbine, the Prince into Harlequin, the Baroness into a clown, the Baron into Pantaloon, and Pedro \"thou poor enamour'd loon\" into Dandinee; that is, until the lost slipper be found. The text then skips to Sc. 14, where Finetta announces: \"The slipper found, your task is o'er, / The pow'r to punish, is no more—/ But in Finetta's Temple, this pair shall prove / The joys that wait on constant love! / Here Cinderella this prize shall win / And in Wedlock's bonds be join'd with Harlequin.\"]\n\nSongs, Duetts, Concerted Pieces and Choruses in the New Comic Opera, in Three Acts, called Cinderella, or the Fairy Queen and the Glass Slipper. The Music composed by Rossini containing choice selections from his operas of Cenerentola, Armida, Maometto 2do, and Guillaume Tell. The scenery by Messrs. Grieve and Finley: The Whole arranged and adapted to the English Stage by and Produced under the direction of M. Rophino Lacy. Performed for the first time at the Theatre Royal Covent Garden, Tuesday, 13 April 1830. London: Wm. Kenneth, 1830. [See also Lacy's Acting Edition under Opera, below, which includes stage directions absent from this edition. This version was frequently performed in America in the 1840s. (See Opera, below). Cast: Felix, Prince of Salerno (Mr. Joseph Wood), Baron Pumpolino of Montefiesco (Penson), Alidoro the Prince's Tutor (Stansbury), Dandini the Prince's Valet (Morley), Pedro the Baron's servant (Keeley), Cinderella (Miss Mary Ann Paton), Clorinda and Thisbe, daughters of the Baron (Cawse and Hughes), the Fairy Queen (Miss H. Cawse); Hunters, attendants, pages, grandees, visitors, Tyrolese Dancers, Sylphs, and Fairies.\n\n[Act I: sc. 1. A chorus of fairies welcome spring with its magic—music fromArmida. The Prince enters, looking for magic. Sc. 2. Hunters' chorus fromGuillaume Tell. Sc. 3: A trio, suggesting a plot akin to Rossini's opening scene, with Clorinda and Thisbe complaining about dress, hair, joy, etc. Cinderella sings repeatedly her \"Once a King there chanc'd to be\" song, to the objection of the sisters. The Fairy Queen appears as a beggar asking for charity. In a quartet the sisters scorn her and Cinderella pities and feeds her. Alidoro appears, announces the Prince and the bride search. Clorinda and Thisbe become increasingly abusive of Cinderella. She sings her \"now run here, now run there\" song. The Baron awakens to the commotion, disclaiming the noisy daughters, and tells, as in La Cenerentola, his dream of the ascending Jack-ass. Sc. 4—unmarked in the libretto. The Prince, presumably in disguise, in recitative explains his visit (his friend has informed him that he will find his bride in this house); he meets Cinderella. In Rossini's duet they question each other and fall in love. Presumably Dandini disguised as the Prince extends the invitation to the ball. Cinderella asks if she might go, if only for an hour. The Baron mocks her in a \"concerted piece\" from Cenerentola in which Alidoro asks after the third daughter, Angelina. The Baron insists she's dead. As in Rossini's opera the quintette sings of their uncertainty and doubt. End of Act I. The libretto skips then to Act II. Sc. 5. Presumably, the people have in the meantime arrived at the Grand Ball. In a \"Dialogued Quartett\" the sisters flirt with Dandini, thinking he is the Prince, and Dandini reveals to the Baron his valet status. They sing a rage and confusion duet. Sc. 2. A chorus from Guillaume Tell comforts the lonely Cinderella—\"Thy friends are nigh!\". Sc. 3. The fairy queen appears (music from Maometto, 2do), prepares Cinderella for the ball, and gives the midnight deadline, warning \"Mock not the Fairies' power.\" Act III. sc. 1: Chorus singing about dancing to music fromMaometto. Sc. 2(?) Tyrolese dances by Mesdames Vedy, Bedfore, and Mr. Albert, with men's and women's choruses about joy and the swift flight of time, and a full chorus on how they will praise the evening when they return home to \"our native mountains.\" The Prince and Cinderella sing a duet from Guillaume Tell about their fear of waking or breaking the spell. Sc. 3 (?). The Corps de Ballet performs to \"Pas de Soldats,\" from Guillaume Tell. The libretto then marks a \"General Waltz\" from Guillaume Tell. Sc. 4 (?). The Prince laments some \"Demon's opposing malice,\" as the chorus comments on his raging passion. Presumably the plot is now following Perrault's glass slipper scenario, perhaps through mime? The next item in the libretto is the chorus hailing Cinderella as Queen. Sc. 5: Finale (Cenerentola). Cinderella sings her song again, now with words defying sorrow: \"Now with grief no longer bending / Shall my heart neglected sigh! / Like the lightning swiftly ending, / Sorrow's clouds for ever fly!\" The chorus picks up the last two lines to end the opera.]\n\nCinderella: A Burlesque Extravaganza by Albert Smith (1816-1860).

General rising of the Fairy population—their Queen relates a famous history, and is interrupted by the arrival of a stray beau—A charming Portrait in an oak frame—Dandini, being excessively inflated, is eventually blown up—the Prince of Salerno assumes the dress of Dandini, and, seeking change, passes off a light sovereign for its mere valet. Sc. 2: Apartment at the Baron's. How Cinderella complains that she leads a life by the galley fire, and is called over the coals by Clorinda—How Thisbe lets down the Baron, and how the Prince makes up to Cinderella. IMPOSING PROCESSION OF ONE! How the supposed Prince is brought on, and how the real Prince is taken off—How the Balderdash family is put to shame by the inopportune appearance of Cinderella. Sc. 3: Another Apartment at the Baron's. Great indignation meeting of the Prince with Dandini, who, having tasted the sweets of a powerful appointment, experiences the bitters of a powerful disappointment; and how he is kicked down stairs for injudiciously showing up his master—How Dandini wounds two birds with one heartless-tone—How the two birds fly at each other—How the parent bird interrupts their beak-ering, and keeps up their peckers in a double sense—I'n segreto d'Importanza. Sc. 4: The Baron's Kitchen. In which a train of thoughts passes over the sleeper, and Buttoni's tender, missing the junction, arrives at an unhappy terminus—How Cinderella's Fairy Godmother redeems her pledge and \"takes her out\"—TO THE BALL. Sc. 5: Corridor in the Prince's Palace. How the Baron is disappointed of his castle in the air, and of his baronial haul—How Clorinda does not go off, but how her admirer does. Sc. 6: GRAND BALL ROOM AT THE PALACE. How Miss Rosina Wright, assisted by a highly efficient and peculiarly distracting Troupe of young ladies, executes a GRAND BALLET! How all the Company STRIKE! How the Mysterious Lady strikes the Prince—How her resemblance to Cinderella strikes the Sister—How the Band strikes up at the command of the Prince—How the Clock strikes at the hour of Twelve. How Cinderella, obeying her instructions, strikes home—How a sudden idea strikes Poppetti—How Cinderella strikes in among her rivals—How the Carpenters \"strike\" the scene, and discover the striking Last Scene, which it is hoped may prove a TREMENDOUS HIT! Sc. 7, and Last being A GORGEOUS TRANSFORMATION SCENE, THE DOMAINS OF DELIGHT!!' This is the first pantomime to introduce Buttons—\"Gard'ner, butler, groom, odd boy, what not.\" Cinderella has been sixteen years in the Fairy Queen's care. FQ remarks on the folly of the king's forcing the Prince to choose his mate precipitously, but announces that all will be well—she will see to that as she makes the face of Cinderella appear in an oak tree, with a ray of sunlight round her countenance. The Prince is staggered. In Sc. 2 Clorinda plans to wow the men by raving about Tennyson \"with girlish rapture.\" When the disguised Prince meets Cinderella he kisses her which makes her feel \"cheap,\" though he says she is all the more \"dear\" for it. In Sc. 3 the \"segreto d'importanza\" is, of course, that Dandini is valet, not Prince. In Sc. 5 Dandini makes a play for Clorinda who thinks it over and concludes having him is better than being a nun in white, burying her beauty. But when she responds he flees—duty calls!]\n\nCinderella, or, Harlequin and the Magic Pumpkin, and the Great Fairy of the Little Glass Slipper: A Pantomime written by the Brothers Grinn. London: Published and sold in the [Royal English Opera] Theatre, [1864]. First performed Monday, 26 December 1864.

Hobgoblin, looking like Robinson Crusoe, plays solitaire whist with two dummy hands to amuse himself and his fiend pets, a Demon Dog, a Goblin Goat, a Phantom Parrot, and a Cabalistic Cat, who perform wild dances around him but are unable to divert his attention. Papillion appears and they discuss the Prince, whom Hobgoblin looks upon as his own—a perpetual bachelor. Papillion says she will get him to marry, but Hobgoblin insists Ugolino is no such nincompoop. Sc. 2: The Butterfly Haunt in the Dell of Delight. Papillion introduces Hobgoblin to her domain where beauties are everywhere and enter into the Grand pas de Papillions, composed and arranged by Mons. Desplaces and danced by Mademoiselles Duchateau, Montero, and Bonfanti, and the ladies of the corps de ballet. Hunting horns sound and Papillion and Hobgoblin make a wager over whether the Prince can be seduced. The Prince appears with Grimguffin, making jokes about hawking. As the Prince rests, Cinderella appears in a vision before him, and he is overwhelmed by her beauty. He sings a song called \"Great Sensation\" and gets so excited that he falls into Grimguffin's arms. Sc. 3: Hall of Baron Pumpolino's mansion. The Baron is trying to shave with the assistance of Pedro. Repeated knocks at the door, produce first the milkman, then the baker, then the butcher, and finally the postman who brings the invitation to the ball. Cinderella wishes she could go but the Baron slaps her and then the sisters attack her too. They hurry off to get ready while Cinderella commiserates with Pedro. Sc. 4: The Baron's Kitchen. The Baron gets out his fiddle to give Thisbe and Clotilda dancing lessons, then they set off, leaving Cinderella by the fire. A vision appears in the fireplace as Papillion enters and prepares Cinderella to awaken the Prince's passion. Milliners and hairdressers appear—artists all—and Cinderella is transformed, while elves fix up Pedro. Pedro fetches a pumpkin, lizards, and mice, and the kitchen changes suddenly into—Sc. 5: A View of the Illuminated Palace. Papillion admonishes them to leave by midnight and a grand march ensues to the Palace. Sc. 6: Grand Vestibule leading to the Ballroom.

The Prince appears, having travelled \"Cook's tour\" the world over, examining the brittle girls of China and the smelly and nautchy but not nice girls of India, to return with no bride but a \"doom\" that there's no place like \"Hulme.\" He sees a vision of Cinderella and dances with her (i.e. Lady Mime), hoping to sleep, perchance to dream. Dandini, Alidoro, and the huntsmen appear, Dandini preening on how the girls prefer him to the Prince and threatening Alidoro to play matchmaker or lose his pay. The Prince decides to change stations with Dandini so that he might find a girl who \"loves me for myself.\" The hunters depart singing. Sc. 4: Ante-Room in the Baron's Castle: The Baron laments his poverty and the hardship of being a father, though he praises Clorinda, his \"sweet aesthetic and Burnes-Jonesy child,\" who finds all eating low, and Thisbe, who is fond of Swinburne, lilies, and \"kisses lank and lean.\" Pedro mocks them as \"cartoons by Ford Madox-Brown.\" Pedro wishes the Prince would marry both of them, but Clorinda declares he's not a Mormon. The Prince and Dandini arrive with the invitations to the ball. Sc. 5: The Baron's Kitchen: Cinderella, alone by the fire, sings a song akin to her opening song in Rossini's opera. Pedro picks up a second verse mentioning the Prince's courtship, then they sing a duet. The Prince appears singing about his \"fallen\" condition. Cinderella sees in him the face she has dreamed of by the fire, and he falls for her too. The two elder sisters enter, mooning about the Prince (Dandini), and declaring themselves \"artful\" things. Cinderella gives them wildflowers she has gathered, but they cast them down, including the shamrock. Dryada appears and comforts Cinderella in a concerted piece with Pedro, then prepares her for the ball. Sc. 6: Approach to the Palace:Alidoro wonders whom the Prince might marry, singing a song \"I'll make a note of that.\" The Baron and the two daughters appear. Alidoro compares them to Sarah Bernhardt on a spree. Dandini reveals that he is the valet. The Baron trio laments, but the girls would gladly settle for the valet. Sc. 7: Illuminated Gardens of the Prince's Palace: The Prince courts Cinderella and sings \"The Gallants of England.\" Sc. 8: The Baron's Kitchen: Cinderella by the fire tells Pedro of her vision and the fact that she's lost her shoe. The trio appear, gossiping about the beauty at the ball. The royal entourage comes by looking for the owner of the lost slipper. Chorus of \"We're all on the job.\" Thisbe's is not a foot but eighteen inches. Pedro and Cinderella appear; the shoe fits her. Clorinda almost faints, but Pedro wants no fits from her. Sc. 9: Finale: Air sung by all of \"Jack.\" Sc. 10: Transformation, entitled \"The Coronation of Cupid,\" designed and painted by W. F. Robson. An interval of five minutes.
