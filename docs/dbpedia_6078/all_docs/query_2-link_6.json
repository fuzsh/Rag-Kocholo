        "text": "Various phases of palpitation of the heart are paraded during the screening of \"Dream of Love,\" a Rurutanian romance inspired by the old French stage offering, \"AdrienneLecouvreur.\" Prince Mauritz, the central figure in these love escapades, for purely patriotic reasons, not only flirts with the Dictator's wife, but he occasionally basks in the glimmering presence of a gold-digging blonde and falls in love with a singer.Fred Niblo, who directed this picture, has given to it much more reason and sparkle than he did to \"Two Lovers.\" In fact, in many respects it is not only an amusing picture, but one that reveals true skill in its direction. Mr. Niblo has elicited from his principals competent work, and he has had the temerity to let the story run without flashing uselessly to the journeying heroine while the more interesting action of the narrative is holding forth. There are toward the end some scenes of great crowds, but whether they were made especially for this production is not known. Their inclusion, is, however, quite effective.Prince Mauritz, impersonated by Nils Asther, is a most immaculately uniformed young man. The Dictator, played by Warner Oland, is wont to refer to the handsome fellow as the \"long-legged Prince.\" This kingdom is evidently in a wretched state, for Prince Mauritz has nothing whatever to say about finance or other matters. The Dictator has a pretty wife, acted by Aileen Pringle, who, either to bring about the downfall of Prince Mauritz or to teach her husband a lesson, frequently visits the Prince. The Prince is in love with Adrienne, a singer with a traveling show. He is, however, eminently successful in casting her from his mind when the Duchess, as the Dictator's wife is known, reports at his apartment.The Dictator finds his attention riveted on a Countess (Carmel Myers), but while she apparently appreciates the elderly person's declaration, of affection in public, she is not opposed to receiving in her abode a Baron. When the Dictator calls her on the telephone she insists that she is all alone, waiting for him to come to see her, and then one perceives the Baron enjoying the Countess's little joke.The Prince, in his eagerness to break up the more or less happy home of the Dictator so as to put that individual out of power, very nearly loses Adrienne, his real love, who latterly appears as a successful actress with a glistening dress.The settings for this production are lavish and so are the costumes. There are dozens of men in smart officers' uniforms and Miss Pringle does well with the Duchess's gowns and sparkling skull caps.Mr. Niblo makes excellent use of the mobile cameras. He follows his characters all over the place and in some scenes he singles out the heroine in a crowd and brings her, as if from a distance, to a close-up.Mr. Asther is capital as the romantic Prince. Mr. Oland leaves no stone unturned to show the pomp and power of the Dictator. Harry Myers, who will be remembered in the now long ago for his clever portrayal in \"A Connecticut Yankee at the Court of King Arthur,\" once again proves himself to be an intelligent and pleasing player.Joan Crawford is charming as the humble singer, who wins stage laurels and subsequently admits her love for the Prince.No sound issued from the screen at the first performance yesterday. Even the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lion refused to roar. It was rather nice, this silence, and one did not object to the organist supplying the accompaniment for the picture.The stage program includes a glimpse of the Capitolian orchestra players all dressed up like Father Christmas. Harland Dixon, the dancer, also interested the audience.Van and Schenck are to be seen in a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer short talking film.\n\nA Rurutanian Romance.DREAM OF LOVE, with Joan Crawford, Nils Asther, Aileen Pringle, Warner Oland, Carmel Myers, Harry Myers, Alphonse Martell and others, based on the French play, \"Adrienne Lecouvreur,\" directed by Fred Niblo; overture, \"Away Down South in Heaven\"; \"Holiday Revels,\" a Mort Harris production; Movietone of Van and Schenck; Dave Schooler and the Capitolians, with Harland Dixon, Al Wohlman and others. At the Capitol.An intermittently cheery and fairly exciting tale of military academy life is now on view at the Roxy Theatre. It bears the title of \"Prep and Pep,\" and a number of the scenes were filmed at the Culver Military Academy in Indiana. David Butler, the director, has succeeded most happily in reflecting the atmosphere of the school together with an amusing conception of the tricks and conduct of the students.The comic side in this adventure is all the more agreeable for being both human and original. There are subtle touches which were thoroughly appreciated by the audience yesterday afternoon. The story is not vastly different from the average college story, but the clever handling of the subject is responsible for unexpected twists.David Rollins, the dimpled cheek youth who appeared in. \"The Air Circus,\" impersonates Cyril Reade, the hero of this swiftly moving chronicle. Malcolm Stuart Boylan, the writer of the titles of the picturization of \"What Price Glory,\" endowed this current presentation with the captions and also gave to it the benefit of his story-telling experience. He introduces Cyril Reade (the son of \"Tiger\" Reade, who, in his day, won many trophies for the academy) as a youth who was \"tutored and tailored in Europe.\" And the best of it is that Cyril looks the part. He never omits to doff his derby to men when he is introduced and nobody could be a softer thing for the boys as they are at the academy. Cyril unwittingly furnishes the other students with plenty of laughs and he becomes the butt of their pranks.In one of the earlier chapters Cyril is forced into a fight with \"Flash\" Wells. It is like setting up a poodle against a terrier. Cyril is pumeled and punched and only the warning of the coming presence of the commandant saves Cyril from further disaster.Cyril is largely responsible for losing a relay race, and the boy who has hitherto been considered the rightful owner of the dumbell cardboard medal gladly surrenders that decoration to Cyril.Toward the end there is a prairie fire in which Cyril not only redeems himself but is awarded a real medal and, to send everybody away happy, he, of course, becomes engaged to the commandant's daughter.Frank Albertson officiates as the mischievous Bunk Hill, who conjures up hilarity at Cyril's expense. Mr. Albertson lends plenty of life and enthusiasm to this part. In fact he makes it so true that it seems as though he were actually a student. John Darrow gives a nice performance as the crack athlete. E. H. Calvert contrives to furnish dignity to the part of the ubiquitous commandant. Nancy Drexel is the engaging young damsel with whom so many of the students are enamored.Mr. Rollins is excellent as the unfortunate son of a college hero. He gives a genuinely affecting portrayal of Cyril's despair and good nature.Although S. L. Rothafel's stage offerings are quite a little too long, they are beautifully conceived. It is a diversion that will appeal to children as well as grownups.Dr. S. Parkes Cadman is heard through the medium of the movietone. Little children saying a few words from the screen about their cats is a delightful bit of speaking screen stuff.\n\nMilitary Academy Students.PREP AND PEP, with David Rollins, Nancy Drexel, John Darrow. E. H. Calvert, Frank Albertson and Robert Peck, directed by David Butler; overture, \"Merry Wives of Windsor\"; English Christmas carols: \"The Nativity\": \"Christmas Greetings,\" with Patricia Bowman, Mickey McKee and others; Fox Movietone News; \"Sleeping Beauty,\" a spectacle In eight scenes. At the Rosy Theatre.Good fun abounds in Bebe Daniels's latest picture, \"What a Night!\" which is now sojourning at the Paramount. It is quite as fractious as any of Miss Daniels's other films, but it is far more amusing. It was directed by Edward Sutherland, who first steered Wallace Beery and Ray-mond Hatton into the path of hilarity. In this current offering, how-ever, Mr. Sutherland is much more original and perhaps less boisterous than he was with the Beery-Hatton comedies. Not only was the audience often in gales of laughter at the ridiculous happenings in this new effusion, but there were times when people actually voiced their dread as to what might happen next.Here Miss Daniels is perceived in the r√¥le of Dorothy Winston, a would-be newspaper reporter. She has a wealthy father, but, having played for a number of years, she seeks to find diversion in work. It chances that she's a natural born jinx. When she shuts the managing editor's door the glass breaks, and when she is garbed in a nice new frock she falls into the river. Just at the moment the flashlight powder is needed to take an important photograph Miss Winston reports that she left it in the hall.For a long while during the latter chapters of this production Miss Winston has to go around with her finger stuck in the nozzle of a fire hose. Even in the final fadeout the nozzle is still on her finger as she clasps her sweetheart in her arms.One can gather some idea of Miss Winston through one of the happenings. She is talking with Joe Madison, who tries to avoid her, when she knocks over a bottle of ink and it spills on Mr. Madison's well-cut and well-pressed suit. Miss Winston is evidently sorry, but she explains to Joe that it is after all \"only ink.\"In the course of the alarming events in search for crooks to save a retraction in the newspaper, Miss Daniels, or a double, is called upon to jump through a series of barrels from the second floor of a structure. She also has to run around a hallway dragging a fire hose after her.When the big story comes, the information is obtained by the society editor, a young man who looks as if he'd like to run away from the story rather than after it. But to give the devil his due, it is he, in spite of Miss Winston, who saves the newspaper from ignominy.Miss Daniels has lost none of her vivaciousness and her zeal for humor. Neil Hamilton as Joe Madison does some very good work. William Austin proves himself, as usual, a reliable comedian. Wheeler Oakman is capital as the leading scoundrel.On the surrounding program is a footlights offering called \"Just Kids.\" It was devised by C. A. Niggemeyer."
