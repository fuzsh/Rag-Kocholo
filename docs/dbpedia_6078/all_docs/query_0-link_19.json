        "text": "Glenn Miller, born Alton Glen Miller, was an American trombonist, composer, arranger and band leader. His swing orchestra was the best selling recording band 1939 – 1942 and the continues playing today. His Army-Air Forces band modernised US military music. He’s your Phantom Dancer feature artist this week.\n\nThe Phantom Dancer is your weekly non-stop mix of swing and jazz from live 1920s-60s radio and TV every week.\n\nLISTEN to this week’s Phantom Dancer mix (online after 2pm AEST, Tuesday 13 August) and weeks of Phantom Dancer mixes online at, at https://2ser.com/phantom-dancer/\n\nGLENN\n\nAt age 10, Miller earned enough money from milking cows to buy his first trombone and played in the town orchestra. He had played cornet and mandolin before switching to trombone.\n\nHe played in his high school orchestra and formed his own dance band in his final high school year. At school, he took classes in harmony, piano, violin, and music appreciation. By the time he graduated he was a professional musician. He missed his own graduation because he was performing out of town. His mother gladly received his diploma for him.\n\nIn 1924 he went to New York City and studied the Schillinger system with Joseph Schillinger, under whose tutelage he composed “Miller’s Tune”. It became his signature theme, “Moonlight Serenade”.\n\nIn 1926, Miller toured with Ben Pollack’s Orchestra as lead trombone and played for Victor Young. This allowed him to be mentored by professional musicians. When Jack Teagarden took over the lead chair in Pollack’s band in 1928, Miller found that his solos were cut drastically. He realised his future was in arranging and composing.\n\nDuring his time with Pollack, he had written several arrangements. He wrote his first composition, “Room 1411”, with Benny Goodman. Brunswick Records released it under the name, “Benny Goodman’s Boys”.\n\nHe had a songbook published in Chicago in 1928 entitled ‘125 Jazz Breaks for Trombone.’\n\nBack in New York City in 1930 he joined Red Nichols and his Five Pennies, playing in the pit bands of Broadway shows, ‘Strike Up the Band’ and ‘Girl Crazy’. That band included Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa. They are all on this 1930 record of Corrine Corrina – vocals by Wingy Manone…\n\n1930s\n\nDuring the late 1920s and early 1930s, Glenn Miller worked as a freelance trombonist in several bands.\n\nOn the 21 March 1928, Victor Records session, he played alongside Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, and Joe Venuti in the All-Star Orchestra directed by Nat Shilkret.\n\nHe arranged and played trombone on several Dorsey Brothers sessions for OKeh Records, including “The Spell of the Blues”, “Let’s Do It” and “My Kinda Love”, all with Bing Crosby on vocals.\n\nOn 14 November 1929, vocalist Red McKenzie hired Miller to play on two records: “Hello, Lola” and “If I Could Be With You One Hour Tonight”. With Miller were saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, clarinetist Pee Wee Russell, guitarist Eddie Condon, and drummer Gene Krupa.\n\nIn the early to mid-1930s, Miller worked as a trombonist, arranger, and composer for the Dorsey Brothers, first, when they were a Brunswick studio group and later, when they formed an ill-fated orchestra.\n\nMiller composed the songs “Annie’s Cousin Fanny”, “Dese Dem Dose”, “Harlem Chapel Chimes”, and “Tomorrow’s Another Day” for the Dorsey Brothers Band in 1934 and 1935.\n\n“Annie’s Cousin Fannie” was recorded on 4 June 1934 in New York and released as Brunswick 6938. The flip side was “Judy”. The song was also released in a second version on a Decca 78 as Decca 117A backed with “Dr. Heckle and Mr. Jive”. A third version was also recorded but not released. Glenn Miller wrote “Annie’s Cousin Fannie”, played trombone on the record, and sang some of the verses. Miller sings the closing verse. The record was banned by some radio stations because of the double entendre lyrics…\n\nRAY NOBLE\n\nIn 1935, he assembled an American orchestra for British bandleader Ray Noble, developing the arrangement of lead clarinet over four saxophones that became a characteristic of his big band. Members of the Noble band included Claude Thornhill, Bud Freeman, and Charlie Spivak.\n\nMiller made his first movie appearance in The Big Broadcast of 1936 as a member of the Ray Noble Orchestra performing “Why Stars Come Out at Night”. The film included performances by Dorothy Dandridge and the Nicholas Brothers, who would appear with Miller again in two movies in 1941 and 1942.\n\nIn 1937, Glenn Miller compiled several arrangements and formed his first band. After failing to distinguish itself from the many bands of the time, it broke up after its last show at the Ritz Ballroom in Bridgeport, Connecticut on 2 January 1938.\n\nBenny Goodman said in 1976: “In late 1937, before his band became popular, we were both playing in Dallas. Glenn was pretty dejected and came to see me. He asked, “What do you do? How do you make it?” I said, “I don’t know, Glenn. You just stay with it.”\n\nSUCCESS\n\nDiscouraged, Miller returned to New York. He realised that he needed to develop a unique sound and decided to make the clarinet play a melodic line with a tenor saxophone holding the same note, while three other saxophones harmonised within a single octave.\n\nGeorge T. Simon discovered 18 year old saxophonist Wilbur Schwartz. Miller hired Schwartz but had him play lead clarinet instead of the saxophone. According to Simon, “Willie’s tone and way of playing provided a fullness and richness so distinctive that none of the later Miller imitators could ever accurately reproduce the Miller sound.”\n\nMiller talked about his style in the May 1939 issue of Metronome magazine. “You’ll notice today some bands use the same trick on every introduction; others repeat the same musical phrase as a modulation into a vocal … We’re fortunate in that our style doesn’t limit us to stereotyped intros, modulations, first choruses, endings, or even trick rhythms. The fifth sax, playing the clarinet most of the time, lets you know whose band you’re listening to. And that’s about all there is to it.”\n\nHere’s Glenn Miller’s Orchestra before the famous sound…\n\nTHE PEAK\n\nIn September 1938, the Miller band began recording for Bluebird, a subsidiary of RCA Victor.\n\nIn the spring of 1939, the band’s fortunes improved with a date at the Meadowbrook Ballroom in Cedar Grove, New Jersey, and then at the Glen Island Casino in New Rochelle, New York. The Glen Island performance attracted a record-breaking opening-night crowd of 1,800.\n\nIn 1939, Time magazine noted: “Of the 12 to 24 discs in each of today’s 300,000 U.S. jukeboxes, from two to six are usually Glenn Miller’s.”\n\nHis band played at Carnegie Hall, 6 October 1939.\n\nIn 1940, the band’s version of “Tuxedo Junction” sold 115,000 copies in the first week.\n\nFrom December 1939 to September 1942, Miller’s band performed three times a week during a quarter-hour broadcast on CBS. For the first 13 weeks were with the Andrews Sisters.\n\nOn 10 February 1942, RCA Victor presented Miller with the first ever gold record for “Chattanooga Choo Choo”.\n\nMiller Orchestra singers included Gordon “Tex” Beneke, Paula Kelly and the Modernaires, Marion Hutton, Skip Nelson, Ray Eberle and Gail Reese.\n\nIn 2004, Miller orchestra bassist Trigger Alpert explained the band’s success: “Miller had America’s music pulse… He knew what would please the listeners.”\n\nLouis Armstrong thought enough of Miller to carry around his recordings, transferred to seven-inch tape reels when he went on tour. “[Armstrong] liked musicians who prized melody, and his selections ranged from Glenn Miller to Jelly Roll Morton to Tchaikovsky.”\n\nJazz pianist George Shearing’s quintet of the 1950s and 1960s was influenced by Miller: “with Shearing’s locked hands style piano (influenced by the voicing of Miller’s saxophone section) in the middle [of the quintet’s harmonies]”.\n\nMel Tormé credited Miller with giving him helpful advice when he first started his singing and songwriting career in the 1940s. Tormé met Miller in 1942, the meeting facilitated by Tormé’s father and Ben Pollack.\n\nTormé and Miller discussed “That Old Black Magic”, which was just emerging as a new song by Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen. Miller told Tormé to pick up every song by Mercer and study it and to become a voracious reader of anything he could find, because “all good lyric writers are great readers.”\n\nIn 1948, Sinatra lamented the inferior quality of music he was recording in the late ’40s, in comparison with “those great Glenn Miller things” from eight years earlier.\n\nFrank Sinatra’s recording sessions from the late 1940s and early 1950s used some Miller musicians:Trigger Alpert, a bassist from the civilian band, Zeke Zarchy for the Army Air Forces Orchestra and Willie Schwartz, the lead clarinetist from the civilian band.\n\nClarinettist Buddy DeFranco, who lead one of the official postwar Glenn Miller Orchestras said, “I found that when I opened with ‘Moonlight Serenade’, I could see men and women weeping as the music carried them back to years gone by … the beauty of Glenn Miller’s ballads … caused people to dance together.”\n\nRAY ANTHONY\n\nThere is now one surviving original Glenn Miller Orchestra member, trumpeter, Ray Anthony, who is, as of 2024, 102 years old.\n\nHe played in Glenn Miller’s band from 1940 to 1941.\n\nThe Ray Anthony Orchestra was popular in the early 1950s with “The Bunny Hop”, “Hokey Pokey”, and the theme from the radio/television police detective series Dragnet.\n\nFILLUMS\n\nMiller and his band appeared in two Twentieth Century Fox films.\n\nIn Sun Valley Serenade (1941) they were major members of the cast, which also featured comedian Milton Berle, and Dorothy Dandridge with the Nicholas Brothers in the show-stopping song-and-dance number, “Chattanooga Choo Choo”.\n\nThe Miller band returned to Hollywood to film Orchestra Wives (1942), featuring Jackie Gleason playing a part as the group’s bassist. Though contracted to do a third movie for Fox, Blind Date, Miller entered the US Army and this film was never made.\n\nARMY 1942-46\n\nAt the peak of his career in 1942, Glenn Miller decided to join the armed forces, which meant forsaking an income of about $20,000 per week, equivalent to $350,000 ($A600,000) per week in 2024.\n\nHe first applied for a commission in the US Navy and was turned down. At the time, the Navy was dealing with a scandal concerning celebrity commissions in exchange for draft avoidance. This had nothing to do with Miller, but prevented the Navy from acting on his application.\n\nMiller then applied to the US Army with whom he had privately explored the possibility of enlisting. During a March 1942 visit to Washington, Miller had met with officials of the Army Bureau of Public Relations and Army Air Forces.\n\nOn 12 August 1942, Miller posted a three-page letter to General Charles Young of the Army Service Forces, outlining his interest in “streamlining modern military music” and to express his “sincere desire to do a real job for the Army that is not actuated by any personal draft problem.”\n\nGeneral Young forwarded Miller’s letter to Gen. Brehon Somervell, commander of Army Service Forces who approved Miller’s application. The Army notified Miller of his commission on 8 September 1942. He received a one-month delay to settle his business affairs.\n\nMiller made his final commercial broadcast for on 24 September 1942. At the end of the program, he introduced competitor Harry James as his successor on the radio series, a gesture that a grateful Harry James never forgot.\n\nOn 26 September, Miller made his final civilian broadcast on the Blue Network Coca Cola Victory parade of Spotlight Bands.\n\nGlenn Miller and his Orchestra gave their final performance at Central Theater in Passaic, New Jersey on 27 September 1942.\n\nOn 7 October 1942, Miller reported to the Seventh Service Command at Omaha as a captain in the Army Specialist Corps. Following a one-month ASC training course at Fort Meade, Maryland, he transferred to the Army Air Forces (AAF) on 25 November 1942, by order of General Henry Harley “Hap” Arnold.\n\nMiller was initially assigned to the AAF Southeast Flying Training Command at Maxwell Field, Alabama for orientation as assistant special service officer, traveling to different AAF training bases in the region to learn the mission of the training command. There, he appeared on the nationwide NBC “Army Hour” broadcast, originated from WSFA, Montgomery. He also appeared over WAPI radio Birmingham, performing with the Rhythmaires, a 15-piece base band.\n\nEffective 1 January 1943, Miller was assigned to the headquarters of the AAF Technical Training Command (TTC) at Knollwood Field, Southern Pines, North Carolina. Reporting to Gen. Walter R. Weaver, Miller became director of bands for the AAFTTC.\n\nMiller’s recommendation for an AAFTTC bands program was approved. Detached to the AAF Training Center at Atlantic City, New Jersey, Miller screened personnel for assignment to various AAF base bands across the nation and recruited many for an elite unit that he would direct himself.\n\nThe AAF had established its First Radio Production Unit and Orchestra to broadcast from Hollywood, commanded by Maj. Eddie Dunstedter with musical director M/Sgt. Felix Slatkin.\n\nMiller would form and direct the Second AAF Radio Production Unit and Orchestra, broadcasting and recording from New York.\n\nMiller’s unit was authorised on 20 March 1943, and billeted at the AAF Training School at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nIts personnel were a talented mix of jazz musicians from major big bands and musicians from leading symphony orchestras. Miller would successfully attempt to fuse jazz, popular music and light classics, including strings, which was an evolutionary step beyond his civilian band.\n\nI SUSTAIN THE WINGS\n\nBroadcasting and recording from New York, the Miller unit broadcast “I Sustain the Wings”. This weekly series was first carried by CBS starting on 5 June 1943, and then by NBC from 18 September 1943 until 10 June 1944.\n\nAfter Miller died in December 1944, the Miller unit resumed the “I Sustain The Wings” series when they returned from the European Theatre in August 1945.\n\nThe Miller unit also recorded V-Discs at RCA Victor studios, and recorded broadcasts for the Office of War Information and Armed Forces Radio Service, including “Music from America” and “Uncle Sam Presents.”\n\nIn addition to the full concert orchestra, Miller’s AAF Training Command organisation included a marching band for base activities and a jazz band led by T/Sgt. Ray McKinley, the popular civilian bandleader and drummer.\n\nMiller famously got into a musical argument with Army purists by performing marching arrangements of jazz, including “The Saint Louis Blues” and “Blues in the Night”, as opposed to traditional Sousa military marches.\n\nOn 24 May 1944, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower sent a cable to Washington requesting transfer of the Miller AAF unit for the purposes of radio broadcasting and morale. With the impending D-Day invasion of northwest Europe, the Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) was establishing a combined allied radio broadcasting service. Eisenhower cited the Miller organisation as the “only organisation capable of performing the mission required.”\n\nThe Army Air Forces approved the deployment under the condition that the unit remain under AAF control. Miller and radio producer Sgt. Paul Dudley flew to London on June 19 and the band followed aboard the RMS Queen Elizabeth, which was serving as a troopship.\n\nUpon arrival in London, the unit was initially billeted at Sloane Court, Chelsea. This was a temporary assignment because Miller had previously arranged for permanent quarters in Bedford. Because of the V-1 flying bomb assault that was underway, SHAEF determined it better to house the band where the BBC had moved operations during the Blitz of 1940–41.\n\nIn Bedford, the Miller unit would use facilities developed for Sir Adrian Boult and the BBC Symphony. Prior to the band’s arrival, Miller met with SHAEF and BBC officials to coordinate broadcasting plans, including the BBC Director of the new Allied Expeditionary Forces Programme (AEFP), Maurice Gorham, SHAEF Director of Broadcasting, American Col. Edward Kirby, and deputy director of SHAEF Broadcasting, British Lt. Col. David Niven. They became Miller’s chain of command.\n\nHis distinguished orchestra was attached to SHAEF in London, and was quartered at Milton Ernest near Bedford, England. When the band arrived in London, they were quartered in an office at 25 Sloane Court.\n\nUnfortunately, this was in the middle of “Buzz Bomb Alley”, an area of sleepless nights because of the constant barrage of German flying V-1 bombs. Miller arranged for new quarters and transportation to move to Bedford on Sunday, 2 July 1944.\n\nThe next morning, a buzz bomb landed in front of their old quarters, destroyed the building, and killed more than 100 people. None were Miller band members.\n\nOn 9 July 1944, Miller’s 51-piece orchestra and production personnel started broadcasting a series of musical programs over the AEFP under BBC technical supervision. The programs included: “The American Band of the AEF” (full orchestra), “Swing Shift” (T/Sgt. Ray McKinley dance orchestra), “Uptown Hall” (Sgt. Mel Powell jazz quartet), “Strings with Wings” (Sgt. George Ockner, concertmaster and the string section), “Songs by Sgt. Johnny Desmond” (vocalist with orchestra directed by M/Sgt. Norman Leyden) and “Piano Parade” (piano solos by Pvt. Jack Rusin and Sgt. Mel Powell).\n\nThe orchestra also appeared for the Office of War Information’s Voice of America European outlet. The American Broadcasting Station in Europe (ABSIE) broadcast daily to occupied Europe and Germany. One of its German language programs was “Music for the Wehrmacht”, in which Miller made announcements in phonetic German scripts with a German-speaking announcer named “Ilse”.\n\nIlse was Carol Wagner, a German-speaking American relative of composer Richard Wagner. The Allied broadcast services used the name “Ilse Weinberger” for all woman announcers as a nom de guerre in order to protect any relatives who might be behind German lines\n\nSgt. Johnny Desmond sang vocals in German on this series recorded at the famous Abbey Road studios in London.\n\nIn England, the band kept an extensive schedule of personal appearances at primarily American air bases. Visiting American celebrities Bing Crosby and Dinah Shore appeared on their radio programs. Shore joined Miller for a recording session at Abbey Road Studios, where the orchestra recorded their ABSIE German language programs.\n\nDuring November 1944, Miller and David Niven sought and received approval to move the unit from England to France. By this time, SHAEF had relocated to Versailles. It was determined that reliable radio broadcasting could be accomplished from Paris and that the Miller orchestra could be seen in person at Paris-area hospitals and by ground troops on leave from the front lines. The move was set for mid-December. As a precaution, the Miller organisation had to prerecord eighty hours of broadcasts prior to moving, in addition to their normal schedule.\n\nMeanwhile, preparations in France were behind schedule. On 11 December 1944, Niven ordered Miller to replace his executive officer, Lt. Donald Haynes, to fly ahead and complete arrangements before the entire group came across.\n\nThe AAF band completed their pre-recordings and regular broadcasts on Tuesday, 12 December 1944, and prepared for the anticipated move to France. As per Niven’s order, Miller was booked on a scheduled Air Transport Command passenger flight from London-Bovingdon to Paris-Orly on Thursday, 14 December.\n\nMiller was on standby for an earlier flight on 13 December, but it was canceled due to bad weather in France. His reservation on 14 December was also canceled. Miller was frustrated and impatient, fearing that arrangements would not be made in time to accommodate the movement of his unit to France.\n\nOn a telephone call to Haynes, he learned that a mutual acquaintance, Lieutenant Colonel Norman Baessell of the Eighth Air Force Service Command at Milton Ernest, was flying to France on December 15. It was to be aboard a Noorduyn UC-64A Norseman assigned to him and piloted by Flight Officer John Stuart Morgan. Baessell invited Miller to join them.\n\nMiller’s travel orders did not authorise him to board a “casual” flight and he did not report his intentions to his chain of command, so SHAEF was in the dark concerning Miller’s whereabouts.\n\nAlthough AAF and RAF combat missions flew that day, as well as numerous transport planes, the RAF Training Unit at RAF Twinwood Farm had stood down, but the aerodrome was open. At 13:45 Morgan landed at Twinwood, boarded Baessell and Miller, and took off at 13:55. The UC-64 and its occupants were never seen again. The next morning, the Battle of the Bulge began. The Eighth Air Force and SHAEF did not realise that the UC-64 with Miller aboard was missing until three days later, on Monday, 18 December 1944.\n\nUpon realising the airplane and Miller were missing, Major General Orvil Anderson, Deputy Commander for Operations of the Eighth Air Force, who was married to Miller’s cousin Maude Miller Anderson, ordered a search and investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, Miller’s unit had flown safely from England to France aboard three C-47 transports and prepared to begin their broadcasting and concert duties. Since they were scheduled for a Christmas Day broadcast from Paris to England and via shortwave to the United States, news of Miller’s whereabouts would have to be released.\n\nAAF Headquarters in Washington, D.C. notified Miller’s wife, Helen, of his disappearance on 23 December 1944, with an in-person visit to their home by two senior officers and a telephone call from Gen. H. H. Arnold. On 24 December 1944, at 18:00 BST, SHAEF announced Miller’s disappearance to the press, stressing that no members of his unit were with him aboard the missing airplane.\n\nThe Major Glenn Miller Army Air Forces Orchestra appeared as scheduled on 25 December 1944, conducted by Jerry Gray. The unit continued to broadcast and appear throughout Europe through V-E Day and until August 1945. It received a Unit Citation from Gen. Eisenhower. Returning home, the unit resumed its “I Sustain the Wings” series over NBC.\n\nOn 13 November 1945, the AAF Band appeared at the National Press Club for its final concert, which was attended by President Harry Truman and Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King. When the band appeared to the strains of Miller’s theme “Moonlight Serenade”, the president stood and led the audience in a spontaneous round of applause. The band was congratulated for a job “well done” in person by General Eisenhower and General Arnold.\n\nTheir last performance was the I Sustain the Wings broadcast at Bolling Field, Washington, D.C., on NBC radio on 17 November 1945. Its personnel were gradually discharged, and the unit was disestablished in January 1946. Miller and his music became an institution as Miller wished.\n\nTODAY\n\nHis music is still played worldwide by professional and amateur musicians every day.\n\nThe Miller estate authorised an official Glenn Miller legacy band in 1946, the Glenn Miller Orchestra.\n\nThis band was led by Tex Beneke, former tenor saxophonist and a singer for the civilian band.\n\nIt had a makeup similar to the Army Air Forces Band. It included a large string section, and at least initially, about two-thirds of the musicians were alumni of either the civilian or AAF orchestras.\n\nThe orchestra’s official public début was at the Capitol Theatre on Broadway for a three-week engagement starting 24 January 1946.\n\nFuture television and film composer Henry Mancini was the band’s pianist and one of the arrangers.\n\nThis band played to very large audiences all across the United States, including a few dates at the Hollywood Palladium in 1947 to a record-breaking crowd of 6,750 dancers.”\n\nBy 1949, economics dictated that the string section be dropped.\n\nThis band recorded for RCA Victor, just as the original Miller band did. Beneke was struggling with how to expand the Miller sound and also how to achieve success under his own name.\n\nWhat began as the “Glenn Miller Orchestra Under the Direction of Tex Beneke” finally became “The Tex Beneke Orchestra”.\n\nBy 1950, Beneke and the Miller estate parted ways. The break was acrimonious, although Beneke is now listed by the Miller estate as a former leader of the Glenn Miller Orchestra.\n\nThe success of the biopic, “The Glenn Miller Story” (1954), inspired Glenn’s wife, Helen Miller, to invite Ray McKinley, who had assumed leadership of the Miller band in 1945, to form a new band called the Glenn Miller Orchestra. McKinley recruited Will Bradley as featured trombonist, and they remained with the Miller band until 1966.\n\nAround the world, the Glenn Miller Orchestra continues to tour today.\n\nIn the United States, the leader since 2021 has been saxophonist Erik Stabnau. In the United Kingdom, the director is Ray McVay.\n\nIn Europe, the leader has been Wil Salden since 1990.\n\nIn Scandinavia, the director has been Jan Slottenäs since 2010.\n\nThe late and much loved drummer, Bob Gillespie, with the Greg Poppleton 1920s – 30s band, was drummer with the Miller band touring Australia and New Zealand in the 1990s\n\nBob Gillespie on drums with the Greg Poppleton band

Weekend Mornings with Simon Marnie. It’s a 55 minute journey through musical genres, styles, and personalities each week with Simon and a special guest.\n\nThis Saturday, it’s me travelling with Simon through Glenn Miller’s musical journey.\n\nGlenn Miller, born Alton Glen Miller, was an American trombonist, composer, arranger and band leader. His swing orchestra was the best selling recording band 1939 – 1942 and the continues playing today. His Army-Air Forces band modernised US military music.\n\nWeekend mornings is all about great food ideas, renovating tips and the best local stories from around Sydney and the state.

He had played cornet and mandolin before switching to trombone.\n\nHe played in his high school orchestra and formed his own dance band in his final high school year. At school, he took classes in harmony, piano, violin, and music appreciation. By the time he graduated he was a professional musician. He missed his own graduation because he was performing out of town. His mother gladly received his diploma for him.\n\nIn 1924 he went to New York City and studied the Schillinger system with Joseph Schillinger, under whose tutelage he composed “Miller’s Tune”. It became his signature theme, “Moonlight Serenade”.\n\nIn 1926, Miller toured with Ben Pollack’s Orchestra as lead trombone and played for Victor Young. This allowed him to be mentored by professional musicians. When Jack Teagarden took over the lead chair in Pollack’s band in 1928, Miller found that his solos were cut drastically. He realised his future was in arranging and composing.\n\nDuring his time with Pollack, he had written several arrangements. He wrote his first composition, “Room 1411”, with Benny Goodman. Brunswick Records released it under the name, “Benny Goodman’s Boys”.\n\nHe had a songbook published in Chicago in 1928 entitled ‘125 Jazz Breaks for Trombone.’\n\nBack in New York City in 1930 he joined Red Nichols and his Five Pennies, playing in the pit bands of Broadway shows, ‘Strike Up the Band’ and ‘Girl Crazy’. That band included Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa. They are all on this 1930 record of Corrine Corrina – vocals by Wingy Manone…\n\n1930s\n\nDuring the late 1920s and early 1930s, Glenn Miller worked as a freelance trombonist in several bands.\n\nOn the 21 March 1928, Victor Records session, he played alongside Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, and Joe Venuti in the All-Star Orchestra directed by Nat Shilkret.\n\nHe arranged and played trombone on several Dorsey Brothers sessions for OKeh Records, including “The Spell of the Blues”, “Let’s Do It” and “My Kinda Love”, all with Bing Crosby on vocals.\n\nOn 14 November 1929, vocalist Red McKenzie hired Miller to play on two records: “Hello, Lola” and “If I Could Be With You One Hour Tonight”. With Miller were saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, clarinetist Pee Wee Russell, guitarist Eddie Condon, and drummer Gene Krupa.\n\nIn the early to mid-1930s, Miller worked as a trombonist, arranger, and composer for the Dorsey Brothers, first, when they were a Brunswick studio group and later, when they formed an ill-fated orchestra.\n\nMiller composed the songs “Annie’s Cousin Fanny”, “Dese Dem Dose”, “Harlem Chapel Chimes”, and “Tomorrow’s Another Day” for the Dorsey Brothers Band in 1934 and 1935.\n\n“Annie’s Cousin Fannie” was recorded on 4 June 1934 in New York and released as Brunswick 6938. The flip side was “Judy”. The song was also released in a second version on a Decca 78 as Decca 117A backed with “Dr. Heckle and Mr. Jive”. A third version was also recorded but not released. Glenn Miller wrote “Annie’s Cousin Fannie”, played trombone on the record, and sang some of the verses. Miller sings the closing verse. The record was banned by some radio stations because of the double entendre lyrics…\n\nRAY NOBLE\n\nIn 1935, he assembled an American orchestra for British bandleader Ray Noble, developing the arrangement of lead clarinet over four saxophones that became a characteristic of his big band. Members of the Noble band included Claude Thornhill, Bud Freeman, and Charlie Spivak.\n\nMiller made his first movie appearance in The Big Broadcast of 1936 as a member of the Ray Noble Orchestra performing “Why Stars Come Out at Night”. The film included performances by Dorothy Dandridge and the Nicholas Brothers, who would appear with Miller again in two movies in 1941 and 1942.\n\nIn 1937, Glenn Miller compiled several arrangements and formed his first band. After failing to distinguish itself from the many bands of the time, it broke up after its last show at the Ritz Ballroom in Bridgeport, Connecticut on 2 January 1938.\n\nBenny Goodman said in 1976: “In late 1937, before his band became popular, we were both playing in Dallas. Glenn was pretty dejected and came to see me. He asked, “What do you do? How do you make it?” I said, “I don’t know, Glenn. You just stay with it.”\n\nSUCCESS\n\nDiscouraged, Miller returned to New York. He realised that he needed to develop a unique sound and decided to make the clarinet play a melodic line with a tenor saxophone holding the same note, while three other saxophones harmonised within a single octave.\n\nGeorge T. Simon discovered 18 year old saxophonist Wilbur Schwartz. Miller hired Schwartz but had him play lead clarinet instead of the saxophone. According to Simon, “Willie’s tone and way of playing provided a fullness and richness so distinctive that none of the later Miller imitators could ever accurately reproduce the Miller sound.”\n\nMiller talked about his style in the May 1939 issue of Metronome magazine. “You’ll notice today some bands use the same trick on every introduction; others repeat the same musical phrase as a modulation into a vocal … We’re fortunate in that our style doesn’t limit us to stereotyped intros, modulations, first choruses, endings, or even trick rhythms. The fifth sax, playing the clarinet most of the time, lets you know whose band you’re listening to. And that’s about all there is to it.”\n\nHere’s Glenn Miller’s Orchestra before the famous sound…\n\nTHE PEAK\n\nIn September 1938, the Miller band began recording for Bluebird, a subsidiary of RCA Victor.\n\nIn the spring of 1939, the band’s fortunes improved with a date at the Meadowbrook Ballroom in Cedar Grove, New Jersey, and then at the Glen Island Casino in New Rochelle, New York. The Glen Island performance attracted a record-breaking opening-night crowd of 1,800.\n\nIn 1939, Time magazine noted: “Of the 12 to 24 discs in each of today’s 300,000 U.S. jukeboxes, from two to six are usually Glenn Miller’s.”\n\nHis band played at Carnegie Hall, 6 October 1939.\n\nIn 1940, the band’s version of “Tuxedo Junction” sold 115,000 copies in the first week.\n\nFrom December 1939 to September 1942, Miller’s band performed three times a week during a quarter-hour broadcast on CBS. For the first 13 weeks were with the Andrews Sisters.\n\nOn 10 February 1942, RCA Victor presented Miller with the first ever gold record for “Chattanooga Choo Choo”.\n\nMiller Orchestra singers included Gordon “Tex” Beneke, Paula Kelly and the Modernaires, Marion Hutton, Skip Nelson, Ray Eberle and Gail Reese.\n\nIn 2004, Miller orchestra bassist Trigger Alpert explained the band’s success: “Miller had America’s music pulse… He knew what would please the listeners.”\n\nLouis Armstrong thought enough of Miller to carry around his recordings, transferred to seven-inch tape reels when he went on tour. “[Armstrong] liked musicians who prized melody, and his selections ranged from Glenn Miller to Jelly Roll Morton to Tchaikovsky.”\n\nJazz pianist George Shearing’s quintet of the 1950s and 1960s was influenced by Miller: “with Shearing’s locked hands style piano (influenced by the voicing of Miller’s saxophone section) in the middle [of the quintet’s harmonies]”.\n\nMel Tormé credited Miller with giving him helpful advice when he first started his singing and songwriting career in the 1940s. Tormé met Miller in 1942, the meeting facilitated by Tormé’s father and Ben Pollack.\n\nTormé and Miller discussed “That Old Black Magic”, which was just emerging as a new song by Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen. Miller told Tormé to pick up every song by Mercer and study it and to become a voracious reader of anything he could find, because “all good lyric writers are great readers.”\n\nIn 1948, Sinatra lamented the inferior quality of music he was recording in the late ’40s, in comparison with “those great Glenn Miller things” from eight years earlier.\n\nFrank Sinatra’s recording sessions from the late 1940s and early 1950s used some Miller musicians:Trigger Alpert, a bassist from the civilian band, Zeke Zarchy for the Army Air Forces Orchestra and Willie Schwartz, the lead clarinetist from the civilian band.\n\nClarinettist Buddy DeFranco, who lead one of the official postwar Glenn Miller Orchestras said, “I found that when I opened with ‘Moonlight Serenade’, I could see men and women weeping as the music carried them back to years gone by … the beauty of Glenn Miller’s ballads … caused people to dance together.”\n\nRAY ANTHONY\n\nThere is now one surviving original Glenn Miller Orchestra member, trumpeter, Ray Anthony, who is, as of 2024, 102 years old.\n\nHe played in Glenn Miller’s band from 1940 to 1941.\n\nThe Ray Anthony Orchestra was popular in the early 1950s with “The Bunny Hop”, “Hokey Pokey”, and the theme from the radio/television police detective series Dragnet.\n\nFILLUMS\n\nMiller and his band appeared in two Twentieth Century Fox films.\n\nIn Sun Valley Serenade (1941) they were major members of the cast, which also featured comedian Milton Berle, and Dorothy Dandridge with the Nicholas Brothers in the show-stopping song-and-dance number, “Chattanooga Choo Choo”.\n\nThe Miller band returned to Hollywood to film Orchestra Wives (1942), featuring Jackie Gleason playing a part as the group’s bassist. Though contracted to do a third movie for Fox, Blind Date, Miller entered the US Army and this film was never made.\n\nARMY 1942-46\n\nAt the peak of his career in 1942, Glenn Miller decided to join the armed forces, which meant forsaking an income of about $20,000 per week, equivalent to $350,000 ($A600,000) per week in 2024.\n\nHe first applied for a commission in the US Navy and was turned down. At the time, the Navy was dealing with a scandal concerning celebrity commissions in exchange for draft avoidance. This had nothing to do with Miller, but prevented the Navy from acting on his application.\n\nMiller then applied to the US Army with whom he had privately explored the possibility of enlisting. During a March 1942 visit to Washington, Miller had met with officials of the Army Bureau of Public Relations and Army Air Forces.\n\nOn 12 August 1942, Miller posted a three-page letter to General Charles Young of the Army Service Forces, outlining his interest in “streamlining modern military music” and to express his “sincere desire to do a real job for the Army that is not actuated by any personal draft problem.”\n\nGeneral Young forwarded Miller’s letter to Gen. Brehon Somervell, commander of Army Service Forces who approved Miller’s application. The Army notified Miller of his commission on 8 September 1942. He received a one-month delay to settle his business affairs.\n\nMiller made his final commercial broadcast for on 24 September 1942. At the end of the program, he introduced competitor Harry James as his successor on the radio series, a gesture that a grateful Harry James never forgot.\n\nOn 26 September, Miller made his final civilian broadcast on the Blue Network Coca Cola Victory parade of Spotlight Bands.\n\nGlenn Miller and his Orchestra gave their final performance at Central Theater in Passaic, New Jersey on 27 September 1942.\n\nOn 7 October 1942, Miller reported to the Seventh Service Command at Omaha as a captain in the Army Specialist Corps. Following a one-month ASC training course at Fort Meade, Maryland, he transferred to the Army Air Forces (AAF) on 25 November 1942, by order of General Henry Harley “Hap” Arnold.\n\nMiller was initially assigned to the AAF Southeast Flying Training Command at Maxwell Field, Alabama for orientation as assistant special service officer, traveling to different AAF training bases in the region to learn the mission of the training command. There, he appeared on the nationwide NBC “Army Hour” broadcast, originated from WSFA, Montgomery. He also appeared over WAPI radio Birmingham, performing with the Rhythmaires, a 15-piece base band.\n\nEffective 1 January 1943, Miller was assigned to the headquarters of the AAF Technical Training Command (TTC) at Knollwood Field, Southern Pines, North Carolina. Reporting to Gen. Walter R. Weaver, Miller became director of bands for the AAFTTC.\n\nMiller’s recommendation for an AAFTTC bands program was approved. Detached to the AAF Training Center at Atlantic City, New Jersey, Miller screened personnel for assignment to various AAF base bands across the nation and recruited many for an elite unit that he would direct himself.\n\nThe AAF had established its First Radio Production Unit and Orchestra to broadcast from Hollywood, commanded by Maj. Eddie Dunstedter with musical director M/Sgt. Felix Slatkin.\n\nMiller would form and direct the Second AAF Radio Production Unit and Orchestra, broadcasting and recording from New York.\n\nMiller’s unit was authorised on 20 March 1943, and billeted at the AAF Training School at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nIts personnel were a talented mix of jazz musicians from major big bands and musicians from leading symphony orchestras. Miller would successfully attempt to fuse jazz, popular music and light classics, including strings, which was an evolutionary step beyond his civilian band.\n\nI SUSTAIN THE WINGS\n\nBroadcasting and recording from New York, the Miller unit broadcast “I Sustain the Wings”. This weekly series was first carried by CBS starting on 5 June 1943, and then by NBC from 18 September 1943 until 10 June 1944.\n\nAfter Miller died in December 1944, the Miller unit resumed the “I Sustain The Wings” series when they returned from the European Theatre in August 1945.\n\nThe Miller unit also recorded V-Discs at RCA Victor studios, and recorded broadcasts for the Office of War Information and Armed Forces Radio Service, including “Music from America” and “Uncle Sam Presents.”\n\nIn addition to the full concert orchestra, Miller’s AAF Training Command organisation included a marching band for base activities and a jazz band led by T/Sgt. Ray McKinley, the popular civilian bandleader and drummer.\n\nMiller famously got into a musical argument with Army purists by performing marching arrangements of jazz, including “The Saint Louis Blues” and “Blues in the Night”, as opposed to traditional Sousa military marches.\n\nOn 24 May 1944, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower sent a cable to Washington requesting transfer of the Miller AAF unit for the purposes of radio broadcasting and morale. With the impending D-Day invasion of northwest Europe, the Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) was establishing a combined allied radio broadcasting service. Eisenhower cited the Miller organisation as the “only organisation capable of performing the mission required.”\n\nThe Army Air Forces approved the deployment under the condition that the unit remain under AAF control. Miller and radio producer Sgt. Paul Dudley flew to London on June 19 and the band followed aboard the RMS Queen Elizabeth, which was serving as a troopship.\n\nUpon arrival in London, the unit was initially billeted at Sloane Court, Chelsea. This was a temporary assignment because Miller had previously arranged for permanent quarters in Bedford. Because of the V-1 flying bomb assault that was underway, SHAEF determined it better to house the band where the BBC had moved operations during the Blitz of 1940–41.\n\nIn Bedford, the Miller unit would use facilities developed for Sir Adrian Boult and the BBC Symphony. Prior to the band’s arrival, Miller met with SHAEF and BBC officials to coordinate broadcasting plans, including the BBC Director of the new Allied Expeditionary Forces Programme (AEFP), Maurice Gorham, SHAEF Director of Broadcasting, American Col. Edward Kirby, and deputy director of SHAEF Broadcasting, British Lt. Col. David Niven. They became Miller’s chain of command.\n\nHis distinguished orchestra was attached to SHAEF in London, and was quartered at Milton Ernest near Bedford, England. When the band arrived in London, they were quartered in an office at 25 Sloane Court.\n\nUnfortunately, this was in the middle of “Buzz Bomb Alley”, an area of sleepless nights because of the constant barrage of German flying V-1 bombs. Miller arranged for new quarters and transportation to move to Bedford on Sunday, 2 July 1944.\n\nThe next morning, a buzz bomb landed in front of their old quarters, destroyed the building, and killed more than 100 people. None were Miller band members.\n\nOn 9 July 1944, Miller’s 51-piece orchestra and production personnel started broadcasting a series of musical programs over the AEFP under BBC technical supervision. The programs included: “The American Band of the AEF” (full orchestra), “Swing Shift” (T/Sgt. Ray McKinley dance orchestra), “Uptown Hall” (Sgt. Mel Powell jazz quartet), “Strings with Wings” (Sgt. George Ockner, concertmaster and the string section), “Songs by Sgt. Johnny Desmond” (vocalist with orchestra directed by M/Sgt. Norman Leyden) and “Piano Parade” (piano solos by Pvt. Jack Rusin and Sgt. Mel Powell).\n\nThe orchestra also appeared for the Office of War Information’s Voice of America European outlet. The American Broadcasting Station in Europe (ABSIE) broadcast daily to occupied Europe and Germany. One of its German language programs was “Music for the Wehrmacht”, in which Miller made announcements in phonetic German scripts with a German-speaking announcer named “Ilse”.\n\nIlse was Carol Wagner, a German-speaking American relative of composer Richard Wagner. The Allied broadcast services used the name “Ilse Weinberger” for all woman announcers as a nom de guerre in order to protect any relatives who might be behind German lines\n\nSgt. Johnny Desmond sang vocals in German on this series recorded at the famous Abbey Road studios in London.\n\nIn England, the band kept an extensive schedule of personal appearances at primarily American air bases. Visiting American celebrities Bing Crosby and Dinah Shore appeared on their radio programs. Shore joined Miller for a recording session at Abbey Road Studios, where the orchestra recorded their ABSIE German language programs.\n\nDuring November 1944, Miller and David Niven sought and received approval to move the unit from England to France. By this time, SHAEF had relocated to Versailles. It was determined that reliable radio broadcasting could be accomplished from Paris and that the Miller orchestra could be seen in person at Paris-area hospitals and by ground troops on leave from the front lines. The move was set for mid-December. As a precaution, the Miller organisation had to prerecord eighty hours of broadcasts prior to moving, in addition to their normal schedule.\n\nMeanwhile, preparations in France were behind schedule. On 11 December 1944, Niven ordered Miller to replace his executive officer, Lt. Donald Haynes, to fly ahead and complete arrangements before the entire group came across.\n\nThe AAF band completed their pre-recordings and regular broadcasts on Tuesday, 12 December 1944, and prepared for the anticipated move to France. As per Niven’s order, Miller was booked on a scheduled Air Transport Command passenger flight from London-Bovingdon to Paris-Orly on Thursday, 14 December.\n\nMiller was on standby for an earlier flight on 13 December, but it was canceled due to bad weather in France. His reservation on 14 December was also canceled. Miller was frustrated and impatient, fearing that arrangements would not be made in time to accommodate the movement of his unit to France.\n\nOn a telephone call to Haynes, he learned that a mutual acquaintance, Lieutenant Colonel Norman Baessell of the Eighth Air Force Service Command at Milton Ernest, was flying to France on December 15. It was to be aboard a Noorduyn UC-64A Norseman assigned to him and piloted by Flight Officer John Stuart Morgan. Baessell invited Miller to join them.\n\nMiller’s travel orders did not authorise him to board a “casual” flight and he did not report his intentions to his chain of command, so SHAEF was in the dark concerning Miller’s whereabouts.\n\nAlthough AAF and RAF combat missions flew that day, as well as numerous transport planes, the RAF Training Unit at RAF Twinwood Farm had stood down, but the aerodrome was open. At 13:45 Morgan landed at Twinwood, boarded Baessell and Miller, and took off at 13:55. The UC-64 and its occupants were never seen again. The next morning, the Battle of the Bulge began. The Eighth Air Force and SHAEF did not realise that the UC-64 with Miller aboard was missing until three days later, on Monday, 18 December 1944.\n\nUpon realising the airplane and Miller were missing, Major General Orvil Anderson, Deputy Commander for Operations of the Eighth Air Force, who was married to Miller’s cousin Maude Miller Anderson, ordered a search and investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, Miller’s unit had flown safely from England to France aboard three C-47 transports and prepared to begin their broadcasting and concert duties. Since they were scheduled for a Christmas Day broadcast from Paris to England and via shortwave to the United States, news of Miller’s whereabouts would have to be released.\n\nAAF Headquarters in Washington, D.C. notified Miller’s wife, Helen, of his disappearance on 23 December 1944, with an in-person visit to their home by two senior officers and a telephone call from Gen. H. H. Arnold. On 24 December 1944, at 18:00 BST, SHAEF announced Miller’s disappearance to the press, stressing that no members of his unit were with him aboard the missing airplane.\n\nThe Major Glenn Miller Army Air Forces Orchestra appeared as scheduled on 25 December 1944, conducted by Jerry Gray. The unit continued to broadcast and appear throughout Europe through V-E Day and until August 1945. It received a Unit Citation from Gen. Eisenhower. Returning home, the unit resumed its “I Sustain the Wings” series over NBC.\n\nOn 13 November 1945, the AAF Band appeared at the National Press Club for its final concert, which was attended by President Harry Truman and Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King. When the band appeared to the strains of Miller’s theme “Moonlight Serenade”, the president stood and led the audience in a spontaneous round of applause. The band was congratulated for a job “well done” in person by General Eisenhower and General Arnold.\n\nTheir last performance was the I Sustain the Wings broadcast at Bolling Field, Washington, D.C., on NBC radio on 17 November 1945. Its personnel were gradually discharged, and the unit was disestablished in January 1946. Miller and his music became an institution as Miller wished.\n\nTODAY\n\nHis music is still played worldwide by professional and amateur musicians every day.\n\nThe Miller estate authorised an official Glenn Miller legacy band in 1946, the Glenn Miller Orchestra.\n\nThis band was led by Tex Beneke, former tenor saxophonist and a singer for the civilian band.\n\nIt had a makeup similar to the Army Air Forces Band. It included a large string section, and at least initially, about two-thirds of the musicians were alumni of either the civilian or AAF orchestras.\n\nThe orchestra’s official public début was at the Capitol Theatre on Broadway for a three-week engagement starting 24 January 1946.\n\nFuture television and film composer Henry Mancini was the band’s pianist and one of the arrangers.\n\nThis band played to very large audiences all across the United States, including a few dates at the Hollywood Palladium in 1947 to a record-breaking crowd of 6,750 dancers.”\n\nBy 1949, economics dictated that the string section be dropped.\n\nThis band recorded for RCA Victor, just as the original Miller band did. Beneke was struggling with how to expand the Miller sound and also how to achieve success under his own name.\n\nWhat began as the “Glenn Miller Orchestra Under the Direction of Tex Beneke” finally became “The Tex Beneke Orchestra”.\n\nBy 1950, Beneke and the Miller estate parted ways. The break was acrimonious, although Beneke is now listed by the Miller estate as a former leader of the Glenn Miller Orchestra.\n\nThe success of the biopic, “The Glenn Miller Story” (1954), inspired Glenn’s wife, Helen Miller, to invite Ray McKinley, who had assumed leadership of the Miller band in 1945, to form a new band called the Glenn Miller Orchestra. McKinley recruited Will Bradley as featured trombonist, and they remained with the Miller band until 1966.\n\nAround the world, the Glenn Miller Orchestra continues to tour today.\n\nIn the United States, the leader since 2021 has been saxophonist Erik Stabnau. In the United Kingdom, the director is Ray McVay.\n\nIn Europe, the leader has been Wil Salden since 1990.\n\nIn Scandinavia, the director has been Jan Slottenäs since 2010.\n\nThe late and much loved drummer, Bob Gillespie, with the Greg Poppleton 1920s – 30s band, was drummer with the Miller band touring Australia and New Zealand in the 1990s\n\nBob Gillespie on drums with the Greg Poppleton band in 2011\n\n20 July Sonic Journey PLAY LIST\n\nPlay List – The Phantom Dancer\n\n702AM ABC Radio Sydney (2BL)\n\nLISTEN ONLINE\n\nSaturday 20 July 2024\n\nAfter the news, 11:05am – 12:00pm (+10 hours GMT)\n\nSonic Journey\n\nGlenn Miller\n\nCorrine Corrina\n\nRed Nichols and his Five Pennies with Glenn Miller trombone\n\nComm Rec\n\n1930\n\nAnnie’s Cousin Fanny\n\nDorsey Brothers Orchestra (composed and arranged by Glenn Miller.

Her career spanned more than seventy years and covered film, television, and theatre. She recorded and performed into the 1990s, retiring from public view in 2000. She’s your Phantom Dancer featured artist this week.\n\nThe Phantom Dancer is your weekly non-stop mix of swing and jazz from live 1920s-60s radio and TV every week.\n\nLISTEN to this week’s Phantom Dancer mix (online after 2pm AEST, Tuesday 2 July) and weeks of Phantom Dancer mixes online at, at https://2ser.com/phantom-dancer/\n\nLENA\n\nLena Horne joined the chorus line of the Cotton Club in New York City in 1933. Next year she had a featured role in the Cotton Club Parade starring Adelaide Hall, who took Lena under her wing.\n\nHorne made her first screen appearance as a dancer in the musical short Cab Calloway’s Jitterbug Party (1935).\n\nA few years later, she toured with Noble Sissle’s Orchestra and made her first records.\n\nShe toured with bandleader Charlie Barnet in 1940–41, but disliked the travel and left the band to work at the Cafe Society in New York.\n\nShe replaced Dinah Shore as the featured vocalist on NBC’s popular jazz series The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street. The show’s resident maestros, Henry Levine and Paul Laval, recorded with Horne in June 1941.\n\nHorne left the show when she was hired to perform in a Cotton Club-style revue on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood.\n\nIn 1945 and 1946, she sang with Billy Eckstine’s Orchestra.\n\nMOVIES\n\nIn 1938 Horne was cast in the musical feature called The Duke is Tops,, later reissued with Horne’s name above the title as The Bronze Venus.\n\nIn 1941 she was in the short, Boogie Woogie Dream, featuring pianists Pete Johnson and Albert Ammons. Her songs in the short were later released individually as soundies.\n\nShe was signed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Her first film was Panama Hattie (1942).\n\nShe sang the title song of Stormy Weather (1943) based loosely on the life of Adelaide Hall, for 20th Century Fox, while on loan from MGM. She appeared in several MGM musicals, including Cabin in the Sky (1943).\n\nMost of Horne’s film appearances were stand-alone sequences that had no bearing on the rest of the film, so editing caused no disruption to the storyline. One number from Cabin in the Sky was cut before release because it was considered too suggestive by the censors: Horne singing “Ain’t It the Truth” while taking a bubble bath. This scene and song are featured in the film That’s Entertainment! III (1994), which also featured commentary from Horne on why the scene was deleted prior to the film’s release.\n\nHorne was the first African-American person elected to serve on the Screen Actors Guild board of directors.\n\nIn Ziegfeld Follies (1946), she performed “Love” by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane. Horne lobbied for the role of Julie LaVerne in MGM’s version of Show Boat (1951), having already played the role when a segment of Show Boat was performed in Till the Clouds Roll By, but lost the part to Ava Gardner, a friend in real life. In the documentary That’s Entertainment! III, Horne stated that MGM executives required Gardner to practice her singing using Horne’s recordings, which offended both actresses. Ultimately, Gardner’s voice was overdubbed by actress Annette Warren (Smith) for the theatrical release.\n\nHorne became disenchanted with Hollywood and increasingly focused on her nightclub career. She made only two major appearances for MGM during the 1950s: Duchess of Idaho (1950), which was also Eleanor Powell’s final film); and the musical Meet Me in Las Vegas (1956).\n\nShe returned to the screen, playing Claire Quintana, a madam in a brothel who marries Richard Widmark, in the film Death of a Gunfighter (1969), her first straight dramatic role with no reference to her colour.\n\nShe was Glinda in The Wiz (1978), which was directed by her then son-in-law Sidney Lumet, and co-hosting the MGM retrospective That’s Entertainment! III (1994), in which she related her unkind treatment by the studio.\n\nPOST-HOLLYWOOD\n\nHorne established herself as one of the premier nightclub performers of the post-war era. She headlined at clubs and hotels throughout the U.S., Canada, and Europe.\n\nHer 1957 live album, Lena Horne at the Waldorf-Astoria, became the biggest-selling record by a female artist in the history of the RCA Victor label at that time.\n\nIn 1958, Horne became the first African-American woman to be nominated for a Tony Award for “Best Actress in a Musical”, for her part in the “Calypso” musical Jamaica (which, at Horne’s request featured her longtime friend Adelaide Hall).\n\nFrom the late 1950s through to the 1960s, Horne was a staple of TV variety shows.\n\nIn 1970, she co-starred with Harry Belafonte in the hour-long Harry & Lena special and in 1973, she co-starred with Tony Bennett in Tony and Lena. Horne and Bennett subsequently toured the U.S. and U.K. in a show together. From 1976 – 80 she appeared in many TV variety shows.\n\nOn April 13, 1980, Horne, Luciano Pavarotti, and host Gene Kelly were all scheduled to appear at a Gala performance at the Metropolitan Opera House to salute the NY City Center’s Joffrey Ballet Company. However, Pavarotti’s plane was diverted over the Atlantic and he was unable to appear.\n\nJames Nederlander was an invited Honored Guest and observed that only three people at the sold-out Metropolitan Opera House asked for their money back. He asked to be introduced to Horne following her performance. In May 1981, The Nederlander Organization, Michael Frazier, and Fred Walker went on to book Horne for a four-week engagement at the newly named Nederlander Theatre on West 41st Street in New York City. The show was an instant success and was extended to a full year run, garnering Horne a special Tony award, and two Grammy Awards for the cast recording of her show Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music. The 333-performance Broadway run closed on Horne’s 65th birthday, June 30, 1982.\n\nLater that same week, she performed the entire show again to record it for television broadcast and home video release. Horne began a tour a few days later at Tanglewood (Massachusetts) during the weekend of July 4, 1982. The Lady and Her Music toured 41 cities in the U.S. and Canada until June 17, 1984. It played in London for a month in August and ended its run in Stockholm, Sweden, September 14, 1984. In 1981, she received a Special Tony Award for the show, which also played to acclaim at the Adelphi Theatre in London in 1984.\n\nHorne holds the record for the longest-running solo performance in Broadway history.\n\nA proposed 1983 joint recording project between Horne and Frank Sinatra (to be produced by Quincy Jones) was ultimately abandoned, and her sole studio recording of the decade was 1988’s The Men in My Life, featuring duets with Sammy Davis Jr. and Joe Williams. In 1989, she received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nIn 1995, a “live” album capturing Horne’s Supper Club performance was released (subsequently winning a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album). In 1998, Horne released another studio album, entitled Being Myself. Thereafter, Horne retired from performing and largely retreated from public view, though she did return to the recording studio in 2000 to contribute vocal tracks on Simon Rattle’s Classic Ellington album.\n\n2 July PLAY LIST\n\nPlay List – The Phantom Dancer\n\n107.3 2SER-FM Sydney\n\nLISTEN ONLINE\n\nCommunity Radio Network Show CRN #661\n\n107.3 2SER Tuesday 2 July 2024\n\n12:04 – 2:00pm (+10 hours GMT)\n\nNational Program\n\n5UV Adelaide Monday 2:30 – 3:30am\n\n5GTR Mt Gambier Monday 2:30 – 3:30am\n\n3MBR Murrayville Monday 3 – 4am\n\n4NAG Keppel FM Monday 3 – 4am\n\n2MIA Griffith Monday 3 – 4am\n\n2BAR Edge FM Bega Monday 3 – 4am\n\n2BRW Braidwood Monday 3 – 4am\n\n2YYY Young Monday 3 – 4am\n\n7RPH Hobart Monday 3 – 4pm\n\n3VKV Alpine Radio Monday 6 – 7pm\n\n7MID Oatlands Monday 3am – 4 and 6 -7pm\n\n2MCE Bathurst Thursday 9 – 10am\n\n1ART ArtsoundFM Canberra Friday 10 – 11am\n\nand Sunday 11pm\n\nReading Radio (QLD) Friday 1am – 2\n\n2RRR Ryde Friday 11am – 12\n\n2ARM Armidale Friday 12 – 1pm\n\n5LCM Lofty FM Adelaide Friday 1 – 2pm\n\n6GME Radio Goolarri Broome Saturday 4am – 5am\n\nDenmark FM (West Australia) Saturday 10 – 11am\n\nRepeat: Wednesdays 10 – 11pm\n\n7LTN Launceston Sunday 5 – 6am\n\n3MGB Mallacoota Sunday 5 – 6am\n\n3BBR West Gippsland Sunday 5 – 6pm\n\n2SEA Sapphire Coast Eden Sunday 9 – 10pm\n\nSet 1\n\nStan Kenton\n\nSwinghouse + Opus in Pastels\n\nStan Kenton Orchestra\n\n‘Concert in Miniature’\n\nSweets Ballroom\n\nOakland\n\nKNBC NBC San Francisco\n\n17 Feb 1953\n\nMinor Riff + All the Things You Are\n\nStan Kenton Orchestra\n\n‘Concert in Miniature’\n\nSweets Ballroom\n\nOakland\n\nKNBC NBC San Francisco\n\n17 Feb 1953\n\nSomnambulism Stan Kenton Orchestra\n\n‘Concert in Miniature’\n\nSweets Ballroom\n\nOakland\n\nKNBC NBC San Francisco\n\n17 Feb 1953\n\nJump for Joe + Artistry in Rhythm (theme) Stan Kenton Orchestra ‘Concert in Miniature’\n\nSweets Ballroom\n\nOakland\n\nKNBC NBC San Francisco\n\n17 Feb 1953\n\nSet 2\n\nAnson Weeks\n\nOoh That Kiss\n\nAnson Weeks Orchestra (voc) Pete Fylling\n\nRadio Transcription\n\nPeacock Court\n\nHotel Mark Hopkins\n\nSan Francisco\n\n1932\n\nRavel’s Bolero\n\nAnson Weeks Orchestra\n\nRadio Transcription\n\nPeacock Court\n\nHotel Mark Hopkins\n\nSan Francisco\n\n1932\n\nMedey\n\nAnson Weeks Orchestra\n\nRadio Transcription\n\nPeacock Court\n\nHotel Mark Hopkins\n\nSan Francisco\n\n1932\n\nOh!
