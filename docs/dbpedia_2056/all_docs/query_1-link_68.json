        "text": "by Jenni Frencham\n\nEarlier this year the state of California passed a law requiring schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms, locker rooms, sports teams, etc. that match their gender identity and expression, rather than the gender they were assigned at birth. While some are attempting to overturn this ruling, I am among those who rejoice that kids can grow up as themselves, without anyone else caring about what they keep in their pants. I am glad for kids like Jazz and Coy, and parents like Gendermom. If you had asked me about these same issues five years ago, I probably wouldn’t have had much of an opinion. Still firmly entrenched in Fundamentalism, I’d likely have parroted whatever I heard from the pulpit about transgender persons, which at that point was nothing.\n\nLast week during the anti-gay chapels at Bob Jones University, there was little mention made of the “T” in “LGBT.” The one time transgender issues came up, the speaker acknowledged that being born transgender is indeed a possibility, but that transgender individuals need to be content with the gender God created them to be.\n\nEven now, I’ve noticed that many LGBT+ groups forget about the T. As a cisgender person myself, it would be easy for me to ignore this minority within a minority, except for one thing: I am married to a transman. For those who need a definition, the person I refer to as “my wife” was assigned the female gender at birth, but realized recently that he is, in fact, male. What his brain is telling him doesn’t match up with what his body tells everyone else.\n\nI can’t imagine forcing my spouse back into the mold that has ill fit him since he was born. Already things are a bit more complicated for us than for others. I use “he” and “him” when referring to my spouse at home, but “she” and “her” when we are in public. He’s not yet comfortable assuming a male identity. He thinks he isn’t trans enough, or man enough, to take on that gender. I know he cringes inside when people refer to us as “ladies.”\n\nSo I notice a lot more than I used to. I notice when applications for things as innocuous as a store savings card require the applicant to select a gender. I am frustrated along with him that so many parts of our language are gender-based, and that we don’t have a singular gender-neutral pronoun that people could use when unsure of a person’s preferred pronouns. I notice when bathrooms are labeled based on a person’s genitalia and there are no “family” restrooms available. I helped my spouse pore over our health insurance paperwork, weighing the cost of various companies in light of the many appointments, treatments, and possible surgeries that are in his future. I hurt for him when his mother insists on referring to him by his birth name. I held him and cried with him when we concluded that some of his preexisting medical conditions might preclude him from hormone therapy.\n\nFor these reasons and a dozen others, I am glad there is a Transgender Day of Remembrance. The trans* community is an often-neglected subset of the LGBTQ+ community, and this needs to change. The tide has begun to turn on the rights of gay and lesbian people. Now we need to rally around those who are trans* or gender non-conforming and assert that they, too, are human beings and deserve to be loved, accepted, and supported. As my spouse often says, “We all have baggage. The key is to find someone who will help you carry yours.”\n\nTweet\n\n//\n\nEd.
