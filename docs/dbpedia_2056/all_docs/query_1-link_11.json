        "text": "I am touched by the goal of \"creating\" objects with a strong interactive impact from different experimental areas, which leads me to conclude that The Inventors activities are a remarkable place to educate children and young people, making them perceive the reality around them with all their senses.\n\n(The Inventors) is an asset to everyone's academic life. I have a 3-year-old daughter and when I think about her future, I don't want her to be a doctor or an engineer, I want her to be able to create something, invent something, be useful. The Inventors is a weapon against the obsolete and mechanical school, it is an asset in the academic life of all students because it teaches them to think, to invent, to create, to be citizens and people with opinions, with ideas. Inventors are children who are better prepared to give Planet Earth what living beings need."
