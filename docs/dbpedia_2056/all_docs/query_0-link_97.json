        "meta_description": "Living memories of slavery in the Querimbas Islands, especially Ibo Island, are apt to reserve some surprises. When talking about slavery, some elders’ shared memories sometimes seem to be defensive, serving to justify the practice of slavery rather than decrying it. This may be ascribed to several factors. The reasons which lie behind this viewpoint seem to be related to recent past events in which forced labour and political repression of dissent were extremely cruel as to obscure the mistreatment of slaves. This paper will inquire into the memories of forced labourers and descendants of domestic slaves as well as into the policies that preserved servants from being coerced into forced labour.",

        "text": "1Recebido: 15 de dezembro de 2021\n\n2Aceite: 23 de janeiro de 2022\n\n4Research questions, then, were moulded by these results and I started asking how and why memories were recalled this way: which conditions fed such a position on slavery and which experiences of slavery were conducive to memories of this kind in the Ibo Island. Could it be that the most recent events of forced labour, as well as the repression of political dissent by the pre-Independence Portuguese government, was crueller and less desirable than domestic servitude ever was?\n\nFrom slavery to compulsory labour by laws\n\nQuerimbas Islands and their mainland\n\nMemories of domestic slavery versus forced labour\n\nPeople kidnapped women and took them as slaves. In my family there were two girls who were kidnapped when they were fetching water; they married in the Maconde area, and lived there where they had been taken. Their children were not considered pure Maconde, but not slaves. (Interview with Queen Namanga, Paquitequete, 9 September 2008, p. 4)\n\n11These two girls only came back to where they were born much later, after Independence, just for a visit as their lives and their children were now with the Maconde.\n\n12In the old days treatment of slaves was harsh, at least in the accounts concerning the Makhwa of the mainland. The slaves were not entitled to eat with the free and the free were afraid that they might poison their food or water. Slaves could not sleep in the presence of the master, they could only go to sleep but when everybody else was sleeping. Also children could not play with slaves for fear that something bad could be done to them. When there was a funeral of a noble person some slaves were buried alive with the corpse (Interview with Queen Namanga, Paquitequete, 9 September 2008). Memories of families recounted by a sixty-six-year-old chief in the surroundings of present-day Pemba describe some characteristics of the life of slaves among the Makhwa.\n\nIn this area the traders did not arrive directly, but people were captured and sold on the Lurio river. People were also captured in Montepuez and Nampula… We had captives in our family: Konani, Mwalipanani, Mwaweya and Nnakiphwanyava\n\nwere women and Nrimawee and Nkive were men… They worked in the field… If they behaved well the male slaves were also given a wife. (Interview with Régulo Athumani, Paquitequete, 5 September 2008, pp. 21-22)\n\n13Memories of having to escape from the Ngoni raids are recurrent among many people of both the mainland and Querimbas islands (Interview with Queen Namanga, Paquitequete, 9 September 2008, p. 1; interview with Machude Nazi, Metuge, 8 September 2008, pp. 4, 9). “There was a time in which the Ngoni used to raid villages to take people as slaves and sell them somewhere else… They kidnapped people to sell them” (Interview with Queen Namanga, Paquitequete, 9 September 2008).\n\n14People escaping from the Ngoni would do anything to find a secure place and were ready to offer themselves as slaves in quintals of wealthy people in Ibo (Interview with Ali Omari). When the Ngoni raided, people arrived in the island seeking a secure place (Interview with Hawa Athumani).\n\n15As to what happened to the slaves sold and brought somewhere in Cabo Delgado and why they often did not escape from where they had been taken, a general answer is that “there were certain ‘medicines’ to make them forget the place where they came from” (Interview with Queen Namanga, Paquitequete, 9 September 2008, p. 1). Moreover some of the people that were sold as slaves were for instance serial philanderers harassing married women or “layabouts”, thieves, adulterers, or trouble makers and crooks (Interview with Queen Namanga, Paquitequete, 9 September 2008, p. 7; interview with Bendito Brito, Nampula, 6 August 2010) whom, having once been sold, could not come back to where they originated from.\n\n17Descriptions from Ibo island view slavery from another perspective although it is clear that in Ibo Portuguese and aristocratic families kept their distance from the slaves and the servants. Slaves could not enter the master’s home and were not allowed to approach the quintal with their shoes on. Also, from the old days, cruel treatment was reported; as an example, a punishment for misbehaviour could include “hot iron passed on the head of the slave” (Interview with Ali Omari, Ibo, 11 September 2008). People who described slavery were sometimes themselves descended from slaves. In such cases, slavery was evaluated in comparison with their present condition perceived as one of poverty, and a sort of nostalgia was shown for the forms of protection and abundance of facilities which were available to slaves/servants, unlike the time that was to come.\n\n18Paulinha, an Ibo woman in her sixties, daughter of a European man and a servant of his house, described how women servants of slave descent who became pregnant by any of the males belonging to the quintal’s patron faced two options: either they would be sent away or they could be accepted into the household together with their offspring. Yet, she said:\n\nSlaves could not go anywhere else [than here] as they did not know the land they came from… so they had to stay… However, in those days one could find everything…, it is now that things are difficult to find. There was everything, clothes and cloth and food because it was the masters themselves who provided for it. (Interview with Paulinha Peres, Ibo, 12 September 2013, pp. 4-5)\n\n19On the contrary a Makhwa woman, a queen of her lineage, presents a different picture. When a child was born of a slave woman by her master, several possible options could be pursued depending on the temperament of the master. The abused woman could be transferred elsewhere or sold. The child could even be killed (Interview with Queen Namanga, Paquitequete, 9 September 2008).\n\n21I was then obviously spurred to compare these points of view with memories of the experiences of forced labourers in Cabo Delgado (Mozambique) in between approximately 1965 and 1974 which are generally recollected as extremely harsh and unpleasant. Narratives of forced labourers’ experiences describe young and older men being wrenched from their homes, obliged to work for six months in sisal plantations under extremely difficult conditions and subject to cruel punishments if they failed to finish the work they were assigned. Workers were roped together at a distance of five meters one another (Interview with Hiahia Ngumati, Paquitequete, 24 August 2015). A certain piece of land should be tilled in a day; if it was not finished, a second day and a third day were granted, after which punishment was inflicted. The most common was the palmatória, that meant being beaten repeatedly on the palms of the hands with a wooden tool, a sort of a spade with wooden rounded spikes. A labourer could be beaten 20 times on each hand. People who underwent the palmatória still had to finish their work with aching hands. When the forced labourers were discharged after the conscription period their salary was reduced by the amount needed for tax payments (Interview groups of elders in Metuge, 9 September 2013; interview with Ajimo Niparacusa, 9 September 2013). Some young people from Arimba were successful in fleeing their homes before the press-ganging was enforced, thereby managing to evade conscription (Interview with a group of elders in Arimba, 14 November 2014). The others had to work for six months in places like Nangororo, Namanja e Nyamwabala. Memories of forced labour – some of them from locations along the coast opposite the Querimbas Islands – were much more scathing than those of slavery, but were not conflated with slavery narratives. Some of the events recounted for forced labour are similar to the exploitation of the slaves working in sugar factories of the French Antilles, as follows:\n\nWhen working at the sisal fibre, sometimes the machine would catch the arm of somebody which had to be cut in a single stroke with a machete because otherwise the entire body could be taken into the machine. (Interview with Ajimo Niparacusa, 9 September 2013, p. 28)\n\n22In addition, life around the sisal factory is reported as being close to destitution with very little food and clothing available.\n\n24During colonial times (until just before 1974), one of the Ibo fortresses, the São João Baptista fortress, was used by the PIDE (Polícia Internacional e de Defesa do Estado) as a prison. Especially in the final years previous to Independence, people were often imprisoned before their offences could be proved, even just sympathising with the FRELIMO (Frente de Libertação de Moçambique) movement was then considered a crime so that people were tortured or killed on mere suspicion of such political affiliation. This repressive activity was intensified in the lead up to Independence.\n\n25One of the men, Ruben, the offspring of a relationship between a Banyan man and a woman of slave origin, but successfully introduced into the business affairs of his father as a specialized artisan, had this to say:\n\nSome people continued slavery… but those were times in which nobody dared open their mouths because the PIDE tortured people. You only had to make comments to be seized among those cocoa trees... among those cocoa trees [behind the Ibo fortress] there were mass graves containing 10, 20 or even 30 people. Some [prisoners] were thrown in alive after being cruelly beaten up. Some of those people asked us to leave them hidden in the bush so that, should they recover, they could escape. But for us this was very dangerous because if we had been discovered, the PIDE would have shot us. (Interview with Ruben Osman, Ibo, 11 September 2008, p. 12; interview with Athumani Taiari, Ibo, 11 September 2008)\n\nQuestioning memories\n\n28How come that in the case of Ibo Island some informants seem nostalgic for that period? Was it that domestic slaves on the island enjoyed a better kind of treatment, however discriminatory, than they would have encountered elsewhere, in circumstances where poverty and the labour policies would have made them vulnerable?\n\n29Slave status is described as a fact that could not be avoided and, sometimes, depended on the condition of poverty. Lady Hawa Athumani, one organizer of the female initiation rituals (riga) in the island, who was thirteen-year-old when the Companhia do Niassa left the area (1929), described the process through which a child could become a personal slave in Ibo and, possibly, elsewhere. Often in Ibo poor people could request shelter from a wealthy family. She said:\n\nIf a woman had been a servant in a home and died in pregnancy, the child could thus be brought up as a personal slave by the family for whom the servant had been working… [Or] if a woman in extreme poverty had requested to be fed by a wealthy family in times of famine when she could not support herself, she might leave her child to that family as compensation. (Interview with Hawa Athumani, Ibo, 14 September 2013)\n\n31Protection against raids and famine seemed to be a priority at the turn of the twentieth century. Ali Omari, born in 1933 and considered among the elders of the island, says:\n\nIn those days people lived in fear and were taken advantage of, but when they took refuge in the compounds (quintais) they felt at ease; they did not care about the money, but about security. (Interview with Ali Omari, Ibo, 11 September 2008, pp. 5-6)\n\n32Being the grandson of an African grandmother who had a child by a wealthy man of Ibo, his knowledge comes from stories passed down within his extended family.\n\n33Some other memories follow the same line. For instance, a seventy-year-old man, having, as the child of a slave woman, been a servant in a very wealthy family, was not particularly concerned about his “poor destiny”; rather, he was proud of having enjoyed a high quality of life (for that context) in an affluent home (Declich, 2015). Mother and child had stayed on as servants in the home and were considered “people of that quintal”. This testimony questions the usual assumptions about the undesirable status of those slaves who, after abolition, continued working as servants in the same home in which they – or their relatives – had been slaves. Apparently, there were some advantages in being part of the people of the quintal: while they were employed – maybe not paid but maintained – by the family of the masters of their ancestors, they could not be conscripted into forced labour.\n\n34Memories of past slavery on Ibo Island contain few descriptions of hardship and punishment but, rather, feature a plethora of examples in which slaves/servants were occupied in different characteristic activities and errands, serving the masters’ household: the personal slaves devoted their daytime hours to serving and attending the master; some slaves made visits and performed errands for their masters; the slaves of the veranda only admitted visitors who would be welcomed by the master; the slave leaders of the quintal directed all the others – some worked in the kitchen, some were messengers of the owner, others performed menial tasks, sometimes of the most unpleasant kind. Membership of a certain quintal did not exempt slaves from behaving with due deference to their owners. This would entail in addition to removing their shoes before entering the house, desisting from communication with the master unless specifically requested, and personal slaves could only eat after the master’s meal (Interviews with: Ruben Osman, Ibo, 11 September 2008, rub 1b, p. 11; António Baptista, Ibo, 5 September 2009; Hawa Athumani, Ibo, 11 September 2008). A description of domestic slavery particularly harmonious has been depicted by a man who, even being the son of a servant, was integrated into the patron’s family because the woman did not beget children on her own. His life, therefore, was that of one of the lucky mixed children who were accepted and educated by the patrons (Interview with António Baptista, Ibo, 5 September 2009).\n\n35However, in most memories that I was able to collect, slavery was not considered as leading to hardship nearly as much as forced labour was.\n\n36The production of this kind of memories and the perception of slavery which lies behind them can be related to some factors: memories of people who had been sold to the slave market and shipped away do not emerge from these recollections; almost all memories gathered in Ibo refer to domestic slavery in an urban context, usually in wealthy compounds, and not to experiences of people kidnapped and then sold to plantation owners in faraway places, or recruited as indentured labourers. In other words, these memories concern people who have been more or less successfully integrated. The memories reported in by Makhwa speakers of Metuge and Changa describe domestic slavery within the Makhwa, an institution that subordinated the captives to a sort of integration on the margins of society. The recalls of those who ended up sold also were not captured.\n\nPeople did not comment in public about the past status of a slave. Only some knew in secret, but even then it was recommended that such a person was considered as a family member. (Interview with Régulo Athumani, 5 September 2008, p. 23)\n\nMemories, female slaves and their children\n\n38The position of female slaves among the domestic slaves was clearly different from that of the males, particularly in the context of islands like Ibo.\n\n40As Ali Omari reported, “All the white people who lived here in Ibo had black families, I have a white family which is in Portugal, too” (Interview with Ali Omari, Ibo, 11 September 2008, p. 3). There was obviously a process of miscegenation, a process which is also recognized by today’s inhabitants of Ibo.\n\nSlaves, servants and forced labourers\n\n46In theory a servant should have been paid for the services; yet, there is not enough information on the extent to which this actually happened for most of the servants. There is, however, a court case from 1952 that indicates that even as late as the mid-twentieth century it was not unheard of a servant who himself did not expect any real payment. In 1952 Carlos, son of an old slave of a family, was still performing domestic service for the family in which he was born. During the court case for his divorce, the judges discovered that he had never been paid in cash, only in kind: he worked in exchange for food, clothes and shelter. The court sentenced the patron to pay all the arrears he was entitled to but, surprisingly, Carlos did not feel he had a right to receive the money and gave the amount back to his patron (Pereira, 1998, pp. 157-166, as cited in Thomaz, 2012, p. 188). His decision to return the money may have been motivated by any number of considerations – perhaps he was in debt to his patron, or he was the son of his patron – but the fact remains that he had not claimed a salary before the case came to court. Either he considered he was not entitled to a salary or he had been too afraid to ask for one.\n\n47If it is not clear whether domestic servants were, in fact, paid for their work, following the laws of 1878 and 1899 it is, however, certain that holding the status of servant, especially for males, entailed the important benefit of being shielded from recruitment as forced labour. This point was made by a slave woman’s son who was born ca. 1940 and had worked and lived as a servant in a prosperous family in the area (Interview with Rubio Anli, Arimba, 7 August 2015. Also Hiahia Ngumati, Paquitequete, 24 August 2015, p. 3 retro).\n\nA mix of memories\n\n48The way in collective memories in Ibo blend the domestic slave, liberto, and servant statuses suggests that the interviewees (who are not descendants of those who were sold away from Ibo or employed as indentured labourers) have not been left with a shared perception of a clear-cut change of status at the time the legislation transformed a large part of the slaves into libertos and thereafter into free people.\n\n49In Ibo, at the end of the nineteenth and throughout the twentieth century, social relations between slaves, servants, and masters were of a particular kind. Servants developed special obligations and expectations within the quintal of their original master. Even when a servant was no longer working for the original owner, he or she maintained a relationship with the people of the quintal (Declich, 2015). This made the quintal a specific social space, granting a network of relationships, protection, but also entailing duties and obligations, even after abolition. De Vilhena makes mention of the children of slaves who, though free at the time of his observations, would nonetheless continue to carry out the orders of their mothers’ former master (Vilhena, 1905, pp. 228-231).\n\nConclusions\n\n52One conclusion to emerge compellingly is that in this specific social context the value people give to autonomy and freedom is closely bound up with questions of poverty, wealth, opportunities and the social networks available. Freedom is always related to some form of dependence, it is not its opposite. Dependence and its different forms never occur in a vacuum and are relative to what can be done otherwise in isolation. In the context of Ibo, evidently, where some wealth passed through the richer households, ties with the wealthy people could lead to a higher standard of living than disentanglement from dependency ties.\n\n55In conclusion, memories of slavery should prompt us to revise our own ideal of freedom when studying contexts pervaded by extreme poverty and structural violence in which interdependence and network are and have always been crucial for protection, survival, and to maintain a good quality of life."
