Being the first portuguese nominated to join the group of 25 young leaders at the Munich Security Conference, and being able to participate in the discussion on international politics among the world's greatest leaders is not only a huge honor and a source of pride, but also, and above all, a huge personal challenge that I accepted with enormous humility and willingness to do it. 2. The travel to Ukraine, to the center of the War, to demonstrate my support for a country that is fighting to defend the most basic universal values such as freedom, democracy and national sovereignty. 3. My participation in the discussion on the new strategic concept of NATO, in Madrid, one of the most challenging moments of modern times, and also on Warsaw Security Forum. I'm looking forward to 2023!!"
