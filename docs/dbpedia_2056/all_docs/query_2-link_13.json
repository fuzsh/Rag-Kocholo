        "text": "After the demise of the Portuguese empire and even more after joining the European Union, the Portuguese state redefined the borders of national belonging. The shift was one from a multi-continental nation, which included parts of Africa, to a more restricted definition of nationhood, one that stressed Portugal's connection to Europe and thus defined belonging by descent. This article, based on research conducted in Lisbon, Portugal in 2003, discusses the impact of this shift on Portuguese citizens of ethnically diverse backgrounds. The Portuguese state, media, academia, and civil society are all involved in constructing, disseminating, and hence consolidating a notion of nationhood that treats ethnically diverse minorities as foreigners, placing them outside the national community. Not producing or disseminating information on ethnic minorities, the Portuguese academia, media, and the state are all actively involved in reproducing a process that perpetuates exclusion and obstructs the construction of political alliances to confront widespread discrimination.\n\nThe political representation of the overseas provinces in the metropolitan Parliament was, since the beginning of the liberal period (1820), one of the main features of Portuguese colonial administration. During the first half of the nineteenth century, that feature was almost unanimously seen as a sign of justice and equality in what concerned the relationship between all “parts” of the unified territory of the Nation. Nevertheless, questions related with how to rule the political representation of colonies or with the extension of the powers of the Parliament in legislating for the Overseas provinces were critical issues always discussed. Other critical issue had to do with the groups of colonial population who should be represented. Who were the citizens at the Portuguese Overseas territories? Empire. These are some of the issues which are studied in this text.\n\nThis paper shows how activists of social movements make public spheres and reinvent democracy through repertoires of collective action that are often considered as “non-conventional politics” and including as “irrational”, in particular by a certain Establishment and adversaries, but that are in fact actions having, on the contrary, their own rationalities, which reappraise the concept of conventionality in politics and in democracy, and finally the ideas and practices of politics and democracy themselves. (2012), “Alter-globalisation, Politics and Citizenship: An Account out of Portuguese Social Movements”, in Society, Crisis and Reconfigurations, VII Portuguese Congress of Sociology, Associação Portuguesa de Sociologia, Lisbon, http://www.aps.pt/vii_congresso/papers/finais/PAP0213_ed.pdf\n\nThe Constitution of Cadiz of 1812 defines the profiles of the spanish subject and spanish citizen, to ones a clearly modern citizen, to others, a still immersed subject in the corporate world of the Ancient Regime. Is still debated, therefore, if the gaditana constitution has the aspects of the modern citizenship or if it drags the conditions of the former local nature which tends to become universal in the Hispanic Empire. From the proposed Great Memorial of the Conde-Duque de Olivares and the Nueva Planta decrees of Felipe V, We intend to review the main questions which appears crystallized in the Novísima Recopilación, then discussed in the Cortes doceañistas. There the terms nature and citizenship played a central role in the discussions, as well as later uses of corporate conceptions.\n\nThe Portuguese 1974 revolution was initiated by the military, with huge popular support. The captains started the revolution, but then the generals took over, followed by politicians from the civil society. During the transition period, there was almost total elite replacement. Mostly it was a top to bottom revolution. But in local government, the people assumed control. Administrative commissions were put in place to manage the municipalities until the first elections took place in December 1976. At the same time, the Alentejo region was the stage of an Agrarian Reform, a political and social movement quite new and bold from a legal perspective. This research analyses a critical issue for its time, for it affected a strategic sector, it implied political decisions which concerned the use and possession of the land and the general functioning of the local political institutions and society. How did society react in face of such changes in politics, economy and social structure? What made people take to the streets and obtain 2 control of local government and economic resources? Who were the local elites before the revolution and who took their place? And were these new elites validated in the elections? For this research there was a consistent study of local sources, as well as an important gathering of local memories through interviews. In order to compare local elites in Portugal during Salazar’s dictatorship and then in the Democratic regime, a huge database was built with over 6.000 entries regarding mayors, councillors and civil governors. The above mentioned questions were answered by comparing biographies and by describing social groups, political paths and careers. In sum, the analysis of local elites provides the big picture of the carnation revolution and the real changes in the Portuguese transition to Democracy.\n\nThis article analyzes the trajectory of Brazilian society in search of democracy, without the intention of an in-depth chronological cut. Only referenced in the time period beginning with the Proclamation of the Republic, going through two dictatorial periods until the emergence of the \"New Republic\" and the convening of the National Constituent Assembly, with the promulgation of the Brazilian Constitution, constituting an arduous trajectory of redemocratization until the arrival of the \"Very New Republic\". The end of the first republican period that came to power through the political-military movement of 1930, caused a political upheaval and the protagonists of that period had difficulty in maintaining the cohesion of the movement, in view of the oligarchic dissidences. After, came the \"Second Republic\", characterizing the \"Vargas Age\", with the triumph of the revolution, then, the turbulent period of the military coup of 1964, until the political opening conciliatory of Tancredo Neves."
