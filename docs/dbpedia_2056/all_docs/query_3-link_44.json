        "text": "Gregore's research work is focused on physical activity and sedentary behaviour, with the goal of creating opportunities for improving public health. His PhD-thesis (2017), on the socioeconomic determinants and health consequences of sedentary behaviour in adolescents, was based on data from a large Brazilian birth cohort study (1993 Pelotas -Brazil- Birth Cohort Study). Gregore has been involved in a variety of population-based studies, and have professional experience working on the Coordination of Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Health Promotion in the Brazilian Ministry of Health. This involved the evaluation of large physical activity and health intervention studies, population health surveillance, summarizing examination of methodological tools for the evaluation of interventions in physical activity, and data analysis of risk factors for chronic non-communicable diseases. In 2015, he came to Australia to join the UQ School of Human Movement and Nutrition Sciences as part of his PhD training. During that time, Gregore worked with the Centre for Research on Exercise, Physical Activity and Health (CRExPAH) researchers on the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH) and HABITAT studies, and collaborated with other higher degree students on several exercise physiology projects. During his short career, most of Gregore's work has involved multidisciplinary research, transitioning from an early focus on physical education to the behavioural epidemiology of physical activity. Gregore's interest is in measuring and understanding inequalities in population health, particularly in relation to physical activity and sedentary behaviour."
