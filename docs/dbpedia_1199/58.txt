Le Tigre was formed in New York City in 1999 when Rudy Giuliani was mayor and regressive hipster irony ruled. The band abandoned traditional punk instrumentation, pairing drum-machine beats and looped 8-bit samples with the simplest, serrated guitar riffs and call-and-response vocals.

Though rage had its place in Le Tigre, the band, with celebratory songs such as “Hot Topic”was a departure for Kathleen Hana, who is best known as the singer of Bikini Kill. “Deceptacon” the lead track of Le Tigre’s debut, was perhaps an aesthetic bridge between that seductive register of rage and Hana’s new band’s dance floor ambitions. It was later conceived of as music “for the party after the protest.”

The members of Le Tigre shared a vision for multimedia performance and touring with a slide projector which became a key component of their live show. The band’s final show was on September 24, 2005 at the Operation Ceasefire concert at Washington Monument in Washington DC, where they joined a coalition of artists calling for an end to the U.S. war in Iraq. Then in August of last year Le Tigre reunited by performing at the This Ain’t No Picnic festival at the Rose Bowl.
