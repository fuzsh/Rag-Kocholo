        "text": "“Yellow Fever” and the Hypersexualization of Asian Women in Film\n\nIllustration by Beena Mistry In Stanley Kubrick’s 1987 war film Full Metal Jacket, Papillon Soo-Soo plays a Vietnamese sex worker soliciting American GIs. Scantily clad in a leather slit skirt and teetering high heels, she takes a long, slow drag on her cigarette and recites the lines, “Me so horny. Me love you long time.” The term became sensationalized. You might have heard female vocals ooze the phrase in a 1989 2 Live Crew track. It was … READ MORE\n\nImportant Update from Team Shameless\n\nIllustration: Beena Mistry Dear Shameless readers, You may not have received our latest publication or perhaps not read the letter from the Editor. We wanted to take a moment to share the letter from the editor on our website as Shameless is taking a moment to pause, to undertake rest, and to work through a chrysalis process so that we may emerge on the other side better equipped to do our work in the world. What does … READ MORE\n\nBits and Pieces: My Latest Creative Project\n\n“At the start of last school year, I felt entirely made of bits and pieces—stray rubble held together by the excitement of what the year had to offer but kept fractured by the inherent doubt of my own capabilities. If I’m being honest, I’ve felt pretty lost since going away to college, but I think that is because I am discovering a “me” I have never known; all my creative energy is going into creating her.” READ MORE\n\nCarless in North America: Pandemic Edition\n\nIllustration by Marlee Jennings “Just come by and pick it up.” “Curbside delivery.” “Just wait in your car.” How many times have you heard those phrases over the past two and a half years? A lot? So have I. In North America, it’s assumed that everyone has easy access to a vehicle. Being without a car in Canada or the USA puts you at a distinct disadvantage, and this has only been magnified during the COVID-19 pandemic. I … READ MORE\n\nDiet culture has no place in blood donation campaigns\n\nIllustration by Marlee Jennings As the Omicron surge took the world by storm last winter, the Red Cross declared a historic blood shortage in the U.S., and the internet was filled with pleas for donations. While donating blood is a great way communities can come together to save lives, the information available for people planning to donate is influenced by a culture that moralizes body size and food consumption. For example, blood donation campaigns encourage donors … READ MORE\n\nHow I learned to cope with my mental health in my South Asian family\n\nIn many South Asian families, mental health is still considered taboo, with reputation and honour often taking precedence. It’s led to a dangerous culture of silence that stems from a lack of acceptance and understanding READ MORE\n\nWe Need to Stop Buying from Brandy Melville: Here’s Why\n\nAsk anybody who came of age in the 2010s and they can describe to you the experience of being in a Brandy Melville store. That distinct, musky-yet-clean linen smell, the hangers wrapped in clothing scraps, the muted florals and lace trims, the feeling of inferiority to the workers. This was a time when the dominant aesthetic was the effortlessly beautiful and skinny, cut-off shorts and ugg-boot wearing Tumblr Girl. I remember scrolling through Tumblr with my … READ MORE\n\nIt’s Time For The Feminist Movement To Leave TERFs Behind\n\nUsing feminism to justify anti-trans sentiment is nothing new — it’s been a tactic since the origin of radical feminism in the 1960s and 70s. What is new is the rise in platforming transphobic rhetoric in Canadian mainstream media. READ MORE"
