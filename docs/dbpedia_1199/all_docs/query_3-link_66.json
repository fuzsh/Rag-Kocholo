Lyrics & Meanings: ten short years of progressive change / fifty fucking years of calling us names / can we trade title nine for an end to hate crime? / ru-486 if we suck your fucking dick? / one step forward, five steps back / one cool record in the year of rock-rap / yeah we got all the power getting stabbed in the shower / and we got equal rights on ladies night /  / feminists we're calling you / please report to the front desk / let's name this phenomenon / its to dumb to bring us down / F.Y.R. fifty years of rudicule / F.Y.R. take another picture /  / mrs. doubtfire on mothers day / on-the-job stalker for equal pay / toss us a few new AIDS drugs as mational healthcare bites ths dust / while you were on vacation black people didn't get reparations / you know these days no one's exploited / sorry dude can't hear you with my head in the toilet /  / feminists we're calling you / please report to the front desk / let's name this phenomenon / its to dumb to bring us down / F.Y.R. fifty years of rudicule / F.Y.R. take another picture /  / you've really come a long way baby / its you, not the world / thats totally crazy / cuz we really rocked the vote with election fraud in poor zip codes / celebrate gay marriage in vermont by enforcing those old sodomy laws / one step forward, five steps back / we tell the truth they turn up the laugh track /  / feminists we're calling you / please report to the front desk / let's name this phenomenon / its to dumb to bring us down",
