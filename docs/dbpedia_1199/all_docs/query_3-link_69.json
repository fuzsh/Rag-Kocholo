And we study their strategies to learn how to grow our brands. But we should pay equal attention to big names that are nowhere to be found. Learn to wonder why that is, where are they. Learn to anticipate, prevent and mitigate risks. Once-prominent fashion brands have faced challenges in recent years. Here‚Äôs a list of 20 fashion brands that have experienced shifts in popularity and sales + a brief reason why: 1Ô∏è‚É£Gap: Struggled to adapt to changing fashion trends, faced strong competition from fast-fashion brands. 2Ô∏è‚É£J.Crew: Overexpansion and high prices led to declining sales, struggled with brand identity. 3Ô∏è‚É£Abercrombie & Fitch: Faced criticism for its controversial marketing and branding strategies, struggled with relevancy. 4Ô∏è‚É£Forever 21: Rapid expansion and failure to keep up with e-commerce trends led to financial troubles. 5Ô∏è‚É£Diesel: Marketed as a luxury brand without the price point to match, faced increased competition in the denim market. 6Ô∏è‚É£Burberry (challenged in the past, but implemented successful turnaround): Over-licensing of its iconic plaid pattern led to brand dilution, had to refocus on luxury market. 7Ô∏è‚É£Tommy Hilfiger: Overexposure and brand dilution through mass-market distribution. 8Ô∏è‚É£Victoria's Secret: Faced criticism for lack of inclusivity, struggled to adapt to changing body positivity movements. 9Ô∏è‚É£Calvin Klein: Over-licensing of the brand led to dilution of its high-fashion image. 1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£Guess: Struggled with brand relevancy, faced increased competition in the denim market. 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£Fila: Lost its appeal as a sportswear brand and failed to keep up with athletic trends. 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£Under Armour: Failed to adapt quickly enough to athleisure trend, faced strong competition from Nike and Adidas. 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£American Apparel: Controversial marketing strategies and financial instability led to bankruptcy. 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£Marc Jacobs: Overreliance on sales promotions and outlet stores hurt brand image. 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£Balmain: Faced challenges in maintaining exclusivity while expanding its product lines. 1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£Stella McCartney: Faced challenges in scaling its sustainable fashion approach without compromising profitability. 1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£Roberto Cavalli: Struggled with frequent changes in creative direction and faced increased competition. 1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£Lululemon (in the past, recovered since): Controversial statements by its founder led to a dip in sales, but the brand has since recovered. 1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£Juicy Couture: Brand and product based on current trend. Fell out of fashion favor due to changing consumer tastes. 2Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£Salvatore Ferragamo: Faced challenges in adapting to shifting consumer preferences for luxury footwear. It's worth noting that some of these brands may have taken steps to address these challenges and have seen improvements in their business. Nevertheless it is important to know why they ended up there in the first place. üßê Don‚Äôt make the same mistakes üí°\n\nFashion companies are increasingly being valued based on their profits rather than just sales, a reversal of the trend during the zero-interest-rate environment of the 2010s. The bigger challenge in fashion M&A, however, is the dearth of buyers, including both private investors and strategic conglomerates. Today, there are a number of brands on the auction block, but few interested buyers. Last year, there were 118 acquisitions globally in the category, the lowest count in at least a decade, according to Dealogic. Ganni, A.L.C., Proenza Schouler and Isabel Marant are just some of the brands that have courted buyers or investors in recent years without securing a deal. It‚Äôs not just contemporary and luxury labels facing an uphill (though not impossible) climb to seal the deal; denim seller True Religion and t-shirt start-up True Classic are among the direct-to-consumer brands currently in the market.
