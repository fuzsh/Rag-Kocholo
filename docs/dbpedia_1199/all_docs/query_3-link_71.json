        "text": "If you‚Äôre looking for a sweet and simple French dessert to make at home, this Tigre pastry recipe is for you!\n\nTigre pastry ‚Äì also known as a tigre cake ‚Äì is a delightful, mini, dense and buttery almond cake speckled with chocolate pieces and filled with chocolate ganache. I was first introduced to this dessert while studying and living in Paris.\n\nI lived in a tiny apartment off Rue Montorgueil with floor space that was only about as big as a rolled out yoga mat. It was charming and oh-so Parisian though, and it was right down the street from the Stohrer, the oldest pastry shop in Paris (open since 1730!).\n\nNaturally, I spent a lot of time trying everything in the pastry case until I found my favorites: a caramel √©clair, mini chocolate filled beignets, and the tigre pastry.\n\nThe Stohrer eventually stopped making tigre cakes and I moved from Paris to Versailles, but tigre cakes are still one of my favorite French pastries to make at home. They are also one of my favorite recipes in my cookbook, French Pastry Made Simple. They are surprisingly simple but feel really special.\n\nWhat is a Tigre Pastry?\n\nTigre is a classic pastry that you rarely find in pastry shops now. If it‚Äôs name makes you think of ‚Äútiger cakes‚Äù then you‚Äôre exactly right! It‚Äôs named for its tiger-like appearance thanks to swirls of chocolate specks (frankly, I think it looks more like a l√©opard cake but I‚Äôm not about to change the name!).\n\nThe base of the cake is a butter almond cake, typically called a financier, that is made with rich and toasty browned butter. There are many different variations of financiers, but the tigre pastry includes a soft chocolate ganache filling that creates a decadent, melt-in-your-mouth treat.\n\nThese are typically made in special molds, but you can also make them with a muffin tin, mini muffin tin or mini donut pan if that‚Äôs what you have!\n\nTigre Cake vs Tiger Cake\n\nTigre cake and tiger cake seem like they‚Äôd be the same dessert, but they‚Äôre actually very different. If you try to search for tigre cake recipes using an English spelling, you‚Äôre more likely to find a Nordic chocolate marble cake that looks delicious but is definitely not a delicate butter almond cake üôÇ\n\nWhat You Need to Make Tigre Pastries\n\nThere are two main parts to making tigre cake: the cake batter and the chocolate ganache. Thankfully, you probably already have most of what you need in your pantry right now!\n\nTigre Cake Batter Ingredients:\n\nUnsalted butter\n\nAlmond flour or almond meal\n\nPowdered sugar\n\nAll-purpose flour\n\nEgg whites\n\nVanilla extract\n\nBittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped\n\nChocolate Ganache Ingredients:\n\nBittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped\n\nHeavy cream\n\nHow to Make Tigre Cakes\n\nMaking tigre cakes requires a few different steps but is actually quite simple. Even if you‚Äôre a beginner baker or you‚Äôve never tried to make French pastries at home, you can make these delicious cakes!\n\nHow to Make Financiers\n\nThe first step toward making tigre cakes is to make the financier base. And this process starts with making the delicious browned butter. You‚Äôll heat butter in a saucepan over low to medium heat, swirling the pan occasionally. Cook it until it starts foaming and brown bits form on the bottom and then remove from the heat.\n\nNext, mix together your dry ingredients in a bowl before adding in the egg whites, vanilla and browned butter. Once the batter is combined you‚Äôll stir in the chopped chocolate. Just make sure it‚Äôs not warm from the butter, or the chocolate will melt.\n\nCover and let the batter chill for at least one hour and up to two days to firm up a bit before baking.\n\nHow to Make Tigre Pastry Without a Special Mold\n\nWhile tigre cakes are traditionally baked in a special mold, you can make them in a standard cupcake tin (I like this one!). Make sure you grease the tin and only fill the molds ¬º of the way full. Then, to keep the cakes from rising too much, place a piece of parchment paper on top of the cupcake tin and top with a flat, sturdy baking sheet.\n\nOnce the cakes have baked and then cooled for about 5 minutes, turn them out onto a clean surface. Use a teaspoon-sized measuring spoon and use the back to firmly press into the bottom of each warm cake to make an indentation. This is where you‚Äôll put your chocolate ganache.\n\nHow to Make Chocolate Ganache\n\nChocolate ganache is so easy to make and so good. Simply place chopped chocolate in a small bowl and then heat the cream until just boiling and pour it all over the chocolate. Whisk to combine and you‚Äôre done!\n\nYou can transfer the ganache to a piping bag or simply use a spoon to fill the cavities of the tigre cakes with chocolate. Let the chocolate set at room temperature for about 30 to 60 minutes or (if you can‚Äôt wait) enjoy them right away with a gooey chocolate center.\n\nTips & Tricks for Tigre Pastry\n\nMaking tigre pastries at home is actually very simple, but following these tips and tricks can make it even easier."
