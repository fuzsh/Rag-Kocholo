        "text": "The neighbourhood’s cocktail scene is coming up roses with a new concept from the team behind Cry Baby Gallery\n\nFans of Cry Baby Gallery, Dundas West’s coveted speakeasy, might find themselves heading north to the city’s Rosedale neighbourhood for a taste of something new. Compared to Cry Baby, which boasts an industrial style with an underground edge, Le Tigre, the team’s new hotspot in Rosedale, is a high-contrast lounge decked in hot-pink neon lighting and lush greenery.\n\nIn a neighbourhood with a knack for balancing the old and new, Le Tigre is the perfect addition to Rosedale’s growing food and drink scene. Design elements are reminiscent of 1980s L.A. with cues of cosmopolitan cool that defined the turn of the millennium. “We were looking to provide an escape from people’s normal day, and being soaked in a pink environment is sure to do that,” says co-founder Rob Granicolo, who opened (and designed) the bar with partners Andrew Foster and Stephen and Michael Gouzopoulos. Coincidentally, the movie Barbie premiered just a couple of months before Le Tigre opened its doors, amplifying the pink-everything craze.\n\nFrom street level, passersby will notice a beaming bubblegum light from the bar’s second-floor window. “The design of the space was meant to contrast the reputation that Cry Bay has, with natural light and softer finishes,” says Granicolo. This neon lighting mellows greenery courtesy of The Corner Shop Gardens to add an element of haze into the space. The result is an atmosphere designed for nightcaps and conversation over the bar’s signature playlist, created to complement the aesthetic with tons of French electronica, funk and post-disco.\n\nWhether you’re a cocktail enthusiast or not, Le Tigre is worth a visit for the atmospheric value alone. Think: mindfully selected glassware to pair with every drink on the menu, bespoke furniture and pink leather-covered menus; the design’s most memorable hits are in the details."
