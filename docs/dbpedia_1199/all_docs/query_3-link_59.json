        "text": "The collective Also Cool teenage dream was fulfilled last week at Le Tigre and cumgirl8's show at Olympia in Montreal. We've been longtime fans of Kathleen Hanna's projects and couldn't wait to see cumgirl8 live after including them in a recent Playlist Refresh.\n\nThe line to get into the show represented every aspect of Montreal's feminist punk community, ranging from cool-looking parents and their children wearing Bikini Kill shirts to excited 19-year-olds sporting local bands' merch. Across the board, everyone shared a collective glow, looking forward finally to seeing the legendary trio onstage.\n\nThe merch was also in line with the feminist spirit of the show. A printed sign reminded attendees that \"the best way to support your favourite artist is to buy merch at their show - get off the Internet.\" We at Also Cool agree - the best way to support artists is to show up for your local scene IRL and support your friends' creative projects.\n\nFor those new to the world of cumgirl8, the NYC-based group met in a sex chat 8000 years ago in another metaverse. Made up of Lida Fox (bass), Veronika Vilim (guitar), Chase Lombardo (drums), and Avishag Rodrigues (guitar), the band started as an art collective in 2019. As reflected in their name, cumgirl8's work pushes against the status quo by satirizing themes in popular culture surrounding femme objectification, social media sensationalism, and capitalism.\n\nOnstage, cumgirl8 embodied the coolest punk girl energy, with all the members decked out in incredible outfits featuring mesh, corsets, glitter and ripped tights. Chase (the drummer) also seemed to play the entire set in heels, which is incredibly admirable. Their sound was hot and heavy, exuding it-girl confidence.\n\nLe Tigre was up next with incredible visuals and included lyrics for all their songs at the top of the screen, a sweet touch that made the show-going experience more accessible for everyone. They opened with \"The the Empty\" and followed with tracks spanning their entire discography.\n\nTheir performance also highlighted intersectional feminist discourse, sharing the backstories of many tracks and starting meaningful conversations around topics like reproductive rights, trans politics, PTSD recovery, and more. The show concluded with playful choreography that ramped up into \"Deceptacon,\" which was received by a joyful and cheering crowd.\n\nKeep an eye out for cumgirl8's upcoming EP phantasea pharm, which is set to be released on August 18th via 4AD."
