        "text": "Le Tigre will return to the road for their first tour in 18 years.\n\nThe electro-punk trio will play a lone show in Philadelphia on May 27 before heading over to Europe and the U.K. The North American leg of the tour will officially begin July 1 with a set at the Mosswood Meltdown Festival (hosted by filmmaker John Waters) in Oakland, California. Le Tigre will criss-cross North America the rest of the month, wrapping up July 28 at Brooklyn Steel in Brooklyn.\n\nTickets for all new shows will go on sale this Friday, Jan. 27, at 12 p.m. ET. Full info is available on Le Tigre’s website.\n\nSupport for the tour includes Shamir, Morgan and the Organ Donors, Claud, Big Joanie, Man on Man, Chicks on Speed, Pom Pom Squad, Dream Wife, Problem Patterns, Who is She?, Erin Markey, Cumgirl8, Morgan Bassichis.\n\nLe Tigre emerged in the late Nineties, with Kathleen Hanna linking up with Johanna Fateman and JD Samson following the breakup of Bikini Kill and the release of her solo album, Julie Ruin. The group released three albums between 1999 and 2004 before splitting in 2005.\n\nFor the next 17 years, the members of Le Tigre largely focused on other projects, only reuniting in 2016 for a song, “I’m With Her,” in support of Hillary Clinton’s presidential run. In August 2022, they finally reunited on stage at the This Ain’t No Picnic festival.\n\nLe Tigre 2023 Tour Dates\n\nMay 27 – Philadelphia, PA @ Union Transfer *\n\nJune 1 – Barcelona, Spain @ Primavera Sound Barcelona 2023\n\nJune 3 – London, UK @ Troxy **\n\nJune 5 – Manchester, UK @ Albert Hall ***\n\nJune 6 – Glasgow, Scotland @ Barrowland Ballroom ***\n\nJune 8 – Madrid, Spain @ Primavera Sound Madrid 2023\n\nJune 9 – Porto, Portugal @ Nos Primavera Sound Porto 2023\n\nJune 11 – Paris, France @ Le Trianon ****\n\nJune 14 – Amsterdam, Netherlands @ Paradiso *****\n\nJune 16 – Berlin, Germany @ Huxleys Neue Welt *****\n\nJune 17 – Hamburg, Germany @ Markthalle *****\n\nJuly 1 – Oakland, CA @ Mosswood Meltdown Festival\n\nJuly 3 – Vancouver, BC @ Commodore Ballroom ******\n\nJuly 4 – Vancouver, BC @ Commodore Ballroom ******\n\nJuly 6 – Seattle, WA @ Paramount Theatre ******\n\nJuly 7 – Portland, OR @ Roseland Theater *******\n\nJuly 9 – Los Angeles, CA @ The Greek Theatre ********\n\nJuly 15 – Chicago, IL @ The Salt Shed *********\n\nJuly 17 – Cleveland, OH @ Agora Theatre *********\n\nJuly 18 – Millvale, PA @ Mr. Smalls Theatre *********\n\nJuly 19 – Baltimore, MD @ Baltimore Soundstage **********\n\nJuly 21 – Toronto, ON @ History ***********\n\nJuly 22 – Montreal, QC @ L’Olympia ***********\n\nJuly 24 – Boston, MA @ Royale ***********\n\nJuly 25 – Boston, MA @ Royale ************\n\nJuly 27 – Brooklyn, NY @ Brooklyn Steel *************\n\nJuly 28 – Brooklyn, NY @ Brooklyn Steel *\n\nJuly 29 – Brooklyn, NY @ Brooklyn Steel\n\nTrending\n\nEditor’s picks\n\n* with Shamir\n\n** with Dream Wife\n\n*** with Problem Patterns\n\n**** with Big Joanie\n\n***** with Chicks on Speed\n\n****** with Who Is She?\n\n******* Morgan and the Organ Donors\n\n******** Claud\n\n********* Man on Man\n\n********** Erin Markey\n\n*********** Cumgirl8\n\n************ Pom Pom Squad\n\n************* Morgan Bassichis\n\nThis story was updated on 4/7 at 12:25pm ET to reflect the supporting artists on the tour."
