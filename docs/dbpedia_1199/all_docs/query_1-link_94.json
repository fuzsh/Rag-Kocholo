        "text": "In “Hot Topic,” a song by the band Le Tigre, recorded in 1999, the singer Kathleen Hanna name-checked, over an extremely danceable beat, dozens of feminist musicians, artists, and thinkers—fifty-seven, in fact. “Tammy Rae Carland and Sleater-Kinney / Vivienne Dick and Lorraine O’Grady / Gayatri Spivak and Angela Davis,” she sang. “Don’t you stop / Please don’t stop / We won’t stop!” The goal was to unify a sometimes unruly tradition, claim it, and fling it into the future. That’s what the music in “Hot Topic” did: its sixties-style girl-group backing vocals were layered over seventies-style free-jazz horns, an eighties-style drum machine, and the compressed, distorted electric guitar that had come to define rock in the nineties. It could all fit together, Hanna seemed to be saying, to make one extremely cool song. “You’re getting old, that’s what they say,” she sang, “but I don’t care, I’m listening anyway.”\n\nFeminism is an old and diverse movement, which is why, thirteen years ago, the feeling of inter-generational community conjured by “Hot Topic” was so appealing. Since August, the arrest, trial, sentencing, and recent near release of Pussy Riot has created a similar feeling. It’s not just that people around the world have been following the story; it’s also that Pussy Riot have tapped into the musical tradition of bands like Le Tigre, Bikini Kill (Hanna’s previous band), L7, Sleater-Kinney, and Bratmobile. Those bands—often grouped together as part of the “Riot Grrrl” movement—galvanized a generation of feminists in the nineties, and were vocal about the way that they, in turn, had been influenced by acts from the seventies and eighties, like The Slits, The Raincoats, and Patti Smith. Pussy Riot, who have identified the riot-grrrl movement as an inspiration, have done something similar. It’s not just that they’ve unified feminists around the world; they’ve done it across generations, too.\n\nIf you’re looking to learn a little more about riot grrrl, you can check out “Girl Trouble,” an article by Elizabeth Wurtzel, from the summer of 1992—the heyday of the riot-grrrl movement. It’s a survey of the “pro-female” rock and punk bands that created the template that Pussy Riot has inherited and modernized. (It also happens to be an incredible time capsule from a moment in pop history, when, for example, opinion was divided about whether Nirvana were any good; some people, Wurtzel writes, found them “loud and unlistenable,” while others were celebrating, prematurely, Kurt and Courtney’s “domestic bliss.”) “Back in the sixties,” Wurtzel writes, “just about the only woman playing an instrument other than acoustic guitar was [Velvet Underground drummer] Moe Tucker—the very name recalls the pseudonyms George Eliot and George Sand.” In the seventies, a few women, like Patti Smith, took charge, but remained the exception rather than the rule. The nineties had brought something new. Feminism and rock joined forces; riot grrrl was born.\n\nThe revolution wasn’t quite complete, however:\n\nThe one troubling aspect of what appears to be an industry-wide acceptance of hard-core women’s bands is the self-negating attitude that many of these women must take in order to insure that they’re viewed as musicians first, chicks second (or third or fourth or fifth or not at all)…. The problem is not with the music itself; it’s with the philosophical underpinnings and the attitudes that these women project to their fans. The only girl band that seems genuinely proud to be part of the second sex is Bikini Kill, a quartet from Olympia, Washington, whose lead singer, Kathleen Hanna, a former neighbor of Kurt Cobain (him again), is said to have inspired Nirvana’s big hit by writing some graffiti about how Cobain smells like Teen Spirit deoderant. The women of Bikini Kill—their guitarist, Billy Karren, is the token guy—advocate something called Revolution Girl-Style and publish their own fanzine, which is filled with feminist articles…. As a group of old-fashioned radicals, Bikini Kill actually marks the next step up the evolutionary ladder of women’s music, because, unlike L7 and Babes in Toyland, who see their gender as incidental or just a matter of cosmetic difference, Bikini Kill knows better. “What those bands do is go, ‘It’s not important that I’m a girl, it’s just important that I want to rock,’ ” Hanna told Options. “And that’s cool. But that’s more of an assimilationist thing. It’s like they just want to be allowed to join the world as it is; whereas I’m into revolution and radicalism and changing the whole structure. What I’m into is making the world different for me to live in.”\n\nIt’s tempting, of course, to look at Pussy Riot and see the riot-grrrl story brought to fruition. But the world has changed since riot grrrl’s heyday. Pussy Riot may record songs, but, when you get right down to it, they’re hardly a “band” at all; instead, they’re more like video performance artists (the performers in the group are outnumbered by their film crew). They don’t perform on stage and on schedule; instead, they show up unscheduled, on the subway or in church (basically, their real venue is YouTube). And where the riot-grrrl bands were witty, erudite, even ostentatious about their academic know-how, Pussy Riot is equally influenced by Oi!, an English punk tradition that favored a simpler approach. (Steve Kent, a guitarist for the Oi! band The Business, famously described Oi! as a way of pushing back against “trendy university people using long words [and] trying to be artistic”; one of the best moments in Pussy Riot’s “Punk Prayer” finds them chanting, “Shit, shit, this godliness shit! Shit, shit, this holiness shit!”) Pussy Riot may be using some elements of riot grrrl, but, fundamentally, they’re inventing something uniquely theirs. That, after all, is the point of “Hot Topic”: listening to and internalizing your predecessors’ work can actually help you make something new.\n\nStill, as their arrest has shown, Pussy Riot are connected to the riot-grrrl pioneers in ways that run deeper than style and sound. Beneath the aesthetic novelty that makes Pussy Riot fun, there’s a political continuity—and it’s that continuity that really matters. In an interview with Pitchfork last month, Hanna took pains to point out that she didn’t care about just how “riot grrrl” Pussy Riot might be. (“Who wants to restart something that’s 20 years old? Start your own fucking thing.”) What really connected her generation with theirs, she said, was a common feminist experience. “When I was in Bikini Kill, I had a guy pull me off the stage by my ankles and another guy spit an entire beer in my face… I know these are things that probably still happen to girls on the road all the time. I feel that’s why feminists—and especially feminist musicians—feel connected to this.”"
