        "text": "Already boasting an unparalleled career resume as the most influential regional Mexican group (Billboard) and the genres greatest statesmen (New York Times), the legendary Los Tigres Del Norte remain one of Latin Musics leading creative and socially outspoken voices, as they continue to sell millions of albums, regularly top sales and airplay charts, and win the recognition of their peers with multiple GRAMMY & LATIN GRAMMY Awards.\n\nNow, Los Jefes de Jefes turn their eye to the future with the forthcoming release of their new album Detalles y Emociones (Details & Emotions). The album continues Los Tigres heralded role as the leading voice of the immigrant community with 15 new songs that give life to the emotions of the pueblo in the form of corridos, ballads, cumbias and rancheras.\n\nThis album features prominent composers of the genre such as: Paulino Vargas Jr., Manuel Eduardo Toscano, Francisco Quintero and Pablo Castro among others, in this form Los Tigres del Norte narrate us the songs that give life to the emotions of the pueblo.\n\nThe albums first single Detalles (which is already racing up the Latin music charts), is a heartfelt corrido that is a reminder to the bands fans that while many are pursuing dreams of material wealth, that genuine demonstrations of affection and care for our loved ones are still a mans greatest riches.\n\nAnother sure highlight of Detalles y Emociones and one of Los Tigres most controversial songs to date is El Muro (The Wall), a highly outspoken track that challenges the idea of a proposed Border Fence between the United States and Mexico. A special bonus version of the track finds Los Tigres famed front man Jorge Hernandez sing in Spanish, English, German, French and even Farsi to symbolize failed border walls throughout history.\n\nFurther tracks in the grand tradition of Los Tigres del Norte include \"Lágrimas de sangre;\" Un Hombre De Ley; the emotion driven ballad Corazon Herido; Los Mal Portados; America Central, a rhythmic cumbia (which pays homage to the people of Central American who have welcomed the band with open arms throughout their career); Cuidado Con La Mesera which details the story of an undercover police woman who manages to trap fugitives through seduction.\n\nThe album concludes with a special message from Los Tigres del Norte, thanking their fans across the world for their years of loyal support and encouraging them to continue the struggle in spite of the adversities encountered along their lifes path.\n\n***\n\nThe release of Detalles y Emociones marks the eagerly awaited follow-up to Los Tigres highly praised 2006 album Historias Que Contar. Spearheaded by the #1 single Señor Locutor which paid tribute to the growing role of Latin radio DJs in connecting estranged family members in the immigrant community, Historias Que Contar contained 14 heartfelt corridos and proved to all that Los Tigres remain at the forefront of Regional Mexican artistry by winning both the most recent GRAMMY® and LATIN GRAMMY® Award for Best Norteño Album.\n\nShortly after the Spring 2006 release of Historias Que Contar, Los Tigres del Norte once again demonstrated their role as the leading voice of the pueblo by joining en masse with their community as the principal musical participants of the Great American Boycott (A Day Without Immigrants) rally in downtown Los Angeles. By appearing front and center at the biggest of the nation-wide rallies, Los Tigres were lending highly visible support to the millions of immigrants that came together to demonstrate their essential role to the economy and culture of the United States.\n\nLos Tigres del Norte in the new millennium\n\nThe dawn of the new millennium has seen the continued growth of Los Tigres del Norte, with the legendary group expanding their reach into new international markets and experiencing the most successful years yet in their nearly 40 year career.\n\nLos Tigres role as an essential influence to a generation of new Latin music performers was clearly seen with the 2001 tribute album El Mas Grande Homenaje A Los Tigres del Norte. The album, which is now a highly sought after collectors item, saw a wide range of leading Mexican rock bands performing a collection of Los Tigres del Nortes greatest hits and demonstrating that the groups fan base now spanned multiple-generations.\n\nThis respect for Los Tigres was demonstrated again in 2002, when the band gave the most highly anticipated performance at Mexicos 30th Annual Festival Cervantino. As a special tribute to the groups influence, Los Tigres was joined onstage by top rock performers such as Molotov, La Barranca and Julieta Venegas.\n\nThe year of 2002 continued as a pivotal year for Los Tigres Del Norte with the release of the internationally critically acclaimed album La Reina Del Sur. Inspired by the group, Arturo Perez Reverte, a Colombian born author living in Spain, penned the fiction novel La Reina Del Sur - inspired by the heroine (Camelia La Tejana) from the groups famed early corrido Contrabando Y Tracion. In support of the album, Los Tigres mounted an extensive and highly successful tour of Spain\n\nThis would signal the start of Los Tigres Del Nortes greatest international expansion to date, as tours soon followed that took the band to Asia (performing to U.S. troops stationed in Japan and Korea), as well as much more in-depth touring in Chile, Colombia and throughout Latin America.\n\nAs Los Tigres was winning over a legion of new fans across the world that were demanding recordings that highlighted the groups rich history, Fonovisa Records decided to launch the highly successful Herencia Musical (Musical Heritage) collection in CD/DVD format.\n\nThis collection compiled the groups musical legacy, along with new material; an accompanying DVD that includes the groups videos, photo gallery and biography. Thus far, the following collections have been released:20 Corridos Inolvidables, (2003) 20 Boleros Romanticos, (2003), 20 Norteñas Famosas, (2004) and Cumbias y Algo Mas (2005), all which have scored top tier positions on Billboard magazines Top Latin Albums sales chart.\n\nAdding to the success of Los Tigres del Nortes discography (albums & collections), Fonovisa Records recognized the importance of highlighting the groups film career by releasing DVD and CD soundtrack packages of some of their most important films - works that not only marked a milestone in the groups career but have become historical archives in Mexican cinema.\n\nTwo of these 2006 re-releases highlight Los Tigres work with the renowned director Ruben Galindo, a leading filmmaker in the genre of Cine de Frontera (Border Cinema), which addresses the economic and cultural divides between The Unites States and Mexico\n\nThe first film recently made available once again was the 1976 classic La Banda Del Carro Rojo. The re-released package spent two weeks at #1 on the Regional Mexican album chart and was quickly followed by the release of 1977s La Muerte Del Soplón.\n\nWith Historias Que Contar of course still charting throughout 2006, the success of both the soundtrack re-releases and the Herencia Musical series, saw Los Tigres chart three simultaneous titles in the Top-20 of the Regional Mexican album chart, and most impressively, chart a total of six albums in one calendar year.\n\nThis success was celebrated in the fall of 2006, when Los Tigres del Norte were recognized by Billboard with both an in-depth cover story, and an invitation to be the featured Q&A subject at the magazines first ever Regional Mexican Music Summit.\n\nTheir History\n\nSimply put, Los Tigres del Norte have achieved worldwide success by becoming the leading musical storytellers for multiple generations of Latin immigrants.\n\nThe group has taken the century old tradition of corrido (story, song, celebrating the enduring pursuit of truth, justice and opportunity, whether by heroes or ordinary folk) as an art form. Theyve made it their own powerful vehicle to express not only the plight and adventures of many who have come to this country from different parts of the world seeking a better life for their families, but also to bring attention to the many challenges faced by working people.\n\nThe godfathers of the Norteño genre have towered in the realm of Latin music, taking the polka rooted Norteño sound and mixing it with true tales of social injustices and current events. Their unique lyrics of social conscience have endeared them to millions of people who see in them a reflection of their past, present and future. Thus their fans have affectionately nicknamed them ' Los Idolos Del Pueblo\", (Idols of the town) for their sincerity and humbleness.\n\nA career span of more than three decades, millions of records sold, extensive concert tours throughout the United States, Mexico, Latin America, Europe and Asia, have made Los Tigres Del Norte international legends.\n\nComprised of founding musical director, lead vocalist and accordionist Jorge Hernandez, along with his brothers Hernán, Eduardo, Luis and cousin Oscar Lara, Los Tigres del Norte have followed their unique calling as musical messengers and documentarians on a journey that has brought them to unimaginable heights.\n\nFrom the beginning, Los Tigres Del Nortes music had been steeped in emotions of honor, pride and respect for their culture.\n\nIn 1968, a band of young brothers led by eldest child Jorge  all of 14, left their hometown of Rosa Morada, Mocorito in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico and headed to the United States in the hope of providing help in the support of their family. The groups name came about when an immigration official called them little tigers (nickname for kids) while crossing the California border. Since they were headed North, the name of Los Tigres del Norte (The Tigers of The North) was born.\n\nThe group established themselves in San Jose, California - the city that to this day remains their base. It was in San Jose during the early 70s, that Los Tigres Del Norte was discovered by an aspiring music impresario named Art Walker - who happened to listen to a live radio presentation of the group broadcast from the local Parque De Las Flores on Keyes Street, where San Joses Mexican community congregated on Sundays.\n\nThe group quickly became the first artist signed to Walkers upstart Fama Records, which in time became the leading Spanish language recording company on the West Coast. Upon signing, the group was advised to modify their sound from their traditional acoustic, to more of an electric sound with a full set of instruments (drum set, electric guitar, and bass) and went on to record their first album. With time, the group modernized their music, exploring elements of boleros, cumbias, rock, and waltzes.\n\nTheir socially conscious tradition began to manifest itself on Los Tigres Del Nortes earliest hits, such as Contrabando Y Tracion, a tale of contraband and betrayal starring drug trafficking couple Emilio Varela and Camelia La Tejana (1971), and 1973s La Banda Del Carro Rojo. Their preeminent role as a leading voice on the struggles of immigration took form with later songs such as: La Jaula De Oro (1986) which spoke of life in the gilded cage represented by the United States, where immigrants enjoy economic progress but their childen often forget their culture.\n\nAs part of Los Tigres mutually agreed musical mission, the group has never allowed their image to be misrepresented by being photographed with weapons or by the use of offensive language in their music. They have also taken it upon themselves to express their love and respect of women in their songs and to never glorify narcotic themes, instead approaching the subject in the groups role of true-to-life storytellers."
