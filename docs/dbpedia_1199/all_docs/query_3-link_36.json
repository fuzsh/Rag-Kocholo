        "text": "Here is one of the pens I bought last weekend, a burgundy Le Tigre 832 which appears to be in very good condition and never inked. As it is said to be quite scarce, and little is known about the brand, I'd just be as well show it here for the record.\n\nhttp://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x101/Seele2015au/LeTigre_01.jpg\n\nIt is a rather modest pen made out of plastics almost entirely, albeit decent quality plastics, the pen itself is not signed anywhere. the cap is lightweight aluminium with the name \"Le Tigre 832\" marked along the bottom of the cap. The clip is unsigned. I would date it to the early to mid 1970s.\n\nhttp://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x101/Seele2015au/LeTigre_02.jpg\n\nWith the cap taken off it is clear that it's a piston filler of standard configuration, the series of slotted ink windows is a common design feature found on many pens of this class. A regular style nib is fitted. When I was at school in the 70s, I used a fair few very inexpensive school pens similar to this, all of German manufacture, and most had nibs which were inset into the section to some degree.\n\nhttp://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x101/Seele2015au/LeTigre_03.jpg\n\nThe end of the barrel has a blind cap, covering the knob for operating the piston. If memory serves, the inexpensive school pens I used all had the end portion of the barrel working as the knob for this purpose, none of them had such a blind cap. It is also possible that an off-the-shelf piston filling mechanism can be employed easily with the blind cap design, or it can be serviced easier.\n\nhttp://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x101/Seele2015au/LeTigre_04.jpg\n\nAs the pen appears not to have been used, let alone worked on, there is no point thinking that the nib is not original to it. It does not carry the Le Tigre branding, but merely \"Iridium point\" and a logo of an animal (a deer or goat perhaps) against a mountain scene. I have seen this logo somewhere but cannot recall off-hand.\n\nThe feed is of injection molded plastics, so it's an indication that it is a mass-produced item. The feed and nib are pushed into a \"cup\" with threading at the back and that is screwed into the front of the pen. I was having a bit of problem reassembling the nib assembly, when the feed and nib were perfectly aligned, the tines were not totally even. I did a bit of tuning up and now it is as good as can be.\n\nI am not sure if I want to ink it up or just leave it as is, as a reference specimen; while pretty much nothing was known about the Le Tigre brand, it seems that the appearance of an example raised more questions.\n\nEdited October 12, 2012 by Seele\n\nAltecGreen,\n\nThanks for the lead, very helpful indeed!\n\nJonathan H's site has not included my example but it is certainly likely that the large scale German industry at the time made it favourable to source pens rather than build them. Dasi, the only all-Australian pen manufacturer built their own pens pretty much from scratch for a long time, but the last pens certainly appear to be German-sourced; one is on its way here and I shall examine it in detail and report later.\n\nAlso thank you for identifying the nib's maker; I would probably recall it's Bock's logo but goodness knows how long it'd take me to do so! If this nib is a replacement, the original nib fitted to this pen would have to be much better than the Bock it now sports, to warrant this pen to be treated as a parts source and no more: I cannot quite see how someone would buy this pen, take the original nib out, put in a Bock nib as it is less good, and then leave it in the bottom drawer without inking it once. If that be the case, CS would have specified a truly magnificent nib to be fitted to this modest pen. Further examination shows that, between the top of the feed and the underside of the nib, there is a bit of a gap... :hmm1:\n\nEdited October 12, 2012 by Seele\n\nBock is a good nib, not the least second class. Out side of China the worlds biggest nib maker.\n\nI remember as 'noobie' thinking that Bock was no good, because I'd not heard of them, and thinking 'in house' was best. I was wrong.\n\nFor a period of time lately @ 2000 they made Pelikan's nibs too. It could be they are still making the nib for the 1000.\n\nBock started @ 1938/9.\n\nI have gold, gold plated, steel Bock nibs in three flex stages, from nail to semi-flex. I might but have not kept perfect tract have a maxi-semi-flex/'flexi' Bock nib. It wouldn't surprise me.\n\n1932 Degussa bought up Osmia's nib making machines, because Osmia did not have a office supply company backing it like Soennecken, MB and Pelikan (MB made the first Pelikan nibs). They continued to make nibs for Osmia (with Osmia name and mark) and for many others. When the ball point pens took the market some where in the '60's-70, Degussa whose main business was machinery stopped making nibs. Degussa still exists.\n\nReform ( 20's?-mid-late '50's)made real good sturdy pens and nibs for many of the 120 German pen producers. When ball points came in too hard, the original owner closed down rather than make poor pens. Much later he sold his company to an other. The lesser quality of Reform's name today has nothing to do with what a real Reform was.\n\nRupp made only nibs(lion head) which were real nice nibs also from the '20's-70's. I have a 'flexi'/maxi-semi-flex from them.\n\nLuxor, Herlitz,Tropen, Lamy made their own nibs I believe.\n\nKaweco made the greatest nibs up to 1930, that includes Soennecken, MB, Pelikan, Swan, Parker, Sheaffer or any one else.. Hand hammered and annealed like the US Morton from whom they bought the machines and imported the US workers and families to Germany in April of 1914...then came August and the Americans went home. After going bankrupt in 1930 they made nibs like everyone else, good but not the true best....\n\nThat Bock managed to get started against real stiff competition, and remain in business making nibs...against all the big boys was because it's nibs were good.\n\nAll the big boys made nibs with other company marks for the small boys. Degussa had such a good name, the small boys used a Degussa nib with pride, of good workmanship.\n\nIn a time when even made for a department store pens had to have good enough quality, and everyone was supplying nibs to any one, Bock survived and prospered. So a Bock nib is a good one.\n\nThe German invented Department Store, which could not sell a pen that was not of adequate quality, in there were pen stores all over the place.\n\nBock made good nibs, and I'm so glad when I started out I did not toss the Bock nibs thinking they was 'cheap' no name steel nibs on broken pens I inherited. It took me a 'long' time to find out what that Goat was.\n\nToday when I see a pen on German Ebay with a Bock nib, I'll go for it, even if it's a 'replacement' nib, or on a 'no name' pen. (I chase vintage pre'66 pens.)\n\nOh, be aware many to most vintage German nibs were made with with very little very expensive 'iridium'; so were flat or much flatter on the bottom making the nib \"stubbish\" compared to US or many English nibs.\n\nIt is not as I thought with the inherited pens in had that started me back into fountain pens, that some 'Idiot' had taken the nibs to a stone for some reason or another.\n\nI was as wrong there as I was thinking Bock made poor nibs because as 'noobie' I was unaware of the rest of the story.\n\nI'd not learned that 'iridium' if let set a generation or two can develop micro-corrosion, that can be cured by the brown paper bag trick or what an Oblique nib was. \"Scratchy\" nibs were cured by gentle use of the brown paper bag and a proper hold.\n\nBock gives the company ordering exactly what they want; now nails or regular flex. If some company wanted semi-flex nibs, Bock would order up a roll of what ever alloy be that gold or steel they once used and stamp them out. Too bad no pen company wants 5,000 semi-flex nibs.\n\nEdited October 12, 2012 by Bo Bo Olson"
