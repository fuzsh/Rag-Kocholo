Le Tigre was formed in 1998 by Kathleen Hanna, Johanna Fateman and Sadie Benning. The band is known for its left-wing sociopolitical lyrics, dealing with issues of feminism and the LGBT community.[1]\n\nThe band's self-titled debut album was released in October 1999. In 2000, Benning left the group to pursue a career as a film director.[1] They were replaced by JD Samson on Le Tigre's second studio album Feminist Sweepstakes. Released in October 2001, it is a hybrid of genres, combining hip hop, dance and punk music.[2] In the United States, the album reached number 43 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart.[3]\n\nAfter signing a recording contract with Universal Records, Le Tigre released their major label debut, This Island, in October 2004.[4] The album reached number 130 on the US Billboard 200 and number five on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart.[5][6] It produced three singles, two of which reached the top 75 of the United Kingdom singles chart.[7] In 2007, the band announced that it was taking \"an extended break from all things Le Tigre\".[8]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nList of studio albums, with selected chart positions Title Album details Peak chart positions US\n\n[5] US Heat.\n\n[6] US Indie\n\n[3] Le Tigre[a]\n\nReleased: October 26, 1999 (US)[9]\n\nLabel: Mr. Lady (MRLR07)\n\nFormats: CD, DD, LP\n\n— — — Feminist Sweepstakes[b]\n\nReleased: October 16, 2001 (US)[2]\n\nLabel: Mr. Lady (MRLR19)\n\nFormats: CD, DD, LP\n\n— — 43 This Island\n\nReleased: October 19, 2004 (US)[10]\n\nLabel: Universal (B0003385-02)\n\nFormats: CD, DD, LP\n\n130 5 — \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart.\n\nExtended plays\n\n[edit]\n\nList of extended plays Title Album details From the Desk of Mr. Lady[c]\n\nReleased: January 23, 2001 (US)[11]\n\nLabel: Mr. Lady (MRLR14)\n\nFormats: CD, DD LP\n\nRemix[d]\n\nReleased: February 19, 2002 (US)[12]\n\nLabel: Mr. Lady (MRLR24)\n\nFormats: CD, DD, LP\n\nMorning Becomes Eclectic (KCRW Live)\n\nReleased: February 22, 2005 (US)[13]\n\nLabel: Universal\n\nFormat: DD\n\nThis Island Remixes Volume 1\n\nReleased: July 4, 2005 (US)[14]\n\nLabel: Chicks on Speed (COSR23)\n\nFormat: LP\n\nThis Island Remixes Volume 2\n\nReleased: July 4, 2005 (US)[15]\n\nLabel: Chicks on Speed (COSR24)\n\nFormat: LP\n\nThis Island Remixes\n\nReleased: September 12, 2005 (US)[16]\n\nLabel: Chicks on Speed (COSR25)\n\nFormat: CD\n\nLe Tigre Live!\n\nReleased: March 13, 2012 (US)[17]\n\nLabel: Le Tigre\n\nFormat: DD\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nList of singles, with selected chart positions, showing year released and album name Title Year Peak chart positions Album UK[7] \"Hot Topic\"[18] 1999 — Le Tigre \"New Kicks\"[18] 2004 — This Island \"TKO\" / \"Nanny Nanny Boo Boo\" 50 \"After Dark\" 2005 63 \"I'm with Her\" 2016 — Non-album single \"—\" denotes songs which failed to chart.\n\nOther appearances\n\n[edit]\n\nList of other appearances, showing year released, other performing artists and album name Title Year Other artist(s) Album \"Sweetie\" 2001 — Calling All Kings & Queens[19] \"The Mayor is a Robot\" Men's Recovery Project False Object Sensor[20] \"Wordy Rappinghood\" 2003 Chicks on Speed 99 Cents[21] \"We R the Handclaps\" 2004 Junior Senior Hey Hey My My Yo Yo[22] \"Sisters, O Sisters\" 2007 Yoko Ono Yes, I'm a Witch[23]\n\nRemixes\n\n[edit]\n\nList of remixes, showing year released, artist and album name Title Year Artist Album \"Girl Serial Killer\"\n\n(The Dear Hanin remix) 2000 Hanin Elias In Flames: Remix EP[24] \"Revolt\"\n\n(Le Tigre remix) 2005 Lesbians on Ecstasy Giggles in the Dark[25] \"Standing in the Way of Control\"\n\n(Le Tigre remix) 2006 Gossip Standing in the Way of Control[26] \"Fleur De Saison\"\n\n(Le Tigre remix) Émilie Simon Végétal[27]\n\nVideography\n\n[edit]\n\nVideo albums\n\n[edit]\n\nList of video albums Title Album details Who Took the Bomp: Le Tigre on Tour\n\nReleased: June 7, 2011 (US)[28]\n\nLabel: Oscilloscope (OSC–033)\n\nFormats: DVD, DD\n\nMusic videos\n\n[edit]\n\nList of music videos, showing year released and director Title Year Director(s) \"Deceptacon\" 1999 Miguel Gutierrez[29] \"Well, Well, Well\" 2001 Elisabeth Subrin[30] \"Keep on Livin'\" Paper Tiger Television[31] \"Well, Well, Well\" (Alternate version) 2004 Elisabeth Subrin[32] \"New Kicks\" Samuael Topiary[33] \"TKO\" Rainbows & Vampires[34] \"After Dark\" 2005 Wynne Greenwood[35] \"I'm with Her\" 2016 Laura Parnes[36]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
