        "text": "As Kathleen Hanna’s paradigm-shifting punk quartet, Bikini Kill, was disbanding in the late nineteen-nineties, the feminist musician and art agitator began collaging together drum machines, samples, and all manner of D.I.Y. balladry. She crafted the room-of-one’s-own solo album “Julie Ruin,” and with it envisioned a still vital template for homespun pop experimentation. “Julie Ruin” begot Le Tigre, the prescient electronic trio that Hanna pursued with JD Samson and Johanna Fateman (who has contributed to this magazine). The reunited Le Tigre arrives at Brooklyn Steel (July 27-29) with its commitment to offering a protest and a party—replete with choreography, neon, video displays, and slashed guitars—intact. The group’s classics, like “Deceptacon” and “What’s Yr Take on Cassavetes,” offer critiques of music culture and narrate evergreen debates within art. On “Hot Topic,” the group presents a celebratory syllabus of feminist and queer artistic predecessors “who made us feel like we could do anything.” (July 21.)"
