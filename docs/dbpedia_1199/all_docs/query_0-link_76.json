        "text": "Welcome back to Parsons Playlists! To day we feature a collection of Riot Grrrl music curated by Music Library Associate Melanie.\n\nRiot Grrrl\n\nRiot grrrl began in the early 1990s as a DIY, feminist punk movement. Riot grrrl saw girls as a “revolutionary soul force” with the power to disrupt the status quo; rejecting social constructs of how women were supposed to look and behave; and zeroing in on personal and political discussions of sexism, sexuality, sexual violence, female empowerment, racism, ageism, homophobia, fat shaming, and able-bodiedism.\n\nThe riot grrrl movement allowed women their own space to create music and make political statements about the issues they were facing in the punk rock community and in society.\n\nThis playlist is inspired by the Music Library’s current exhibit: “Girls to the Front: The Riot Grrrl Revolution” which you should come to the library to take a look at should you have the time or inclination.\n\nIt features riot grrrl music from the 1990s(ish), and tracks by fellow travelers, antecedents and descendants.\n\nBikini Kill – “Rebel Girl”\n\nSleater-Kinney – “Call The Doctor”\n\nBratmobile – “Cool Schmool”\n\nExcuse 17 – “Watchmaker”\n\n7 Year Bitch – “Dead Men Don’t Rape”\n\nThe Runaways – “Cherry Bomb”\n\nScreaming Females – “Glass House”\n\nBikini Kill – “Double Dare Ya”\n\nSleater-Kinney – “Be Yr Mama”\n\nTribe 8 – “Neanderthal Dyke”\n\nBabes In Toyland – “Sweet ’69”\n\nLe Tigre – “Hot Topic”\n\nSlant 6 – “Poison Arrows Shot At Heroes”\n\nMary Lou Lord – “Some Jingle Jangle Morning”\n\nEmily’s Sassy Lime – “Mr. Moneybag$”\n\nAutoclave – “Go Far”\n\nBratmobile – “Bitch Theme”\n\nX-Ray Spex – “Art-I-Ficial”\n\nBabes In Toyland – “He’s My Thing”\n\nLunachicks – “Bad Ass Bitch”\n\nPJ Harvey – “50ft Queenie”\n\nGossip – “Where The Girls Are”\n\nHeavens To Betsy – “Me & Her”\n\nTeam Dresch – “Uncle Phranc”\n\nBratmobile – “Gimme Brains”\n\nSleater-Kinney – “I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone”\n\nBikini Kill – “Suck My Left One”\n\nSleater-Kinney – “Dig Me Out”\n\nBacchae – “Read”\n\nWet Leg – “Wet Dream”\n\nRiot Grrrl Sessions – “I Eat Boys Like You For Breakfast”\n\nMaya Jupiter – “Never Said Yes”\n\nLady Parts – “Bashir With The Good Beard”\n\nThe Linda Lindas – “Racist Sexist Boy”\n\nHoneyblood – “You’re Standing On My Neck”\n\nTacocat – “Men Explain Things To Me”\n\nBABYMETAL – “Headbangeeeeerrrrr!!!!!”\n\nKate Nash – “Fri-End?”\n\n7 Year Bitch – “Kiss My Ass Goodbye”\n\nThe Linda Lindas – “Oh!”\n\nHere is a link to the whole playlist on YouTube: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU94rco57ZezIt5ZNJHN15UP-GdKW3huz"
