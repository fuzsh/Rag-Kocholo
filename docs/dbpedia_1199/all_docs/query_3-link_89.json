        "text": "Johanna Fateman is most famous as a musician — she was the founder, with Kathleen Hanna, of the germinal feminist dance-punk band Le Tigre — but she has always worn multiple hats. A mother, business owner and art critic, Fateman recently picked up the title of New Yorker columnist when the magazine invited her to write regularly for its “Goings On About Town” section. “The majority of my time and mental energy is definitely spent in writing,” Fateman says. “Of course, Le Tigre will always be something people want to talk about.”\n\nHer regular byline is not the only job that demands her sustained attention. Fateman also runs the business end of Seagull, a unisex salon in the West Village, while her partner Shaun Surething manages the styling. The salon is a neighborhood landmark from the 1970s that predates them both; it was New York’s first unisex barber shop. They took it over in 2006, which gave Fateman the freedom to pursue music and writing. “It’s a tough reality. Obviously, devoting yourself to something as demanding as a true art or writing practice is more than a full-time job,” Fateman says. “But I am kind of a romantic. I think that if you are an artist or a writer and you need your voice to be heard, it’s not really a choice, so you have to figure out how to survive around that. There is such a destructive opposition in our culture that you are either creative or good at business. Who is that really serving? It’s serving trust-fund art.”\n\nIt’s a fitting mantra for the salon. The good vibes radiate from the staff, who are friendly and attentive with customers — and tend to make each other laugh, too. The atmosphere keeps regulars, including Brooke Shields and Tavi Gevinson, coming back. “I always see Shaun, and he is a consummate artist. I can always count on him for a very stimulating 45-minute conversation from a queer/feminist/magical perspective; and I so appreciate having his council as I confront the problems of self-presentation and aging,” says the artist Carol Bove, who just opened her first solo show with David Zwirner. She’s been going to Seagull for several years and has seen multiple stylists there. “They have all satisfied my chief requirements with my short haircut, which are that the transitions look considered and that my cowlicks are subdued.”’\n\nBove is not the only one in it for the banter. “It’s like I’m hanging out with my best girlfriends, who happen to do really great hair,” says the comedian Bridget Everett. “I think what Johanna and Shaun have created is really special. It feels like family. The family you create — not the one you were born into.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
