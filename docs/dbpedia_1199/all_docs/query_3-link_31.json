        "text": "Work of the Week is excerpted from The Back Room, our lively recap funneling only the week’s must-know art industry intel into a nimble read you’ll actually enjoy. Artnet News Pro members get exclusive access—subscribe now to receive this in your inbox every Friday.\n\nSummer has finally arrived in London this week, and so has the city’s annual June art week, which sees a busy line-up of auctions and fairs. One of them is Eye of the Collector, a curated boutique event that showcases 20th- and 21st-century art and design from 18 exhibitors from Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. This year, it’s taking place at the Grade II–listed Garrison Chapel at the capital city’s Chelsea Barracks.\n\nAmong the works that caught our eye is Le Tigre (2022), a rug version of a canvas work of the same name by the artist Jordy Kerwick. Born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1982, the self-taught artist is now based in Albi, France. He took up painting in 2016, and uses a bold palette to create dreamy depictions of animals and mythical creatures. They have won him a solid following, and he has had exhibitions in Los Angeles, New York, and Madrid, where he showed nine works at the Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza earlier this year.\n\nThe canvas version of Le Tigre (2020) holds the artist’s record at auction, having sold for $277,200 (including fees) against a fees-free high estimate of $35,000 at Sotheby’s New York Contemporary Curated sale in March 2022.\n\nMade with hand-knotted recycled sari silk in Persian knots, Kerwick’s rug measures about 9 feet by 8 feet and has some iconography not present on the original canvas, like objects and animals surrounding the tigers that suggest additional pictorial narratives. The texture of the textile has also added an extra sense of depth to the composition. If you missed out on winning the earlier Le Tigre at auction, you may have more luck with the rug. The example on view is one of two artist’s proofs from an edition of 10.\n\nFollow Artnet News on Facebook:\n\nWant to stay ahead of the art world?
