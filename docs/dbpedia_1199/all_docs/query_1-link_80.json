        "text": "Feminist electro-pop band Le Tigre wanted to explore different ways of being political punks than just playing slash-and-burn guitars and sneering. As the \"riot grrrl movement of the mid-'90s neared the end of its golden age, former Bikini Kill frontwoman Kathleen Hanna and 'zine publisher Johanna Fateman decided that bright, shiny electronic music was the answer.\n\n\"We knew that we wanted to make a new kind of music at least, new to our scene, said Fateman, who performs with Le Tigre on Monday at Cain's Ballroom in Tulsa. \"I think we wanted to challenge the stereotype of what a political band would sound like. I think there's this kind of idea that, to do a political band, you have to be angry all the time and the music has to have a certain aggressive sound that wasn't necessarily poppy or danceable. We wanted to experiment with different models for making feminist music.\n\n\"There should be music that is a celebration of community, not just a critique of what is wrong with the world, she said.\n\nLe Tigre charged out of the gate with that concept on its 1999 single, \"Hot Topic, a bouncy, sample-heavy song that namechecked several of the band's heroes, including author Dorothy Allison, Billie Jean King, race car driver Shirley Muldowney, Aretha Franklin, Gertrude Stein and Joan Jett, who once produced a Bikini Kill single. It was a radical change from the sound of Hanna's old band, but when Bikini Kill folded, Hanna and Fateman were looking for new experiences.\n\nFateman published a 'zine called Snarla in Portland, Ore., which covered underground art and was circulated within the punk scene. At a Bikini Kill show, Hanna, a partner in a publishing venture called Riot Grrrl Press, asked the audience if there were any 'zine publishers in the crowd. \"I went up to her after the show and gave her my fanzine, Fateman said. \"We didn't keep in touch or anything for awhile, but ... she really liked Snarla and tracked me down where I worked.\n\nFateman and Hanna first collaborated musically in the Troublemakers, a Portland-based surf-punk band, but they soon gravitated to the \"electroclash aesthetic that became Le Tigre's signature sound. The trio (which originally included filmmaker Sadie Benning, later replaced by J.D. Samson) was conceived as a backing band for Hanna's solo alter ego, Julie Ruin, but evolved into a full-time group.\n\nAfter two acclaimed full-length discs and an EP for the independent label Mr. Lady, Le Tigre signed with Universal Records for its 2004 album, \"This Island, which includes the single \"TKO and a charged-up cover of the Pointer Sisters' wedding reception standard, \"I'm So Excited. Hip-hop producer/rapper Missy Elliott recently did a remix of \"Punker Plus, the final track on the disc. This move toward a more corporate and polished environment raised eyebrows in Le Tigre's more radicalized fan circles, but Fateman said this was an opportunity for the group to reach more people.\n\n\"We decided it was a risk we wanted to take to get our music to a wider audience, she said.\n\nFateman said Universal has never talked to the band about softening its material.\n\n\"Not to us, anyway, she said. \"They knew what they were getting into when they signed us.\n\nIN CONCERT\n\nLe Tigre\n\nWith: Electrelane.\n\nWhere: Cain's Ballroom, 423 N Main, Tulsa.\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Monday.\n\nTickets: $16 advance, $19 day of show.\n\nInformation: (918) 584-2306.\n\nArchive ID: 2557780"
