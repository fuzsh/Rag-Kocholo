        "text": "I wanted to do as much data checking before posting, checked net speeds, network and so on, before doing in-world tests - and I have to say, I'm left a bit baffled (more then usual!)\n\nSo here we go...\n\nI log in following the Wednesday restarts, to our home in Best. Everything loaded fine, didn't really see any issues, except for one \"slow-ish\" menu - beyond that, again nothing out of the ordinary. Something provoked me, call it a whim, to check statistics, and I admit when I did, my jaw dropped, and I let out a comment that would make an old salty sailor blush, when seeing the rather extreme amount of packet loss.\n\nNow, I've been on weak net in the past, in fact spent most of my years on SL, on wireless (which yes, works, but sucked!) so I've seen my fair share of packet loss, drops and other \"wonderful\" issues. However, since switching to fiber, I haven't seen much if any packet loss 0.7 at the most and on a rare day, slightly more. This afternoon, I felt the stat was going to bust, as it was in the 70s...not 0.70, but 70%, and that was after I decided to check. So I relogged, checked it, another rather horrid high number, but I did notice while watching it, it dropped like a rock....slow moving rock, but dropped just the same.\n\nIn the past, I've seen this happen upon logging on to our home sim in Best, then when hopping to our shop in Badger, it seems to clear or lower to 0.1% or even 0.0, basically going back to normal. So again, on a whim, I relogged but logged into our shop in Badger, checked the stats, 0%....and it stayed at 0%. As soon as I tp back home, packet loss starts to climb again.\n\nThe weird part of it all, as in the past, I saw issues with packet loss - lag, latency, menu's slow to respond, and yet with this huge number, I'm not seeing any of that, which I guess can account for faster net speed over all..\n\nSo to test things further, I relogged to Badger again, then flew from our shop to Norway in an H160. I checked the stats several sims later around Idlewood in Bellisseria, and it had jumped up to 9.0%. Then checked again a few sims later and it was still climbing...however, further on, it began to drop. So I figured, once on to Blake it would drop the rest of the way...nope...if anything it fluctuated and then increased.\n\nThing is, again, and I can't stress this enough, I didn't notice any oddities due to packet loss that's normally seen - no crossings issues, and for those that know, the H160's controls tend to be very sensitive so any lag or latency, can throw things off, but it didn't happen..the flight was actually really good, in fact only saw one or two \"slow\" crossings in the normal slow areas over Blake.\n\nSo to run another \"test\" I hopped back to Badger, cleared my cache, relogged back in to Badger, and again 0% packet loss. I tp to our club in Remonta, still no loss, tp'ed home back to Best and as you can guess, it shoots up again to over 25%. So I quickly tp to our other shop in Symmetry, (where I'm at now watching the data) and am watching it slowly drop. It's at 19.0% now, and I've been here 17 minutes or so.\n\nI know our home in Best is on an RC sim, but until a little while ago, I didn't know which one specifically it was on. After checking region details I see it's on Le Tigre. Our locations in Badger, Symmetry, and Remonta are all main channel..\n\nOh and as a side note, my ping has been normal: between 80-110. highest I say was around 120 for a second or two, but nothing outrageous that I've seen come with packet loss in the past. Max bandwidth is set to 800 (yes I know I can run it higher, but I'm paranoid lol)\n\nMy question is, is this a result of the new PBR that's been added to Le Tigre today..as in, is there some issue with it?\n\nAnd if so, will switching to a viewer that supports it, rid me of the packet loss?\n\n**I'm currently running the latest Firestorm (NOT the PBR beta version) 69596 to be exact.**\n\n*** Further test edit - I just dropped in Harwich in Bay City which is also on Le Tigre and the packet loss started to climb from where it had dropped when back on a main channel. It shot up from where it had dropped at 14% to 19% but then dropped down to 18.5 ***"
