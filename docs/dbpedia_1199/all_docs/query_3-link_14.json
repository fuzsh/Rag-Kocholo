        "text": "I must agree with most of, if not all the definitions provided by the other poster. A tigre or tiguere translates into:\n\na street smart\n\na thug\n\na gangster\n\na very wise guy for good (or for bad)\n\na shark\n\neven a very intelligent person\n\nIt depends on the context when you use the word tigre which I use a lot when talking among Dominicans.\n\nThe Diccionario de americanismos has different meanings on tigre for Dominican Republic:\n\ntigre\n\nII. 1. m-f. Cu, RD, Co, Ve, Ec, Bo, Py, Ar; Ur, p.u. Persona muy hábil en alguna actividad.\n\nIII. 1. m-f. RD. tíguere, persona golfa.\n\n2. RD. tíguere, persona cuya identidad se desconoce.\n\nI for instance found this sentence in La fiesta del Chivo (2000), by Mario Vargas Llosa, which is based in Dominican in the 60s:\n\nTrujillo, en un viaje a Estados Unidos, se enteró de que el pimpollo de los afiches era un tíguere domicano.\n\nNote the usage of 'tíguere' instead of 'tigre', which is also used in Diccionario Dominicano:\n\n“Tiguere” se utiliza para definir a una persona oportunista, tramposa o astuta, es aquel individuo que tiene un buen repertorio de habilidades para manejar muchas situaciones. Que no se deje engañar facilmente y que siempre ve o busca ventaja en las cosas.\n\nJust returned from the Dominican Republic this week - the small town of Guerra to be exact where they explained 'tigre' ('tiguere' is the animal there) and Tiguerona to me.\n\nIt definitely is used with a good connotation as well as a bad one. Doesn't always have to be negative.\n\nA person who is wise and street smart and someone who will take advantage of the situation be that both GOOD or bad. A shark is probably a good English parallel (like a card shark).\n\nEither way the person is wise and smart... now whether the tigre or tiguerona uses his strengths for good or for bad is to be determined.\n\nI definitely watched them use tigre or tiguerona as a compliment as well!\n\nI lived in the Dominican Republic for a couple of years and I heard it used in a few different instances (used both in negative and jokingly positive ways):\n\nTroublemakers in the street (members of gangs, etc.)\n\nPrankster\n\nScoundrel\n\nBold or daring person (men mostly)\n\nIt is also occasionally used with women ('tigra'), but not as often.\n\nIn Spain I'd say it has a positve connotation. Calling someone 'tigre' is a friendly and casual way of praising someone:\n\nImagine two friends randomly meeting on the street:\n\n¿Qué pasa, tigre? ¿Qué haces tú por aquí?\n\nand/or maybe cheering him up:\n\nImagine a soccer player that has spent the whole match sitting on the bench; now his coach picks him to play the last 10 minutes:\n\n¡Vamos, tigre! ¡A por ellos!"
