Why is China buying up gold in addition to oil, farmland, and minerals all around the world? If China, now the world's second largest economy, consumes the way Americans did, it would absorb so much oil, food, minerals, and water in a few years that there would be little left for the other 5 billion of us The populations of the industrialized countries are declining (except the USA, only because of expanding Hispanic population, many of whom are illegal immigrants) while those of the Third World are still rapidly growing with increasing pressure on food and water. A new world order is still evolving and it will not likely be to our liking.
