        "text": "In this episode I chat to tabletop game designer Grant Howitt about creating stories out of thin air. We talk about the magic of gathering together to make stories with friends, how characters flow out of the simplest backstories, and ways in which you can use the techniques of roleplaying and improv to get over your creative fears and be happy, prolific and daring in your writing. Grant also talks about his new book, SPIRE, co-written with Christopher Taylor, a roleplaying game and world where you play terrorists trying to overthrow the oppressive high elves of a gigantic and deeply weird city-tower.\n\nThis episode is great to listen to if you want to know:\n\n– what makes a good character?\n\n– what drives a brilliant plot?\n\n– how can I use roleplaying techniques to write better and more?\n\n– how can I learn to think like my character?\n\n– what is a tabletop roleplaying game?\n\n– how can I overcome perfectionism?\n\n– can I use creative/roleplaying techniques to feel a bit better?\n\nYou can find some of Grant’s brilliant games (including free one-page rpgs you can play with friends in an afternoon) here.\n\nSPIRE is available in hardback here.\n\nFollow him on Twitter: @gshowitt\n\nHere’s a great blog he wrote called 11 Ways To Be A Better Roleplayer that handily serves as a fantastic list of ways to write better and get your characters into more and more interesting flavours of trouble.\n\nLike the show? Gorge yourself on period weirdness with my novel THE HONOURS.\n\nWant to help me pay my exorbitant hosting bills & keep the lights on? A few bucks chucked my way would be deeply appreciated.\n\nThank you, and please don’t forget to share the show, subscribe on SoundCloud and iTunes, and pop me a little review if you like what I do."
