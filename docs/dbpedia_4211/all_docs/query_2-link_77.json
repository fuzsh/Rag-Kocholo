        "text": "Sometimes Kaveh wishes he were more of a reader.\n\nIt’s not as though he doesn’t read at all, of course; he’s not illiterate or averse to words or one of those people who insists upon lectured learning following Sumeru’s reliance on the Akasha (and look where that led them, hmm?). But he reads to learn about the world and his studies and the new theories coming out in his field, and he hardly has the time to read for pleasure if he’s devouring papers outside of his discipline just so he has something to argue about with Al-Haitham.\n\nAl-Haitham, on the other hand, undoubtedly reads not just to learn but because the learning brings him joy. It’s one and the same, for Al-Haitham. Sometimes Kaveh thinks of him as a starving man. Al-Haitham collapses into his armchair with a book and folds himself so deeply into the pages that Kaveh has to double-check to make sure he hasn’t disappeared completely into them. Al-Haitham flips through pages with deft fingers, a furrow in his eyebrows that Kaveh has come to expect after many months of studying him, his spine eventually shrinking itself over the pages as if he, too, is trying to be consumed by the hardback covers. Al-Haitham reads like he’s hungry.\n\nKaveh wants to know what that feels like, but he doesn’t get it, not really, and if he does then it’s not to the extent that Al-Haitham does, so instead of sitting down with him he builds an entire world around Al-Haitham.\n\nHe upgrades the bookshelves to a golden mahogany instead of the warped and worn wood that’s been sitting there for decades, changes the curtains out from the black out sheets into flowing, translucent cloth that billows in the wind in the shape of their home, swaps the frosted glass for newer windows designed to let the light in but not the swampy heat, and repaints the walls by hand so that the room feels more open instead of shadows, sitting down dutifully every day to listen to the dry scrape of his paint brush against the walls with the tender knowledge that Al-Haitham is always within eyesight. All he has to do is turn around.\n\nIt certainly is an endeavor and a project that greedily sucks time from his other commission work that he should really be working on, but he can’t seem to help it, even though they’ve only been living together for only half a year and dating for three of those weeks. It’s a slow and dripping, sacred kind of hollow time that they’ve carved out for themselves right into the thick clay of the rest of the world. Kaveh hides out under their outlook and grips Al-Haitham’s beating hand in his and thinks, maybe, that Al-Haitham hasn’t even noticed that they’re looking out at everyone else through adobe-strewn eyes. Soft gaze, velvet skin.\n\nBut it would be unfair to Al-Haitham to assume that he’s anything but observant, and during the citrus-soaked afternoon of August when Kaveh finally finishes the last touches of the reading room, a series of inoffensive paintings that Kaveh purchased from an artist he’s particularly liked over the years, Al-Haitham says, slow but sure, “Kaveh.”\n\nKaveh turns, hair falling over his shoulders. His heart thuds suddenly; it’s one thing to plan out a design and it’s another to see a vision realized, especially one in the shape of a dream called Al-Haitham that will grow seven years old come January, and it cuts to the fissures of his bones, shimmering up inside of him like vines, greedy in their eagerness for sunlight. “Yes?”\n\n“Have you finally finished building your latest project?” Al-Haitham asks. His book is set to the side. Kaveh doesn’t catch the elaborately enameled bookmark he usually slides within his dry pages—he must have finished it just as Kaveh took a step back to admire his handiwork.\n\n“I almost thought you didn’t notice,” Kaveh admits, traipsing across the room to halt in front of Al-Haitham, taken by the almond-shaped flash of teal eyes stricken against the honeyed walls surrounding him.\n\nThis could be a painting all by itself, this picture of Al-Haitham strewn lazily over the armchair he’s inhabited nearly every day Kaveh has lived in his home surrounded by the thrumming Al-Haitham-and-Kaveh mise en scène Kaveh had painstakingly built on his hands and knees, wooden grain after knot after parchment lampshade. Threading love right through his fingers to string it up like lights. Sanctuary with a name that they call home.\n\n“How could I not?” Al-Haitham says, and Kaveh feels buoyed, weightless. “You’ve spent my mora replacing my perfectly good bookshelves, and it’s hard to ignore you puttering around me for days on end.” Kaveh deflates.\n\n“If you didn’t like it, you could have said so earlier,” Kaveh mutters. It’s a difficult line to walk in a new relationship, especially one as slow-rising and painfully young as theirs. The outline of it is certain but rough, the foundations drawn in sand instead of bedrock. The tide pulls up to the coastline.\n\n“I didn’t say that at all,” Al-Haitham counters, turning his head even as his eyes continue to track Kaveh’s movements. Sand sinks between Kaveh’s toes. “I like it. It might be some of your best work yet.”\n\n“You’re only saying that because I didn’t charge you for doing any of the work that I installed by hand,” Kaveh huffs, reaching out with his foot to kick at Al-Haitham’s shin and finding himself hooking him in by the ankle instead, the movement as familiar as knocking knees under their too-small dining table.\n\nAl-Haitham hums, not disagreeing, and Kaveh’s frown deepens even though he fights to keep it on his face. There’s something about the salt-slick beat of summer with Al-Haitham that makes it difficult to find anything to turn his nose down upon. “Perhaps.”\n\n“Al-Haitham,” he says, half reprimanding and half agonized by the way the name has worn a familiar groove into Kaveh’s tongue. He turns to perch on the arm of the chair and picks up the book Al-Haitham had left on the side table. Turns it over in his hands and tries to figure out if he’s imagining the residual warmth left behind from Al-Haitham’s touch.\n\n“It reminds me of you,” Al-Haitham says, slow and pondering as it is certain, and Kaveh almost topples over right then and there when he realizes that it had only taken work and meal times and sleep to tear Al-Haitham out of this room where he’s perpetually surrounded by the sweetened remembrance of Kaveh built up around him. It’s perhaps one of the most romantic things he could have said at the moment in that understated and yet viciously evident way of his.\n\nGod, Kaveh wants to say. Don’t remind me of how much I love you, Al-Haitham.\n\nKaveh says, “Do you want to go on a walk? I read in an Amurta paper that sitting for too many hours shortens your lifespan significantly, and your gray hairs have already grown in, so who knows how much time you’ve got left.”\n\nWhat he means is this: Do you want to go on a walk? I’ve made our home pretty but the weather is nice today and the birds are singing as they fly, and I feel like flying but I can’t do that so the least I can do is sing. You liked that science fiction book about a plant-ridden dystopian world so we could walk through the forest and you could tell me about the overgrowth if you like. I just feel like being alone with you. Every flower that pushes its roots through the soil looks like love. Golden hour is pretty but the sun has nothing on the pulsing, beating thing in my chest when you look at me when your eyelids are hooded. It’s irreverent. Do you ache, too? Won’t you walk with me, Al-Haitham?\n\n“I won’t want to if you insult me any further,” Al-Haitham says, but he’s already standing, shedding the afternoon’s lethargy like cascading water. “I don’t know why you think the best way to cajole me is to make pointed remarks about me.”\n\n“It works, doesn’t it?” Kaveh says. He stands by the door, keys in hand. The little growling lion yawns up at him and turns waiting eyes on Al-Haitham.\n\nAl-Haitham isn’t smiling, but he looks soft, waterlogged by sunlight flowing through him like a ballad. “I would’ve thought that you would forget the keys,” he says offhandedly, opening the door before Kaveh even as his face slips into a frown. He waits. “Go ahead.”\n\n“And they say chivalry’s dead,” Kaveh says sarcastically, rolling his eyes as he steps out the front and into the light. It must be his mood, or maybe it really is the sun, but the cobblestone gleams before him like stars. “Clearly, this ‘they’ party has never come across Al-Haitham.”\n\n“They’d be forced to reconsider the way they see the world, and that would never do,” Al-Haitham says, locking the door with swift, easy movements, and then he turns. “Where do you want to go? I’ll follow.”\n\nKaveh’s heart pinwheels and spins out to his ribcage and careens back with a solid thud, the reverberations leaking through him like spilled milk. He’ll follow. He’s not used to such candid declarations of want, even if others wouldn’t ever see his dry statements as proclamations of desire. But he knows Al-Haitham. Knows the tender shape of his love and the ragged outline of his body when he’s dreaming. And it springs upward toward the sun in tiny green sprigs, the very weeds pushing through the cobblestone in the vain hope of survival, and Kaveh knows. Everywhere you look is made of love.\n\n“Out of the city,” Kaveh decides, already thinking of the forest and the birds, the mushroom species that Tighnari has relentlessly pointed out to him only for him to forget their names time and time again to no avail, the shade of the dancing leaves that will hide them from the heat. He’s thinking of the book that had graced Al-Haitham’s bedside table three evenings in a row and the dry rustle of paper when his fingertips scraped against the parchment.\n\n“You still can’t be seen with me, can you,” Al-Haitham hums, taking his place just beside Kaveh anyway as if he would want him anywhere else. As if their sides did not naturally fall into each other, the shapes and contours matching at every peak and valley. Kaveh feels Al-Haitham’s finger touch Kaveh’s palm and he spots a new branch of blossoms that he swears wasn’t there the last time he walked this way.\n\nIt’s not quite true anymore. Kaveh says what he likes and guards the secret of his residence as if he’s clutching the last secret to remain his own at his chest, which he was. In the wake of Alcazarzaray, which thrust him into a spotlight dyed by the crimson cauterization of the Withering, all he had that was his was his own suffering. The affair of his debt and the corner that he’d shamefully driven himself into, right into the home of the very person who predicted this, all those youth-bruised years ago.\n\nNow, he has other things to keep to himself. How Al-Haitham’s lips feel when they’re pressed against his temple. The dimple all the way down on Al-Haitham’s back, hidden like a confession. The sacred place they’ve built in their bed, home within a home within a home. That morning Kaveh woke up to find Al-Haitham already awake, seeding a pomegranate. The curve of his back was like a dulled scythe. He’d startled when Kaveh approached him too suddenly, the bowl in his hands tipping over until it spilled glistening ruby gems all over their counters and floor. That day, Kaveh learned what Al-Haitham looked like with pomegranate juice smeared over his chin, bloody red sweetness digging into the curve of his frown the harder Kaveh laughed and used his thumb to rub at his face. That day, the fruit was inordinarily sweet.\n\nOther people will never know these anecdotes. They’ll never carry those memories on a chain around their necks the way Kaveh does, tucked safely underneath his shirt, and that’s why he cares a little less if people find out that he now resides with Al-Haitham. He still has so much. He still has so, so much.\n\n“It would be embarrassing, but I’ll allow it,” Kaveh decides in response to the non-question Al-Haitham had posed all of that deliberation before. The city will forget them in a few hour’s time, anyway. That’s the beauty of being forgotten—you get the chance to reintroduce yourself to the world, time and time again. They’ll get lost again, and they’ll get to be Al-Haitham-and-Kaveh a million ways over. They’ll get lost again, and Kaveh can’t wait.\n\n“Allow,” Al-Haitham repeats dryly. “Only if Master Kaveh deigns it to be okay.”\n\n“Now you’re getting with the program,” Kaveh says, his smile this time a quiet thing smeared into the red of his mouth, and it only blossoms when he feels Al-Haitham’s pinkie finger stretch out and wrap around Kaveh’s corresponding finger, the chain linking them together ironically being the thing to bring Kaveh the closest to his breaking point.\n\nAnd that, too, remains one of their most precious secrets to be broadcast to the entirety of Sumeru City.\n\nOn a day when Al-Haitham, who usually does all of the grocery shopping for their household, is too busy with the residual effects of resigning from his position as Acting Grand Sage, Kaveh takes to the market all by himself.\n\nIt’s not as if he never shops for himself. He’d lived plenty of years without Al-Haitham, after all, many of which he spent taking care of his mother in the resounding wake of his father’s death. It’s probably part of why Al-Haitham likes taking care of Kaveh in turn, as if he’s passing on the mantle of responsibility. But Al-Haitham likes it, and he’s good at taking care of people, the sketches of that inclination outlined in honeyed walnut gold. Kaveh counts himself lucky that he has the privilege to bask in it.\n\nThe few times he does go to the market, however, are usually on Al-Haitham’s arm anyway—those occasions are usually because he wants to cook something special that includes ingredients they don’t normally keep stocked in the house, so he goes with him just to make sure he’s purchasing the correct product.\n\nIt’s his first time at the Grand Bazaar alone in a while, and he can feel it, the piercing eyes of nearby merchants flagging him down easily. If there’s anything about this space, it’s that the aunties and uncles like to talk: amongst themselves, with the matra standing by at the entrance, with anybody who will lend their ear for five minutes.\n\n“Handmade jewelry!” one merchant calls out to him, chains gleaming even in the dimly lit underground tunnel of the bazaar. On the other side of the street, a vendor calls out to Kaveh, a handmade silken scarf in their hands.\n\nKaveh wanders through the sea of specially grown heart-shaped fruits imported from Inazuma and carefully packaged boxes of delicate baklava adorned in silver ribbon and tapestries stretching longer than his arms can pronounce, feeling a little lost. He doesn’t even know why he’s here, not really, driven only by the desire to get something for Al-Haitham that would fail to encapsulate his feelings for him but draw out the beginning of it nonetheless. It all starts with a gesture, anyway. Nothing extravagant. Nothing grand. Just an opening, an arrowhead wedged into a not-quite wound, not-quite scar.\n\n“Flowers for your beloved!” an auntie calls, and for some reason, that’s the thing that stops Kaveh in his tracks. The last time he’d bought anyone flowers had been for a wedding, and the time before that, a funeral.\n\nHe stoops in the middle of the street, ignorant of the flow of people behind him forced to stumble and alter their route around him, an island in the midst of a storm. The flowers beam back at him, cheery in the face of their disregard.\n\nOrange blossoms fold around themselves like paper mache and others in blooming varieties of deep red and bold purple and the purest of whites shiver in his presence. They’re almost bursting out of their pots, and the single-stemmed flowers are drawn together into generous bouquets, a dozen sparks of life strung together with twine.\n\nStaring at all of that, confronted by everything the lofty ideals of romance are supposed to be, a hundred thousand symbols of arbitrary love-lorn longing, Kaveh, inexplicably, thinks of Al-Haitham.\n\nAnd he laughs. Al-Haitham wouldn’t hate to receive flowers per se, but he’d view it on the lower end of the range of useful objects he could be gifted. He’d say that Kaveh has already cluttered the house with enough of his own things that he thinks are necessary for the interior design, even though Al-Haitham is of the personal opinion that it’s all junk.\n\nBesides, Al-Haitham does buy his own flowers, a few stems a week of whichever blossom piques his fancy that he sticks in water by the kitchen window, the shadow of which gleam over the tile and reach with hungry fingers to the silhouettes of Al-Haitham and Kaveh.\n\n“Are you going to buy anything, sir?” the woman asks him, smiling politely.\n\n“Not today,” he says, and she accepts his apologetic words with grace as he exits the market entirely and heads for the spot that he knows would have the one thing that Al-Haitham would appreciate the most.\n\n“Al-Haitham,” Kaveh calls when he returns home, a paper bag rustling behind him as he kicks off his shoes in the front room and arranges them neatly beside Al-Haitham’s. The keys get tossed into the bowl, the familiar ringing chiming like wedding bells as they collide with Al-Haitham’s set.\n\n“Kaveh,” comes Al-Haitham’s voice, an easy identifying noise that allows Kaveh to track him down to the reading room. The bookshelves surround him as they always do, tall and looming structures holding every piece of Al-Haitham that he has decided to put up in memorial. “Where were you?”\n\n“I got you flowers,” Kaveh says, and when Al-Haitham looks up, Kaveh pulls the paper bag out from behind his back instead of the cellophane he was probably expecting.\n\nAl-Haitham takes it, the heft of it taking him by surprise if the slight widening of his eyes says anything, and Kaveh waits with a sort of thrumming energy circling through his body. He’s new to this, remember. He’s only had so many days of being Al-Haitham’s boyfriend before he can figure out every way he can know him inside and out.\n\n“They’re books,” Al-Haitham says as he pulls out the first of the stack, an oddly youthful tinge of wonder in his voice.\n\n“Thought you’d like them a bit more than flowers,” Kaveh mutters, suddenly, fiercely bashful in the way that only Al-Haitham can pull out of him, coaxing and certain. His heartbeat kicks in late, though he hadn’t even noticed that it’d stalled.\n\n“Flowers die, but words live forever,” Al-Haitham says. Kaveh settles into the sofa facing Al-Haitham and snorts, relaxing back onto the cushion to take in the sight of his quiet joy.\n\n“You take away all the beauty of flowers if you label them as just another thing that’s going to wind up gone,” Kaveh counters. “I could burn your novels right down and you wouldn’t be able to get those lines back.”\n\n“I’d still remember the way they inspired me,” Al-Haitham argues, eyes flicking up to Kaveh. Kaveh curses himself for building this room around Al-Haitham, the man in his mind the entire time because it suits him too damn well. Makes him look good without even trying.\n\n“And you wouldn’t remember the fleeting happiness that flowers would bring you?”\n\n“Flowers are ordinary because anything could be beautiful—” and Kaveh disagrees because he looks at blossoms and he sees Al-Haitham within the folds, “—but it is only with books that I read the contents and think, without fail, of you, Kaveh, even if the sentiment is a thousand years old. Despite the author and despite the subject and despite whatever ugliness they must endure because even in words, the sun must rise in the morning. You will always be there in the morning.”\n\nAnd Kaveh really, really hates what Al-Haitham does to him because he can control his work and he can control the friends he surrounds himself with and hell, he can even control everything down to the last minute detail of the reading room he’s just built for them but he can’t stop himself from reacting to Al-Haitham, whether it’s the flush in his cheeks or the tide slapping angrily against his chest or the vicious edge of satisfaction that appears in his belly when he realizes that Al-Haitham looks at him and sees forever, even though it’s been too many years of knowing each other and not enough days in each other’s arms.\n\n“I’ll never think of getting you flowers again,” Kaveh mutters, looking to the side, and Al-Haitham laughs, a quiet, tiny, breathy thing that makes Kaveh’s lungs seize.\n\n“You don’t have to,” Al-Haitham says simply. “I’ll see them on every page that has your name inscribed in the footnotes.”\n\nAnd god, god. Kaveh presses his fingers to his cheeks and feels them sizzle to the touch, searing hot like metal that’s spent too much time underneath the sun. God. Kaveh can’t stand Al-Haitham. He can’t get enough of this man. He wants to learn how to read the spines of books and walk cobblestone roads alone and smile at flowers in the bazaar without the name Al-Haitham ever crossing his mind.\n\nGod. Don’t remind me of how much I love you, Al-Haitham."
