        "text": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nWelcome to Shelf Life, ELLE.com’s books column, in which authors share their most memorable reads. Whether you’re on the hunt for a book to console you, move you profoundly, or make you laugh, consider a recommendation from the writers in our series, who, like you (since you’re here), love books. Perhaps one of their favorite titles will become one of yours, too.\n\nAll of Emily Giffin’s 12 novels, including her latest, The Summer Pact (Ballantine), are NYT bestsellers, and 5 have been optioned for film or TV. The film adaptation of her first novel, Something Borrowed, came out in 2011, starring Kate Hudson, Ginnifer Goodwin, and John Krasinski and produced by Hilary Swank and Black Label Media. Giffin had a cameo role in the movie and has also appeared as herself in “As the World Turns.”\n\nThe Naperville, IL-raised author practiced litigation (she attended the University of Virginia School of Law) before moving to London to write a book; has twin sons, a daughter, and two dogs, Dolly (golden retriever) and Hank (beagle mix rescue); was named for the doll in A Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett (her librarian mother named her sister after the main character, Sara); and was the editor-in-chief of her high school newspaper.\n\nFan of: the British royal family (she recently met Queen Camilla); Taylor Swift (and Travis Kelce); and Caitlin Clark.\n\nPassionate about: College sports (she managed the nationally-ranked men’s basketball team at Wake Forest); politics; photography; typefaces and fonts.\n\nDid you know: She has prosopagnosia aka facial blindness disorder, and once failed to recognize herself.\n\nGood at: Keeping secrets.\n\nBad at: Driving and directions, though she recently resumed driving on highways again after a 28-year hiatus. Ramp up your reading with her book pics below.\n\nThe book that…\n\n…I recommend over and over again:\n\nThe Tender Bar by J.R. Moehringer. A gem of a memoir by the ghostwriter of my all-time favorite biography (Open by Andre Agassi).\n\n...shaped my worldview:\n\nThe Bookseller of Kabul by Åsne Seierstad was a revelation about the plight of Afghan women and the realities of daily life in Afghanistan.\n\n...made me rethink a long-held belief:\n\nBetween the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates. The book further opened my eyes to the perils of being a Black man in America.\n\n...I read in one sitting:\n\nThe Husband’s Secret by Liane Moriarty. And then I was given the absolute honor of blurbing it.\n\n…I will pass on to my children:\n\nMy autographed copy of To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee. A 40th birthday present from my mother.\n\n...has the best title:\n\nA Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseni. Not only is the imagery incredible, but the title rolls off the tongue.\n\n...has the best opening line:\n\nInvisible Man by Ralph Ellison. I would quote it here, but I think everyone already knows it.\n\n...has the greatest ending:\n\nLove in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel GarcÍa Márquez. The reunion of Fermina and Florentino is an ode to the power of love and its ability to withstand time and overcome any obstacle.\n\n…broke my heart:\n\nMe Before You by Jojo Moyes. The ending crushed me.\n\n…features a character I love to hate:\n\nLittle Women by Louisa May Alcott. I will never forgive Amy for burning Jo’s manuscript and then marrying the love of her sister’s life.\n\n…should be on every college syllabus:\n\nMan’s Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl. It’s life-changing.\n\n...I’ve re-read the most:\n\nA Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett. My sister and I were named after the young girl in the book (Sara) and her doll (Emily).\n\n…I never returned to the library (mea culpa):\n\nMy mother was a librarian; I always returned my books.\n\n…inspired me to donate to a cause:\n\nOne Nation under Guns by Dominic Erdozain.\n\n...makes me feel seen:\n\nNora Ephon’s I Feel Bad About My Neck. Enough said.\n\nBonus questions:\n\nIf I could live in any library or bookstore in the world, it would be:\n\nThe New York Public Library.\n\nThe literary organization/charity I support:\n\nRoom to Read donates books to rural communities, transforming the lives of millions of children.\n\nThe Tender Bar by J.R. Moehringer\n\nThe Bookseller of Kabul by Åsne Seierstad\n\nBetween the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates\n\nThe Husband’s Secret by Liane Moriarty\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee\n\nA Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseni\n\nInvisible Man by Ralph Ellison\n\nLove in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel GarcÍa Márquez\n\nMe Before You by Jojo Moyes\n\nLittle Women by Louisa May Alcott\n\nMan’s Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl\n\nA Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett\n\nOne Nation Under Guns by Dominic Erdozain\n\nI Feel Bad About My Neck by Nora Ephron\n\nYou Might Also Like"
