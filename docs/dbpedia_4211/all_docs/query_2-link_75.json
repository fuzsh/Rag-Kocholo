Resentment causes them to vote for demagogues. Recently, democratically elected politicians have used crises as a pretext for dismantling democracy, following a pattern we have seen since the dawn of civilization. Why do people fall for the lure of dictatorships? And what can we learn from the cause and effects of dictatorships to understand why democracies die?\n\nDeath by a Thousand Cuts: Neuropolitics, Thymos, and the Slow Demise of Democracy is written in an accessible style with vignettes and new empirical data to provide historical context and neurological evidence on a much-discussed topic: the threat of democracy. This book will help readers who are concerned about the longevity of democracy understand when and why democracy is in danger of collapsing and alert them to the warning signs of its demise.\n\nReview Quotes\n\n\"After a long period of growth, democracies of the world are being undermined, with many facing existential crises. Combining neuroscience and political theory, Professor Qvortrup's book examines the underlying causes, and suggests ways forward to protect and rejuvenate democracy.\"\n\nProfessor Brian Schmidt, Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University, Nobel Prize of Physics (2011)\n\nAbout the Author"
