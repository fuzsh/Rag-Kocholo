        "text": "\"Should she stay or should she go? In each scenario, Frick slowly ratchets up the suspense . . . it's great fun to watch her two narratives collide and diverge.\"\n\n– The New York Times Book Review\n\n\"Double the suspense! THE SPLIT is both funhouse mirror and storytelling feat, with twin narratives that race each other to a satisfying — and shocking — conclusion.\"\n\n– Riley Sager, New York Times bestselling author of THE ONLY ONE LEFT\n\n\"In this clever domestic thriller by Kit Frick, one split decision takes two twisty paths in a crafty sliding doors plot. The characters leap from the pages and the family dysfunction feels both complex and grounded. A highly relatable and page-turning read!\"\n\n– Wendy Walker, bestselling author of WHAT REMAINS\n\n\"A knotty Sliding Doors–esque thriller about two sisters who share a dark secret. . . Frick keeps readers deliriously off-balance, tossing out just enough breadcrumbs to make the truth seem obvious only in hindsight. The format gives new life to the unreliable narrator trope. This is an exhilarating puzzle.\"\n\n– Publishers Weekly (starred review)\n\n\"Frick’s family drama uses its clever framing device to trace the very real mysteries imbedded in our oldest and most intimate relationships.\"\n\n– Elle, \"Best Mysteries and Thrillers of 2024\"\n\n\"Utterly absorbing and compulsively readable, THE SPLIT is a clever Sliding Doors-style thriller that brilliantly examines how a single decision can derail an entire life. At once an intriguing puzzle threaded with secrets and lies, and a compelling family drama exploring the complicated bonds of sisterhood, THE SPLIT is a novel you won't be able to put down -- or forget.\"\n\n– Kathleen Barber, author of Truth Be Told (adapted as an Apple TV+ series) and Follow Me\n\n\"A masterfully crafted, inventive thriller that surprises at every turn. THE SPLIT is unlike anything I've ever read before.\"\n\n– Kara Thomas, author of OUT OF THE ASHES and THAT WEEKEND\n\n\"An edge-of-your-seat suspense tale about sisters and secrets. . . . Frick leaves readers breathless.\"\n\n– Booklist\n\n\"In a taut thriller with two timelines, both are packed with clever twists. . . . Frick skillfully builds details into one plot that morph into something shockingly different in the other. The prose is streamlined, the pace headlong, and the surprises satisfying on both sides of reality.\"\n\n– Kirkus Reviews"
