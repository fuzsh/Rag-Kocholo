        "text": "The product images you see are used to better present the design. Each photo is intended to provide idea more or less about the color of the product and what the design looks like. So all images are representative. There may be slight differences between the product you receive and the product you see in the pictures.\n\nMock-up images are usually created in L size. Therefore, the dimensions of the design may differ according to the size you ordered. When creating our product designs, we take care to ensure that they are in high resolution and give a quality print result.\n\nPlease note that there may be slight color and differences between the item you see here and the item you receive. These are usually not very big differences. It is normal that there are differences in the prints made on heather and ash color. Because they absorb ink less than solid colors. In addition, the colors seen by digital screens such as computers, tablets and phones are different from the colors seen by the human eye. Please consider when placing your orders.\n\nSHIPPING & DELIVERY\n\n*All shipments are made from the USA. Our manufacturers have multiple production and storage points. Orders can be produced and shipped from any of these locations.

Therefore, the delivery date will automatically be forword to a later date. Changes will be notified to you via e-mail.\n\nIn addition, sometimes when you order more than one product, the products can be delivered separately.
