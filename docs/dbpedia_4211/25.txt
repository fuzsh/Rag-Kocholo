I just finished the Death Of 1000 Cuts writing bootcamp and I've gotta say, it was fantastic! I loved sitting down every afternoon and tuning in for 10-20 minutes and doing some exercises and writing of my own. Tim's funny, engaging and entertaining and I seriously can't recommend it enough. If you're thinking about writing a novel or a short story or whatever, I highly suggest starting it off with this Podcast series.

Tim Clare's "Death of 1000 Cuts" podcast offers writing advice, author interviews, and occasional walks in the cemetery to any aspiring or dispirited writer looking for help, motivation, or even just a bit of a laugh. With snarky (but friendly!) looks at writers' first pages, in-depth chats with other published authors on how they craft stories, and occasional rambling episodes that focus in on other things happening in the world of writing, this podcast offers something for any writerly-inclined listeners, not the least of which being a full eight-week "Couch to 80k" podcast course on how to approach writing a novel, hidden back a little way in the archives. Highly recommended to anyone after an enjoyable way to approach writing more, writing better, or tackling bigger projects - especially if they are struggling with some aspects of the process.
