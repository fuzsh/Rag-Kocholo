        "text": "While he was alive, Vincent Price was at the top of the list of famous people I wanted to meet. It never happened.\n\nVincent Price was nothing like the characters he played. He was a good man who played hiss provoking villains. Price was kind, cultured, and intelligent. He was an art collector and the author of many cookbooks. Vinnie could do it all.\n\nHe began his acting career on Broadway before moving to Hollywood. His early years as a supporting actor produced some of his finest films. He did not commit wholly to Gothic horror until the Fifties. Once he started working with Roger Corman, his career was defined by OTT characters and stories based on the work of Edgar Allen Poe. It was one of the most artistically and commercially successful periods of his acting career.\n\nI’m a Vincent Price fan, not an expert on his life. Please be kind if I’m wrong about any details. It’s what Vinnie would want. I often call him that. Price feels more like a friend than someone whose movies I dig. I always root for him even when he plays a homicidal maniac. Why? He’s Vinnie, that’s why.\n\nThe films are rated in order of preference. I started off with 25 before winnowing out such fine films as The Fly and The House Of The Seven Gables. Vinnie did a lot of good movies and I wanted to give equal time to his earlier work as well as his scary movies. I hope I succeeded.\n\nOn with the show this is it.\n\nLaura is one of the best films of its era. Price plays Gene Tierney’s smarmy boyfriend, which makes him a suspect in her disappearance. He’s utterly convincing as this creepy character. It’s the first of three Price-Tierney collaborations that top this list.\n\nVincent Price isn’t the villain in Leave Her To Heaven, Gene Tierney is. One could even call her character a Beastly Beauty. In addition to playing Tierney’s ex, Price was on the right side of the law for once: His character is a prosecutor.\n\nDragonwyck is a period piece set in a creepy Gothic house but is not a horror film per se. Vinnie is outstanding as an aristocrat who goes insane as the movie progresses. It’s one of the most underrated films on the list.\n\nHouse Of Wax was one of Price’s earliest horror flicks. I’ve never seen it in 3-D, which is okay. I hate the process, but I love this movie. It’s both housey and waxy whatever the hell that means…\n\nI wrote about House Of Usher on Halloween. I stand by that post.\n\nThe poster for The Baron Of Arizona makes it look like a horror flick. It is not. It’s a quirky kinda sorta Western written and directed by the great Samuel Fuller. As always, Price is outstanding as the title character.\n\nThe Bat is more of a mystery than a horror movie. There is a creepy house but no spooks. Agnes Moorehead plays a mystery writer, not a witch. She’s swell as is Vinnie.\n\nHouse On Haunted Hill is one of the ultimate haunted house movies. As the host, Price proves that you can’t keep a good ghoul down.\n\nThe Masque of The Red Death is considered by many to be the finest Corman-Poe movie. I’m an Usher guy myself but I love this quad poster. It’s red and masky…\n\nThe Pit and the Pendulum is Stephen King’s favorite movie of the Poe 8. I hate to disagree with the Master, but unless he threatens to strap me to the pendulum table, I’m sticking to my guns.\n\nI wrote about The Raven on October 26. I stand by that post: It’s a funny movie with an amazing cast. I was, however, worried that the cast would consume the black bird along with the scenery. In a word: hammy.\n\nThe Abominable Dr. Phibes is outlandish, ridiculous, and way over the top. It’s more entertaining than a ferret down your trousers but not as dangerous.\n\nHonorable Mention: Tim Burton is a huge Vincent Price fan, so he created a part for Vinnie in Edward Scissorhands. The part had to be scaled back because Price was ill. His emphysema was out of control after a lifetime of heavy smoking. It led to his death in 1993. RIP.\n\nHere’s a quick and dirty list of the movies:\n\nLaura\n\nLeave Her To Heaven\n\nDragonwyck\n\nHouse Of Wax\n\nHouse Of Usher\n\nThe Baron Of Arizona\n\nThe Bat\n\nHouse On Haunted Hill\n\nMasque of The Red Death\n\nPit and the Pendulum\n\nThe Raven\n\nThe Abominable Dr. Phibes\n\nThat’s all for now. The last word goes to Vinnie and a gang of ghouls in a PR picture for House Of Usher:"
