Sometimes, you can still catch me dancing in it.”\n\nJohnny Depp and Winona Ryder make all kinds of movie magic in Tim Burton’s holiday classic EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. This beloved fantasy-fable about an “uncommonly gentle man” marks the first collaboration between Depp and Burton, whose beautifully gothic (if not weirdly humorous) aesthetic is put to good use here. EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is a modern fairytale for movie-lovers of all ages, a sweet and charming story about a gentle young man sporting scissors for hands. It also marks the final film performance from iconic character actor Vincent Price. With Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall, Kathy Baker, and Alan Arkin.\n\n“Burton’s richly entertaining update of the Frankenstein story is the year’s most comic, romantic and haunting film fantasy.” (Rolling Stone)\n\n“Burton’s modern fairytale has an almost palpably personal feel: it is told gently, subtly and with infinite sympathy for an outsider who charms the locals but then inadvertently arouses their baser instincts.” (Daily Telegraph)\n\nTuesday, December 20\n\nMovie 7:45 pm *Apx. start time (triple feature!).
