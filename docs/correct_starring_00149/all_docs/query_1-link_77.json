        "text": "When Peg finds Edward in the mansion, he has been living there alone since his inventor passed the previous winter, if not earlier. None of the townspeople appear to acknowledge his existence, but gossip travels quickly in the community. This means that after Edward saw his creator die in front of him, he didn't call an ambulance or a morgue to get rid of the body (dialing the phone would have been tough).\n\nInstead, Edward likely let his creator decompose in the mansion while he puttered around on the property.\n\nOne of the film's mysteries is why Edward has scissors for hands. One flashback shows his creator, played by Vincent Price, replacing Edward's parts piece by piece, with his hands being the last body parts to go.\n\nThe inventor presents him with the perfect hands on Christmas, but in a cruel twist, he has a heart attack and falls forward. As he slumps, Edward's scissors impale the hands and destroy the final gift he might have received from the closest thing he has to a father.\n\nWhen Joyce gets her hair cut by Edward, she describes it as \"the single most thrilling experience\" of her life. As Edward slices through her hair, she cries with delight, possibly revealing a secret fascination with the limits of existence or pain.\n\nWith every snip, she almost catches a scissor to the face, and that's what she appears to like.\n\nOne of the more unsettling aspects of the film is how Peg's housewife friends start swooning over Edward. From the moment he shows up, they find him titillating because he is different. They invite themselves over and inquire about his life.\n\nJoyce is especially bold, as she tries to start a business with Edward as well as seduce him.\n\nThough Peg genuinely cares for Edward, her neighbors see him as nothing more than a tool that can cut lettuce, trim hedges, make shish kebabs, and groom dogs. Edward may have scissors for hands, but he's still a person.\n\nThe darkest part of this is that all along, his creator might have intended for him to be a tool.\n\nOne of the most disturbing parts in Edward Scissorhands is that the inventor decides to give his living creation scissors for hands. Sure, it looks cool, but he basically forces Edward to be an outsider from the beginning.\n\nWhen he ultimately makes real hands for Edward, it's tragically too late."
