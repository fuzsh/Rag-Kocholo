        "text": "Vincent Leonard Price Jr. (May 27, 1911 - October 25, 1993) was an American actor. Price provided the narration for the short Vincent and portrayed Himself in Hansel and Gretel and The Inventor in Edward Scissorhands.\n\nPrice was best known for his work in scary films, people nicknamed the King of Horror. Offscreen Price was considered a workaholic, which his daughter joking remarked, \"We used to drop him off at the airport so often it was like he worked there.\" However he was considered by his friends and family to have an incredibly big heart and was a wonderful husband and father. Next to Michael Jackson, Price considered Tim to be one of the two people to introduce him to the next generation. Aside from the movies, Price was passionate about the visual arts as well as the Native American Arts.\n\nBiography[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nBurton considered Price his idol, and a source of constant inspiration.\n\nBurton was working on a documentary about Price around the time of his death called Conversations with Vincent. The film was shelved and remains unreleased.\n\nReferences[]"
