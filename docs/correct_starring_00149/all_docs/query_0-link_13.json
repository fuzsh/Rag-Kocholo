Starring Vincent Price, the plot follows Dr. Robert Morgan (Price) who lives in a world where the human population is infected by a plague that has turned them into undead, vampiric creatures that cannot stand sunlight, fear mirrors, and are repelled by garlic. Every day, Morgan follows a routine where he marks days off the calender and sets out to hunt the vampires, killing as many as he can and then burning the bodies.\n\nAfter working together on the successful release of the official soundtracks to Zombie’s films House of 1000 Corpses, The Devils Rejects, 3 From Hell, The Lords of Salem, Halloween 1 & 2, and The Munsters, Zombie explored other ways to collaborate with Waxwork in an effort to unearth, re-master, and release classic, left-of-center Horror soundtracks from films that he is a life-long fan of.

Romero’s DAWN OF THE DEAD Original Theatrical Soundtrack. This expansive three LP set features the complete De Wolfe library cues from Romero’s 1978 cut of the zombie classic for the first time on vinyl. This special release of the iconic Dawn Of The Dead soundtrack features the U.S. theatrical soundtrack, including “Cause I’m A Man” by the British band Pretty Things, as well as fan favorite “The Gonk” by composer Herbert Chappell.\n\nDawn Of The Dead (also known internationally as Zombi) was written by Romero in collaboration with Italian filmmaker, Dario Argento. It is the second film of Romero’s Living Dead Trilogy, and shows in a larger scale the apocalyptic effects of the dead returning to life, and seeking human victims.\n\nGeorge A. Romero’s Dawn Of The Dead is considered to be one of the greatest and most compelling zombie films ever made by blending horror, gore, and social commentary on material society. Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and called it “one of the best horror films ever made.” The film was selected as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time by Empire Magazine in 2008. It was also named as one of The Best 1000 Movies Ever Made, a list published by The New York Times.\n\nWaxwork Records is proud to release George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD Original Theatrical Soundtrack loaded with features including 3xLP colored vinyl, deluxe heavyweight triple gatefold packaging with matte satin coating, artwork by Ruiz Burgos, a four page booklet, and extensive liner notes by Living Dead film music archivist and historian Jim Cirronella.\n\nDAWN OF THE DEAD Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Features:\n\nThe Complete De Wolfe Library Cues from the 1978 Theatrical Release\n\nFirst Time On Vinyl\n\n3xLP Retro Colored Vinyl\n\nArtwork by Ruiz Burgos\n\nExclusive Liner Notes\n\nHeavyweight Gatefold Jackets with Matte Satin Coating\n\nFour Page Booklet\n\n*This release is a pre-order with an expected shipping date of Q4, 2024*\n\nIn partnership with Milan Records, Waxwork Records is proud to release KINDS OF KINDNESS (ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE SOUNDTRACK) with music by multi-instrumentalist, producer, and Oscar®-nominated composer JERSKIN FENDRIX. The album reunites Fendrix with director Yorgos Lanthimos following the breakout success of Poor Things, which earned the first-time composer an Oscar® nomination and marked Lanthimos’ first-ever collaboration with a composer. For Kinds of Kindness, Fendrix has crafted a soundscape rooted in solo piano and choral music, peppering the 22-track collection with hymnals throughout. Rounding out the soundtrack album are pop tracks like Cobrah’s “Brand New Bitch” and Eurythmics’ “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This),” both of which were featured in the film’s trailers, plus a cover of “How Deep Is Your Love” by film star Margaret Qualley as well as a demo from Fendrix’s personal discography. Searchlight Pictures’ Kinds of Kindness is available in theaters now.\n\nSimilar to Poor Things, Fendrix began working on Kinds of Kindness with relatively few materials, utilizing only the film’s script, black and white photographs from set, and conversations with Lanthimos as a guide. This time around, however, Lanthimos provided Fendrix with specific guidance on instrumentation, instructing the composer to craft a soundscape rooted in piano and choral music.\n\n“I love working with Jerskin, and I guess he’s the reason why I am now working with a composer – I’ve found someone that works for me,” says director Yorgos Lanthimos, continuing, “Jerskin worked on this in the same way he worked on Poor Things, which is before even seeing a frame of the film. I gave him the script and started sending him black and white pictures that I shot on set. Our agreement in the beginning was, ‘This time, I want to use piano and choir, and go down that direction,’ which was very different to Poor Things. When I went into the edit, he had this library of music that he created to work with, and it turned out great.”\n\nAlso helpful to Fendrix at the start of the project was a conversation with Kinds of Kindness star Jesse Plemons, who helped the composer wrap his mind around the complexity of Lanthimos’ triptych story.\n\n“I was very lucky to go on set at the very beginning of filming, and I asked Jesse about the emotions because I was struggling to understand where so many of these characters were coming from,” composer Jerskin Fendrix confesses. “He spoke to me about his interpretation, and how he planned to embody his characters, which was great. I ended up thinking about the abstract space between the emotions and whether that space was empty or noisy. From there, I utilized the piano and choir to explore those spaces.”\n\nWaxwork Records is thrilled to release KINDS OF KINDNESS as a picture disc featuring artwork and design by Vasilis Marmatakis housed in a crystal clear poly-bag.\n\nABOUT KINDS OF KINDNESS\n\nKINDS OF KINDNESS is a triptych fable, following a man without choice who tries to take control of his own life; a policeman who is alarmed that his wife who was missing-at-sea has returned and seems a different person; and a woman determined to find a specific someone with a special ability, who is destined to become a prodigious spiritual leader.\n\nTRACKLISTING:\n\nSide A\n\nThe Death of R.M.F.\n\nSweet Dreams (Are Made of This) – Eurythmics, Annie Lennox, Dave Stewart**\n\nHotel Cheval\n\nHymn – Matia Ponos Stoma Fthonos 1\n\nHow Deep Is Your Love – Margaret Qualley**\n\nR.M.F.
