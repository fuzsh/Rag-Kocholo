        "text": "Vincent Price is widely regarded as one of the most iconic and beloved horror movie actors in the world. Any fan of classic horror movies knows the name Vincent Price as synonymous with elegance, humor, talent, worldliness, and charm. Throughout his over 60-year movie career, appearing in countless classic horror movies, as well as classic films outside the horror genre, Price established himself as one of the most popular actors--beloved among both his fans and his peers.\n\nPrice's remarkable career began on Broadway opposite Helen Hayes and ended in Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands with Johnny Depp, featuring appearances in such film noir classics such Laura and popular television series as Batman and The Brady Bunch. Vincent Price's erudite and eclectic personal interests in art, cooking, travel, and writing not only made him unique among horror movie actors, but also informed his acting choices in classic horror movies as House of Wax, Pit and the Pendulum, and the other popular Roger Corman classics based on the works of Edgar Allen Poe.\n\nThis website, created and maintained by the Vincent Price family, is dedicated to preserving and promoting the legacy of this horror movie actor for classic horror movie fans by sharing the many facets of one of the most fascinating men of the 20th century. Price was immensely proud of his contributions to the arts in the United States, and the Vincent Price Art Museum at East Los Angeles College remains one of his great contributions outside classic horror movies.\n\nAdditionally, the iconic cookbook, A Treasury of Great Recipes, written by Vincent Price with his second wife, Mary Grant, is recognized throughout the world as a culinary classic. More than just a horror movie actor personifying the elegant side of evil, Vincent Price truly was a Renaissance man whose contributions to the arts ensure a lasting legacy."
