        "text": "I know that it's a ways past Christmas now, but you can recapture the best of the Christmas spirit by seeing Edward Scissorhands. It's a practically perfect seasonal movie for the '90's—sentimental, yet saucy; off-beat yet completely endearing. If you missed it before Christmas, see it now and start the new year off right.\n\nThe story of a salad-making machine turned innocent artist and not-quite-proper young man, Edward is unusual enough to fit in nicely with director Burton's earlier movies-—Beetlejuice and Batman. And it's entertaining and well-made enough to stand with them, too.\n\nDepp, as the title character, turns in an amazing performance. He's a modern tin man who suffers, perhaps, from too much heart, rather than not enough. His supporting cast, playing characters as mundane as he is bizarre, are equally good. Wiest and Arkin, especially, as the couple who take Edward in, are terrific; reacting to the strange upheavals in their lives with down-to-earth decency and calm.\n\nAlong with the appealing performances, Danny Elfman's music helps turn this very peculiar story into a fairy tale of universal charm. His work for Burton's other movies is outstanding, but he's outdone himself here. Edward Scissorhands probably wouldn't be as enchanting as it is without the hauntingly romantic score.\n\nJanuary 16, 1991"
