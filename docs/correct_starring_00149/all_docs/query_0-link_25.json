Portrayed by the legendary Vincent Price, this release would see the first time the horror icon would be translated into figural format.\n\nHe stands nine inches tall and was sculpted in Mezco's signature caricatured stylization, boldly full of personality and eerily capturing his likeness perfectly.\n\nThe Professor was packaged in an eye-catching domed blister with a backer card recreating the film's classic movie poster and he included the gift box and arms created for Edward in the film's dream sequence as accessories.\n\nEven though eleven years have passed since this limited edition exclusive figure saw it's release, it remains as timeless as the actor who depicted the character and the film it was all based on."
