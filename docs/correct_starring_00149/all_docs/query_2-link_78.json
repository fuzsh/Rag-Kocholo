        "text": "[He] was based on a feeling of touching and communication, and I, I, I've gotten better at all that, but if you're lonely, you can grow up and have 20 million friends and be Mr Touchy-Feely, but you still have that feeling because it doesn't leave you. So I think it's those things you think you're exorcising, but you don't, really. Some feelings never leave you.\n\nTim told me about a character he had who had scissors instead of hands and I said, 'Stop right there. I know exactly what to do with that,' and went home. At that time, I was more of a prose writer than a screenwriter. I had published a novel that was this weird little suburban Frankenstein story and knew that (Edward Scissorhands) was my next weird suburban Frankenstein story.\n\nSome things come straight into your head and this one came straight into mine. Within three weeks, I had written a 70-plus page prose version for Tim to read.\n\n[Cruise] wanted to know how Edward went to the bathroom. He was asking the kind of questions about the character that canâ€™t be asked for this character! Part of the delicacy of the story was not answering questions like, 'How does he go to the bathroom? How did he live without eating all those years?'\n\nTom Cruise was certainly unwilling to be in the movie without those questions being answered.\n\nWe had a couple of people that were holding out, saying, 'I want more money!' so right up to the last day there were a couple of houses that didn't go along with the plan. One or two days before, the two houses figured they weren't getting any money, so they [caved] and we had to rush out and paint the houses and put in the bushes."
