Edward Scissorhands is a 1990 American fantasy romance film directed by Tim Burton. It was produced by Burton and Denise Di Novi, written by Caroline Thompson from a story by her and Burton, and starring Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Anthony Michael Hall, Dianne Wiest, Kathy Baker, Alan Arkin, and Vincent Price. It tells the story of an unfinished artificial humanoid who has scissor blades instead of hands that is taken in by a suburban family and falls in love with their teenage daughter.

Burton conceived Edward Scissorhands from his childhood upbringing in suburban Burbank, California. During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Caroline Thompson was hired to adapt Burton's story into a screenplay, and the film began development at 20th Century Fox after Warner Bros. declined. Edward Scissorhands was then fast tracked after Burton's critical and financial success with Batman. The film also marks the fourth collaboration between Burton and film score composer Danny Elfman, and was Vincent Price's last major role.

Edward Scissorhands was released to a positive reception from critics and was a financial success, grossing over four times its $20 million budget. The film received numerous nominations at the Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, and the Saturn Awards, as well as winning the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Both Burton and Elfman consider Edward Scissorhands their most personal and favorite work.

Storyline[]

Plot[]

A scientist (Vincent Price) builds an animated human being -- the gentle Edward (Johnny Depp). The scientist dies before he can finish assembling Edward, though, leaving the young man with a freakish appearance accentuated by the scissor blades he has instead of hands. Loving suburban saleswoman Peg (Dianne Wiest) discovers Edward and takes him home, where he falls for Peg's teen daughter (Winona Ryder). However, despite his kindness and artistic talent, Edward's hands make him an outcast.

Reception[]

Box office[]

Test screenings for the film were encouraging for 20th Century Fox. Joe Roth, then president of the company, considered marketing Edward Scissorhands on the scale of "an E.T.-sized blockbuster," but Roth decided not to aggressively promote the film in that direction. "We have to let it find its place. We want to be careful not to hype the movie out of the universe," he reasoned. Edward Scissorhands had its limited release in the United States on December 7, 1990. The wide release came on December 14, and the film earned $6,325,249 in its opening weekend in 1,372 theaters. Edward Scissorhands eventually grossed $56,362,352 in North America, and a further $29,661,653 outside North America, coming to a worldwide total of $86.02 million. With a budget of $20 million, the film is considered a box office success. The New York Times wrote "the chemistry between Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder, who were together in real life at the time (1989–1993), gave the film teen idol potential, drawing younger audiences."

Critical response[]

The film has a 7.9 rating on IMDb and a 89% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Trivia[]

Macaulay Culkin was considered for the role of Kevin Boggs after Tim Burton had seen him in Uncle Buck (1989). But he was unavailable as he was doing Home Alone (1990).

One of two films released in 1990 in which Johnny Depp plays the title role, for the first time. The other is Cry-Baby (1990).

Wil Wheaton was considered for the role of Jim, but was contractually obligated to Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987).

Winona Ryder starred in three films in 1990. "Edward Scissorhands" and Mermaids (1990), which were released on the same day, December 14, 1990. Ryder was also the star of Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael (1990) which was released two months earlier.

At one point, Stan Winston had to leave production for one day to direct the teaser trailer for Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991).

Winona Ryder and Conchata Ferrell appeared in Mr. Deeds (2002).

Although theatrically released in the U.S. during Christmas 1990, Twentieth Century Fox decided to hold back the release of this film elsewhere and stagger the worldwide release between Easter 1991 and Summer 1991 in order to maximize screen availability in other countries. This meant that by the time it was showing in some European and UK movie theaters it had already been released on video rental in the US.
