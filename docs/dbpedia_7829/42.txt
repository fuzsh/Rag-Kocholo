Cheryl Cole has officially changed her name to Cheryl Fernandez-Versini.

The singer recently married her partner Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini in a shock ceremony that she announced on Instagram.

A spokesperson for the X Factor judge confirmed her new moniker to MailOnline.

It was reported that Fernandez-Versini would be changing her name and dropping 'Cole' after changing her Twitter name to just 'Cheryl' yesterday (July 14). It has also been alleged that she would like to be introduced as Cheryl Fernandez-Versini on The X Factor.

A source told Digital Spy that her X Factor colleagues believed that her wedding was a prank.

They said: "Everyone thought it was a prank when we saw it in the paper. It truly was the best-kept secret in showbiz.

"Jean-Bernard has come down to auditions before and he's a very nice guy. We're very happy for Cheryl, and we're sure the judges will be sending out flowers and planning something fun for the arena auditions."
