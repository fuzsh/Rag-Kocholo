Cheryl Fernandez-Versini is dropping her last name. The 'Crazy Stupid Love' hitmaker - who has split from estranged husband Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini - is keen to just be known as 'Cheryl' for the foreseeable future and has booked her first engagement, the Global Gift Gala in Paris, France in May, in that name. A source told the Daily Mirror newspaper: "Cheryl wants to wipe the slate clean and start afresh with a new name, now the divorce is going through. Things turned pretty nasty over the weekend, with both Cheryl and JB making comments on social media, so from hereon in, she will just be known as Cheryl. "Her last album in 2014 was released under the name 'Cheryl', too, but everyone still called her by her new married name. This time around, everyone is under strict instructions that she is just Cheryl, nothing else. Organisers at next month's event were told that all announcements of Cheryl's attendance should only refer to her as Cheryl." Meanwhile, the 32-year-old singer - who is now dating One Direction star Liam Payne - is reportedly "desperate" to divorce Jean-Bernard. An insider shared previously: "There was absolutely no overlap with Cheryl and Liam. Cheryl and JB broke up in August and that's when he moved out. They both agreed to go to Ant and Dec's party as friends so that they could bat away the attention. Cheryl is the one that wanted a divorce and she is desperate for it to go ahead."
