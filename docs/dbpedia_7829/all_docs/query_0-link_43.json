        "text": "David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock\n\nWho cares about all of the flashing lights and photographers yelling their names? Liam Payne and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini are focused on each other.\n\nThe new couple made things officially official Monday night when they stepped out and made their red carpet debut as a couple.\n\nPayne and his ladylove, 32, posed for pictures on the red carpet ahead of Eva Longoria's Global Gift Gala, and these two couldn't keep their eyes off of each other! The One Direction hunk and former X Factor judge were absolutely smitten with one another, flashing their beaming smiles and holding each other close while displaying their love for the cameras.\n\nThese Brit stars may be newly linked in a romantic way, but it turns out that they've actually known each other for quite some time.\n\nFernandez-Versini first met the boy bander when he auditioned for The X Factor at age 14 and then saw him again at age 16 when he tried out in 2010, which led to the formation of 1D.\n\nLess than two months after E! News confirmed that that the pair are dating, Simon Cowell spoke out about the couple and expressing his approval of the pairing. \"I saw them together and we had a really nice dinner. They were on good form,\" Simon shared with The Sun. \"They're like two little chipmunks madly in love. Literally, they were so cute.\"\n\nHe continued, \"But importantly they both seemed very happy over here and very relaxed. I'm happy for them.\""
