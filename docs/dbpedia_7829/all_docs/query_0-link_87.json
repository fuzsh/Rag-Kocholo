        "text": "The artist formerly known as Cheryl Cole has confirmed that she has quit The X Factor to focus on her music career.\n\nIn a statement Chezza said \"I have had such an amazing experience being a judge on The X Factor. I have learnt so much and enjoyed nurturing talent but I've missed making music and am excited to be recording again.\n\n\"I want to thank everybody I have worked with along the way, especially Simon who I love to bits. I hope the show continues to produce stars and I wish them all the best.\"\n\nYou know what, as sad as we are that we won't have a weekly frock-off between Cheryl and fellow judge Rita Ora, we're really happy for her.\n\nOnly this week her old boss Simon Cowell described how \"madly in love\" Cheryl is with her new man Liam Payne, so it seems she's in a really good place.\n\nAnd we FULLY appreciate the need to free up some time to spend with Liam. That beautiful face won't kiss itself.\n\nAnd Simon has taken the news that Cheryl won't be returning extremely well. He had nothing but kind words for the singer, saying: \"Cheryl and myself spoke about this. I totally understand her commitment to making more records.\n\n\"She has been amazing on the show and in the near future we will be working on other things together.\"\n\nWe can't imagine our boss being that happy if we quit after just a year, but there you are.\n\nCheryl, 32, first joined The X Factor way back in 2008. Since then she has mentored two singers to victory - Alexandra Burke in 2008 and Joe McElderry (oh Joe, lovely Joe) in 2009.\n\nShe left the show in 2010 to appear on the US version of the show, but she was, erm, swiftly 'let go' by Simon Cowell who later admitted he felt something was \"not quite right.\" Cheryl then rejoined as a judge on the UK show last year.\n\nSo is this really the end of Cheryl and The X Factor? Well, she's come back once, so stranger things have happened..."
