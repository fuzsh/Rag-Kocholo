        "text": "IT WAS the romance that caused a media storm - when X Factor judge Cheryl started a relationship with One Direction hunk Liam Payne.\n\nDuring their high profile romance, their age difference raised questions from fans, right up until the couple decided to part ways.\n\nHow long were Cheryl and Liam dating and what's their age gap?\n\nThe pair first met when a young wannabe popstar Liam Payne auditioned on The X Factor back in 2009, where Cheryl was on the judging panel.\n\nHe then went on to mega-stardom thanks to his time in One Direction.\n\nThe pair - who have a ten year age gap - got together while Cheryl was going through her divorce to second husband Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini at the beginning of 2016.\n\nDespite their age difference they looked completely infatuated with each other when the couple made their red carpet debut at Cannes in May 2016.\n\nLiam even paid a sweet tribute to his girlfriend by getting a tattoo of her eye on his arm.\n\nWhen was Cheryl and Liam's baby born?\n\nThe pair welcomed their baby on March 22, 2017.\n\nCheryl posted a picture on Instagram of Liam cradling their 7lb 9oz baby.\n\nShe captioned the sweet snap with: “On Wednesday Liam and I became parents to an incredibly beautiful, healthy baby boy looking like a dream.”\n\nOne pal told The Sun: “Cheryl gave birth to a baby boy on Wednesday, and both are doing well.\n\n“Liam didn’t leave Cheryl’s side throughout the birth, and like her, he is besotted with their new son and can’t wait to take him home.\n\n“This is the perfect Mother’s Day for Cheryl.”\n\nWhat did Cheryl and Liam Payne call their baby boy?\n\nThe Sun revealed in May 2017, that the couple named their son Bear.\n\nThey decided on the unusual name after spending a week getting to know him.\n\nBear adopted his One Direction star dad’s surname, so he is called Bear Payne.\n\nA source revealed: “Cheryl and Liam wanted to get to know [their son] before they decided on the name.\n\n“They didn’t have the name Bear before the birth.\n\n“But they’d been thinking of a name since meeting him and they just felt it suited him.\"\n\nWhen did Cheryl and Liam split and what happened?\n\nIn February 2018, The Sun broke the story that Liam's constant travelling to promote his solo career had placed a huge strain on the relationship, and they were ready to split.\n\nThat same month, Cheryl declared that \"none of it matters\" as she shrugged off questions about her crumbling romance with Liam during a BBC Breakfast interview.\n\nThey then put on a united front together at the Brit Awards, where they smiled on the red carpet and Cheryl joked about the couple's 'safe word'.\n\nHowever, by July 2018, Cheryl and Liam made the decision to split.\n\nA pal told The Sun: “Cheryl and Liam worked really hard on their relationship – they had troubles earlier this year and were able to get through them.\n\n“But they’re in different stages of their lives and, after a lot of careful thought, came to a decision that it’s best for everyone if they do go their separate ways.\"\n\nLiam and Cheryl then released a statement confirming their break-up.\n\nThey posted a message on social media that read: \"We are sad to announce that we are going our separate ways. It's been a tough decision for us to make.\n\n“We still have so much love for each other as a family. Bear is our world and we ask that you respect his privacy as we navigate our way through this together.\""
