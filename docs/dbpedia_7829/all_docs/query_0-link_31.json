Clearly smitten, the loved-up pair got married in 2016, penning a six-figure magazine deal at the time.\n\n3 of 12\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Getty Images\n\n2004-2010: Ashley Cole\n\nHowever, things started to turn sour for the 'golden couple' when Ashley was accused of 'cheating' on Cheryl just months after their wedding. Despite forgiving the footballer, Ashley continued with his ways, with allegations that he'd been unfaithful rocking their romance yet again. Everything got too much for Chez in 2010, when she filed for divorce from Ashley.\n\n4 of 12\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 ITV\n\n2010-2011: Derek Hough\n\nCheryl first met professional dancer Derek Hough whilst the pair filmed the music video for her hit track 'Parachute', and it seems they immediately hit it off. The former X Factor judge contracted Malaria in 2010, and she later told Piers Morgan, \"I owe my life to Derek... if it wasn't for him I'd be dead.\"\n\n5 of 12\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Getty Images\n\n2010-2011: Derek Hough\n\nDespite this, it seems the pair were destined to just be friends, with Derek later revealing to the media, \"We dated for a while. Absolutely we are still friends, we are still very close.\"\n\n6 of 12\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Getty Images\n\n2012-2013: Tre Holloway\n\nIt seems Cheryl had quite a thing for professional dancers, as her next boyfriend was the super handsome Tre Holloway. Despite first meeting each other on The X Factor in 2010, the pair didn't grow close until 2012, with Cheryl enlisting Tre's dancing skills for her 'Ghetto Baby' music video.\n\n7 of 12\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 ITV\n\n2012-2013: Tre Holloway\n\nThings seemed to be getting serious between the two, especially when Tre starred in Cheryl's ITV2 documentary. However, the long-distance relationship didn't work out, with the couple calling it quits in 2013. Speaking at the time, Tre said, \"She's an amazing person, an amazing woman, and we are good friends.\"\n\n8 of 12\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Getty Images\n\n2014-2016: Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini\n\nIt looked like Cheryl had found 'the one' when she met French businessman Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini in 2014. Only three months into their romance, Cheryl shocked her fans by announcing she'd married JB, in a secret beach location with her close family and friends.\n\n9 of 12\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Getty Images\n\n2014-2016: Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini\n\nAfter her second marriage, rumours of tension between Cheryl and JB started to arise, with the couple being pictured looking glum on more than one occasion. 18 months after their whirlwind wedding, Cheryl and JB were granted a quickie divorce in October 2018.\n\n10 of 12\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Instagram\n\n2016-2018: Liam Payne\n\nShortly after Cheryl divorced JB, she singer shocked the showbiz world in 2016, when she confirmed she was dating One Direction singer Liam Payne.
