        "text": "Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has given her fans a treat for the ears by serving up the title track from her new album, Only Human, as a preview song.\n\nThe singer and X Factor judge released the number to those who pre-ordered her album, which is scheduled for release on 10 November. But thanks to the internet, you can hear it here:\n\nShe said of her fourth studio album that it’s the best work she’s ever put out, explaining: “I feel, for me, it’s my best work for many reasons.\n\n“Looking back on everything that I’ve experienced personally, I think Only Human is a record that says, ‘Have fun, we’re only human, fight on when things go bad 'cos it’s going to be fine again’.”\n\nCheryl added: “I’m proof of that and for people who have seen things I might have been through, they will know how much this means to me.”\n\nThe 31-year-old former Girls Aloud star also posted the track listing for her new LP on Instagram, with her first single from the record – _Crazy Stupid Lov_e – sitting at number four.\n\nOther tracks include Live Life Now, It’s About Time, Throwback, Stars, I Won’t Break and – incredibly – Tattoo, which HAS to be about her floral butt tatt, right?\n\nWith Only Human set for release about five weeks before the end of The X Factor, we could have another Alexandra Burke sitch on our hands, especially if Cheryl’s offering outperforms whoever goes on to win the talent series. WE CAN’T WAIT.\n\nGALLERY: Cheryl Cole's 10 best looks EVER\n\nFor more information about fund raising and for your chance to help out Cancer Research UK, fill out this short form below or head to www.standuptocancer.org.uk"
