        "text": "If she'd married someone with less than thirty thousand syllables in their name we might have found it a bit easier to get to grips with Cheryl Cole's new married name, but somehow Cheryl Fernandez-Versini just didn't have quite the same ring to it, did it?\n\nLuckily for us and our love of short, easy-to-type names, Chezza has decided that she'll be ditching her new surname for work and sticking to just 'Cheryl' for now, as people have been having trouble pronouncing the new one.\n\nAccording to reports, Cheryl's a bit miffed that fans haven't quite taken to her EXTREMELY LONG exotic surname, and rather than spelling it out every time she's on the phone to someone ('Fuhnandez Vussini, pet. Haway man it's not that hard'), she's decided to just cut her losses.\n\nShe told The Sunday People: \"It's just Cheryl because everyone seems to be having a hard time saying it.\"\n\nBack when the news broke of her secret wedding to hubbie Jean-Bernard, an official spokesperson confirmed that while she'd taken his surname, she'd be keeping it simple for us mortals: \"Cheryl's full name is Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, professionally she will be Cheryl.\"\n\nIf you were a fan of the posh sign-off, you can just blame Louis Walsh for the change, as he's admitted that he was having so much trouble getting his tongue around the double barrelled name that he had to ask Jean-Bernard for a bit of help.\n\n\"He seems to be a really nice guy and he's given me French lessons\", Louis confessed."
