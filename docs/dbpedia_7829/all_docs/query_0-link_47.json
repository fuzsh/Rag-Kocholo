        "text": "The artist formerly known as Cheryl Cole and now probably just 'Cheryl' has just given birth to her first child, with One Direction star Liam Payne, and has made her return to her former home of The X Factor. With that in mind, it's never been more appropriate to take a look back at her life story.\n\nWhether its pop music, talent shows, near-death experiences or unfortunate tattoos, Cheryl's had a life full of strange twists and turns -- perpetually trailed by a legion of baying tabloids. Here are just some of the highlights, accompanied by many of her most notable quotes over the years.\n\n\"I used to absolutely love walking to the corner shop near my mam's house in my pyjamas, to get a pint of milk for breakfast — or going to Mrs. Clough's for sweets\"\n\nCheryl Tweedy was born in Newcastle in 1983, growing up on a council estate with her parents and four siblings. She was a somewhat successful baby model, appearing in adverts for British Gas and winning various local pageants. She also attended The Royal Ballet's summer school at the age of 9, as a result of her love of dance.\n\n\"I wouldn't be happy doing anything else\"\n\nAuditioning with an S Club 7 track, Cheryl unanimously impressed judges Geri Halliwell, Louis Walsh and Pete Waterman. \"You have the most beautiful eyes and skin I think I've ever seen in my life,\" Waterman said. She was one of ten girls that made it to the live finals, and narrowly won her spot in the resulting girlband, named Girls Aloud.\n\n\"It's the sound of the underground / The beat of the drum goes round and round /Into the overflow /Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio\"\n\nGirls Aloud's rock-edged debut single, Sound of the Underground, rocketed to Christmas #1, their rival boyband One True Voice quickly flatlining. Their debut album was also a hit, spawning three successful singles and a cover of The Pointer Sisters' Jump for the Love Actually soundtrack.\n\n\"Jennifer Aniston was doing something called the Atkins Diet and I thought I'd give it a try. I remember I ate chicken in cream sauce with a couple of carrots every night for weeks, and I just felt horrible. But I was on this mission\"\n\nWith instant fame came instant body image issues, with Cheryl becoming distracted by her weight. \"I remember being in Selfridges and taking these size 28s into the changing room and not being able to get them on,\" she has said. \"Then getting on the scales and crying because I was nine and a half stone.\"\n\n\"I was shocked. I don't care how many number ones she's had, if she was nobody, she shouldn't have said those things to me or hit me.\" (Sophie Amogbokpa)\n\nIn January 2003, Cheryl was charged with racially-aggravated assault in an incident in a nightclub bathroom. Toilet attendant Sophie Amogbokpa alleged that Cheryl punched her in the face and called her a \"black b****\". At trial in October, Cheryl was cleared of racial assault, but found guilty of violent assault. She was ordered to pay the victim £500.\n\nCheryl has insisted that Amogbokpa initiated the incident. \"Completely out of nowhere, I was hit in the face. I swear on my mother's life that's what happened. It was the toilet attendant who had hit me, and in confusion and self-defence I hit her back instinctively.'\n\n\"50 Cent! I wouldn't mind breeding a whole football team with him. But I'd be just as happy with a builder or postie, so long as he was a Geordie.\"\n\nThe members of Girls Aloud were quickly becoming major British celebrities, famed for their outspoken Spice Girls-style frankness, drunken nights out and glitzy fashion sense. They would become a lot more polished and reserved as time went on.\n\n\"Nicola said: 'You've dropped your phone down the toilet, haven't you?' And she rolled up her sleeve and put her hand in my wee. That is friendship. And I must admit, I wouldn't have done it for her\"\n\nGirls Aloud hit #1 again with their cover version of The Pretenders' I'll Stand by You, which was chosen as the official 2004 Children in Need single. Their second album, What Will the Neighbours Say?, also went double platinum.\n\n\"Footballers' wives are just as bad as benefit scroungers – it's just a higher class of scrounger.\"\n\nIn late 2004, Cheryl began dating England and Chelsea footballer Ashley Cole, before marrying in 2006. Neither signed a pre-nup, Cheryl citing them as \"disgusting\". \"We're going to build our married life together not think about if it ever ends,\" she said.\n\n\"There's no way I'd stray from Cheryl. I can't lie, of course I'm tempted. But I really love Cheryl. We're getting on brilliantly. I don't want anything to ruin the relationship.\" (Ashley Cole)\n\nCheryl and Ashley quickly became an overnight power couple, securing endorsement deals and daily coverage in tabloids. Along with Victoria Beckham and Colleen Rooney, Cheryl was one of the main faces of the mid-00s WAG boom. Tabloids reported on Ashley Cole's wandering eye, but both he and Cheryl denied he had cheated on her.\n\n\"It was horrendous. Look, Ashley's young, and he's got a young mentality for his age anyway. He's learning. He has a beautiful soul, he's a really nice guy, and I'm not stupid, you know — I'm really not. I know what I'm doing.\"\n\nIn 2008, Ashley Cole was at the centre of a kiss-and-tell story in a Sunday tabloid, a young woman alleging that she had a drunken one-night stand with the footballer.\n\nCheryl publicly denied the allegation: \"Ashley's a wonderful husband and we are in love. I know Ashley intimately. When he's under the influence he isn't cap­able.\"\n\n\"I've come to the conclusion that I don't trust anybody in my life except my mother and my dogs\"\n\nUnfortunately, another woman soon came out of the woodwork, alleging she slept with Cole and was then given £6,000 to keep quiet. A similar story involving yet another woman came out soon after, alleging Cole gave her $10,000 to keep quiet.\n\nDespite the numerous allegations, Cheryl decided to stay with her husband following a brief sabbatical.\n\n\"I believe in soul mates, yes, but I believe you also have to work at love.\"\n\nAfter appearing on the Will.i.am single Heartbreaker, Cheryl took a break from Girls Aloud to start recording her own solo material. It arrived in the form of Fight for This Love, a mid-tempo pop R&B track which seemed to echo her private life. Hmm.\n\n\"I told mam: 'I'm gonna write me will. Bring paper, I need to tell you what to do.'\"\n\nIn July 2010, Cheryl jetted off to Tanzania with dancer Derek Hough. Two weeks later, she collapsed while on a photo shoot for Vogue. A doctor quickly diagnosed her with malaria, but her condition was so bad that doctors warned her family that she may die. Meanwhile, Cheryl was becoming delirious, accusing doctors of trying to kill her. \"I know what you're doing,\" she recalled saying to them. \"You're all trying to kill me. Don't think I'm stupid.\"\n\nAfter four days in intensive care, Cheryl's health improved, and she was moved to another hospital to recouperate.\n\n\"The first time I met Nicole [Scherzinger] was when she was performing on The X Factor in London. 'Oh my God, Cheryl! You're just as pretty in real life! I heard your song on the radio!' she had gushed. It was really embarrassing. Then she started singing Promise This to me, and I swear to God the woman sang the whole song, to my face. It was just so awkward, and every time I stood next to her she started singing it again. I thought how that would be like me going up to Britney and singing the whole of Baby One More Time in her face. Can you imagine how weird that would be?\"\n\n2010 saw the release of Cheryl's second studio album, Messy Little Raindrops, preceded by the single Promise This. Unfortunately, the record received universally bad reviews and underperformed in comparison to its predecessor.\n\n\"I think they stand a brilliant chance of making it work. Cheryl's told me she's not been this happy for years.\" (Tulisa)\n\nIn early 2011, Cheryl once again became romantically involved with Ashley Cole after inviting him to her 28th birthday party. There she allegedly gave him a lap dance in front of her mother. X Factor judge Tulisa confirmed the couple were back together during an interview with The Daily Mirror.\n\nLess than three months into their reunion, however, more stories appeared in Sunday tabloids about Cole's extra-curricular behaviour. Cheryl fled to LA to launch her career stateside with help from manager Will.i.am, effectively ending their relationship once and for all.\n\n\"I miss me friends, me family, me tea, me soaps. And me biscuits. I brought them all with us.\"\n\nIn May 2011, after months of speculation, Cheryl was confirmed as a judge for The X Factor USA, appearing on the panel alongside Simon Cowell , Paula Abdul and LA Reid. Appearing at the first auditions dressed as an impersonator of Daphne from Scooby-Doo, she spoke of her excitement at the new venture.\n\n\"Instead of putting herself out there in America, she sat in her hotel room eating ­digestive biscuits.\" (A FOX source)\n\nLess than a month later, Cheryl was sacked from The X Factor USA, replaced by Nicole Scherzinger. While tabloids speculated her Geordie accent made her impossible to understand, FOX sources blamed her reluctance to \"play the Hollywood game\".\n\nSimon Cowell later revealed that he had to let her go as he felt she had lost her confidence. \"When I saw her I didn't recognise her. Literally. The hair and outfit were crazy. Just totally crazy. The only way I can describe it is that it wasn't Cheryl sitting in that seat.\"\n\n\"F**k you. F**k Fox. F**k the orange and purple outfit. F**k the big hair. F**k the UK X Factor. F**k you all. I hate you.\"\n\nCheryl was reportedly blind-sided by the decision to drop her from The X Factor, sending Cowell a foul-mouthed final kiss-off that seemed to terminate their long-standing friendship.\n\nLess than a year later, she sued production company Blue Orbit for $2.3 million, claiming she was entitled to loss of earnings stemming from a \"pay or play\" deal. Regardless of being let go, she claimed to have been ensured payment for two seasons. The suit was later settled out-of-court.\n\n\"I've dined with Prince Charles, but I've also sat in a crack den.\"\n\nCheryl released her third album, A Million Lights, in 2012. The lead single, Call My Name, produced by Calvin Harris, became her first #1 song unaccompanied by an X Factor performance. Instead she debuted it on the BBC's rival talent show The Voice.\n\nShe also reunited with Girls Aloud to celebrate their 10-year anniversary.\n\n\"He was talking the face off us. He was talking about Nasa and Mars.\"\n\nWhile recording her fourth album in LA, Cheryl was involved in a minor car accident with Will.i.am. She later laughed off the experience, revealing that he was so distracted by discussion of space travel that he wasn't paying attention to the road.\n\n\"After I had malaria I created a 'f*** it list', because life's too short and the tattoo was on the list.\"\n\nIn August 2013, Cheryl posted a butt selfie on social media revealing that she had an enormous rose tattooed onto her rear end. She later revealed it was drawn by tattooist Nikko Hurtado, took three sessions of seven to eight hours to finish, and cost the price of a small car. A year later it was voted the worst celebrity tattoo in the world in a Premiere Laser Clinic poll.\n\n\"I wasn't well in the head when that was going on, so it wasn't going to work. It only hit me at the beginning of 2013 that I'd completely lost myself. I'd look in a mirror and think, 'Who the hell is she?'\"\n\nWriting in her autobiography, Cheryl: My Story, Cheryl seemed to have had a change of heart when it came to her relationship with Simon Cowell and subsequently The X Factor. She wrote, \"Simon was right to get rid of me.\"\n\nIn March of 2014 it was confirmed that she would be returning to The X Factor as a judge, appearing alongside fellow pop star Rita Ora and DJ Nick Grimshaw.\n\n\"I usually do not discuss my personal life but to stop the speculation I want to share my happy news.\"\n\nAfter three months of dating, Cheryl married French businessman Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini on a private island in the West Indies. She told The Telegraph that her French was coming along: \"I understand it more than I can speak it. I'm definitely not there yet, but I understand.\"\n\n\"If it makes people rethink, I did my job. If it makes two people who buy the album rethink, I sent out the right message. If it confuses the rest, I apologise. I was just feeling what he was saying.\"\n\nCheryl created mild confusion by opening up her fourth solo album, Only Human, with a spoken-word intro written by a Buddhist self-help guru named Alan Watts. The passage stemmed from his book, Do You Do It Or Does It Do You? How To Let The Universe Meditate You, which Cheryl reportedly turned to following her divorce.\n\n\"It's crazy double standards. You'd never be allowed to say to somebody, 'Oh, you look a bit fat'. And being overweight is unhealthy – it's actually a bad message to tell someone who is obese that they look 'curvy' or 'great'.\"\n\nAs she returned to The X Factor, Cheryl was dogged by tabloid speculation on her shrinking frame, blamed on what sources claim was a fraught marriage. Cheryl herself denied the allegations, insisting she was stressed over the death of her father-in-law.\n\n\"You have no idea what I have been through,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"Just loosing my father in law v recently and everything that comes with that. Not that I am or should justify myself to anyone [sic].\" \"I'm so f sick of people thinking it's ok to be mean or body shame anyone. And it's woman on woman. Have some respect and maybe think there may be reasons why before opening your mouth please [sic].'\"\n\n\"I have to have something that’s for me. I'm aware that everybody wants to know what the eff is going on, but I'm not going to say anything, for my sanity.\"\n\nIn 2008, 14-year-old Liam Payne auditioned for Cheryl on The X Factor. Eight years later, the pair were rumoured to be dating. But unlike her high-profile union with Ashley Cole, and her high-profile name change in 2014, Cheryl kept noticeably mum on their relationship. One of the earliest signs they were an item was a discreetly-snapped shot of the pair shopping in Sainsbury's.\n\n\"I'd love kids. I'm obsessed with babies. Of course I've thought about baby names. A million times. I like Alfie for a little boy.\"\n\nAfter months of speculation, Cheryl was photographed in London in 2016 with a noticeable pregnancy bump...and later gave birth to her first child, a boy, on March 22 2017.\n\n\"Although he doesn't have a name, he is already stealing hearts. We are all madly in love, and overwhelmingly happy with out little arrival.\"\n\nOn March 25, just in time for Mother's Day, Cheryl announced, via instagram, that her son had arrived. It was revealed soon after that he had a slightly unconventional name: Bear.\n\n\"Since becoming a mam, my beauty regime has gone out the window. It’s just been recently that I’ve had time to start applying [make-up] again.\"\n\nSix months after giving birth to baby Bear, Cheryl made her TV return with a series of interviews on This Morning to promote her \"beauty secrets\". She made many intriguing revelations.\n\n\"I've got the luxury of spending time with my newborn child and I think I'm going to take that. A lot of mothers have to rush back to work and I don't think it is really fair.\"\n\nCheryl made her return to The X Factor in October 2017, appearing alongside Simon Cowell for a pair of judges' houses episodes. She also promised new music is in her future, but not until she's ready to part with her newborn.\n\n\"I hated being pregnant. A lot of stuff went on and I didn't enjoy it.\"\n\nWhile promoting her X Factor return, Cheryl also revealed secrets about her pregnancy, and whether she would go through it again.\n\n\"I didn't plan any in the first place,\" she told The Sun, \"but I'm glad it happened. So, you know, I don't rule anything out.\""
