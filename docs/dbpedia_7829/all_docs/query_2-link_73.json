        "text": "Huge congratulations are in order for ELLE cover star Cheryl Cole, who has announced that she secretly married her French entrepreneur boyfriend Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini earlier this month.\n\nThe Crazy Stupid Love singer posted the news on her personal website, CherylCole.com, along with a picture (above) of a stonking diamond wedding and engagement set.\n\n'I usually do not discuss my personal life but to stop the speculation I want to share my happy news,' the statement ran.\n\n'Jean-Bernard and I married on 7/7/14. We are very happy and excited to move forward with our lives together.'\n\nIt promptly caused the site to crash.\n\nThe small, intimate affair took place on Mustique - a far cry from Cheryl's lavish first wedding, to footballer Ashley Cole, from whom she split in 2010.\n\nOf course, anyone who has read Cheryl's exclusive, no-holds barred interview in the August issue of ELLE won't be too surprised by the news.\n\n'I thought I had every box ticked, career and personal. I was the first [member of Girls Aloud] to get married. I was the one everyone thought would be the first to have a baby. And then the rug got pulled out from under me,' she told us.\n\n'I've learned there's no such thing as a plan. You can't make them.'\n\nRead Cheryl's full ELLE cover interview now"
