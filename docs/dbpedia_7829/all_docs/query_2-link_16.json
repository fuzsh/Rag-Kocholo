        "text": "Struggling to pronounce Cheryl Cole’s new name of Cheryl Fernandez-Versini? Don’t worry, you’re not the only one.\n\nWhile we were all looking forward to hearing Peter Dickson attempt to announce it in his big booming voice each week on The X Factor, the Crazy Stupid Love singer will now be referred to simply as ‘Cheryl’, because she claims people are having difficulties pronouncing her married name.\n\n‘It’s just Cheryl because everyone seems to be having a hard time saying it,’ she told The Sunday People.\n\n31-year-old Cheryl married boyfriend Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini last month following a whirlwind three-month relationship.\n\nMetro contacted a spokesperson for Cheryl, who advised us: ‘Cheryl’s full name is Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, professionally she will be Cheryl.’"
