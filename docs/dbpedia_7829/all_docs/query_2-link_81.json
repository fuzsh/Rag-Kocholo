        "text": "Cheryl Cole got this little swirl tattoo on the center of her chest from artist Nikko Hurtado in April 2016. The design is a Buddhist unalome which represents enlightenment. If the top of the tattoo symbolizes the destination, the swirls symbolize the journey — which is often indirect but gets more refined as you get closer to the goal. It shows that you are making progress even when it feels like you’re treading backwards.\n\nThe artist wrote on instagram: “Always honored to tattoo my friend @cherylofficial did this little Buddhist symbol on her chest about a month ago. @cherylofficial & @fakeliampayne are class acts and always treat me very well. Thank you guys for trusting me tattooing you. ?? honored.”\n\n(more…)\n\nSimilar Products:\n\nSoma Art Tattoo\n\n$3.99\n\nTattooGirlsRule\n\n$1.49\n\nGlo Tatts\n\n$19.95\n\nCheryl, who’s maiden name is Cheryl Tweedy, got this “Mrs C” tattoo on the back of her neck after getting married to football player Ashley Cole in 2006 and changing her last name to Cole. Unfortunately the couple were divorced in 2010. She told The Guardian that she does not plan to remove this tattoo, saying “I’m not ashamed of anything. I’ve got nothing to rub away.”\n\nShe did not immediately change her name either, adding “I don’t feel sentimental about the name. If I went back to being Cheryl Tweedy, I’d be… I’m not ashamed of my marriage, it’s a period in my life. And I am Cheryl Cole. That’s how I feel.” However she took on the name Cheryl Fernandez-Versini after marrying Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini in July 2014.\n\nSimilar Products:\n\nDeviant Diva\n\n$3.99\n\nTattify\n\n$2.99\n\nhappytatts\n\n$11.50\n\nCheryl Cole revealed a HUGE floral tattoo covering her entire lower back and buttocks in August 2013. She had been getting work done on this tattoo by artist Nikko Hurtado across multiple sessions for many months before it was finally finished. In February 2013 she announced that she had already put 15 hours of work into the tattoo.\n\nThe tattoo does have a deeper meaning to Cheryl, but she also loves it for the look. She tweeted: “I have personal meaning behind it but English roses are my favourite flowers.”\n\nResponding to criticism over the tattoo’s size, she tweeted “People are entitled to their own opinion. Personally I’ve never really concerned myself with other people’s body parts!”\n\nShe was inspired to go big with her inking after getting sick with Malaria in 2010 following a trip to Tanzania. She told Graham Norton “After I got malaria, I wrote a — you call it a bucket list, I call it a fuck it list. And I just wanted to do everything I wanted to do. Life’s short and it changed my perspective and I always wanted a big tattoo.”\n\nThis tattoo covers many of Cheryl’s previous inkings including the butterfly on her back and flower on her butt. It also covers a small Tweety cartoon tattoo on her bum which was her first tattoo. She told i-D “The first tattoo I ever got, I was 16. My sister was having the first grandchild of the family and we all got a little symbol for him. I got a teeny little Tweety Bird.” She chose the Tweety Pie character from Looney Tunes because of it’s similarity to their family name Tweedy.\n\nShe has said that this tattoo with be her last, but she may still change her mind!\n\nSimilar Products:\n\nTattooGirlsRule\n\n$1.69\n\nTaboo Tattoo\n\n$1.00\n\nTattooGirlsRule\n\n$1.49\n\nThe now-covered tribal butterfly tattoo on Cheryl’s lower back was her oldest tattoo, dating back to at least 2002. In the above photos, taken in 2011, she had already begun work on the swirling design that now covers her lower back.\n\nCheryl added this portion of the new design in an eleven-hour session in August 2011 at Shamrock Social Club in Los Angeles. The tattoo represents a fresh start after her 2010 divorce. “I designed it myself with the help of an artist and had it done to symbolise a new beginning,” she said.\n\nAccording to The Mirror, Cheryl told a friend “The tattoo is deeply personal. It took weeks to come up with the final design. It has a strong symbolic meaning and signifies a fresh start and my new independence.”\n\nSimilar Products:\n\nTattify\n\n$2.99\n\nRoyaltats\n\n$15.99\n\nThe Fickle Tattoo\n\n$7.00"
