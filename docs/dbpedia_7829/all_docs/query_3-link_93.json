        "text": "Cheryl Fernandez-Versini is to launch her own record label.\n\nThe former Girls Aloud singer is set to go up against her fellow 'X Factor' judge Simon Cowell - who runs label Syco with Sony - by setting up her own establishment later this year, and while the star has gone solo since the pop group split, she is keen to attract all genres to her own venture.\n\nA music industry source said: ''It's a natural next step for Cheryl, having coached contestants for years on 'The X Factor'.\n\n''She knows what it takes to succeed in the industry from her experience as a performer - both as a solo artist and as a group, from her years in Girls Aloud.\n\n''Cheryl definitely knows her stuff. The artists she'll be interested in won't just be pop acts - it will cross over all genres.\n\n''She loves music and is really excited about being able to springboard new talent.\n\nThe 31-year-old star is to release her fourth studio album 'Only Human' later this year and when she has completed work on the record she will move onto trying to make her record label a success.\n\nThe source added to the Daily Mirror newspaper: ''At the moment, she has just finished recording her new album.\n\n''Once 'Only Human' has been released - towards the end of the year - she's going to focus all her attention on her label.\n\n''There's interest from all the big labels, but Cheryl may just go it alone.''\n\nCheryl's latest venture will come as no surprise to Simon, who admitted in March he would love to offer her a label at Sony.\n\nThe brunette stunner recently settled her differences with the music mogul and returned to 'The X Factor' to take up a position alongside him on the judging panel this year.\n\nCheryl and Simon fell out when he sacked her from the U.S. version of the talent show in 2011 just three weeks after she jumped across the pond from the U.K. 'X Factor' following a two-year spell on the ITV program."
