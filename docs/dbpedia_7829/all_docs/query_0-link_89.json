        "text": "Cheryl is perhaps one of the biggest stars on the planet.\n\nThe former X Factor judge and Girls Aloud member exploded into the public consciousness over a decade ago.\n\nAnd since then, the Newcastle-born celebrity has had a string of relationships, changing her name over the years.\n\nNowadays, despite her being with Wolverhampton singer and former One Direction star Liam Payne, there appears to be some confusion over her moniker.\n\nTechnically, she is still called Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, although that is no longer the name she goes by.\n\nSo how has her name changed through the years?\n\nCheryl Tweedy\n\nCheryl burst into the public eye with Girls Aloud in 2002.\n\nHer and her bandmates - Nadine Coyle, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts and Kimberly Walsh - rose to fame on Popstars: The Rivals.\n\nFor years, we knew Cheryl as Tweedy - but that all changed in the mid-00s.\n\nCheryl Cole\n\nCheryl adopting the surname of Cole in 2006.\n\nThe future X Factor judge married footballer Ashley, the former Arsenal and Chelsea left-back, in a lavish ceremony.\n\nBut the marriage only lasted four years - with Cheryl filing for divorce in 2010.\n\nThe reason for the separation was \"unreasonable behaviour\", but Cheryl kept her name of Cole (which is arguably her most famous) for a couple of years after that.\n\nCheryl\n\nCheryl would eventually drop the Cole moniker completely.\n\nThe name change coincided with Cheryl's launch as a solo artists, after a record-breaking career with Girls Aloud.\n\nBut fans saw another name change within two years.\n\nCheryl Fernandez-Versini\n\nCheryl took on the exotic surname after meeting future-husband Jean-Bernard in Cannes in 2014.\n\nIn what proved to be a whirlwind romance, the duor fell head over heels and ended up tying the knot twelve weeks later.\n\nBut Cheryl wasn't Cheryl Fernandez-Versini for long.\n\nIndeed, their 18 month marriage was not meant to be, with the pair splitting in December 2015.\n\n... back to Cheryl\n\nSince then, the Geordie star has dropped the surname and simply become ‘Cheryl’ once more.\n\nThis is how she wants to be referred, reports suggest, with Cheryl now a mononymous figure in the eye of newspaper columns and the public.\n\n... but is another change coming?\n\nCheryl fans have taken to social media this week to share their excitement as rumours went into overdrive.\n\nMany fans of the former X Factor judge were delighted to find out boyfriend Liam Payne was jetting back to the UK from LA.\n\nAnd, while the pair have kept schtum about why, it is being reported Cheryl will finally go public with her pregnancy in an advertising campaign for L'Oreal,\n\nAccording to The Sun, the 33-year-old will reportedly be splashed across billboards, magazines and websites leaving little doubt that she is expecting.\n\nCould we see marriage?"
