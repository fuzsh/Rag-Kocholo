        "text": "She's been called Cheryl Tweedy, Cheryl Cole, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini - and even just Cheryl.\n\nNow, the Geordie singer claims she wants to be \"Chezza\".\n\nAnd the former Girls Aloud star has already done a u-turn over recent claims she was done with men after her break-up with Liam Payne.\n\nIn an interview with Metro, the star addressed her ongoing name saga, stating: \"Fans call me Chez - let’s stick with that.\n\n\"These days you can call yourself whatever you want. Why can’t I be Chezza?\n\n\"I know I have had 20 other names! But you can evolve. I’m changing again… triple barrel!\"\n\nThe Loving Kind singer's multiple names have been due to her two marriages, the first to footballer Ashley Cole and the second to Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini.\n\nBoth ended in divorce, with the star breaking-up last year with One Direction's Liam, the father of her son Bear.\n\nBut addressing recent claims she was no longer after a relationship, she admitted: \"I shouldn’t have said that - I should have said maybe.\n\n\"I am working on me and Bear and he takes up a lot of my energy and thoughts and love.\"\n\nBut Cheryl hasn't ruled out a brother or sister for Bear, adding: \"I would like to, honestly.\n\n\"Not just for Bear having a sibling. I grew up with a lot of siblings so I can’t imagine having an only child.\"\n\nCheryl, 35, also admitted to getting therapy for being a \"massive worrier\".\n\nShe said: \"I have been having therapy for the past year because I have been a massive worrier and non-sleeper for a lot of my life.\n\n\"When I had the baby I didn’t have [that feeling]. I was calm and peaceful.\n\n\"I wanted to maintain that. I didn’t want to be feeling those feelings again.\""
