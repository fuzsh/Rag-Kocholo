        "text": "Cheryl Fernandez-Versini’s marriage is reportedly in trouble because she’s struggling with the language barrier.\n\nThe X Factor judge’s cousin Tony Tweedy has claimed that Chezza and husband Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini are finding it difficult to understand each other.\n\nHe told The Sun on Sunday: ‘The family think the marriage is over. When I asked if Cheryl was happy with him, they replied, “Put it this way, I’ll give it six months.”\n\n‘That was three months ago, and look what’s happening.’\n\nHe added: ‘Cheryl can’t speak French. I’m told he speaks little English. What sort of relationship is it if she cannot speak French and he can’t speak English? They may as well have a threesome with the interpreter.’\n\nThe paper was quick to point out that a source close to Cheryl had told them that she hadn’t spoken to Tony for years.\n\nThe singer got married to Jean-Bernard in 2014 after a whirlwind three-month romance.\n\nThe couple have been plagued by rumours that their marriage has hit the rocks.\n\nJean-Bernard dismissed the reports as ‘nonsense’ and wrote on his Instagram page last month: ‘Normally don’t read or comment… But the truth is that even when my dad died I put my life on the line for my wife.\n\n‘Yes I am working like everybody else to put food on the table but my priority is my wife as this is the last person that is family.’\n\nMetro.co.uk have reached out to a rep for Cheryl for a comment.\n\nMORE : Cheryl Fernandez-Versini might not be spending Christmas with her husband this year"
