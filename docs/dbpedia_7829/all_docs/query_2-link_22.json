        "text": "TWICE-divorced Cheryl has officially reverted to her maiden name Tweedy, new documents have confirmed.\n\nThe singer, 34, was granted a 14-second divorce last year after she said her former husband Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini left her ill with “stress and weight loss.”\n\nCheryl’s boyfriend Liam Payne claimed earlier this year that she would revert back to Tweedy but now she has used her maiden name for the first time in official paperwork.\n\nAccounts for her company CC Couture show Cheryl using her former name when she signed off paper work, which has just been made public.\n\nThe figures show that Cheryl made more than £400,000 in 2016 – the year she divorced Jean-Bernard and fell pregnant with her first son Bear.\n\nReserves in her company rose from £1 million to £1.4 million, with her paying a £102,000 bill in Corporation Tax.\n\nFormer One Direction star Liam said in May: \"Her name is officially Cheryl Tweedy now, but to be honest it doesn't really bother me, we have a kid together, there's a lot more to our life.\"\n\nHer 19-month marriage to Jean-Bernard started with a £390,000 beach wedding in Mustique on July 7, 2014.\n\nThe ruling, which took place in October 2016 meant she was now free to start a new life with Liam.\n\nCheryl was previously married to ex-England footballer Ashley Cole, but after four years they divorced in 60 seconds.\n\nThis week Cheryl's pal Nick Grimshaw revealed he had seen private images of her son, describing the six-month-old as \"gorgeous.\"\n\nNO GOOD ADVICE Cheryl and Liam's worst fashion fails\n\nHe said: “Cheryl and I are super close. I went for dinner with her and my mum a few weeks ago.\n\n“I’ve not met Bear but I have seen lots of pictures of him though and he is gorgeous.\n\n\"He is really handsome and obviously their child – and they’re both gorgeous aren’t they.\""
