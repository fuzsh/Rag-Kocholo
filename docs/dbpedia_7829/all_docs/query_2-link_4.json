        "text": "CHERYL has poked fun at her \"20 other names\" and joked she now wants to be known as \"Chez\".\n\nThe 35-year-old singer - whose previous surnames include Tweedy, Cole and Fernandez-Versini - made light of her various monikers in a new interview.\n\nThe star, previously married Ashley Cole and French restaurant owner Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini, told Metro: \"Fans call me Chez, I love it.\n\n\"Let’s stick with that. These days you can call yourself whatever you want.\n\n\"Why can’t I be Chezza? I know I have had 20 other names!\n\n\"But you can evolve. I’m changing again… triple barrel!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Cheryl - who raises son Bear with ex Liam Payne - has revealed that she may never release another album after her comeback single Love Made Me Do It flopped in the charts.\n\nShe admitted that times have changed, and the days of going to the shops to buy an album are behind us.\n\nShe explained: \"No one is buying an album.\n\n\"I'm making myself sound old now, but you'd go to HMV and buy album of the month and cherish it and play it over and over and over.\n\n\"But now you can play any song any time on your Spotify playlist, and I love that - but I miss the old: 'let's buy the album'.\"\n\nThe star added that she would only release an album if she has \"a body of work\" - but reassured fans that she won't stop writing or recording.\n\nAlthough she has no plans to release a full album, the former X Factor judge did tell the publication that she plans to \"release enough music to be an album but not in one go, only single by single\".\n\nCheryl launched her much anticipated return to the public eye last year, releasing her first single in almost four years, Love Made Me Do It, in November.\n\nThe track sold just 5,000 copies in its first week and was at number 48 by its second.\n\nThe star was also slammed when she performed the single live on The X Factor - with viewers panning her raunchy routine.\n\nAs well as questioning Cheryl's vocals, fans were confused when Cheryl licked her hand and writhed around the floor as part of her performance.\n\nThe brunette beauty hit back at the critics days later - insisting that she had watched the performance back and \"loved it\".\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220."
