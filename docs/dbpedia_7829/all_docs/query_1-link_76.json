        "text": "CHERYL Tweedy has finally called it quits with Liam Payne after a two-and-a-half-year relationship.\n\nThe superstar couple, who share baby Bear, 1, together, made the decision to split weeks ago... so let's take a look back at the former Girls Aloud star's rollercoaster love-life...\n\nCheryl boyfriend and husband list\n\nLiam Payne\n\nCheryl, 35, and Liam, 24, first met when a young wannabe popstar Liam auditioned for her on The X Factor back in 2009.\n\nThe pair got together while Cheryl was going through her divorce to second husband Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini at the beginning of 2016.\n\nThey became parents in March 2017, and The Sun revealed on May 1, 2017 that the couple have named their son Bear.\n\nOn February 17, 2018, The Sun broke the story that Liam's constant travelling to promote his solo career has placed an intolerable strain on the relationship and they are ready to split.\n\nBut the pair still put on a united front together at the Brit Awards 2018, where they smiled on the red carpet and Cheryl joked about the couple's 'safe word'.\n\nOn July 1, 2018, The Sun exclusively revealed the pair had split weeks prior and the One Direction heartthrob has now moved out of the £5million mansion they shared in Surrey.\n\nAfter being approached by The Sun, Cheryl and Liam released a statement confirming their break-up.\n\nJean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini\n\nBefore dating Liam, Cheryl's second marriage was to businessman Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini in July 2014 after a whirlwind three-month romance.\n\nThe couple met during Cannes film festival in 2014 before tying the knot in a private ceremony on the Caribbean island of Mustique in July of the same year.\n\nHowever the marriage fell apart and after months of speculation, the split was confirmed in January 2016 and the couple were granted a decree nisi in October of the same year.\n\nJB is not dating anyone at the moment but revealed in May 2018, he has \"not found the right one yet\" and is \"in a very happy place\".\n\nTre Holloway\n\nCheryl dated US dancer Tre Holloway for over a year after first meeting when she performed her single Promise This on The X Factor in 2010.\n\nAfter going public with the romance, the pop star was keen to gush about her new romance, admitting she was in love with the backing dancer.\n\nShe said: “I love having people around who feel like family. There’s an intensity, there’s a trust, there’s a love — a genuine love. He is a ridiculously talented character.”\n\nAlthough it was rumoured she was keen to move to America to join him, the pair struggled to maintain their long-distance relationship and split in October 2013.\n\nDerek Hough\n\nShortly after her first divorce came to an end, Cheryl was heavily rumoured to have been involved with Dancing with the Stars professional Derek Hough.\n\nThe two met in 2010 after he starred in her music video for her single Parachute and although neither confirmed a romance at the time, Derek has since admitted the truth.\n\n“We dated for a while. I don’t speak about my time with her because I think often in this culture people take advantage of their friendships.\n\nAnd the Dancing With The Stars favourite insisted that the pair are still great pals, saying: “Absolutely we are still friends, we are still very close.”\n\nAshley Cole\n\nAlthough born Cheryl Tweedy, the former Girls Aloud star's most famous name is her adopted, Cheryl Cole, which she gained after she married footballer Ashley in 2006.\n\nThe pair first met in 2004 after they both moved into the same apartment block in North London and they were engaged within a year.\n\nHowever, during their marriage, the two were rocked by a string of infidelity allegations against the former Chelsea defender and the two finally split in 2010."
