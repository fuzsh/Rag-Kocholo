        "text": "Well, this is a surprise. Apparently, British pop star Cheryl Cole got married two weeks ago and she decided to share this news with the wider public on Sunday. Cole — who is mostly known for being a judge on the X Factor and her single \"Crazy Stupid Love\" released in June — revealed this happy occasion by posting a picture of her rings to her Instagram and official website along with a sweet message for her fans. Her boyfriend-turned-husband is Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini, who Cole began dating about three months ago.\n\nThat's right. After only three months of dating, Cole and Fernandez-Versini decided to tie the knot. Of course, we couldn't be happier for them because there is an old saying that goes \"when you know you know,\" but three months seems like a short amount of time to be with someone before walking down the aisle. This is Cole's second marriage after football star Ashley Cole back in 2010, from whom she gets the last name she is still currently using professionally and who she dated for almost a year before they announced their engagement. In light of that, it's unclear whether it bodes well or ill for Cole that her courtship time with Fernandez-Versini is much shorter than that.\n\n\"I usually do not discuss my personal life, but to stop the speculation, I want to share my happy news,\" said Cole in her message. \"Jean-Bernard and I married on 7/7/14. We are very happy and excited to move forward with our lives together.\" Three months is up there with some of the shortest courtships before celebrity marriages I've ever seen, but do Cole and Fernandez-Versini have a shot at making it work better than some of these pairings? Here's wishing them all the best.\n\nNikki Reed and Paul McDonald\n\nReed and McDonald began dating in 2011 and announced their engagement in 2011. They were married for three years before getting separated in 2014. Despite the fact that Reed has filed for divorce from McDonald, the two of them still seem to be on fairly good terms. They collaborated on an album together, after all.\n\nLamar Odom and Kourtney Kardashian\n\nKardashian and Odom met in 2009 and got married in 2009. Their marriage lasted for four years before Kardashian filed for divorce and legal restoration of her last name. Now she's moved on to French Montana and her and Odom are no longer on speaking terms.\n\nKaty Perry and Russell Brand\n\nPerry and Brand began dating in 2009 and got engaged around three months later in December 2009. They didn't actually get married until 2010 and their relationship only lasted just over a year before Brand sent Perry a text message announcing that he was divorcing her. Since that's the worst kind of text-message breakup, the pair haven't spoken since.\n\nMariah Carey and Nick Cannon\n\nCarey and Cannon began dating in 2008 and got married in 2008. Unlike the other couples on this list, the two of them are still happily married and they seem to still be very much in love with each other. They even have two adorable twins together. Hopefully this is the relationship that Cole and Fernandez-Versini will emulate."
