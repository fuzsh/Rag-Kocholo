        "text": "We’ve only just managed to get our minds around the fact Cheryl Cole changed her name to Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and now the star has decided to go by a new identity altogether – the newly married singer is now simply going by the moniker Cheryl.\n\nThe X Factor judge married Frenchman Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini on the Carribean island of Mustique on 7 July with just her mother Joan Callaghan and her PA Lily England as witnesses.\n\nAnd the former Girls Aloud warbler left us wondering what we should call her as speculation mounted as to whether she’d legally changed her surname.\n\nCheryl is now just going by her first name (WENN)\n\nShe told the Sunday People: “It’s just Cheryl because everyone seems to be having a hard time saying it.”\n\nIt’s not just us who had trouble getting used to her new name – fellow X Factor panellist Louis Walsh has even roped Jean-Bernard into giving him some French lessons in a bid to get it right.\n\nThe Irishman said: “He seems to be a really nice guy and he’s given me some French lessons.”\n\n• Cheryl Cole Putting Ex Ashley Behind Her - Including That Tattoo - As She Embraces Mrs Fernandez-Versini\n\n• Cheryl Cole Makes Chart History As Crazy Stupid Love Hits Number One\n\nCheryl married Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini in secret in July (WENN)\n\nCheryl had a second wedding bash last month in London so her closest friends and family could celebrate her happy news.\n\nAnd it’s unknown if Cheryl had even told all her friends as during a recent BBC Radio 1 show she admitted she would have kept her marriage completely secret if the news had not been leaked.\n\nMeanwhile, the star appears to be enjoying her return to the X Factor and seemed excited to be tweeting from the auditions after they kicked off in London last week.\n\nPosting a picture of the crowd inside the arena on Instagram, she wrote: “Xf audition arena stages... Say cheeeese.”\n\nAnd despite sacking Cheryl from X Factor USA soon into season one of the show in 2011, it seems things are still much the same between the singer and music boss Simon Cowell.\n\nOn working with him again, she said: “He’s been teasing me always and physically pinching us. You have no idea. It’s like the annoyance button has gone up to 12.\n\n“There are times when we get on great and we have the same opinion and there are times when he drives me insane. Nothing has changed.”"
