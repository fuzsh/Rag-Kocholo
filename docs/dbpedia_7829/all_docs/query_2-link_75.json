        "text": "GEORDIE singer Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's marriage to second husband Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini has been drawn to a close by a family court judge.\n\nThe pair were granted a decree nisi by Judge Heather MacGregor at a hearing in the Central Family Court in London on Thursday.\n\nFernandez-Versini, 33, a former member of the band Girls Aloud and a former judge on the X Factor television show, married Mr Fernandez-Versini, a 35-year-old French restaurateur, two years ago.\n\nHer previous marriage to footballer Ashley Cole - a former Arsenal, Chelsea and England left back who is now at Los Angeles Galaxy - ended in divorce after four years in 2010.\n\nNeither the singer nor Mr Fernandez-Versini was in court on Thursday.\n\nThe hearing lasted 14 seconds.\n\nA spokesman for the singer said: \"Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini have today obtained a decree nisi in their divorce proceedings. No further comment will be made and they ask for their privacy to be respected.\"\n\nCHERYL FACTFILE:\n\nCheryl Fernandez-Versini - born Cheryl Tweedy in Newcastle in 1983 - first rose to fame in 2002 by taking part in reality TV programme Popstars: The Rivals.\n\nShe, along with Nicola Roberts, Sarah Harding, Kimberley Walsh and Nadine Coyle, won a place in girl group Girls Aloud and went on to score the Christmas number one of that year with their debut single Sound Of The Underground.\n\nAccording to the Official Charts Company, the group had a total of four UK number one singles and 21 UK top 10s.\n\nIn 2009 Girls Aloud announced they were taking a short break but reunited in 2012 for their 10th anniversary.\n\nIn March 2013, after their final concert in Liverpool, they announced on Twitter that they were splitting up indefinitely.\n\nCheryl launched a successful solo career and has released four solo albums - 3 Words, Messy Little Raindrops, A Million Lights and Only Human, her latest effort which came out in 2014.\n\nAccording to her Official Charts Company page, she remains the first female British solo artist to have had five number one singles.\n\nThe 33-year-old joined The X Factor as a judge in 2008 and during that time she mentored two winners - Alexandra Burke and Joe McElderry.\n\nShe left the show in 2010 before re-joining in 2014, following a short stint as a judge on the US version of The X Factor in 2011.\n\nShe was sensationally fired by Simon Cowell before the show even aired.\n\nShe later said in an interview with the Evening Standard magazine that Cowell had done the \"right thing to remove her\". \"I was suffering from a lot of things - heartache, confusion - I was in a dark place,\" she said.\n\nFollowing her X Factor return in 2014, she went on to mentor that year's runners-up, Reggie N Bollie.\n\nThe singer is very involved in charitable work and has set up her own organisation alongside The Prince's Trust - Cheryl's Trust. The aim of the charity is to raise £2m to build a centre to support young people in her home city of Newcastle.\n\nIn 2003, she was charged with assault after becoming involved in an incident with toilet attendant Sophie Amogbokpa at a club in Guildford, Surrey. She was later cleared of the racially aggravated assault charge against her but was found guilty of assault and was ordered to pay a £3,000 fine and complete 120 hours of community service."
