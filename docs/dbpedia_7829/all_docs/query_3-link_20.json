        "text": "She has acquired an exotic double-barrelled surname, being newly married to Frenchman Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini after a whirlwind romance\n\nAnd friends say she has never been happier – or looked better.\n\nOn Monday Cheryl was at a party in London on her husband’s arm to celebrate their wedding with around 80 of her family and friends, wearing a sheer black dress by British couturiers Ralph & Russo.\n\nOn Wednesday, she launched her new perfume, Storm Flower, in a soft-gold lace couture gown with a thigh-high split by Zuhair Murad.\n\nAnd on Thursday the Geordie songstress attended the BBC Radio 1 studios in London, looking gorgeous in a butter-soft pleated leather skirt while getting ready to celebrate her latest single set to hit No 1.\n\nThe X Factor judge, 31, married Jean-Bernard, 33, in secret earlier this month on the Caribbean island of Mustique.\n\nInsiders say the look of love is adding a little extra “je ne sais quoi” to the new Mrs Fernandez-Versini’s radiant glow – with the singer saying of married life this week: “Yes, I’m enjoying it very much.”\n\nI can’t remember being so excited to be releasing new music\n\nCheryl Fernandez-Versini\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
