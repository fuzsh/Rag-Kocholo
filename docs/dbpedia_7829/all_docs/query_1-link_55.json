        "text": "If there’s one thing that Cheryl ’s good at, it’s a cryptic Instagram post. But she’s strayed off that path and gone for full-on blatancy with her most recent offering.\n\nShe reposted a fan’s illustration from four years ago of her dancing – that was drawn for when her single Call My Name came out (you guessed it, four years ago). It includes the lyric \"say my name baby\" from the song.\n\nPretty apt seeing that Cheryl’s recently dropped the Fernandez-Versini part of her name, following her split from French husband Jean-Bernard. Cheryl’s totally asking fans to call out her new – shorter – name.\n\nShe wrote: “4 years today #Repost @domandink”.\n\nWiping all trace of ex-husband Jean Bernard Fernandez-Versini from her life, Chez will only be known by her first name for the forseeable - and she’s booked her first public appearance under her mononymous moniker.\n\nThe singer, 32, will receive an award at the Global Gift Gala in Paris next month from actress Eva Longoria .\n\nA source said: “Cheryl wants to wipe the slate clean and start afresh with a new name, now the divorce is going through.\n\n“Things turned pretty nasty over the weekend, with both Cheryl and JB making comments on social media, so from hereon in, she will just be known as Cheryl.\n\nRead more:\n\nRead more:\n\n“Her last album in 2014 was released under the name ‘Cheryl’, too, but everyone still called her by her new married name.\n\n“This time around, everyone is under strict instructions that she is just Cheryl, nothing else. Organisers at next month’s event were told that all announcements of Cheryl’s attendance should only refer to her as Cheryl.”"
