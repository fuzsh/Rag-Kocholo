        "text": "Simon Cowell has an eye for talent, boy bands and a whole lot of love.\n\nLess than two months after E! News confirmed that Liam Payne and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini are dating, the America's Got Talent judge is speaking out about the couple and expressing his approval of the pairing.\n\n\"I saw them together and we had a really nice dinner. They were on good form,\" Simon shared with The Sun. \"They're like two little chipmunks madly in love. Literally, they were so cute.\"\n\nHe continued, \"But importantly they both seemed very happy over here and very relaxed. I'm happy for them.\"\n\nWhen Liam auditioned for The X-Factor U.K. both in 2008 and 2010, it was Simon who served as one of the show's judges. He ultimately helped bring Liam and four other talented artists together to form One Direction.\n\nSpeaking of 1D, the former American Idol judge recently spoke out on the group's future ever since they began their extended hiatus earlier this year. While multiple sources said the guys including Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson were not splitting up, Simon isn't so sure what's next for the guys.\n\n\"I don't know if it's a hiatus or a breakup, to be honest,\" he shared with Billboard. \"In a weird way, I don't want to know. I don't think they've had enough time to experience what it's like not being in the group to really answer that.\"\n\nHe added, \"They had achieved so much in a short period of time, and I didn't want them to get jaded. As I've gotten older, I've learned to trust people more, particularly artists. They'll decide when they want to come back together.\"\n\nFor now, Liam and Cheryl are trying to keep their relationship private. But that won't stop the pair from sharing a few playful pictures on social media.\n\n\"Last minute Easter egg shopping at the English shop in America... as you do,\" Cheryl wrote on Instagram after the holidays."
