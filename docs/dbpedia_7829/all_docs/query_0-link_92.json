        "text": "Cheryl Cole - now rumoured to be Cheryl Fernandez-Versini - married her French lover Jean-Bernard on 7th July.\n\nThe couple met and began dating in late April, but it wasn’t until May, when they were spotted together at the Cannes Film Festival, that rumours that they were in a relationship began.\n\nREAD: EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT CHERYL COLE'S LUXURY ISLAND WEDDING\n\nAnd, while we already know that Chezza Can't Speak French (or so she claimed, back in her Girls Aloud days), we're pretty sure that she and Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini did more than just let the funky music do the talking.\n\nSpeaking with Grazia, the businessman explained that the language barrier is not a problem.\n\nHe said: \"My English is better than her French but I teach her the words. Mainly the bad words! She teaches me the Geordie.\"\n\nSEE: CHERYL COLE'S LIFE IN PICTURES\n\nThe restauranteur has a bit of a reputation as a ladies man - in fact, in a 2002 New York Times profile on “Eurotrash” jet-setters, he was described as a university student who “summers on the Riviera, spends winter vacations in St Barts and took a year off just to party”.\n\nBut it's worth remembering, Cheryl fans, that Jean-Bernard was only 21 when the profile was written - and the savvy businessman, who is busy promoting his restaurant Cosy Box, definitely seems to have grown up since then.\n\nEither way, he definitely seems to be making Cheryl happy. From spoiling her with SEVEN bouquets on her birthday, to 'wooing her with food' (her stepfather claimed: \"the way to her heart must be through her stomach. Through a little cafe, wherever it was in France.\"), he's put a smile on her face.\n\nREAD: SHOULD YOU CHANGE YOUR SURNAME AFTER MARRIAGE? FIND OUT WHAT THESE CELEBS DID...\n\nWhich is why, on the day she got married, she posted this image on Instagram.\n\n'Without the rain, there would be no rainbow.'\n\nClearly a reference to her less than happy romantic history, Cheryl seems to be insinuating that all of the heartbreak - even Ashley Cole - was worth it, because it led her to Jean-Bernard.\n\nAll together now? N'aww.\n\nNo wonder they rushed off to Mustique, with just four guests, to get married.\n\nA source told The Sun: “Only a handful of people knew. She’s never been so happy. Cheryl’s madly in love and had no fear about taking the plunge.\n\n\"She’s delighted he’s her new husband and wants to have his babies. It’s a beautiful thing. She’s on cloud nine right now.”\n\nREAD: CHERYL COLE DELETES TWITTER ACCOUNT, SUGGESTING SHE WILL TAKE HER NEW HUSBAND'S NAME\n\nWe guess we'll have to wait and see what happens next, won't we? There are plenty of baby rumours swirling around, after all..."
