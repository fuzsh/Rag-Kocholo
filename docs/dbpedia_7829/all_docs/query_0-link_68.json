        "text": "We were wondering when her beauty was going to get some large scale recognition.\n\nSinger and X-Factor judge Cheryl Cole who now goes by Cheryl Fernandez-Versini is the UK’s top beauty icon for 2014. The survey by Superdrug is conducted every year and has had the Dutchess, Kate Middleton as its top beauty icon since 2011.\n\nCheryl had an incredible year as she not only made a return to the hit talent show, but had a chart-topping album – Only Human – and married husband Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini.\n\nAccording to a Superdrug spokesperson; “Our customers definitely take their cues from Cheryl, she’s a natural beauty not afraid to try the latest beauty trends and always looks completely polished“. “In fact our customers are so inspired by her that her debut perfume, launched earlier this year, has already secured itself as our number three bestselling celebrity scent.“.\n\nThe list sees Kate Middleton now occupying the 2nd spot with Michelle Keegan, Holly Wiloughby, Angelina Jolie, Dame Helen Mirren, Emma Watson, Beyonce, Nicole Scherzinger and Jennifer Lawrence making up the top 20."
