        "text": "Cheryl Fernandez-Versini is to divorce her French husband after 18 months of marriage, according to reports today.\n\nThe X Factor judge is said to have begun formal legal proceedings by filing paperwork which cites irreconcilable differences between her and partner Jean-Bernard.\n\nBut they are determined to remain close friends, reports the Sunday Mirror .\n\nAn insider told the newspaper: \"In the end Cheryl realised she had married too soon and had been swept away by a bit of a whirlwind romance.\n\n\"Over time it became clear to each of them that they were very different people and from very different worlds.\n\n\"They are now focusing on making sure they stay friends. The divorce is amicable and they have both said they will always be there for each other.\"\n\nThe couple, who married on the island of Mustique in July 2014 three months after they met in Cannes, were last seen together in public in October – hand-in-hand at the joint 40th birthday bash for I’m A Celeb hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly.\n\nWhen speculation emerged about their marriage, Jean-Bernard made a public statement in support of the former Girls Aloud star, insisting he would \"put my life on the line\" for her.\n\nThe nightclub and restaurant entrepreneur wrote on his Instagram page: “What matters is family and my wife is my only one left so if she needs me I am always going to be there. My wife Cheryl is my priority, nothing else.”\n\nCheryl has hinted at optimism for the New Year, revealing to fans with the last week that she plans to get back in the recording studio to start work on her next album.\n\nShe was previously married to footballer Ashley Cole. She filed for divorce in 2010 after four years of marriage after reports he'd cheated on her."
