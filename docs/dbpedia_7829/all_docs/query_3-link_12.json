        "text": "X Factor judge Cheryl Fernandez-Versini will not be part of the show when it returns later this year.\n\nShe's the latest change to the line-up after fellow judge Nick Grimshaw said he was leaving the show as well.\n\nPresenters Olly Murs and Caroline Flack will also be replaced by Dermot O'Leary who's returning after a year away.\n\n\"I've missed making music. I have had such an amazing experience being a judge on The X Factor,\" the former Girls Aloud singer said in a statement.\n\n\"I have learnt so much and enjoyed nurturing talent but I've missed making music and am excited to be recording again.\n\n\"I want to thank everybody I have worked with along the way, especially Simon who I love to bits.\"\n\nIn response Simon Cowell has said: \"Cheryl and myself spoke about this. I totally understand her commitment to making more records.\n\n\"In the near future we will be working on other things together.\"\n\nIt's not the first time Cheryl has left The X Factor.\n\nShe was a judge on the UK version of the show between 2008 and 2010.\n\nAn X Factor spokesman said: \"Cheryl has been a great judge and mentor during her time on the X Factor, from her early years of winning with two of her acts - Alexandra Burke and Joe McElderry - through to last year's series where she took Reggie N Bollie into the final.\n\n\"We'd like to thank Cheryl for her contribution to the show and wish her all the best with her return to music.\"\n\nCheryl was also briefly unveiled as a judge on the US version, before being publically sacked by Simon Cowell.\n\nFollowing that public spat she returned to the UK version in 2014.\n\nIn February, Nick Grimshaw told listeners to his Radio 1 Breakfast Show that he'd decided to step down because of the busy filming schedule.\n\nHe joked: \"You can't have a curry when you're on it on a Saturday night because you're there.\n\n\"What's really good about X Factor is watching it at your house with your friends [and] having a curry.\n\n\"When you're there, there's no curry. Simon promised me curry.\"\n\nITV recently confirmed The X Factor would continue \"into 2017 and beyond\".\n\nIt's not clear if fellow 2015 judge Rita Ora will return, but there are reports producers of rival show The Voice are trying to get her to make a move.\n\nThere have been rumours Simon is lining up Louis Tomlinson to have a role on the X Factor when it returns.\n\nIt's also been claimed two of the show's original judges Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh could make a return this year.\n\n4. According to the Official Charts Company, they had a total of four UK number ones and 21 UK Top 10s.\n\n5. In 2009 they announced they were taking a short break but reunited in 2012 for their 10th anniversary.\n\n6. In March 2013, after their final concert in Liverpool, they announced on Twitter that they were splitting up for good.\n\n7. Cheryl launched a successful solo career and has released four solo albums: 3 Words, Messy Little Raindrops, A Million Lights and Only Human.\n\n8. According to her Official Charts Company page, she remains the first female British solo artist to have had five number one singles.\n\n9. The 32-year-old joined The X Factor as a judge in 2008 and during that time she mentored two winners - Alexandra Burke and Joe McElderry. She left the show in 2010 before rejoining in 2014.\n\n10. Following her X Factor return in 2014, she went on to mentor last year's runner-ups, Reggie N Bollie.\n\nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat, external and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat"
