        "text": "The ex-Girls Aloud singer and former X Factor judge has announced she now wants to be known as just Cheryl.\n\nIt's probably safest all round to be honest.\n\nHer maiden name has negative connotations as it was under this moniker that she was convicted of a nightclub assault.\n\nShe was delighted when she dropped Tweedy in favour of her married name Cole - until footballer Ashley started playing around and she was forced to bin another name.\n\nThat was the first time she attempted to be called just Cheryl, but nobody really took any notice.\n\nThe X Factor warm up artist was in for a serious telling off when he accidentally dropped the C word - Cole - into his act.\n\nCommentators and presenters the world over cringed when Cheryl married again and took the name Fernandez-Versini, but that phase was short-lived.\n\nThe problem is I'm not sure she's worthy of a mononymous moniker.\n\nAdmittedly, there aren't all that many Cheryls in the world of showbiz. She probably won't get mixed up with Cheryl Baker of Bucks Fizz and Record Breakers fame or Charlie's Angel Cheryl Ladd.\n\nBut she's no Adele, Beyonce or Kylie. She can't quite live up to Lulu or Madonna's billing\n\nStill we'll willingly grant her request for one name status. Until One Direction's Liam Payne takes her up the aisle that is."
