From hereon in, she will be known as Cheryl.\n\n“This time around, everyone is under strict instructions that she is just Cheryl, nothing else. Organisers at next month’s event were told that all announcements of her attendance should only refer to her as Cheryl.”\n\nDesperate Housewives star Eva Longoria, 41, will present the Geordie star with the gong, which recognises her work with Cheryl’s Trust.\n\nCheryl, above with her estranged husband, has denied claims she was seeing One Direction star Liam Payne, 22, before her two-year marriage to Jean-Bernard had broken down."
