        "text": "It may be hard to remember now since she just welcomed a baby with Liam Payne, but Cheryl was once married to Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini.\n\nIn fact, the French restaurant owner doesn't really think about that time in his life much either, except when he's asked about it for an interview, obviously.\n\nSpeaking to The Mirror, Fernandez-Versini said: \"I married someone who was famous, I was thrust into this mad world – I didn't like it.\n\n\"There was really awful things said about me, about my family, but I feel like I survived it. And I'm here surviving, doing my thing.\n\n\"It's been two years – I feel like a different person. That was the old me.\"\n\nHe also isn't bothered about Cheryl having a baby with someone else, adding: \"If someone I used to be with goes on to have another boyfriend or have children, that's good for them, I wish them well – but I'm not going to think about it.\n\n\"When I'm not with someone I don't think about them. Right now I'm focused on work.\n\n\"I'm in love with my restaurant. I've married it, I'm sleeping with it, I'm living it.\"\n\nWell, at least it sounded like this interview was a lot less awkward than JB's one with Richard Arnold on Good Morning Britain this week.\n\n[Cheryl and Liam Payne's baby]\n\nCheryl and her partner Liam Payne welcomed their baby, named Bear, in March after months of intense speculation.\n\nSpeaking of names, it was recently revealed that Cheryl has legally reverted her surname back to Tweedy, after being known as Cheryl Cole and then Cheryl Fernandez-Versini."
