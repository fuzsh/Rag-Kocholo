I respect and admire that,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I'm getting destroyed on twitter by the @CherylOfficial fans… I got the name wrong… I apologised. Let's all move one.\"\n\nHe later replied to a user directly, writing: \"I'm the warm up… She is the star.. She had every right to 'Put me in my place' I did apologise - I made a mistake.\"\n\nSimon Cowell's best friend Sinitta also spoke about never using cheryl's former surname during a chat on the Xtra Factor, revealing that \"Cole\" is banned from use anywhere in the X Factor studios.\n\n\"Do not use C-word in this building, the four letter C-word, Cole,\" the former Eighties singer said.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They had been married for four years.\n\nThe former Girls Aloud star went on to surprise the nation when she secretly wed Frenchman Jean-Bernard in a secret ceremony a few months ago, after just three months of dating."
