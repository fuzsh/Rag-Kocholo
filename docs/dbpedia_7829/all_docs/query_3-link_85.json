        "text": "Just days after The Sun’s explosive report which revealed 32-year-old Cheryl Fernandez-Versini was secretly dating 22-year-old Liam Payne, the pair have confirmed their unexpected romance with a loved-up selfie.\n\nOvernight, Liam changed his Instagram profile picture to a shot of him and the former Girls Aloud star cuddling up in bed.\n\nIn the cute black-and-white snap Cheryl, whose second marriage ended last year, holds up the peace sign to her eyes while Liam’s head touches hers and the pair both smoulder into the lens.\n\nHis Instagram bio has also been updated to simply read: “Happy.”\n\nIt comes as the pair were spotted doing the groceries at a local shopping centre in Guilford hours after the report broke.\n\nThe twitter account @Je_Baker uploaded a picture of the pair browsing the pet aisle, already the picture of domestic bliss!\n\nMeanwhile telling footage from the 2015 X Factor finale in the UK, where One Direction gave their last performance before their hiatus, has surfaced showing the duo sharing a sneaky smooch and hug.\n\nAccording to The Sun, Liam is “madly in love” with Cheryl, who is ten years his senior, and the pair have been in a clandestine romance for around three months.\n\nCheryl was previously married to soccer pro Ashley Cole and they split in 2010. In 2014, she shocked the world by marrying French businessman Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini after just three months, only to separate last August.\n\nWhile Liam ended a relationship with his long-term girlfriend Sophia Smith last October."
