Welcome to the Lifesaving Society:

Water Safety Training & Education in BC & Yukon

The BC & Yukon Branch of the Lifesaving Society (aka Royal Life Saving Society Canada) is a non-for-profit organization committed to the prevention of drowning and aquatic-related injury through water safety education.

In addition to providing lifesaving, lifeguarding courses and first aid/CPR training throughout BC and Yukon, the Society is a leader in offering expertise and guidance to ensure safe operation of any water-related setting through safety management services.

Lifesaving Sport is another aspect of the Society that is the only sport developed from an origin of humanitarian purposes. Jr. Lifeguard Clubs are a fun and easy start for youth that can lead to the ultimate pursuit of international competition; fitness, sport and saving lives combined.

Be Watersmart

The Lifesaving Societyâ€™s WaterSmart public education campaign includes year-round information on safe activity in and around water as well as seasonal outreach such as the WaterWise Team, National Drowning Prevention Week in July, AdventureSmart Teams and Swim to Survive training; all part of ensuring everyone can safely enjoy our beautiful waterways without incident.
