International calls for action have identified the need to better understand the implementation of drowning prevention interventions so that intervention design and implementation is improved. In high-income countries (HICs), interventions are sophisticated but still little is known or written about their implementation. The review was registered on PROSPERO (number CRD42022347789) and followed the PRISMA guidelines. Eight databases were searched. Articles were assessed using the Public Health Ontario Meta-tool for quality appraisal of public health evidence. Forty-nine articles were included. Where ERIC strategies were reported, the focus was on evaluative and iterative strategies, developing partnerships and engaging the target group. The review identified few articles that discussed intervention development and implementation sufficiently for strategies to be replicated. Findings will inform further research into the use and measurement of implementation strategies by practitioners and researchers undertaking work in drowning prevention in HICs and supports a call to action for better documentation of implementation in public health interventions.\n\nKeywords: systematic review, implementation science, implementation strategies, Expert Recommendation for Implementing Change (ERIC), drowning, downing prevention interventions, high-income countries\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe generation and use of knowledge is critical for evidence-informed public health practice. There is recognition of the need to address the challenges that hinder closing the “know–do” gap in public health implementation [1,2]. Implementation science seeks to address these barriers using methods and strategies that facilitate the uptake of evidence-based practice and research into regular use by practitioners and policymakers [3]. There are several considerations inherent in this sentiment. When interventions are assessed as being effective, if others do not utilise them, they will not become widely accepted [4]. Intervention implementation requires active consideration to ensure that programs are deployed with and into communities more efficiently and effectively.\n\nA range of frameworks and tools have been developed to guide implementation, for example, the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) [5] and Theoretical Domains Framework [6]. Common to these frameworks is the use of domains and constructs to explain and measure implementation and describe the interplay of the intervention content and context to effect behaviour change. However, there are few frameworks specific to public health [1,7], despite growing interest in the use and impact of implementation science for public health interventions [7,8,9,10]. The Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) project identified nine concepts and 73 strategies that aid in the development [11] of implementation strategies and can serve as a tool to assess the strategies used in implementation. This tool was initially designed for a clinical setting [11,12]; it has been refined and used to reflect public health practice within a community setting [7]. There are examples of implementation science being used in some health and community settings [7,11,13] across mental health [4,11,12,14,15] and substance use [16]. However, in other public health areas, such as drowning prevention, which is the case study for this review, the application of implementation science is limited [7].\n\nDrowning is a leading cause of unintentional injury [17,18], resulting in over 2.5 million deaths worldwide over the last decade [19]. Drowning is a complex global public health issue with different drivers across low-, middle- and high-income contexts [20,21,22,23]. In HICs, drowning events tend to occur during recreational activities [17,24] around the water and around the home [25]. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), there is a higher prevalence of children drowning close to home due to issues of supervision, barriers to water sources and water safety skills, while older children and adults drown when undertaking work or during travel on water [21,26]. While there is evidence of community-led interventions [22,23] and institutional guidance around effective strategies to reduce drowning [27], the literature also highlights gaps in the quality, consistency and reporting of programs [22,23,28]. There are also differences in the number of drowning prevention-related peer-reviewed publications published [22,23] and the types of interventions [29] relevant for LMICs compared to HICs. Of the limited published interventions from LMICs, most were delivered by agencies without the capacity to include large-scale evaluation or knowledge translation [17,23]; thus, implementation in the two settings (HIC and LMIC) is not directly applicable [29].\n\nConsequently, there have been international calls for action to establish processes to better understand the implementation of drowning prevention interventions in community settings [19,26,30] and several resources have been developed to aid in the implementation of drowning prevention interventions [31,32,33]. However, these resources have concentrated on the activities of interventions (e.g., the WHO implementation guide focusses on ten evidence-based interventions and strategies [31]) rather than the process of implementation and tend to be conducted in LMICs. In HICs, there is a growing focus on the use of evidence to strengthen the design, delivery and evaluation of interventions [23], with calls for practitioners and researchers to learn from each other [26]. Recent advancements in the publication of more sophisticated approaches to the development of drowning prevention interventions [23] lend themselves to further exploration of context of intervention implementation.\n\nThis systematic review aims to identify drowning prevention studies undertaken in HICs as a public health case study of implementation science and describe and assess the use of implementation science ERIC concepts and strategies. The review asks:\n\nWhat are the implementation strategies used in drowning prevention interventions in high-income countries and how are they described?\n\nWhat are the gaps in the use and reporting of implementation strategies in drowning prevention interventions in high-income countries?\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\nThis systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [34] and registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (ID CRD42022347789) [35]. The search strategy for included articles and the PRISMA checklists for abstracts and manuscripts were completed (Supplementary Tables S1, S2 and S3, respectively).\n\n2.1. Criteria for Inclusion\n\nIncluded articles were primary studies, addressed drowning prevention interventions in HICs, were written in English and were published between 2002 and 2022 (see ). HICs are defined as economies with a gross national income (GNI) of USD12,696 or more per capita [36]. Exclusion criteria included articles that focus on clinical aspects of drowning events; specific target groups or locations not relevant to the wider population (i.e., those with water phobia, working on specific construction sites); simulation studies (i.e., studies of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or rescue delivery in specific settings) or other injury prevention (i.e., not solely drowning prevention). Articles addressing the development of recommendations and/or guidelines, where no intervention was described, were also excluded.\n\nTable 1\n\nInclusion CriteriaExclusion CriteriaPrimary studiesClinical managementConducted in HICsGuideline and recommendation developmentDrowning prevention interventionNot relevant to the wider population (i.e., involves specific target group or location) Written in EnglishOther injury focusPublished between 2002 and 2022Epidemiological focus\n\n2.2. Search Strategy\n\nIn consultation with the university health sciences faculty librarian, the initial literature search strategy was developed using medical subject heading (MESH) and text words related to implementation and drowning prevention. Once an initial Medline search was completed, the strategy was adapted to the subject headings of seven additional databases (see Supplementary Table S1 for full search strategy): PubMed, PsycINFO, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, Global health and SPORTDiscus.\n\n2.3. Screening and Quality Appraisal\n\nThe initial database search identified 3547 articles. All citations from the initial search were imported into Endnote 20 [37] referencing management software. Using the Endnote and Rayyan software [38] “find duplicates” tool, 1539 articles were removed. Two reviewers (MDB and BR) individually screened the identified articles by title and abstract using Rayyan [38] to determine the relevance of the remaining articles (n = 1515). Articles were categorized as “possibly relevant”, “maybe” (where the reviewer was unsure if the article met the criteria) and “excluded”. The systematic review PRISMA 2020 flow diagram [34] is presented in .\n\nArticles identified as “maybe” during the title and abstract search were re-classified through discussion amongst two research team members (MDB and BR) and. where there was disagreement, with a third member of the team (JL). The full text articles identified as “possibly relevant” were retrieved and assessed by one reviewer (MDB) using a standardized exclusion list. A second researcher (BR) randomly cross-checked 10% of articles to identify any selection anomalies. Any full-text articles classified as “maybe” were resolved with a co-author (GC). To ensure coverage, the reference lists of “possible inclusion” articles (n = 104) were hand-searched for any articles not previously identified; 22 further articles were identified (see ).\n\nAll included articles (n = 49) were assessed for quality using the Public Health Ontario Meta-tool for quality appraisal of public health evidence (PHO META QAT) [39] by one reviewer (BR). Another reviewer (MDB) randomly cross-checked 10% of the appraisals to ensure accuracy. Articles were analysed and scored using four domains (relevance, reliability, validity and applicability) containing nine categories [40] and were scored as met the criteria = 2, not sure/unclear = 1 and did not meet the criteria = 0. As in previous reviews [23], articles were categorized on their summed score, where ≤9 = low quality (n = 11), 10–14 = medium quality (n = 17) and 15–18 = high quality (n = 21). All 49 articles met the criteria for inclusion based on the quality appraisal.\n\n2.4. Outcome Measure (Implementation)\n\nIncluded drowning prevention intervention articles were assessed for inclusion using the refined Expert Recommendations of Implementing Change (ERIC) project concepts and strategies for use in community settings [7,11,41]. Refinement was made to the criteria by the first author (MDB). Changes are described in Supplementary Table S4. In summary, refinements included terminology changes to reflect drowning prevention “interventions” in place of “clinical innovations” [11], “target group and support networks” in place of “patient/consumers and families” [11] or “priority populations” [7], and “providers” in place of “clinicians” [11]. These modifications were verified with a practitioner with over 10 years’ experience in the drowning prevention sector. The final list of nine ERIC concepts and 73 strategies are described in . The nine concepts include: c1 use evaluative and iterative strategies, c2 provide iterative assistance, c3 adapt and tailor context, c4 develop partner relationships, c5 train and educate stakeholders, c6 support providers, c7 engage target group, c8 financial strategies and c9 change infrastructure.\n\nTable 2\n\nConcepts and StrategiesDefinitionIdentifierCONCEPT 1: Use evaluative and iterative strategiesc1Assess for readiness and identify barriers and facilitatorsAssess various aspects of an organization to determine its degree of readiness to implement, barriers that may impede implementation and strengths that can be used in the implementation effort.c1_01Audit and provide feedbackCollect and summarize intervention performance data over a specified time period and give it to providers and administrators to monitor, evaluate and modify provider behaviour.c1_02Conduct cyclical small tests of changeImplement changes in a cyclical fashion using small tests of change before taking changes system-wide.
