        "text": "Australia is widely recognised as an international leader in surf lifesaving. We have partnerships with countries worldwide to provide advice and support that could build the capability of lifesavers and clubs. The Japan Exchange Program, a significant initiative between Surf Life Saving Australia and the Japan Lifesaving Association, is designed to broaden the horizons of participants. It not only enhances local safety management but also plays a crucial role in preventing drowning on Japanese beaches, making your participation invaluable. Lifesavers from Waratah Beach SLSC, Port Campbell SLSC, and Apollo Bay SLSC have joined their WA, SA, and QLD counterparts in Japan until mid-August as part of two programs to assist with educating Japanese junior high school students on basic water safety and survival or to join patrol activities at local surf lifesaving clubs in the Izu Peninsula. üì∏ Courtesy of SLSA\n\nThe Victorian Professional Pool Lifeguard Challenge is back, and Glen Eira Sports and Aquatic Centre (GESAC) are ready to defend their crown! üëë Lifeguard teams from 21 aquatic facilities from all around Victoria will vie for the accolade of LSV Pool Lifeguard Challenge champion as they compete at Melbourne Sports & Aquatic Centre next week. The LSV Pool Lifeguard Challenge aims to test lifeguard skills, promoting proficiency and readiness through rigorous, realistic scenarios, supported by members of Victoria‚Äôs Emergency Services, volunteer actors, and LSV‚Äôs Lifeguard Trainers and Assessors. Member of the 2024 winning team at GESAC Samara Keifer, is excited to return for the highlight of her year. ‚ÄúIt is great to see so many of our lifeguards step up and become skilled in their roles,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúA highlight of my time at Glen Eira Leisure is being involved in the LSV Lifeguard Challenge. Last year I was proud to see our Carnegie Swimming Pool team compete at the LSV Lifeguard Challenge. As a junior team, all of them grew exponentially in both skills and confidence.‚Äô Growing up in the salty air of Bayside Melbourne as a member of Half Moon Bay Lifesaving Club, it is no wonder that Samara found her way into a career in the aquatic industry. Samara is now studying Sports Management part-time while working full-time as an Operations Team Leader at Glen Eira Sports and Aquatic Centre (GESAC), and next week she hopes their team will take out the Pool Lifeguards Challenge for the third time! GESAC Georgie Wark said winning the LSV Lifeguard Challenge was an incredible achievement for their team, 'Participating in the Lifeguard Challenge fostered a sense of camaraderie and teamwork. It validated the hard work and dedication we put into our training programs. The victory showcased our teamwork, determination, and technical skills. Additionally, it boosted the morale of our lifeguard team, instilling a sense of pride and achievement.\" The Life Saving Victoria Pool Lifeguard Challenge kicks off at Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre, 25 July 2024.\n\nWe're on a mission to educate our community about water safety and build the confidence of people learning to swim. üèä‚ôÄÔ∏è Lisa, Huy, and Zarli are instructors in our Education team. They are making a real difference in the lives of many, and you can, too. Lisa was blessed to be a stay-at-home mum to three active boys. When her boys were old enough to start their tertiary schooling and careers, Lisa searched for an opportunity to work around her small business. Huy is studying for a Bachelor of Criminology and Psychological Science while working at local swim centres during winter. Zarli spends her summer holidays in Cobram, visiting her parents in between studying for a Bachelor of Media and Communications. The flexibility of the role, the opportunity to learn new skills, and the opportunity to teach people of all ages how to be safe in and around the water made this the perfect role. For Lisa, it gave her the confidence to take up the challenge. \"Every shift is a team-building exercise. And you are at the beach! Confidence, public speaking, adaptability, teamwork, organisational skills, flexibility, leadership. The list goes on. The friendships are the cherry on top.\" The job was perfect for Huy because it fit his university hours, and he could see that it made a lasting difference in people's lives. Zarli can go home for the summer with a source of income, educate the people of her hometown on the Murray River, and build further employment opportunities that align with her university degree. It doesn't matter if you are a student, empty nester, or retiree; the flexibility of Education Instructors fits any lifestyle. If you‚Äôre looking for a flexible opportunity to teach and beach, check the comments for more details. üëá"
