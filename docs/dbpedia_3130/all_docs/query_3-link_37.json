        "meta_description": "My name is Grace Hamilton. I am in third year at Southern Cross University studying Nutrition and Complementary Medicine. I also work for the Australian Lifeguard Service as an ocean lifeguard and Trainer Assessor of first aid for a national company. This January, I have been selected to travel to Chile, to spend three weeks training and educating locals to improve their first aid and rescue techniques. I have been offered an incredible opportunity on the non-profit '2015 Chile Lifeguard Exchange program' with the International Surf Lifesaving Association. I have the privilege of being the only Australian selected for this program and will be travelling with three other lifeguards from the United Kingdom and United States of America. Our aim it to teach new rescue techniques, educate locals on first aid and offer our services as lifeguards and trainers for the duration of the trip. Although the wonderful Chile community and International Surf Lifesaving Association are assisting with some costs such as accommodation there are still out of pocket expenses that need to address these include flights, travel, food and insurance. My proposal is that any monetary donations could be made to this page or to get in contact with myself through ghamilton@live.com.au that will assist with the cost of this non-profit Lifeguard volunteer program. Every contribution will be used entirely for the purpose of the 2015 Lifeguard Exchange Program.We are also arranging any suitable equipment to take over to donate to the local communities. There is a large shortage of wetsuits for children, proper protective eyewear and other appropriate protective equipment. We will be visiting a lifeguard program that works with children in Valparaiso that is always in need of children's wetsuits. My passion is first aid and water rescues. All my life I have grown up around the ocean. Volunteering with Surf lifesaving for over six years, volunteering to teach first aid through Surf Lifesaving Club and being a professional ocean lifeguard for five years. I want to educate everyone to eliminate fear when around water environments and have a better knowledge towards how to handle first aid situations. Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope I will have a chance to talk with you soon. Kind regards, Grace",
