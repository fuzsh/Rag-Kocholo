        "text": "Today was the last day of the Jersey Mike's Subs USLA National Lifeguard Championships in South Padre Island, TX. Competitors from around the nation worked hard all week, testing their skills in events in the ocean and on the sand designed to promote camaraderie among competitors, coaches, and families in attendance. Thank you to all those who participated in the week’s events for your hard work and determination, and congratulations to the 2024 National Champions Sussex County, (DE). Look forward to our official recap post with results coming soon. All Championship information, including results, will be posted at USLA.org/nationals. Photography by: Leal Media #usla #lifeguardsforlife\n\nDid you know that despite being the first line of defense in life-threatening ocean rescues, most open-water lifeguards in the U.S. are not recognized as first responders? It’s time to change that. In partnership with the USLA for the “LIFEGUARDS FIRST” campaign, FOX’s new drama series #RescueHISurf highlights the heroic actions of lifeguards who patrol and protect life at sea. Together, we are supporting the “LIFEGUARDS FIRST” campaign. This important letter-writing initiative aims to grant open-water lifeguards the benefits and recognition of Emergency First Responders. Take a stand today! Visit RHSFirstResponders.com and let your voice be heard. Your support can ensure that lifeguards receive the same recognition and benefits as their counterparts in police, fire, and EMS services. Share this message and spread the word. Every letter counts in our mission to secure the benefits and recognition that lifeguards deserve. And once the hard work is done, relax and tune into the premiere of #RescueHISurf on September 22 on @foxtv to see the thrilling lives of lifeguards portrayed like never before! #LifeguardsFirst #SupportHCR41 #USLA\n\nCompetitors brought their all on day two of the Jersey Mike's USLA National Lifeguard Championships in South Padre Island, TX.

The USLA sends a sincere THANK YOU to all lifeguards working around the world to reduce the incidence of death and injury in the aquatic environment. Lifeguards do much more than perform rescues. They educate the public, perform preventative actions, adhere to national standards, train vigorously to maintain a high level of readiness, and more. Wherever a lifeguard may be working, the environment is a safer place because of their presence. Be sure to thank your local lifeguard(s) today, and remember – always swim near a lifeguard!
