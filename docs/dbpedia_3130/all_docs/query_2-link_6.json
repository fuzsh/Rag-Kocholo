        "text": "The International Surfing Association (ISA)\n\nSAFETY GUIDELINES\n\nThe International Surfing Association (ISA) affiliated surf schools must follow this list of safety guidelines:\n\nCoach to student ratio is 1–8 in optimum conditions.\n\nArrive early to inspect conditions and consult with the lifeguard\n\nCollect the participant list, disclaimers, and contact phone numbers at the start of the lesson.\n\nAllocate an appropriate softboard to each participant and demonstrate the correct way to carry the board and surf leash\n\nEach participant must wear a high-visibility yellow rash guard during the lesson to help identify the surfing class.\n\nEnsure there is a mobile phone, a whistle, a First Aid kit, and a rescue board on the beach nearby\n\nEach lesson must include a surf safety talk covering current conditions and hazards.\n\nClearly state the aims of the lesson at the start of the class.\n\nEnsure enough distance separates each group to eliminate the chance of group members getting mixed up in the water.\n\nStructure group, so there is a constant vision and observation of every participant.\n\nStructure the lesson in side drift (sweep) cases so participants drift toward the instructor.\n\nInstruct surfers to follow the principles of one surfer per wave\n\nKeep a safe distance between each other to avoid collisions.\n\nEnsure the recall and assistance required signals are reinforced and correctly responded to at the start of each lesson\n\nEach skill must be taught on the beach and then in the water by the coach or an experienced assistant.\n\nPosition participants to enable them to view the demonstration.\n\nThe teaching methodology must follow: explanation –demonstration – participation – feedback.\n\nUse cues to emphasize important parts of the skill\n\nRegularly reinforce the recall signal.\n\nParticipants must be competent at negotiating the surf, catching waves, and changing direction in the prone position before attempting the prone-to-feet surfing skill.\n\nRegular beach skill practice improves correct skills and provides a needed recovery period for surfers.\n\nNever leave a group in the water unaccompanied for any reason. Recall the whole group to shore – then resolve the issue.\n\nAfter the lesson, regroup, check numbers, review the session, seek assistance to pack up, and then dismiss the group as one.\n\nAll accidents, even minor incidents, must be reported instantly to the head coach and recorded on the accident report form."
