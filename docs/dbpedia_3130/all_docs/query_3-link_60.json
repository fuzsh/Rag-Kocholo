        "text": "A hard-working volunteer surf lifeguard who also counts mentoring, fund-raising and educating people about sea lion protection among the myriad tasks she does for the club, has been nominated for an Otago University Blues and Golds Outstanding Member of the Dunedin Community Award.\n\nLast summer Maddy Ozanne spent 96 hours volunteering as a lifeguard as well as completing a multitude of other duties at the Warrington Surf Life Saving Club.\n\nThe second-year Bachelor of Applied Science tauira’s lifeguarding prowess was recognised this year when she won the 2022/2023 season Lifeguard of the Year Award for her “outstanding contributions” to the season.\n\n“I think lifeguarding is so important and encourage anyone who loves the beach to give it a try,” says Maddy.\n\nAssociate Dean of the College of Education, Dr Naomi Ingram, , a fellow member of the Warrington Surf Life Saving Club community, says Maddy is a “special individual” whose mahi and care deserves recognition.\n\n“She is one of the leaders of our surf lifesaving community. Despite only being 19-years-old, she leads our patrol teams of people much older than herself, ensuring we are trained, resourced and ready to keep the Warrington beach safe throughout the summer.\n\n“She has an excellent sense of self, she is creative, warm, flexible and fair.”\n\nFormer chairperson of the Warrington Surf Club Charlotte Becconsall also says Maddy goes “above and beyond” in her role as a mentor to the younger members of the club.\n\n“Her willingness to support and guide them in learning about beach safety makes a huge difference to our club and wider community.\n\n“She serves as a positive role model, encouraging the next generation to follow in her footsteps and contribute meaningfully to our community.”\n\nMaddy’s sister, Phoebe Ozanne describes her as “a vibrant and passionate member of the Club, and by extension, the Warrington community”.\n\nPhoebe says her sister’s community-building endeavours range from wood chopping events to post-season clean-ups.\n\n“Maddy is present at and organises events from wood chopping and sausage sizzle fundraisers to the annual Christmas party.\n\n“She spent the entirety of a rainy week creating a huge photo memories wall to celebrate the club’s community and achievements.”\n\nHer sister also says Maddy works closely with the Department of Conservation Sealion Programme, educating the public on the correct etiquette and ensuring the safety of the sea lions and pups throughout the patrol season.\n\nThe Blues and Golds awards aim to recognise the sporting and cultural excellence of University of Otago students and OUSA affiliated clubs and societies.\n\nThe ceremony will be held on Monday, 11 September in the Otago Business School Atrium.\n\n~Kōrero by Alice Billington"
