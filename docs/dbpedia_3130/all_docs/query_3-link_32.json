        "text": "Paul Stokes, Ocean Warriors' founder and head coach, boasts over two decades of experience as a professional Surf lifeguard and a deep passion for ocean, water safety, surf lifesaving, and surf sports. He held key roles, including National Examiner for Life Saving South Africa. Paul began his journey as a young enthusiast, moving up from Nippers to Senior levels and working as a lifeguard since the age of sixteen.\n\n​\n\nAfter becoming a Professional Lifeguard in Durban, he advanced to Senior Lifeguard, overseeing prominent beaches. Paul earned certifications as a Crewman, Driver, Instructor, and Examiner for Inshore Rescue Boat and Jet Ski as well as South African Surf Lifesaving Association. He also holds advanced first aid and resuscitation qualifications, along with an \"Ambulance Crewman\" certification. Paul has a footprint in Surf Lifesaving in the UAE, UK, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.\n\n​\n\nPaul's international experience as a surf/beach lifeguard and his efforts in establishing exchange programs further reflect his dedication. He has assembled a skilled team to deliver high-quality programs, emphasising safety for all at Ocean Warriors Surf Lifesaving Club.\n\nKerry Segal, a dedicated coach at Ocean Warriors, has a profound love for paddling, canoeing, and kayaking. She proudly represented South Africa in both Sprint and Marathon kayaking at numerous World Championship events. Her standout achievement was participating in the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore in 2010.\n\n​\n\nKerry continued her pursuit of sports by studying for a BSc Sport Science degree at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. Post-graduation, she ventured into yachting, working as a sports massage therapist and stewardess while also obtaining qualifications as a medical officer for yachts. Now based in Dubai, Kerry focuses on her role as a Sports Massage Therapist and has recently achieved her Canoe/Kayaking level 3 coaching certification from the International Canoe Federation (ICF). Her passion for watersports drives her to share her knowledge and experiences with young enthusiasts, inspiring them to create their own joyful memories in and on the water.\n\nMeet Gigi, our all-round water enthusiast and expert extraordinaire. With a background in diving, a passion for watersports, and a talent for swim coaching, Gigi is always in her element in the water. Whether it's beneath the waves or on the surface, Gigi thrives, and you'll rarely find her on dry land. Hailing from the coastal beauty of South Africa and now embracing the vibrant aquatic scene in the UAE, Gigi is living their best life in a world where every drop of water holds endless possibilities. With Gigi's expertise and boundless enthusiasm, you're in good hands for your aquatic adventures.\n\nHauke Schaberg, a devoted volunteer coach at Ocean Warriors, balances his roles as a father of two young Warriors and a dedicated sea lover. He's a \"wannabe beach boy,\" but an office job keeps him from fully embracing that dream. Hauke is enthusiastic about being part of the coaching crew and is driven by the desire to help everyone make the most of their experiences. His life philosophy is encapsulated in the phrase \"Life's a wave,\" signifying his belief in embracing life's dynamic nature. Hauke's love for the sea enriches the Ocean Warriors community, making him a valuable addition to the coaching team.\n\nAnt Brown, a valued volunteer coach at Ocean Warriors, embodies the club's commitment to inclusivity and diversity. In a sport where appearance may not always reflect expertise, Coach Ant stands as a testament to the belief that it's not about how one looks, but rather the passion, dedication, and belief in oneself that truly matter.\n\n​\n\nAnt is an all round sportsman having played, rugby, cricket, tennis and squash. He also enjoys his water sports like freediving and surkski paddling.\n\n​\n\nAs a member of the coaching team, Coach Ant defies stereotypes and challenges traditional perceptions of what a coach should look like. Ocean Warriors embraces this unconventional approach, emphasizing that coaching is driven by a genuine love for the sport and the desire to nurture talent.\n\nTom Loney, a dedicated volunteer coach at Ocean Warriors, originally hails from London and has now made the UAE his home. By day, he is a scientist, and in his own playful words, a \"mad\" professor, but during the serene early mornings or the tranquil hours before sunset, you'll likely find him engaged in various exhilarating beach and ocean activities.\n\n​\n\nTom's love for the beach and the sea is evident in his active lifestyle. He's a runner along the shoreline, a swimmer embracing the open waters, and an avid surf ski paddler venturing out into the vast ocean. For him, the beach and sea represent nature's ultimate playground, where endless opportunities for exploration, excitement, and adventure await.\n\n​\n\nIn his role as a volunteer coach at Ocean Warriors, Tom brings his passion for these outdoor pursuits to the forefront. He believes that the beach and sea offer a boundless canvas for learning new skills, forging lasting friendships, and, above all, having a great deal of fun. His infectious enthusiasm for this natural playground, coupled with his scientific acumen, makes him a remarkable addition to the coaching team.\n\nJurga Relyte, a dedicated volunteer coach at Ocean Warriors, originates in Lithuania and brings a diverse set of roles and passions to the coaching team. She is not only a devoted mom but also a teacher, a fitness enthusiast, and someone who thrives on an active and energetic lifestyle.\n\n​\n\nJurga's journey with Ocean Warriors began last Summer when she embarked on the lifeguard program alongside Coach Paul. Her decision to embrace this challenging and vital role reflects her adventurous spirit and her dedication to water safety and surf lifesaving.\n\n​\n\nBeing a part of the Ocean Warriors team holds a special place in Jurga's heart, as she considers it a true honor. The sense of pride she feels in contributing to such a wonderful and dynamic community is evident in her commitment to the program.\n\n​\n\nJurga's unique combination of experiences as a mom, teacher, fitness enthusiast, and active lifestyle advocate adds a vibrant and multifaceted dimension to the Ocean Warriors coaching crew. Her passion for the program, her commitment to the team, and her dedication to the principles of surf lifesaving make her an invaluable asset to the coaching staff, enriching the experiences of all those she works with.\n\nMeet Charlotte, our dedicated admin and social media enthusiast! After her upbringing in Dubai and graduating from Loughborough University in the UK, she's returned to the UAE. An avid Surfski paddler since last year, she relishes starting her day with an early morning paddle. When she's not assisting Ocean Warriors with registration or crafting engaging reels, she's actively involved in playing and coaching Netball, all while pursuing a Masters in Psychology. If you have any inquiries or need assistance with signing up, Charlotte is the friendly face you'll be in touch with."
