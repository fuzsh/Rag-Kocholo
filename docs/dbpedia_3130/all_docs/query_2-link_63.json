        "text": "IMPORTANT: Status Quo Corona, online and lifesaving courses\n\n1. Status Quo Corona:\n\nAt the moment we are not aware of any issues any more. We are constantly evaluating the situation in all course locations and are immediately informing all participants about any news. The applicable regulations are always met in all locations.\n\n2. Online courses:\n\nAustrian Surfing will neither run nor recognize 'online-only-courses'. While we acknowledge online courses as the first step of a new approach to reach and develop remote surf locations around the world, we do not support them in Europe. Our workplace is the ocean, where we are much more exposed to the forces of nature than in other professions. Conditions can change rapidly, as factors like tides, wind, new swell, marine life, pollution, other surfers, storms, etc. can change the sea from cosy to dangerous in no time. In our opinion the time spent together on the beach and in the ocean (as well as the theory lessons, presentations, working groups, etc. in the training room) is crucial to learn and internalize all knowledge and skills necessary to enable surf instructors to offer their course participants an at all times safe course with optimal learning progress. Moreover, we identified issues regarding work permits and legal matters.\n\n3. Lifesaving courses:\n\n- Whenever there is a high demand for refresher courses, we will offer these specifically for refreshers.\n\n- We are organising lifesaving courses to make sure that surfers who did their Level 1 / Level 2 instructor courses with us get the chance to do high quality lifesaving courses straight after our instructor courses. In general, these courses are not open for externals.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES are we accepting surfers who only did ONLINE surf instructor courses to our lifesaving courses as we are not jeopardizing our quality standards and the good reputation of our coaching program.\n\nWe wish everyone a safe journey and good luck with their training!"
