OMB Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 I. Executive Summary A ``100-word summary'' is available on https://www.regulations.gov. Elements of emergency responder (firefighters, emergency medical service providers, and technical search and rescuers) health and safety are currently regulated by OSHA primarily under a patchwork of hazard- specific standards, and by state regulations in states with OSHA- approved State plan programs. (While OSHA standards do not apply to volunteers, some volunteers are covered in states with OSHA-approved State plan programs.) All of the OSHA standards referred to above were promulgated decades ago, and none was designed as a comprehensive emergency response standard. Consequently, they do not address the full range of hazards currently facing emergency responders, nor do they reflect major changes in performance specifications for protective clothing and equipment or major improvements in safety and health practices that have already been accepted by the emergency response community and incorporated into industry consensus standards. Notably, the OSHA standards do not align with the Department of Homeland Security's National Incident Management System (NIMS), which guides all levels of government, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector to work together to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from emergency incidents. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, all government agencies, including OSHA, were directed to strengthen their preparedness to respond to terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies. In response to this direction, the agency reviewed its standards applicable to the safe conduct of emergency response and disaster recovery activities and identified gaps in the protections for emergency responders and disaster recovery workers. The agency subsequently published a Request for Information (RFI), using the Fire Brigades standard (29 CFR 1910.156) as a baseline for emergency response activities, to determine if it should proceed with updating and expanding the standard. Responses to the RFI generally supported the need for continued rulemaking; therefore, the agency worked with the National Advisory Committee for Occupational Safety and Health (NACOSH) to assemble a subcommittee of emergency response community representatives to develop draft regulatory language through a process akin to negotiated rulemaking. To ensure a draft standard would incorporate best practices and the latest advances in technology, OSHA invited emergency response stakeholder organizations to provide subject matter experts to consult with and participate on the Subcommittee. The Subcommittee comprised a balanced group of subject matter experts representing labor and management, career and volunteer emergency service management associations, other Federal agencies and State plans, a national consensus standard organization, and general industry skilled support workers. NACOSH unanimously recommended that OSHA proceed with the rulemaking to update its emergency response standard and endorsed the draft regulatory language developed by the Subcommittee. In accordance with the requirements of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA), OSHA convened a Small Business Advocacy Review (SBAR) panel in the fall of 2021. The panel, comprising members from the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Office of Advocacy, OSHA, and OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, listened to and reported on what Small Entity Representatives (SERs) from entities that would potentially be affected by the proposed rule had to say. OSHA provided SERs with the draft regulatory language developed by the NACOSH subcommittee for their review and comment. The Panel received advice and recommendations from the SERs and reported its findings and recommendations to OSHA. OSHA has taken the SERs' comments and the Panel's findings and recommendations into consideration in the development of the proposed rule. The proposed rule updates by replacing the existing Fire Brigades standard and would expand the scope of OSHA's standard to include a broad range of hazards emergency responders encounter during emergency response activities and would bring the standard in line with the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) National Response Framework and modernize the standard to align with the current industry consensus standards issued by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) on the safe conduct of emergency response activities. As noted in the first paragraph above, and discussed in detail below, OSHA standards do not apply to volunteer emergency responders. However, in States with OSHA-approved State Plans, volunteers may be treated as employees under state law. OSHA has no authority over how individual states regulate volunteers. See section III.B, Pertinent Legal Authority, and section VIII.G, Requirements for States with OSHA- Approved State Plans, for further discussion. Throughout this document, the agency seeks input on alternatives and potential exclusions for economically at-risk small and volunteer organizations that will be shared with State Plans as they determine how to proceed with their subsequent individual state-level rulemaking efforts. Organizations that provide emergency services vary significantly in size and the type(s) of service(s) they provide. They are often not well suited for ``one-size-fits-all'' prescriptive standards. Accordingly, the proposed rule is a ``performance-based'' standard, which provides flexibility for affected employers to establish the specific criteria that best suits their organization. The proposed rule focuses on the achievement of desired results--improving emergency responder health and safety and reducing injuries and fatalities--while providing flexibility as to the precise methods used to achieve those results. The performance-based nature of the proposed rule is particularly beneficial to small and [[Page 7776]] volunteer organizations with limited resources. Additionally, in accordance with Executive Orders 12866 and 13563, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.), OSHA has prepared a Preliminary Economic Analysis (PEA), including an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, for the replacement of the existing Fire Brigades standard. Supporting materials prepared by OSHA are available in the public docket for this rulemaking, Docket ID OSHA-2007-0073, through www.regulations.gov. II. Background A. Need for the Standard I. Fatality and Injury Analysis On April 17, 2013, while engaged in fire suppression activities at a fertilizer plant in West, Texas, ten firefighters died after approximately 40 to 60 tons of ammonium nitrate unexpectedly detonated. Five civilians, two of whom were providing support for firefighting activities, were also killed, and five firefighters were injured. Victims of the blast included both volunteer and career firefighters, ranging in age from 26 to 52 years, each with 1 to 31 years of firefighting experience. A subsequent investigation into the incident performed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) revealed numerous contributing factors in the incidents that led to the fatalities, including limited responder knowledge and recognition of the hazards created by ammonium nitrate, inadequate pre- incident emergency response planning for the fertilizer plant, and the fact that response personnel performed fire suppression activities from a location that was within the blast radius of the explosion (NIOSH 2014, Document ID 0331). As part of its investigation report, NIOSH made several recommendations for how fire departments could prevent fatalities and injuries, including the development of a written risk management plan, the conducting of pre-incident planning inspections for the buildings located within a fire department's jurisdiction, the development and implementation of a written incident management system for all emergency incident operations, the mandated use of turnout clothing and other personal protective equipment (PPE) that has been determined to be appropriate for each task, and a minimum standard of training for every firefighter. Every day, the duties of an emergency responder may require making life and death decisions. The typical workday of an emergency responder could include tasks that range from responding to a minor medical emergency to addressing a more severe incident such as a multi-building fire or assisting in the rescue and helicopter medical evacuation of an injured rock climber trapped on the side of a cliff. In performing their assigned tasks associated with the protection of the public, personal and real property, and the environment, emergency responders face numerous safety and health hazards which may lead to injury, illness, and death. After conducting a review of the fatalities and injuries sustained during regular work activities by emergency response personnel operating within the current regulatory framework, OSHA has determined that existing safety and health standards do not adequately protect the emergency response workforce from these hazards. As explained in the Preliminary Economic Analysis, OSHA estimates that approximately 1,054,611 individuals are exposed on an annual basis to the workplace hazards associated with the emergency response activities falling within the scope of the proposed rule, including public-sector employees in States with OSHA-approved State Plans.\\1\\ Workers performing emergency response activities can be assigned to a wide variety of tasks, including firefighting, medical assistance, and search and rescue. The hazards associated with emergency response activities are not limited to emergency situations; OSHA has also identified safety and health risks present during training exercises and other routine tasks. While some individuals are employed full-time as emergency response workers, a substantial number of personnel are categorized as volunteers. OSHA estimates that, of the 1,054,611 emergency responders anticipated to fall within the scope of the proposed rule, 331,472 will be self-identified as volunteers. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The proposed rule defines two types of emergency response workers: responders and team members. For purposes of the discussion in this section and the Health Effects of Emergency Response Activities section that follows, both types of workers are referred to as ``emergency responders'' or ``emergency response personnel.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A. Fatalities To determine the frequency and nature of workplace fatalities for emergency responders, OSHA reviewed the datasets of published summary reports available from a variety of sources, including reports published by the United States Fire Administration (USFA), FEMA, the NFPA, NIOSH, the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG), the OSHA Information System (OIS), and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Review of the overall rate of reported workplace-related deaths for emergency response personnel contained within these reports revealed substantial variation among reporting agencies (Table VII-A-1). Some organizations reported higher rates of fatal injuries as compared to other, non-emergency response professions, while other organizations reported lower rates of fatal injuries. OSHA also determined that each reporting agency varied significantly in the number of deaths reported annually, the number and date of the years examined, the inclusion or exclusion of certain victims (volunteer, non-firefighter job categories), and their definition of an `on-duty' fatality. Additionally, although each study provided summary numbers for the causes of death, the extent of the investigations performed to identify the root cause of each fatality varied among reports. Table VII-A-1, below, shows a summary of the reports reviewed by OSHA in consideration of the annual fatality rates for emergency response personnel. [[Page 7777]] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP05FE24.000 From the information in Table VII-A-1, OSHA concluded that a conservative estimate of workplace deaths for emergency response personnel falling within the scope of the proposed rule would include those firefighter deaths reported by NFPA (an average of 72.4 deaths annually, including career and volunteer firefighters), combined with BLS information on the number of non-firefighter emergency responder deaths (an average of 11.3 deaths, annually), which produces an estimate of 83.7 emergency responder deaths annually, on average. The agency believes that the majority of technical search and rescue job activities are performed by firefighters, EMS providers, and law enforcement officers (such as park rangers, conservation officers, and natural resource police), who are cross trained to perform technical search and rescue. As such, OSHA believes that most injuries and fatalities that occur during technical search and rescue activities are attributed to firefighters, EMS personnel, and law enforcement officers in data sources. This assumption is supported by the information available in the OSHA Information System (OIS) database; of the 273 emergency response-related fatalities in the OIS database, 19 occurred while the victim was engaged in non-fire-related technical search and rescue activities. Among these victims, each was identified by the OSHA investigator as employed within one of the job categories of firefighter, EMS provider, or law enforcement, and not as a technical search and rescuer. Listed below are examples of fatalities from the OIS database that occurred while the rescuer (victim) was engaged in activities that were determined to be technical search and rescue related. Inspection #343188371--At 8:15 p.m. on May 28, 2018, an employee was working as a firefighter and diver for a big city fire department. A man fell into the South Branch of the Chicago River. The firefighter and a coworker, his diving partner, had been deployed from a helicopter into the river to conduct dive rescue operations. During the attempt, the firefighter surfaced with his partner. Then he subsequently sank to the bottom of the river. At that time, he lost communication with the fire department. Divers from the department's marine unit searched for firefighter. After several minutes, they located the firefighter and pulled him out of the water with his diving equipment intact. Despite resuscitation attempts by paramedics on the scene and at the hospital, he was pronounced dead at 10:02 p.m. that same day. Inspection #334815610--At approximately 5:00 p.m. on June 21, 2012, during a mountain rescue, an employee was preparing to place rescue victim in a stokes litter to be hoisted on to a helicopter at approximately 13,800 foot level of Emmons Glacier on Mt. Rainier. The helicopter was lowering a litter to the employee. The employee reached up and unhooked the litter when he apparently lost his footing and slid approximately 3,7000 feet down the face of the glacier. The employee was killed. Inspection #315597187--At approximately 9:45 p.m. on May 23, 2011, Employee #1 and a firefighter crew were standing in the driveway of the fire hall. They had completed a rope rescue-training course using a rope and pulley system, which was hooked to the bucket of a ladder truck. The bucket was 20 ft above the pavement. Employee #1 placed his foot in the loop of the rope and pulled himself up by pulling down on the other end of the rope. When his feet were approximately 4.5 ft above the ground, the two ends of the rope spread apart, so his feet went in one direction and his hands went in the other. This caused his body to be positioned horizontally. He fell backwards to the ground and struck his back and head on the pavement below. Employee #1 sustained head trauma that killed him. The information in the OIS dataset, while limited, supports OSHA's inclusion of technical search and rescue-related job activities within the scope of the proposed rule. However, as fully discussed in section VII.D. Benefits, the number of fatalities in the OIS dataset is likely a significant underestimation of the total emergency responder fatalities occurring annually in the United States. Moreover, in contrast to firefighters, publicly available injury and fatality data specific to technical search and rescue is difficult to obtain, in part because it may be included with non-technical rescue data, as in this article titled ``Injuries to Search and Rescue Volunteers; A 30-year Study,'' in which there is no differentiation between technical and non-technical rescuers. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/20566794_Injuries_to_search_and_rescue_volunteers_A_30-year_experience. Similarly, as noted above, OSHA believes that many [[Page 7778]] injuries arising from technical search and rescue activities are categorized generally as firefighting or EMS injuries, making them difficult to disaggregate from other firefighter and EMS data. In addition to the lack of peer-reviewed publications focusing exclusively on technical search and rescue, a review of publicly available information from the professional associations devoted to providing support for technical search and rescue employees on a national level identified no readily available summary reports of technical search and rescue-related accidents, injuries, or fatalities for victims falling within the scope of OSHA's proposed rule. Further examination of available BLS data is infeasible because BLS does not have an occupational code for Technical Search/Rescue. Despite the limited availability of data specific to technical search and rescue, the hazards posed by these activities are recognized in the industry. The NACOSH subcommittee, comprised of subject matter experts representing labor and management, career and volunteer emergency service management associations, other Federal agencies and State plans, a national consensus standard organization, and general industry skilled support workers, recommended coverage for technical search and rescue activities by including it in its proposed draft standard (Docket ID OSHA-2015-0019-0002, Ex. 5). Similarly, NFPA has standards specific to technical search and rescue; NFPA 1670, Operations and Training for Technical Search and Rescue Activities; and NFPA 1006, Rescue Technician Professional Qualifications. Based on the available data and industry recognition, OSHA preliminarily concludes that technical search and rescue emergency response activities involve risks to employee safety and health comparable to those in other types of emergency response such as firefighting and EMS. OSHA requests comment on this conclusion and specifically invites additional data and information on the risks posed by technical search and rescue activities. OSHA believes that the fatalities present in the OSHA OIS dataset are likely a significant underestimation of the fatalities occurring annually within the emergency response community. This is likely because the OIS database contains information about fatality investigations performed by OSHA field investigators, but does not contain information about deaths not reported to OSHA, which includes many volunteer firefighter deaths. The total number of fatalities may also be underestimated as there is no blanket mandatory reporting requirement for emergency responder deaths. This is also likely due in part to varying methodology among reporting organizations for categorizing a heart attack as work-related. The differences observed between the OIS dataset and the NFPA dataset in these two categories of fatalities are summarized in Table VII-A-2. Although the NFPA dataset contained more victims in each of these fatality characteristics, when OSHA compared the manner and cause of deaths in the OIS dataset with those in the NFPA summary reports, observable similarities were present (Table VII-A-2). [[Page 7779]] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP05FE24.001 For example, both datasets show that a majority of emergency responder deaths occurred while the responder was responding to emergencies or fighting fires (58% for NFPA, 62% for OIS). A substantial number of fatalities also occurred while engaged in training activities (12% and 14% for the NFPA and OIS datasets, respectively). The leading cause of death for both the NFPA (19%) and the OIS (26%) datasets was being struck by an object, and a similar percentage of deaths fell into the striking/crushing/collision category (32% in the NFPA dataset, 26% in the OIS dataset). Important distinctions between the NFPA and OIS datasets include both scope and level of detail. Specifically, NFPA reports are limited to deaths occurring among firefighters. The OIS dataset includes deaths of all emergency response personnel determined to fall within the scope of the proposed rule, including other, non-firefighter individuals. Additionally, the NFPA dataset contains little to no information regarding identified workplace hazards associated with the reported deaths, while the OIS dataset includes summary information for contributory hazards, as identified by the standards cited by the OSHA investigator and the information contained in each accident's summary abstract. For these reasons, while OSHA determined that the overall number of firefighter deaths annually is more accurately reflected by the NFPA annual summary reports, OSHA determined that the descriptive information available in the OIS dataset regarding task at time of death, cause of death, and workplace hazards identified by the OSHA inspector while investigating an individual's death is a representative sample of the characteristics of emergency response fatalities across the larger dataset. OSHA reviewed all 273 fatalities in the OIS dataset to identify the causes of death and any contributory safety or health hazards. Table VII-A-3 shows a summary of the reported cause of death and the assigned task at the time of death for each of the fatalities in the OIS dataset. A review of the available literature identifying common causes of death for emergency responders supports OSHA's analysis of the fatalities available in the OIS dataset. From this review, OSHA determined that some of the most common safety and health hazards encountered by emergency responders include vehicle collisions; falls from heights to lower levels due to structural or building collapses; being struck by, caught in between, or crushed by vehicles; falling objects or debris; burns; and entrapments (FEMA, 2022, Document ID 0341; NWCG, 2017, [[Page 7780]] Document ID 0265; NFPA, 2022, Document ID 0122). BILLING CODE 4510-26-P [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP05FE24.002 BILLING CODE 4510-26-C Among these 273 fatalities, hazards identified by OSHA investigators as present on-site at the time of death included hazards involving the incorrect use of PPE and other equipment, inadequate vehicle preparedness and operation, lack of effective implementation of standard operating procedures in various emergency scenarios, failure to adhere to practices for Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) situations, failure to meet medical evaluation requirements, failure to meet minimum training requirements, lack of or ineffective implementation of an Emergency Response Plan (ERP), and the lack of an effective Risk Management Plan (RMP). These hazards were identified by reviews of the citations issued at the time of the inspection and of the summary abstracts for each investigation. A summary of the number of hazards found at each of the OIS fatalities can be found in Table VII-A-4, below. [[Page 7781]] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP05FE24.003 From these 273 fatalities, OSHA identified 212 (77.7%) in which at least one of the safety hazards addressed by the proposed rule was determined to be present at the time of the emergency responder's death. Heart attacks were identified in both the NFPA (43%) and OIS (20%) datasets as one of the most commonly occurring means by which an emergency responder will die while at work. Among the 212 fatalities in the OIS dataset determined to have at least one of the safety hazards addressed by the proposed rule present in the workplace at the time of death, eight were classified as heart attack fatalities, approximately 15% of the total number of heart attacks observed in the dataset. Cardiovascular health and the reduction of heart attacks is further discussed in the Health Effects of Emergency Response Activities section, below. B. Nonfatal Injuries OSHA reviewed the available literature to examine the extent and nature of workplace injuries occurring among emergency response personnel. From this review, OSHA determined that, overall, emergency responders are at higher risk of injury than the general population. Workplace hazards identified in the literature as leading to injury among emergency response personnel include exposure to toxic chemicals, falls, environmental hypoxia, exposure to excessive noise, over- exertion due to lifting heavy objects, wearing heavy protective equipment, repetitive motion, and other similar activities (Gentzler, 2010, Document ID 0337; Neitzel et. al, 2013, Document ID 0333; Neitzel et. al, 2016, Document ID 0338; Campbell, 2017, Document ID 0342). Estimations of the increased risk as compared to all private industries varied by the type of emergency service provided, ranging from 1.7 times for private ambulance service workers to 4 times for EMS responders (Reichard, 2017, Document ID 0339; Reichard et al, 2018, Document ID 0335). For the purposes of this analysis, OSHA focused on lost-time injuries; expected lost-time injuries for the hazards identified above include fractures, sprains, internal bodily trauma, dislocations, chemical burns, and chemical pneumonia. OSHA determined that the most common cause of injury among emergency medical services providers was overexertion or strain. Multiple studies identified overexertion or strain as the leading causes of injury, with reported proportions of injury ranging from 23% to 60% and body motion injuries (e.g., lifting, carrying, or transferring a patient and/or equipment) commonly serving as the leading event (Campbell, 2017, Document ID 0342; Campbell and Hall, 2022, Document ID 0336; Campbell and Molis, 2020, Document ID 0343; Butry et al., 2019, Document ID 0334; Reichard et al., 2018, Document ID 0335; Dworsky et al., 2021, Document ID 0332). In addition to reviewing the available literature, OSHA conducted an analysis of the injury statistics available from the BLS for the EMT and Paramedic categories of emergency response professions, from the years 2007 through 2020. In total, 107,720 non-fatal incidents requiring days away from work were reported, an average of 7,694 injuries annually. In addition to the common sources of injury as identified by the literature review, the BLS injury statistics revealed further causes of frequent injury among emergency response professionals, summarized in Table VII-A-5, below. BILLING CODE 4310-26-P [[Page 7782]] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP05FE24.004 To determine the number of injuries occurring annually among firefighters, OSHA reviewed the annual NFPA injury summary reports from 2007 to 2020 (Docket Nos. 0362-0376). These reports show that, on average, 67,964 injuries occurred among firefighters annually, with an average of 14,172 of those classified as a lost time injury, 21% of total injuries (see Table VII-A-6). [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP05FE24.005 [[Page 7783]] Review of the reported tasks that injured firefighters were engaged in at the time of injury revealed persistent trends, both among the injury task categories, and when compared to the task categories of the fatality victims (Table VII-A-7). Specifically, each year, the work associated with firefighting activities results in an average of 42.4% of all injuries, while non-fire emergency tasks result in 20.4% of all injuries. The activities associated with responding to or returning from an emergency result in an average of 6.6% of annual injuries. Training activities result in 11.6% of all firefighter injuries, and duties not associated with emergencies, emergency response, or training result in, on average, 19% of injuries. Examples of injuries in this last category could include things like a responder slipping on an icy walkway at the fire station, dropping an old tire on their foot while doing a changeout at the fire station, having their foot run over while directing a fire truck back into the station after a fire, and sliding down the fire pole and landing poorly, spraining an ankle. The proportion of total injuries for each assigned job category was similar to the proportions observed in each of the fatality categories (see Table VII-A-2). [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP05FE24.006 The most common source of injury among firefighters was overexertion or strain (27.0% of injuries, on average). While overexertion was also the leading source of injury among emergency response personnel not classified as firefighters, the proportion of these injuries varied significantly among the professional categories, 27.0% of firefighter injuries compared to 53.6% of injuries for non- firefighter personnel. Other significant causes of injury among firefighters included fall, jump, slip injuries (22.8% of injuries, on average) exposure to fire products (11.5% of injuries, on average), contact with objects (10.8%), and being struck by a moving object (6.0%). (see Table VII-A-8). [[Page 7784]] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP05FE24.007 BILLING CODE 4510-26-C II. Health Effects of Emergency Response Activities In addition to the traumatic injuries discussed above, emergency response activities are associated with exposure to hazards that can cause both chronic physical health and adverse psychological health effects for responders, including but not limited to adverse cardiovascular and respiratory effects, cancers, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicide. Exposure to combustion products is a major factor behind physical illnesses associated with emergency response activities; however, factors such as exposure to infectious diseases, heat, physical exertion, physical stress reactions to alarms and sirens, shift work, and other exposures also play a role. Psychological health effects have been attributed to exposure to trauma, stressful situations, and threats to life and health, including due to workplace violence. This section presents a summary of OSHA's review of the health effects literature for emergency response activities, including the workplace exposures that contribute to these health effects, and the agency's preliminary conclusions based on that review. OSHA's full analysis is contained in the background document entitled ``Emergency Response Health Effects Literature Review,'' which has been placed in the rulemaking docket (Document ID 0361). OSHA conducted a literature search to collect relevant information, studies, reports, and materials related to the occupational safety and health of emergency responders such as firefighters, search and rescue personnel, and emergency medical service providers. OSHA sought literature that evaluated workplace exposures and health effects for emergency responders including: Exposures to combustion products, other contaminants and substances, and infectious diseases Acute and chronic health conditions (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease) Behavioral health issues (e.g., mental health, substance use disorders, suicide) Workplace violence OSHA searched the National Library of Medicine (NLM) (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and (https://www2a.cdc.gov/nioshtic-2/advsearch2.asp) in 2020 and again in 2022. The search was date limited to 2010 and included several occupational and risk key words to target relevant search results. OSHA obtained and reviewed the full text of relevant articles. OSHA also searched several key organizations' websites for relevant reports and information. This section summarizes the results of this search. A. Exposures Emergency responders are exposed to a variety of health hazards in the workplace. OSHA focused its literature review on three areas: combustion products, other contaminants and substances, and infectious diseases. The combustion products review covers substances released during fires. The other contaminants and substances review examines specific situations where emergency responders were exposed to harmful chemicals (e.g., vinyl chloride, phosphine, opioids) while responding to emergency situations in the field or when participating in training exercises that involved simulated smoke. It also includes studies that assessed contaminants inside firehouses and substances off-gassing from emergency [[Page 7785]] response gear. The infectious diseases review summarizes research on a variety of diseases, including hepatitis B, Clostridiodes difficile, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and COVID-19. Many of the studies identified under these three topics focused solely on examining the likelihood or the extent of exposures among emergency responder populations. In some cases, the studies also provided information about the health effects observed among exposed groups. More detailed information about health effects is presented in section 2, Acute and Chronic Health Conditions and section 3, Behavioral Health. (i) Combustion Products Combustion products, many of which are considered respiratory hazards, are released when materials burn. The combustion product studies identified during OSHA's literature review addressed firefighters, including both structural and wildland firefighters. Firefighters may be exposed to a wide variety of combustion products, even when wearing protective gear, and exposures can occur during a broad range of activities. Emergency responders can be exposed to combustion products during live training exercises as well as when responding to actual events; while performing exterior operations and during interior fire attack operations; during the early phase of operations as they delay donning self-contained breathing apparatus to conserve vital air supply, through leaks while wearing respiratory protection, or during post-fire clean-up activities. Emergency responders can also be exposed to combustion products through off- gassing from contaminated protective clothing and equipment or while cleaning such items after fire operations. (Geer Wallace et al., 2019a, Document ID 0204; Poutasse et al., 2020, Document ID 0259; Fent et al., 2010, Document ID 0213; Fent et al., 2022, Document ID 0207; Levasseur et al., 2022, Document ID 0253). The literature provides evidence of firefighters being exposed to a variety of different combustion products, including carbon monoxide (McCleery et al., 2011, Document ID 0281; Semmens et al., 2021, Document ID 0291; Navarro et al., 2021a, Document ID 0252; Reinhardt and Broyles, 2019, Document ID 0278); particulate matter (Baxter et al., 2010, Document ID 0179; Horn et al., 2017, Document ID 0243); dioxins (Shaw et al., 2013, Document ID 0218); radionuclides (Carvalho et al., 2014, Document ID 0180); and a variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Hwang et al., 2021, Document ID 0155; Hwang et al., 2022, Document ID 0156; Pleil et al., 2014, Document ID 0158; Rossbach et al., 2020, Document ID 0289; Fent et al. 2013, Document ID 0206; Fent et al., 2022, Document ID 0207; Alharbi et al., 2021, Document ID 0171; Kirk et al., 2021, Document ID 0240; Cherry et al., 2019, Document ID 0188; Poutasse et al., 2020, Document ID 0259; Adetona et al., 2015, Document ID 0167). A 2022 report by the National Academies, ``The Chemistry of Fires at the Wildland-Urban Interface'', provides additional detailed information on fire emissions from a variety of household components, vehicles, and biomass (NASEM 2022, Document ID 0395). These studies show that firefighters can be exposed to combustion products through inhalation and dermal routes during both live fires and training exercises. It is difficult to provide estimates of how many firefighters are exposed and at what level because of the variables involved in firefighting. For example, the number of firefighters exposed varies depending on the size of the fire, with fewer firefighters exposed in response to a car fire than at a large industrial fire. The quantity and type of combustion products that firefighters are exposed to also varies depending on what is burning. Since fires are generally not planned events, the instrumentation that would be required to quantify firefighter exposures is not present at most fires. The frequency of firefighter exposures can also vary greatly, from very few exposures annually in rural areas to many exposures annually in metropolitan areas. Nonetheless, the literature is clear that firefighters are exposed to combustion products at harmful levels. The specific types and concentration of combustion products released during a fire vary depending on which types of materials are burning and whether the fire is a wildfire, residential fire, industrial fire, or vehicle fire. It is not uncommon for residential fires to involve hazardous materials stored in paint cabinets, workshops, or garages; or buildings that still contain lead paint or asbestos. As a result, emergency responders' exposures to combustion products vary broadly (Alharbi et al., 2021, Document ID 0171; Kirk et al., 2021, Document ID 0240; Fent et al., 2010, Document ID 0213). For example, one study reported that residential fires release more VOCs than industrial fires but lower levels of inorganic gases (Alharbi et al., 2021, Document ID 0171). Another study, which involved controlled fires in a simulated house structure, showed that hydrogen cyanide was detected at concentrations exceeding occupational exposure limits, and at times, at levels regarded as immediately dangerous to life and health (Horn et al., 2017, Document ID 0243). A training exercise focused on vehicle fires suggested that firefighters might encounter acute overexposures to formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and isocyanates (Fent et al., 2010, Document ID 0213). Multiple studies found that firefighters are exposed to VOCs, especially PAH compounds, through the dermal and inhalation routes; the studies conducted personal air sampling on the exterior of firefighter gear and compared urinary metabolites from before and after firefighter trainings. For firefighters wearing self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), the dermal route appears to be the main route of exposure (Hwang et al., 2021, Document ID 0155; Hwang et al. 2022, Document ID 0156; Pleil et al., 2014, Document ID 0158; Rossbach et al., 2020, Document ID 0289; Fent et al., 2022, Document ID 0207). Firefighter PAH levels were correlated with estimated exposures (based on combustion products identified in environmental samples), length of exposure, and number of fire suppressions (Cherry et al., 2019, Document ID 0188; Cherry et al., 2021, Document ID 0192; Poutasse et al., 2020, Document ID 0259). Also, elevated VOC and PAH levels were associated with certain job positions, including overhaul, attack, search, and outside ventilation positions (Baxter et al., 2014, Document ID 0157; Geer Wallace et al., 2019b, Document ID 0202). Some studies examined ways to reduce VOC and PAH exposures, including enhanced skin hygiene. One study found that the transitional attack method (which involves applying water to the fire from outside of a structure through windows or openings) could lower firefighters' exposures to PAHs compared to the interior attack method (which involves entering the structure for water application) (Fent et al., 2020, Document ID 0205). Many of the articles identified in the combustion product literature review focused on wildland firefighters, who have much longer fire suppression shifts (8 to 13 hours) compared to structural firefighters (typically 30 minutes) and are more likely to be exposed to combustion products through inhalation since they often wear no respiratory protection or sometimes only a bandana or an N95 respirator rather than an [[Page 7786]] SCBA like structural firefighters do (Hwang et al., 2022, Document ID 0156; Navarro, 2021, Document ID 0257). It is important to note that an N95 respirator or bandana can only filter out particulate matter and cannot reduce or prevent exposure to toxic gasses and vapors from combustion products. Among wildland firefighters, certain job tasks were associated with higher exposures to different combustion products: for particulate matter, mop-up, direct suppression, and holding tasks had the highest exposures; for carbon monoxide, direct suppression, fireline construction, and holding job tasks had the highest exposures (Navarro, 2021, Document ID 0257; Reinhardt and Broyles, 2019, Document ID 0278). Prescribed burns were found to produce higher exposures of particulate matter and carbon monoxide than wildfires. Time spent on the fireline increased carbon monoxide exposure, and VOC levels were highest for Type 1 crews, which typically have the most experienced firefighters performing the most complex tasks (Navarro et al., 2021a, Document ID 0252). Simultaneous carbon monoxide and noise exposure from chain saws and woodchippers have been found to result in greater hearing loss than if carbon monoxide was not a co-exposure in wildland fire fighters (Ramsey et al. 2019, Document ID 0256). Additionally, wildland firefighters are at risk of radionuclide exposure due to incineration of vegetation that contains naturally occurring radionuclides (Carvalho et al., 2014, Document ID 0180). Studies about wildland firefighters identified multiple negative health effects due to exposures to combustion products, including decline in lung function, oxidative and inflammatory stress response, and increased cardiovascular health effects and mortality (Navarro, 2021, Document ID 0257; Ferguson et al., 2016, Document ID 0197; Main et al., 2019, Document ID 0258; Adetona et al., 2013, Document ID 0165; Wu et al., 2019, Document ID 0318; Navarro et al., 2019, Document ID 0247). Based on the evidence described above, OSHA has preliminarily determined that emergency responders, specifically both structural and wildland firefighters performing firefighting activities, are exposed to combustion products. These combustion products contain components that are known to cause cardiovascular and pulmonary illness and to be carcinogenic to humans. OSHA therefore preliminarily finds justification to promulgate a standard which requires protective equipment and practices to limit exposure to combustion products. In addition, since exposure cannot be completely eliminated due to the nature of firefighting activities, OSHA has preliminarily determined that medical surveillance is necessary for these responders to detect and respond to health conditions as soon as possible in order to mitigate the long-term health impact of such exposures on emergency responders. (ii) Other Contaminants and Substances In addition to the combustion products reviewed in section A.(i), emergency responders may be exposed to varied, unpredictable, and often unknown contaminants and substances while performing their duties. (Hall et al., 2018, Document ID 0220; Melnikova et al., 2018, Document ID 0246). Overall, OSHA's literature review found evidence of adverse health effects among emergency responders who encountered contaminants and other potentially harmful substances on the job, with the most injuries seen among firefighters. As an example of the sources of these contaminants, in 2022 the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration recorded 23,178 highway incidents involving hazardous materials (hazmat) and 355 railway spill hazmat incidents. Additionally, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board reported 102 reportable chemical release events in 2022. Studies also show that emergency responders can be exposed to hazardous substances through equipment contamination and inside their workplaces even when they are not responding to emergencies. Studies show that emergency responders are exposed to a variety of chemicals in the field, including vinyl chloride, phosphine, ammonia, and hydrochloric acid (Hall et al., 2018, Document ID 0220; Melnikova et al., 2018, Document ID 0246; Brinker et al., 2013, Document ID 0177; Brinker et al., 2015, Document ID 0175). Examples of emergency response activities that can involve such exposures include attending to drug overdose victims (Chiu et al., 2018a, Document ID 0191; Chiu et al., 2018b, Document ID 0182; Chiu et al., 2018c, Document ID 0186), putting out a fire at a chemical manufacturing facility (Eisenberg et al., 2019, Document ID 0203), working with chainsaws that released carbon monoxide and generate wood dust (Ramsey et al., 2019, Document ID 0256), and participating in training that exposed them to a variety of chemicals and potential irritants in simulated smoke such as mineral oil, diethylene glycol, aldehydes, PAHs, VOCs, and carbonaceous particles (Fent et al., 2013, Document ID 0206). The literature review also captured studies that examined diesel exhaust particulate matter and PAH concentrations inside firehouses (Sparer et al., 2018, Document ID 0292; Baxter et al., 2014, Document ID 0157), as well as contaminants associated with firefighting gear, including residual combustion products that adhere to the gear, and substances used to make the gear, such as organophosphorus flame retardants, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) chemicals, and plasticizers (Alexander and Baxter, 2014, Document ID 0164; Banks et al., 2021b, Document ID 0168; Fent et al., 2018, Document ID 0210; Kirk and Logan, 2015, Document ID 0232; and Muensterman et al., 2022, Document ID 0282). Respiratory effects (e.g., cough, asthma-like symptoms) were the most frequently reported symptoms among the emergency responders who were assessed (Melnikova et al., 2018, Document ID 0246; Chiu et al., 2018a, Document ID 0191, Chiu et al., 2018c, Document ID 0186; Fent et al., 2013, Document ID 0206; Eisenberg et al., 2019, Document ID 0203; Brinker et al., 2013, Document ID 0177; Brinker et al., 2015, Document ID 0175). Melnikova et al. (2018, Document ID 0246) examined 566 acute chemical exposures among 1,460 emergency responders and found that respiratory system problems were the most common adverse health effect, constituting 56.3 percent of all adverse effects. Other adverse health effects included trauma (11.3 percent), eye irritation (10.5 percent), headache (9.9 percent), and dizziness/other non-head-related central nervous system symptoms (9.9 percent). The chemicals most likely to cause adverse health effects were respiratory irritants, including ammonia (12.4 percent); unspecified, illegal methamphetamine-related chemicals (7.4 percent); carbon monoxide (6.2 percent); propane (6.0 percent); and hydrochloric acid (4.8 percent). Given the prominence of respiratory symptoms in responders exposed to these chemicals, several articles emphasized the importance of wearing respiratory PPE to protect emergency responders from negative health effects (Hall et al., 2018, Document ID 0220; Chiu et al., 2018a, Document ID 0191; Chiu et al., 2018c, Document ID 0186). A few NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluations (HHEs) investigated health impacts among emergency responders who assisted drug overdose victims. In [[Page 7787]] a 2018 opioid-related exposure, eight of nine emergency responders reported adverse health effects that were consistent with drug exposure: weakness, confusion, palpitations, lightheadedness, headache, nausea, numbness, double vision, chest discomfort, and stomach discomfort (Chiu et al., 2018a, Document ID 0191; Chiu et al., 2018c, Document ID 0186). Overall, wearing appropriate PPE during responses to drug overdoses was deemed important, especially for preventing eye and mouth exposure. Multiple studies identified contaminants inside fire stations and on firefighting gear and equipment that firefighters may be exposed to. In studies that examined separate rooms within fire stations, truck bays had the highest contaminant concentrations (Sparer et al., 2018, Document ID 0292; Baxter et al., 2014, Document ID 0157). Banks et al. (2021b, Document ID 0168) found that off-gassing of SVOCs from uniforms stored in private vehicles could be a source of dermal or inhalation exposure for firefighters. Therefore, laundering of firefighters' protective gear (Kirk and Logan, 2015, Document ID 0232), field decontamination, and dermal wipes (Fent et al., 2018, Document ID 0210) were recommended methods to prevent exposures. PFAS (Muensterman et al., 2022, Document ID 0282) and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (Alexander and Baxter, 2014, Document ID 0164) were highlighted as contaminants that need further research due to their presence in and/or persistence on firefighter gear. Based on the evidence described above, OSHA has preliminarily determined that in the course of their duties, firefighters, emergency medical service providers and technical rescuers are exposed to hazardous substances in the workplace. OSHA therefore preliminarily finds justification to promulgate a standard which requires protective equipment and practices to limit exposure to hazardous substances. In addition, since exposure cannot be completely eliminated due to the nature of emergency response activities, OSHA has preliminarily determined that medical surveillance is also necessary for these responders to detect and respond to health conditions as soon as possible in order to mitigate long-term health impacts. (iii) Infectious Diseases When responding to community needs, emergency responders come in direct contact with people who have infectious diseases. OSHA's literature review identified multiple infectious diseases that firefighters, technical rescue responders, and emergency medical service providers are exposed to, including hepatitis B, Clostridiodes difficile, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and COVID-19. The studies covered a range of topics, such as the incidence rate or prevalence of infectious disease among emergency responders, the likelihood of emergency equipment being contaminated, and the impact of other variables (e.g., wildfire smoke, social vulnerability index) on emergency responders' occupational risks. Generally, bloodborne diseases (e.g., hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus) pose low risk to emergency responders, whereas infectious diseases spread through airborne pathways (e.g., meningococcal meningitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza, and tuberculosis) and direct contact transmission (e.g., MRSA) pose higher risk (Thomas et al., 2017, Document ID 0307). However, EMS providers' exposure to infectious diseases declined between 1993 and 2011 and remains generally low except during pandemics (Thomas et al., 2017, Document ID 0307). MRSA and Staphylococcus aureus prevalence was generally high among emergency responders. Miramonti et al. (2012, Document ID 0274) found that EMTs and paramedics have a significantly higher nasal colonization rate of MRSA compared to the general population (4.5% vs. 0.084%). Elie-Turenne et al., (2010, Document ID 0195) found that paramedics had the highest rate of Staphylococcus aureus nasal colonization (57.7%), but the lowest rate of MRSA compared to other health care professionals (i.e., nurses, clerical workers, and physicians). The authors suggested that the lower relative rate of MRSA may be due to paramedics spending more time in the field compared to other health care professionals. However, two studies examining the contamination of environmental surfaces that emergency responders contact found MRSA in fire stations (Sexton and Reynolds, 2010, Document ID 0284) and Clostridiodes difficile on EMS monitoring equipment (Gibson et al., 2021, Document ID 0199). COVID-19 can serve as a proxy for both epidemic and pandemic exposures for emergency responders. Inconsistent results were found for COVID-19 prevalence among emergency responders. Two studies that examined seroprevalence rates found that first responders had a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 than other health care professionals (Sami et al., 2021, Document ID 0290; Zhang et al., 2022, Document ID 0319). In contrast, other studies found that the prevalence of COVID-19 was not elevated in first responders compared to the general public (Shukla et al., 2020, Document ID 0285; Vieira et al., 2021, Document ID 0302) or to other medical professionals (Akinbami et al., 2020, Document ID 0170; MacDonald et al., 2021, Document ID 0251). Some of these studies suggested that increased PPE usage and the strict infection control measures that emergency responders instituted during the COVID-19 pandemic helped prevent elevated rates among this population (Akinbami et al., 2020, Document ID 0170; Zhang et al., 2022, Document ID 0319; Newberry et al., 2021, Document ID 0261; Vieira et al., 2021, Document ID 0302). Additionally, two studies showed that vaccination may mitigate occupational risks (Grunau et al., 2022, Document ID 0211; Caban-Martinez et al., 2022, Document ID 0178). Other variables also affected first responders' occupational risk of contracting COVID-19 or developing severe COVID-19. Sami et al. (2021, Document ID 0290) and Akinbami et al. (2020, Document ID 0170) both found that community levels of COVID-19 correlated with seroprevalence rates of SARS-CoV-2 in first responders. Moreover, emergency responders who resided in more socially vulnerable response areas (gauged using the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index) were found to have increased exposure to COVID-19 (Haas et al., 2021, Document ID 0230). Additionally, increased levels of wildfire smoke inhalation may increase occupational risk for developing severe COVID-19 among wildland firefighters (Navarro et al., 2021b, Document ID 0279). Based on the above, OSHA has preliminarily determined that emergency responders are exposed to infectious diseases in the course of their work. Exposures occur due to contact with victims of emergencies (e.g., traumatic injuries) and the treatment and transport of emergency medical patients suffering from either traumatic injuries or illness (e.g., viral meningitis). Infectious agents can contaminate emergency response vehicles and response equipment; protective clothing and equipment; or station uniforms and be brought back to communal quarters such as a fire stations or wildfire basecamps. OSHA therefore preliminarily finds justification to promulgate a standard which requires protective equipment and practices to address exposures to infectious disease. B. Acute and Chronic Health Conditions OSHA has identified evidence suggesting that the hazardous exposures [[Page 7788]] that emergency responders encounter, as described above, put them at elevated risk for certain acute and chronic health conditions. OSHA's literature review on acute and chronic health conditions among emergency responders covered cancer, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease. (i) Cancer Emergency responders, particularly firefighters, are exposed to known and suspected carcinogens when performing their work (see Sections A.(i) and A.(ii) above), which places them at a 12-19% greater risk of dying from cancer (Muegge et al., 2018, Document ID 0269; Daniels et al., 2014, Document ID 0187; Pinkerton et al., 2020, Document ID 0245) and a 9% greater risk of developing cancer (Daniels et al., 2014, Document ID 0187) than the general population. Studies show that firefighters are at higher risk for multiple cancers compared to the general U.S. population. In fact, the International Association for Research on Cancer (IARC) has concluded that occupational exposure as a firefighter is itself carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) (Demers et al. 2022, Document ID 0194; IARC 2023, Document ID 0236; NASEM 2022, Document ID 0395). Researchers found that, compared to the general population, male firefighters are at increased risk for melanoma and prostate cancer (Lee et al., 2020, Document ID 0250; Tsai et al., 2015, Document ID 0311); testicular cancer, thyroid cancer, late-stage colon cancer (Lee et al., 2020, Document ID 0250); multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, esophageal cancer, kidney cancer, and brain cancer (Tsai et al., 2015, Document ID 0311). Researchers found that female firefighters are at increased risk compared to the general population for brain cancer and thyroid cancer (Lee et al., 2020, Document ID 0250) and increased risk of death from bladder cancer (Daniels et al., 2014, Document ID 0187; Pinkerton et al., 2020, Document ID 0245). For males and females combined, researchers found that firefighters are at increased risk compared to the general population for all-cancer mortality (Muegge et al., 2018, Document ID 0269; Daniels et al., 2014, Document ID 0187; Pinkerton et al., 2020, Document ID 0245); all-cancer incidence (Daniels et al., 2014, Document ID 0187); buccal cavity and pharynx cancer mortality (Muegge et al., 2018, Document ID 0269; Pinkerton et al., 2020, Document ID 0245); other parts of the buccal cavity cancer mortality, pancreatic cancer mortality, kidney cancer mortality, connective tissues cancer mortality, brain and other parts of the nervous system cancer mortality (Muegge et al., 2018, Document ID 0269); digestive cancer incidence and mortality (Daniels et al., 2014, Document ID 0187); respiratory cancer incidence and mortality (Daniels et al., 2014, Document ID 0187); malignant mesothelioma incidence and mortality (Daniels et al., 2014, Document ID 0187; Pinkerton et al., 2020, Document ID 0245); non-Hodgkins lymphoma mortality; esophageal cancer mortality; intestine cancer mortality; rectal cancer mortality; lung cancer mortality; biliary, liver, and gall bladder cancer; and other digestive cancer mortality (Pinkerton et al., 2020, Document ID 0245). Systematic reviews and meta-analyses corroborate many of these results (IARC, 2023, Document ID 0236; Jalilian et al., 2019, Document ID 0233; Sritharan et al., 2017, Document ID 0299; LeMasters et al., 2006, Document ID 0268; Demers et al., 2022, Document ID 0194). Additionally, researchers have studied whether dose-response relationships exist between firefighting exposures and developing cancer. In these dose-response studies, researchers found associations between increased firefighting exposures and increased lung cancer incidence and mortality (Daniels et al., 2015, Document ID 0184; Pinkerton et al., 2020, Document ID 0245) and leukemia mortality (Daniels et al., 2015, Document ID 0184). In a risk assessment, Navarro et al. (2019, Document ID 0247) found that wildland firefighters were at an 8 to 43 percent increased risk of lung cancer mortality. All 50 states have adopted some form of firefighter cancer legislation that provides benefits to firefighters who develop or die from cancer. In 80% of those, the cancers are presumed to have been the result of firefighting duties. It is also noteworthy that Congress recently passed the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (https://www.dol.gov/agencies/owcp/FECA/NDAA2023). Section 5305 of this Act, titled ``Fairness for Federal Firefighters,'' determined that certain conditions, including various cancers, will be presumed to be work-related for Federal employees who perform fire protection activities and modified the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) accordingly. OSHA has preliminarily determined that the exposures discussed in sections A.(i) and A.(ii) lead emergency responders who perform firefighting duties to have an increased risk of developing cancer. OSHA therefore preliminarily finds justification to promulgate a standard which requires protective equipment and practices to limit exposure to known and suspected carcinogens. In addition, since exposure cannot be completely eliminated due to the nature of emergency response activities, OSHA has preliminarily determined that medical surveillance is necessary for these responders to detect and respond to health conditions as soon as possible in order to mitigate long-term health impacts. (ii) Cardiovascular Disease Emergency responders, especially firefighters, may be called on to engage in physically strenuous activities while wearing heavy, insulated, and restrictive PPE ensembles that pose physiological burden, exacerbate heat stress hazards, and raise core temperatures to dangerous levels (Horn et al., 2013, Document ID 0219; West et al., 2020, Document ID 0314). In combination, these factors strain the body's cardiovascular system and increase the risk of sudden cardiac events (Soteriades et al., 2011, Document ID 0121). Many studies assessed cardiovascular disease prevalence among firefighters. They revealed that cardiac events are the leading cause of on-duty death among U.S. structural and wildland firefighters, with cardiovascular disease causing 45 to 50 percent of on-duty firefighter deaths each year (Smith et al., 2016, Document ID 0120; Soteriades et al., 2011, Document ID 0121; NWCG, 2017, Document ID 0265; NASEM 2022, Document ID 0396). Navarro et al. (2019, Document ID 0247) estimated that wildland firefighters had an increased cardiovascular disease mortality of 16 to 30 percent compared to the general population. Soteriades et al. (2011, Document ID 0121) reported that firefighting causes considerable cardiovascular strain, which may trigger a sudden cardiac event. However, Muegge et al. (2018, Document ID 0269), in a study that reviewed death certificates in Indiana, found that the odds of dying from cardiovascular disease overall were no different between current and retired firefighters and non-firefighters, possibly due to the healthy worker effect. OSHA does not view this study as determinative of the cardiovascular risks facing firefighters; rather it must be viewed in the larger context of the weight of evidence discussed here on the association between emergency response work and cardiovascular events. Several studies identified factors and activities in firefighter populations that are associated with increased risks for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Factors that resulted in increased risks of cardiac fatalities included volunteer [[Page 7789]] status and stress or overexertion (Sen et al., 2016, Document ID 0300); participation in fire suppression activities (Smith et al., 2019, Document ID 0303); and hypertension, a history of cardiovascular disease, and smoking (Yang et al., 2013, Document ID 0309). Martin et al. (2019, Document ID 0271) found that 68 percent of the firefighters in one study population had two or more cardiovascular risk factors. Obesity (Smith et al., 2022, Document ID 0294; Khaya et al., 2021, Document ID 0242), reduced cardiorespiratory fitness (Smith et al., 2022, Document ID 0294), metabolic syndrome or abnormal metabolic syndrome components (Li et al., 2017, Document ID 0260), and elevated blood pressures and/or hypertension (Lan et al., 2021, Document ID 0226; Bond et al., 2022, Document ID 0176; Khaja et al., 2021, Document ID 0242) were highly prevalent among firefighters and could serve as markers for cardiac dysfunction. Observed elevated blood pressures and/ or hypertension among firefighters was attributed to increased psychological stress (Lan et al., 2021, Document ID 0226; Bond et al., 2022, Document ID 0176; Khaja et al., 2021, Document ID 0242) and increased frequency of work shifts (Choi et al., 2016, Document ID 0181). A few studies examined methods that improved cardiovascular health. Horn et al. (2013, Document ID 0219) and Mani et al. (2013, Document ID 0270) measured cardiovascular responses during specific workplace tasks and activities and found that systolic blood pressures were significantly lower during rest periods. Cash et al. (2021, Document ID 0190) found that firefighters who slept for recommended durations (seven to nine hours) nearly doubled their likelihood of having ideal cardiovascular health. OSHA has preliminarily determined that emergency response activities can produce physiological and psychological strain that is sufficient to trigger a cardiovascular event up to and including sudden cardiac death. In addition, elevated core body temperature, disrupted sleep patterns, noise from alarms and sirens, circadian rhythm disruptions, overexertion, and stress associated with emergency response occupations can contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease. OSHA therefore preliminarily finds justification to promulgate a standard which requires medical screening and prevention programming for these responders. OSHA seeks additional information and data on how emergency response activities contribute to cardiovascular disease. (iii) Respiratory Diseases and Other Respiratory Effects Emergency responders, especially firefighters, can encounter a wide variety of airborne respiratory hazards on the job, including gases, fumes, and particulates. In addition, many emergency responders are regularly exposed to diesel exhaust particulates in the course of their jobs, both responding to emergency incidents and while in ESO facilities where vehicle engines are started and run, such as in fire stations (Sparer et al., 2018, Document ID 0292; Couch et al. 2016, Document ID 0324). Emergency response equipment is commonly powered by diesel fuel, a known respiratory irritant and carcinogen. Unless adequate protective measures are taken, these exposures can impair pulmonary function and may cause respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and asthma (Barbosa et al., 2022, Document ID 0173). OSHA reviewed several studies on pulmonary function in firefighter populations. The studies identified respiratory protection as crucial for preventing lung function decline in responders. First, as explained above, several evaluations, reports, and studies that looked at emergency responder exposures to a variety of hazardous chemicals indicated that respiratory effects (e.g., cough, asthma-like symptoms) were the most frequently reported symptoms among the emergency responders who were assessed (Melnikova et al., 2018, Document ID 0246; Chiu et al., 2018a, Document ID 0191; Chiu et al., 2018c, Document ID 0186; Fent et al., 2013, Document ID 0206; Eisenberg et al., 2019, Document ID 0203; Brinker et al., 2013, Document ID 0177; Brinker et al., 2015, Document ID 0175). Melnikova et al. (2018, Document ID 0246) examined 566 acute chemical exposures among 1,460 emergency responders and found that respiratory system problems were the most common adverse health effect, constituting 56.3 percent of all adverse effects. Studies also show that firefighters experience declines in lung function after acute exposure events such as the World Trade Center disaster response and wildland firefighting activities. Two studies, both of which were reviews, reported accelerated pulmonary function declines after the World Trade Center disaster (Slattery et al., 2018, Document ID 0301; Rajnoveanu et al., 2022, Document ID 0273). A meta- analysis of 32 articles identified small but statistically significant short-term declines in lung function in response to occupational exposure to wildland fires (Groot et al., 2019, Document ID 0212). Rajnoveanu et al. (2022, Document ID 0273) included studies reporting cross-season declines in wildland firefighter lung function. Similarly, biomarker levels for oxidative stress were marginally higher following exposure to wildland fire smoke in Wu et al. (2019, Document ID 0318), suggesting that wildland fire smoke exposure can cause mild pulmonary responses. Another study found that forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) levels decreased (but non-significantly) after wildland firefighting shifts and that cross-shift FEV1 declines were more pronounced in firefighters who were exposed to higher levels of wood smoke (Gaughan et al., 2014, Document ID 0198). The more general relationship between emergency responder exposure to smoke and other harmful substances and lung function decline is less clear. For example, COPD diagnosis among firefighters was not significantly increased as compared to the general population in the majority of the 43 studies assessed in the Rajnoveanu et al. (2022, Document ID 0273) meta-analysis. Similarly, lung function was not significantly different among firefighters in a meta-analysis of 24 studies (Barbosa et al., 2022, Document ID 0173). Researchers have suggested that this could be explained by a number of factors, including the ``healthy worker effect'' and the fact that many emergency responders wear respiratory protection on the job (Rajnoveanu et al., 2022, Document ID 0273; McCluskey et al., 2014, Document ID 0262). OSHA welcomes comments and evidence about emergency responders' relative risk for COPD and other respiratory diseases. OSHA has preliminarily determined that emergency responders are exposed to combustion products and diesel exhaust that have been shown to acutely affect lung function and may lead to chronic lung conditions. OSHA therefore preliminarily finds justification to promulgate a standard which requires protective equipment and practices to limit exposure to these substances. In addition, since exposure cannot be completely eliminated due to the nature of emergency response activities, OSHA has preliminarily determined that a baseline spirometry measurement and repeated measurement as deemed medically appropriate is necessary for these responders to detect and respond to [[Page 7790]] lung-related health conditions as soon as possible in order to mitigate long-term health impacts. C. Behavioral Health The intense and stressful (both physically and mentally) situations that emergency responders encounter on the job place them at risk for a range of behavioral health impacts. OSHA's review of the literature on behavioral health among emergency responders covered general mental health issues, substance use disorders, and suicide. (i) General Mental Health Emergency responders are exposed to traumatic, emotionally charged events, and they may work long shifts, hold multiple jobs, and get inadequate rest (Alexander and Klein, 2001, Document ID 0166; Patterson et al., 2012, Document ID 0266; Weaver et al., 2015, Document ID 0298). Lack of sleep, long working hours, working in isolated locations, and repeated exposure to stressful scenarios are all risk factors for developing mental health problems (Carey et al., 2011, Document ID 0183; Kshtriya et al., 2020, Document ID 0231; Donnelly, 2012, Document ID 0201; Cash et al., 2020, Document ID 0193). OSHA's literature review on mental health focused on depression, anxiety, stress, post-traumatic stress symptoms, PTSD, and burnout. Compared with the general population, emergency responders have elevated rates of depression (Petrie et al., 2018, Document ID 0275; SAMHSA, 2018, Document ID 0286; Jahnke et al., 2012, Document ID 0235), stress (SAMHSA, 2018, Document ID 0286), PTSD (Jones et al., 2018, Document ID 0229; Petrie et al., 2018, Document ID 0275; SAMHSA, 2018, Document ID 0286), anxiety (Petrie et al., 2018, Document ID 0275), and poor sleep (Cash et al., 2020, Document ID 0193). Some articles found significant relationships between emergency response activities and PTSD, emotion regulation difficulties, and thwarted belongingness (Leonard and Vujanovic, 2021, Document ID 0255); alcohol use disorder, PTSD, trauma load, depression, and anxiety (Lebeaut et al., 2021, Document ID 0244; Lebeaut et al., 2020, Document ID 0276; Zegel et al., 2021, Document ID 0320); tinnitus and occupational stress (Odes et al., 2023, Document ID 0267); and stress and burnout on diminished safety behaviors (Smith et al., 2020, Document ID 0306). Multiple articles described healthy coping strategies and techniques that improve mental health outcomes. These included: exercise, having a strong interpersonal network, leadership support (DeMoulin et al., 2022, Document ID 0196), and finding mental fulfillment and enjoyment from the day's challenges and recovery activities (Hruska and Barduhn, 2021, Document ID 0223). Obstacles to improving mental health included: lack of resources (DeMoulin et al., 2022, Document ID 0196), an absence of medical professionals who understand situations unique to emergency responder occupations (DeMoulin et al., 2022, Document ID 0196), occupational stressors (Hruska and Barduhn, 2021, Document ID 0223), social conflict (Hruska and Barduhn, 2021, Document ID 0223), and stigmatization (DeMoulin et al., 2022, Document ID 0196). Based on this review, OSHA has preliminarily determined that emergency responders are exposed to traumatic events and psychological stress that place them at increased risk of mental health issues such as PTSD, depression, anxiety, and burnout. OSHA therefore preliminarily finds justification to promulgate a standard which requires behavioral health screening and prevention programming for these responders. (ii) Suicide According to the Firefighter Behavioral Health Alliance (FBHA), at least 1,399 suicides occurred between 2011 and 2022 among firefighters, emergency responders, and communication specialists (i.e., emergency response dispatchers). The actual number may well be higher, as many suicides are not reported or appropriately identified as work-related (FBHA, 2023). OSHA found evidence that emergency responders are at higher risk for suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts. One literature review (Stanley et al., 2016, Document ID 0310) and several studies (Abbott et al., 2015, Document ID 0169; Stanley et al., 2015, Document ID 0312; Tiesman et al., 2015, Document ID 0295; Vigil et al., 2019, Document ID 0296; Vigil et al., 2021, Document ID 0297) reported approximately three and a half times higher rates of suicide ideation and suicide attempts and approximately five times higher rates of suicide plans among emergency responders when compared to the general public. Stanley et al. (2017b, Document ID 0305) found that volunteer firefighters reported elevated levels of suicide plans and attempts compared to career firefighters. Hom et al. (2018, Document ID 0323) concluded that women firefighters exposed to suicide during their careers (either in professional or personal settings) are themselves at increased suicide risk. Stanley et al. (2017a, Document ID 0304) reported higher rates of suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and non- suicidal self-injury among women firefighters compared to the general U.S. population. Problematic alcohol use (Gallyer et al., 2018, Document ID 0209), occupational stress (Stanley et al., 2018, Document ID 0316), PTSD (Bing-Canar et al., 2019, Document ID 0174; Boffa et al., 2017, Document ID 0189; Martin et al., 2017, Document ID 0254; Stanley et al., 2019, Document ID 0308; Pennington et al., 2021, Document ID 0263), depression (Martin et al., 2017, Document ID 0254), and past physical and sexual abuse (Hom et al., 2017, Document ID 0217) were contributors to suicide risk over the course of the responder's career. The issue of suicide in the emergency response community has become so prevalent that in 2022, Congress passed and President Biden signed into law, House Resolution 6943, the Public Safety Officer Support Act, which added death by suicide to the causes of death that are eligible for benefits under the U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Assistance's Public Safety Officers Benefits Program (PSOB). OSHA has preliminarily determined that the traumatic events and psychological stress that emergency responders are exposed to places them at increased risk for death by suicide. OSHA therefore preliminarily finds justification to promulgate a standard which requires behavioral health resources for these responders. (iii) Substance Use Disorders Studies suggest that repeated exposure to traumatic situations can lead to mental health strain and post-traumatic stress (Murphy et al., 1999, Document ID 0280) coupled with substance use disorders (Hruska et al., 2011, Document ID 0227) and resorting to substance use as a coping mechanism (Vujanovic et al., 2011, Document ID 0317). During its literature review, OSHA sought articles that examined whether emergency responders have elevated rates of substance use. OSHA identified multiple articles that focused on alcohol consumption among emergency responders, two that addressed tobacco use, and one that spoke about substance use disorders more broadly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, there is evidence that emergency responders are at increased risk for problematic alcohol consumption. Several studies observed a high prevalence of increased alcohol use and at-risk drinking episodes for both male and female firefighters (Carey et al., 2011, Document ID 0183; Gallyer [[Page 7791]] et al., 2018, Document ID 0209; Haddock et al., 2012, Document ID 0214, Haddock et al., 2015, Document ID 0215, Haddock et al., 2017, Document ID 0218; Meyer et al., 2012, Document ID 0272). A few studies indicated higher rates of alcohol consumption during the first few years of fire fighter/EMS service (Haddock et al., 2015, Document ID 0215; Piazza- Gardner et al., 2014, Document ID 0248; Gulliver et al., 2019, Document ID 0216) compared with fire fighters/EMS personnel with more years of service. There is also some evidence that firefighters use alcohol as a coping mechanism (Haddock et al., 2017, Document ID 0218; Rogers et al., 2020, Document ID 0287; Tomaka et al., 2017, Document ID 0293). Literature on tobacco use among emergency responders was limited. Poston et al. (2012, Document ID 0277) indicated that smoking rates among firefighters have generally declined, whereas smokeless tobacco use has increased. Smoking regulations were cited as the primary reason for declining smoking rates, but other common reasons included fire service culture changes, impacts of smoking on job performance, and smoking costs. Jitnarin et al. (2019, Document ID 0224) found that age- adjusted smoking prevalence was lower among female firefighters (1.9 percent) than the prevalence observed for male firefighters (13.2 percent) and for adult women in the U.S. (13.5 percent). As for smokeless tobacco, age-adjusted use in female firefighters (0.5 percent) was comparable with U.S. adult women (0.3 percent), but well below rates observed for male firefighters (10.5 percent). OSHA did not identify any published research that addresses the prevalence of opioid use among emergency responders. An online article (Jahnke, 2020, Document ID 0237) confirmed the absence of published research, stating ``there is no available published research on the rates of opioid use among first responder groups, so quantifying the risk is not possible.'' That author did note, however, that ``it is important to recognize that first responders are at a high risk for opioid use disorder for several reasons,'' which were identified as high risk of injury, risky health behavior, exposure to stressors, behavioral health concerns, and sleep issues. OSHA has preliminarily determined that the traumatic events and psychological stress that emergency responders are exposed to places them at increased risk of substance abuse. OSHA therefore preliminarily finds justification to promulgate a standard which requires behavioral health resources for these responders. D. Exposure to Violence At times, emergency responders encounter belligerent behaviors because the people they are trying to help, their family members, or nearby bystanders are not receptive to assistance. This can lead to conflict and may result in emergency responders being subjected to verbal aggression and/or physical violence, which can be a contributing factor to mental health problems or cause injuries. Additionally, emergency responders are sometimes called to respond to situations that have a law enforcement aspect that has not been fully resolved or contained by police (e.g., active shooter situations). Exposure to violence incidents can result in both observable traumatic injuries as well as significant mental health impacts. OSHA found multiple studies that document workplace violence against emergency responders. Only one study addressed emergency responders who were injured from violent interactions. Taylor et al. found that male and female paramedics were at increased likelihood of patient-initiated violent injury compared to male and female firefighters (Taylor et al., 2016, Document ID 0313). In the Murray et al. 2020 review (Document ID 0249), the authors found violence to be the leading cause of stress and that stress was the most frequent injury reported by EMS survey respondents. Violence exposure was found to be associated with increased levels of stress, fear, and anxiety in EMS responders. The review found that exposures to workplace violence, especially cumulative exposures, in concert with other job stressors, were associated with adverse mental health outcomes such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Most other studies did not indicate whether the violence actually led to adverse health effects, such as mental health issues or physical injuries. The studies provide insight on the types of violence occurring among emergency response populations and the prevalence between different groups (e.g., men versus women). Estimates of the proportion of emergency responders who reported experiencing at least one type of violence on the job ranged from 57 to 93 percent (Gormley et al., 2016, Document ID 0208; Murray et al., 2020, Document ID 0249). Survey-based results in Gormley et al. (2016, Document ID 0208) found that verbal aggression was the most common form experienced (67.0 percent), but physical violence was reported by 43.6 percent of respondents. These findings fell in line with the review- based results (from 104 studies) provided in Murray et al. (2020, Document ID 0249), which indicated that 21 to 88 percent of emergency responders reported experiencing verbal aggression and 23 to 90 percent reported experiencing physical violence. Additionally, multiple studies assessed risks for occupational violence among different types of emergency responders. Paramedics were found to be at significantly higher risk for occupational violence compared to both firefighters (Taylor et al., 2016, Document ID 0313; Murray et al., 2020, Document ID 0249) and emergency medical technicians (Gormley et al., 2016, Document ID 0208; NAEMT, 2019, Document ID 0264). In general, responders who provided more direct patient care were at a higher risk for violence (Murray et al., 2020, Document ID 0249). Three studies investigated differences in workplace violence risks between male and female emergency responders, with mixed results. NAEMT (2019, Document ID 0264) found that percentages of reported physical and verbal assaults among National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians members were higher for males than females. In contrast, Taylor et al. (2016, Document ID 0313) found that female responders had increased odds (though not statistically significant) of suffering patient-initiated violent injuries compared to male responders, and Gormley et al. (2016) reported increased odds of experiencing physical violence among female personnel compared to male personnel. The studies do not break down violence exposure by race or ethnicity. OSHA has preliminarily determined that emergency responders are exposed to verbal aggression and physical violence at their workplaces that may lead both to physical injury and to adverse behavioral health outcomes. B. Events Leading to the Proposed Rule The existing 29 CFR 1910.156, Fire Brigades standard was promulgated in 1980 (45 FR 60656 (Sept. 12, 1980)). In the time since, there have been significant improvements in PPE and the guidance provided by national consensus standards. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, all government agencies, including OSHA, were directed to strengthen their preparedness to respond to terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies. In response to this direction, the agency reviewed its standards applicable to the safe conduct of emergency response and [[Page 7792]] identified gaps in the protections for emergency responders. The agency determined that it should proceed in the process for potentially updating its standard for Fire Brigades and consider including other emergency responders. In 2007, OSHA published a 41-question Request for Information (RFI) for the public to evaluate what action, if any, the agency should take to further address emergency response and preparedness (72 FR 51735 (Sept. 11, 2007)). The RFI encouraged commenters to provide input covering the scope of emergency response operations, personal protective clothing and equipment, training and qualifications, medical evaluation and health monitoring, safety, and economic impacts related to potential regulatory action. The agency received 85 responses largely in support of updating the existing rule. On July 30 and 31, 2014, OSHA hosted stakeholder meetings that attracted 49 participants and approximately the same number of observers (Document ID 0087). Participants represented a broad range of emergency responders as well as allied stakeholders such as State plan representatives, skilled support workers, and law enforcement. Broad support for a comprehensive standard was evident in both days of stakeholder meetings. Participants favored OSHA proceeding with comprehensive rulemaking that covered a broad scope of emergency preparedness and response workers rather than the agency's historical perspective covering industrial fire brigades. In September 2015, OSHA convened a NACOSH subcommittee to develop recommendations, including regulatory text for a proposed rule, for NACOSH to consider (Docket ID OSHA-2015-0019-0001). To assist the Subcommittee, OSHA provided draft regulatory language for the purpose of initiating and facilitating discussion (Docket ID OSHA-2015-0019- 0002, Ex. 5). The Subcommittee participants were subject matter experts from major stakeholder entities that represented a broad range of emergency response experts, who provided balance and a diversity of views. The Subcommittee was co-chaired by two NACOSH members, a labor representative, and a management representative. The Subcommittee met for 12 days in six in-person meetings and held numerous sub-group teleconferences from September 9, 2015, to September 9, 2016 (Docket ID OSHA-2015-0019). The members heard and discussed reports from the subgroups, and deliberated on various issues, as they developed their recommendations and proposed regulatory text. The Subcommittee completed its recommendations for a proposed rule and transmitted the documents to the full NACOSH in October 2016 (Docket ID OSHA-2015-0019-0035). NACOSH met on December 14, 2016, and after hearing some public support for the project and deliberating over the draft document developed by the Subcommittee, voted unanimously to recommend to the Secretary of Labor that OSHA proceed with rulemaking using the draft language as the basis for developing a proposed rule. On October 4, 2021, OSHA convened a SBAR Panel for a potential Emergency Response draft proposed standard (Document ID 0094). OSHA convened this panel under section 609(b) of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., as amended by SBREFA. 5 U.S.C. 609(b). The panel included representatives from OSHA, the Office of Advocacy within the SBA, and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget. SERs made oral and written comments on the draft regulatory framework and submitted them to the panel. The Panel received advice and recommendations from the SERs and reported its findings and recommendations to OSHA. OSHA has taken SERs' comments and the Panel's findings and recommendations into consideration in the development of the proposed rule. The SBREFA Panel issued a report on December 2, 2021, which included the SERs' comments. SERs expressed concerns about the impact of the proposed rule on small and volunteer fire departments. Their comments addressed potential costs associated with compliance with the proposed rule's medical screening, physical fitness, and training requirements. In addition, many SERs were concerned with OSHA's extensive use of NFPA consensus standards in the development of the draft regulation. They were concerned about the costs associated with compliance with the proposed rule if OSHA incorporated by reference certain NFPA standards (Document ID 0115). I. Preliminary Determination of Significant Risk and Material Impairment As explained in section III, Pertinent Legal Authority, the OSH Act and Supreme Court precedent require OSHA to determine, prior to issuing a safety or health standard, that employees are being subjected to a significant risk of serious injury or material impairment of health or functional capacity by the hazards being targeted. OSHA has reviewed the evidence currently in the record, including the data and scientific studies discussed above; the comments received in response to the 2007 Emergency Response RFI, from SERs during the SBREFA process, and from NACOSH; and industry consensus as evidenced in the various NFPA consensus standards, and preliminarily determined that emergency response activities place team members and responders at significant risk of personal injury, several acute and chronic health conditions, and death. As identified above, the documented serious injuries suffered by emergency responders are numerous, including fractures, sprains, internal bodily trauma, dislocations, chemical burns, and chemical pneumonia. There can also be little doubt that the morbidity and mortality risks posed by cancer, cardiovascular disease, and lung disease represent material impairments of health and functional capacity. In addition, the adverse mental health outcomes resulting from emergency response activities, including substance use disorder, PTSD, depression, anxiety, burnout, and suicidality, can significantly impair responders' quality of life and limit their ability to function in daily life, can cause or exacerbate other physical conditions, and, in the worst cases, can lead to death. Accordingly, OSHA preliminarily finds these behavioral health effects represent a serious impairment of health. C. National Consensus Standards In development of the proposed rule, OSHA extensively examined numerous relevant consensus standards. The NFPA standards are available to be viewed without cost at https://www.nfpa.org/for-professionals/codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/free-access. ANSI/ISEA standards are available for purchase at https://webstore.ansi.org. Many of the provisions in the "
