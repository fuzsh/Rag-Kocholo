To date, over fifty, high-impact factor, peer-reviewed journal published, leading academics have delivered a total of 70 lectures, 25 masterclasses, and 15 outdoor workshops, to in excess of 600 delegates drawn from across the globe.\n\nDates: Wed 10th — Sat 13th April 2019\n\nLocation: RACV Resort Torquay, 1 Great Ocean Rd,\n\nTorquay, Victoria 3228, Australia.\n\nREGISTER NOW\n\nINVITATION TO PARTICIPATE\n\nSurfers\n\nHealth Care Professionals\n\nLifeguards & Water Patrol\n\nEnvironmental & Sport Scientists\n\nStudents\n\nOFFICIAL PARTNERSHIP\n\nThe Melbourne Convention Bureau is official partner of the World Conference on Surfing Medicine – MCB is providing assistance to Surfing Medicine International to bring this unique event to Australia, Victoria Region.\n\nSurfrider Foundation Australia\n\nSurfrider Foundation Australia is a registered not for profit sea-roots organisation dedicated to the protection of Australia’s waves and beaches through Conservation, Activism, Research and Education C.A.R.E.\n\nWaves of Wellness\n\nWaves of Wellness (WOW) Foundation is an Australian mental health surf therapy charity, committed to changing lives by delivering innovative support programs for people experiencing mental health challenges.\n\nLife Saving Victoria\n\nLife Saving Victoria (est. 2002) is an initiative of the Royal Life Saving Society Australia Victoria Branch (est. 1904) and Surf Life Saving Victoria (est. 1947). Life Saving Victoria’s mission is to prevent aquatic related death and injury in all Victorian communities and has the vision that all Victorians will learn water safety, swimming and resuscitation and be provided with safe aquatic environments and venues.\n\nThe Plastic Soup Foundation\n\nThe Plastic Soup Foundation is one of the leading advocacy groups to tackle plastic pollution, it stimulates all possible (innovative) solutions which help tackle the causes of plastic soup at source. Measures which prevent plastic entering the environment, water and possibly ending up in the sea have the greatest impact in our opinion. This includes reducing the amount of single-use consumer plastics, the development of a plastic footprint for companies as well as smart devices which collect plastic in waterways.\n\nSurfing Victoria\n\nSurfing Victoria is recognized by the State Government of Victoria and surf industry as the organizing body for surfing in Victoria. Surfing Victoria conducts a range of age and discipline events, also, educational programs to coaches, instructors, recreational surfers and competitors.\n\nSurf Coast Shire\n\nSurf Coast Shire has been recognized as one of Victoria’s fastest growing municipalities for more than a decade.

SMI will provide a platform for Surfers, Students, Scientists, Water Safety Experts/Lifeguards and Health care professionals.\n\nDay 1 – Health & Injury Prevention\n\nOn day 1 we focus on Surfers’ Health and Injury Prevention with special focus on drowning, remote environment first-response, injury prevention, UV-protection, and mental health. Against the backdrop of a changing surfing landscape (i.e. arrival, and assimilation, of artificial wave venues, imminent Olympic sport status, etc.).\n\nDay 2 – Training Performance\n\nDay Two will explore evolving Training and Performance approaches in elite surfing, considering aspects such as positive psychology, emotional regulation and stress management, high performance training – Youth Academy to Elite, and sports nutrition amongst others.\n\nDay 3 – Ocean Environment\n\nCognisant of arguably the greatest threat to continued human existence of this planet, our final day programme will look in-depth at the Ocean Environment. Scientific consensus acknowledges the detrimental effect of increasing global ambient and water temperatures, the latter especially on marine environments. Furthermore, established human behaviour and consumption patterns in westernized (‘developed’) economies jars with meaningful suggestions towards sustainability. What can the ordinary surfer do? On Day Three, you will hear from people on the frontline in microplastics, effects on human health, ocean cleanup, water quality improvement, and how they are effecting positive change in their communities and beyond.\n\nNext to the lecture programme, the World Conference on Surfing Medicine will provide an unique learning environment for the participants to interact with experts, get hands on skills in outdoor and real test setting.\n\n1) Master class session small lecture environment\n\n2) Testing & Learning (Training & Performance)\n\n3) Skill Stations : Drowning Resuscitation, Surf First Aid, Lifeguarding / Water Safety\n\n4) Abstract and community project presentations\n\nKEYNOTE SPEAKER\n\nProf. Marc in het Panhuis: Developer of 3D printed surfboard fins, Professor at the University of Wollongong.\n\nJennifer Straatman,MD: Surgical Registrar The Netherlands, Board Member SMI, Female Leadership.\n\nA/Prof. David Kennedy: Director, Office for Environmental Programs, University of Melbourne.\n\nSacha Guggenheimer: Marine Biologist, Photographer and filmmaker on the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia.\n\nAdam Robertson: Surfing Victoria CEO, former professional surfer.\n\nRichard Wallace: Practice Principal and Partner at Kieser Training Geelong.\n\nAnne Schmidt, MD: Emergency Medicine Specialist, wellbeing and performance, combining family & career, Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nSusie Crick: National Chairwoman of the Surfrider Foundation, Plastic Pollution Director and South Coast Branch President\n\nAllan Mackillop,MD: Medical Director, World Surf League, Chief Medical Officer Aeromedical Services LifeFlight, Anaesthetic and Retrieval Specialist\n\nDr Oliver Farley: Lead of Strength and Conditioning Coach for Surfing New Zealand.\n\nNatalie Hood, MD: Medical Director for Surf Life Saving Australia (SLSA), Paediatric Emergency Physician, Drowning Resuscitation.\n\nMischa Goettinger, MD: Driving force behind the Surf Life Support Courses, SMI app developer, sports physician.\n\nRichy Bennett: First psychologist to work globally on the WSL, author of The Surfer’s Mind, Jan Juc Victoria, Australia.\n\nBrandon Lindberg, MD: Fellowship trained foot and ankle surgeon, specializes in sports medicine, trauma and advanced deformity correction of the lower extremity.\n\nWendy Henderson, MD: Emergency Physician, Geelong, WSL Tour Physician Experience, Surfing Medicine and female leadership\n\nOgi Markovic, MD: Vision and Performance, High Performance Surf Coach Postgraduate, Uni.
