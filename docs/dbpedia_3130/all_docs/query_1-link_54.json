        "text": "There are currently 314 clubs in Australia with more than 175,000 members that protect beachgoers around the country’s coastline. All 314 clubs in Australia’s Surf Life Saving movement are associated with Surf Life Saving Australia (SLSA), the organisation’s national governing body. The International Life Saving Federation (ILS) is a member of the SLSA, which has been instrumental in the growth of the lifesaving movement globally.\n\nThere are four administrative/ governance layers in Surf Life Saving:\n\n• National (SLSA),\n\n• State\n\n• Branch\n\n• Club.\n\nThe affiliation between the states and territorial associations and a breakdown of their approximative membership numbers are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe SLSA Board is the governing board of SLSQ. Every state association, as well as Northern Territory, is represented on the SLSA Board and their State President and meets quarterly throughout each calendar year."
