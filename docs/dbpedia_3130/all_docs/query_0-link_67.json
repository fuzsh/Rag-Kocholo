Who we are Our profile Surf Life Saving Australia (SLSA) is Australia’s major water safety, drowning prevention and rescue authority. We are the largest volunteer organisation of our kind in the country. Our core activities are: • Coastal safety and lifesaving (see page 24) • Fitness and sport (see page 32) • Member and organisational development (see page 40). Our history Australia’s first volunteer surf life saving clubs appeared on Sydney’s ocean beaches in 1907. By-laws which had banned bathing in daylight hours since the 1830s were gradually repealed between 1902 and 1905, in response to the increasing popularity of surf-bathing, and a growing conviction that bathing in appropriate clothing was not an immoral act. The impact these changes had on local beach culture was dramatic: beachgoers entered the surf in rapidly escalating numbers. The surf was new to most surf-bathers and many could not swim, so with its increasing popularity came more drowning and consequent attempts at rescue. By the summer of 1906-07, the population of Sydney was obsessed with the question of the safety of the surf. It was in this environment that surf life saving clubs first emerged, their regular patrols a welcome relief to local authorities and nervous bathers alike. On 18 October 1907, representatives from these clubs, together with members of other interested groups, met to form the Surf Bathing Association of New South Wales, the organisation now known as Surf Life Saving Australia. Our vision To provide great beach experiences. Our mission To provide a safe beach and aquatic environment throughout Australia. Our driving forces To save lives in the water. To promote a healthy, inclusive, clean, family lifestyle. How we fulfil our mission Our total membership of more than 153,000 is spread across 306 affiliated surf life saving clubs (see page 164), and more than 60 ‘support operations’ – (motorised units of RWCs, RIBs, JRBs and ORBs – see glossary). Of our 153,000 members, around 43,800 actively patrol our beaches and 58,000 are ‘nippers’ (junior surf lifesavers aged from 5 to 13). The majority of our services are provided by surf lifesavers who complete surf patrols in their own time – usually a half-day patrol every three to four weeks during the surf swimming season. We also operate the country’s largest lifeguard service, contracting to local government and other coastal land managers. In the 2009-10 season, our volunteer patrol members were involved in 9,420 rescues, while our paid lifeguards performed an additional 2,492 rescues. Our stakeholders It is estimated there are more than 100 million beach visitations each year, making Australia’s beaches and coastline the country’s largest and most popular playground. Our principal stakeholders are therefore those who use the Australian coastline, and those who are directly or indirectly impacted by our actions. We engage with our stakeholders in order to further our goal of saving lives in the water. Within this group, we have direct relationships with a number of stakeholders – our members, our corporate and government partners our supporters and donors and our employees. We also have an indirect relationship with the broader community and it is this group we must influence in order to reduce the rate of coastal drowning deaths. Who are our stakeholders? Internal • Staff: The nature of our relationship with our staff is described on page 79 • Our “owners”: Our state and territory centres represent our members on the Australian Council. We have regular contact with our owners through board meetings and the other forums outlined in the Boards and Committees section of this report. Corporate Sector • Corporate partners: We rely on a number of corporate partners to fund the majority of our programs, these partnerships are outlined on page 48. Occasionally, we enter the market seeking partners for new properties and programs. Government Sector • Australian Government departments and agencies: We rely on support for many of our programs from the following Australian Government departments and agencies: – Australian Sports Commission – Department of Health and Ageing – Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations 8\n\n11. – Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts – Tourism Australia • Other levels of government: Our state centres have direct relationships with state governments, while our clubs liaise with their relevant local government. On occasion, SLSA will form a relationship with state and local governments on particular activities, particularly when organising sporting events. • Parliamentarians: In order to strengthen our reputation we engage in proactive advocacy with elected members of parliament, particularly those representing coastal seats. Community • Our members: We have a duty of care to protect our members as they carry out their duties on and off the beach. We are constantly developing and improving our lines of communication with our members through an integrated suite of online platforms. • Potential members: We depend on new recruits to maintain and increase lifesaving services. We don’t have a regular national recruitment campaign targeting new members, and rely on media, informal networks and the efforts of state centres and clubs to attract new members. • Potential donors: The Surf Life Saving Foundation conducts a number of community fundraising campaigns each year, see page 56 for specific information. • Beach-going community: We communicate with the community via a variety of different programs and channels, including public advertising campaigns and the distribution of educational resources. Funding We are a charity and rely on our corporate partners and the Australian Government to fund the majority of our activities (see page 48). This income is supplemented with royalties derived from trademark licensing (that is, organisations pay us for the use of our intellectual property, principally the red and yellow cap, flags and patrol uniforms). A small amount is also received from fees for competitions, conferences and the like. SLSA is not an active fundraiser, although from time to time we benefit from unsolicited bequests and donations. Certain subsidiary companies of ours do conduct community fundraising appeals and the details of all of these activities, including costs, are listed in our financial statements. The Surf Life Saving Foundation (which reports separately) actively conducts fundraising around Australia on behalf of SLSA and our state centres (see page 48 for details), while surf life saving clubs also conduct their own fundraising activities. To support their lifesaving activities our state centres (which also report separately) are engaged in commercial activities such as education, training and the provision of contract lifeguard services to local government and other land managers. Statutory obligations and oversight SLSA is a company limited by guarantee under the Corporations Act 2001 (Commonwealth). The Surf Life Saving Foundation operates under the charitable fundraising legislation in each of the states and territories it is registered (see page 48). SLSA and its subsidiaries are also public benevolent institutions under the NSW Charitable Fundraising Act 1991 (NSW). Our strategies The focus of our strategic management plan is to develop the capacity and capability of the Surf Life Saving movement to deliver quality services to meet the growing needs of beach visitors and our members. There are six strategic priorities which we pursue to achieve our mission: • Preventing deaths and injuries in the water. • Delivering our peak body responsibilities. • Leading a strong, viable national organisation. • Building frontline capacity and capability. • Contributing to a healthy nation. • Supporting SLSA’s core objectives via enjoyable and entertaining surf sports. About this report This is the annual report of SLSA Ltd. The surf lifesaving movement is made up of almost 450 separate legal entities, ranging from state centres, clubs, branches and support operations. The financial accounts of these entities, whose relationship with SLSA Ltd is further described on page 164, are not consolidated here. However, the activities and achievements of all Australia’s surf lifesavers are consolidated and reported. Notice of Annual General Meeting Notice is given of the Annual General Meeting of SLSA Ltd. The meeting will be held on Saturday 30 October, 2010, 2010 at Surf Life Saving Australia’s new offices at 789 Botany Road, Rosebery NSW. All SLSA members are welcome to attend. 9 SurfLifeSavingAustraliaAnnualReport2009-102009-10overview\n\n12. How we are meeting our targets Our Strategic Management Plan, Saving Lives in the Water 2007-2011 lists our priorities and the strategies and tactics to achieve them. Our achievements against these targets are reported in detail from pages 12 to 55. We have distilled the various strategies into seven key drivers, which, if achieved, will meet many of the goals outlined in our strategic plan. Our key drivers are: • Growing lifesaving and emergency services capabilities. • Enhancing knowledge/intelligence creation via research. • Building smart, effective ICT systems. • Growing sustainable and diversified revenues. • Improving alignment, integration and delivery of ‘owning the beach’ strategies and program. • Enhancing and formalising SLSA’s peak authority status and reputation. • Implementation of SLSA’s continuous improvement plan.

It is my pleasure to present the 2009-10 Annual Report of Surf Life Saving Australia (SLSA) Ltd. This will be the ninth and final annual report I present as President of this wonderful and uniquely Australian organisation. It has been an extreme honour to head SLSA through a period of unprecedented growth and development and a privilege to be only the fifth elected voluntary President of this highly respected organisation. As a member of a seventh generation Australian family it has been a very satisfying experience to be part of the Surf Life Saving (SLS) movement and give something back to the country I love so dearly and to humanity. This report illustrates the incredible workload of the entire SLS movement of clubs, branches, state centres and the national body, which has developed a focused strategic direction to enable SLS to grow and provide services appropriate for the 21st century. Together with the CEO, Brett Williamson OAM and the directors of SLSA, I commend to you this comprehensive annual report which reflects on another outstanding year for SLS in Australia. Relevance through achievement 2009-10 has been incredibly demanding on the organisation with numerous national projects underway and considerable energy being absorbed by important strategic and operational initiatives to continue to build national capacity and capability and at the same time, measure organisational performance. Like any business of the size and complexity of SLS, reviews are necessary from time to time to ensure that the organisation is performing as efficiently and effectively as possible. During the past year an Organisational Effectiveness Review was undertaken to further clarify the separation between governance, strategy and management as well as improving the alignment of action across the entire organisation. A number of necessary enhancements and a more contemporary governance and management model have been adopted to meet the organisation’s unprecedented growth rate. In addition to the Organisational Effectiveness Review, the following points stand out as significant achievements during 2009-10, which are reported on in more detail throughout the report: • Volunteers contributed 1.3 million patrol hours. • Total membership grew to over 153,000. • Revision of the SLSA Constitution and Regulations. • Commencement of the national ICT project. • Acquisition and renovation of new SLSA HQ at Rosebery in Sydney. • Establishment of a SLSA Research Committee. • Development of a new national brand campaign. • In-principle agreement with the states to establish the Surf Life Saving Foundation nationally. • Expansion of helicopter rescue services with additional support from Westpac. Australian Council The Australian Council has again contributed considerably to the further strategic development and good governance of SLSA, with outstanding support from very effective staff at national and state offices. May I take this opportunity to particularly thank the CEO Brett Williamson OAM and the directors; John Fitzgerald OAM, Peter George AM, Dave Thompson, Rick Wright OAM, Mike Martin, Ken Bird OAM, Bob Creek, Greg Bird, Bill Jamieson ASFM, Tony Haven and Mark Irwin for their commitment and important contributions throughout 2009-10. In 2009-10 a new Constitution was adopted which will see a significant change to the governance of SLSA going forward. Under the new Constitution the directors appointed by the state centres will constitute the “Council” and the SLSA “Board of Directors” will be made up of the President, State Appointed Directors, three Elected Directors and up to a further two Independent Directors. In 2009-10 David Thompson resigned from his position as Director of Surf Sports and was subsequently employed as the General Manager of Sport. John Fitzgerald OAM will be completing a lengthy term as the Director of Development at the 2010 AGM. I would like to acknowledge the considerable voluntary contribution to SLSA by both these gentlemen and thank them for their personal support and the many achievements they contributed to. We welcomed Rick Wright OAM to the position of Director of Surf Sports. Organisational sustainability SLSA adopted a financial management strategy this past year that is aimed at diversification and growth, as well as increased accountability to consolidate the organisation’s long term sustainability and increased capacity. SLSA has managed to continue to work within budget and while many important national projects could not be adequately resourced during 2009-10, important President's Foreword 14\n\n17. priority projects have been maintained with the financial assistance of the Australian Government, our major partners and supporters. Given that we experienced the most difficult economic period for many years, SLSA has emerged with a pleasing result through effective diversification of revenue and prudent management. International activities SLSA’s contribution to international lifesaving and global drowning prevention continued during 2009-10 with the roll-out of several aid programs, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, thanks to the valued support of the Kevin Weldon AM International Aid Program. Currently, there is some level of SLSA activity or aid being delivered in 25 countries. SLSA has adopted a more coordinated approach to its aid programs through the work undertaken by SLSA General Manager of Strategic Development, Norm Farmer ESM. This will give greater justification and substance to aid provided, and look at the future sustainability of these programs. SLSA has also been selected to host the Lifesaving World Championships in Adelaide in 2012, and the 2009-10 period saw a comprehensive plan developed to deliver this event for the ILS. Our partners and supporters I take this opportunity to record SLSA’s sincere thanks to all our partners, supporters and donors for their generosity and valued assistance. Without your help, SLS would not be the organisation it is today. Please stay involved. I would also like to thank the Australian Government, as well as the various state and local governments around the country that contributed to vital infrastructure, equipment and support programs. My sincere thanks to the entire Australian community for their support. The Future The future of the organisation is, in my opinion, well- planned and while there will be a need for further change I am confident that the organisation will continue to respond and adapt to meet any challenge. The past year has recorded many achievements to assist the next stage of the strategic revolution of SLS in Australia. The organisation will need to consider important strategic initiatives such as the Australian Sports Academy, better pathways and opportunities for youth, greater service capacity across 365 days per year and to brand and behave like one national organisation to achieve our potential. Thank you It has again been my absolute honour and privilege to serve as the Honorary President of this great Australian organisation. One of the great achievements of my life has been to head this organisation and be elected as the fifth President of SLSA, as I reflect at the conclusion of a nine-year term. Like most involved in SLS I am just a volunteer surf lifesaver who has tried to make a difference. While my role has been very demanding of my time and resources, it would not be possible to undertake the role without the support of the Australian Council and the incredible output of the SLSA and state officers and staff who have all been a privilege to work with. The passionate and committed volunteer members of SLS never cease to impress me wherever I have travelled. Congratulations to all our members, clubs, branches, states and the Northern Territory, our subsidiary companies and all those throughout Australia that support SLS. Also a special thank you to all the boards and committees of SLSA for their outstanding and dedicated work during 2009-10. May I take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to the elected directors, John Fitzgerald OAM, Peter George AM, Dave Thompson and Rick Wright OAM and our CEO who have carried the workload of SLSA and the Australian Council efficiently and diligently. It is these people who have provided the leadership and direction to SLSA. My personal thanks to CEO Brett Williamson OAM, for his untiring professional support and commitment to SLS and for his valuable advice and assistance to me as President. It is always a pleasure to work with people you respect and trust. In my time as President I also worked with Greg Nance as CEO, who I also hold in the highest regard. The past nine years have been an incredible journey for both SLSA and for me as President. I have made myself available for the organisation every day for nine years and only one person fully knows the commitments and sacrifices that have been made. May I record my deep appreciation to my wonderful wife Susan for her untiring support of an old surf lifesaver with a passion. Thank you. Ron Rankin AM President SurfLifeSavingAustraliaAnnualReport2009-10President’sForewordCEO’sReport 15\n\n18. This report details the achievements of Surf Life Saving Australia (SLSA) Ltd during 2009-10, drawing together information from almost 450 entities within the Surf Life Saving (SLS) movement. The majority of these are separate legal entities and are required to report on their performance elsewhere, however, many of their activities are reported here to provide a single point of reference for the performance of SLS in Australia. SLS has experienced continued growth in 2009-10, with a 2% increase in membership nationally to over 153,000. Significantly, there were growths in male, female and junior memberships, indicating the growing popularity of SLS across all demographics. On the beach, SLS clubs and support operations performed their services with outstanding success, ensuring Australia’s largest and most popular playground – our beaches – remain the safest in the world. SLSA has continued to fulfil its role as the peak body for coastal safety in Australia, contributing to a wide range of government reviews. We have also maintained our standing as a world leader in coastal safety, both through the International Life Saving Federation (ILS) and directly with many national lifesaving federations around the world. 2009-10 was also a year of grief for SLS in Australia. In March 2010, Saxon Bird of Queenscliff SLSC tragically passed away while competing at the Australian Surf Life Saving Championships. Saxon was an extremely talented athlete and committed surf lifesaver who represented the very best of what the SLS movement is about. Our thoughts will always remain with Saxon’s family, friends, and the Queenscliff SLSC. Non-financial performance Performance management In May 2007, SLSA adopted a strategic management plan – Saving Lives in the Water 2007-11. This plan provides a platform for the strategic development and operational delivery for SLSA and states. Performance management against this plan is critical to ensure that resources are being allocated based on priorities and needs. To assist the Australian Council (AC) and management, a regular reporting cycle has been developed which allows for the monitoring of progress and success, and the early identification of areas that require attention. Following the presentation of the ‘report card’ to the AC in March 2010, a series of ‘key drivers’ were confirmed that, when delivered, will have an enabling effect on many of the strategies identified in the plan. The key drivers are: • Growing lifesaving and emergency services capabilities. • Enhancing knowledge/intelligence creation via research. • Building smart, effective ICT systems. • Growing sustainable and diversified revenues. • Improving alignment, integration and delivery of ‘owning the beach’ strategies and programs. • Enhancing and formalising SLSA’s peak authority status and reputation. • Implementation of SLSA’s continuous improvement plan. Performance against key drivers Growing lifesaving and emergency services capabilities. In 2009-10, we once again focused on the delivery of the SLSA Total Service Plan, with an overarching strategy to educate all Australians about rip currents and to reinforce the message, “Swim between the Red and Yellow flags”. Two targeted programs focussing on rock fishers and international tourists and migrants have also been developed, while local drowning interventions continued to be funded under the SLSA Black Spot Program. As a member of the Australian Water Safety Council (AWSC), SLSA was a key contributor to the 2010 Australian Water Safety Conference, which provided a unique opportunity to present our latest initiatives on drowning prevention and research to an audience of key water safety stakeholders. SLSA is committed to working in collaboration with other key water safety organisations to ensure the drowning toll decreases. Enhancing knowledge via research. 2009-10 has seen the adoption of the National Research Agenda by the AC. This has resulted in the creation of a Research Advisory Committee, consisting of a number of esteemed researchers from a range of research disciplines, and the engagement of a National Research Manager. This committee will facilitate the expansion and coordination of SLSA research activities, to underpin SLSA’s philosophy of evidence-based practice and fostering innovation. Towards the end of the financial year, research projects were reaching finalisation with the University of New South Wales and the University of Technology, Sydney. CEO's Report 16\n\n19. Building smart, effective ICT systems. SLSA’s revolutionary ICT Project, aimed at improving the ICT systems used by SLS members and staff nationally has made significant progress in 2009- 10. In August 2009, $4.4m in funding was gratefully received from the Department of Health and Ageing, contributing significantly to the overall cost of this project. The project has been separated into three sub-phases, with the project due for completion in June 2012. Significantly, Sub-Phase 1 was completed in June 2010. Growing sustainable and diversified revenues. Following discussions between SLSA, the Surf Life Saving Foundation (SLSF) and state centre representatives, agreement has been reached to establish a national fundraising foundation. Our retail program was also expanded during the year and we will be launching a new range of SLS branded sunscreen later in 2010. Work on redefining our retail and licensing programs continued. Improving alignment, integration and delivery of ‘owning the beach’ strategies and programs. To ensure SLSA continues to grow as an organisation, we undertook a major survey of SLS members in 2009-10 to better understand our brand, and how we can better service our membership. The ‘Can Do’ member survey received over 1,000 suggestions and nearly 7,500 votes from members across Australia. The results from the survey were released in 2010 and identified areas in which our members thought we could improve. SLSA is now working to improve our operations and ensure that we respond to the needs of our membership. Enhancing and formalising SLSA’s peak authority status and reputation. SLSA and state centres continued to provide substantive submissions to all levels of government on a diverse range of topics including coastal safety, emergency services, sport, education, taxation, climate change and intellectual property. Quarterly BeachSafe newsletters were also issued and the annual National Coastal Safety Report was produced to identify trends in coastal drowning deaths. Implementation of SLSA’s continuous improvement plan. SLSA commissioned the Barrington Consulting Group to complete an Organisational Effectiveness Review of SLSA during 2009-10, resulting in some forty recommendations across governance, strategy and management. A Continuous Improvement Plan (CIP) was subsequently developed to progress the issues arising from the review. Many key elements of the CIP such as revising the SLSA constitution, regulations and governance policy were advanced considerably during 2009-10. Financial performance 2008-09 was a difficult year for all organisations around the world as a result of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), and while the Australian economy enjoyed a year of growth during 2009-10, organisations such as SLSA still faced challenges. Despite this, SLSA’s corporate and government support continued to grow, which allowed SLSA to again record a reasonable financial position at the end of the financial year. At 30 June 2010, the parent entity, SLSA Ltd had net assets of $6,645,279 with a current ratio of 1.41, still well above the industry benchmark of 1.00. As reported in the 2008-09 annual report, the board elected to purchase a new building at Rosebery in Sydney during the year. This was made possible due to the financial position of the organisation at the end of 2008-09. This change in SLSA’s holding of assets has been the predominant reason for the reduction in the SLSA current ratio from 2.03 at the end of 2008/09. SLSA will move into the new premises in October 2010. Community and Corporate Support We have maintained strong relationships with our three major partners Westpac, DHL and Telstra throughout 2009-10. Westpac announced an increase of almost $2 million per year to SLS’s Helicopter Rescue Services to help extend its presence in high risk areas around Australia. Telstra extended its naming rights support of the Telstra Beach to Bush program, which will provide surf safety advice and education to over 40,000 children. And thanks to DHL, every patrolling surf lifesaver in Australia had access to a new uniform. We are extremely grateful for the support of all our corporate supporters. We have also seen a significant growth in the number community donors to the Surf Life Saving Foundation in 2009-10, demonstrating the importance of SLS to the general public. Significantly, an agreement, in principle, has been reached to get serious about building the fundraising capacities of all National and State and Territory SLS entities, through a national Surf Life Saving Foundation. It is appropriate to acknowledge Surf Life Saving Queensland’s foresight in establishing the state- based Foundation originally and for providing the confidence to SLSA and states to evolve the Foundation into a national entity. A formal decision on the creation of a national Surf Life Saving Foundation will be made in 2010-11. As a reflection of confidence in the proposition, SLSA has agreed to guarantee financial returns to the states for the first three years. Government support The Australian Government has continued to be a major supporter of SLSA with increased funding throughout 2009-10. The government’s support of water safety initiatives continued via the Recreation SurfLifeSavingAustraliaAnnualReport2009-10President’sForewordCEO’sReport 17\n\n20. and Safety Program and the Saving Lives in the Water initiative. This funding is vital to the services that SLS provides and is greatly appreciated. The challenge is to ensure that this funding increases to match the demand placed on this organisation to deliver the range of priorities which remain unfunded. In the 2010 Federal Government budget, the Government announced a significant injection of funds into Australian sport. As a result, SLSA were asked to lodge a submission to the Australian Sports Commission, requesting access to additional resources to support the growth of sport. SLSA received advice that it will receive a significant boost in its High Performance funding to assist in growing our elite pathways. Appointments and retirements of directors During 2009-10, David Thompson submitted his resignation as the Director of Surf Sports for SLSA, effective 7 May 2010, with Rick Wright OAM being appointed to this role on 8 May 2010. SLSA thanks David for his significant contribution during his time as a director, and can be assured that he will continue to contribute to the organisation in his role as a member of staff. At the 2010 SLSA Annual General Meeting, SLSA will also see the resignation of two long standing directors. Ron Rankin AM will retire as the SLSA President, a position he has held since 2001, and John Fitzgerald OAM will retire as the SLSA Director of Development, a position he has held since 2002. Both of these men have made significant contributions to SLSA over many years. We would like to thank both Ron and John for their contributions. Organisational outlook 2009-10 has been positive for SLSA across all major financial and non-financial indicators. These results have been a credit to all involved and representative of the ‘Can Do’ attitude of everyone at SLSA, and the entire SLS movement. SLSA will continue to face significant challenges in 2010-11 and we will endeavour to maintain these positive growth indicators and work towards reaching our strategic objectives. The major focuses in 2010-11 will be: 1. Continued focus on key strategic ‘drivers’. 2. Development of a new Strategic Plan for the SLS movement. 3. Continued implementation of the findings from the Organisational Effectiveness Review and CIP. 4. Launching the new SLS brand. 5. Completion and release of the report ‘Economic Contribution of Surf Life Saving in Australia’. 6. Implementation of a number of wide-ranging research activities. 7. Extending public education campaigns. 8. Rolling out phase two of the ICT Project. 9. Further enhancements to SLSA’s Licensing and Retail Program, including the launch of the new range of SLS branded sunscreen. 10. Successfully relocate SLSA to our new offices and refurbish ‘Surf House’ at Bondi Beach. Conclusion The achievements recorded in this report have not happened overnight; rather they are a result of years of investment in planning, setting stretch targets, performance managing and living a ‘Can do’ attitude. I join with President Ron in sincerely thanking all who directly and indirectly have contributed to helping SLS save lives and make a difference, on and off the beaches. I particularly record my appreciation to my national and state management colleagues for their valued input and co-operation. Every member, officer, supporter, corporate partner, supplier and staff member reading this report should take a brief moment to reflect with pride and satisfaction on your personal contribution to helping the SLS movement make a difference during 2009-10. To SLSA President Ron, who is not seeking re-election at the next AGM, I thank you for the absolutely amazing dedication throughout your nine years as our national President. Ron has provided remarkably strong and dynamic leadership to Surf Life Saving. He truly epitomizes the ‘Can do’ spirit of our movement. It has been a privilege to share your passion, energy and friendship. Ron’s recognition as a 2010 Australian of the Year award winner is a fitting tribute to his contribution, not only to Surf Life Saving, but also to Australia. SLSA’s goals for the future are high, but so is our determination to succeed in our efforts to eliminate preventable coastal drowning deaths.

Lifesaving Overview Surf Life Saving Australia’s mission is to provide a safe beach and aquatic environment throughout Australia. In 2009/10, Our lifesaving programs have once again focused on the delivery of the SLSA Total Service Plan, with an overarching strategy to educate all Australians about rip currents and to reinforce the message, “Swim between the Red and Yellow flags”. Two targeted programs focussing on rock fishers and international tourists and migrants have also been extended, while local interventions continue to be funded under the SLSA Black Spot Program. These programs formed a key part of the agenda at the 2010 Australian Water Safety Conference held in May 2010. The Conference provided SLSA with an opportunity to present our latest initiatives in coastal risk assessment, drowning prevention and research to an audience of key water safety stakeholders. 2009/10 also saw the review of several Lifesaving manuals and awards. The 33rd Edition of the Public Safety and Aquatic Rescue Training Manual was launched at the start of the season; preparation also began for transition to the Advanced Resuscitation Techniques (ART) Award to meet the new ART Unit of Competency. Development of the 7th Edition of the Powercraft Manual and the Silver Medallion Advanced First Aid was also key priority during the season. The Australian Lifesaving Academy and the Australian Lifeguard Service (ALS) have again shown good growth and strong community education and prevention statistics. The ALS continues to strengthen partnerships with local governments and likeminded agencies throughout Australia, ensuring the efficient delivery of quality services to its stakeholders. The National Lifeguard Committee is committed to aligning resources and systems between state operations, which this year saw the launch of a centralised online job advertising and application system. External Influences • People still access, swim and drown on unpatrolled beaches while participating in aquatic and coastal activity. • Greater expansion of coastal communities, greater accessibility to coastal areas and ongoing risk taking behaviour. Peter George AM Peter Agnew Director of Lifesaving General Manager, Operations 26\n\n29. Lifesaving Snapshot Surf Life Saving’s centralised emergency response system Surf Life Saving’s centralised emergency contact number continues to expand and improve in quality, and has saved many lives since its inception. During 2009/10, the service saved at least 87 lives in New South Wales alone and will continue to save lives into the future across Australia. The service allows for more effective integration with emergency service organisations by providing one number for tasking agencies (such as the police) to provide access to lifesaving services. The system replaces the traditional method of agencies having to rely on localised, and sometimes outdated, Surf Life Saving contacts during time critical incidents. A key feature of the system is the enhanced callout capability of Surf Life Saving, with a number of dedicated Duty Officers and Surfcoms based around the country to respond 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The service is now fully operational in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Northern Territory. Rock Fishing Surf Life Saving, together with industry partners including the Australian National Sportfishing Association and the Australian Recreational and Sport Fishing Confederation, has developed a national rock fishing safety strategy to address ongoing rock fishing fatalities on the Australian coastline. This strategy addresses the cultural and language barriers encountered with high-risk demographics, the safety attitudes of these demographics at high‑risk locations and a comprehensive review of national rock fishing deaths and non-fatal injuries. A national campaign was launched in November 2009, which included a new public safety advertising program; multi-lingual educational resources; community workshops and additional public rescue equipment installed at popular rock fishing locations. With rock fishing related drowning deaths still on the rise, the need to expand this program is crucial. SurfLifeSavingAustraliaAnnualReport2009-10Lifesaving 27\n\n30.

Overview 2009/10 was another hectic year for Sport with a number of milestones and objectives achieved under the direction of the Board of Surf Sports (BOSS), with the assistance and support of our state surf sport counterparts and dedicated volunteer members. In a major boost to surf sports, the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) recognised surf lifesaving as a Tier One sport – one of only two non- Olympic sports recognised in this category. The elevation to Tier One status has contributed significantly to surf lifesaving being identified as a “priority” for additional High Performance funding that was made available as part of the Australian Government’s response to the Crawford Report, released in November 2009. In another significant achievement, the ASC officially recognised SLSA Officials and Coaches Courses as accredited courses and programs. In the surf sports arena, we experienced another strong season of competition, with increased entry numbers in the nib Coolangatta Gold, the Whereis® Australian Surf Life Saving Championships and the Australian Pool Rescue Championships. The Kellogg’s Nutri-Grain Ironman Series was another resounding success, with some spectacular racing ensuring this was one of the most exciting series on record. While we acknowledge the great sporting efforts of thousands of surf lifesavers, 2010 was also a time of mourning among the surf sports community. On March 19 Saxon Bird tragically lost his life while competing at the 2010 Australian Surf Life Saving Championships. Saxon, a former U19 NSW Ironman Champion, was an extremely talented athlete and surf lifesaver, who will be greatly missed. Our thoughts remain with his family, friends and Queenscliff club mates. Internationally, the Australian Surf Life Saving team continued their dominance in lifesaving competition by winning the 2009 World Games in Kaoshing, Chinese Taipei. External Influences • Television programming and competition with other iconic Australian summer sports. • Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on clubs’ ability to recruit and retain sponsors, and on members to spend disposable income on surf sports. • The release of the Crawford Report and the Australian Government’s response creating additional funding opportunities. Rick Wright OAM Dave Thompson Director of Surf Sports General Manager, Sport Sport 34\n\n37. Sport Snapshot National Surf and Kayak Talent Identification Program The relationship between ski paddling and kayak paddling has a long history in Australia. Most members of every Australian Olympic Kayak Team have either come from a surf lifesaving background, or have gone into surf lifesaving as a progression from kayak paddling. To capitalise on this relationship SLSA, Australian Canoeing, and the National Talent Identification and Development (NTISD) unit of the ASC entered into a groundbreaking agreement to identify SLS members with the potential to excel in Sprint Kayaking and fast track their development in this sport. The National Surf to Kayak Program (NSKP) aims to develop a surf-club-based approach where the bulk of the development work is conducted “in‑house”. Surf coaches and clubs are then recognised for the excellent development work they are doing through a reciprocal benefits program that includes access to sport science testing, elite kayak coaches and resources. Currently a pilot program is being run on the Gold Coast. Once the success of this program has been established, the intention is to work towards a national roll-out of the program. As a result of the pilot program, NSKP squad members won 18 medals at the Australian Canoeing Championships, with Joel Simpson gaining selection in Australian Canoeing’s National Senior Squad and Jordan Wood selected in the Olympic Hopes Team. Message from the Australian Sports Commission The Australian Sports Commission and national sporting organisations (NSOs) have long spoken of a shared ambition to strengthen relationships between all system partners involved in Australian sport. Aligned with this ambition, the Australian Government is now encouraging a whole-of-sport reform agenda, aimed at establishing a more collaborative, efficient and integrated sports system. Through a new direction for sport, ‘Australian Sport: The Pathway to Success’, the ASC will work closely with sport to achieve its main objectives; boost sports participation and strengthen sporting pathways while striving for international success. The reform agenda seeks for the ASC to assist to provide stability and support for all sporting organisations in their pursuit of a shared, common purpose; creating a better sporting pathway for all Australians, from the grassroots up. The ASC will implement the new direction, and this includes collaboration with all NSOs to allocate a record amount of new sports funding – committing an extra $195 million over the next four years. This funding is in addition to the current ongoing baseline funding for NSOs. The ASC will also assist sporting organisations with access to coaching and officiating programs, governance support, planning and education opportunities and assistance with becoming more inclusive – particularly in the areas of Indigenous sport, sport for people with a disability, sport for people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and women’s sport development programs. This is an exciting time for all of us involved in Australian sport. With significant new funding from the Australian Government, sports will be better positioned than ever before to lead the drive for higher participation levels and strong success on the sporting field.

Development Development Overview The 2009-10 season as seen the delivery of activities across all areas of Development including youth, leadership, environment, inclusion and recognition. Focus on the delivery of a revised Age Managers Course and the integration of this course in sport pathways – through coaching and officiating – for Age Managers has been a critical step in supporting and building capacity for our clubs to meet the growing demands for our nipper programs. The importance of engaging the 14-17 years age group was recognised with the conduct of a forum to review and identify the engagement and promotion of this important section of our membership. Increasingly successful Leaders’ Conferences, the Sir Adrian Curlewis Scholarship, our engagement with Emergency Management Australia’s Volunteer Leadership Program and the further development of the Leadership Capacity and Management Competencies Framework supports the future leadership of SLSA. The inclusive nature of SLSA was enhanced with the implementation of an Inclusive Organisation policy, the conduct of a Disability Forum and the delivery of activities engaging indigenous and culturally and linguistically diverse communities. The delivery of the Rainwater and Greywater Initiative and promotion of Ecosurf activities delivered a commitment to Ecosurf. Importantly the delivery of aligned recognition programs improved the acknowledgment of our volunteer members. External Influences • A growing demand for SLSA’s youth program for the 5-13 years age group, that currently exceeds the capacity of many of our clubs. • An ongoing public perception that Surf Life Saving is for Anglo- Australians who can swim. John Fitzgerald OAM Vanessa Brown Director of Development Development Manager Development Snapshot 2009-10 has seen a focus on supporting and increasing the capacity of our clubs to engage junior members, who now represent almost 50% of SLSA’s membership. This has been achieved through the development of resources to educate Age Managers and provide them with participation pathways throughout SLSA. Further importance of SLSA’s youth in the 14-17 years age group was recognised through the conduct of a 14-17 years Program Coordinators Forum, highlighting the value of engaging youth and developing best practice techniques. Outcomes of this forum are being developed to provide a resource to support clubs in this area. SLSA has highlighted this area as a priority in 2010/11 and will be developing further resources to support those implemented in 2009/10. 40\n\n43.

Viability Reputation Supporting for life 44\n\n47. 45\n\n48. Overview Surf Life Saving’s (SLS) long-standing partnership with our major partners DHL, Westpac and Telstra was renewed and extended during the year; highlighting the passionate commitment that is so intrinsic within these great companies. Further details of our major partners’ significant involvement in SLS can be found over the page. Towards the end of the 2009-10 three new sponsors came on board: Nikon, Woodside and Frantelle. We welcome them to the SLS family and look forward to establishing successful partnerships over the next three years. Our team has also developed new commercial ventures to increase revenue, including improved licensing programs, bringing the club product sales program back in-house, building a new online shop and developing a new sunscreen product for the retail market. Viability and Reputation Snapshot 2009-10 involved a significant investment to review our role in the community and to identify ways to involve more people in supporting and engaging with SLS. Surveys, interviews and brand research that spanned almost 11,000 SLS members and thousands of the general public helped to establish a new organisational strategy to increase our effectiveness and achieve our true potential. This will be unveiled in 2010-11, but we have highlighted some of the feedback below. Member feedback While 100 per cent of participants sighted the saving of lives as the most important thing we do, we noted that for the vast majority of club members it was not the reason why they joined the organisation. The vast majority joined because they wanted to have positive experiences – mateship, fun, fitness, making a difference and having a can do attitude. This can do attitude was so prominent that we needed to live this approach and work hard to ensure that we respond to any issue that challenged this positivity. Some of the internal challenges we need to address include: 1. Less red tape and paperwork; to simplify administrative tasks for clubs. 2. Sun protection; we need to provide better protection to our nippers and patrolling members. 3. Improved nipper program; direct more focus and attention to SLS nipper programs. 4. Continue to improve patrol uniforms 5. Important member information available online; better use internet and technology to provide members with the ability to access information online. 6. Improve awards and certificates; need for constant review, discussion, consultation and education about our awards and certificates. 7. Increase funding for surf life saving clubs. 8. More involvement with schools; stronger relationships need to be built with local schools. 9. Benefits for surf lifesavers and volunteers. 10. Improved community safety messaging to the wider community. These become our challenges for the next few years to better support our frontline. Public surveys Among the numerous independent surveys and focus groups conducted, it was revealed that on a list of some of Australia’s best known and loved brands, both corporate and charitable, SLS was recognised as “Australia’s most trusted brand” and “The most Australian of brands”. We also ranked highest with ambulance officers and fire fighters as the most trusted of people. Other interviews and surveys have also led to our new brand positioning and set the direction for the organisation for the future. It is an exciting time to be part of SLS and we are excited about the next 12 months which will set the platform for an enhanced, engaging and more inclusive SLS.

Westpac Surf Life Saving Australia is proud of its partnership with Westpac, a relationship which has spanned almost 40 years, making it the longest corporate community partnership in Australia. Westpac supports the Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service in every state and provides local grass roots support to surf clubs all around the country. Partnering with Westpac has allowed the helicopter service to grow from a just one helicopter to a national network of 11, flying for over 4,000 hours a year. In October 2009, Westpac launched a new equipment grants program, enabling local Westpac branches to apply for grants up to $5,000 to buy vital safety equipment for local surf clubs. 95 branches applied with 74 grants awarded, totalling $153,000. In April 2010, Westpac announced an increase of almost $2million per year to Surf Life Saving to help extend its presence in high risk areas around Australia. Initially the funding will be providing helicopter services on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast and the NSW South Coast. The funds also includes the launch of an offshore rescue boat in Darwin. Other major expansion initiatives in Victoria are to be announced. DHL DHL, the world’s leading freight and logistics company, is one of SLSA’s major corporate partners. Every surf lifesaver in Australia wears a patrol uniform thanks to DHL, and many clubs have also received beach furniture including patrol shelters and shade umbrellas. Other highlights for 2009/10 included: - Prominent branding on the new SLS patrol uniforms that were distributed to over 43,800 patrolling members across the country. - Successful roll-out of the ‘Welcome to Summer’ campaign. - Increase engagement of the partnership through internal and external channels. Telstra Telstra is a proud supporter of Surf Life Saving in Australia through programs such as Telstra Beach to Bush, the Telstra Assistance Fund and Telstra Affinity Program. Telstra also provides significant telecommunications support for the Australian Surf Life Saving Championships and other surf sports events. In 2009/10 Telstra secured the naming rights to the Telstra Beach to Bush program, which will provide surf safety advice and education to over 40,000 children across the country. The Telstra Affinity Program and the Telstra Assistance Fund were extremely successful in 2009/10, giving back over $480,000 to our local surf life saving clubs. Other highlights in 2009/10 included: Support through the Community Service allocation. - Event partner for the Kellogg’s Nutri-Grain Ironman Series. - The inclusion of the Telstra “T” on the left chest of the patrol uniform. Partnerships Surf Life Saving Australia relies heavily on corporate support to ensure vital surf lifesaving services and programs continue throughout Australia. Our three major partners, Westpac, Telstra and DHL have a long and proud history with Surf Life Saving, and we are grateful for their ongoing support. 48\n\n51.

Overview Research 2009/10 has seen the adoption of a National Research Agenda, the appointment of a National Research Manager, Dr Shauna Sherker in February 2010, and the formation of a Research Advisory Committee, which had its first meeting in April 2010. A SLSA Research Scheme was introduced during the year to adopt rigour into research project design and provide funding for targeted and priority research projects. Towards the end of the financial year, two research projects were reaching finalisation with the University of New South Wales focusing on rip current safety issues. A third research project, “Attributing the Social Contribution of Surf Life Saving Australia: Valuing the Social Capital of an Iconic Institution”, was developed in collaboration with the University of Technology, Sydney, with commencement expected early in 2011. International Development In 2009/10, SLS has provided increased surf lifesaving assistance to allied lifesaving organisations and areas of need in more than 25 countries – 20 of which are in the Asia-Pacific Region. SLS has been active in offering developmental assistance to a number of countries including Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Samoa and India. Of particular note is the signing of Strategic Partnering Agreements with the United States Lifesaving Association (USLA), Singapore Life Saving Society and the Rashtriya Life Saving Society India [RLSS (I)]. The support of the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) and AusAID, through the Australian Sports Outreach Program (ASOP), has enabled programs to be introduced in Bali, Indonesia and India. In June 2010, a four-and-a-half year ASOP India project was entered into with the ASC, SLSA and RLSS (I). The international development activity has been enhanced through the most generous contributions from the Kevin Weldon AM International Aid Fund. External Influences • Competitiveness in the academic research sector has led to a cautious approach from SLSA when selecting research partners. • Competition for Australian Government backed research grants has led to a level of uncertainty about implementing research programs. • Changing national research priorities can favour one research area over another, resulting in SLSA realigning its research themes when applying for Australian Government funding. • Collaboration and cooperation with other ILS members in international development activities Norm Farmer General Manager – Strategic Development Strategic Development 52"
