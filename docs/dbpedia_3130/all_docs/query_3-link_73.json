        "text": "About Galveston Island Beach Patrol (GIBP)\n\nThe Galveston Island Beach Patrol (GIBP) is certified as an “advanced” level agency of the United States Lifesaving Association and is the designated lifeguard service for the City of Galveston. GIBP is a Texas Emergency Medical Services First Responder Organization certified by the Texas Department of State Health Services.\n\nGIBP employs over 100 people comprised of lifeguards, senior guards, supervisors, peace officers, and dispatchers. The mission of GIBP is to protect the 7-8 million people who visit the Galveston beaches each year, respond to aquatic emergencies 24/7/365, educate the public about beach safety, provide water safety talks at schools, and be a good community partner.\n\nEach of our twelve rescue trucks is staffed by at least one person who, at a minimum, is an open water lifeguard and an emergency medical technician. The vehicles are equipped to respond to water emergencies, provide basic life support, and aid stranded motorists. The Beach Patrol fleet also includes a variety of water rescue craft, ATVs, and a multi-purpose vehicle. 24 lifeguard towers are staffed by lifeguards who meet and exceed the qualifications established by the United States Lifesaving Association.\n\nThe Beach Patrol’s jurisdiction includes the Gulf facing beaches from East Beach to the San Luis Pass and up to 2 miles offshore with emergency response capability to the waters adjacent to the entire island. Our primary responsibility is the safety of swimmers from East Beach Park to 61st Street during the beach season.\n\nGalveston’s beaches are challenging to guard. Heavy crowds, rip current generating jetties, and constantly changing conditions keep guards very busy. Fortunately, the Galveston Park Board and the greater Galveston community have leveraged a combination of hotel tax dollars and beach user fees to fund one of the most proactive and respected lifeguarding agencies in the country.\n\nAll of us here at GIBP thank you for your support!\n\nTony Pryor, Captain\n\nTony Pryor is the Captain and Operations Supervisor of Galveston Island Beach Patrol.

Growing up, Dain moved around the whole country and even out of it but finally settled down in Galveston to call it home. Mountain biking, skiing, snowboarding, and paddling are all hobbies he is active in. Dain hopes one day to circumnavigate the entire island on a surfski.\n\nDain currently has lived on the island for 7 years and can be seen spending most of his time at the beach and in the ocean on or off the clock. He continues to strive and push his further education and training with the Galveston Island Beach Patrol. He loves the fact that his office is outside and in the community and the cooperation that Beach Patrol as an agency shares with Galveston Fire, Police, EMS, and all other response agencies on the island that make it a safe and great place to live.\n\nMicah Fowler, Supervisor\n\nMicah Fowler is a full-time supervisor for Galveston Island Beach Patrol.
