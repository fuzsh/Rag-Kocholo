        "text": "One hundred and fifty-seven and counting.\n\nThat’s the number of drowning reports collected so far on the recently launched Global Drowning Tracker – a web program created by two Huntington Beach lifeguards to illuminate what they call a worldwide drowning epidemic.\n\nAccording to Will Koon, 22, and Henry Reyes, 32, these numbers are grossly underreported, but they hope to keep adding stories to paint a more vivid picture of the issue.\n\n“Every dot that is added (to the tracker) shows a little more of reality,” Koon said. “It’s impossible to report every drowning, but our goal is to get it as close as possible.”\n\nThe two lifeguards will appeal to Congress on Wednesday, which happens to be International Water Safety Day, to share their web program and look to advance their project. They will get 10 minutes in front of a public safety committee.\n\nOther water safety groups joining the lifeguards include the National Drowning Prevention Alliance, The Center for Safe and Healthy Schools and the USA Swimming Foundation, among others.\n\n“We really want to make an impression on the congressmen and women about how serious this issue is,” Reyes said. “Hopefully they’ll be able to point us in the right direction.”\n\nReyes said they hope Congress will be able to suggest companies or organizations they can contact to secure corporate sponsors so they can expand and improve their tracker, which is seeing an increasing number of drowning reports daily.\n\nBy clicking on any of the pink dots on the tracker’s world map, a statistic becomes a story.\n\nThe tracker tells how a 31-year-old man drowned trying to rescue his bride, who was swept off their sailboat by gale force winds off the coast of Egypt. They were on their honeymoon.\n\nOne of the pink dots represents a 16-year-old boy who drowned off the coast of Northern California attempting to rescue his dog. The boy’s father also died trying to go after his son. They were both swept out to sea.\n\nSome of the stories have names, most have ages and some also include a photo. Most of the stories are corroborated by local news reports.\n\n“It means more when you can see it rather than just reading about the incident in a newspaper article,” Koon said.\n\nEventually the lifeguards say they want to launch a second version of this project that could be used as a database for scientific and academic research.\n\nThe Global Drowning Tracker is just part of the work Koon and Reyes submerge themselves in to advocate for worldwide water safety.\n\nThe two work for the nonprofit International Surf Lifesaving Association, which started in 2008 after co-founding member, Scott Hunthausen, saw first-hand the need for lifesaving training in Nicaragua. He visited in the country and while there, a friend of the family he was staying with drowned, Koon said.\n\nReyes, a Huntington Beach city lifeguard, is one of the four founders and president of the organization. Koon, a Huntington Beach state lifeguard, serves as the nonprofit’s international relations manager.\n\nMore than 100 volunteers travel to at-risk locations to share waters safety skills, provide equipment and mentor volunteer lifeguards to reduce the number of drowning deaths in countries including Nicaragua, Mexico, Chile, Costa Rica and Peru.\n\nIn many cases, ISLA has partnerships with various government agencies and organizations in individual countries, such as the Red Cross, to organize and implement lifeguard trainings.\n\nThe organization is a volunteer-run nonprofit and the lifeguards pay their own way and often rely on the hospitality of the countries they visit for housing and food. The group takes up to eight trips abroad a year.\n\nTheir flagship effort in Nicaragua launched in 2009 after ISLA founders learned that in the year prior, 64 people died in four days to celebrate Semana Santa (Holy Week), a much-celebrated time in Latin America that includes massive beach parties which turn out dozens of drowning deaths every year.\n\nISLA has visited various beaches along the Nicaraguan coast several times to train and provide equipment for volunteer lifeguards and the number of drowning deaths has steadily declined. Last year, 16 people drowned in the area, according to the Nicaraguan Red Cross.\n\n“I don’t want to say we have a direct effect on the drowning rates, but they have significantly dropped since 2008,” Reyes said.\n\nAfter their presentation to Congress on Wednesday, Koon and Reyes are heading to Greece and Turkey where they will share their Global Drowning Tracker and train authorities on how to properly report statistics.\n\nThey also will hold a hands-on lifeguard training in Macedonia and provide volunteer lifeguards with much needed equipment including back boards, fins and buoys.\n\nKoon said as more people learn to use the tracker, they expect a greater awareness worldwide on water safety issues that may spark more aggressive prevention and education efforts.\n\n“The ultimate goal is to shed light on what drowning looks like in the world,” Koon said. “It’s a real public safety issue.”"
