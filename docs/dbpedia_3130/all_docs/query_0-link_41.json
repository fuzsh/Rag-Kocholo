        "text": "Category: Surfing\n\nSurfing Portfolio\n\nAt 15 years old, arriving in Hawaii for the first time, I was captivated by the Pacific – and the ocean became my life-long teacher. The surfing lifestyle led me to health, nature, and freedom.\n\nThese posts share my story – a lifestyle born at the beach that led me to become an ocean lifeguard, a traveling surfer, and an environmental researcher interested in the conservation of beaches and surf sites.\n\nSteven A. Martin\n\nSurfing Experience & Lifestyle\n\nSurfing Experience and Lifestyle\n\nSurfing is not just a sport, but also a way of life, with a wordless philosophy communicated effortlessly through photographs that inspire many people who have never even touched a surfboard.\n\nSurfers live with the ocean, rising and falling with its waves. Their naturally photogenic lives are enriched not only by the healthy exercise of life at the beach, but also by the intercultural experiences that come with traveling around the world to find the best breaks.\n\nIn my early twenties, while working as an assistant chef, I began to look for ways to bring the surfing lifestyle into my work. Surfing was my favorite activity; that was what I did before and after work, and on my days off.\n\nSo I asked myself: Could I find work at the beach, or in the surf, and get paid for being in my chosen element?\n\nSadly, I was not good enough at surfing to be a professional surfer, but I had developed a personal philosophy of doing what I love, and loving what I do – and surfing was clearly what I loved to do.\n\nI asked around at the five-star hotel where I’d been working, and sure enough, I was able to transfer to a new position at the same hotel, working with the beach and pool department as a lifeguard. From that day forward, my life changed.\n\nI was getting paid to train as a lifeguard and swim on the beach every day, and encouraged to have fun surfing on my breaks.\n\nDo what you love, and love what you do. Great advice!\n\nSteven 'Surf Doctor' Martin experiencing the surfing lifestyle at the Kahalu'u beach house in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii\n\nLifeguarding and Water Safety\n\nAfter working on the beach and making ocean rescues for about three years, I applied for a full-time job as a Hawaii County Lifeguard. In 1992, I was offered an opportunity to attend lifeguard training at Huntington Beach, California, and soon become a certified California State Lifeguard, stationed at San Clemente, Orange Coast District.\n\nOnce I started college in 1994 and learned that I could study abroad in wave-rich countries like South Africa, Spain, and Taiwan, the idea of combining work, study and other life pursuits with surfing opened up a world of possibilities.\n\nIn 1998, after good day of surfing in Tel-Aviv, Israel, I made the decision to return home to Hawaii and start a surfing school. Based on my experience in lifeguarding, I named the school \"Hawaii Lifeguard Surf Instructors\" (HLSI), and set up shop at a beach house near Kahaluu Beach Park in Kailua-Kona (see photos below).\n\nWater Safety and Lifeguarding in Hawaii\n\nKahalu'u Beach Park in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii\n\nHawaii Lifeguard Surf Instructors | Surf Lessons Hawaii\n\nOver the next 5 years, I earned a living teaching others how to surf, and met a variety of interesting people, including international celebrities, movie stars and astronauts from NASA.\n\nThe surf school was an instant success. Everyone wanted a piece of the action. Before long every major hotel in the area was calling me to book lessons for their guests, and I had contacts up and down the coast. My friends and I had people of all shapes and sizes, backgrounds and abilities.\n\nHawaii Lifeguard Surf Instructors (HLSI) beach house at Kahaluu Beach Park in Kailua-Kona, Big Island of Hawaii\n\nMost kids wanted to surf when they came to Hawaii, and most parents didn’t really know much about surfing and were terribly worried at the idea of it. So HLSI was there to provide a short, safe, surfing experience, and everyone got what they wanted.\n\n\"Big Monday\" at the beach house | Kahaluu Beach Park, Kailua-Kona, Big Island\n\nBefore long the school started to attract celebrities. Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston were at the house, Steven Seagal's kids with his ex-wife, actress Kelly LeBrock, Jeff Bridges with his three daughters. We treated the stars like family, barbecuing on the beach or taking them to local restaurants to eat after the day’s surfing. They loved it, and so did we.\n\n'High Surf Advisory' at the Kahaluu beach house\n\nThe Space Ambassadors | Surfing with NASA Astronauts\n\nSurf Lessons Hawaii | Commander Scott Horowitz (lower right) and Mission Specialist Pat Forrester (lower center) and the STS-105 Crew\n\nOne morning after a volunteer project at Kahaluu Beach Park in Kona, Hawaii, I met Scott Horowitz, four-time commander of the Space Shuttle.\n\nScott had just a few minutes to learn to surf, and so I geared him up, and we hit the water. Scott was a surf instructor's dream, naturally enough. As an astronaut, he had been selected for both physical strength and learning ability – so he was very close to the perfect student.\n\nWith Astronaut Scott Horowitz | Kailua-Kona, Hawaii\n\nAfter his first wave, Scott exclaimed, \"Surfing is out of this world!\"\n\nOne thing led to another and over the next year I found myself imagining the entire shuttle crew to coming to the Big Island of Hawaii to surf and appear at local schools.\n\nThe next year Scott and fellow astronaut Pat Forrester came to Hawaii, officially representing the NASA Space Program, and appearing at schools across the island and catching a few waves.\n\nI wrote a short article named, \"The Space Ambassadors\" to share the experience in the Kona Views Magazine.\n\nNASA Astronaut Hawaii Appearances 2001 Press Release | West Hawaii\n\nNASA Astronaut Appearance Video | Shown to Big Island students during the Hawaii tour\n\nAstronaut Scott Horowitz | Big Island of Hawaii students\n\nScott Horowitz | Big Island students in Kailua-Kona\n\nMission Specialist Pat Forrester | Hawaii Preparatory Academy (HPA)\n\nAstronaut Scott Horowitz | Learning to surf in Kailua-Kona\n\nSurf Resource Sustainability and Conservation\n\nWhen it was time to start Graduate school and do my PhD, once again I found that surfing was my ticket to combining work, education and lifestyle. I wrote my MBA thesis on surf tourism in Thailand.\n\nThe more I traveled, surfed, and learned about the environmental issues at surf sites and other coastal areas, the more I was moved to study the social, economic and environmental significance of surfing.\n\nAfter my MBA, I chose to do a Ph.D. in Environmental Management, dedicating three years of my life to researching surf site sustainability and developing the Surf Resource Sustainability Index (SRSI).\n\nCurrently, I am still surfing and sharing the surfing stoke with my students in Environmental Studies at Prince of Songkla University, Phuket, Thailand.\n\nSteven's 'surfer-researcher lifestyle' was featured in Japan's Nalu Magazine | 2008 article by Riku Emoto | Click to view...\n\nInternational Research Publications\n\nVisit my Surf Tourism Research page for a complete list of publications on surf site sustainability and conservation, including international peer-reviewed journal papers, book chapters, and popular magazine articles.

After learning about the International MBA program in Hospitality and Tourism Management being offered at the Prince of Songkla University, Phuket Campus, I decided to apply. The courses started in April 2007, just in time for the surf season on the Andaman Coast.\n\nI packed my bags – and surfboards.\n\nOne of 800 hotels on the resort island of Phuket\n\nI soon realized that surf tourism was a new and growing industry in Phuket, and my thesis adviser agreed it was an excellent research topic. Besides, what surfer wouldn't feel great strapping their surfboards on the car and heading to the beach to conduct field research?\n\nI had been a surf tourist in 30 countries and owned a surf school in Hawaii which catered to tourists from all over the world, including celebrities and astronauts from NASA.\n\nSurf travel was in my blood.\n\nEnvironmental concerns and the protection of surf sites had always been important to me, and my master's thesis progressed into a coastal resource assessment of Phuket surf beaches. I looked at many coastal resource issues, including water pollution, marine debris, the tin mining industry, water safety, and much more.\n\nEventually, my work on the Andaman Coast led to a doctoral scholarship, and in the years following, I developed the Surf Resource Sustainability Index (SRSI), earning me a Ph.D. in Environmental Management.\n\nIf you feel motivated to learn more about these topics, please visit my Surf Tourism Research page.\n\nSurfing waves on Thailand's Andaman Coast\n\nThe Southwest Monsoon\n\nThe Southwest Monsoon is the driving force behind the surf on Thailand's Andaman Coast. The month of May signals the onset of steady westerly/ southwesterly winds, occasionally gusty and accompanied by fast-moving squalls and heavy rain. However, gloomy skies and heavy downpours tend to pass quickly, replaced by pillowy convection-born cumulonimbus clouds, shimmering sunbeams, and consistent head-high surf.\n\nThe Southwest Monsoon tapers off during October, giving way to cooler northeasterly winds during November. During this period, lucky locals may experience a few days with off-shore wind pushing up the faces of clean, Indian Ocean groundswells (see sections below on wave types and swell windows).\n\nThe Andaman weather wheel, shown here, illustrates from the inner cycle outward: monsoon season, approximate average rainfall in millimeters, wind types and directions, and expected storm activity and skies.\n\nAndaman Coast weather cycle | Steven Martin ©\n\nTypical day at the beach in Phuket during the Southwest Monsoon. Onshore winds and waves with passing heavy showers | Thai Geography\n\nTypical day at the beach in Phuket during the Northeast Monsoon, with light winds and calm seas | Thai Geography\n\nAndaman Surf Meteorology\n\nSurf on the Andaman coast comes from a wide-range of sources and directions, and various wave types are generated by particular sets of weather phenomena. This is to say that depending on how, when, and where waves are generated, those arriving at Thailand’s Andaman coast beaches differ significantly.\n\nWindsea, windswell and groundswell\n\nIn this article, three types of waves are discussed in terms of swell period, referring mainly to wave interval, that is, the amount of time it takes for two consecutive wave crests to pass through a determined point. The definitions offered here are slightly adjusted to better understand what we actually see on Thailand's Andaman Coast. Exact definitions can be found across various surf forecasting websites.\n\nWindsea refers to waves breaking very close together, perhaps just 6 to 8 seconds apart.\n\nWindswell refers to mainly to short period swells averaging around 9-12 seconds apart.\n\nGroundswell mainly refers to longer period swells, averaging 14 seconds or more.\n\nIn the widest sense, waves are generated at different distances from the coast. Waves resulting from weather patterns occurring near the Andaman Coast generally create a windsea condition. Windsea refers to waves accompanied by the wind which generated them and may look like waves breaking one right after another, resulting in mixed wave heights, a common sight at Phuket Beaches on stormy days.\n\nOnce the windsea condition passes, and the wind dies down, a rideable windswell may remain for several hours or several days.\n\nTypical windswell in Phuket during the Southwest Monsoon (May to October)\n\nIn contrast, groundswells generated by weather systems in the Indian Ocean may travel great distances, pass through the The Great Channel, between Banda Ache and Great Nicobar Island, and provide clean, long-period surfing waves.\n\nIf comparing the consistent, almost daily windswell arriving at Thai beaches during the Southwest monsoon, groundswells are characterized as more powerful, offering longer rides, and having more time between waves. While different wave types may be common knowledge among surfers, types of windswells and groundswells vary considerably in Thailand based on a number of factors.\n\nFor example, swells with a 15-second or more wave period, generated as far away as Madagascar in the Southern Indian Ocean, as compared to swells with a 10-second wave period generated south of Sri Lanka in the southern Bay of Bengal. Low pressure systems in the Bay of Bengal have potential to push large waves through The Great Channel or Ten Degree Channel (see maps below) with considerable force, creating big surf in Phuket, similar to what one might expect in Indonesia or Hawaii.\n\nWorthy of note, The Great Channel is much wider, deeper, and open to Indian ocean wave activity compared to The Ten Degree Channel.\n\nTypical groundswell in Phuket\n\nThe three most obvious sources of ocean swell activity and associated swell directions relative to the Andaman coast of Thailand are as follows:\n\nMonsoonal wind flow which propagates southwesterly to westerly windsea and windswell.\n\nGroundswell generated in the southern or central Indian Ocean which produces southwesterly swells.\n\nRegional cyclonic activity, including tropical depressions, storms, and cyclones, which may propagate a variety of swell types and directions.\n\nAndaman Surf Meteorology | Swell types | Steven Martin ©\n\nEach type of weather phenomena and its associated swell type and direction create various surfing conditions on the Andaman Coast which may range in size and ‘surfability’ from one coastal area to another. Swell direction is highly significant given that the swell window for each province varies considerably.\n\nFor example, provinces north of Phuket are open to southerly and southwesterly swell directions, compared to provinces south of Phuket, which are mainly exposed to westerly swell directions or rarely occurring northerly swells resulting from regional cyclonic activity (see Andaman Coast Swell Windows, below).\n\nClassification of Storms in Thai Waters\n\nThe classification of weather and large storms varies from country to country around the world. For example, a tropical storm in one country may be considered a tropical depression in another country. Consequently, communication and clarification regarding the exchange of data among various national weather bureaus is of the utmost importance, especially when issuing storm warnings and in terms of public safety awareness.\n\nIn Thai waters, the following criteria apply:\n\nTropical depression is categorized as a weather system which produces winds up to 59 km/hr\n\nTropical storm produces winds of 60-119 km/hr\n\nCyclone produces winds of over 119 km/hr\n\nSurfers at Nai Harn Beach, Phuket\n\nAndaman Coast Swell Windows\n\nPrimarily a factor of geography, Sumatra and the Nicobar Islands block or shadow the vast majority Indian Ocean swells from reaching Thailand’s Andaman Coast. Consequently, the surf along Thailand’s Andaman Coast is generally much smaller on a given day compared to the South-Western coasts of Sumatra, the Mentawai Islands, Java, Bali, etc., which are highly exposed to the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe news isn't all bad, a gap between Banda Aceh and Great Nicobar Island offer a ‘swell window’, an opening through which waves can pass through, such as between islands or around points of land.\n\nIn order for Indian Ocean swells to reach Phuket, they must pass through The Great Channel, a swell window limited from roughly 230 degrees west-southwest through 245 degrees west-southwest depending on a given swell direction. Although a narrow window, the Banda Aceh/Nicobar gap allows enough Indian Ocean surf though to provide year-round surprises for local surfers.\n\nA sunny day in Phuket, November 2007\n\nAs in navigation, wind and wave directions for meteorology and swell directions follow the numbers of the compass (a 360° circle) where 0/360° is North, 90° is East, 180° is South, and 270° is West. Waves traveling from a particular source or direction are labeled as coming from that direction in terms of the compass relative to the point of arrival. This is to say that if Phuket is the arrival point, we can set the center of the compass over Phuket and measure the direction of the incoming swell (see map below).\n\nAndaman Coast groundswell windows and wave refraction | Steven Martin ©\n\nThailand’s Andaman Coast occasionally receives big surf generated in the northern Indian Ocean and southern Bay of Bengal. Lucky days for surfers are those when the swell direction finds an open window enters the Andaman Sea at full-face value. Such was the case for the July 2008 Kalim Surfing Contest, which saw clean overhead waves on the day of the finals. The unusually big surf came from low pressure system not far from Sri Lanka.\n\n2008 Phuket Surfing Contest\n\nOcean swells passing through The Great Channel or The Ten Degree Channel 'refract' or bend, thus changing direction upon entering the Andaman Sea and may reach coastal areas north and south of Phuket (see groundswell windows and wave refraction map).\n\nThe science of wave refraction also helps to explain why the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, generated on the opposite side of Sumatra from Phuket, was able to bend around Banda Aceh, the western tip of Sumatra, and strike the Malaysian Peninsula. As tsunamis travel at great ocean depths, speeds, and volumes, the rate of refraction is additively great.\n\nAndaman Coast Swell Windows | Steven Martin ©\n\nAndaman Coastal Bathymetry\n\nBathymetry, or seafloor topography, varies at different latitudes along Thailand’s Andaman Coast and this greatly affects wave speeds and heights. Waves approaching a particular coast from deep water travel faster and carry more energy and power than waves approaching over shallow water, such as when they pass over a continental shelf before reaching the shore.\n\nNotably, the deepest water on Thailand’s Andaman Coast is found near Phuket; hence, Phuket generally has the most powerful waves regardless of the fact that provinces to the north may have a better swell window to the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nSurf beaches and bathymetry | Phuket, Thailand | Steven Martin ©\n\nAll six of Thailand's Andaman provinces have a continental shelf. The shelf averages approximately 100 km wide in the north (Ranong Province), narrowing to 25 km in the middle (Phuket Province) and widening to about 130 km in the south (Satun Province).\n\nAndaman coastal seafloor topography | Phang nga, Phuket, and Krabi Provinces | Steven Martin ©\n\nTides\n\nTides along Thailand’s Andaman Coast are semi-diurnal, meaning there are two high tides and two low tides daily, with spring heights of up to approximately 3.6 meters and neap tides down to approximately .6 meter.\n\nGenerally, the maximum tidal amplitude, or the magnitude of change in an oscillating tidal variable, in Phuket is approximately 3 meters; however in some areas of the Andaman Sea, amplitudes can reach as much as 7 meters.\n\nLow tide at Cape Coral | Andaman Coast, Thailand\n\nThe few reef breaks along the Andaman Coast are highly ‘tide dependent’ in terms of surfing. For example, these areas may become exposed reefs on low tide and have rideable waves on medium to high tides.\n\nConversely, waves at many beach breaks become too thick and slow on high tides, and are often better surfed on incoming or medium tides.\n\nExceptions to the rules occur when the waves are big – when indeed, anything goes!\n\nMysterious Andaman Sea\n\nSeafloor topography\n\nThe average depth the Andaman Sea is approximately 1,000 meters (3,200 ft), while the western and central areas are particularly deep at 900 to 3,000 meters (3,000–10,000 ft). The northern parts are much shallower due to the silt deposited by the Irrawaddy River, as are the coastal areas of Myanmar and Thailand due the continental shelf.\n\nSalinity\n\nAt an average salinity of 32 parts per thousand, the Andaman Sea is especially salty. Due to the fresh water entering the sea from the Irrawaddy River in the extreme north of the sea, slightly higher salinity occurs in southern areas near Thailand. The influx of cool, fresh water is a contributing factor to the development of low pressure systems and cyclones in the region (see cyclogenesis below).\n\nGeology\n\nAlong with the Nicobar island chain, The Andaman Islands form a natural back-arc basin which defines the Andaman Sea. The western area of the sea is dynamic with seismic activity along a zig-zag north-south line where the seabed demarks the boundary between the Burma plate and the Sunda Plate.\n\nAs a result of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, the sea floor was uplifted by several meters in some areas. This area is home to the only active volcano connected with the Indian subcontinent.\n\nDeep sea currents\n\nDeep sea currents in the Andaman change considerably with the monsoon seasons from south-easterly and easterly during winter months (December to March), and south-westerly and westerly during summer months (June to September). The changes in currents affect sea temperatures and salinity in various parts of the sea.\n\nInternal waves\n\nPeculiar to the Andaman Sea is the occurrence of ‘internal waves’, which are essentially underwater waves which can travel across the sea and sometimes surface to form the mysterious ripples recorded by early seafarers in the region. Caused by the mixing of different water temperatures and densities in relation with deep-sea currents, internal waves are comparable to oil and vinegar in a jar: when lightly shaken, a sub-surface wave forms where the different fluid densities meet.\n\nCyclogenesis\n\nCyclogenesis is the birth of large spinning storms, a low-pressure weather phenomenon particularly dynamic to the Andaman Sea. (Kumar et al, 2008) Although cyclones are normally associated with a weather phenomena related to the equator, the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea are potentially energetic for the development of strong cyclonic storms and account for about seven percent of the total number of cyclones in the world annually (Mohanty et al., 1994).\n\nIn teaching Thai Geography for nearly a decade, I find that this topic, that is, giant storms often generated just northwest of Thailand's Andaman Coast, is rarely ever mentioned, save for my classroom discussions. With some of the largest and most destructive storms in the world are generated near Phuket, why aren't Phuketians aware?\n\nIn my experience, the reason is that these weather systems are not on most citizen's radar is that as they form, they actually draw the clouds and moisture away from Phuket, pulling them anti-clockwise into the center of the storm. Thus, as Andaman cyclones form, Phuket tends to have spectacularly clear weather. While this is certainly not always the case, according to historical records dating back to 1000 AD, not a single Andaman-born cyclone has moved towards Phuket. Rather these storms characteristically track in a west-northwesterly direction toward the Andaman Islands, making landfall in India, Bangladesh or Myanmar.\n\nExemptions to the rule include Pacific-born hurricanes that cross the Malaysian Peninsula and enter the Andaman Sea, such as Harriet in 1962, the deadliest tropical cyclone in Thai history, responsible for nearly 1,000 deaths.\n\nWorthy of mention, cyclones born in the Andaman Sea have long lifespans and are among the most devastating in history (Pentakota et al., 2018). For example, Cyclone Nagris which hit Myanmar on May 2, 2008.\n\nThai surfers – watch for rare, yet epic, cyclone-generated north-westerly swells hitting southerly provinces either early or late in the surf season!\n\nThank you for visiting my Surfing Thailand page.\n\nI hope you enjoy my photos and the information in the links provided.

The surfing lifestyle led me to health, nature, and freedom.\n\nSurfing was what I loved to do, and over time I found myself increasingly \"Doing what I love, and loving what I do.\"\n\nAt Waikiki with Lifeguards Hawaii State\n\nMy surfing lifestyle led me to train and become qualified as an ocean lifeguard/Water Safety Officer. Later I traveled the world as a surfer, and eventually settled down at a university on a tropical island (Phuket, Thailand), earned a PhD in surf site conservation, and became a professional environmental researcher.\n\nThrough my experiences as a water safety professional, I learned important first-responder skills, such as First Aid and CPR. Later, I became an American Red Cross instructor.\n\nPractical Experience and Professional Service\n\nThe sport of surfing has inherent risks, and practical experience and an understanding of ocean safety go hand and hand. It is common for surfers seek advanced water safety or lifeguard training, especially if they are thinking of working at the beach. My case was no exception, and now I reflect on forty years of ocean experience in twenty-five countries, including five years' service as a Hawaii County Water Safety Officer, and seasonal service as a California State Park Lifeguard. Although lifeguarding was not my only career, it has been a continuous theme in personal and professional life.\n\nIn 1987, I was introduced to instructor programs with American Red Cross through a Hawaiian friend at the beach, and this was when I first became a teacher. I continued teaching these courses until 1997. Mainly I taught courses in Advanced Lifesaving, Lifeguarding, First-aid, and CPR.\n\nPhuket Rip Currents Poster | Steven Martin\n\nSurf experience highlights in my life include participating in amateur surf contests and as an official surf contest judge in Hawaii, North America, South America, Africa, Europe and Asia. These and other experiences culminated in the idea to create an international surfing school in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, in 1998.\n\nI have saved over 100 lives in ocean rescues, the majority of them being off duty, while surfing or teaching surfing.\n\nLifeguarding at Kahaluu and White Sands (Magic Sands) Beach Parks in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii | 1985-1991\n\nThe 1980s in Hawaii was a formative period in the development of public water safety services. Many popular beaches on the Big Island of Hawaii, such as White Sands (Magic Sands) Beach in Kailua-Kona, did not have lifeguard stations or towers. The traditional Hawaiian name for the site is La'a Loa.\n\nThe photos shared here are from my Surfing Scrapbook.\n\nLifeguarding White Sands Beach (La'a Loa) | Kailua-Kona, Hawaii | 1989\n\nLifeguarding White Sands Beach (La'a Loa) | Kailua-Kona, Hawaii | 1990\n\nWhite Sands Point (La'a Loa) | Kailua-Kona, Hawaii | 2000 | Click to \"A Brief History of Surfing\"\n\nKahaluu Beach Park | County of Hawaii\n\nKuemanu Heiau (surfing shrine) | Kahaluu Beach Park, Big Island of Hawaii | Click enlarge\n\nStudents learning to surf at the Kuemanu Heiau surfing shrine at Kahaluu Beach Park\n\nLifeguarding at Hapuna Beach State Park in South Kohala, Hawaii, with Lifeguards Hawaii State\n\nHapuna State Beach has a long history of drowning and near-drowning incidents. During the 1970s and 80s, while Hawaii County provided lifeguard services at County beach parks, State beach parks were left unguarded.\n\nHapuna State Beach was particularly dangerous due to the deep water and north-west exposure, making the beach wide open to large and powerful north-west ocean swells during the winter months.\n\nIn 1990, the State opened a contract for private lifeguarding organizations to provide water safety services at Hapuna for the first time. Honolulu-based Lifeguards Hawaii State, owned and operated by John Quincy Adams (aka, JQA), took charge of the lifeguard program for first three years.\n\nHawaii County lifeguard tower at Hapuna Beach State Park\n\nFollowing the precedent set in January 1992, when the City and County of Honolulu was elected to place lifeguards at the notoriously dangerous Keawaula Beach on Oahu, an agreement was soon reached on the Big Island between Hawaii County and the State of Hawaii, leading to County lifeguards being stationed at Hapuna State Beach.\n\nI was fortunate enough to be active during this formative period in the Big Island's water safety programs, having worked for the County, as well as Lifeguards Hawaii State.\n\nWinter 1992 | Lifeguarding at Hapuna Beach State Park | Lifeguards Hawaii State\n\nThe first lifeguard tower at Hapuna Beach State Park in South Kohala, Hawaii | Lifeguards Hawaii State\n\nCalifornia State Park Lifeguarding in San Clemente, Orange Coast State District\n\nJust prior to County guards being officially stationed at Hapuna, I was accepted to the California State Park Lifeguard Training Program at Huntington Beach. Luckily, I survived the rigorous training and testing period at Huntington and got hired as a California State Park Lifeguard in San Clemente, Orange Coast District – a great place to be a surfer-lifeguard!\n\nSan Clemente was home to the surf beaks known collectively as \"Trestles\" at San Onofre State Beach, and being from out of state, I was allowed to camp and use the facilities at Trestles Headquarters (THQ) overlooking the breaks during the summer of 1992.\n\nSurfing and Ocean Safety in Phuket, Thailand\n\nAfter moving to the resort island of Phuket, Thailand, in 2007, to study for my MBA in Hospitality and Tourism Management, I became interested in ocean safety at local beaches.\n\nDuring my first week on the island, I made several surf-related rescues at unguarded beaches. That year, during the Southwest Monsoon (May to October), I rescued five tourists in the surf, and decided to conduct water safety research on the island. My study found that surfers were unintentionally acting as surrogate lifeguards at Phuket beaches, assisting tourists and the general public who got into trouble in the surf.\n\nI wrote several articles for a local magazine on related subjects, created the Phuket Ocean Safety Guide, and in April of 2010, the research made the front page of the Phuket Gazette. I also discussed this issue in my Master's (MBA) thesis, \"Coastal resource assessment for surf tourism in Thailand,\" and on local radio.\n\nWater Safety and Lifeguarding Experience\n\n1991-2019 Lifeguards Hawaii State\n\nWater Safety Consultant\n\n1998-2003 Hawaii Lifeguard Surf Instructors (HLSI)\n\nSurfing and Ocean Safety Instructor\n\n1987-1997 American Red Cross, Hawaii Island Chapter\n\nInstructor in Lifeguarding, Swimming, First Aid and CPR\n\nWater Safety Instructor (WSI)\n\n1991-1992 California State Park Lifeguard\n\nState Lifeguard – California Department of Parks and Recreation\n\n1985-1991 County of Hawaii\n\nWater Safety Officer (WSO II)\n\n1992-1993 Boy Scouts of America\n\nBoy Scout Merit Badge Instructor in First Aid and CPR\n\n1988-1990 Ocean Sports Waikoloa\n\nFirst Aid and CPR Instructor\n\n1987-1997 Red Cross Swimming and Water Safety Instructor\n\nSwimming, Water Safety and Lifeguard Instructor\n\nFirst Aid and CPR Instructor\n\n1988-1992 Parker High School, Hawaii\n\nSwimming Coach, Water Safety and Lifeguard Instructor\n\nFirst Aid and CPR Instructor\n\nLetters of Recommendation | Water Safety\n\nBoy Scouts of America – Hawaii Aloha Council\n\nAmerican Red Cross – Appreciation Awards\n\nState of California – Department of Parks and Recreation Recommendation\n\nLifeguards Hawaii State – Chief of Operations Letter of Recognition\n\nThank you for visiting my Lifeguarding and Ocean Safety Page.\n\nI hope you enjoy the photos and the information in the links provided.

It has been a great way to bring together my personal experience in surfing, surf travel, managing an international surf school (1998-2003), and academic research and publication.\n\nCelebrities from Bangkok try surfing for the first time in Phuket\n\nMy personal experience and research indicate that the world's surfing breaks are iconic locations worthy of protection for future generations. Surf sites are also significant economic engines for local communities with sustainability a key issue.\n\nTo address these problems, I developed the Surf Resource Sustainability Index (SRSI), a methodology aimed at measuring the conservation aptitude at surf sites. SRSI is a metric-orientated planning and development methodology – a theoretical compass which points toward sustainability, representing the summation of assessable qualities or attributes a site possesses which can make a positive contribution to sustainability.\n\nView SRSI Research Poster (PDF)\n\nView SRSI Presentation (PDF)\n\nNEWS | Surfers save the Eisbach River wave in downtown Munich, Germany\n\nThe Eisbach River Wave (Eisbachwelle) is one of the best and most consistent city-center river surfing spots in the world.\n\nWhen local authorities planned to destroy the Eisbachwelle, local and international surfers responded with a public campaign and online petition to \"save the wave\"...

The dissertation develops a Surf Resource Sustainability Index (SRSI) and presents it through a series of three peer-reviewed journal papers. The SRSI is designed as a global model and framework of indicators and methods for the assessment of surf site conservation attributes. A systematic literature review of surf tourism research was used in conjunction with the author’s personal experience and discussion with experienced surfers and scholars to develop twenty-seven sustainability indicators. Framing them as social, economic, environmental and governance indices, the study defines the criteria, implications and applicability for each indicator in context. A progression of field studies was carried out in Phuket, Thailand, where an emerging surf tourism market segment is additive to the island’s bustling tourism economy and escalating coastal resource management issues. The SRSI has proven effective in assessing sites and pinpointing key areas of concern. SRSI metrics are particularly applicable to the cross-sectional evaluation of surf sites and serve as a direct method in the prioritization of sites for surfing reserve development. This research contributes to the fields of surf resource conservation and tourism management through the innovation and application of a new and pragmatic methodology.\n\nKeywords: coastal management, conservation, sustainability indicators, surf resource sustainability index, surf tourism, Phuket, Thailand\n\nMy PhD process\n\nMy PhD was research-based and followed a standard protocol set forth by the Faculty of Environmental Management.

Underpinning the research is the collection and review of the literature on coastal resource management, surfing in Thailand, and the scholarly works pertaining to surf tourism. From a social science standpoint, personal interviews with Thai and foreign resident surfers, tourists, and members of local communities were carried out. The investigation locates a wide range of areas suitable for surf tourism and indicates that Thailand’s natural resources are somewhat limited and coupled with issues of water quality, ocean safety, regularity and quality of surfing waves, and the accessibility to remote coastal areas during the southwest monsoon. The study finds that surf tourism in Thailand is at a stage of infancy, has potential, and affords an opportunity to develop sustainably. The research advances the overall understanding of surfing in Thailand and offers a series of recommendations for the coastal resource management and conservation of surfing areas.\n\nKeywords: surf tourism, coastal resource, coastal assessment, Andaman, Phuket, Thailand\n\nAcademic papers and publications\n\nMartin, S.

Employing a systematic review of journal papers published from 2011 to 2020, the study addresses the previous grey literature problem of accessibility and eligibility criteria for citation. Findings are drawn from explicit and tangential studies which capture an up-to-date overview of the evolution of surf tourism research. The study identifies active journals, authors, field locations, and leading areas of research, suggesting that the field has entered a period of ‘academic professionalization’.

Assessment scores from a previously published surf resource sustainability field study of nine beaches in Phuket, Thailand, were weighted against data taken from surveys of expert scholars and surfers from a range of diverse backgrounds. The study measured levels of significance among weighted and unweighted means and bias ratio for 27 social, economic, environmental and governance indicators. Differences between scores and weighted scores were, in general, low, but this was not the case in key areas of concern, notably governance, and areas where poor governance had negative consequences, such as water quality. The findings indicate that analysis of weighted data helps identify key metrics. We show that analysis of weighted data provides insights not apparent from working on unweighted data. The procedures and weighting strategies employed in this research can be used for tourism planning and other related research activities which use interview data, such as research on, ecotourism, national park surveys, amateur fishing, snorkeling and reef tours. This study provides a conceptual framework for comparisons of different studies using similar protocols.\n\nKeywords: conservation; surf resource sustainability index; surf tourism; Thailand; tourism planning; weights\n\nView PDF\n\nMartin, S.

Scholars, graduate students, not-for-profit organizations, and commercial and governmental sectors have entered the surf tourism research field in order to better understand and manage surf sites. This research investigates the significance of 27 social, economic, environmental, and governance indicators outlined in the Surf Resource Sustainability Index, a contemporary methodology for measuring the conservation aptitude of surf sites. Twenty-one highly experienced surfers from diverse backgrounds were chosen for in-depth interviews based on their position as key stakeholders and for their practical experience, knowledge, and interaction with the resource. The study finds that surfers placed the highest importance for conservation aptitude on beach quality, water quality, legislative status, biodiversity, and history. Overall, environmental and governance indicators were slightly more significant than social indicators, and economic indicators were the least significant. Stakeholders' comments and corresponding ratings are listed for each indicator and provide insight to their perspectives and evaluations. The research contributes to surf tourism planning and development though the clarification of sustainability indicators and the discernment of indicator importance by surfers. A surf resource conservation action matrix is developed for future policy design and management.\n\nKeywords: sustainability indicators; surf resource sustainability index; surf tourism; conservation aptitude\n\nView PDF\n\nMartin, S.

Published and unpublished literature from 1997 through to 2011 was collected through searching a variety of academic databases and communicating directly with the authors themselves. A systematic review was employed to identify and analyze the types of research emerging from international journals, universities, governments, and the not-for-profit sector. The study indicates a genesis in sport tourism literature, representing a new and available body of surf tourism research. We find that this new area of research has arisen mainly from the grey literature through the works of graduate students and consultants. Surfing events, artificial surfing reefs, and the sustainability of surf sites and host communities are among the most prolific areas under discussion and key arguments include socioeconomics, coastal management, and sustainable tourism. Approximately 10% of countries in the world with coastal surfing resources have been studied, and this and other findings indicate the potential for new areas of research in domestic and international tourism.

The research investigates the broad environment of Thailand through the survey and assessment of coastal resources in order to determine the plausibility of developing surf tourism in Thailand. The study also examines surf tourist characteristics in Phuket, Thailand, through unstructured and semi-structured personal interviews. The research identified five Thai provinces best suited for surf tourism and suggests that there are suitable locations for surfing and surf tourism, including those for advanced, intermediate, and beginner surfers. A Thailand-specific definition for surf tourism is put forward, reflecting the natural environment and the characteristics of current surf tourists.
