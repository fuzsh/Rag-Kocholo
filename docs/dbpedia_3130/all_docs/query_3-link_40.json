        "text": "Los Angeles County Lifeguards continued their dominance at the 2008 Ford United States Lifesaving Association’s National Lifeguard Championships winning the competition for the 22nd consecutive year on its home turf last weekend, which took place in Manhattan Beach for the first time. The Los Angeles County Lifeguard Association team defeated second-place Monmouth County Chapter of New Jersey by more than 400 points, 704 to 258.5.\n\n“As the L.A. County Lifeguard Association team captain, I was very proud of the athletic performances both in the surf and on the sand of the proud protectors of the L.A. County beaches and the public who comes to enjoy the surf,” said Jay Butki, who is captain of the Baywatch boat on his work days.\n\nLifeguards from New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Hawaii and California competed over three days that began last Thursday and concluded Saturday. A total of 40 chapters from across the country sent athletes, which numbered more than 400. The Southwest had the most chapters with 16 teams and the Southeast was next with nine teams. There were also three foreign chapters that competed.\n\nThe Junior Nationals also took place, which had another 400-plus athletes.\n\nThe competition began Thursday with heats in a few races and really kicked it into gear Friday. That is when the Los Angeles County Lifeguards took command as they opened up a 100-point lead heading into the final day of competition.\n\nBrian Murphy was one of the big contributors Friday with a victory in the Open Men’s Board Race, winning it for the fourth time in five years.\n\n“I’m just so stoked,” Murphy said. “The board is the one that I love to win and the Ironman is the one I want to win.”\n\nHe got off to a good start heading toward the first buoy with an Australian racer pushing him. He nearly made a major mistake at that point of the race, but corrected himself as the glaring sun off the ocean had sent him off course, almost missing a buoy.\n\n“From there I saw that he wasn’t watching where he was going as much and I just pulled away from there.”\n\nJordan O’Boyle of Sussex County, Del., finished second.\n\nMurphy also won the coveted open men’s Ironman race on the final day, which consists of a swim, paddleboard and surf ski. Los Angeles County’s Micah Carlson finished second.\n\nAfter the three days, Murphy also won the men’s overall open points title with 47.75 points edging past teammate Chad Carvin, who finished with 45.75 points. Carlson finished third with 29.75 points.\n\n“Brian Murphy turned in a series of great performances finishing in first place in the Ironman, paddleboard, rescue race, board rescue and the Taplin Relay,” said Butki. “While Brian’s three older brothers may accuse him of focusing on ‘obtainable goals,’ the rest of us saw an ocean athlete that dominated with his skills, technique and fitness in the surf.”\n\nIt was a very successful weekend for one of the South Bay’s most gifted lifeguards.\n\n“This was the first year I have won the men’s overall point score,” said Murphy. “I’ve been second a couple of years in a row and this was the first year that I felt I could take it out if I played my cards right.”\n\nIt has been quite a busy summer for him, especially competing in the lifeguard nationals right after traveling to Germany to compete against lifeguards from around the world. The thought of burnout from competing in one event to the next has not crossed his mind, though.\n\n“It’s kind of actually revved me up even more for this event and I don’t really want to stop. I want to race next weekend, and the weekend after and the weekend after that. I can’t get enough of this stuff.”\n\nLos Angeles County swept the board events after Tandis Morgan won the open women’s board race.\n\n“I feel like I had a really good start and then the Aussies pulled ahead obviously, but I was kind of expecting that and I felt like it was between me and maybe two other girls,” said Morgan.\n\nShe dropped into second place rounding the first buoy and drafted behind Mindy Nowviskie of the Volusia Surf Lifesaving Association from there until they rounded the final buoy and approached the breaking waves near shore.\n\n“I knew that I would use the runs to get back in and beat her and hope that I caught a wave and that’s kind of what happened. We were on the same wave on the inside and it was a run up the beach.”\n\nIt was the second victory in three years in the event at nationals. Last year she finished second to Nowviskie.\n\nThere were also great performances by lifeguards from other chapters.\n\nKatherine Noland of the Fort Lauderdale Ocean Rescue team defended her title in the open women’s surf swim race.\n\n“I knew I had a target on my back going in,” said Noland, who was in Manhattan Beach for the first time. “I was extremely nervous because last year it was on the East Coast, and the East Coast is known for its running and the West Coast is known for its swimming. My nerves were definitely in check before that race.”\n\nNoland edged Diane Graner-Gallas of Manhattan Beach and the Los Angeles County team for the victory.\n\nOnce again the dory boats provided plenty of drama for spectators and teams alike. This year, Bill George and Chris Hoch of the Monmouth County Chapter team of New Jersey are national champions as they led from the start. They held off veterans Mitch Kahn and James Birdsell of the Los Angeles County Lifeguard Association team.\n\n“He really pushed us to the max,” said George of Kahn. “He rode very well on the course.”\n\nKahn is one of George’s heroes. It is just the second year for George and Hoch racing in the event. George, of the Monmouth County Chapter, and Hoch, of Fort Lauderdale, hooked up not too long ago and it nearly paid dividends last year as they came in a close second.\n\nWinning against legendary teams from Los Angeles County teams on their home turf was something George will never forget.\n\n“To be out here on their home course and be fortunate enough, and I do mean fortunate because to win this race with all this great competition you’ve got to be a little bit lucky, and we were just that today. I think we were good and were one of the stronger teams in the field.”\n\nHoch was confident the pair would prevail after a close defeat last year.\n\n“We lost by inches last year and this year we weren’t going to lose it. It’s the best feeling. I’ve been wanting this race for a long time.”\n\n“The guy we expected to win, he won it,” said Jon Van Duinwyk of the Los Angeles County team.\n\nTom Seth of Manhattan Beach, who won this event in 1998 with Mike O’Donnell, spoke highly of this year’s champions.\n\n“Those guys are huge and super, super strong. They’re absolutely amazing.”\n\nVan Duinwyk said that the conditions favored the East Coast dory boat teams.\n\n“This is what the East Coast would look like, this choppy shore dump with a very short run. My partner and me, we excel in glassier conditions where there is a lower tide where my partner is really fast, and he can beat people in the run transitions and give us leads on the rowing.”\n\nWinning the dory race is quite an honor and achievement because of the competitiveness of the teams.\n\n“These aren’t guys that are just coming just to do it,” said Seth, who works in Santa Monica and has been a lifeguard for 22 years. “They’re all really intent on winning so it’s the best of the best from all over the country.”\n\nFamilies were able to come out and see their fathers, mothers and friends compete against other lifeguards for a change.\n\n“It’s so wonderful because I got to come see the nationals,” said Berne Van Duinwyk, mother of Jon Van Duinwyk who lives in Thousand Oaks.\n\nLauren Briskin, who graduated from Mira Costa and now attends the University of Michigan, is working this summer as a lifeguard. She watched while on duty and was enjoying the competition.\n\nWhether they won in their respective events or not, Manhattan Beach was a winner. Visiting lifeguards gushed about the city and its beaches.\n\n“This is my first time here and this is a beautiful venue,” said George. “This is the nicest venue I’ve ever been to.”\n\nOthers were ready to make a move from their respective cities, if they had the chance.\n\n“If I wasn’t so established in Florida with being a lieutenant with the fire department and two kids and a wife there, I’m here in a heartbeat,” said Hoch.\n\nJamie Jones, 20, was thrilled when she found out Manhattan Beach was going to be the host. She worked hard to be a part of the Sussex County, Del., team so she could make the trip. It was her first time to California.\n\n“I was so stoked. I think this a great beach to have it on.”\n\nThe water took a little getting used to for some of the competitors though, especially those who work in warmer waters.\n\n“It is a lot different, big waves and cold water,” said Joyce Fuhrman of the Hollywood Beach Patrol from Florida. “It’s a big difference, but we’re fighting out there.”\n\nIt was a job for Butki, but even he was happy on how well it turned out. He was a co-chair of this year’s event along with Charlotte Graham. Manhattan Beach’s first try at hosting the event was a success.\n\n“I’m pretty happy considering the economy and the price of flights and fuel and everything that we’ve got this good of a turnout so I’m pretty happy with it,” he said. “Consensus and reviews from a lot of people told me they thought it was the best USLA national lifeguard championships ever in the 28-year history.”\n\nNot since 1994, when the competition took place in Hermosa Beach, has the South Bay had the honors of hosting the event.\n\n“I thought overall it was an awesome event,” said Patrick Cary of the Los Angeles County team. “This was my first USLA nationals and I was very impressed.”\n\nLocal lifeguards enjoyed for one year the chance to attend the event in their own backyard.\n\n“It’s awesome,” said Morgan, who lives in Redondo Beach. “It means I can ride my bike to the competition instead of having to pay several hundred dollars for airfare to get out there and then food and the whole bit. I’m able to be much more relaxed and a little more prepared and more rested for the races.”\n\nMurphy enjoyed its location even more since he lives in Manhattan Beach, but had initial concerns on whether it was logistically going to work out for the visiting lifeguard teams. He thought parking and hotel requirements might hamper the event. He never heard any such complaints, however.\n\n“To my surprise I have only heard positives from the other competitors. A couple of people from the East Coast joked they like it so much they want to move to Manhattan. The surf was not as big and crazy as I would have preferred but there was enough swell to make all the events entertaining as a spectator and enjoyable as a competitor. I cannot praise the city of Manhattan Beach enough for being such gracious hosts. It was great to have one of the best beach communities in the world hosting one of the most prestigious beach events in the U.S.”\n\nOver the years many athletes have represented Los Angeles County at nationals. This year’s team deserves recognition for keeping the consecutive winning streak alive at 22 and counting. This year there were 48 men and 19 women.\n\nIn alphabetical order, they are: Jose Abasolo, Tom Barnett, Frank Bird, Maria Bird, Dan Bleicher, Jay Butki, Julia Caldas, Micah Carlson, Chad Carvin, Patrick Cary, Eric Chase, Tracey Crothers, Brian Cruz, Andrew Czer, Lauren Dale, Emily Dashiell, Chappie DeHaven, Craig Douglas, Nick Doyle, Cheri Ellington, Greg Fawley, Ann Finley, Joel Gitelson, James Goldsmith, Chris Grafton, Diane Graner-Gallas, Mike Hapke, Jeff Hart, Ed Henrich, Kristin Hundley, Patrick Jacobson, Mitch Kahn, Nick Kartychok, David Kintas, Raymond Koehler, John Larson, Shari Latta, Shannon Leavitt, Shauna Letvin, Christine Linkletter, Renee Locarnini, Jerry Lopopolo, Jerry Lozano, Ranald MacKinnon, John Matesich, Jim McConica, Jeff Monroe, Tandis Morgan, Steve Morgan, Tyler Morgan, Bill Mount, Brian Murphy, Chris Murphy, Mike Murphy, Eldin Onsgard, Erik Pronovost, Cori Raffaelli, Charlie Raine, Carly Rogers, Tom Seth, Mel Solberg, Bonnie Spivey, Randy Steigley, Shannon Sullivan, Bruno Tapia, Anthony Vela and Mike Zitta.\n\n“I’m not sure how many times L.A. has won, but I don’t think we will be losing that title any time in the next decade,” said Murphy. “There just aren’t enough young competitors coming up to fill the spots of some veteran competitors from different beaches around the country. L.A. is the only beach circulating new talent but, in my opinion, not at a fast enough rate.”\n\nJust when you thought the season was winding down for these lifeguards, they have one more big test before the fall weather arrives.\n\n“Brian, along with fellow L.A. lifeguards Cary, Carlson, Tandis Morgan and Crothers will be tested when they represent the United States Lifesaving Association as part of a 10-person team competing at the Sanyo Bussan International Lifesaving Cup at Onjuku Beach in Chiba, Japan, against teams representing Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, South Africa and two teams representing Japan,” said Butki.\n\nThat competition is scheduled for Sept. 7.\n\nBelow are the final results of the team competition and top 10 individuals in points that competed in the men’s and women’s open races.\n\nChapter Points ‘A’\n\n(131 events)\n\n1.
