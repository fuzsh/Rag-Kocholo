        "text": "Surf Life Saving originated in Australia in the early 1900s with the growth of seaside towns and the interest in swimming. Surf Life Saving was then introduced into Great Britain in 1955 in Bude and St Agnes in Cornwall, and Brighton in Sussex.\n\nClubs were formed in Wales during the mid-1960s at Aberavon, Atlantic College , Barry St Johns, Llantwit Major, Pen-y-bont, Porthmawr and Rhoose.\n\nThroughout 1967, leading into the winter of 1968, discussions took place between Charles Thomson, Leader of the Extramural Department at Atlantic College, John David and a number of other people, notably Reg Whittle, Frank Clark and Alf Thomas, in creating the Surf Life Saving Association of Wales. In the spring of 1968, John David was elected as the first Chairman, Reg Whittle as Secretary and Margaret Whittle as Treasurer.\n\nThe Surf Life Saving Association Wales is a not-for-profit Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO) Number ~ 1157762. Thirty-one voluntary lifeguard clubs currently affiliate with SLSA Wales from Jacksons Bay, Barry in the east to Aberystwyth in the west and Rhosneigr on Anglesey in the north. The majority of our lifesavers complete patrols on the weekend and in their own free time.\n\nThe primary aims and objectives are to save lives, develop and improve National and International standards of lifesaving whilst cooperating with all organisations with similar goals. We also aim to provide the facilities for young people to participate in organised lifesaving activities and sports competitions.\n\nWe are governed by a Management Board of Trustees who are supported by four commissions representing Lifesaving, Powercraft, Sport and Youth. The Commissions are responsible for delivering the annual management plan to support the Board's strategies that will see the organisation fulfil its purpose.\n\nSurf lifesaving in Wales, would not exist without its army of volunteers and it is almost impossible to overstate our gratitude to the many thousands of community focused members who have contributed to this. Below are some of these volunteers, who we have recognised in some small way of the years:\n\nLIFE MEMBERS\n\nMichael Allen Gerald Bassett Lyle Bluck Glenn Clatworthy John David Martin John Chris Parry Paul Scarborough Peter Lake MBE James Marks Colin Morris Paul Edwards\n\nAndrea Pennell Philip Rees Tony Rees Dallas Robinson Elizabeth Thomas Patrick Thomas\n\nCraig Robinson\n\nDECEASED LIFE MEMBERS\n\nEssex Havard Frank Smith Charles Thomson MBE O.St.J.
