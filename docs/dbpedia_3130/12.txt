Since 2018, the organization has been using artificial intelligence to collect data on rip currents and people swimming near them. When people enter an area with rip currents or high wind, the system sends an alert to smartphones, digital signage and watches so beach users understand the risk and lifeguards can respond quickly to potential incidents.

To help increase the number of certified lifeguards in the country, JLA offers a variety of water safety courses and lifesaving programmes for all ages. Under the lifesaving certificate programme, people aged 15 years or older can take a four-day Basic Surf Lifesaving Course, which includes training on first aid and CPR, as well as tube and board rescues.

Instructors at JLA, as well as lifeguards, volunteer their time to teach children water safety skills and patrol the beaches. All of this work is aimed to prevent drowning throughout the country.
