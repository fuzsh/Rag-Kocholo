        "text": "The Oregon Tech experience is not complete without our many co-curricular activities, which allow students to build on their academic studies in ways that produce dividendsâ€”such as work or life experience and, in some cases, a paycheck. These activities, programs and learning experiences complement what you are learning in your coursework and better prepare you for future work environments. Consider them an entry into your field (think: internships), the community (say, volunteering or working at a clinic), or the world (you can spend time studying in Finland and elsewhere). Below are just a few examples."
