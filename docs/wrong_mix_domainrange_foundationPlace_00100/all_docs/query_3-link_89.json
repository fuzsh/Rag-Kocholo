        "text": "Adrianne Crawford\n\nNothin’ But Treble\n\nMy name is Adrianne Crawford and I am part of the Nothin But Treble all women’s accapella group here at Georgia Tech. This group has taught me that although we go to a STEM based school many of us have an itch for the arts and it is important to be proactive and proud of the things you are passionate about. When I first joined an accapella group, I didn’t feel like anyone would understand the time and effort put into the pieces but I was quickly proven wrong. There is no way to describe the rewarding feeling of doing something you are passionate about and having the support of so many amazing people at this school. Not to mention, I always have the most amazing sisters who are always the loudest ones in the audience:)\n\nHarika Kosaraju - MC 20\n\nmiracle outreach\n\nMiracle at Georgia Tech has truly been such a rewarding experience! I had heard about college dance marathons when I was in high school and thought that these organizations were primarily for fundraising purposes, but only after joining Miracle did I learn that there is truly so much more that we stand and strive for. Miracle aims to raise awareness, engagement, and funds to benefit Children’s Miracle Network (CMN), and we do so through hosting events at Georgia Tech and across Atlanta. Being able to make an impact on the lives of the patients at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta is invaluable! At Dance Marathon 2022, we were able to hear from pediatric patients of all ages and their families, hosted a Battle of the Bands competition and a doctor panel, and found out we raised over $120K throughout the year for CMN! I was on the Community Outreach Committee last year, where we helped run Child Health Day at GT and the Mini Dance Marathon at a local high school, and I am so excited to be serving as Community Outreach Director for this upcoming year so I can continue helping to spread the great work being done by Miracle throughout our community!\n\nMaryanne Hable - MC 20\n\nCPC Director of Environmental Initiatives/ GRNA\n\nBy being the CPC Director of Environmental Initiatives/GRNA I have been able to meet such powerful women with amazing leadership skills. They have become not only become role models but some of my best friends as well. Moreover, by being someone who is passionate about climate change and ensuring we are giving back to the environment, I have learned how to be that impact on Greek life. I ensure that we are all recycling and discarding cardboard in the correct places. Overall without the encouragement of my sisters, never would I have thought of representing Greek life as the CPC Director of Environmental Initiatives/GRNA!\n\nMaggie Bradley- MC 21\n\nFor the Kids\n\nThe miracle network is such an important cause that I was so lucky to be a part of my first year here at Georgia Tech. This year, I served on the Family and Hospital Relations committee that worked to share the incredible stories of these children as well as to show support to their families in times of struggle and times of celebration. During Dance Marathon, I was able to spend the day with these families, hearing their stories more in detail and getting to know them more on a personal level, which was beyond rewarding. I joined Miracle because when my family was suffering through a difficult time medically, we had a community of support there for us for whatever we needed. Coming out on the other side, I really wanted to give back to families in the same if not worse situations if only to show that someone out there is always routing for them! The miracle community is so large and so welcoming, and it truly feels like you are making a difference where it is needed the most.\n\nEmma Downey- MC 20\n\nVP Philanthropy 2021-2022\n\nWhen I joined Alpha Chi, I quickly became passionate about our philanthropy, Domestic Violence Awareness. I knew that I wanted to be involved with such an important issue, and joined the Philanthropy Committee. While on the committee, I realized I wanted to become a leader in philanthropy events and programming in Alpha Chi. After I became VP of Philanthropy in the fall, I wanted to continue promoting DVA and raising money for the local domestic violence shelter, which is where our fundraising efforts go. As VP Philanthropy, I have organized events that raise awareness, in the form of healthy relationship education, and fundraise for the local shelter so that they can run more smoothly. I am so passionate about DVA because it is such an important issue to talk about, especially on a college campus. I am so grateful for Alpha Chi for allowing me to support and learn more about DVA.\n\nDanielle Brown\n\nGT Lax Member\n\nGeorgia Tech Women’s club lacrosse has given me so many amazing memories. This year I’ve had a constant support from the older sisters on the team, helping me to acclimate to playing college level lacrosse. I’m so grateful that I had the opportunity to play with these girls, and become family with them (both figuratively and literally... my big and grand big play lacrosse). Being a part of this team is what helped me settle into being hundreds of miles from home, and gave me my first AXO friends (of which made me decide to COB AXO). This hasn’t been just a sport to me... through the sprints, incredible season, food dates, burpees, and a hate for uga (booooo), this year would not have been complete without my lacrosse team, and those even more than just teammates... my sisters.\n\nAmanda Wooten\n\nCompetitive Rock Climber\n\nI competed on the youth circuit for 6 years on the stone summit team, progressively placing higher nationally in speed climbing. I earned a place on the US team four years consecutively, and placed in the top eight at all of those youth world championships. There was a period of time during which I held the female national record for the 15 meter speed wall, and I was also the first American female to break both the 10 second and the 9 second barriers. More recently, I placed in the top 10 at the Open Invitational competition, which was the first olympic qualifier event for rock climbing, and I won the Collegiate National Championship for speed climbing.\n\nTabitha D’Amato - MC 19\n\nGeorgia Tech Cheer Member\n\nI've been a cheerleader since I was six years old and it was always my dream to cheer at Georgia Tech. It's been amazing not only to achieve my dreams, but to also do it alongside my closest friends and sisters! I've loved bringing smiles and school spirit to Bobby Dodd Stadium, McCamish Pavilion, and O'Keefe Gym as a cheerleader and interact with students, alumni, and fans to make their days on campus even more special. It has been so fun to cheer on the sidelines with sisters both in cheer and on the Goldrush dance team, and there is never a dull moment when I'm on the sidelines with them! My time at Georgia Tech would not be complete without cheerleading, but it brings me even more joy to do it with some real strong women by my side."
