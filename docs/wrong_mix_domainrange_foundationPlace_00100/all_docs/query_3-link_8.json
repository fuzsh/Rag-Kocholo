        "text": "Excel Curriculum\n\nExcel courses are specialized sessions designed to provide essential academic career and personal success. Every student is exposed to the course's full curriculum however, students in the Excel program at Georgia Tech are responsible for learning a modified portion of the curriculum based on their individual functional level.\n\nExcel courses include content in:\n\nReading and Writing Comprehension\n\nMath\n\nScience/Technology\n\nFinancial Literacy and Money Management\n\nInterpersonal Communication/Social Skills\n\nCommunity Engagement\n\nProject-Based Learning\n\nCareer Exploration and Preparation\n\nPreparing for After-College Transitions\n\nExcel Mentorship Program\n\nMentors provide a foundation of support as Excel students integrate into the Georgia Tech community. Social inclusion enhances lives by creating an environment where students can meaningfully participate in activities with their same-aged peers. Mentors empower students to navigate campus resources and explore Georgia Tech’s social environment, whether it is joining a campus organization, attending an event, or developing meaningful friendships with other students. Mentors also serve as resources for navigating the greater Atlanta area. Off-campus activities promote the development of social awareness that is transferrable to non-university scenarios vital for independent life after graduation.\n\nCategories of support include:\n\nAcademic Mentor – support with developing and enhancing academic skills and providing in-class support as needed.\n\nSocial Mentor – facilitate progression toward building social skills and developing a social network on campus.\n\nFitness Mentor – assist students to develop healthy habits and active lifestyles.\n\nCooking Mentor – work with students to expand their familiarity in the kitchen and their independent cooking skills.\n\nIndependent Living\n\nExcel provides instruction in independent living skills through a classroom-based curriculum and provides additional reinforcement of lessons learned through its peer support program. Students learn to manage a busy schedule with class, work, fitness, cooking instruction, and more."
