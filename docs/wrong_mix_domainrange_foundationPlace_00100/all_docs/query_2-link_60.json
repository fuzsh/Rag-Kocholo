I enrolled in the Tech Excellence program because I was interested in emerging technologies and learning the latest and greatest. While the Tech Excellence program does have a fixed program, so to speak, it can actually be pretty flexible to fit your specific needs. What most impressed me about the program was just the amount of camaraderie I had with the other students and also the staff at Booz Allen in General Assembly really made us feel supported. My greatest achievement since joining the Tech Excellence program was working on client site and helping clients deliver their data science needs. If you want to grow your tech career, then join Booz Allen Hamilton. They provide all the resources you could possibly need and more."
