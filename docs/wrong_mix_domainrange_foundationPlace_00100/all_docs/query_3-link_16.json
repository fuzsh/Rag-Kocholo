        "text": "The Microsoft Digital Skills Center is a collaboration between TechSoup and Microsoft that offers a subset of training courses via TechSoup Courses. These courses are designed to help you learn how to use and get the most out of the Microsoft tools.\n\nRead this blog post to learn how you and your nonprofit can benefit from the Digital Skills Center courses.\n\nWe also created this blog post to share some insights into the development of our courses and provide an overview of the different types of courses that we offer.\n\nNo, each learner needs to sign up for their individual TechSoup Courses account and set up their learner’s profile. This will help them keep track of their learning progress and ensure that they are meeting their performance milestones.\n\nHowever, if you would like to offer this training to your entire department or organization, please contact us to learn more.\n\nIn order to obtain a certificate of completion, you will need to complete each module in the course, which allows you to earn TechPoints. Once you complete the course and have earned the required TechPoints, you will need to finish the online short evaluation and then you will be eligible for obtaining your certificate online.\n\nYou can download your TechSoup course certificate by following these instructions:\n\nLog in to your TechSoup Courses account.\n\nOnce you log in, you will be taken directly to your dashboard where you can see all your registered courses.\n\nScroll down to “My Courses” and go to the course for which you would like to obtain the certificate.\n\nClick the GO TO COURSE button.\n\nClick on My Certificate at the top right.\n\nClick on Download Certificate."
