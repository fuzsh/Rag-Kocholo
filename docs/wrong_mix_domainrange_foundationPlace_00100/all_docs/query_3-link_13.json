        "text": "Tech is a cool place! There is a lot of innovation here even on the staff side of things and here you are a part of it. There is also a natural sense of belonging at Tech because even though it might take time to get adjusted, you are immediately connected to everyone who has ever been a part of Tech.\n\nWhen I first moved to Georgia in 2019 from North Carolina, my first thought was “I want to work for Georgia Tech”. From a person looking from the outside in, I felt Georgia Tech would provide a place of inclusivity, a feeling of genuine belonging and provide an atmosphere of great technology and innovation. Fast forward 4 years I can say that is true."
