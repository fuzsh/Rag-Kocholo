        "text": "Develop a game plan for integrating AI into your PPM practices.\n\nWhat is Exponential IT?\n\nExponential IT is a framework defined by Info-Tech Research Group.\n\nThe technology curve has recently bent exponentially.\n\nGenerative AI has been the catalyst for this sudden shift, but there are more and more new technologies emerging (e.g. quantum computing, 5G), putting significant pressure on all organizations.\n\nSpeed is now imperative. All IT leaders and organizations are at risk of falling behind if they do not adopt new technologies fast enough.\n\nOur framework instructs all IT leaders on how to transform their organization and elevate their value-creation capabilities, to close the gap between the exponential progression of technological change and the linear progression of IT's ability to successfully manage that change.\n\nThis research provides IT leaders with industry-specific priorities for Exponential IT and how to begin an effective Exponential IT transformation resulting in value creation.\n\nWhat does Exponential IT mean for project portfolio management (PPM)?\n\nThe project and project portfolio management space is on the verge of being heavily disrupted by AI and generative AI technologies.\n\nAn estimated 80% of project management tasks will be performed by AI by the year 2030 (Harvard Business Review, 2023), and 72% of project management professionals say AI is highly likely to change their roles (Harrin, 2024).\n\nAs a PPM leader, you need a game plan to transform your practices and meet leadership expectations without simply buying into vendor-driven hype and biting off more than you can chew.\n\nAnalyst perspective\n\n\"The future is over-forecasted and underpredicted.\"\n\nArthur De Vany)\n\nFor every prediction of technology's future in the ballpark of accurate, there are many more that take a swing and miss or at least take a swing and leave us waiting.\n\nFor instance, while the 1939 World's Fair accurately showcased the impending boom of television broadcasting and posited a vision of highway and automobile travel that would come to be some 20 years later, it also hosted displays that claimed flying cars, underwater cities, and fully autonomous homes were all just around the corner. To be fair, in some of these cases the technology is getting there just not at the pace the 1939 fair vendors predicted.\n\nWith AI and GenAI, humanity is once again at the dawn of an era where the separation of realistic, near-term technology targets from longer-term ones is murky. PPM practitioners might not have kept their reputations intact if they had burned the boats a year ago based on vendor hype, and they shouldn't do so today. They should make and validate a plan to integrate new technology with caution.\n\nWhile AI holds transformative promise, there is no magic wand to realize its potential. Create a strategy that balances near-term sure bets with longer-term big swings to avoid promising your stakeholders the equivalent of a flying car when a good, smooth highway is all that's possible and needed!\n\nTravis Duncan\n\nResearch Director, Project Portfolio Management\n\nInfo-Tech Research Group\n\nExecutive summary\n\nYour challenge Common obstacles Info-Tech's approach\n\nThe PPM space is on the verge of being disrupted by emerging technologies. As organizational leaders look to reinvent their current operating models to ensure viability in the face of market volatility and technological innovation, projects and PPM are top areas of focus for automation improvements.\n\nAs a PPM leader, you need a game plan to transform your practices and meet leadership expectations without simply buying into vendor-driven hype and biting off more than you can chew.\n\nEmphasis on \"on the verge of being disrupted.\" While the prospect of AI-enhanced, automated PPM outcomes is exciting, other than some small administrative efficiency gains in the near term, the technology for advanced PPM use case automation simply isn't ready yet.\n\nOrganizational leadership has FOMO. While the technology isn't quite ready, organizational leadership is conversely eager to unlock its promise. They want to know where the space is headed and where to make investments.\n\nFollow Info-Tech's practical, tactical, two-phase approach to establish and communicate a technology-driven PPM transformation plan that you can deliver.\n\nAssess Exponential IT readiness for PPM.\n\nDefine your PPM transformation strategy and goals.\n\nIdentify tactical use cases.\n\nDefine your near- and long-term roadmaps.\n\nOur approach includes tools and templates to help you achieve and maintain your transformation plan.\n\nInfo-Tech Insight\n\nUse the destination to inspire the journey. Exponential IT isn't about achieving AI-enabled automation overnight (the complexities of such a feat are impossible). Use your vision for future-state transformation as an opportunity to inspire the near- to medium-term adoption of long-neglected PPM fundamentals (e.g. sustainable processes, good data, strong accountability). With a firm foundation in place, you can build a transformation that will last.\n\nAre you ready?\n\nAs a PMO/PPM leader, are you ready to lead a transformation enabled by emerging technology?\n\nAs organizational leaders look to reinvent their current operating models to ensure viability in the face of market volatility and technological innovation, project planning and delivery are top areas of focus for automation improvements.\n\nPPM is on the verge of being disrupted by Exponential IT technologies, and PPM leaders need to prepare to help lead the transformation.\n\nIt goes without saying that AI and GenAI are driving this focus. The impacts of these technologies are already being felt, and some of their benefits realized, in some basic project management functions.\n\nAs the technology evolves and matures, it will help run more advanced functions, not just in project management, but in the PPM and organizational change management domains as well.\n\n80% of project management tasks will be performed by AI by the year 2030.\n\nSource: HBR, 2023\n\n72% of project management professionals say AI is highly likely to change their roles.\n\nSource: Harrin, 2024\n\nChange isn't coming it's already here\n\nExponential IT technologies are already changing the project management profession.\n\nStatistics show that project managers are already realizing the benefits and efficiencies of AI and GenAI within their roles, with the majority of practitioners either using or planning to use soon.\n\nWhile these gains are primarily being realized on simple tasks, it is only a matter of time before the technology disrupts more strategic portfolio-management-level activities.\n\nUse of AI by Project Managers\n\nSource: Capterra, 2024\n\nReset your focus\n\nAI and GenAI will retune the roles of PPM professionals but it won't replace them.\n\nInitial fears of project managers being replaced by AI technologies have given way to excitement and optimism about how these advancements will enhance project management roles and enable project and PPM staff to focus on more strategic activities.\n\n\"GenAI can support project management tasks in many ways. The more complex the task, the more human intervention is needed to result in high-quality outcomes.\"\n\nSource: PMI, 2023\n\nInfo-Tech predicts four key future-state objectives related to PPM and AI's potential\n\nSolve problems, not calendars\n\nAutomate traditional PMO capabilities.\n\nPlan in real time\n\nLet AI run ongoing resource allocation.\n\nAugment teams with AI\n\nLet AI fill in project portfolio, investment risk, and change management gaps.\n\nTrust but verify\n\nEnable true accountability.\n\n\"The next generation of AI tools will reward diligent leadership by making [resource] utilization, waste, and completed projects transparently obvious.\"\n\nBarry Cousins,\n\nDistinguished Research Fellow,\n\nInfo-Tech Research Group\n\nAs a PPM Leader you need to act, but you still have time to plan\n\nWhile there is reason for excitement, don't let FOMO drive your approach. This paradigm shift is still in its early days, and you have time to plan a strategic approach.\n\nVendors hype up what AI will do for PPM in the future, but not the specifics of how today's users can unlock its potential.\n\nThe potential is undoubtedly there, but advanced functionality is still forming. Don't let vendor hype put you in a reactive stance. You still have time to plan without jeopardizing outcomes.\n\nIndividual Benefit Phase\n\nBenefit Time frame: 0-1 year\n\nGains at the individual micro level.\n\nScaling Up Phase\n\nBenefit Time frame: 1-5 years\n\nGains at the team and employee upskill level\n\nWorkplace Maturity Phase\n\nBenefit Time frame: 6-10 years\n\nEntire organizations restructured around AI; global productivity gains realized\n\nSource: Oliver Wyman Forum (quoted in Stevenson, 2024)\n\nOnly 21% of respondents to a recent PMI survey said they are currently using AI in project work.\n\nSource: PMI, 2023\n\nPlan your route\n\nEven if your PMO isn't ready to implement AI-enabled use cases, as PMO/PPM leader you need a plan.\n\nEven if your organization or your PMO (or equivalent) is at low PPM maturity (i.e. you're not ready to transition to an Exponential IT paradigm in the near term), chances are your peers and leadership are still interested in using AI to unlock project efficiencies.\n\nYou need to provide direction. Even though in many cases the market and vendors are not ready to deliver on AI marketing hype, your leadership doesn't necessarily know this. They're looking to you for direction.\n\nIn a recent survey, only 8% of organizations had no current plans to adopt AI.\n\nSource: TechTarget, 2024\n\n77% of project management professionals are optimistic about the influence of AI in their roles.\n\nSource: TechTarget, 2024\n\nPlan your route based on your mandate\n\nAs with most things in PPM, a top-down mandate is best. If you're leadership is driving your approach, you need to leverage their support, but also get ahead of the hype.\n\nWhile AI is a cutting-edge technology, the success of its scaling up to the degree that it will deliver organizational business benefits will depend on governance models that look more old-school command-and-control than new-school distributed (i.e. universally usable, high-quality PPM data won't come naturally).\n\nUse your transformation plan to ensure executives are meaningfully committed to implementation success and not just chasing another new trend. Further, ensure they know what the technology is capable of in the near term It's not a magic wand!\n\nSource: IPMA\n\nInfo-Tech's approach\n\nUse our framework to ensure you have a measured plan that balances near-term quick wins and foundational components with a big picture, art-of-the-possible future-state vision.\n\nThe Info-Tech difference:\n\nA comprehensive yet flexible approach that can help you meet new challenges as they arise.\n\nA practical and tactical framework and template that will help you save time.\n\nIndustry best practices and practitioner-based insights.\n\nInfo-Tech's methodology for Transform PPM to Optimize Value From Every Investment\n\n1. Scout the Terrain 2. Set Tactical Goals Phase Steps\n\nAssess Your Readiness for Exponential IT in PPM\n\nDefine the Business Need\n\nSet Your Strategic PPM Transformation Goals\n\nMake Sense of Available Use Cases\n\nDevelop an Initial Roadmap for Exponential IT in PPM\n\nFinalize the First Iteration of Your Transformation Plan\n\nPhase Outcomes\n\nAn understanding of your current Exponential IT situation\n\nThe context of the business needs driving PPM transformation\n\nStrategic goals to help ensure your transformation is correctly focused and successful\n\nA tactical transformation plan that factors in near-term use cases (AI-enabled functionality that you can research and potentially pilot and implement within the next 12 months)\n\nA longer-term plan that you can iterate annually to ensure your Exponential IT journey is progressing and accelerating, where possible\n\nJust looking for PPM AI use cases?\n\nNot necessarily looking to transform but curious about use cases? Jump to step 2.1.\n\nYou don't need to go through all steps in this blueprint to unlock value.\n\nIf you are simply interested in knowing more about current- and future-state AI for PPM use cases, fast forward to step 2.1.\n\nIn this step, you'll find some key near-term and longer-term use cases, as well as Info-Tech's Excel-based AI for PPM Use Case Analysis Workbook, which contains a robust library of AI for PPM use cases and an analysis framework to assess them.\n\nInsight summary\n\nBlueprint insight: Make it about the journey, not the destination\n\nUse the destination to inspire the journey. Exponential IT isn't about achieving AI-enabled automation overnight (the complexities of such a feat are impossible). Use your vision for future-state transformation as an opportunity to inspire the near- to medium-term adoption of long-neglected PPM fundamentals (e.g. sustainable processes, good data, strong accountability). With a firm foundation in place, you can build a transformation that will last.\n\nPhase 1 insight\n\nStay calm and plan on. This isn't the first vendor-driven technology revolution PPM practitioners have been through. Don't burn the boats based upon social media hype or vendor marketing. You have plenty of time to make and validate a plan.\n\n1.1 Technology may help accelerate readiness.\n\nLow readiness doesn't necessarily preclude you from unlocking Exponential IT in the near term. The technology is developing so fast that the difference between \"ready\" and \"not\" may reduce more rapidly than we can predict.\n\n1.2 Don't let FOMO drive your approach.\n\nYou need a plan, but you're not necessarily at a disadvantage if you don't act today. Define the project challenges and business needs you're looking to address before you make any new, big investments. Your current vendors may be fine.\n\nPhase 2 insight\n\nKeep your ear to the ground. AI use cases for portfolio management and project management are still forming (i.e. still a bit underwhelming relative to the hype). Don't get complacent! This could change overnight. Stay tuned-in to AI developments across the landscape.\n\n2.1 Avoid getting caught up in AI anxiety.\n\nThe robots aren't coming to replace us they're coming to give us a hand! PPM staff have been overallocated for years. AI technology represents our chance to make the case for more process adoption, which will in turn free us from some tasks.\n\n2.2 Don't set it and forget it manage it!\n\nThe creation of a transformation roadmap shouldn't be a one-time activity. Take a rolling wave approach, balancing near-term wins with longer-term vision, and iterate on your plan at a cadence that makes sense."
