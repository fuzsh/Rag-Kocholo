The Microsoft Digital Skills Center is a collaboration between TechSoup and Microsoft that offers a subset of training courses via TechSoup Courses. These courses are designed to help you learn how to use and get the most out of the Microsoft tools.

Read this blog post to learn how you and your nonprofit can benefit from the Digital Skills Center courses.

We also created this blog post to share some insights into the development of our courses and provide an overview of the different types of courses that we offer.

No, each learner needs to sign up for their individual TechSoup Courses account and set up their learner’s profile. This will help them keep track of their learning progress and ensure that they are meeting their performance milestones.

However, if you would like to offer this training to your entire department or organization, please contact us to learn more.
