        "text": "In my paper I will explore the reception of reggaeton and Caribbean music in Spain during the XXIst century. This reception has suffered a dramatic turn in the last decade. From its origins in the late nineties in Puerto Rico, reggaeton quickly expanded overseas and became widely popular on the peninsular context. Famous Puerto Ricans reggaeton stars as Daddy Yankee or Don Omar became familiar for the general audience and the rhythms of this particular genre of Caribbean music was incorporated into the Spanish sound. This integration of reggaeton into Spanish music became twofold, showing the conflictual relation that the contemporary Spanish national identity has regarding its history of colonization in America: while on the one side reggaeton seemed to appeal to the Hispanic or latino essence of the country making Spanish people embrace reggaeton as something owned and distinctive of SpainÂ´s national character; reggaeton on the other side was considered to be as a degrading and cheap style of music related with low forms of culture due to its latino origins. This way, although reggaeton was the most common sound in most radios and night clubs during the decade of the 2000s, it was pretty uncommon to see a Spanish artist singing reggaeton or defining his music as close to reggaeton even if there was a clear influence. In the last years, however, the contradictive relation of Spanish culture with reggaeton has suffered a critical change thanks to the appearance of young Spanish artist who have considered a different approach in their relation with latino music. Young rappers as Ms Nina, Kaydy Cain or C. Tangana have openly defined their music as latina coining the term neoperreo, which alludes to a revival of old school reggaeton in the Spanish music. On my paper I will try to analyze the political aesthetics of these new artists in relation with the politics of identity in Spain. My analysis of this new musical phenomenon will show the appearance of a new identity between Spanish millennials which emerges in the context of the neoliberal crisis of the Spanish state and seeks to negotiate new ways of relating with Latinoamerica.\n\nThis textbook offers a refreshing vision of music from the Iberian Peninsula, delving into its complex diversity by addressing the multiplicity of regional genres, going beyond the well-known genres of fado and flamenco. The shift in perspective is immediately perceptible from the front cover illustration, a photo of bagpipers and drummers accompanied by a female gigante (giant) in medieval dress during a patron saint celebration in Cantabria. Throughout the first three chapters, the authors provide a broad overview of Spanish and Portuguese music that gives the reader a kaleidoscopic understanding of the rich and diverse musical genres existing across the two countries, contextualised through a range of historical, social and cultural backgrounds. The last two chapters do, however, concentrate on fado and flamenco, thus addressing the main themes that might interest a lecturer introducing their students to Iberian music. The richly illustrated book includes numerous activities and ..."
