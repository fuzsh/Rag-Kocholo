        "text": "Heredia performs up-tempo flamenco at Swallow Hill\n\nWho: Gypsy Flamenco Music and Dance, featuring René Heredia, Lisa Trujillo and Triceéa Bienvenida, with supporting dancers\n\nWhere: Swallow Hill Music Hall, 71 E. Yale Ave.\n\nWhen: Friday, March 26 and Saturday, March 27 at 8 p.m.\n\nTickets:$16; 303-777-1908 or 303-777-4786\n\nBy Glenn Giffin\n\nDenver Post Dance Critic\n\nMarch 26 - Feast or famine - that's what seems to have happened vis-a-vis flamenco. There was nothing in the way of performances and then, right in the space of two weeks, two high-powered ones. The first, José Greco II, took place last week. The second opens tonight as guitarist René Heredia headlines two evenings of \"Gypsy Flamenco Music and Dance'' at the Swallow Hill Music Hall. Mother of flamenco song\n\nThe event has two missions: to promote the Swallow Hill Music Center on its 20th anniversary and to promote \"flamenco puro'' rather than flamenco that has been adulterated by showbiz trappings.\n\n\"We're going to be doing a very fast-paced, up-tempo show,'' noted Heredia. \"It's not going to have the traditional gypsy martinete (a tradition from the cante jondo, or deep song, that is the well of expression in flamenco), the heavy songs. We will do the happy ones, like alegrias, and a jota (a folk dance) from northern Spain, the traditional malaguena, and Lisa (dancer Lisa Trujillo) comes out in a beautiful embroidered bullfighter's costume and does \"Granada.'\n\n\"We're going to be doing soleares, which is the mother of flamenco song.''\n\nHeredia will head a company of six. There will be no cantaor, or singer, this time.\n\n\"I'd like to bring in a flamenco singer, and I'm looking around for one in New York and Los Angeles, and when I have a venue that will permit that, I'll bring one in,'' he said.\n\nHeredia is something of a keeper of the flamenco flame in Denver, teaching both flamenco guitar and dance in his Washington Park studio. \"I've been linked to flamenco dance,'' he said, \"because I have four sisters who dance. I started off as a boy with my sisters, because they needed a male. Somehow I gravitated to the guitar, but in 1978 I started teaching dance also. I did that to do some exercise. My wife said, \"Why don't you get off your butt?' when I started gaining weight. The dancing burns off a lot of energy.''\n\nHe normally has about 25 dance students and 35 guitar students, teaching in Denver and Boulder.\n\n\"I have several students who've been with me for several years,'' he said. \"It takes at least three to five years before you're ready to do anything. The rhythms are difficult, and some of them are very old. It becomes all-encompassing.\n\n\"I notice that Michael Flatley (of \"Riverdance' and \"Lord of the Dance' fame) has incorporated a lot of fla menco dancing in his routine. Flatley likes the contrast between the 3/4 and 6/8 time signatures. Irish (dance) is 2/4 and 4/4. Flamenco dance, you have to incorporate the arms, upper and lower torso, plus how to manipulate the dress. It takes a lot of coordination.''\n\nJoining him will be lead dancers Jeanette Trujillo and Triceéa Bienvenida, whom Heredia nicknamed \"La Goulue'' after ToulouseLautrec's favorite model who, like Bienvenida, had flaming red hair.\n\nFlamenco puro, according to Heredia, is subject to being \"watered down'' and going in \"a very commercial direction.''\n\n\"The Colorado Dance Festival is presenting Flamenco Latino?'' Heredia said. \"What is this? There is no such thing, and to me, they'll be doing rumbas. It (flamenco) doesn't come from Latin America. That's why I'm trying to do the traditional gypsy flamenco. The new is fine, and everybody has to make a living. I was brought up traditional. I worked with Greco (senior), who was very show business, but when he did a farucca, it was a real farucca.\n\n\"Being Carmen Amaya's guitarist, that was very traditional. I'm trying to continue that on. I want people to see what real flamenco is like.''"
