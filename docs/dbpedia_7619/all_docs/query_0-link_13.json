This introduction provides background information on Spanish and Italian folk songs. It discusses the origins and characteristics of Spanish \"Flamenco\" songs, which developed from a fusion of Spanish and Romani (Gypsy) folk music traditions in Andalusia, Spain. These passionate and melancholy songs are typically performed by professional singers, often accompanied by guitar. While few Flamenco songs are cheerful in nature, their tragic tones and themes are seen as reflecting the mysterious origins and experiences of the Romani people in Spain. The introduction cautions that some Flamenco songs may be losing their original character as the genre gains wider popularity.",
