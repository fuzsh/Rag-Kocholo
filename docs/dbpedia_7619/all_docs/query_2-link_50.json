The idea seems to have gotten through,\n\nbut\n\ncoordination\n\nis\n\nlacking.\n\nFORWARD I have writen this book,\n\nwithout literary illusions, in an attempt to\n\n©\n\ncast a little light on the little-understood (and, more frequently, badly misunderstood) art of flamenco. To date flamenco has been the only internationally acclaimed art without so much as a basic English-language guide for its many enthusiasts. Little more is available in Spanish. This dearth of information has led to the general acceptance, both in and out of Spain, of a cheap commercial brand of flamenco only remotely similar to the authentic article. I have hopes that FLAMENCO will help correct this situation. FLAMENCO arranged itself into four sections. The first, entitled The Philosophy of Flamenco’’, consists of experiences and brief essays which are intended to help the reader to some sort of understanding of the creators and perpetuators of flamenco — the flamencos themselves. The next three sections get into the meat of the subject, and cover all but the most advanced or specialized facets of flamenco, on which I intend to elaborate in future works. Paris of the second section of FLAMENCO will seem painfully basic to the initiated aficionado, particularly portions of the section entitled ’’What is flamenco?’’ Bear in mind that the book is designed for readers ranging from the neophyte, who still vaguely knows flamenco as ’’flamingo’’, to the most advanced aficionado. Throughout this book the reader will find constant reference to two basic poles of flamenco, the classical-traditional and the popular-commercial. For clarity’s sake I shall briefly denote here the wide difference between these styles. Do not infer from the name classical-traditional a static, unchanging flamenco. On the contrary, it is everchanging. As in jazz, a top flamenco artist will never render an identical interpretation twice. The main difference between these opposite poles lies in the types of innovations and creations that make them up; those of the classical-traditional school always fall within certain well-defined bounds of good flamenco; those of the popular-commercial school are nearly always\n\ncatchy and worthless, eagerly accepted by the popular public, and then quickly forgotten. In other words, the classical-traditional flamenco has lasting value, the popular-commercial flamenco little to no value. Flamenco is often compared with jazz. This is logical and reasonable. We can go one step further and speculate on the types of flamenco that would closely approximate various trends in jazz. The primitive, traditional flamenco, for instance, could be matched with the Kid OryLouis Armstrong-Billie Holliday type of jazz; the complicated, less emotional concert flamenco (still in traditional taste) with the BrubeckModern Jazz Quartet progressive offerings; and the many commercial impurities of flamenco with types of jazz ranging from Be-Bop through big bands to Rock and Roll and its offshoots. The views of many authors have been taken into consideration (although not necessarily accepted) in arriving at various theories and historical conclusions in this book, some of whom are: José Carlos de Luna, Rafael la Fuente, Anselmo Gonzdlez Climent, Domingo Manfredi, Garcia Matos,\n\nNunez\n\nde Prado,\n\nJuan\n\nde la Plata,\n\nMedina\n\nAzara,\n\nAndrade de Silva, Fernando el de Triana, and Caballero Bonald. I express my gratitude to my wife, and to good friends John and Ann Leibold, who have given me valuable aid in the preparation of this book. Sevilla, July 1962.\n\n10\n\nPART\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHY\n\nI\n\nOF FLAMENCO\n\nINTRODUCTION Flamenco is not just a music of southern Spain, as is generally believed. More than that, it is a way of life that influences the daily activities of the southern Spaniard.\n\nOne does not have to be a performer\n\nof flamenco to be a flamenco: a flamenco is anyone who is emotionally and actively involved book\n\nin this unique\n\nphilosophy.\n\nFor this reason,\n\nis complete in dealing with the art of flamenco\n\nno\n\nalone, for the art\n\nof flamenco is merely the outward expression of the flamenco way of life. The reader must also be made to understand something of its creators\n\nand\n\nliefs, kes flamenco\n\nWith\n\nperpetuators,\n\nand\n\nand dislikes. is, but why\n\ntheir philosophies,\n\nIt is necessary\n\nattitudes,\n\nto understand\n\ncustoms,\n\nbe-\n\nnot only what\n\nit is what it is.\n\nthis objective in mind,\n\nI present\n\nand essays as an introduction to a study\n\nthe following experiences\n\nof this fascinating but little\n\nunderstood art.\n\n13\n\nDONKEY\n\nBACK\n\nWe were riding donkey back along the ridge of the Sierra, often rounding into views of a deep-blue Mediterranean, other times descending into\n\ngray-green\n\nvalleys\n\nor winding\n\nour way\n\nthrough\n\nscented\n\npine\n\nforests. It was slow going, but delicious and invigorating, making us glad to have broken away from the contained life of Sevilla. The morning of the third day we cut inland into the sparsely-populated mountain country between Ronda and the sea, an area famous for its rugged beauty and its bandit and smuggler bands of the past. As the day waned, we came upon a small ranch, from the doorway of which a white-haired old man stood observing us. *’ Buenas tardes.”’ Buenas tardes.”’ ”Can I serve you in some way?’’, he questioned, looking us over critically, his eyes softening a little as they took note of our two spare donkeys loaded down with provisions and belongings. ”We seek nothing, old one, but the honor of having you join us in a cup of good Valdepefias tinto’’, my friend answered with Spanish formality, patting one of the large leather wine skins carried by one of the donkeys. Con mucho gusto. With much pleasure’’, he replied. ’’Do one of you play the guitar?’’, he asked, nodding at the donkey that was carrying the guitar. “I do’, I said, ’’and my partner is an illustrious gypsy cantaor, famed in all of Andalucia.”’ The old man’s interest quickened, although he asked doubtfully “And you, being a foreigner, know well the flamenco?’’. ”Of course, old one. My mother is Spanish, and I have lived in Spain many years.”’ This was my time-tested answer which puts all wrongs right. The wine flowed, and soon the old man’s family returned from tending the sheep and goats and joined us. They sent for the one neighboring family, and amid singing, playing, animated conversation, and a dinner of 15\n\ngarbanzos\n\nand lamb\n\nmeat,\n\nwe\n\nbecame\n\ngood\n\nfriends.\n\nDuring the course\n\nof the evening the old man told us of a small livestock fair that was to take place in a mountain village two days distant by donkey. He was leaving for it the following day with his sheep and goats, and he invited\n\nus to join him, explaining that it was customary for the fair to be highlighted by a gypsy wedding, or weddings, depending on this year’s crop of young lovers, followed by days of celebration. Gypsies traveled to this fair from considerable distance and, the old man explained, the festivities would certainly be worth the trip. He thought that we should have no trouble there, my friend being gypsy, and both of us flamencos, an unbeatable combination of door-openers for such an occasion. It sounded like a fine idea, and with a click of earthenware mugs we toasted the trip. At dawn we rounded up the old man’s flock and headed North. We passed through untamed mountain country spotted with cave openings, swooping hawks, and an occasional wild boar. It felt good to ride alongside the tinkling animals, feeling the hot sun on our backs and listening to the talk of the garrulous old man. Bien, apprentice sheep herders. I hope you'll forgive me if I talk too much. We rarely have visitors in these parts, and I get lonesome for someone new to exchange impressions with.’’ How many years have you lived in these mountains, old one’’, I asked. ”’T was born in the village where we are headed around 1890 — I’m not sure what year — and except for a few trips to Ronda, I’ve never been away from here.”’ ”Ozi’’, exclaimed the gypsy, ’’many years! Then you must have seen a few bandits in your time?’’ “Si, many of these caves hereabouts were hideaways for them. The bandits were like everyone else, some good and some bad. It was always necessary to watch one’s women, and to carry a gun when tending the animals, but generally they would leave us poor people alone. They used to make raids on the rich folks in some of the bigger towns, or on the stages on the Ronda road, and then come down here to hide. Fortunately they usually had money and women with them. It became more dangerous when the Guardia started to clamp down, as they could not raid successfully and they had to come to us for food and wine. I remember when they got drunk they would sometimes have knife fights to the death over a woman, or an insult, or merely for the desire to 16\n\nfight. They were dangerous people, but basically like everyone; some good and some bad. And cofio!, que flamencos.”’ When conversation fell off, the gypsy would improvise cantes, usually humorous, about the animals, making the old man glow with warmth. He was truly an animal lover, treating the animals as humans, recognizing their needs and moods through long years of looking after them. Ay que burro, que bueno es\n\nA ese burro de punta, tanto le gustan las borriquillas... Ay what a donkey, how good he is That one leading the line, who is so crazy about girl donkeys... “I’ve\n\nnever\n\nheard\n\nthat one\n\nbefore’’,\n\nsaid the old man,\n\nlaughing.\n\n“OF course not. I just made it up. At least part of it’’, the gypsy replied, pleased with his creative success. “Oye, Tumba’, I said, calling the gypsy by his nickname, ’’tell me, what is so extraordinary about a gypsy wedding? Does it differ so much from a payo (non-gypsy) one?’’ “Caray, is it different! A gypsy wedding is the most exciting thing you'll ever see. And what a celebration afterwards! They’re the only people in the world who know how to marry properly. It begins with the novio (fiancé) and his friends ‘kidnapping’ the novia, usually with her consent, and carrying her off to the house of his parents: Then emissaries are sent to contact the girl’s parents, to obtain their consent. If it is given, the date is set, and all of the relatives and friends of both\n\nfamilies converge on the chosen spot, abandoning all of their pursuits for at least three days, the minimum length of a respectful celebration. Often several marriages are arranged for the same time and place, with the resultant celebration being something barbarous.’’ The gypsy’s eyes shown with enthusiasm, obviously remembering distant pleasures. ’’ The test of the girl’s virtue is in effect the marriage ceremony; the white silk handkerchief is inserted, and if it becomes stained with the blood of the girl, the ritual of celebration begins. The girl is covered with a deluge of flowers from all directions, and then the ceremony of the adoration of the bride is effected by the parents of the couple falling on their knees around the: girl and dancing a dance of the upper torso and arms. The bride and bridegroom are then taken into the bedroom and 7\n\nthe Alboreds (1) are sung. They are truly fine and gay. This is later followed by the bride performing a marriage dance in the middle of a circle of gypsies, who heap upon her showers of almond blossoms. This is usually the last of the rituals, and from then on it is every man for himself until he is too exhausted to continue celebrating.’’ We were climbing continually into a green splendor of cascading streams and snow white clouds. There had been a heavy rainfall that spring, which had caused the slopes to blossom with a rash of wild flowers and small animal life. Far below us to the west a little white village nestled in a valley, its houses like mushrooms against the green valley floor. The air felt fresh and clean. *’Dios, qué bonito!’’, breathed the old man. ’’I’ve lived here 70 years and have never gotten over the beauty of spring in this Sierra. Wait until you see the village where we go. It is out of a fairy tale. It has no roads, and is only accessible to donkey caravans and with great difficulty donkey carts. There are only cobblestones and flowers and wild grass for streets, the houses have red-tile roofs and are newly white-washed every year, there are plants and flowers in every window and balcony, and there is a man dedicated solely to picking up the litter in the village. And there is a beautiful clear stream that runs along the eastern edge, lined with willows and poplars.” That night we camped on a level spot on the side of a steep, pinesprinkled slope. A nearby stream swirled downhill, mixing its persistent gurgling with the crackling of our fire. We were content and above worldly preoccupations. The old man made us a steaming-hot mountain\n\ndrink,\n\na real\n\nquitapenas,\n\nconsisting\n\nof red\n\nwine,\n\ncognac,\n\nlemon,\n\nand a little sugar. Two other donkey caravans had joined us, spotting us from across the narrow valley, and an interesting discussion was launched concerning the gypsies and their niche in life. Some (arguing in the Spanish way, not necessarily out of conviction but out of the desire to prolong the discussion) argued that the gypsies are a ’’blot’’ on society, while others maintained that the gypsies led the only plausible way of life (referring to the true gypsies as yet untainted by modern civilization). \"That they have no ambition, that they refuse to work?!! And you consider these failings? Hombre, don’t you realize that this ’’ambi(t)\n\nSee\n\nAlboreds\n\nin\n\ndescription of this ceremony. 18\n\nthe\n\nPart\n\nIII\n\nEncyclopedia\n\nfor\n\na\n\nmore\n\ncomplete\n\ntion’’ that you praise is the greatest motivating evil the world has known. One must have principles or ambition, as these two forces are instinctive enemies and are constantly at each others throats, Woe on the man who has both, for he will have a raging turmoil inside his person. For ambition, in the modern sense of the word, is the desire to *get ahead,’ and it is a rare man who can ’get ahead’ without sacrificing his integrity and his principles. And this other thing that you consider a fault: the refusal to work in some hated job that the payo takes merely to make money, or gain prestige, or ’get ahead’, or what have you. This rejection of work is the greatest of gypsy virtues! We refuse to prostitute our integrity in this way. We prefer to obey our natural instincts, although we may suffer more and work harder in obeying them than we would taking a soft payo job and wasting away our lives. Besides, who has the superior intelligence ; he who works unhappily within the System,\n\nor he who pursues his own interests and remains above the\n\nSystem?’’ This speaker was a dark-skinned young gypsy with considerable reputation as a poet. “Claro estd’’, spoke up an obviously respected old man, the leader of one of the newly-arrived caravans who gave the impression of being some sort of tribal wise man or witch doctor, ’’it is clear that the gypsies have outlived their age. God meant for us to live off of the fat of the land, moving from place to place feeding on wild fruits and fowl and abundant animal life, never abusing as the payo does, never depleting our sources like fools, never causing the extinction of entire species of animals, never exploiting, but merely taking what we needed. But now, through a complex puzzle of cause and effect not even understood by the payo himself, all of the lands have fences, the fruits and domestic animals owners, and the wild life is disappearing because of its exploitation by the so-called ‘civilized’ people. The gypsies should have been cut up for steaks along with the rest of the wild life, because we no longer belong. If we wish to follow our natural instincts, to pursue our way\n\nof life, to retain our integrity,\n\nwe have no other recourse but\n\nto steal our daily food and to camp on payo does not understand that we are that they are merely slaves to a system significance, Their instincts are moved momentarily realize the purposelessness beset by envy and longing. But instead us. We have always been.a threat to\n\nthe property of others. The fool the last of God’s children, and which reduces their lives to inwhen we come into sight, they of their existence, and they are of joining us, they chose to hate their serenity, we have always 19\n\nmade\n\nthem see the absurdity of their lives, and they have chosen to\n\ndrive us away, to banish us from their lands and their minds as one will\n\nbanish a wrong from his conscience.’’ The snow-white hair and nearly black face of the speaker gave him a primitive appearance in the firelight sharply belied by his words. ’’We are the symbol of everything that they lack; integrity, individualism, freedom. They cannot permit the gypsy to be the constant reminder of the ball-less void of their lives, so they\n\nhave\n\nhumiliated\n\nus,\n\nattempted\n\nto break\n\nour spirit,\n\nbanished\n\nus\n\nto city slums... they have truly sinned by denying God’s children their intended existence.”’ ”One has but to think of the impertinence of the payo’’, said our old man, ’’They ‘discover’ lands that have been inhabited for thousands of years by several civilizations, and they proudly plant their flag and claim the land for their country. Not a thought is given to its present inhabitants, unless the ‘discoverers’ try to soothe their consciences during their plundering, murdering, and exploitation by deceiving themselves and the world into believing that they are committing their crimes in the names of Religion, the State, and Progress.’’ You are right, viejo’, the poet replied vengefully. ’’It is that mankind is consumed with greed, lust, and a doltish possessiveness. Why can they not leave the lands free, as God intended? How do they have the impudence to place a price on God’s real estate? To me, all of civilization paints a bile-retching picture of the strong abusing the weak. Ambition, egoism, and violent stupidity invariably are triumphant over integrity, principles, and goodness!’’ Christ, I thought, can these be the ignorant, immoral gypsies that my Spanish friends and acquaintances are constantly belittling. Gypsy reasoning may be innocent and impractically honest, but next to these people my cunning friends have little to feel superior about. The gypsies talked on, of the trials of their lives, their difficulties and disappointments, and as they talked, they became more and more depressed. Their depression became profound and directionless and morbid, almost like an orgy of despondency. They sank into the black and bottomless, but one could sense that, like all depressives, they were spurred on by a certain unconscious pleasure in their very suffering. Talking was no longer enough. Their expression, as always at such times, turned to poetry and song. I began playing a slow, melancholy Siguiriyas, and the poet stood up by the fire and dramatically recited 20\n\none of Lorca’s cante jondo poems, describing a cantaora singing to a dancer robed in long, black trains of silk, symbol of death. Ldmparas de cristal y espejos verdes. Sobre el tablado oscuro la Parrala sostiene una conversacion con la muerte. La llama,\n\nno viene, y la vuelve a llamar. Las gentes\n\naspiran los sollozos. Y en los espejos verdes largas colas de seda sé mueven. Crystal lamps and green mirrors.\n\nUpon a dark platform la Parrala sustains @ conversation with death. She calls, death does not come,\n\nand she calls again. The people ave enveloped by her sobs. In the green mirrors\n\nlong trains of silk move. Desolate cantes eallgwed) each further fomenting the dejection of the impressionable gypsies. Moments such as these incite the jondo in men, and the miracle of the duende occurs; for the duende is the exposure of one’s soul, its misery and suffering, love and hate, offered\n\nwithout embarrassment or resentment. It is a cry of despair, a release of tortured emotions, to be found in its true profundity only in real life situations, not in the make-believe world of theatres and night clubs 21\n\nand commercial caves as a product that can be bought and sold and produced at will. A moving Soled by a wild-eyed gypsy from Jerez: Por ti abandoné a mis ninas, mi mare de penita murid; ahora\n\nte vas y me\n\nabandonas,\n\njno tienes perdén de Did! For my and may\n\nyou I abandoned my little girls, mother died of sorrow; now you abandon me... you be eternally damned!\n\nA chilling Fandangos de Triana by Tumba: Una mujer se moria sus hijos la rvodeaban y el mds chico la decia Mama\n\nmirame a la cara\n\nno te mueras todavia... A woman was dying her children surrounded\n\nher\n\nand the smallest said to her Mama look at my face don’t die yet... A forlorn Playera of a loved one lost: Detrés del carrito\n\nlloraba mi madre: no llovaba agiiita, que lloraba sangre. Behind the funeral cart sobbed my mother: she didn’t weep tears, she wept blood. As the gypsies sang, the campfire caused fleeting visions, now flickering on a rock, now on a tree, of the black-robed, dancing figure of death reigning over her terrible domain: the tragedies of unfortunate love ; a dying mother surrounded by her horrified children; the cart of 22\n\nthe dead rumbling its burden to the grave, a stricken mother stumbling blindly behind... The singing carried long into the night on the side of that lonely mountain, far from civilization, and finally an indescribable feeling surged to the surface; the moment arrived when mature men could weep cold, grim tears, lamenting the twisted fate of their lives, their race, and all mankind.\n\nThe village was as the old man had described. It smelled of grass and flowers and animals, and it exuded an enchanted feeling of the past, before there were machines\n\nor fallout, when the stars were still a\n\nmystery and the moon romantic, and when each region of the world had its own personality. People were arriving by horse, mule, and donkey back, many with their flocks of animals to be sold or bartered, others solely to participate in the wedding celebrations. The old man, Tumba, and myself, together with our new friends of the previous evening, set up camp in a select grove bordering the tushing stream. We noticed that it was ideal for flamenco, having a level clearing in the middle of the grove. We hung the still brimming wine skins on trees, dug a barbeque pit and set up a spit, put the animals to graze, and settled back to watch the activity. Everyone was in the state of fine spirits always caused by the anticipation of a good time. The few gypsies with horses were prancing about with their women balancing effortlessly on the rumps of the horses. Others were in groups talking animatedly, and still others, like ourselves, were resting up for the big blast. There were going to be no less than three weddings, and the competition between the celebrants was expected to be fierce. Who could have a better time longer, drink more, sleep less!? Our camp was unexcelled for popularity. We had much to offer: two skins full of good tinto, an outstanding singer, renowned gypsy intellectuals, and phenomenon of phenomenons, a ’’guitarrista Americano’’. The old man, as was his yearly custom, had singled out two of his best sheep for roasting, and everyone was invited to partake of the sizzling, smoke-flavoured meat. This was, as he explained, his once-ayear fling, and there wouldn’t be many more. He was having an absolutely: delightful time, half-tight at all hours, and rollickingly gay. Most 23\n\nof the celebrants were old friends of his, and with each he insisted on\n\nsharing remembrance cups of wine and of showing off his flamenco\n\nfriends. ”Anda, primos, the Bulerias’’, he would urge, and when we started off he would jump into the clearing and begin dancing. When tight the old man was a natural comedian, and he would have all of us roaring with laughter. Hearing the jaleo, other people would run up, and the old man always managed to select as his dancing partner the prettiest gitana in the crowd, whom he would set about ’’winning’’ with more antics. Then Tumba, with a wink, would dance in and sing to the gitana, pretending to woo her away from the old man, who would respond with sham indignation and stage a mock battle with Tumba; all in perfect time to this difficult rhythm. The gypsy girl, entering into the spirit of the dance, would flirt unabashedly with them both, and then, with a flip of her head and a saucy turn of her body, leave them and dance back to her boyfriend. Other gypsies would soon be dancing and singing and playing their guitars, competing, outdoing each other, and the mountain seemed to vibrate with joy. The Bulerias, the Alboreds, the Rumba Gitana, the Tientos Canasteros, the Chuflas, all of the merty cantes and bailes were sung and danced. The weddings took place in the manner that Tumba had described, and for four days the celebrating continued; four days of laughing, loving, love-making, the gypsies driving themselves to a wild frenzy, tearing at their clothes, but always good-humored and staying within certain gypsy limits and laws regardless of their delirious drunkenness. The whole village took part in the celebrations. Small children and old women danced gaily in the streets, old men sang with cracked voices, and gnarled working hands played antique guitars. Wine could not be purchased. It was everywhere, and it was free. The simple village houses were open to all. Romance was natural and without complications, and strangely innocent and clean. Pacts were made, promises were whispered, only to be forgotten with the next day’s adventures. For four days and nights our campsite played host to the composite caprices of wine, love, flamenco, and gaiety. On the fifth day it happened. No one knows quite how or why. A flash of knives in the village bar, and a gypsy, unknown to us, fell with his heart punctured. The celebration died with him; the craziness filtered away and left the bedraggled remains of four tumultuous days and nights. The knifed man was buried further down the mountain, and the a“\n\nwailing of a gypsy song of mourning carried eerily to our campsite. A weariness and depression settled over the village like a dense fog as the voice from downstream, raucous and miserable, sang of death, hopelessness, the futility of life:\n\nCon las fatiguitas de la muerte a un laito yo me\n\narrimo;\n\ncon mi arma destrozd sufvo mi sino... With the weariness of death I creep to one side; with a soul void of hope I suffer my destiny... After a time the voice stopped, away before an overpowering fatigue Senses were numb and minds blank gypsies fell to the ground, exhausted. ing had finally ended.\n\nand the oppression began melting that could no longer be ignored. with tiredness as the tempestuous The celebrations and the mourn-\n\nAcross the clearing village lamps blinked out one by one, and an occasional dog challenged the infringing darkness. Small night sounds crept stealthily about as the campfires flickered low, and the gypsies succumbed to a deep, unmoving sleep.\n\n25\n\nJUERGA The juerga (flamenco session) began at my place at about 10 p, m. I have an ideal set-up in the Barrio Santa Cruz, the picturesque old\n\nJewish quarter in Sevilla where summertime flamenco can be heard\n\nissuing from surrounding plazas. Of course, outdoor juergas are against the law now, but they go on just the same, reminding the old-timers nostalgically of the gay, wide-open Sevilla of thirty years ago. *’Leche’’, they confide, ’’how you would have enjoyed Sevilla in those days. Down by the Siete Pwertas (1) every building had a bar, and every bar flamencos. Sevilla had the reputation of being the gaiest town in Spain. It was a kind of tonic — people came from all over Spain to escape their lives and problems in the activity of Sevilla. Now they prohibit singing, dancing, and even the guitar in the bars. It is truly a changed, sad city.”’ But this particular jwerga was anything but sad. It was one of the many that we have at my place, which are the scandals of the neighborhood. Inappropriately, that romantic tangle of old crooked passages and hidden gardens is inhabited by traditional families with their noses to the social grindstone. They greatly disapprove of gypsies and flamencos in the neighborhood, and moreso of people who entertain them. The jwerga was one of the good, serious ones. The artists and the audience\n\nwere\n\nfew,\n\nand\n\ncarefully\n\nchosen\n\nfor\n\ntheir\n\nability,\n\nknowledge,\n\nand compatibility. There were two cantaores, a bailaora, and a guitarist, four of Spain’s non-commercial best, and five listeners, all devout aficionados, We started out with good Jerez wine, olives, fried fish, chorizo, and conversation, encouraging the old-timers to reminisce about legendary flamencos, and the merits of contemporary ones. They would illustrate their points by singing, or playing, passages of former greats, often comparing them with present styles. (1) and which 26\n\nThe Siete Puertas (Seven Doors) is a bar which still exists in Sevilla, used to be the center of Sevilla’s flamenco life.\n\nA discussion of two of flamenco’s legendary cantaoves arose, and one of the singers, Juan Talegas, expounded an interesting comparison: ” Antonio Chacén, of course, was a far superior singer, but Manuel\n\nTorre, when in the mood, era tinico (was in a class by himself). His\n\ncante struck straight at the heart in a manner that was unbelievable. Chacon, also, was capable of evoking great emotion, but Torre had a duende that only one in a million possesses. The trouble with Torre was that unless he was moved he could not sing at all, while Chacon always sang beautifully.”’ Then Juan, who had been a personal friend of both, demonstrated the differences in their styles and approaches to the Cante in a manner that would be invaluable in a good anthology. As’ the wine took effect faces became illuminated and gaiety paramount, and cantes por Bulerias irrepressibly bubbled forth, intermixed with a maze of gypsy guitar falsetas (passages) and an occasional dance. The jwerga was soon in full swing, and the music and dance flowed, seriously or lightly as moods changed, into the early hours of the morning. How dawn arrived so quickly no one could explain, except that in a good juerga hours seem to pass as minutes. Finally we became restless, and the juerga began developing into good-natured hell-raising. We decided to go out to a neighboring village, a famous outpost of flamenco, for coffee and aguardiente. and whatever adventures might arise. Upon arriving we installed ourselves in a local taberna, and before long were joined by the cement factory workers who began dropping in for their early-morning copitas (eye-openers). (By the time they had both eyes open they had decided that work could wait, and they joined in). And the juerga carried on, and grew, and grew; we soon outgrew the little taberna, and spilled up the street to a larger, more central café where we were joined by still more of the local flamencos. The town was up and about by now, which added colour to the festivities. Groups of chiquillas hazarded by to the accompaniment of devastating flattery (so we thought) and irresistible flamenco. We were the shameless recipients of dagger-like stares thrown by indignant, Massbound women in black. The old fellow from the hardware store down the block closed shop and joined us. A few bankers, lawyers, and doctors embarrassedly skittered in, supposedly out on business calls. The festivities became such that even the eternal domino game broke up 27\n\nwhen an apprentice bartender leaped on the table and danced until he went tumbling, table and all. The proceedings were becoming a bit scandalous, a local guardia pointed out, in view of which one of the more enthusiastic aficionados, a local bull breeder, prudently suggested we move out to his finca (ranch); we did, en masse. By this time the jwerga was developing into a town fiesta, and we were joined by many of the village adventurous. In the corral of the finca the breeder broke out one of his utreros (young fighting bulls), which proceeded to inflict minor injuries on wine-reckless aficionados. After a few such one-sided encounters, the town hopeful finally jumped in and showed us how to fight, passing the bull time and again with serious naturales and Manoletinas to thunderous shouts of ’’olé’’! ” Another Manolete’’, his admirers claimed. ”’Veremos. We'll see’’, replied tough old-timers, who had too often seen young flashes wither away. Finally the boy turned his back on the bull and stalked to the corral wall, displaying by his coolness his complete dominance of the bull. His followers could contain themselves no longer; up on their shoulders he went, to be paraded about the finca in heroic confusion. By now countless local aficionados were dancing and singing in large groups about the patio, and the din of boisterous singing, laughing, and shouting began to make our heads throb. During the proceedings some gypsy girls chanced along, and one of the singers proposed that a group of us escape to the tranquility of his place in Alcala. He is a very fine singer, but one of the non-commercial, non-prosperous breed, and his ’’place’’ is a rather romantic cave cut into a hillside overlooking the river Guadaira, just below the ruins of an old Roman castle. Who could resist the idea. On arriving we lounged about at the entrance to the cave, sipping fino and feeling mellow and somehow exalted after our night of juerga. Below us women washed clothes in the river, and nude children played blissfully in the high grass along the edge. A donkey stood picketed nearby, watching us with ancient eyes as God must watch fools in their folly. I began stroking the guitar softly, lazily, and the girls sang romantic verses in low, caressing, gypsy voices... La luna es un pozo chico, las flores no valen nada, 28\n\nlo que valen son tus brazos cuando\n\nde noche\n\nThe moon\n\nme\n\nabrazan...\n\nis a little well,\n\nflowers are worth nothing; what is of value are your arms when at night they embrace me... As the music blended with faraway sounds, an overwhelming sense of peace pervaded the group. For the moment we were all brothers, differences forgotten, prejudices dissolved... Across the river distant olive groves simmered in the afternoon sun, and time, and the jwerga, droned contentedly on...\n\nFLAMENCO\n\nAND\n\nTHE\n\nBULLFIGHT\n\nFlamenco and the Fiesta (spectacle of bullfighting) are deeply related. This connection is undeniable, and vital for an understanding of either. Both stem basically from the common people, and they stir the same basic emotions and passions. Both are given flashes of erratic genius by gypsies, and a sense of indomitable steadiness and responsibility by the Andalucians. And they have in common another important factor: they are the two most probable ways that the commoner can break out of his social and economic level. This\n\nrelationship\n\nhas been\n\ndealt with often,\n\nbut is still little under-\n\nstood. The guitarist Sabicas has tried to capture it on his record ’’Day of the Bullfight’’. The poet Garcia Lorca wrote inseparably of flamenco and the bulls. Gonzalez Climent dedicated an entire book to the psychological and physical ties between the flamenco dance and song, and the Fiesta. My brief contribution follows, spiced with the fabulous poetry of Garcia Lorca:\n\nLate in the afternoon cingly\n\nagainst\n\nthe\n\non bullfight\n\nirregular\n\ngeometry\n\ndays\n\nthe sun\n\nof Andalucian\n\nslants menavillages,\n\nil-\n\nluminating the stark-whiteness of humble houses crowding haphazardly about churches,\n\nMoorish\n\nruins, and,\n\nsymbols\n\nof Andalucia,\n\nbull rings.\n\nOn\n\nthese\n\ndays\n\nthe\n\nair is charged\n\nwith\n\nexcitement,\n\nanxiety,\n\nfear... and a source-less undercurrent of a flamenco guitar, sound-\n\ning at first slowly, and raspier sand...\n\nand\n\nclearly, profoundly,\n\ncruel\n\nas the blood\n\nand\n\nof man\n\nthen growing or beast\n\nA las cinco de la tarde.

It was five sharp in the afternoon. A small boy brought the white sheet at five in the afternoon. A basket of lime was already prepared at five in the afternoon. Everything else was death, and only death, at five in the afternoon. I can’t stand to see it! Tell night to fall; I don’t want to see the blood of Ignacio on the sand. The eternal guitar plays on, and its duende seeps into atficionados, the walls, the wine, everywhere, and makes the village vibrant and explosive. It does not subside until long after the bull-\n\nfight and the inevitable juergas, and even then never completely disappears. For this guitar is the soul of flamenco, the soul of bullfighting... the timeless essence of Andalucia. Empieza el lanto de la guitarra. Se rompen las copas de la madrugada.

The Spanish form has been guarded as closely as possible in the translations, although it was often necessary to translate the verses more or less freely in order to avoid clouding their meaning. The rhyming of the verses had to be sacrificed entirely. These verses, ingenious in their phrasing and symbolism in Spanish, lose somewhat in translation. A considerable knowledge of Andalucia and its philosophy is necessary in order to capture the true fragrance of their meaning. I have attempted to give something of this knowledge during the course of the book, and have explained in the Encyclopedia those verses that are probably the least meaningful to the non-Spaniard. A brief general explanation follows which is intended to further crystallize the meaning of these verses. The verses of the Cante are derived from two sources: the poet who creates them and passes them on to the people through a published work (and which are often altered to fit the personality of each interpreter) ; and those springing from the people themselves, created during inspired moments by cantaores and aficionados. The verses of the professional poet, usually a profound expression of the feelings of the people, are nearly always more grammatically correct than those created by the people. To my knowledge, the only poets who have had their verses widely accepted have been Andalucians. Perhaps the most flamenco and colorful verses are those of the gypsies, which are distinguished by their picturesquely incorrect grammatical\n\nstructure,\n\nand spelling, their tenderness, and their vivid surrealism.\n\nword\n\nchoice,\n\nWhat has seemed to excite the most verses, regardless of their sour-\n\nce, is the indignation and sorrow caused by being deceived in love, the ingratitude and falsity of humanity, and (never-forgotten) death. Many verses also deal with religion (pro for the philosophy, con for the bureaucracy), an unjust society controlled by the rich and the strong, admiration for those who rebel against this society (smugglers, bandits, etc.), and love in general. Often a verse will express a deep sorrow in a more 97\n\nor less humorous way; the southern Spaniard makes fun of everything\n\nexcept God and mother, including death, a result of his inbred resigna-\n\ntion and skepticism. The verses are not sung exactly as they appear on the printed page. Lines are often repeated, words prolonged, long wails of aaay interjected (x). When actually heard and seen interpreted, the verses are infinitely more meaningful. That is another adventure that awaits the aficionado!\n\n(1)\n\nTake\n\nthe example\n\nof this Siguiriya\n\nof the legendary\n\nManuel\n\nSon tan grandes mis penas que no caben mds. Yo muero loco, sin calé de nadie,\n\nMy suffering is so great I can bear no more.

The chart only attempts to trace the basic origins of these components, along with a few of the more important secondary influences. If all of the subtle crosscurrents were charted, the result would be an incoherent muddle. It will suffice keeping in mind that the Andalucian influence, especially the gypsy, is strong in all of these components as we know them today, regardless of their origins. There has been much agitated guesswork as to which cantes were actually conceived by the gypsies. Only four have been irrefutably established as pure gypsy creations: the Martinetes, Rods, Alboreds, and the Zambra. Other than these, the cantes with perhaps the strongest gypsy influence have been the cantes grandes, particularly the Playeras, Siguiriyas, Deblas, Soleares...

The word “’alboreds’’ is an abbreviation of ’’alboreadas’’, meaning dawning; dawn of the day’’, which has led some theoreticians to believe that the Alboreds are merely songs sung at dawn. In reality, the Alboreds are a gypsy wedding cante, believed by the gypsies to give bad luck if sung at other than the celebration of a wedding. The word “alboreadas’’ can also be construed to mean ’’a happening at dawn’’, which is the time the Alboreds are often sung to the newly-weds, and which could explain their connection with dawn. More romantically, it could also signify the ’’dawning of a new life’ for the couple. The Alboreds are usually done to the compds of the Bulerias. En un verde prado tendi mi panuelo. Salieron tres rosas como tres luceyos. Padrinito honrao @ tu hija ya la han coronao.\n\nIn a green pasture I stretched out my handkerchief. Three roses appeared like three morning stars. Righteous father, they have crowned your daughter.\n\nAy,\n\nAy,\n\nnovio,\n\nmirala\n\nbien\n\nque hasta bonitos tiene los pies,\n\nbridegroom,\n\nlook\n\nwell\n\nat her,\n\nshe is pretty to the tips of her toes.\n\nThe above verses refer to a gypsy ceremony testing the virtue of the bride-to-be. If this ’’virtue test’’ is successfully passed, it is in effect the wedding ceremony. The mother of the bride-to-be, and the parents of the bridegroom-to-be, deliver the nuptial handkerchief to an old woman who presides at this ceremony. The old woman takes the girl aside and inserts the handkerchief into her, deftly rupturing the girl’s virginity, if existent. If the handkerchief is withdrawn spotted with blood, the wedding is consecrated, and a two or three day celebration ensues,\n\nIf the handkerchief\n\nis withdrawn\n\nwith no trace of blood,\n\nany-\n\nthing might happen, including a pitched battle between the families and their supporters. One thing is certain; the wedding rarely takes place. But considering that gypsy girls marry at the tender age of fourteen (or less), the ceremony has all of the probabilities of turning out well. If so, further rituals are performed (described in Donkey Back, Part I), culminated by the singing of the Alboreds to the newly-weds. Of course,\n\nmore\n\nand\n\nmore\n\ngypsies are adopting payo\n\ncustoms,\n\nin-\n\ncluding the church wedding ceremony. Only a few gypsy bands still tenaciously cling to their antique customs and rituals in this age when all remnants of regional colour are fast giving way to a fanatical drive 403\n\nto make three billion people look, act, and talk alike in a dull, universal togetherness. ALEGRIAS.—Cante chico, baile intermedio, toque chico. The Alegrias, developed in CAdiz, were conceived from the ancient Soleares ; their rhythmical count and accentuation are identical, although the Alegrias are faster, and their chord structure stresses the gay major chords rather than the more melancholy minor chords of the Soleares. The cante and the toque of the Alegrias are lively and vivacious (Alegrias translates ’’gaiety’’). The baile has developed along slightly more jondo lines. As a popular Tientos Canasteros verse states, one should go to the Barrio Santa Maria (gypsy quarter) in Cadiz to see the Alegrias performed, in the little taverns and often in the streets themselves, with their true flavour. Various cantes have been inspired by the Alegrias, such as the Bulerias, Romeras, Mirabrés, Cantinas, Caracoles, and Rosas. The Alegrias, one of the more difficult elements of the chico category, are also one of the two or three most popular. Aunque\n\nme ponga en tu puerta\n\ncanones\n\nde\n\nartilleria,\n\nEven if they put in your door-way artillery\n\ncannons,\n\ntengo que pasar por ella aunque me cueste la via.\n\nI would attempt to enter although it cost me my life.\n\nSe han puesto en balanza\n\nTwo hearts\n\ndos\n\nare\n\ncorazones\n\na un\n\ntiempo;\n\nbeing\n\nweighed\n\non a\n\nuno pidiendo justicia, otro pidiendo — venganza.\n\none asking justice, the other — vengeance.\n\nCuando te vengas conmigo éque addnde te voy a llevar? Que a darte un paseito por la muralla real.\n\nWhen where For a along\n\nscale;\n\nyou come with me am I going to take you? little walk the great sea-wall (in Cédiz).\n\nBAMBERAS.—Cante chico, neither danced nor played. In many towns of Andalucia their still exists a curious medieval tradition of erecting huge swings every spring and summer, as a sort of fair weather sport celebrating the crop harvests. Each neighborhood in the town has its swing, and there are competitions to see who can swing the highest. The swingers are usually full-skirted girls, aided by people on the ground with ropes attached to the swing. In rhythm to the swinging, the spectators sing Bamberas, which are similar to the FandanguiHos and the cantes camperos (Trilleras, Nanas), while peeking at the 104\n\ngirls’legs. name\n\nIt is claimed that the Bamberas\n\nis derived from the word\n\n’’bamba’’,\n\nare of Celtic origin. Their the local name for \"swing’’.\n\nEres chiquita y bonita, eres como yo te quiero, eves una campanita en las manos de un platero...\n\nYou are petite and pretty, like I want you, a little bell in the hands of a silversmith...\n\nLa no mi mi\n\nThe has nor nor\n\nnitta que esté en la bamba tiene padre, ni madre, novio que vaya a verla, perrito que la ladre...\n\nBULERIAS.—Cante,\n\nbaile,\n\nand\n\ntoque\n\ngirl that is swinging neither father nor mother, boy friend that goes to see her, even a little dog to bark at her... chico.\n\nThe Bulerias are a gaier, wilder, faster version of the family Alegrias — Jaleos — Soleares, maintaining the same rhythmical count, although their accentuation is far more complex. Both major and/or minor chord structures are employed. It is said that the gypsies of Jerez de la Frontera mistakenly misperformed the Alegrias over a period of time, with the resultant development of the Bulerias. Although the Bulerias were apparently performed first as a slow dance, they are now the liveliest component of all flamenco, often performed in a humorous vein. The name ’’bulerias’’ was derived from the word ’’burlerias’’ (to make fun of). The Bulerias are the overwhelming favorite of the flamencos on festive occasions (the Bulerias are also called ’’Fiestas’’), being particularly suited to the gypsies. They are probably the most technically intricate and difficult flamenco form for the guitarist. There are many styles of Bulerias, the most frequently heard being those of Sevilla, Triana, Alcala, Jerez, Puerto Real, Puerto Santa Matia, and\n\nCéadiz.\n\nThe following are typical gypsy verses: Tengo en mi casa un jardin por si viene un contra tiempo vender yo flores pa ti.\n\nIn my house I have a garden in order to sell flowers for you if bad times come.\n\nA mi me duele, me duele la boquita de decirte, gitana, si tt me quieres.\n\nMy mouth hurts me, gitana, from asking you if you love me. 105\n\nLo he dicho, y lo voy hacé un teléfono sin hilo pa sabé de tu queré..\n\nI’m going to make, as I have said, a wireless telephone in order to know of your love...\n\nEr queré quita er sentio; lo digo por esperiensia, porque a mi m’ha suseio.\n\nLove\n\nI talk through experience because it has happened to me.\n\nA mi me daban, me daban, tentaciones de locura cuando de ti me acordaba.\n\nI had crazy temptations whenever I thought of you.\n\nVen acd, falsa y refalsa,© falsa, te vuelvo a deci... El dia que me vendiste, ccudnto te dieron por mi?...\n\nfalse, I say again, the day that you sold me out, how much did they give?\n\nCuando pases por mi vera orvia que me has querio y no me mires siquiera,\n\nWhen you pass by me forget that you have loved me and don’t even glance my way,\n\nEn\n\nIf we were in a room together I would do anything for you, even take poison.\n\nun cuartito los dos,\n\nveneno\n\nque\n\ntt me\n\nveneno\n\ntomara\n\ndieras,\n\nyo.\n\nCome\n\ndestroys\n\nhere,\n\nthe senses;\n\nfalse\n\nwoman,\n\nCALESERAS.—Cante chico, neither danced nor played. A ’’calesero’’ is the driver of a horse-drawn buggy. The Caleseras are the cante that helps these drivers pass the long hours on the open road. The compds is to the trot of the horse’s hooves, slow or fast as the case may be. The verses are usually about animals, the country, and love. The Caleseras are thought to be a much gaier descendent of the Serrana.\n\nTengo una yegua rubia, rubia castana, la rubia de Lucena se llama la -yegua.\n\nI have a blonde mare, a chestnut mare, she is called\n\nthe Blonde of Lucena (a town near Cérdoba). ;\n\nCAMPANILLEROS.—Andalucian folklore not considered The Campanilleros are a traditional cante sung by the religious processions called the ’’Rosario de la Aurora’’ dawn). These processions leave at dawn from their churches 106\n\nflamenco. members of (Rosary at for various\n\nteligious motives, proceeding through the streets singing the Campanieros, en masse, to the accompaniment\n\nof the ringing of little bells, and\n\nsometimes guitars, carried by the members of the procession. The tradition of the bells is being lost, although a few parishes in Andalucia still respect this colorful ceremony. These processions take place most frequently during Lent, and in the fall of the year. The Campanilleros are not usually considered flamenco, as the cante has few of the characteristics of true flamenco singing. Nevertheless, they do play an interesting part in the life of Andalucia, and therefore qualify to be mentioned. Also, a few singers have introduced more flamenco-ized versions of the cante, apparently attempting to add the Campanilleros to flamenco’s repertoire. When accompanied by the guitar,-the Fandanguillo compds is often used, or merely a steady, beating thythm. Their name derived from the tradition of the little bells, which are called\n\n*’campanillas”’.\n\nEn los pueblos de mi Andalucia los Campanilleros a la madrugé me despiertan con sus campanillas y con su guitarra me jasen lord...\n\nAt dawn the Campaunilleros wake me with their little bells and make me weep with their guitar in the villages of my Andalucia...\n\nUn devoto por ir al Rosario\n\nAs the Rosary\n\npor una ventana se quiso arrojd,\n\none\n\nof\n\ny al deci *’;Dios te sarve Maria!l’’,\n\nand\n\non crying ’’God save you, Ma-\n\nse jayo en er suelo sin jaserse nd.\n\n[rial’’, he crashed to the ground uninjured.\n\nCANTINAS.—Cante,\n\nthe\n\n(procession)\n\npassed\n\n[oy\n\ndevout threw himself [from a window,\n\nbaile, and toque chico.\n\nThe Cantifias are identical to the Alegrias, with the exception of a variation in the cante. The word ’’cantina’’ is the name given to medieval songs from Galicia, in northern Spain, which leads theorists to believe that the Cantiias were adopted by the people of Cadiz and set to the rhythm of the Alegrias. They are a gay cante, with a strongly accentuated compds. Excellent present day singers of the Cantifas are Aurelio de Cadiz, Pericén de Cadiz, and La Perla de Cadiz, among others.\n\n407\n\nA ti muchos te dirdn, *’Serrana, por ti yo muero’’;\n\nMany will tell you “Mountain Girl, I would\n\nyo nunca te he dicho nd que soy el que mds te quiero.\n\nI have never told you that, although I am the one that loves [you most.\n\nQue que que que\n\nWith when you're at the\n\ncon el aire que llevas cuando caminando vas, hasta el farol de la popa tu lo vas a apagar...\n\ndie for\n\n[you;””\n\nthe air that you have swinging along, likely to blow out the lantern poop of the boat...\n\nCANAS.—Cante, baile, and toque grande. The Camas, together with their sister cante, the Polos, are the most ancient known manifestation of flamenco. They were derived from religious chants centuries ago. Many cantes have derived, directly or indirectly, from the Camas (see the Genealogy of Cante Flamenco), the most similar of which are the Soleares. Today the basic differences between the Caias, Polos, and the Soleares are in the structure of their cantes. Their bailes and toques are very similar, although traditional differences still exist which are known by truly knowledgeable artists. Presently the Camas are rarely performed in their traditional purity, although strong efforts are being made to revive this majestic cante. The\n\ncantaores\n\nCurro\n\nDulce,\n\nSilverio,\n\nand\n\nChacén\n\nall contributed\n\ncreatively to the development of the Cafias. Deja que la gente diga que te quiero y no te quiero, yo soy quien pasa las penas, y sé que te estoy queriendo...\n\nLet the people say what that I love you or don’t I am the one who suffers and I know that I love\n\nEl no al y\n\nThe book of experience serves man for nothing; the truth comes at the end, and no one arrives to the end...\n\nlibro sirve final nadie\n\nde la experiencia al hombre de nd; viene la letra llega al final...\n\nLa mujer y la sombra tienen un simil: que buscando se alejan, dejadas, siguen. 108\n\nthey wish, love you, the pangs, you...\n\nA woman and a shadow are much alike; on being pursued, they escape; on being ignored, they follow.\n\nCARACOLES.—Cante and toque chico, baile intermedio. The Caracoles are rhythmically identical to the Alegrias, varying mainly in their cantes and in their chord structures. Today the Caracoles are considered to be a cante of Madrid. In modern times this is true, due to their introduction to Madrid by the roth century banderieros (placers of banderillas in the bullfight) Curro Cuchares and el Tato,\n\nwho\n\nfore this,\n\nheard,\n\nand were\n\nthe cantaores\n\nJosé\n\ncaptivated el de\n\nby the Caracoles\n\nSanlticar\n\nand\n\nPaco\n\nin Cadiz.\n\nBe-\n\nel Gandul\n\nhad\n\ntaken a relatively serious and majestic Caracoles and infected them with the gaiety and lightness characteristic of the cantes of Cadiz. Thus the Caracoles have developed from relatively serious to light, and have been transplanted from the province of Cadiz to Madrid. The word **caracoles’’ literally means ’’snails’’, but here it is used as an exclamation, much like ’’caramba’’. It is thought that the Caracoles may have been in part developed from a 19th century Cantifia called ’’La Caracolera’’. Como reluce la gran calle de Alcala cuando suben y bajan los Andaluces.\n\nHow the great street of Alcala glitters and shines when the people of Andalucia pass up and down.\n\nAlcala is a principal street in Madrid. Vdmonos,\n\nvamonos\n\nLet’s go, let’s go\n\nal café de la Union\n\nen donde para Curro el Tato, y, Juan Leon.\n\nto the\n\nCuchares,\n\nUnion\n\ncafé,\n\nthe meeting place of Curro Cticha-\n\n[res,\n\nel Tato, y Juan Leén.\n\nThe Café de la Unién, in Madrid, used to be the hangout for toreros, banderilleros, and other people of the bull ring.\n\nCARCELERAS.—Cante grande *’a palo seco’’, neither played nor danced. ”Carcel’”’? means jail’ or ’’prison’’, ’’carceleras’’ translates ’’happenings in a prison.’’ The Carceleras are reminiscent of the Martinetes, Tonds, and Siguiriyas in their wailing, difficult execution. They are a cante that was created, and still thrives, within the walls of Andalucian\n\nprisons. They are the lonely cry of the abandoned, of men who have become criminals during a moment of passion, or perhaps have been 109\n\njailed mistakenly. They are jondo, serious, and hopeless; men pressed against bars and crying:\n\na cante of\n\nMaldita sea la céarcel, sepultura de hombres vivos, donde se amansan los guapos y se pierden los amigos.\n\nDamned be the jail, tomb of live men, where spirited men are tamed and friends are lost.\n\nConoct a un hombre de bien, tan cabal como un relo, y por cosas del querer en un presidio murio,\n\nI knew a good man, as faultless as a watch; through the happenings he died in a prison,\n\nSi alguien hubiera en el mundo que la libertad me diera,\n\nIf someone could\n\ngive\n\nof love\n\nin the world me\n\nliberty,\n\ncon jierros en los tobillos esclavito suyo fuera.\n\nwith chains on my ankles I would be his slave.\n\nAquel que tenga familia\n\nHe who has should talk for he may by someone\n\nque\n\nno\n\nhable\n\nmal\n\nde\n\nnadie,\n\nque puede tené el castigo de que de la suya hablen. This verse refers to a gypsy\n\na family badly of no one, be punished in turn talking of his.\n\nsuperstition that slanderous\n\ntalk is\n\nliable to backfire.\n\nThe Carceleras also served a practical purpose. Gypsy prisoners used to sing messages in cald (the language presently spoken by the Spanish gypsies, an impure mixture of Romani and Spanish) to relatives and friends outside of the walls, much to the annoyance of the uncomprehending guards. CARTAGENERAS.—-Cante and toque intermedio, not danced. The Cartageneras were conceived by the sweat, risks, and hard life of the miners of Levante during the latter part of the last century and the beginning of the present. They are sad, resigned, and jondo in nature, and have a definite Oriental quality. They are a free cante, having no defined compds; the guitarist has the difficult task, in this and in all free cantes, of following the whims of the singer. They are a true test for both the singer and the guitar accompanist. Their name was taken\n\nfrom\n\nthe eastern Mediterranean\n\nseaport of Cartagena.\n\nA singer called Rojo el Alpargatero is credited with much of their early development, followed by Antonio Chacén’s superb interpreta-\n\ntions. 110\n\nSe estdé quedando la Union como corrd sin gallinas: a unos se los lleva Dios, a otros los matan las minas.\n\nLa like God the\n\nUnién is becoming a farm without chickens: takes some, mines finish the others.\n\nLa Union was a mining town in the mountains near Cartagena that had a typically large casualty list in the years of primitive mining. Obrero, si pa ti para el y para\n\nporqué trabajas no es el producto; rico es la ventaja tu familia el luto.\n\nWorker, why do you work if you don’t reap the benefits; for the rich, the rewards, for vour family, the mourning.\n\nNotice the similarity between songs of the 20’s and 30’s. CHUFLAS.—Cante,\n\nthis verse and the American\n\nunion\n\nbaile, and toque chico.\n\nA more burlesque form of the Tientos Canasteros (Tangos), the Chuflas are an all-out effort at humour. Developed by the gypsies of the Cadiz region, it is said that only the gypsies have the abandon to dance the Chuflas well; if not done with true gracia and good taste by a natural comedian, they often become grotesque. The Chuflas will often express the public’s view of contemporary events, usually in a humorously ironic manner. As in the Chuflas anything goes, they are probably flamenco’s most truly spontaneous component.\n\nVerses of the Tientos Canasteros and the Chuflas can be sung interchangeably, as the rhythm and accentuation are identical. The word ’’chufla’’ means ’’kidding’’, ’’horsing around’’. Somos unos\n\nsenores, giienos\n\nWe\n\namigos,\n\nare seiiores,\n\nall good friends,\n\nque a divertirnos\n\ndecided to\n\nestamos\n\nhave\n\ndecididos,\n\na pasar las incomodidades y a partirnos las utilidades. COLOMBIANAS.—Cante,\n\na good\n\ntime;\n\nto ignore the bad and share the good.\n\nbaile, and\n\ntoque\n\nchico.\n\nThe Colombianas have been inspired by the rhythms of Colombian folk music. Their compds, accentuation, chording and flavour are reminiscent of the Cuban Gwajiras, and the Rumba Gitana. They have been popularized to a great extent by the dancer Carmen Amaya and Ml\n\nthe guitarist Sabicas. They are known to be gay, but, as you can note from the verses, this is not necessarily so. Quisiera ser perla fina de esos pulidos arretes y besarte la boquita y morderte los cachetes. cQuién te manda ser bonita si hasta a mi me comprometes?\n\nOh, to be one of the elegant pearls of your burnished ear rings and kiss your pretty mouth and bite your cheeks. Who told you to be so pretty that even me you are winning?\n\nDe la guerra vengo ciego, y aunque me sea doloroso, prefiero no ver el cielo que verte que estds con otro; hubiera sido un consuelo dar mi vida al Poderoso.\n\nI return blind from the war, and although it is truly sad, I prefer not to see the sky than to see you with another; it would have been a consolation to give my life to the Almighty.\n\nCon tu genio y tus desplantes,\n\nWith\n\nes poco grato mi sino. jBien supistes engaharme al tropezarte conmigo! jPues que te pelen al rape y que te den el ricino!\n\nyour\n\nbad\n\ntemper\n\nand your (tantrums, my destiny is pretty grim. How well you knew how to deceive me! So let them shave your head and give you castor oil!\n\nThis verse refers to the hoped-for jail treatment of a bad-natured lover.\n\nDANZA MORA.—Baile and toque chico, not sung. *’Danza Mora’ translates ’’Moorish Dance’’, and is a direct flamenco adaptation of the Moorish style of music. Rhythmically it is similar to the Zambra. The Danza Mora is the flamenco baile and toque most influenced by the Moors. It is usually danced barefoot, and often with little cymbals on the tips of the fingers which make bell-like sounds when struck together. It is generally more serious and less sensuous than the Zambra, with an increased use of slow, fluid arm movements, and without the desplantes which mark the Zambra. When danced well the Danza Mora has an air of mysterious beauty which characterizes all serious Oriental dancing. Sometimes verses of the Zambra will be sung to the Danza Mora. This practice is frowned upon, as it is out of keeping with the feeling of the dance. 112\n\nDEBLAS.—Cante grande ’’a palo seco’’, neither danced -nor played. The Deblas are one of the most jondo manifestations of the cante grande. Very few cantaores are capable of singing them with their original depth of expression. Presently the Tonds, Deblas, and Martinetes are nearly indistinguishable to most cantaores and aficionados, and are often\n\nincluded\n\nin the same\n\ncante,\n\nas the complete\n\ncante\n\nof each\n\nhas\n\nbeen nearly forgotten. Great effort is being made to revive these grand cantes. The Deblas, as we know them today, were created by El Lebrijano,\n\na singer of the 18th century, and further developed by Diego el Fillo in the early roth century. Their verses have the curious characteristic of being always ended with the phrase ’’deblica bare’’ (usually sung in the\n\nflamenco\n\nway\n\n’’deblica\n\nbarea’’,\n\nor\n\n’’deblica\n\nbareaoo’’),\n\nwhich\n\nis\n\ncalé (gypsy) for ’’grand goddess’’. The reason for this is unknown. Most probably there is a connection between the Deblas and some distant gypsy religious rite. Rafael Romero sings one of the few recorded interpretations of the Deblas (and another rarely heard cante, the Tonds Chicas) on the Westminster Anthology of Cante Flamenco. Yo ya no era quien era mi quien yo fui ya seré; soy un drbol de tristeza pegaito a la paré. Deblica bare... Una mujer fue la de mi perdicién no hay perdicién que por mujeres Deblica bare...\n\ncausa primera; en el mundo no venga.\n\nEn el barrio de Triana no hay pluma ni tintero pa escribirle yo a mi mare que hace tres aios no la veo. Deblica bare...\n\nI am no longer what I was nor will I be again;\n\nI am a tree of sadness in the shadow of a wall. Deblica bare... A woman was the cause of my first downfall; there is no perdition in the world that is not caused by women. Deblica\n\nbare...\n\nIn the neighborhood of Triana there is neither pen nor ink with which\n\nto write my\n\nmother,\n\nwhom I haven’t seen for three years. Deblica bare...\n\nThis verse reflects the poverty which still exists in the Barrio de Triana,\n\nin Sevilla. m3\n\nFANDANGOS GRANDES.—Cante and toque intermedio, not danced. The Fandangos Grandes are probably the most widely sung, and badly abused, cante of all of flamenco. Every singer with the minimum of pretentions attempts the Fandangos Grandes; but the Grandes, sung\n\nas they should be, are not a cante for the run-of-the-mill singer. The\n\ntrue Fandangos Grandes approach the jondo, and are dominated by only a few singers; el Gordito de Triana, Antonio Mairena, Canalejas de Puerto Real, and Caracol are among their true masters. The origin of the category ’’Fandangos’’, which includes the Grandes and the Fandanguillos\n\n(also called Fandangos de Huelva) is thought\n\nto have been in the Jota country of northern Spain (1). The original Fandangos were lively and danceable, accompanied by guitars, castanets, tambourines, and violins (as is still true of the traditional Verdiales of the same family). In time one branch of the Fandangos took on more serious aspects, chiefly because of the influence of Arabic stylings, and grew away from the original Fandangos; this jondo outgrowth is the Fandangos Grandes. Now, due to their completely different natures, it is necessary to differentiate between the Fandangos Grandes (Great Fandangos), and the Fandanguillos (Little Fandangos). There are many types of Fandangos Grandes, the most prodigious being those of Triana, Cérdoba, and Lucena. They are an abstract cante without an indicated compds, the guitar having to closely follow the singer. La gente quiere perderte y voy a salvarte yo, porque me duele tu pena como le dolidé al Senor el llanto de Magdalena.\n\nThe people wish to reject you, but I am going to save you because your grief saddens me as the grief of Magdalena saddened God.\n\nA los racimos de uva\n\nYour love seems\n\nse parece tu querer;\n\nlike a bunch of grapes;\n\nla frescura viene antes,\n\nthe freshness comes first,\n\nla\n\nthe\n\nYo\n\nborrachera,\n\ncomo\n\ntt no encuentro nin(guna, con quien compararte;\n\nmujer, (1) 114\n\ndespués.\n\nThe Jota,\n\nin turn,\n\ndrunkenness\n\nafter.\n\nI won’t find another woman to compare\n\nwith you;\n\nhas been traced to a Moorish heritage.\n\nsélo he visto, por fortuna, a una en un estandarte y a los pies leva la luna.\n\nI have only seen one on a pedestal with the moon at her feet.\n\nThis verse refers to a statue of the Virgin Mary, standing on a ball which could be taken as the moon. Por su santa voluntd ciego hizo Dios el queré. Yo he visto mds de una vé perderse a un hombre cabal por una mala mujer.\n\non which she is\n\nGod made love blind by his saintly desire. I have seen more than once the ruin of a good man over a bad woman.\n\nAnd two depressing Fandangos de Triana: Una mujer se moria sus hijos la rodeaban y el mds chico la decia Mama mirame a la cara no te mueras todavia...\n\nA woman was dying her children surrounded her and the smallest said to her Mama look at my face don’t die yet...\n\nEntré un dia en un manicomio me pesa el haberlo hecho yo vi una loca en el patio se sacaba y daba el pecho a una munequita de trapo...\n\nI entered an insane asylum one day —it grieves me to have done it— I saw a crazy woman in the patio take out and feed her breast to a little rag doll...\n\nFANDANGUILLOS.—Cante and toque chico, mixed dance. The Fandanguillos (Fandangos de Huelva) are thought to have descended from the Jota of northern Spain. Originally they were accompanied\n\nby guitars,\n\nviolins, tambourines,\n\nand castanets. Deep in the\n\nHuelva country, where these instruments are scarce, supplemental accompanying instruments have been developed, and are still used, which are: reed flutes, hand-made by the country people from reeds that grow in the country; pieces of partially-split cane that, when skillfully banged between the thumb and forefinger, produce a sound similar to castanets; and crude drums on which they beat out the basic rhythm. Each village in the province of Huelva has developed its own style of Fandanguillo, the most well-known being those of Almonte, Alosno, and el Rocio. A particularly good time to hear these many types of Fandanguillos is during the Romeria del Rocio (religious pilgrimage to the village of Rocio, which lies between Sevilla and Huelva). Once a 11s\n\nyear el Rocfo is the convergent point of oxen carts from all over the\n\nprovince (this Romeria is, sadly enough, becoming badly cluttered up with automobiles, motos, trucks, etc.). Religious ceremonies are stressed the first two or three days, followed by two or three days more of merriment sparked by countless Fandanguillos which issue from everywhere and everybody. The Fandanguillos have enjoyed immense popularity during this century, much to the disgust of the purists. During a span of thirty or forty years the Fandanguillos and the Fandangos Grandes were almost all that could be heard of flamenco. This state of affairs, extremely harmful to the art of flamenco, is just today subsiding. The most famous fandanguero remembered is Pepe Pérez de Guzman,\n\na member\n\nof an aristocratic family\n\nof Huelva.\n\nThe Fandanguillos are characterized by a never-ending number of poetically beautiful verses of all themes and moods, as follows: Cuando la vi de llorar que\n\ncrei de\n\nvolverme\n\nloco,\n\npero luego me enteré que ella lloraba por otro, y entonces fui yo quien lloré.\n\nWhen I saw her cry I thought that I would go crazy. But later I understood that she cried for another; then it was I who\n\nMe tratas como a un nifio porque te quiero con locura. Tu me tiras por los suelos. Qué malamente me miras tanto como yo te quiero.\n\nYou treat because I You drag How bad\n\nSe al y se\n\nAs they rounded a corner they met again, and like two children they began crying. Love has no cure.\n\nvolvieron a encontrar revolver una esquina, como dos criaturas pusieron a llorar,\n\nEl amor\n\nno tiene cura.\n\nNo quiero que hables con naide.\n\nas much\n\nme love me you\n\ncried.\n\nlike a child you with frenzy. . through the dirt. are with me\n\nas I love you.\n\ncon tu padre,\n\nI don’t want you to talk to anyone. Only to your confessor, your father,\n\ncon\n\nyour\n\nmother,\n\nyour\n\nsister,\n\nSdlo\n\ncon tu\n\ntu confesor, madre,\n\ncon tu hermanita,\n\n¥ yo. 6\n\nand me.\n\nThe last verse portrays prevalent in Andalucia. Hasta\n\ndespués\n\nte tengo\n\nque\n\na\n\nSpanish-Moorish\n\nde la muerte\n\nattitude\n\nstill\n\nvery\n\nTI shall love you even after death, for the dead can still love. I love you with my soul, and the soul never dies.\n\nestar queriendo,\n\nque muerto también se quiere. Yo te quiero con el alma, y el alma nunca se muere.\n\nFARRUCA.—Baile and toque chico, no longer sung. La Farruca is thought to be an adaptation of the dances of the province of Asturias, in northern Spain. This belief is strengthened by the dictionary definition of ’’farruca’’: ’’Asturian or Galician newlyarrived ; brave, courageous.’’ It is very similar to the Tientos Canasteros, although its baile and toque have developed along more majestic, serious lines.\n\nMany\n\nbailes and\n\ncantes,\n\nsuch as the Farruca,\n\nhave been\n\nformed in the port of Cadiz, which was an extremely popular stop-over port in the past. The Gaditanos (people of CAdiz) were fast to absorb their visitor’s folklore, and were ingenious in converting it to flamenco. The Farruca has developed, largely through the efforts of el Faico, a rgth century dancer from Sevilla, as probably the most virile of the male dances. The cante Farruca largely disappeared in the last century. GARROTIN—.Andalucian\n\nThe\n\nGarrotin\n\nis being\n\nfolklore.\n\naccepted\n\nslowly’ but surely into flamenco\n\ncircles, as are the Sevillanas, Milongas, Tanguillos, Campanilleros, and the Vito, to date considered folklore. All of these are considered by an\n\nincreasing number of aficionados as chico elements.\n\nThe Garrotin is said to have descended from the Farruca and, like the Farruca, is thought to have been converted into flamenco in the\n\nCadiz area from the folklore of northern Spain, probably of Asturias or Galicia. Mi mario es mi mario y no es mario de nadie;\n\nla que quiera a mi mario vaya a la guerra y lo gane. Pregintale a mi mi sombrero te las malas noches y el relente que\n\nsombrero, dird que paso me da.\n\nMy\n\nhusband is mine\n\nand mine alone; whoever wants him\n\nhas a fight on her hands. Ask my\n\nhat\n\nand it will tell you of the bad nights that I pass and the cold that I feel. il7\n\nGRANAINAS.—Cante and toque intermedio. Not danced. The Granainas are an adaptation of the Fandangos Grandes which have been strongly influenced by the Moors, rulers of Granada for eight centuries. They have developed a more discordant, Oriental quality than the Fandangos Grandes. Although not considered particularly jondo, certain interpreters, such as el Nifio de Almadén, give them a profundity and beauty that cannot be denied. Many of their melodies and verses strongly stress the resignation prevalent in the Arabic and Gypsy philosophies. They are a free cante and toque, without a determined compds. The term ’’granainas’’ is an abbreviation of ’’granadinas’’, which means to say ’’songs from Granada’’. Ninguno ya tiene penas, que todas las tengo yo, con una losita negra encima del corazon... Una\n\ncruz\n\nlevas\n\nal pecho,\n\nengarza en oro y marfil, deja que me duerma en ella, crucificandome alli...\n\nNo one has grief anymore, I have it all myself, with a black tombstone upon my heart... You carry a cross on your chest, _mounted in gold and ivory, let me sleep upon it, crucifying\n\nmyself\n\nthere...\n\nGUAJIRAS.—Cante, baile and toque chico. The Guajiras are a flamenco version of a Cuban rhythm of the same name. They were brought to Spain in the XVI century by Spanish soldiers returning from the conquests. Most of their verses deal with Cuba and the Cubans, usually in a light vein. The Guajiras, indolent and sensual, are rhythmically similar to the Tientos Canasteros and the Rumba Gitana. Yo vi banarse un cubanito entre los canaverales y al mivarme sonreia y cantandome decia que lo sacava del agua porque el agua estaba fria...\n\nI saw a Cuban boy swimming between the cane fields; on seeing me he smiled\n\nVente conmigo\n\nCome\n\nal bohio\n\nand\n\nasked\n\nme,\n\nsinging,\n\nto take him out of the water because it was very cold... with me to my\n\nhut\n\nque es una choza de plata,\n\nthat\n\ndonde\n\nwhere you will be, my mulata, by your own free will; I will toast my love to you\n\nhas de estar,\n\nmi mulata,\n\na tu completo albedrio; te brindaré mi amorio 118\n\nis made\n\nof silver,\n\nsatisfecho y orgulloso, y ante el Todopoderoso, como\n\nvendido\n\ndoncel,\n\nte juraré serte fiel; el mds fiel de los esposos.\n\nsatisfied and proud, and before the All-powerful, like a conquered\n\nknight,\n\nI shall swear to be true; the truest of all husbands.\n\nJABERAS.—Cante and toque iniermedio. Not danced. The Jaberas are a rarely heard member of the large family of the Fandangos Grandes, more directly associated with the Malaguefas. They are believed to have originated as an inland cante of country people. Like the Malaguefias, they are a free cante with no determined compas. Se despierta un rey celoso, coge la pluma y escribe, y en el primer renglon pone: quien tiene celos no vive.\n\nA jealous king who wakes up picks up his pen and begins writing, and on the first line he puts: he who is jealous does not live.\n\nEn el pinar del amor estando cortando pinas, del tronco salté una astilla; se clavé en mi corazon. Muerto estoy, llorame, niia...\n\nIn the pine forest of love cutting pine trees, a@ splinter flew from a trunk and buried itself in my heart. Tam vanquished; cry for me, love...\n\nJALEOS.—Cante, baile, and toque chico. The Jaleos are said to be the oldest of the known rhythms of Cadiz. They are gay, vivacious, usually a typical manifestation of the picturesque ’’joy of living’’ that the Gaditanos (people of Cadiz) possess. They are a more primitive form of the Alegrias. Viva Cadiz y viva la muralla junto al mar... Vivan los cuerpos gaditanos que se saben jalear...\n\nLong live and its sea Long live experts at\n\nViva la novia, y el novio, y el cura que los casé, el padrino y la madrina\n\nLong live the bride and the groom, and the priest who married them, and the godfather, and the god[ mother, and the guests, and myself...\n\ny los convidaos, y yo...\n\nCadiz wall... the Gaditanos, hell-raising...\n\nand one not so gay: lig\n\njAy!, que me he quedao manquito y cojo, que de cortar las catias de caha en los canaverales... Ayyy, como darle de comer a mi pare, a mi mare... LIVIANAS.—Cante,\n\nAy! I have been left maimed and crippled from cutting cane after cane in the cane fields... Ayyy, how to feed my father and my mother...\n\ntoque, and baile grande.\n\nThe Livianas are the sister cante of the Serranas, having the same compds, and varying only in the structure of the cante. They are said to have been derived in part from the Martinetes and the Siguiriyas, perhaps being first sung in gypsy blacksmiths’ forges. Their verses are generally more philosophical and less melancholy than those of the Martinetes and the Siguiriyas. The origin of the term ’’livianas’’, as applied to the cante, is unknown. Presently a ’’liviana’’ is understood to mean \"lead donkey’, or ’’frivolous’’, neither of which seems appropriate. Quita una pena otra pena, un\n\ndolor,\n\notro\n\ndolor,\n\nun clavo saca otro clavo, y un amor quita a otro amor...\n\nOne sorrow relieves another sorrow, one\n\npain,\n\nanother\n\npain,\n\nCrece el fuego con el viento, con la noche el padecer, con el recuerdo, la pena, con los celos, el querer...\n\none nail forces another, and one love is replaced by anoth[er;.. Fire grows with the wind, suffering with nightfall, sorrow with remembrance, and love with jealously...\n\nTengo una copa en la mano, y en los labios, un cantar, y en mi corazén, mds penas que gotas de agua en el mar, y en los desiertos arenas...\n\nI have a drink in my hand and a song on my lips, but in my heart... more sorrows than drops of water in the sea, or sand in the desert...\n\nVentanas a la calle son peligrosas, son peligrosas, pd la mare que tiene sus nifias hermosas\n\nWindows facing the street are dangerous, so dangerous, for the mother that has beautiful daughters...\n\nMALAGUENAS.—Cante and toque intermedio, not danced. In the past the Malaguefas have reached unforgettable heights. t20\n\nThey were the favorite cante of such famous singers as Juan Breva, Antonio Chacon, and Enrique el Mellizo, and when sung by them reached the honored level of cante grande. The Malagueias have been described as a Fandango Grande given the special flavour of the sea and the beaches; the flavour of the beautiful region of Malaga. They are a direct descendent of the Fandangos Grandes, and, like them, are a free cante with an undetermined compas. The well-known semi-classical Malaguefia of Lecuona was based on the flamenco Malagueiias, and at times displays certain faint traces of a flamenco style. Malaguefias of Antonio Chacon: En, la tumba de mi madre @ dar voces me ponia,\n\nIn the tomb of my mother I started shouting,\n\ny escuché un eco del viento;\n\nand I heard an echo on the wind;\n\nno la llames,\n\ndo not call her, it sighed,\n\nme. decia,\n\nque no responden los muertos.\n\nthe dead do not respond.\n\nAquella campana triste estd dando la. una; hasta las dos estoy pensando _ en el querer que me distes; y me dan las tres llorando...\n\nThe mourning bell tolled one; until two I thought of the love that you gave me; as it tolled three I was crying...\n\nMalaguenas of Enrique el Mellizo: Donde va a llegar este querer tuyo y mio?\n\nWhere is it leading us, this love of ours?\n\nTu\n\ntratas\n\nde aborrecerme,\n\nYou\n\nwish\n\nto destroy\n\nyo\n\nca vez\n\nte quiero\n\nand\n\neach\n\nday\n\nAyy\n\nthat God send me death...\n\nmds;\n\nAyy que Dios me mande a mila [muerte...\n\nme,\n\nI love you\n\nmore,\n\nMalaguenas credited to Juan Breva: Los no las me\n\nsiete sabios saben lo que fatigmtas y lo hicieron\n\nde Grecia yo sé... el tiempo aprender...\n\njAyy! Maresita del Carmen, que pena tan grande es\n\nThe seven wise men of Greece don’t know as much as I... anguish and time have made me learn... Ayy! Virgin of the Carmen, what suffering it is aI\n\nestar juntito del agua y no\n\npoderla\n\nto be so near the water and not be able to drink...\n\nbeber...\n\nMARIANAS.—Cante\n\nand\n\ntoque\n\nchico,\n\nnot\n\ndanced.\n\nLike so many cantes, the Marianas are a descendent of the Fandangos Grandes. They have developed a rhythm reminiscent of the Tientos, although they are actually a free cante without a well-defined compds. They are believed to have been originally created by a singer of the last century as a love song for his sweetheart, Mariana. Another theory exists which claims that Mariana was the name of a performing monkey. Several verses are still sung that support this theory, but it is nevertheless considered unlikely.\n\nque no tenga su botana.\n\nNo one should talk badly about any[one as we are all of human flesh, and there is no flesh that is not marred.\n\nLos hombres, para ser hombres, ha de tener tres partias:\n\nMen, have\n\nhacer\n\naccomplish much, talk little, and never praise themselves.\n\nNadie que\n\nmurmure\n\nsomos\n\nde\n\nde carne\n\nnadie, humana,\n\ny no hay pellejo de aceite\n\nmucho,\n\ny hablar\n\npoco,\n\ny no alabarse en su via.\n\nSt quieres que yo a ti te quiera que ponme fianzas; de tu querer no me fio, carne de mi carne, porque eres muy falsa.\n\nto be true men, to have three virtues:\n\nIf you want me to love you give me guarantees; your\n\nlove I don’t\n\ntrust,\n\nflesh of my flesh, because you ave very false.\n\nMARTINETES.—Cante grande ’’a palo seco’’, neither danced nor played. When the gypsies were driven off of the open road, many of them entered iron forges and became blacksmiths. Frustrated by their desire to roam and of the hard life to which they had been subjected, they poured out their souls in song while they hammered away at their work. Thus the Martinetes of the forges were derived from the Tonds of the open road. ; The Martinetes, probably first developed in the forges of Triana, are extremely difficult to interpret, as they take great physical and emotional capacity. They are often accompanied, generally with no 122\n\nattempt at compds (in modern times the compds of the Siguiriyas is sometimes used), by a blacksmith’s hammer. The word ’’martinete’’ is said to have been derived from ’’martillo’’ — hammer. The two types of Martinetes still sung are the ’’natural’’, and the ’yedoblao’’, longer and more difficult. The 19th century singer, Juan Pelao, of Triana, is still remembered as the ’’king of the Martinetes’’. Entre la Hostia y el Cali,\n\nAs\n\nI took my\n\nthe\n\nsacred\n\nBread\n\nGod\n\na mi Dios se lo pedi,\n\nI asked\n\nque no te ajoguen las fatigas como me ajogan a mi.\n\nnot to permit misery as tt chokes me.\n\nAsi, como estd la fragua, jecha candela de oro, se me ponen las entranas\n\nLike the forge, my insides glow like gold when I remember you,\n\ncuando\n\nGRANAINA.—Cante\n\nThe Media naina,\n\nalthough\n\nGranaina less\n\nWith the weariness of death I crept to one side; with the fingers of my hand I tore at the wall... and\n\ntoque interimedio, not danced.\n\nis very similar to its mother\n\ndifficult\n\nto choke you\n\nand I weep.\n\nte recuerdo, y lloro.\n\nCon las fatiguitas de la muerte a un laito yo me arrimé; con los deitos de la mano avanaba la pared... MEDIA\n\nand [Wine\n\nto\n\ninterpret.\n\nLike\n\nthe\n\ncante,\n\nthe Gra-\n\nGranaina,\n\nit has\n\nabsorbed a strong blend of Moorish and Gypsy influences. Today the Media Granaina is probably more widely sung than the Granaina. Both of these cantes are from the province of Granada. ’’Media’’ translates “half’’. Gitaniya como yo no la tienes que encontrar aunque gitana se vuelva toita la cristiandad...\n\nAnother gypsy girl like myself you will never find although all Cristianity turns gypsy...\n\nDejarme un momento solo, quiero hartarme de llorar; déjame que ponga unas flores\n\nLeave me alone a moment, I wish to satiate my crying; Let me put some flowers 123\n\na esa tumba\n\ntan sagra,\n\non that tomb\n\nmemory\n\nYa te tengo prepara, pd cuando quieras veni, una cuevecita nueva jecha en el Albaicin.\n\nI have prepared for you for whenever you want to come, a new little cave in the hill of the Albaicin, (near Granada).\n\nQuiero vivir en Grand porque me gusta el oir la campana de La Vela cuando me voy a dormir..\n\nI wish to live because I like the bell of La when I go off\n\nLa la de si\n\nThe Virgen of Anguish, she who lives in the carrera, may she punish me if I don’t truly love you.\n\nque habita en la carrera, Virgen de las Angustias, esa seiora me espante no te quiero de veras.\n\nof my\n\nso sacred,\n\nrecuerdo de mis amores...\n\nloves...\n\nin Granada to hear Vela to sleep...\n\nMEDIO POLO.—Cante, baile, and toque grande. The Medio Polo is a simplified adaptation of the Polos, easier to sing, and not as jondo in nature. It is said to have been developed, like the Media Granina and the Soleariya, by singers who did not have the capacity to sing the mother cante. Nevertheless, it can be a very moving cante, and is still in the grande category. It is rhythmically identical to the Poles and the Soleares. ’’Medio’’ translates ’’half’’. Hasta si va\n\nla calumnia contra\n\nuna\n\nmata mujé,\n\nque no hay veneno mds malo que el que da gusto bebé...\n\nMILONGAS.—Andalucian folklore.\n\nSlander if said\n\ncan even about\n\ncause death\n\na woman;\n\nthere is no worse poison than that which gives pleasure to (drink...\n\nThe Milongas, thought to have originated in Argentina, were brought to Spain by returning conquistadores four centuries ago. They are similar to the Colombianas, although they have a changeable compds; sometimes free, sometimes well-defined. In time, the Milongas will probably be considered flamenco chico, as their cante and toque are flamenco in nature. They are not generally danced. Cuando siento una guitarra me da ganas de llorar, 124\n\nWhen I hear a guitar I feel the urge to cry,\n\n‘\n\nporque me acuerdo de Espana la tierra por mi sonada. Y en la noche clara\n\nbecause I remember Spain, the land of my dreams. In the clear night\n\nhasta\n\neven\n\nel aire\n\ncanta,\n\nthe air sings,\n\n4 de una garganta\n\nand from\n\nyo creo escuchar palabras de amores muy junto a una reja;\n\nI can almost hear words of love pass through barred\n\nsuspiros y quejas\n\nsighs and\n\ny un beso al chocar...\n\nand a kiss through\n\nThese are obviously migrant in America.\n\nthe\n\nsentiments\n\njMe gustas mds que el buen vino y mds que un pavo trufao! jMds que me gusta el tabaco 4 que estar siempre tumbao! jCon decirte que me gustas mds que el acta a un diputao! iY eso que eres un tonel y tu cutis se ha arrugao!... Mas no sé que gracia tienes ni qué tienen tus traseras que te miro y me parece que me das adormideras...\n\na throat\n\nwindows;\n\nmurmurs\n\nthe bars...\n\nof a homesick\n\nSpanish\n\nim-\n\nI like you more than good wine and roast turkey! And more than tobacco and just lazing around! L tell you that I like you more than a lawyer likes court! And this, even though you're a [barrel and your skin is all wrinkles!... I don’t really know what charm you and your buttocks have, that when I look at you it seems you've given me opium...\n\nThis immigrant seems to be better adjusted. MINERAS.—Cante and toque intermedio, not danced. The Mineras are very similar to the Cartageneras, the Murcianas,\n\nall cantes of the mines,\n\nTarantas,\n\nand\n\ncreated amid the sweat and toil\n\nof the miners of Levante. They can be very moving when interpreted properly. They are a free cante, without a determined rhythm. No se espante usted, senora, que es um minero quien canta; con el jumo de las. minas tiene ronca la garganta...\n\nDon’t be frightened, seiiora, it’s just a miner singing; with the smoke of the mines his voice has turned hoarse... 125\n\nEn diciendo jgente ar torno! todos los mineros tiemblan al vé que tienen su via\n\nIn saying, line up to enter! all of the miners tremble to see that their fate\n\na voluntd\n\nhinges\n\nde una\n\ncuerda.\n\non a rope.\n\nMIRABRAS.—Cante, baile, and toque chico. The Mirabrds were undoubtedly inspired by the Alegrias or a similar cante, as the compds and many other characteristics are identical. A mi que me importa que un rey me culpe si el pueblo es grande y me adora...\n\nWhat does it matter to me whether a king pardons me if the country is large and the people believe in me...\n\nThis verse had led theoreticians to consider the possibility that the creator of the Mirabrds was a nobleman, or person of the upper classes, persecuted by the king. Venga usté a mi puesto, hermosa, y no se vaya usté, salero,\n\ncastanas de Galarosa vendo, camuesa y pero. Ay Marina, yo traigo naranjas y son de la China, batatitas redondas y suspiros de canela, melocotones de Ronda, agua de la neveria; te quiero yo como ala mare que me pario... Come to my stand, beautiful, don’t\n\ngo\n\naway,\n\nsalero;\n\nI sell sweet and sour apples and chestnuts from Galarosa; I have\n\nChina\n\noranges,\n\nlittle round yams and cinnamon sweets, peaches from Ronda and water like ice. Ay Marina, I love you as I loved my mother who gave me birth. This verse reveals the technique used by the owner of a stand in attempting to entice Marina with the delicacies that he sells. It has inspired the theory that the Mirabrds came into being when José el de Sanhicar, a 19th century banderillero, first saw the many colorful stands 126\n\nof delicacies that used to rim the Madrid bull ring. He is said to have put his verses to the music of a Cantifia called the Mirabrds came into existence.\n\n’’El Almorano’’,\n\nand\n\nMURCIANAS.—Cante and toque intermedio, not danced. The Murcianas are one of the group of mining cantes of Levante, which includes the Tarantas, Cartageneras, and the Mineras. Like all of these mining cantes, the Murcianas have an Oriental, resigned air and\n\na discordant beauty Moorish in nature. They are a free cante with no defined compds, the guitarist following the singer and utilizing basically the chords of the other mining songs. The Murcianas are a rarely heard cante, on the verge of disappearing. They are from the region of Murcia. NANAS.—Cante and toque chico, not danced. The Nanas are cradle songs, sung to the children at bedtime to lull them to sleep. Cradle songs, of course, date back to the first mother and her child, but the cradle songs of Andalucia, sung in a tender flamenco style, are especially irresistible. The compds of the Nanas is the rhythm of a rocking cradle. ’’Nana’’ literally means ’’slumber song’, ”erandmother’’, ’’wet nurse’, or, less frequently, ’’mother.”’ Un dngel de canela guarda tu cuna, la cabeza p’al sol, los pies pd la luna...\n\nA cinnamon angel watches over your crib, his head towards the sun, his feet towards the moon...\n\nA dormir va la rosa de los rosales;\n\nOff to sleep goes the rose of roses;\n\na dormir, nina, porque ya es tarde...\n\nsleep, little girl, it is getting late...\n\nEl se y no\n\nThe little baby wishes to sleep, but the mischievous sandman just won't come...\n\nniio chiquito quiere dormir, el picaro sueho quiere venir...\n\nLas mujeres de La Puebla, para dormir a un chiquillo,\n\nThe women of La Puebla, to lull a baby to sleep,\n\nen vez de llamar al coco,\n\nsing him\n\nle"
