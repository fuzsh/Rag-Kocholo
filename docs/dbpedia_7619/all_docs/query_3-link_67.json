        "text": "FIRST REFERENCES\n\nThe modulations and melismas that define the flamenco type can come from Islamic single-stringed singings, but others attribute this creation to gypsy people coming from India.\n\nThe first ones to arrive in Spain were uan and Tomas also called Counts from the Minor Egypt, when the king Juan II from Aragon granted them a passing bond.\n\nPrecisely from the name \"Minor Egypt\" will emerge the world \"Gypsy\" and the arrival in Andalusia is dated in 1465, November 22.\n\nThe first document describing a gypsy woman and a gypsy man dancing is written by Miguel de Cervantes, on his work piece \"La Gitanill\", in 1613.\n\nWe cannot forget the existing culture when the \"Gypsies\" arrived, the psalmodies in the Jewish culture, the Mulsim singings, the traditional Mozarabic songs.\n\nWe think that the first \"palo\" was \"la tona\", this singing was not accompanied by a guitar, neither danced and it came from Cadiz, Jerez de la Frontera and Triana.\n\nOne of the problems of Flamenco is that its history is passed on orally til years 1900.\n\nWe have Demefilo, who wrote, from 1882 to 1888, the encyclopedia in eleven volumes called \"Las Tradiciones Populares Españolas\" (Spanish popular traditions). In the first volume we learn about \"Fiestas and costumbres andaluzas\" (Andalusian holidays and traditions). In 1881 he wrote \"Coleccion de Cantes Flamencos\" (Flamenco singings collection).\n\nDemèfilo is the pseudonym of Antonio Machado Alvarez, born in Santiago de Compostela in 1848 and died in Sevilla in 1893. He was a writer, an anthropologist and Spanish folklore expert, first Spanish flamenco expert, father of the poet Antonio Machado. Before him we have very little information about flamenco.\n\nORIGIN OF THE WORLD \"FLAMENCO\"\n\nMystery surronds everything connected to the ancient flamenco. This is the same regarding the world \"flamenco\". They are a lot of theories, but the most accepted belongs to Blas Infante in his work \"Orígenes de lo flamenco and secrets of the cante jondo\", written in the 20s and published for the first time in 1980. According to him this is an Arabic world and its meaning is \"wandering country people\" or \"Felah-Mengus\". Among all the theories we have some interesting ones, like the one provided by Demèfilo, explaining that the gypsies called \"gachos\" to the Andalusian, and the Andalusian called \"Andalusian\" to the gypsies, this is a very old denomination.\n\nGREAT OLD \"CANTAORES\" or SINGERS"
