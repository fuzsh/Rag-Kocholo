        "text": "Foundation\n\nOne of the things I am always looking forward to improve my flamenco dance is to look at other cultural influences from the past that have helped mold flamenco. There is a great blog called The A to Z’s of Flamenco Dance. The article called D is for Dance written by Linda Machado, provides a great excerpt on the origins and development of flamenco. Her emphasis on the steps to take in order to prepare oneself to take a flamenco class is precise and important. She explains that all flamenco dancers must start out with a strong foundation. Bypassing a strong foundation not only leads to a lack of ability to succeed in Flamenco dance but also may result in injury, yes injury. Included here the Link to such great excerpt. This website has more articles about flamenco and its influences. Linda Machado is a professional Flamenco dancer and instructor with over 20 years’ experience.\n\nMachado focuses on the basic steps to a strong foundation in what is considered the general order of importance:\n\nLearn the history of flamenco.\n\nStart learning the rhythms (start with a basic Tangos Flamenco, not Argentine) so you can recognize it when hearing it and be able to clap your hands to it.\n\nLearn basic technique from an instructor who believes in the value of a strong foundation.\n\nBe sure to have the proper tools in place (correct shoes, practice floor, and mirror).\n\nPractice every day, even if it is a few minutes a day.\n\nI would add passion\n\nI would add to Machado’s list; that passion must be there in order to succeed and never give up. Flamenco is a never ending dance form, and the desire to learn new things should be always present. I see flamenco as a dance that shows a story; the story of a suppressed culture of people that needed to express their feelings through this dance. Whether it was sorrow, happiness, for fun or to joke with the people, and even romance, there must be feeling and meaning in each step. In each part it reflects the dancer’s face the root of such a dance. My teacher explains it is a conversation you are having with the audience. You are in a way, showing what you feel.\n\nMy experience with learning the dance format has been excruciating, challenging, fun and full of joy. I’ve had moments when I wanted to scream and cry. I’ve been judged as someone who doesn’t learn fast.\n\n“My problem is that I want to know it all in one instant. I have always had a problem with patience, running before I could walk, and dancing is no exception. I admit my struggles are sometimes my tired feet, but I keep on trying and I don’t give up.”\n\nI learned patience\n\nYes, there has been moments when I wanted to scream at myself, I wanted things to come out faster, but this classes taught me to be patient with myself, and not to listen to any negative comments, for I know myself, and if I was anything near what my teacher thought of me, I wouldn’t be here today, she doesn’t have any idea of the things I have accomplished in life. Knowing myself, and all I do throughout the week makes me wonder how I do have time to practice. It is difficult for me, and some weeks have passed where I haven’t practiced as much as I should. Flamenco is not my whole life, it is just supposed to be a hobby, a goal I have, to at least learn the basics so that one day I can visit Spain again and enjoy a dance or two with some strangers in a Seville Fair. It shouldn’t be to kill myself over it, it should be just for fun. Now, if I was to dedicate myself to a career in flamenco then, by all means, I should strive to be the best flamenco dancer there is. I just like learning, and that can make it difficult for me to just stop with one or two lessons, I need to know it all, and that is the hardest part for me to stop thinking of what is going to be next.\n\nIt should be for fun\n\nFlamenco should be for fun, and that is how the gypsies introduced it first to the world. The added steps done by contemporary and other dance form professionals changed it and made it more complex at least that is my opinion. When I see how the gypsies dance it, I see it as a more genuine, simpler dance form.\n\nIf you would like to share your experience in learning a dance form or want to ask questions about my experience, leave me a comment below and I would be glad to share more on the subject.\n\nThe Five Elements of Flamenco\n\nFor flamenco there are five elements that are necessary to complete the group. Each has its importance, and without it flamenco is not complete. There will be occasions where a jaleo will not be necessary, but anyone that is used to dance flamenco would like to have a jaleo now and then come up either from the singer or the instrument players. The jaleo provides a sense of encouragement to the dancer by a person called the festero or festera. This person will be in charge of helping with the palmas (clapping of hands) and the jaleos. All of these elements are then presented in a tablao. A tablao is a small stage often made of wood. The word tablao comes from a derivative of tabla or piece of wood. The stage or tablao made of wood is preferred for the dancers because of the authentic sound it makes when the dancer hits the floor with the nails on the bottom of the flamenco shoes.\n\nThe elements of flamenco are:\n\ncante-singing\n\nbaile-the dance\n\nguitarra–guitar\n\npalmas-rhythmic hand clapping\n\njaleo– calls of encouragement, examples could be when people say “olé” by a festero or festera. A person who is animating the party and sole purpose is to encourage the people to clap, dance and sing if necessary.\n\nCompás\n\nI had enrolled in the Beginner’s class, and found out that there are things we needed to learn first. She taught us about Compás, which are the rhythms used in each palo or style. She started with Alegrias for us beginners, teaching us the rhythm with clapping hands. In the Spanish expression, sometimes the teacher or director will initiate the people with palmas, which is another way of calling the palm of your hands to start the compás for the guitarist, percussion and singer to start. The calling of palmas tells people to be together and assist in the song. A sense of community is prevalent in flamenco, where the gypsy families work together in unison for the greater good.\n\nWhen Elba our teacher says, “vamos, palmas” we all know she means a call to us to unite as one; a group of people coming together for the greater good, giving the guitarist a sense of what rhythm to follow.\n\nFlamenco rhythms are usually of either 12, 4 or 3 beats. The rhythmic units is called Compás.\n\nEach palo or style of flamenco has their own distinct rhythm.\n\nSolea has The style Soleá (or in plural Soleares) has a Compás of 12 beats. The strong beats in this Compás are as usual the 3, 6, 8, 10, and 12. However, some of them are especially pronounced, more specifically the 3, 10 and 12.\n\nAlegría is another rhythm with a Compás of 12 beats. A typical clapping pattern is equal to the first one shown for Soleá.\n\nBulería is rhythmically maybe the most difficult, but also most exciting style. Usually Bulería is taught as an example of a style with 12 beats, which is often true.\n\nThe rhythm of Siguiriyas can be interpreted as a Compás of 12 beats, starting at the 8 and finishing at the 7.\n\nTangos, Rumbas, Tarantos, Tientos have rhythms of 4 beats.\n\nFandangos are a group of very melodic flamenco styles. Most Fandangos have a very free rhythm (Fandangos libres) are not danced at all. However, between the songs, the guitar usually regains the rhythm at plays “a compás“. Only a few Fandangos have a constant rhythm and are danced, such as Fandango de Huelva. Many people interpret the rhythm of Fandango as a Compás of 12 beats, with the strong beats on the 3, 6, 8, 10, and 12.\n\nSo there you have it, the different compases or rhythms of flamenco vary and are difficult to learn. After learning the compás you can help the guitar player, the singer and the dancer with your hand clapping. compas is our own metronome, that if not done correctly, can destroy a whole performance. What that means is that you better know what you are doing in the compás, otherwise you might get the angry looks of some flamenco dancers.\n\nIf you have any questions about Compás, leave a comment below, and I will certainly provide you with some help.\n\nCante\n\nThe second thing we learn in flamenco is about the cante. Cante is one of the three main components of flamenco, along with toque (playing the guitar) and baile (dance). Because the dancer is front and center in a flamenco performance, foreigners often assume the dance is the most important aspect of the art form – but in fact, it is the cante which is the heart and soul of the genre.\n\nCante – Singing, also used to describe the different styles of flamenco when used in context such as: cante chico, cante grande or jondo, and cante intermedio.\n\nOur teacher is not going to teach us how to sing, although she teaches us how to maintain ourselves in the compas, which is very important for everyone in flamenco. Therefore, it is important as a dancer to know the different styles of cante in order to accommodate for the choreography of the dance, know which steps are appropriate, and what kind of rhythm or compas will be needed.\n\n“There are moments when my teacher will start to sing a little bit of a song to bring us into focus on what is coming next, or she might be sounding the different compasses we are working on.”\n\nStyles of cante\n\nCante chico – One of the three main stylistic families of flamenco, Cante chico has a lighter and more upbeat mood. Themes are often of love and happiness. Forms include bulerías, alegrías, and flamenco tangos.\n\nCantes libres – A free form of flamenco music in which melody plays an important part, while rhythm and metre seemingly do not apply. In many cases these songs grew out of more traditional, rhythmic flamenco music, evolving into pure melodies.\n\nCante grande/Cante jondo – One of the three main stylistic families of flamenco, Cante grande or cante jondo is darker in mood, with themes such as loss, anguish, despair, and death. Forms include soleá, martinete, tonas, seguiriya, and carceleras.\n\nCante intermedio –One of the three main stylistic families of flamenco, Cante intermedio is a looser family of styles, which encompásses all of the forms which do not fall under cante chico or cante grande.\n\n*A Cantaor or Cantaora is a singer (male / female).\n\nCamaron de la Isla singing a Buleria song\n\n*Buleria –originated in Jerez, Spain from the flamenco styles alegrías and soleares. This is the fastest and perhaps most difficult style of flamenco, including lively guitar playing and dancing with plenty of improvisation. The upbeat tempo of Buleria has proven to be quite popular and the style is performed in many flamenco shows, often to close out the performance.\n\nEstrella Morente’s Music: Estrella Morente\n\nThe Dance: The Different Palos or Styles of Flamenco Dance\n\nWord to learn before you read on:\n\nPalos=styles of flamenco (palo really means stick or branch; in flamenco it is explained as the branches of a tree).\n\nWhen I found out how many styles of flamenco exist, I flipped back and wanted to instead just stick with the popular Macarena dance. Knowing that it was not necessary to learn them all it gave me a relief because flamenco started to look like a never ending experience, something that for an inpatient person like me it was daunting. This is one of the reasons why flamenco can teach anyone that anything is possible, to never give up, and that is a tool that helps anyone achieve their highest potential. For this reason of so many palos or styles, some people concentrate in mastering only one or maximum three or four.\n\nFlamenco includes dozens of different palos (styles of flamenco) each a unique combination of rhythm, harmony, pulse, and lyrics. These styles are known as Palo Secos, or dry styles, and they are the oldest forms of song known today.\n\nList of Palos:\n\nAlegrías: is the best-known form in a family of lively, vibrant songs known as Cantiñas. Cantiñas developed during the Peninsular War in the early 19th Century when Spanish partisans gathered on the Atlantic coast near Cádiz to launch the first attacks against Napoleon. The music of Cádiz blended with jotas from Aragón, and the Cantiñas and its variations were born: Cantiñas, Alegrías, Mirabrás, Caracoles and Romeras. The Alegrías has emerged as the most popular version of the song.\n\nBulerías: is one of flamenco’s most flexible forms: constantly changing, spontaneous, humorous, equally at home on a concert stage or at a private juerga. It’s the Rock’n Roll of flamenco – fast, rhythmic party music laced with social commentary that mocks the rich as it entertains them.\n\nCantes de Levante: Levante is a term used to refer to Spain’s Eastern coast. It takes its name from the wind that arrives in Spain from the direction of the Levante, the eastern coast of the Mediterranean. As part of Levante, we have Tarantas, Tarantos and Grana’inas Cartegeneras.\n\nTarantas, Tarantos: People from the eastern Andalucían province of Almería are traditionally known as Tarantos. Tarantas is a cante or solo guitar form performed libre or arrítmico – without any underlying compás. Tarantos is the dance form of Tarantas. The presence of the dancer introduces a steady 2/4 pulse into the music.\n\nGrana’inas Cartegeneras: Grana’inas, (the Andalucían pronunciation of “Granadinas”), is a Fandango cante similar to the Malagueña. Often performed as a guitar solo, Grana’inas isn’t known as a dance form. As the name indicates, the song is associated with Granada, and in particular with Frasquito Yerbabuena (1883-1944), an amateur singer from Granada. The Jerezano singer Don Antonio Chacón created a version of Grana’inas known as the Media Grana’in\n\nFandangos is a tree with roots that reach across Andalucía and branches that keep growing. The form emerged as a popular song and dance in the late 18th Century in the port city of Cádiz from songs and dances brought to Spain from the Americas. The Fandango of today is an aflamencada gathering of those disparate roots.\n\nFandangos de Málaga is the name given to a broad array of flamenco forms which, taken together, seem to have little in common. Part of the confusion stems from the fact that the term Fandangos is used across the Spanish-speaking world to refer to a wide range of songs, dances, and parties. It’s even a brand of mezcal. In its division, there are Fandangos de Huelva and Fandangos Naturales. All these forms are related to the Verdiales traditional folk song and dance from the mountains near Málaga. It also includes dance forms of Verdiales, Abandolaos, Jaberas Malagueñas and Rondeñas.\n\nFarruca is a dramatic, dance-centric form characterized by sombre virtuosity, aggressive footwork, and dramatic shifts in tempo. “Farruco/a” is a slang term used in Andalucía and Latin America to refer to someone from the Spanish provinces of Galicia or Asturias who is far from home. The flamenco form Farruca has little to do with the music of northern Spain, though some of the melodic themes associated with the farruca are reminiscent of tunes from Galicia.\n\nGuajiras is a prime example of a canción de ida y vuelta, (song of coming and going) flamenco music that has grown out of the travels of Spanish working people who went to the New World to work and returned to Spain, bringing traces of the culture of the New World home with them. Guajíras comes from the music of farmers, many of them with roots in Andalucía, who worked small farms in Eastern Cuba. These farmers were known as guajiros, and the songs they sang about the beauty of Eastern Cuba were known as Guajíras.\n\nRumba Flamenca may be the most widely known and least understood of the flamenco forms. Most of the world first heard Rumba Flamenca via the Gypsy Kings in songs like Bamboleo and Volare. In Spain, Rumba Flamenca has come in and out of style since Niña de los Peines first recorded a Rumba in 1918. Since then, artists such as El Chaqueta, Chano Lobato and Miguel Vargas Jiménez (Bambino) have become closely associated with the form.\n\nSiguiriyas derived from flamenco’s earliest root forms, the tonás, Siguiriyas is one of flamenco’s oldest and deepest forms. Its name is a corruption of the term seguidillas, a group of 18th Century songs and dances. Siguiriyas first emerged in the 18th Century in Cádiz, Sevilla and Jerez de la Frontera. Slow, majestic and tragic, Siguiriyas is the most jondo of cante jondo forms. Its lyrics focus on tragedy, inconsolable sorrow, and pain. (I found out recently, this is my teachers’ favorite palo she explains it is like the equivalent of deeper sadness, like cutting vains of flamenco, for its dark, and powerfully tragic lyrics. In this I see her sharing her soul in performance.)\n\nSolea por Bulerias: Soleá (Soleares) por Buleriás is, as its name suggests, a Soleares with the pace and drive of a Bulerías. Often considered a hybrid form, Soléa por bulerías (also called Soleares por bulerías) is more like a point on the continuum between Soleares and Bulerías. Determining just where that point is can be a source of contention among professionals and aficionados. There are resources that state quite definitely that it is a sped up soleares and others that make it clear that it’s a slowed down bulerías.\n\nSoleares is often referred to as the mother of all flamenco forms because so many other important forms are derived from it. It may be more accurate to think of soleares as the most flamenco of flamenco forms. All the elements of soleares, including its 12-count compás with an irregular beat structure, its Andalusian cadence, and its melodic and melismatic gestures are unique to flamenco.\n\nSevillanas: An essential part of any flamenco repertoire, Sevillanas is closely associated with Seville’s April Fair, Féria de Abríl en Sevilla. This light and lively song and social dance have roots that extend deeply into many parts of Spanish culture. The dance exudes romanticism and has a joyous, flirtatious air. Sevillanas first emerged as a distinct form in the late 18th Century as a variant of the Spanish song form seguidillas, appearing simultaneously with the Escuela Bolera, a formalized approach to studying and performing a variety of Spanish regional dances. By the 19th Century, Sevillanas were an important form in the Escuela Bolera.\n\nTangos Gitanos is one of a variety of musical styles found in the Spanish-speaking world called “tango.” Like the Tango Argentino its roots lie in the way African and Caribbean music blended with Spanish music in 18th and 19th century Latin America. Like its South American cousin, Tango Gitano consists of a simple, easily varied harmonic and melodic structure over a four-count rhythm. Unlike other four-count patterns, the first beat is weak while the other three beats are strong.\n\nTientos is a slow cante jondo music and dance in a four-count rhythm, was first developed by the singer Enrique el Mellizo (1848 -1906) as an expressive variation of the Tangos. Poet Federico García Lorca considered the Tientos to be almost liturgical in its solemnity. Traditional Tientos lyrics – letras – set a dark mood, and have to do with loss, unrequited love, imprisonment, longing for freedom and other serious messages. Dancers strive to capture this mood in their solos.\n\nMy favorite one is…\n\nMy friends we have seen the different palos or styles of flamenco. Deeper understanding of each takes time and discipline. Most flamenco dancers spend their lifetime learning just a few of them, and even some dancers prefer to stick to one or two forms. I have only learned some Alegrias, Bulerias and Tangos, and that was just scratching the surface, I really don’t know enough to consider myself a master of these palos. But one thing is sure, Bulerias is my favorite; it is spontaneous and dynamic, letting me utilize the element of surprise, something I love to do. Another thing it has is that the choreography can be used in parties and family gatherings.\n\nAre you curious to find out which is your favorite palo? If you are curious to find out, let me know in the comments below, and I can email you the nearest flamenco school in your area.\n\n*For anyone interested in learning more about these palos or styles, check out this link below from Studio Flamenco. It provides an overview of each palo and its origins.\n\nhttp://www.studioflamenco.com/index.html\n\nList of Things You Need to Prepare for your Flamenco Class\n\nThere are certain things we need to do first before we start a flamenco class. These are my recommendations:\n\nWatch a flamenco show from beginning to end, whether live or through video. If you can stand the music and tapping sounds through the whole hour and enjoy it, then you might like flamenco.\n\nListen to a good flamenco CD, if you can stand listening to the singer and the guitar then you will enjoy flamenco.\n\nRead about the origins of flamenco, this blog and others can provide an overview to understand flamenco and its roots.\n\nEnroll in a good flamenco school in your area, start your research and the first day ask to just be a viewer, you might have to still pay the class fee, but it gives you an understanding of what to expect in class.\n\nTalk to the teacher and ask questions if you need to. Make sure the teacher has enough time or get an appointment or arrange for a phone call. The teacher that is willing to help and professional will grant you the time to ask questions.\n\nWhen you start going to class as a student, take a bottle of water with you, and dress comfortable, I suggest leggings or yoga pants and an exercise shirt. You will sweat and you need breathable clothes.\n\nStretch before and after the class. Our flamenco teacher provides us with stretching and yoga exercises. I recommend Pilates as well because flamenco is focused not only on footwork and arms but also on a strong core.\n\nDo not worry about the shoes, the teacher will recommend which ones to buy. For the moment you can use character shoes for the first few classes until you get proper flamenco shoes. If later on you decide that flamenco is not your thing, at least you didn’t purchase something that is not going to be used. Good quality flamenco shoes tend to be pricey. Check my other blog post here on flamenco tools and where you can purchase proper shoes. https://flamencodancesite.wordpress.com/2017/04/26/tools-to-practice-flamenco/\n\nIs there anything else you would like to know? If so, leave your comments below. Thank you\n\nFirst Day of Flamenco Class\n\nA Saturday morning was mostly spent at home sleeping late, getting up at around 10 am, and the usual cup of coffee in hand would wake me up to my senses. There were other worries, laundry had to be done, the car needed to be washed, and other mundane things kept me busy, but bored. I enter my first day of flamenco class on a Saturday morning, and since then, my days have been different.\n\nI left Bucks County, the suburb I live in to drive to Bala Cynwyd, PA area to the home of Elba Hevia y Vaca, artistic director and founder of Pasion y Arte Flamenco Conservatory, where I would be learning to dance flamenco. Elba has a very disciplined structure, she maintains a humorous, dynamic and a positive point of view; something she disseminates through her classes. I need to share with people that have a great outlook in life like her, there are many things that affect the world lately, and we all need a little bit of inspiration to continue in our journey.\n\nAfter entering the class, and seen people of different cultures, characters, different ages, and sizes, I realized the true flamenco. Flamenco is not a type of dance where you have to be slim and long like a ballerina, it helps to be in shape, but it accepts you as you are, and what is wonderful about this dance form, is that I have seen people that are professionals and good at this, who are not slim at all, that can show you a performance to die for.\n\nWe all assume flamenco is this romantic, sexy dance that has to be done by the attractive young woman, but I have seen women who are older, bigger in size, or men, who still make the dance sexier and romantic, by providing you with this sense of anything is possible, and in life, romance and sexiness knows no limits. Because in the dancer what transpires is passion, a passion that talks to you in their moves, making you want more.\n\n*I will be writing more about this conservatory in the near future, and even include an interview with Elba Hevia y Vaca, so stay tuned.\n\nIf you would like to comment on my experience or want to sign up for the school, just send me a comment below, and I will be glad to help."
