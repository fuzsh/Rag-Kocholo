        "text": "Aside from all of the history and beauty of Granada, there is one more thing that makes it unique……FREE Tapas! Granada is one of the last spots in Spain in which tapas are served for free when you order a drink. Tapas come in a variety of sizes and can be hot or cold. And, with each successive drink, the tapas get more elaborate. ‘El tapeo’ is what the Spanish call going from bar to bar to eat tapas and it is one of the best ways to get to know Granada. It’s a great way to try out the specialties while exploring the streets. Tapa crawling is much more than having a beer, it’s an art. It’s a way to understand the Granadian way of life, to understand the people and their traditions. Tapas Crawls can happen in any area of the city and I started mine on the Campo de Principe in the Realejo, Granada’s old Jewish Quarter. Stop 1: Taberna Tofe – I sat outside and ordered a glass of Rioja and it came with a small dish of paella. Stop 2: La Ninfa – I sat inside this charming Mediterranean restaurant whose walls are covered with traditional ceramics. I ordered a glass of Ruedo (white wine) and it came with olives and navajas (razor clams) cooked in olive oil (and tasted like clams). Stop 3: Los Martinetes – I ordered a glass of Sangria which was served with Migas, a traditional dish of bread crumbs with pepper, garlic and blood sausage. This entire Tapas Crawl cost less approximately $12. A few other noteworthy Tapas stops are: Bar Kiki – Located in the Plaza de San Nicolás in the Albaycin, Bar Kiki has a small interior bar but a huge patio out front. Grab a seat and order a Gin y Tonica (gin and tonic) and enjoy a tapa or two. The place is always packed and local musicians pass through and play. Bodegas Castaneda – Located near Plaza Nueva, this bar is an institution among locals and tourists. With salamis hanging from the ceiling and a large selection of wines, the only challenge will be getting a seat or spot at the bar. Rincon di Rodri – Three quarters of a mile south of the Plaza Nueva is this very popular seafood restaurant. Filled with locals, it was packed and the tapas portions are very large. I ordered two glasses of white wine and was served battered fish and then sautéed mushrooms over fries.
