        "text": "The Latin Ballet of Virginia is excited to announce the international touring in Mexico, representing the United States at the “Feria Internacional de Libro 2014”during the international cultural festival “Feria de San Marcos.” The governments of the states of Zacatecas and Guerrero, in Mexico, have invited the Latin Ballet to participate with our production of EL PINTOR from April 20-28, 2014. This is an incredible opportunity for us to make international connections and bring back new and exciting dance practices for our programming.\n\nAbout EL PINTOR\n\nEL PINTOR (The painter) based on the philosophical views of famous painter Julio Romero de Torres from Córdoba, Spain, who dedicated his life to reflect the traditions of southern Spain, expressing in his painting the state of the times at the end of the first Spanish republic. The painter focuses his art on the Spanish women from different social classes and the way they were allowed to express themselves. He uses many landscapes of his native Cordoba and the culture of his time. Most of his art is closely related to the magical spectrum of flamenco, the Spanish traditional dance form and most important part of Spanish culture. His art pays homage to the greatest artists of the time: singers, dancers and musicians as a symbol of eternal love of flamenco and Andalucia region, a land of nostalgia, fire and joy. Julio Romero de Torres, the extraordinary artist whose art is as \"deep\" as the deep song he loved, Cante Hondo (Deep Song)."
