Shortly before his death in 1997, the proliWc novelist James Michener succumbed to the temptation to revisit some of the most hackneyed of Gypsy stereotypes he had earlier mostly avoided in Iberia (1968), as a backdrop to a book that showcased his status as serious aWcionado of the bullWght. In Miracle in Seville (1995), a bizarre novella that Michener called a “fantasy,” an American journalist tells the story of two powerful women who battle it out during Holy Week festivities in Seville: a luminous and compassionate Virgin Mary and an evil Gypsy fortune-teller Magdalena López. The battle between heaven’s benevolent powers and Gypsy black magic and animal cleverness, in other words, between good and evil, is as old as the stones in the bridge that separate the “real Spain” of the Triana Gypsy district from the glittering streets of Seville on the opposite side of the Guadalquivir River.\n\n[1]\n\n00front.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 2\n\nintroduction\n\nThinking back on their supernatural powers, the narrator muses that women “possess an arcane power to inXuence men, making them see visions and inXuencing them to perform acts they would not normally commit.”1 The Virgin intercedes on behalf of the proprietor of a famous bull ranch who hopes to stage a comeback for his bulls. The Gypsy applies her dark magic to protect her cowardly brother from the horns of a Werce bull and the crowd’s anger at his cowardice. Michener’s scraggly bullWghter Lázaro López incarnates many of the worst commonplaces of the male Gypsy stereotype. The narrator, an American journalist, derides him as an unlikely bearer of the proud tradition of matador. His style is full of Xare and daring in the early stages of the bullWght, but when in the end the bull charges and the matador must plant his feet for the kill, his bravery deserts him and he resorts to shameless tricks to exit the bullring. Immune to the jeers of the spectators, he beats a hasty retreat, dodging the cushions and bottles thrown at him from the stands. In the taverns of Triana, however, López is a boastful and pompous ass, a hero to the Gypsies who pathetically gather around him and revere him as someone who has made it. While the Gypsy bullWghter symbolizes all that is wrong with the Spanish male Gypsy, his sister Magdalena, pictured in Figure 1, is a much more complex Wgure who evokes the mystery and lure of the unknown. The purpose of my book is to trace and analyze the many inXuences that have cast their shadow over such Wgures as Michener’s mysterious fortune-teller Magdalena. I focus especially on what many writers before Michener imagined as the “arcane power” of Gypsy women to inXuence men “to perform acts they would not normally commit.” Chief among these is the Carmen myth that is perennially reborn in European and American culture. Michener’s “fantasy” is one of hundreds of musical, artistic, and literary works set “not far from that famous cigarette factory where Carmen with the rose between her teeth bewitched the Spanish captain sent to guard her.”2 In the battle between the Virgin and the Gypsy in Michener’s novella, the Gypsy woman triumphs, possibly because hers is the power of the sexual predator and her visage is that of “the kind of woman men do not forget, with Xashing eyes that seemed to throw sparks.”3 In reality of course, Magdalena is unforgettable because she is a product of a collective memory, a fatally attractive woman who Xashes her eyes across four centuries in all forms of art, joining the ranks of the Virgin Mary as one of the most ubiquitous icons of Western culture. Magdalena’s “people” are imagined as belonging to another world, often associated with Egypt as here in Michener’s version, insinuating themselves into European societies through trickery and monumental scams. In Michener’s version, the Gypsies had crossed into Spain 500 years earlier and had bamboozled the king of Spain into believing that they were collecting money to rescue an isolated group of Christians from Muslim tyranny somewhere in Egypt.4 As will be clear in the\n\n[2]\n\n00front.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 3\n\nImage not available\n\nfig. 1\n\nJohn Fulton, Illustration of Magdalena López for James Michener, Miracle in Seville (1995).\n\n00front.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 4\n\nintroduction\n\nfollowing chapters, there are hundreds of stories of how this foreign import came to occupy such an important symbolic space in the Western imaginary. This book, then, is not about the real Romany, even though it is dedicated to those very real victims who lost their lives in the Holocaust, but about the idealized and sometimes demonized Wgure of the Spanish Gypsy, conceived throughout hundreds of years as a foreign and exotic presence who stealthfully imported something of the East into the West that hundreds of years have been unable to eradicate.\n\nMyths of Gypsy Origin and Being One of the reasons that Gypsies hold such fascination is that they play an important role in the evolution of Western myths of origin and being. Who am I? and Where do I come from? are among the oldest questions implicit in the complex genealogies of every European culture. At some point in its evolution, every selfproclaimed nation provides itself with a “spontaneous anthropology” to answer these questions in the most gratifying way.5 What concerns me in this introduction to the imaginary Gypsy are two related questions that underpin myths of origin: Who are they? and Where do they come from? To understand Europe’s centuriesold investment in the Gypsy as a quintessential other residing problematically on “home ground” requires a discussion not of sameness but of otherness and othering, and ultimately of racism in the modern, anthropological conWgurations it came to have in the nineteenth century. The story begins much earlier, however, with medieval myths of origin that eventually gave rise to racialized thinking in the regions of premodern Europe where groups of people either called or calling themselves Egyptians Wrst migrated eastward into modern-day Germany. The task of tracing their myths of origin and migrations is complicated for two reasons, Wrst because, as historians and anthropologists have so meticulously documented, myths of origin differ substantially from region to region even among groups considered consanguineous; and, second, myths are susceptible to striking reversals depending on the ruling classes to which their spokespersons owe allegiance. Thus, at various moments in French history the Franks were champions of liberty and independence or, as Voltaire considered them, “ferocious beasts in search of pasture, of shelter, and of some protection against the snow.”6 Their predecessors the Gauls were either inferior barbarians easily conquered by the Romans and later the Franks, as portrayed by some Enlightenment writers, or noble serfs of a proud Celtic heritage, as the children of the French Revolution chose to understand them. Little wonder, then, that myths of origin assigned by dominant groups to marginalized groups who have never risen to positions of great political or economic power should seem so unremarkable or\n\n[4]\n\n00front.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 5\n\nintroduction\n\neven ignominious, for how else could the pedigree of the dominant peoples who fashioned them be contrasted with that of subjugated groups? For this reason the earliest European myths regarding the origins and migrations of the Roma/Romany peoples are singularly unheroic. Their arrival in Persia is one of the more fanciful accounts of their migration out of India. In the historian Hamza of Esfahan’s version (c. 950), Bahram Gor, a Sasanian Perisan king, persuaded the king of India to send 12,000 Zott musicians, the Romany ancestors, to entertain his troops in 400 C.E. The appearance of “Egyptians,” as they were often called in the Balkans and later in Eastern Europe, is usually associated with the great struggles among warring empires in which the Roma played only a minor service role, according to later historians. Most of the accounts describing their appearance in the Balkans coincide with advances or declines of the Byzantine Empire. For example, in some accounts the Byzantines brought the Zotts to Constantinople as slaves from their raids on Syria in 855. In other accounts the Seljuk Turks drove them into the Western Byzantine Empire beginning in the mideleventh century during their raids into Armenia. Some hold them to be remnants of the Ottoman Turks attached to the invading armies who lingered in Eastern Europe after a defeat of the Byzantine empire in 1071, and many early Europeans simply identiWed them with heathen Saracens. In the Middle Ages, the myths and legends that grew up around the Egyptians often reXected the protoracism inherent in Christian biblical genealogies: They were descendants of Ham, forever marked by the sins of Cain; they had denied succor to the Holy Family as it Xed into Egypt and so were cursed to wander the world to atone for their refusal; they were the Egyptians of the old Testament, who, Ezekiel prophesized, would be dispersed among the nations; they had denied their Christian faith and were being punished by forced pilgrimage for Wve years, or ten, or forever; they were survivors of the Pharaoh’s armies that had driven the Hebrews out of Egypt; or, Wnally, they were a people forever cursed after they participated in the death of the Christ by making the nails with which he was cruciWed.7 By comparing early Romany history and early European preracism, we see also that the arrival of Romany groups in Central Europe coincided with the earliest versions of the myth of pre-Adamic peoples or, as it was commonly called, polygeny, which Kenan Malik has shown was crucial in the formation of the modern meaning of race. Already in the fourteenth century, European philosophers were beginning to challenge biblical genealogies that traced all human origins to one man, speculating that Adam may have been preceded by other groups of people perhaps originating in India rather than the Middle East. The discovery of new continents with indigenous peoples lacking all knowledge of either classical or biblical genealogies widened speculation about race and fueled debates about a universal descent from Adam. Religious genealogies were gradually replaced or fused\n\n[5]\n\n00front.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 6\n\nintroduction\n\nwith new discourses on race that came to be used more and more as a measure of sameness and difference and ultimately as justiWcation for further marginalizing minorities or subjugating conquered peoples. Peoples were still forced into slavery based on whether they were thought to be sons of Adam. For example, American Indians won this lottery to the detriment of Africans imported to South America as slaves. But decisions affecting whole populations increasingly relied on the degree of perceived whiteness and other physiological or atavistic characteristics, thus giving rise to the complex racial classiWcations that would become so important to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century thinkers. This shift in myths became especially pronounced during the Enlightenment with the rise of the new sciences of man, notably physical anthropology and linguistics. The establishment of the family tree of Indo-European languages dates at least as far back as William Jones’s 1788 essay on Sanskrit. Sanskrit studies fueled the complex theories that fused biblical and anthropological accounts of human descent. In the late 1700s Immanuel Kant sought, as others did, to Wnd modern validation for the Great Flood. Reasoning that Tibet was the cradle of civilization since it had the highest mountains, Kant speculated that Noah’s ark must have landed there. This turned out to be a useful argument for German nationalists seeking to valorize German’s Aryan derivation. If Noah’s ark had landed in India and not in the Middle East, then the “Indo-Germanic” race would be able to claim the most direct, least contaminated link with human origins. Many of the earliest arguments about the racial purity of the German race were linked with such reasoning about Noah’s connection to the Aryan race. Poliakov speculates that in part the turn to India was an effort to devise a rival origin to that of the Hebrew pantheon, in other words, the shift had protoracist undertones. Eventually, German thinkers lined up to “extricate [themselves] from Judeo-Christian fetters.”8 For example, Johann Gottfried Herder, in Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit (Outlines of the philosophy of the history of man, 1784–91), was one of several contemporary German scholars who vigorously denied a Hebrew genealogy in favor of an Indian pantheon. Ironically, during this time when some European nations were redesigning their myths of origin in favor of an Aryan ascendance, linguists were busy verifying the Indian origin of the Romani language. Romani dialects Wrst became an object of interest in 1775–76 when a series of articles in a German-language Hungarian journal, the Wiener Anzeigen (Viennese notices), reported that a Hungarian pastor named István Váli had noticed an afWnity between Romani and the dialect of Malabar students attending the University of Leiden.9 A few years later Heinrich Grellmann in Die Zigeuner (The Gypsies, 1782) ventured the theory that the groups he loosely identiWed as Zigeuner were a separate people who, based on linguistic studies, could be traced to an Indian homeland. For the next hundred\n\n[6]\n\n00front.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 7\n\nintroduction\n\nyears, linguists would examine more closely the Romani dialects of Eastern Europe and ratify Grellmann’s conclusion that Gypsies were racially akin to Indians. By 1870 when Alexandre Paspati published his inXuential Études sur les Tchinghianés ou bohémiens de l’Empire Ottoman (Studies on the Gypsies or Bohemians of the Ottoman Empire), which purported to trace the earliest migrations of the Roma, it was generally accepted by philologists that Romani and certain Indian languages had a common Sanskrit origin. It then became expedient to distinguish the strains of Sanskrit to differentiate the groups that had migrated out of India and to establish a hierarchy of Indo-European peoples in which Gypsies, thought to be descendants of the pariah or low caste, were either excluded or assigned to the lowest category of migratory groups. Like their Enlightenment predecessors, the Romantics expressed great admiration for Indian language, philosophy, architecture, and religion. By the beginning of the nineteenth century the cult of Indian culture had reached an apogee with Carl Schlegel’s 1808 essay Über die Sprache und die Weisheit der Indier (On the language and wisdom of the Indians). But with the rise of the physical sciences and the concomitant waning of the importance of biblical genealogies, philologists and anthropologists began devising other classiWcatory systems besides language to assess the value and origins of marginal groups. Depending on their lifestyles and professions, for example, groups were scaled on a grid with nature on one end and civilization and progress on the other. For some nineteenth-century thinkers, Gypsies represented a valuable link with nature that had been lost to modern societies. In 1882 the British philologist Charles G. Leland praised the wanderers he met along country byways who inhabited the scenery instead of houses. If you long to be a bird Xying south for the winter, he rhapsodized, then you are not far from the spirit of the Bohemians: “They are human, but in their lives they are between man as he lives in houses and the bee and bird and fox, and I cannot help believing that those who have no sympathy with them have none for the forest and road and cannot be rightly familiar with the witchery of wood and wold.”10 Gypsies should be treasured instead of reviled, he reasoned, since they represent links “which connect the simple feeling of nature with romance.”11 Like children they lack the words to express the “sense of nature and its charm, but they have this sense, and there are very, very few who, acquiring culture, retain it.”12 For Leland and some of his Gypsyphile friends, there was an afWnity between Gypsies and a vanishing femininity that everywhere was being replaced by intellect and fashion. If Gypsies could be imagined as a prelapsarian people who lived in happy communion with nature, as Leland and many others of his generation imagined them, then hatred of Gypsies would be akin to hatred of dogs or trees. The problem is, of course, that hating dogs and trees might seem foolish to a Gypsyologist like Leland, but liking or disliking animals or plants\n\n[7]\n\n00front.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 8\n\nintroduction\n\nwas a matter of taste, not of social justice, and justice for Gypsies was in short supply in Leland’s England. What struck Leland most about modern-day Gypsies was the fact that they were wanderers. In Poliakov’s opinion, this fascination with the wandering Gypsy is related to man’s primitive narcissism, the universal aspiration to recover an archaic stage before individuation. Exalting nature was also an affront to the JudeoChristian religions that had endeavored to establish man as “a creature apart—a ‘cultural’ as opposed to a ‘natural’ being.”13 In short, Gypsies were “natural” men if not altogether “noble” savages. Since Leland and other early anthropologists and linguists believed that the Roma were descendants of an undetermined Indian peripatetic group, speculating about their origins and wanderings became a challenging and exciting pastime. Leland’s theory was that Gypsies descended from the warrior Jats who centuries earlier had migrated from India westward into Syria and eventually Europe, acquiring the habits and professions of the people with whom they came into contact and bequeathing them atavistically to their descendants. Already in the eleventh century, their “callings” were hereditary, and they exhibited an inveterate attachment to certain unfortunate “habits.” In a move that we will see is typical of most writings on Gypsies, Leland mixes “callings” or professions together with “habits” or group traits in his description of the earliest Gypsies. They were, he reported, “without religion,” “notorious thieves,” and “of the horse horsey.”14 Before leaving India, Leland further speculated, Gypsies had intermingled with other groups like the Dom or Domarr, a pre-Aryan group who reportedly were basket weavers, heavy drinkers, carrion eaters, nomads, shepherds, and robbers. Later they came into contact with the Luri of Persia, a group of “thieves, fortune-tellers, and minstrels.” Descendants of these Luri still roam in Syria, Turkey, and Rumania where they are kidnappers and pilferers whose “principal pastimes are drinking, dancing, and music.”15 While such speculations about the relation between ancient peoples and their modern-day descendants may shock modern sensibilities, we must remember that belief in atavism was commonplace among early social scientists. For example, ever since the earliest discovery of the Indo-European origin of the German language, German scholars had sought to endow their Aryan ancestors with qualities that magniWed those they most admired in themselves. It follows that early Gypsyologists should try to link what they perceived as the modern Gypsy character to an imagined Indian prototype. In most accounts the Gypsy prototype was the pariah caste of Indians, who even before migrating from Northern India had constituted a doomed race. By demonstrating that the ancestors of the Gypsies descended from the pariah caste of India, with all of the negative traits that Leland ascribed to them, “governments and judicial authorities could legitimize their stigmatizing policies by invoking scientiWc arguments.”16 For many Spanish writers,\n\n[8]\n\n00front.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 9\n\nintroduction\n\non the other hand, it became important to establish that the Gypsies (or Gitanos, as they are generally called in Spain) originated in Egypt, not India, which further exoticized them and thus distinguished them from non-Spanish Gypsies. But this “distinction” did not translate into better treatment for the Spanish Romany any more than an Indian pedigree helped the Zigeuner avoid racial scapegoating in other European countries.\n\nThe Intransigence of Gypsy Myths Another important question that dogs cultural anthropologists is why some myths are so enduring. Solutions to this riddle can be roughly divided into two groups. In our post-Freudian era myths of origin are often described as a natural response that reXects the “permanent conXict which dwells in the heart of every human being.”17 According to Sander Gilman, creating stereotypes is a coping device that helps to overcome anxiety,18 and in his critical study of Orientalism Edward Said remarked that it is “perfectly natural for the human mind to resist the assault on it of untreated strangeness” by exoticizing the other.19 Poliakov urges us to relate the aspiration to discover origins with an “urge to recover the euphoria which characterizes the most archaic stage before individuation,” in other words, a narcissistic stage preceding subjectivity before the separation of man and nature.20 Even those who are invested in showing the nefarious consequences of these myths often recognize their stubborn prevalence as a naturally occurring phenomenon. However, while Léon Poliakov’s The Aryan Myth convincingly distinguishes Europe’s myths of origins and their modern permutations, detailing how and why certain changes in the myths take place, his explanation for the compulsion to invent myths of origin is vague, invoking a kind of collective psychology based on a failed Oedipality that can lead to pathological consequences (for example, as manifested in the Third Reich). Certainly understanding and preventing the radical effects of this compulsion in its most paranoid stages require a recognition of basic psychological responses. Yet granting the compulsion ontological status is not as important as recognizing that some eras are more prone to regressive tendencies than others, because they are overdetermined by material, economic, and political factors. Seeing the myth-making process as satisfying a deep psychological need without simultaneously taking into consideration regional economic and cultural realities leads to a dead-end acceptance of man’s innate tendency to engage in intergroup conXict. Accepting that there is a deep psychological need to create myths of origin as part of the process of establishing or afWrming afWnity does not adequately explain why it is that Gypsies (or other pariah groups) have been cast for so long as the outsiders even though they may have resided in a given place for centuries.\n\n[9]\n\n00front.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 10\n\nintroduction\n\nA second strategy for explaining the perpetuation of Gypsy myths is to avoid or diminish discussion of human compulsion and attribute the myth-making phenomenon to political and economic expediency. Myths of racial superiority then become part of a national false consciousness, a means to justify the dominance of some groups over others, part of the ideological ballast that is the effect of an imbalance of power and wealth. In this sense there is nothing “natural” about a group’s need to justify itself; the causes are to be located in the material conditions that should take center stage as providing the most accurate information about the history of inequality. Arguing that there is a natural compulsion to estrange oneself from the other, or that xenophobia and the demonizing of the other are universally characteristic of kinship relations, may indeed be valid, but still cannot tell us all we need to know to combat inequity and understand its structural complexities. One of the problems with Gypsy studies, according to Wim Willems, is that there is a communis opinio about the origin, status, and habits of Gypsies.21 The study of Gypsies has been plagued for the last 200 years by this tendency to collapse all Gypsies into a monolithic ethnic identity. There seems to be an unfortunate universal agreement about the label “Gypsy” that has impeded rational discussion of origin, assimilation, persecution, and miscegenation: “The most important cause for the failure of the historical picture to admit change is that most writers about Gypsies accept the premise that they constitute one people with a number of Wxed characteristics.”22 The following chapters trace the evolution of a cultural icon that, I argue, helped to color and sustain the frozen historical picture that Willems and others complain is so intransigent. My contention is, Wrst, that the cultural representation of the Gypsy provides historians a useful grounding for the study of both the evolution of European nationalisms and the complicated relations among Europe’s nations, and, second, that Spain’s role in this evolution is especially key for understanding the Gypsy stereotype. In the broadest terms, Spanish culture has had a dual relation with the foundational narrative of Orientalism, both as a culture that repressed a constitutive element of its historical identity, projecting it onto the Wgure of the exoticized Gypsy, and one that has represented, since the 1700s onward, an exoticized other to its Northern European counterparts.23 To understand fully the role that the internal colonization of the Spanish Roma played in the construction of Spanish nationalism, cultural critics need to analyze the economic and productive forces that impinge on discursive practices that in turn participate in the construction of national identity. Recognizing the interdeterminancy of Welds of representation––visual, literary, musical, historical, and anthropological––exposes the constructedness of the imaginary Spanish Gypsy. But to see this symbolic interface in its proper light, as a form of cultural capital\n\n[10]\n\n00front.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 11\n\nintroduction\n\nwith determined exchange values, we also need to analyze the historical contexts for the deWnitions of Gypsyness. It is especially important to trace the collapse of Gypsy identities into Andalusian identity, which by the twentieth century came to stand for Spanishness both outside and, to an extent, inside Spain’s cultural arena. The construction of the imaginary Gypsy depended on both intercultural and interdisciplinary dialogue that until now has eluded us because of approaches that are overly focused on a single culture or framed within a single disciplinary approach. Edward Said’s work has demonstrated how colonialism and imperialism are facilitated by emphasizing difference and stratiWcation. In the case of the Roma, who in early chronicles are usually described as invaders rather than conquered peoples, we must speak of an interior rather than a foreign colonization, a selfcolonization that nevertheless resembles other forms of imperialism in speciWc ways. Nation building and nationalism have a direct impact on the way dominant groups construct marginalized ethnic groups simultaneously as diseased members of a body that should be if not amputated at least quarantined, or, conversely, as exotic assets to some imaginary pluralist society. With the waning of Enlightenment universalism that sought to transcend human differences,24 racial difference and inequality had to be explained by other means than mere cultural differences, and the result was a scientiWc racism that relied on empirical data to stratify populations. Science was called on to explain the inequities and differences endemic in rising capitalist societies, and it obliged by explaining the Roma’s social degradation by recourse to physiological inferiority. Ethnic identity in the modern sense is an offspring of the process of state formation; when nationalism is on the rise in a given state, issues of difference generally gain prominence, and ethnic myths proliferate. When measured against the progress and patriotism of a dominant group, the disenfranchised of a nation are bound to suffer in comparison. The otherness of the disenfranchised group is then often maximized, or in some instances sanitized and provisionally subsumed into the national identity when there is an incentive to do so for reasons of exchange of cultural or economic capital. Where we Wnd this otherness prominently manifested is in the discursive practices of emerging capitalist states where Gypsies were always imagined in permanent exile from some other place beyond national borders, even when, in fact, their Romany groups had been residents for many generations. One of the things that makes Gypsies so interesting but also so difWcult to study is that they are what Benedict Anderson has recently described as both an “unbound seriality,”25 by which he means a broad or “open-to-the-world” group that has its origins in the print media, such as nationalists, anarchists, or bureaucrats, and at the same time a “bound seriality” like Tutsis or Asian Americans. However, to show how these categories are causally related, it is valuable to go\n\n[11]\n\n00front.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 12\n\nintroduction\n\nbeyond this dyad and to distinguish three discursive categories that have achieved great symbolic prominence in discussions of Spanish culture. The Wrst, “gypsies” with a lower-case g, roughly corresponds to a Romantic construction that still abounds in contemporary cultures. Anyone who exhibits nomadic or rebellious tendencies can be classiWed a gypsy; gypsies can be from anywhere and nowhere; there are gypsy scholars, bohemian (bourgeois) artists, and gypsy “kings,” all of whom have no ethnic afWnity with the Roma. And the imaginary Bohemia that these “gypsies” inhabit, as Evelyn Gould points out, “has accomplished its imperial goal, expanding its frontiers to embrace today’s Europe. . . . Bohemia continues to be conceived still today as the social performance that both dramatizes ambivalence about cultural identity and legitimates ambivalent cultural response.”26 In other words, it is still desirable to identify with the freedom-loving, restless vagabond as Gypsies have been imagined, beginning with Miguel de Cervantes’ novella “La gitanilla” (The little Gypsy girl). The second category, the subject of this study that most Payo (non-Roma) historians and writers designate as Gypsies with an uppercase G (or Gitanos, when referring exclusively to Spanish Romany groups), is a racialized designation that refers to any number of ethnic groups as they are imagined by nonmembers of those groups. It is, nevertheless, ideologically aligned with the previous category. Already in the seventeenth century Spanish counselors of state, concerned with questions of blood and legitimacy, were debating whether Gypsies were a race or a self-selected confederation of thieves, tinkers, musicians, or fortune-tellers. As we shall see in Chapter 1, Cervantes’ contemporary Sancho de Moncada was ambiguous about Gypsy racial status. On the one hand he claimed that Gypsies were merely rufWans who banded together as thieves and ought to be exterminated. Yet he sprinkled his text with citations of the Bible implying that Gypsies descended from the Egyptians whom God had cast out into the world to atone for their sins. Gypsies as a racialized category came into clearest focus in the nineteenth century with the rise of physical anthropology that distinguished groups according to the “hard” aspects of ethnicity, such as phenotypical difference, cranium size, facial features, and language. With the discovery of the Sanskrit origin of Romani dialects and the work of Heinrich Grellmann, it was no longer fashionable to speak of Gypsy speech as a rogue’s tongue, or jerigonza as it is called in Spanish, and historians and philologists rallied to construct a more modern (nonbiblical, scientiWcally based) myth of origin that still holds among many scholars: Gypsies are descendants of pariahs who left northern India sometime during the Wfth to the tenth centuries. Their diaspora continues, according to nineteenth-century historians, because they observe strict endogamous practices and taboos against intermarriage with Gorgios, Gadjés, Busnés, Payos (the various designations for non-Roma). Coupled with the centuries-old negative stereotyping, the imagined\n\n[12]\n\n00front.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 13\n\nintroduction\n\npurity of the Gypsy race encouraged communities to isolate and often stigmatize their Romany communities, reinforcing negative conclusions regarding their patriotism, religious practices, and ability to be honest, productive citizens. In his “objective” classiWcation of degenerate types in L’uomo delinquente (Criminal man, 1876), the Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso relied on racialized categorizations, claiming that criminality was a consequence of atavistic biological stigmata and that certain races, like Gypsies, were more predisposed to crime than others. The Spanish social anthropologist Rafael Salillas in El delincuente español. El lenguaje (The Spanish delinquent: The language; 1896) concurred, reporting that Gypsies by nature and occupation were more akin to the delinquent than to the normal elements of society.27 The nefarious consequences of this racialization of the Roma occurred during World War II when hundreds of thousands of Roma perished, many exterminated in the Nazi death camps. The third category is most commonly referred to in English as Roma, Romá, Romani, Romany, or Travellers, subsets of which are the subjects that modern social scientists endeavor to study independently of the Wctions, stereotypes, or racialized thinking associated with the other two categories. Twentieth-century cultural and social anthropologists reject received stereotypes and avoid references to ancient cultures, bloodlines, racial purity, and other pseudoscientiWc designations and instead examine the conditions and relations of speciWc ethnic groups, such as the Romanichals, Kalderash, or Spanish Calés, with their non-Roma neighbors. For today’s social scientists ethnic identities are more usefully thought of as instrumentalist or functionalist rather than primordial, since race has been shown to be a very inadequate marker of ethnicity. Although Romany groups inhabit every European country, twentiethcentury social anthropologists have until recently not been eager to study them because they were not considered an altogether separate culture; that is, they were not exotic because they were “too close to home for comfort.”28 Students of modern anthropology often avoided or were discouraged from choosing Romany groups for Weldwork because they resided in an anthropologically uninteresting Europe. In recent decades, however, dozens of social anthropological studies have begun to appear, such as Isabel Fonseca’s controversial Bury Me Standing or, in Spain, Teresa de San Román’s Gitanos de Madrid y Barcelona (The Gypsies of Madrid and Barcelona; 1984) and La diferència inquietant (The disquieting difference; 1994). Anthropologists may argue certain universals, for instance, that the Roma constitute an ethnic identity bound on the one hand by an often strict, self-imposed exclusivity, and on the other by centuries of repression, persecution, and ghettoization. But they also recognize that each Romany group has a geography of limited expanse, a national identity, and a history bound up with the histories of European nation-states that too often belittle, diminish, or overlook altogether their participation.\n\n[13]\n\n00front.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 14\n\nintroduction\n\nThe reason that I call this category discursive, however, is not to divorce the term from its historical referent, but to argue that even the most objective, consciously unbiased analysis of Romany communities too often slips into harmful generalizations. Anthropologists have a tendency to abstract universals from the study of samplings that are too small and too local, and through the uncritical citation of dubious sources cultural historians as well as social scientists have unwittingly perpetuated ancient stereotypes and generalizations that obscure the true relations and complex realities of the Romany populations they analyze. Recent studies critical of the theoretical underpinnings of ethnology highlight the need to broaden interdisciplinary approaches to the study of ethnic identity. The interdependency of the three categories described above is complex and resilient, and it would be a mistake to study any one of them in isolation from the other two. Perhaps the cultural critic, poised at the intersection of cultural anthropology and cultural criticism, can best gauge the co-determinacy of nationalism and symbolic practices. But this is the case only if all the many determinants of ethnicity are also taken into account: economic factors that compound racism; cultural conventions and traditions that get translated into historical verities and vice versa; competing nationalisms and their colonialist aspirations; hysterical reactions to the Industrial Revolution; evolving gender codes; and, Wnally, the Romany participation in their own isolation from, or assimilation into, national identity. It is in the lateral shifts in European consciousness back and forth from one category to the other that we can start to see the political stakes of all three: how the unbound category of the gypsy, a Romantic fantasy based and proliferated in the world of print culture, music, and graphic representation, inXects the more bounded categories of Roma that are the subject of modern anthropology and history; how the passionate, freedom-loving gypsy gets superimposed on the diasporic Gypsy communities mistakenly imagined as culturally and racially isolated from the non-Roma; and how the latter affect the Romany subclassiWcations used by today’s cultural anthropologists who focus on Romany participation in urban and industrial economies and their complex cultural and social interrelation with the Gorgios. In the following chapters I use the term “Gypsy” or “Gitano” to refer to the cultural constructs that are the subject of this book, including the Gypsy image that some history books and anthropological studies have constructed, and I reserve the terms “Roma” or “Romany” (the adjective) to refer to real subjects whom most non-Roma still refer to as Gypsies.29 Although often referred to as a Romantic construct, the Spanish Gypsy is not in any simple way the creation of the French Romantics. The icon as traced here evolved from the travel of print/visual/musical culture back and forth across the Pyrenees, beginning even before Cervantes’ “La gitanilla” (1613), which is the subject of Chapter 1. It relied on historical documents as distant as Sebastian\n\n[14]\n\n00front.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 15\n\nintroduction\n\nMünster’s Cosmographia (Cosmography; 1544) or Heinrich Grellmann’s Die Zigeuner (The Gypsies; 1782), and as local as the acrimonious treatises of the seventeenthcentury Spanish arbitristas (counselors of state) such as Fray Melchor de Huélamo, Manuel Fernández de Córdoba, Martín Del Río, and Sancho de Moncada, who deWned the Gypsy “problem” for a struggling nation in need of scapegoats. Subsequent chapters trace how the Spanish Gypsy gained special prominence in the fabulous accounts of the nineteenth-century Bible salesman George Borrow, who borrowed heavily from Golden Age sources as well as living informants and philologists to create a veritable encyclopedia of known Gypsyology. In turn, Borrow bequeathed many, if not all, of the loathsome or fabulous stereotypes that quickly got grafted onto Preciosa’s Romantic progeny: Guiseppe Verdi’s Azucena, Prosper Mérimée’s Carmen, Ambroise Thomas’s Mignon, George Eliot’s Fedalma, George Sand’s Moréna, and Victor Hugo’s Esmeralda all owe something to Borrow’s picaresque imagination. In modern European systems of musical, visual, and literary representation, which are the legacy of Romantic idealizations, a host of female Wgures stand out above all others and can be said to make up the nuclei of the imaginary Gypsy. For example, new versions of Carmen, Esmeralda, and Moréna continue to re-create and, in ways I discuss at length here, reshape the myth. In addition to gender, they are linked together by many characteristics drawn from the pool of Gypsy stereotypes that has arisen from the seventeenth century onward. Except for Mignon, part of their enduring exotic appeal resides in their Spanishness, and one of the objects of this book is to discuss the relevance both of the fact that women have borne the heavy symbolic load of the unbound category of Gypsyness, and the tendency for Europe to look to southern Spain to fulWll its desire for an exotic other. To explain this phenomenon, the closing chapters of this book address the way Spain participated in its self-exoticization via the Wgure of the Andalusian Gypsy. As the Wnal chapter argues, Spanish philologists and folklorists also perpetuated Borrow’s concept of the Wctitious Gypsy, even when their stated intention was to correct his vision with that of a more “authentic” Gypsy based on historically accurate texts and scientiWc observation.\n\n[15]\n\n00front.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 16\n\n01chap1.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 17\n\n1 Cervantes’ Precious Jewel of Love\n\n¿What good are they to the world? ––fray huélamo 1\n\nthe arrival of roma “pilgrims” in Spain, in groups of ten to one hundred, accompanied by their counts and dukes, took place in the early Wfteenth century. Letters of safe passage that provided nominal protection from local reprisals and persecutions, and in some instances material assistance, facilitated their early travel.2 This era of safe conduct ended by the sixteenth century and was followed by a period of persecution, beginning with the Catholic kings’ royal decree (the Pragmática of 1499), mandating that within a period of two months Gypsies who did not settle in Wxed domiciles, serve a master, take a profession, and relinquish their language and dress, would face expulsion or perpetual slavery.3 The Wrst examination of what is termed here the “imaginary” Spanish Gypsy dates not from the Wfteenth-century migrations that resulted in the 1499 Pragmática, however, but from what has been called the Golden Age of Spanish literature, when Spain’s ethnic politics produced catastrophic upheavals among Spanish Roma, Moors, and the remnants of the Jewish population who had not been expelled by the Catholic monarchs. The way that Golden Age texts articulated ethnic otherness reveals that the debate about the value of marginal groups to the nation was in full swing by\n\n[ 17]\n\n01chap1.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 18\n\nthe spanish gypsy\n\nthe early seventeenth century, during a critical time in the development of Spanish statehood. Much of what in later centuries counted as knowledge about Spanish Gypsies originated in this era more golden in its discourses than its coffers, despite the massive inXux of bullion from the American colonies. The stereotype of the thieving, conniving Gypsy helped to link what was mysterious or unknown about the peripatetic, nonconformist Roma groups with other threats to the nation’s economic and moral well-being: Barbary pirates, groups of roving bandoleros (highwaymen), the urban pícaro (rogue), and especially, according to José Antonio Maravall, the mounting “passion for lucre” that was gripping Spain.4 It was during this difWcult time that Miguel de Cervantes published his popular collection of Novelas ejemplares (Exemplary novels; 1610–13), which included one of the Wrst sketches of Gypsy life, “La gitanilla” (The Gypsy girl). What is noteworthy about Cervantes’ novella in this context is its ambivalent racial ideology; it insisted on the racial difference of Gypsies, contributing enormously to the perpetuation of the mostly negative Gypsy stereotypes that were circulating at the time, while it challenged that difference by offering knowledge about select Gypsies that was irreducible to any common racial stereotype. Thus it offered both a recognition of Gypsy racial difference and a disavowal of that difference through a linking of Gypsies with other nonracially differentiated groups. Although clearly inXuenced by the accusatory political discourses of its time, “La gitanilla” owed its appeal to its celebration of humanist ideals that transcended racial categories. At the same time, responding to a literature in search of “novel” themes, in the last instance it reestablished the radical difference that would separate Gypsies from the educated Payos or nonGypsies who wrote about them for centuries to come. Cervantes was not the Wrst to apprise readers of Gypsy difference in manner, dress, speech, and occupations. Several dozen allusions, all very brief, appeared in sixteenth-century Spanish and Portuguese literary texts. These include Celestina (1499), possibly the Wrst mention of Gypsies in Spanish literature, and Farça das Ciganas (A Gypsy farce; 1521), a comedy by the Portuguese playwright Gil Vicente, featuring the Wrst theatrical appearance of the Gypsy.5 Other examples following these two early works are Diego de Negueruela’s Farsa llamada Ardamisa (A farce called Ardamisa), written in the early 1500s; Juan de Timoneda’s Comedia llamada Aurelia (A comedy called Aurelia; 1564); Mateo Alemán’s Guzmán de Alfarache (1599); Lorenzo Palmireno’s Estudioso Cortesano (The studious courtesan; 1573); and Lope de Rueda’s Comedia llamada Medora (A comedy called Medora) and Eufemia (1567), to name just a few.6 All the classic Gypsy motifs of Golden Age Spanish literature are already tested in these early works: from fortune-telling, singing, magic, and dancing, to pickpocketing, baby snatching, horse trading, and highway robbery. Still, most of the allusions to Gypsies in Spanish interludes, plays, and novellas that appeared during the seventeenth century were inspired by\n\n[ 18]\n\n01chap1.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 19\n\ncervantes’ precious jewel of love\n\nCervantes’ comedy Pedro de Urdemalas and his immensely popular novellas “La gitanilla” and “Coloquio de los Perros” (The dogs’ colloquium), written in the Wnal decades of the sixteenth or beginning of the seventeenth century and published in 1613.7 To the list of stock motifs Cervantes added several of special interest here because of their implications for a non-Roma audience and for their novel representation of Gypsies: the idealization of a peripatetic lifestyle, the parasitical relation between Gypsies and the ruling classes, the marked contrast between male and female occupations and economies, the codes for family and group protocols governing interracial alliances or “conversions” of non-Gypsies to Gypsy status, and the debate about inheritable attributes. As creator of what we could call the glamorization of the Gypsy woman, “La gitanilla” established a strong contrast between the thieving, abject members of the race and one exceptional and beautiful woman. Preciosa somehow stands out from all the rest, as if the author wished to skim off all of the goodness and beauty from a whole race, the better to concentrate it in this one precious specimen who is more beautiful than the rest, who earns more money, dances and sings better, and loves more honestly and deeply. This is how at Wrst we perceive Cervantes’ character: a rare exception amid a group of scoundrels and thieves. The thievery taught to her by her presumptive grandmother seems not to have stuck to her, and neither the weather nor the blistering sun has managed to “spoil the face or roughen the hands” of this blond, green-eyed beauty.8 Of course, if the Gypsy Preciosilla seems too good to be true, it is because she is not: Her real name is Constanza de Azevedo y de Meneses, the kidnapped daughter of the wealthy magistrate of Murcia. Once removed from her Gypsy heritage, something the text subtly allows readers to do almost at once, there is very little left to commend the Gypsies who populate this work, perhaps with the exception of the old Gypsy man who eulogizes the Gypsy way of life or the old woman who, to save the life of Andrés and ensure Preciosa’s future happiness, confesses that she had stolen Preciosa. In selecting a woman heroine unwittingly masquerading as a Gypsy, Cervantes was playing to a literary taste for Romanesque plots. The choice of a band of Gypsies as his heroine’s foil, however, also permitted him to play with popular misconceptions and stereotypes that were sure to engage his reading public in the dialectic about the negative role of the Roma in the nation’s Xagging economy. Cervantes was certainly aware that interest in the Roma minority intensiWed in the early 1600s as Spain entered a general era of decline. It is important for modern readers to recognize that although it has been termed the Golden Age, the Spain of 1613 was not the Spain of the prosperous 1500s. Trade with the Americas was increasingly in the hands of the Genovese and other foreigners; the debt of the monarch and the nobles was soaring, while the population was in steep decline. Emigration and displacement, with the resulting depopulation of formerly\n\n[ 19]\n\n01chap1.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 20\n\nthe spanish gypsy\n\nprosperous rural areas, were affecting agricultural production: Some areas of Castile were being abandoned completely, drastically reducing the crown’s revenues. Then, between 1596 and 1602, a nearly bankrupt Spain suffered a catastrophic epidemic that resulted in 600,000 deaths in Castile alone. The unfavorable peace treaty signed with England in 1604 and the 1609 truce with the United Provinces of the Netherlands were, in the words of the historian John Elliott, the direct result of Spain’s “Wnancial, economic, and psychological exhaustion.”9 The decrease in silver revenues from Mexico and Peru during the second decade of the century resulted in chronic shortages for the royal treasury at a time when the lavish court expenses of Philip III were escalating.10 By levying more taxes, however, the crown was contributing to the depopulation of rural areas and the decrease in revenue-producing agriculture. With Spain’s commercial decline, rampant inXation, excessive taxation, and fall in agricultural productivity, little wonder that countless vagabonds and bands of roving outlaws, the bandoleros of literary fame, roamed the countryside of Catalonia, Castile, and Valencia, while cities, especially Seville, saw an inXux of unemployed or underemployed laborers.11 In the south, the legendary picaroon was a social, not just a literary, phenomenon. The rise of both vagabondage and bandolerismo or highway robbery in Spain at the time Cervantes wrote “La gitanilla” has been cited to account for the fear of Roma groups that is evident in this and other seventeenth-century texts featuring Gypsies. Though small in numbers, the Roma had obviously become a handy scapegoat for the ofWcial ideology of the Counter Reformation, or, as Bernard Leblon put it: “If three thousand Gypsies managed nearly to eclipse the masses of vagabonds, deserters, and highwaymen to become the Wgure of the primary national calamity it is because one found in them a symbol.”12 For a nation struggling to identify itself as a uniWed, racially homogeneous people, the Roma symbolized the recalcitrant other, both despised and celebrated for their indifference to the well-being and laws of the nation. The collapsing of Gypsy identity into that of other disaffected groups is not a sign of a general mixing of indigent groups, although some intermingling surely did occur. Traveling or residing in closely knit, predominantly endogamous family groups, the early Roma were distinguishable from ordinary vagabonds, and, as the historians Teresa San Román and Henry Kamen have pointed out, they rarely associated with the bandoleros, who were made up of groups of returning soldiers, displaced foreigners, underemployed rural men who had lost their lands because of excessive taxation, career bandits, and lesser regional nobles and their vassals, who for one reason or another lived on the margins of society.13 What is clear is that the association of peripatetic Roma and non-Roma groups like the bandoleros at the hand of dominant ideologues and writers, as well as in the popular imagination, produced widespread antagonism that would have a lasting negative effect on Roma/Payo relations.14\n\n[ 20]\n\n01chap1.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 21\n\ncervantes’ precious jewel of love\n\nBecause peripatetic groups of Roma were conspicuous in their dress and customs, debates about expulsion versus assimilation coincided with this period of intense scapegoating. At the same time that Cervantes was entertaining readers with the exotic Gypsy ways of Preciosa and her ilk in “La gitanilla,” the laws of Spain were evolving in a campaign to assimilate forcibly all itinerants, Wrst by associating them in the public mind with worthless vagabonds and, following from that, calling for the regulation of their dress, travel, residences, professions, and language. During the reign of the Hapsburgs, the number of Roma who were hanged, imprisoned, kidnapped and placed with Spanish families, exiled from the country, sent to be galley slaves, or forced to work in the Almadén mines can never be calculated, but these repressive measures may have affected a large percentage of the Roma population and doubtless provided the Roma with a rationale for emphasizing their difference from dominant culture. Some punishments were the result of minor infractions and petty thievery, but various laws stipulated that a subject could be brought to justice merely by virtue of being declared a Gypsy. Laws that in previous decades had outlawed vagrancy—the most severe under Phillip II in 1586—were reissued or even expanded by the Cortes (the Spanish legislative assembly) during Cervantes’ lifetime to single out Roma groups. For example, in 1609, the same year that a decree ordering all those of Moorish descent to leave Spain resulted in the expulsion of some 275,000 subjects, Philip III ordered the expulsion of all those calling themselves Gypsies unless they settled in towns of more than one thousand inhabitants and adapted the dress and speech of the non-Roma residents. In 1610, the year Cervantes wrote “La gitanilla,” the Cortes decreed that Gypsies were not really Christians and not a separate people, merely thieves and murderers.15 DeWnitions such as this, based on an activity and behavior rather than a kinship group or culture, marked the beginning of a long process that would end in 1783 when Charles III decreed that there was no such thing as an ethnic Gypsy, that the term Gitano (Spanish Gypsy) was merely a derogatory name given to or assumed by bands of thieves. By implication people who were not thieves, those who had Wxed domiciles and occupations, were not, indeed could not be, Gypsies. As we shall see, however, in 1610 the issue of Gypsy identity was not so easily swept away.\n\nWho Are the Gypsies? Early seventeenth-century plays and prose Wction largely corroborated the royal court’s assessment of its Roma population as errant and reprehensible misWts. Through their overwhelmingly negative portraits of Gypsies, Lope de Vega’s El nacimiento de Cristo (The birth of Christ; before 1604) and Arenal de Sevilla (The\n\n[ 21]\n\n01chap1.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 22\n\nthe spanish gypsy\n\nbeach of Seville; 1618); Francisco López de Ubeda’s La pícara Justina (The rogue Justina; 1605); Vicente Espinel’s Marcos de Obregón (Marcos of Obregon; 1618); Gonzalo de Céspedes y Meneses’ Soldado Píndaro (Pindaro the soldier; 1626); and Jerónimo de Alcalá’s Donado hablador, ó Alonso, mozo de muchos amos (The chattering lay brother, or Alonso, the servant of many masters; 1626) reXected the scapegoating tactics of royal pronouncements and decrees that sought either to expel or to assimilate Roma groups. In addition, during these same years, numerous political tracts appeared that either justiWed the royal decrees published by the Cortes or promoted even more radical solutions to the “Gypsy problem” than the one the Cortes were seeking. Notable among these were Fray Melchor de Huélamo’s Libro primero, de la vida y milagros del glorioso confesor Sant Ginés de la Xara (Book 1 of the life and miracles of the glorious confessor Saint Gines de la Xara; 1607); Martín Del Río’s Disquisitionum magicarum libri sex (Book 6 of the Disquisition on magic; 1606); Sancho de Moncada’s Restauración política de España (Spain’s political restoration; 1619); Francisco Fernández de Córdoba’s Didascalia multiplex (A compendium of moral teachings; 1615); and Pedro Salazar de Mendoza’s Memorial de un hecho de los gitanos (Brief regarding a Gypsy affair; 1618). All these treatises viliWed Gypsies as a group and, unchallenged, were passed down to future historians as evidence of Gypsy ignominy. Religious leaders contributed to the notion of Gypsy deviance by casting doubt on the religious zeal of the Roma and noting their stubborn rejection of religious authority. For example, Fray Huélamo complained that Gypsies did not belong to a diocese and had no priests living among them. Nor did they go to confession, follow papal decrees, request dispensations to contract marriage, or purchase papal bulls.16 In keeping with their distress at the country’s economic downslide and their protobourgeois preoccupation with merit and civic usefulness, essayists like Huélamo complained most bitterly of the failure of the Gypsies to join a regulated workforce or to be of service to the nation as soldiers and farmers, and they suggested as a remedy forced service in the galleys: Leave aside that they know no trade, have no rents, and work no land, which means they are necessarily all thieves. . . . What good are they in the world? They are not acolytes, sacristans, clerics, or priests, nor are they mayors, councilmen, or constables. They are not town criers, nor games keepers. On the contrary, when they enter a town, people have to watch their homes so closely that they can’t even go to their Welds. They pay no taxes to the King, nor tithes to the Church. . . they are as useless during war as during peace time, they are totally unproductive, and do great harm, and yet even though the men never work, nor the women\n\n[ 22]\n\n01chap1.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 23\n\ncervantes’ precious jewel of love\n\nspin wool or make cloth, they are better dressed than other peasants, since they ordinarily wear garments festooned with what they have Wlched from some unlucky newly wed or some garment made for feast days. And, since they have no goods to conWscate, something much to be regretted, their crimes go unpunished. I Wnd no other use for them but the galleys, may they all be of some use there.17 All of the above-mentioned essayists concurred with Huélamo in their scorn of the Gypsies, but the question of exactly who the Gypsies were was open to debate. Numerous documents from the sixteenth century had reported that Gypsies readily admitted nonmembers into their ranks.18 This led seventeenth-century statesmen and writers to suggest that they were not a people, but a group of brigands. Martín del Río Wrst made this claim in 1606, quoting as his source Sebastian Münster’s 1552 Cosmographia Universalis. In turn Sebastián de Covarrubias y Orozco quoted Del Río in his inXuential Tesoro de la lengua castellana (Treasure of the Castilian language), which Sancho de Moncada cited in 1619. Together with Huélamo and Del Río, Moncada was among the group of self-styled economists and reformists known as the arbitristas (arbitristes or counselors of state) who published tracts regarding economic and social issues in an effort to stem what he declared was Spain’s precipitous “decline.” Besides mapping a program for economic reforms designed to increase commerce and encourage industrialization and agricultural production, the arbitristas often included suggestions for curing the social ills that, they argued, were contributing to the general decline of the Spanish nation.19 Moncada, a professor of Holy Scripture at the University of Toledo, justiWed his reform package with lengthy explanations for Spain’s spiritual and cultural malaise, and his Restauración is rife with the “hysterical xenophobia” that to a large extent characterized writings on Gypsies in the seventeenth century.20 Jean Vilar Berrogain, the modern editor of Restauración, concludes somewhat naively that Moncada was not a racist since he believed that Gypsies were not a racial minority, merely a sect that admitted members, a “pack of idlers” who, like “wolves,” know only how to rob and Xee.21 Disclaimers such as this, based on the idea that racism is a late eighteenth-century phenomenon, fail to take into account the devastating effects of scapegoating entire groups, including those who did not fall into the category of idlers condemned by Moncada. Undeniably race was a social not a biological category in the seventeenth century, but Spanish society was already organized as if races could be distinguished not just by cultural and economic criteria, but by parentage. At what age would the children of Gypsies be counted as idlers and thieves and thus conform to Moncada’s grouping? Examining Moncada’s text together with court decrees allows us to plumb the depths of\n\n[ 23]\n\n01chap1.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 24\n\nthe spanish gypsy\n\nseventeenth-century Gypsy stereotyping, which, if not consistently racist in the biological sense, provided ample justiWcation for the ill treatment of ethnic Roma for decades to come.22 The Eighth Discourse of Moncada’s Restauración, entitled “Expulsión de los Gitanos” (Expulsion of the Gypsies), begins with three biblical references, two to the Egyptians whom many at that time still considered the ancestors of the Gypsies. Thus even though he later argues that Gypsies are a sect and not a race, in a move not unlike that of Cervantes in “La gitanilla,” Moncada begins his discourse with quotations that have clear racial implications: Vidi afXictionen eorum, qua ab Aegyptiis opprimuntur; et scient Aegyptii quia ego Dominus (Exodus 3; 7) (I have seen their afXiction, of those oppressed by the Egyptians . . . and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord.) Haec dicit Dominus, dispergam Aegyptios in nationes, et ventilabo eos in terras (Ezekiel 29) (Thus saith the Lord God. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the lands.)23 Both Biblical excerpts recall the punishment of the Egyptians for their expulsion of the Israelites and, by inference, provide a somewhat novel explanation for the wanderings of Spanish Roma. In the popular imagination it was believed at the time either that the Gypsies had been expelled from Egypt because they had failed to assist the Holy Family as they Xed into Egypt or that they were doomed to wander the earth for a determined time because, although originally Christians, at one point they had renounced their faith.24 According to both versions, Church leaders had ordered them to wander the earth as penance for their neglect or lack of faith, and it was in the guise of pilgrims that they reportedly made their Wrst entry into Spain in the Wfteenth century.25 Moncada’s quotations, on the contrary, seem to suggest that Gypsies are pariahs, not because of their ancestors’ treatment of the Holy Family but because of their oppression of the Israelites—a somewhat ironic indictment given Spain’s expulsion and persecution of the descendants of the Israelites as well as Moncada’s repeated assertion that Gypsies are a sect, not a people.26 Chapter 1 of Discourse 8 of the Restauración, entitled “Quién son los Gitanos?” (Who are the Gypsies?), summarizes the legends concerning the migrations of Gypsies that were in circulation during Moncada’s time: that they entered Europe as Tamerlane’s soldiers, that they crossed over into Europe when Spain was\n\n[ 24]\n\n01chap1.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 25\n\ncervantes’ precious jewel of love\n\ninvaded by the Moors, or that they descended from the Tartars, Persians, Nubians of Lower Egypt, or other nations of Asia Minor. Brushing aside all these legends, Moncada asserts that “those who wander about Spain are not Gypsies, but rather swarms of idlers and atheists, and, without any religion whatsoever, Spaniards who have initiated themselves into this type of life or Gypsy sect.”27 Quoting the 1610 decree of the Royal Cortes, Moncada continues: “Let it be known that they are not a nation, may their name and its use be forever confounded and forgotten.”28 Yet everything in Moncada’s document serves to identify, not forget, the Gypsies and to widen the gulf between Gypsies and non-Gypsies. For example, he compares them to the class of birds called wagtails (aguzanieve or motacilla in Spanish), ugly birds, he reports, that lay their eggs in the nests of other birds.29 To an economist like Moncada who advocated stimulating manufacturing, one of the worst sins of the Gypsies was that they were unproductive: The men engaged in no commerce and had no Wxed professions; they were leeches who sucked the richness from the lands they crossed and sustained themselves on the sweat of others, while their women were prostitutes who destroyed many a good marriage with their dances, fortune-telling, magic spells, and singing.30 As spies, traitors, vagabonds, thieves, fortune-tellers, and heretics, all Gypsies deserved, according to Moncada, to be executed, and in this he goes far beyond the assimilationist recommendations of the Cortes. However, as an alternative to execution, a solution he knew to be unlikely, he recommended that all those calling themselves Gypsies be expelled from the nation, just as anything that does harm should be severed from the body politic. Thus Moncada argued against previous legislation mandating that Gypsies settle in large populations, where it was reasoned they could be better controlled. For him there was no advantage in having thieves residing in cities instead of roaming the countryside. And to those who argued that only the men should be expelled, Moncada countered that it was the women who commit the worst crimes of all; allowing women and children to stay behind would be an invitation for them to raise more “wolf cubs.” If it was right and just to expel the descendants of the Moors––and Moncada notes wistfully that the Moriscos were at least productive members of society––then surely it would be reasonable to expel all Gypsies. An even closer analogy can be made with the Jews: For Moncada the Gypsies are the “new” Jews because they have assumed all of the negative traits and habits of the expelled race. Accordingly he urges Philip III to deal with them as harshly as the Catholic Kings had dealt with the Jews “who sucked the Republic dry and gave nothing in return, who were thieves and receivers of stolen goods, witches, prognosticators, evildoers.”31 Moncada does not suggest what the king should do about settled Gypsies with Wxed employment or professions (as was the case with some Andalusian and Catalonian populations). We must infer, therefore, either that he was ignorant of their existence, a strong\n\n[ 25]\n\n01chap1.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 26\n\nthe spanish gypsy\n\npossibility given his other inaccuracies, or that he would not consider them Gypsies at all since they did not Wt his description of thieves and rogues, the conclusion Charles III would reach in the eighteenth century.32 Moncada concludes his diatribe with an exhortation in Latin, O Regum summe, horum plura ne temnas (absit) Ne forte tempsisse Hispaniae periculosum existat (O greatest of Kings, God forbid that you treat lightly more of these lest by chance it seems you have treated lightly a danger to Spain).33 Philip III, however, did not choose to follow Moncada’s harsh suggestion regarding this danger, and the 1633 Pragmática of his successor Philip IV put an end to the reiterated calls for expulsion. It was not humanitarian concern that prompted his decision: “It does not seem practical to expel them because the depopulation in which these lands Wnd themselves after the expulsion of the Moors, and which has resulted in our present condition, cannot suffer the least evacuation.”34 Political expediency won out in the end over xenophobic counselors: Spain simply could not afford to become any more depopulated or to lose skills the Roma offered. As a result, the strategy of forced settlement would be the policy for the next several centuries. From the above survey, it is easy to see why, compared with the legislators, writers, and essayists who were his contemporaries, Cervantes has been cited by critics for his sympathetic portrayal of Gypsies.35 But in the catalogue of muchcelebrated attributes and virtues that deWne Preciosa’s non-Gypsyness, we can nevertheless measure the loathing of the Gitano that was already widespread by the year 1613: In contrast to those around her Preciosa is clean, neat, and polite, honest and discrete, witty and wise, literate, chaste. All these attributes so heavily prized in seventeenth-century elite women are snatched away from the Gypsies when Preciosa turns out to be a lady. In contrast her cohorts, including her guardian who is a veritable “Argos,” are greedy, scheming thieves; better to close the book on them. It is pointedly left to Preciosa to do this in her summing up of the Gypsy mentality at the end of the novella: “They have the devil and experience as their tutors and teachers, and so they learn in an hour what you’d expect them to learn in a year.”36 Curious about the harshness of this and other statements in Cervantes’ other works, Luis Astrana Marín in his introduction to Don Quijote asks “What could the Gypsies have done to Miguel de Cervantes to make him upbraid them so pitilessly? Did they, by any chance, play him a bad turn during his years as commissioner in Andalusia, when he had to deal with so many farmers, millers, bakers, and all manner of riffraff?”37 Astrana Marín answers his own question in the negative by saying that the level of animosity can be explained only by something much more personal, alluding to the Cervantes’ family’s contentious relations with the Mendoza family who were part Roma. Astrana Marín then goes on to claim, however, that Cervantes’ treatment of Gypsies was in large sympathetic. Admittedly, the most worthwhile thing that the Gypsies possess in this story turns out to\n\n[ 26]\n\n01chap1.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 27\n\ncervantes’ precious jewel of love\n\nbe something they stole, yet “La gitanilla” expresses, perhaps for the Wrst time in European literature, and certainly in Spanish literature, an admiration for a certain kind of itinerant life together with a rejection of organized society based on an orderly transfer of goods and services. The famous homily delivered by a group elder sketches out the Gypsy worldview that resonates with the beatus ille theme common to Renaissance literature: We are the lords of the pastures, the ploughed Welds, the heaths, and the streams. The heath offers us free Wrewood; the trees fruit, the vineyards grapes; the gardens, vegetables; the streams, water, the rivers, Wsh, and the private estates, game; rocks offer us shade, mountain passes provide fresh air, caves give us housing. For us, inclement weather is an airing, snows cool us, rain bathes us, thunder offers us music, and lightning provides torches; for us, hard ground makes a soft mattress; our leathery skin is like an impenetrable chain-mail coat to defend us; our lightness of foot knows no shackles, no gullies stop us, no walls get in our way.38 Cervantes’ readers were widely familiar with the motif of the artiWcial court life versus the country idyll, with its appeal to the “natural primitive goodness of man.”39 The Gypsy “lords of the pastures” share the same imaginary space as the idealized shepherds of Arcadia, but in the case of the Gypsies such an ode to freedom would likely provoke both envy and reprobation on the part of readers. That the Gypsy lives a life in perfect harmony with nature, which for mostly urban readers must be mediated by an author’s words, is all to the good: It is one of the functions of poetry and literature in general to manifest the disjuncture between lived experience and the imagination. But that the Gypsy should receive free or steal what others worked for must have offended the emerging bourgeois mentality that Sancho de Moncada appealed to in his economic treatises. Unlike the shepherds and farmers who earned their natural setting, the arbitristas argued that the reason Gypsies exempted themselves from any organized labor or strict moral conduct was because their nature resembled that of wild, roaming animals. No shackles, ravines, or walls impeded their movement through real, not just imaginary spaces. Among these “born thieves,” as everyone from Moncada to Cervantes’ narrator described them, pickpocketing was a sanctioned art rather than an evil. Disregarding conventional codes of honor and the rituals of the court (such as currying favor with dignitaries), and self-exempted from the laws of the community, Gypsies were free to devise and enforce their own laws, punishments, and economies. For example, their marriage ceremony shunned the rituals of the Catholic Church; they permitted divorce and incest and punished adultery with extreme\n\n[ 27]\n\n01chap1.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 28\n\nthe spanish gypsy\n\nseverity. The Gypsy was thus a symbol of absolute nonconformity, escaping both the feudal-lord/serf arrangement (by refusing to become Wxed to the land or serve a master) and the emerging bourgeois/proletariat arrangements dependent on Moriscos and slaves. In short, their freedom could be a source of envy on many accounts. One should not be tempted, however, to imagine “La gitanilla” as a Xedgling utopia. Cervantes’ Gypsy idyll has been variously interpreted as an anticipation of Rousseau, a parody of the pastoral novel, or even a vindication of Gypsy life. But, read closely, the story does not glamorize Gypsy life, which, E. Michael Gerli notes, unfolds “half way between the pastoral and the picaresque, half way between the ideal and the infamous polarities of romance.”40 Stanislav Zimic, another critic to see past the idealizing aspects of Gypsy life, notes that when viewed from the twentieth century the portrait is not in the least idyllic, especially for women.41 More important, as the story unfolds it becomes clear that existing in harmony with nature does not ensure a life of virtue, and disdain for worldly goods and property does not immunize one from the century’s lust for gold. On the contrary, one of the novella’s striking paradoxes is that the Gypsies’ lust for gold coins, even while they disdain the comforts of the court that gold could purchase for them and prefer to bivouac beneath the stars. In short, the rustic life as described in the above citations is Xung at the reader as a tantalizing or potential good, but the antiutopian Cervantes used the Gypsy stereotype to warn that virtue is not the product of a bucolic space and lust is not limited to the rich and landed. The ode to freedom and nature that opens the novella is more a nostalgic lure for readers already aware of the failure of utopian enterprises than a statement of fact about Gypsy existence. The question remains, however, whether virtue and vice are rooted in nature or deeds. It is not always clear in “La gitanilla” whether the Gypsy is amoral because he is an animal acting in accordance with instincts, as is sometimes hinted by the story’s descriptions, or whether his acquisitiveness is a socially acquired evil. Solving the mystery of whether Cervantes intended to create a sympathetic or negative portrait of Gypsies, or whether his narrator’s opening statement that Gypsy women and men are born in the world only to be thieves indicates a belief in biological determinism, may not be as important as understanding the impact of this work on future historians and ethnologists searching for knowledge about the Spanish Roma. Yet dozens of critics have taken a keen interest in deciding these questions regarding Cervantes’ ideological take on race, some in hopes of distinguishing the master from his more biased contemporaries, others to show him as a spokesman for the operative values of Spanish aristocracy. For our purposes it is more important to understand exactly what was meant by race or sangre in seventeenth-century Spain. This story, like many other Golden Age texts, embodies the contradictions resulting from the coexistence of what Juan Carlos Rodríguez\n\n[ 28]\n\n01chap1.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 29\n\ncervantes’ precious jewel of love\n\nidentiWes as two competing ideological matrices: the Wrst phase of bourgeois ideology with its emphasis on the beautiful soul and the last phase of feudal nobility that clings to “blood” as the determinant of hierarchical order. It is likely that such terms as “race” and “blood,” used so frequently in Golden Age texts, were not always as biologically linked as we regard them today. In other words, the question of nature versus nurture is often raised by twentiethcentury scholars whose views on race are more exacting in terms of Galenic science than those of Cervantes and his contemporaries; thus a discussion of race often produces wildly differing conclusions. Some critics have argued that the words parece que (“it seems that”) in the novella’s opening statement quoted above sufWce to set in motion the classic Cervantine irony and cast doubt on his racialist beliefs. Others insist that since in “La gitanilla” one can “become” a Gypsy through certain rituals and trials, it follows that Cervantes understood the fallacy of his narrator’s opening diatribe and rejected biological determinism. On the other hand, it is often pointed out that since no amount of time spent with her abductors is sufWcient to transform Constanza-Preciosa into a true (rapacious) Gypsy, it follows that Gypsyness cannot be acquired except through birth. Since “La gitanilla” has become such a focal point for discussions of Gypsies in the seventeenth century, it is useful to summarize what becoming a Gypsy means in this text. Cervantes tried to imagine this transformation through both Preciosa, who, although raised as a Gypsy, acts like a lady, and Don Juan de Cárcamo, a wealthy citizen of the court who will assume the name Andrés Caballero and become an honorary Gypsy to win the favors of Preciosa. Cervantes did not try to imagine, as George Eliot would later do in The Spanish Gypsy, what happens when a Gypsy is raised as an aristocrat, but like Eliot he suggested that the inXuence of one’s racial group prevails during times of crisis. Preciosa is successful as a Gypsy only to the extent of incorporating herself into the Gypsy practice of selling entertainment, an activity that Carroll Johnson interprets as a precursor of a future capitalist economy. In most regards, however, she is the embodiment of the court poet’s esquiva, an idealized and elusive feminine subject who refuses to be bound by the social customs governing marriage, but who succumbs Wnally to patriarchal codes when she falls in love. For his part Juan/Andrés must undergo a ritual initiation into Gypsy status. First the Gypsies seat him on a log and place in his hands a mallet and shears, instruments symbolizing Roma professions. Next he must dance to the sound of Gypsy guitar music. Finally his arm is bared and a silk ribbon is wound around it twice with a stick. These minute details of an initiation rite lend the text an aura of authenticity that have led some to speculate that Cervantes had Wrsthand knowledge of actual Gypsy customs.42 They also support the contention that Cervantes, like Sancho de Moncada, understood Gypsies to be more of a fraternity than a race.\n\n[ 29]\n\n01chap1.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 30\n\nthe spanish gypsy\n\nYet the rituals do not make of Juan a true Gypsy: He must Wrst pass several tests by learning to steal, play cards, and participate in the various shady activities of his cohorts. Andrés’s acceptance by the Gypsy troop is also dependent on his liberal disbursement of money, and in this he shows the moral superiority that distinguishes gentleman from Gypsy rogue. Thus the elder’s ode to Gypsy life is tempered by an implied criticism of practices that are accentuated by Andrés’s largesse and innate nobility. This can be seen in the activities that make Andrés a “bad” Gypsy: Rather than steal and hoard wealth in secret, the implied Gypsy norm, he publicizes and shares his wealth, hoping to buy favors and to inXuence Preciosa’s feelings. At the same time that this spreading around of money makes it easier for him to be accepted, it serves to elevate him morally above the community. Like Preciosa, he is an exception held in esteem by the group precisely for what is lacking in them: wealth and the knowledge of exchange values, aristocratic largesse, and an acute sense of loyalty. Although his fellow Gypsies spend long hours instructing him in the Wne arts of vagrancy, Andrés never acquires the knack of stealing. Presumably his gentle birth militates against this custom, and he scandalizes the others by sometimes paying restitution to the victims of the Gypsies’ petty thievery. At other times he secretly buys objects that he then passes off as stolen goods. Like Preciosilla, he rejects Gypsy laws that permit a man to punish or divorce his wife, and when called a thief by the mayor of Murcia, he reacts by reverting to an aristocratic code of honor and driving his accuser through with a sword. You can take the noble out of the court, this story tells us, but you can not corrupt him, even if, like Preciosa, you have been brought up for your entire life in the Gypsy ways. In tandem with the complicated exchanges of identity between Gypsy and Payo culture elaborated in “La gitanilla” are the reiterated exchanges involving money and entertainment that serve as the focal point of contact between the two groups. In fact, nearly every action in this novella is facilitated by exchanges in which money, especially the gold doubloons mentioned so often, plays a signiWcant material and symbolic role. The transactions between Gypsies and Payos do not necessarily reXect how relations really stood between the two groups, but they do demonstrate how Spain’s ruling classes imagined them to be and they register the growing discontent on the part of some intellectuals like Cervantes over the changes brought about by “the new world of money.”43 Alban K. Forcione was one of the Wrst to note the importance of economic issues in the novella and to conclude that Cervantes acted as spokesperson for the ofWcial policy regarding Spanish Roma.44 This position was furthered by Robert Ter Horst, who argues that Cervantes created the “small society” of the novella’s Gypsies as a synecdoche for the larger population and its plebeian economy.45 Ter Horst contrasts the acquisitiveness and thievery that characterize the Gypsies with the prodigality of the\n\n[ 30]\n\n01chap1.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 31\n\ncervantes’ precious jewel of love\n\naristocratic world of Andrés Caballero. A clash of economies occurs with the initiation of a nobleman with unencumbered wealth into a society of Gypsies whose economy is based on scarcity, thievery, and hoarding. The open hand of Andrés, “abundant, liberal, prodigal,” contrasts with the clutching talon, symbol of the “predatory, sterility, or lack” of the Gypsies.46 Andrés’s gold buys an exemption from the universal laws of the Gypsies, just as Preciosa’s beauty and moral superiority exempt her from being fully subject to the laws governing marriage. In contrasting the Gypsy’s and the nobleman’s relation to wealth, Ter Horst draws an analogy with the competing economic theories of John Maynard Keynes and Adam Smith: “In present-day terms one might liken the aristocratic approach to the Keynesian method of stimulating growth through deWcit spending and the plebeian theory to classical concepts of saving and capital formation so as to have funds in hand for any opportunity or emergency.”47 The problem with this analogy is that it is equally possible to show the novella’s aristocrats as proXigate spenders or givers (Andrés) and stingy misers (the family and guests of the lieutenant). Similarly, though Gypsies are cast as greedy, the most important Gypsy performs an act of great charity that allows Preciosa to recover her fortune, and in another act of generosity the Gypsy troop offers to empty its coffers to rescue Andrés from execution. Using the Smithian model to describe the Gypsy economy also seems to contradict Ter Horst’s comparison of Gypsies and other “venture capitalists” who sail the high seas in search of markets and proWts. Finally, it can be argued that Andrés is not speculating in a Keynesian sense because his gifts to the Gypsies are not so much a donation as a down payment, minimal in terms of his actual fortune, on goods (his future bride), which in no way resembles deWcit or high-risk spending. Nevertheless, Ter Horst is right in noticing that when all the money transactions between Gypsies and non-Gypsies are concluded, what Wnally emerges is a couple deeply in love and a band of Gypsies that has opened up its economy to the chivalrous notion of charity. It is likely an exaggeration to conclude that the novella expresses “a fearful devotion to the lifelong bond between wife and husband,”48 but clearly Cervantes wanted readers to leave behind all the sordid and material concerns of the Gypsies and concentrate in the end on a happy restoration of a patriarchal idyll. In this world of abundance the principal “good” is an obedient daughter, and her successful marketing results in a ritual transference from father to son-in-law. In this sense the story’s Gypsies stand outside the happy circle of courtly customs, reminding readers not only of the defects of the despised race, but of the improbability of Golden Age scenarios. Ter Horst’s oversimpliWed categories are complicated by Joan Ramón Resina, who notes that they not only fail to describe intergroup transactions, but run counter to actual Gypsy-Payo relations. Resina instead studies the way money mediates codes of love and acts as a principal means of communication and\n\n[ 31]\n\n01chap1.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 32\n\nthe spanish gypsy\n\nmeasurement of value, speciWcally, a woman’s value. The various monetary negotiations in the text (for example, Andrés’s betrothal present) determine Preciosa’s use, exchange, and surplus values. Preciosa is not a passive player in this economic valuation; she both speculates with her own value, and thus escapes the Gypsy economy, and champions woman’s intrinsic value, for example, in her ballads in honor of Santa Ana and Queen Margarita.49 Far from a mere object of exchange in a male-dominated economy, Preciosa is keenly aware of her earning power among the elite classes and therefore her value to her future prospects and the Gypsies. As a Gypsy Preciosa rejects the aristocratic code with its courtly love conventions that Andrés offers her and instead insists on setting conditions that Resina describes as a “new lovers’ semantic.”50 As a non-Gypsy, however, she establishes her value at a much higher standard of exchange than would be possible for an ordinary Roma woman. In other words, she enhances the “base metal” of her Gypsy heritage by citing the incalculable treasure that is her virtue and reminding her suitor that virtue is not a question of class: “If all souls are equal, the soul of a laborer can equal in worth to those of emperors.”51 With this she removes herself from the Gypsy communal property and establishes her right as an exceptional individual to determine her status. Read in this light, Preciosa resembles a multifaceted jewel that circulates through various economies and in the process serves alternately to distinguish and to juxtapose Gypsy and Payo value systems without preference to either. As William H. Clamurro recognizes, beneath the surface of the novella run the “harsh, this-worldly social structures and values” of seventeenth-century society, which subvert the expectations of the romance genre.52 This is especially evident in the uses of money and exchanges and their relation to personal identity and the social order. As a plot device, money secures freedom, maintains disguises, saves reputations, protects virtue, and buys time. But it also takes on a linguistic function that links identity and the social order: It is a language that symbolically by turns binds and disassociates the tale’s most precious object, Preciosa, from her social context. Money is the supplement to language that allows others, especially male characters like Juan and Clemente, to talk to and about Preciosa. And whether at any given moment Preciosa accepts money (for example, from Clemente) or rejects it (for example, when she scoffs at Andrés’s hundred gold crowns) determines her status as either a Gypsy or a lady, Preciosa or Constanza. It is not just a question of virtue and integrity being more important to Preciosa than wealth and position, for in the end as Constanza she possesses both: She is the perfect lady (chaste, acquiescent, silent), and her wealth and position are restored. The only thing that she must relinquish is her Gypsy identity, a transformation that Cervantes’ readers would surely have regarded as a positive event. On the other hand, Constanza’s uncharacteristic submissiveness in the Wnal scene\n\n[ 32]\n\n01chap1.qxd\n\n28/01/2004\n\n8:33 AM\n\nPage 33\n\ncervantes’ precious jewel of love\n\ncontrasts sharply with the catalytic quality of her earlier interventions, disappointing some modern readers like Clamurro. More important, Preciosa’s apotheosis and sudden disappearance mirror the eclipsed role of the Gypsies at the end of the tale: “Once the larger community’s laws and customs intervene, the powers and possibilities of language, high-spirited wit, and the tricks and defenses of this marginal group all seem to collapse. Preciosa’s sudden docility is as marked a change as is the uncharacteristic immobility of the gypsies.”53 The novella’s climax also marks a return to the thematics of feudalism that opened the story, in which issues of honor, virtue, vice, and nonconformity are inextricably tied to blood. Preciosa’s remarkable speech in which she argues that virtue is a question of souls, not of blood, is perhaps not canceled out, but it is forced to coexist with a more traditional system of values. In other words “La gitanilla” is not an allegory of the hierarchy of souls taking precedence over a hierarchy of blood; in the end what lifts Preciosa “to the highest rank” is that her blood is Wnally recognized as deWning her worth: She is the daughter of her father, and therefore a lady and not a Gypsy.54 One aspect of money that critics have not examined at any length is its importance as a catalyst for the reader’s engagement with the text, a theme that Francisco J. Sánchez explores in his suggestive article “Theater Within the Novel.” The money transactions that take place for spectacles such as Preciosa’s dancing in the casino to occur invited Cervantes’ readers to visualize mentally the conditions of spectacle and theater. While theater productions and other mass spectacles created the illusion of equality among social classes, readers of “La gitanilla” would disassocia"
