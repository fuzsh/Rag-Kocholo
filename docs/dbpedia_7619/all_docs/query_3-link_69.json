        "text": "2.3. Cante jondo in Nights in the Spanish Gardens\n\nIn combination with the “guitarristic” and “Debussynian” parts, the ones of cante jondo create the characteristic sonority of the piece. Hence, the subsequent section analyzes the different cante jondo parts and its pianistic interpretation.\n\nThis analysis, thought, may represent a rather subjective approach. The differences between microtonal music and the western temperate scale make some of the cante jondo characteristics unrealizable. However, the piano approach to this particular way of singing always increases the level of the performance.\n\nIt would be advisable to note that in Nights in the Spanish Gardens (especially in the first movement), Falla makes a stylization of the Andalusian cante jondo, combining it with an impressionistic and romantic writing. It would be highly recommendable to listen to the last two examples in order to be aware of this stylization.\n\nOnce the different features of cante jondo written by Falla have been revised, the succeeding sections to be analyzed should contain at least one of the following characteristics:\n\nSmall intervallic range (over a 6th).\n\nCantabile and lyrical content.\n\nCharacteristic ornamentation.\n\nObsessive repetition of one note.\n\nBig and fast cadencial lines.\n\nAs it can be seen, the score example number 2 represents a melodic passage. It is developed within a range of 5th and insists in the note B. Falla also adds the “a tempo, ma flessibile” indication. In this case the microinterval characteristic would be very present in the interval of second between B and A. This should be played with a very close touch and with a non clear sound. As a result of this expressive first bar, the second should be played slightly faster. The characteristic obsessive repetition should be also marked by the pianist at every B.\n\nThe left accompaniment imitates a guitar, it is important to understand the natural resonance that would be created by the guitarist playing every bar with just one position. The dot on the E is just remarking the thumb attack on the lowest string of the instrument. The pedal should be hold at least until the third part of each bar. As if it was a guitarist accompanying a singer, the left hand must also be subordinated to the melody but with a rhythmic stability within his part.\n\nIn this passage of score example 9 the syllabic and consonant feature of cante jondo can be clearly understood. The first two bars, with larger notes, are sung with normal lyrics; this makes clear differences between the accents at the beginning of a word. As it was said, for Falla the first accent is followed by quassi glissando notes. Of course the passage must be clear but the closest that a pianist can reach is, as Falla suggest, with the use of the pedal. This resonance may be combined with individual attacks, remarking every part of that hypothetic word.\n\nOn the other hand, the 16th´s of the third and fourth bars represent the melismatic end of the phrase, usually done with an “a”. In these cases it must be played with a big rubato, accelerando at the last part of the 4th bar. Again, the pedal should be held down at least half of the way.\n\nThe orchestra makes comments after every piano part. These comments are very typical from the “rondallas”, groups of string instruments that usually accompany vocal songs.\n\nAll this references can be understood listening to audio example 12 As in audio example 7, it is taken from Falla´s La Vida Breve. In the piece, an andalusian party with a cantaor and a rondalla is represented. Here, all the differences between words and melismas sung by the cantaor may been listen. It contains also the rondalla comments played by guitars.\n\na) The use of enharmonic intervals as a modulating means. “Modulating” is not used here in its modern sense (…). But the primitive Indian systems and those deriving from them do not consider that the places the smallest intervals occupy in the melodic series (i.e. the semitones of our tempered scale)- the scales- are invariable. In those systems the production of intervals that inhibit similar movements obey a rising or a lowering of the voice, which originates in the expression given to the sung word. (…) Moreover, each of the notes that could be altered was divided and subdivided, so that in certain cases the starting and finishing notes in some fragments of phrase were altered, which is exactly what happens in the cante jondo. To this we must add the frequent practice in Indian songs as well as in ours, of the vocal portamento, that is, the way of leading the voice so as to produce the infinite nuances existing between two joined or distant notes. (…) In summarizing this, we can affirm that in the cante jondo, as well as in the primitive eastern songs, the musical scale is a direct consequence of what we could call the oral scale. (…) What we now call “enharmonic modulation” can be considered, in a certain sense, as a consequence of the primitive enharmonic genre. Yet this consequence is apparent rather than real, because our tempered scale only allows us to change the tonal functions of a sound, whereas in the actual enharmonic process that sound is modified according to the natural needs of its attractive functions.\n\nb) We recognize as peculiar to the cante jondo the usage of a melodic field that seldom surpasses the limits of a sixth. This sixth, of course, does not consist only of nine semitones, as in our tempered scale; through the use of enharmonic intervals, the number of sounds the singer can produce is substantially increased.\n\nc) The repeated, even obsessive, use of one note, frequently accompanied by an upper or by a lower appoggiatura. (…) In certain songs of the group we are considering, (particularly in the siguirilla), this device permits the destruction of every feeling of metrical rhythm, and thus gives the impression of sung prose, although the text is in verse.\n\nd) Although gipsy melody is rich in ornamental features, there are used only at certain moments –as they are in primitive oriental songs- to express states of relaxation or of rapture, suggested by the emotional force of the text. They have to be considered, therefore, as extensive vocal inflexions rather than as ornamental turns, although they sound like the latter when they are “translated” into the geometric intervals of the temperate scale.\n\ne) The shouts with which our people encourage and incite the cantaores and tocaores also originate in a habit still to be observed in similar cases among the oriental races.20"
