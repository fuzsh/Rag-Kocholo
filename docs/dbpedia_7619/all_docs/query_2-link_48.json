        "text": "Selected readings on WAM\n\nBTW, I suspect a WordPress glitch may have failed to notify email subscribers of\n\nmy recent post on Nicolas Slonimsky’s wonderful memoir Perfect pitch—\n\nand it’s Jolly Good, just saying…\n\nI’ve just revised my introductory page on Western Art Music, with the addition of an off-piste selection of general writings that I find stimulating.\n\nIt extends from works within the field itself (Taruskin, Ross, Slonimsky, McClary, Butt, Lebrecht) to the broader perspectives of ethnomusicology (Becker, Small, Nettl) and ethnography (Finnegan, Cottrell, Tindall, Warnock).\n\nChina not forgotten!\n\nOver a summer hardly bathed in sunshine, but enlivened by football, tennis, Istanbul, and Proms, it may look as if I’m somewhat neglecting China. Still, just since May, posts include\n\nTwo surveys of folk ritual and its soundscapes, based on the great Anthology:\n\nFujian province\n\nTianjin municipality,\n\nwith more in the pipeline…\n\nDaoist ritual in Taiwan—a fine ethnography by Yves Menheere\n\nA film on the qin zither\n\nheadsup for my forthcoming film on the 1995 New Year’s rituals in Gaoluo village, and\n\nrecent Chinese attention to my work\n\nQiao Jianzhong: Chinese folk music studies since the reform era\n\nA Buddhist centre in Peckham (with more notes on Wutaishan)\n\nThe changing ritual scene of Xiongxian\n\nDaoism, society, and women in the Tang\n\nMore Chinese crime fiction.\n\nChina even plays a cameo role in\n\nFootball in Stalinist Albania.\n\nActually, that should be enough to keep you busy (not to mention all the fieldnotes under Local ritual)—indeed, a little break might be welcome… I’m working on several new essays for my site, but in the interim I regularly post on Twitter—other recent China retweets including\n\nA Daoist altar in west Fujian\n\nLayers of fieldwork\n\nA Tang couplet\n\nSpirit mediums in China: collected posts\n\nRitual groups of Xushui—for the anniversary of Mao’s fateful visit on 4th August 1958 to launch the disastrous Great Leap Backward\n\nThe art of the sheng repairer.\n\nComing up soon is a reminder of a crucial theme, still little addressed:\n\nDebunking “living fossils”: ethnography and history.\n\nIt’s always worth reminding people of my work on the Li family Daoists:\n\nthe Must-Watch film Li Manshan: portrait of a folk Daoist\n\nand a roundup of posts.\n\nAnd we should bear in mind the alternative perspectives of Tibetan, Uyghur, and Taiwanese cultures.\n\nThere’s a certain random quality to the topics of some of these retweets, but as with my original articles, I like to keep people guessing, and to remind readers of posts which may have escaped attention, or seem particularly apposite. So you may care to check my Twitter feed, or even “follow” me there…\n\nNina Simone\n\n*Part of my strangely extensive jazz series!*\n\nSource.\n\nSuch is my devotion to Billie Holiday that I’ve never quite been able to warm to Nina Simone (1933–2003). But my interest has been revived by listening with rapt admiration to Feeling good (1965). It opens with an all-too-brief free-tempo alap, brusquely interrupted by the incongruous sleazy riff: *\n\nThe title isn’t so ironic as it sounds. Written by (white) English composers Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse for the musical The roar of the greasepaint—the smell of the crowd, satirising the British class system, the UK premiere was given by Cy Grant in the role of “the Negro” singing the song as he “wins” the game; i t was described as a “booming song of emancipation”. When the show transferred to New York the following year, the role was taken by Gilbert Price. Nina utterly transforms the song, but the optimism of its lyrics is remote from the activist songs that were becoming the core of her repertoire just at that time.\n\n* * *\n\nWithin the milieu of the day, few musicians were angels. Jazz biographies from the, um, Golden Age tend to follow a depressingly familiar trajectory of self-destruction: pain, drugs, exploitation, disastrous choice of partners, violence, disillusion, and legal woes. Despite all these features, Miles’s autobiography is strangely inspiring, tough but never helpless (for a lengthy sample, see Miles meets Bird). White musos could be no less self-destructive—few more so than Chet Baker.\n\nFor Nina, besides wiki and ninasimone.com, I’ve been reading\n\nDavid Brun-Lambert, Nina Simone: the biography (2005).\n\nAmong documentaries is Nina Simone: the legend (Frank Lords, 1991), What happened, Miss Simone? (Liz Garbus, 2015; trailer), and The amazing Nina Simone (Jeff L. Lieberman, 2015; trailer).\n\nThe sixth of eight children in a poor North Carolina family, Nina was a child prodigy at the piano; “Bach made me dedicate my life to music”. After graduating from high school in 1950, she seemed destined to become “the first black American concert pianist”. So the original, lasting, deep wound in her psyche was being refused admission to study at Curtis—which she attributed to racism. Thwarted in her classical ambitions, she continued to study privately with Curtis professor Vladimir Sokoloff for several years, funded with a regular gig at a nightclub in Atlantic City—only taking up singing because the job demanded it.\n\nWhile Nina’s classical piano training would later give her a cachet among respectable white audiences, I seem to have reservations about singers accompanying themselves at the piano, like Ray Charles. Distinctive and original as her playing was (e.g. her “destabilising” 1969 album Nina Simone and piano), it was at a tangent from jazz: stark, based on melody, hardly admitting any harmonic interest—by contrast with her cohorts in the jazz scene like Monk, Herbie Hancock, or Bill Evans. But this musical simplicity threw greater focus on her political message.\n\nBy the late 50s, as her career was taking off, her dream of fame as a classical pianist had evaporated. The civil rights movement was growing. In Greenwich Village she began hanging out with James Baldwin, Langston Hughes, LeRoi Jones, and Lorraine Hansberry. Her 1961 visit to Lagos with Baldwin, Hughes, and others as part of a delegation of the American Society for African Culture was her first time in Africa.\n\nNow married to a violent husband and manager, she gave birth to her daughter in 1962. Her entry into the civil rights struggle was embodied in her 1963 song Mississippi goddam. Nina’s activism, and the wider civil rights background, is extensively covered by Brun-Lambert, with detail on her involvement with Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam, Miriam Makeba, the Black Panthers, riots, marches, and the whole ferment in black popular music through the 1960s.\n\nBy 1970, exhausted and disillusioned, Nina seemed to have reached the end of the road. In later life she largely avoided the USA for fear of legal battles; while still touring, she sought refuge in Barbados, Liberia, Switzerland, Holland, and France, lonely and estranged from her daughter, her relationships fraught and short-lived; among a succession of managers, some had better intentions than others. Her mood-swings and behaviour on and off stage had long been volatile, becoming ever more apparent; the diagnosis of bipolar disorder was belated. Brun-Lambert describes her as “leading a double artistic life, unable to find her own place anywhere”.\n\n* * *\n\nTurning to Nina’s songs—as ever, there’s a vast selection on YouTube, notably this channel—below I give a mere sample.\n\nIn her early years she sounds benign enough, like the New York Town Hall concert in September 1959, “still without trace of savagery or sexuality”, as Brun-Lambert puts it:\n\nStill, her interpretations, such as Summertime, are distinctive. Billie Holiday had died in July that year; a couple of years earlier she had immortalised Fine and mellow in the most enthralling TV film ever. Nina sang it for her Town Hall finale.\n\n“Her first song with explicitly black consciousness” was Flo Me La at the Newport festival in 1960 (from 20.52):\n\nAmong several appearances at Carnegie Hall, here’s her 1964 concert (as playlist):\n\nThe programme introduced activist songs such as Old Jim Crow, Go limp, and Mississippi goddam into the genteel surroundings. And she is just right for Brecht/Weill songs like Pirate Jenny!\n\nSinging The house of the rising sun at the Village Gate in 1961, she sounds rather mellifluous:\n\nBy 1968, live at the Bitter End Café, her voice is harsher and more experimental:\n\nThe final number on her troubled 1965 album Pastel blues (here, as playlist) is Sinnerman, “about despair, disenchantment, disillusionment in the face of a situation that offers no alternatives but flight or prayer” (Brun-Lambert). Before that comes Strange fruit, just as visceral as Billie’s 1939 recording and 1959 performance. Nina’s concert in Antibes that year included some songs from the forthcoming album—opening with a disjointed intro that segues into Strange fruit:\n\nAnd here’s Four women, live in 1965:\n\nAfter the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968, she sang Why? (The king of love is dead)—here’s a full version live that year:\n\nIn 1967 she recorded I wish I knew how it would feel to be free—here’s her 1976 Montreux performance:\n\nAgain, I find some of these casual piano accompaniments, and even her voice, disconcerting—but maybe that’s the point.\n\nThat’s probably enough to outline the story of Nina’s heyday; in her later career she largely repeated such standards—after the original creative impetus had diluted, and as her mental troubles escalated. She had been touring in England since 1967—it’s worth hearing her live at Ronnie’s in 1985:\n\nTo encapsulate ecstasy and pain, for me it’s always going to be Billie… I may be romanticising the devotion of jazzers to their art (cf. the wonderful image of Donald Byrd practising on the subway), but I detect no inkling of any such devotion in Nina: any musical discipline that she practised seems to have been at the keyboard. She formed no bonds with her fellow musicians.\n\nWhile one gets little impression that she honed her vocal skills, in early recordings like Black is the color of my true love’s hair and Wild is the wind (in the 1959 Town Hall concert) she sounds genuinely intimate, even sweet—far removed from her later image. Still, music is about society: Nina’s voice developed into a genuine expression of the troubled times, part of the necessarily strident style that emerged from the civil rights struggle.\n\nUnder A jazz medley, see e.g. Green book, Detroit 67 and Memphis 68, as well as A Hollywood roundtable, The Tulsa race massacre, and Black and white.\n\n* Feeling good has been much covered—rather than featuring other versions, here’s Trane in 1965:\n\nAnd although nothing can compare with the raw emotion of being black in those years, here’s Andrea Motis in 2012:\n\nNot being pedantic or anything [Uh-oh—Ed.], the title seems to be cited more commonly as Feeling good than as Feelin’ good (zzzzz). Cf. I got a woman, note here.\n\nAnother Turangalîla at the Proms!\n\nPhoto: Chris Christodoulo. Source.\n\nOne should never miss a live performance of Messiaen’s ecstatic Turangalîla-symphonie!!!\n\nMy Messiaen page has links to many posts on Messiaen, and a tribute to Turangalîla—with the NYO’s 2012 Prom performance, and some hilariously uncomprehending reviews of the 1949 premiere (“Dorothy Lamour in a sarong […] Hindu Hillbillies”, “straight from the Hollywood cornfields”).\n\nGinette Martinot, who gave the premiere of Turangalîla. Source.\n\nLast week at the Proms it was directed by the enterprising Nicholas Collon, with the BBC Philharmonic (British orchestras dominating so far; European and US bands can wait till later in the season). Cynthia Millar, veteran of the ethereal ondes martenot, added yet another radiant performance of a piece she has played around 200 times, including several Proms since 1986—for players limited to such a small repertoire, * Messiaen is a blessed gift (see Millar’s tribute to Jeanne Loriod). Steven Osborne relished Messiaen’s unique piano writing, with a niche backing-group of celesta and glockenspiel right behind him. I’m always entranced by the hushed coda that concludes the 4th movement, before the exhilarating Joie du sang des étoiles. Sensuous orchestral timbres abound.\n\nSource.\n\nWhile experiencing Turangalîla live is extraordinary, for balance it’s worth listening on BBC Sounds, and it’s on iPlayer too. At the Proms it was first heard in 1969, with Musica Reservata performing Renaissance music in the first half (surely I was there, so why isn’t it indelibly etched in my memory?!). This time the prelude was the world premiere of Anna Clyne’s The gorgeous nothings, with the seven-piece a cappella Swingles, amplified, joining the orchestra—reminding me to acquaint myself with the poetry and reclusive life of Emily Dickinson. For a groovy encore (Erica Jeal asks pertinently “Is it bad etiquette to give an encore that upstages the main work?”) the Swingles launched into their joyous arrangement of the Bulgarian dance piece Bučimiš (studio version here; its metre is 2+2+2+2+3+2+2, BTW—see Taco taco taco burrito!). An encore after Turangalîla seems inconceivable—but in 2012 the NYO found a perfect one—Anna Meredith’s Handsfree!\n\nFans of the ondes martenot will want to hear the theremin too! Many more a cappella gems here; more Bulgarian folk under Musical cultures of east Europe.\n\nOther recent Proms treats include Ravel‘s delightful piano concerto (with Ives’s Three places in New England), and Gershwin’s Rhapsody in blue (Steven Osborne again).\n\n* This site mentions 1,200 works (!), although the core concert repertoire consists of pieces by a mere 27 composers.\n\nSome niche Olympic sports\n\nPoodle Clipping, Paris Olympics 1900.\n\nFor the Paris Olympics, Call Me Old-Fashioned [What, again?—Ed.] but I mainly favour the traditional sports, like tennis (Nadalcaraz together in doubles?! WOW) and football—easing the withdrawal symptoms after the Euros (for which I crafted wonderful folk playlists) and Wimbledon.\n\nYou had to be quick to catch the Rugby 7s, not just because the tournament began and ended early, but because the matches don’t last long (although how long seems to be a closely-guarded secret). It’s glorious because it’s basically running around like fuck and scoring loads of tries, dispensing with much of Rugby Union’s boring faff like falling over on top of each other, set-pieces, trying to work out arcane rules, and all that pompous cerebral preparation to kick a conversion.\n\nGradually, with the essential aid of expert commentary, one gets drawn into the more niche activities—like Beermat Flipping, Treacle Volleyball, Malteser Shot-Putting, Bonzai Flatpack Assembly, and Synchronised Underwater Hamster Dressage.\n\nAnother popular event is The Sound of One Hand Clapping, in which Japan still has a monopoly. The Chinese, not really perpetuating the Daoist tradition of wuwei non-action, now excel at Lying Flat 躺平, but their governing body doesn’t seem keen to get it ratified by the Olympic Committee.\n\nMonty Python got there first with such fantasy:\n\nSee also under A sporting medley: ritual and gender. As I have noted, my viewing stats from WordPress * somewhat resemble a fantasy Olympic medals table:\n\nAs to table tennis, allow me to remind you of this fine headline:\n\nKing Kong Ping-Pong Sing-Song Ding-Dong\n\n* You may be as dismayed as I am that these stats have begun to address me as “Howdy, StephenJones.blog”. Another sign of The End of Civilisation As We Know It…\n\nThe hidden musicians\n\nRuth Finnegan, The hidden musicians: music-making in an English town\n\n(first edition 1989, revised 2007).\n\nIn several posts I’ve praised Finnegan’s classic work en passant—and revisiting it now, I find it even more impressive. I struggle to encapsulate its virtues without citing every paragraph.\n\nIts subject is local grass-roots musicking in Milton Keynes, mainly at the amateur end of the amateur–professional continuum, so often taken for granted. It’s a model of participant observation: Finnegan was a long-term resident of the area, with most of her material collected from 1980 to 1984. Writing in an accessible style, she constantly debunks facile assumptions.\n\nHaving started out by studying oral performance in Africa, Finnegan now embarked on a project concerning doorstep (rather than armchair) ethnomusicology. The hidden musicians soon became core reading for the ethnomusicological study of musicking in Western societies, including Western Art Music (for which she abides by the traditional term “classical music”).\n\nAn attention to “ordinary musicians” was already implicit in the ethnomusicological approach to more “exotic” societies (note Bruno Nettl’s masterly survey of the field), but it is all the more revealing for a culture so near to home. In The hidden musicians, references to research on other world cultures, standard for such studies, might have been instructive, but the economy of theory and jargon is welcome. Among Finnegan’s main inspirations is Howard Becker’s 1982 study Art worlds. In 2022 her work inspired a BFE conference (in Milton Keynes, to boot, where the Open University is fortuitously based) on “ordinary musicians”, addressing topics in societies around the world.\n\nThe opening of the book anticipates that of Christopher Small’s Musicking (1998), observing the diverse ways in which music-making pervades people’s lives. Like Small, she focuses on “musical practices (what people do), not musical works (the ‘texts’ of music)”—seeking processes rather than products. She finds “an invisible but organised system” that lies at the heart of our cultural lives.\n\nAfter an important chapter unpacking gradations on the amateur–professional continuum, in Part Two Finnegan outlines the diverse yet overlapping musical worlds of classical music, brass bands, folk music (including ceilidh and Morris bands), musical theatre (amateur operatic societies, panto, and so on), jazz, Country and Western, rock and pop. She disputes the “mass society” theory that ”envisages a passive and deluded population lulled by the mass media and generating nothing themselves”, as well as simplistic socio-economic or age-based analyses. She challenges assumptions, such as “high culture”, and, taking a descriptive rather than prescriptive approach, she finds\n\nseveral different musical worlds, […] each having its own contrasting conventions about the proper modes of learning, transmission, composition, or performance. Because the pre-eminent position of classical music so often goes without saying, the existence of these differing musics has often simply been ignored.\n\nIf the pre-eminence of classical music was only notional by the 1980s, her material does indeed seem to confirm this unspoken assumption. Conversely, social scientists have emphasised “popular” or “lower-class” activities such as rock. But\n\neach musical tradition—classical, rock, jazz, or whatever—can be studied in its own right. When no longer judged by the criteria of others, each emerges as in principle equally authentic and equally influential in shaping the practices of local music.\n\nPart Three, “Contrasts and comparisons” opens with an insightful chapter on learning music (cf. the Growing into music film project). While Finnegan largely concurs with the notional dichotomy in training between the worlds of classical and popular musics, she notes commonalities. “Performances and their conditions” perceptively compares the conventions of events belonging to different musical worlds, noting aspects such as preparation and audience behaviour. In “Composition, creativity, and performance” she investigates degrees of dependence on written texts (cf. studies of “improvisation”, for which we can again consult Nettl as a handy guide). And in Chapter 14, preparing the ground for her later metaphor of “pathways”, Finnegan refines the concept of musical “worlds”, noting their plurality, with a certain overlap, and wider connections further afield; they are “relative, shifting, and situational”.\n\nPart Four, “The organisation and work of local music”, contains chapters on the home and school; the churches; clubs and pubs; a case study on the organisation and administration of the Sherwood Choir; small working bands; resources, rewards, and support (including music shops and recording studios—with more on the amateur–professional continuum, and patronage).\n\nWith amateur music, people’s time and work are often as important as their money. So too are non-monetary rewards such as aesthetic enjoyment, the pleasure of performing, status, the sense of creativity, or even just the symbol of having earned “a fee” irrespective of its actuall monetary price. This in turn chimes in with a series of commonly held values: the high worth commonly attached to “performance”, to “music”, and to working for a “good cause”, as well as the view held by many people that “doing your own thing” has something inherently valuable about it—or, at the least, that the various groups organised to pursue different ends are an acceptable part of modern life.\n\nIt would be too simple just to assert—as some do—that local music is supported by “the community” or to speak of it as essentially “community music-making”. There are too many different interests, sections, conflicts, and unfamiliarities to take that romantic picture. Nevertheless there is a grain of truth in this view. For local musical activities only remain possible through the support of a complex network of institutions, many of them essentially realised by local participants at the local level whatever their wider links: not only the continuing moral, social, and financial (as well as musical) input of local musicians, but also the local music shops, studios, businesses, special interest groups, bands, performers, musical societies, pubs, personalities, fund-raising groups, schools, churches, and charities.\n\nIn Part Five, “The significance of local music”, Finnegan asks\n\nAre there wider implications that can be drawn out from this system of local music-making? This part builds on the earlier ethnographic material to explore such questions as what local music practice and its pathways mean for those who live out their lives in the urban (perhaps impersonal?) setting of modern society or for the rituals and functioning of our society and culture more generally. Finally—and on a more speculative level—are the many many small acts and decisions which, however little recognised, lie behind the continuance of music-making of any wider significance for the fundamental experience and reality of humankind?\n\nAgain, she never falls back on untested assumptions. Critical of the familiar paradigms of the city as inimical to personal control or warmth, and of the romantic sense of “community”, she finds diversity in terms of education, wealth, and occupation—though she does conclude that gender roles remain hard to break through. She reflects on participation by age; and on the ordering of time, noting regularity—along with “rehearsals”, “concerts” and “gigs”, life-cycle and calendrical events (my term, not hers) are important social contexts.\n\nShe elaborates on “pathways” in modern living, stressing that they “depend on the constant hidden cultivation by active participants of the musical practices that, with all their real (not imaginary) wealths and meanings, keep in being the old and new cultural traditions within our society.” Finally, in “Music, society, humanity”, she broaches concepts such as sociability and the search for value; and she ponders, with typical detachment, whether music is somehow different from other social activities.\n\n* * *\n\nIn her Preface for the 2007 edition, Finnegan reflects on golden-age nostalgia, change, ebb and flow rather than decline, new technologies, immigration. She outlines gaps in her study, and how one might update it: she might now pay more attention to mass media, constantly expanding since the 1980s, and the role of cultural, religious, and ethnic “minorities” (then less evident in Milton Keynes than in many English cities) would certainly now play a greater role, including South Asian, Irish, Italian, Polish, Vietnamese, and Somali subgroups.\n\nWhile it’s an urban study, Finnegan’s book has influenced ethnographers in diverse fields, including my own study of Gaoluo village. As she comments, in a passage that applies verbatim to my work there and on the Li family Daoists, her research\n\nenlarged and challenged my own preconceptions, […] tied in to an activity to which I attached real value, and presented me with some complex intellectual, methodological, and moral challenges. […] I was dealing with something that I personally enjoyed and found inspiring. Most of all it involved human beings, not just abstractions or generalisations, and the complex and diverse pathways they both trod and created irrespective of the ways scholars thought they should be behaving. In the end, I still like this study because it is about real people in a real, not pseudonymous, place that existed and exists: about people actively engaging in intensely human practices in which they took trouble and pains, in which they experienced disputes and sociability—and, rightly, delight.\n\nNote the roundup under Society and soundscape, particularly What is serious music?! and Is Western Art Music superior?. See also Just remind me again, what is music?! and Old and new musics. Cf. Das Land ohne Musik, and for lowly tennis players and “ordinary Daoists”, here.\n\nPerfect Pitch\n\nI’ve often cited Nicolas Slonimsky’s brilliant Lexicon of musical invective. So I enjoyed reading his fascinating memoir\n\nPerfect Pitch,\n\nin a revised third edition from 2023, ably edited by his daughter Electra Slonimsky Yourke.\n\nWritten with wit and wisdom at the age of 94, and first published in 1988, it’s a captivating blend of substance and gossip, packed with wonderful anecdotes—a Who’s Who of figures that seemed to matter at the time, part of a niche zeitgeist.\n\nNicolas Slonimsky (1894–1995) (fine website, with A/V; books, including Writings on music, 4 vols., 2005; wiki) was “a typical product of the Russian intelligentsia”—in the early chapters he gives a detailed account of his Russian family history and political turmoil. Already by 1912 his early musical facility led him to describe himself as a “failed wunderkind”.\n\nIn autumn 1918 he left St Petersburg. After stays in Kiev and Yalta, in 1920 he reached Constantinople (pp.85–90), where he found many musicians among the throng of Russian refugees. Lodging with a Greek family, he accompanied Russian dancers, and played for restaurants and silent movies. He composed Obsolete foxtrot and Danse du faux Orient, later included in his Minitudes. After following a girlfriend, a Russian dancer, to Sofia, by late 1921 he arrived in Paris—also inundated by Russian emigrés. There he worked for Serge Koussevitzky for the first time, who introduced him to Stravinsky in Biarritz. Koussevitzky, sorely challenged by irregular time signatures, * asked him to rebar The Rite of Spring for him. Despite moving in cultured circles, Koussevitzky (like Tennstedt later) was not a great reader.\n\nSlonimsky was impressed by Nikolai Obukhov, a “religious fanatic” who made a living as a bricklayer. Inspired by Scriabin, and an unlikely protégé of Ravel, his magnum opus Le livre de vie for voices, orchestras, and two pianos (Preface here) contained “moaning, groaning, screaming, shrieking, and hissing”. He dreamed of “having his music performed in an open-air amphitheatre, perhaps in the Himalayas or some other exotic place”. He developed the croix sonore, a prototype of the theremin.\n\nIn 1923 Slonimsky docked in New York, travelling on a Nansen passport, “an abomination of desolation, the mark of Cain, the red spot of a pariah”. He soon found work as opera coach for the new Eastman School of Music in Rochester, at the invitation of Vladimir Rosing. He now confronted the challenge of learning English. Indeed, the book is full of gleeful comments on language learning. Taking advertising slogans as his textbook, Slonimsky’s arrangements (particularly Children cry for Castoria!) became popular. America seemed a fairy-tale land. At Eastman he found a kindred soul in author Paul Horgan.\n\nIn 1924 Koussevitzky replaced Pierre Monteux as conductor of the Symphony Orchestra (whose musicians were mainly German, French, and Russian), and the following year he invited Slonimsky to become his secretary (feeling more like a “serf”). Koussevitzky was in awe of Rachmaninoff’s genius, and despite his withering assessments of rival conductors, he did promote Mitropoulos and Bernstein; he was dismissive of Arthur Fiedler’s Boston Pops (cf. the splendid Erich Leinsdorf story). Much as he valued Slonimsky’s talents, his insecurity meant that his young protégé always had to tread carefully, and in 1927 they parted company.\n\nStill, he now enjoyed a “meteoric” conducting career. With no illusions about his rudimentary technique, he founded the Chamber Orchestra of Boston, promoting contemporary composers—notably Henry Cowell, Edgard Varèse, and Charles Ives. After a performance of a work by Cowell, they rejoiced in the headline “”Uses egg to show off piano”. Slonimsky introduced Aaron Copland to George Gershwin. After Cowell introduced Slonimsky to Charles Ives, they became close.\n\nHenry Cowell with Charles Ives, 1952.\n\nSlonimsky was full of praise for Ives:\n\nI learned to admire the nobility of his thought, his total lack of selfishness, and his faith in the inherent goodness of mankind. […] He inveighed mightily against self-inflated mediocrity, in politics and art alike. The most disparaging word in his vocabulary was “nice”. To him, it signified smugness, self-satisfaction, lack of imagination. He removed himself from the ephemeral concerns of the world at large. He never read newspapers. He did not own a radio or a phonograph, and he rarely if ever attended concerts.\n\nIn 1931 (the year he gained US citizenship), Slonimsky gave the première of Ives’s Three places in New England in New York. Promoting the work with passion, in Perfect pitch he waxes lyrical about its genius.\n\nSlonimsky conducting Varèse’s Ionisation in Havana.\n\nHe was invited to conduct in Havana, his first experience of modern Cuban music. He conducted revelatory concerts in Paris, sponsored by Ives, encouraged by Varèse. There too he married Dorothy Adlow.\n\nHe returned to Europe for more concerts in 1932—with Bartók giving the Paris premiere of his 1st piano concerto, and Rubinstein playing Brahms’s 2nd piano concerto!!! In Berlin (in the nick of time before the grip of Nazism) he conducted the Berlin Phil in a modern programme including Three places in New England and Varèse’s Arcana. He repeated the programme in Budapest.\n\nHe reflects on this ephemeral phase of his career:\n\nThe art of conducting is paradoxical, for its skills range from the mechanical to the inspirational. A conductor can be a semaphore endowed with artificial intelligence, or an illuminating spirit of music. The derisive assertion that “anyone can conduct” is literally true: musicians will play no matter how meaningless or incoherent the gestures of a baton wielder may be. In this respect, conductors stand apart from other performers. A violinist, even a beginner, must be able to play on pitch with a reasonable degree of proficiency. A pianist must have enough technical skill to get through a piece with a minimum of wrong notes. But a conductor is exempt from such obligations. He does not have to play; he orders others to play for him.\n\nThis leads him to some wonderful stories about badly-behaved conductors (cf. Viola jokes and maestro-baiting); Toscanini, Klemperer—and this story, evoking the unwelcome posturings of many a later maestro:\n\nMengelberg once apostrophised his first cello player with a long diatribe expounding the spiritual significance of a certain passage. “Your soul in distress yearns for salvation,”, he recited. “Your unhappiness mounts with every passing moment. You must pray for surcease of sorrow!” “Oh, you mean mezzo forte,” the cellist interrupted impatiently.\n\nI’m eternally grateful to Slonimsky for relating some classic Ormandy maxims (now joyously expanded here by members of the Philadelphia orchestra)—OK then, just a couple:\n\nSuddenly I was in the right tempo, but it wasn’t.\n\nWho is sitting in that empty chair?\n\nIn “Disaster in Hollywood” he tells how his first appearance with the LA Phil in 1932 ended in tears. When the programmes for his eight-week season at the Hollywood Bowl in the summer of 1933 proved far too challenging for the “moneyed dowagers”, his conducting career came to an inglorious end. He takes consolation in the later admission of the works that he championed to the pantheon (cf. the fine story of Salonen’s interview for the LA Phil!). Meanwhile in New York he conducted, and recorded, Varèse’s revolutionary Ionisation.\n\nWith typical linguistic flourishes, he devotes a proud chapter to the birth of his daughter Electra, editor of the volume. He rearranged a limerick:\n\nThere was a young woman named Hatch\n\nWho was fond of the music of Batch\n\nIt isn’t so fussy\n\nAs that of Debussy\n\nSit down, I’ll play you a snatch.\n\nHe would have enjoyed these limericks, and one by Alan Watts, n.2 here.\n\n“Like gaseous remnants of a shattered comet lost in an erratic orbit”, occasional conducting engagements still came his way. In “Lofty baton to lowly pen” he recalls his transition to musical lexicography. He met fellow Russian emigrés Léon Theremin (whose life was to take a very different course) and the iconoclastic theoretician Joseph Schillinger. As Slonimsky compiled his book Music since 1900 (1937!), he became interested in the savage reception of new music, leading to his brilliant Lexicon of musical invective.\n\nStill, he was never tied to his desk. His appetite whetted by his trips to Cuba, in “Exotic journeys” he recalls his 1941–42 tour of Brazil (hearing Villa Lobos’s tales of his Amazonian adventures), Argentina, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Columbia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Mexico. His book Music of Latin America was published in 1945.\n\nReturning to Boston, he was plunged into family duties. In 1947 he published Thesaurus of scales and melodic patterns.\n\nIn 1935, armed with a US passport, he returned to his birthplace, now called Leningrad, visiting long-lost relatives. He reflects on the death of his mother in 1944, and the life of his aunt Isabelle Vengerova (1877–1956), who became a legendary piano teacher in the States.\n\nAfter the war, with Russia in vogue in the USA, Slonimsky enjoyed revising his proficiency in his mother tongue, updating old manuals to teach students and taking on work as translator. While he was largely free of McCarthyite suspicion of sympathising with Communism, back in the USSR his brother Michael was at far greater risk for being suspected of opposing it (for Soviet life, note The whisperers).\n\nDissatisfied with previous compendia and nerdily meticulous, he found a new mission in updating Baker’s biographical dictionary of musicians. He was proud of his 1960 article “The weather at Mozart’s funeral”. In 1956 he achieved unprecedented celebrity through appearing on the quiz show The big surprise.\n\nIn “The future of my past” he describes another trip to the USSR and the Soviet bloc in 1962–63, funded by the State Department—an Appendix to the third edition provides a detailed account. He visited Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, as well as Greece and Israel. On his meetings with musicians, he was inspired by the energy of Ukrainian and Georgian composers.\n\nHis diary is punctuated by his curiosity about language, starting in Moscow:\n\nTo my Americanised ears, the new Soviet language sounded almost theatrical in its emphasis, deliberate articulation, and expressive caesuras. I also noticed a proliferation of diminutives….\n\nIn Prague he learned the vowel-less tongue-twister Strc prst skrz krk:\n\nI used this phrase as the supposed title of a choral work by the mythical Czech composer Krsto Zyžik, whom I invented and whose name I was tempted (I ultimately desisted) to include as the last entry in my edition of Baker’s.\n\nBut soon after his return to Boston his wife Dorothy had a heart attack, which was to be fatal. Bereft after her death in January 1964, he welcomed the offer of a post at distant UCLA. He composed musical limericks for his students’ benefit, but was not always impressed by their aptitude, citing gems from their essays such as “A piano quintet is a piece for five pianos”.\n\nAfter two seasons he reached compulsory retirement age, but he was never going to go quietly. In LA he enjoyed a wide social circle. Besides many “flaky” composer friends was John Cage, now a guru (Slonimsky cites Pravda: “His music demoralises the listeners by its neurotic drive and by so doing depresses the proletarian urge to rise en masse against capitalism and imperialism”!).\n\nWith John Cage, and Frank Zappa.\n\nBack in LA, he made friends with Frank Zappa, who invited him to play at his gig.\n\nDancing Zappa, wild audience, and befuddled me: I felt like an intruder in a mad scene from Alice in Wonderland. I had reached my Age of Absurdity.\n\nMeanwhile with perestroika in the Soviet Union, Slonimsky was becoming quite a celebrity there too, making several more visits and admiring composers’ creativity in new idioms.\n\n* * *\n\nFar more than a mere entertainer, Slonimsky was a major figure in promoting new music. With his eclectic tastes, I can’t help thinking that he would have enjoyed gravitating to ethnomusicology, questioning the wider meanings of “musician” or “composer” (see e.g. Nettl); but he was deeply rooted in the WAM styles of Russian classics and the American avant-garde. Still, within the world of WAM literature it makes a most fascinating memoir.\n\nFor some reason it fills me with joy to learn that a Japanese translation of Lexicon of musical invective has been published.\n\n* Even 5/8 was too much for Koussevitzky:\n\nHe had a tendency to stretch out the last beat, counting “one, two, three, four, five, uh”. This ‘uh” constituted the sixth beat, reducing Stravinsky’s spasmodic rhythms to the regular heartbeat. When I pointed this out to him, he became quite upset. It was just a luftpause, he said. The insertion of an “air pause” reduced the passage to a nice waltz time, making it very comfortable to play for the violin section, who bore the brunt of the syncopation, but wrecking Stravinsky’s asymmetric rhythms.\n\nMahler, Brahms, Schoenberg\n\nSource: review.\n\nJust days after the Zemlinsky and Schoenberg Prom, I went back to the Albert Hall for another course of late Romanticism, with the talented Ryan Wigglesworth conducting the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra (listen on BBC Sounds).\n\nI don’t think I ever played Brahms 3 (make what you will of that uncertainty…). Well-received at the time, but now perhaps the least popular of his symphonies (I can’t miss any opportunity to remind you of Kleiber‘s Brahms 2!), it always deserves a re-hearing. l’ve been getting to know it better by listening to some classic recordings—\n\nBruno Walter and the Vienna Phil, 1936:\n\nFurtwängler with the Berlin Phil, 1949:\n\nAbbado fifty years later, again with the Berlin Phil (still largely a woman-free zone):\n\nThen we heard Schoenberg’s tone-poem Verklaerte Nacht (1899) (wiki, and here), in the string orchestra version that he later arranged from his string sextet. The latter was premiered by the augmented Rosé quartet—here are members of the Ensemble Intercontemporain with Boulez, c1985:\n\nAnd this is Mitropoulos with the strings of the Vienna Phil in 1958:\n\nThe Prom ended withMahler’sKindertotenlieder (1904, to texts by Rückert), movingly sung by Alice Coote. Here’s her recording from 2017 (along with the Rückert Lieder):\n\nAnd here’s Janet Baker’s classic recording with Barbirolli, 1969 (cf. their Nuits d’été):\n\n* * *\n\nBack at the Prom, a more conventional sequence might have opened with Verklaerte nacht followed by the Mahler songs, with the Brahms symphony as a traditional second half; but the chronological order made a lot of sense, intensifying Mahler’s prophetic, tragic vision. All three pieces end quietly. I still don’t quite get a sense of coherence from Brahms 3, but it’s growing on me—Wigglesworth conducted it without the score, bringing out its chamber music elements. Despite its portentous opening, and hints that the finale might become grandiose, it’s largely elegiac, its middle movements unassuming yet affecting.\n\nThe second half was full-on in its intensity. Verklaerte nacht is a major work, long predating Strauss’s Metamorphosen; “filled with crepuscular angst” (as the BBC website has it), the writing especially favours the violas (always good to hear). BTW, and FWIW, the ever-stimulating Richard Taruskin (The danger of music, pp.325–6) doesn’t buy Schoenberg’s resort to extolling “pure” music in his attempt to deflect the misogyny of Richard Dehmel’s poem (“an immanently sinful modern Eve forgiven and redeemed by a godlike magnanimous man”). Finally, Alice Coote’s dramatised grief was perfect for the Kindertotenlieder (for her Mahler 3 with Michael Tilson Thomas earlier this year, click here). For me, the brief coda to the final song doesn’t suddenly sweep aside the anguish of the cycle—it seems more spooky than serene.\n\nRyan Wigglesworth’s serious, sincere musicking seems to convey a feeling of trust, free of the dubious trend for the flashy wizzkids who have replaced the dour, autocratic maestros of Yore. The composer-conductor combo doesn’t always yield results, but when it does it’s deeply satisfying, as with Salonen, Boulez—and clearly Mahler. But now that I observe the WAM scene as a mere outsider, I’m no longer privy to the more salient assessments of the musicians themselves.\n\nFor all my immersion in “world music” and its diverse social contexts, having been Promming since the 1960s, I always find it a blessing that concerts like this generate such attention and enthusiasm—nightly over nearly two months.\n\nFootball in Stalinist Albania\n\nwith asides on religion and the alliance with China\n\nIn a curious spinoff from Euro 24, I came across the intriguing\n\nPhil Harrison, Inside the hermit kingdom: football stories from Stalinist Albania (2024) (extract here).\n\nI trust you understand why I just had to read it. The modern history of Albania holds a grim fascination for outsiders. For a book clearly aimed at a popular market, Harrison’s obsession with football through the period seems to me on a par with that of scholars who document early Daoist ritual—or does his dogged optimism resemble mine in supposing I can make the modern travails of household Daoists palatable?!\n\nInside the hermit kingdom was “written by accident”, with major input from Irvin, an Albanian expat whose own story remains opaque. * While Harrison is aware of the dangers of portraits of Albania that “instil a sense of Western, capitalist superiority”, he inevitably paints a bleak picture, sometimes reminiscent of the spoof travel guide Molvania. The account is punctuated with “Iconic games” and vignettes on the careers of some of the major stars. There may not be such a thing as a casual reader here, but fair-weather fans may find it somewhat excessive to plough through some of the detailed reports of the most obscure matches ever.\n\nThe book opens in 1905 with the arrival of Christian missionaries in the “tribal backwaters” of mountainous Shkodër, beset by banditry, a Maltese priest founding the first club in 1912. The craze soon spread (cf. Futbol in Turkey, then and now).\n\nHarrison soon plunges us into the vernacular of Albanian football terminology: positions on the pitch, organisations, and slang (humbje hapësire “a waste of space”).\n\nHe describes early internationals and the Zog-Mussolini axis. In April 1939 Mussolini’s forces invaded Albania, forcing King Zog into exile. We learn the stoies of two outstanding players among the Albanians recruited to Serie A, and of the Balkan Cup, held from 1946.\n\nClubs were now controlled by the army and police. Dinamo Tirana was founded in 1950—its stadium (above, via Fussball Geekz) built in 1956 by political prisoners supervised by armed militia, with many of the conscripts dying from exhaustion and injuries. In 1958 Partizani took part in the Spartakiad tournament in the GDR between army-affiliated clubs from the communist countries of the world.\n\n“Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship in battle between\n\nthe peoples of China and Albania!” Source.\n\nAfter the death of Stalin in 1953 Enver Hoxha’s relationship with the Soviet Union eroded, deteriorating further in 1956, until the rupture of 1961 which led to Albania’s solitary alliance with Maoist China. In 1957, the wave of Albanianization was evident in the political renaming of many football clubs. Harrison shows how the “golden goal” dates back to 1961 Albania.\n\nQuite the most remarkable image I know:\n\nformer Buddhist monk with village disciples, suburban Beijing 1959.\n\nWith religion suppressed under Hoxha, it was replaced by the ritual and passion of Sunday-afternoon football, a “communal protest against oppression and servility”. Asking “How did football make Albanians feel?”, Harrison describes wages, bicycles, cigarettes (with an aside on their manufacture), alcohol, transistor radios, and racing pigeons. In Tirana from the 1960s, Gimi’s tiny kiosk was a hub of activity, not only selling newspapers and magazines but serving as ticket office for the Albanian Football Federation. At the stadium one stand, the Tribuna, was reserved for army, police, and Party members. The only refreshments available were fara grilled sunflower seeds, wrapped in paper cones sold from tezga usherette trays. For away matches, with train links rudimentary, diehard supporters would undertake a three- or four-hour bike ride, or hitch a lift on an army truck. Attempting access to foreign matches via satellite TV was fraught with danger.\n\nPolitical anxieties were pervasive, with society surveilled by the Sigurimi secret police (eight of whose nine directors were themselves imprisoned and executed between 1943 and 1991), and the spectre of labour camps. In 1967 star player Skënder Halili was caught selling two wristwatches and sentenced to hard labour in the mines of Bulqiza, eventually cause of his death in 1982—attendance at his funeral marking a small-scale protest against the regime.\n\n“Truth over religion”, screenshots.\n\nIn 1966–67, just as the Summer of Love was under way in the West, Hoxha, emulating Mao’s Cultural Revolution, clamped down still more harshly on religion and Western influence. He sponsored the making of the 1967 propaganda film E vërteta mbi fenë [Truth over religion] (do watch here). Among the casualties were Catholic priests, imams, and leaders of the Bektashi order (cf. Turkey; for another niche topic, see Shamans in the two Koreas). This was among several waves of violent religious persecution throughout the Soviet bloc since the 1920s. I’m keen to learn more of the underground maintenance of religious traditions, one of my main themes for China; in Skopje, for instance, just northeast from Albania, a remarkable 1951 film shows self-mortification rituals of the Rufai order.\n\nSource.\n\nBack with the football, the 1966–67 “Championship of Coals” was subject to murky political interference. And in typical detail, Harrison describes the plucky goalless draw with West Germany in 1967 (above), watched from the Tribuna by Party stalwarts and Chinese dignitaries. I wonder about the lives of those visiting diplomats, who had somehow survived the Anti-Rightist purge, the Great Leap Backward and famine—now to find themselves exchanging cautious platitudes at a football match in a remote third-world country just as chaotic violence was being unleashed back home at the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nAs purges continued, Albania became even more isolated. Harrison now devotes a substantial chapter to Fatmir Shima (with the catchy subtitle “the man from Xhomlliku”), father of his guide Irvin, who played in a lower division from 1969 to 1975 (cf. ordinary tennis players, Daoists, musicians, and so on), a temporary diversion from his career in agronomy. The chapter ends with another iconic game, between Tirona and Ajax, with predictable cultural clashes. Meanwhile Italian clubs were still scouting for Albanian players.\n\nUnder Hoxha the Gheg city of Shkodër was penalised, but its Vllaznia team rose to win the Kampionati Kombetar league in 1971–72, first of several successes over the following years—as the culture of Tirana at last no longer seemed so impregnable, people began to sense new possibilities.\n\nHarrison continues to excel in arcane nerdiness with his account of the Dinamo club, which enjoyed success through the 1950s but then languished until the 1970s. Again he ends with an iconic game, between Partizani and Celtic for the 1979 European Cup—hair once again making a potential flashpoint. The game was “a sell-out, with ticket prices ranging from 7p to 21p”.\n\nOne of the great ironies of the piece is that Celtic’s players—upon their visit to Tirana during the dire, ramshackle days of the late 1970s—were privy to observing a failing city that was grim, penurious, and devoid of hope; a place of limited prospects.\n\nIn an act verging on satire, Vata—the first Albanian footballer to ever play in Scotland—made the reverse journey to his Celt predecessors 13 years later, keen to see what the world outside of Albanian borders had to offer. He now continues, by choice, to live in Hamilton.\n\nBy the 1970s, the Sino-Albanian collaboration suffered from Hoxha’s disillusion with China’s new rapprochement with the USA. Entirely isolated from 1978 once Chinese funding was discontinued, Albania was in an even more desperate plight. As audiences for the major games declined, people turned to futboll lagjesh “neighbourhood football”, a version of Italian calcetto. Harrison praises the creative improvisation of this five-a-side street style, “an inclusive, democratic idea set against an autocratic backdrop; an arcane act of defiance hiding within plain sight”, with vivid vignettes of the architecture of suburban east Tirana. But “with increased popularity came increased scrutiny”. “Enacting a class war”, a team from privileged Blloku ended up playing a rancorous game against a local Roma team, ending in a brawl and the sending of the Roma to labour camp.\n\nBy the early 80s, the regime was on its knees. As Hoxha lay dying, links were being forged with Italy, Greece, and Turkey. Within Albania, funding for football dwindled further. But apart from the long dominance of Tirana and Shkodër, KS Labinoti (in Elbasan county in central Albania) emerged as a contender. And the national team was making progress, at first through Shyqyri Rreli’s leadership of the under-21 team, and then in the 1984 World Cup qualifiers—with another blow-by-blow account of Albania’s magnificent 2-0 win over Belgium in Tirana. Albania narrowly failed to qualify for the Mexico 1986 World Cup, but the seed had been sown.\n\nNo nation has endured a more ill-tempered relationship with Europe’s footballing community than Albania. […] The Party remained unswervingly peevish in its interactions with the outside world, and this innate narrow-mindedness transposed itself on to sport.\n\nHarrison documents the troubled domestic league, and encounters between Albanian and foreign clubs, over the whole period from the death throes of the regime from the late 1980s to the final collapse in 1992—whereupon Albania entered a period of anarchy and crushed dreams, prompting a mass exodus.\n\nBut somehow in football, clubs “trundled on”. The final chapter, “The other side of the abyss”, describes how clubs reverted to pre-Hoxha names, resentment emerged in on-pitch petulance and crowd violence, corporate sponsorship gave rise to a new kind of corruption, and criminal gangs flourished. While the domestic game has suffered, since 2014 the national side has been reborn—with the great majority of the squad playing outside Albania.\n\nThe new, great Albanian players ply their trade elsewhere and are rewarded with huge remuneration and lavish lifestyles, connected to their native people only by ethnicity, not locality or reality.\n\nMemory remains strong:\n\nThe only thing people who lived through Albanian Stalinism still celebrate, or seem to agree on, is the football [… —] a football that unified fans and provided a balm during fifty years of horrific suffering.\n\nOne has to applaud Harrison’s boundless enthusiasm for such a niche project. Of course, football was not the only source of communal celebration; musical gatherings were an important part of social life at the domestic level (see under Musical cultures of east Europe, and Bernard Lortat-Jacob at 80). For other Albanian icons, see the unlikely bedfellows of Norman Wisdom and Mother Teresa. Note also posts under Life behind the Iron Curtain; more on football under A sporting medley: ritual and gender.\n\n* With more detail on football than on social history, Harrison’s scant citations include Margo Rejmer’s collection Mud sweeter than honey: voices of Communist Albania, the memoir Erla Marinaku, “A social history of Socialist Albania, 1975-1991”, and the title Albania—who cares? is suggestive. He would doubtless like to add Lea Ypi’s perceptive 2021 memoir Free: coming of age at the end of history, which I reviewed here.\n\nProms: Zemlinsky and Schoenberg\n\nFor my first Prom this season, I went to hear Ryan Bancroft directing the BBC National Orchestra of Wales in Zemlinsky’s Die Seejungfrau and Schoenberg’s Pelléas und Melisande, premiered at the same concert in 1905. Having already written about both works, I was glad to hear them live.\n\nIn my youth, besides Ravel‘s Daphnis and Chloé, Schoenberg’s Pelléas left a deep impression on me, attending rehearsals and concerts in the fluid hands of Boulez; with his choices there was always a sense of discovery. At this week’s Prom I could only summon up fleeting glimpses of that magic, but (within the niche of ominous late-Romantic angst) Pelléas is perhaps rather more accessible, so it probably made sense to open the concert with it, building the audience’s attention for Die Seejungfrau after the interval. But either order could work. Ryan Bancroft, brought up in LA, directed fluently—like Boulez, conveying the music with his hands rather than a baton.\n\nSource.\n\nYou can hear the concert on BBC Sounds for the next two months. A sumptuous fin-de-siècle opening to the season, then—the previous evening Mark Elder conducted Mahler 5 in his Proms farewell to the Hallé after 25 years with them (available on BBC iPlayer). Even if Mahler towers over just about everyone (do consult my series!), it’s always rewarding to explore the work of his contemporaries and disciples, and to immerse ourselves in the whole culture of early-20th-century Vienna. Though the hall was less than packed, how wonderful that Prom-goers devote such attention and enthusiasm to the less familiar aspects of the symphonic repertoire.\n\nJust a few days later came another fine late-Romantic Prom.\n\nSome German tongue-twisters\n\nWhereas the mind-boggling “tapeworm words” in my post on Some German mouthfuls are of a practical nature, the realm of fantasy opens up whole new linguistic vistas. In a stimulating article, Deborah Cole introduces the work of the Berlin-based cabaret performer, playwright, and pianist Bodo Wartke.\n\nShe begins with some drôle political context:\n\nAnnegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a former defence minister with a dastardly difficult name to say, was long seen as a likely successor to the relatively pronounceable ex-chancellor, Angela Merkel. Kramp-Karrenbauer’s resignation as the conservatives’ party chief came as a relief to news presenters the world over, clearing the way for the tight three-syllabic Olaf Scholz. Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, once a federal justice minister and the ultimate double-barrelled tongue-tripper, was not invited to join his cabinet.\n\nNow Bodo Wartke and his musical partner Marti Fischer have gone viral with their rap-tinged Zungenbrecher (“tongue-breakers”)—notably “Barbaras Rhabarberbar” (recorded in 144 takes!), the story of a bar owner named Barbara who enchants all who try her rhubarb cake, including a group of bushy-bearded, beer-swilling barbarians who bring their barber back to try a bite:\n\nThis was followed by a charming sequel:\n\nAll this is entertaining for Germans and “reliably hilarious to foreigners”. With further links, Cole’s article makes good points about the history and appeal of German tongue-twisters. In English, this video is delightful too.\n\nIn Chinese, see A tongue-twister for the household Daoist. The apotheosis of word play, not to be missed, is Nicolas Roberton’s series of Anagram tales. See also under Language learning: a roundup.\n\nEmpireland\n\nThoughtful analysis of the legacy of empire is part of a productive academic trend—one which is being vehemently resisted in the corridors of entrenched power, fulminating against the “Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati” (links e.g. here; cf. Fatima Manji, Hidden heritage, and sources there).\n\nSathnam Sanghera, Empireland: how imperialism has shaped modern Britain (2021)\n\nmakes an engaging, accessible summary of research (among reviews, Guardian; LSE; and on the sequel Empireworld, LRB).\n\nIn the opening chapter Sanghera imagines a revival of Empire Day that would be more educational. As he notes,\n\nIt’s all very well highlighting empire awareness by talking about how our honours list still hands out Orders of the British Empire, how many of our common garden plants were originally imported into Britain by imperialists, or how Worcestershire sauce might originally have been an Indian recipe, reportedly brought back to Britain by an ex-governor of Bengal. But our imperial past has had a much more profound effect on modern Britain.\n\nEmpire explains why we have a diaspora of millions of Britons spread around the world. Empire explains the global pretensions of our Foreign and Defence secretaries. Empire explains the feeling that we are exceptional and can go it alone when it comes to dealing with everything from Brexit to dealing with global pandemics. Empire helped to establish the position of the City of London as one of the world’s major financial centres, and also ensures that the interests of finance trump the interests of so many other groups in the 21st century. Empire explains how some of our richest families and institutions became wealthy. Empire explains our particular brand of racism, it explains our distrust of cleverness, our propensity for jingoism. Let’s face it, imperialism is not something that can be erased with a few statues being torn down or a few institutions facing up to their dark pasts or a few accomplished individuals declining an OBE; it exists as a legacy in my very being and, more widely, explains nothing less than who we are as a nation.\n\nPrelude to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre (Amritsar):\n\n“All native men were forced to crawl the Kucha Kurrichhan on their hands and knees\n\nas punishment, 1919″. Source: wiki.\n\nHe frankly explores his Punjabi Sikh background, and demolishes the “futile and misleading” balance sheet of “was the Empire good or bad?”. Chapter 4, “Emotional loot” gives an instructive take on the 1903 British invasion of Tibet (“the Younghusband expedition”), leading him to consider the massive stock of looted artefacts that adorns our museums and stately homes, and the bitter debate over restitution. Chapter 5, “We are here because you were there”, opens in Brighton with the story of Dean Mahomed (1759–1851) (also explored by Fatima Manji), leading to an outline of the early presence of black and brown people in Britain.\n\nSanghera reflects on nostalgia for the Raj, the persistent self-isolation of expat communities around the world, and their taste for British food and education; on the irony of the British search for adventure (“There is no shortage on Instagram of people who confuse travelling with having a personality”); on the lure of sexual opportunity, and prudery; and on the vanity of our claim to be “world-beating”. An intriguing insight on empire’s fetish for manliness:\n\nIt was not uncommon to find men with a stammer working in administrative roles in the Indian Civil Service—to have a position in empire instantly gave a man kudos, and a speech impediment might be overlooked for “empire served as proof for masculinity”.\n\nEmpireland is full of such instructive byways, such as the history of gin and tonic, “the cornerstone of the British Empire” (Spanish fly 1976):\n\nGin to fight the boredom of exile and quinine to fight malaria. How else do you think we could have carried the cross of responsibility for the life of millions without the friendly fortitude of gin and tonic?\n\nSanghera cites a Tweet by Helen Zaltzman:\n\nBritain is hostile to people arriving in boats because Britain knows what happened when Britain arrived in other countries in boats.\n\nChapter 8, “Dirty money” continues to unearth the foundations of British wealth, while carefully identifying the complex issues. Just as balanced is Chapter 9, “The origins of our racism”:\n\nTo say Britain has a dark history of racism which influences contemporary psychology and culture […] does not preclude, for me, the fact that it simultaneously, if inadvertently, inspired anti-racism.\n\nSource.\n\nIn Chapter 10, “Empire state of mind”, Sanghera returns to his own experience, pondering the public school system, analysing the warped psychology of Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg along with other recent Tory fatuities—but finding inspiration in the work of Edward Said. Chapter 11, “Selective amnesia”, pinpoints a major theme of troubled national histories around the world (see e.g. Memory, music, society), with a trenchant vignette on Britain’s obsession for India’s railways—citing Katherine Schofield’s hashtags #OccasionalMassacre and #ButTheRailways. He introduces James Walvin’s The trader, the owner, the slave as the single best book he has read on slavery—elsewhere he imagines putting Robert Winder, Bloody foreigners on the national curriculum.\n\nChapter 12, “Working off the past”, continues to explore the right-wing backlash against the convincing arguments of historians, but in conclusion he details several reasons to be optimistic. In 2023 he issued a children’s book, Stolen history: the truth about the British Empire and how it shaped us.\n\nJust as reasonable and constructive is his two-part documentary Empire state of mind for Channel 4 (2021). Perhaps you can also find his 2019 film The massacre that shook the Empire. Do consult his useful website.\n\nI remain fond of this definition of patriotism from a Yugoslavian child in the 1990s, cited by Kapka Kassabova:\n\nI love my country. Because it is small and I feel sorry for it.\n\n* * *\n\nEmpireland makes a convenient survey of the major topics in imperialism explored by academics—and relieves bigots of the burden of reading them, allowing them to focus their fulminations on Sanghera. Despite his impartial considerations of the evidence, a counter-movement of denial soon surfaced—which he explores thoughtfully (see also here).\n\nFor what it’s worth, I am actually grateful for a great deal. […] For having had a free education at one of the best grammar schools in the country; for having attended (for free) one of the best colleges at one of the most successful universities in the world; for an NHS that cares for the people I love the most; for a welfare state that has saved my family from the most crushing consequences of poverty; for the chance to live in the greatest city on earth and work on two of the greatest newspapers in the world; for British pop music; for the glorious British countryside; for Pizza Express. But I resent being instructed to demonstrate my gratitude whenever I analyse any aspect of British life, when my white colleagues don’t get the same treatment. Yes, I have had a better life than I would probably have had in India, but I was born here, not India. I am British. I am as entitled to comment on my home nation as the next man and the endless insistence that I demonstrate my gratitude is rooted in racism. Racism which is, in itself, rooted in the fact that the children of imperial immigrants born here are not always seen as fully British.\n\nGiven that many white authors have reached precisely the same conclusions, the backlash against Sanghera and David Olusoga suggests just the kind of racism that this approach exposes, as William Dalrymple observes:\n\n“Despite writing very similar stuff to Sathnam, I have never received a single letter like that. It is a direct result of his ethnicity and skin colour,” says Dalrymple, whose latest book The anarchy tackles the “relentless” rise of the East India Company. “You can’t really draw any distinction between what Sathnam’s writing and what I’ve written. And my books have got a free pass. There is a very serious distinction to be drawn between what he’s gone through writing what he has on empire, and me as a Caucasian writing the same thing.”\n\nBTW, Sanghera, Olusoga, and Dalrymple are just the kind of scholars I would love to see elaborating on my speculations about the early-19th-century reversal of the black and white keys on fortepianos in the context of slavery and empire.\n\nA film on the qin zither\n\nLest anyone despair that my Chinese theme has recently been submerged\n\nbeneath football and tennis…\n\nHaving studied the qin zither obsessively for my first few years after coming to China in 1986, I then defected—feeling not exactly unworthy but just too immersed in the utterly different world of folk ritual life in the poor countryside (see Taking it on the qin). So my posts on this elite solo tradition (see qin tag) are partly an attempt to atone for jumping ship. The qin being a genuine ivory tower, we might try and see the wood for the trees (make up your own metaphors—though “Swirls before pine” is unbeatable!).\n\nJohn Thompson has never wavered in his devotion to the qin. The documentary\n\nMusic beyond sound: an American’s world of guqin (Lau Shing-hon, 2019)\n\n(watch here; introduction here, with links)\n\nmakes a useful introduction to his lifelong work. Interspersed with lengthy sequences in which he plays his reconstructions of Ming pieces at scenic spots in Hong Kong and Hangzhou (in the mode of the literati of Yore), he reflects on his early life, his later path, and the state of the qin (biography here). Subtitles are in both English and Chinese. It’s something of an illustrated lecture, with testimonials.\n\nFrom a background in Western Art Music (WAM), John was drawn to early music, as well as popular music and jazz. After graduating in 1967 he was confronted with the draft, serving in Military Intelligence in Vietnam (cf. Bosch) for eighteen months and making trips around East Asia. Already educating himself on Chinese culture, he returned to the USA to attend graduate school in Asian Studies, studying Chinese language and discovering “world music” through ethnomusicology, learning the Japanese shamisen. In those early days before the vast revival of traditional Chinese culture around 1980, he was understandably underwhelmed by the bland diet of conservatoire dizi and erhu solos. Instead, through reading the seminal work of Robert van Gulik, The lore of the Chinese lute, he became fascinated with the highly literate, prescribed microcosm of the qin. *\n\nFor this his best option was Taiwan, where from 1974 to 1976 he studied with Sun Yu-ch’in (1915–90); he then studied with Sun’s accomplished pupil Tong Kin-woon and the veteran Tsar Deh-yun (1905–2007) ** in Hong Kong, where he made his home. While learning from the qin renaissance in mainland China before and after the Cultural Revolution, he has forged his own path performing and researching early tablatures; setting forth from reconstructing the 64 pieces in the 1425 Shenqi mipu (6-CD compendium with 72-page booklet, 2000), he avidly sought out other early tablatures (CD Music beyond sound, 1998).\n\nThis may seem like a niche within a niche, and it’s an even more solitary pursuit, but the search for early pieces vastly expands the small repertoire handed down from master to pupil. All this work gave rise to his remarkable website.\n\nIn the PRC since the 1960s the traditional silk strings of the qin were largely replaced by metal, though they persisted in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and there are some advocates on the mainland. In keeping with his taste for historical recreation, John is a fervent advocate of silk strings (see this typically exhaustive essay).\n\nIn Hong Kong he also served as Programme Adviser for the Festival of Asian Arts from 1980 to 1998. In 2001 he married Suzanne Smith and they moved to New Jersey. Alongside his ongoing research he continues to engage with the qin scene in mainland China, where his work is respected. In 2010 he was among fourteen masters invited to take part in a festival at the Zhejiang Museum to play qin zithers from the Tang dynasty (!!!) (click here; for a 2019 festival, here). Like other wise qin players, confronted by the performance ethos of the conservatoire and the Intangible Cultural Heritage, he valiantly proclaims the literati aesthetic of self-cultivation.\n\n* * *\n\nWhile silkqin.com contains a vast range of material, John remains devoted to recreating Ming tablatures (still, I find it refreshing to hear him explaining that in such an oral tradition, there was no need for tablature!). The site contains ample material on the changing modern practice of the qin, but the social context before, during, and since Maoism (suggested in my series on the qin zither under Maoism) is not his main theme. Clearly the quietism the film evokes (cf. the spiritual quest of Bill Porter) is remote from the “red and fiery” atmosphere of the folk festivities that I frequent, but the social bond of PRC qin gatherings is also largely absent.\n\nIn the Chinese media the dominance of elite imperial culture is stark; online there is a wealth of information on the qin, whereas material for far more common traditions (such as the rituals of spirit mediums) is elusive. While John’s comments on the differences between early WAM and “Chinese music” are thoughtful, the vast variety of the latter cannot be represented by the qin; his dedicated study of one aspect of an elite tradition hardly allows room to absorb the wider context.\n\nBruno Nettl has wise words on “you [foreigners] will never understand our music” (The study of ethnomusicology: thirty-three discussions, ch.11). Conversely, I’m tired of the old clichés “Why should a foreigner study Chinese culture?” and “The monk from outside knows how to recite the scriptures“. Within China there are plenty of “monks to recite the scriptures”; no-one there would ever suggest that the qin is only understood by foreigners. John is indeed exceptional in his long-term in-depth study, but further afield this kind of thing is common—as is clear from the careers of other foreign scholar-performers such as Ric Emmert for Japanese noh drama, Veronica Doubleday for Afghan singing, or Nicolas Magriel for the sarangi in India. ***\n\nIn the sinosphere, whereas scholars rarely engage in participant observation for folk music, for the qin performing and scholarship tend to go hand in hand. So alongside the majority of qin players who have been content to transmit the repertoire that they learned from their teachers are some distinguished masters who unearth and recreate early historical sources—such as Zha Fuxi, Yao Bingyan, Tong Kin-woon, Bell Yung, Dai XIaolian, and Lin Chen. John’s work as performer and scholar is a particularly intense instance of this historical focus, a niche in the wider movement of Historically Informed Performance (HIP: see e.g. Richard Taruskin, John Butt).\n\nQin fraternities are now thriving in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and around the world. Senior figures on the Hong Kong scene include Tsar Teh-yun, Tong Kin-woon, Lau Chor-wah, and Bell Yung. Note also the work of Georges Goormaghtigh. The qin has long been a popular choice for foreign students to study in the PRC.\n\nMy usual point: given its tiny coterie of players, the qin is vastly over-represented in studies of Chinese music! But however niche, the qin is an essential aspect of literati culture through the imperial era, along with poetry, painting and calligraphy; and John Thompson’s work is an essential resource.\n\n* For my own Long March to Chinese music around this time, see Revolution and laowai, and under Ray Man.\n\n** See Bell Yung, The Last of China’s literati (2008), and the 2-CD set The art of qin music (ROI 2000 / AIMP 2014).\n\n*** Note the contrasts between these four cultures, and approaches to them: Emmert working within the “isolated preservation” (Nettl) of noh, Doubleday as participant observer of an Afghan folk tradition soon to be decimated by warfare and fundamentalism, Magriel immersed in the changing social context of sarangi, and Thompson focusing on his own historical recreations of qin music.\n\nFolk cultures of Europe\n\nA major theme of this site is the rich variety of regional folk expressive cultures, in China and around the world. Quite by chance, the compelling drama of Euro 24 has provided me with a wacky perspective to celebrate the wonders of folk cultures around Europe—at a time when all seems lost amidst supermarkets and ring roads, Brexit and the dangerous idiocies of far-right politicians.\n\nAnd as Barney Ronay notes,\n\nSaka is a player you just love to see have these moments, to smile, to remind you […] that this is still at bottom a matter of play, joy, fun, and invention.\n\nMy three recent posts, all with wonderful playlists:\n\nFor the twenty-four teams of the group stage\n\nThe last eight bagpipes standing\n\nSpain, France, England, and (um) Turkey.\n\nSo we might regard Sunday’s final as a contest between the passion of flamenco and, um, Morris dancing—like so:\n\nSouthgate devises a novel wall to defend a free-kick from a youthful Spanish team.\n\nThese posts complement previous regional surveys such as Musical cultures of east Europe, Italy: folk musicking, flamenco, fado (here and here), Irish folk, and so on. See also Bernard Lortat-Jacob at 80. Meanwhile, A sporting medley: ritual and gender has links to other posts on football, as well as snooker, tennis (including a wonderful playlist for Emma and Leylah!), and rugby—for Morris dancing as a suitable response to the All-Black haka, click here.\n\nCurse of the Ninth\n\n*Latest in my Mahler series!*\n\nEver since the very first episode in 2014, the BBC TV comic-noir series Inside No.9 (website; wiki) has been consistently brilliant. Written by and starring Steve Pemberton and Reece Sheersmith, it features cameos from a succession of fine actors. The plot twists are ingenious, the mood sinister and enigmatic.\n\nThe penultimate episode of the ninth (and final!) series (watch here) takes its title from the Curse of the Ninth, attributed to Mahler’s fruitless efforts to trick fate. Typically macabre, it’s “an Edwardian chiller in which a talented piano-tuner is forced to confront the power of a centuries-old curse by the owners and servants of a large country house.” As the drama unfolds, we hear well-chosen excerpts from the 1st movement of Mahler 9.\n\nThe wiki article on the curse gives instances of composers unable to complete their 10th symphony—but also lists counterexamples of others who did manage to do so. So there.\n\n* * *\n\nA random selection of (nine!) other stimulating episodes from Inside No.9:\n\nA quiet night in—largely silent!\n\nThe 12 days of Christine, with Sheridan Smith\n\nThe bill—someone must pay…\n\nDead line, a disconcerting live Halloween special\n\nDeath be not proud\n\nLip service\n\nLast night of the Proms, a most sinister take\n\nMerrily, merrily, with Diane Morgan!\n\nMr King.\n\nThe very final episode Plodding on is ingenious…\n\nEuro 24, the semi-finals: yet another playlist!\n\nIn celebration of folk cultures around Europe\n\nCompiled without regard to expense or the feelings of the public\n\n—Flann O’Brien\n\nOn a roll after my Euro 24 folk playlists for the 24 teams and then for the quarter-finals, here’s another niche selection of funky tracks for the semi-finals! Having covered some bagpipe traditions, I might have gone on to highlight shawms (suitably loud, and widespread), but this playlist (partly derived from previous posts, with some new material) is based on singing and fiddling.\n\nWhatever your feelings about football, just in case you suppose this exercise is a frivolous diversion from weightier matters, it makes an instructive and inspiring reminder of the diversity of European cultures!\n\n* * *\n\nFor Spain, for all its wealth of regional styles (e.g. Songs of Valencia and Festive soundscapes of the Rioja), one can never have enough flamenco (and the documentary series Rito y geografïa del cante is not to be missed!)—here are a few classics from my series.\n\nA saeta for Holy Week sung by Niña de los Peines in 1920:\n\nThe Utrera sisters with Diego del Gastor:\n\nAgujetas el Viejo singing martinetes, 1976:\n\n* * *\n\nAs to France, even I might hesitate to try out Boulez or Messiaen on a football crowd; Un homme et une femme and Comment te dire adieu are tempting, but here I suggest\n\nBarbara Pravi—not least in homage to French multiculturalism, which the French team embody while denouncing the rise of the far-right:\n\nIf it’s folk traditions you’re after (Yeah right—Ed.), then how about\n\nthe world of fiddlers around the Dauphiné in the southeastern Hautes-Alpes, on this 1978 LP of archive recordings—notably the rigodon dance: *\n\n* * *\n\nEngland: more singing with fiddles (from this post on the doyens of the English folk scene)—\n\nhere’s Eliza Carthy and the Ratcatchers, with John Boden and John Spiers of Bellowhead:\n\nBarney Ronay:\n\nSaka is a player you just love to see have these moments, to smile, to remind you […] that this is still at bottom a matter of play, joy, fun, and invention.\n\n* * *\n\nNow don’t get me wrong, I love the Dutch; I should really make an effort with their folk cultures, although recordings (mainly from Friesland) such as Jaap Kunst‘s 1956 LP seem less than enthralling (playlist here, or this clip from a 1963 disc, with images). I’m all for doorstep anthropology, but one can imagine Kunst finding Indonesia a more stimulating fieldsite, and I can see why Antoinet Schimmelpennick set off for China. Still, personal taste isn’t really the brief of the ethnographer.\n\nAll the same, in my self-appointed capacity as referee I’m going to overrule the Netherlands’ second-half goals and pretend Turkey won—because they have been the stars of the tournament, and it feels like they’ve been playing at home. So first,\n\nan early Gastarbeiter song, again protesting racism:\n\nAnother reason for me to bend the rules is because Turkey has some amazing music. Whereas modern France is multicultural, my other choice for Turkey reflects a multicultural past:\n\nthe amane songs of old Istanbul and Asia Minor (cf. Road to rebetika), often accompanied by fiddle, as in this suitably plaintive song by Zehra Bilir:\n\nWell I guess that’s about it for tonght folks! Now read on for those Alpine fiddlers…\n\n* Cf. Le violon traditionel en France (Silex, 1994, with notes by Patrick Mazellier).\n\nThe tracks from 1939, on the eve of war, were recorded by Roger Dévigne (1885–1965):\n\nThe 26th—telegram from the Vice-Chancellor: “Come back immediately”. Mr Jouan Nicola arrived at the same time as the telegram: “I’m here to help you dismantle your recording equipment” he told me. From outside came the continuous rumble of coaches leaving packed with soldiers called up. Off to the station. Long queues of soldiers called up from the mountains, each with his cardboard suitcase…\n\nAdditional items were recorded from 1975 to 1977, featuring the veteran fiddlers Emile “Milou” Escalle (1900–1987), Augustin Istier (1906–89), and Camille Roussin-Bouchard (1909–90).\n\nThe more fanatical football supporter may wish to delve into the fine site violoneux.fr.\n\nDetail of map showing distribution of fiddle traditions in France!\n\nFor a less voluminous introduction to regional styles, click here—citing an 1821 decree:\n\nIt is forbidden to all fiddlers or other instruments forming any gathering around [feasts], they could become responsible for the evil that would result and need to be arrested by order of the Mayor.\n\nSuch sources reflect on the long decline of the traditional context of social dance.\n\nNot so much an impromptu pre-match party as\n\na rigodon at Saint-Pierre-de-Méarotz, Isère, July 1908. Source\n\n(cf. the excellent title Le rigodon n’est pas un fromage!).\n\nHere’s the CD France “Rigodon sauvage”—Alpes du Sud: Dauphiné (Ocora, 1995):\n\nThe purgatory of the tennis circuit\n\nConor Niland after losing to Adrian Mannarino at Wimbledon 2011.\n\nBen Stansall/AFP/Getty Images.\n\nThe life of the concert soloist may seem glamorous, though the routine of airports, hotels, concert halls, and receptions must wear thin. Still, it contrasts with that of rank-and-file orchestral musos (cf. Mozart in the jungle, and Ecstasy and drudge). Apart from The Money, I note the irony of the soloist being condemned to churning out the same three or four concertos all their lives while the orchestral musos are constantly playing a variety of wonderful music (Mahler—you know that’s who I meant).\n\nBy the same token, following Vincent Goossaert’s search for “ordinary Daoists” (theme of his The Taoists of Peking, 1800-1949: a social history of urban clerics), it’s not all about the Du Guangtings and Chen Rongshengs, or about the elite mystical sages of yore. Hence my own search for household Daoist groups like the Li family.\n\nNor is tennis all about the superstars, the Federers and Świąteks, with their ritzy entourages. An interesting Guardian Long Read by Connor Niland, “I’m good, I promise: the loneliness of the low-ranking tennis player”, describes life at the bottom of the top. Formerly No.1 Irish player, he tells a sad story.\n\nHe outlines the three tiers of men’s professional tennis: the ATP Tour for the top 100 male tennis players in the world, the Challenger Tour, mainly by players ranked between 100 and 300—and the Futures tour, “tennis’s vast netherworld of more than 2,000 true prospects and hopeless dreamers”, which\n\nsometimes felt like a circle of hell, but in practical terms it’s better understood as purgatory: a liminal space that exists only to be got out of as quickly as possible.\n\nAs he explains,\n\nSurviving on the Futures and Challenger tournaments isn’t just about being good at tennis. It’s about being able to cope with the strange bedfellows of regular boredom and constant uncertainty. Not many succeed.\n\nHe felt trapped:\n\nI phoned Mum from the airport in Geneva, telling her I was tired and would skip Edinburgh and fly home instead. She wasn’t having that. “This is your job now, Conor,” she said. “You can’t just not turn up because you’re tired.” I remembered my friend and one-time tennis partner Pat Briaud’s words: “Your parents don’t mess around.” I turned up and made the semi-final, losing a feisty two-and-a-half-hour match to Britain’s Jamie Baker. It was my 24th match in five weeks. Exhausted, I collected my prize money: $480, before 20% tax.\n\nBy contrast with the constant media exposure the stars have to endure, loneliness and isolation are the fate of the rank-and-file.\n\nI made virtually no lasting friendships on tour through my seven years, despite coming across hundreds of players my own age living the same life as my own.\n\nAnd he describes the difficulty of finding a practice partner. At least the life of orchestral musos is leavened by an embattled camaraderie—and they share a bond in maestro-baiting and deviant behaviour.\n\nI almost never went sightseeing on a day off. That was partly to conserve energy, partly because I had nobody to go with. And in many of the one-horse towns that hosted Futures events, there weren’t any sights to see. […]\n\nI would return to Ireland from three-week trips to these exotic places with no notable stories or experiences. “How was Morocco?” I would be asked. “Fine,” I would say, with nothing else to add. […]\n\nThe true unfortunates, though, were the ones who were talented enough to rationally hope to advance. These were people who grew up as the best tennis players in their country, but were stuck between 300 and 600 in the world, not quite contending for the Challenger Tour nor the qualifiers at grand slams, but winning just often enough to keep their tennis dream faintly alive. A Futures tournament referee in the US became infamous for his straight-talking to 28-year-old players: “C’mon man, what are you still doing here?” He was straying out of his lane, but his intentions were good. And he was usually right.\n\nNiland ends with a depressing account of a fruitless Challenger event in Uzbekistan. It all sounds a bit like doing a Messiah in Scunthorpe for a jolly good tea. Whether in music, religion, or sport, ethnographic perspectives like this are always valuable.\n\nUnder Sporting medley: ritual and gender I list several posts on tennis.\n\nEuro 24: the last eight bagpipes standing\n\nAnother playlist in a series that football fans didn’t know they needed\n\nNow that the twenty-four teams of Euro 24 have been reduced to eight, I hear you clamouring for a more focused playlist of bagpipe music to represent them (Yes, I am getting my hearing tested).\n\nAmong many sources on the history and distribution of bagpipes, the Essential Vermeer website has instructive material (here and here); and I set forth again from this list. As shown in my previous post, the distribution of instruments rarely aligns with either current or past national boundaries.\n\nGrooving to the gaita. *\n\nStarting with\n\nSpain\n\nPortugal,\n\nhow about gaita from Coimbra (the image by Armando Leça shows an old handmade bagpipe from Coimbra, late 1930s—who knows if such a player inspired Portugal in their 1930 victory over France?!)\n\n—and Galicia:\n\n“Just dig that funky tulum“\n\nTurkey (NB Futbol, then and now)—here’s a great sequence of Black Sea tulum bagpipes (see also under The Pontic lyra!):\n\nFor a related “tapeworm word”, see under Some German mouthfuls!\n\nAround north Europe, with online clips dominated by medieval revivals, living folk traditions are harder to find.\n\nEngland—here’s Kathryn Tickell on Northumbrian smallpipes:\n\nFrance—Breton pipers:\n\nAs to\n\nSwitzerland (not Italy—whence I await more “Caporetto” headlines, to follow those for the 2002 and 2018 World Cup defeats). **\n\nGermany\n\nThe Netherlands (though Romania might have been more fruitful),\n\nreferring back to the Essential Vermeer site, there’s some fine material on peasant bagpipes as depicted by Peter Brueghel the Elder and Jan Steen; and we can seek further for modern vestiges under Dudelsack, Sackpfeife, Doedelzak, and so on.\n\nThere—just what you need to warm up for the quarter-finals eh…\n\nMore football posts under A sporting medley: ritual and gender.\n\n* Sorry to go on, but this comment in the Guardian live-feed reminded me of my own football dream:\n\nThe first time Lamine Yamal joined the Spain squad, they left his boots behind. His and everyone else’s too. When the selección touched down in Tbilisi to face Georgia in September 2023, the trunk carrying part of their kit was still sitting at Barajas, forcing them to complete the evening session at the Boris Paichadze stadium in trainers, unable to strike the ball. The following night, they scored seven. On his debut, the Barcelona winger got the last of them, aged 16 years and 57 days, and the national team got a new beginning.\n\n** Before England’s Great Escape from Slovakia, I was composing our own version of Caporetto, inspired by that popular classic from the Minister for the 18th Century:\n\n“the greatest vassalage since King John paid homage to Phillip II at Le Goulet in 1200”.\n\nMagnificently 🍾🍾🍾 , the Haunted Pencil is now Toast, or Ashes—as the sun came up, he crumbled into dust…\n\nA bijou mosque in Kuzguncuk\n\nI’ve written several posts on the picturesque Istanbul mahalle of Kuzguncuk on the Asian shore of the Bosphorus—notably on Nostalgia for cosmopolitanism, Epiphany, Greek liturgy, The 1955 riots, The kiosk in Turkey and Europe, and Köçek in Kuzguncuk.\n\nSince at least the 19th century Kuzguncuk was mainly populated by Armenians, Jews, and Greeks. By 1933, sources suggest that the population was still 90% non-Muslim. As Amy Mills notes, the present mosque, opposite the iskele ferry and next to the 1835 Armenian church, was only built in 1952, “the first moment in the neighbourhood’s long history when there were enough Muslim Kuzguncuklus to necessitate a local, regular, community gathering space.” It is now blessed with the splendid imam Aydin Hoca (see under The call to prayer).\n\nIt’s taken me all this time to visit the bijou rectangular wooden mosque further up the coast towards the bridge—just below the mansion of Sultan Abdülhamid’s cultured confidant Cemil Molla (1864–1941), who sometimes served as imam there, and just past the yalı waterside residence of Sare Hanım (1914–2000), aunt of left-wing poet Nâzım Hikmet (see here).\n\nBuilt in 1860 by Üryanizade Ahmet Esat Efendi, the mosque was allegedly completed in forty days (see e.g. here). It has a wooden pulpit and preaching platform, and a modest wooden minaret with a single balcony; it has its own boathouse.\n\nLeft, 1946; right, 1973—among old and recent images here.\n\nAfter restoration work started in 2013, the mosque was re-opened for worship in 2017, making a place of great tranquillity, and a reminder of a time when Muslims were a small minority in Kuzguncuk.\n\nUndated.\n\nFurther up the coast in Kanlıca, in the square by the ferry, is the İskender Pasha Mosque, where we heard the noon ezan from a riverside café on my first visit in 2021. Not quite so miniature, but still on a human scale, it was built in 1559–60, designed by the great architect (and former Janissary) Mimar Sinan.\n\nAll this by way of reflecting on the art of the miniature—by contrast with the grandiose projects of the Ottoman sultans that I churlishly avoid. In rather the same way, in China I’ve never visited the Great Wall, but in the countryside humble little “public buildings” are decked out to become the heart of the ritual life of the community.\n\n3rd-moon festival for female deity Houtu, Shenshizhuang, 1996.\n\nSee also under West/Central Asia: a roundup.\n\nVoice of Baceprot\n\nDespite Delighting in All Manifestations of the Terpsichorean muse, I need hardly tell you that Glastonbury is a mystery to me. But to follow We are Lady Parts, I learn of Voice of Baceprot (VoB). An Indonesian all-female metal trio from rural Garut, West Java, they sing in English, Sundanese, and Indonesian (website; wiki; useful survey).\n\nMaking headlines since 2017, their 2018 single School revolution (lyrics) was remixed on EP in 2022. From VoB’s YouTube channel, their 2023 album Retas (Guardian interview) includes tracks like What’s the Holy (Nobel) today?, God, allow me (please) to play music, and [NOT] PUBLIC PROPERTY. Here’s the playlist:\n\nWarming up for Glastonbury (where they are understandably concerned about the weather and the food…), VoB played in London at Downstairs at the Dome—but it was sold out, so I wasn’t distracted from Euro 24—indeed, I would have felt like a tarantula on a slice of angel food cake, in Raymond Chandler‘s fine simile.\n\nThis makes quite a change from Éva Gauthier‘s genteel promotion of gamelan. Note also my roundups on punk (including Croatia, Spain, Iran, Beijing, and the GDR), gender, and West/Central Asia—Like I’d Know…\n\nFolk ritual of Tianjin, and its soundscapes\n\nThe Anthology provides another gateway\n\nLike Beijing nearby, the municipality of Tianjin encompasses a large region, much of it still rural. On ritual and its soundscapes there, my previous articles include\n\nTianjin: a folk Buddhist group\n\nRitual groups of Jinghai\n\nDharma-drumming assoctiations of Tianjin.\n\nSo at last I’ve been trying to digest the relevant volumes on instrumental music of the great Anthology of folk music of the Chinese peoples:\n\nZhongguo minzu minjian qiyuequ jicheng, Tianjin juan 中国民间器乐曲集成, 天津卷 (2008) (2 vols; 1,475 pages),\n\nwhich as ever contain substantial material on ritual traditions. To remind you of my introduction to a similar recent survey for Fujian province in southeast China,\n\nRitual pervades all genres of folk expressive culture: in the Anthology, it is a major theme of the volumes for folk-song, narrative-singing, opera, and dance. In the instrumental music volumes, even genres that lack explicit liturgical content are also invariably performed for ceremonial occasions—but a further reason to consult them is that the specific rubric of “religious music” has been consigned there. I’ve described the flaws of the Anthology project in my\n\n“Reading between the lines: reflections on the massive Anthology of folk music of the Chinese peoples”, Ethnomusicology 47.3 (2003), pp.287–337.\n\nApart from the Anthology‘s valuable Monographs for opera and narrative-singing and brief textual introductions to genres, its volumes consist mainly of transcriptions, of limited value without available recordings. Conceptually its classifications are rudimentary, but it opens up a world of local cultures.\n\nIt’s important to grasp the geography of the large regions covered by such surveys (cf. Layers of fieldwork). At the time of compilation the greater Tianjin municipality comprised four suburban areas (east, west, south, north), five counties (Wuqing, Jinghai, Ninghe, Baodi, * Jixian), and three districts (Tanggu, Hangu, Dagang), all of which had distinctive local traditions.\n\nUseful as always are sketches of some leading groups (pp.1327–39) and brief biographies (pp.1340–56), containing promising leads to further ritual associations and sects.\n\nVolume 1 is entirely devoted to “drumming and blowing” (guchui yue 鼓吹乐). Here the rubric of “Songs-for-winds associations” (chuige hui 吹歌会) is misleading (see under Ritual groups of Xushui), compounded by the sub-categories of leading instrument (guanzi, suona, sheng, dizi). While many musicians are versatile on wind instruments, this masks the important distinction between occupational shawm bands and devotional ritual associations led by guanzi. However, there is some valuable historical information bearing on the “classical” style of amateur ritual groups (often known as “music associations” yinyuehui) serving ritual, such as the Tongshanhui 同善会 of Huanghuadian in Wuqing county (p.1336; brief mention here, under “Further leads”). Such groups were to become my main focus (see under Sects: Hebei, Local ritual, and Gaoluo).\n\nNao and bo cymbals of the Tianxing dharma-drumming association,\n\ninscribed Xuande reign, 5th year (1429). Besides museums,\n\nfolk performing groups preserve important evidence for\n\nthe material culture of imperial China (see China’s hidden century).\n\nShawm bands always occupy a substantial part of the Anthology coverage. Here the summary introduces traditions for all the municipality’s regions, notably in the north around Baodi and Jixian (pp.36–8, 41–2; groups pp.1338–9, biographies p.1343–4, 1355).\n\nThe “great music” of Tianjin.\n\nStill under the heading of “drumming and blowing”, a separate rubric introduces the imposing “great music” (dayue 大乐, though here I seem to recall it should be pronounced daiyue) of the Tianjin region. These shawm bands, derived from the Qing court (cf. longchui and Pingtan paizhi in Fujian), were transmitted among the folk through the Republican era until the 1950s, mainly in urban districts but also in the suburbs; but later they became largely obsolete, so the Anthology fieldwork was largely a “salvage” project.\n\nThe impressive introduction (pp.599–610) refers to documents from the late Qing, including material on the “imperial assembly” (huanghui 皇会), supplementing that of the dharma-drumming associations), and details the use of the genre at weddings and funerals. Besides recordings made for the Anthology in the 1980s, the appetising transcriptions (pp.611–78) utilise early discs that I’m keen to hear—Pathé (Baidai) from 1908 and the 1920s, Shengli 胜利 from the 1930s. Cultural cadres recorded senior artists in the 1950s and even “in the mid-70s”. By the 1980s, surviving musicians were recorded for the Anthology, and took part in the Boxer movie Shenbian 神鞭 (Holy whip, 1986).\n\nShifan band, 1930s.\n\nVolume 2 opens with an introduction to the mixed ensemble shifan 十番 (text pp.679–701, transcriptions pp.702–875; further material on the late Qing societies Siru she 四如社 and Jiya she 集雅社 on pp.1327–8). Related to the better-known genres of south China, notably Jiangnan, shifan bands are also found in a few northern regions including Hebei (see my Folk music of China, pp.206–8). In Tianjin, where shifan was part of the thriving Kunqu scene before Liberation, the major figure in documenting the tradition was Liu Chuqing 刘楚青 (1909–99) (pp.1341–2), who used his youthful immersion in the culture to compile a major volume in 1987.\n\nNotable among percussion ensembles (pp.876–1138) are the dharma-drumming associations (fagu hui 法鼓会), which my mentors at the Music Research Institute (MRI) in Beijing were excited to discover in 1986 and 1987 while attending major folk music festivals in Tianjin. These groups commonly subsumed a shengguan melodic ensemble—from the 1986 festival, listen to the MRI’s audio recording of the Pudong “music and dharma-drumming association” in Nanhe township, Xiqing district 西青南河镇普东音乐法鼓会. These events led us to the fieldwork of local scholars—notably Guo Zhongping 郭忠萍, author of the valuable overview in the Anthology (pp.876–97; transcriptions pp.898–1009; see also groups pp.1328–34 and biographies pp.1347, 1349), based on her more detailed early publication Fagu yishu chutan (1991).\n\nThis section also introduces the percussion of “entertainment associations” (huahui 花会): “flying cymbals” (feicha 飞镲), stilt-walking (gaoqiao 高跷), dragon lanterns (longdeng 龙灯), and flower drum (huagu 花鼓).\n\n“Religious music”\n\nAs always, despite my criticism of the term, this is a substantial category in the Anthology, subsuming some major traditions of Buddhist and Daoist ritual.\n\nJinmen baojia tu shuo (1846).\n\nFor major insiders’ accounts by temple clerics Zhang Xiuhua and Li Ciyou before and after the 1949 “Liberation”, see n.1 here, leading to Appendix 1 of my book In search of the folk Daoists of north China and the research of Vincent Goossaert.\n\nDaoist band, Tianjin. Tell us more…\n\nFor “Buddhist music” (pp.1141–52) and “Daoist music” (pp.1274–9) the introductions can only serve as a starting point for more sophisticated fieldwork—like the transcriptions (pp.1153–1273 and 1280–1326 respectively). There are slim pickings here—although the section on Daoist temple music provides a remarkable vignette from 1972 (!) on a Pingju opera musician’s visit to Zhang Xiupei 张修培, elderly (former?) abbot of the Niangniang gong temple, to notate his singing for the purposes of “new creation”. This section also introduces Li Zhiyuan 李智远 (1894–1987) of the Lüzu tang and Tianhou gong temples; though laicized after “Liberation”, from 1985 he was able to support the renovation of the Lüzu tang. More promising are the rural areas, where there are always household Daoist bands to explore. The transcriptions end with three items of vocal liturgy from the Western suburbs (pp.1313–26): the popular “Twenty-four Pious Ones” (Ershisi xiao 二十四孝), the “Song of the Skeleton” (cf. the Li family band"
