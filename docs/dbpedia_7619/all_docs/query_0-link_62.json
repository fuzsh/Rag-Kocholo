Each of them dedicate themselves, body and soul, to art. To them, Flamenco is a way of life and of expressing their feeling. Passionate about creating a flamenco community, the performers are keen to bring the spirit of Flamenco to every corner of the UK and to share their love for this art. Lourdes Fernández has been dancing since she was five years old. From that moment on, her whole life developed through the learning of Flamenco. She studied dance at the Madrid Conservatory, graduated at Rey Juan Carlos University and completed her Masters in Performing Arts. Lourdes arrived to London in 2012. Since then, she has performed in renowned venues such as Ronnie Scott’s, The Union Chapel, Jazz Cafe, and Richmix. In addition, Lourdes participated in various festivals throughout the UK like the City of London Festival, the Birmingham Jazz Festival, the Brighton Festival, Salisbury festival.
