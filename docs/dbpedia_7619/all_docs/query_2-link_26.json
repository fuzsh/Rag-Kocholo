        "text": "Duende is a term that has arisen in flamenco performance practice to talk about moments of expressive intensity that would otherwise be inarticulable. Since Federica García Lorca’s “Juego y teoría del duende” in 1933, there have been numerous elaborations on and historical excavations of the word in order to determine the contexts and criteria of its usage, as well as its applicability beyond the socio-cultural milieu of flamenco performance. In this essay, I avoid the temptation of offering a strict definition of duende and instead, via the late philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, I conduct a non-normative analysis of its ideological origins and its use history in the Gitano communities of Andalusia, showing that it functions as a situational ineffability – an unspeakable phenomenon that only occurs sometimes and whose criteria may vary. I conclude that duende indexes a radical affirmation of its own presence, and, invoking the diasporic precarity of Gitano cultural memory, I interpret it as a moment of jouissance toward the real, relying on the ideas of Clément Rosset to understand how the flamenco singer can both reproduce his or her history of suffering in a performative instance of bodily or vocal failure and at the same time transmit a kind of contextually coded joy with respect to that same suffering. Finally, I suggest that such an experiential structure might be applicable to ineffable terminology within other musical traditions that have emerged from similar histories of social precarity, even if duende itself ought to remain tethered specifically to flamenco practice.\n\nArte y artistas flamencos (1935) is an indispensable text with reference to the \" Golden Age \" of flamenco and its protagonists, according to the vision of flamenco guitarist and singer Fernando el de Triana (1867–1940). The book bears witness to a moment in which flamenco experienced a genuine morphological revolution, developing positions and applying patrimonial logic, and thus complicating the dichotomies with which flamenco was commonly viewed, as it sought to define itself in light of territorial, artistic, and personal dimensions of meaning. Fernando el de Triana intuited the differences between popular fandango, flamenco fandango, and the then-fashionable fandanguillo; his exposition of these forms distils the influences of early-twentieth-century andalucismo (an Andalusian parochialism and populism). I argue there that conditions under which this book was published explain the oscillations between these popularist positions, and the degree of political accommodation between flamenco and Spanish nationalism, seen as a metonymic extension of \" lo andaluz \" —and foreshadowing the coming propaganda of the Franco regime. Arte y artistas flamencos (1935) es un texto de referencia obligada para conocer la “Edad de Oro” del género flamenco y sus protagonistas, según la visión del guitarrista y cantaor Fernando el de Triana (1867-1940). Testigo de un tiempo en el que el fandango vive unaverdadera revolución morfológica, despliega posiciones y razonamientos patrimonializadores acerca de este estilo que complejizan las dicotomías aplicadas almundo flamenco, al afrontar sus formas territoriales, artísticas y personales. Fernando el de Triana intuye las diferencias entre el flamenco popular, flamenco y el fandanguillo de moda, en cuya exposición se destilan las influencias del andalucismo de las primeras décadas del siglo XX. Sugerimos que las condiciones de edición del libro explican los vaivenes entre estas posiciones popularistas, y cierta asimilación política del flamenco respecto a “lo español-nacional” como generalización metonímica de “lo andaluz”, que anuncian el propagandismo por venir.\n\nTaking into account the re-definition of flamenco performance in the last quarter of the twentieth century, along with the acquisition of new musical elements and meanings, still a continuity of the tradition is found. However, if the development of the modern flamenco way of playing is analysed at the beginning of the twenty-first century, a diversification is also found. Flamenco artists have continued easily crossing their natural and virtual borders and they have made collaborations with other musicians, acquiring other sounds, forms and harmonies. The great amount of new influences and these collaborations with musicians from other cultural contexts would reach this particular genre, but also other genres. Currently, the contemporary flamenco guitar is studied from diverse continents, but principally in one particular Eurocentric direction (Spain-rest of the world). In this paper I propose to analyse some of the popular music influences in contemporary flamenco playing, but also the influence of the late-modern flamenco guitarist in other popular music scenes. These musical exchanges between flamenco, popular music or world popular music (Bossanova, Latin-Jazz, etc.), un-precisely called \"Nuevo Flamenco\", have been principally studied in Flamenco-pop examples and chill out projects, but it is essential to consider the revolution of the new generation of guitar players, who sometimes are excluded because of their new musical idioms. Thanks to new fieldwork carried out in Spain and to the contributions of some flamenco musicians (Gerardo Núñez, Enrique Morente, etc.) I will contrast this particular musical development in flamenco guitar playing synchronically with different discourses of popular music studies and other of the Hispanic world.\n\nMATTHEW MACHIN-AUTENRIETH Abingdon and New York, Routledge, 2017 ix + 186 pp., ISBN13: 978-1-472-48006-4 (£95.00, hardback) A great paradox has long surrounded flamenco: as an artistic expression, it is an exaltation of personality, of the emotional and intimate, and yet it has also been the object of political uses both at the regional and national levels, taken today as the emblem of Andalusian autonomy and the icon of the Marca España [Spanish Brand]. Despite the designation of flamenco as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO (2010), this ideological use has never been universally accepted in other Spanish regions or within Andalusia.

This disparity is visible among flamenco aficionados, performers and while analyzing academic attitudes. The paper explores some of the recurring discrepancies in the scholarly flamenco disputes. It dwells on the role of the discussed genre in ethnic debates and its place in Spanish culture. The article also looks at the antagonism between traditional and contemporary or “pure” and commercial display of flamenco. These discussions are part of – as a dance scholar Michelle Heffner Hayes (2009: 4) phrases it – “conflicting narratives of flamenco’s history” and contribute to a complex and multifaceted image of this art form."
