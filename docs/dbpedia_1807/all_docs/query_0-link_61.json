        "text": "Sound Bite: Humberto Leon of Opening Ceremony\n\nCarol Lim and Humberto Leon of Opening Ceremony first made names for themselves as harbingers of cool with their concept store. On Tuesday night, the duo held a dinner with Samsung at the L'Atelier des Artistes, and reinforced those credentials by flying over the rising star Angela Dimayuga, executive chef of Mission Chinese, to cook for a small group of fashion insiders.\n\n\"When we throw a party, we want it to feel real and authentic,\" said Mr. Leon, who, alongside Ms. Kim, unveiled their spring collection for Kenzo on Sunday. \"We want people to eat and dance the way we like to eat and dance, and that's why we brought her over here to Paris.\"\n\n\"Angela is our friend and we are obsessed with her cooking, so it was the perfect choice. We wanted tonight to feel true to our brand wherever we are in the world.\"\n\nGuests sampled intriguing dishes ranging from tingling cucumbers and lotus root, Chongqing chicken wings with explosively spicy chili, and rice porridge with raw egg yolk and beef tartare. Later the party moved downstairs to a subterranean club -- with a bathtub in the middle of the floor -- where James Blake played a set.\n\nParis\n\nSound Bites\n\nFirst Look: Miu Miu\n\nAnd so to the last show of the season, at the Palais d'Iéna, for Miu Miu, where models came down a giant sweeping staircase before weaving in and out of vast gold and silver curves and arches on the runway.\n\nThe first look was pure Miu Miu: a boxy oversize jacket in an eye-popping geometric print, pigtails and sky-high platforms with glitter heels. Later came layering: sheer pink frilled petticoats over tailored shirts and slacks, patterned leather jackets with clashing pencil skirts and a consistent playful touch throughout. Fox and raccoon tails waggled as models walked.\n\nFirst Look\n\nParis\n\nMoncler\n\nAt Moncler finale, two rows of fencers stood at attention. ‘But why didn’t they fence?’ asked one puzzled attendee stuartemmrichny\n\nParis\n\nEye Candy: Moncler\n\nEye Candy\n\nParis\n\nThe Scene at Louis Vuitton\n\nEye Candy\n\nParis\n\nFace in the Crowd: Alicia Vikander at Louis Vuitton\n\nThe Louis Vuitton show took place on the season's last day in the shadow of its parent company's gargantuan new art museum, the Louis Vuitton Foundation, on the outskirts of Paris. Across the catwalk from the Arnault family of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and sitting between Anna Wintour and Miranda Kerr was the Swedish actress Alicia Vikander.\n\n\"I feel very Parisian chic,\" said Ms. Vikander, the star of the fall 2015 Louis Vuitton campaign (who was dressed in Nicolas Ghesquière's styles, from head to toe).\n\nWhat is your earliest memory of Louis Vuitton?\n\nI was actually very young and remember it so vividly. I had practice at ballet school and had forgotten my rucksack, and so my friend's grandmother lent me her old Louis Vuitton handbag. I remember being quite nervous to use it! I knew that I had something quite precious in my hands.\n\nHow has your perception of it changed, now that you have started working for the brand?\n\nI have a greater depth of understanding of fashion as an art form, I think. I see Nicolas as an artist who is really pushing the boundaries of his discipline. As an individual, he's incredibly inspirational, as is what he's doing in carving out the future of this brand.\n\nWhat are you doing after the show?\n\nFirst, I have a photo shoot. But then I'm going to spend a few hours in Paris with my friend Lisa who came with me on this trip. I want to head over to Montmartre and just wander around. It's a real bohemian melting pot of art galleries and sex shops and cafes and boutiques and one of my favorite parts of the city.\n\nAnd then?\n\nIt's straight back to London!\n\nWhat are you doing in London?\n\nWell, I'm starting shooting on my latest movie, which is the latest Bourne movie with Matt Damon. It's incredibly exciting, and I can't wait. Then I have a lot of promotion to do for \"The Danish Girl,\" and I've got two more movies that will be released soon after that, so it's a constant whirlwind of work and travel for me right now. But it's wonderful! I'm having fun.\n\nCelebrities\n\nParis\n\nFirst Look: Louis Vuitton\n\nIt was only a coincidence — wasn't it? — that Kering announced early on Wednesday that it had hired Demna Gvasalia as the new designer for Balenciaga, just hours before its great rival, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, staged Nicolas Ghesquière's latest collection for Louis Vuitton?\n\nBut of course it was.\n\nStill, the surprise announcement (at least for those who hadn't checked their Twitter feeds overnight) dominated the front row buzz at the Vuitton show, which drew, among others, Alicia Vikander, Catherine Deneuve and Michelle Williams.\n\nThen this opening look came out on the runway and the conversation turned, briefly, back to fashion.\n\nFirst Look\n\nParis\n\nEye Candy: Louis Vuitton\n\nEye Candy\n\nParis\n\nDemna Gvasalia Named Balenciaga’s New Artistic Director\n\nBalenciaga has a gritty new look. On Wednesday, the final day of Paris Fashion Week, the French luxury group Kering announced it had appointed Demna Gvasalia, head designer of the underground cult collective Vetements, as artistic director of the former couture house.\n\nMr. Gvasalia, a 34-year-old Georgian, becomes the third creative director of Balenciaga in the last four years. His appointment comes at a crucial time for the brand, which is included in Kering’s smaller luxury brands group, along with names such as Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen, but which has an outsize fashion presence, thanks to its name and history.\n\nHighlights\n\nParis\n\nDemna Gvasalia to Balenciaga: The Front Row Reaction\n\nPresumably much to the chagrin of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the front row at the Louis Vuitton show on Wednesday was abuzz with news of Kering's appointment of Demna Gvasalia to the helm of Balenciaga.\n\nSeveral of the industry's biggest players shared their reaction:\n\nAnna Wintour, editor in chief, American Vogue: \"I think François-Henri Pinault had shown on several occasions that he is able to make brave choices when appointing designers. Look at Alessandro Michele at Gucci and the disruptive and exciting influence he has had there. There is a need in fashion to take a new direction in a modern way, and Demna has shown himself to be more than capable of that. Things move so fast in today's industry. The position needed to be filled by someone with a strong aesthetic and real point of view. He's very talented and the flavor of the moment, so in my view a wonderful choice.\"\n\nVirginie Mouzat, editor in chief of fashion, French Vanity Fair: \"I only have one thing to say: This is a healthy move, and it will shake up the system. I cannot say which way things will go or how the appointment will play out. But it brings new blood to the sector, and we badly need that.\"\n\nEva Chen, head of fashion partnerships, Instagram: \"I got a breaking news alert in the night about the appointment, and it immediately woke me up — and I think more broadly that's what the appointment of Demna may do to the sector. Balenciaga has always chosen creative directors who like to shock and are cutting edge. But what is particularly exciting about this is the power of social media platforms like Instagram. Demna cast models for his show from Instagram, and his work is rooted in street style, which has exploded as a force in fashion from the platform. There is a new kind of democracy emerging in the fashion world, when a designer like him can take the top job of one of the most prestigious brands in the sector.\"\n\nHighlights\n\nParis\n\nThe Final Day of Paris Fashion Week (Day 9)\n\nAfter hundreds of shows in four cities across two continents, the spring 2016 season has come to an end.\n\nOn Wednesday, the final day of Paris Fashion Week, the morning brings Louis Vuitton, where the stars are expected to turn out to admire the latest designs from Nicolas Ghesquière. Rumors, now at deafening levels, are that the new Balenciaga appointment may be announced to, ahem, coincide with the show. Stay tuned for the latest.\n\nThen, at midday, expect the usual extravaganza from Moncler Gamme Rouge at the Grand Palais, before things wrap up at 2 p.m. with Miuccia Prada’s Miu Miu show.\n\nAfter that, the style set (at least the ones who just cover women's wear) will head home until February, when it all begins again.\n\nParis\n\nPartying With Valentino\n\nTuesday was the 27th consecutive day of the fashion season, meaning (by my wildly unscientific guess) that there have been around 54 fashion parties since then, from late-night raves in downtown Manhattan lofts to elegant dinners in upscale Milanese restaurants to boisterous gatherings in seedy watering holes in the Marais neighborhood of Paris. One would think the fashion crowd would have had enough by now.\n\nNo way.\n\nOn Tuesday, a throng descended upon the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild, in the Eighth Arrondissement, for an African-themed party hosted by Valentino just hours after its warmly received show in the Tuileries.\n\nAll the regulars were there: Anna Dello Russo, the editor at large for Vogue Japan, hanging out with pals in a cozy alcove; Alber Elbaz of Lanvin, taking refuge from the crowds and the heat on a tiny balcony off the D.J. station; Suzy Menkes, the Vogue international editor, happily posing for selfies with fans; the all-grown-up \"Mad Men\" actress Kiernan Shipka, who had been at the show earlier that day (\"Beautiful\"); the Valentino co-designer Pierpaolo Piccioli, skittering among the crowd to make sure everyone was having a good time; and Valentino Garavani himself, holding court on a couch, surrounded by his usual complement of handsome young men and lovely young women.\n\nIt was a fun party, one that seemed likely to go late into the night. But some people were clearly beginning to feel the effects of the fashion marathon. \"All things considered,\" said one editor, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid antagonizing the Valentino brand, a major advertiser, \"I'd rather be back in my hotel room with a cup of tea, watching CNN.\"\n\nHighlights\n\nParis\n\nFace in the Crowd: Maria Sharapova at Valentino\n\nThe crowd at Valentino was excitable on Tuesday afternoon as Paris Fashion Week -- and the spring 2016 season -- hit the home stretch. Seated a few spots down from Valentino on the front row was the tennis star Maria Sharapova, who took five minutes to talk to Styles before the show began.\n\nWhat brings you to Paris?\n\nI was in Germany and realized there was a two-day window in my schedule. I've never been to Paris Fashion Week before -- so here I am!\n\nAnd what shows have you seen so far?\n\nI was at Stella McCartney yesterday, then Chanel earlier this morning. This will be my last show.\n\nDoes attending these sorts of shows affect your decisions on what you wear, either on or off the court?\n\nOf course! That said, my state of mind varies quite drastically depending on where I am and what I'm doing. When I'm playing, I always go for clean lines and distinctive silhouettes. But in my day-to-day life I'm always on the road, so my lifestyle governs my wardrobe: Think soft, simple separates that are easily layered and pack easily.\n\nWhat else do you like to do in Paris when you visit?\n\nI eat, of course, as so many visitors do. But actually, I don't often go to French places. There's a small family-run Italian restaurant with just 10 tables that I love, called La Corte. And a Japanese joint called Tamara, where the quality of the sushi is out of this world.\n\nAnd what's next for you after the show?\n\nA trip to the airport then back to the U.S. I have one last tournament to play in Singapore in a few weeks' time, so I need to get back and keep training.\n\nCelebrities\n\nParis\n\nValentino\n\nAfter a few quiet, dark outfits, Valentino finally let some color pop out. The rest of the show was high romance stuartemmrichny\n\nParis\n\nThe Daily Shoe: Juan Carlos Obando\n\nJuan Carlos Obando outfitted models in dramatic sandals that felt part ballerina, part flamenco dancer. One can wrap the pom-pomed ties around a bare leg, or — as Obando did in his show — style them over a jumpsuit.\n\nSee more daily shoes” in T Magazine\n\nParis\n\nSix Things to Know About the Iris Van Herpen Show\n\nIt was inspired by the living tree bridges in India.\n\nThe centerpiece was a trio of machines from an Austrian robotics brand covered in a spiky gray-black latex-like material that resembled a volcanic lunar landscape but had been magnetically “grown” by the Dutch artist Jolan van der Wiel and then sewn into socklike garments by Ms. Van Herpen’s studio.\n\nDuring the show, the robots 3D-printed woven root-like lacings around the actress Gwendoline Christie, who plays Brienne of Tarth in \"Game of Thrones\" and who was lying silently on a plinth-like structure in their midst.\n\nMs. Christie met Ms Van Herpen in Amsterdam in April of this year after discovering her work on the Internet, and they hatched the plan. She said she was interested in the way Ms. Van Herpen “explores ideas of design that go beyond clothing to what makes up our human structure,” and had always thought it was only a matter of time before Ms. Van Herpen made something that actually was alive. In the interim, however, she liked the idea that she could help the work come alive -- though she also said it was weird when she was lying there and “halfway through the show, I realized I couldn’t get up and leave even if I wanted to.”\n\nThe connection between the clothes and the performance was the idea of root systems, as expressed sartorially in a variety of lace — flesh-toned classic lace from Calais, laser-cut silvery futuristic “lace,” and laser-cut leathery lace — used in simple shirtdresses, long mesh skirts under white organza shirts, and a slinky black evening dress that looked like nothing so much as a futuristic snakeskin.\n\nThough this was the first time Ms. Christie had worn a dress by Ms. Van Herpen (white, halter-neck, covered in synthetic silver lace mesh), they were engaged in “plotting” more clothes for her future. Ms. Christie will next be seen as a Storm Trooper in \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\" so she was asked whether this meant clothes for public appearances, or professional gigs? She looked momentarily very excited. “For public appearance, I guess,” she said. “But the other possibility is even better!”\n\nParis\n\nEye Candy: Iris Van Herpen\n\nEye Candy\n\nParis\n\nEye Candy: Vanessa Seward\n\nVanessa Seward's spring/summer 2016 collection featured metallic brocades, patterned headscarves and an all-white suit — which gave the collection a distinctly disco-glamour vibe.\n\nSee more scenes from the show in T Magazine\n\nEye Candy\n\nParis\n\nThree’s A Trend: Wide-Legged Jeans\n\nIf runways are the barometer of next season’s denim styles, the spring/summer 2016 shows have been loud and clear: baggy, wide-legged jeans are back.

But around 10:25, five minutes before the scheduled start of the Chanel show, the sun suddenly came out from behind the clouds, bathing the Grand Palais in a golden light.\n\nIt was perhaps a fitting tribute to Karl Lagerfeld, the master showman of Paris Fashion Week, who had transformed the main gallery of the Grand Palais into an airport waiting lounge (serving \"Chanel Airlines\") for the presentation of his spring 2016 collection.\n\nHe did so for a crowd that included dozens of Chanel ladies in their Chanel finery; a Chinese actress who strolled around the set pushing an empty luggage trolley (trailed the entire time by a posse of Chinese paparazzi); and the tennis star Maria Sharapova, recovering from a recent spate of injuries and sitting in the front row next to Anna Wintour. How was she feeling? \"I'm getting better,\" she said, \"but it gives me a chance to enjoy myself and come see these clothes, which I love.\"\n\nThe show opened with this global traveler, rolling suitcase at the ready, in a multicolored pantsuit. The rest of the show featured poppy colors, mixes of prints and textures, and just the right amount of bling to keep those Chanel ladies happy.\n\nAt the finale, Mr. Lagerfeld took a slow, triumphant walk through the audience, stopping to pick up a scarf that had been dropped on the runway by one of the models and had sat there forlornly for most of the show. He did so with a sly smile and a slight shrug, as if to say, \"Well, someone had to do it.\"\n\nWhen the show ended, the crowd streamed out of the Grand Palais to find that the sun had disappeared once again, slipping behind a dark gray cloud.\n\nMore rain is forecast for the afternoon.\n\nFirst Look\n\nParis\n\nWhat They’re Wearing: At Chanel\n\nEach season, Chanel invites its most valued clients to Paris Fashion Week to view its latest ready-to-wear collection. They come in the hundreds and from all over the world for the biannual spectacles, wearing their latest purchases — and ready to look at some new ones.\n\nWe spoke to three women before they took their seats in the Chanel Airlines terminal on Tuesday:\n\nKate Kokoreva \"I am Russian, but I bought my outfit in Monaco before Fashion Month began. I am a TV presenter and have no time to shop on the road when I'm working. But a Chanel outfit takes me anywhere I need to go. An outfit like this is everything a woman needs. It's timeless but sexy, not at all vulgar and very, very chic. I am a devoted fan.\"\n\nThássia Naves \"I come over from Brazil, and each time I do I think Karl Lagerfeld blows my mind. He is such a genius! Look at this place. Although I love everything he does, I tend to buy mainly black pieces. It works in all seasons and all climates and makes me look elegant wherever I go. That's incredibly important to me. But being cool matters, too. That's why I bought the backpack.\"\n\nKristina Magakelyan \"I've come in from Moscow with my mother for the show because Chanel is my favorite brand. I've been four or five times before and am obsessed with Paris Fashion Week. I love the fact I can sit with celebrities and have discussions with some of the most important people in this industry. I bought this outfit a few weeks ago in Cannes; pearls are so pretty. But my favorite part is probably the sunglasses. I have so many pairs back at home.\"\n\nParis\n\nhttps://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/06/fashion/07chanel-slide-2347/07chanel-slide-2347-facebookJumbo.jpg\n\nThe Scene: Chanel Airlines\n\nBoarding for the penultimate day of Paris Fashion Week began bright and early on Tuesday at the Grand Palais, which had been transformed into a life-size Chanel Airlines terminal.\n\nGuests handed over retro-style plane tickets before passing through security and into a dazzling all-white departure lounge, complete with roaming pilots, branded luggage trolleys and check-in desks.\n\nOf course there were celebrities galore, with Cara Delevingne at the eye of the paparazzi storm. And at Chanel, the fashion show is as much on the front row as it is on the catwalk. Hundreds of the world's wealthiest women, dressed head to toe in Chanel, chattered excitedly and tottered around, taking pictures with their iPhones.\n\n\"I came here early specifically to people watch — it's just bananas in here,\" said the stylist Katie Grand, who was perched on a metal chair in the center of the terminal.\n\n\"And it feels very real,\" she continued. \"Often, when I travel, this is exactly what I see wherever I am in the world. Chanel-clad women on their phones and running to find their gate.\"\n\nThe architect Peter Marino, wearing his usual uniform of leather and bare flesh, found the fact that art was imitating life a little too close for comfort. \"This is just like a real trip to the airport,\" he exclaimed on his third circuit around the central check-in desks. \"This place is so big I can't find where I'm meant to be going!\"\n\nBut for Anna Dello Russo, the Japan Vogue editor-at-large, who was swamped by women of all ages asking for a selfie, she said it was just like real air travel: One had to go with the flow.\n\n\"I've seen at least 10 women here wearing the same outfit as me this morning — that doesn't happen very often, I assure you,\" she said, testing out a Chanel roller suitcase as the crowd dispersed, ready for take off.\n\n\"But I don't mind,\" she said. \"This is like a Lunar Park, a make-believe playground where grown-ups can pretend. Look how much fun everyone is having. This is, for me, what fashion is all about.\"\n\nParis\n\nEye Candy: Chanel\n\nEye Candy\n\nParis\n\nChanel’s Version of the Birkenstock\n\nWear the runway on your feet: Light-up Birkenstocks at @Chanel #PFW vvfriedman\n\nParis\n\nFashion Review: Chanel and Saint Laurent\n\nOn the penultimate day of Paris Fashion Week, Karl Lagerfeld built an airplane terminal in the Grand Palais, complete with boarding Gate No. 5, departure screens (to Shanghai, New York, Moscow and Rome), metal waiting-room seats, and male flight attendants, the better to frame his flight plan for Chanel.

The retro airline ticket invitations suggest a Chanel Airlines-themed event, a favorite of Karl Lagerfeld, who has turned to it several times before. Two hours later, Vanessa Seward, a staple for chic Parisian women, shows off her latest collection, before an en masse turnout for Valentino in the Jardin des Tuileries.\n\nIris van Herpen rounds off the official schedule at 4:30, but there will be parties after hours: Opening Ceremony, Roger Vivier and Valentino are having them, as is Elle magazine, which is hosting one at the United States Embassy.\n\nParis\n\nSound Bite: Thomas Brodie-Sangster at Saint Laurent\n\nAt the Saint Laurent show on Monday night, there was a rare sight: a celebrity who was not just on time, but 15 minutes early.\n\n\"I’ve never been to anything like this before,\" said Thomas Brodie-Sangster, the dashing young British actor and breakout star of the \"Maze Runner\" movies, sitting in a near-empty front row on the near-pitch-black set.\n\n\"We had the premiere for the latest 'Maze Runner' film, 'The Scorch Trials,' in Paris last week, and Saint Laurent sent me a suit with an invite to come along,\" he said. \"And I thought why not, and headed over on my own. It’s not a scene I’ve ever seen before.

And the front row was lit up by photographers' flashes for Catherine Deneuve, Terry Richardson and Lily Donaldson, not to mention a small army of Mr. Slimane's cool-kid friends who had come in from London, New York and Los Angeles.\n\nAnd then there were the clothes. First came a midnight-black metallic gown, all acres of bare flesh and a center split. Next, dazzling little metallic shifts and sheer barely-there gowns, most of them worn with Wellington boots, plastic tiaras and biker jackets or furs, and the occasional touch of razor-sharp suiting upon which this designer made his name.\n\nThe catwalk suggested that, after Chloé earlier this week, Mr. Slimane is yet another designer inspired by nostalgia for the grungy glamour of British festival style.\n\nFirst Look\n\nParis\n\nEye Candy: Saint Laurent\n\nEye Candy\n\nParis\n\nSaint Laurent’s Front Row\n\nBtw, this is is the real front row @YSL - Hedi Slimane's cool kid pals who all pile in on the floor #PFW lizziepaton\n\nHighlights\n\nParis\n\nRock Royalty at Saint Laurent\n\nRock royalty at @YSL #PFW pic.twitter.com/LT4uC3dWCG vvfriedman\n\nParis\n\nSound Bite: Janelle Monáe\n\nOne face appearing again and again at Paris Fashion Week belongs to Janelle Monáe. Ungaro, Akris, Stella McCartney, Sonia Rykiel -- the singer and producer has become a front row stalwart. But what was she doing in Paris in the first place?\n\n\"I'm here for the art, and by that I mean fashion by the way, which is one of the greatest art forms there is,\" she said, tossing one giant braid over her shoulder. \"As an artist myself, I think it's important to appreciate different disciplines and cultures. That's also why I am here: to talk to locals, learn about their lives and what is inspiring them over here. Not that I speak much French.\"\n\nWhich of the collections so far had excited her the most?\n\n\"Probably Stella McCartney: That show just blew me away,\" she said in the Sonia Rykiel flagship store, just before that show began. \"But the clothes coming out of Sonia Rykiel at the moment are amazing, too. This fur, these thigh-high suede boots. I'm such a fan, hence I'm wearing it from head to toe.\"\n\nSound Bites\n\nFirst Look: Hermès\n\nNadège Vanhee-Cybulski opened her second collection for Hermès with this coolly elegant number, in front a slightly bedraggled and damp crowd of fashionistas, many caught off guard by the arrival of an unexpected rainstorm in Paris this afternoon.\n\nThe midnight blue color palette was carried out with the next few dresses, before switching to variations of black and white, royal blue and, later in the show, bright orange accented with matching sneakers.\n\nIn the front row was Kris Jenner, with boyfriend Corey Gamble.

In between interruptions from adoring fans of all ages, Ms. Radziwill took Styles through her wardrobe choice for the sixth day of Paris Fashion Week.\n\nHAIR Have a style and own it. Who has time to think about these things endlessly? I've been wearing my hair in a chignon like this for years.\n\nJACKET This is Moncler. I bought it in their Paris store just last week.

The pattern is complex but monochrome, which means it goes with anything.\n\nTROUSERS So many of these women are probably absolutely frozen. I'm a firm believer in not always being a slave to trends and wearing what makes one happy. And on a day like today, it's a pair of simple black slacks by Armani. I have hundreds of pairs.\n\nEARRINGS I wish I could give you a story, but there isn't one. They are ancient. I've had them for so long I can't remember where they come from.

Less discussed, but equally startling when you look at the numbers, is how few women are designers at the head of major fashion brands (or even minor ones). Of the 91 shows on the official Paris schedule, fewer than 20 percent are brands with female creative directors (or their titular ilk). Where are the women?\n\nRead more on Vanessa Friedman's fashion review of Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen, Sacai, Akris and Giambattista Valli.\n\nParis\n\nReviews\n\nFirst Look: Sacai\n\nThe first look of the Sacai spring collection from Chitose Abe was a printed halter shift of filmy kaleidoscopic ribbons, latticed together into a voluminous silhouette.\n\nPrints then continued to come in every which way: roomy bandanna-inspired two pieces in navy and white, all gauzy sleeves and asymmetric points; gilded floral car coats and starched skirts and dresses; and filmy rainbow stripes, with black brocade finish.\n\nFirst Look\n\nParis\n\nEye Candy: Sacai\n\nEye Candy\n\nSound Bite: Salma Hayek at Stella McCartney\n\nIn pride of place at the Stella McCartney show Monday morning, nestled between the photographer Mario Testino and her husband, the Kering chief executive François-Henri Pinault, sat a beaming Salma Hayek.\n\nThe Mexican actress, who took selfies galore with the two men before the chandeliers dimmed at the Palais Garnier in Paris, was full of praise at the finale.\n\n\"Stella shows that sustainability can be beautiful and fun, and that's very powerful. I just love her — and my god, did I love those shoes!\" Ms. Hayek said, coughing occasionally behind dark glasses and a mass of raven hair. She explained that she was fending off a cold.\n\n\"I also think that the models at Stella are stunning. She manages to get all the prettiest girls of the season in one room to walk at her show.\"\n\nAfter stopping to kiss Carine Roitfeld — and to tell the French fashion editor that she followed her on Instagram — Ms. Hayek explained the secret of an enduring friendship with Ms. McCartney: \"You know, I think we get on incredibly well because we are both Virgos. We are perfectionists.\"\n\n\"We can go for drinks together and work out, but to me she's also an inspiration,\" she said. \"She's a mother and an artist and a businesswoman and a friend and a role model. I think you should always have friends who inspire you. And to me, she is one of a kind.\"\n\nParis\n\nSound Bites\n\nFirst Look: Stella McCartney\n\nTwo-thirds of the \"FourFiveSeconds\" collaborators — Rihanna and Kanye West — ruled Paris on Saturday night with their Instagram-breaking appearances at the French Vogue party. So one might have expected that Paul McCartney would have made it a trifecta on Monday morning.\n\nBut to the disappointment of the paparazzi, Sir Paul was nowhere to be seen in the front row at the ornate Palais Garnier as his daughter, the designer Stella McCartney, showed her spring 2016 collection, starting off with this form-fitting dress in a tartan-like red-and-white plaid, followed by several variations in different colors.\n\nAll the models wore these vaguely Japanese-influenced platform shoes, which, during the finale, resounded through the halls of the ornate opera house like horses' hooves heading down the stretch.\n\nFirst Look\n\nParis\n\nParis Fashion Week: Day 7\n\nFor the style set, after three and a half weeks on the road, Monday of Paris Fashion Week is often the moment when they realize that the end of the season is drawing near. But before the last blast, several big brands will roll out onto the catwalks.\n\nStella McCartney, who sent out enormous gold knuckle-dusters spelling out her name as invitations for her spring collection, begins the day at 10 a.m. An hour later, it is over to Sacai, the Japanese brand that has developed a near-maniacal following thanks to the sartorial savvy of its creative director (and Comme des Garçons alumna) Chitose Abe.\n\nAfter Leonard Paris at midday comes Giambattista Valli, before an afternoon at leisure, often leading to a frenzied dash by frazzled editors around the boutiques and art galleries of the Left Bank.\n\nAll of a sudden, it's early evening. Trot over to the Hermès show being held in Le Garde Républicaine. Sonia Rykiel will hold an intimate show in St.-Germain for a chosen few, after which some will head to Esteban Cortázar.\n\nBut at 8, anyone who could get their hands on a ticket heads to see the latest offerings from Hedi Slimane at Saint Laurent. Front-row whispers about an announcement of an appointment at Balenciaga, the Saint Laurent stablemate, will no doubt be reaching a crescendo.\n\nParis\n\nAlexander McQueen\n\nThe barren heaths are a landscape where Sarah Burton seems to thrive. Her collections for Alexander McQueen often seem pulled from the wild, a prairie chic that ultimately explodes into full-on glamour.\n\nSo it went with tonight's McQueen collection. It began simply, almost humbly, with plain, linen-colored dresses, crinkled and creased as if by hard use. By the end, there were gowns sparkling and sweeping over the stage, feathered and fringed.

Party, of course.\n\nAt least that’s what French Vogue did to celebrate its 95th anniversary on Saturday night as seemingly all of fashion descended on a private mansion just south of the Arc de Triomphe.\n\n“Drinks!” bellowed Kanye West when asked what he was looking forward to most. The rapper and designer, who attended several Paris shows last week, had completely ignored the black-tie dress code and arrived with his mother-in-law, Kris Jenner.\n\n“Drinks, drinks and more drinks,” he said. “That’s what I’m feeling tonight.

The finale was a full lineup of the Galaxy in every possible shade, amid whoops and cheers from the audience.\n\nParis\n\nFashion Review: Magical Thinking at Céline and Comme des Garçons\n\nDiscordant juxtapositions are part of the human condition. They just get a little more exaggerated when Fashion Week comes into play. Largely because fashion tends to play with them. The theory being, I suppose, if you can’t beat ’em, design ’em. It works, at least part of the time.\n\nSo at Céline, on a sand floor framed by a billowing ceiling of blue and yellow and orange nylon sails, like so many castaway remnants, the designer Phoebe Philo explored the elements of the urban uniform.\n\nThere were black and white lingerie slips and camisoles balanced by tailored pants and jackets, corset-waisted tweed coats and pleated Martha Graham dance dresses with mid-calf skirts, their open backs closed by ribbon ties streaming from the neck.\n\n“I’ve been longing to be more and more in nature, to get away from the city and put my toes in the sand,” Ms. Philo said backstage after the show, and the tension between the two worlds, familiar to most women, was made manifest in her clothes.\n\nRead more.\n\nParis\n\nReviews\n\nSound Bite: Jürgen Teller at Céline\n\nSitting on the Céline front row, dressed in shorts (as usual) and brandishing a Dunlop tennis racquet (slightly more unusual) was Jürgen Teller.\n\n\"The show is at a tennis club and there are lots of courts available, so I always make them book me a slot for a couple of hours before the show starts,\" said the German artist and photographer, who regularly shoots for the brand. \"It's a good way of making the most of our trip here.\"\n\nParis\n\nSound Bites\n\nFirst Look: Céline\n\nThe Céline show started almost without warning on Sunday afternoon. People were still settling in their seats, swapping anecdotes about the Paris Vogue party the night before (Kanye! Rihanna! Gigi!), speculating about a successor to Alex Wang at Balenciaga or grumbling about the traffic jams earlier in central Paris because of a road race, when suddenly the first model popped out.\n\nShe was wearing a sheer, deep-cut lacy dress in black and white, a color theme carried out through most of the first half of the show, before switching to some form-fitting coats in moss green and several plaid-on-plaid numbers.\n\nIt was all displayed in front of an enthusiastic crowd that included the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton brass and the photographer Jürgen Teller, manspreading in the front row in T-shirt and gym shorts.\n\nFirst Look\n\nParis\n\nThe Daily Bag: Céline\n\nAt Céline today, Phoebe Philo showed shoulder purses and clutches as poofy as pillows — but a series of structured, perfectly sized handle bags in black and this milky white shade stole the show.\n\nSee more bags from the runways in T Magazine\n\nParis\n\nCéline Set\n\nMulti-colored nylon environment at @Celine, by the Danish artist Fos.

Their sandals may have been lined with rubber-beaded massaging footbeds of the sort you'd find in Adidas slides, but that was no reason to walk more than one had to. When the moving platforms came to a stop, the models descended to the runway.\n\nCarol Lim and Humberto Leon, the designers, were after a \"cacophonous mélange,\" as the first look demonstrated: a midriff-baring top and skirt in a piecemeal patchwork of color, pattern and print.\n\nFirst Look\n\nParis\n\nParis Fashion Week: Day 6\n\nThe forecast is bright and cool; a major race, the annual 10K Paris Center, has tied up the city center, but the fashion industry has bigger fish to fry.

The action starts — at the very edge of town, naturally — with Kenzo at 10:30 a.m.\n\nHike back from those far reaches for Emanuel Ungaro at 11:30, but be prepared for a day of travel: No sooner have you gotten back to the center than it's out to the Tennis Club de Paris for Céline at 1 p.m.\n\nRabih Kayrouz, the Lebanese designer, Roland Mouret and John Galliano keep things moving in the afternoon. Akris, the quiet Swiss label, takes the Grand Palais at 6 p.m. Take that time to meditate and recoup. If history is any guide, there won't be anything quiet about Alexander McQueen, which ends the day with a show at a lycée in the 17th Arrondissement at 8 p.m.\n\nParis\n\nThe Daily Jewel: Nina Ricci\n\nSlim, refined necklaces added a subtle sparkle to the collars of shift dresses and diaphanous tops at Nina Ricci.\n\nSee more jewels from the runways in T Magazine\n\nParis\n\nFirst Look: Nina Ricci\n\nA dress?

But ushers directed guests down, down past the glass-floored lobby, past another level and down to a basement room with a stucco ceiling, exposed heating pipes and a temperature hovering at the tropical end of the double digits. Here was where Rei Kawakubo, fashion's sphinx, staged her Comme des Garçons show. Where else?\n\nFor any other designer, the small crowd would have revolted and left. But such is the power of Rei: They squeezed and schvitzed and sat. The show rewarded their forbearance. It was Ms. Kawakubo at her poetic, expansive best (often literally, as models had to do-si-do to fit around one another going and coming on the narrow runway).\n\nWhat began as black and red erupted, eventually, into a feathered, fuzzy, velvety riot of blue. \"Blue Velvet\" was the apex of the soundtrack, or it was until the ovation, long and loud at the end.

Amid puffs of smoke and operatic arias, an army emerged in similar attire — all edgy leathers and deconstructed jackets, with flashes of color and hints of skin.\n\n\"I like to talk about being in a gang, feeling like part of a nation and a family,\" Mr. Ackermann said after the show. Judging by a front row dressed from head to toe in his designs, he found kindred spirits in his audience, too.\n\nFirst Look\n\nParis\n\nThe Daily Beauty: Haider Ackermann\n\nFor Haider Ackermann’s punk-inspired girl gang this morning in Paris, hair stylist Kamo certainly didn’t hold back. After weaving and plaiting fluorescent hairpieces into the models’ hair, he worked it into messy rainbow-colored quiffs with braids trailing down the back. “We wanted to work with color,” Kamo said before the show. “The clothes are really colorful, and there will be smoke machines and colored lights, so it’s a whole look.” Each ’do was finished off with a silk net attached to the hair with safety pins — a DIY punk touch if ever there was one — which covered the face like a spider’s web.\n\nThe somewhat outré theme continued with the make-up, as make-up artist Lynsey Alexander set out to create a kind of “otherworldly beauty” look. “It’s not classic spring/summer,” she admitted. “We’ve actually lightened the skin using MAC’s Strobe Cream, which gives this luminosity and lift from within.” MAC’s creamy Paint Pot in the shade of Groundwork — a warm, taupe color — was used to sculpt the eyes, cheeks and lips, while a white pencil was applied along the inner rim of the eye — “to create a spooky look.” A final touch of gloss to the eyebrows and cheekbones worked as a highlighter, and added a wet, dewy overlay to the otherwise matte base. “Because there was so much going on with the hair and so much color, we had to strip back the face a little,” said Alexander of the neutral tones.\n\nSee more backstage beauty reports in T Magazine\n\nBeauty\n\nParis\n\nEye Candy: Haider Ackermann\n\nEye Candy\n\nParis\n\nJunya Watanabe’s Experiments\n\nAs a designer, Junya Watanabe is at least half sculptor. His honeycomb-like pieces are installed like artwork in a window of Colette this week, and at his show this morning several attendees were wearing them (or poking out of them, it might be fairer to say).\n\nThis season, he kept up his experiments in the form. \"This season Junya Watanabe simply wanted to create accessories,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\nHis blousy shirts and billowing twisted one-piece rompers were kitted out with aluminum rings or spiraling helices of faux patent leather. They were crowned by undulating headpieces, inspired by ripples in water, in towering paper and vinyl by Mr. Watanabe's hair artist, Tomihiro Kono — apparently without any direction from Mr. Watanabe.\n\nHighlights\n\nParis\n\nParis Fashion Week: Day 5\n\nRise and shine, fashion week: The day begins with Junya Watanabe, who shows (mercifully, with coffee) at 9:30. The downside: He'll show this season at Palais de la Porte Dorée, about as far out as you can go without leaving Paris proper. The upside: It's Saturday morning. Traffic won't be bad.\n\nFrom there, the day trundles on, to Haider Ackermann at 10:30 (back in central Paris) for waifs in silks, then on to Mugler in the early afternoon. There may even be time for a quick lunch before Acne Studios picks up the thread at 2.\n\nTwo of fashion's most iconoclastic designers, Vivienne Westwood and Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons, show back to back in the late afternoon — luckily closer to one another than in the past. Then it's onward to Nina Ricci, where the recently appointed designer Guillaume Henry is continuing to reshape the label. (You may have seen his Ricci if you happened to walk by the front windows of the concept shop Colette this week.)\n\nConserve your energy throughout the day: tonight Vogue Paris celebrates its 95th anniversary, and the invitation makes its intentions clear.

But it’s always a delight to see an American succeed and grow in Paris in the way that he has.”\n\nRead more on what fashion editors including Glenda Bailey, the editor of Harper’s Bazaar and Carine Roitfeld say about Mr. Wang's final show.\n\nParis\n\nSound Bites\n\nAlexander Wang’s Final Lap at Balenciaga\n\nAlexander Wang takes a selfie for his final bow at @Balenciaga #PFW vvfriedman\n\nHighlights\n\nParis\n\nThe Daily Shoe: Balenciaga\n\nAt Balenciaga, models walked the runway in slide-on spa slippers fashioned from lacy fabric.

You couldn't have imagined it if you had tried.\n\nJun Takahashi has a bright future as a ringmaster if he wants one. His girls were painted as clowns and wore clown-costume ruffs, but the clothes were artful, not funny. His opening check suits were Mod skinny and entirely backless, lacing with long pretty ribbons to great effect.\n\nThis circus also had a better soundtrack than most: all Stones. And there were great pieces printed with the young, never-better-looking faces of Mick, Keef and Co.\n\nParis\n\nFashion Review: On the Couch with Rick Owens, Dior and Lanvin\n\nModels generally carry a lot of things in a typical fashion show — purses, clutches, briefcases, totes, suitcases; at Loewe, there was a bag for every look. But on Thursday, within the bowels of the Palais de Tokyo, in a cavernous concrete bunker for the Rick Owens show, they carried something more unexpected: people.\n\nOr rather, women.\n\nWomen, in Mr. Owens’s scrunched and molded leathers or plain athletic underpinnings, suspended upside down from harnesses like backpacks, arms splayed wide; women, their legs curved over shoulders like a clasp, strapped to chests like gigantic children; women scrunched up in oversize papooses; women carried by other women practically the same size, so their bodies together became a puzzle piece of limbs.\n\nWomen (and this is important) who were the size of regular women, carried by other women the same size, because they were strong enough to support their weight.\n\nRead more here.\n\nParis\n\nReviews\n\nSound Bite: Emilia Clarke at Dior\n\nA shift from courting dragons to the crowds at Dior was a welcome one for the \"Game of Thrones\" star Emilia Clarke.\n\n\"God, I can't tell you what a relief it is not to be rolling around in sand,\" said the British actress as she waited for the show in an oversize tuxedo jacket and heels. \"I am so happy to be in Paris and seeing the latest collection, but I'll only be in town for 12 hours. Filming for the next season is in full swing at the moment.\"\n\nGiven the endless fantastical costume changes required for Ms. Clarke's character, it was suggested to her that getting dressed up to watch a catwalk show must feel almost low-key.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she said. \"The costumes we have on set are utterly phenomenal. But in the real world, nothing feels better than wearing Dior.\"\n\nHighlights\n\nParis\n\nhttps://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/02/multimedia/02tmag-dior/02tmag-dior-facebookJumbo.jpg\n\nDior’s Set, by the Numbers\n\nBefore Paris Fashion Week even began, a team totaling 100 got to work on a man-made mountain blanketed in royal blue and purple flowers. And since this morning, the finished structure — Dior's set, constructed within the Louvre's Cour Carrée courtyard — has flooded Instagram feeds.\n\nMany will remember that Raf Simons presented his debut Dior haute couture collection against a backdrop of five salons walled with flowers — among them, 48,000 delphinium. Today's set featured some 300,000 delphinium, planted on rolling garden turf, which works out to about 200 flowers per invitee.\n\n“Since Raf arrived, he’s been showing the overlap of romanticism and modernity and he’s been doing it with flowers,” said Alexandre de Betak, who has overseen each Dior venue since Simons was appointed in 2012. “It’s not about crazy and gigantic; these are his very impulsive and very personal ideas. And it all came very naturally.”\n\nRead more about the set design in T Magazine\n\nHighlights\n\nParis\n\nSound Bite: Rihanna at Dior\n\nThe sun was blazing down upon the courtyards of the Louvre in Paris on Friday. The Dior crowd was visibly wilting as they entered the vast show space, which had been covered in fresh purple delphiniums.\n\nHolding court inside, in a Dior coat whipped around her like peaches and cream, was Rihanna, an ambassador for the label. Despite the frenzy of photographers, she maintained her composure -- something, she told Styles, that came down to her attire.\n\n\"When I wear Dior, I feel chic, I feel together and I feel expensive,\" she said as her extensive security detail batted fans away. \"I feel like a woman in control. Raf Simons is a rare and amazing designer.\"\n\n\"I've been to a lot of fashion shows in my time,\" she said. \"But I get total shivers of excitement when I come to a Dior catwalk and see the latest designs. I've come town for this show alone. It's a flying visit.\"\n\nOther than Dior, highlights of her visit to Paris are the croissants and the spa in her hotel.\n\n\"I don't really like being pampered, but this one particular spa is quite amazing, so I indulge myself,\" she said. \"If you can't in Paris, where can you?\"\n\nCelebrities\n\nHighlights\n\nParis\n\nThe Scene at Dior\n\nEye Candy\n\nHighlights\n\nParis\n\nThe Daily Jewel: Christian Dior\n\nAt Christian Dior, a sea of Victorian jeweled chokers proved that the neck is the official erogenous zone for spring.\n\nSee more jewels from the runways in T Magazine\n\nParis\n\nFirst Look: Dior\n\nRaf Simons is peeking under the skirts of our forebears.\n\nHis new Dior collection, presented under a towering mountain of purplish-blue flowers, began with Victorian-style undergarments -- like the show-opening shorts and tank in cotton voile -- and built up from there, layering filmy gowns and flower-encrusted parkas on top.\n\nDespite the \"layers of the last,\" Mr. Simons's show notes quote him saying, \"for me it still all feels oddly futuristic and strangely romantic.

Suddenly, showers began, the coats gradually disintegrated into sparkling shift dresses and then continued to transform — dissolving into beautiful shreds of material that mimicked the rivulets of water. Magic.\n\nHighlights\n\nParis\n\nEye Candy: Chalayan\n\nEye Candy\n\nParis\n\nThe Daily Bag: Loewe\n\nFor Loewe, Jonathan Anderson showed translucent bags made from PVC, and a rubber version of his signature Puzzle purse; but this caramel-colored suede tote — in a blown-up wicker weave — felt the most lust-worthy of all.\n\nSee more bags from the runways in T Magazine\n\nParis\n\nFirst Look: Loewe\n\nFor the bright, chilly Loewe show this morning, the stone plinths at Maison de l'Unesco were tightly wrapped with a shiny layer of plastic. Prophetically, it developed.\n\nThis season, Jonathan Anderson introduced a new concept for the house — as well as introducing a lot more of his models — by dressing them in transparent plastic. The first model wore a black sweater, Loewe's typically bombastic jewelry (this time including single mirror-shard earrings and fish necklaces) and a pair of plastic trousers (with a matching, or nearly so, plastic clutch).

The headlines write themselves.\n\nFirst Look\n\nParis\n\nEye Candy: Loewe\n\nEye Candy\n\nParis\n\nParis Fashion Week: Day 4\n\nDay 4 and Paris Fashion Week has well and truly hit its Gucci furry loafer stride (count ’em), with coffee and croissants bright and early to celebrate the unveiling of the new Alexander McQueen flagship store on Rue Saint-Honoré.\n\nAt 9:30 proceedings officially begin at Loewe, swiftly followed by the Chalayan show at the Palais des Beaux-Arts, where the British-Cypriot, fresh from his show this week at Vionnet, will offer up his spring collection.\n\nSome will then forsake lunch to see shows of Issey Miyake and Julien David, but all and sundry will converge come 2:30 for the Christian Dior show at the Louvre. Judging by the volumes of breathless tweets and flowers amassing in spectacular fashion by the museum’s doors, it's bound to be a spectacle.\n\nAn hour later comes Isabel Marant, then the uber-hip Japanese label Undercover at the Cirque d’Hiver. Most everyone will then go home and recharge for one of the biggest shows of the week — if not the entire season — Alexander Wang’s Balenciaga swan song, no doubt swimming with celebrities and models alike. Yohji Yamamoto rounds things up for the day at 8:30, before another endless circuit of private dinners and embassy cocktail parties.

Then came a sartorial takedown on the excess of 21st-century branding, packed with clashing colors and garish handbags and high-heel prints, plus layer upon layer of sequins, flesh-hued corsets and ragged oversize bows.

Then came the first of many models who wore fellow travelers on their backs like knapsacks, trussed to them with padded straps, face up, face down, upside-down or trailing: women bearing women, often in gymnastic contortions. (They were reportedly local gymnasts.) “She ain’t heavy,” the message seemed to run, “she’s my sister.”\n\nIt was transporting and affecting (not least because of the live performance by the vocalist Eska), as well as confounding and odd. There were gasps and iPhone photos, but no immediate explanation from Mr. Owens, a provocateur with a long history of and taste for on-the-runway theatrics. He strode out to take a quick bow after the show, then kept walking — straight out of the building, as it turned out. His press attachés put off answer-seekers, who lined up at the backstage entrance afterward, with a shrug: Who are we to make him stay?\n\nRead more here.\n\nHighlights\n\nParis\n\nHuman Knapsacks at Rick Owens\n\nHuman knapsacks at Rick Owens.

And season after season, he earns it.\n\nThis season's collection was sporty and strange, with track pants, tie-dye, fur fringe and silver embroideries like soda-can tops, like those on the ice blue, show-opening baby-doll dress on Lineisy Montero.\n\nFirst Look\n\nParis\n\nFashion Review: Balmain, Chloé and the Instagram Imperative\n\nFor more than five minutes just after sundown Wednesday, the Eiffel Tower was illuminated by dancing lights of red, pink, purple, blue and white — not to mention polka dots, morphing watercolor illuminations, and the words “La Mode Aime Paris” — which darted up and down its length in time to various Piaf-ian tunes (as well as orchestral crescendos).\n\nThe special sound and light show had been arranged in honor of Fashion Week, and was inaugurated by Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris. She pushed a giant red button near a podium in the Trocadéro to start the spectacle while standing between Sidney Toledano, chief executive of Dior, and Ralph Toledano, president of the Fédération Française de la Couture, which organizes the week. (The Toledanos are not related).\n\nIt was a little lurid, but unquestionably eye-catching. Everyone had their phones out.\n\nThis is pretty much the state of play in fashion now.\n\nRead more here.\n\nSound Bite: Kris Jenner at Balmain\n\nGiven the devotion shown by her tribe of daughters to the designs of Olivier Rousteing, it was little surprise that Kris Jenner had pride of place at the front row of his spring show on Thursday.\n\n\"We've been here in Paris for a couple of days, and it's been much of the usual for me -- working and filming, then running around trying desperately to keep up with Kendall,\" Mrs. Jenner said of her supermodel scion, who later walked twice in the show.\n\n\"And it's not easy let me tell you, her schedule is absolutely crazy. We've had so many fittings and photo shoots. Still, I wanted to be here to support her.\"\n\nAnd, the she added, it wasn't just the younger generation of the family who held affection for the brand -- or its designer.\n\n\"I think Olivier is an absolute genius, namely because he designs for women of all sizes and body shapes. I wear it all the time, and I feel absolutely beautiful in it -- and, like, I've got a bit of an edge. We can all do with some dresses with real va-va-voom.\"\n\nParis\n\nSound Bites\n\nEye Candy: Balmain\n\nEye Candy\n\nParis\n\nFirst Look: Balmain\n\nThe mirrored Balmain catwalk was an endless parade of tween queen supermodels on Thursday, with the likes of Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, Lily Aldridge, Alessandra Ambrosio and Joan Smalls taking to the runway for their BFF, the creative director Olivier Rousteing. Kris Jenner and Jada Pinkett Smith joined the scrum of editors and buyers in what has become one of the hottest tickets of show season.\n\nWhen it came to the collection itself, the inspiration appeared to be something along the lines of Las Vegas ’70s disco diva, updated for the selfie generation.\n\nThe first look, seen here, was a belted skin-tight velour jumpsuit in a hue I'm calling \"Kardashian tan.\"\n\nAnd it was understated compared with what came next: bejeweled mesh pencil skirts, sheer metallic jodhpurs and suede flares in vast, ruffled tiers in a palette of silver and gold, emerald greens and varying shades of tangerine.\n\nFirst Look\n\nParis\n\nThe Daily Jewel: Balmain\n\nFrom models’ slicked-back ponytails to sharp-shouldered jackets, the Balmain show emitted a feeling of power.

But what had brought her to the French capital?\n\n\"Fashion, fashion is what has bought to me to Paris,\" she said from her front-row perch, adding that she had attended the Rochas and Vionnet shows the previous day. \"There's nothing I love more than seeing what's coming next. It gives me a real thrill.\"\n\nChloé was of particular significance, she added.\n\n\"Chloé clothes are my entry into a softer Jada,\" she said. \"Usually, I like to dress with edge, with a lot of rock 'n' roll leathers, I like to appear tough. But these designs are so light and elegant, and they really speak to the more feminine side of me.\"\n\nThat said, Ms. Pinkett Smith was not going to be swayed from a retail pilgrimage she undertakes every time she visits Paris: \"I've got to go over to Balmain before I leave tomorrow. They are just the most gorgeous clothes. I'll have to stop myself from buying up the whole store.\"\n\nParis\n\nSound Bites\n\nFirst Look: Chloé\n\nClare Waight Keller has done folksy and hippie in her time at Chloé, as well as gamine and chic. This season, she tossed it all together — a bit vintage, a bit thrifted — for a look that felt like one a British festivalgoer in the '90s would no doubt recognize. Her show notes called it \"a tribute to girls named Kate, Chloé, Cecilia, Corinne, Rosemary,\" which is to say, the photographer Corinne Day and many of the waifs she helped make stars in that era. Those with long memories were calling up images of models like Rosemary Ferguson and Cecilia Chancellor on their iPhones.\n\nFirst Look\n\nParis\n\nEye Candy: Chloé\n\nEye Candy\n\nParis\n\nThe Eiffel Tower’s Special Look\n\nThe Eiffel Tower gets jiggy with a special sound and light show in honor of Paris Fashion Week.\n\nParis\n\nParis Fashion Week: Day 3\n\nFor those craving sleep after one too many glasses at the whirl of cocktail parties and private dinners on Wednesday night, Day 3 of Paris Fashion Week offers some respite.\n\nAfter the city lit up the Eiffel Tower in a cascade of sparkles to honor the arrival of the style set, the show schedule on Thursday starts at a civilized 10 a.m. with Chloé, before a quick Métro (or Mercedes) ride to Carven in the Jardin des Tuileries an hour later.\n\nA raft of appointments will beckon for some — an hour or two off-duty for others — before the crowds reconvene at 1 p.m. for Ann Demeulemeester, swiftly followed by Paco Rabanne on the Place de la Concorde and then more offerings for the nightclub-hopping set at Balmain from Olivier Rousteing.\n\nCome evening, there are two big-ticket names: Rick Owens shows at 6 at the Palais de Tokyo (cameos by renegade models yet to be confirmed), followed by Lanvin at 8.\n\nAt 9, the crowd will scatter. Some will head to the Vetements show, others to the home of the Chloé designer Clare Waight Keller for cocktails and a live performance. Another tribe altogether will head to a party to celebrate the opening of the latest Vionnet store.\n\nParis\n\nFirst Look: Vionnet\n\nThe Vionnet show -- inspired, legend (and the show notes) had it, by nymphs -- opened with a nymph: Anna Cleveland, whose resplendent posterior appears, fully uncovered, in the label's recent ad campaign. This time, she was covered, in one of the pleated Grecian goddess gowns that Vionnet has made a specialty of.\n\nTomorrow, Vionnet's Paris store opens.

A number of designers have show plain — and a little oversized — white T-shirts. Anthony Vaccarello and Tod’s both styled off-the-shoulder versions with black skirts (the former, slit up to there, and the latter, in embellished and perforated leather). The brand Off-White went for an all-white look, using a neckline cutout, ruffles and frayed edges to break up the monochromatic look.\n\nSee more trend reports in T Magazine\n\nHighlights\n\nParis\n\nThe Daily Shoe: Rochas\n\nRochas models looked as if they were walking on clouds of lace thanks to these dainty kitten keels which also came in shades of peach, sea foam and amber.

Next, a light eyeshadow was applied to the eyelid followed by eyeliner, just along the waterline — “like you had mascara on a few days ago and forgot to take it off,” she said. Lips were merely a shade of the softest pink, smudged on just so with the fingertips.\n\nModels’ hair was left equally undone — the hairstylist Paul Hanlon also set out to keep things looking as natural as possible: “People always feel they have to try and ‘do’ something,” he said of fashion shows. “But these clothes are very grown-up, grand and womanly, and then there’s this very youthful thing with the surf T-shirts — there’s a lot going on — so the hair had to feel believable. You want to know there is a woman under there.” Girls rushing in from the previous show had their hair completely brushed and washed out and then quickly looped up into a relaxed ponytail, no product required. “Like a girl would wear it on the street,” Hanlon said.\n\nSee more backstage beauty reports in T Magazine\n\nBeauty\n\nParis\n\nFashion Review: Achieving Liftoff at Margiela and Courrèges\n\nMight there be life on Mars? Well, there are definitely signs of life in the revived space-age brand Courrèges. Ah, the cosmic coincidence. Welcome to Paris.\n\nActually, there are signs of new life all over, and you don’t need a special rover to find it.\n\nThe Paris shows began (as did New York) with a series of new names making a bid to play in the big game: Kunihiko Morinaga at Anrealage, Anthony Vaccarello, Simon Porte Jacquemus at Jacquemus, Yang Li.\n\nMost of them still suffer from the artistic pretensions of vision-making (Mr. Morinaga asked everyone to “watch” the collection through their iPhone cameras; Mr. Jacquemus had a white horse and small child guest star in his show), and the effects distract from the clothes, but still.\n\nAt least they were experimenting — or, in the case of Mr. Li, refining a mix of liquid tailored trousers, sweeping chiffon trench coats, and asymmetric knits, though things got a little message- heavy when actual messages embroidered in gothic script (“No Sleep,” “No Dream”) were involved.\n\nRead more here.\n\nFirst Look: Dries Van Noten\n\nThe Dries Van Noten show is often touted as one of the hottest tickets of Paris Fashion Week. But guests were a little chilly this season as they crowded into a vast warehouse space on the outskirts of the city.\n\nWrapped in coats and surrounded by weeds and broken glass, attendees were warmed by the jaunty renditions of Kraftwerk from a black-clad string quartet in the middle of the catwalk, and, in turn, by the spring collection.\n\nThe opening look was a loose white slip with gold-beaded bodice, paired with a heavy overcoat finished with dainty gold sprigs. Later came jewel-tone brocaded jackets and dresses, lavish second-skin opera gloves with sparkling, tattoo-style prints, and loose, obi-belted silk pants and skirts that popped in richly colored patterns.\n\nFirst Look\n\nParis\n\nEye Candy: Dries Van Noten\n\nEye Candy\n\nParis\n\nThe Daily Bag: Dries Van Noten\n\nDries Van Noten’s electric-purple clutch captures the rich eccentric vibe we’ve been seeing a lot on the runways.

There were metallic silver gloves, fishnet body stockings, thin plastic hip wraps and boy models to accessorize the girl models. There was also another bag proposition: small, boxy and tied to the body with a silken rope so it could be worn as a backpack, hands-free.\n\nThe better to pilot the brand ship, of course.\n\nFirst Look\n\nParis\n\nMaison Margiela\n\nThe new backpack at @MaisonMargiela - tied on like a belt #PFW vvfriedman\n\nParis\n\nEye Candy: Courrèges\n\nEye Candy\n\nParis\n\nFirst Look: Courrèges\n\nThe first show on a cool, crisp Wednesday morning was Courrèges, and the debut collection of its new creative directors, Sébastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillant.\n\nThe two took to the runway before the show, explaining, in English and French, their belief that ready-to-wear should express “the spirit of ready-to-live.” The collection itself had just 15 designs in 15 materials and colors, what they called “building blocks” for future seasons. A cream cashmere bodysuit under a PVC black biker jacket were the elements of the first look — highlighting the back-to-basics nature of the men’s new designs.\n\nThen came structured little shift dresses and miniskirts with buttons that crept up the sides, and more leather and suede jackets, with giant close-ups of pieces that flashed on a screen as the models walked by.\n\nFirst Look\n\nParis\n\nThe New Courrèges\n\nKicky nouveau space-age at the new Courrèges. matthewschneier\n\nParis\n\nA Face in the Crowd: Nicolas Ghesquière\n\nOn the first evening of Paris Fashion Week, Louis Vuitton and Le Bon Marché kicked off the after-party schedule by co-hosting a party in celebration of the latest designs by Nicolas Ghesquière, Louis Vuitton's creative director.\n\nOutside, the department store windows had been revamped with installations on Louis Vuitton products old and new, while a long black carpet with a velvet rope kept out the public snaked around the Rue de Sèvres. Inside, guests and hosts, including Delphine Arnault, drank long framboise cocktails in and around the vast Louis Vuitton concession. Mr. Ghesquière, decked out in a bomber jacket and looking tan and remarkably relaxed, discussed why he had decided to come along when his spring show was less than a week away.\n\nYou must be used to having parties held for you by now.\n\nYes, but not at Le Bon Marché. The funny thing is, I used to live directly opposite the store when I was younger. I used to stop and look in all the time. And now my face is right there, smack in the middle of those windows. It feels a little crazy, to be honest.\n\nAnd what do you think of the installations that they've put together?\n\nThey are wonderful. They make me incredibly proud, especially the digital components. I am very impressed by what's been done. It's a vital means of showcasing a heritage brand in today's climate.\n\nIt was clear that you felt that way from the Louis Vuitton exhibition that opened during London Fashion Week, full of technological trailblazing.\n\nWell, it's something I feel really passionate about. I am insisting on it being front and center of our brand. We are a brand full of history, but we have to create balance with the future. I don't want people thinking we have a vision that is stuck in the past.\n\nTalking of the future: In a week's time, you'll be taking a bow on the runway after your spring show.\n\nI know, I know, don't say another word! I am stressed and nervous and trying not to think too much about it. That said, I actually think it's very important to get out and about, to unwind, have a drink and see my friends in the run-up to a show. I never stay locked up in the studio 24/7. I think it's a rather French approach to things.\n\nHow else have you been distracting yourself?\n\nI went to the Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster show that just opened at the Centre Pompidou, which was terrific. Anyone who comes to Paris should try and see it. Try to find an hour between shows and go.\n\nHighlights\n\nParis\n\nParties\n\nThe Daily Jewel: Lemaire\n\nAt Lemaire, a sleek silver cuff was worn over the sleeve of a crisp white shirt dress.

Yes, there were some shows in Paris on Tuesday — Anrealage, Anthony Vaccarello, Jacquemus — but in general, it wasn’t as jam-packed as show days usually are.\n\nConsider that reprieve over.\n\nWednesday is a work day, and it begins bright and early, with the first show from Courrèges’s newly named artistic directors, Sébastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillant, at 9. (The pair’s other line, Coperni Femme, has been earning good reviews, too.) From there, it’s on to Christophe Lemaire — whose collaborative collection with Uniqlo goes on sale this week, by the way — and then the latest from John Galliano at Maison Margiela at 11. So much for your easy, cafe crème morning.\n\nThere are newcomers in the afternoon, too, like the first staged presentation from Off-White, the streetwear collection by Virgil Abloh, a finalist for the LVMH Prize, as well as longtime favorites like Dries Van Noten at 3 and Rochas at 5.\n\nThe day ends with Aganovich at 6 and Vionnet at 8. (Don’t spend all your Vionnet energy in one place. Its Paris store is to open with a party Thursday night.) Then the hardy and the crystal-bedecked will be off to Swarovski’s cocktail at the Salons France-Amérique to celebrate the brand's 120th anniversary.\n\nHighlights\n\nParis\n\nAct 1: Enter Baby Sisyphus, pushing giant fabric ball.\n\nAct 2: Some clothes.\n\nAct 3: And on the third day, Jacquemus created horses.\n\nAct 4: The Unraveling.\n\nAct 5: I wandered lonely as a cloud.\n\nAct 6: Epilogue.\n\nAct 1: Enter Baby Sisyphus, pushing giant fabric ball.\n\nAct 2: Some clothes.\n\nAct 3: And on the third day, Jacquemus created horses.\n\nAct 4: The Unraveling.\n\nAct 5: I wandered lonely as a cloud.\n\nAct 6: Epilogue.\n\n6 Acts at Jacquemus\n\nOn the theory that an avant-garde performance deserves an avant-grade response, we've transposed Jacquemus' spring theatrical into ... a spring theatrical.

For the first look of his new spring collection, he sent the British model Edie Campbell out to battle in a khaki miniskirt suit, with black leather trimmings, gold studs and a daring thigh-high split.\n\nA march of military touches continued, before advancing to sparkly cocktail dresses and slashed jeans with simple cotton shirts. But all were designed for an urban girl who styles herself with grit and edge, just like Leigh Lezark and Caroline de Maigret, who looked on approvingly from the front row.\n\nFirst Look\n\nParis\n\nAnrealage Plays With Flash\n\nBeauty may be in the eye of the beholder, but a beholder who didn't have a smartphone would have been in trouble at the Anrealage show.\n\n\"This show will only be visible using flash photography,\" a robotic voice announced through the headphones that were provided as guests entered the Palais du Tokyo. Glasses of sake folllowed, as did quirkily illustrated instructions in both English and Japanese on how to activate the tool on your iPhone.\n\n\"Reflect a light -- it gives a light,\" read the show notes cryptically. \"Reflect reality -- It makes a new reality.\"\n\nAt first, a barrage of 3D surround-sound and a blinding wall of flashes revealed very little. But then, those flashes set off different colors, prints and textural effects unseen by the naked eye. Then, after looking through a smartphone lens, the collection, packed with voluminous silhouettes, was seen in a whole new light.\n\nHighlights\n\nParis\n\nPlaying With Light\n\nAt Anrealage, phone camera flashes would set off different colours & texture effects unseen by the naked eye #PFW lizziepaton\n\nHighlights\n\nParis\n\nThe Row Debuts Their Shoe Collection\n\n\"Paris begins with The Row and the debut of their first shoe collection-finally!

The first day of the French schedule eases us into what is generally the most jam-packed week of the season.\n\nBut there are some surprises, including a notable addition to the Tuesday schedule. The Row, usually a high point of the New York calendar, has decamped to do presentations in Paris instead. The Olsen sisters will be holding court on the Rue des Francs Bourgeois from 3 p.m. on.\n\nNext, it's the Anrealage show at the Palais de Tokyo, followed by Anthony Vaccarello, then Jacquemus at 8 p.m. For evening entertainment, Louis Vuitton is holding a party with Le Bon Marché, the famous Left Bank department store.\n\nParis\n\nMilan Fashion Week\n\nIntroducing: Best of the Show Notes, Milan Version\n\nThe hamster wheel that is the women's wear show circuit does not allow a lot of leisure time for reading, but luckily designers provide some literary material of their own to all involved. The Show Note -- a handout that purports to describe what was in a creative director’s mind when he or she made what they made; what book or film or artist or decade or shape inspired their flight of fashion — has developed into something of an art form all its own, culminating in some truly mind-boggling bits of prose.\n\nPut another way: If you thought certain styles or silhouettes were hard to understand, just consider the following excerpts:\n\n“These hints gather on the collection’s clothes to form eclectic palimpsests rich with heterogeneous references.” (Gucci)\n\n“Bling bling. At a metropolitan speed/Emotion/Askew. Pointy. Unbalanced. Dynamic.” (Emilio Pucci)\n\n“Naive is the new sophisticated.” (MaxMara)\n\n“Perforated tunics add another layer of stimulation to the abstract complexity of the compositions.” (Marni)\n\n“A synthetic dawn spreads throughout the room, radiating opalescent reflections.” (Prada)\n\n“Necklines, sophisticated and deconstructed, slip away like a passing day.” (Tod’s)\n\nHighlights\n\nMilan\n\nGigi Hadid Defends Herself Against Online Critics\n\nThe model Gigi Hadid, who is possessed of, by her own admission, a more womanly figure than many of the other models working fashion’s runways, appeared in the Versace show in Milan and has arrived in Paris for the fashion shows here.\n\nMs. Hadid’s appearances tend to quickly become social media spectacles (anecdotally, phones seem to rise for photos far more often when she’s on a runway), but the attention hasn’t all been positive. Today, she took to her Instagram account to defend herself and her body against online critics pointing out flaws and questioning her credentials.\n\nRead more here.\n\nHighlights\n\nThe Daily Bag: Trussardi\n\nThere’s nothing better than a simple shopper tote stitched in a super luxe and durable leather.

Well, fashion week always is. What will we remember from the last five days? A troika of takeaway trends (now say that 10 times fast).\n\nTrends from the catwalk: Stripes, stripes, everywhere from Prada to Missoni, MaxMara and Armani. Maritime, maximalist, multicolored, they were the statement of the season. Indeed, their only competitor in the ubiquity stakes was animal print, as seen at Cavalli, Versace and Bottega Veneta, to name a few. Even for a city built on skins, the amount of leopard and cheetah, and not-in-nature-but-we-know-it’s-a-big-cat, going around was notable. Time to embrace the creature comforts. Or harness them. Harnesses, and other forms of straps and binding agents being another subject of groupthink, at least at Fendi, Jil Sander and Fausto Puglisi.\n\nTrends from the front row: This was the week fashion folk turned into fashion victims, jamming themselves into the newly renovated Gucci store on via Montenapoleone to snatch up fur-lined horse-bit slippers, loafers, big GG belts and flowered trouser sets. Bryan Boy and the Harper’s Bazaar editor in chief, Glenda Bailey, were spotted front row in the same green floral pants (Ms. Bailey wearing the silk version with matching shirt; Mr. Boy, the denim). Another editor confessed to going to the store in search of the black loafers and ending up with bright red ones because that’s all that was left. It’s been a long time since one brand dominated the front row in this way.\n\nTrends from backstage: It’s all about the buzz cut. From the bristle-topped twins Giulia and Camilla Venturini, artists and members of the Tod’s band who walked the Tod’s show, to the blond and fuzzy model Kris Gottschalk to the entirely bald Yana Dobrolyubova, who took a turn at Emporio Armani, heads have been in the spotlight. Why hide your beauty under a bushel of hair? Razor sellers of the world, rejoice.\n\nHighlights\n\nMilan\n\nSound Bite: Sophia Loren at Giorgio Armani\n\nHis gowns have long been a mainstay of the Hollywood red carpet, but Giorgio Armani had the Italian queen of the silver screen in the front row of his show on Monday.\n\nSophia Loren arrived just before the lights went down, sending the Italian paparazzi into a frenzy. Immediately after the show, she sat next to the designer during a lecture celebrating his autobiography, being published by Rizzoli.\n\n“It was such a beautiful show this season, such colors! Such elegance,” said Ms. Loren as she made her way in a small scrum to the book session. “I really truly loved it.”\n\n“I wanted to be here because I wanted to make Giorgio happy, but also it makes me happy, too,” she said. “It makes me happy to show him how proud we are of him. He means a lot to me and a lot to Italy. I can't wait to read the book — I hope there is a copy for me!”\n\nSound Bites\n\nMilan\n\nFashion Reivew: Armani, Missoni and More\n\nMilan Fashion Week came to a close just after a total lunar eclipse, the sort that indicates heavenly bodies in perfect alignment. As portents go, it doesn’t get much better than that.\n\nThe clothes, however, did not quite live up to the — well, astronomical implications. All that new energy everyone kept talking about during the week? It got a boost from a gently calibrated, Balthus-inspired Arthur Arbesser show, full of youthful (but not naïve) florals and tone-on-tone ghostly cat prints, but mostly felt gone with the blood moon.\n\nInstead, Milan ended in retrograde.\n\nTo celebrate his new book, a 40th anniversary extravaganza tracing his career from childhood to today, Giorgio Armani had not a party but a presentation. At 12:30 in the afternoon. Immediately after his show.\n\nRead more on Vanessa Friedman's fashion review of Armani, Missoni, Salvatore Ferragamo and Arthur Arbesser.\n\nMilan\n\nReviews\n\nThe Daily Jewel: Giorgio Armani\n\nGiorgio Armani played with the conservative silk scarf, reimagining it with a clasped necklace decorated with beading and giant tassels. The idea is quite practical: it delivers all the pulled-together chicness of a foulard without the arduous task of having to arrange it perfectly around your neck.\n\nSee more daily jewels in T Magazine\n\nMilan\n\nFirst Look: Giorgio Armani\n\nThere are seasons when Giorgio Armani zigs while Milan zags, but stripes have been a feature of several shows this week — and here they were again to open the Armani show, in a woven jacket worn over a bloomer-ish romper. Most models were also fitted with an eye patch of swooping bangs.\n\nFirst Look\n\nMilan\n\nEye Candy: Arthur Arbesser\n\nA model waits backstage at this morning's show.

The best part? You don’t have to wait till spring to buy them — they’re available now on nike.com.\n\nSee more daily shoes in T Magazine\n\nMilan\n\nArthur Arbesser, Not a Cat Person\n\nAn enormous cat sat on the runway, dwarfing the photographers’ pit. Backstage, Arthur Arbesser was answering questions in a T-shirt with a watercolor kitty.\n\n“I'm not a cat person at all,” he said. But the show’s inspiration was Balthus, the Polish-French painter of young girls and cats, so he dove right in.\n\nStaging a fashion show naturally furnishes a cadre of young girls. One sat in stocking feet on a slipper chair opposite the big cat for the entire show.\n\n“I wanted to show a completely different side of me,” Mr. Arbesser said. His presentations have tended toward the cerebral, but this one was all misty feeling, prompted, he said, by the “fragile girls that are on the journey to becoming a woman,” when “you’re not aware of your power and your appeal.”\n\nBalthus’s paintings of young women all have a subversive edge of the erotic, and a girl in Mr. Arbesser’s knit-net polo would have to be pretty dense not to be aware of her appeal (at least if she’s wearing nothing under it, as the models were). But on balance, the collection skewed sweeter than sexy, with watercolor florals, silk dresses and some girlish knitwear.\n\nThe cat appeared to play protectress — at least for now.\n\nMilan\n\nFashion Review: Versace to Bottega Veneta: Forging New Frontiers\n\nBorders and barriers are touchy and omnipresent subjects in Europe these days: difficult for an industry like fashion, which has its own exclusionary issues (price, size, taste) to address, yet impossible to ignore. Even for designers, who know perfectly well that they risk accusations of hypocrisy and dilettantism if they dare to wade into any political arena.\n\nOr so it seemed in Milan over the weekend, as brand after brand acknowledged, in manners ranging from the overt to the oblique, what was going on outside the frontiers of fashionland.\n\nAntonio Marras, for example, dedicated his multicultural romance of a collection to “all peoples in flight,” claiming as an inspiration the Armenian director and painter Sergei Parajanov, and as a collaborator, the Iranian artist Mahmoud Saleh Mohammadi.\n\nSee more from Vanessa Friedman's fashion review on Versace, Bottega Veneta, Tod’s, Marni and Antonio Marras.\n\nMilan\n\nReviews\n\nMilan Fashion Week: Day 6\n\nThe last day of Milan Fashion Week is as short and sweet as an affogato. On Monday, the style set will dash to Arthur Arbesser at 10 a.m. on the Piazza Duomo, followed just an hour later by the closing show, Giorgio Armani.\n\nMost showgoers will then hotfoot it straight to the airport, for the fourth and final leg of the European grand tour.\n\nBonjour, Paris!\n\nMilan\n\nMissoni\n\nMissoni sent out stripes, stripes and stripes for its spring collection tonight: stripes in knit, stripes on sandals, stripes on sneakers. As monomanias go, it's as good as any other.\n\nAt least it should be well received by the crowd of Missoni enthusiasts, dressed for the occasion in their Missoni best.\n\nMilan\n\nEye Candy: Missoni\n\nEye Candy\n\nMilan\n\nOptical Stripes at Missoni\n\nDeja vu!

At shows as disparate as Jil Sander and Salvatore Ferragamo, they fluttered in the wake of the wearers.\n\nFrom the first, the same was true at Massimo Giorgetti's MSGM. The opening look was a low-cut blue dress with tendril-like chains that flew as its model stomped to a Le Tigre soundtrack. As the show progressed, the pace stayed martial — so much so that one of the model's earrings flew clean off and landed on the runway.\n\nFirst Look\n\nMilan\n\nEye Candy: Salvatore Ferragamo\n\nFlowing dresses with pleats in many different colors accentuated movement as they came down the runway.\n\nSee more of the scene at Ferragamo in T Magazine\n\nEye Candy\n\nMilan\n\nThe Daily Jewel: Ferragamo\n\nFerragamo offered a spin on the classic pearl earring and necklace combo, mixing single oversize white and black pearls on minimal chains. The simplicity of the look was amplified by models’ slicked-back and side-parted hair — a trick that will also elongate and slim the appearance of one’s neck.\n\nSee more daily jewels in T Magazine\n\nMilan\n\nFace in the Crowd: Dylan Penn\n\nDeep in the belly of the old Milan Stock Exchange, the crowd started wilting under the bright lights Sunday afternoon as the Salvatore Ferragamo show ran 40 minutes late.\n\nThe reason? Dylan and Hopper Penn, the children of Sean Penn and Robin Wright, had yet to arrive. When they did, the crowd burst into mock applause. Styles stole five minutes with Dylan, dressed head to toe in Ferragamo, at the end of the show. (Hopper hovered somewhat nervously in the background, besieged by the excitable Italian news media).\n\nWhat brings you to Milan?\n\nGosh, it's so hot I'm sweating! Those lights are insane. I'm just here on a flying two-day visit for this show. It's my first-ever trip to the city.\n\nSo this is your first Ferragamo show?\n\nYes. And it wasn't at all as I expected. I was in the showroom yesterday, and there was a lot of jersey and knit. But I loved the whimsical romanticism of this. It was great, especially the capes.\n\nWhy is your brother here?\n\nHe's my date. He thought he'd try the fashion world on for size, but this still isn't really his scene. We're both still getting into it. It's a strange and fascinating world for the outsider.\n\nWhat's next on your schedule?\n\nWell, in the next 24 hours a trip to the Duomo. And now I've seen that Lake Como is an hour on the train. I might try and see that, too. I had my heart set on a trip to see \"The Last Supper,\" but there's a three-week waiting list for tickets. I'll have to be more organized next time.\n\nAnd what about when you leave Italy?\n\nWell, I start shooting a movie in a month, swiftly followed by another back-to-back. I always thought I'd be behind the camera, to be honest. For a long time I never thought I'd do what my parents do. But I do l"
