He is going to Regionals once again this year! Now to get his FHANA paperwork all squared up so he can get High Points!\n\n-Alexis in Ohio\n\nAnother update on “Annie”. I have now owned her for 2 yrs and she still surprises me all the time. She is now showing second level with Tara and doing well as you can see. I am doing lots of trail work and we average 10-25 miles a week! Everyone that meets her loves her! Thanks again for my wonderful partner\n\n-Sharon\n\n\"I have purchased numerous horses over the years and Panda was by far the best purchase. Kelsey was extremely helpful and honest about Panda. He has been nothing short of what was promised. I was looking for the kid and grandma safe horse that could help me overcome being nervous as a rider and that is 100% what I got. Panda has allowed me to enjoying riding again because he is SAFE and nothing short of that. Kelsey and Cheryl were both very helpful throughout the purchase process. From insurance recommendations to locating a shipper, I have never experienced such a stress free and easy purchase. I purchased Panda based off of the videos, pictures, and what information Kelsey disclosed as I live several states away. I would recommend Friesian Marketplace to anyone who is looking for their dream horse from honest sellers!\"\n\nI cannot thank you enough for such an amazing horse. I have changed his name to Romani, it is a word used in gypsy culture. He is absolutely amazing. I'm able to ride by myself and not be nervous and I cannot thank you enough for that. I really thought about giving up riding because I just didn't enjoy it anymore and he has given me so much purpose and joy for this sport again. Thanks again and if I'm ever looking to purchase an additional horse or no anyone looking for a breed you have, I would 100% direct them your way.”\n\nBrittany in PA\n\nCheryl and Kelsey, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart! I found Armani Ster Sport on your website and after reading his synopsis, I knew he was the one for me. My trainer and I decided to make the trip to try him. From the moment we arrived, we were treated like family. Once I saw Armani, I just knew he was the one! Their description of him was spot on! Cheryl and Kelsey gave us all the info needed from transportation services, feed suggestions, blanket size etc. Armani arrived in California healthy and happy. He has won the hearts of everyone at his new home! I couldn't be happier to continue my dressage journey on the safest, most lovable partner!\n\nLinda in California\n\nWe are doing great! I love him so much! I found my best friend. I have never had a bond with a horse like I do with him.\n\n-Jennifer in SC\n\nI have had my Friesian, \"Batman\" for about two months now. It has taken me a little time to write a review as I wanted to get to know him and all the wonderful qualities he possesses. Before calling Friesian Marketplace and talking with Cheryl, I did a lot of shopping on the internet. When I found their website, I began reading all of the testimonials . I guess mine is going to sound like all the others and for good reason. I am pleased to tell you that every single thing I was told and promised by Cheryl was exactly what I received. When I began my search I wanted a younger horse. I told Cheryl I would like a horse 4 or 6 years old. When she called me and told me that they had a 10 year old coming in in February, I was not that interested due to his age. Cheryl was very clear in explaining to me that it could be a big mistake to get a young horse at my age (60) and I would be best suited to get a solid horse that has, \"been there, done that.\" I had not ridden in 41 years and although I had been told this before, I still was thinking younger meant more years together and that was attractive to me. She told me that Batman would be ready for a preview around the beginning of April. That allows for them to have time to work with their new imports to assure they are everything they anticipated. On April 9th, Easter Sunday, my husband and I drove 8 hours to go and see \"Batman\". I had been sent his pictures and videos and felt that I could see myself falling in love with him. Once we arrived it was nothing short of a great experience. Cheryl and Kelsey are just wonderful. They handled that transaction seamlessly and we did not have to do anything. Prior to the sale Batman had begun his necessary immunizations, had his teeth floated and a new set of shoes. His coat , mane, and tail were just beautiful and he had the personality to match. I decided to buy all his tack from them as well, since the Friesian is a \"big boy\" and I wanted to make sure I had the right fit. Everything from start to finish was enjoyable and perfectly executed. I just started dressage lessons and I am just realizing how well trained my boy is. Everyone at my new barn is in awe of him. We named him \"Ben\". He is sweet, funny, forward moving yet safe and trustworthy. He will run across the pasture to see me even though everything is still new to him. He loves people and gets along with his pasture mate(s). I could not be happier with Ben. He is just what I needed and everything I could have wanted. Thank you so much Cheryl and Kelsey for all that you do. We asked and you delivered . We will definitely be buying a buddy for Ben and we will be calling Friesian Marketplace.\n\n-Lucinda in Florida\n\nHello! I hope all is well! It’s been very hot here! Having so much fun learning ground work and riding! Love you both so much\n\n-Margaret in Maine\n\nHi Kelsey & Cheryl, I wanted to give you an update on Rintje (who is now known around the barn as Thor!) We’ve only had him a few months and as you know, have switched disciplines from dressage to saddle seat/hunt seat riding. He is the most amazing horse. He is smart and sweet and absolutely gorgeous! Everyone loves him! Our trainer, Jessica Saft, showed him at a local show this past weekend and won his championship class with 6 other horses. You would never know this was his first time competing in this type of event. He’s an absolute dream and it’s an honor to own this magnificent creature!\n\nSam in Florida\n\nHi Kelsey & Cheryl!\n\nZiggy has come a long way in his training over the last year. We have had so much fun discovering his hidden talents such as Piaffe & Flying Changes that he loves to do!\n\nI could not be happier with him! He is absolutely the sweetest boy. He’s always happy to give kisses and he’s so gentle with everyone he meets. He’s sensitive in a good way, very light in the hand and always willing to try. He’s the “babysitter” at the barn to other horses that are new.\n\nHe has successfully competed in Dressage competitions with average scores in the mid-70s! We are ready to move onto a new chapter, and I can’t wait to see him thrive!\n\nThank you Kelsey & Cheryl for your patience to find the right horse as this was my first horse after owning a Draft Cross for 32 years. Ziggy has my heart If he could only fit inside my house, he would become part of the clan with our golden retrievers. Thank you so much for Ziggy!! (He says hello from Wellington FL)\n\nPS I provide pet therapy with my golden “William Wallace of Braveheart” to the elderly in Assisted Living & Memory Care. They also Love seeing pictures of ZIGGY And a he’s now a photo college on the picture wall made by his fan club where I work\n\nHis canter has amazing power & smooth as butter he’s so much fun!\n\nTracey in Florida\n\nI am so happy that Cheryl and Kelsey helped pair me with Aruthur. I had been looking for my next partner for over a year. It was a great experience to meet Aruthur and find out he was truly the horse that was described to me. Having looked at many “amateur friendly and talented horses” to find they were anything but that, it made my long drive to see him more than worth my trip. He is happy in his new home and a barn favorite. We are hoping to compete at FEI level dressage and I looking forward to years of fun together.\n\nHappy Horse Mom,\n\nRadene\n\nHere is Nala (Daisy) and I's memories from over the years From lessons, shows, halloween costumes and kid's birthday parties, Nala and I have built such a strong relationship over the years. Nothing is more important to me than having a positive relationship with my horse, so it is imperative for me to spend a lot of time with her, both training under saddle and lots of ground time In and out of the saddle, Nala is my best friend and partner first. Through the years, our relationship has become very solid and she trusts me so much and allows me to throw so much at her, she barely bats an eye! These photos may look to be just cute photos, but to me it is a testament to our relationship. I love her with all my heart, and I can't wait to make even more memories with her She is without a doubt my heart horse\n\nPaige in KY\n\n“Oh my goodness!!!!! GABRIEL is wonderful! I let them all get acquainted and let him settle then decided to start walking him around (which I know sounds so bizarre but little tiny steps for me) then low and behold we ventured to the indoor! My trainer loves Gabriel! His willing spirit and kind disposition is really a dream..for me! I’m loving knowing I have such a beautiful animal and everything to ride and there’s been zero negative experiences!!! Marsh is helping me finish the tack barn and the arena will happen at some point. I’ve thought of you all every day! Thank you soooo much for your kind advice and making it happen! I hug and kiss him constantly and everyone loves him at first sight! Fairytale’s do come true. Much love to you and your mom!”\n\nMargaret In Maine\n\nGood morning!\n\nI’m sure you must think of all the horses that you have helped to find loving homes over the years so thought I’d reach out to say hi and to send a few pics of Minze.\n\nHe remains the love of my life and, as you will see, is as handsome as ever!\n\nHe LOVES his baths. Pic from Wed so just a few days ago. His mane is braided so doesn’t really show. Still amazing.\n\nPS... I’m a much better rider these days haha..\n\nHope all is well with you! Love to all.... ☺️\n\nAmy in CA\n\nBuying my new horse from Friesian Marketplace was such a wonderful experience. Kelsey and Cheryl were so friendly, responsive, and accommodating, their facility is beautiful, and they made the whole process, from trial rides to vet check to shipping, seamless. My horse is exactly what they described in the ad – actually, I think he’s more perfect than as described. But what I love most is that they have checked in on my boy after purchase to make sure he’s settling in ok and everyone is happy – it’s not just a sale facility, they genuinely care about the horses and having happy customers. As a Friesian devotee, I’m sure I’ll be back.\n\nErin in Florida\n\nOscar arrived safely in Colorado and he was everything and more coming off the trailer that we were hoping for. He's an absolutely stunning Friesian gelding with hair for miles. Both Cheryl and Kelsey were very detailed in explaining where he was in his training at age 4. That has been a huge help in getting him acclimated his new home and training going forward. Oscar is very light on his feet, extremely athletic and smart. Even at four we've been able to ride him around the farm with other horses. Oscar gets along with all the other geldings in his pasture. He's been quite a clown and entertaining all the mares and the ladies at the farm. He's been a gem on the ground from grooming to ground work, he's very willing to please. Friesian Marketplace is definitely the place to find your dream Friesian horse. Cheryl and Kelsey know these horses very well, they work them and access their personalities to make the best match. They were very thorough on all the paperwork, arranging transportation to Colorado, great communication and follow up after he arrived. There can be risks involved when buying these amazing horses from overseas. Friesian Marketplace eliminates the risks so you know exactly what kind of horse you are buying so it fits the owner's needs and expectations. Highly recommend!! They are the best!\n\nThanks always!\n\nDebbie in Colorado\n\nHi Kelsey\n\nI’ve been remiss in writing back to you and your mom. Annie is my dream come true in horse form. I adore her! She is smart and learns very quickly. She could already compete in an intro Western Dressage show or a training level in English Dressage. I ride her at least 4-5 times a week. Tara trains her once a week and I take a lesson on her once or twice a week. We also trail ride 3-6 miles a week by ourselves. I’ve never had a horse I could do that with. She has a large pasture that she shares with 2 other mares and an elderly gelding. They get along famously! She is the most sane and sensible horse that I have known. I always feel safe around her and on her. She didn’t even move a muscle when a turkey vulture took off over our heads! She is a barn favorite and gets lots of loving from everyone. I am infinitely grateful that I was in the right place at the right time to purchase this diamond of a horse. We will be starting our show season in about a month and I will be sure to send you some photos.\n\nThanks again, Sharon\n\nI apologize profusely this email is 11 days LATE!?! Needless to say, I've been spending my days with \"Quinn\" (renamed cuz two stalls down is another horse named Spirit - lol, woo woo moment). Hope you like the new name. Seized the opportunity to give him a good ol' Irish name which means \"leader/chief\", lol. Chuckles cuz during our first week I was unconfident, and he was indeed the leader, but today we are figuring it out = sooo much FUN!\n\nQuinn is A BLAST EVERYDAY! I'm lucky to spend every day with him since his arrival. Quinn was delivered in great condition. The transporter, Annette was super. She was the coolest and helped me get Quinn to his stall.\n\nI am so grateful for the caring, patience and time you and Cheryl extended to me during this sale/matchmaking. Quinn is \"thee horse\" that I was searching for - the horse I want to spend my days with - his temperament matches his looks. Q has the amount of Life/energy that shines a light on what I need to learn to be a responsible owner. He makes me think = MAJOR FUN EVERYDAY - LOVE IT!\n\nDiana, my trainer, is impressed how quickly he settled down into his new environment. She is very complimentary about how he rode for the first time - loved his headset and stated \"you will love his gaits\". Diana mentioned how you cared about selling a horse suitable for the client. I've had 6 rides - Wednesday I was changing directions at a trot - awesome experiences. I'm riding with very small spurs. His trot is comfortable and I can keep Q going for several laps around a large covered arena with little effort. lol, it may not be pretty, but for the first time I'm learning how to ride with calves and slight spur contact instead of exhaustively kicking.\n\nI believe in the first email I sent upon Quinn's arrival, I mentioned the one other Gypsy on the property is in the same barn. And the trainer, Andrea said she bought a Friesian from you during the pandemic sight unseen. Andrea stressed the horse that was delivered was exactly what you said. She had only great compliments about Friesian Marketplace. Andrea said when she heard a Gypsy from your barn was coming, she knew \"the horse would be of quality\". Those were her words.\n\nLadies comment how gorgeous Quinn is and how unique his coloring is. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE the tack you ordered. The saddle is a dream straight out of the box - thank you. It was delivered in perfect condition. OMG, the reins are sooo cool! Get compliments on how it matches Quinn. Love love the bridle and breastcollar - especially the bridle since I left that up to your discretion - super job, Kelsey! Quinn seems happy with your bit selection - thank you. Diana likes the saddle pad and how it will keep Quinn cool during warm days. Women really like your tack, especially the blanket - they find it unique. I'm surprised at myself how for some reason I'm not self conscious in your tack. In the past, I preferred to avoid silver and \"bling\". Lol, I guess Quinn is the \"blingiest\" horse I have ever ridden and so now it's fun to ride the whole package:))))\n\nWellll, this email is the longest ever, aye = why it took me this long to reply - sorry. But I wanted to tell both you and Cheryl how great Quinn and I are doing in Coto Equestrian Preserve. Can't thank you both enough.\n\nWith much blessings, gratitude and respect\n\nCarolyn and Quinn in California\n\nI just wanted to thank you all again for helping my dream come true. Febus is the most beautiful, wonderful absolute dream horse! He is better than anything I could have imagined. My family came to visit and everyone wanted to ride him, so we had people from 9 -71 riding him and he took wonderful care of each and every person.\n\nSince the moment I called the Friesian Marketplace phone number I was met with kindness and professionalism. What a wonderful team of people you have! The horses you sell are a true testament to how wonderful your group really is! Again I couldn’t be happier with my wonderful dream boy Febus, he is the best thing to happen in my life in a long time! Thank you all and I am forever grateful!\n\nElizabeth in Georgia\n\nMy husband and I met Cheryl and Kelsey in December of 2021 where we met our beautiful Friesian, Peter and our Awesome Percheron, Zeus. They are super kind, extremely knowledgeable and very helpful. The training that goes into their horses on a daily basis is amazing. Kelsey and Cheryl put their hearts and souls into these horses and love every minute of it. We were just getting back into horses after not having any for many many years and we couldn’t have gone to a better place to find our beautiful horses and to be shown the ropes by two great people. We even boarded them there for a couple of months after we purchased them so we could get our barn built. We took lessons there that were so helpful and a ton of fun. Cheryl and Kelsey made the whole experience absolutely amazing. We would highly recommend Friesian Market Place to any who wants a beautiful trained horse.\n\nJason & Kristen Ciavarro\n\nHi Cheryl and Kelsey. I wanted to give you guys an update on Thorin aka \"Bubbles\". My God this horse. He is everything I was looking for. He's kind, soft, forgiving of my mistakes, gentle with my hubby, and so smart. Show him something once and he gets it. Wow his half-pass! I just love him to death. He's got his forever home now. I'm so happy with him. Thank you for answering all my endless questions and selling me such a spectacular horse. You girls fairly represented him, no BS. I would recommend you guys to anyone looking for a Friesian. I've had so many people saying \"you can't do it\"....Just watch me.\n\nDenise in NY\n\nThank you Cheryl and Friesian Marketplace ! We love sweet Iefke so very much. This young horse is such a good teacher, friend and partner. She has only been with us now for just over 2 months but I also don’t remember a time without her. She is so smart, curious, willing and full of trust. Her TRY is incredible and she remembers *everything*. We cannot wait to meet her beautiful foal this coming spring. Thank you for my making my first Friesian experience a wonderful one. The future is bright and hopeful with this special mare by my side!\n\nKylee in CA\n\nIt was such a pleasure to work with Kelsey and Cheryl during the entire process of purchasing my Beautiful Remy. Horse Shopping can be a stressful and emotional experience but these wonderful ladies at FMP made it so enjoyable. They matched me with a horse they knew would be a perfect fit and I fell in love from the moment I sat in the saddle. Their professionalism and knowledge went beyond my expectations, and they were very responsive with any questions I had. I appreciated the fact that they were just as concerned about their horse finding a good home as I was about making sure that we would be a good match. It’s been a little over a month of Remy and I beginning our dressage journey together and I enjoy his personality, beauty and quality more and more each day. He has turned out to be everything I hoped for and more.\n\nMelanie in Louisiana\n\nCheryl and Kelsey, I just wanted to reach out to say thank you again! Cooper is absolutely amazing, and everything you described him to be! You really have made a life long dream for me come true. Cooper is doing great! He has bonded so well to my son, and he spends hours with him daily! He is learning so many new tricks, and is incredibly patient while I get back into the swing of things riding after 10 years! I hope when our property is finished, we will be able to be a return customer!!! Thanks again ❤️❤️\n\nNicole in NC\n\nI wanted to take a moment to discuss my experience buying a horse from Friesian Marketplace. I had previously bought a horse sight unseen and it didn't work out at all. I swore I would never do it again but then the ad for this lovely young horse, a Barock Pinto named Harvey Specter, was sent to me. The process was very fair, in my opinion, for the number of interested parties. I thought I had lost him as I was second in line and then as luck would have it the buyer ahead of me had to back out for her own (very sensible) reasons. Cheryl was very helpful answering all my questions about him initially and Kelsey assisted with the latter half of the process. They were very patient with my vetting process and I didn't feel pressured or rushed. The shipper they recommended was excellent and soon a lovely Barock Pinto stepped off the trailer, calmly took in the new scenery, and started eating grass. I am not an incredibly brave or confident rider and I am not a professional; ordinarily such a young horse (he turned 4 soon after arriving at my farm!) would be out of the question as I don't always have access to regular help from a trainer. This really was, as they said, an exceptionally good minded young horse. He has a truly lovely personality and is a very special young horse. I'm so glad I found him and I would absolutely buy another horse from them again without hesitation.\n\nHeather in Florida\n\nWe purchased Tiemo from Friesian Marketplace sight unseen and from out of state. After just having sold a newly purchased bucker that was demonstrated to us and carefully researched, this was a scary proposition. But, we have found Tiemo, 7, to be exactly as he was represented. He is truly an “old soul” and “loving, relaxed, uncomplicated, and gentle.” The web transactions were easy for my 75 years, and the mother and daughter duo were wonderful to deal with. I highly recommend everyone involved. Even the shipper and vet were gems!\n\nKaren B. Castelli, Harrisburg, Pa.\n\nI have had the pleasure of witnessing the joy and sense of connection my wife has experienced with each of the wonderful horses we have purchased from Friesian Marketplace.\n\nBoth Cheryl and Kelsey are tremendous trainers and exemplify the professionalism and care that is required to prepare these wonderful animals for ridership - and connecting both animal and person with such perfect alignment.\n\nWe have purchased 3 wonderful horses from them and the joy the riding experience has brought to my wife has been nothing less than spectacular.\n\nThank you Friesian Marketplace for finding the perfect horse for my wife. It has brought her so much joy and adventure in her life.\n\nGratefully,\n\nRobb in SC\n\nPhoenix is such a terrific boy! He is all settled into his new home. He loves watching the horses in the arena through one of his stall windows. He is getting training 5 days a week and doing fantastic! He takes everything and everyone in stride. If there is a ‘bombproof’ horse; Phoenix is IT. He is smart, gentle, and loves food lol. He is a dream come true and everything you said and more!\n\nI have pics coming soon. Oh, and my 24 year old daughter had gone from scared to touch a horse to grooming and bathing him and has had two lessons.\n\nI could write a book about the attributes of this precious boy and how great you guys are! I see why people able to do so buy multiple horses from you!\n\nMary Anna in Texas\n\nKelsey and Cheryl,\n\nIt's been almost five months, I can't thank you enough for matching me with my incredible boy, Ytsen Z. You made the buying process so simple and were always incredibly responsive and so gracious to answer what probably seemed like hundreds of my questions. Being my first horse purchase, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I never anticipated an experience as exceptional as Friesian Marketplace. You immediately made me feel at ease like you were long-time friends who wanted to help me find the right match rather than trying to sell me a horse. Every horse I met that day was incredible, but we all knew Mr. Ytsen was my perfect match. He has brought so much joy and laughter into my life with his big personality and silly antics.\n\nWe attended our first-ever dressage show this weekend and won the all-around championship in our division and had a great time.\n\nYou guys made my dreams come true and I will be forever grateful. I will be back when I'm ready for my second friesian.\n\nThank you,\n\nKelly Hammett\n\nI am reaching out to thank you for making this experience wonderful in every aspect. Cheryl and Kelsey went out of their way to make sure my family and I had everything we needed to care for and manage our first Frisian horse. We were touched that you regularly checked in on Adel and gave so much support throughout this process.\n\nCheryl and Kelsey go above and beyond, and it does not go unrecognized. I was so appreciative of the training that was provided. They were super patient and encouraging to my daughter. You truly have a gift for matching people with their perfect horse.\n\nAdel is so special and has already brought so much happiness to my family. We are looking forward to all the wonderful memories we will make, thanks to Cheryl and Kelsey!\n\nCasey in NC\n\nHi Cheryl and Kelsey,\n\nI wanted both of you to know how well Xander is doing. He is my true HEART horse. I never dreamed I would be able to find my perfect horse, but with your expertise and help I did. He was everything you said he was. The description of his training and behavior was spot on. The videos of his training completely and honestly represented what is level of training was. I think he’s even better than what you said. He is amazing!! Everything with his purchase went smoothly, you made sure of that. The pre-purchase exam done in the Netherlands was complete and exceptionally well done. I say this because my husband is a veterinarian. You also made sure his teeth were floated, new shoes put on, booster vaccines and new veterinary exam done for insurance purposes. A complete package of Care. Xander’s travel to my farm was seamless thanks to the arrangements you secured for him. He came newly groomed and with a care package to boot. LOVE THE SHIRT!!\n\nThen that’s not all. When I needed help with training and grooming questions you never hesitated to help me (I called a lot). Your kindness will never be forgotten. What more could anyone want. My next horse will come from you. Thanks so much.\n\nJean in PA\n\nHi Cheryl and Kelsey!\n\nI just wanted to reach out to say thank you. I never thought my dream would come true, and you two made it happen.\n\nTeddy is literally the best. I know that I came out to look at a different boy and my experience with the two of you was amazing. I felt I had known you for years and felt so at ease. I could tell that both of you are focused on matching people with the right horse and care so much about all of these wonderful animals. Your facility is beautiful and all of the horses are so well cared for. When you brought Teddy out after I tried my initial pick, I was instantly in love and knew he was the one for me.\n\nYou both made the process of purchasing a horse across the country stress free and easy. You got us matched with a great shipping service and prepared me for all the supplies, feed, etc I would need.\n\nMost importantly, you found me my best friend. I have known and had many horses in my life, but Teddy is truly special. He is always looking to learn and please and has the biggest heart. We went on our first trail ride today and he was a super star. I think he has created his own fan club at the barn as he is so personable and always looking for attention.\n\nThank you both, I will keep you updated on our adventures and I hope to have the pleasure to purchase Teddy a friend from you in the future.\n\nErica and Teddy\n\nHi Kelsey, it’s Jill DeGrave. Just wanted to let you know how Finn is doing. He is so awesome and everything I have dreamed of. I am blessed beyond belief and mighty grateful! He is maturing so well and has really boosted my confidence. We are progressing beautifully. I adore him! Thanks again for connecting me to this beautiful boy!\n\nJill in Wisconsin\n\nDear Cheryl and Kelsey,\n\nThank you so much for knowing that Lucky was the Friesian for me. I had looked on your website for several years and wanted my own Friesian. I finally decided that I was not getting any younger and I remember the day I picked up the phone to see if I could fly out to see your horses. After meeting with you both, I felt like we had been friends forever. Your horses are magnificent and you were so helpful and knowledgeable in finding the perfect match for me. I know you got so tired of my endless questions, but you never let on and graciously answered everyone. Lucky makes my heart beat faster every morning when I go out to feed. He lets out the sweetest nicker as I head toward him. He is waiting just for me! There are not words to thank you both. He is my dream horse. I so highly recommend FMP for anyone looking for their special Friesian.\n\nPhyllis in Texas\n\nHi Cheryl and Kelsey,\n\nWanted to update you on Bella - she is doing great and has settled in well. We absolutely love her as does everyone else in the barn. We took her to her first show this weekend to get her some experience and she was the center of attention. It was so fun to take her to the show. If people weren't asking about her they were staring at her. She was just magnificent. She was first and second in the two events she participated in.\n\nChad in NC\n\nHello. I bought the most wonderful Friesian from Cheryl at Friesian Marketplace. I could not travel out there to see him first. So I was a bit nervous about it until I called sharing my concerns. I’m almost 60 and haven’t ridden since childhood thru very young adult. But Cheryl and her daughter walked me thru it, they took all the time I needed and numerous calls, and they kept the horse their in training until they were sure he would be all I had hoped for!!! And oh my GOSH, is he ever!!! I wish I would have called them the first time I bought an imported Friesian, from a very well advertised competitor, but all’s well that ends well!! God Bless Cheryl and her wonderful daughter!! I HAVE MY DREAM HORSE!!!\n\nTricia in California\n\nAfter 40 years since owning a horse I started doing some searches online and discovered Friesian Marketplace and it's wonderful owners Cheryl and Kelsey (mom and daughter team). After watching videos of Kelsey riding Guinness I knew he had to be mine.\n\nLike many people I was wary and nervous about buying a horse from someone I had never met and located several states away from Pennsylvania. What kind of experience would it be? Well I can tell you now, it was a wonderful experience. After numerous phone conversations with Cheryl, my husband and I decided to take the ten hour drive from Easton, Pa to Greer, SC. We were greeted at the most lovely home and horse farm by Cheryl and Kelsey. We immediately felt comfortable and it was evident that these were people who loved what they did and truly cared about matching the right horse with the right owner.\n\nAfter watching Kelsey put Guinness through a short workout I got a chance to ride him and fell instantly in love. In addition to buying a beautiful horse Cheryl and Kelsey have a nicely stocked tack store that I was able to stock up on some items I would need when Guinness was shipped to Pennsylvania. Friesian Marketplace made all of the arrangements to trailer Guinness up to Pennsylvania with Gerard Horse Taxi. Jerry, Michael and Ellen (parents and son) could not have been nicer. Jerry and Michael treated Guinness like their own horse, stopping along the way to spend time with Guinness and make sure he was doing ok. The transport of Guinness went off without a hitch. As I look back at the whole experience from start to finish I can’t imagine how it could be any better. I continue to communicate with Cheryl and Kelsey to let them know how things are going. If you are looking for a Friesian, Friesian Marketplace is the place to start. You won't look any further!! Five stars in my book!\n\nAudria in PA\n\nI'd like to express my gratitude for the opportunity to purchase once again from Friesian MarketPlace. This is my 3rd Friesian, that I have had the pleasure of owning. After buying my first one on my own, which took me \"years\" to finally find the one. After losing my first one tragically, I was completely devastated and broken. A friend highly recommended FMP, because Cheryl and Kelsey are very knowledgeable and the best in their abilities to match horses with riders. I was so thankful for their expertise in finding my 2nd Friesian The match was perfect. The process of purchasing Uzes was smooth and easy. The bond and the relationship with Uzes is a dream come true. Uzes healed my broken heart and our bond is strong.\n\nI had often considered getting another Friesian but never really pursued seeking one. I have stayed in close contact with Cheryl and Kelsey over the past couple of years.\n\nI noticed this particular Gelding they had for sale and when I read about him I recognized he was from the same breeding program that my Uzes came from in Holland. He caught my eye and I thought whoever purchases him will be one very lucky person.\n\nWell it was a couple months later and I got a phone call from the lovely ladies at FMP, they told me about this special horse and knowing me as they do, they both said I would be the perfect fit.\n\nWe ranch and raise Red Angus cattle. We also raise cow bred horses and enjoy the tradition of using horses on the ranch (including the Friesians). Hearing all the good things and the genuine love of this horse Cheryl and Kelsey shared with me. I asked,\"This horse wouldn't be the one Named Geert from the Holland breeders Uzes came from?\" Indeed it was Geert!\n\nWe agreed to purchase him sight unseen as I completely trust FMP. Geert did not disappoint!! Geert is everything they said he would be and more. It did not take but a moment to fall madly in love with him. He has been a wonderful addition to our ranch. Uzes and Geert live together and are best friends. Geert has a very special kind soul and very affectionate personality. He loves to show off his stunning beauty to the camera. He really knows how to pose and loves the attention. I cannot thank the ladies of Friesian Marketplace enough for giving us the opportunity to own both our boys. Uzes and Geert love the ranch life and wide open spaces.\n\nIf you are considering getting your own Fairy Tale Friesian I highly recommend none other than FMP. They know the breed and they have been doing this for a long time. Cheryl and Kelsey are very professional and compassionate people that have become such good life long friends of ours. I believe 100% they are the best and I would choose them every time! You won't find better service, professionalism, and honesty anywhere. FMP makes dreams come true!!!! Thank you so much Cheryl and Kesely we love our boys and the joy they bring to our lives.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChristene and Landon Arnold\n\nOwanka, South Dakota\n\nArrow5 Ranches\n\n“He scored 65 today. Proud of this handsome guy. He such a people pleaser. You really matched us perfectly!! I get compliments on him all the time.”- Julie\n\nJulie in Florida\n\nHey Kelsey,\n\nI just wanted to share my backstory of why I needed a new show partner and I’m going to start with early 2020. A year ago this February, I had to retire my childhood horse and constant show companion, Eëf who happens to be my very first Friesian who also is one of the sons of Sape 381. This was devastating for me as he was my only dressage partner and I was searching for my next partner BEFORE any of this happened and we found nothing. Not only did Eef retire from showing, my family suffered a huge loss when my godfather and fellow Deacon up in Brockport, NY passed away unexpectedly. That was the biggest hole in my heart that made me feel like anything I did was impossible. Fast forward to 1/17/2021 (or around that date or before) my trainer saw Deacon (aka Aiko) on the website and decided to see him instead of the other 2 we originally thought about looking... and I’m glad we did. When I met Deacon, I knew in my heart that he was the one who was meant for me. I rode him twice and I fell in love with him, my trainer rode him and she fell in love with him too. My mom saw the spark that I lost last year, come back and I felt in my heart that my godfather was telling me that he was the one. Now that I have this sweet and gentle soul named Deacon, I am excited for shows and ready to go in the ring with this boy at my side. Thank you to Cheryl and Kelsey for all they did and for everything they did for my boy. He is loved by all of our boarders here at our facility and spoiled by my parents. I fall in love with him every single day! I can’t believe he’s home. Thank you both for all your help and for bringing him here so I could find him. :) love to you and your families!! God bless!\n\nDominique “Nikki” Anneliese Haber\n\nCo-Owner and Assistant Manager at Hill Of Dreams Equestrian Center, LLC\n\nHi Cheryl and Kelsey,\n\nThis note is long overdue...wanted to let you know that since Voltaire (Remco) came to us last year, he just keeps amazing us more and more every day! Words aren't enough to describe how absolutely wonderful he is! Not only does he have such a presence about him, he has the best personality, absolutely loves to work, takes your breath away when he moves, but most importantly of all, he takes amazing care of his girls! He will fly with you one minute, but stops the moment he feels you are even slightly off balance. He and Bella are an absolutely perfect match in the show ring, and can't wait for next season! He was a perfect gentleman during this photo shoot, posing and humoring us for some amazing senior pictures. He did not waiver for even one moment, because he knew thats what we were asking of him that day, and he just so wants to please. He truly is incredible, in so many ways, such a special horse, and we are head over heels in love with him. We love our FMP boys, and are so thankful for the absolute joy you have helped us find with them, and are also beyond blessed for finding you, such very special friends of a lifetime, in the process. Sending Love and Hugs, ❤️🥰\n\nPetra and Bella\n\nAfter riding my big boy (Webster) yesterday it occurred to me how much I appreciate my Friesian and the detail Cheryl and Kelsey of Friesian Marketplace went to getting me the right horse. The previous year my wife bought her “horse of a lifetime”, Ynze and he was so much better than advertised. My wife encouraged me to “invest” in a Friesian for me, so we went to Friesian Marketplace a couple of times before we found Webster. The transparency they provided to give the horses’ backgrounds, talents, health etc. was outstanding – which is not always the case in the world of “horse trading”. But what makes Friesian Marketplace even more special is their continued support and willingness to answer questions. She provides a wealth information for ongoing care. Friesian Marketplace is a quality business run by quality ladies providing quality horses. I highly recommend this business.\n\nDavid in TN\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nWe recently bought an adorable Gypsy Vanner from Kelsey for use as a reliable guest horse for our farm. Kelsey was extremely professional throughout the process and really took the time to make sure that this horse suited our needs. From start to finish, she responded promptly, provided all the information we requested, allowed us as much time as necessary to make a decision and checked back with us after the sale to make sure our little horse was working out well. In addition, her barn and property are immaculate and the horses she has in her care receive the best treatment. I highly recommend Friesian Marketplace and plan to go back to Kelsey when I am ready to purchase the Friesian I have always dreamed of owning.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLise Revers\n\nOwner\n\nBeechwood Stables\n\nProof that hope springs eternal! Meet Amadeus, my new dressage partner. He is a 5 yr old Friesian who is a real sweetheart! Thanks to Cheryl and Kelsey at Friesian Marketplace for matching us up and making the process so incredibly painless. It has been, and continues to be a pleasure to deal with them.\n\nUpdate:\n\n“P.S. I adore him and things are going so well. This is the point where you are usually crying your eyes out going – what have I done. Instead I am asking – why didn’t I do this sooner!”\n\nUPDATE! Amadeus continues to do really well. I am very happy with him and everyone seems to love him as much as I do. His trainer, the vets and farrier all have given him rave reviews as has the barn staff. Just such a good boy! This is the three month anniversary of his arrival and all the support you provided early on – which has been closely followed BTW – has made caring for him as easy as riding him. He is beyond a pleasure to work with – so well mannered. Easy is the main word but he is also talented, fun, and just so darn likeable! When I look back (and I did!) it was almost shocking to see how quickly it all came together. I hadn’t really been looking for a Friesian but called you based on my friend’s recommendation. I am both amazed and grateful that I picked up the phone for that first call. It was less than five days from our first call to a purchase contract – and that was in the middle of a pandemic! And both Jonelle and I LOVE the saddle – it has been perfect to ride in and so many people have complimented me on it.\n\nSusan in Chicago\n\nI purchased a beautiful Friesian gelding from Friesian Marketplace 4 years ago. It was the best experience I have ever had in the horse world. Cheryl and Kelsey are very knowledgeable about this breed and guided me carefully through the process of purchasing and owning one. They asked me to send them a list of specifications for my new Friesian. My number one requirement was a safe horse with a good mind. Because Friesian Marketplace specializes in these traits, they were able to find me the perfect partner. They carefully took care of every detail from the initial contract to shipping across the country. They explained his diet, grooming, and made tack suggestions. They even measured him for me so I could order him blankets. Cheryl took photos of him as he was loaded on the trailer and checked in every day until they knew that he was safe and sound in his new home in Colorado. They continue to be just a phone call away. You will not find better customer service. Four years later, my horse is healthy, smart, kind and incredibly safe. He is my heart horse. I would have never found him on my own. He is the best money I have ever spent. I highly recommend Friesian Marketplace and would not hesitate to purchase another horse from them.\n\nFelicia in CO\n\nKelsey, Kingsley is doing awesome! He will be showing Dressage for 2021 and I can't wait to get in the ring with him. He is such a GREAT horse! Huge thanks to you and your mother for finding him and selling him to us!!\n\nAlexis in Ohio\n\nHe’s perfect! A huge thank you to Cheryl and Kelsey!\n\nKami in Oklahoma\n\nI usually never write reviews; however, Cheryl and Kelsey have exceeded my expectations on finding the perfect Friesian horse for me. I do want to say that originally I was looking at a horse at their place that was much more expensive BUT they said that horse would not meet my specifications. I truly love how they weren’t just trying to sell me the most expensive horse. They are honest and VERY helpful. If you’re looking for a Friesian horse, you need to talk to Cheryl and Kelsey! I couldn’t be more happy with Zeger! Thank you Cheryl and Kelsey!\n\nLou in Georgia\n\nThought Herbie and I would send you a little shout out. Life from between Herbie’s ears is going great! I snapped this pic as we were checking pastures today. He is so much fun! He is my bestie! ️\n\nXO, Amy and Herbie\n\nHere is an update from our sweet Thomas with his new family in Washington!\n\nWell as you can see my granddaughter and Thomas are quite the item - every horse should have a 5 year old girl in love with him !!! We are doing WELL !!! Dawn and I are starting English lessons today - so excited - and will be good for Thomas/Covid to keep him tuned - our neighbor happens to be a well trained Dressage rider/trainer so we will definitely improve our riding skills!! FYI we renamed him Covid - as the best thing to happen to us this year !! We cannot tell you enough how much he is the perfect horse for us - we love him so much - and he gets so much attention - sometimes we just hang with him in the field - we need to get a picture of the three of us grooming him and loving/smooching on him - he has girls hands and kisses all over him - he just stands there so patiently - you were right - he would stand all day long to be groomed - no fidgeting or anything - pure joy !!!\n\n\"It’s been a year for Uzes and I. Oh the adventures we have had and so many more to come! He is admired everywhere we go! He has a puppy dog disposition, wants to be friends with every kind of animal. He adores me as I adore him. He looks for me and calls to me with his deep loud whinny ! I am so happy with my boy he is so much fun. He has amazing endurance and is so very brave. Thank you so much for helping us become one! I love him with all my heart.\"\n\nChristene in South Dakota\n\nDear Kelsey and Cheryl, I can’t say enough about Friesian Marketplace since Cheryl and Kelsey made my dream of owning a beautiful, talented Friesian come true. From start to finish, every single step in planning for the perfect horse, meeting him and bringing him home was so easy and pleasant. Cheryl took care to really listen to what I wanted in a horse and waited to contact me until she found my perfect match. The moment I saw Tukker I was absolutely in love with him. He is sweet, trustworthy, hardworking, and is truly the ideal horse for me to accomplish all of my riding goals and to have a companion for many years to come. I will be forever grateful to Friesian Marketplace for making my dream of owning a true beauty of a Friesian come true.\n\nYours,\n\nNicole in Ohio\n\nWe love hearing from our sweet clients! Here is a an update from Paige who purchased this sweet girl from us 2 years ago! \"I have exciting news!! Nala and I attended our first ever show this morning and we got 1st and 2nd place!! She was such a good girl and I am so so proud of her! I wanted to share our accomplishment with you!! 😁❤️\"\n\nHi Kelsey and Cheryl,\n\nI just wanted to let you know that Faith has settled in beautifully and I am enjoying her so much! She is patient and yet has a perfect amount of energy. I was very grateful that Kelsey took the time and wanted to talk with me directly about Faith. It was scary purchasing sight unseen - but she was just as Kelsey described.\n\nI wish I had current pictures to send, but we have limited people at the barn right now.\n\nFaith is such a beautiful and sweet mare and I couldn’t be happier with her. Thank you also for sending the rose gold bridle so quickly. It’s such a nice quality leather and looks just stunning on my girl. She does great with the bit that you sent for her also.\n\nYou were both wonderful to work with and I am so grateful for everything!\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nJacque from Washington\n\nDear Kelsey and Cheryl, I’m happy to give you an update on Finn (Hugo). I am so delighted that this big, beautiful boy came into my life! We are getting to know each other more each day and I am loving him so much! Working with you both was an absolute pleasure. You attended to every detail so professionally. Thank you so much for your efforts to make my dream come true! I’ll be sure to give you regular updates in the future.\n\nThank you!\n\nJill\n\nHi Kelsey and Cheryl:\n\nI write to \"thank you\" for the amazing opportunity to own Caspian. I am calling him by his registered name, Fabe, and he is perfect for me. I have worked hard my whole life growing my own business and, while I have always owned horses, I have never owned one of this caliber. When I saw your post on Fabe, I knew I had to have him. I drove out and tried him and the moment I sat on him, I knew what a quality horse he was. I decided to buy him on the spot.\n\nHis temperament is fabulous, just as you represented. I am lucky enough to have him with me at our small farm and he seems to enjoy living out with my other animals. I entered him in our first dressage show and he won first place in both classes. I had not won first place in a class since my college days. The judge loved him and gave him an 8 for his gaits. I know he will score even higher next time because my confidence with him increases every day and I won't hold back on his great expressive movement next time.\n\nThis is the horse of my dreams and I love him so very much. He was worth every penny I paid for him x 100. I highly recommend Friesian Marketplace for anyone looking to buy their dream horse.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nElizabeth in South Carolina\n\nWe are pleased to write a testimonial concerning the purchase of our beloved Friesian, Thomas. Firstly, the people we have dealt with every single step of the way have been exemplary in their customer service. Cheryl and Kelsey are amazing and spent a significant amount of time with us talking and answering questions and sending us pictures. Their assistance with the purchase, tack, insurance and transport was made very simple and stress free. Anyone purchasing a Friesian will be well served with Friesian Market Place as they have the best service and very well vetted horses!\n\nThomas is the perfect fit for our family! We discussed with Cheryl extensively what we were looking for, how we would use and treat our new horse - and we could not have ended up with a more perfect fit. Thomas is loving, trustworthy, calm and steady - not to mention absolutely stunning in appearance ! He allows the youngest family member - a five year old girl to lead him and lowers his giant head to let her pet him and kiss him anytime she wants - which is several times a day ! He is a pleasure to ride English or Western and he even drives ! He is extremely well trained and his personality is exactly how Cheryl and Kelsey described - no surprises at all. He is settling in nicely to the forests and trails of the PNW and is a pure joy to be around. We could not love him more and every day he shows us more reasons to be thrilled he came into our lives. We simply cannot say enough about this fantastic fella!\n\nThank you Cheryl and Kelsey for your assistance and continued support - forever thankful for your help in guiding up to Thomas. He simply could not be more loved and well fitted for our family.\n\nColleen and Dawn in Washington\n\nThank you FMP for matching us with our boys. We have had an amazing experience with you from the very beginning. The entire process was very seamless from the paper work to bringing them home.\n\nYour followups have been very helpful and it shows how much you care. Our entire family is in love with them; and of course we are loving riding Grutske (Zorro) and Abe.\n\nI highly recommend you to anyone in the market for their perfect Friesian.\n\nYanira and Joel in Florida\n\nHello, I purchased Onyx (Blackie) from you guys. I just wanted to say thank you so much for everything. I absolutely love this guy. He has been beyond amazing and has helped me regain my confidence in a very short period of time. We showed in my first ever dressage show today.. something that I would have never had the confidence to do before. We didn't win but he was a complete rock star and handled everything like a pro. You guys are truly amazing at what you do. Will definitely be a return customer.\n\nAmber in GA\n\nThank you Cheryl and Kelsey for making my dream come true. The first time I talked to Cheryl, the owner of a Friesian marketplace, she explained the process of buying their friesians. Friesian Marketplace selects their horses after a meticulous process. The horses have to have good bloodlines, pass very strict pre-purchase exams and have a good mind and conformation. After selecting and buying the horses, Friesian Marketplace imports the horses. When the horses arrive to their property they start adapting to new hay, new forage, new grain, new climate... Friesian Market place takes all those risks, making the buying experience and transition easy for both horses and riders. I was amazed with the transparency of their business. They are very honest people and a beautiful hardworking family. Everything Cheryl said was absolutely correct. Riding Sven Ster for the first time, in their property, was a dream come true! I could not stop smiling. He was a charm and so talented. Cheryl was so happy to find another perfect match, she got goosebumps and her eyes watered! He was absolutely meant to be part of my life.\n\nSven Ster arrived a week later to his new home in Florida. Cheryl arranged the transportation and he arrived perfectly. Kelsey has been guiding me day by day so Sven easily adapts to his new home. Sven is so gentle, curious, and loving. Our first ride was amazing, he was attentive, pleasing, responsive, focused, powerful yet relaxed! He is an amazing horse all around! I have no words to describe how amazing I feel with Sven, and I have no words to express my gratitude with Cheryl and Kelsey for matching us and making this process an absolute delight. After knowing them I would not consider buying a Friesian anywhere else. Love you girls!\n\nTuly in Florida\n\nThis testimonial has been very difficult for me to write. No matter what words I try to put together they just don’t seem to be powerful enough to express how happy my heart has been since “Archie” my Friesian Marketplace horse came into my life. “Bruno” as we call him has not taken a wrong step since the day he was delivered. He is absolutely AMAZING and has exceeded all my expectations. He is smart , kind , honest, impeccably trained and stunningly beautiful . He is the most fun horse I have ever rode. He can perform high level dressage movements one day and pack you down the the trail the next. On top of all this my 10 year old daughter can safely ride him too!! Bruno is so happy to take care of his little girl and teach her what he knows. Watching them just melts my heart . Thank you Cheryl and Kelsey! I am so very blessed !!! My experience with you has been no less than professional, caring, helpful, accommodating and rewarding from start to finish. There is for sure another FMP horse in my future. Thanks again!\n\nMy trainer (who traveled to see him) “He’s special buy him !”\n\nMy current coach “He’s a Gem”\n\nMy husband “Be aware there will be a lot of jealous people”.\n\nMy vet “ Where did you find him ? I need to know”\n\nMy daughter “I just want to squeeze him, I just can’t take it he’s so cute and Wow, he is so fun to ride”\n\nRandom people “ He is magnificent” “What a prince” “Such a sweet guy” “Wow”\n\nWe need to clone Archie!!! My 17 year old daughter , who stopped riding because of an accident on one - she loves Archie decided to ride him today , she had so much fun she wants to start riding again . this horse is such a blessing to our family ! I’m starting to save up , we will need another one!\n\nMeridith in CT\n\nAfter trying to familiarize myself with Friesian’s and doing lots of research on my own I thought I knew the key questions to ask. I had followed the Friesian Marketplace page for a long time and finally reached out. I spoke to Kelsey online and over the phone, not only did she answer every question I had, but also encouraged me to come down and see the horses in person. I couldn’t be happier that I did!\n\nFast forward to the day I went to look at the horses, they provided me a list of good places to stay and were so accommodating. I’ve been in horses all my life but had never had a Friesian. From top to bottom I feel fully prepared for every inch of Friesian care! Tried and true products and I was able to buy a saddle directly from them. It has an adjustable tree so it fits my boy perfectly!\n\nThe horse I bought and i couldn’t be more perfectly matched! He is a total dream come true!! I never once felt pressured to buy a certain horse, like I had at other farms. From start to finish the process was so smooth and easy! Cheryl and Kelsey stand behind their horses 100% they take the time to really learn who each horse is. I fall more in love with Sierd every day and I couldn’t imagine buying a Friesian from anyone else!\n\nThanks again,\n\nMargo in Ohio\n\nI had a fantastic experience with Friesian Market Place. This was our first horse so we had lots of questions. Cheryl and Kelsey were so patient and kind, answering all my questions and spend lots of time on the phone going over everything and making sure I had all the information I needed. The entire experience from pre purchase to Gabriel’s arrival was wonderful. Even the shipping company they use, sent me pictures and text updates durning his trip. After Gabriel arrived they were quick to answer questions and gave advice regarding how best to help him settle in. It is very clear they love their horses and are excited to follow them in their new homes. I cannot recommend them highly enough. Gabriel has been everything they said he was. He is so perfect for our family and we want to thank Kelsey and Cheryl for making the perfect match!\n\nEmily in Maine\n\nFriesian Marketplace sold me my first Friesian. They took amazing care of finding me the most amazing Friesian.. Caleb! He is a jaw dropping beauty! His heart is solid gold! Caleb is so wonderful to show and just kind beyond words. I thank you Cheryl and your beautiful daughter for taking such care of me and your amazing professionalism!! When I realized I was ready for a second one they once again took their time and much care to make sure to find the perfect match for me. Once again now King Arthur will be arriving this Friday!! I can’t thank you enough for all you do! You have changed my life!!!\n\nJocelyn in New York\n\nKelsey and Cheryl. THANK YOU so much for my beautiful girl! I'm just over the moon with her. She is everything you said she was, kind, sweet, good natured, funny, talented and of course, gorgeous!❤🥰 And, it was so great working with you guys! Friends, if you're looking for your fantasy Friesian, look no further. Not only are Kelsey and Cheryl very knowledgable, but they are kind, patient and so so accommodating. They will answer all your questions, work with your timeline and when the transfer finally takes place, they will go beyond the beyonds to make it smooth, efficient AND even pleasurable!! ❤❤ Whether you're experienced with Friesians, or a newcomer to our beloved Black Pearls, they will get you matched perfectly to your Dream! I cannot say enough good things! 🐎🐎🐎\n\nPaula in South Dakota\n\nWell I’m still pinching myself but...I can finally let the cat out of the bag!! Welcome to the family Sierd K. Many many adventures ahead!! Thank you Friesian Marketplace, Kelsey Baird, and Cheryl Baird for the most amazing time and for finding this incredible horse!! Fairytale dreamboat horse doesn’t even begin to describe him!!💕\n\nMargo in Ohio I have admired Kelsey and Cheryl at Friesian Marketplace for a very long time. I had said to my friends before that if I was ever in the market for another Friesian I’d love to go through them. That time came sadly after I lost my first Friesian. I was scared to death to do it again but I love the breed so much I knew I needed to do it again. So I reached out and set up a date to come see them. When I arrived at FMP they made me feel welcomed right away. I was nervous, but not for long. I could have stayed there all day. I mean who wouldn’t want to be in their barn full of Friesians all day. I tried 3 boys that day and needed to think and sleep on it. They gave me the time I needed and did not rush me at all. I loved Mats and went back a few days later to try him again. They were really great working with my schedule. Of course I was in love with Mats the first day so the second ride sealed the deal. They made the purchasing extremely smooth and are very quick to respond at any time. I even called Cheryl in a panic the evening that Mats was supposed to leave heading home because it was going to be really cold that night and Mats had a light coat, Cheryl said no worries I’ve got you covered. She grabbed a stable sheet they had and let him wear it home so he wouldn’t get to chilly. Now that’s service! Even now after time has gone by I can and have called them for guidance or questions and they help right away. My boy is everything they said he was and more. I couldn’t be happier. I highly recommend going to see them if your in the market for a fantastic Friesian horse. They know what they are doing. Oh yeah, they have awesome tack and other products too!\n\nTeresa in Texas “We owe you two, Cheryl and Kelsey the biggest THANK YOU!! When my husband, David, and I started looking at Friesians, we must of looked at hundreds of horses online. We had done our research enough to learn that the best Friesians come from the Netherlands and so found a horse we were in the process of vetting when I came across Friesian Marketplace. I got excited about Ryker off your website. He was such a gorgeous, beautifully moving, long haired gelding and I immediately sent off an email for more information. It was the smartest thing I did as you immediately replied and encouraged us to come to your barn to experience the Friesian horse in person. I quickly discovered what a wealth of information you are regarding this breed. Truth is I didn’t know what I didn’t know! I’m so grateful that you said we really needed to drive to South Carolina to see you and your horses. You both, Cheryl and Kelsey, took the time to teach us about the uniqueness of each of the horses, were patient with our many questions and I got to ride again after 20 years with both of you at my side guiding and encouraging me. We had fallen in love with our Ryker (now named Zohar) and he is everything I had hoped for, such a special boy. Looking back I can’t imaging buying a Friesian without you two. You saved us from making a potentially very expensive mistake. Feel free to use me as a reference. David and I so appreciate all you did for us. Again, thank you so much. Diane and David “ We will definitely be in touch. We’re so excited about this, David is looking at farms. You may see us again:).\n\nDiane in GA\n\nHi Cheryl and Kelsey,\n\nI finally have time to send a note to you to tell you about how happy I am that I bought Eli from Friesian Marketplace. I have had him for almost three months now and he is still amazing! Thank you for being there that day you answered the phone when I flew from Victoria, BC Canada to North Carolina USA when I was told that the horse I was going to see was lame. The flight tickets the hotel fees, the time change.... I did not know what to do. Luckily my friend Kim to the rescue! She found your site and we were so happy to find out that Greer was such a short distance from where we were in Asheville. I told you my situation and you made it possible to come see your magnificent Friesian horses the next day. I was like a kid in a candy shop. You and Kelsey listened so well and knew what I was looking for and we found him. The perfect match. Eli (Sipke) The horse of my dreams! Not too tall, I requested, must have an amateur friendly exceptional temperament and also passed such a thorough vet check with flying colors. You made things so easy. The shipping, the border crossing and vet inspection, to name a few and all before Christmas, went so smoothly. You welcomed us into your home and we visited your tack shop. All perfect. All professional. Thank you so much. I will never forget how you made buying a horse so easy. There were no red flags. Thank you for being honest horse people. I am having so much fun with Eli getting ready for some local shows and clinics. He has already been noticed and celebrated in the community. He is definitely admired by all who meet him. He makes riding fun again. I am so grateful. Please come visit anytime you travel out west. Hoping I can welcome you as warmly.\n\nSuzie in Canada I really enjoyed reading these testimonials while waiting for Thor (now Nero) to arrive, & thought I’d contribute now that enough time has passed (over a year) to give an accurate assessment. My expectations for a seller end when they’ve provided me with what I paid for, but here are a few specific examples of ways they go above & beyond:\n\n•There’s no endless nickel-&-diming once you’ve paid the purchase price (farrier bill, pro-rated board, training fees, vaccines, the halter they came in, etc.)\n\n•They arrange the transportation, quote accurately an estimate of what you’ll pay for your location, & the haulers they use do a good job for a reasonable rate\n\n•Assistance with the association membership, transfer of ownership, & insurance processes\n\n•Both Cheryl & her daughter Kelsey are available to speak with by phone or email to answer questions & pass on valuable tips\n\n•No saddle of mine would’ve fit, so I wound up purchasing some tack as well (dressage saddle, shim pad, girth). Arrived in good condition, well-made, very comfortable, & fits (us both) well.\n\nIf the buying experience was an unexpected pleasure, the horse is even better. He showed up around midnight after several days’ trailering from South Carolina to Oregon’s Willamette Valley. When the hauler walked him out of the dark into the outdoor floodlights & I saw him for the first time in person, I wondered if they’d sent me the wrong horse. Not because he didn’t look as good as his pictures, but rather even better. (They haven’t called to take him back, so I guess I got the right one after all.) Though his looks are often the first thing on which he’s complimented, he truly is prettier on the inside. My previous horses have all been hot-blooded breeds, so I really appreciate one who’s able to stop, think, & learn from new/scary things rather than turning their brain off in a panic. I’d expected the trade-off to be uncomfortable gaits & poor endurance, but 3/4 are lovely (sitting that trot will make you a better rider, or at least that’s what I tell myself), & if the conditioning takes a bit longer, decent stamina is obtainable.\n\nFor several weeks last summer, we trailered around to some of the countless amazing trail courses Oregon has to offer, & he took to it like a champ. Your riding buddies might give you some looks when you show up, like you’ve brought your town car to go off-roading, but they’ll be converts by the end. Strong enough not to need to run up steep grades, collects to creep down them without getting sloppy, height & disinclination to jump help with climbing over boulders/logs, happy to stomp around crunching through the deadfall, sure-footed even on slippery rock river beds, thick-skinned about the biting insects, big enough stride to keep up with the gaited horses, & can hardly be kept out of the water. He even had a good attitude about the undesirable surprise encounters (bolting herds of elk, mountain biking team, kayakers in the river with us, etc.) & artificial novelty obstacles. Great conditioning & a nice mental break from arena work, not that he seems to mind repetitious indoor sessions, either. It makes a big difference in any discipline when your partner has not only native talent, but great enthusiasm & work ethic. Indoor, he picks things up easily, at times ‘skipping ahead in the lesson’, be it groundwork, tricks, or under saddle. I almost regret teaching him ‘fetch’, given the range of items that aren’t ours that have been brought to me in hopes of food. As all-purpose as he’s turning out to be, I may not need another horse for quite a while, but when I do, I know I’ll be giving the Bairds a call. Thanks, ladies!\n\nMelanie in Oregon\n\nI cannot say THANK YOU enough to Cheryl and Kelsey and all the staff at Friesian Marketplace! Cheryl and Kelsey are patient and determined to find the perfect match for each client and I personally think that is the MOST important thing when finding your dream horse! We took multiple trips to visit the farm and horses at Friesian Marketplace. Cheryl and Kelsey educated us about the breed, each horse and the pro's and con's of each horse relating to us and the environment the horse would be in. They were not trying to just sell us a horse, they wanted it to be perfect! In the end we fell in love with Wander and fall more deeply for him every day! He fits in perfect to our family and our barn family! Our barn owner and everyone have just fallen in love with him!\n\nWe have owned Wander now for approximately 6 weeks. Cheryl has been available for our many questions and is happy to provide advice and guidance even after the sale! The customer service level you will receive with Friesian Marketplace is above and beyond standards you find anywhere else. They want to make sure you and the horse are both doing well and transitioning in a safe and healthy manor! They welcome you into the FMP family and love watching the relationship and bond grow with you and your horse. We are so appreciative of the journey Cheryl and Kelsey took with us to find him. Friesian Marketplace is a match making service and we will definitely be back in the future to purchase another horse from them!\n\nRobert and Jennifer - Essex Junction, Vermont\n\nIt is New Years Day which is a time to both look forward and reflect. In 2019 we bought our second Friesian from FMP- Webster, a teddy bear in a Friesian body. He arrived the day before I left for a Scotland vacation. I arrived back home only to be talked into a fox hunt “practice” the next day. Can’t believe I did that on Webster with me really knowing him well yet but it was great and we have not looked back since. It just gets better and better. Webster was everything and more that FMP promised. My wife. Talked me into the second Friesian after her 2018 purchase-her heart and soul horse. Can’t wait to see what 2020 brings to Webster and I. Today’s first ride of the year was just great! THANKS FMP!!\n\nDavid in TN\n\nMeant to be. Never in my wildest dreams did I think of ever owning a Friesian horse. I always thought they were beautiful but never thought I could ride one for dressage. I found Friesian Marketplace by accident and noticed these beautiful looking, elegant horses. After looking at the Friesian Marketplace website for about three months or so. I kept going back to this one horse called “Ares”. He was beautiful to me. I wasn’t ready to buy but just out of curiosity I emailed Cheryl and Kelsey. I took a bad fall off of a horse two years ago and knew that I needed a very specific type of horse that I would be comfortable with. I wanted a well trained, wonderful minded mount that would take care of me. Cheryl had contacted me and she truly listened to my concerns. She said that she had the perfect horse in mind. His name was Ares. The beautiful guy I kept going back to on the website. I didn’t even inquire about him. I couldn’t believe it. I went to try him. Right away he and I connected. I felt so comfortable around him. I purchased him in November before Thanksgiving. Cheryl and Kelsey made everything so uncomplicated and had everything available and answered all of my questions. It was a great experience. I’m so in love with Ares. He is truly my partner for life. It really was meant to be. We are in training for upcoming dressage shows this year. This horse knows everything and is a very kind and patient teacher. Thank you so much Cheryl and Kelsey for matching me with this truly extraordinary gentleman. He is everything and more I’ve ever dreamed of.\n\nJulie in Florida\n\nWhat a fantastic experience I had with Friesian Marketplace. Previously to connecting with Cheryl and Kelsey I had a bad experience buying a Friesian. The last seller I went to was more interested in a sale then making a the right match. I was a beginning rider and I was sold a horse I never even got on and rode. I was gun shy after that experience but still dreamed of having a Friesian. I got connected with Cheryl and Kelsey. We met and they really listened to my needs. They had horses available but not the right horse. We stayed connected while they looked for my dream horse. They never pressured me to purchase any of their existing horses but several months later called me one day all excited because they found my horse. And wow did they find the perfect horse for me. He met all our needs and was the sweetest horse ever, I called him the Golden Retriever of horses. It was such a wonderful, no pressure, listening to me, trusting relationship that moved to a friendship. They were with me every step of the way to make sure me and Apollo were set up for success. From the right tack, to helping find the right stables for me, talking with the stable owner to make sure they knew what me and Apollo needed. Cheryl and Kelsey graciously answered all my questions, there were a lot, and when I was anxious about the transition they set my mind at ease. It was a wonderful experience and I highly recommend them if you are looking to purchase a Friesian.\n\nBrenda in Georgia\n\nThank you so much for helping me find my dream horse in Armando (now Odin). He’s adjusted so well and is taking everything in stride. He’s already become a barn favorite with his flowing locks and easy, calm nature. He loves having unlimited hay, scratches on his withers and hanging with his new pal Winston in the field. He’s been a perfect fit for our family and we’re really excited to see what the future holds!\n\nJennifer in South Carolina\n\nDear Cheryl and Kelsey,\n\nYou two will forever hold a very special place in my heart for helping to make my dream a reality! You gave me the best friend I could have ever asked for! Roman is truly the sweetest most gentle and handsome boy I have ever met and each day I spend with him I have to pinch myself because it almost doesn’t feel real how perfect he is. You guys have made every aspect of purchasing my FIRST horse an absolute breeze and I truly can’t imagine having gone through anybody else. From the ease of communication, the thorough information, guidance and genuine passion they show for this incredible breed I know I will definitely be back to them in the future to grow our family. Thank you both so much!\n\nVeronica in North Carolina\n\nToday is a really special day! It’s Nala’s “gotcha day!” This year has really thrown me so many curveballs, but Nala has always been there to catch me when I fall. She’s been my best friend this whole year, and I really can’t thank you all enough for introducing me to her. She’s truly my heart horse and the most amazing partner I could have ever dreamed of. I didn’t know it was humanly possible to love something this much. I can’t wait for more adventures with her and I can’t wait to share them with you all! ❤️ The biggest thank you to Friesian Marketplace EVER for the best thing that’s ever been mine.\n\nPaige\n\nI was just telling my friend today what a wonderful experience we had meeting and then purchasing Nala. Cheryl and Kelsey are the best at what they do. I can’t recommend them enough and would definitely buy from them again. Nala is the most amazing horse with the most gentle spirit. Everyone that meets her falls in love with her. Thank you for finding my sweet girls perfect match!\n\nJulie\n\nDear Cheryl and Kelsey,\n\nI just wanted to take a moment to thank you both for my amazing boy Denali. You guys went above and beyond to help my sweet husband make this the most amazing anniversary gift ever. From matching me and Denali (even telling us No to another horse!), to helping with all of the tack and gear, to being on site with me once Denali arrived, your service was outstanding. You guys are so knowledgeable, and it is obvious how much you care for your horses and the Friesian breed. My husband and I see now how you have earned your great reputation in the Friesian community. As you predicted, Denali is settling in at his new home quite well. He is a social butterfly with the best manners and has already made many human and equine friends. He is really the star of the barn and neighbors stop by often just to see him and love on him. He has the ability to slow down when he senses a new rider but loves to work and execute all of his buttons when asked. One of the barn staff pulled me aside the other day and told me, “Lisa, you have a once-in-a-lifetime horse in Denali.” I couldn’t agree more. Thank you again for everything. You guys are the best!\n\nMuch Love, Lisa in Georgia\n\nDear Cheryl and Kelsey, This is Karen, I had the privilege of getting Ollie from you over a year ago. (Wow how time flies) I thought I would let you know we are doing great. We hope everyone at FMP are doing great too. I am sending you a few pics. Ollie is doing very well with training. He self bridles, always comes to greet me, I ride him in from the pasture bareback with only his lead, and now self trailer loads. Ollie is becoming a great partner. Thank you again for being wonderful matchmakers. Best wishes to all.\n\nWarm regards, Karen\n\nI came to know The Friesian Marketplace from A very dear friend. I met her when I bought my very first Friesian (private treaty) I fell in love with the breed after my first heart and soul horse Rocky, we trained him from halter broke to an amazing riding horse we were so deeply connected I knew his thoughts as he knew mine. Our time was cut short he passed away due to an accident the caused internal damage. I was utterly devastated and grief sick like I have never known before. My dear friend reached out to me we talked at great length she told me about her experience with FMP. She also told me about a special horse coming from Holland that she felt I must go met him. I had not thought of getting another Friesian but was open to it. My dear friend was my liaison for me in contacting FMP. I was still very emotional from my loss. Arrangements were made for us to meet this special boy shortly after he arrived at FMP. Cheryl and Kelsey were so kind and more than accommodating. They took care of everything down to every detail. Meeting Uzes was magical and emotional our first eye contact with each other was instant and powerful It was an easy choice I never looked at any other horse it’s was like he choose me. They held my hand through the whole process of the purchase and it did not stop there, they stayed in close contact with me as he made his way to our barn guiding us in his transition offering much support and kindness. They were very professional yet felt like trusted family. I would not go anywhere else to shop for a Friesian. Uzes is truly as amazing as they told me and so much more. He has helped me heal and find my happiness again. We are so very thankful for the gals of the FMP they have a gift of passion for the bred and know a brilliant horse when they find them! I would not bat an eyelash to buy another one just on their word! We came as buyers left like family. Uzes and I could not have been a better match forever grateful for the service they provide. Such a beautiful place, beautiful horses and beautiful people thank you Cheryl and Kelsey.\n\nLove Christene Arnold And family Dear Cheryl, I just wanted to thank you so much for matching us with the perfect horse for our family. We just returned from the barn where my five year old grandaughter, advanced equestrian daughter, and up in years grandpa were all having fun riding him.He is so sweet and smart that it seems he was sensing each of our skills and was intent upon protecting my grandaughter, moved very well for my daughter, and made me feel really comfortable as a senior citizen want to be cowboy.He is calm when you need him to be and spirited when you ask him to move it up a notch (or several). I also want to thank you for making our purchase so easy and pleasurable. Xander is exactly as you described him and maybe even better though I would need to learn new adjectives to indicate how remarkable he is.You were so well informed about Xander and Friesians in general and patiently answered the many questions I asked. I am looking forward to many years with our amazing horse.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBrian Schreiber, M.D.\n\nSpent the day at the barn with Xander :) he is so loved and spoiled! Everyone at the barn just loves him. He can’t get enough love from everyone! He’s taken over as the favorite of the barn. We took a mini trail ride around the barn and he was more than perfect. Then we walked around inside the barn and just hung out and continued to get to know each other. I can’t thank you enough for suggesting I take a look at him. He is everything and more than I could have asked for! My Dad is sooo happy too. I think he's surprised at how perfect he really is! Here are photos with Xander with his girls!😍😍😍\n\nRachel in Wisconsin\n\nAfter retiring my dream dressage horse of 8 years, I began the search for another special horse knowing that is it hard to find one such horse in a lifetime much less two. Being an extremely analytical person, I screened all the online ads and recommendations from friends, etc and then followed up with phone calls and visits to try horses. I had not ridden any other horse than my beloved Tali for the 8 years I have owned him. My horse age, size, body build, brain, training criteria were interspersed every other word with 'safe.'\n\nI was not specifically looking for any particular breed but the Friesian Marketplace had a horse that met my criteria on paper. After describing to Cheryl what I was looking for and the environment at my farm (lots of noisy distractions next door), she recommended Samson. After I climbed into the saddle, took the reins and circled the arena, I knew Samson was 'the one.' I felt so very safe on him. He was different in feel from my old school KWPN but a good different. He is so sweet and so smart also! He has an interesting background with show experience, galloping in the ocean and even winning a race representing his village in Friesland. And he was a 'WOW' horse. Very elegant.\n\nMy husband accompanied me on the first look and he also fell in love with Samson. My trainer said I had to be able to ride the posting trot, the sitting trot, get canter depart both leads and accomplish a flying change. Did that and more. My trainer and a friend (also owner for a Friesian Marketplace horse) went back for the 'trainer approval' visit. We discussed on the way home to Aiken and after PPE, Samson is mine!\n\nHe has settled in just fine at my farm and is very sweet and loving. The more I ride him and just hang out with him, the more I love him. We are getting used to each other under my trainer's supervision and she just loves him also. Plans are to show dressage this winter and have goals of FEI.\n\nI was very impressed with Friesian Marketplace. Cheryl, Kelsey and staff represented the Friesian breed so well and it was obvious they love the breed and the individual horses. All were beautifully turned out and cared for. The horse was exactly what he was represented to be. And the Baird's were so accomodating to my and my trainer's schedule to get up to their farm for the trial rides. Would definitely recommend them for anyone looking for a special horse.\n\nLisi in South Carolina\n\nThere are not enough ways to say thank you! Quint could not have been a more perfect choice for me! He’s tall, dark, and handsome. His mane is magnificent, his feathers float, and his sweet eyes are so kind. He looks like he walked right off the pages of a fairytale. He is the most gentle boy and loves to snuggle. He is absolutely perfect in every way for me and there is not a single thing I would change about him. He does not spook or bolt and is up for anything- he is exactly what I asked for. The Baird ladies are pretty special. They truly go above and beyond expectations. They answered my endless questions immediately with thoughtful responses. When I asked for an unedited video of Quint with a novice rider taking a lesson, they sent one within a day. When I traveled to SC to see Quint, I was treated like family. Cheryl and Kelsey made sure I was comfortable with every aspect of Quint’s performance. I never felt pressured to purchase or rushed in my deliberations. Truly, I could not have asked for a more enjoyable experience. But in addition to amazing service, the Baird ladies seem to have a special gift for matching the horse to the rider. Quint is something special and I am so thankful for Cheryl and Kelsey for finding him and matching him to me! I love those Baird ladies!\n\nRebecca in Boston\n\nHe's just so special. He's so wonderful. He just loves my daughter.. Look at that tongue!\n\nJulie in Florida\n\nHi Cheryl! I thought I'd share! My daughter turned 8 years old on the 20th and she chose a unicorn themed birthday party with all of her friends! Zanna made the perfect magical unicorn! She and all of her little friends were so thrilled to have a unicorn ride and have lunch with Zanna! We all love our beautiful girl so much!💕💕💕💕\n\nKristen in California\n\nIsabella and I Just wanted to share, had an awesome show day today! Voltaire continues to amaze us, he did so wonderful today , could not have been better....new show venue, indoor and outdoor rides, tacking up in the parking lot, he took it all in stride! He also received sooooo many compliments (including on his gorgeous FMP tack) , and he and Bella had beautiful rides, walking away with 1st places and and an all time personal best score of 78.793!!!!!

It has been 9 months since Delta Sport arrived to our barn. So much has happened! I can say now that even though I love going hacking out with him, ( I always did ), I discovered a passion for dressage. I am not the best rider but I have made such such great progress thank to my wonderful trainer that often during our lessons Delta and I are in synch, I feel his power, his precision, and I am completely connected to him.... this feeling is unbelievable!...and addictive! All this is on top of his beauty and his gentleness! Last Saturday night while out late at the barn, Aucéane filmed me scratching his ears and then I filmed her riding him...\n\nE+A\n\nDear Friesian Marketplace, Where do I even begin to give my thanks and gratitude? Your business has went above and beyond any expectations I had on purchasing my very first Friesian. Travis and I had spoken with a couple different people before taking with Cheryl at the Friesian Marketplace. Within minutes I knew Cheryl was who I wanted to purchase my first (and hopefully many more ) Friesians from. Their knowledge and love of the breed is unquestionable. Cheryl and Kelsey at Friesian Marketplace helped me find my perfect dream horse! They are true Friesian match makers! After talking with Cheryl on the phone a few times she knew before I did, that Marko was the Friesian for me. They made every step absolutely stress free and easy. Everything from pick up date, finding the perfect insurance, to meeting and riding Marko for the first time, and answering any and all of my questions and concerns. Marko has now earned his Bronze Elite Provisionally Approved Stallion status at the Friesian Sporthorse Association (FSA) inspection! I cant wait to see where this beautiful boy will take me in the future! Thank you Friesian Marketplace for making this girls dreams come true!\n\nAlisha in Iowa\n\nKelsey, is there anything this horse can’t do?? He is AMAZING. And our family loves him so very much. He’s so honest and kind. He’s not afraid of anything. He has brought our family together in the best way. He’s such a cool horse!\n\nLarkin in South Carolina\n\nThe days fly by and it’s already 1 year that Valentino arrived at my farm. I wanted to send a photo of Valentino and myself for an update on how we are doing. Thank you for making my dream come true! Cheryl and Kelsey, you both have such insight as to placing your carefully selected Friesians with their human companions! I am so grateful that I found this web sight and met you ladies! You use your passion for Friesians to transform the lives of us who want to share your passion. The sight of Valentino takes my breath away every day❣️. He is so gentle and is a perfect fit here with the rest of “my pets”! I hope that others wanting to fulfill their dream of having a beautiful Friesian will not miss the opportunity that you can provide for them. It’s been a wonderful experience! I will stay in touch!\n\nKae in Missouri\n\nSimon and Cindy checking in from Texas! Simon has settled in and has quickly become a barn favorite. There are new people telling me daily how much they love Simon; he's so handsome and has a huge personality! We love that he doesn't take himself too seriously, he's really a big puppy dog and just wants attention (and food) from his fan club.\n\nSimon is my first horse in 28 years so I was looking for THE horse. I can't say enough great things about my experience with Friesian Marketplace! I knew that I could import a horse myself but the idea of buying a horse sight unseen made me very nervous. After studying the FMP photos and videos, I knew that Cheryl and Kelsey would have the right horse for me. We flew in one day, went directly to the barn and rode then returned the next morning to ride again then flew out that day. Katie and I made our decision at the (awesome GSP) airport over Bloody Marys. Once he passed his PPE, Cheryl helped with finding a transporter to get him to Texas. (Gerard's did a great job, BTW!) If I had one complaint it would be that it was so seamless I didn't get to spend enough time at the Bairds' barn in Greer, SC.\n\nWhile we waited for the PPE and the transportation to be arranged, I knew that Simon was in great hands. When we were visiting the barn, I noticed that Cheryl and Kelsey were meticulously grooming the horses that had already been sold. It's obvious they love every horse they have in their barn.\n\nSimon's going to start his dressage show career in November, we can't wait to see how he does!\n\nCindy in Texas\n\nThank you Cheryl for finding Lonneke! We have been to 4 clinics now.. 2 dressage and 2 natural horsemanship all four trainers have fallen in love with Lonneke! We are going to our first show next month but we are just having so much fun together. She is the World’s best horse!!! I’m with her every day and she makes me so happy! She takes such great care of me! Thank you so much for finding her!! She’s perfect!!\n\nSue in Ohio\n\nFrom Kalley Krickeberg at Balanced Horse Training:\n\n“I had the pleasure of riding this beautiful imported Level 1 Friesian mare at Meadowlane Farms in Ohio...this kind mare has temperament extraordinaire. Thank you owner Sue for bringing her!”\n\nI love Traveling and seeing the Beautiful place in and out of our Country!! However This Beautiful face is oh so rewarding when I am home!! Love this Special Boy of mine!! Harley (Paulus)!! And so thankful he has Friesian Marketplace And Kelsey Baird to look after him when I am gone! They are the Absolutely best place to find your perfect Dream Horse!!♥️🐎\n\nDebby in South Carolina\n\nJelger is doing great! I love him so much and so does everyone at the barn! He is such a sweet boy. Thank you so much!\n\nMonet in NC\n\nNever in a million lifetimes would I ever thought I'd own a FRIESIAN! Welcome to the family! Marko, my very own Friesian Stallion! He's perfect in every way! A special thanks to Friesian Marketplace for making a girl's dream come true!\n\nAlisha in Iowa\n\nI have nothing but positive things to say about Cheryl and Kelsey Baird at Friesian Marketplace. From the get go they made my shopping experience with my client as accommodating and stress free as possible. Once arriving at their barn in South Carolina (15 mins from the airport!) I was pleased and relieved to see the horses were just as described to us. As a trainer, I value honesty and transparency the most when horse shopping. They know all their horses inside and out, everything was just as described. I’m also quite familiar with the Friesians, Cheryl and Kelsey have a good eye for quality and a great knowledge of the breed. It’s so fantastic to be in contact with them when they are importing such high quality horses! I highly recommend Friesian Marketplace if you are out horse shopping. Cheryl and Kelsey will take good care of you and help match you with the perfect partner.\n\nKatie in Texas\n\n“My teenage daughter and I have been taking dressage lessons on school horses for several years, and decided to take the next step to owning our own. I have looked at horses with my trainer before- and the whole process can be a bit intimidating. We knew we wanted a Friesian, and we knew from previous experiences that a horse may look great in a video ridden by a professional, but amateurs don’t always get the same response! Needless to say, we were a little nervous when we arrived at Friesian Marketplace, but were quickly put at ease with Cheryl and Kelsey’s kindness and professionalism. Cheryl listened well to the qualities that were important to us and guided us to a selection of horses that she thought would suit our needs. Kelsey showed us the skills and abilities of each horse we viewed, then so patiently coached us along as we both rode each horse. Each horse was calm and was easily rideable by us amateurs; just like Cheryl said they would be. The atmosphere was low pressure, low stress, and lots of fun. By the time we were done, my daughter and I both volunteered to work there! Each horse was high quality, calm, and willing. Cheryl and Kelsey are very knowledgeable of the breed, training, and temperament. We found a wonderful gelding at their barn! The purchase process was easy, all of my questions were answered, and he was shipped to our barn about 8 weeks ago. He is wonderful to ride and so quiet on the ground- a real sweetheart, we just love him! Thanks so much to Cheryl and Kelsey at Friesian Marketplace!”\n\nSarah in Michigan\n\nHi Kelsey! I just wanted to say hi and I hope you’re having a great day! I also wanted to give an update on Nala as a lot has changed for us the past few months. The barn we originally had her moved to when we bought her from you all ended up getting purchased to get demolished for more housing in the area, so we had to move barns, and we are now at a really nice barn that specializes in dressage and saddleseat. We have been at the new barn for almost 2 months now, and Nala is still the talk of the barn. Every time I get her out to ride or just go for a walk, people always stop me to ask about her and to pet her. We also get tons of compliments on our saddle pad and bridle from you guys! But other than that, Nala and I continue to bond each and every day. She is probably one of the sweetest, most loving horses I have ever met and she proves that to me daily. Her favorite thing is to give hugs and kisses, and she loves getting groomed and her hair done, she even falls asleep at the cross ties She is just really a special horse and she makes my heart so very happy. I am still so very grateful to you and your mom for matching us up and allowing me to call her mine. She without a doubt my heart horse Again, I hope you all are doing well, along with your current black beauties! I wish you all the very best always!\n\nPaige in Kentucky\n\nI am so very, very lucky to have found Friesian Marketplace to match Zanzibar and me up! Four years later he is letting my 1 1/2 year old granddaughter ride him! Who knew??? I love him so much! Thank you and huge hugs to Cheryl and her family!\n\nDeb in Ohio\n\nCaptain is so wonderful and sweet. We’re riding him and he so willing and completely trustworthy! Everyone oohs and aahs over him:)\n\nMorgan in Colorado\n\nDreams do come true 🖤 My very own Friesian. Words can not describe the love I have for him already. Thank you @friesianmarketplace for making this possible! —\n\nAllison in NC\n\nSuper results for Tjalke at today’s show with scores of 71.7 and 69.8. Another championship day!

Thank you again Kelsey and Cheryl Baird! 🖤\n\nJune in Virginia\n\nUpdate! Grandchildren and horses life does not get any better than that!\n\nJames in Virginia\n\nHappy Birthday Sybren! You COMPLETE me! YOU had me at hello from a photo before you shipped from the Netherlands. God told me I had to have you. It was the strongest experience for me and you were the FIRST I bought on my own instinct without my trainer. I won the lottery! Cheryl Baird - Friesian Marketplace - I drove you crazy making sure I was first to see him and to sit in him. (First time ever on a Friesian ) - I just ...knew! my heart has smiled every day I have owned him! We were a perfect match and you wouldnt have let him come my way if we weren’t. What you do at Friesian Marketplace is amazing.\n\nDawn in North Carolina\n\nHello! This is Ciara, I thought I would send an update on Kylo! We went to our first show today, a schooling show a few barns down. It was a super last minute decision to throw us in at the end of the day, so we barely had any time to prepare! Kylo cou"
