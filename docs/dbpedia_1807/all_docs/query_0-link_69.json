        "meta_description": "Abstract. Climate change affects forest growth in numerous and sometimes opposite ways, and the resulting trend is often difficult to predict for a given site. Integrating and structuring the knowledge gained from the monitoring and experimental studies into process-based models is an interesting approach to predict the response of forest ecosystems to climate change. While the first generation of models operates at stand level, one now needs spatially\nexplicit individual-based approaches in order to account for individual variability,\nlocal environment modification and tree adaptive behaviour in mixed and\nuneven-aged forests that are supposed to be more resilient under stressful\nconditions. The local environment of a tree is strongly influenced by the\nneighbouring trees, which modify the resource level through positive and\nnegative interactions with the target tree. Among other things, drought stress and vegetation period length vary with tree size and crown position within the canopy. In this paper, we describe the phenology and water balance modules\nintegrated in the tree growth model HETEROFOR (HETEROgenous FORest) and\nevaluate them on six heterogeneous sessile oak and European beech stands\nwith different levels of mixing and development stages and installed on\nvarious soil types. More precisely, we assess the ability of the model to\nreproduce key phenological processes (budburst, leaf development, yellowing\nand fall) as well as water fluxes. Two two-phase models differing regarding their response function to\ntemperature during the chilling period (optimum and sigmoid functions) and a simplified one-phase model are used to predict budburst date. The two-phase model with the optimum function is the least biased (overestimation of 2.46âd),\nwhile the one-phase model best accounts for the interannual variability\n(Pearson's r=0.68). For the leaf development, yellowing and fall,\npredictions and observations are in accordance. Regarding the water balance\nmodule, the predicted throughfall is also in close agreement with the\nmeasurements (Pearson's r=0.856; biasâ=-1.3â%), and the soil water dynamics across the year are well reproduced for all the study sites\n(Pearson's r was between 0.893 and 0.950, and bias was between â1.81 and\nâ9.33â%). The model also reproduced well the individual transpiration for\nsessile oak and European beech, with similar performances at the tree and\nstand scale (Pearson's r of 0.84â0.85 for sessile oak and 0.88â0.89\nfor European beech). The good results of the model assessment will allow us\nto use it reliably in projection studies to evaluate the impact of climate\nchange on tree growth in structurally complex stands and test various\nmanagement strategies to improve forest resilience.",

        "text": "Climate projections for the future indicate a substantial increase in air temperature all over Europe (between 1.0 and 5.5ââC, depending on the greenhouse gas emission scenario) and changes in precipitation regime according to the region (Jacob et al., 2014; Kovats et al., 2014). Climate extremes (e.g. heat waves and droughts) are also predicted to increase in intensity and frequency (Dai, 2013; Jacob et al., 2018). These changing climate conditions affect forest growth and mortality (Allen et al., 2015; Teskey et al., 2015; Charru et al., 2017; Kornhuber et al., 2019) and have an impact on the provision of ecosystem services (Hassan et al., 2005; Shvidenko et al., 2005; Rasche et al., 2013). Among these services, forests play an important role in regulating the climate system by sequestering carbon in biomass and soil (Myhre et al., 2013; Le QuÃ©rÃ© et al., 2018) and by determining water and energy exchanges with the atmosphere through their evapotranspiration and land surface properties (e.g. albedo, roughness) (Bonan, 2008; Stocker et al., 2013).\n\nSince climate change affects some tree growth processes positively and others negatively and given the interactions among factors as well as the feedback and acclimation mechanisms, it is not easy to predict the resulting effect on tree growth at a given site (Lindner et al., 2014; Herr et al., 2016). Knowledge about climate change has been acquired based on long-term monitoring studies that are limited to the observed changes (Bussotti and Pollastrini, 2017; Etzold et al., 2019) and on experiments of environment manipulation generally analysing one or two factors at a time for a limited period (Ainsworth and Long, 2005; Norby et al., 2010; Wolkovich et al., 2012; Meir et al., 2015). In order to apprehend the complex functioning of forest ecosystems, the use of process-based modelling is a complementary approach that allows the integration and structuring of the existing knowledge and extrapolations to be made for unprecedented conditions like those projected for the coming decades.\n\nProcess-based models were originally built to predict forest growth response to environmental changes at stand level without accounting for management operations and canopy heterogeneity. Such models were therefore suitable for pure even-aged stands but hardly manage to simulate mixed and structurally complex stands (DufrÃªne et al., 2005; Pretzsch et al., 2007). Yet, nowadays, a promising way to adapt forests to climate change is to progressively turn them into uneven-aged and mixed stands using continuous cover forestry and natural-disturbance-based management to improve their stress resistance and resilience (DeRose and Long, 2014; Messier et al., 2015; Anderegg et al., 2018). To account for the spatial heterogeneity, some process-based models were designed or adapted to simulate various tree cohorts (Collalti et al., 2016). However, this approach only considers the vertical dimension of spatial heterogeneity while implementing innovative forestry practices in structurally complex stands requires the horizontal dimension to be accounted for through a spatially explicit approach at tree level (Pacala and Deutschman, 1995; Pretzsch et al., 2007; Berger et al., 2008; Bravo et al., 2019).\n\nTo reproduce the complexity of forest ecosystem functioning in mixed and structured forests, models must take individual variability, local environment and tree adaptive behaviour into account (Berger et al., 2008). Tree size and species influence physiological and morphological properties that in turn affect the main growth processes (Binkley et al., 2013). Considering average individuals is therefore a rough approximation and does not allow for all the variability within a heterogeneous forest to be accounted (Berger et al., 2008). Even in cohort-based approaches, tree grouping can only be done for a limited number of criteria that are not necessarily representative of the whole tree diversity. The local environment of a tree is strongly influenced by the neighbouring trees, which modify the resource level through positive and negative interactions with the target tree (Grossiord et al., 2014). As trees compete for limited resources, neighbouring trees can decrease light, water and nutrient availability. Tree species can however develop strategies to avoid competition by using different temporal and spatial niches (complementarity; Grossiord, 2018). Positive interactions may also occur when the neighbouring trees improve the growing conditions of the target trees (facilitation; Pretzsch et al., 2013). Finally, trees adapt their morphology and physiological behaviour to the local environmental conditions by optimizing carbon allocation in order to maximize the acquisition of the limiting resource (Petritan et al., 2009; Yuang et al., 2019).\n\nAs this study focus on phenology and water cycling, we briefly review how these processes are influenced by tree characteristics and local environment. Phenology timing varies among tree species, which favours early-leafing species but can also expose them to late frosts (Lopez et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2018). Many studies report that leaf development starts earlier and leaf senescence occurs later in the understory compared to the overstorey (Gill et al., 1998; Seiwa, 1999a; Augspurger and Bartlett, 2003; Schieber, 2006; Vitasse, 2013; Gressler et al., 2015), which allows the understory trees to benefit from a longer growing period and consequently, to increase their productivity (Jolly et al., 2004). The presence of warmer temperatures in the understory is one of the hypotheses advanced to explain this difference in budburst between under- and overstorey (Augspurger and Bartlett, 2003; Schieber, 2006). Using a construction crane, VitasseÂ (2013) tested this hypothesis by transplanting seedlings of five tree species at 30 and 35âm height in the canopy. He observed that the budburst of the seedling growing at these heights was much earlier than that of the dominant trees. He concluded that the main factor to explain this difference in budburst is driven by ontogeny (tree age and height) as stated by SeiwaÂ (1999b) and that the vertical profile in temperature within the canopy only plays a secondary role. To capture the differences in budburst between understorey and dominant trees, ontogeny must be taken into account in priority.\n\nDrought stress occurs when trees can no longer adjust their water use to soil water availability, which reduces growth and can even lead to mortality in the short or medium term due to hydraulic failure or progressive carbon starvation (McDowell and Allen, 2015; Meir et al., 2015; Greenwood et al., 2017). The stomatal control of water use varies among tree species and depends on tree size (MartÃ­nez-Vilalta and Lloret, 2016). In general, stomatal conductance decreases with tree height, which can be related to the fact that taller trees experience higher hydraulic resistance, higher soil-to-leaf water potential differences and are more vulnerable to cavitation (Grote et al., 2016). For the same climate conditions above the forest canopy, water demand varies with the degree of crown shading (local microclimate), which depends on the crown position within the canopy (Bennett et al., 2015). All in all, dominant trees are more susceptible to drought stress and mortality since they are more exposed to stressful conditions (excessive radiation, high vapour pressure deficit and elevated temperature) and present a higher risk of cavitation (Grote et al., 2016; RÃ¶tzer et al., 2017). In addition, as dominant trees have higher evapotranspiration rates, the soil water reserves in their surroundings are more rapidly depleted, which is however partly compensated by deeper rooting and horizontal water redistribution. These dominant trees reduce water availability for suppressed trees but, at the same time, decrease their evaporation demand. Complementarity in water use can occur when trees of different size and species take up water from different soil layers (Schwendenmann et al., 2015). This can also result in facilitation through hydraulic lift (Zapater et al., 2011). Mixed and structured stands promote facilitation and complementarity in water use but can also lead to faster exploitation of soil water reserves (SchÃ¤fer et al., 2018).\n\nModelling the complex functioning of heterogeneous forests is rather challenging. A more detailed representation of tree interactions comes at the price of a higher complexity, eventually lower robustness and longer computing times. One needs however spatially explicit individual-based models for gaining a mechanistic and comprehensive understanding of tree interactions and for comparing various spatial representations of stand structure in order to select the best one for the considered function (Berger et al., 2008; Bravo et al., 2019). Among other things, such models allow tree spatial configuration to be taken into account and stands composed of the same trees but with a contrasted spatial aggregation to be distinguished between (e.g. intimate vs. patch-wise mixture). However, very few models of this type currently exist. For all of these reasons, we decided therefore to develop a spatially explicit individual-based model called HETEROFOR for HETEROgeneous FOrest.\n\nThe processes regulating the carbon fluxes and the dimensional growth constitute the core of the HETEROFOR model and are described in Jonard et al.Â (2020a). Here, we focus on the description of two modules essential for predicting the impact of climate change on tree growth: phenology and water balance (Park et al., 2016; Choat et al., 2018). Phenology is described at the species level, with the possibility to make it dependent on tree size. Water balance can be achieved at the tree level or at the stand level by aggregation of individual tree properties. We used data from long-term forest monitoring to evaluate the capacity of the model to reproduce key phenological phases (budburst, leaf development, yellowing and fall) and the soil water content dynamics, as well as to estimate individual transpiration, stand throughfall and deep drainage. Evaluating each module separately is necessary to ensure the consistency of the whole model (Soares et al., 1995).\n\nIn order to predict the impact of global changes on forests, it is crucial to integrate and structure the existing knowledge in process-based models. However, this first step is not sufficient. A detailed documentation of the models and an evaluation of their performances are also needed in order to use them while knowing exactly their strengths and limits. While most models were described in scientific articles or reports, their evaluation was often limited to one or two sites used to illustrate the model functioning and were generally based on integrative response variables such as radial tree growth (Vanclay and Skovsgaard, 1997; Schmidt et al., 2006). Yet, to provide robust predictions of tree growth under changing conditions, the model must be able to accurately reproduce not only the observed tree growth but also the intermediate processes describing resource availability (light, water and nutrients) (Soares et al., 1995). In the following section, we discuss the quality of the predictions for two main drivers of tree growth (phenology and water balance) in relation with the concepts used to describe them.\n\n4.1âPhenology\n\nThe two-phase model with the optimum response function for chilling was the least-biased variant for predicting budburst. However, the one-phase model including only the forcing period better captured the interannual variability. While the bias is likely to originate from the model calibration (data used for calibration were observations from western Germany) and could be corrected, the ability of the model to predict temporal variability is more representative of its structural quality. It is common that models accounting only for the forcing period better represent the observations of budburst temporal variability (Leinonen and Kramer, 2002; Fu et al., 2014; Basler, 2016). Two reasons can explain this. First, in areas where the chilling requirements are always met as in western Europe, the chilling parameters are not constrained enough by the observations and therefore are more difficult to calibrate. When few phenological observations are available, taking the chilling into account increases the model complexity without improving the accuracy of the predictions (Leinonen and Kramer, 2002; Fu et al., 2014). Secondly, two-phase models predict the break of endodormancy (end of chilling) and the start of budburst, while they are only calibrated from budburst observations. When endodormancy break observations are used for the calibration, the chilling parameters are estimated more accurately (Chuine et al., 2016), but these data are difficult to obtain and consequently very scarce (Jones et al., 2013).\n\nSimilarly to Chuine et al.Â (2016), we advise using a two-phase model (with the optimum response function for chilling) when endodormancy break observations are available or for long-term simulations with climate conditions beyond the range used for the model calibration. For example, for trees located at the southern margins of their species distribution area, the expected rise in winter temperature could prevent the fulfilling of their chilling requirements and inhibit budburst (Clark et al., 2014). This phenomenon would only be captured by a two-phase model. When few phenological data are available for calibration, the one-phase model should be preferred, especially for simulations with climate conditions similar to those used for the calibration. This highlights the importance of having both one and two-phase options to describe budburst. Most process-based models listed in TableÂ 5 had however only one phenological variant except 4C.\n\nDownload Print Version | Download XLSX\n\nA possible improvement of the two-phase phenological models would be to integrate the photoperiod effect on budburst. Indeed, some recent studies have shown evidence that photoperiod can compensate for a lack of chilling temperature that would prevent the buds from opening and for an early frost episode that would trigger budburst before winter (Vitasse and Basler, 2013; Pletsers et al., 2015). This mechanism is particularly present for late-successional species like beech and oak trees and is regularly cited as a key element used to simulate the phenology under climate change (Basler and KÃ¶rner, 2012). Some models tried to account for the photoperiod effect simply by replacing chilling by photoperiod (Kramer, 1994; Schaber and Badeck, 2003) but, in this way, failed to represent the combined effect of these variables. Recently, a few models integrating the compensatory effect of photoperiod on chilling have appeared. However, these models include more phenological parameters for similar predictive ability (Gauzere et al., 2017). It remains indeed difficult to disentangle the co-varying effect of chilling and day length with in situ measurements (Flynn and Wolkovich, 2018) since photoperiod variations only occur for sites with different latitudes where other confusing factors play a role as well (Primack et al., 2009). Therefore, a large quantity of data are necessary to calibrate these models. Therefore, we decided to favour the accuracy of our phenological model with a more process-based approach, but we are looking forward for improvements in these kinds of models and a more consensual body of literature.\n\nThe better growth predictions obtained for the small trees when the phenology was calculated at the individual scale highlight the importance of the âphenological avoidance strategyâ displayed by understory trees. This had already been mentioned by Lopez et al.Â (2008) who observed that early-leafing species received between 45â% and 80â% of their photon flux during the budburst period. Moreover, a simulation study showed that a 1-week (2-week) lengthening of the understory vegetation period with regard to the overstorey in both spring and autumn generated a productivity increase of 32â% (55â%) on such a short period (Jolly et al., 2004).\n\n4.2âWater balance\n\nIn a first step, the annual water fluxes predicted by HETEROFOR were compared to measurements and predictions of other studies (TableÂ 4). Then, some water fluxes were individually evaluated when data were available. Finally, some potential improvement of the water balance module were discussed.\n\nVarious studies were taken from the literature to compare our water module predictions with observations. They cover a range of annual rainfall comprised of between 425 and 1476âmm (TableÂ 4), which is comparable to what can be found in Belgium. The proportions of rainfall converted to stemflow obtained with HETEROFOR (6.1â% to 13.1â%) are within the range reported in the literature (0.6â% to 20.4â%). This large observation spectrum comes from the important seasonal (higher stemflow proportion in winter than during the vegetation period) and species differences (stemflow importance is higher for beech than oak trees), which are accounted for in HETEROFOR. However, the mean value from the literature (7.3â% of rainfall) is close to the average value for the six study sites (10.3â%). The proportions of intercepted rainfall (15.9â% to 22.0â%) and throughfall (64.8â% to 78.0â%) are also consistent with the ranges reported in other studies (1.9â% to 31.0â% and 59.8â% to 83.1â%). Moreover, we observed a good matching between the average values (respectively 19.5â% and 73.8â% from literature and 19.4â% and 70.2â% for our study sites). For transpiration, the range found in the literature is large (14.8â% to 52.3â%, with an average value of 31.9â%), which is not surprising since interannual and intersite variabilities are high for this variable (Schipka et al., 2005; Vincke et al., 2005). The predicted transpiration proportions are less variable (31.2â% to 44.9â%) and their average value of 36.0â% is slightly above to the mean observed transpiration (31.9â%). Regarding drainage, no direct measurements can be made; all the estimates from the literature come from indirect methods or modelling also subject to uncertainties. The range of drainage values reported in the literature (13â% to 70â%) is very large and contains the range obtained with HETEROFOR (26.3â% to 44.2â%). The mean predicted drainage (39.7â%) is close to the mean value of the literature (37.5â%). By this comparison with the water fluxes reported in the literature, we show that HETEROFOR provides plausible estimates of the various components of the water cycle.\n\nComparing predicted and observed throughfall is interesting for the evaluation of the water balance module since throughfall is an integrative variable depending on the water storage capacity of foliage, on evaporation and on the proportion of stemflow. The good agreement between observations and predictions indicates that the partitioning of rainfall when passing through the canopy and the evaporation of the water intercepted by foliage and bark are described well. Among the different models of TableÂ 5, no one accounts separately for stemflow and throughfall, but other models not included in the list consider the two fluxes separately (e.g. Gotilwa+ and Castanea). Yet, separating throughfall and stemflow is important, especially for structurally complex stands. In these stands, rainfall interception cannot be simulated based on a mean foliage storage capacity and a mean partitioning between throughfall and stemflow since these parameters vary with stand composition and structure. Our tree-level approach estimating foliage storage capacity and stemflow proportion based on individual tree characteristics allows us to overcome this difficulty. Moreover, if one wants to accurately describe the nutrient cycle, partitioning rainfall is essential as nutrient concentrations in stemflow and throughfall can be 10 to 100 times higher than in rainfall due to dry and wet deposition and canopy exchange (Levia Jr. and Herwitz, 2000; AndrÃ© et al., 2008c; van Stan and Gordon, 2018). Even if the rainfall partitioning can still be improved from a theoretical perspective (e.g. including canopy drainage after rain events or the impact of wind on the foliage storage capacity like in HÃ¶rmann et al., 1996, or Muzylo et al., 2009), we chose to limit the level of complexity in order to avoid calibration difficulties.\n\nHETEROFOR satisfyingly reproduced individual tree transpiration with similar prediction quality for the tree and stand approach regarding the water balance calculation. For European beech, the water balance calculation at the tree scale allowed even the correction of the small bias which appeared with the stand approach (Fig.Â 6). The year selected for the simulation (2003) was particularly dry and hot during summer, which allowed a large range of meteorological and soil water conditions to be covered. It is indeed interesting to test the tree approach under dry conditions since horizontal water redistribution is much less efficient in this case.\n\nTwenty to thirty percent of the transpiration variability remained unexplained by the model, which can be partly ascribed to model inaccuracies but also to the large uncertainty associated with the sap flux measurements. Among other things, the measurements made by Jonard et al.Â (2011) did not take the azimuthal variation in the sap flux into account since only one sensor per tree was installed.\n\nThis first evaluation of tree transpiration predictions indicates that no loss of precision occurred with the tree scale approach, while this detailed spatial representation could have increased the variability in transpiration predictions since it generated some heterogeneity in soil water availability (AppendixÂ C). These good results show that the water balance calculation at the tree scale provides a promising tool to better understand the individual variability and local environment effects on tree water use and sensitivity to drought. This must be considered in a dynamics of continuous improvement of the model and will require more transpiration measurements and in-depth comparisons of predictions and observations.\n\nThe amount of extractable water (EW), directly influenced by tree transpiration and soil evaporation, is also a key element of the water cycle, driving, among other things, the drought resistance of a stand. The temporal dynamics of EW was captured well by HETEROFOR, as evidenced by the high correlations (Pearson's coefficient was between 0.893 and 0.950) between observed and predicted EW for the various study sites (Fig.Â 7). These correlations are within the high end of the range reported for similar models. With the BALANCE model, Grote and PretzschÂ (2002) obtained a Pearson's correlation of 0.85 between the observed and predicted soil water content of the upper soil (0â20âcm horizon) in a beech forest in Germany (Freising). Applying BALANCE on three broadleaved stands of oak or beech in Germany, RÃ¶tzer et al.Â (2005) were also able to correctly reproduce soil water content dynamics but mentioned a significant decrease in the quality of predictions during the 2003 drought due to an overestimation of the soil drying, which was not observed with HETEROFOR in 2018. Comparing the observed soil water content at various soil depths with that predicted by the 4C model in mixed oak and pine forest (Brandenburg, Germany), Gutsch et al.Â (2015) obtained Pearson's correlations ranging from 0.59 to 0.74. In an oak stand in Tennessee (USA), Hanson et al.Â (2004) compared the ability of nine process-based forest models to reproduce soil water dynamics in the 0â35âcm horizon of the soil and obtained correlations ranging from 0.81 to 0.96.\n\nIn the study of Hanson et al.Â (2004), relative bias was evaluated as well for soil water content and ranged between â1.3â% and 4.0â%. These values are comparable to those found in this study yet a bit lower. Furthermore, discrepancies between predicted and observed EW occurred during limited periods. Several reasons can be advanced to explain them. Errors in the prediction of the budburst date can result in a too early or too late restarting of tree transpiration and induce an inaccurate depletion of the soil extractable water during the vegetation period. In order to distinguish this error source from the others, one could force the model with the observed budburst date. This option is however not yet implemented in the model. The lack of agreement between observed and predicted EW could also be ascribed to the strong heterogeneity of soil properties in forest ecosystems. Similarly, local rainfall events recharging soil extractable water during summer (often associated with thunderstorms) are sometimes not correctly taken into account when missing meteorological data (due to failed sensors or other technical problems) are replaced by rainfall data of a meteorological station further away.\n\nDownload Print Version | Download XLSX\n\nSimplifications and errors in the model conception may also generate divergence between observations and predictions. However, this structural uncertainty can be limited by selecting the most appropriate concepts. HETEROFOR predicts water transfer between soil horizons using the Darcy law. We tried to implement an approach of intermediate complexity between simple bucket models and the Richards equations. From a theoretical point of view, the Richards approach is the most state-of-the-art but requires very long calculation times (Fatichi et al., 2016) and is usually implemented in models specifically dedicated to water flow simulations (in TableÂ 5, only one of the models, MAESPA, uses them). Forest ecosystem models generally use simpler approaches such as the bucket model declined in a large variety of forms (TableÂ 5). These models consider one or several buckets with a specified water storage capacity that is filled with rainfall and is emptied by evapotranspiration. If the soil water content is at field capacity, water is transferred to the underlying layer and finally lost by drainage. Improved versions can account for transfer between buckets in unsaturated conditions using the Darcy law (leaky bucket model).\n\nOur water transfer routine discretizes the soil in horizons whose thickness varies from a few centimetres (upper horizons) to half a metre (deeper horizons). Compared to the numerical resolution of Richards equation, which requires thin soil layers (1 to 2âcm), our vertical discretization of the soil profile is quite coarse and inaccurately predicts the advance of the wetting front. As the tree transpiration and photosynthesis depend on the soil water conditions of the whole soil profile, this inaccuracy has very limited implications on the simulated tree growth. In our approach, water transfer during a time step is calculated based on the horizon water potentials estimated at the end of the previous time step. As such, the model makes the hypothesis that the water content does not change significantly during the time step, which is certainly not the case close to the wetting front and cannot ensure mass conservation. In order to limit this problem, the model uses an adaptive time step estimated based on the Peclet number described in Eq.Â (77). This allows mass conservation to be ensured.\n\nFinally, another reason that could explain the discrepancy between predictions and observations is the presence of macropores that cause preferential flows. These water fluxes defined as water movements in the soil along preferred pathways that bypass the soil matrix (Hardie et al., 2011) can be generated by soil shrinkage, root growth, chemical weathering, cycles of freezing and thawing or bioturbation (Aubertin, 1971). These macropores are more frequent in forest soils than in agricultural soils as the latter are often ploughed and homogenized. They are however difficult to characterize given their strong spatial heterogeneity in both vertical and horizontal directions (Aubertin, 1971). Adaptations of the Richards equations can be used to account for the preferential flows (dual porosity and dual permeability) but require a good characterization of soil macropores (not possible to achieve routinely in forest soils given their heterogeneity) and are still more complicated to solve than the classical Richards equations. We implemented in the model the transfer of the soil water surplus (when water saturation is reached) to the underlying horizon and the possibility to redirect part of this surplus as deep drainage to account empirically for preferential flows. Indeed, preferential flows in macropores become significant only when rainfall exceeds the water infiltration rate in the soil matrix and accumulates in the soil surface. The fraction of the water surplus considered as preferential flows is an empirical parameter reflecting the macroporosity of the site.\n\nThe performances of the soil water transfer routine can also be checked based on the deep drainage flux. In this study, we compared the deep drainage estimated with HETEROFOR and with the chloride mass balance approach. The mean drainage predicted with HETEROFOR was 379âmmâyrâ1 while the average drainage obtained with the chloride approach amounted to 472âmmâyrâ1, which corresponds to a bias of â19.9â%. The correlation between the two types of estimate amounted to a Pearson's coefficient of 0.963, with a RMSE value of 100.6âmm. These values depict a constant negative bias in the predictions that can easily be seen on the lower part of Fig. 5. It is hard to tell whether the gap originates from the model or the method used to estimate drainage from the chloride approach. It is more likely that the bias must be ascribed to both. Indeed, on the one hand, even if the use of chemical tracers to estimate drainage or groundwater recharge is commonly used (Scanlon et al., 2002), its application remains subject to uncertainties. First, the chloride method supposes that the main chloride source is rainfall and that the other sources can be neglected (Murphy et al., 1996). This hypothesis is not always fulfilled due to anthropogenic chloride introduction (road salting, wastewater) or when chloride is present in the bedrock (Ping et al., 2014). Then, preferential flows have been regularly highlighted as an error source since the associated water fluxes are not well sampled by zero-tension lysimeters (Tyler and Walker, 1994; Nkotagu, 1996). Finally, this method displays better results when rainfall and soil water are richer in chloride (e.g. sites close to the sea with high marine deposits or with low drainage flux) because the chemical analyses are more accurate for higher concentrations (Sammis et al., 1982; Grismer et al., 2000).\n\nOn the other hand, modelling errors could explain the bias presence. One of them could be the overestimation of the transpired water amount. However, deep drainage tends to produce during winter, while transpiration only takes place during the vegetation period (spring and summer). Therefore, if transpiration was overestimated we should observe an underestimation of the EW during spring and summer (low values), which is not the case (Fig.Â 7).\n\nHanson et al.Â (2004) measured deep drainage at the watershed level by accounting for rainfall and stream flow outputs and compared their measurements with the predictions of several models. Their multimodel comparison displayed similar RMSE (65.5 to 225.6âmm) and relative bias (â27.6â% to 20.5â%) values, but the Pearson's coefficient displayed by HETEROFOR is definitely located in the high tail of the study range (0.61 to 0.95). However, the performances of their models are not strictly comparable to ours since the reference method for estimating drainage differs (Sammis et al., 1982; Grismer et al., 2000; Obiefuna and Orazulike, 2011).\n\n4.3âSimulating phenology and water balance in heterogeneous stands\n\nIncreasing the functional trait diversity and promoting uneven-aged stands are among the management strategies that foresters can use to make their forests more resistant to stressful conditions and more resilient after a disturbance (Pedro et al., 2015; Jactel et al., 2017; Anderegg et al., 2018). With the growing interest for mixed and uneven-aged stands, various attempts have been made to better account for stand structure in process-based forest models. Some of these models present very detailed 3D representations of individual tree structure but describe generally only specific physiological processes (e.g. LIGNUM, EMILION and MAESPA). Such models are very useful tools for analysing outcomes of ecophysiological experiments and obtaining a better understanding of specific ecophysiological processes (e.g. drought sensitivity) in structurally complex stands. Since they are generally computationally expensive and applied to one or a limited number of individuals, they can however not be used for simulating long-term forest dynamics according to various climate and forest management scenarios. Other individual-based models can be applied on all the trees of a stand in long-term simulations but at the cost of a coarse representation of physiological processes (e.g. SORTIE/BC). These models are interesting for the analysis of tree growth dynamics in heterogeneous forests but are less suitable for taking into account the changing environment. Since they simplify stand structure representation, cohort-based models can afford a detailed process-based description of the main processes involved in tree growth (e.g. 4C, ANAFORE, PSIM-DNDC and 3D-CMCC; see TableÂ 5 for model characteristics). Here, the compromise is made on the spatial representation, which accounts for the vertical gradient in growing conditions but not for the horizontal heterogeneity. Such models can indeed not distinguish between stands composed of the same trees but with various degrees of spatial aggregation (e.g. intimate vs. patch-wise mixture). Similarly, some individual-based models choose to sacrifice the horizontal heterogeneity of some processes (e.g. iLand and Hybrid, which calculate most of the water balance at stand scale; see TableÂ 5 for model characteristics).\n\nTo simulate the impact of management in heterogeneous forests under changing conditions, we developed a spatially explicit individual-based approach designed to account for individual variability, local environment and adaptive behaviour of trees (Berger et al., 2008). The compromise was not achieved by strongly reducing the complexity of a particular aspect (spatial representation, process description or spatial or temporal coverage), but instead we tried to develop a balanced approach in which each aspect is described with the same level of complexity.\n\nAmong the existing individual-based models, BALANCE and NOTG-3D are close to HETEROFOR since they were designed according to the same philosophy. They present however some substantial conceptual differences (TableÂ 5). Except BALANCE for leaf yellowing, HETEROFOR is the only model determining budburst, leaf yellowing and fall at the tree level. While rainfall partitioning is only calculated in HETEROFOR, the spatial representation of local climate conditions in the canopy is finer in BALANCE and NOTG-3D, which consider different canopy layers or voxels. Regarding transpiration, HETEROFOR and BALANCE implement the widely used PenmanâMonteith equation, while it is determined as part of detailed energy budget in NOTG-3D. Finally, they all describe soil water dynamics at the individual scale, but HETEROFOR displays a more mechanistic approach for describing soil water transfer among horizons (bucket vs. Darcy model).\n\nIn HETEROFOR, some processes were described at two spatial scales (tree or stand level) in order to have the opportunity to compare the two approaches and choose the most appropriate one depending on the pursued objective. The phenological timing is species dependent and can optionally vary with tree size. This option (phenology at tree level) is very interesting since it accounts for both the ontogeny effect and the vertical gradient in climate conditions. With this option, a longer vegetation period is assigned to the understory compared to the overstorey, which allows for the improvement of radial growth predictions by correcting the growth underestimation in small trees and the overestimation in bigger ones (AppendixÂ D). This first attempt to describe phenology at tree scale is quite empirical and could be adapted in the future as knowledge on inter-individual phenology differences improves. Individual phenology observations for trees of all social status will be necessary to better calibrate and evaluate this module in an iterative cycle of model improvement.\n\nFor the water balance, HETEROFOR accounts for a direct tree size effect on stomatal conductance (stomatal conductance is inversely proportional to the height of largest crow extension) and for an indirect effect on the sapwood to leaf area ratio whose components both depend on tree size (Jonard et al., 2020a). In addition, individual transpiration is a function of the radiation intercepted by the tree, the local wind speed and the soil water availability. Finally, the tree adaptive behaviour to the local environment is described by an adaptation of the foliage biomass to local competition conditions and by specific leaf area varying with crown position within the canopy (Jonard et al., 2020a). Whatever the considered scale (tree or stand), HETEROFOR was able to correctly reproduce individual tree transpiration. Additional sap flux measurements as well as a characterization of the horizontal soil water content heterogeneity (using ground-penetrating radar tomography â GPR â technique for example) would be very useful to further evaluate the model performances and still enhance its ability to describe the complex hydrological functioning of heterogeneous forest. Among the possible improvements, mortality representation could be enhanced by considering hydraulic failure during severe droughts (Martin-StPaul et al., 2017). Another model improvement would be to take the interaction between the water cycle and the phenology into account by integrating a drought effect on budburst, leaf yellowing and fall as reported in some observation studies (Sanz-PÃ©rez and Castro-DÃ­ez, 2010; Xie et al., 2018).\n\nAhmadi, M.
