WASHINGTON, July 3 -- ..e.eMe.. tle ...I.....e. cola Leto he was thinking of sharing' with the Soviet Union and other com- es the knowledge of how to . produce \"Mean\" hydrogen bombs. Sort * step would require legislation, be said. But he dis- closed that he nad asked his scientific advisers about. the pos- sibility of sharing, and they had suggested such a course might be adopted as soon as they had proved they could produce a bomb totally free of dangerous radioactive fall-out. The President saki that in the meantime he intended to invite foreign countries lo make their own measurements of the per- centage of radioactivity on the site of the next United States, hydrogen bomb detonation, This should serve as an aP-1 propriate test by doubters of the: contention that 'even now only; 4 per cent radioactivity results from the explosion of United. States hydrogen bombs, the Prenident declared. It-eaS Given la Others President Eisenhower opened his news conference with an an- nouncement that the United States was making more man- WM-235 available in the peaceful uses of atomic power. . In response to questions about Carted States policy on disarm- am.ent and the effects on that policy of reduced radioactive fended, in bomb explosions, the; President emphasized: !The United States stands[ firm on its position at the Lon- don disarmament conference,: ?agreeing to a temporary suspen- sion of nuclear arms tests if it will lead to an end of bomb- making. 011ie United States disarm- ament position Was carefully f worked out over $ period of at least three years and its pro- posals are not designed to refute allegations of insincerity. 9The United States' effort to produce \"clean\" bombs is in- Emoted to make peaetime uses of nuclear energy possible, for :example, in the building of jtunnels or in moving mountains. Need: of Unity Strearsed The President also discussed at some length the importance of coordinating United States dis- armament proposals with those of its pities. \"You don't want to go to the Soviets; or to any other nation, for exempla and make a pro- posal that affects a third coun- try without that third country's a.pproval, because then you sud- denly become like Napoleon and Alexander, on a raft in the . Vistula, settling the fate of Europe?' The President referred to a. meeting in 1807 that took place. on the river Neeman, or Memel. ?We are not doing that,\" he? continued, stressing that the Icing laborious process of work-: ing out policies required con- sultation with West Germany,' France, Britain, Canada and all the countries .of the North At': lantic Treaty Organization. With some heat he responded to a question whether the United States \"dare\" be sincere in dis- armament by declaring, \"You mustn't think that this whole business of disarmament fluid as it is, is operated on the hares of shooting from the hip.\" President Eisenhower stressed the \"political, psychological ef- fects\" of getting on with a dis- armament agreement, \"even if you suffered some scientific dis- advantage\" The President did not specify what these disadvantages might be, but presumably he referred Co testimony by scientists of ? the Atomic Energy Commiesion that s. suspension of nuclear arms testa would impede the develop- ment of new weapons as well as peacetime protects. However, Charles E. Wilson, Secretary of Defense, has said [Jett a sueponsion of nuclear sems tests would not halt the development of the long-range ballistics missile, 'since the de- irelopment of delivery systems could continue. In addition Secretary Wilson eats said that suspension of the Melees, arms tests would con- stitute little more than a \"nui- sance,\" and need not affect the international arms race at, Ml. The President revealed, in re- iponse to a 'question, that when as set down the final disarma- ment position for the talks in London last May 25, he knew Mat the United States had sue- teeded in reducing bomb radio- rictivIty fall-out by at least 90 cer cent. 'Clean' Bomb Data Lacking But no one bad suggested to nin at the time that \"complete- y clean\" bombs were possible, Othough Lewis L. Strauss, ?hairman of the Atomic Energy ,Iommission, had forecast \"N ser cent clean\" bombs, General Eisenhower went on. Then the President said, \"in- ?Mentally,\" while there was 'very hopeful.\" talk of suspend. rig tests, he planned to invite my country in the world that canted to come to test the radio- settee fall-out of United States somas to do so \"if, ever tinder my circumstances there is &n- ether test made.\" CPYRGHT JUL 5 flu/ CONGRESS IS WART ON GIVING MOSCOW `CLEAN' BOMB DATA Knowland, Mansfield ard Holifield Express Doubt?

It appeared from the transcrigt of the President's remarks that he had not himself advocated this action, but it was clear that he had thought about it ant raised the possibility without prompting.

General Eisenhower did not say explic- itly that he favored this course hanself. 96.70 of Fall-Out Eliminated Previously, the President had noted that scientists believed that they had eliminated about 96 per cent of the radioactive fall-out from such devices and with time could reduce the amount even more, Representative Chet Holifield, Democrat of California, a mem- ber of the Joint Congressional Atomic Commission, said: 'If the President means that we should reveal to the Soviets how to make a clean bomb or any other kind of bomb, this is a complete reversal of our national policy and security.\" Stich a step would require Congressional approval. The President did not say any- thing about dieclosing bomb - making secrets, but only a for- mula for avoiding most fall-out. Senator Bourke B. Ilickem looper, Republican of Iowa, also a member of the Joint Atomic Committee, indicated cautious support of the proposal. \"Through such programs as this,\" les said, \" we may be able some day to obtain assurances that in event of another war all nations will have clean bombs.\" Knowiand Is Doubtful Senator Knowland remarked: 411 doubt that Congress would be prepared to turn over any weapons information to the So- viet Union.\" Mr. Mansfield, in an interview, deceased, \"Before we agree to give thern a.ny information we certainty should have an iron- clad agreement., backed by sscape-proof inspection arrange- ments to do away with the building of the bigger bombs and a disarmament plan which would tut down defense expendituies for all countries.\" Senator Mansfield, the acting Democratic leader. toldthe Sen- ate yesterday that the search or a [?'elean\" bomb must not be permitted to obscure attempts to reach an agreement to ban future testing of large bombs. .E am not at all convinced that ULC use of a 'clean' bomb would automatically displace the use f hydrogen weapons which would spread radioactive fall-out over a lareg area,\" he said, \"We as Americans may not use 'dirty' bombs, but who is to say that tL pi Ill.., wise? 4' 4 .\" HE ANNINtv \\ PO?, II en'! h 1)1, m ft ti i?

The World Day is a period of in. tensified observations throughout the world of the phenomena manifesting the link between the earth and the sun. It came close to what might prove to be the climax of the eleven-year sunspot cycle, but it caught several of the partic- ipants with their rockets not completed. Sixty-four, days have been set aside during the eighteen months of the International Geophysical Year as Regular World Days. They occur three or four times a month and are timed to coincide with the new moon, quarter moon or with expected meteor showers. The moon was in Its first. quarter yesterday and a shower of. meteors was expected to del' ug- the earth's atmosphere. Clouds of meteors, most of them hardly larger than grains of sand, orbit about the sun or fol- low other paths that bring them near the earth at predictable times. Data Sought on Flares When they plunge into the atmosphere they become shoot- ing stars as they are consumed fected. ? The key man In today's experi- ments was a 36-year-old elec- trical engineer front the Naval Research Laboratory. John E. Jackson devised the experiments: to be performed. They entailed the following: Each rocket had two whip- like antennae clasped tight to the air frame at take-off but rigged to extend like out- stretched arms abler the rocket had emerged into thin air, Radar, devices were set to record the rocket's position. Canadian scientists tried to beam vertical sigoals from ground to ionosphere to take readings that, in the past, had given useful but imprecise pic- tures of ionospheric activity. , Today these measurements were blacked out, by intense ionos- pheric activity. It is because such aberrations are prevalent in the arctic that much of the rocket research is concentrated here. What the scientists counted on calculating from all the sta- tistics were such data as: The density of electrons at various os MOS hectoric_a_nitudes; the ffirdpinagnetic field, and the frequency ofelec- tron collisions. y friction with the air. They i re of interest to geophysicistsi lecause some believe they Minh: mice weather and other upper i ir phenomena.

The latest flare was imported yesterday at Britain's largest radio research station at Slough, about twenty miles from London. When a researcher noticed' that an instrument called a vertical sounder- was no longer recording as it should have been. Vertical sounders are used to hurl radio signals into the iono- sphere at regular intervels. By noting the height at which sig- nals are reflected back to earth, researchers can calculate the density of layers of electrified particles from heights of about forty-five miles upward. The radio teams at Slough also found that it was impossible to pick up the wavelength of a British Broadcasting Corpora- tion long-range transmitter In North Wales, on which they carry out routine studies in radio-wave fluctuations. Inquiries at ten other radio and ionospheric research stations showed that all experimental short- wave transmissions had been blanketed by the initial im- pact of the wave of ultraviolet light from the flaring sun.

And the atatement will be : ready, I should think, by o'clock, CHALMERSIt ROBERTS of The Washington Post and Times-Herald?Mr. President, as a result of your remarks last week on disarmament at the press ennference, especial- ly what you told us about the scientists who called on you, there appeats to be some im- pression, both at home and abroad, that you and the Ad- ministration are less enthusi- astic about a disarmament agreement than you had been previously. Could you straight- en us out on that, sir? At ?Welt I think if you will ratan my statement?arid now ma just depending upon my memory-4 think I started out by saying the Hinted States elands firmly by the agree- ment and the offers it has made in this regard, and we have not withdrawn from that position. I tailed to your attention a fact that coming tip as a rather new one in this whole scientific field, kept this sub. bet ever from being a stabs suet It ta at very dynamic, fluid sort of subject that you are working with all the time, but I I think I said last 'week that the political, paycheiogical et- ' I feels of doing this, going ahead I with this thing, were so great that even if you suffered some 7CiPilt Vic disadvantage, we I should go ahead with it, and stai believe that very firm- ly; and under the?under the conditions that: the United a, States has always insisted tts on. that is, that we have ant- ficient inspectma to know that th InP are both honest...doing what h we said we would do, and that fa it is coupled with some agree- h 'sent that at some future date We will cease Making bombs out, of this material, and de- vote It all to peaceful purposes, our offer always stands. el: , CHARLES S.

As I have told you before, nothing is more com- plicated than the questions and prolamin that involve for- eign policy; and any attempt to oversimplify them and just ? to make one great statement , of principle and truth and then say, \"That's that, no more,\" Is to ignore the other side of , equally intricate problems. For example, take it at home: I was just asked. a : question about civil rights. From one side of this picture i there is no question. But from the side of people who have lived with a very, very deft- the social problem for a num- ber of years, there are almost violent reactions on the other side. Now,, the same way foreign policy, in here you have the? you have the whole standing of America in the world in- volved, the standing of Amer- ica as a fair nation trying to be decent to all, not taking any particular sides in either domestic. or in international quarrels, trying to be a friend to lead back to peace. And I believe the United States' best role as a leader in the world today is te. try tO.be under- standing to bags Wes in any quarrel if .it is any of our business, and we are invited in any -way and try to lead them back to peace. Now, that means often you work behind the scenes, be- cause you don't get up and begin to shout about such things or there will be no effectiveness. Generally speak- ing, though, I would say read Mr. Dulles' report or reac- tion to this, which I agree Pryrb Knowledge P. BRANDT of Mr. President, is ,there any way in which we can share our knowledge on clean bombs with Russia and the other na- tions which might develop theni?

This is not easy Washington Post e 2002/h9/22 :ItruiDP65-00756R000500130067-0 Today and Tomorrow . On the Grandchildren's Future CPYRGHT ? By Walter Lippmann MARSHAL TITO. it turned out, has more than enough to do without being drawn ;into : the discussion, which was :started by : Ishrushc he so about social- ' ism and Airier- scan grand ; children. This may have been mere dis- cretion but I rather sus- pect that Tito !has learned from his own varied expert- Lippman , race that long-range ? predict- thins about the future of a so- cial system are almost certain to express little more than the prophet's hopes or fears. Al- though Marxists like to think 'that they possess the secrets t of history, no Marxist. tore :saw, or could have foreseen, :what now goes by the name of t socialism in Yugoslavia. The only thing' we know for :certain is that in the twent ?eth century, there is a rapid ;arid unpredictable evolution in every society, except pee- !haps in the most primitive :and isolated. Kbrushchey does not know, he cannot know ,wtiat will develop in Russia in :ten years, much less in Amer- Ica in thirty years. The Communist world from :China to Yugoslavia and Po- land, including Russia itself, is not proceeding at-cording to some grand plan, revealed by Marx and Lenin, which leads to a common end; the various Communist regimes are feel- ing their way, seeking reme- dies and solutions for their tactical difficulties, and they are rationalizing the absence of a grand and universal principle by saying that there are many roads to socialism, As they take these many and !differing roads, they will he- gome Many and differing sod. tties Casa IF NO ONE KNOWS what 'socialism will he like in 1W0 generations, neither does any. 'one know what the American eronomy will be like.. It will Or course, not be like the Rus- sian or the Chinese today. We can be sure of that he- cause the controlling princi- ple in both Russia and in China is the rapid and forced development of an economi- cally and technologically back- ward country. The American economy, as Communist think- ers themselves often say, has long since reached a stage of development which Russia is still struggling to reach, which China has hardly be- gun to approach. SO we can be sure that while our grandchildren will nape- tinnce great changes in the A inericaa economy, these changes will not bra reaction to and a recapitulation or the Russian and Chinese experi- ence. Communism may rep) resent a future to A priMitive country like China. But for America, Communism is heel. event, having nothing to dn with our highly &kapott and complex economy. The American social order has changed greatly in this century, so greatly that terms like capitalism and free en- terprise and competition, which come down to its from the nineteenth century, no longer describe our economy There have been the wars, and the rise of the United States as a world power with a great military establishment. There has been the fabulous, indeed explosive, increase of the American population. There has been not only the deep and wide technological development, but, with the on ganization of scientific re- search, a radically new pace in the application of science. There has been also, so at least it seems to me, a non- violent? but nevertheless rev- olutionary ehan le in the inner principle of our own social economy. This is the new principle, which goes by the prosaic name of \"full em- cloym en t\"?the imperative that the Government must use the fiscal and other powers of the state to keep the demand for labor at least equal to the supply. Until the present generation this principle was unknown to, much less was it the policy of, the United States or any other capitalist nation. Its adoption marks a profound change. It would not in my view be an exaggeration to say that It has brought about a revolution in the West which has made the Communist rev- olutionary propaganda irrele- vant and antiquated.

Valerian Zorin, the Soviet deleg ite to the London conference, offered a two? to th cc-year cessation of tests. Harold Stassen, the A,nerican delegate, has now offered in return, in behalf of the United States, to halt nuclear tests for 10 months, provided the Russians will agree tU,. stop making bomb material, with an actual cutoff about 1959. It would have reflected much greater credit on the United States if the initial suspension proposal had come from this country with the support of its allies. Unfortu- nately, the difficulties of securing agreement in the West have enabled Russia to seize the iMtiative. Ten months is not a very long or impressive suspension period. It was made brief, nn dnubt, in order to fix a deadline for Soviet acceptance of the proposed halt in production of fissionables. But the tentative nature of the American suspen- sion plan, together with the condition attached ' to a gives rise. inescapably, to some suspicion that the United States is less enthusiastic about achieving agreement than it might be. And this suspicion may well have been augmented by the hope which President Eisenhower expressed at his news conference a week ago that a completely 'clean\" bomb might be developed if testing could continue. At his news conference yesterday, the President helped to dispel this suspicion. The political and psychological benefits of reaching some agreement with the Russians would be so great, he pointed out, that they would outweigh the scientific dis- advantages of suspending further tests. For this reason, he said, he still believes firmly that the United States should go ahead with the effort to work out a firm agreement. This seems to us the heart of the matter. The political and psycho- logical benefits are so immensely important that they would warrant acceptance of a single-step stispension agreement if the two-step proposal advanced by the , United States could not he achieved, One step leads to another. The Ind's- 'pensable thing is to get moving. 00500130067-0 Approved FoalWise 2002/07/22 : CIACFR3get}56R000500130067-0 CPYRGHT LION 2 8 1, CPYRGHT Nutting Says Red Aim Is Time to Match U. S.

Mr. Mikoyan wa sengaged in earliest conversatton with Yugo- slav Ambassador Veliko Mieuno- vie.

Mass Meetings Held The Soviet leadership did not rely on the bare announcement of the removal of Messrs 'Molo- tov, Malenkov and Kaganovich to convince. the Soviet public that the action was both neces- sary and desirable. Newspapers today were filled With. reports] of mass meetings that had been 'held in most major cities in ad- vance of the official announce- ment. The most important of those meetings was held in Moscow Tuesday evening. The audience heard speeches by Mr. Khmer shchev, Premier Regatta% and Miss Yekaterina A. Furtseva, newly appointed to regular mem- bership in the party Presidium and the only woman ever to reach that position. At the meeting party officials, engineers and workers spoke in support of the party's action against the three men who had been dismissed. Messrs. Molotov, _Malenkov and Kaganovich were accused of \"conspiratorial meth. ods\" in trying to set up an \"anti- party faction.\" ? Special fire was directed against Mr. Molotov, who has been in the highest Soviet circle longer than any living man.

Times JUL 5 157 CPYRGHT SHIFT IN SA TEL alalenkov and the other ousted Soviet leaders optioned this con- cession as asserted in the official Communist party communique. Doubt on this point arises for at least two reasons: First, Government requisitions from the private gardens were sharply reduced earlier in the post-Stalin period, while the now ousted leaders were still very powerful, Under Stalin, the exac- tions from these gardens were so heavy that Many peasants found It Wiser to slaughter their cows rather than keep them and have to deliver what the Government required. Second, .the communique as- serted that. the ousted leaders opposed raising material Moen trees for fanners, that is to say they opposed raising prices the Government pays the collective lams for their produce. But, the first major increase in such prices was announced in Septem- ber 1953 while Ma Malenkov was Premier of the Soviet Union. Other Discrepancies There were also ether discrep- ancies in the official communi- que explaining the ouster of the leaders. The most striking seemed to be the linking of Dmitri T. Shepilov as a fellow conspirator with Mr. Malenkov. This raised doubts because in January, 195. Mr. Shepiloy gave the public sig- nal for tb.e policy change that preceded Mr. Ma.lenkov's nation RS Soviet Premier, Mr. FhepileV then was the author of a major article in Pravda that laid down the thesis that the \"general line of the party\" was the absolute primacy of heavy industry over eon:sumer good; industry.

Kadar's Backers Pleased By ELIE ABEL CF'F New York tines. iintaliale.str, Hungary, July 4 routroa L?op .1 Radar welcomed today the. changes in the Soviet leadership. They predicted that the con- solidation of Nikita S. Khrush- chev's authority in the Kremlin would strengthen Mr. Kadar's :hand with the Hungarian Com- munist party. In a front-page editorial titled \"On the Road of the Twentieth Congress,\" the Hungarian party organ Nepszabadsag said this morning: \"The revolution of the Cen- tral Committee of the Soviet Communist party also helps our party to overcome existing and - reviving mistakes and sectarian methods and feelings. It is pos- sible that at the same time cer- tain revisionists or revisionism. minded persons will try to use the present resolution * ? * to justify and strengthen their ? ? * ambitions and inclinations. Of course one must stand up with proper firmness against slut phenomena,. aimed at ideo- logical troublemaking,\" At a conference of his own Party last week-end Mr. Kadar had no apparent difficulty in overcoming a challenge from the old Stalinist wing led by Jozsef Revel, former Minister of Cul- ture and arch-enemy of the in- tellectuals who sparked the October uprising. Mr. Revel got a. seat on the new Hungarian Central Committee, however, along with Imre Doget, Minister of Agriculture, also regarded as a Stalinist, 'Sectarian Methods' Scored The Stalinist group obviously as the target of Nepszahad- sag's attack on \"dogmatic mis- takes and sectarian methods.\" The so-can et revisionists, many or whom ?fused to rejoin the Kadar grit after the crushing of the rm. 'ion, are the follow- ers of Imre Tau, the National Communist evener Premier now in exile to Lutaania. Mr. Kadar evidently had had advance knowledge of the So- viet shake-up. The action in IMoscow took place during a Cen- tral Committee meeting from June 22 to 29, which also was the last day of the Hungarian party conference in Budapest.
