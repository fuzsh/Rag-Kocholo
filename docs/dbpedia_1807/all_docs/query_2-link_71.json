        "text": "A MESSAGE FROM THE DISTRICT GRAND MASTER\n\nAs we approach the Festive Season, I would like to extend to you and your Family my very best wishes for a Blessed Christmas and to the Members of the Jewish Faith, a Happy Festival of Chanukah.\n\nThis year has been one of the most successful Masonic years in our District. Not only have we had an increase in Members, but we have been able to participate in celebrating 300 years of English Freemasonry.\n\nRecently in London, several of us had the opportunity of attending the Tercentenary event at the Royal Albert Hall where we were able to enjoy with immense pride, an outstanding performance of the past 300year-old history of our Order.\n\nEarlier in the year, our own District had an excellent celebratory event at the Linder Auditorium in Johannesburg, where we enjoyed a symphonic performance of music based on the work of prominent Masonic composers from the past 300 years, under the baton of Richard Cock. Also throughout the District, many of our Lodges have successfully held their own celebrations ranging from banquets and dinners to sporting events and potjiekos competitions.\n\nWhilst we have been able to reflect on our past history with immense pride, we look to the future of this wonderful Order and our District with confidence and enthusiasm.\n\nMay the New Year bring Peace, Joy and Good Health to you and your loved ones.\n\nDEPUTY DISTRICT GRAND MASTER – CHRIS VAN GAALEN\n\nChristopher is the first born son of Hans and Yvonne van Gaalen and was born in Gauteng on the 9th of April 1968.\n\nDuring his years at Primrose Primary School, Chris joined the swimming team and played the trumpet in the school’s brass band. He was appointed as Head Boy for his final year.\n\nFollowing his successful primary school career, Chris attended the Bedfordview Technical High school where he was appointed as Cadet Band Major. Chris didn’t consider himself much of an\n\nathlete nor an “A” student, but his leadership skills again came to the fore as he was selected as the Head Boy for the year 1986.\n\nAfter completing his National Service as a Commissioned Officer, Chris was employed at\n\nHaggie Rand where he served an apprenticeship as a pupil engineer and Superintendent of the wire drawing department. During this period, he completed a National Higher Diploma in Mechanical Engineering T4. Chris now runs the family business as a third generation Managing Director.\n\nChris and his wife, Ena, will be celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary next February. They have two children, Kerri-Anne who is in her first year studying Biological Science and Simon who is in grade 10.\n\nAs a Lewis, Chris was initiated into Freemasonry in 1995 in The Ionic Lodge No. 3235. He is a past master of The Ionic, Germiston and Royal Edward Lodge. He is also a Past Master in Lyceum Lodge of Research, Transvaal District Grand Stewards and President Lodge (University scheme Lodge). He holds membership in the following side orders: Mark, Royal Ark Mariners, Operatives, Knights Templar, Red Cross of Constantine and Rose Croix. Finally, he is a member of Loge Eendracht Maakt Macht nr 88, Onder het Grootoosten der Nederlanden Oosten.\n\nChris received his first District appointment in 2004 as DistGStwd. This was followed by DistAGDC in 2005, a three year stint as DistDepGDC (2006 – 2009) and DistGDC between 2009 and 2011. He was promoted to PJGD in 2012 and PSGD in 2017. 6 years as Assistant District Grand Master has culminated in his latest appointment as Deputy District Grand Master.\n\nASSISTANT DISTRICT GRAND MASTER – CHARLES BURN\n\nCharles Burn was Initiated into Universal Friendship Lodge No. 9042 EC in November 1995. His proposer into Freemasonry, Adrian Durrant, is a long time friend from primary school and the son of the Charter Master of the Lodge.\n\nCharles went through the Chair of the Lodge in 2002/2003 and again in 2008/2009. His first District appointment was as District Grand Steward in 2006 which was followed by a two year stint (from 2007 to 2009) as District Assistant Grand Director of Ceremonies.\n\nHe was appointed as District Grand Treasurer in 2011, a position which he held for six years before being appointed Assistant District Grand Master.\n\nEarlier this year, Charles was thrilled to have travelled to London to attend the Annual Investiture with the MW the Grand Master HRH the Duke of Kent appointing him Past Assistant Grand Director of Ceremonies.\n\nCharles is also a member of the Transvaal District Grand Stewards Lodge No 8942 EC and the Woodlands Lodge No 3668 EC.\n\nCharles was Exalted into Apollo Royal Arch Chapter in February 2002, served as Zerubbabel of the Chapter in 2008, was appointed as DistAGDC in 2013 and District Grand Treasurer in 2017.\n\nHe was Perfected into the Witwatersrand Chapter No. 297 Rose Croix in November 2002 and Enthroned as Sovereign of the Chapter in 2012. He was appointed as Treasurer of the South African Branch Council in November 2012 and continues to hold this position. The 33° was conferred on Charles in January 2015 and he was appointed as Inspector General of the District of South Africa North East in January 2016.\n\nIn term of side degrees, Charles is a member the Gemini Conclave No. 41 and District Grand Sword Bearer in the Order of the Secret Monitor. He is also a member of both Corona Lodge of Mark Master Masons No. 557 and the Johannesburg Preceptory No. 160 of the Knights Templar. He continues as treasurer of the Transvaal Inter-Constitutional Masonic Charity.\n\nASSISTANT DISTRICT GRAND MASTER – SIMON KNUTTON\n\nSimon Knutton was initiated into St Michaels Lodge no. 8643 in August 1997 when it was still meeting in the Anglican Church in Bryanston. Mentored by W Bro. Paul Stocken, he went through the Chair in 2005/2006\n\nAs a result of the close association with Boksburg St John, he became a joining member of that Lodge in 2006 and took the Chair in 2008 and 2009. Following on from this, Simon received his first active District appointment as District Grand Steward in 2009.\n\nHe continued his active duty as an ADC in 2010, Deputy DC from 2011 to 2015 and as the District Grand Director of Ceremonies from 2015 until his appointment to Assistant District Grand Master at the 2017 Annual Meeting.\n\nIn between his District commitments, Simon is also PZ of Denver RA Chapter, a PM of Corona Mark Lodge and Past Commander of both the Cinderella Royal Ark Mariner & Transvaal Installed RAM Commanders. He was promoted to Grand Rank in the Mark at the Annual Investitures of Mark Masonry in June 2017.\n\nNot content with three Craft chairs behind him, he was Worshipful Master of St Michaels again in 2014 and was the WM of Pyramid Lodge no. 5003 in Naboomspruit from 2015 until 2017.\n\nHappily married to Cindy for almost 25 years, his daughter and son are both undergraduates at Stellenbosch University – Keeley is going into her 4th year of an LLB Environmental Law and Chaz into his second year of Civil Engineering.\n\nOutside of Masonic activity, Simon is very active on his Mountain Bike and has competed in nu- merous long distance and stage race events this year – he even took his bike to Mauritius during the Installation week in September where he “rode over the island and back for a decent Cappuccino” . . . 122km and over 1100m of climbing.\n\nIn his on words, “Masonry has done some great things in my personal development and my relationship with others”\n\nWHAT’S IN STORE FOR THE BOARD OF BENEVOLENCE IN 2018\n\n– W Bro. Chris Adams, President District Board of Benevolence\n\nThe Board of Benevolence (BOB) is a formal structure within the District which was formed to manage the physical and mental wellbeing of Brethren and their families, as well as, attend to various recommendations in respect of masonic grants, educational bursaries and charitable donations.\n\nWe are in place as a service entity to deliver relevant services to the Brethren and their families within our District. We cannot however work in isolation and rely heavily upon input from WMs, Lodge Almoners and Lodge Secretaries. To accomplish this, we intend to develop good communication throughout the entire District, involving all Brethren. We have started and will continue to circulate a regular newsletter “Benevolence matters” that will be distributed to all – we do of course ask that you share this with your families. As communication must always be bi-directional we have established a dedicated email address for communication to BOB\n\nbenevolence@freemason-jhb.org.za , We welcome any input or queries.\n\nWe are currently working on several projects for our term of office. These include building on and updating the list of both general and masonry specific benefits which should be available to each lodge in their Almoners manuals. If you don’t know what the Almoners manual is then I suggest to ask your Almoner and WM!\n\nWe are looking at organising a Wellness day at Park Lane and if successful using it as a model for similar ventures around all areas in the District.\n\nWe are gauging interest in implementing a “hospital visitor” program and have called for volunteers who would be willing to visit Brethren who have taken ill. So far response has been very slow and we urge you to contact us if you can assist.\n\nIn closing , if your lodge has no working scheduled you could always approach BOB to come and give a presentation on the work we do and why we think we are an important part of the District. The one thing to keep in mind is that we would need some notice to schedule the presentation\n\nCOMMEMORATING A 1925 FOUNDATION-STONE LAYING\n\nOn 18 November 2017, Unanimity Lodge no. 3372 and Pyramid Lodge no. 5003 held a combined regular meeting at the Chapel on the Klipspruit farm in the Entabeni Nature reserve in Potgietersrus. The meeting was to commemorate the laying of a Foundation stone which took place on 23 May 1925.\n\nThe Foundation-stone was to mark the building of a Church by Brother JB Goodrich, dedicated to the glory of T.G.A.O.T.U., in honour of Freemasonry and Sacred to the memory of his wife Evelyn Agatha Goodrich.\n\nFollowing the opening of the Lodge and general business, the Lodge was adjourned so that Brethren, including the RW DG Master W Bro. GS Bent Andrews could proceeded to the farm “ENERGLYN” in the district of Waterberg.\n\nThe WM, W Bro. Gilbertson proceeded to the laying of the foundation stone in due and Ancient form.\n\nBackground to the foundation stone:\n\nIn the ceremony of depositing the corner-stone, the sacred elements of masonic consecration are produced and the stone is solemnly set apart by pouring corn, wine and oil upon its surface.\n\nEach of these elements has a beautiful significance in our symbolism.\n\nCollectively, they allude to the Corn of Nourishment, the Wine of Refreshment, and the Oil of Joy, which are the promised rewards of a faithful and diligent performance of duty and often specifically refer to the anticipated success of the Lodge they have consecrated.\n\nThey are, in fact, types and symbols of all those abundant gifts of Divine Providence for which we are daily called upon to make an offering of our thanks and which are enumerated by King David in his catalogue of blessings, as “wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man’s heart.”\n\nTHE ROYAL ARCH AND THE CRAFT\n\nIn 2012 and again in 2014 the ME Pro First Grand Principal addressed the appointment of Royal Arch Representatives in Craft Lodges and the taking of wine with Royal Arch Members at Craft Festive Boards. This was in line with the recommendation of a strategic working party set up in 2012 to promote membership into the Holy Royal Arch Order.\n\nThe following address was given in 2014:\n\n“The relationship between the Craft and the Royal Arch – specifically covering two issues, firstly, the selection of Royal Arch representatives in Craft Lodges and secondly, the taking of wine with Royal Arch members at Craft Festive Boards.\n\nThe appointments and monitoring of the Royal Arch Representative in a Craft Lodge needs careful consideration. There has been debate as to who is responsible for this important appointment. In Provinces and Districts, where the Provincial / District Grand Master and Grand Superintendent are the same, there should be no issue. However, where the heads of the two orders are different, I believe it essential that the Provincial / District Grand Master and Grand Superintendent liaise. The appointment should never be a “tick in the box” exercise.\n\nAs a member of the Royal Arch, the Representative will need to have sufficient knowledge about the merits of joining the Order and be able to work closely with the Lodge Mentor. In many instances, it could be best that a member should be approached at the same time that he receives his Grand Lodge Certificate. I know from experience that there is a balance between judging whether someone will enjoy the Royal Arch, with the right time for that individual to join.\n\nThis timing is also pressurized by the concern that an individual will be approached to join one of the side orders first if there is any delay in recruitment. I continue to believe that there is a good stage to brief Master Masons on the merit of the Royal Arch, but that the actual timing of joining should be linked to each individual’s appetite for Masonic advancement and personal circumstances.\n\nFor those of you who are very involved with the side orders, please do not think that I am in any way against Craft members joining them, far from it. However, I do firmly believe that the Royal Arch should be the first priority.\n\nAs for wine taking with Royal Arch members at Craft Festive Boards – I believe that this custom should be treated sensitively – in any event the decision should lie in the hands of each Provincial / District Grand Master. I can see a case for this WHERE A CHAPTER IS LINKED TO A CRAFT LODGE – but even so, it is recommended that the wine taking is conducted with everyone sitting down, so that those who are not members of the Order are not embarrassed or\n\n– worse still – pounced on with a joining application.”\n\nTEARS AND TEDDY BEARS\n\nThe Widows Sons continues to grow from strength to strength with approximately 200 members across five provinces. The organisation has a strong focus on charity and the Central Chapter recently held one of the most tear jerking charity drives of the year when they donated teddy bears to the Pretoria Masonic Haven. These teddies are used as an aid in Alzheimer treatments.\n\nFollowing this moving visit, the Chapter donated approximately 800 DVD’s and equipment required for the special room used to care for these Alzheimer sufferers.\n\nTERCENTENARY CELEBRATIONS\n\n2017 sees the celebration of 300 years of English Freemasonry. The District has held various functions to commemorate this landmark event.\n\nPHOTOWALK AND OPEN DAY AT FREENASONS HALL\n\n“As the daughter, granddaughter and great-granddaughter of Freemasons, it was such an exciting opportunity for me to attend the recent photo walk and open day at Freemason’s Hall in Park Lane. The historic building, with all its intricacies, took my breath away and I was lucky enough to arrive early enough to capture the golden morning light filling the halls and casting the most perfect shadows across the entrance passage. It really is a photographer’s dream. It was so interesting learning more about Freemasonry in South Africa and I was so impressed by the charity work which is fulfilled by the organisation’s members – it made me proud to be connected to Freemasonry.” – Kelly Adams, a freelance photographer and content creator at Kelly Can Photography and daughter of Chris Adams.\n\n300 YEARS OF MASONIC MUSIC\n\nOn Saturday 15 July, Masons, family and friends headed out to the Linder Auditorium, where well known conductor, Richard Cock treated guests to a magical evening of Masonic Music.\n\nThe evening included an array of music, all composed by Freemasons. The variety of music on offer was spell bounding with classical works of Mozart and Haydn, to the more recent marches of Sousa, some Jazz from Duke Ellington and Irving Berlin and even the Major General’s song of Sir Arthur Sullivan. it was certainly a memorable evening that was thoroughly enjoyed by all in attendance.\n\nLODGE OF EMULATION – POTJIE COMPETITION\n\nGRAND LODGE AND SUPREME GRAND CHAPTER APPOINTMENTS 2017\n\n– W Bro.

His father was a Master Builder of Irish descent who assisted in the rebuilding of London after the blitz damage of the Second Word War.\n\nAs Dave’s father and most of his maternal relatives were musicians, his mother playing the piano, it was not surprising that from the age of 8, Dave also studied the piano. He again furthered his musical skills on completion of his secondary education at Brockley County Grammar School, S.E. London.\n\nHe worked for several American companies based in the UK in the Petro Chemical industry, during which he completed his Tertiary Polytechnic studies and entered South Africa on 23rd August 1972. He then worked mainly in the mining industry eventually spending 20 years at JCI culminating as Project Manager for Steenberg Wine/Golf Estate in the Cape. This involved investigating the Cape Wine route and also obtaining French and Italian wine expertise.\n\nIn 1999, Dave returned briefly to the UK but Africa was in his blood. On his return to South Africa he secured employment at Murray and Roberts where he worked from 2002 until his retirement in 2014. Since retiring, he has been kept more than busy with Freemasonry as well as supporting Wendy in her business endeavours. His one regret is not having enough time for Music, Golf or exercise.\n\nIt was during his work for Saref Project at JCI that Dave ran his first Comrades Marathon in 1984 which was inevitable as he had previously lived in Hillcrest and often drove the Comrades route.\n\nDave was initiated into Freemasonry in First Pride Lodge, becoming Master in 1996. He has been the master of most lodges of which he is a member and is currently Provincial Grand Senior Warden in the Royal Order of Scotland and has held District or Provincial Ranks in all 13 orders operating in South Africa and holds Grand rank in 7 of them. He is a Past Deputy District Grand Master in the Cryptic, Assistant District Grand Master in the Mark and is District Grand Prefect of the Allied Masonic Degrees of South Africa.\n\nHe met Wendy, a catering Manager, on contract with Fedics and they were married in December 2005 by Father Peter Roberts. To celebrate his 70th Birthday in 2014, Dave says that he was quite proud in managing to host nearly 200 persons seated in No. 1 Dining Room at Park Lane, and at the same time, managed to keep the details of the occasion a secret from all, particularly Wendy and daughter, Tania – a most difficult task !\n\nDave and Wendy enjoy weekend breaks in the bush but their greatest pleasure is cooking together, and visiting Dave’s son, Karl, in Ireland and daughter Tania in France and now in the Nederlands. Sadly, his eldest son, Mark, succumbed to lung cancer in 2010. Strangely he was the only member of the family never to take up smoking which Dave continues to this day, purely for the relief of stress, you understand.\n\nDISTRICT JUNIOR GRAND WARDEN – EUGENE BERNHARDT\n\nEugene was born on 15th July 1949 in Ermelo where his father was a PM of Concordia Lodge. He matriculated at Ermelo High school, after which he completed an apprenticeship in Refrigeration and Air-conditioning with the Transvaal Department of Works in Middelburg. He obtained a Higher National Diploma in the Mechanical and Electrical field and joined the Chief Engineer’s office in Pretoria, designing hospital equipment and installations ranging from Air-conditioning, Refrigeration, Coal fired Boilers, Autoclaves, Medical gasses and many more. This is where he met Joey in 1973 and they married in 1977 when he moved to Johannesburg, to control all refrigeration installations as well as the installation of the biggest air-conditioning system in the world at that time. In 2002 he was promoted to Deputy Director of Public Works and retired in 2009 after 40 years of service.\n\nJoey and Eugene have two sons. The eldest, Trevor, and his wife are both medical practitioners living in Calgary, Canada. They have two daughters and a son. Their son, Raymond, who is a manager with Auto & General, has two sons and lives in Centurion.\n\nHe was initiated into The Ionic Lodge in1994. His proposer was Uncle Charley Bernhardt and his seconder was Norman Hood. Hans van Gaalen was Master of The Ionic Lodge at that time. Eugene was the Master of The Ionic Lodge in 1999 and MEZ of Hillbrow R A Chapter in 2002. He is a Past Sovereign of Germiston Rose Croix Chapter, a 30th Degree mason and a founder member of the St Vitus Rose Croix Chapter, a Chapter founded to demonstrate the Intermediate degrees (4th – 17th), where he performed active roles in several degree presentations. He is a member of the South Africa North First Principals Chapter in the Royal Arch, and a Past Master of Transvaal District Grand Stewards Lodge.\n\nEugene has a passion for working with wood and is known for making all sorts of items for Masonry, masons, friends and family. He has made wands for the District Office, personalised wands for DC`s, DDC`s and ADC`s as well as Senior and Junior Deacons wands for various lodges. Gavels galore, Alms collection plates, Sets of Platonic bodies have been made for the District Office, Mauritius and Boksburg R A. He designed a unique bracket and secured all the seats in Park Lane, thereby extending their use by decades. The display cabinets in the foyer and library at Park Lane were also made by him. He is grateful for the opportunity of making some input to an organisation that has helped him shape his life and that gives satisfaction to many. He often surprises the ladies by making them chopping boards, tea trays and walking sticks for older folk.\n\nHe enjoys wild life and is a keen hunter. His wife Joey loves to accompany him to many Masonic Meetings, especially in the country areas and together they spend much time with their grandchildren.\n\nDISTRICT GRAND CHAPTER OFFICERS 2017-2018\n\nSOME THOUGHTS ON THE ROYAL ARCH – E.Comp Tim Smith\n\n“The brother who stops at the third degree is like a man who has erected an edifice without the coping stone. He is neither just to himself nor earnest in his search for truth.\n\nThe ceremonies and teachings of the other degrees are beautiful and full of significance. Yet they cannot be compared to the Royal Arch.\n\nThey speak of time, the Royal Arch speaks of what will be when time shall be no more. It carries us across the boundary into the presence of the infinite”.\n\nThe Royal Arch has been describe as “the root, heart and marrow of freemasonry”.\n\nDISTRICT GRAND SCRIBE NEHEMIAH – RICHARD LIPNICKI\n\nRichard Lipnicki was born at the end of the Second World War, in the UK in Northern Northumberland in the small village of Chatton. His father was an officer in the Polish Army who evacuated Europe via Dunkirk and was sent to Duns in Scotland for training with the First Polish Armoured Division. There he met his future wife, Mary, who was at college and they married in 1944.\n\nThe Lipnicki family emigrated to South Africa in 1950 and lived in Hillbrow. Richard attended local Primary Schools and then matriculated at King Edward VII School in Houghton.\n\nBy this time, the family had moved to a house in Berea which, as the crow flies, is about 500 me- tres from District Grand Lodge at Park Lane.\n\nRichard became an apprentice Tool & Die maker which was obviously the correct choice, as twenty three years later he started a successful engineering business, Chatton Manufacturing, named after his place of birth.\n\nOne day, while showing the family Irish Wolfhounds at Gillooly’s farm, he was asked by the then Goldfields Dog Club Chairman, a member of Doornfontein Lodge, why he was not a Mason. The reply was, “I was never asked.” This answer proved unsatisfactory to the Chairman. He instructed his Vice Chairman, Percy Green, “Make this man a Mason”.\n\nHe was initiated into The Boksburg Lodge in July 1987 and became Worshipful Master in 1996, again in 2008 and once more in 2011. Richard was appointed MEZ in the Boksburg Royal Arch in 1999, in 2002, 2003 and in 2009.\n\nRichard received Craft Grand Rank and was appointed by The Grand Master, The Duke of Kent, in April 2017 to Past Assistant Grand Director of Ceremonies.\n\nIn the Royal Arch, he has just been promoted to District GSN for the forthcoming year.\n\nRichard is a member of Calvary Rose Croix and was Sovereign in 2004 and 2005. He was promoted to the 30th degree in 2006.\n\nHis wife, Karen, has been a stalwart supporter during his Masonic career. Her support and assistance at fundraising events and catering at the Boksburg Lodges and Boksburg Royal Arch festive boards, is appreciated.\n\nKIT MARKOTTER RETIRES AFTER 38 YEARS – RON JACKSON (supersport.com)\n\nKit Markotter, one of the legends of South African amateur boxing, has retired as secretary of the Johannesburg Amateur Boxing Organisation after 38 years. He was also chairman for 35 years.\n\nHe is the only person to have received Springbok and Protea colours for managing SA amateur teams, and has also been awarded life membership of at least seven other boxing bodies, including Sanabo, the SA National Amateur Boxing Organisation.\n\nThis was not a bad record for someone who was not interested in boxing and rather disliked the sport when he was a youngster.\n\nWhen he was at school, Markotter played football. He turned out for a number of teams before joining the Ramblers Football Club in Johannesburg.\n\nAfter his first season at Ramblers he asked his brother Pat and another boxer, Johnny Watson, if he could work out at their Troyeville Boxing Club to keep fit for soccer.\n\nMarkotter was not over-eager to get involved in a new sport, but after a few months he agreed to take part in a tournament.\n\nIt was tougher than football. In his first fight he was knocked down three times in the first round and twice in the second. But thanks to his fitness he went on to win by a knockout.\n\nLittle did he know then that the bout would turn into a love affair with boxing; an affair that would go on for nearly 60 years, during which he would be involved as a boxer, trainer, manager, official and administrator. One should add ambassador, too.\n\nHe won a number of cups in 61 bouts from 1958 to 1967, and at featherweight, he won Johannesburg and District titles in 1960, 1961 and 1962, and also won the Border and Transvaal titles in 1962.\n\nHis surname may not provide a clue, but Markotter was born in Paddington, London. The date was 27 September 1933.\n\nHe was named Johannes Christopher, after his grandfathers. The nickname Kit apparently comes from Christopher.\n\nHis father, who was born in Uniondale in the Cape Province, had gone to London in 1931 to work for an insurance company. There he met Kit’s mother, who was also working at an insurance company.\n\nIn 1935 his father decided to return to South Africa and they settled in Johannesburg.\n\nTRAINING AND MATCHMAKING\n\nKit gave up boxing in 1968 and began helping with the training and matchmaking at the Yeoville Amateur Boxing Club.\n\nIn 1971 he was appointed treasurer of the Malvern Amateur Boxing Club and at one time he served on 12 boxing committees, of which he chaired eight.\n\nIn 1986 he received Springbok colours when he managed the SA team that toured Paraguay in South America. He was also manager of the Springbok team at the 1989 Interstate Games and of the 1992 Protea team at the Mozambique Independence tournament.\n\nIt made him the only person to have been awarded Springbok and Protea colours as manager of a national boxing team.\n\nHIS TRAVEL\n\nThanks to boxing, Markotter says, he had the privilege of travelling to 23 countries.\n\nHis services did not go unnoticed. He received merit awards and life membership of the Malvern Boxing Club, the Southern Transvaal Boxing Association, the Southern Transvaal Boxing Federation, the Transvaal Boxing Association and the Transvaal Boxing Federation, and the SA Amateur Boxing Association, as well as life membership of the SA National Amateur Boxing Organisation.\n\nAnd in 2000 he was the first recipient of the King Korn Golden Vest Award for his services to amateur boxing.\n\nShowing the same loyalty and diligence that made him such an outstanding sports administrator, Markotter worked for what was then known as the General Post Office.\n\nAfter 41 years, he retired in December 1992 as a postmaster in Johannesburg.\n\nKit is a prominent Mason who is a major driving force in Corona Lodge’s “Box and Dine”, which raises vast amounts of money for charity each year.\n\nCORONA LODGE 94.7 CYCLE CHALLENGE\n\nCorona Lodge will be entering a Charity team in the 94.7 Cycle challenge.

WM Golden Harvest Lodge No. 9234 E.C.\n\nThe dear ladies married to a Mason, Are very special for their inspiration.\n\nFor supporting us in what we aim to do, Maintaining the principles we believe is true.\n\n—oOo—oOo—\n\nAllowing us our time away from home, Not developing a solitariness syndrome.\n\nEven while at home the minds often are Masonically occupied, For word perfect addresses is our pride.\n\n—oOo—oOo—\n\nNot always so easy be assured, The minds often becomes obscured.\n\nSo, dear ladies, this poem is dedicated to you, We as Masons appreciate you through and through.\n\n—oOo—oOo—\n\nFor all your Love, Care, Patience and Support, We wish you all the Blessings of our Lord.\n\nEnjoy this feast, the least we can do to show our gratitude, For without your support, our Masonic careers are destitute.\n\nAs read by W.Bro. Frank Stock, PJGD (Eng).\n\nat the Golden Harvest Ladies Lunch, 5th August 2017.\n\nSIR DAVID HUGH WOOTTON , ASSTGM, VISITS PRESIDENT LODGE\n\nSir David Wootton is a British lawyer and politician. He was also the Lord Mayor of London between 2011 to 2012 and he is the Alderinan of Ward Langbourn.\n\nIn Masonic circles, Sir David oversees bursaries and the manner in which they are applied for Grand Lodge.\n\nWORKING TOOLS OF THE FOURTH DEGREE\n\nI, now present you with the working tools of the fourth degree. They are the fork – the knife and the\n\ntumbler\n\nThe fork – is an implement which enables even the most inexperienced Freemason to secure, sometimes by reaching across the table, the most delicate and succulent morsels which adorn our festive board, to delight the eye and stimulate the jaded appetite. This important implement is used to covey the various morsels to that aperture which has specially been designed to receive them, and which reduces all nutriment to a common level. The fork should always be used when partaking of peas which if conveyed to the mouth with the assistance of the knife, often proves very elusive.\n\nThe knife – when properly ground and sharpened is used to reduce all crude matter to a common level and assists us to dissect the anatomy of even the most venerable rooster,and bring all crude matter into due form. The knife also teaches us not to cut off more than we can chew, but to limit our desires in every station of life, so that rising to eminence by merit we may live respected and die regretted.\n\nThe tumbler – enables us with accuracy and precision to ascertain and determine\n\nThe quantity of liquor which we find quite conducive to the preservation of general joviality, and as all tumblers have not that mark upon them , commonly known as the “ pretty “, the skilful craftsman may measure his tot with the aid of two or more fingers rule. But as the tumbler will only hold a certain quantity with detriment to its surroundings. It teaches us that we should ascertain and never exceed the limits of our own internal economy.\n\nBut, brethren as we are not met here this evening as speculative but rather as energetic and operative free masons, we apply these tools to our morals.\n\nIn this sense – the fork– teaches us that we should not always sit down and wait for what we most desire, but to reach out, secure and retain it profiting by our opportunities and assimilating the knowledge gained by our experiences, nor should we forget that the little things of life should be looked after, should we forget that the little things in life should be looked after lest they elude our grasp and are lost beyond recall.\n\nAs the prongs of the fork are all equal and mutually assist one another, being joined together in one compact structure, so we as free masons should stand shoulder to shoulder and practice those four qualifications which cannot be too strongly recommended to your notice :- straight forwardness in our dealings with another; sympathy with the feelings of a brother good temper in our differences of opinion, and fidelity to the sacred ties which binds us together.\n\nThe knife – teaches us the value of assiduity and patience to cope with many of the problems which confront it, so we are taught to take care of our mental and corporeal faculties.\n\nThe tumbler – teaches us the importance of moderation and temperance. As it is has no graduated scale by which to measure it’s varying contents the user must exercise his judgement as to the quantity of liquor he pours therein, for as the tumbler will hold a limited quantity without detriment to it’s surroundings so we should estimate our capacity and not confuse our mental or physical equilibrium.\n\nThe perfect tumbler rings true, no matter whether it is empty or it is filled with liquor, so the perfect convivial free mason should ring true after labour in the fourth degree. A cracked tumbler is despised and rejected.\n\nThus brethren the working tools of the convivial free mason teach us to practice and bear in mind cardinal virtues – of temperance and prudence – so that when we may be summoned to rise to drink the tyler’s toast after having partaken of the good things provided by a bounteous providence for our use, we may depart homeward with a gratifying testimony of a contented mind. A clean brain and an equal poise.\n\n– Bro. Nicolaas Jacobus Trytsman (1952)\n\nMESSAGE FROM THE DISTRICT GRAND MASTER\n\n– RW Bro. Prof. Guy Charlesworth\n\nAs we approach the Festive Season, I would like to extend to you and your family my very best wishes for a Blessed Christmas and to members of the Jewish faith, a Happy Festival of Chanukah.\n\nWe have had a most successful Masonic year in our District. Not only have we addressed the needs of our Brethren, but we have also made a conscious effort to assist those in Society less fortunate than ourselves.\n\nWe look forward to celebrating 300 years of English Freemasonry next year. Whilst we reflect on the past, we also look to the future of this wonderful Order and may the New Year bring Peace, Joy and Good Health to you and your loved ones.\n\nTHE DISTRICT OF S.A. NORTH – CHARITY BANQUET\n\n– W Bro. Brian Kretzschmar\n\nOn the evening of Friday the 4th of March 2016, the District of S.A. North held their annual charity banquet in Parktown. A chilly breeze followed the guests between the towering pillars of our lodge and into the reception room for a warming sherry. It was an opportunity for renewing acquaintances and enjoying friendships. The ladies looked resplendent in their evening wear.\n\nGentle music accompanied guests to our refurbished dining room which was splendidly decorated in District blue.\n\nThe District Director of Ceremonies, W Bro. Simon Knutton, opened proceedings with his usual aplomb, ensuring that proceedings flowed with ease.\n\nHe then introduced the District Grand Master, Right Worshipful Brother Professor Guy Charlesworth, who gave an enjoyable speech of welcome and proposed the toasts.\n\nA delicious three course meal with wines was followed by coffee.\n\nThen to the highlight of the evening – the charity donations to our honoured guests.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Rands are donated from lodges directly to charities of their choice, with a portion being presented to the DGM to donate to charities at his discretion, with guidance from his Boards.\n\nThis year our major donation was to HEADWAY – an organization dedicated to the physical rehabilitation of people with brain injuries.\n\nThe second major donation was to Amazing Grace; an orphanage where we built a laundry, as well as work and storage facilities which form a part of our capital project strategy.\n\nOther recipients included:\n\nThe Hero Burns Unit – Pretoria (W Bro. George Watson).\n\nGreen Beings – solar lights for schools in Cosmo City (W Bro. Brian Kretzschmar). Helping S.A.’s Elderly Care Project (W Bro. Brian Kretzschhmar).\n\nIMPILO – child protection and adoption services (W Bro. Richard Moore).\n\nThe Gordon Foudation – Swaziland school project (Swaziland and St George’s Lodges). Coach – a coalition of Anglican Childrens’ Homes (W Bro. Brian Kretzschmar).\n\nThese projects would not be possible without the magnificent charity efforts of all the brethren in our District. Well done!\n\nGRAND LODGE AND SUPREME GRAND CHAPTER APPOINTMENTS 2016\n\n– W Bro.

It took 18 months to be made a Master Mason and I was informed that it could take more than 25 years to become the WM.\n\nThe Lodge had a Lodge of Instruction which met every Monday evening and was operational from September to May, I joined on the Monday after my Initiation and found this to be a good grounding.\n\nIn 1974 I was exalted into the RA, something new and exciting.\n\nI was fortunate to be able to attend every one of my Craft meetings and was a willing participant. I slow- ly climbed the ladder through every office, finally becoming WM in 1980. After completing my year as IPM; my wife, Val, and our two sons and I moved to South Africa.\n\nIn 1983 I joined New Horizons Lodge in Roodepoort, becoming WM in 1987. I had previously also joined Doornfontein RA Chapter in 1984.\n\nMy first district appointment was PDAGDC in 1991. I will then promoted to Steward in 1996, DAGDC in 1997; DJGD in 1999; PDJGW in 2001 and PDSGW in 2006.\n\nI became the caterer at Freemasons’ Hall in 2001, a job I continued until 2009. During this period I became interested in all the other Degree’s in Freemasonry and joined Mark, Royal Ark Mariners, Royal & Select Masters (Cryptic), Order of the Secret Monitor and Allied Masonic Degrees which added to those I had already joined United Orders of the Temple (KT), Knight Templar Priests, Rose Croix, Red Cross of Constantine, Royal Order of Scotland and lastly the Operatives.\n\nIn 2016, the DGM offered me the position of DSGW. To say that I was speechless could not describe the emotions that coursed through me. I realised that after 48 years as a mason, I had achieved the greatest honour. It goes to show, that you are never too old.\n\nMy wife, coming from a Masonic family, has been completely supportive of my Masonic career, and my goal driven need to do the best that I can in every field I tackle.\n\nI do believe that there is more for me to achieve given the opportunity and I relish the challenge, which keeps me young at heart and strengthens the mind.\n\nDISTRICT JUNIOR GRAND WARDEN – PAUL KNIGHT\n\nI was born in Glasgow Scotland in 1949 and was educated in both England and Scotland. My tertiary education was in Scunthorpe Lincolnshire. I emigrated with my wife Anita and our two children to South Africa in October 1979, I worked for Union Corporation as a draughtsman on a three year contract…I’m still here !\n\nI was initiated into Lodge Cornwall No. 3490 on 9th May 1991 and raised to the sublime degree of a Master Mason on 11th May 1992. I Joined Fordsburg Lodge No. 2718 in April 1997 and went through the chair for the first time in 1999; again in 2002 / 2003 and 2010 / 2011.\n\nMy first District appointment was in 2004 as a District Grand Steward, then In 2005 I was appointed District Grand Pursuivant. All other promotions have been to Past rank until my promotion to District Junior Grand Warden.\n\nAt the present time I am also Master of Transvaal District Grand Steward’s Lodge.\n\nIn the Royal Arch, I was Exalted into Clarendon Royal Arch Chapter on 19th August 1993 and went through the First Principal’s chair for the first time in February 2002 and again in 2008,2009 and 2010. My first District appointment was as an Assistant District Grand Director of Ceremonies in 2006. In 2010, I was appointed District Deputy Grand Director of Ceremonies, a post I held for two years.\n\nI thoroughly enjoy my Masonry and as a consequence I belong to all the Orders available in Johannesburg. That is the Mark (PAGDC), Royal Ark Mariner (Grand Rank), Rose Croix (30° ), Red Cross of Constantine (PGPref.), Royal Order of Scotland, Knights Templar (PG Aide-de-Camp), Knight Templar Priests, Allied Masonic Degrees (PGSD), Secret Monitor (PDStd Br), Operatives (7°), and Cryptic Council of which I am the District Grand Master.\n\nI am looking forward to my year as District Junior Grand Warden being able to interact with all the Brethren that I have previously met and also meeting new brethren on my Masonic Journey.\n\nTHE HOLY ROYAL ARCH – ENJOYMENT, RECRUITMENT, RETENTION\n\n– Speech by E Comp The Rev Elkan Levy to Supreme Grand Chapter\n\nThe Royal Arch is a most beautiful degree. It stands beyond Craft Masonry as the culmination of the candidate’s journey through pure Antient Masonry.\n\nThe beautiful lesson that this degree teaches, places man in the context of eternity. A brother becomes a complete Mason when he takes the Holy Royal Arch, and it is therefore our duty to ensure that this degree is as widely disseminated as possible.\n\nHowever, because Chapter deals with a different set of relationships, it will appeal to brethren on a different level to the Craft, and partly for different reasons. To those who find it attractive, the Royal Arch is a never-ending source of interest, study reflection and self-awareness. In many ways, it is the serious Mason’s degree.\n\nRecruitment is a problem, and this is for reasons that significantly go beyond Freemasonry. We live in a world where people tend not to join organisations, with the possible exception of the health club.\n\nReligious bodies of all denominations, Rotary, Scouts, clubs of various types, all suffer from the effect that television and the Internet is having on human behaviour.\n\nIsolation and loneliness can readily occur in the midst of crowds. All of us here know the warm sense of brotherhood and friendship that comes with membership of Freemasonry. The Holy Royal Arch is known as the friendly degree; we should stress this when recruiting, and welcome the candidates with genuine warmth.\n\nRecruitment to the Royal Arch will increase in proportion to the publicity that we give to it within our own Lodges, and the image we project. Chapter should be seen as something special, and membership of the Degree as an exaltation, a higher sense of Freemasonry. Masters of Craft Lodges should be encouraged to take wine, at least once a year, with Companions of Chapters – any Chapter, not just the one moored to that particular Lodge.\n\nIf there is a Chapter closely involved with the Lodge, the names of the Principals could be publicised within the Lodge. The respect that junior brethren tend to feel towards senior members of their Lodges could then be channelled into joining those brethren in the Lodge’s Chapter.\n\nThe candidate would be able, should he so wish, to complete his journey through pure Antient Masonry in company with those brethren with whom he is already familiar. We need to stress the brotherhood of Masonry.\n\nRetention will often be a question of involvement. The new ritual, more comprehensible and understandable, can easily be mastered in bite-sized chunks.\n\nNot everyone will work the ritual to the same high standard. Inevitably there will be variations, but a sense of enjoyment and participation will carry the Chapter along, and raise its standards.\n\nThose that need help, will be helped and encouraged. We need to explain the Royal Arch to its new exaltees, and we need to encourage them in a non-judgemental way.\n\nProgress is not always easy – many Companions can only progress with difficulty, but we must help them to do so, even if only an inch at a time.\n\nThe more a Companion participates, the more he gets involved, the more will he feel a sense of belonging to his Chapter, and the loyalty that follows from ownership. Retention will become much easier, and those Companions who are happy in their Chapters will themselves bring in\n\ntheir brethren from the Craft, Finally, enjoyment. There is no point in being a miserable Freemason. Freemasonry in its widest sense, and particularly this Degree, with its interesting and dramatic story, its strong sense of morality, its deep lesson and its happy atmosphere, is here to be enjoyed, not to be endured.\n\nFreemasonry is important in today’s society. It encourages mutual respect and tolerance, qualities that are becoming increasingly necessary in a progressively fractured world. It adheres to standards of morality and behaviour in a society that seems increasingly unable to tell right from wrong.\n\nBut, most of all, it is fun. The grand design of being happy and communicating happiness affects and benefits us all. The Royal Arch is there to be enjoyed. If we can communicate our sense of enjoyment, all the rest – recruitment, retention, growth – will inevitably follow.\n\nMozart enjoyed being a Freemason – so should we!\n\nA PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS: INSTALLATION BANQUET OF THE LODGE OF FRIENDSHIP, September 2016 – MAURITIUS\n\nLODGE OF DISCOVERY IN PORT VILA, VANUATU – REBUILDS A SCHOOL LIBRARY\n\n– W Bro. Russell Chilton\n\nThose in Vanuatu who experienced Tropical Cyclone Pam will always remember the night of Friday the 13th March 2016. The category five cyclone swept across the Pacific and glanced across many of the islands in the archipelago bringing destruction to buildings, crops, trees and livelihoods with it’s 270kph winds gusting up to a reported 320kph.\n\nMere days after the cyclone passed, Grand Charity in London released £20,000 via Red Cross for immediate relief and soon Lodge of Discovery was receiving\n\npledges from Lodges and Masonic organisations around the world. A committee was quickly tasked with managing the incoming funds and finding a suitable project to assist the rebuild of critical infrastructure for the local community. The Lodge wanted a local recipient, as this would give them more control over the costs and a collateral benefit to the Lodge.\n\nA local group who were already building new classrooms for a community school before the cyclone, approached the Lodge sub-committee for help. The school bore the brunt of the winds and most of its buildings had suffered damage including the library that was now beyond repair. Brethren looked at the plans, inspected the site and judged it to suit the criteria set out.\n\nThe Lodge suggested moving the site of the library to a more central base to the whole school and, with some cost savings, increased the original footprint to include a media centre so that the school would benefit from the building into the future. The Lodge insisted that the project engineer inspect the library every year and produce a report in order that regular maintenance could be scheduled. A local builder and workforce were employed solely for the library to keep consistency throughout the build.\n\nAfter about three months the Suango School Library/Media Centre was completed. A handover ceremony was arranged to coincide with a regular meeting of the Lodge, which saw a delegation of Brethren present for the ceremony. They were brought on to the school grounds by local dancers and presented with traditional salou-salou garlands before both parties gave speeches. The WM spoke about the importance of education and continued learning, then asked Lodge Secretary and Grand Officer, W.Bro Alan Churchill to formally open the school and handover the keys.\n\nW.Bro Russell Chilton is the DC at Lodge of Discovery, Vanuatu; Chairman of the Post-Cyclone Relief Fund; and Past Master of Corinthian Lodge, Pretoria.\n\nWE CARE – W Bro. Dick Glanville\n\nOn Saturday 5th December 2015 a NPO (We Care) organised a Christmas function for guests from old age homes and retirement centres around Johannesburg. The residents of these retirement centres are not in a position to enjoy such festivities without assistance. Most have little or no in- come, other than a pension.\n\nA few Masonic Lodges became involved in this worthwhile cause by raising funds, donating food and offering physical assistance. In 2015, the luncheon was held at the Church of the Blessed Sacrament in Malvern East and 400 deserving senior citizens were treated to a wonderful festive spread. The food was plentiful and guests were encouraged to take extra food home with them.\n\nThe Lodges which were involved in this cause included; Prosperity and Doornfontein Lodges, who between them raised in excess of R10 000. Members of both lodges and their families were also on hand, before and after the event to offer assistance.\n\nIt was heart-warming to see “the old folk” thoroughly enjoying the festivities. Various local com- munities laid on wonderful entertainment including Portuguese song-and-dance troupes in full costume, local singers, a disco and much more. The party was thoroughly enjoyed by all.\n\nOver-and-above the Christmas lunches, the We Care organisation arranges transport to take the elderly to hospital and for doctor’s appointments. They also organise fun days, tea parties and are involved in fund raising for blanket drives and feeding schemes. I hope that more lodges will become involved with We Care in the future.\n\nWIDOWS SONS SOUTH AFRICA UPDATE – W Bro. Lance Epstein\n\nTime flies when you are having fun, or so the saying goes. Since our last communique in the November 2015 issue of the Cornerstone, The Widows Sons South Africa has grown in leaps and bounds! Let me remind you of their mantra “Masons FIRST and Widows Sons thereafter”. I can report that the synergy between Freemasonry and Widows Sons has proved itself time and again over the last few months.\n\nThe Widows Sons is made up of members of all four constitutions (EC, SC, IC and GLSA), and the support between the lodges has been simply outstanding. This can be seen by the attendance at the Norwood Lodge initiation where 55 masons were present, almost half of whom were members of Widows Sons or guests.\n\nDuring 2016, the Widows Sons had their first ever National Gathering in South Africa at which, the first Widows Sons Branding Ceremony was held in KZN. The weekend was arranged by the Widows Sons, KZN Chapter, where there were over 100 Widows Sons members, associates, family and friends in attendance.\n\nThe National President of the Widows Sons Bro. William Bowers, who visited the Widows Sons in the USA in 2015, rode up from the Cape with 5 Widows Sons from the USA and Canada. The meet and greet was followed by the AGM where the South African Chapter was handed its Alliance membership.\n\nWidows Sons of the South African Chapter has now grown to over 220 members.\n\nThis confirms our official recognition of the patents and emblems associated with the Widows Sons. The next day, a convoy of more than 70 bikes rode from Amanzimtoti to Margate. It was a proud moment, Widows Sons riding in the name of Freemasonry.\n\nIn June, Widows Sons from the Cape and Gauteng travelled to Port Elizabeth where a new Chapter received their charter. The Eastern Cape Chapter, “Spirit of Hiram” received their charter on Saturday the 18th June, followed by one of the Widows Sons being installed to the chair of KS. The brethren then travelled back to Gauteng and the Cape stopping at various Masonic temples and an impressive museum in Steinsburg on their return.\n\nThe Widows Sons embraces the lesson of the NE corner charge and uses every opportunity to help those in need. In terms of charities, each Chapter has a cause that they contribute towards:\n\nThe East Coast Chapter, KZN , assisted Lake Haven in Sea Cow Lakes, a home of safety for children that burned down. 8 kids passed away and the rest left destitute. East Coast Radio put out an appeal for assistance and the Widows Sons answered the call, arranging donations, food hampers and clothing.\n\nCentral Chapter, Gauteng, has adopted the “Sunshine Home 4 Kids”, a place of safety for children removed by the court. The home currently has 13 children between 3 months and 15 years of age. The home is a registered NGO and the Chapter has been working with SAPS assisting with urgent matters. The Brethren, ladies and friends of the Widows Sons have been extremely generous with donations in various forms, be it sponsoring a day out, cleaning utensils or simply giving of their time. Charity is after all, not just about money.\n\nEast Rand (ER) Chapter, Gauteng, is in the process of identifying a needy charity to adopt and support. Originally under consideration was the Jubilee Home, a place of safety for children removed by the court. A recent recce to the home, which has 80 children between the ages of 2 months and 15 years old, was conducted by the Leadership and members of ER Chapter. This initial visit involved a small function consisting of gift packs and entertainment for the children, followed by a walk-through of the facility and a meeting with the management. It was revealed that this home is already well supported and the members of the ER Chapter have decided to consider other facilities which are not in this fortunate position.\n\nThe Widows Sons has added another dimension to Freemasonry, nothing new, just a band of merry men, ably assisted by their ladies in being part of a rider’s association where one continues the brotherly love, relief and truth, simply extended into what we do when we are not at lodge\n\n– ride bikes!\n\nWebsite – www.wssa-central.co.za\n\nCharity begins at Home\n\nRW Bro. Prof. Guy Charlesworth, District Grand Master\n\nThe 300th Anniversary of Grand Lodge is fast approaching. Plans to celebrate this unique occasion in Freemasonry in 2017 are being set-up by all Provinces and Districts throughout the Constitution worldwide.\n\nWithin our District, the planning committee for the Tercentenary celebrations chaired by W Bro. Graeme MacKenzie is making excellent progress. They will be announcing our District’s plans in due course. Every Lodge, however, is encouraged to plan their own celebrations for 2017. Let W Bro. MacKenzie know what events you have planned in good time, so we can share in your celebrations.\n\nAt the District Annual Meeting held in October, I had the great pleasure of announcing the establishment of the Tercentenary District Samaritan Fund, which will run from February 2016 through to October 2017.\n\nThe aim is to raise a minimum amount of R1 Million by individual donations from our Members at a minimum of R1500 per Member. This donation will be marked by a breast jewel of a design to be approved by Grand Lodge. Double and Tertiary quotas will be recognised by adding a distinguishing bar to the ribbon of the jewel.\n\nImportantly, this new Tercentenary District Samaritan Fund will be raised by Masons for Masons, their wives or partners and their families. It will allow the existing Samaritan Fund to be expanded to also include applications for grants-in-aid to a family where the wage-earner has been made redundant, to give support for hearing aids, dentistry and optician’s work and other minor medical procedures and to assist with funeral costs where necessary.\n\nThis Samaritan Fund will address a gap between those grants available from the Transvaal Inter- constitutional Masonic Charity (TIMC) on the one hand and assistance from the Grand Lodge Samaritan Fund in London, on the other hand. Our regular subscriptions to the TIMC from the District allow applications to be made to the TIMC for grants-in-aid for widows and pensioners and educational grants, where there is a demonstrable financial need. Applications can also be made through the Grand Lodge portal of “Freemasonry Cares” to the Grand Lodge Samaritan Fund for assistance to cover major medical operations, again where there is a demonstrable medical and financial need.\n\nWithin our District, 2015 has been called “The Year of The Almoner” and the Almoners’ Programme forms one of my strategic initiatives in the District.\n\nThe Almoner is one of the most important officers in the Lodge. A good Almoner can play a fundamental and important role in the Care and Welfare of the Brethren and their families.\n\nIt is absolutely essential that the Almoner is aware of his duties and performs them well. I have recently sent a memo to all Lodges to encourage Masters Elect to revert to the wording of the investiture of the Almoner as previously practised in our District. The DC team will be in contact with Masters Elect. The address is reproduced here as it clearly summa- rises the duties of the Almoner:\n\n“Bro…………I appoint you Almoner of the Lodge and I now invest you with the jewel of your office which is a scrip-purse upon which is a heart.\n\nThe high importance of the office is seldom realised as it is not clearly defined in our rituals.\n\nYou must at all times be the link between the Lodge and sick Brethren and wherever there is a need for the relief of distress, you will endeavour to see that every deserving case is brought before the Lodge for sympathetic consideration.\n\nA good Almoner is one who notices who is not in Lodge, finds out why and reports to the Worshipful Master.\n\nIt calls for the sacrifice of your time and the satisfaction that you will derive from knowing that no sick or absent Brother has been neglected or that no Brother’s widow has been forgotten will more than compensate for the zeal and effort which I know you will apply to your duties.\n\nI also present to you the Almoner’s Manual which has been prepared by District to assist you with your duties.”\n\nOur Members of the Board of Benevolence have successfully given PowerPoint presentations on the duties of the Almoner to most of the Lodges in the District. New Almoners’ Manuals have been prepared and distributed, together with information in an electronic format.\n\nImportantly, the Board has also amassed a great deal of information in the Manual on those Service Providers offering discounted costs on dentistry, spectacles, hearing aids and undertakers etc., for pensioners and for those in need.\n\nGrateful thanks are extended for the superb work carried out by W Bro. Brian Kretzschmar, President of the Board of Benevolence and the Members of the Board of Benevolence; W Bros Chris Adams, David Baker, Howard Freeman, Dirk Norton, Dr Ron Poole, Bryan Price, Guss Southgate and Jeff Spiller.\n\nAs this year draws to a close, let us all be aware of the important work that a good Almoner can do for the members of our Lodges and their families. The establishment of a new Samaritan Fund will certainly allow us to address the needs in our Masonic community.\n\nDISTRICT SENIOR GRAND WARDEN – W BRO.

COMP. BARRY WINTER\n\nBarry’s exposure to Freemasonry started at a very young age when he used to attend the children’s Christmas parties held by the Acacia Lodge each year. His Grandfather and Uncle were both members of the Acacia Lodge and Chapter. After the death of his Grandfather, his uncle, W Bro. Hubert Wright, continued to encourage Barry to pursue Masonry.\n\nBarry was initiated in to Acacia Lodge in 1983 and became Master in 1990 and again in 2003. Barry’s installation as Master was particularly sentimental as it was exactly 50 years after his Grandfather was installed in the chair.\n\nHe was exalted into the Acacia Royal Arch Chapter in 1986 and became the MEZ in 1995 and again in 2012. His investiture was again 50 years after his Grandfather was received the same honour (albeit in the Boksburg Chapter).\n\nBarry later joined the Boksburg Chapter and was invested as the MEZ in 2012.\n\nBarry was perfected into the Rose Croix in 1992 and was enthroned as the MWS in 1998. A position he held for 2 years. In June this year, he was promoted to the 31°.\n\nHe joined the Knights Templar in 1996 and was installed as the Eminent Preceptor in 2000. Again, exactly 50 years after his Grandfather and in the same Preceptory (Keystone). He received Great Priory honours in 2009.\n\nThe Royal Arch has always been Barry’s passion and after serving three years as the Deputy District Grand Director of Ceremonies in the past, he views being promoted to the office of District Grand Scribe Nehemiah as a huge honour and an opportunity to re-kindle the friendships he has made during his Masonic journey.\n\nBarry is the National Vice President, as well as the President of the East Rand Chapter of the Windows Sons. An Association started in 2010 for Brethren who wanted to ride motorcycles together.\n\nBarry’s wife, Colleen and children, Adell and Rocky have supported him in all his Masonic activities which have inevitably left him with many lifelong friends\n\nWIDOWS SONS SOUTH AFRICA – W Bro. Lance Epstein\n\nWidows Sons was founded in 1999 by a brother in North America who believed there was a need for a ‘Riders Association” made up of Masons with the purpose of looking after Widows of Masons – nothing different to what Masonry teaches us!\n\nWith this in mind the first Chapter was started in South Africa in 2010 with the inaugural ride being on the 18th July, 2010 and is simply called Widows Sons South Africa (WSSA). This Chapter is now the governing body, as such, and the original members have remained members and all Presidents and Vice Presidents sit on the committee.\n\nAs one can predict, no sooner was the WSSA founded when there was a need to have other Chapters to cover the various geographic areas. With this in mind the following Chapters were founded:\n\nEast Rand Chapter – Sons of Hiram\n\nWest Rand Chapter – Templars\n\nWestern Cape Chapter – Hirams Ashlars\n\nBloemfontein Chapter – Sons of Solomon\n\nThis year the Central Chapter or Knights of the Craft were founded and already has over 20 members. The KZN Chapter / East Coast “Tylers Swords” was also handed their charter this year and we are all meeting in Harrismith on Sunday 22 November for our year-end meet and greet. We are currently looking at opening a chapter in the Eastern Cape. The current membership is approx.120.\n\nThe brethren ride with colours / patches and abide by club rules as per the by-laws of each club. It is important to note that we are not a MC, but rather a Riders Association. We are governed by the BOC and require every Mason and therefore Widows Son (WS) to abide by the laws of South Africa.\n\nThe different clubs have planned official rides and attend what is called in the biker community “Day Jols” where the brethren and their “pillions” attend other bikers’ functions and support them with their various charities.\n\nOne always imagines bikers as rough and tough and a bunch of hooligans! From my involvement in the WS, I have only seen what Freemasonry has taught us; brotherly love, relief and truth. WS are engaged in supporting a number of charities and have donated funds to a Masonic Home (Roslyn Park) and attended PAWS for People, with various donations. One of the more heartwarming moments was when the brethren attended a children’s home (East Rand Children’s Haven) and arrived with presents – the function aptly named “Christmas in July”\n\nNext year the WS are having their Grand gathering in KZN where a number of Brethren from the USA will attend and assist with the Branding Ceremony – a first in SA and a column for the next Cornerstone.\n\nIn conclusion, if you have a bike (400CC and over) and are interested, please look us up on\n\nwww.wssa-central.co.za or call us on 083 600 0006. Come and meet the brethren, even ride with us socially. We do encourage the partners to join and they have their own Lady Member patch.\n\nThe next time you see a biker in those leathers, consider he could be your doctor, lawyer, mechanic, financial advisor or just a brother, riding for a cause – a good cause.\n\nTHE HOLY ROYAL ARCH – E. Comp Tim Smith\n\nWAYS TO IMPROVE THE PROFILE OF THE ORDER\n\nThe Royal Arch is the completion of Pure and Antient Masonry, but exaltation into the Order should be neither hurried or obligatory. Whilst not all Craft brethren will wish to take this final step immediately after being raised, it is hoped that the enjoyment and essence of the order be communicated to all Brethren.\n\nWe need to raise the profile of the Order and show it to be appealing, inspiring and relevant.\n\nIn order to achieve this, a strategic working party was set up in March 2012 by Grand Chapter. They made the following recommendations, many of which we now use as guidelines:\n\nThe strap line “initiation to exaltation” should be adopted to promote the Order, which is the basis of pure and ancient freemasonry and the completion of the third degree. This is extremely important and should be clearly understood as the correct path to follow in the ma- sonic\n\nMentoring should align with that of the Craft. Here it was suggested that a Master Mason’s Mentor should work with a Royal Arch Representative to actively guide the brother towards membership of the Royal Arch, where appropriate. Furthermore, that once exalted, the new companion is mentored toward a better understanding of both the ceremony and the\n\nThe role of the Lodge Royal Arch Representative is fundamental to the promotion of the Order and it is recommended that District Grand Lodge continues to encourage Craft Lodges to make this appointment and to develop that\n\nIn our District, our current practice is to present a letter to the newly raised Master Mason on the merits of the Royal Arch. This practice is highly recommended in order to improve the profile of the Order and help potential exaltees to have a better understanding of the Royal Arch.\n\nFurther ways to promote the Order include; the taking of wine with Royal Arch members at selected Craft festive boards and wearing the official Royal Arch tie at Craft meetings. This has already been approved by the\n\nIt is recommended that Chapters maintain relationships with the Lodges from which they usually derive their\n\nThe introduction of ‘SETTING THE SCENE’ is the perfect opportunity to re-engage with previous members of the Order, who may have not understood the exaltation ceremony, as this puts the three location changes into perspective and adds clarity to the\n\nIn conclusion Companions, never regret what you have done in Freemasonry, only what you have not.\n\nMAURITIUS 2015 – W Bro. Lance Epstein\n\nEvery year in September, a team of District Officers travels to Mauritius to assist and take part in the various Installations of Lodges under the UGLE and Additional Orders. It is also an opportunity to take our partners for a week of sun, fun and Masonic events.\n\nThis year, most folk arrived on Sunday the 4th September at the hotel of their choice, The Sands Resort & Spa in Flic ’n Flac. After a pleasant flight, our hosts and brethren of the Phoenix Lodge arranged for the SA delegation to attend the Master Elect’s function at the Gymkhana Club. This function was at- tended by Masons and their partners and marked the start of the week-long festivities.\n\nThis year, we were fortunate enough to have from the Craft, W Bro Chris van Gaalen, Asst DGM as the officiating officer who was accompanied by the District Grand Master, RW Bro Prof Guy Charlesworth. The District Grand Master of the Mark, RW Bro David Gurney and the District Grand Supreme Ruler of the OSM, Rt Worthy Bro Brian McDermott and his Deputy and Assistant were also present. The team also included other distinguished brethren.\n\nThe first installation was that of Phoenix Lodge which saw more than 90 brethren in attendance. This was followed by a dinner at the Lodge and presentation of gifts from the new WM to all the brethren.\n\nDuring leisure time, the week was spent enjoying the delights of the island which for some, Mike Edy in particular, who wore a pair of Surfer / Board shorts with the SA flag design, chose to “lounge” around the pool taking in the view and the entertainment, and even joined in the water aerobics.\n\nOthers chose to visit the sights the island had to offer. For some it was their first visit and toured the island from Grand Baie in the North to Flic ’n Flac in the South. Some simply re- laxed at the hotel, while others chose to do some R&R scuba diving!\n\nThe installations took place in the evenings followed by a banquet. I say banquet, as this is what these do’s were! Feasts fit for a King!! The hospitality and generosity shown by the brethren of Mauritius is extremely special and their love for Masonry is unbelievable. Their ritual during the ceremonies was well-rehearsed and of a high standard.\n\nWe also attended Lodge of Friendship No.1686, Master Elect’s dinner. This was another prestigious event held at a Chinese restaurant with our partners. The evening was absolutely splendid and a good time was had by all.\n\nThe end of the week fast approached and the brethren and partners were yet again entertained by our Mauritian brethren. On Friday, we were treated to a trip on a brother’s Catamaran and others were taken on a speedboat to Ile Aux Cerf island (known as the Deer island) where one could take part in a host of activities from simply lounging on the beach to Paragliding for the more sports minded like Lancelot! The day culminated in a braai on the island with a little Mauritian rum! A special thank you to our host.\n\nOn Saturday, while the brethren attend- ed the RA and LOF Craft Installations, the ladies gathered at the hotel and ensured their last day together was well spent!\n\nThe Installation ended with a gala dinner at Le Pirogue Hotel with over 100 guests. This function was also used as an opportunity to thank the official representatives attending and all the ladies and brethren received generous gifts. Two brethren from Johannesburg walked away with two of the bigger raffle prizes, one being a 2 night all-inclusive stay at Le Pirogue.\n\nSadly, the Masonic Meetings and festivities came to an end as brethren needed to catch a flight early Sunday morning.\n\nIn closing, one could only wish for an extended stay or a return to the island. A visit to Mauritius is special in many ways. The hospitality, friendship, fellowship and sincerity shown by our brethren of the island is greatly appreciated.\n\nCONGRATULATIONS TO KIT MARKOTTER, PDSGW, PM CORONA LODGE\n\n– RW Bro. Prof. Guy Charlesworth\n\nFor his service to his lodge, to the District and to the Community, Kit Markotter has been present- ed with the District Grand Master’s Certificate of Service.\n\nKit continues to serve Corona Lodge well, he was initiated in 1989, served as Master in 1998 and has continued to serve as Lodge Almoner for over 14 years.\n\nHe has held several active offices in District including, DistGStB, DistSGD and notably, DistG Swd Bearer. You will still see Kit on the circuit, as he volunteers to fill-in as Sword Bearer or Standard Bearer, whenever necessary, which is much appreciated.\n\nNot many of you will be aware, for the past 50 years, Kit Markotter has been involved as a boxer, trainer, manager, official and administrator in boxing. Kit has served for over 33 years as Chairman of the Johannesburg Amateur Boxing Organisation, a position he still holds today.\n\nSince 1975, he has been the manager of 19 regional, provincial and national teams and he is the only person to have been awarded Springbok and Protea colours as manager of a national boxing team.\n\nIn recognition of his service to boxing, he has received several merit awards and life membership of at least seven other Boxing Federations and Associations. Notably, in 2000 he was the first recipient of the King Korn Golden Vest Award for his services to amateur boxing.\n\nIn 1980, 35 years ago, Kit was instrumental in combining his love of Masonry and his love of Boxing to establish the Corona Gentleman’s Boxing evening or the Corona Box and Dine.\n\nIndeed, this event has been the major contributor to the District Grand Charities for the past 35 years. Long may it continue.\n\nWitwatersrand Lodge Centenary – www.witslodge.org.za\n\nWits Lodge is 100 years old and celebrated their Centenary on Tuesday 15 September 2015 at Park Lane, Johannesburg.\n\nWits Lodge was consecrated in 1915 as Transvaal Masters Lodge and was changed to Witwatersrand Lodge in 1949. The longest serving member of the Lodge is the current Master,W Bro. Ron Webster. All the previous Past Masters took turns conducting meetings during the year.\n\n73 visitors, including the District Grand Master, the Deputy District Grand Master, three Assistant District Grand Masters and numerous Grand Officers were in attendance at the centenary meeting. Eighteen members of the Lodge were present, out of a possible twenty non-country members. Seventy brethren sat down to a sumptuous dinner, following the meeting.\n\nDuring the meeting, the Worshipful Master presented the DGM with a cheque for R100 0000, R70 000 for the District Charity and R 30 000 for the District Samaritan Fund.\n\nAt the same meeting a new banner was dedicated by W Bro. Dr. Deacon V van Wyk, the District Grand Chaplain, and can be seen in the photograph.\n\nDISTRICT GRAND BANQUET 2015 – W Bro. Brian Kretzschmar\n\nOn Saturday the 30th May 2015, the District Grand Banquet was held in the Rainbow Room at the Johannesburg Country Club. It was a prestigious occasion. Welcome drinks, a superb three course dinner with wines followed by coffee.\n\nIt was a glittering occasion made more splendid by our ladies in their flowing formal dress. What a proud moment to be a Freemason. The highlights of the evening were the presentations of our Major Annual Donations to non-Masonic charities – on behalf of ALL the Freemasons of our District.\n\nDISTRICT SENIOR GRAND WARDEN – W BRO. DAVE GURNEY\n\nMy Masonic journey thus far has many fond memories. Firstly my Initiation on Wednesday 26th June 1985 into Boksburg St John Lodge No. 8642 is still clear in my mind. I was privileged to serve this, my Mother Lodge, as Master in 1995 and again in 2002.\n\nOnce Passed and Raised, I joined the Cinderella Mark Lodge No. 621 on 11th April 1994, followed by the Boksburg Royal Arch Chapter No. 2480 on the 25th May 1987, and Boksburg Cinderella Lodge of Royal Ark Mariners No. 621 on 16th May 1988. Since then I have joined numerous other orders, some only more recently.\n\nAs my Masonic journey expanded in the last 15 years I have often visited County Mark Lodges over weekends, an experience I soon started to enjoy as it provided the opportunity to really get to know other Brethren in the District.\n\nMy wife Janet has always been totally supportive and as my Masonic circle expanded, so did her understanding of the people with whom I was associating.\n\nI was honoured to be appointed District Senior Grand Warden. This was not an Office I had ever anticipated achieving during my journey, dreamt of yes, but never expected to achieve.\n\nThe privilege of addressing the Brethren of those Lodges I visited is an experience never to be forgotten, as is the sense of camaraderie that I felt.\n\nI now look forward to the opportunity of being called upon by the new district team in my capacity as PDSGW on occasions when my successors are unable to find that specific meeting to be within the length of their cable-tow.\n\nDISTRICT JUNIOR GRAND WARDEN – W BRO. DRIES KRAUSE\n\nDries was initiated into Verona Lodge No.8187 in 1993 by James Anderson a PM of Verona Lodge, who now lives in Ramsgate. He served as the Millennium Master of Verona Lodge in 1999/2000. Dries was also Master of The Lodge of Goodwill No.711 in Port Elizabeth in 2009/10 and 2010/11 and is still a Country member.\n\nDries received his first Craft District appointment as District Grand Standard Bearer in 2003 and was again given the same Active Rank in 2005. In 2008, he was appointed as District Grand Standard Bearer and District Junior Grand Warden in 2010 in Port Elizabeth.\n\nAfter his return to Johannesburg, he was promoted to District Senior Grand Deacon in 2012 and District Junior Grand Warden in 2014.\n\nIn Royal Arch, Dries is a PZ of Kosmos Chapter No.2768 and also a member of the Port Elizabeth Royal Arch Chapter No.711. He received his first District ap- pointment as District Grand Steward in 2009 and DG2nd Asst Soj in 2010 in the\n\nEastern Division, as well as DGSoj in 2013 in the District of South Africa North.\n\nDries, has attained the 30th degree and is a Past MWS of Corona Rose Croix Chapter. He is al- so a Past Preceptor of Johannesburg Knights Templar, Past High Priest of Kosmos KTP and a Past MPS in The Red Cross of Constantine.\n\nHaving been in the insurance industry for 44 years, he holds am Insurance Diploma and is an Honorary Member of the IISA. Having retired, Dries lives in Randpark with his wife, Jossie and\n\nthey have two daughters and a son. Dries, an ardent photographer, is also a member of the Roosevelt Park Bowls Club.\n\nDISTRICT GRAND SCRIBE NEHEMIAH – E. COMP. JOHN STEPHENS\n\nI was exalted into Doornfontein Royal Arch Chapter in January 1988 and joined Goldfield’s Chapter in 1999. I am presently Scribe Ezra of both these Chapters.\n\nI have passed through the First Principal’s chair on more than one occasion and am a founder member of the First Principal’s Chapter.\n\nI was initiated into Coronation Lodge in June 1983, which means I have been associated with Craft and Royal Arch for thirty two years and twenty seven years respectively. I have served as Master of Coronation Lodge on four different occasions, I joined Witwatersrand Lodge in 1986 and served as Master in 1997.\n\nI hold the rank of PDSGW and a Grand Officer in both the Mark and Royal Ark Mariner. I hold the 31st Degree in the Rose Croix.\n\nI have found this year to be very fulfilling and rewarding.\n\nI believe it is very important that all Freemasons complete pure and Antient Freemasonry which consists of the Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft and Master Mason including the Royal Arch.\n\nI have benefited from what Freemasonry has taught me and made it part of my way of life, listening to the piece of ritual related to the square and compass, the way it reflects on your masonic progress and development in life. Likewise in your progress through the various orders you are instructed in and deem to have graduated in the whole Masonic system from the foundation stone of initiation to the keystone of the Holy Royal Arch and to have raised a super structure, perfect in its part and honourable to the builder.\n\nGRAND LODGE AND SUPREME GRAND CHAPTER APPOINTMENTS 2015\n\n-W Bro. David Pickard\n\nThe Right Worshipful District Grand Master Prof E Guy Charlesworth wishes to inform all the Brethren of the District of South Africa, North and offer congratulations on their behalf, to the following Brethren who have received Grand Rank Promotions and 1st Appointments this year.\n\nGrand Lodge Appointments:\n\n1st Appointments:\n\nW Bro. Frank Bender PAGDC, Kensington Lodge No. 4893\n\nW Bro. Richard Fahrenheim PAGDC, Kosmos Lodge No. 2768 W Bro. David Gamble PAGDC, Roodepoort Lodge No. 2539\n\nPromotions:\n\nW Bro. Gordon Martin PJGD, Prosperity Lodge No. 2607 W Bro. Ivor Sander PJGD, Corona Lodge No. 2731\n\nSupreme Grand Chapter Appointments:\n\n1st Appointments:\n\nComp.

Ernie’ Kleingeld PGStB, Liberty Chapter No. 2485\n\nSETTING THE SCENE IN THE HOLY ROYAL ARCH – E. Comp Tim Smith\n\nAs the Deputy Grand Superintendent, I have the success of every Chapter in the District at heart. However, I am very concerned that many members leave the Royal Arch or don’t attend their Chapter meetings because they don’t understand the exaltation ceremony.\n\nThe ceremony undergoes various location changes; from a building site in Jerusalem, to a hidden subterranean vault, to the Grand Sanhedrim (the council which sat together to govern the temple and the religious life of the Jews), but these take place without any physical change to the equipment or layout of the Chapter room itself.\n\nIn an attempt to overcome this problem, our Grand Superintendent has given permission for the issuing of a script which I hope will be of assistance in “setting the scene” during the exaltation ceremony. This will form part of the ritual and will be read to the members, during the natural intervals when the sojourners and candidates have retired from the room.\n\nWe cannot afford to lose any of our members and must do all we can to help them appreciate what is happening during the ceremony, so that they can enjoy and participate in it. I believe the introduction of a Janitors card will be invaluable to the candidate in understanding where they are when the blindfold is removed. In this instance, the candidate is in fact no longer a “candidate”, but represents one of those exiles returning to Jerusalem as a sojourner or journeyman builder who discovers that the Temple and Holy City are in ruins. Together with his colleagues, he offers assistance in building a new temple which leads to the discovery of great importance.\n\nMy goal is to ensure that all of our candidates leave their exaltation ceremony satisfied that they have joined something rather special and are given as much information as possible about the order. I believe that “setting the scene” will achieve this.\n\nFEEDBACK – THE CORNERSTONE IS READ INTERNATIONALLY\n\nThis is a letter received in response to W Bro. Dr Ron Poole’s article “A Masonic Journey” published in the 8th edition of the Cornerstone.\n\nW Bro. Williams,\n\nHaving been rooting about the internet, I discovered the SA North’s website and read with interest Ron Poole’s account of his visit to London last April for the Grand Investiture and the subsequent Grand Festival.\n\nHe mentions that to be invested with Grand Rank “[he was] carefully collected by Grand Stewards who walked [us] with great decorum to the Grand Master himself.”\n\nThere are 19 Lodges in England who, each year, each have the right to put up a brother to be appointed a Grand Steward, the so-called “Red Apron Lodges”. (The reason for these lodges’ privilege is a very old story, dating back to 1728, and which is told here: http://grandstewards.org/History.aspx). Suffice to say that, last year during Ron’s visit, I was a Grand Steward, and so there’s a 5.2% chance that it was I who escorted Ron up to be invested by the MW the GM, HRH the Duke of Kent.\n\nIn the evening, the Grand Festival takes place. This is the responsibility of the Grand Stew- ards. Ron notes that “The Stewards cherish their positions and incur much expense for the privilege, including having to sojourn through France to seek out and buy suitable wines for the following banquet.” But I’m afraid that he’s not entirely correct.\n\nThe primary responsibility of the 19 Grand Stewards is to arrange the Grand Festival each year, at which some 500 brethren from around the world are fed and watered. This does take a lot of organising and, focussing on one of my core skills, I had the privilege of being chairman of the Wine Committee. As you may imagine, we, the Wine Committee, laboured hard – very hard – to discharge our duties: tasting, re-tasting, and tasting again and again! But where Ron is in- correct is his assertion that we had to sojourn through France to seek out the good stuff. If only! The truth is that we chose an excellent local wine merchant (Majestic Wine Warehouse) who did us proud, I very much hope.\n\nHaving grown up in Jo’burg, and gone to school in the KZN Midlands, I would have very much liked to have served Waterford Chardy 2008, followed perhaps by Rustenberg Peter Barlow 2000, with Vin de Constance 1998 to provide stuff with which to propose the toasts! But it was not to be: we kicked off with Heidsieck’s delicious Monopole Brut, then at the table had Nicolas Potel’s excellent Bourgogne Blanc 2011, followed by Chateau Peyrabon 2003, a fantastic, fully mature cru bourgeois that punched well above its weight (or cost, to be more accurate!).\n\nIt’s Grand Festival time again in a few weeks’ time, and I look forward to seeing how my successors have got on! I will try to locate any SA North brethren to say hello!\n\nWith all good wishes, Guy Leadbeater\n\nGrand Master’s Lodge No.1\n\nPast Grand Steward\n\nMetropolitan Grand Sword Bearer\n\nTHE ORDER OF ST JOHN – W Bro. Brian Kretzschmar\n\nMost of us only know the Order of St John’s Ambulance, as first aid at sports matches. Not so. I was surprised to learn from W Bros. Glanmore and Spiller, that their work encompasses much more.\n\nOver and above their sports connections, St John’s offers First Aid and Home Care training to commerce and industry, the military, schools and government departments. They also give courses to the general public so that they can assist in times of emergency at home and work. Their range of courses is designed to cater for the advanced first aider down to young school children. St John’s also has a programme for those individuals with limited reading and writing skills.\n\nDuring the year ending March 2013, they had trained 23 326 South Africans.\n\nIn recognition of their admirable work, the District donated an 8.4m x 2.8m gazebo – their most urgent need.\n\nWOODLANDS “ALL SAINTS” LODGE 3668 – W Bro. Richard Fahrenheim\n\nThe Brethren of the Woodlands Lodge No. 3668EC have decided to update the vision and nature of the Lodge and to align its membership on the basis of alumni, parents and teachers of “Johannesburg Saints’ Schools”. This means that they are looking to provide a Masonic home to past pupils, parents of past or current pupils and past or present teachers at any of the “Saints” schools in the greater Johannesburg area. This would include, amongst others, the likes of St. Benedicts, St. Davids, St. Johns, St. Peters and St. Stithians.\n\nWoodlands Lodge is a relatively old Lodge in the District. It was founded in 1913 and named the Sachsenwald Lodge after the forest of the same name which covered the townships of Parktown North and Rosebank. In 1915, it changed its name to Woodlands Lodge, which today, appropriately represents Johannesburg’s urban forest.\n\nAs the only “Old Boys” Lodge in the District, we are keen to maintain contact with the Saints Schools and would, wherever possible, conduct one working a year at each school. Regular meetings will continue to take place at Freemasons’ Hall.\n\nIn terms of charity, we would like to focus on education and will be looking at offering bursaries to students in need of financial assistance.\n\nFor more information, please contact me at richard@fahrenheim.org.\n\nDepDistGM VW.Bro.

Brian Kretzschmar\n\nCharity certainly is the distinguishing characteristic of a Freemason’s heart and this is being amply illustrated by W Bro. Russel Chilton and the members of Lodge of Discovery in Vanuatu, as they rebuild a school ripped apart by a tropical cyclone.\n\nSO MOTE IT BE\n\nAt every meeting we say it, we chant it, if there is music in the lodge, we sing it, over and again\n\n– and yet very surprisingly I’ve only ever been asked once, what is “So Mote it Be”, what does it mean and from whence does it originate? So here goes..…\n\nThe oldest Masonic expression is “So Mote it Be.” It is used in and outside the Lodge as a general response to Masonic prayer. It derives from the famous Regius Poem, sometimes called the Halliwell Manuscript and is said by experts to have been written circa 1390 by a monk who had access to Operative Masonic documents. This document was discovered by a citizen of London, a non-mason, Mr J.O. Halliwell Phillips, in about 1839 in the British Museum where it was catalogued under the title “a poem of moral duties.”\n\nThe poem, written in Chaucerian English, is the oldest Masonic document in existence, the unknown monk who composed it showed remarkable clarity of understanding about the fraternity of Freemasons of the times, who were of course operative workmen.\n\nHe lists the rules which govern the Craft, the relationships between Masters and workmen, the moral will, occupational and religious duties of the Craftsmen. Nearly all the articles in this ancient document, over 600 years old, are as applicable today (in substance) as they were when they were written so long ago.\n\nThe final words of the poem are –\n\n“Amen and Amen! So mote it be! May we all live in charity.”\n\n“Mote” is an Anglo-Saxon word originally derived from the Saxon word “motan” meaning “may”. The phrase “so m"
