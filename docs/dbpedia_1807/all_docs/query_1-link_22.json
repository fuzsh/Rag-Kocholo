On the initiative of Germany, negotiations took place in Bonn on 15-16\n\nOctober 1964,between a Danish and a German Govemment Oficial Delega-\n\ntion on the dernarcation of the Continental Shelf between Denmark and\n\nGermany .\n\n............................\n\n2. The two delegations now turned to the question of establishing the end\n\npoint ofa Danish-Gerrnan demarcation line at the outer Iirnit of the territorial\n\nwaters. The two delegations submitted sundry &arts, which were studied and\n\ncommented upon.\n\nThe Danish delegation said that for practical reasons the demarcation line\n\nof the Continental Shelf should begin as a continuation of the dividing line\n\nbetween the Danish and the Gerrnan territorial waters. This dividing lin-and\n\nthe sea demarcation line-had been deterrnined by the Frontier Delimitation\n\nCornmittee in 1921. However, as the dividing line was not hmly established\n\nsince it shouId foll~wshiftings of the ListeDyb Channel, the Danish deltga-\n\ntion, in order to avoid possible complications, suggestedthat the starting point\n\nshould be the line of sight described by the Frontier Delimitaticin Cornmittee\n\nfrom the eastern Lighthouse of Sild through the two western lighthouses of\n\nSild which formed the outer section of the demarcation line between Danish\n\nand German territorial waters.\n\nEurthermore, the Danish dclegation said it intendedto use the line described\n\nby the Frantier Delimitation Committee from R~ma Flak southwards to its\n\npoint of intersectionthe sea demarcation linelthe territorialwater linebeing\n\ntaken as a basis line,and that the Danish delcgation foresaw that Germany,\n\nas far as she was cuncemed, would use the continuation of that line to the\n\nnorth-west point of Sild as a basis line.\n\nWithout committing itself the Gerrnan delegation was of the opinion that\n\nthe idea of using the northwest point of Sild asa starting point in Germany\n\nwas acceptable, but it hadto reserve its opinion on the Danish basis line from\n\nRom@Flak since, prima facie, it seerned doubtful whether this would be in\n\naccordance with sub-article (3)of Articlesix of the Convention on the Conti-\n\nnental Shelf.\n\nThe discussions were concluded by the parties agreeingto consider the Itgal\n\nand the geographiçal aspects of the problem for the purpose of subsequent\n\nnegotiations.\n\n............................\n\n3.

The Danish delegation adhered to the\n\nmedian line principle as basis of delimitation, which principle was acceptable\n\nto Germany as far asthe Baltiç is concerned, whereas the German delegation\n\nrejected that principas a criterioofthe establishment of the Danish-German\n\nshelf demarcadion line in the North ka, where Germany had to demand to\n\nhave a shelf area largerthan that shc would obtain according to the rnecüan\n\nline principlc. However, Germany could accept-and wished to have-an\n\nagreement on the North Sea Continental Shelf line of demarcation next to the\n\nCoast,which lfne might be establishedon the basis of the median line principle\n\nsubject to such practically rnotivated deviations as concrete circumstances\n\nmight make natural.\n\nGermany expects that further negotiations will be made, prcferably with a\n\nview to an agreement on the above minor part of the sheIf line of demarcation\n\nin the North Sea next to the coast.\n\n............................\n\n2. On 15 and 16 October 1964, on the initiative of Germany, negotiations\n\ntook place in Bonn between a Danish and a German civil-servant delegation\n\non the delimitationOF the shelfareas of the States, first and foremost in the\n\nNorth Sea,but the lines of demarcation in the BaItic were also discussed.\n\n............................\n\nGermany would not contest that in certain instances and ta certain entent,\n\nin particular as Faas areas close tthe coast are conccrned, the equidistance\n\nprinciplemighl be adequate and couId result in a reasonable division.\n\n............................\n\nTnthecourseof confidential talks betweenthe heads of the Danish delegation\n\nand the German delegation, the head of the latter said that there were no\n\npractical possibilities of a Ranish-German agreement king obtained about\n\nthe entire North Sea Continental Shelf line of demarcation on the basisof\n\nthe equidistance principle, but that Germany was ready and attached impor-\n\ntance to making an agreement on a small part of the Iine next to the coast.\n\n............................\n\nThe negotiations brieflytouched upon the question of the end point of the\n\nNorth Sea Continental Shelf lin@of demarcation at the outer limits of the\n\nterritorial waters. The Danish delcgation suggested for practical reasons that\n\nrhe.shelfline of demarcation should commence as a continuation of.the delimi-\n\ntation of Danish and German territorial waters irrespective ofthe fact that\n\nthat delimitation isnot the median line; sincethe line of demarcation isto follow\n\nthe natural changes of the Lister Dyb Water Way, it was also suggested that NORTH SEACONTINENTAL SHELF\n\nthe demarcation basis should be the unchangeable line of sight which the\n\nBorder Commission used in 1921 to define the outermost section of the line\n\nof demarcation. The German delegation did not immediately state its attitude\n\nto this Danish proposal, andreserved the right to consider it.\n\nFinally, the question of applying certain (Danish).base lines in connection\n\nwith the establishment of the sheif delimitation line in the North Sea was\n\ntouched upon.\n\n3. At a meeting heldto deal with the question ofcuntinuing the negotiations\n\nwith Gmany and attended by representatives of the Ministry of Foreign\n\nAffairs, the Ministry of Public Works, and the Danish Syndicate which has\n\nhieengranted an exclusiveconcession to explore and exploit deposits of hydro-\n\ncarbons in the Danish underground and the Continental Shelf, the represen-\n\ntative of the Syndicate said that it was not actually or concretely interested in\n\nhaving established a Danish-German equidistance line of demarcation in the\n\nNorth Sea area next to the coast, because in view of the results of the explo-\n\nrations made in that area and in view of other information available itwas\n\nto be assumed that there was onlylittle likelihood of finding deposits of gas or\n\noil there; the Syndicatewould not be particularly active there. However, the=\n\nwere appreçiably greater possibilities of finding depositsgas or oil further\n\nto the West,Le., towards the middle of the North Sea in the border regions\n\nadjacent to Germany, the Nethcrlands, and Great Britain. The Syndicate is\n\nparticularly interested in that area, which area would natutally be lost if the\n\nGerman aspirations were realized.\n\n............................\n\nThe Syndicate agreed-and positively recommtnded-that the negotiations\n\nwith Gerrnany be continued about the starting points of the lines of demarça-\n\ntion of the Baltic and the North Sea, but Syndicate advised against negotia-\n\ntions on a small section of the line of demarcation of the North Sea next to\n\nthe coast; the Syndicate said that Danish-German negotiations on that subject\n\n-possibly resulring in an agreement-caused misgivlngs, since Germany\n\nmight use suchan agrwment as a basis and an ,argument for claiming that\n\nthe line of demarcation should deviate from the lequidistance principle from\n\nthe western end pointagreed upon.\n\n............................\n\n6. Accordjngly, this Departrncnt of the Ministry of Foreign Affairsfinds\n\nthat the situation can be described as follows:\n\n(a)Germany wishes and expectsthat the Danish-German negotiations on\n\nthe Continental Shelf be continued. This expectation can be supportedby the\n\nConvention on the Continental Shelf, according to which the line of demarca-\n\ntion is principally tlx established through agreement hbetween the parties.\n\nIn this connection it shouldbe remernbered that the communiqut published\n\nafter the initial negotiations unreservedlyenvisaged additional negotiations.\n\nIt mvst be presumedthat Gerrnany wiil categorically adopt the point of\n\nview that as long as both parties stand firmon their fundamenial points of\n\nview, it wilt not be p~ssible to negotiate on the establishment of the entire\n\nDanish-Gerrnan North Sea Continental Shelf line of demarcation, and that\n\nas fasas the North Sea is concerned the negotiations should be limited to the\n\nproblem of establishing a smatl part of the line of demarcation next to the\n\nCoast.\n\n............................\n\n(bJ Seen frorn a Danish shelf-economic point of view (exploitation and\n\nutilization) is not necessaryto establish the line of demarcation close to the\n\ncoast ofthe North Sea. 1 DOCUMENTS FILED BY DENMARK 307\n\n............................\n\n(f) Asregards the misgivingsexpressedbythe Concessionaireswith reference\n\nto further negotiations with Germany on a line of demarcation in the North\n\nSea next to the coast-corresponding to the point of view formerly adopted\n\nby the Netherlands-it should be noted in the first instance that the adviser\n\nto the Ministry of Foreign Afïairs on international law is, if anything, of\n\nopinion that negotiations-and possiblyan agreement-on this point will not,\n\nseen from the legal point of view-prejudice Denmark's position as regards\n\nthe further course of the line of demarcation, in which connection it should\n\nbe noted that in a possible agreement Denmark should emphasize her point\n\nof view on the course of the part of the line of demarcation which is not to be\n\nestablished through the agreement. Another point is that whereas the informa-\n\ntion which has been givenby the Concessionaire Syndicate-to the effect that\n\nseen from a shelf-economic point of view it would be of interest to establish\n\nthe line of demarcation-must be an essential factor of the deliberation.\n\n............................\n\n7. Summing up, Denmark should. .. continue the negotiations with the\n\nFederal Republic of Germany on the line of demarcation of the shelf areas of\n\nthese two States. ..\n\nIn the event that this conclusion is acceptable, this Department would\n\nfurther suggest\n\nthat during the negotiations Denmark should continue to maintain the equi-\n\ndistance principle,\n\nthat nevertheless negotiations may be made on a practical and appropriate\n\ndelimitation with referenŒ to the establishment of the end point of the\n\nshelfdemarcation line at the outer limits of the territorial waters, regardless\n\nof whether the resulting line would be a median line or not (Denmark\n\nwill thereby for practical reasons deviate from the equidistance principle\n\nonly over a geographically short section of the line of demarcation),\n\nthat the negotiations may comprise the subject of an agreement on a short\n\nsection of the shelf demarcation line in the North Sea next to the coast, NORTH SEA CONTlNENTAL SHELF\n\n3. Excerptsfrotn a CotifidentialReport of31 March 1965 ontheDanish-Gertnan\n\nNegotiations in Copenhagenon 17-18 March 1965, on the Demarcation of the\n\nContitrentalSheif between Denmark and Gernianyand Recommendation on the\n\nNext Step\n\n(Translation)\n\nI. bitroduction\n\nThe DanishIGerman negotiations about the demarcation of the Continental\n\nShelf, which were cornmenced in Bonn in October 1964, were continued in\n\nCopenhagen on 17-18March 1965.\n\n............................\n\nTheNorth Sea\n\nAs during the negotiations in Bonn, the discussions were focused on the\n\nconditions in the North Sea. Both parties gave to understand that their points\n\nof view as regards the principles of division of the Continental Shelf of the\n\nNorth Sea were unchanged; Denmark maintained that the division should be\n\nmade in accordance with the equidistance line principle, whereas Germany\n\nconsidered the concave configuration of the German Coast of the North Sea\n\na special circumstance which entitled Germany to expect that the demarcation\n\nline should be drawn according to other criteria. However, the two delegations\n\nagreed not to continue the discussions on the principles governing the drawing\n\nof the demarcation line which had taken place in Bonn, since it was found\n\nthat such discussions would not lead to a result. Tnsteadthe delegations agreed\n\nat once to attempt to bring about an agreement on the establishment of the\n\ndemarcation Iine of the Continental Shelf in the coastal area of the North\n\nSea on the basis of what would be expedient in practice, so that the result of\n\nthe discussions would not prejudice the respective views of the parties as\n\nregards the principles governing the division of the Continental Shelf of the\n\nNorth Sea outside the coastal areas.\n\nThe Danish delegation expressed the view that the course of the Danish-\n\nGerman sea demarcation line and the dividing line between the territorial\n\nwaters of the North Sea should not be solely decisiveat the establishment of\n\nthe starting point of the shelf demarcation line. The reason was that due to\n\nspecial geographical circumstances in the area, the frontier was constantly\n\nundergoing a change. It is true that the said sea demarcation line and the\n\ndividing line were definedin 1921 by the International Frontier Delimitation\n\nCommittee set up under Article 111of the VersaillesTreaty, but that Committee\n\nhad also laid down that the sea demarcation line and the dividing line in Lister\n\nDyb should follow the natural shifts of the channel. Such shifts occurred\n\nconstantly and has, as was known, been the object of the exchange of certain\n\nDanish-German Notes during the period from 1935to 1941.For the purpose\n\nof finding a fixed point it seemed natural in these circumstances to make the\n\n1921 provisions the starting point, hence the Danish delegation deemed it\n\nreasonable and practical to define the shelf demarcation line in the coastal\n\nregion as a continuation of the outmost part of theterritorial watcr demarcation\n\nline defined in 1921,which, in the description of the frontier, is unequivocally\n\nand clearly indicated as an unchangeable line, viz. the line of sight from the DOCUMENTS RLED BY DENMARK 309\n\nEastern Lighthouse of List through the centre point of the line between the\n\ntwo Western Lighthouses of List; thereby the starting point of the shelf\n\ndemarcation line-would be the point of intersection of the line of sight andthe\n\nouter limit of the territorial waters. In the nature of the case, it was in al1\n\ncircumstances necessary in practiceto disregard the question of fluctuations of\n\nthe courses of the sea demarcation line and the dividingline; the shelfdemarca-\n\ntion line had to be established as a definite line. It was said that the Danish\n\ndelegation realized that the establishment of the shelf demarcation line did\n\nnot prejudice the course of the frontier. (It was not said directly, but it must\n\npresumably be admitted that today it is not clear exactly what course the out-\n\nmost western part of the Danish-German frontier takes, and whether the said\n\nline of sight is at al1a part of the actual frontier. Lister Dyb may have shifted\n\nso much northward that this is no longer the case. However, the problem is of\n\nminor interest in practice, and its solution may probably be left in abeyance\n\nfor the time being.)\n\nThe German delegation agreed that it was necessary to establish a \"point a\n\nquo\", and it also agreed that the changes resulting from the natural shifts of\n\nthe Lister Dyb Channel had to be disregarded. As regards the sea demarcation\n\nline and the dividing line, the Danish proposa1 about the shelf demarcation\n\nline must be deemed to be one of several possible solutions. For example, the\n\nGerman delegation might consider a shelf demarcation line calculated on the\n\nbasis of the equidistance line principle and on the basis of the natural coastal\n\nline, which shelf demarcation line would take a northern course. To illustrate\n\nthis point, the German delegation produced a chart (which is attached to this\n\nReport) in which the continuation of the territorial water dividing line (the\n\nline of sight), and also the said equidistance line had been drawn. (As regards\n\nthe latter line, the German chart used a fictitious line from the Northwest\n\nPoint of Sildto a low-water point on R0m0; the starting point of the equidis-\n\ntance line was the point of intersection of the outer limit of the territorial\n\nwaters and the perpendicular bisector of the said Sild-R0m0 line.)\n\nThe German delegation emphasized that the chart did not represent a\n\nGerman proposal, it only represented theoretical possibilities.\n\nThe Danish delegation emphasized that it endeavoured to find a practical\n\nline and was ready to negotiate about such a line with due regard to the actual\n\nconditions in the coastal area, but that it would not be able to agree to any\n\nline which might leavethe impression that Denmark had deviated from funda-\n\nmental points of view. Accordingly it could agree with the German delegation\n\nthat there were possibilities other than a continuation of the said line of sight,\n\nalthough the Danish delegation found that it was to be preferred as the most\n\nnatural one. On the other hand, the Danish delegation could not accept the\n\nmethod applied in the German chart for the purpose of establishingthe starting\n\npoint of the equidistance line of the chart. In the view of Denmark, it was\n\njustifiableto dcmand that the calculation of the shelf demarcation line should\n\nbe made from base lines as stated in Article six of the Geneva Convention of\n\n29 April 1958,with reference to the Continental Shelf, and Denmark had to\n\ninsist that the line from Rom0 Flak to the Northwest Point of Sild be applied\n\nas the basis of calculation if the starting point and the innermost part of the\n\nshelf demarcation line were to be established according to an equidistance\n\nprinciple.\n\nThe German delegation could not accedeto the Danish points of viewrelative\n\nto the line from R0m0 Flak to the Northwest Point of Sild, and maintained in\n\nthis comection that an equidistance calculation-in accordance with the\n\nConvention on the Continental Shelf(in whichcomection the German delega-310 NORTH SEA CONTINENTAL SHELF\n\ntion presumably alluded to sub-article (3) of Article six of the Convention)-\n\nshould be made on the basis of fixed,visible points on land.\n\nThe Danish delegation as well as the German delegation refrained from\n\nsifting these diverging points of view,which werehardly completely cleared up\n\nduring the discussions, and with mutual regard to the existing differences of\n\nopinion, the two delegations finally succeeded in agreeing on a shelf demarca-\n\ntion line extending in a straight line in the western direction from the point of\n\nintersection of the outmost part of the territorial water dividing line as defined\n\nin the Frontier Description of 1921(in other words, the line of sight between\n\nthe Eastern Lighthouse of List and the centre point between the two Western\n\nLighthouses of List) and the outer limit of the territorial waters to the nearest\n\npoint on the coast, which, according to the equidistance calculation has\n\nBlaavands Huk as a \"base point\" on the Danish coast. It was agreed that the\n\nstarting point of the shelf demarcation line should be defined with reference\n\nto the Frontier Description of 1921, whereas the western end point of the\n\npart of the demarcation line shouldbe indicated completely concretelythrough\n\ngeographic CO-ordinateswith reference to the location of the point in relation\n\nto the Danish coast and the German coast. However, the Danish delegation\n\nmade the reservation that-in relation to the Press and otherwise-it would\n\nfeel entitled to maintain that the point is an equidistance point.\n\nIn this connection it was clearly understood by both parties that a protocol\n\nshould be drawn up relative to the signing of the agreement on the part of the\n\ndemarcation line, in which protocol the parties should reserve their respective\n\npoints of viewas regards the principles of establishing the line of demarcation\n\nbetweenthe Danish and the German Continental Shelf Area, so that it would\n\nbe made quite clear that this agreement could not in any way be deemed to be\n\nprejudicial to the course of the Danish-German shelf demarcation line in the\n\nNorth Sea, to the Westof the part of the line of demarcation established in the\n\nagreement.\n\nThe delegations then proceeded to discuss the wording of the agreement on\n\npart of the demarcation line. The German delegation produced a draft which\n\nevidently had been prepared on the lines of the corresponding German-Dutch\n\nagreement dated 1 December 1964, which draft was accepted by the Danish\n\ndelegation after a few minor alterations had been made in it. It was agreed that\n\nthe agreement should be prepared in the Danish and in the German language,\n\nboth languages being original languages. With regard to the procedure in\n\npractice it was agreed that after the conclusion of the negotiations the Danish\n\ndelegation should prepare a Danish text and submit it-through the Embassy\n\nin Bonn-to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs for approval. It was\n\nfurther agreed that the Danish Hydrographie Department should calculate the\n\ngeographicCO-ordinatesof the westernend point of thepart of the demarcation\n\nline, and these calculations should be communicated to theGerman Ministry of\n\nForeign Affairs for verification in Germany. It was agreed that the agreement\n\nshould be signed in Bonn. As regards the wording of the protocol to be at-\n\ntached to the agreement it wasagreed that each party should prepare a draft to\n\nbe shown to the other party before the signing of the agreement.\n\nIII. TheLineof Demarcationof the ConrinenralShelf withinthe Outer Limits of\n\nthe Territorial Waters\n\nDuring the discussions, the German delegation said that in connection with\n\nthe establishment of the shelf demarcation line in the coastal area they would\n\nlike that an arrangement be made with regard to the Continental Shelf between\n\nthe natural coast line and the outer limits of the territorial waters, since the DOCUMENTS.FILED BY DENMARK 311\n\nshiftings of the sea demarcation line and the territorial water dividing line,\n\nafter the shifting of the Lister Dyb Channel, made it difficultto establish how\n\nfar northward or southward, respectively,German and Danish concessionaires,\n\nrespectively, would beable to carry out their activities. The Danish delegation\n\nwas of opinion that that problem was not of any major practical importance,\n\nand, at any rate, it found it difficulttoiscuss that problem during the present\n\nnegotiation, one reason being that the necessary concrete particulars of the\n\nchanges of Lister Dyb during recent years werenot available.\n\nThereupon the German delegation dropped that question.\n\nVZZ.Statement to the Press\n\nAt the finalphase of the negotiations, the delegations prepared the following\n\njoint statement to the press:\n\nIn October 1964,and in March 1965,negotiations took place between a\n\nDanish delegation and a German delegation about the line of demarcation\n\nof the part of the Continental Shelf in the North Sea situated outside the\n\nDanishand the German sovereigntyterritories. Asa result of these negotia-\n\ntions, the two delegations agreed upon a draft agreement which will now\n\nbe submitted to the two Governments for approval. It is expected that the\n\ndraft agreement after being approved by the Governments willbe.signedin\n\nBonn, the agreement is to be ratified.\n\nAccording to the draft an approximately 30nautical mile long part of a\n\nline of demarcation is to be drawn to a point situated equally distanced\n\nfrom Blaavands Huk and the Island of Sild; during the negotiations, a\n\nfinal agreement could not be reached on the further course of the line of\n\ndemarcation. The two negotiating parties have reserved their points of\n\nview with regard to the principles relevant in this respect. The German\n\ndelegation has suggested that negotiations should be made within the near\n\nfutureabout the further course of the line of demarcation. This proposal\n\nwill be considered by Denmark.\n\nVIZZ.Thefollowing enclosures are attachedfor information:\n\n(1) Draft of a Danish-German agreement on the Continental Shelf (German\n\ntext) 2,\n\n(i) Draft of a Danish-German agreement on the Continental Shelf (Danish\n\ntext) 2,\n\n(3) German chart\n\n(The line of demarcation foreseen in the agreement extends from point S to\n\npoint Br. 7, 6.)\n\nX.

P.'MoIIerCotnpaniesLtd.'(Coi~cessionaires) '\n\nManaging Director 1. Hoppe\n\nManager 1. Kruse\n\n1. Mr. Oldenburg opened the meeting by outlining the problems under\n\ndiscussion. After the initial Danish-German negotiations in Bonn in October\n\n1964there wasa clear and not unfounded expectation on thepart of the Federal\n\nRepublic towards continuednegotiations but it wasto bc a condition that these\n\nnegotiations mainly-in actual fact perhaps exciusively-were to deal with the\n\nquestion of agreement on the starting point of the Danish-German North Sea\n\ncontinental sheifboundary on the outer boundary of the territorial waters and a\n\nsmaller part of the continental shelf boundary from the starting point plus the\n\nquestion of a practical, generally phrased debition of the rnedian line as\n\nDanish-German continental shelf boundary in the Baltic.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs was inclined to think that if possible one\n\nmore round of negotiations with Germany should be undertaken, but the\n\nquestion wouldnaturally arise whether the Danish side would be at al1ready to\n\nnegotiate about a \"short boundary line\" in the North Sea which decidedly,on\n\nthe part of Germany, was the primary object of the negotiations. If the answer\n\nwas in the negative it seemed doubtful whether there was adequate basis for\n\nfresh negotiations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not adopted any\n\nspecificview but regarded with some favour negotiations respecting \"the short\n\nboundary line in the North Sea\", interalia, becauseit wished firstlyto manifest\n\nthe willingness of Denmark to solve the problems of the continental shelf\n\nboundary through diplomatic means, partly to avoid that the negotiations\n\nalready initiated should end quite negatively.\n\nAs matters stood, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would draft a report to the\n\nMinister, in order to obtain his, or possibly the Government's resolution that\n\nnegotiations should continue and in this connection it was but natural and\n\ndesirable that not only the Ministry of Public Works but also the Danish\n\nconsortium representing the concessionaire were given an opportunity of\n\nstating their views.\n\n............................\n\n3. Mr. Hoppe declared that the concessionairewhollyapproved of the idea of\n\nfurther Danish-German discussionsand quite agreed to having the problem in DOCUMENTS FlLED BY DENMARK 317\n\ncomection with the determination of the starting point of the Danish-German\n\nshelf boundary in the North Sea discussedduring those talks. To the mind of\n\nthe concessionaire, the question was not of the utmost importance, but it was\n\npresumably a matter on which Denmark and Germany could reach agreement\n\nand which would have to be settled sooner or later.\n\nOn the other hand, he was against negotiations or possible agreement\n\nrespectinga short boundary line in the North Sea. This might offerGermany an\n\nargument and a springboard for claiming the drawing of a boundary deviating\n\nfrom the median line respecting the area Westof a short boundary line. That\n\nGermany and the Netherlands had achieved agreement upon a similar line was\n\ndue to the fact that the authorities in Germany had been under pressure from\n\nGerman oil companies who wanted to commence drillings in the boundary\n\narea as soon as possible. Such considerations, however, did not apply to the\n\nDanish-German North Sea boundary area near the coast where the chances of\n\nfinding oil or gas were slight and where the concessionaire did not expect to\n\nundertake any future great activity.\n\nUnder these circumstances the concessionaire wasof the opinion that at the\n\npresent time a Danish-German agreement conceming a short boundary line in\n\nthe North Sea was not to be thought of. This matter should thus await the\n\ndetermination of the boundary between, on one side, the Danish and, on the\n\nother side, the British, Norwegian and possibly Netherlands shelf areas.\n\nNaturally, he was aware that especially a possible Danish-Nctherlands agree-\n\nment mightcausea strong reaction on the part of Germany; but the concession-\n\nairethought that Danish-Netherlands discussionsshould be opened in a foresee-\n\nable future; incidentally, it would be important to have these boundaries\n\ndetermined the more so as these boundary areas seemed to offer the largest\n\npossibilities of gas or oil resources.\n\n............................\n\n4. The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared that it\n\nwould presumably be difficult to discuss the starting point of the North Sea\n\ncontinental shelf boundary without discussingthe course of a certain part of the\n\nboundary line from the above point. 1f agreement with Germany were possible\n\nrespecting a line stretching a good distance westwards, it might be said to have\n\na certain interest also from a Danish point of view, especially if the parties\n\ncould agree to draw the Iine up to so great a distance from the coast that it\n\nwould reach-and possibly go beyond-the point where the general direction\n\nof the boundary according to the equidistance principle changes from north-\n\nWestto southwest, i.e., the first point which under the above principle would\n\n.have Blavandshuk as its nearcst point on the Danish wast. Naturally it would\n\nbe of great importance, if Germany would accept a line embodying this change\n\nof direction but aprior this did not seem very probable; on the other hand, it\n\nwas obvious that the Danish side would have to avoid a line beyond the first\n\n\"bl&vandshuk-point\" which was not in agreement with the equidistance\n\nprinciple. Within the three-mile limit, the boundary (theboundary between,the\n\nintemal waters and the territorial waters) was defined by the Border Commis-\n\nsion after the reunion in 1920and the determination of the actual course of this\n\nboundary was a question of applying the Border Commission's definition and\n\nthis question should not form part of the actual Danish-German continental\n\nshelf discussions. NORTH SEA CONnNENTAL SHELF\n\n7. Excerpts from Mitrutes Dated 26 March 1965front a Meeting Held in the\n\nDanishMinistry of ForeignAffairson 22 March1965 withRepresentativesof the\n\nDanish Concessionaires\n\n1. In the meeting participated:\n\nAssistant Under-Secretary of State: T. Oldenburg\n\nManaging Director, The A. P. Maller Companies Ltd. 1.Hoppe\n\nManager, The A. P. Msller Companies Ltd. 1. Kruse\n\nHead of section, Ministry of Foreign Mairs K. Sonmer\n\n2. Mr. Hoppe said that the press communiquéhad caused the concession-\n\naires to view the outcome of the negotiations with some concem; Mr. A. P.\n\nMsller was worried over the development of the matter. Thus, the consortium\n\nwas concerned that an agreement had been entered into concerning the North\n\nSea shelf boundary in the coastal area, since an agreement of this nature might\n\ngive the impression that Denmark did not stand firm on the equidistance\n\nprinciple.\n\nMr. Oldenburgaccounted for the Danish-German negotiations, at the same\n\ntime making Mr. Hoppe acquainted with the sketch map submitted by the\n\nGerman delegation. As regards the question of the advisability of an agree\n\nment with Germany concerning the part of the boundary near the Coast, it\n\nshould be taken into consideration that, irrefutably, special circumstances\n\nexisted around the Danish-German sea frontier and the territorial waters\n\ndemarcation line in the North Sea which it was natural and reasonable to have\n\nelucidated through an agreement. Our own interpretation of the words of the\n\nGeneva Convention respecting \"special circumstances\" presupposed that this\n\nproblem was solved through an agreement. This had now happened. The\n\ncourse of the boundary line agreed upon was-well in conforrnity with Danish\n\nthinking-motivated by concrete conditions and formed a practical, reasonable\n\nsolution; in this connection it should be remembered that the western termina-\n\ntingpoint oftheline was an equidistance point. It had thus been made clear that\n\nnone of the parties-not Denmark either-had prejudiced their principles or\n\nwaived their claims. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that in accordance\n\nwith the view-point of its legal advisor on international law the Ministry of\n\nForeign Mairs had thought it advisable to manifest its willingness as far as\n\npossibleto seekagreementrespectingthecontinental shelfthrough negotiations.\n\nThis point was of importance in a possible lawsuit.

Tex1of n Report Dated 16 Jlrtre1965from the DanishEtnbassyinBonnto the\n\nDanish Ministry of ForeignAflairs\n\nDuring a conversation yesterdayconcerning other matters, the Embassy took\n\nthe opportunity to rernind Mr. Sympher that whereas the Federal Republic is\n\nable to outline on a rnap with complete precision what the wishes ofDenrnark\n\nrespecting the delimitation of the North Sea are, Denmark is not in possession\n\nof material enabling her in the same way to illustrate clearly what the German\n\nclaims amount to. So far, al1we have is Professor Meyer-Lindenberg's rather\n\nvague statement in Bonn during the talks in October 1964to the effectthat the\n\nGermans would likea delirnitation according to the principle of parity. On this\n\nbackground the Ernbassy asked if-and ifso when-the Federal Republic\n\nintended to dehe her clairns more explicitly.\n\nMr. Syrnpher answered that no such definition would be made in the near\n\nfuture. Auswartiges Amt was of the opinion that the possible lawsuit (rnen-\n\ntioned in the Embassy cable No. 136) was solely to ascertain whether or not\n\naccording to customary international law, the equidistance principle was ap-\n\nplicable in the delimitation betweenthe Netherlands, the Federal Republic and\n\nDenrnark. If the decision of the Court turned out in favour of the Danish/\n\nNethcrlands view-viz. that the above principle isapplicable-the onlyquestion\n\nleft would be the purely practical one of letting the hydrographic experts\n\ncalculate the relevant CO-ordinatesand incorporate them in a supplernentary\n\n. agreement to the already existing Gerrnan-Netherlands and Gerrnan-Danish\n\ntreaties on the determination of a partial boundary.\n\nShould the decision of the court, on the other hand, be in favour of the\n\nGerman point of view-viz. that in this case the equidistance principle is not\n\napplicable-the consequences would bethat the entire problem should become\n\nthe subject of renewed bilateral negotiations based upon the maxim that in this\n\ncontext the principle of equidistance is irrelevant. Not until then-Le.,at the\n\ncommencement of a fresh round of negotiations-will the Gerrnan delegation\n\nseecause to defineits wishes respccting thedclimitation more precisely.

En fact, both delegations considered it\n\nmore dcsirable ta reach agreement concerning a dernarcatien line starting at\n\nthe point where the working line (the green lineon the map of the Ems\n\nestuary annexed to the suppIementary agreement totheEms-Dollard agree-\n\nment) intersects the outer boundary of the terrisea.al\n\nProfessor Meyer-Litzdenbergsummarizedthe points raised by the German\n\ndelegation duringthe discussionsand proposed that it be as ahypothesis,\n\nthat accordingtcthe German view the low-water line (base line) ran approxi-\n\nmately in a south-south-wcsterly direction from the Borkumer Rif and then\n\nnorth of Rottumeroog and Rottumerplaat and past Schiermonnikoog.\n\nWhen Professor Kafier,a rnernberof the German delegation, had argued\n\nthaithe minimum correction ofthe equidistan~ pi-incipleshould be a delimita-\n\ntion-technique preventina common Danish-Netherlands border, that would\n\ncompletely excludeGerrnany,from king created, the GermanChairman called\n\nattention to theurious situation that would arise if the equidistance principle\n\nwere applied consistentto the division of the cbntinental shelf in the North\n\nSea, namely that thc relationship between adjacencountries would be of\n\nprirnary importance and that the rclationship between counIyingopgosite\n\neaeh othcr would beof secondary importance.

DOCUMENTSFILED BY THE NETHERLANDS 327\n\nSumming up, Professo Rriphagen stated that jt was now clear that point A\n\non the rnap of the Ems estuary accompanying the supplemenrary agreement to\n\nthe Ems-Dollard agreement lof 8April 1960was an equidistant point. Though\n\nthe Netherlands had adopied the standpoint that point A should be the point\n\nfromwhich the equidistant delimitation line should be drawn, ithad become\n\napparent that the Germans considered that at least point L' was the desirabIe\n\nstarting point.\n\nThe Netherlands chairman went on to state tht it had also become clear\n\nthat the German ddegation regarded the baseline as running from the Bor-\n\nkumer Rif and thenceas indicated above.\n\nThe Chairman of ihe Gerinan delegalion then described wbat he thought\n\nmight be a usable working-hypothesisfor the determination of the delimitation\n\nline, which might begin at point Ç\" (see above-mentioned map of the Ems\n\nestuary) and run from there to the southernmosc point on the equjdistance\n\nline,for the determination of which the disputed area in the Ems estuarywas\n\nof no relevance; the line might then continue for some distance according to\n\nthe equidistance principle and finally tusn westward to a point on the British\n\nboundaryline.\n\nThis working-hypothesis did not corne up for discussion in view of the late\n\nhour.\n\nDuring the discussionbetween the chairmen of the delegutions in between\n\nsessions it transpired that Professor Meyer-Lindenberg thought that the nor-\n\nthernmost point, where the delimitation line would turn west from the equidis-\n\ntance line, would lie approximately on the 55th parallel of latitude and thar\n\nthe southernmost point-whenceagain deviating frorn the equidistance line,\n\na straight Iincwould be drawn to point C\"-would lie approxirnately halfway\n\nbetweenthe northernmost point just referred ta and theCoast.It also transpired\n\nthat personally he could understand that, if there was a desire to attempt to\n\ndivide the North Sea Shelf in any manner, other than by applying the equidis- .\n\ntance principle, it çouldonly be done bywayof multilateral discussionsbetween\n\nail the adjacent States. Accordingly, the bilateral arrangement between the\n\nNetherlands and Gecrnany-in so far as it differed from the equidistance\n\nprinciple-would onIy concern the difficulties arising out of the situation in\n\nthe Ems estuary.\n\n......,....... ....., ..... n..\n\nl See map iaerted as p.336, infrd,between the presentdocumentarymaterial,\n\nforpoints A, L'and C\" referreto above on this pageand on p.330, infra.

Notes of 19 Febrlrary1964\n\n(Excerpt)\n\n(Translation)\n\nGERMAN CONTINENTAL SHELF IN THE NORTH SEA\n\nDELLMiTATION IN RELATION TO THE NETHERLANDS\n\n1\n\nThe Netherlands Govemment has notified the Federal Foreign Officeof its\n\nreadiness to open negotiations on the determination of their mutual boundary\n\non the continental sheif. It has suggested that there should be an initial ex-\n\nchange of viewsin Bonn on 3 and 4 March 1964.The Netherlands delegation\n\nwill be led by Professor Riphagen, legal adviser to the Netherlands Ministry\n\nof Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe negotiations will probably be dificult and prolonged, due to the fact\n\nthat-\n\n1. the German and the Netherlands viewpoints differ as to the course of the\n\nboundary in the Ems estuary and in coastal waters, so that with regard to\n\nthe Netherlands there is not even a firm basis from which to draw the\n\ncontinental shelf boundary seawards;\n\n2. according to Article 6, paragraph 2, of the 1958Geneva Convention on the\n\nContinental Shelf, the boundary of the continental shelf between neigh-\n\nbouring States shall be the rnedian line, provided that those neighbouring\n\nStates do not otherwise agree. Apart from the fact that for the reasons\n\ngiven in sub-paragraph 1 above the Netherlands and the German views\n\ndifferon the course of this rnedian line,it would inany event beunfavourable\n\nto us to take themedian line as the basis. Although under Article 6, para-\n\ngraph 2, of the Convention the median line would only constitute the\n\nboundary where no \"special circumstances\" exist which wouldjustify an-\n\nother boundary line, the Netherlands will nevcrtheless probably take the\n\nstandpoint that under suchan arrangement the onus of proof of the existence\n\nof such special circumstances rests on the State seeking a boundary line\n\nother than the median line .. .\n\nAs soon as there are signs of agreement with the Dutch, negotiations should\n\nbe opened with the Danish Govemment on the delimitation of the continental\n\nshelf.\n\nNegotiations on the delimitation of the German continental shelf must also\n\nbe conducted with Great Britain. The British Embassy suggested the same\n\non 15 February 1964.But Anglo-Gerrnan negotiations should not be opened\n\nuntil the Netherlands-German and Danish-German negotiationshave produced\n\ntangible results.

Mini-\n\nsteriddirigent Professor Dr. Meyer-Lindenberg, supported by the represen-\n\ntativcs of the federal ministries and the Laetider stated that Germany,aci\n\ncount of her positionin the North Sea area, the length of her coastline, the\n\ninvestments made and other achievernents in this respect, was entitled to\n\nequal treatment in her rclationship with her neighbours Denmark and the\n\nNetherlands in the question of their respectivareasof the continental shelf,\n\nThe Netherlands proposed cutting off of Germany from the middle of the\n\nNorth Sea was clearly unjusi. Germany had postponed negotiations with\n\nDenmark and Britain togivethe Netherlands an opportunity to negotiaia fair\n\nsettlement first on a bilateral basis.\n\nProfaso Riphngen pointed out thatan equal sharing of the North Sea shelf\n\nwould have to includeBritain, Norway and Belgiumand could only be achieved\n\nby means of muItilatera1 negotjations. A restriction of negotiations to the\n\nNetherlands, Germany and Denmark could not be justificd on geographical\n\ngrounds.\n\nAt the start of the second daofnegotiations Professor Riphagen stated that\n\nhe had ken told by The Hague that the Netherlands Governrnentsaw no basis\n\nfor negotiation inthe equal-area principle. Onthe contrary, the discussions\n\nshould bc based on the equidistance principle.\n\nThe configuration of the Gerrnan coastline did not constitute a special\n\ncircumsiance that could justify a delimitation varying frorn the principle of\n\nequidistance. The Netherlands saw no occasion to cornpensateher neighbour,\n\nwho was both large and had greater natural resaurces, for any advantage the\n\nNetherlands may have from the course of her coastlinc. Furthermore, their\n\nparrnership wirhin the EEC ensured that the sources of power open to one\n\nState would also benefit its neighbours.\n\nThe value of the partial areas of the continental shelf was, after all, still\n\nunknawn, and their size really had nothing to do with the length of national\n\ncoastlines.\n\nMoreover,theNetherlands couldnot consideranyequal apportionment ofthfi\n\nNorth Seaarea,if only on account of Belgiurn.\n\nWith regard to the area of the Ems estuaw the Netherlands delegatiun were\n\nwillingto discuss how the equidistant boundary line should begin.\n\nProfessor Br. Meyer-lindenberg expressedthe German disappointment over\n\nthjç attitude and pointed out that the subsidiary question of drawing the\n\nboundary on the basis of the equidistance principwas of no particulaï conse-344 NORTH SEA CONTINENTALSHED\n\nquence at this stage of the discussions. main objectiveatthe moment was\n\nrather for the Netherlands and Gerrnanto arriveatan equitable delimitation\n\nby way of agreement. Itwas not seen why Germany ,n important country\n\nadjacent to the North Sea, should be limited to a disproportionately small\n\nportion of the continental shelf area on account ofbend.in her coastline,\n\nProfesso Mreyer-Lindenberg then pr~posed that the German area of the\n\nNorth Sea should be deterrninedinproportion to the length of the Coast(with\n\nthe lengthof the coastlines being in ratioof 385: 273: 245 km. the sizes of\n\nthe areas accruing to the Netherlands, Gerrnany and Denmark would be\n\napproximately 57,000, 44,000, and 40,000 sq.krnrespectively.,\n\nHe pointed out that irwas already dificult to keep the German companies\n\nconŒrned from making exploratory driilings in the disputed area. In the long\n\nrun they could not be heldback, particularly as twaseno legalpossibility of\n\npreventing them. This courd produce most unpleasant consequences, not anly\n\nfor the iiegotiations but for relations betwcen the two counfries.\n\nProJesso Riphageri siated that nothing could be said abtheNetherlands\n\nviews with regard tothe determination of the boundary in the mourh of the\n\nEms until the next meeting, which was fixedfor 23 Marçh1964at 9.30a.m. in\n\nthe Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, The Hague.

Minutes of Conclusions of the Netherlands-GerrnanNegotiations on the\n\nContinetitalShelf Held in The Hague on23 March 1964\n\n(Translation)\n\nProfessor Riphogen stated that these were still non-binding preliminary\n\ndiscussions. He still had no instructions as to how to reply to the German\n\nproposal of 4 March that year (sharing of North Sea shelf in proportion to the\n\nlengths of Germany's coastline and those of her neighbours).\n\nProfessor Meyer-Lindenberg again outlined the reasons why an early agree-\n\nment on the lateral determination of the shelf boundary would be in their\n\nmutual interests.\n\nThe two delegations then discussed the possibilities of connecting the shelf\n\nboundary with thetermination point of the lateral coastal sea boundary (point a\n\nquo). The German delegation upheld its reservations in respect of the applica-\n\ntion of the equidistance principle, while the Netherlands delegation started\n\nfrom the contents of the Note Verbale of the Netherlands Embassy dated 21\n\nJune 1963.Different views emerged on several points in connection with the\n\ninterpretation of the Geneva Conventions on the Continental Sheif and on the\n\nTerritorial Sea, as wellas with the question of how baselines should be drawn.\n\nTheNetherlands delegation consideredthat Borkum Riff might be included as a\n\npoint of departure for equidistance-line boundaries. Variations were also dis-\n\ncussed which could ensue from the arrangement provided for in the Supple-\n\nmentary Agreement to the Ems-Dollart Treaty, especially whether the point a\n\nquo could lie on the line A-Cii-LI of that Supplementary Agreement. The\n\nGerman delegation also mentioned in particular the historic title, which, as\n\n\"special circumstances\" within the meaning of Article 6 of the Geneva Con-\n\nvention, it wasfelt shouldbe taken into consideration in drawing the boundary\n\nline.346 NORTH SEA CONTINENTAL SHELF\n\n8. Notes of 6 April1964\n\n(Excerpt)\n\n(Translation)\n\nThe talks with the Netherlands on the determination of the continental shelf\n\nboundary werecontinued in The Hague on 23 March 1964.\n\n............................\n\nAs regards the northern or north-western termination point of the Nether-\n\nlands-German shelf boundary, the German delegation must realize that any\n\nwillingness on the part of the Netherlands Government to allow Germany\n\naccess to the middle of the North Sea cannot lead to concrete concessions, if\n\nonly on grounds of domestic policy, unless it is certain that corresponding\n\nconcessions will be made by Demark as well.It will therefore only be possible\n\nto discussthe northern (or north-western) part of the Netherlands-German shelf\n\nboundary, and hence the problem of a Gerrnan share of the subsoil beneath the\n\nmiddle of the North Sea, in multilateral negotiations with the participation of\n\nDenmark and, possibly, Great Britain.\n\nThe aim of the negotiations in their present phase is therefore to determine\n\nthe Netherlands-German shelf boundary to such an extent seawards from the\n\npoint a quo-which is still to be agreed-that,on the one hand, our claim to\n\naccess to the middle of the North Sea is not prejudiced and, on the other, the\n\nGerman oilcompanieswill beable to commencedrillingoperations at the points\n\nnear the Coastin which they are at present mainly interested.

Moreover, it was the Netherlands view that\n\nthere did not appear to be any special circumstances which might justify a\n\nmodification of the further course of the lateral boundary, as claimed by\n\nGermany.\n\nProfessor Dr. Meyer-Litrderrberg regretted that the bay situation of the\n\nFederal Republic was not recognized as a special circumstance by the Nether-\n\nlands. Going by the genesis of the Geneva Convention this was a typical case\n\nfor the application of the special circumstances clause.The Netherlands wereat\n\nliberty to seek a voluntary agreement, which wasthe first step envisaged by the\n\nConvention (Article 6, paragraph 2, first sentence), independently of its inter-\n\npretation of the term \"special circumstances\" ...\n\nThe Netherlands delegation argued that the Geneva Convention also laid\n\ndown guidelinesas to the composition of any voluntary agreement, and that in\n\nthe opinion of the Netherlands these were bound to lead to the application of\n\nthe equidistance principle as an equitable method of apportionment, as there\n\nwere no opposiog special circumstances. The Netherlands Government was\n\nprepared to submit this differenceof opinion on the interpretation of Article 6\n\nof the Geneva Convention, together with the Federal Republic, as a legal\n\nquestion to the International Court of Justice.\n\nProfessor Dr. Meyer-Lindenbergsaid that Germany wasnot afraid to put the\n\nmatter to arbitration, which could onlyend in her favour, but first it had to be\n\nabsolutely certain that there could be no voluntary agreement between the\n\ncountries concemed. In the .German view, however, the delimitation of the\n\ncontinental shelf was to littoral countries of the North Sea, and particularly to\n\nGermany, not a problem that could be solved on a purely bilateral basis with\n\nneighbouring countries, in this instance the Netherlands. On the contrary,\n\nmultilateral agreements werenecessaryto achieveanadequateapportionment of\n\nthe middle of the North Sea. He suggested that as an initial step they should\n\nsolve the problem of the Ems estuary by drawing a partial boundary line\n\nbetween Germany and the Netherlands near the coast, so as to enable oil\n\ncom~anies of both countries to exdore and ex~loit that area in the next few\n\nyearS.This arrangement did not imply recogni;ion of the principle of equidis-\n\ntance as an eauitable criterion for amortionment. The German side ex~resslv\n\nreserved its leial standpoint, stating that the line could therefore only bedraG\n\nup to a certain distance from the coast, say, as far as the 54th latitude. The\n\nfurther determination of the boundary would have to be the subject of a future\n\nsettlement on a multilateral basis which should be effected in accordance with\n\nother criteria than the principle of equidistance.- Equidistance line, constructeo dn the\n\nbase pointsA and LI (~asternand\n\nNestern terminal pointsof the\n\nboundary-area\"descri'bedin the\n\n~ollart-Treaty)greement to the Ems-\n\n----- basis of Borkum Riffnstructedon the\n\nthe Netherlandsne as proposeb dy\n\n. .
