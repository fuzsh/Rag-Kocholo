Literatuur en mystiek in de veertiende eeuw (Amsterdam, Athenaeum-Polak & Van Gennep). It examines Ruusbroec’s life and work from the perspective of Dutch literary history, focusing in particular – perhaps more so than an international readership would expect – on his impact on and relation to the literature of the Low Countries. However, it is precisely by taking this context of Ruusbroec’s writings into consideration that it is possible to clarify his position in the medieval mystical tradition. Recently published editions of medieval texts have been added to the bibliography of the original Dutch publication. The translation of this book was made possible by a generous grant from the Dutch Organisation for Scientic Research (NWO). Most of all, I am indebted to Diane Webb for undertaking the difcult task of translating this book. Working with her has been a pleasure and a privilege. Geert Warnar\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCONTESTED WISDOM Who are the arbiters of history? Within twenty years of his death in 1381, Jan van Ruusbroec – now considered one of the great mystical writers of the Christian tradition and revered during his lifetime as ‘a seraph from heaven, equal to the highest angels’ – was in danger of going down in history as a heretic. While admirers thought him as enlightened as the saintly Pope Gregory the Great, academic theologians voiced objections to Ruusbroec’s books, even though his words were said to have been inspired by God. Serious problems arose in 1399, when Jean Gerson, chancellor of the University of Paris, was asked to give his opinion of The Spiritual Espousals, Ruusbroec’s masterpiece, which describes a religious universe in which the human spirit can rise to divine heights. Gerson roundly rejected what Ruusbroec had written about utmost perfection and the soul’s union with God, the ground of all existence. According to the laws of theology, there was an absolute distinction between Creator and creature. Gerson was convinced that Ruusbroec had disregarded the ‘sound doctrine of the pious teachers who have spoken of our beatitude’. Moreover, the chancellor thought that the Espousals betrayed too much erudition to be credible as a work of divine inspiration.1 Gerson’s verdict caused great consternation at Groenendaal, a priory near Brussels, where Ruusbroec was revered as one of the founders and the rst prior. The mystic’s disciples, who venerated him as one of God’s elect, did everything in their power to persuade others of his saintliness. At Groenendaal, Ruusbroec’s writings were translated into Latin and supplied with introductions that made overt reference to divine revelation as the source of the author’s teachings. The\n\n1 Quotation Jan van Leeuwen in De Vreese 1895, p. 178: ‘enen sceran in hemelrike, den hoechsten inghelen ghelike’. All the surviving material relating to the GersonGroenendaal controversy was published and analysed in detail in Combes 1945–72. Paraphrased passages and commentary on this study are to be found in Ampe 1975a, pp. 54–261. See also Axters 1950–60, vol. II, pp. 350–58. A clear, concise summary is offered in Burger 1993, pp. 43–45; the passage quoted is on p. 43. A prole of Gerson is included in Decorte 1992, pp. 303–05.\n\n2\n\nintroduction\n\nGroenendaal novice-master Jan van Schoonhoven, who had lived with Ruusbroec for a number of years, had already begun to record ‘the glorious life of this holy father’. The text of Schoonhoven’s biography has not survived, but several references to his vita suggest that it took the form of a hagiography and had been written in the hope that one day it could be submitted to the ecclesiastical authorities ruling on canonisation. Any chance Ruusbroec stood of becoming a saint seemed to go up in smoke, however, when Gerson began to fulminate against the Espousals.2 Gerson was a leading theologian and an academic dignitary of some stature. The double dose of authority the chancellor brought to bear on the matter called for an adequate response from Ruusbroec’s followers. Jan van Schoonhoven himself acted as the spokesman for the Groenendaal community. A graduate of the University of Paris, he was sufciently versed in theological literature to formulate a scholarly defence of Ruusbroec’s orthodoxy. Gerson remained adamant, however. He continued to denounce Ruusbroec’s earlier theories as madness (insania), but admitted that in other works the author of the Espousals had plainly distanced himself from his errors. The chancellor was also incensed at Jan van Schoonhoven’s unshakeable belief in Ruusbroec’s inspired authorship and at his defence of the Espousals with the argument that God-given wisdom was superior to acquired knowledge. As a devout Christian, Gerson was willing to believe in the existence of revealed truth, but he remained faithful to his academic profession and – with regard to things of higher importance – held fast to theology as the ultimate touchstone. This was what he objected to in the Espousals: its lack of a theological framework. Even though Ruusbroec’s bold theories on religious existence were in fact underpinned by Church doctrine, in the end the reader simply had to trust that the author was speaking from his own experience of an exploratory religious life. Gerson found this unacceptable. But this was not the only reason he picked the Espousals to pieces. Gerson had earlier voiced his concerns about the mysticism of pious souls who claimed the privilege of divine revelation and other forms of charismatic spirituality. Similar criticism had been voiced by the 2 For the reference to Schoonhoven’s lost vita, see Dykmans 1940, pp. 315–16 and exhib. cat. Ruusbroec 1981, p. 98 (also for the passage quoted) and p. 32, where Ampe seems to have revised his earlier view of the text (Ampe 1975a, pp. 221–30). See Bredero 1993, pp. 37–38, regarding biographies as preparation for canonisation.\n\ncontested wisdom\n\n3\n\ntheologian Heinrich of Langenstein, who also appears to have raised objections to the Espousals as early as 1380. The suspicions of both scholars must have been aroused even more by the Groenendaal initiatives to have Ruusbroec canonised, since it was obvious that there was more to the Espousals than the promptings of the Holy Spirit. To be sure, Schoonhoven could rightly point out that Gerson’s view of Ruusbroec was distorted, owing to the highly stylised Latin translation he had read. Gerson’s distrust, however, was based on more than just the owery language used by Ruusbroec’s Groenendaal confrère Willem Jordaens to dress up the Middle Dutch Espousals in ‘Latin garb’, as the translator himself put it. In Gerson’s view it was impossible for an unschooled author to write competently about a subject as complicated as that handled in the Espousals.3 That was the end of the matter, as far as the chancellor was concerned, and Jan van Schoonhoven could do little more than assess the damage. He had barely managed to save Ruusbroec from the everlasting disgrace of being branded a heretic, but the mystic’s reputation as a divinely inspired writer had suffered greatly, shattering the Groenendaal brothers’ dreams of seeing a saint emerge from their ranks. Schoonhoven’s vita of Ruusbroec soon sank into oblivion, but the mystic’s followers clung tenaciously to his image as a man touched by divine inspiration. Around 1420 Henricus Pomerius began to write his history of the origins of the Groenendaal priory, De origine monasterii Viridisvallis, announcing right from the start that he would devote a separate volume of his chronicle to ‘the blessed life and holy morals of the long-devoted father, Brother Jan van Ruusbroec, the rst prior of Groenendaal’.4 From the very beginning, the underlying tone of the Middle Dutch version of De origine makes it clear – more so than the Latin original – that the Groenendaal brothers had not lost their faith in Ruusbroec. In 3 See Vauchez 1981, p. 474, on the attitude of Gerson and Langenstein; cf. Elliot 2002, p. 30. See also exhib. cat. Ruusbroec 1981, p. 84 and Dinzelbacher 1994, pp. 381–84. On Jordaens as a translator, see De Baere 1993. 4 Verdeyen 1981b, p. 117: ‘dat salige leven ende heilige seden des alre devoets vaders brueder Johannes van Ruysbroec des iersten priors van Gruenendael’; cf. De Leu 1885, p. 265. The text of De origine published in De Leu 1885 was based on a single manuscript, disregarding the sometimes drastic textual variants in other copies. An overview of the manuscript is given in Lievens 1960a and Persoons 1960. This book usually quotes from the Middle Dutch translation (published in Verdeyen 1981b), which in many cases appears to follow a more informative Latin examplar. See Ampe 1975a, pp. 242–46, regarding the need for textual criticism of De origine.\n\n4\n\nintroduction\n\na long series of stories, Pomerius illustrates the extent to which Ruusbroec distinguished himself in spiritualibus from his less gifted brethren, starting with an early sign: at the age of just seven days he stood up in the wash basin, just as he would later be lifted up in spirit to the contemplation of the divine. Clearly, Ruusbroec was a child prodigy. He discovered early on that the only thing to be gained from routine education was ‘vanity and arrogance’ ( ydelheit ende hoverdie) and therefore chose to attend ‘the school of godly wisdom’ (gaen ter scolen der godliker wijsheit).5 From reports of revelations, visions, prophecies, true priesthood and the exemplary practice of monastic virtues, Pomerius created a biography in which the contours of a saint’s life are clearly recognisable. Though passages from Schoonhoven’s vita were undoubtedly incorporated in De origine, it can no longer be determined how Pomerius adapted the older text to serve his purposes. It is certain, however, that Ruusbroec’s second biographer was so intent on restoring the mystic’s reputation that he took great liberties with the vita. Giving the facts a new twist, Pomerius made it look as though Gerson’s objections to Ruusbroec’s alleged lack of education were based on a misunderstanding that had been quickly cleared up by Jan van Schoonhoven’s letter. Whereupon Gerson, in deance of his own views, had to admit that ‘the light of natural understanding’ was not enough to enable one to follow Ruusbroec ‘in the loftiness of his godly contemplations’.6 * Now, six centuries later, the conict over the Espousals mainly elicits sympathy for the unnecessary distress it caused. The fears of the Groenendaal community proved, with hindsight, to be unfounded. The commotion caused by Gerson hardly made a dent in the popularity of Ruusbroec’s writings. In the course of the fteenth century, his treatises were painstakingly copied and widely disseminated. Gradually the mystic grew into a leading gure in the religious history of the Netherlands. Ruusbroec continued to exert an inuence on other writers until well\n\n5\n\nVerdeyen 1981b, p. 140 (De Leu 1885, p. 287). For the quotations from Pomerius (‘den lichte der natuerliker verstandenis’ and ‘in die hoecheit sijnre godliker contemplacien’), see Verdeyen 1981b, p. 141 (De Leu 1885, p. 287). On the relationship between the texts by Schoonhoven and Pomerius, see O’Sheridan 1925; Axters 1950–60, vol. II, pp. 213–18; Axters 1962, pp. 112–15. See Bredero 1993, pp. 69–73, on the revision of existing biographies. 6\n\ncontested wisdom\n\n5\n\npast the Middle Ages, and every history of Dutch literature gives pride of place to the writer of the Espousals, one of the most frequently translated texts in the literature of the Low Countries. In modern times Ruusbroec has grown so much in stature that a learned society even bears his name: the Ruusbroec Society in Antwerp, founded more than seventy-ve years ago as a centre of expertise on the history of spirituality in the Low Countries.7 When Pomerius began writing his chronicle, it was impossible to say whether Ruusbroec would be rehabilitated or remain in disgrace. What Ruusbroec’s followers considered his innite wisdom was brushed aside by Gerson as complete lunacy. Such mutual recriminations turned the controversy over the Espousals into a head-on collision between theology and mysticism, and this happened at a difcult time in the history of religious thought. After a long period in which medieval mysticism had blossomed, there was growing scepticism regarding philosophical reection on the union with God, which Ruusbroec described in his Espousals as the ‘simple ground of our eternal likeness in a darkness from which shines an immeasurable light’. Such daring paradoxes, presented as solutions to the great mystery of being, had always been surrounded by controversy, but after 1400 such abstract spiritual discourse was increasingly viewed as pure delusion.8 Since Gerson had made his suspicions about the Espousals known to the world and the Groenendaal community continued to hold fast to the image of Ruusbroec as a divinely inspired writer, it had become impossible to present an objective view. Pomerius was either unwilling or unable to present the author of the Espousals as a mystical theologian. While Schoonhoven had attempted to demonstrate that Ruusbroec had followed in the footsteps of recognised authorities in the eld, Pomerius resolutely turned the mystic into an inspired soul drenched ‘with the dew of divine grace’ (metten dauwe der godliker gracien) that\n\n7 For an overview of Ruusbroec’s inuence and the research done on this subject, see Ampe 1975a; exhib. cat. Ruusbroec 1981, pp. 263–481, 483–509; Mertens 1993c and 1993d. An overview of the Latin translations of Ruusbroec’s works is to be found in De Baere 1989, pp. 139–40. On the Ruusbroec Society, see De Borchgrave 2001 and Willaert 1994, pp. 2–15. 8 On this subject in general, see Leclercq, Vandenbroucke & Bouyer 1961, pp. 487–533; on Ruusbroec in particular, see Willeumier-Schalij 1981, pp. 298–301 and 381–90. On the characteristics of fourteenth-century mysticism, see also Davies 1988. See Mertens 1993a, pp. 20–22, for a broad outline of mysticism in Middle Dutch literature.\n\n6\n\nintroduction\n\nenabled him to climb to a level of divine contemplation unattainable ‘through the common use of logic or with the subtleties of the natural arts of philosophy’.9 Pomerius placed Ruusbroec’s books, which in the nal analysis represent the fruits of his intellectual exertions, wholly in the light of ‘divine revelation’ (godliker revelacien), and energetically set about isolating the mystic’s writings from their controversial context in order to present them as an example of divine favour. This image of Ruusbroec persisted. With his remarkably cultivated literary style, Pomerius introduced a new form of monastic historiography that was followed in the Low Countries until well into the sixteenth century. At the same time, De origine grew to be the authoritative source on Ruusbroec’s life. Gerson’s imputations thus had a long-lasting effect. The chancellor’s criticism was, after all, the immediate cause of Pomerius’s revision of Ruusbroec’s image in De origine. The picture presented in that chronicle continued to exert an inuence on the appreciation of the mystic and his texts until long after the rst scholarly studies on Ruusbroec and his teachings were published in the nineteenth century. Now one can turn to an extensive body of literature in which Ruusbroec’s teachings are presented as a great monument in the mystical tradition, but the historical dimensions of this grand oeuvre have been given short shrift. Despite a plethora of publications, there is still no study on Ruusbroec that even begins to meet the minimum requirements of a writer’s biography, by providing insight into those factors in the author’s milieu and mentality that inuenced the creation of his oeuvre.10 Such a study must be carried out in the sphere in which the author of the Espousals has become an unassailable eminence: the history of literature. The huge increase in the number of theological and religious studies devoted to his writings seems to have propelled Ruusbroec into an orbit outside the sphere of literary history. On a high level in the history of ideas he has been compared with such gures as Heidegger, Spinoza and Buddhist mystics from the Far East. Nevertheless, we know relatively little about Ruusbroec’s relations with his contemporaries, which is not to say that they were unimportant. Ruusbroec did not produce his writings in the company of the great thinkers of contem9 Verdeyen 1981b, p. 126: ‘der ghemeynder ghewoente der logiken of met subtijlheit der natuerliker consten van philozophien’; cf. De Leu 1885, p. 273. 10 On Pomerius, see Warnar 1997c; for a broader perspective, cf. Van Engen 1992 and Scheepsma 1996, pp. 218–24.\n\ncontested wisdom\n\n7\n\nplative literature; rather, he wrote in the midst of the Brussels beguines, the mendicant orders and other representatives of fourteenth-century religious culture. Some of his writings were addressed to individuals, so that his intended audience included not only clerics, priests, preachers, pious widows and learned masters, but also – quite specically – a hermit, a church reformer, a converted banker and an impassioned priory cook, all of whom make an appearance in this book.11 In the often high-own literature on Ruusbroec’s mysticism, the historicity of his texts has sometimes been relegated to the background. Even so, this is no reason for disdain, for such abstraction is inherent in any transcendental subject. The direct experience of God’s presence – the simplied but effective denition of mysticism that is used in this book – takes place in the spirit, which must free itself of all transitory things in order to be receptive to the absolute. The reader of the Espousals is even confronted with a new language, in which the spirit must ‘strip’ itself of all ‘images’ to become ‘empty’, and in which all preoccupation with the ‘multiplicity’ (menichvoudicheit) of worldly things must give way to a ‘unity of spirit’ (enicheit des geestes). Ruusbroec describes a spiritual reality that can easily be entered and understood without asking what the author’s world was like or how his life was linked to his message. The affair with Gerson shows, however, that Ruusbroec’s mysticism was indeed time-bound and that the arbiters of history could have passed a very different judgement on the Espousals. By looking back at the time before the skirmishes over Ruusbroec’s masterpiece, we can add a surprising amount of detail to the existing picture of the mystic of Groenendaal. Nevertheless, a study of Ruusbroec’s life and work is not easy if one demands irrefutable facts. There is scant information on Ruusbroec’s life. The uncertainties already begin with the dating of his texts; in fact, we know only the order in which they were written. In the course of his remarkably long life (1293–1381) Ruusbroec wrote eleven treatises, but only one can be dated (on the\n\n11\n\nSee Hubbeling 1973 (Spinoza), Sikka 1997, pp. 225–64 (Heidegger) and Mommaers & Van Bracht 1995 (Buddhism). Cf. also Westenbroek 1999 and Oegema 1999, pp. 183–85, for examples of Ruusbroec’s inuence on modern poets in the Low Countries. Earlier studies of Ruusbroec’s life and work are to be found in Van Mierlo 1910 (closely based on Pomerius), Underhill 1914 and d’Asbeck 1928 – whose shortcomings are overemphasised in Ampe 1975a, pp. 634–36, at the expense of what is certainly a fresh outlook – and Verdeyen 1981a, reworked in Verdeyen 1996, which makes unacknowledged use of Warnar 1993c and 1994 and other sources.

Information gleaned from colophons and headings in manuscripts enable us to place Ruusbroec’s texts in relation to the most important changes in his life. His rst years as a writer, however, remain shrouded in mystery. Ruusbroec wrote his early works, including the Espousals, while serving as a chaplain in Brussels. At rst these texts were read by only a small number of like-minded individuals. Wider reception of Ruusbroec’s works began when he and several kindred spirits settled in the former hermitage at Groenendaal, where they started a new life as priests of their own chapel. It was there that Ruusbroec began his most extensive work, On the Spiritual Tabernacle, an exegetical commentary, the bulk of which was probably completed before 1350. In that year the residents of Groenendaal decided to convert their community of priests into a priory of canons regular who embraced the rule of St Augustine. By this time Ruusbroec – a spiritual guide with a growing ock of followers – was fty-seven, but he was to continue his literary work to a ripe old age.12 These, then, are the sketchy facts of Ruusbroec’s life: a tattered backdrop to a historical study, which can add but few threads to its frayed fabric. Apart from his writings, Ruusbroec left almost no trace of his existence. From the Groenendaal documents we can glean – as Pomerius did – that during his years in Brussels Ruusbroec was a chaplain at the Collegiate Church of St Gudula, though his name does not appear in the archives of that institution. For much of our more or less factual information on Ruusbroec we have no authority other than Pomerius, to whose words we will often have recourse – not from any naive hope of nding truthful accounts of actual events, but simply because De origine remains, despite its hagiographic distortions, an indispensable source of information on the mystic’s life. As a biographer Pomerius was in a privileged position, able – as he himself testied – to gain information from Groenendaal canons who were old enough to have lived with Ruusbroec. Furthermore, Pomerius had access to now-lost documents from the monastic archives, including Schoonhoven’s vita. As long as it remains wise to do so, we will take advantage of De origine, even though it offers no answers to a number of essential ques12 On the chronology of Ruusbroec’s works, see in particular Warnar 1994, despite the differing conclusions in Kienhorst & Kors 2001, esp. p. 95, where the authors ignore the fact that Pomerius did have enough information at his disposal to establish the chronological order of Ruusbroec’s works.\n\ncontested wisdom\n\n9\n\ntions and sometimes forces us to rectify the confusing legend created by Pomerius. In order to identify the cultural-historical underpinnings of Ruusbroec’s writings, we must go in search of the circumstances of the author’s life, the people with whom he shared his insights, and the intellectual, religious and social inuences to which he was exposed. This will be undertaken not with the intention of cutting the peerless mystic down to human size, but rather in the rm conviction that this is the only way to do justice to a great name in the literature of the Low Countries.\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nBRUSSELS 1. Ancestry and Inwardness If earthly creatures do not wish The Lord’s commandments to obey, His wrath will cause Him to unleash His anger on both poor and rich. Indeed this happens every day. Als gode niet en willen wiken Die erdsche creaturen, So doet hi sine abolghe striken Beide ten armen ende ten riken Dit valt noch tselker uren.1\n\nIn 1299 the anonymous Brabantine poet who penned this verse sensed impending doom all around. The decline of knighthood and the nobility had led to the ultimate defeat of the crusaders, who had been forced to surrender their last stronghold in the Holy Land. The whole of the Church, from priest to pope, was riddled with greed. Close to home, war seemed inevitable, now that the Duchy of Brabant had become embroiled in the struggle between the kings of England and France. The poet’s graceless stanza betrays bleak prospects for the fourteenth century, but his pessimism had nothing to do with medieval n-de-siècle fears: he had simply seen a comet, and that was rarely a good sign. Within twenty years the same cosmic phenomenon inspired another writer from Brabant, the chronicler Lodewijk van Velthem, to discuss a whole series of prophecies foretelling the last days. In 1315 a comet had appeared in the sky, presaging catastrophes which, according to Velthem, heralded the end of time. He had meanwhile seen with his own eyes how relentless rainfall had destroyed the crops in the summer of 1315, resulting in famine and an epidemic that claimed so many\n\n1\n\nHegman 1958, verses 154–58.\n\n12\n\nchapter i\n\nlives that the fallow elds outside the cities had to be put to use as burial grounds.2 Born in 1293 in the Duchy of Brabant, Jan van Ruusbroec might have seen both comets, but other circumstances are to blame for the ill-starred beginning of his life. The sources maintain a discreet silence very likely meant to conceal his illegitimate birth. Pomerius says nothing at all about Ruusbroec’s father, and portrays his mother as a single parent, who reluctantly let her son go at the age of eleven, when he left his native village of Ruisbroek to attend school in Brussels. The boy moved in with a relative, Jan Hinckaert, a chaplain at the Church of St Gudula in Brussels. Following her child to the city, the mother became a beguine and henceforth saw her son only from a distance. Even without the dramatic separation from his mother, the move to Brussels would have brought about a huge change in the life of young Ruusbroec. His birthplace was a mere hamlet, whereas Brussels was by fourteenth-century standards a big city, with ourishing trade and industry and growing allure as the new residence of the dukes of Brabant. Ruusbroec, moreover, found himself part of a wealthy and inuential patrician family. Gerelm, the father of Jan Hinckaert, had repeatedly served as an alderman. He was the pater familias of one of the seven clans (or lignages) from whose ranks the members of the Brussels city council were appointed. Within this oligarchy there was a complicated network of interdependent kinships and relationships based on what we today would consider a very broad denition of family. It is unclear how Ruusbroec was related to the Hinckaerts, the main stumbling block being that the various versions of De origine refer to his ties to Jan Hinckaert only in very vague terms. Some manuscripts speak simply of a ‘family relationship’ (afnitas generis), but one copy of De origine calls Hinckaert a blood relation of Ruusbroec – cognati sui – rendered in the Middle Dutch translation simply as ‘his relative’ (sijn maech) and neve (meaning not only ‘nephew’ or ‘cousin’ but also, in a broader sense, ‘friend’ or ‘relative’).3\n\n2 The poem is the Vierde Martijn, published in Hegman 1958. On the comet occurring in this poem, see Van Gijsen 1993. For Velthem’s continuation of the Spiegel historiael, see book VI, chapters 6 and 21–25 (Vander Linden et al. 1906–38, vol. III).

For Ruusbroec’s illegitimate birth, see Martens 1990, esp. pp. 63–72 and Lievens 1981 (the latter also discusses the possibility of Hinckaert’s paternity, based on information taken from Schimmelpfennig 1979). For more on the\n\nbrussels\n\n13\n\nThe philological stemma of De origine and all its variants is, however, more transparent than the Hinckaerts’ family tree, which does in fact include a Jan who was a cousin of Jan Hinckaert. This Jan was the son of Willem van Eleghem, another presumably illegitimate descendant of Gerelm Hinckaert. This Willem has often been put forward as the possible father of the mystic, though he is certainly not the only candidate. Ruusbroec’s paternity has even been assigned to Jan Hinckaert himself. He would not have been the rst priest to succumb to the temptations of the esh, nor was it unusual for ordained priests to admit their progeny to their households and provide them with a good education. Prominent canons of the Chapter of St Gudula openly combined parenthood and important ecclesiastical functions. Ruusbroec counted this among the worst excesses of the clerical state: ‘Some, who live off the goods of the Holy Church and should be pure in body and soul, offer their children a home – openly and shamelessly, and with great pleasure, as though they had conceived them with a lawful wife.’4 Ruusbroec’s sharp tone seems to exonerate Hinckaert once and for all from any presumed paternity, since it is highly unlikely that the mystic would reproach Hinckaert in this way after living with him like a son for more than thirty years. There is nothing to indicate that Hinckaert’s relationship with his young house guest was anything more than the afnitas generis of which Pomerius writes; moreover, it is quite possible that Ruusbroec was not even related to the Hinckaerts on his father’s side. Remarkably, in their fruitless investigation into Ruusbroec’s ancestry, researchers have overlooked apparently much more concrete information on a woman who was possibly his sister: Margriet van Meerbeke. It was for this Rich Clare from the Brussels Coudenklooster that Ruusbroec would write On the Seven Enclosures, a text announced in a fteenth-century copy as ‘an epistle which the priest Jan Ruusbroec\n\nquestion of Ruusbroec’s paternal descent, see Stracke 1931, p. 73 and Axters 1950–60, vol.

That the scribe drew this conclusion is perfectly understandable. In the Enclosures Ruusbroec addresses Margriet three times as ‘dear sister’ (lieve zuster). These words could, of course, merely express affection for a nun, although the intimate tone and personal subject matter of the work written for Margriet give the impression that Ruusbroec was impelled by concern for the spiritual well-being of a kinswoman. In one place he seems to speak explicitly of family ties: ‘I want to teach my sister how to serve in humility and purity’.5 Apart from the Enclosures, we nd nothing to indicate that Margriet was Ruusbroec’s sister or half-sister, but the name Van Meerbeke does occur earlier in connection with the Hinckaert family. Opposite the nearly adjacent houses belonging to the chaplain Jan Hinckaert and his father, Gerelm, there lived around 1305 a beguine called Hedwig van Meerbeek, who was perhaps related to the Hinckaerts. Beguines who did not live in beguinages often remained in the family circle. This would clarify to some extent Ruusbroec’s relations with the Hinckaerts, but it does not solve the mystery of his paternity.6 * As unfortunate as it was in the fourteenth century to be an illegitimate child, Ruusbroec could consider himself blessed in his family ties, for his life certainly took a turn for the better in Brussels. Jan Hinckaert assumed the role of foster father and protector, seeing to it that his protégé received holy orders and was given a position as vicar choral at the Collegiate Church of St Gudula, meaning that, in the absence of one of the canons, Ruusbroec took his place in the liturgical ofces. To begin with, however, Hinckaert sent his young ward to school, for it was there that the foundation was laid for a career in the Church. That the boy’s education turned out as well as it did was entirely owing to Jan Hinckaert and his wealthy family. Ruusbroec had no doubt\n\n5 For the quotations, see the Enclosures: title variants (‘een epistel die her Jan Rusbruck seynde sijnder suster’) and 254–55 (‘ic wille leeren mier suster hoe si dienen sal in oetmoede ende in reynicheiden’). 6 On Ruusbroec and Margriet, see also V.2.

Another possible link between the Hinckaert and Meerbeke families is the Gerelm Hinckaert who was provost of the Brussels Canons of St Jacob op den Coudenberg from 1310 to 1329. He owned property in the village of Meerbeke (Van Derveeghde 1971, pp. 968–69).\n\nbrussels\n\n15\n\nFig. 1 Altar dedicated to Jan van Ruusbroec in the village church of Ruisbroek.\n\n16\n\nchapter i\n\nattended the parish school in his native village, but it was not customary for the child of a penniless beguine to receive advanced education at the chapter school. Only in 1358 did the Brussels chaplain Petrus van Huffel establish a fund to nance the education of twelve ‘poor pupils’ (bonifantes). When the wealthy Hinckaert family undertook to educate Ruusbroec, however, the cost would not have been a problem.7 It was only natural for Jan Hinckaert to take the youth under his wing; himself a chaplain, he had chosen the ecclesiastical career that was to be Ruusbroec’s future as well. Since 1296 Hinckaert had lived in a house near St Gudula’s, not far from the chapter school, which was the leading public institution of higher learning in Brussels and the surrounding area. Pupils coming from elsewhere were forced to seek board and lodging in the city. Those such as Ruusbroec who could nd accommodation with relatives possessed a distinct advantage. Hinckaert probably also paid the youngster’s school fees and the costs of his upkeep, for such expenses would have been well within his means. Hinckaert received a prebend for serving the chapel of St John the Evangelist in the Church of St Gudula. In 1304, the year Ruusbroec moved to Brussels, the chapel was founded by one Elisabeth, further described as the widow of Jan, son of Gerelm. Perhaps she also belonged to the Hinckaert family. If so, the chapel was a family matter, in terms of both capital and personnel, and by caring for young Ruusbroec, Jan Hinckaert may have been returning a favour. Relations of this kind between the chapter and the people of Brussels were the order of the day. Numerous chapels in the side aisles of St Gudula’s were served by priests from Brussels families and were endowed by relatives. Recorded variously as an intermediary, a curate and a witness, Jan Hinckaert was regularly involved in appointments and donations. As a networker in the ecclesiastical business of the city, he had plenty of opportunity to recommend his young protégé to the more pious members of the patriciate.8 The signicance of Hinckaert’s patronage for Ruusbroec’s development into a spiritual writer should not be underestimated. Other great 7 On Hinckaert’s involvement in Ruusbroec’s education, see Verdeyen 1981b, pp. 126 and 137 (De Leu 1885, pp. 273 and 284).

These German Dominicans grew up in an atmosphere in which their spiritual inclinations were fuelled by intensive study and constant contact with like-minded friars. Their order prepared them for a life of preaching the gospel. In comparison, Ruusbroec’s situation, rst as a vicar choral and later as a chaplain, would have been much less inspiring, but living as he did the life of a ‘very devout young cleric’ (zeer devoet jonghe clerc) in Hinckaert’s household would have given him the opportunity to immerse himself in scripture, as indeed most medieval schoolboys did. Holland’s court chaplain, Dirc van Delft, wrote around 1400 that the clerics’ duties included assisting the priest at Divine Ofce and at Mass. They were also expected, on their own, to chant psalms and study not only the Bible but also canon law and the customs of the Church.9 That Ruusbroec’s writings would one day push back the boundaries of Middle Dutch literature was due primarily to his innate disposition, but this achievement would have been impossible without a profound knowledge of theology. This phase in Ruusbroec’s development as an author unfolded chiey under the tutelage of Jan Hinckaert – in whom the mystic had found both a Maecenas and a mentor, for even though the wealthy priest’s primary concern was to look after young Ruusbroec as a member of the family, he must soon have perceived the boy’s exceptional character and talents. Although Pomerius suggests in De origine that only after a sudden conversion did Hinckaert abandon a way of life that was very worldly indeed, this is not to say that he had previously taken no interest in higher things. Hinckaert spent a large part of his income on the accessories of choral prayer. The archives reveal that he enriched Groenendaal’s collection of books by donating magnicent manuscripts for the liturgy: the priory’s best large breviary, for example, its best missal (in two volumes) and another liturgical book in ve parts, intended for the celebration of ‘three masses a week in perpetuity and for ever more’. In 1350 Hinckaert also donated a beautiful\n\n9 On Ruusbroec’s social position, see Warnar 1997b, esp. pp. 108–11 and Warnar 1999a, pp. 379–85.

The owner of such valuable books and precious objects must have been both a rich man and a devoted priest, for it was certainly not customary, among Hinckaert’s fellow clerics, to own a personal reference library for the liturgical ofce, even assuming they could afford it. A look at his priestly belongings suggests that Hinckaert took his task seriously, and the example he set no doubt exerted a powerful inuence on the young Ruusbroec.10 Jan Hinckaert would have had to further the ecclesiastical career of his ward in another way as well. Ofcially the higher ordinations were reserved for priests born in wedlock. Illegitimate sons were excluded from the priesthood as long as the problem of their defectus natalium had not been solved by dispensation. This could be obtained by submitting a petition to the department of the papal Curia specially created to handle dispensational procedures: the penitentiaria apostolica. The granting of dispensation entailed costs that, for many, proved an insurmountable obstacle on the path to ecclesiastical ofce. On this score, too, Ruusbroec was doubtless indebted to his family. Anyone who hopes to nd the key to Ruusbroec’s paternity in the papal archives is looking for the proverbial needle in the haystack – the haystack consisting in this case of the sixteen-volume inventory of the missives issued by John XXII during his ponticate (1316–34). In the indexes to these books (which alone ll three volumes), the name Johannes occurs many times with reference to individuals from all over Europe. Not one, however, seems identiable as the young ‘Johannes van Ruusbroec’, but this is no reason to relegate the petite histoire of Ruusbroec’s illegitimate birth to the realm of fantasy. Sometimes one stroke of the papal pen was all it took to release whole groups from the defectus natalium. On 14 February 1317 dispensation was granted in one fell swoop to three hundred unnamed brothers with an ordained father or unwed parents. On 13 December of the same year, ten unspecied clerics received the same favour. These high numbers have to do with a new ponticate, in this case that of John XXII. The installation of a new pope was a suitable moment for grace and dispensation; perhaps Ruusbroec – ordained as a priest in 1318 – also availed himself of this opportunity.11 10 Regarding Hinckaert’s property, see Dykmans 1940, pp. 175 and 341–42: ‘van 3 missen ter weken ewelic ende emmermeer ghedaen te werden’. 11 On the removal of the defectus natalium, see Schimmelpfennig 1979, p. 46 (also p. 37 regarding the beginning of a ponticate as an appropriate time to grant dispen-\n\nbrussels\n\n19\n\nRuusbroec did not have to worry too much that his request would be denied. During the ponticate of John XXII, the pope and his agents signed more than six hundred letters releasing prospective priests from their defectus natalium. The glorious ecclesiastical career that was possible after dispensation is illustrated by the story of Jan van Esselen, a Brussels canon who may well have been a personal acquaintance of Ruusbroec. This Jan was a nephew of Vranke vanden Coudenberg – the later provost of Groenendaal – who at some point joined Ruusbroec and Jan Hinckaert in their Brussels household. Jan van Esselen was granted dispensation for his illegitimate birth no fewer than four times, which enabled his career to advance by leaps and bounds. Perhaps his spectacular progress was due in large part to his father, none other than Jan II, Duke of Brabant, who had fathered the boy on Coudenberg’s sister Elisabeth, just as she was on the point of becoming a hospital sister.12 There are similarities here to Ruusbroec’s presumed ancestry, but his humble ofce of chaplain suggests that his mother’s romance was less princely, and thus less conducive to a secure future. According to Pomerius, Ruusbroec’s dead mother appeared to him in visions, asking how long it would be before he was ordained, for only then would she be released from purgatory. On the day Ruusbroec rst said Mass, it was revealed to him that his mother had been assumed into heavenly glory. Was Ruusbroec stricken with remorse at the fate of his mother, whom he had barely seen since his departure for Brussels? Or was he plagued by doubt about the outcome of his request for dispensation? These visions made such a deep impression on Ruusbroec that he was still talking about them as an old man in Groenendaal. Moreover, one might be inclined to see the impact of this childhood experience on the passage from The Spiritual Espousals about praying for the souls of those in purgatory. It is possible, Ruusbroec asserts, for ‘the spirit of God’ (den gheeste gods) to prompt one to pray for one person in particular. Provided this is not self-gratication but the work of the Holy Spirit, and provided the prayer is heartfelt and fervent, then the person praying\n\nsation).

His personal outpourings can be counted on the ngers of one hand, for he almost always kept silent about his own religious experiences. Ruusbroec’s works have been praised up to the present day as the fruits of a rich spiritual life, which makes his seeming reluctance to speak of his own religious sensibility all the more curious. Receptiveness to visions was considered one of the hallmarks of the mystic, but nearly all the information on Ruusbroec’s spiritual intuition comes from Pomerius’s chronicle. When the mystic speaks of visions and revelations, he bases himself on a set typology rooted in old theories of the Church Father Augustine.14 In the coming chapters we will often nd that Ruusbroec’s texts are more useful in gleaning information about his library than in plumbing the depths of his soul. Perhaps, however, we should make a virtue of necessity by interpreting the few facts at our disposal and concluding that the successful composition of the Espousals reects the equilibrium of the author, who was obviously able to resist the potentially unsettling inuences of life in a bustling city like Brussels. Ruusbroec’s intellectual life continued to grow even as the disastrous events of the fourteenth century unfolded. Two years after Ruusbroec had moved into Jan Hinckaert’s household, Duke Jan II cruelly ended the short-lived regime of the Brussels guilds. The textile workers, who had driven the rich patricians out of the town hall, were in turn crushed by the duke’s troops. More than seventy insurgents were killed in the struggle, and a number of their comrades buried alive. Brabantine chroniclers remembered this popular uprising – which likewise took place in other cities in Brabant – as one of the most dramatic events in more than a century. This is also how they characterised the pilgrimage to the Holy Land undertaken several years later by a group of paupers and vagabonds from Brabant. Before this motley multitude\n\n13 Espousals b1199–1207 (quotation b1207). Van Mierlo 1910, p. 259, was the rst to establish this connection between Ruusbroec’s life and work. 14 See Langer 1987, pp. 215–20, on typology, as well as Espousals b549–591. See also II.3.\n\nbrussels\n\n21\n\neven crossed the duchy’s borders, their pilgrimage had deteriorated into murder and mayhem.15 None of this tumult resounds in Ruusbroec’s books. Medieval mysticism may have been a social phenomenon, but it was far too focused on immutable truths to create much social tension. Nevertheless, the incidents occurring in Brussels, as well as the 1315 famine recorded by Lodewijk van Velthem, were signs of Ruusbroec’s troubled times. Despite this baleful backdrop to the fourteenth century, the young mystic derived such strength from his trust in God that his religious convictions took precedence over all else. This made one capable of uplifting the mind above all humankind, the lofty heights inwardly pursued. To behold the Lord’s goodness, and ee His unlikeness, that is spiritual fortitude. dat ghemoede verheven boven alle die leven op gherecht in innicheyt. Die goedde Gods te aensiene al onghelijc te vliene dat es gheestelijcke starckheit.16\n\nSummarising strophes of this kind can be found at the end of each chapter of Ruusbroec’s earliest work, The Realm of Lovers. Encapsulated in these lines of verse is a transcendental philosophy of life that proposes to banish all worldly thoughts as potential pitfalls on the path to God. These lines probably date from so long after the Brussels revolt or the famine of 1315 that there is no need to suspect them of religious escapism. The pious verses articulate a message of complete self-abnegation: He who yearns for earthly savour cannot gain in any measure utmost joy and ecstasy. He cannot be illuminated, for his mind is inundated with pictures of mortality.\n\n15 Brabantsche Yeesten, book V, verses 501–622; quotation 617–22 (Willems & Bormans 1839–69, vol. II).

His talent for renouncing all earthly pleasures must have been impressive indeed, but effort was required none the less. This becomes abundantly clear when reading two songs (cantiones) included as an encore in the Latin edition of Ruusbroec’s works printed by the Carthusians of Cologne in 1552. In the cantiones the poet applauds a new-found frame of mind in which he rises above himself to reach mystical heights, but this supernatural state of awareness cannot be attained without a struggle: Now I have renounced all things; my being is so rich that no one can tempt me any more. Earlier, when I was pitifully led astray and trapped, the world held me so much in thrall that I could not in the least escape the burden; I had strayed so far from myself in uctuating and unstable things. But now I have found release from these bonds, a release I have long sought and often attempted.18\n\nIs this Ruusbroec’s account of his spiritual breakthrough? Ruusbroec’s authorship of the poems has often been questioned, even after a Dutch version of the songs was found in a manuscript lled with Latin texts relating to Ruusbroec – including copies of letters addressed to him. Strong objections to Ruusbroec’s possible authorship were based on the exultant tone of the songs and their autobiographical nature, which differs greatly from the objective approach typical of Ruusbroec’s treatises. These differences, however, characterise the genres more than the author. The treatise was the appropriate form for discourse, whereas the conventions of the medieval lyric were more conducive to expressing emotions. This did not necessarily emanate from an irrepressible urge to express oneself; it could just as easily be prompted by a desire to inspire or edify.19\n\n17\n\nRealm 2222–27.

II, p. 241 – Ruusbroec’s authorship of the two songs is rejected. 18\n\nbrussels\n\n23\n\nThe (pseudo-)biographical nature of the songs does not argue against Ruusbroec’s authorship. In the summarising strophes of the Realm – Ruusbroec’s rst work – the mystic seems preoccupied with his new insights. Even though the preceding text gives no reason for it, he repeatedly stresses that ‘earthly savour’ (eertsche smake) and the yearning for ‘praise and honour’ (lof ende eere) seriously hamper mystical ascent.20 All things considered, we are perfectly entitled to attribute the songs to Ruusbroec. When the two texts were last published as his work, the editors considered them youthful writings. There is much to be said for this hypothesis. Certainly in the rst song, the poet – taking the tone of an infatuated youth – exults in the budding happiness of his experience of God. Ruusbroec wrote in the Espousals that such jubilance was granted to human beings ‘at the beginning, when they turn away from the world, on the condition that they make a total conversion and give up all the consolation of the world’. He added that spiritual intoxication, once experienced, was no guarantee of enduring ‘knowledge of the truth’ (kennisse der waerheit) and – even worse – could be turned by conceit into ‘false sweetness’ (valse soeticheit). It seems that Ruusbroec had learned from experience. When he penned his songs, the mystic was so caught up in the change brought about by his introspection that he gave little thought to the side effects. ‘Oh, what bliss it is to enjoy God!’ (Och, wat vrouden is gode gebruken!), rejoices the poet, and he praises those capable of sharing this higher truth. To which we must add, based on the Latin translation: ‘It is difcult to discover their equals.’21 The Dutch version of the songs lacks these self-satised stanzas, as well as the autobiographical lines at the beginning. Have we stumbled across corrections made by the poet himself, who later found this ode to his spiritual conversion too exuberant? If so, it would provide us with further grounds for attributing the songs to Ruusbroec, for in his later prose texts he excelled in subordinating personal experience to general truths. Even so, this change in his tone of voice came about only gradually.\n\nThe editors of Ruusbroec’s Werken did, however, include the Latin text of the songs (vol. IV, pp. LXI–LXIII and 284–85). 20 Cf. Realm 1049–54, 1067–69 and 2054–56. See Szöverffy 1983, p. 555, with regard to the conventions of lyrical poetry (cf. Willaert 1984 and Reynaert 1994 on the mystical poetry of Hadewijch).

The quotations from the songs are taken from Lievens 1957a, pp. 122 and 120.\n\n24\n\nchapter i 2. Lessons and Liturgy\n\nRuusbroec’s rst years in Brussels were spent largely within a triangle formed by the house of Jan Hinckaert, the Church of St Gudula and the chapter school, which was housed in a former granary. Lessons started at six in the morning and went on until four or ve in the afternoon, with only an occasional break to allow the boys to participate as choristers in the celebration of the Divine Ofce. This strenuous schedule lled all seven days of the week.22 Preparation for liturgical duties was an important part of the boys’ education. The chapter schools were intended mainly to provide the personnel to carry out Church business. School and Divine Ofce were so closely related that the functions of Latin master and cantor (who supervised the performance of the music sung at Divine Ofce) could be fullled by one and the same person. In his treatise On Seven Rungs, Ruusbroec devised a sublime metaphor for a heavenly choir with Christ as ‘our cantor and our headmaster’ (onse kantere ende onse overmeester), who sings in exemplary fashion ‘the tenor part and the cadences’ (tenuere ende slote) with graceful ‘ornamentation’ ( oruere) and a melodious ‘descant’ (discant). This passage, full of terms from the liturgical ars musica, is the earliest record of polyphonic choral music in Brussels, certainly if Ruusbroec was drawing on memories from his own schooldays, which seems to be the case here. Indeed, several pages earlier he portrays a humble man as an inquisitive pupil: ‘a pupil of our Lord, always receiving from God the discipline of true peace’.23 Discipline meant both edication and regimentation, for the schools were very strict indeed. The busy Latin master, who seldom had an assistant, was forced to rule with an iron hand. It is hardly surprising,\n\n22 See in general Post 1954, Nauwelaerts 1980 and Van Buuren 1995 regarding medieval education at town and chapter schools in the Low Countries. See Valkestijn 1989, pp. 173–223, for the connection between school and choral singing. Regarding the school in Brussels, see Lamy 1924–25; Lefèvre 1942, pp. 210–42; De Ridder 1987–88, pp. 25–28. 23 Quotations Rungs 820, 837, 874–78 and 677–78: ‘scolier ons heeren, altoes ontfaende van gode discipline ghewareghs vreden’. See Baratz 1994, p. 217, on the roles of cantor and Latin master at the Chapter of St Gudula, which were separate functions in the fteenth century, although at this time a manuscript (which had been donated to the chapter) containing the school text Gnotosolitos by the Groenendaal canon Arnoldus of Rotterdam was chained to the cantor’s choir stall (Lefèvre 1932, De Backer 1987 regarding the text). Cf. De Ridder 1987–88, pp. 21–23. See Haggh 1994 about singing in church in medieval Brussels.\n\nbrussels\n\n25\n\ntherefore, that medieval miniatures often portray teachers as canewielding keepers of order. Even Ruusbroec had vivid memories of the master’s arsenal. Later on, in On the Spiritual Tabernacle, he continued to link the symbolic meaning of ferula (the giant fennel plant) to obedience, because its stalks were used to make the rods ‘with which they beat schoolboys’ (daer men die scoliere mede sleet).24 Admittedly, it cannot have been easy for teachers to preserve the peace, given the wide variety of pupils in their classes. The chapter school had originally been established to train choristers, but these choirboys found themselves in the company of middle-class youths, aspiring canons in need of further study and underage vicars choral such as Ruusbroec. There were no girls at his school, for the simple reason that women were not admitted to ecclesiastical ofce and were therefore excluded from advanced education. This mixed bag of pupils – of various ages to boot – were served a curriculum consisting of three main ingredients: grammar, music and dialectics. Their musical education was dominated by the liturgy. Dialectics offered the most advanced pupils a brief look at Aristotelian logic, which had been taking root in European schools and universities since the twelfth century. The subject of grammar – which consisted of far more than merely reading, writing and speaking Latin correctly – took up the lion’s share of the lessons. Building on an intensive course of language acquisition, one could expand the grammar lessons to include stylistics, composition, oratorical skill and related rhetorical disciplines.25 It is impossible to paint a clearer picture of Ruusbroec’s education, considering that the curriculum was entirely dependent on the person in charge. The teacher discussed material taken from a personally compiled textbook, which he provided with glosses and commentary as he saw t. The curriculum could therefore vary greatly, depending on the teacher’s religious afliation, expertise and preferences. Thus the Antwerp magistrates’ clerk Jan van Boendale – in Der leken spiegel (The Layman’s Mirror), which he wrote around 1330 – seemed to ignore traditional views when following the authority of his master, naming theology as one of the seven liberal arts, even ‘the most sacred and\n\n24\n\nTabernacle 5:4304. On disciplina at school, see Kintzinger 1996, pp. 2–3. See in general Van Buuren 1995, Post 1954, pp. 92–118 and Köhn 1986, pp. 231–42. 25\n\n26\n\nchapter i\n\nthe best’, because it explains scripture. As unexpected as Boendale’s opinion may be for anyone familiar with the liberal arts, his remarks clearly evoke the hallowed sphere of a chapter school providing Bible study (for this, it seems, is what Boendale took ‘theology’ to be) at a level meriting its upgrade to the status of a liberal art.26 The kind of education Ruusbroec received is also revealed by an ordinance decreed by Duke Jan III in 1320, which put an end to a dispute in Brussels concerning the city’s schools. Dissatisfaction with the instruction offered at the chapter school had led several citizens to found their own schools, which were a thorn in the side of the Chapter of St Gudula. The duke recognised the exclusive right of the chapter to offer advanced education at the Latin school, but he also ordered the establishment of ve new primary schools, where boys would be taught the rudiments of Latin, after which they would ‘go to high school, to be taught grammar, music and ethics ( goeden seden)’. Remarkably, ethics had taken the place of dialectics. This change in the curriculum no doubt reected the wishes of the patriciate. The urban activities of trade and government were better served by young men with social skills and goeden seden (literally ‘good manners’) than by experts in logic or even theology.27 Modern-day scholars discussing the level and organisation of medieval Latin schools often emphasise the profane element, which is justiable only to a point. Even chapter schools, under pressure from the patriciate, could not avoid a certain degree of secularisation, but until well into the fteenth century the Church continued to provide the institutional framework needed to train a literate clergy. Even after 1320, when the duke’s decree led to differentiation in education, the Brussels chapter school remained a classic institution for the education of the clergy, an institution whose signicance for Middle Dutch literature is only just beginning to emerge.28 *\n\n26 Der leken spiegel, book III, chapter 14, verses 73–108 (De Vries 1844–48). On Boendale and Der leken spiegel, see Kinable 1998 and Reynaert 2002. 27 The ordinance is quoted from Van Buuren 1995, p. 222, where the Brussels problems are also treated. 28 In the fteenth century the logic of Petrus Hispanus was back in the Brussels curriculum (see Lefèvre 1942, p. 220). Cf. Köhn 1986, pp. 282–84, on the high level of education, whereas only basic writing skills were needed to be a merchant’s clerk or secretary.\n\nbrussels\n\n27\n\nLike most of the pupils at the Latin school, Ruusbroec followed a fouryear course of instruction, by the end of which the boys were steeped in the language of education and the Church. The world of learning lay open to them. Those harbouring scholarly ambitions still had a long way to go, following a path that led them through the faculties of the universities – a route that generally distanced them from literature written in the vernacular. This was the path taken by Ruusbroec’s fellow townsman – and possibly fellow pupil – Jan van Brussel, who entered the order of the Cistercians at the Abbey of Villers, thirty kilometres south of Brussels, and in 1313 enrolled at the study house of his order at the Sorbonne, where he took the degree of Master in Theology before returning to Villers to assume the ofce of abbot. An extensive collection of Jan van Brussel’s sermons in Latin has survived, but not one word in his mother tongue.29 University graduates were very much in the minority among Middle Dutch authors, most of whom discontinued their schooling after their years at the chapter or town school. This level of education was generally not enough for them to make a serious contribution, as Jan van Brussel did, to Latin literature, but this did not relegate the Middle Dutch language and its literature to the sidelines of intellectual history. The wealth and depth of the Dutch literature stemming from Ruusbroec’s century is certainly due to the authors’ high level of education. The texts known to have been part of the medieval school curriculum range widely over rhetoric, biblical history, general historiography, hagiography, biology, geography, astronomy, medicine, ethics, theology and spirituality – much of which had permeated Dutch literature at the turn of the fourteenth century through the works of Jacob van Maerlant, whom Jan van Boendale referred to as the ‘father of Dutch literature altogether’ (vader der dietsche dichtren algader). Around 1330 Boendale combined a large number of these subjects in Der leken spiegel (The Layman’s Mirror), an encyclopaedic work in the form of a didactic poem. Other pedagogical writings in Middle Dutch opened up windows to the world of ethical and religious issues. Such reading matter was part of the self-fashioning activities of the laity rather than the school curriculum, although there, too, the Latin of the lessons must occasionally have been mixed with the vernacular. Or is it merely a coincidence that the oldest manuscript containing Middle Dutch biblical texts on\n\n29\n\nOn Jan van Brussel and his sermons, see Falmagne 1992 and 1993.\n\n28\n\nchapter i\n\nthe life of Jesus is lled with glosses and notes that were clearly written by a teacher? The Latin source text of this so-called Harmony of the Gospels was a classic textbook used in religious education. Other Dutch translations of Latin religious texts may also have originated in the sphere of chapter and monastery school. In Ruusbroec’s immediate circle, translations were made of Hugh of St Victor’s Soliloquium, the Manuale (attributed to Augustine) and the Meditationes piisimae de cognitione humanae condicionis – all belonging to the standard corpus of devotional literature but also used for educational purposes. The thirteenth-century cantor (and possibly also Latin master) Simon van Tongeren owned a manuscript containing copies of these works and other school texts.30 Middle Dutch literature and the curriculum of the chapter school overlapped in many areas, and this undoubtedly held true for Ruusbroec’s oeuvre as well. He concluded his last work, On the Twelve Beguines, with an adaptation of the Middle Dutch Harmony of the Gospels, and he had opened his debut, The Realm of Lovers, with a sketch of Creation, as was customary in medieval encyclopaedic literature. The Trinity, the heavenly spheres, the four elements, choirs of angels and human nature are examined in the xed order of a genre that systematically described various aspects of the medieval world view, just as Jan van Boendale had done – in a much simpler way – in Der leken spiegel.31 Later on, Ruusbroec’s imagery was frequently inspired by the natural sciences, encompassing everything from the animal kingdom to the cosmos and from the bodily humours (humores) to pathology. Because of Ruusbroec’s interest in the artes, some of his texts were even included in a recent compendium of Middle Dutch literature on the seven liberal arts – even though his mystical philosophy of nature belongs much more to the sphere of literary symbolism than to the genre of such truly scholarly textbooks as the thirteenth-century Natuurkunde van het geheelal (Natural\n\n30 On translated school texts in general, see Henkel 1988 and Woods & Copeland 1999.

The latter text was certainly one of Ruusbroec’s sources (Schepers 1999).\n\nbrussels\n\n29\n\nScience of the Universe). This rhyming Middle Dutch cosmography was in fact one of Ruusbroec’s sources, but whereas Boendale sought in the Natuurkunde information to add to Der leken spiegel, the mystic found therein a metaphor comparing the changing moods in man’s spiritual life with the unfolding of the four seasons.32 The factual knowledge on which attention was focused in texts like Der leken spiegel played only a small role in Ruusbroec’s transcendental world view. Boendale’s encyclopaedia was a kind of general ars vivendi written for a public that had no need of profound reections on the Holy Trinity or the religious psychology at the heart of Ruusbroec’s work. School instruction did in fact delve deeply into the theological doctrine of the divine and the make-up of the human soul. This emerges from other instructional texts, such as the Latin Elucidarium, a dialogue between a master and a student (clerc in Middle Dutch), which begins with such questions as ‘What is God?’ and ‘How should one envision the Trinity?’ The Middle Dutch Lucidarius, however, discusses these matters only ‘in so far as they can be explained to the laity’, but this constraint did not apply to the original Latin text, which was taught at the chapter school.33 There Ruusbroec received theological instruction at a rather high level, though characterised by a certain traditionalism. Prospective priests were not trained to take part in scholastic debate but rather to sing God’s praises in the celebration of the Divine Ofce. Young clerics were instructed in the religious truths on which the liturgy was based. This somewhat conservative approach corresponded to the prole of Middle Dutch authors of Ruusbroec’s day, who showed a deep interest in the mystery of the divine but were not specialised in theology as an academic discipline. Their religious ideas were nurtured more by the liturgy of the Church than by the scholasticism of the university. This 32 On Ruusbroec and the arts, see Jansen Sieben 1989, p. 73 and De Baere 1991.

Having been trained in the same sphere of religious schooling and Divine Ofce, Ruusbroec produced in his rst work – in resourcefully sustained parallel sentences betraying almost no hint of hesitation – an ode to the ‘groundless Godhead’ ( grondeloser godheyt) of which this quotation comprises only one-third: He is a beauty that enriches the realms of heaven and earth. He is a richness out of which all creatures have owed and in which they have essentially remained. He is an honour to the realms of heaven and earth and all creatures. He is a life in which everything lives that ever was and ever shall be. He is a victory in which one conquers all things. He is the crown with which the victors will be crowned. He is health: whosoever attains Him will henceforth be cured. He is peace in which all lovers rest. He is security: whosoever obtains Him wants for nothing. He is the blessedness that gives enjoyment. He is a consolation that gladdens the sorrowful. He is the sweetness that permeates those who desire. He is joy: those who love exult in Him. He is the source of joy; those who take pleasure melt away in Him. And He is jubilation, that is, a joy inexpressible in words, in which all senses and faculties fail.35\n\n* 34 For Vander drievoudichede, see Verdam & Leendertsz 1918, pp. 61–85, with identication of the sources in the commentary (pp. 182–95); cf.

More so than discipline, method or material, it was literary awareness that Ruusbroec retained from his years in the old granary. Schooled in rhetoric and receptive to things religious, he developed, slowly but surely, a feeling for the right balance between wordcraft and religious experience, which lent his mystical language an expressiveness all its own. Through his Latin master, Ruusbroec became acquainted with literary techniques relating to genre, structure and style. He studied Ovid, Virgil and other classical writers to become procient in the arts and conventions of language – in this case Latin – as a means of literary expression. The rhetorical legacy of antiquity could be taught without difculty in the religious environment of monastic and chapter schools. After centuries of adaptation, selection and mystication, the antique tradition had been so profoundly Christianised that Jacob van Maerlant could assume on good authority that Seneca had been baptised by the Apostle Paul. However, in spite of this antique-profane element in education, Ruusbroec lived from his earliest schooldays in a world pervaded by the language of the Bible. He probably learned his rst Latin by studying the Psalms while still at the parish school in his native village, but at the chapter school in Brussels he no doubt studied every detail of this biblical book, the verses of which occur in every part of the Divine Ofce. The Psalms offered, moreover, models for hymns, prayers and other devotional texts which had a great impact on Dutch vernacular authors, even those less sensitive than Ruusbroec. The sources of Maerlant’s Strosche gedichten (Strophic Poems) lie in the same sphere of hymns that inspired Hadewijch. In imitation of this great beguine and poetess, a stream of religious verse owed forth in Middle Dutch that did not fail to touch Ruusbroec. His previously discussed strophic songs, as well as the rhymed passages in his prose tracts, display an afnity with this mystical poetry.36 Writing in verse, however, quickly became a matter of secondary importance for Ruusbroec. Through study, practice and experimentation,\n\n36 On the inuence and use of biblical and devotional texts, see Alford 1973, Pranger 1995, Gehl 1984 and Riché 1985, pp. 135–37. See Van Oostrom 1996a, pp. 75–84, on Maerlant’s sources for the Strosche gedichten and Warnar 2000a, p. 700 and n. 68, on mystical poetry from Ruusbroec’s circle.\n\n32\n\nchapter i\n\nhe explored literary language and the effect of stylistic techniques. The Realm of Lovers and On the Twelve Beguines, two treatises which for various reasons may be described as works in progress, act as showcases of style and genre: treatise, sermon, allegory, exegesis, (rhyming) dialogue, prayer, instruction, meditation – and all of it rmly rooted in scripture. Biblical imitatio must have become second nature to Ruusbroec while still at school. God’s word had given Christian thought a vocabulary and a form in a rich literary tradition with which Ruusbroec became thoroughly familiar in a daily school routine that alternated between lessons and liturgy. Both biblical study and Divine Ofce contributed to Ruusbroec’s religious literacy. He consciously modelled his exalted prose on God’s word, using biblical imagery, references to scripture and ingenious exegesis. A systematic study of Ruusbroec and the Bible – a task calling for an expert – would ll a sizeable volume. Here, by way of illustration, are a number of excerpts from the easily recognisable adaptation of the Middle Dutch Harmony of the Gospels appearing in the Beguines. This work stems from the latter years of Ruusbroec’s writing career, but his treatment of what is obviously a school text is especially illuminating in the context of this chapter. While still at school, Ruusbroec could have practised the rhetorical technique he learned as amplicatio (elaboration) on this type of text. Every detail of the Passion story is broadly treated in the Beguines, and even the simple statement that Jesus prayed at length in the garden of Gethsemane is given a deeper meaning: His [ Jesus’] spirit was lifted up above all, empty and free, blessed and united to God in love. His rational soul was full of grace, wise and clear, inner and devout, desiring and praying for those for whom he would die. But all His sensibility was in fear and apprehension and full of images of suffering and bitter death. This is why he prayed at length.\n\nHere Ruusbroec was not merely putting a literary technique into practice. By elaborating upon the differences between emotion and strength of mind, he enriched the biblical text as material for meditation, dwelling exclusively on personal experience and empathy. This spiritual reading of Holy Scripture, or lectio divina, was an age-old tradition in contemplative monastic culture, but as a rhetorical technique it had made its way by Ruusbroec’s time into the curriculum taught at such religious institutions as collegiate churches, where liturgy was the focal point and pupils were instructed in the language of the Bible.37 37\n\nBeguines 2c, pp. 61–66: ‘Sijn [ Jesus’] gheest was boven al verhaven, leedich ende\n\nbrussels\n\n33\n\nRuusbroec’s account of the Passion was clearly shaped by the combined inuence of school and Divine Ofce. Adhering to a widely known meditational framework, he divided the Passion among the seven canonical hours, just as Jan van Boendale had done in Der leken spiegel. As though stressing the differences between their versions, Ruusbroec rened the customary division into canonical hours by having the individual events of the Passion correspond to the smaller units of the nocturnes from the breviary – the book from which priests recited the Divine Ofce. Ruusbroec expressly forged a link with the Divine Ofce by rst citing a version of the verse from Psalm 51 with which the Hours begin: Lord, open my heart and my mouth, I shall proclaim Thy praise and Thy glory. Lord, look upon me and make haste to help me, that I may accomplish Thy praise and Thy service. Lord, Thou hast beheld me in eternity, called and chosen [me], [thou hast been] well disposed [towards me] and loved [me], provided I believe in Thee and wish freely to serve Thee until death. For Thou hast created us after Thine image, that is to be one with Thee in love. And Thou hast created us in Thine own likeness, that we, by Thy grace, might be like Thee in all ways of virtue. And Thou hast abased Thyself beneath all and elevated us above all that Thou hast created. And Thou hast loved us so greatly that Thou hast visited us in this exile. Thou hast taken our humanity and put it on. Thou wast born at night of the Virgin Mary and laid in a manger, small and humble between two beasts. Thou hast enriched the night by Thy birth. The angels sang Thy praise: people of good will who live for Thee, possess in Thee eternal peace. Here we begin the rst nocturne or hour of our Matins, in remembrance of the Passion of our Lord.38\n\nlos, salich ende gode gheenicht in minne.

Ruusbroec combined the characteristics of the Psalms as the medieval model for prayer with the gospels’ redemptive history of suffering and salvation. For those who understand the allusions, this introduction alone harbours a wealth of meaning. The prayer is a rhetorically constructed gura – literally a ‘gure of speech’ – based on the rst Latin words that Ruusbroec had ever murmured in the Divine Ofce, the reciting of which marked the beginning of a pupil’s long path to literacy.39 As far as Ruusbroec’s later life is concerned, the most important facet of his schooldays was undoubtedly this intimate acquaintance with the Divine Ofce. As a chorister and vicar choral, he could let his pious spirit mature in the sacred sphere of the liturgy, the extraordinary effects of which were elucidated in countless stories. An exemplum made the rounds, for example, about a devout but intellectually limited youth to whom all the secrets of Holy Writ – in the guise of a magnicent palace – were suddenly revealed during the Divine Ofce. But when he opened his eyes he could not remember anything.40 Whether Ruusbroec was ever that deeply touched by the liturgical setting is not part of recorded history, but in the Realm he already reveals his lifelong susceptibility to the age-old ceremonials of the Divine Ofce that provided the longing for God with a formal framework. Many years later – while writing On Seven Rungs – Ruusbroec was still fascinated by the liturgy. More than half of this relatively short work treats the importance of ‘desiring the honour of God above all things’ (begheeren de eere gods boven alle ding) and of ‘giving God praise and honour according to His worthiness’ ( gode lof ende eere gheven na dat hi weerdegh es). Ruusbroec sees the fullment of this desire in three ‘modes of practice’ (wisen van ufeninghen). Each mode consists of three elements that reect all the stages of the striving towards God in divine worship: praying, worshipping and loving; desiring, beseeching and longing; thanking, praising and glorifying. That Ruusbroec’s respect for the liturgy can be traced to his schooldays emerges a few pages later, where the author\n\nghedincken der passien ons heeren.’ See Kors 1998, p. 61 ff., on the division of the Passion and Divine Ofce.

Years of Silence Around 1310 Ruusbroec left the chapter school for good, but many years would pass before the young cleric emerged as the great master of The Spiritual Espousals. This text is customarily dated to 1330 or after. Before the Espousals, Ruusbroec wrote The Realm of Lovers, which he initially refused to put into circulation. We have no concrete information about Ruusbroec’s life from the time he left school until he wrote the Espousals – his actual debut – apart from his ordination in 1318 and an agreement made with Jan Hinckaert in 1327, whereby the mystic came to own one-eighth of a mill (the Kerkhofmolen) at Schaarbeek, north of Brussels. The management of this property, however, certainly occupied Ruusbroec less than his own spiritual enrichment. If Pomerius is to be believed, solitude and self-discipline were the precepts governing Ruusbroec’s life. With no concern for outward appearances, he led a solitary life because he found that it furthered his spiritual development. The introspective mystic provoked mixed reactions. When Ruusbroec walked the streets of Brussels ‘inwardly exalted in spirit’ (verhaven van bynnen inden gheest), some passers-by would stare at him in admiration, while others, glad not to be in his shoes, shook their heads in disapproval, which prompted Ruusbroec to think to himself: ‘Oh, how little you have tasted of the sweetness savoured by those who have tasted of the Holy Spirit.’ Pomerius was probably tempted to use this interior monologue because of its dramatic effect, but the words – even if apocryphal – are very apt indeed. Ruusbroec seems to have had the same critical observers in mind when writing about rude people (rudes) in his songs: ‘If I were to reveal my jubilance to them, they would rob me of my honour. The most sensible thing to do is to tolerate this for the time being, for I know I am eternally above time and this lls my heart with extraordinary joy.’42 41 See Realm 1088–93 and Rungs 314–15 and 387. Cf. also Noë 2001, pp. 77–146, with regard to the feudalism metaphor in the Realm. A substantial part of the imagery discussed there shows a resemblance to liturgical terminology. 42 On the dating and chronology of Ruusbroec’s works, see Warnar 1994; see exhib. cat. Ruusbroec 1981, no. 15, regarding the mill (Kerkhofmolen). See Verdeyen 1981b,\n\n36\n\nchapter i\n\nRuusbroec felt compelled to turn away from the world. In his last work, On the Twelve Beguines, he was still advising those ‘who in their youth promise purity to God, whether inside or outside an order’, to seek solace in fasting, praying and keeping vigil, to ‘be eager to read and hear the word of God and be alone at all times, and neither seek nor desire lust or pleasure in God or in creatures’.43 Applied to Ruusbroec’s own life, these words go some way towards explaining the years of silence preceding the Espousals. Ruusbroec sought the spiritual solitude necessary for complete absorption in his lofty reections, until he was able to write, on the basis of his own experience and meditation, about contact with the ‘eternal essence’ (ewich wesen), which took place far beyond the senses. The songs, however, were not Ruusbroec’s denitive mode of expression for his mystical wisdom. The adventure of experiencing God, which he had applauded in the songs as a source of perfect joy, was discussed in the Espousals with a well-developed feeling for the composition of scholastic texts and a thorough knowledge of profound theological ideas. Short outbursts of verse still feature in the Realm, but slowly the poet gave way to the thinker. En route to the Espousals Ruusbroec resolved to pour his mystical inspiration into the intellectual mould of the treatise. At rst glance Ruusbroec seems simply to have followed contemporary trends in literature. Learned brothers in the mendicant orders were embroiled in a lively debate on the metaphysics of mysticism, and their ideas found their way into the vernacular through written sermons and tracts. Close examination of the Espousals reveals just how surprising its theological content really is, especially if we recall that Ruusbroec’s training as a chaplain made him an intellectual lightweight compared with the well-schooled Dominicans who set the tone in contemporary mystical theology. A well-known name in Ruusbroec’s milieu was Hendrik of Leuven, who around 1300 was serving as prior of the Dominicans in his native city. This former lector at the prestigious studium generale of the Dominicans at Cologne certainly surpassed Ruusbroec in erudition and expertise, but as an author of Middle Dutch prose Hendrik\n\np. 138 (De Leu 1885, pp. 285–86) for the comments of passers-by: ‘Ach mensche, hoe luttel hebstu ghesmaect der sueticheit die die gene gevoelen die ghesmaect hebben des heiligen gheestes.’ For the poems, see Lievens 1957a, pp. 120–22. 43 Quotation Beguines 2b/1681–85: ‘gherne lesen ende hooren dat wort gods ende alle tijt gherne alleene sijn; ende in gode noch in creatueren ghelost noch ghenuechte sueken noch begheren’.\n\nbrussels\n\n37\n\nof Leuven – whose only writings in the vernacular consist of a single sermon and a letter to a female confessee – could not hold a candle to the chaplain.44 That Ruusbroec’s writings outshone those of an academically trained Dominican was no doubt seen as proof that he was one of God’s elect, but we cannot attribute the grandeur of the Espousals to divine grace alone. Despite Pomerius’s assertion that Ruusbroec chose to study at the school of divine wisdom after gaining only ‘vanity and pride’ in formal education, the author of the Espousals must nevertheless have acquired a good deal more book-learning. An enthusiastic Latin master at the chapter school could have acquainted Ruusbroec with the fundamentals of theology, but his works betray a knowledge more profound than that normally acquired in the course of a cleric’s training.45 After his years at school, Ruusbroec must have continued to study theology, but this is all that can be said with certainty about this crucial formative phase in his writing career. The sources relating to his life give no indication whatsoever of further study or advanced education. Jan van Schoonhoven’s refutation of Gerson’s charges did not give the impression that Ruusbroec’s education had provided him with anything more than the knowledge needed by an ordained priest (sacerdos). Pomerius also leaves us in the dark on this score, though he does explain why we are so inadequately informed about the mystic’s intellectual background: it was simply not a subject worth pursuing. In Pomerius’s opinion, all acquired knowledge was of far less importance than ‘the dew of divine grace’ with which Ruusbroec had been liberally sprinkled while still struggling with the rudiments of grammar. His spirit rose effortlessly above ‘the common practice of logic’. This did not happen ‘through any acquired science or information obtained from people, but more by means of divine revelation, as may be seen in his books’ (niet met eniger vercregenre sciencien of bi informacien van enighen mensche, mer meer mids godliker revelacien, alsoet in sinen boeken is te merken).46\n\n44 On Hendrik of Leuven, see Axters 1947. Other examples of early Middle Dutch mystical prose are to be found in De Vooys 1921, Lievens 1960c, Reynaert 1978, Kwakkel & Mulder 2001, Scheepsma 2001 and Warnar 2002b. On the Dominicans in general, cf. Schiewer 2000a, pp. 874–85 and Largier 1995. See Marrone 2001 for an overview of the thirteenth-century theology of the knowledge of God. 45 Verdeyen 1981b, p. 126 (De Leu 1885, p. 272). 46 Verdeyen 1981b, p. 137 (De Leu 1885, p. 284). See Ampe 1975a, pp. 127–28, on Schoonhoven’s idea of Ruusbroec’s erudition.\n\n38\n\nchapter i\n\nPomerius would have done better to omit the last part of that sentence. On every page of Ruusbroec’s oeuvre we nd proof of his intense involvement with science and learning. It could hardly have been otherwise, since writing about the experience of God had become a scholarly affair in the fourteenth century. Franciscan theologians composed wide-ranging treatises on the forms of mystical unity and the proper way to gain an understanding of it. The Dominicans afliated with the studium generale of their order in Cologne showed off their knowledge in profound discussions of the supremacy of the intellect in unveiling the divine mystery. Written in the Low German of Cologne, their texts spread quickly and easily to the Dutch-speaking regions. Ruusbroec made a thorough study of these extremely philosophical theories of the divine as a concept beyond human understanding. Striving upward towards the Supreme Being, the human mind must stop thinking in terms of frameworks, concepts and categories, in order to attain a state of complete emptiness: . . . with respect to being lost in the darkness of the wilderness, nothing is left over, for there is no giving or taking there, only a simple, one-fold essence. In it, God and all those united with Him are sunken and lost, and they can never again nd themselves in this modeless essence, for it is a pure, simple one-foldness, and this is the highest blessedness in the realm of God.47\n\nThese are breathtakingly complex notions, expressed in a seemingly abstruse language which even in Ruusbroec’s day deviated markedly from generally comprehensible Dutch. Needless to say, this seriously hampers a modern translation. The above-quoted lines from the Realm were Ruusbroec’s rst attempt to describe the black hole of the Godhead. Over the years he dev"
