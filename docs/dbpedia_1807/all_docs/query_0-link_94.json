        "text": "Valerio Mezzanotti for The New York Times\n\nReady for some intellectualizing in Paris? Scorecard watched Louis Vuitton’s new men’s- wear studio director, the Botswana-raised British designer Kim Jones, get the positive ions flowing with his exuberant Masai checks-meets-bespoke tailoring exposition on multi-culti dressing Thursday. Meanwhile over at Alexis Mabille, the semiotic conclusion was that it wasn’t quite anchors away.\n\nLouis Vuitton\n\nDesigners: Marc Jacobs and Kim Jones\n\nDate and Location: Thursday, June 23, Serre du Parc André Citroën – rue de la Montagne de la Fage, 15e\n\nPhotos: slide show\n\n“A nautical touch.” (AFP)\n\n“For his debut collection at Vuitton, the new men’s style director Kim Jones delivered a globe-trotting collection of slick, jet-set staples electrified by African touches that looked like they’d been plucked out of a Kinshasa market.” (AP)\n\n“Above all, there was a sense throughout that Jones was in sync with Vuitton’s famed atelier, packing his runway with ideas and carefully shifting the brand’s men’s wear to a more nonchalant haute gamme artist chic.” (Fashion Wire Daily)\n\n“Jones has a good background, having previously been the creative director for Alfred Dunhill; a directorship that saw Dunhill reborn. It would appear that he’s done it again.” (Fashionising.com)\n\n“Pulls from a very Peter Beard-ian world, designing for that man who could be hanging in the south of France with the Stones one week and then with a Masai tribesman another. Either way, he’s dressed. ( GQ.com)\n\n“The brilliant British designer Kim Jones, in his first season as Mens’ Studio Director at Louis Vuitton, picked Peter Beard as his traveling partner. An excellent choice.” (Interview)\n\n“It is rare to see a designer step so perfectly into new shoes. But this debut collection could not be faulted. Its soul was the essence of Vuitton: travel.” (International Herald Tribune)\n\n“A solid debut.” (On The Runway)\n\n“The results were hugely handsome, confident and clear.” (SHOWstudio.com)\n\n“Kim Jones’s debut as men’s style director at Louis Vuitton today was a coup similar to the one achieved by Vuitton’s artistic director, Marc Jacobs, 14 years ago. A union that seemed unlikely on the surface turned out in actuality to be a relationship of remarkable, intimate compatibility.” (Style.com)\n\n“Wherever the Vuitton man is going next summer, we’ll be sure to follow.” (Vogue.com UK)\n\n“A handsome, sure-handed debut.” (WWD)\n\nAlexis Mabille\n\nDesigner: Alexis Mabille\n\nDate and Location: Thursday, June 23, Passage du Désir, 85/87 rue du faubourg Saint-Martin, 10e\n\nPhotos: slide show\n\n“Fashion shows are occasionally obscure in their reasoning and impenetrable in their semiotics, but give Alexis Mabille credit: The opening tableau of his spring show told you everything you needed to know. Four models in rolled white cargo pants, espadrilles, and printed tees stood side by side. The first’s top read ‘ALEXIS M’HABILLE’ (that’s ‘Alexis dresses me,’ the verb pronounced just like his surname). The second: ‘ALEXIS ME DESHABILLE’ (‘Alexis undresses me’). And with that, the models whipped off shirts and dropped trou. Voila: Mabille’s new underwear collection, created in collaboration with the skivvies label Hom.” (Style.com)\n\n“The lack of actual clothing felt like a shortage of inspiration rather than a design choice. And the result was that, with this collection, Mr. Mabille missed the boat.” (International Herald Tribune)\n\n“It was gimmicks ahoy as the French designer celebrated the life aquatic.” (WWD)\n\nAdam Kimmel\n\nDesigner: Adam Kimmel\n\nDate and Location: Thursday, June 23, Galerie de Minéralogie, Jardin des Plantes, 36 rue Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 5e\n\nPhotos: slide show\n\n“A surf-inspired rocker collection.” (GQ.com)\n\n“Adam Kimmel’s first runway show started with a splash.” (International Herald Tribune)\n\n“He opened with a film showing the view inside a huge wave, with a glimmer of blue sky at the end of the curl, and then sent out a mostly dark and pedestrian bunch of clothes.” (On The Runway)\n\n“If the plainness and functionality of his designs has always been a real strength, it scarcely rewarded scrutiny on a catwalk.” (Style.com)\n\n“The tattooed, weather-beaten men on the runway left no doubt these clothes are aimed at a no-frills guy.” (WWD)\n\nBalmain\n\nDesigner: Olivier Rousteing\n\nDate and Location: Thursday, June 23, 29 rue Marbeuf, 8e\n\nPhotos: slide show\n\n“The new man at the top is putting his own spirit into the summer season, bringing it from down-and-dirty into the sunlight.” (International Herald Tribune)\n\n“The house of Balmain is in new hands, but fans of Christophe Decarnin’s moto-roué look won’t be disappointed by the first collection from his former assistant Olivier Rousteing.” ( Style.com)\n\n“The new man at Balmain, Olivier Rousteing, continues to riff on the house’s signature rocker staples. … But in a nod to summer, there were shots of mint green, pale orange and lemon yellow fabrics that punctuated the blue denim and leather.” (WWD)\n\nChristian Lacroix\n\nDesigner: Sacha Walckhoff\n\nDate and Location: Wednesday, June 22, 2/4 place Saint-Sulpice, 6e\n\nPhotos: slide show\n\n“Felt like a chic squat party. On the outside, a simple sign hung stating ‘Lacroix: work in progress.'” (Fashionista)\n\n“Does not bring back the spirit of wild and wonderful embellishment that was once the identification of Maison Christian Lacroix.” (International Herald Tribune)\n\n“Touches of extravaganza, reminiscent of old-school Lacroix, poked through at times.” (Interview)\n\n“The clothes were wearable but devoid of a distinct vision.” (SHOWstudio.com)\n\n“Crystal and crucifix-embroidered denim vests looked a little out of place in this contemporary, tailoring-focused collection.” (WWD)\n\nDries Van Noten\n\nDesigner: Dries Van Noten\n\nDate and Location: Thursday, June 23, 165 rue de Vaugirard, 15e\n\nPhotos: slide show\n\n“A loose look.” (AFP)\n\n“Celebrated Belgian magpie van Noten dipped the bitter pill of femininity in a thick coating of sportswear to make it go down easier.” (AP)\n\n“A balanced, measured and deeply accessible collection that takes in everything from legging-tight pants to trim navy blue suits.” (GQ.com)\n\n“The bonding of formal and sporty and the literal fusion of seams for rainproofing was the story at Dries Van Noten.” (International Herald Tribune)\n\n“Van Noten’s collections always build on the Belgian’s affinity with fabric, and this season the play between synthetic and natural fabrics was a resounding success.” (SHOWstudio.com)\n\n“After a June that has left Europe’s fashion capitals sodden, Dries Van Noten’s spring-summer 2012 collection had him looking like a prophet.” (Style.com)\n\n“The energy of sports, and the technical nature of the gear, took Van Noten in a modern, function-driven direction for spring.” (WWD)\n\nIssey Miyake\n\nDesigner: Issey Miyake\n\nDate and Location: Thursday, June 23, 5 place des Vosges, 4e\n\nPhotos: slide show\n\n“Embraced blue in all its brightest shades for a range of breezy, relaxed looks.” (AFP)\n\n“The new team appeared to be following the same old recipes, delivering a debut collection that served up the casual high-tech aesthetic that has become the Miyake trademark.” (AP)\n\n“The studio group made a good job of playing with shades of blue and introducing a fresh, liquid pants shape.” (International Herald Tribune)\n\n“Worked with different shades of blue.” (WWD)\n\nJean Paul Gaultier\n\nDesigner: Jean Paul Gaultier\n\nDate and Location: Thursday, June 23, 325 rue Saint-Martin, 3e\n\nPhotos: slide show\n\n“True to his mischievous ways, Gaultier dared to mix such unlikely combinations as green plaid or Hawaiian colors with more classic pieces.” (AFP)\n\n“Although the result was a bit chaotic and lacking in ambience, the cheery Hawaiian theme of the collection helped improve the mood a good deal.” (All The Rage)\n\n“An inside-out show … where half naked male models stripping to their boxers distracted from the clothes themselves.” (AP)\n\n“One part St. Tropez and one part Southern California.” (GQ.com)\n\n“There was something utilitarian and practical about Jean Paul Gaultier ’s man, who in the past has challenged gender stereotypes.” (International Herald Tribune)\n\n“Stuff to wear. But he didn’t seem to have much fun.” (On The Runway)\n\n“The straightforwardness of Gaultier’s presentation and his clothes were modest but uncharacteristically exciting.” (SHOWstudio.com)\n\n“A quirky presentation that underlined his collection’s commercial appeal.” (WWD)\n\nMugler\n\nDesigners: Nicola Formichetti and Romain Kremer\n\nDate and Location: Wednesday, June 22, Galerie de Minéralogie, Jardin des Plantes, 36 rue Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 5e\n\nPhotos: slide show\n\n“A masculine show full of bare chests.” (AFP)\n\n“Referenced the Olympic theme that started appearing on the runways of Milan the previous week. Sort of.” (All The Rage)\n\n“Provocations aside … the show was grounded in reality — see the commercial viability of the new swim line. After all, in today’s fashion, it really does take an Olympian god to sell a pair of stretch lycra bikini briefs.” (Fashionista)\n\n“The Mugler otherworldly spirit resonated in silvered sportswear or bold fluorescent colors. … And yet, there was still a strong whiff of the top-selling Mugler fragrance business, suggesting that the show’s metallic accessories were more of an image concept than something to wear.” (International Herald Tribune)\n\n“Image and reality did battle at the new Mugler. … This Mugler outing, filled with the trappings of beach blanket Babylon, looked a bit like the photographer ran off the shoot with the clothes.” ( Interview)\n\n“Overall the assertively trashy collection was defined more by concept than by real clothes.” (SHOWstudio.com)\n\n“Despite all the trappings, though, the collection largely boils down to salable items. … Formichetti spoke of doing something ‘a little more real,’ but the danger is, without the theatrics, they may also look a little more ho-hum.” (Style.com)\n\n“Packed a raft of references — even gay porn.” (WWD)\n\nRick Owens\n\nDesigner: Rick Owens\n\nDate and Location: Thursday, June 23, POPB, salle Marcel Cerdan, porte 28, 8 boulevard de Bercy, 12e\n\nPhotos: slide show\n\n“For the thinking man in a hurry, Rick Owens sent out a rather scholarly collection in earthy hues dominated by ankle-length tunics and skirt.” (AFP)\n\n“Even if you don’t appreciate Rick Owens’s severe, austere, sunglass-wearing-monks-from-the-future aesthetic, you’d be hard-pressed not to recognize his design skills.” (All The Rage)\n\n“Owens continues to cater to the margins with a collection dominated by what’s possibly men’s wear’s hardest sell, the man skirt.” (AP)\n\n“What was new in Mr. Owens’s show was the idea that any particular clothing item should not have a particular gender assignment.” (Fashionista)\n\n“You might almost say that, yes, there’s a softer and warmer side to R.O. this season.” (GQ.com)\n\n“The way that the designer takes his signature monastic robes and knee-length tunics and refreshes them is a master class.” (International Herald Tribune)\n\n“Before you say ‘next,’ please note the overall impression was sensual, alluring and hyper-masculine.” (Interview)\n\n“Rick Owens was back to the dungeon at Bercy, the concert space, and more determined than ever to keep his male customers in long skirts and Jesus robes.” (On The Runway)\n\n“Owens delivered a new, almost softer, approach to his apocalyptic wardrobe.” (SHOWstudio.com)\n\n“It’s hard not to look at his collections and see someone who is obsessively steering his craft in such a unique and deeply personal direction that it amounts to a spiritual quest. The lean, clean lines of his new collection read like road maps.” (Style.com)\n\n“Retaining the label’s esoteric codes, they were bang on trend.” (WWD)\n\nViktor & Rolf Monsieur\n\nDesigners: Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren\n\nDate and Location: Thursday, June 23, Monnaie de Paris – 11 quai de Conti, 6e\n\nPhotos: slide show\n\n“A James Bond-ish gleaming blue tux — matched with a blue bow tie and, horror of horrors, sandals and socks — set the tone for a range that also included a whale-emblazoned sweatshirt.” (AFP)\n\n“No one needed face-time with Flipper to get that the Danish design duo of Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren were relaxing on the inner beaches of their consciousness.” (All The Rage)\n\n“Call this a return to color. … As always, it’s back to the future for the unpredictable pair.” (GQ.com)\n\n“[A] well-thought-out collection … showing a strengthening Viktor & Rolf’s masculine side.” (International Herald Tribune)\n\n“Timeless menswear kitsch … guaranteed to make you look like your father or grandfather back in the day.” (Interview)\n\n“The Dutch duo refer to their target man as a ‘sexy intellect,’ so no wonder they picked the intellectual of the ocean as their totem.” (Style.com)\n\n“Women’s wear has been lounging around in the ’70s for some while now — a decade that proved to be quite the hit for Viktor & Rolf.” (Vogue.com UK)\n\n“Seventies leisure wear was given a chic update courtesy of Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren.” (WWD)\n\nYohji Yamamoto\n\nDesigner:Yohji Yamamoto\n\nDate and Location: Thursday, June 23, 155 rue Saint-Martin, 3e\n\nPhotos: slide show\n\n“Favored fluid wide trousers and relaxed jackets.” (AFP)\n\n“If the body was lost inside the layers, the overall effect was striking in its width and breadth.” (International Herald Tribune)\n\n“Inherently Yamamoto.” (SHOWstudio.com)\n\n“His play with large volumes called to mind both traditional ethnic garb and street wear, reminding you how much the expressive bagginess favored by the new generation of street-style blog courters owes to the designer (even if, alas, they don’t all know they’re quoting him).” (Style.com)\n\n“Yamamoto brought voluminous men’s bottoms to another level.” (WWD)"
