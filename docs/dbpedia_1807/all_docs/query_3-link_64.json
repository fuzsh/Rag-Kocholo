        "text": "Description:Rises in Boeuf Township, Gasconade County, and flows east into the adjoining Boeuf Township, Franklin County, emptying into the Missouri River just west of Newhaven. This is one of the oldest French names in the county. It appears on the newly discovered Evans (or Mackay) Map of 1795 or 1796, as \"R. Berger,\" with the English translation just below of \"Shepherd's River.\" The Perrin du Lac Map of 1802 enters it again as \"R. Berger,\" and Pike's Map of about 1806 has it as \"Shepherd River.\" When the Lewis and Clark Expedition passed its mouth on May 26, 1804, Clark called it in his journal (I.29) \"Shepperds Creek;\" and he lists it again in his \"Summary Statement of Rivers and Creeks\" (VI. 56) as \"Shepherds Creek,\" noting that it comes from the southwest and enters the Missouri just eighty-three miles above its mouth. When Prince Maximilian passed the stream on May 25, 1834, he writes the name as \"River a Berger.\" Berger Creek is the form subsequently used, although it is also known as Big Berger Creek, to distinguish it from a much smaller tributary called Little Berger Creek (q.v.). The early use of the translated form Shepherd or Shepherd's Creek would seem to indicate that it was understood as the French common noun \"berger,\" shepherd. It is much more likely, however, to have been originally a personal name. Houck, in his SPANISH REGIME IN MISSOURI (II.196), conjectures that it was named either for the French hunter Joseph Berger or for Pierre Berger, who was a merchant of St. Louis and died there in 1787. In another place (II.188), Houck prints the roster of St. Louis militia companies in 1780, in which Joseph Berger's name appears as \"Joseph Berge,\" forty-eight years old, born in Canada, a hunter. This conjecture, which is accepted by Kiel, seems altogether plausible. Another view, however, is taken by the editor of Pike's Expedition, Elliott Coues. In a footnote to Pike's name Shepherd River (II. 365), Coues says: \"I am told by R.J. Holcombe that the word is not the French \"berger\" but a personal name, probably of the old German pioneer Casper Burger, a founder of the colony there.\" Eaton follows Coues, only altering the spelling of the German \"founder of a colony\" to Casper Berger. Holcombe's guess, for it can be nothing more, must surely be rejected. If there ever was a German pioneer named Casper Burger--and no trace of him has been discovered in any other authority--he could hardly have come to Missouri early enough to give his name to a stream already known as \"River Berger\" by 1795. The way the name is used by Perrin du Lac, Evans, Clark, and Pike show that it was understood from the beginning as French, not German, long before there could have been much, if any, German immigration. Furthermore, the still prevailing pronunciation of the name with a soft \"g\" is rather convincing demonstration that it was originally of French, not German, derivation. (Evans, or Mackay, Map; Perrin du Lac; L&C, and EWT, ed. Thwaites, & Pike, ed. Coues, pp. cited; COUNTY ATLAS 1878, 59; HIST. FRANKLIN, 204-5; Houck, SPANISH REGIME II 188, 196; Eaton, 167; Kiel's BIOG. DIR., 198; Miss Johnson; S.A. Hall; Mr. Weber's thesis, under \"Big Berger Creek\")Description:The present name of a stream formerly known as Tavern Creek, or Tavern Rock Creek. It rises in St. Louis County, near its western border (see Miss Welty's thesis), and flows northwest into Franklin County, passing through the northeast corner of Boles Township, and emptying into the Missouri River about one mile above the famous Tavern Rock Cave (q.v.), from which it takes its name. Just at its mouth it is joined by the smaller stream called Little Tavern Creek (q.v.), from which it is distinguished by the present name. A self-contradictory and certainly mistaken statement in Wetmore's GAZETTEER of 1847 places Tavern Creek on the north or St. Charles side of the Missouri River. Wetmore says (p. 259): \"Tavern Creek, a small stream of St. Charles County, falls into the Missouri three miles above the mouth of Femme Osage. A mile below this is a large cave on the right bank of the Missouri, at the foot of cliffs almost perpendicular. The cave is about 100 ft. in length...\" This cave is, of course, the well known Tavern Rock Cave (q.v.), and Wetmore places it correctly on the right, i.e. the south bank. It must have been a momentary lapse of memory that made him put Tavern Creek on the St. Charles or left side; for surely the creek must be located on the same side of the river as the cave. Wetmore's mistake is followed by Stevens. Possibly it arose from a misreading of old maps; on the Evans (or Mackay?) Map of 1795, for example, the words \"Taverne, a cave\" appear written on the north side of the river, about halfway between the names of the Femme Osage and the River Charrette, but almost certainly the old map meant to locate the cave itself on the south side; it was merely a matter of finding a convenient place to write the name. The final proof that there has never been either a creek or a cave on the north side is afforded by the topography, relatively unchanging, of the eight-mile stretch of the Missouri River from the mouth of the Femme Osage on the north to Tavern Rock Cave on the south. This stretch of river is described by Coues as follows (in a note to his edition of the Pike Exp., p. 362): \"the Femme Osage River falls into the lower end of Dozier's bend. The Missouri is here one and a half to two miles broad, and mostly filled with Howell's isl., two and a half miles long, some small islands, and various sandbars. Thence on the north or rather northwest is a bottom eight miles long and a mile or more deep; while on the southeast is a nearly unbroken line of bluffs which the river washes from Port Royal (in Franklin County, just over the border of St. Louis County) to St. Albans. At one place in these rocks is the cave formerly, and perhaps still, known as the Tavern: see Lewis and Clark, and Pike's map, place lettered \"Cave.\" The small stream which makes in on the southeast at St. Albans is still called Tavern Creek.\" The contrast here depicted between the low northern bank forming a mile-wide and eight-mile-long bottom, and the precipitous southern bank, with bluffs three hundred feet high, must always have existed, and fixes the position of both Tavern Creek and Tavern Cave where all modern histories place them, on the south or Franklin County side. (Evans, or Mackay, Map; Pike Map, & note in Coue's ed. of the Pike Exp., 362; Wetmore, 259; Stevens II, 781; COUNTY ATLAS 1878, 23; HIST. FRANKLIN, 205; Kiel's BIOG. DIR., 195; Miss Johnson: Charles Becker)Description:Rises in the west central part of Boles Township, and flows north and northeast into the Missouri River. All authorities agree that it was named for Sylvestre Labaddie (or L'Abaddie), a prominent merchant of early French St. Louis. They have failed to notice, however, that there were two men of this name, father and son, and most of them ascribe the Franklin County names to the father, whereas they are much more likely to have been named for the son. The known facts about the life of Sylvestre Labaddie, Sr. are summarized in Billion's ANNALS OF ST. LOUIS IN ITS EARLY DAYS UNDER THE FRENCH & SPANISH DOMINATIONS, 1886. He was born in Tarbes, Bearne, France. His name first appears in the archives of St. Louis in 1769. In 1773 he was associated in business with J.M. Papin. On July 27, 1776, he was married to Pelagie, second daughter of Mrs. Marie Therese Bourgeois Chouteau, of the well known Chouteau family. After a successful business career of some twenty years, he died on June 19, 1794, leaving five children, one boy and four girls. Sylvestre Labaddie, Jr., was an even more important and successful man than his father. His life, as gathered from many references in Billion's ANNALS and from the biographical sketch by W.B. Douglas in his edition of Thomas James's THREE YEARS AMONG THE INDIANS, 1916, pp. 261-3, may be summarized as follows: He was born in St. Louis on February 19, 1779, and was fifteen years old when his father died. In the year 1800 he petitioned Governor de Lassus for a grant of land in what is now Franklin County. The grant was made, covering fourteen thousand acres of land on the south shore of the Missouri River; and what is still more remarkable, his title was afterwards confirmed to him by the United States. The tradition is, that, once when he was returning from a trading expedition, his further progress was prevented by ice forming on the river, and that he camped for the winter on the site of his subsequent grant. The present town of Labaddie (q.v.) is situated upon this land, as is also Point Labaddie, now Gray's Summit (q.v.). In the year 1809 he entered into partnership with General William Clark and Manuel Lisa to form the American Fur Company, later so famous in western history. He died in his seventieth year, on July 25, 1849, at his home in St. Louis on Olive Street between Fifth and Sixth Streets. For the apocryphal legend according to which one of the Labaddies lost his life in a struggle with a wounded bear in a Franklin County cave, see Labaddie's Cave, below. (Billon, ANNALS, 260, ST. LOUIS IN ITS TERRITORIAL DAYS, 33, 179; Thomas James, THREE YEARS AMONG THE INDIANS, ed. W.B. Douglas 261-3; HIST. FRANKLIN, 205; COUNTY ATLAS 1878, 13; Eaton)Description:This \"large, crooked, and beautiful stream,\" as it has been called, is the most important river in Franklin County, and is also one of the oldest names in the region. It rises in the northeast part of Crawford County, enters Franklin near the center of the southern border of Meramec Township, and flows in a generally northeast direction across the county, continuing as the boundary line between St. Louis and Jefferson Counties till it empties into the Mississippi River. The name is usually interpreted as an Indian word meaning \"catfish,\" and this etymology is supported by Hodge and Gannett. Mr. Bert Lowenstein, however, writing in the St. Louis POST-DISPATCH for September 10, 1938, disagrees, and gives by far the best and most detailed history of the name Meramec. He writes that Joliet and Marquette were probably the first Europeans to pass the mouth of the Meramec; for although they make no mention of the river in their account of the voyage down the Mississippi River to the mouth of the Arkansas River, Father Marquette notes the location of the \"Maroa\" tribe in the country of the Illinois. The Recollect missionary, Father Membre, who accompanied the La Salle and De Tonty expedition, writes of \"the village of the Tamaroas on the east bank, about six leagues below the River of the Osages.\" La Salle, De Tonty, Fathers Joutel, Marest, Pinet, and other missionaries mention the \"Tamaroas\" or \"Maroas\" and their villages, which they locate \"ten leagues below the River of Illinois,\" or six miles below the mouth of the Pekitanoui,\" the river of the \"Missouries.\" The first historical notice of the river is found in the account of a voyage by Father James Gravier in the year 1700. He wrote: \"We discovered the river Mearamigoua where a rich lead mine is situated.\" Penicaut, a member of Le Seur's mineralogical expedition mentions it in 1700, \"one finds a small stream called the Meramecsipy.\" In 1702 De Iberville applied to the French Government for the exclusive privilege to work the lead mines on the Riviere Maramecquisipi. The Sieur La Renaudiere explored the region in 1723 and wrote an \"Account of the mines of M. de la Motte and M. de Maramet.\" In May, 1723, Dixon D' Artaguiette wrote, \"About one o'clock M. Renault, director of the mines, arrived here from the Meramec Mines.\" On June 14, 1723, Pierre Duque de Boisbriant and Marc Antoine de La Laire des Ursin, Intendant, granted to Renault a league and a half of ground upon the \"Little Merameig\" and in the \"river Mearmeig.\" The \"Maroa,\" the Indian tribe whose villages were nearest to the river's mouth, seems to be the origin of the word according to Mr. Lowenstein. The second syllable \"mec,\" \"mac,\" \"meg,\" or \"meq\" is a term common among the Algonquin tribes. It apparently signifies a branch river or small stream as opposed to \"missi,\" \"mitche\" meaning great. The name also appears as Merramec River. The many spellings would naturally result from the difficulty of settlers with the original name. (Wetmore; Gannett, 205; Houck, HIST. MISSOURI I, 281; COM. ATLAS, 229; John E. Rothensteines, MHR XX, 200, EARLIEST HISTORY OF MINE LA MOTTE\"; Bert Lowenstein, St. Louis POST DISPATCH, Sept. 10, 1938; Miss O'Brien's thesis; Miss Welty's thesis)Description:This great railroad runs from St. Louis to Omaha, Nebraska via Kansas City, and also to Texarkana, Arkansas, Lake Charles, Louisiana, and Johnson City, Illinois. It enters Franklin County from St. Louis County at Pacific (q.v.) and there diverges from the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad (q.v.) to follow the Missouri River along the northern border of the county. This part of the Missouri Pacific is called the Washington Branch, for Washington, its largest station in the county. The railroad was originally chartered as the Pacific Railroad on March 12, 1849, to construct a road from St. Louis to Jefferson City and then westward to Van Buren (now Cass) County, Missouri. It was so named because its promoters ambitiously hoped to reach the Pacific Ocean. Construction on the road commenced at St. Louis on July 4, 1850, and work went well for a time due largely, no doubt, to the fact that the State Legislature granted two million dollars worth of bonds to the company in 1851. The railroad was opened to Franklin, now called Pacific, on July 19, 1853; to Washington on July 11, 1855; and to Hermann, just across the line in Gasconade County, on August 6, 1855. The first division of the railroad from St. Louis to Pacific cost about $47,000 a mile, or approximately twice the estimated amount. By the autumn of 1855 the railroad was almost completed to Jefferson City. On November 1, 1855 it experienced one of the greatest tragedies in the state when an excursion train bound for Jefferson City, loaded with several hundred of the most distinguished citizens of the state, was thrown into the Gasconade River. Thirty-one of the passengers were killed, including the chief engineer, Thomas O'Sullivan. By 1861, the railroad was completed to Sedalia, but operations were suspended for two years, probably on account of the Civil War. By 1865 the road reached Kansas City. The Pacific Railroad from St. Louis to Kansas City was sold under the Act of March 31, 1868 to the Pacific Railroad Company, and thus were evolved the main lines of the present St. Louis-San Francisco and the Missouri Pacific Railroads. The Pacific Railroad was incorporated in 1876 as the Missouri Pacific and was so named for the state it traversed and its intended destination. It has now absorbed several lines, one of which runs southwest through Franklin County and which was known as the Southwest Branch Railroad (q.v.) about the time of the Civil War. The Missouri Pacific Railroad owns about 6,598 miles of first line track. About June 1, 1917, it took over the properties of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway. (COUNTY ATLAS 1878, 13; HIST. FRANKLIN, 294; MHR, Oct. 1920, 145-153; Schultz, 109-11; R. & I. COMPENDIUM, May 29, 1941, 129; Washington Library Records; Miss Welty's thesis)Description:A small village or settlement once located somewhere on St. Johns Creek. According to Kiel, when a post office was established there on August 30, 1833, it was on the upper part of the creek, in what is now the northeast part of Lyon Township. The post office was discontinued on July 29, 1840, and the place has so entirely disappeared that its exact location is uncertain. The earlier St. Johns Settlement, from which the village was doubtless descended, was probably nearer the mouth of the creek, a short distance west of the present Washington. It seems always to have been a scattered country community, and never became a place of any importance. Its insignificance probably accounts for the apparent mistake made on May 25, 1804, by the companies of Lewis and Clark in transferring the name to the village of La Charrette across the river in Warren County. The mistake is not made by Clark himself, or by Lewis, both of whom knew it as La Charrette or Charrette's village; but in the four other journals that are preserved, kept by subordinate members of the party, the place is called St. Johns. The four sergeants Floyd (Thwaites' ed., VII. 5), Whitehouse (Thwaites' ed., VII. 25), Gass (1847 ed., p. 15), and Ordway (Quaife's ed., p. 81) record the events of May 25 in almost identical words: After telling how they spent the night of May 23 encamped near Tavern Creek (q.v.) on the south side of the river, then occupied the whole day of May 24 in a difficult struggle with the rapid known as the Devil's Race-Ground, winning only ten miles during the day, and again encamping on the south side, they started out on the morning of Friday, May 25, and after passing the mouth of \"a creek called Wood River\" (i.e., on the north side) called St. Johns. This is the last settlement of whites on this River.\" The editors Coues, Thwaites, and Quaife accept these entries of the worthy sergeants as evidence that the Warren County village of La Charrette had previously borne the name of St. Johns, although they note that no other records survive of the use of the name on the north side of the river, whereas it was indubitably applied to a creek, an island, a village, and a township on the southern side. It may be observed that the almost identical wording of the four journals suggests that three of the entries were copied from the fourth, as we know was often the case among the Lewis and Clark diarists; hence we really have only a single witness to the name St. Johns for La Charrette, as against that of the two leaders Clark and Lewis. It is at least possible that these men, who had just passed close to the mouth of St. Johns Creek and perhaps also the St. Johns settlement on the south side, and near the St. Johns Islands (q.v.) as they crossed over, merely transferred the name to La Charette by pure inadvertence. Closely tied up with the question of whether the village of St. Johns was on the south or the north side of the river is that of the location of what must have been its predecessor, the Spanish \"Fort San Juan del Misuri.\" Our information about the Spanish fort comes from Houck, who bases it apparently on a document from the Spanish archives which he unfortunately fails to quote in full. \"Of this fort one Antonio Gautier, lieutenant of the militia, and who in 1796 was an inhabitant of St. Charles, had command. What manner of fort this San Juan del Misuri was, we do not know, nor whether the garrison was a squad of Spanish soldiers or composed of local militia; but most likely this fort was a small log-house built to protect the first settlers against the Indians\" (Houck, HIST. MISSOURI, II, 91). In his SPANISH REGIME IN MISSOURI, Houck gives a little more information about the officer who was in command of the fort: he gives us the roster of St. Louis militia companies in 1780, and in the list appears (p. 184) the name \"Antonio Gotie, twenty-six years old, born in Canada, rower.\" To this Houck adds a footnote (p. 190): \"Antoine Gauthier married Elizabeth Becquet, widow of St. Joseph Chancelier. He moved to St. Charles, where he was an officer in the militia and in command of the Fort San Juan del Misuri above St. Charles, presumably where the village of Charette afterwards stood.\" Another document reproduced by Houck (p. 30) is a commission, dated July 9, 1793, to Don Antonio Gautier as Lieutenant in the militia at San Carlos del Misouri, granted by Baron de Carondelet.\" As for the location of his \"Fort San Juan del Misuri\" which is obviously not exactly given in the documents before him, Houck accepts La Charrette on the north side of the river. His only ground for doing so is the fact that Gass names the settlement \"St. Johns\" in his journal, although he notes with surprise that \"All rememberance of Fort San Juan del Misuri in 1804 appears to have faded from the recollection of the people there\" (HIST. MISSOURI II, 91). It would indeed have been strange if a fort in full operation in 1796 were already completely forgotton in 1804, and on the face of the facts we have it seems far more likely that the fort was south of the river, where it has left so large a crop of descendants. One other possibility may be suggested. Houck gives in his Spanish Regime in Missouri an account, taken from the Spanish archives, of a double fort erected by the Spanish at the mouth of the Missouri River on March 10, 1769: \"the royal Spanish fort, Don Carlos el Senor Principe de Asturias, and of the blockhouse Don Carlos Tercero el Rey, both of which are located at the mouth of the Misuri--the first on the south bank, and the latter on the north bank.\" (p. 49). Might not the later \"Fort San Juan del Misuri\" have been a similar double fort or pair of blockhouses, one south of the Missouri at the mouth of the \"Riviere St. Jean,\" and the other on the north side, somewhere near La Charrette? This would account for all the facts we have, and vindicate the sergeants from the imputation of error. A definitive solution of the whole problem must await the fuller publication of material from the Spanish archives. In any event, all the St. John names, on both sides of the river, must have been derived from the Fort. The name San Juan was doubtless chosen by the Spaniards in the same spirit as inspired the choice of San Carlos and San Fernando (q.v.): i.e., directly in honor of well known saints of the church, indirectly in honor of royal personages who also bore those names. Thus San Juan would be primarily named for the Apostle, secondarily for one of the many Johns in the royal lines of Spain or Portugal. The most likely candidate for such honor at this time was Don Juan of Austria (1547-1578), the famous Spanish general and victor at Lepanto, illegitimate son of the emperor Charles V. (L&C, & Pike, ed. Coues; L&C, & EWT, ed Thwaites; Gass's JOURNAL, 1847 ed.; Ordway's JOURNAL, ed. Quaife; Houck's HIST. MISSOURI & SPANISH REGIME; all with pp. as cited above; HIST. FRANKLIN, 217; Kiel's BIOG. DIR., 210; Miss Johnson: George Klenke)Description:A large cave at the base of Tavern Rock (q.v.) opening on the Missouri River. So named because it was a famous stopping place for the French and later boatmen and voyageurs ascending the river or returning home. Before the white man came it seems to have been considered a sacred spot or shrine of some sort by the Indians. It attracted the particular attention of all the men on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which halted there on May 23, 1904. Clark's account of it as follows: \"Wednesday, May 23. We passed a large Cave on the Lbd Side Called by the french the Tavern--about 120 feet wide 40 feet Deep and 20 feet high--many different immages are Painted on the Rock at this place the Inds. & French pay omage Many names are wrote on the rock. Stoped about one mile above for Capt. Lewis who had assended the Clifts which is at the Said Cave 300 feet high--hamging over the waters... Capt Lewis near falling from the Pinecles of rocks 300 feet, he caught at 20 foot\" (Thwaites I, 27) Elsewhere (Thwaites VI., 56) Captain Clark states that the \"Cave Called the Tavern\" is exactly forty-seven miles up the Missouri River from its mouth. Much the same description appears in the journals kept by Sergeant Whitehouse (Thwaites VII., 31) and Sergeant Floyd (Thwaites VII., 5), who adds that after leaving the Tavern they proceeded \"one mile to a Creek Called Tavern creek and encamped on the South Side.\" Sergeant Gass, in his journal published separately, calls it the \"Tavern Cove-- a noted place among the French traders. One mile above this is the Tavern Creek\" (p. 14). A later traveler, John Bradbury, passed the place on March 16, 1811, and writes as follows in his TRAVELS (ed. by Thwaites, EWT V., 41): \"We this day passed the Tavern Rocks, so called from a large cave therein, level with the surface of the river. These rocks are nearly three hundred feet high.\" To this Thwaites adds the footnote: \"This cave is noted by all early travelers. The French traders had scrawled names upon its walls, and painted images thereupon, which the Indians regarded with superstitious awe. It appears to have taken its name from being a well-known lodging or camping place.\" Similar accounts are given by H.M. Brackenridge, 1811, and Edmund Flagg, 1838, as well as practically every other traveler up the Missouri. One of the later accounts is of special interest as possibly preserving the earlier French name for Tavern Rock Cave. The German traveler, Prince Maximilian Wied, who went up the river in 1832, writes as follows: \"We reached Isle au Bon Homme, in the vicinity of which we passed the night. On the twelfth of April, the original forms of the calcareous rocks again appeared...A cavern at this place is called the Tavern Rock (Taverne de Montardis)...The walls of this cave contain many inscriptions of names and rude pictures of birds and beasts, the latter of which are the works of the red man.\" (EWT, XXII., 239). Light on the meaning of the name \"Taverne de Montardis\" is thrown by documents quoted in Houck's SPANISH REGIME IN MISSOURI. On p. 183 of vol. I, Don Pedro Montardy is listed as Sub-Lieutenant in the roster of St. Louis militia companies in the year 1780, and Houck gives the following note about him: Pierre or Pedro Montardy, a native of Montauban, France. In 1765 he married Marie Theresa Duchemin at St. Anne de Chartres...He was a merchant, and the lot he owned in St. Louis was subsequently acquired by Auguste Chouteau. There is no records as to where and when he died.\" Don Pierre Montardy is mentioned again on October 29, 1780 (see Houck I., 241) as an officer in orders signed by Lieutenant Governor Don Francisco Cruzat. The way in which the name of this Frenchman in the Spanish service might have become attached to a \"tavern\" in a river-side cave is parallelled by the case of Montbrun's Tavern in what is now Callaway County, a cave in the bluffs near the mouth of Big Tavern Creek. This is also a very old place name, on the Evans (or Mackay?) Map of 1795, and mentioned by Lewis and Clark, as well as by Gass, who spells it \"Mombran's Tavern.\" There can be no doubt that this cave-tavern was the property of another French officer, mentioned in Houck's SPANISH REGIME, I., 198, as Don Esteban Boucher de Mombrun, who is specially commended in a letter to Governor Cruzat for his help in winning the friendhsip of the Sac tribe. For a similar cave on the Osage River, at the mouth of another Big Tavern Creek in Miller County, see the note in Mr. Weber's thesis: \"In each case the cave at the mouth of the creek was known in early days as The Tavern because travelers on the river often spent the night in them in bad weather.\" Our Franklin County cavern appears on Pike's map, marked simply, \"A cave,\" and also on the Evans (or Mackay?) Map of 1795, marked \"Taverns--a cave.\" For the mistaken notion that there was a Tavern Cave near this point on the north or St. Charles side of the river, see the discussion under Big Tavern Creek.
