        "text": "Originally posted by ERault\n\nSeveral times I came across dutch driver Hans Tak name, always with interesting machinery, but without learning any precision or background details. Maybe someone can shed some light on him and his cars ? Here is what I got so far :\n\nFirst appearance I have for him is the 1955 Coppa delle Dolomiti, with a 300 SL. He used the Benz again, for exemple for the 1956 Giro delle Calabria. In the meantime, he shared a 150 S Maserati, entered by Beels Racing, with van Zalinge at the 1956 Nurburgring 1000 km. Apparently, the same Maser was raced at the sportscar event preceding the 1956 German GP.\n\nOriginally posted by ERault\n\nFerrari 250 Monza were very few (3 if I remember correctly), so this one might be \"trackable\".

That would for sure fill a gap !\n\nOriginally posted by Tomas Karlsson\n\nOf course, it was May 11th 1956.\n\nBeels drove in the Special-sport class under 2 litre.\n\n21 Eric Brandon GB Halseylec-Climax\n\n22 Robert Nelleman DK Cooper-Climax\n\n23 André Loëns F Maserati A6GCS\n\n24 Petter von Tangen N Veritas\n\n25 Nikolai Kozarowitsky FIN Lotus 11 LM\n\n26 Heikki Sorri FIN BMW\n\n27 Lex Beels NL Maserati 150S\n\n28 Arthur Owen GB Cooper-Climax\n\nThe class started behind the class over 2 litres. Kozarowitsky, von Tangen and Sorri did not start. Beels started last and retired after only three laps. Nelleman retired after 14 laps.\n\nResults: 1 Brandon, 2 Owen, 3 Loens.\n\nAccording to a Finnish newspaper in 1956: \" Beels is going to drive his new 150S, directly arrived from Modena.\"\n\nOriginally posted by Tomas Karlsson\n\nI don't agree. Bonnier's Maserati was painted black and yellow at Oulton Park in April and had the same livery at the Supercortemaggiore in June, while Beels had a red car.\n\nAnd Bonnier's car didn't get the new body (and 2-litre engine) until after the season. He raced it in the old configuration both at Pescara in August and in Rome in October.\n\nDon`t agree with your last points. Definitely he did NOT race it in Rome and Pescara in the old livery (I have photos from the LAT-archive confirming! From the Pescara race I have a photo that shows that Maserati did some experiments with the rear end as it is a little \"Kamm-tail\")! In Rome the car was painted in red livery (Source: ACTUALPHOTO) and in the new configuration but now with the standart round rear end of the 200S`s!\n\nOriginally posted by Tomas Karlsson\n\nNo he did not race in the old livery at Pescara and Rome. the car was repainted in blue and yellow after Monza. I don't know about the rear of the car in Pescara, but the front hasn't changed in my picture.\n\nWhat race number did he have at Rome? I have a picture from the Rome 1500cc-grid with Bonnier in his blue and yellow 150S with race number 60.\n\nHe participated in the 2-litre race too, with a Centro-Sud Maserati (yet unknown to me).\n\nHe didn't race his own car at Imola, where he borrowed a factory car . Are you sure it was red? According to himself the factory repainted it and on the picture I have, the bonnet seems to in a lighter colour.\n\nI have pictures of his black and yellow (or gold) car in England and at Monza.\n\nBonnier was a privat entrant in 1956, with a Swedish mechanic and his own home-built transporter. But during the season he was recognized by the factory and got a contract for -57.\n\nTomas,\n\nOriginally posted by terry mcgrath\n\ndutch jaguars\n\nI would certainly love to find out more about jaguars racing in holland particularly the 2 mentioned below and also any alloy XK120's and also anything about jaguar SS100's of which a couple ran there prewar.\n\nHolland has always had strong SS and jaguar connections to the extent they printed a dutch language SS sales brochure by about 1931/32 probably the only foreign language brochure done prewar\n\nterry mcgrath\n\nwww.paulskilleter.com\n\nHans Davids (the very same who raced a C Type Jag in the Spa 1954 thread) had a DB3S Aston, a young Slotemaker had a C Type (apparently not Davids'one), de Beaufort and Mathieu Hezemans (Toine's father I assume) had Porsche Spyders...\n\nOriginally posted by Arjan de Roos\n\nThis is what I have on Hans Tak:\n\nMay 22nd 1955: Circuit de Dieppe in a Mercedes 300SL. 2nd in the second qualifying heat.\n\nMay 29th, 1955 Zandvoort, winner on Ferrari\n\nCoppa d'Oro delle Dolomiti on the 10th of july 1955. 8th overall and third in class (over 2 liters) with the Mercedes 300SL. Overall and 2+ class was won by Olivier Gendebien. Also in top 8 were Eugenio Castalloti and Umberto Maglioli!\n\nLisbon Grand Prix on the Monsanto track. July 24th with a Ferrari 3 liters (750 Monza?, this a 3.0 litre 4 in line). Will have a look in more Ferrari literature soon.\n\n10th with 2 laps behind winner Masten Gregory (USA) in a Ferrari 750 Monza.\n\nAugust 7th wins at Zandvoort in a Ferrari again.\n\nA year later he participates in the 1000 km of the Nürburgring. With Henk van Zalinge in a Maserati 150S entered by Lex Beels (Beels Racing). Disqualified on outside assistance.\n\nAlso in 1956 Nationale races Zandvoort another win on the Mercedes 300SL.\n\nOn to 1960 : 9th in the Geneva Rally with Rob Gorris and 5th in the Monte Carlo Rally with Swaab (Mercedes 220SE)."
