        "text": "Andre \"Dries\" van der Lof (born 23 August 1919 and died 24 May 1990) was a Dutch businessman and racing driver who participated in the 1952 Dutch Grand Prix. Together with Jan Flinterman, he was the first Dutch driver to race in a Formula One championship race.\n\nPrior to racing in Formula One, he raced in rallies and some other national events in the Netherlands. Van der Lof owned a factory that manufactured electrical cables.\n\nThe 1952 Dutch Grand Prix was the first Dutch event to be included as part of the Formula One championship. To drum up local excitement, the event organizers funded van der Lof's seat on HW Motors. He completed 70 of the 90 laps in the race, but was not classified in the race results because he failed to complete 90% of the race distance.\n\nLater in his motor racing career, he purchased a Maserati 250F, which he used to compete in historic races until the 1980s.\n\nFormula One Statistical Overview[]\n\nFormula One Record[]\n\nYear Entrant Team WDC Points WDC Pos. 1952 Hersham and Walton Motors HWM-Alta 0 NC\n\nCareer Statistics[]\n\nEntries 1 Starts 1 Pole Positions 0 Race Wins 0 Podiums 0 Fastest Laps 0 Points 0 Laps Raced 70 Distance Raced 294 km (183 mi)\n\nCareer Results[]\n\nComplete Formula One Results Year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Pts Pos 1952 0 NC NC\n\nKey Symbol Meaning Symbol Meaning 1st Winner Ret Retired 2nd Podium finish DSQ Disqualified 3rd DNQ Did not qualify 5th Points finish DNPQ Did not pre-qualify 14th Non-points finish TD Test driver Italics Fastest Lap DNS Did not start 18thâ€  Classified finish (retired with >90% race distance) NC Non-classified finish (<90% race distance) 4thP Qualified for pole position [+] More Symbols\n\nNotes[]"
