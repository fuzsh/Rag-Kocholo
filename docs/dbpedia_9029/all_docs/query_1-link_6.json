The book has been published in many other languages and adapted into different media. The first American edition was published in 1922 by Thomas Seltzer. The latter's wife Adele Szold-Seltzer (1876-1940), the daughter of Benjamin Szold and younger sister of Henrietta Szold, was the translator.[8]\n\nThe stories revolve around a little bee named Maya and her friends Willy the bee, Flip the grasshopper (referred to as \"Maja\", \"Willi\" and \"Philip\" respectively in some versions), Mrs. Cassandra (Maya's teacher), and many other insects and other creatures, and from the clutches pursed by the evil Rib-It frog. The book depicts Maya's development from an adventurous youngster to a responsible adult member of bee society.\n\nPlot[]\n\nBonsels' original book contains fewer than 200 pages. The storyline is centered on the relation of Maya and her many adventures.\n\nMaya is a bee born in a bee hive during internal unrest: the hive is dividing itself into two new colonies. Maya is raised by her teacher, Mrs. Cassandra. Despite Mrs. Cassandra's warnings, Maya wants to explore the wide world and commits the unforgivable crime of leaving the hive. During her adventures, Maya, now in exile, befriends other insects and braves dangers with them. In the climax of the book, Maya is taken prisoner by hornets, the bees' sworn enemies.\n\nPrisoner of the hornets, Maya learns of a hornet plan to attack her native hive. Maya is faced with the decision to either return to hive and suffer her due punishment, saving the hive, or leaving the plan unannounced, saving herself but destroying the hive. After severe pondering, she makes the decision to return. In the hive, she announces the coming attack and is, totally unexpectedly, pardoned. The forewarned bees triumph over the hornet attack force. Maya, now a heroine of the hive, becomes a teacher like Mrs. Cassandra and shares her experiences and wisdom with the future generation.\n\nAnalysis of the book[]\n\nIt has been suggested that the book may have carried a political message, analogous to Jean de La Fontaine's or Ivan Krylov's work. According to this view, Maya represents the ideal citizen, and the beehive represents a well-organised militarist society. It has also elements of nationalism and speciesism. Maya gets angry in two instances. First, a grasshopper fails to distinguish between bees and wasps. Maya's verbal response includes calling the wasps \"a useless gang of bandits\" [Räubergeschlecht] that have no \"home or faith\" [Heimat und Glauben]. Second, a fly calls Maya an idiot, which prompts Maya to shout that she's going to teach \"respect for bees\" and to threaten the fly with her stinger. The critic interprets this to mean that respect is based on the threat of violence. Collectivism versus individualism is also a theme. Maya's independence and departure from the beehive is seen as reproachable, but it is atoned by her warning of the hornets' attack. This show of loyalty restores her position in the society. In the hornet attack part of the story, the bees' will to defend the hive and the heroic deaths of bee officers are glorified, often in overtly militarist tones.[9]\n\nIn the post-WWII adaptations, the militarist element was toned down considerably, the hornets' role reduced, and the character of Willy, a lazy and quite un-warlike drone bee, was introduced (he does not appear in the novel). In the cartoon series, the briskly marching, but ridiculously incompetent ant armies provide a parody of militarism.\n\nMain characters[]\n\nMaya – Bee. The series main protagonist. She loves freedom and living in the meadow by herself, unlike other bees who live in the hive. She is good, fair, happy and willing to help everybody.\n\nWilly – Bee. Lazy, clumsy, and cowardly, sometimes a showoff, but generally good-natured – not featured in the original Bonsels story, but a major character in all adaptations other than the 1924 film. His relationship to Maya is depicted inconsistently: in most adaptations, he's her best friend, who is secretly in love with her, prone to jealousy when Maya's attentions turn to others. Often reluctantly dragged into adventures by Maya.\n\nFlip (or Philip) – Grasshopper. A wise friend of Maya and Willy. Introduced first in the animated series. Whether he is meant to be identical with the unnamed grasshopper of the books is unclear.\n\nAlexander (or Aleksander) – Mouse. Intellectual, whose level of respect among the other creatures, and close friendship with Maya, often sends Willy into jealous rages. Appears only in the second season of the older animated series (1978).\n\nMiss Cassandra – Bee, Teacher at the Bee-School.\n\nFilms, anime and television[]\n\nCrew Television series Feature films Maya the Honey Bee Maya the Bee Maya the Bee Movie Maya the Bee:\n\nThe Honey Games Maya the Bee: The Golden Orb 1975–1980 2012–2017 2014 2018 2021 Director(s) Seiji Endô and Hiroshi Saitô Daniel Duda and Jérôme Muschadet Alexs Stadermann Noel Cleary and Sergio Delfino Noel Cleary Producer(s) N/A Barbara Stephen and Thorsten Wegener Tracy Lennon, Brian Rosen and Thorsten Wegener Tracy Lenon and Benjamin Ey Executive Producer(s) N/A Katell France Jim Ballantine and Patrick Elemendorff Barbara Stephen and Hans-Ulrich Stoef Martin Krieger, Barbara Stephen and Thorsten Wegener Writer(s) Various Fin Edquist and Marcus Sauermann Story by:\n\nNoel Cleary, Fin Edquist and Alexs Stadermann Adrian Bickenbach and Fin Edquist Composer Karel Svoboda Fabrice Aboulker Ute Engelhardt Editor Marty Murphy Johanna Goldschmidt Adam Rainford Production company Nippon Animation Studio 100 Animation\n\nZDF\n\nTF1\n\nScreen Australia\n\nStudio 100 Animation\n\nFlying Bark Productions\n\nZDF\n\nScreen NSW\n\nStudio 100 Animation\n\nStudio B Productions\n\nScreen Australia\n\nStudio 100 Animation U.S. Distribution Nickelodeon Sprout Shout!

The film was lost for a decade until the only original copy of the film was found in Finland.[10] The material was restored in 2005 with a new musical score and released on DVD in 2012, in collaboration with the KAVI and the Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv, and the film was screened in both Hamburg and Helsinki.[11][10]\n\n1975 anime[]\n\nPerhaps the most popular and widely known adaptation of the story is the Japanese anime Maya the Honey Bee (みつばちマーヤの冒険, Mitsubachi Māya no Bōken, \"The Adventures of Maya the Honey Bee\"). Originally aired on Japanese TV in 1975, the anime has been dubbed into other 10,000 different languages[12] and screened on television in various territories, including China, South Korea, North Korea, Australia, Austria, Germany, Ireland, the United States, South Africa, Peru, Brazil, Portugal, Canada, Quebec, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Iceland, Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, France, Croatia, Chile, Estonia, Israel, Italy, Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Latvia, Lithuania, India, Greece, Denmark, Norway, Belarus, Catalonia, Scotland, Wales, Japan, Albania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Slovenia, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovakia, Spain, Fiji, Jordan, Barbados, Serbia, Finland, Sweden, Poland, Ecuador, Hungary, Romania, Russia, Turkey, Faroe Islands, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Alaska, Kirbati, Solomon Islands, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Malta, Abkhazia, Kurdistan, New Zealand, Kenya, Egypt, Nigeria, Argentina, Mexico, Latin America, Hawaii, Alaska, East Turkestan, Kyrgyzstan, Bangladesh, Basque Country, Iraq, Cambodia, Chad, Tunisia, Zimbabwe, Guatemala, Afghanistan, Algeria, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Papua New Guinea, Nauru, Marshall Islands, Guam, Cape Verde, Burundi, Angola, Republic of the Congo, Camaros, Federated States of Micronesia, Djibouti, Gabon, Eswatini, Lesotho, Cameroon, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, Burkina Faso, Gabon, Haiti, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Seychelles, Togo, Guinea, Central African Republic, Costa Rica, Panama, Paraguay, Nicaragua, Honduras, Cuba, El Salvador, Puerto Rico, Gibraltar, Vatican City, San Marino, Mauritania, Mauritius, Zanzibar, Somaliland, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Brunei, Bahrain, Benin, Botswana, Philippines, East Timor, Madagascar, Yemen, Moldova, Montenegro, Cyprus, Taiwan, Singapore, Maldives, Bhutan, Bolivia, Oman, Anguilla, Aruba, Bahamas, Belize, Bermuda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia, Tanzania, Antigua and Barbuda, Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu, Palau, Laos, Myanmar (Burma), Uruguay, Colombia, Ethiopia, Swabia, Syria, Morocco, Macau, Hong Kong, Somalia, Karakalpakstan, Tatarstan, Crimea, Bashkortostan, North Ossetia–Alania, Chechnya, Kabardino-Balkaria, Ingushetia, Dagestan, Adygea, Karelia, Kalmykia, Chuvashia, Buryatia, Altai, Khakassia, Tuva, Udmurtia, Mordovia, Komi, Sakha, Mari El, Karachay-Cherkessia, Greenland, Kosovo, Vojvodina, Brittany, Cornwall, São Tomé and Príncipe, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Mongolia, Eritrea, Lebanon (as Zena) and Iran (as Nikoo (نیکو)). The Japanese TV series was preceded by Tokyo Kodomo Club's musical play based on the short story, presented as Mitsubachi Māya (\"Maya the Honey Bee\"), distributed on a LP album.\n\nThe original theme was composed by Karel Svoboda and sung by Karel Gott in the German, Czech and Slovak versions; Zbigniew Wodecki in the Polish version.[13][14]\n\n2012 TV series[]\n\nIn 2012 Studio 100 Animation produced a 78-episode, 13-minute TV series.[15] The series was rendered in 3D CGI animation.[16] A second 52 episode season aired in 2017, the CGI has been dubbed into other 10,000 different languages and screened on television in various territories, including China, South Korea, North Korea, Australia, Austria, Germany, Ireland, the United States, South Africa, Peru, Brazil, Portugal, Canada, Quebec, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Iceland, Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, France, Croatia, Chile, Estonia, Israel, Italy, Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Latvia, Lithuania, India, Greece, Denmark, Norway, Belarus, Catalonia, Scotland, Wales, Japan, Albania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Slovenia, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovakia, Spain, Fiji, Jordan, Barbados, Serbia, Finland, Sweden, Poland, Ecuador, Hungary, Romania, Russia, Turkey, Faroe Islands, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Alaska, Kirbati, Solomon Islands, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Malta, Abkhazia, Kurdistan, New Zealand, Kenya, Egypt, Nigeria, Argentina, Mexico, Latin America, Hawaii, Alaska, East Turkestan, Kyrgyzstan, Bangladesh, Basque Country, Iraq, Cambodia, Chad, Tunisia, Zimbabwe, Guatemala, Afghanistan, Algeria, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Papua New Guinea, Nauru, Marshall Islands, Guam, Cape Verde, Burundi, Angola, Republic of the Congo, Camaros, Federated States of Micronesia, Djibouti, Gabon, Eswatini, Lesotho, Cameroon, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, Burkina Faso, Gabon, Haiti, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Seychelles, Togo, Guinea, Central African Republic, Costa Rica, Panama, Paraguay, Nicaragua, Honduras, Cuba, El Salvador, Puerto Rico, Gibraltar, Vatican City, San Marino, Mauritania, Mauritius, Zanzibar, Somaliland, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Brunei, Bahrain, Benin, Botswana, Philippines, East Timor, Madagascar, Yemen, Moldova, Montenegro, Cyprus, Taiwan, Singapore, Maldives, Bhutan, Bolivia, Oman, Anguilla, Aruba, Bahamas, Belize, Bermuda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia, Tanzania, Antigua and Barbuda, Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu, Palau, Laos, Myanmar (Burma), Uruguay, Colombia, Ethiopia, Swabia, Syria, Morocco, Macau, Hong Kong, Somalia, Karakalpakstan, Tatarstan, Crimea, Bashkortostan, North Ossetia–Alania, Chechnya, Kabardino-Balkaria, Ingushetia, Dagestan, Adygea, Karelia, Kalmykia, Chuvashia, Buryatia, Altai, Khakassia, Tuva, Udmurtia, Mordovia, Komi, Sakha, Mari El, Karachay-Cherkessia, Greenland, Kosovo, Vojvodina, Brittany, Cornwall, São Tomé and Príncipe, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Mongolia, Eritrea, Lebanon (as Zena) and Iran (as Nikoo (نیکو)).\n\nFilm series[]\n\nA 2014 film adaptation based upon the 2012 series was released.[17] In 2018, a sequel to the 2014 film, titled Maya the Bee: The Honey Games, released on March 1, 2018 in Germany and May 1, 2018 in United States.\n\nIn 2021, third film, titled Maya the Bee: The Golden Orb was released on January 7, 2021 in Australia. It was delayed from its original 2020 release date due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nStage performances[]\n\nOpera[]\n\nMaya the Bee also served as the basis for a children's opera written by the Croatian composer Bruno Bjelinski in 1963. In 2008 it was staged in Villach, Austria as part of their Carinthian Summer Music Festival.[18] This performance was distinguished by having the \"bees\" played by children and not professional opera singers as it is usually the case.[19]\n\nPuppet musical[]\n\nSinger-songwriter Nancy Harrow created a jazz-musical version of the story, called The Adventures of Maya the Bee, that featured puppets by Zofia Czechlewska. Harrow's adaptation was produced in New York City by The Culture Project in 2000,[20] and was revived in 2012.[21]\n\nMusical[]\n\nOn October 10, 2016, Belgian company Studio 100 (the current owners of the series) created a Flemish stage musical called \"Maya en de Pollenbollen\" based on the 2012 series that has the people dressed in costumes for the characters from the show. The show contains songs made by Studio 100 with a few news songs created exclusively for the show. The musical centers around Maya alongside Flip and Beatrice celebrating Willy's birthday. The musical later returned in the Spring of 2017.\n\nSince 2016, live actors from the original stage show make numerous appearances at numerous stage shows and special events held by Studio 100. Notably Studio 100's annual \"De Grote Sinterklaasshow\" held from late November till early December featuring Sinterklaas and Zwarte Pieten watching various Studio 100 Characters such as Kabouter Plop, and Piet Piraat (including Maya and friends) perform musical numbers on stage. The same actress that portrayed Maya in the musical is also the official Flemish voice of the character and reprised her role for Studio 100's \"De Liedjestuin\" where Maya is singing various Dutch children's songs and nursery rhymes. In The French and Walloon version \"Le Jardin des Refrains\", Maya is played by a different actress.\n\nAmusement Parks[]\n\nAfter Studio 100's acquisition of the franchise, Plopsa began expanding the franchise to its own theme parks. Plopsaland De Panne opened an indoor children's area called \"Mayaland\" on July 3rd, 2011 before the CGI incarnation's begun airing on numerous television stations across Europe. Maya alongside Flip, and Willy would also appear at other Plopsa owned parks such as Plopsa Coo and Plopsa Indoor Hassalt. In Poland, Plopsa opened an indoor theme park called \"Majaland Kownaty\" which opened to the public on September 28th, 2018 which is mostly themed to Maya the Bee but features other Studio 100's IPs (such as Bumba and Piet Piraat).\n\nA year after Mayaland opened in Plopsaland, Holiday Park, Germany opened a similar Maya the Bee children's area called \"Majaland\" which opened March 31, 2012.\n\nVideo games[]\n\nMaya the Bee & Her Friends (Game Boy Color – 1999)\n\nDeveloped by Crawfish, published by Acclaim. Originally developed as a South Park themed game before being reskinned.\n\nMaya the Bee – Garden Adventures (Game Boy Color – 2000)[22]\n\nDeveloped by Neon Studios, published by Acclaim.\n\nMaya the Bee and Friends (mobile – 2006)[23]\n\nDeveloped by Kiloo and co-published by Plan-B Media.\n\nMaya the Bee: The Great Adventure (Game Boy Advance – 2002)[24]\n\nDeveloped by Shin'en Multimedia, published by Acclaim.\n\nMaya the Bee: Sweet Gold (Game Boy Advance – 2005)[25]\n\nDeveloped by Shin'en Multimedia, published by Midway.\n\nThe Bee Game (Game Boy Advance,[26] Nintendo DS[27] – 2007)[28]\n\nThe Bee Game is an adventure video game released for Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance, developed by German studio Independent Arts Software. The game lets players experience the adventures of Maya the Bee and her friend Willie as they search for their friends, lost from a strong storm that has blown through Corn Poppy Meadow.[29]\n\nMaya (Nintendo DS – 2013)\n\nDeveloped by Studio 100 and Engine Software, published by Bandai Namco Games Europe.\n\nMaya the Bee: The Nutty Race (iOS and Android – 2019)\n\nMobile racing game. Developed by Midnight Pigeon in cooperation with Studio 100.\n\nMerchandising[]\n\nMany companies contributed worldwide to the success of the character by producing and selling merchandising. Most of them were drawn between 1976 and 1986 by the French licensed characters specialist André Roche.[30] His works have included motifs for textiles, porcelain, books, comics and games, including a campaign for Kinder Surprise Eggs.\n\nSee also[]\n\nMaya the Honey Bee\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nOfficial website (in German)\n\nThe Finnish Film Archive (November 23, 2005). \"Esitykset: Maija Mehiläinen\" (in Finnish).
