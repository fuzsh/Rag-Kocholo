We've seen a few episodes of Maya the Bee that are available on Netflix that we've really liked. When offered the Maya the Bee Movie ahead of the May 19th release, I gladly accepted!\n\nSynopsis\n\nMaya is a little bee with a big heart. She dreams of an exciting life of freedom, fun and adventure – the world is simply far too interesting to stay inside a hive! Her funny attempts to fit in bring her into trouble with the Queen’s narrow-minded royal advisor, Buzzlina. With her best friend Willy, Maya buzzes out into the meadow on an exhilarating adventure of self-discovery.\n\nWhile most bees believe that other insects should be feared, Maya can’t help but make friends with Flip the charismatic and eccentric grasshopper, Kurt the dung beetle and even Sting, a young hornet. But when the Queen’s royal jelly is stolen, it will take Maya and all of her bug buddies to figure out who did it and how to save the day!\n\nOne of the best-known and beloved children’s brands of all-time, the stories of Maya The Bee have been passed down among generations of families for years. Originally a German children’s novel by Waldemar Bonsels, The Adventures of Maya the Bee was published over a hundred years ago in 1912. Since the original publishing, the book has been translated into many other languages and enjoyed by children all over the world. In addition to the book, Maya The Bee is also a comic book series, appeared in various iterations as animated series and now a major animated feature film.\n\nThe DVD also includes Bonus Features:\n\nA Interview With Maya\n\n“Dancing With Bees” – An Exclusive Episode Of The Maya The Bee TV Series\n\nBlooper Reel\n\nTrailers\n\nThe boys thought Maya the Bee was hilarious (be sure to watch the bloopers when you've finished the movie), but I really like that it's a feel-good movie we can watch together. Teaching friendship and bravery is always a plus in my book!\n\nOne of the most important lessons that I found in the movie “dare to be different.” In the movie, there are specific rules that the bees must follow. Maya works hard to find where she belongs after being told she is different and doesn't belong in the beehive. She learns that every bee is important, even though they may be “different”!\n\nThanks to Shout Factory, one Mom's Messy Miracles reader will win a copy of Maya the Bee Movie for your own home!"
