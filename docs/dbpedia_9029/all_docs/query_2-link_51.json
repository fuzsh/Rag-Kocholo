Maya dreams of an exciting life of discovery, adventure and freedom in the mysterious meadow, away from the endless rules of the hive.\n\nWILLY\n\nMaya’s best friend is Willi, a shy little bee who loves the excitement that Maya brings to his quiet life.\n\nFLIP\n\nAll of the bugs in the meadow look up to Flip, a cool grasshopper that loves music and lives life by his own rules. As soon as they meet, Maya decides that she wants to live that way too.\n\nMISS CASSANDRA\n\nMiss Casandra is every baby bee’s favourite teacher and she loves them all – none more than her newest pupil Maya, who shows her charming teacher that not all rules are meant to be followed.\n\nTHE QUEEN\n\nCharming, kind and wise, the hive’s Queen Bee sees something in Maya that most other bees don’t; she understands that Maya is a unique and very special bee.\n\nSTING\n\nSting is a tough and brave little hornet who believes everything his Dad tells him, especially that bees are his natural enemy. But after he meets Maya the little warrior realises that things can be different…\n\nBUZZLINA\n\nBuzzlina Von Beena is the Queen’s Royal Advisor and the most powerful bee in the hive - she makes the rules and makes sure that everyone obeys them. Buzzlina sees Maya as a fearless troublemaker, one small bee standing in the way of her evil plans…\n\nCRAWLEY\n\nCrawley is the nervous servant of Buzzlina, a bumbling and loyal bee who secretly doesn’t agree with her, but isn’t brave enough to do anything except carry out her orders.\n\nHANK\n\nHank is the ferocious leader of the hornets, the biggest bee-hater of all, and Sting’s Dad. However, underneath his tough exterior, all that Hank really wants is what’s best for his fellow hornets, especially his son.\n\nARNIE & BARNEY\n\nArnie & Barney are a hopeless pair of army ants. The worst in their troop, they are always causing accidents, and when they are sent in search of Maya and Willi they end up having a very silly adventure of their own!"
