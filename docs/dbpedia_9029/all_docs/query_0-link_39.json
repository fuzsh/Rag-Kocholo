        "text": "Children‘s adventure fiction. It‘s spring outside and since insects are the new big subject at my son‘s Kindergarden, we‘ve recently been reading the abbreviated and revised version of Waldemar Bonsels‘s children‘s classic „Maya the Bee“ („Die Biene Maja und ihre Abenteuer“). Published in 1912, the book reads like a strikingly modern animal novel, which, though allegorical and anthropomorphized like all other animal stories, provides instructive glimpses into the world of insects and other creepy-crawlies inhabiting a palace garden meadow. In each chapter, the curious and compassionate little bee Maya meets another idiosyncratic creature and learns more about their physique, their lives and woes: Grasshoppers, flies, dung beetles, dragon flies, harvestmen, spiders or hornets. Most of them have (silly) names and pronounced anthropomorphic characters and they are well-known to those who have watched the 1970s-TV adaptation.\n\nReading the novel and realizing that it was published in 1912 got me wondering about Maya’s wider historical context. I remembered a talk by a colleague at the University of St Andrews who wrote his PhD about the emergence of the professional British entomologist. It traced the history of the Imperial Bureau of Entomology, originally tasked with the identification of noxious insects across the British Empire. The Bureau almost disassembled at the start of the First World War, but then developed its own programmes to prove its contribution to the war effort and eventually survived by devising strategies of using insects as biological controls against pests. Back then, I asked the joking question whether the entomologists also popularized their work by writing children’s books or period-specific invasion scare novels with titles such as „The insects take London“ (referring, of course, to Doctor Who and to post-World-War-Two adventure scenarios where insects, or other animals, are the baddies).\n\nA search of the world wide web did not uncover any such insect invasion literature. What I unearthed, though, was a blog article by the entomologist Simon Leather giving a short overview of entomological children‘s books which, for my period (1871 to 1918) are all part of the wider cannon of what has been called „bourgeois popular literature“ (as opposed to trivial literature, Kasper Maase). These books are characterized by a blend of enticingly adventurous plots with either moralistic or at least instructive passages.\n\nSimon Leather‘s examples are mostly stories of children that shrink to insect-size and come face to face with actual insects (like an early „Honey, I shrunk the Kids“). In Ernest van Bruyssel‘s instructive „The Population of an old Pear Tree or Stories of Insect Life“ (1870), for example, a boy falls asleep under a tree and dreams of rather accurate entomological encounters. The more moralistic Tribulations of Tommy Tiptop (1887), meanwhile, see a boy who loves torturing animals have a series of nightmares in which his former victims take their revenge.\n\nBoth books popularized their entomological subject with their readerships, but there was no other novel advocating insects as successfully as „Maya the Bee“ (curiously missing in Leather‘s list). Maybe that‘s because Waldemar Bonsels turned an animal into his main protagonist and wrote a proper coming-of-age and adventure novel where children could identify with the insect itself.\n\nAccording to anecdote, Bonsels‘s bestseller emerged from a competition between him and his Bohemian friend Bernd Isemann about who could write the better animal novel for children. Both chose insects that were well-researched and popular with the general population (the busybee and the industrious ant); both wrote anthropomorphised allegories formed around the construct of the bee hive and the ant hill, respectively, as so-called „black boxes“ of human imagination (Klausnitzer); and both came up with plots that could be counted among the „future war“ genre. Isemann‘s now almost forgotten novel „Nala und Re. Eine Ameisenfreundschaft“ (An ant friendship 1920, re-published as The ant city in 1943) can be read as a pacifist “ant-utopia”, though (Mariano Martin Rodriguez), where a peaceful double ant colony gets invaded by a foreign, „thieve“ ant colony, two loving friends get separated in the process and, in the end, the few remaining free ants have to go looking for a better place to live.\n\nBonsels, meanwhile, published a story that was altogether a little bit more martial and therefore rang bells with his German readership right before the start of the First World War (see the „pleasure culture of war“). Not only does it paint a rather brutal, black-humoured picture of the struggle for survival in the animal world (where the beautiful dragonfly Schnuck, for example, bites off the head of the friendly fly Hans-Christoph). Maya also clearly regards the honey bee as a superior being in the insect world; the novel ends with an armed conflict involving a frightening horde of hornets invading Maya‘s bee hive; and the lesson learned by Maya – who eventually saves her entire people – is that the indivdual, rather than breaking out from the monotonous working existence, has to subject itself to the higher good of the entire species…\n\nWhile historians have lately been pointing fingers at the nationalistic-imperialistic, martial and Social Darwinist rhetoric of Bonsels‘s Maya, his antisemitism and the ways in which he later tried to endear himself to the Nazi regime, one has to contend, though, that the success of “Maya the Bee” through successive generations is probably independent of ideology: It lies hidden in the unique story and the wealth of characters devised by the author – which could be stripped of their historical context and re-told again and again in varying contexts. Thus, the most recent “Maya the Bee” movie, befitting our own times, tells us how Maya actually prevents (rather than wins) a war against the hornets by proving that bees and hornets can be friends…\n\nReturning to the question of any existing insect invasion literature before World War I, I have an addendum to make from my own library research. Due to his successes in Danish children‘s fiction, Walter Christmas, the subject of my post-doc project, briefly acted as editor of the popular children‘s Christmas magazine „Børnenes Juleroser” (The Children’s Christmas roses) for three years from 1907 to 1909. The 1907 issue featured a short story written by the famous Danish zoologist and popular science book author Jens Orten Bøving-Petersen (1864-1937) entitled „Giant predators in Liliput Land”. And what can I tell you? It’s a fancifully illustrated story/parody about how the Island of Liliput (looking revealingly like a tin-soldier Denmark) is invaded and terrorized by giant fleas, spiders, stag beetles and centipedes – until Gulliver comes to the rescue and pins them. What a scare!\n\nSome notes\n\nPlease let me know if you know of any further insect invasion scare novels before World War I, in any language!\n\nOf course, the determining force of noxious insects in war and thus the possible use of insects as weapons was only discovered and studied during the First and Second World Wars. Insect invasion literature thus only really took off in the 1950s.\n\nAbout the turn to popular entomology following World War I see: Why World War I cultivated an obsession with ants\n\nAbout general connections between military and pest invasions: Collateral Damage. Military invasions beget biological invasions\n\nAn article from Entomology Today about How insects inspire the look of sci-fi and fantasy films\n\nOther famous animal novels of the period include Beatrix Potter’s “Peter Rabbit”, Kenneth Grahame’s “Wind in the Willows”, Anna Sewell’s “Black Beauty”, Jack London’s “Call of the Wild” or Rudyard Kipling’s “Jungle Books”.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThis article is based on the following articles:\n\nRalf Klausnitzer, Von Bienen fabeln: Faszination und Imaginationsgeschichte der Honigbiene (2015)\n\nKasper Maase, Warencharakter, Serialität und Bürgerlichkeit: Die Biene Maja als Klassiker bürgerlicher Populärkultur (2014)\n\nMariano Martin Rodriguez, Ant-Utopias: A Historical Overview of Modern Myrmecological Xenofiction\n\nWDR Stichtag: Dezember 1912: Die Biene Maja und ihre Abenteuer erscheint\n\nWelt: Der Nazi-Dandy, der die Biene Maja erfand"
