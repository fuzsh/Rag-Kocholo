        "text": "The Actual Star\n\nThis is a speculative sci-fi novel with several different timelines, great world building, and Mayan traditions.\n\nDavid Mitchell’s Cloud Atlas meets Octavia Butler’s Earthseed series, as acclaimed author Monica Byrne (The Girl in the Road) crafts an unforgettable piece of speculative fiction about where humanity came from, where we are now, and where we’re going—and how, in every age, the same forces that drive us apart also bind us together.\n\n“A stone-cold masterpiece.”— New Scientist\n\nThe Actual Star takes readers on a journey over two millennia and six continents—telling three powerful tales a thousand years apart, all of them converging in the same cave in the Belizean jungle.\n\nBraided together are the stories of a pair of teenage twins who ascend the throne of a Maya kingdom; a young American woman on a trip of self-discovery in Belize; and two dangerous charismatics vying for the leadership of a new religion, racing toward a confrontation that will determine the fate of the few humans left on Earth after massive climate change.\n\nIn each era, a reincarnated trinity of souls navigates the entanglements of tradition and progress, sister and stranger, and love and hate—until all of their age-old questions about the nature of existence converge deep underground, where only in complete darkness can they truly see.\n\nAdd to Goodreads To-Read List →\n\nThis book is available from:\n\nAs an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases.\n\nWe also may use affiliate links in our posts, as well.

I’d say this is more science meets true crime rather than examining death as part of cultural traditions or debunking myths.\n\nBook of the Year, 2018 Saltire Literary Awards\n\nA CrimeReads Best True Crime Book of the Month\n\nFor fans of Caitlin Doughty, Mary Roach, Kathy Reichs, and CSI shows, a renowned forensic scientist on death and mortality.\n\nDame Sue Black is an internationally renowned forensic anthropologist and human anatomist. She has lived her life eye to eye with the Grim Reaper, and she writes vividly about it in this book, which is part primer on the basics of identifying human remains, part frank memoir of a woman whose first paying job as a schoolgirl was to apprentice in a butcher shop, and part no-nonsense but deeply humane introduction to the reality of death in our lives. It is a treat for CSI junkies, murder mystery and thriller readers, and anyone seeking a clear-eyed guide to a subject that touches us all.\n\nCutting through hype, romanticism, and cliché, she recounts her first dissection; her own first acquaintance with a loved one’s death; the mortal remains in her lab and at burial sites as well as scenes of violence, murder, and criminal dismemberment; and about investigating mass fatalities due to war, accident, or natural disaster, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. She uses key cases to reveal how forensic science has developed and what her work has taught her about human nature.\n\nAcclaimed by bestselling crime writers and fellow scientists alike, All That Remains is neither sad nor macabre. While Professor Black tells of tragedy, she also infuses her stories with a wicked sense of humor and much common sense.\n\nAdd to Goodreads To-Read List →\n\nThis book is available from:\n\nAs an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases.\n\nWe also may use affiliate links in our posts, as well. Thanks!\n\nAll That Remains by Sue Black\n\nCoven of Ill Repute\n\nThis one got my attention on Instagram, as it was described as a “supernatural Sherlock meets a witchy Mary Poppins,” with both characters being on the grumpier side.\n\nTrapped in a haunted castle with my immortal enemy.\n\nThe Duke of the Damned is dead. When my coven is blamed for his murder, I’m desperate to clear their name before my sisters are arrested and I lose the only family I’ve ever known. But I only have one week to find the culprit, and the new heir to the duchy is none other than Detective Liam Rorick, my enigmatic ex-partner and archenemy.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if Rorick is a competent investigator. He’s the most cantankerous vampire I’ve ever had the displeasure of knowing. There’s a reason I swore I’d never work with him again. And yet that’s exactly what I have to do.\n\nNow we’re trapped together in the malevolent castle he’s just inherited, trading insults and fighting magical monsters to survive. I want nothing more than to go back to pretending he doesn’t exist . . . but Rorick protects me like I’m precious and keeps looking at me like he regrets our past.\n\nWith each close call and each revealed clue, it becomes harder to fight our undeniable connection. But even the castle’s hungriest creatures aren’t as frightening as opening my heart to the one man capable of devouring it whole.\n\nAdd to Goodreads To-Read List →\n\nThis book is available from:\n\nAs an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases.\n\nWe also may use affiliate links in our posts, as well.

Prater\n\nyouthjuice\n\nI’d say this one is pretty niche and admittedly, is a first novel with pacing issues, but if you like feminist body horror…this one may be worth a borrow at the library.\n\nAmerican Psycho meets The Devil Wears Prada: outrageous body horror for the goop generation.\n\nA 29-year-old copywriter realizes that beauty is possible—at a terrible cost—in this surreal, satirical send-up of NYC It-girl culture.\n\nFrom Sophia Bannion’s first day on the Storytelling team at HEBE (hee-bee), a luxury skincare/wellness company based in New York’s trendy SoHo neighborhood and named after the Greek goddess of youth, it’s clear something is deeply amiss. But Sophia, pushing thirty, has plenty of skeletons in her closet next to the designer knockoffs and doesn’t care. Though she leads an outwardly charmed life, she aches for a deeper meaning to her flat existence—and a cure for her brutal nail-biting habit. She finds it all and more at HEBE, and with Tree Whitestone, HEBE’s charismatic founder and CEO.\n\nSoon, Sophia is addicted to her HEBE lifestyle—especially youthjuice, the fatty, soothing moisturizer Tree has asked Sophia to test. But when cracks in HEBE’s infrastructure start to worsen—and Sophia learns the gruesome secret ingredient at the heart of youthjuice—she has to decide how far she’s willing to go to stay beautiful forever.\n\nGlittering with ominous flashes of Sophia’s coming-of-rage story, former beauty editor E.K. Sathue’s horror debut is as incisive as it is stomach-churning in its portrayal of all-consuming female friendship and the beauty industry’s short attention span. youthjuice does to skincare influencers what Bret Easton Ellis did to yuppies. You’ll never moisturize the same way again.\n\nAdd to Goodreads To-Read List →\n\nThis book is available from:\n\nAs an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases.\n\nWe also may use affiliate links in our posts, as well.
