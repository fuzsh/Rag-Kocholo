        "text": "Games based on the children's books Die Biene Maja und ihre Abenteuer (The Adventures of Maya the Bee) and Himmelsvolk (People in the sky) by German author Waldemar Bonsels. The book was first published in 1912 and the stories were later adapted into 55 cartoon episodes that have aired from 1975 to 1992. There was a Broadway play as well.\n\nAt first sight, the plot may seem superficial, but it has a much deeper mystical layer showing the unity of all creation and its relationship to God and nature. This was portrayed more explicitly in Bonsels' later work."
