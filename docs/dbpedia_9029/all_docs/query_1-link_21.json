The production will feature a sparkling new set and props by Joe Silovsky and the original dazzling array of puppets from Poland, as well as new staging by Will Pomerantz to the glorious jazz-themed score by Nancy Harrow. The New York Times Spare Times for Children: ‘The Adventures of Maya the Bee’ (Saturday) This feisty puppet heroine has buzzed back for an open-ended run at the Culture Project, where her journey began a dozen years ago. Based on a children’s book by the German author Waldemar Bonsels, “The Adventures of Maya the Bee” relates the title character’s flight from the hive in search of tastes more exotic than honey. The revival has new sets and props, but the same intricate rod and shadow puppets designed by Zofia Czechlewska. Adapted by Rachel Klein, with a score and lyrics by the jazz artist Nancy Harrow, who also conceived the show, “Maya” is a jazz musical for children, and how often do you encounter those?",
