Contact Me for free Save the Bees activity pages and a teacher’s guide.\n\nGreat for reading aloud and bedtime stories. Immerse yourself in Maya‘s enchanting adventures and learn about the magical world of insects and nature.\n\nReaders’ Reviews\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ A great classic\n\nI truly enjoyed reading the story of Maya the bee again after almost 50 years. The brave little bee encounters many adventures and learns many life lessons after she leaves her beehive all by herself. I find it is still a relevant story for everybody, not only for children. The book is beautifully translated and illustrated. I bought it for our childcare library, and it is great to read it to the kids, a chapter a day. They love it too.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Absolutely beautiful story\n\nBeautifully translated and illustrated book. It will touch your soul deeply.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️A must read for all ages!\n\nI enjoyed \"Maya the Bee\" a lot! I couldn't put it down; I just had to find out which bug she was meeting next. I loved all the interactions with the other insects and species. Maya was my favorite because of her free spirit and great sense of adventure, but I like that she develops a deep devotion to her hive as the story progresses.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Such a lovely read\n\nA thoroughly enjoyable classic book for children and adults alike. The artwork is also very beautiful! Wholeheartedly recommended. ;)\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Love this book\n\nLove this book, it is so entertaining and full of facts at the same time, highly recommended!\n\nKarin Redclift is a German creative writer, translator, proofreader, and literary tutor with a deep passion for children’s books.\n\nBorn and raised in Southern Germany, her love for kidlit started as a child and deepened when she began teaching and tutoring elementary-age children. She is a proud 5+-year volunteer at Reading Partners and believes reading aloud is FUN-damental!\n\nWriting German and English and discovering ways to bring books into a new language is an incredible challenge that is very fulfilling and satisfying when accomplished.\n\nSharing this beloved German children's book from her childhood with a new English-speaking audience was both thrilling and loads of fun."
