        "text": "Story\n\nIn Maya the Bee: The Honey Games, Maya (voice of Coco Jack Gillies) is an enthusiastic young bee who believes in herself and really wants to help others. The Queen (Justine Clarke) has an estranged sister, the Empress of Buzztropolis (Marney McQueen). Maya hears that the Empress has ordered the Queen’s hive to give half of its meagre store of honey to the Honey Games, despite the fact that the Queen’s hive might not survive the winter. Maya is furious and sets out to deal with this injustice.\n\nUnfortunately, Maya and her best friend Willi (Benson Jack Anthony) make the situation far worse when their meeting with the Empress goes terribly wrong. Maya suddenly finds herself competing in the Honey Games for the survival of her entire hive. She and Willi must encourage their team of misfit bugs to work together to defeat the cruel Violet (Linda Ngo) and her team of champions from Buzztropolis.\n\nThemes\n\nThreats to survival; competition\n\nViolence\n\nMaya the Bee: The Honey Games has some violence and accidental harm. For example:\n\nDuring a dragonfly race, several bugs bang together and crash into the bushes.\n\nMaya crashes into two guards from Buzztropolis.\n\nMaya and Willi inadvertently crash into the Empress, cover her with honey and stick to her.\n\nCompetitors throw pollen puffs at each other.\n\nGiant drops of water knock bugs off course.\n\nMaya crashes into a honey cup and breaks it.\n\nViolet tries to push Maya and her team mates off their dragonflies.\n\nSexual references\n\nNothing of concern\n\nAlcohol, drugs and other substances\n\nNothing of concern\n\nNudity and sexual activity\n\nNothing of concern\n\nProduct placement\n\nNothing of concern\n\nCoarse language\n\nThere is some name calling in this film including “loser”, “loser bugs” and “mixed up bunch of weirdos”.\n\nIdeas to discuss with your children\n\nMaya the Bee: The Honey Games is an animated movie with a predictable plot, which is aimed at young audiences. Some scenes might scare very young viewers, so we recommend parental guidance for children under five years. The movie is likely to lack interest for most children over eight years.\n\nThese are the main messages from this movie:\n\nWe should all believe in ourselves.\n\nEveryone has a special talent.\n\nBy working together, we achieve far more than we ever could alone.\n\nValues in this movie that you could reinforce with your children include:\n\nkindness towards others\n\nforgiveness and understanding\n\nresponsibility for our own actions\n\nteamwork.\n\nThis movie could also give you the chance to talk with your children about honesty and learning from our mistakes, as well as listening to parents’ advice about some situations rather than taking things into your own hands."
