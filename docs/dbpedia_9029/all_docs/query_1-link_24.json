        "text": "More on Maya the Bee Movie\n\nMovie session times\n\nFull movies coverage\n\nSome animated films can be enjoyed by viewers of any age. Others, basically, can't. Alexs Stadermann's Maya the Bee Movie belongs in the second category, which is not to say it isn't perfect for under-fives.\n\nAn official Australian-German co-production – several other countries were tangentially involved – the film is based on a German children's book published just over a century ago, which has led to many previous spin-offs including an opera, at least two TV shows and a number of computer games. A live-action adaptation from 1924 is apparently the first narrative feature with a cast made up solely of insects; you can watch an extract on YouTube if you're really keen.\n\nGetting back to the current version, Maya (voiced by nine-year-old newcomer Coco Jack Gillies) is a restless young bee who leaves her hive and sets out to explore the surrounding meadow, making new friends such as a fast-talking Cockney grasshopper (Richard Roxburgh),\n\nIt's a wearyingly familiar story – and even the jokes, mostly insect puns, aren't the kind that adults are likely to enjoy. On the other hand, the message is unusually progressive. Maya, with her dauntless spirit of adventure, is seen as admirable in every respect: at no point is she made to worry about her physical appearance, nor does she have lessons to learn other than \"be yourself\".\n\nWhere the book reportedly had militaristic undertones (not too surprising for Germany in 1912) the film comes down firmly on the side of tolerance and pacifism. The bees and the hornets proclaim themselves sworn enemies but turn out to be not so different after all – and when fearsome predators do show up, it's assumed that the best course is not to fight them but to steer clear.\n\nAs for the animation, it's reasonable if you're not expecting Pixar, with some attempt at visual texture: diffused light, dust motes drifting by. The bees look nothing like bees, which is disappointing but at least makes things easy if your child wants to play dress-up: a striped jumper, stockings, some pipe-cleaner antennae, and you're good to go."
