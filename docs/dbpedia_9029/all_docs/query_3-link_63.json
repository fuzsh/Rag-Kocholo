        "text": "About the Experience\n\nWant to experience something different?….really different.\n\nLearn about the intriguing world of honey bees in a way that few get to experience: through the hands­-on exploration of an active, living beehive!\n\nYour tour, led by Nathan Stewart, a professional Doreen based beekeeper, will include suiting up in protective gear, lighting a bee smoker, and spending two hours as real-life Beekeeper.\n\nInitially, Nathan will give you some tips on what to look for inside a hive including how to spot the Queen and where to look to potentially witness the birth of a new worker bee. Then, together we’ll lift the lid of a busy hive, watch bees at work creating honey, pull out a frame of honey ready for extraction, and get up close with more than 100,000 bees!\n\nAfter we carefully close the lid, we’ll sample some of the honey direct from the hives while enjoying a refreshing honey tonic compliments of Karen, Managing Director of Rivers of Yarrambat (who is also a passionate beekeeper herself).\n\nOnce the Tour completes you can relax and delight your senses enjoying a food platter with a selection of locally sourced ingredients from the Rivers Cafe.\n\nWhere we'll be\n\nYou'll spend the morning at the beautiful Rivers of Yarrambat. Travel 35 minutes out of Melbourne to leafy Yarrambat to one of Melbourne's leading Garden and Wellness Centres.\n\nTransport\n\nTravelling from Melbourne? Haven't got your own transport? Just let us know and we can help. You can easily catch a Train from Melbourne Flinders Street Station to South Morang (Mernda Line) - about 45min ride. Nathan will pick you up from the Station\n\nWhat I’ll provide\n\nRefreshing Honey Tonic - with a touch of lime and ginger\n\nRental of Bee Suit, Gloves & Garters\n\nDelicious Food Platter - Delight your senses with a selection of locally sourced ingredients from the Rivers Cafe.\n\nWhat to bring\n\nSolid Shoes or Boots\n\nSocks\n\nLong Pants\n\nBottle of Water"
