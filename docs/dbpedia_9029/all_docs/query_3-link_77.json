        "text": "Freedom requires courage and good friends. Maya the bee lives in a poppy field, together with her lazy best friend Willy, and many other friends as well. She’s always searching for happiness outside the strict regimented routines of her bee colony. This means that she’s often involved in some exciting adventures and regularly finds herself in difficult situations. Her lively and curious personality coupled with her joy of discovery means she’s able to enjoy a wide range of experiences that all help her go on her way in peace and freedom."
