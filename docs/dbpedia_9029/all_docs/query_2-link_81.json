        "text": "“Maya the Bee Movie” is a sweet, colorful animated story aimed at young children. Let’s just hope no actual bees watch it.\n\nHoneybees have been mysteriously dying in recent years, raising concerns that there won’t be enough of them to do the pollinating job bees are supposed to do. So we don’t need any of the remaining bees hearing the message of this film’s title character, who thinks her kind should not be content merely to perform their assigned roles.\n\nMaya (voiced by Coco Jack Gillies) is a young bee who hears nothing but “don’ts” from grown-ups: “Bees don’t dream” and “Bees don’t sing” and “Bees don’t have fun.” But her curiosity and spirit are not to be stifled, and soon she finds herself outside the hive and on a wide-ranging adventure where she learns that the things we’re taught to fear sometimes aren’t all that fearsome.\n\nThat includes hornets, the bees’ sworn enemies. Maya becomes instrumental in heading off a bee-hornet confrontation, as well as in thwarting an internal plot against the beloved queen bee."
