        "text": "The list of official participants in this year’s fifth edition of Upstate Art Weekend, a sprawling festival that embraces nearly every art event or exhibition happening north of New York City over the next four days, has reached 145. It’s a dramatic rise from an informal band of some two dozen arts centers and galleries just four years ago, and it now spans 10 counties in New York State.\n\nWhile the participants include perpetually open historical sites like Boscobel and Olana, and also a few aesthetically inclined specialty grocers and clothing designers, most of the exhibits really are up just for the occasion, and many include one-off performances, like Audra Wolowiec’s choral performance on a boat crossing the Hudson."
