Freshly-hatched Maya is a little whirlwind who won’t follow the rules of the hive. One of these rules is not to trust the hornets that live beyond the meadow. When the Royal Jelly is stolen, the hornets are suspected and Maya is thought to be their accomplice. No one believes that she is the innocent victim and no one will stand by her, except for her good-natured best friend, Willy. After a long and eventful journey to the hornets’ hive, Maya and Willy soon discover the true culprit and set about bringing him to book."
