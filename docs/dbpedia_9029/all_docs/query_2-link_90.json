        "text": "Last weekend we went for a walk around the Lake Starnberg in Bavaria/Germany (near München). Meanwhile we enjoyed the great view to the Alps I discovered an interesting villa near Münsing. It had a remarkable gate. My husband immediately recognized it saying: it’s a typical Szekely/Transylvanian gate. When we got closer we’d found out that the famous Hungarian painter, Gyula Benczúr used to live here until 1883. When he retired and moved back to Hungary, the German writer Waldemar Bonsels bought it and lived there until his death. But who was Mr Bonsels? I had to admit that I have never heard of him but according to a memorial tablet at the entrance door he was the author of The Maya the bee book! This comic was one of my favorite in my childhood! -I exclaimed so-Let’s get in!-I suggested to my hubby but it turned out that it could be possible to visit (the house and the grave of the writer, because he’s buried in the garden of the villa under a mossy tombstone) only after making an appointment with the Waldemar Bonsels Foundation. Okay then we will come back in the near future.\n\nMore about the adventures of Maya the bee\n\nWaldemar Bonsels most famous children’s book was the Maya the Bee, (Die Biene Maja). According to the Wikipedia this short novel served the basis for a Japanese animated television series named Maya the honey bee in the mid-1970s, as well as a Croatian opera for children written by Bruno Bjielinsky, making Bonsels work known to even a great audience. The Opera was staged in 2008 in Villach, Austria at the Carinthian Summer Music Festival. And what a coincidence a new version of Maya the bee will be released next week in the German cinemas!\n\nThe Bee is the main character in The Adventures of Maya the Bee, a comic book series and animated television series, first written by Waldemar Bonsels and was published in 1912. Bonsels original book contains fewer that 200 pages. It was a great success so later on the book has been published in many other languages.\n\nThe stories revolve around a little bee, Maya and her friends Willy the bee, Flip the grasshopper (referred to as “Maja”, “Willi” and “Philip” respectively in some versions), Mrs. Cassandra (Maya’s teacher), and many other insects and other creatures. The book depicts Maya’s development from an adventurous youngster to a responsible adult member of bee society.\n\nMaya is a bee born in a bee hive during internal unrest: the hive is dividing itself into two new colonies. Maya is raised by her teacher, Mrs. Cassandra. Despite Mrs. Cassandra’s warnings, Maya wants to explore the wide world and commits the unforgivable crime of leaving the hive. During her adventures, Maya, now in exile, befriends other insects and braves dangers with them. In the climax of the book, Maya is taken prisoner by hornets, the bees’ sworn enemies. Prisoner of the hornets, Maya learns of a hornet plan to attack her native hive. Maya is faced with the decision to either return to hive and suffer her due punishment, saving the hive, or leaving the plan unannounced, saving herself but destroying the hive. As May(a) bee expected, Maya, after severe pondering, makes the decision to return. In the hive, she announces the coming attack and is, totally unexpectedly, pardoned. The forewarned bees triumph over the hornet attack force. Maya, now a heroine of the hive, becomes a teacher, like Mrs. Cassandra and shares her experiences and wisdom with the future generation.\n\nAccording to a new study the book may have carried a political message, analogous to La Fointaine’s work. The view says that Maya represents the ideal citizen, and the beehive represents a well-organised militarist society. It has also elements of nationalism and speciesism. Maya gets angry in two instances. First, a grasshopper fails to distinguish between bees and wasps. Maya’s verbal response includes calling the wasps “a useless gang of bandits” that have no “home or faith”. Second, a fly calls Maya an idiot, which prompts Maya to shout that she’s going to teach “respect for bees” and to threaten the fly with her stinger. The critic interprets this to mean that respect is based on the threat of violence. Collectivism versus individualism is also a theme. Maya’s independence and departure from the beehive is seen as reproachable, but it is atoned by her warning of the hornets’ attack. This show of loyalty restores her position in the society. In the hornet attack part of the story, the bees’ will to defend and the heroic deaths of bee officers are glorified, often in overtly militarist tones. In the post-WWII adaptations, the militarist element was toned down considerably, the hornets’ role reduced, and the character of Willy, a lazy and quite un-warlike drone bee, was introduced (he does not appear in the novel). In the cartoon series, the briskly marching, but ridiculously incompetent ant armies provide a parody of militarism.\n\nThis theory seems very plausible since Bonsels was an outspoken anti-Semite and expressed his approval of Nazi politics against Jews in 1933, calling the Jew a deadly enemy whos was poisoning the European culture.\n\nI was inspired by the book and prepared a Maya the bee cupcake (with honey and lemon cream)!"
