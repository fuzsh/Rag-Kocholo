        "text": "Story\n\nMaya the Bee (voiced by Coco Jack Gillies) is an adventurous and fun-loving little bee who doesn’t want to follow the rules of her hive. When Maya is banished from the hive, she and her best friend Willy (Kodi Smit-McPhee) must survive outside in the meadow. With help from a friendly grasshopper named Flip (Richard Roxburgh), Maya and Willy learn that other bugs are friendly and not scary at all.\n\nBack at the hive, the queen bee’s (Miriam Margolyes) royal jelly is stolen. The hive blames the hornets, who are the bees’ worst enemies. Maya and her new friends must save the queen and prevent the bees and the hornets from having a nasty battle.\n\nThemes\n\nDeath of the queen bee; separation from a parent; soldiers and battles; crime\n\nViolence\n\nMaya the Bee has some violence. For example:\n\nThe bees and hornets both have soldiers who try to fight each other. The bees have sharp leaves, which they use as spears, and the hornets fire spit balls at the bees.\n\nHornets yell and push each other.\n\nA hornet threatens Maya with his stinger.\n\nBats and frogs try to attack and eat Willy and Maya.\n\nSexual references\n\nNone of concern\n\nAlcohol, drugs and other substances\n\nNone of concern\n\nNudity and sexual activity\n\nNone of concern\n\nProduct placement\n\nNone of concern\n\nCoarse language\n\nThere is some very mild coarse language in Maya the Bee.\n\nIdeas to discuss with your children\n\nBased on the television series, Maya the Bee is an enjoyable movie about learning to be yourself, standing up for your friends and accepting others for who they are.\n\nThe movie is ideal for children aged 5-10 years. Although there are some witty puns that might make adults laugh, older children will probably find this movie a little boring. There are some scary scenes, so parental guidance is recommended for children aged under six years.\n\nThis movie could give you the chance to talk with your children about:\n\nthe importance of not treating people badly, even if they’re different\n\nthe real-life consequences of not following the rules."
