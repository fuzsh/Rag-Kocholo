        "text": "music career\n\nIn 1963, Tom Jones began singing with the Welsh beat band, Tommy Scott and the Senators, as their lead singer. During one of his outings with the band, he caught the attention of Gordon Mills, a London-based music executive. Mills brought him to England in 1964 and also became his manager. It was at this point that he changed his name to “Tom Jones” (directed by Mills) to boost the popularity of the 1963 hit of the same name. He also signed with Decca Records in 1964 and released his debut song Chills and Fever later that year.\n\nSeveral other singles followed in 1965 and many of them, including “It’s Not Unusual”, “Green Grass Of Homeland”, “I’ll Never Fall In Love Again”, “Delilah” and “I’m Coming Home”, topped the UK charts and to the USA. His songs also addressed a number of hit films during the period, including What’s New Pussycat? In 1966 he was awarded a Grammy for Best New Artist. Jones also gave several successful concerts in Las Vegas.\n\nBetween 1969 and 1971, Tom Jones starred on the ITV/ABC variety show, This Is Tom Jones . Within this time Jones also released a number of hit singles including “She’s a Lady”, “See You” and “Say You Stay Till Tomorrow”. He later starred in a self-titled variety show from 1980 to 1981.\n\nSubsequently, Tom Jones successfully worked together several times until releasing a number of albums in the 1990s, including Reload (1999). He has also appeared in several TV movies/series including The Simpsons (1993), The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1993), Attacks of Mars! (1996) and Agnes Browne (1999).\n\nThe legendary crooner later released several other albums including Tom Jones & Jools Holland (2004), 24 Hours (2008), Praise & Blame (2010), Ghost in the Room (2012) and Long Lost Suitcase (2015). In all, Tom Jones has forty-one studio albums and hundreds of songs to his credit.\n\nOn April 10, 2016, Tom Jones lost his wife of fifty-nine years, Linda Trenchard to cancer. Although married to Tom Jones her entire life, Trenchard reaped next to none of his fame as Jones lived a highly promiscuous life. The music knight admitted to sleeping with up to 250 groupies annually throughout his music career. He also had several well-publicized affairs with many women; Most of them were celebrities. Katherine Berkery gave birth to a son named Jonathan Berkery in 1987. That same year, Jones released a single entitled “A Boy from Nowhere”, possibly inspired by his denial of Jonathan’s paternity.\n\nIs Tom Jones still alive?\n\nSir Tom is very much alive and kicking. Most interestingly, he is still active in his music career. The only difference is the fact that he is getting old and not in very good health.\n\nSir Jones delighted fans with a lively and energetic performance that proved his age at his 21st July 2019 concert at Castle Park, Colchester. The legendary singer performed at Slessor Gardens and Chester Racecourse on 27 July and 12 August 201.\n\nHow much is his net worth?\n\nSir Tom Jones’ estimated net worth is between $250 and $300 million. He garnered the delicious value of his career as an entertainer with music, TV shows and acting. Among numerous other highlights of his career, his 1969-79 show That’s Tom Jones reportedly earned him a whopping $9 million.\n\nTom Jones’ height\n\nTom Jones has an average height of 5 feet 10 inches, which approximates the equivalent of 1.78 meters. Even as he ages, Jones maintains a trim and fit body."
