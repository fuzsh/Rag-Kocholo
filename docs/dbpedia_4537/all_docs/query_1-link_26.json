        "text": "Post by BAZanine on\n\nSir Thomas John Woodward (7 June 1940 - present)\n\nYears Active: 1963 - present\n\nVocal Range: F♯1 - D6\n\n{Vocal Summary by clem }With several Grammy and Brit Awards, record sales in excess of 100 million and even a knighthood from the Queen to his name, it is with good reason that Tom Jones is seen as one of the greatest British recording artists of all-time.\n\nKnown for his rich, resonant, open-throat style of vocal, Jones has proved a versatile singer across a number of different styles, ranging from traditional pop to soul or R&B. This versatility has caused the voice type of Tom Jones to be controversial for some time, sounding very comfortable belting in a chesty mix up into the low 5th octave, but projecting with firmness in timbre down to the low-mid 2nd octave, with adequate lower passages down to F♯1. But despite Jones's voice in his early career sometimes being labeled as that of a baritenor or tenor because of his high-belting prowess (Jones himself has even described that era of his voice as the latter), his timbre throughout his adult life has consistently been more like that of a baritone (comparable to Elvis Presley), with the natural weight of his voice becoming more apparent with age. His natural fach is at its most blatant when crooning in his mid-range, which he does with great, unaffected warmth. Tom's head register isn't one of his most utilised or developed assets, though he has displayed moments of singing in a falsetto tone, as well as James Brown-esque' howls up to B5 in his head voice.\n\nBut as impressive as his consistency through his range is in its own right, a great part of the appeal of Tom Jones as a performer is his nuanced delivery; showing intuitive use of a broad dynamic range, ornamenting sustained notes with a wide, quasi-operatic vibrato. His diction is noticably modified to neutralise his Welsh accent when singing, adopting a more American-influenced, Mid-Atlantic type of pronunciation. However, although his diction is a bit affected, he still enunciates clearly and doesn't have to alter his vowel sounds too much, even on particularly challenging notes. Whilst his voice has generally aged very well, Tom's access to his head register and the apex of his belting range has naturally diminished somewhat, rarely going above B♭4 since the mid-2000s. However, he still continues to perform to a very high standard, showing the stamina and vibrant tone of a man younger than his years.\n\nOverall, Jones is a masterfully accomplished vocalist and showman, with charisma to spare, and an instrument that continues to impress into the 5th decade of his career.\n\nSignificant High Notes:\n\nD6 (\"Bama Lama Bama Loo\" live 11/06/1965)\n\nC♯6
