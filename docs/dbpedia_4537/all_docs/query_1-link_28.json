        "text": "In 1969, yet another variety show premiered. This Is Tom Jones began on ABC and ran from 1969 to 1971, featuring singer Tom Jones as he interviewed celebrity guests including Cher, Bob Hope, and many other top stars of the time. The show also featured comedy sketches by the Ace Trucking Company improvisational group (founded by Fred Willard!). The show was nominated four times and won one Emmy, for Best Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy.\n\nNow, Jones is 84 years old and said that he loves singing just as much as he ever did and continues to tour. Right now, he is in the midst of a worldwide tour, taking him to places all around the globe, until August 2024. After that, he is set to embark on a North American tour this fall. He admitted that he is not even thinking about retirement.\n\nThe Welsh singer revealed, “The only way [I would retire] is if I couldn’t sing any more. If something went wrong with my vocal ability, I wouldn’t want to go on not in full strength. I wouldn’t like to shortchange an audience.” As far as his personal life goes, he is celebrating having a great-grandson. Jones was married to Melinda Rose “Linda” Trenchard from 1957 until her death in 2016. His most recent album, Surrounded by Time (2021) features songs about his wife’s battle with cancer.\n\nWhen asked if he would ever consider doing a hologram show or letting his estate do one when he’s gone, he said, “It’s a good question because I’ve never really thought about that … If people want to go and see that then fine. If that’s all you’ve got left of that person and you still want to go and see that because it’s a film of a person you love, then… but I haven’t thought about that because I’m nowhere near that.”\n\nDo you remember watching This Is Tom Jones? How did it stack up to the variety shows of that time period?"
