        "text": "His love of American rhythm and blues helped Welsh singer Tom Jones score international hits and achieve fame and fortune. But, back in 1969, that love also gave him a taste of something far less pleasant.\n\nJones had just welcomed American singer Wilson Pickett to his TV show This is Tom Jones and had been thrilled with their soulful duet of the Beatles classic Hey Jude.\n\nAfter post-show drinks, Jones told Pickett how much he loved singing R&B and that's when things got a bit \"unlovely.\"\n\nAUDIO | Why Tom Jones is over being over the top\n\n\"He said 'That was an excuse for rhythm and blues,'\" Jones recalled in an interview with CBC's The National.\n\n\"I said, 'It didn't seem like that to me.'\n\n\"'No,' he said. 'Because you're white.'\"\n\nPickett went further.\n\n\"'Before long we're not going to need you. We'll have our own TV shows,' Jones recalled the soul singer-songwriter saying.\n\n\"I said, 'Wait a minute. Whoa. What's going on? I just love singing it. You know what I mean?'\n\nJones — perhaps best known as the hip-shaking, tight-trousered, open-shirted sex-bomb baritone singer — is revisiting his career in the new autobiography Over The Top and Back. He noted, for instance, that his TV show and chosen musical style offered a unique window into U.S. racial tensions of the time.\n\n\"Things were different then,\" he said. \"To get a black female singer on my show… you couldn't do certain songs if it had anything to do with relationships.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it, because in Britain it's not like that... In Britain, on British television shows, [I] never had any trouble.\"\n\nJones is among a wide group of British musicians of the era — from the Rolling Stones to Eric Clapton to Joe Cocker — who were inspired by, embraced and borrowed heavily from black American peers.\n\nHe recalled that, as his 1965 hit It's not Unusual climbed the charts in the U.S., one black radio DJ found it hard to believe Jones was actually from Wales.\n\n\"'Whoever is singing this song is not white. He may be passing for white, but he's not white,'\" Jones recalled the DJ saying.\n\nIn the years since, Jones has reinvented himself — singing everything from pop to rock to country. But it's R&B he still seems to cherish the most, harkening back to his days listening to BBC Radio as a child.\n\n\"I used to perk up. 'What is that?' You know, because it got to me.\""
