        "text": "[after being formally knighted at Buckingham Palace] It is fantastic. It was lovely to see the Queen again. I love seeing the Queen and I have always been a royalist. She has got a great smile and her whole face lights up when she smiles. I told her I have been in show business 41 years successfully and she said to me that I had given a lot of people a lot of pleasure. I come from a coal-mining, working-class background. My father was a coal miner. Today is just tremendous. When you first come into show business and you get a hit record, it is the start of something. As time goes on, it just gets better. This is the best thing that I have had. It is a wonderful feeling, a heady feeling. Sometimes you just can't believe it, you think you have been dreaming.\n\nOn singing privately with Elvis Presley in Hawaii in 1968: There was a Kris Kristofferson song called 'Why Me, Lord' and he would sing it continuously. Once he got hold of one that he liked he would never stop. I would try and get out of the suite, because sometimes he would stay on in Vegas, and I was having to do two shows a night, and I'd be singing with him and I'd say, 'I've got to go. The sun's coming up and I've got to rest my voice because I've been singing all night with you.' He'd say OK, and I'd go, and just when I got to the door he'd start again. 'Uh-why me Lord, uh - what have I uh-ever done ...' We'd already done it 30 or 40 times."
