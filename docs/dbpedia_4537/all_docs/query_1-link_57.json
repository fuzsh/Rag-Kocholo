As we get older, our voices drop, and we get more character in them. The older you get, the less control you have over your vocal cords.\n\n\"All you have got to do is push it harder ... and I can still do that. I can still sing and I can prove it, so here it is.\"\n\nHe added: \"Being older, I feel I've got a point to prove. I can still sing and I can prove it, so here it is.\"\n\nThe 'Sex Bomb' hitmaker also admitted being a sex symbol has \"backfired\" on him.\n\nThe silver fox said: \"You have to use shtick and then it caught on and I was drowning in a sea of panties after a while. It backfired on me.\n\n\"It was like the room keys. I was in Vegas, and someone threw a room key at me and I said, 'Whose is this?' and this woman said, 'Use it and you will find out'.\"\n\nThe 'Not Unusual' hitmaker previously insisted he's “nowhere near” being turned into a hologram version of himself for gigs.\n\nTom isn't thinking of retirement or being projected on stage as ABBA have done with their ‘Abbatars’ due to being too old or ill to perform for his fans.\n\nHe said when asked by the Metro newspaper if he would like to see an ABBA-style hologram show of Tom Jones happen, or his voice used in AI if he lost his voice or was forced to quit performing: “I don’t know – hopefully that’s nowhere near! I’m still able to get up there and do it live.\n\n“I don’t know, it's a good question because I’ve never really thought about that. “If people want to see it– like when they put up the film of Elvis and they’d have a live band in front.\n\n“As long as they could see him on the screen it was almost like he was there. It’s a hard call, because if people want to go and see that, then fine.\n\n“If that’s all you've got left of that person and you still want to go and see that, because it’s a film of a person you love, then – I haven’t seen the ABBA hologram – I’ve seen it advertised but I haven’t actually seen what it looks like on stage.”"
