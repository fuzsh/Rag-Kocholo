        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n15 Jun 2023, 13:48\n\nCredit: Getty\n\nSir Tom Jones isn’t going anywhere!\n\nThe legendary Welsh musician recently turned 83, and with 60 years of hits under his belt, it’s understandable to think that the It’s Not Unusual singer might want to relax in his later years.\n\nNot so much it seems! In a new interview with Metro.co.uk, Sir Tom revealed his retirement plans, and why he’ll only slow down for one reason.\n\nWhen asked about his plan to enjoy retirement, the Delilah singer admitted: “The only way [I would retire] is if I couldn’t sing any more.\n\n“If something went wrong with my vocal ability, I wouldn’t want to go on not in full strength. I wouldn’t like to shortchange an audience.”\n\nHis advice for younger artists who are giving it their all in the early days of their careers? Make sure you don’t wear yourself out too soon.\n\nThe chart-topper added: “When you’re young, you’re moving around the stage and want to get as much out of it as possible, and you have to be careful you don’t burn out. You can fire all your guns at once and that could be a problem. So you’ve got to learn to pace yourself, that’s important.”\n\nWhen he does decide to hit the stage one last time, Sir Tom isn’t opposed to the idea of a hologram show, like ABBA Voyage, or even AI carrying on without him.\n\nHe continued: “It’s a good question because I’ve never really thought about that … If people want to go and see that then fine. If that’s all you’ve got left of that person and you still want to go and see that because it’s a film of a person you love, then… but I haven’t thought about that because I’m nowhere near that.”\n\nSir Tom is ready to kick off his next UK and European tour, which kicks off tomorrow (16th June) in Belfast, before moving onto Romania, Bulgaria, Germany, Austria, Hungary and Switzerland.\n\nThe What’s New Pussycat artist will return to the UK to perform in Brighton, Greenwich, Leicester, Cardiff and Margate in July.\n\nSir Tom’s return to the stage comes a few short months after having his second hip replacement surgery.\n\nIn November 2022, he had his right hip replaced recently, having had the left one done back in 2017."
