        "text": "Full Name: Thomas John Woodward\n\nProfession: Singer\n\nBiography: One of the most popular vocalists and hit makers of the last five decades, Jones rose from a pub singer to a Las Vegas headliner, winning the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1966.\n\nSome notable songs from the early stage of his career include \"It's Not Unusual\", \"Green, Green Grass of Home\", \"Delilah\" and \"She's A Lady\n\nA resurgence in popularity the late 1980s was sparked by a cover version of Prince's \"Kiss\" in collaboration with the British band Art of Noise. This led to a series of recordings pairing him with contemporary performers throughout the 1990s.\n\nIn the 2010's, yet another resurgence came though his involvement as a coach in the television singing competition \"The Voice UK\", beginning in 2012. He also released a trio of well regarded gritty albums.\n\nBorn: June 7, 1940\n\nBirthplace: Pontypridd, Wales, United Kingdom\n\nAge: 84 years old"
