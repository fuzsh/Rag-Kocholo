        "text": "I am a huge fan of Tom Jones' singing, as cheesy as much of his repertoire is, but the man is kind of a proto-Ken Tamplin in terms of his range, control and general vocal ability. I notice on songs where he has to sing really high phrases, he sings pretty light and bright on his low notes, but when he sores up high, he always hits the notes from above and can control it amazingly. I've never heard any singer like him. He is a lowish baritone who can hit sustained Pavarotti-ish high C's and even high D's with vibrato! He is pretty old now and his peak was arguably from the mid-sixties to the early 70's, but what a voice. Definitely one of the greatest voices ever in the age of recorded music.\n\nMy question though, is whether he is a good example of vocal technique to emulate? He seems kind of like a bel-cantoish pop rock singer, kinda like a low baritone Ronnie James Dio on some of his songs."
