        "text": "REVIEW: Tom Jones at the Orpheum Theatre, Boston, Wednesday night\n\nBOSTON –There’s a line midway through Leonard Cohen’s wonderful 1988 tune “Tower of Song” that goes “I was born with the gift of a golden voice,” and when Tom Jones sang it Wednesday night before a packed house at The Orpheum Theatre in Boston, the throng of 2,700 fans erupted in cheers, with half of them standing and all of them applauding wildly.\n\nThe venerable Welshman nodded quickly and didn’t miss a beat, or a note, and that was the prevailing impression you came away with after his 19-song, one-hour, 40-minute show. Jones, 82, still has that booming baritone, truly a golden voice.\n\nJones drew seven songs from his latest album, “Surrounded by Time,” released in April 2021. It debuted at No. 1 on the charts in the United Kingdom, and Jones was proud to tell the audience that made him the oldest male singer to ever have an album chart in the U.K.’s top spot. Jones did perform his best-known hits of the past, of course, but the rest of his set included those fresh new tunes and a smart sampling of songs he’s done recently.\n\nJones noted that he’s a big fan of Bob Dylan’s songwriting and Wednesday’s set included two of Dylan’s best and most recent works, as well as that Cohen song and others from Cat Stevens and Prince, and a tune made famous by Dusty Springfield. Late in his set, Jones did a sizzling dance-rocker, a veritable club banger in “If I Only Could,” from the 1990s hip-hop band Rise Robot Rise.\n\nIn short, Jones was not just in fine voice, his impeccable taste in choosing tunes was evident, the night had some nice surprises, and Jones seemed to be enjoying it as much as the audience did.\n\n'Smitten from the start': Jon Hamm's charm carries shot-in-Cohasset 'Confess, Fletch'\n\nJones came out with a cane, wearing black pants and gold pullover, and perched himself on a stool. His five-piece backing band was smooth and efficient all night, and their arrangements really gave some of the oldest songs new life.\n\nJones sang his opening “I’m Growing Old” with just piano, a wistful ballad whose poignance was obvious. But then Dylan’s “Not Dark Yet,” a late-in-life proclamation of tenacity and purpose, and kind of a bluesy rumination in its original version, was transformed into a throbbing rocker by Jones and his band.\n\nAt its conclusion, Jones explained his cane and seated posture, noting he’d had his left hip replaced a few years ago and now had run into problems with his right hip while on the European portion of his tour. Advised to get his right hip replaced, Jones made a date for the surgery (Oct. 20), after this 20-date American tour.\n\nJones’ first big hit, 1965’s “It’s Not Unusual,” showcased the strength of his vocals, and the band turned it into sort of a samba with conga drums, accordion and acoustic guitar. The backing quintet favored an acoustic-centered approach all night and several songs also had that Latin flavor for a refreshing framework for the singer. Jones added the “whoa-whoa-whoa” howls at the end of his first hit and he may not have hit the highest notes as he did in 1965, but he was surely darned close.\n\nAn acoustic guitar-centered arrangement also worked well for “What’s New Pussycat?”, the Burt Bacharach tune that became another big hit. In Jones’ marvelously entertaining 2015 autobiography, “Over the Top and Back,” he notes that his initial impression was that it was a stupid song, and he told Bacharach, which might be why he never was offered another song from the masterful songsmith.\n\nMusic Scene: Weymouth's Jay Psaros returns to South Shore\n\n“The Windmills of Your Mind,” the Springfield hit, adapted just a little more grit in Jones’ rendition. But the bluesy smoldering that burst into a funky march for “Sex Bomb” really got the rhythms going – and that was when a 30-something woman ran down the front aisle and tossed a pair of panties onstage at the octogenarian sex symbol. It wasn’t the youngest crowd and many may have been buying Jones' records back in the ‘60s, but his effect on females is undiminished and squeals and randy suggestions were audible all night.\n\nNoting that his buddy Cat Stevens preferred folk and never wanted to be a pop music star, Jones admitted that was exactly his goal, making a cover of Stevens’ quirky but infectious “Popstar” extra engaging. Of course, the easy rolling country tones of “Green Green Grass of Home” got a huge response. But another Dylan song was even better, as “One More Cup Of Coffee,” with its mystical feel and tale involving a mysterious woman, fit Jones perfectly.\n\nTodd Snider’s “Talking Reality Television Blues” might be the most unlikely Jones cover. In that 2019 song, Snider (who played The Narrows Center last Saturday) uses TV as a metaphor for how we’ve lost contact with the world and each other, and ultimately reality. Jones and the band delivered it as a surreal shuffle with electro-rock rhythms as he intoned the lengthy lyrics, including a Michael Jackson reference (“reality killed that video star”). It becomes quite topical with lines like, “But one after another we pretended not to act, as we hurtled ever forward towards alternative facts ...”\n\nConcert review: Aerosmith jumps back in the saddle with 'fiery' show at Fenway Park\n\nThe Cohen song was another deft choice that seems made for Jones, a sort of look back at an artist’s life and struggle and relationships. The band shone again on “Delilah,” with Jones’ massive vocals carrying the day, of course, and the quintet with accordion and acoustic guitars performing it with the feel of a gypsy cabaret. After that Rise Robot Rise nugget, Prince’s “Kiss” and its elastic rhythms was a deft choice, where Jones once again proved he’s still a sizzling, flirtatious romantic lead.\n\n“One Hell of a Life” is another superb choice of song, a summing up, a bit spiritual, but mainly a feisty declaration that this senior citizen needs none of your pity. (It is not on the new album, but is available on a special bonus CD). As if to underline that very point, the muscular boogie-woogie romp “Strange Things Happening Every Day” amped up the energy again.\n\nJones introduced the final number by relating a tale when he and Elvis Presley, both having finished shows in Las Vegas, went out together to a Chuck Berry show. After Chuck had torn it up as usual, Presley leaned over to Jones and said, “That’s the real king of rock ‘n’ roll.”\n\nAs Wednesday night ended in a torrid charge through Berry’s “Johnny B. Goode,” you had to believe Tom Jones is still rock ‘n’ roll royalty too."
