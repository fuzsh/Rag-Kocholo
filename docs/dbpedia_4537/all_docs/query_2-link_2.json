        "text": "Jones has a fundamental interest in a wide range of music. Although he is well known for hits including It’s Not Unusual, Kiss, Delilah, What’s New Pussycat, I’ll Never Fall In Love Again and If I Only Knew, he is first and foremost an artist with a true rhythm and blues soul. He has remained a vital recording artist, with his 1999 album Reload the biggest selling (5m) of his then 35-year career. Tom was a key player in Martin Scorsese’s Red White & Blues series, and in 2004 released an album of roots rock n roll with Jools Holland. In 2008, 24 Hours, was a critical career highlight with many of the self-penned tracks being an insightful and evocative reflection of his spirited and rich life.\n\nTom was knighted by Her Majesty the Queen in 2006, an honour he deeply cherishes. An honour he was able to celebrate once again in 2012 when he performed at the Queens Diamond Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace. Other highlights of his long career include receiving a BRIT Awards for Best Male and Outstanding Contribution to Music, a Silver Clef Award and a Silver Clef Award for Lifetime Achievement, the Hitmaker Award from the [US] Songwriters Hall of Fame, GQ Man Of The Year, and the prestigious [UK] Music Industry Trust Award. He has been animated as himself in The Simpsons, Duck Dodgers, The Emperors New Groove; other film roles include Tim Burton’s Mars Attacks. In 2012 he landed his first acting role not playing himself, alongside Brenda Blethyn and Alison Steadman, in “Playhouse Presents: King of The Teds for Sky Arts.\n\nIn and amongst a very successful touring year in 2014, Tom had the thrill of performing at the MCG in Melbourne for the AFL Grand Final, the premier sporting event in Australia, alongside Ed Sheeran. Later in the year, he had the honour of appearing at Neil Young’s Bridge School Benefit concert, sharing the bill with Florence + The Machine, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Brian Wilson and others. And over in the UK, he was pleased to close the first Annual BBC Music Awards, helping to salute a fantastic year of music across the BBC by performing alongside Paloma Faith, a chorus of hundreds and the BBC Concert Orchestra.\n\nIn 2015, Sir Tom continued his role as Coach on The Voice UK, working alongside will.i.am, Rita Ora and Ricky Wilson. In February, a very special invitation was received to perform at the 25th Anniversary of MusiCares Person Of The Year tribute honouring Bob Dylan, alongside musical luminaries Bruce Springsteen, Beck, Jack White, Bonnie Raitt, Willie Nelson and many more. The following evening he performed at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. After a busy few months touring, Sir Tom released his first ever autobiography entitled Over The Top And Back (Penguin Books), and the book’s companion soundtrack entitled Long Lost Suitcase (VirginEMI/Caroline) which he actively promoted internationally. He also hosted and headlined a special 2-hour television event with his friends in music and comedy in a major fund-raising effort for the BBC’s charity Children In Need.\n\n2016 was a difficult but busy year of performing and touring for Sir Tom as he has laboured to work through the grief of losing his childhood friend and wife of 59 years, Melinda, in April. Tom and his band lifted performances to a different level, garnering rave reviews in Europe and America. A quick trip to Germany to perform with the stellar Helena Fischer finished the year on a positive note.\n\n2017 to present has seen the return of Sir Tom to prime time Saturday night TV, resuming his role of coach and mentor on ITV’s The Voice alongside fellow coaches will.i.am, Jennifer Hudson and Olly Murs. In 2017, Sir Tom helped to secure the runner-up position for Welsh duo Into The Ark; in 2018, Sir Tom’s finalist singer/songwriter Ruti Olajugbagbe went on to win the seventh series, with Ruti and Sir Tom’s delightful duet of Louis Armstrong’s ‘What a Wonderful World’ becoming a critical and popular highlight of the series. The summer months brought a sell out tour and rave reviews for Sir Tom and his band as they toured the US, UK & Europe, bringing his Voice finalists out on the road as show openers and special guests.\n\n2021, sees Sir Tom having recorded three hugely acclaimed albums with producer Ethan Johns (Laura Marling, Paolo Nutini, Kings Of Leon, Ray Lamontagne), Sir Tom was keen to continue what was already the longest musical association of his career. An avid record collector, there were songs he had set aside for decades, waiting to reach an age at which he would truly be able to do them justice.\n\nThis new collection is entitled…\n\nSurrounded By Time\n\n(Released 23rd April 2021)\n\nSir Tom is indeed a living legend, one of the few musical artists whose profession began at the dawn of modern popular music who continues to have a vital recording and performing career to this day. His irresistible show traverses musical eras and genres, cuts across class divides and appeals to young and old, male and female, mainstream and cutting edge. Sir Tom has always been about the power of the song, the power of the voice."
