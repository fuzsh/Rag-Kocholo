        "text": "To me this is sad and wrong Tom Jones a living Legend ,should of been 20 years ago ! Look at poor Donna Summer could not enjoy hers ! This is wrong Tom Jones is one of the best of all time !!!!\n\nPosted by Holmes on Wednesday, 05/22/2013 @ 15:38pm\n\nI think this is an outrage, Tom Jones has performed for almost 60 years and is still going strong, he has in my opinion the best voice ever and can sing anything and make it his own. It would be a travesty not to acknowledge his wonderful contribution to the music industry, he influenced so many people and Elvis and Frank Sinatra both hugely admired him. This is so unfair and very wrong that this true living legend has not been given the recognition he so rightly deserves. The hall of fame have shamelessly overlooked the most amazing singer of all time in my opinion\n\nPosted by cathy mcphail on Saturday, 11/2/2019 @ 03:21am\n\nTom Jones is a living music legend. He has absolutely one of the greatest voices in rock history and he's one of the greatest stage performers ever. A respected peer a of Elvis and the Beatles should not be overlooked. He has soul, and has amazing longevity. He is beyond qualified to be inducted. Let's not wait until he passes, that would be a shame. Please bring him in. Thank you.\n\nPosted by Joe Barnett on Friday, 06/24/2022 @ 00:55am\n\nTom Jones needs to be honored with the distinction of being in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nThere's no need to name all of his accomplishments as his lifetime achievement speaks for itself. As an artist enjoying a second lifetime career not many artists have achieved this type career.\n\nPosted by Sadie on Thursday, 08/18/2022 @ 16:48pm\n\nI think it is with utter disrespect that the hall of rock and roll still continues not to include Sir Tom entry. He is by far in the top 10 singers of all time and he is still touring and sounding great at the age of 82 that in itself should make the hall do the right thing and roll out the carpet for Tom. He sang with most of the greats of rock and roll in the sixties and held his own show for 3 seasons (69 shows on ABC) I think on the fact alone that when him and Elvis were both hosting shows in Vegas they made sure they were not performing at the same time so they could both attend each others concerts they became . If the King thought that highly of Tom as a performer and friend, Then my personal opinion is if Elvis held Tom in such high regard then the hall should hang their head in shame for not including Sir Tom entry.\n\nPosted by Alan on Sunday, 12/11/2022 @ 15:30pm\n\nTom Jones is a living legend. His talent alone is enough for induction. He can sing anything and does. Just listen to his version of \"Kiss\" by Prince. His respect and love for rock is what got him started 60 years ago. Mention his name and people light up and sing one of his songs. It's a Lady is absolutely a driving rock tune. No one compares for the voice and the stage persona. Please induct him and soon so he can enjoy it. He's still touring! Please fix this!\n\nPosted by Cathy Sawyer on Wednesday, 05/17/2023 @ 15:22pm\n\nHis voice is iconic! Songs are timeless. No male singer exists like him, today! Beautiful music from this legend. That is why the Voice UK keeps him as a judge. He is incredible, humble, and charming.\n\nI was introduced to his music by my Mother. I love classic rock and roll. Neil Young, Eric Clapton, Queen, Journey, etc but he has THAT voice you never forget and never guess who is singing. He belongs in the R & R Hall of Fame.\n\nPosted by Kellie Claudio on Friday, 08/25/2023 @ 21:06pm\n\nAfter seeing who I have seen inducted into the Hall of Fame, I can't understand why Tom Jones has not been inducted. His voice is electrifying and so strong, even at 80! Give him the pleasure before he dies and never has the opportunity to enjoy such an honor.\n\nPosted by Fredia Gosser on Monday, 10/23/2023 @ 10:29am\n\nThis man is a gift to music. My Mom wld often watch his show every week - with high anticipation. Basically he was Elvis even before there was an Elvis. Booming, soulful voice - from a place by the name of Wales no less. Yes you cant vote every artist into the Hall, but his many fans aside, what artist (both past and present) would seriously vote against him??? Simply unbelievable he's not already voted in.\n\nPosted by Terry Lane on Wednesday, 11/22/2023 @ 18:38pm\n\nI have watched Tom Jones since the 60's. He has sung Rock, Soul, R&b, Country & classics, more often better than the originals. His singing style, rhythm, emotional voice and entertaining value is second to none. Over 50 years of entertaining, 3 TV seasons, a sensation around the world yet still shunned by the Hall of Fame. Correct this insult and make him a member while he can still enjoy it.\n\nPosted by Michael Borth on Monday, 02/5/2024 @ 12:22pm\n\nIf Sir Tom Jones doesn't deserve to be in the R&R Hall of Fame, then no one does. None of the inductees has a more powerful, emotion evoking, flexible, awe inspiring voice than Tom...NONE...In addition he is kind and friendly to his devoted fans, many of whom have been with him since 1965. It is a travesty that he is 83 and still touring all over the world with his voice intact, and still no induction. He can sing any genre, including rock and roll, duet with any other singer and outshine them vocslly. SO UNFAIR and makes me wonder what is WRONG with people who decide on the nominees. It makes me so sad for this unbelievably talented singer and performer. NOMINATE him!!!!!\n\nPosted by Angela Wall on Wednesday, 04/24/2024 @ 08:01am"
