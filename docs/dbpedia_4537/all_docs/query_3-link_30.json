        "text": "Sir Thomas Jones Woodward OBE (born 7 June 1940) is a Welsh singer. His career began with a string of top 10 hits in the 1960s and he has since toured regularly, with appearances in Las Vegas from 1967 to 2011. His voice has been described by AllMusic as a \"full-throated, robust baritone\".\n\nBiography[]\n\nJones's performing range has included pop, R&B, show tunes, country, dance, soul, and gospel. In 2008, the New York Times called him a \"musical shapeshifter [who could] slide from soulful rasp to pop croon, with a voice as husky as it was pretty\". He has sold over 100 million records, with 36 Top 40 hits in the UK and 19 in the US, including \"It's Not Unusual\", \"What's New Pussycat?\", the theme song for the James Bond film Thunderball (1965), \"Green, Green Grass of Home\", \"Delilah\", \"She's a Lady\", \"Sex Bomb\", and a cover of Prince's \"Kiss\".\n\nJones has also occasionally dabbled in acting, first making his debut in the lead role of the television film Pleasure Cove (1979). He also appeared as himself in Tim Burton's film Mars Attacks! (1996). In 1970, he received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor â€“ Television Series Musical or Comedy nomination for hosting the television series This Is Tom Jones. In 2012, he played his first dramatic acting role in an episode of Playhouse Presents. He received a Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1966, an MTV Video Music Award in 1989, and two Brit Awards: Best British Male in 2000 and Outstanding Contribution to Music in 2003. He received an OBE in 1998 and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2006 for services to music.\n\nAdvising[]"
