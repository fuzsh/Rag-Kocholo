1 Introduction Uebrigens ist das Ostjakische eine arme und leicht zu erlernende Sprache... 1

This book took a rather - some people who knew that it was in the making over the past years would say unduly - long time to write. Saying that it was begun in one century and finished in another one may be regarded as a cheap witticism, but I overstrained so many persons' patience in the extreme in coping with this compilation for so long that this meaningless calendar accidence may indeed be mentioned as a symbolic - and thus not entirely meaningless - circumstance. I owe my first contact with the Ket language to Heinrich Werner, who is without the shadow of a doubt the best connoisseur of Ket, Yugh, and virtually anything Yeniseic in two centuries. The author of a truly impressive number of works, among them a full-scale grammar of Ket, which is still the best. No reader of this book should fail to consult it. The Ket language has still many features to offer, which are at best marginally understood, and, doubtlessly, professional linguists will be able to produce a theoretically more interesting and adequate description of Ket even on the basis of the data presented in this book, than I have been able to. Back in late 1998, Heinrich Werner introduced me to the splendid person and exceptionally gifted language informant, Zoja Vasil'evna Maksunova, born in Pakulikha, with whom I spent innumerable hours recording and analyzing the first stretches of spoken Ket I was exposed to. With the invaluable help of Frederik Kortlandt and George van Driem, the year 1999 marked the beginning of a project, sponsored by the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, which gave me the unique opportunity to conduct on-site fieldwork on the shores of the Yenisei and also, not least, to enjoy the wonderfully inspiring working conditions of the Afdeling Vergelijkende Taalwetenschappen of the venerable Rijksuniversiteit in Leiden. I was allotted three years for the task, and now that I write the last words of this preface, more than seven years have passed since that moment. I have no choice but to offer my sincere apologies to the host of people I had kept waiting for so long. Some of the people to whom I owe more than the average amount of gratitude have already been mentioned. I do it again: Heinrich Werner (Bonn), Edward Vajda (Bellingham/Washington), ZojaVasil'evna Maksunova (Baklanikha/Tomsk), Elizaveta Kotorova (Tomsk) for her indefatigable energy and providing ideal working conditions both in here laboratorium and her home in Tomsk, Frederik Kortlandt, George van Driem, Uwe Bläsing, Petri Kallio (all Leiden), Uwe Seefloth (Bonn), Ol'ga Andreevna Osipova, Ekaterina Klopotova, Svetlana Stepanova, Elena Krjukova, Aleksandra Kim (all Tomsk), Ursula Marmé (Bonn). 1

A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF KET

A particular bouquet of thanks is due to Alexander Vovin (Honolulu), who painstakingly read several drafts of this grammar and offered so many observations, corrections and general advice that I will forever remain in his debt - thanks, Sasha, and sorry for sometimes being so stubborn... Another person whom I have to single out is Natalija Michajlovna Gri«ina (Novosibirsk), a seasoned fieldworker, the world's foremost specialist in the field of Ket syntax and the only Ketologist who can claim to be a student of both Andrej P. Dul'zon and of E. A. Krejnovich, who introduced our tiny expedition of 2001 to the village of Kellog on the river Eloguj. Without her invaluable help even thinking of working in this out-of-the-way place would have been absolutely impossible. Her great expertise in the field, her life-long devotion to Yeniseic studies, her truly stunning (active !) command of the Ket language and her enthusiasm and unstinting energy made this field trip an unforgettable experience. During the process of writing this grammar, three field-trips have been undertaken by the author, in 1999, 2000, and 2001, to settlements on the Lower Yenisei, where the language still can be heard spoken (the Central and Southern Ket varieties, respectively, no field-trip to villages with Northern Ket speaking people having been possible for me). The data gathered on these expeditions constitute the basis of the analysis, but, naturally, the impressive body of Ket scholarship was also intensively used, both as a source of inspiration and enlightenment on intricate structures of the language, and also as a source of actual examples. The actual analysis of Ket linguistic phenomena is also indebted greatly to its predecessors, among whom A.P. Dul'zon, E.A. Krejnovi‰, the pioneers of 20th century Ketology, but, above all, H. Werner have to be singled out. During the last years, E. Vajda of Western Washington University was able to unveil many secrets of Ket synchronic grammar, especially in the domains of phonology, and, the greatest secret of them all - verbal morphology. I view his analysis of Ket verbal morphology as the most important breakthrough in Ketology to-date and my description of it is heavily indebted to his achievements. My sincere thanks go to Edward Vajda for his profound help, his willingness to share his ideas (and his unpublished writings) with me and, not a mean feat, to provide me with more than just a few hard-to-find items of Yeniseiological literature. His ability to track down the most arcane items of literature, in Russia and around the world, documented in his magisterial book "Yeniseic peoples and Languages" (Vajda 2001) is nothing short of breathtaking, and I am also happy to point out that my understanding of, i.a., the Ket verb owes a great deal to Edward Vajda.

THE KETS AND THEIR LANGUAGE

2 The Kets and their language 2.1

Avant-propos: The name of the language

Linguists and specialists on Siberia are generally familiar with the name Ket, which designates a small ethnic group on the Yenisei and their language (in Russian Кåòû, êåòñêèé ÿçûê). Most observers will also know that this language was "formerly" called Yenisei-Ostyak (Jenissej-Ostjakisch). There is nothing wrong with this, but some confusion exists surrounding these names, and they deserve a short excursus. The origin of the term Ostyak has not been elucidated with final certainty. Since the XVIth century A.D. it has been used for a variety of ethnic groups in Western and Central Siberia, most consistently for the Finno-Ugric group which is nowadays officially referred to as Khanty (Chanty), whose language forms together with Vogul (or Man'si) the Ob'-Ugric subbranch of the Ugric (together with Hungarian) branch of the Finno-Ugric family of languages. The first attestation of this name2 is found in a letter written by Czar Ivan IV. ("The Terrible"), dated August 6, 1572. This mention is, of course, ethnographically vague and we learn from it only that "Ostyaks" were at that time neighbours of (Finno-Ugric) Cheremis (later known as Mari) and (Turkic) Bashkirs. The military events mentioned in this source (a "native" uprising) took place to the West of the Ural Mountains, in the vicinity of the Kama River. Other sources from the 16th century mention "Ostyaks" already to the East of the Urals, as neighbours of the Voguls (some sources use this name for groups which are clearly Voguls/Man'si, too). With the stabilization of Russian power in the Transuralian region, the name gets increasingly confined to the ethnic group which is generally known as the "Ostyaks proper", i.e. the Ob'-Ugric Khanty. However, as Russian explorations continue to advance to the East, several other indigenous groups are repeatedly referred to as "Ostyaks" - obviously based on rather loose similarities of outward appearance and material culture -, most notably the "Ostyak Samoyeds", for which since the 1930s the self-designation Sel'kups is generally used, and, finally, the "Yenisei Ostyaks". "Ostyaks" on the left bank of the river Yenisei, who cannot have been Ob'-Ugric Khanty, begin to be mentioned in Russian archival sources in the first decade of the XVIIth century A.D. The traveller and botanist D.G. Messerschmidt, who is the first person to report Yeniseic words in print, met "Ostyaks" (i.e. Kets) on the shores of the Bakhta River on June 9, 1723. As for the etymology of this name, several hypotheses have been proposed. Though not entirely without problems, the explanation first put forward by Julius Klaproth may be quite close to the truth: according to him, ƒs-jax may be regarded as the plural of Khanty (i.e. "Ostyak proper") ƒs-xo "person (xo) from the river Ob' (ƒs). The alternative theory (due to Fischer, "Sibirische Geschichte", 1768, and often repeated thereafter) holds that the name is of Turkic origin and belongs to the xenonym used by the (Turkic) Kazaks for the (Turkic) Bashkirs, istäk/i«täk. The 2

A thorough and rich discussion of the origin and variegated usage of this name is found in Van Gennep (KSz 3, 13-32): Origine et fortune du nom de peuple "Ostiak".

12

A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF KET

main problem with this is the fact that the Turkic term is without any convincing inner-Turkic etymology, and thus best regarded as, in turn, of Ob'-Ugric/Khanty origin3. Ever since Messerschmidt, most notably in the mid-19th century works of Matthias Alexander (Matias Aleksanteri) Castrén, Kets (and Yughs) have consistently been referred to as Yenisei-Ostyaks; only in the 20th century, Bogoraz, Dolgich and Donner began to introduce the name Ket (< ke¿d "person, human being") into the scholarly literature. Soviet ethnic and linguistic policy from the 1930s onward demanded the usage of ethnonyms based on self-designations rather than "´traditional" names, some of which were and are regarded as derogatory, so ever since the publication of the collective volume Jazyki i pis'mennost' narodov Severa III ("Languages and Literature of the Peoples of the North", Leningrad 1934) Ket is the official name of this ethnic group and its language (always including the Yugh ethnos and its language, which is most often called "Sym Ket", s.b.). A note on Ketó, used in the earlier literature4, and heavily criticized by, i.a. Bouda (1957): This is indeed the vocative form (cf. 4.1.1.3.12) of ke¿d "human being, Mensch", as correctly observed by Bouda, and, thus, athetized by him not without reason. However, when speaking Russian, this term is used by speakers of the language to the present day ("Ja po nacional'nosti Keto")5. Complying with current scholarly practice, which is in general use now for more than 60 years, we will continue to speak of Kets and the Ket language. However, because of the fact that, contrary to what linguists and anthropologists may think to be "correct", speakers still use the term "Ostyak" to refer to themselves and their language, this name surfaces in the title of this grammar. We will also use it in glosses, when we will have to translate the native term o`st⁄k and its inflected forms, thus: (1)

!k o`st⁄kan-bes k[u]8-asqan7-sa? you Ostyak-PROS 2-speak-R Do you speak (Yenisei)-Ostyak? An apparently older, well-attested, though nowadays less used self-designation of the Kets (and also used by the Yughs) is

k™´nasked, PL k™´nade~ (Yugh k™´nasked, PL k™´nde~). Its literal translation is "bright/light-coloured (k™¿n) person (ke¿d, PL de¿~)". The common Ket exonym for the Russians is sometimes said to contain the same etymon: k⁄´ns, PL k⁄´sn (< *k⁄´nsin), but it seems difficult to reconcile the aberrant 3

Though I remain to be fully convinced, I have to mention Steinitz 1963, who advances some important reasons against the Ob'-Ugric and in favour of the Turkic theory, which are difficult to brush away, without, however, solving the Inner-Turkic parts of the problem. 4 Mostly in the works of Findeisen. 5 It is also the regular designation found in Soviet passports, which mentioned the "nationality" (= officially acknowledged ethnic group) of an individual as the infamous "point five (pjatyj punkt)" until recently.

THE KETS AND THEIR LANGUAGE

vocalism with that of k™¿n, let alone the unlikeliness of an autonym and the exonym for the most dominant ethnic group in Ket territories both basically meaning "lightcoloured people". It seems, thus, safer to view "evil spirit", an independently attested meaning of k⁄´ns, as the origin of this ethnonym. Other neighbouring groups of the Kets and Yughs are/were known to them by the following names (given together with the respective designations for Kets/Yughs in their languages): Ket/Yugh (Y) names for the: Their names for Kets/Yughs (Y): Yugh Sel'kup Nenets Enets Khanty Ewenki

Some explanations:

jùk, j!k The Ket designation for the Yughs; from the Yugh autonym d'ùk. la¿k

The Ket name for the Sel'kups (a.k.a. Ostyak-Samoyeds) < Sel'kup l'aqqa (Lit. Sel'k. ëÿ´a ) "friend". Kets and Sel'kups have been living in close contact (including mutual exogamy) for generations.

d™´(j)kid, PL d™´(j)de~ The Ket name for the Nenets (a.k.a. Yurak-Samoyeds). No etymology known for the first syllable (the second syllable is obviously = ke¿d , pl. de¿~ "human"). k™´le~

(PL); Less commonly used Ket name for the Nenets, from Sel'kup qäl⁄k, obviously with a Ket pluralizer -~. The Ket name for the Khanty (or "Ostyak proper"). This name is also used by the Sel'kups, and may be from this language - where it could be etymologically connected with the noun la~a "ide (fish)".

It is not entirely clear to the present writer, whether the (early) Kets differentiated between the Nenets and the Enets, so chances are that the name d™´(j)kid was used for the Enets (= Yenisei-Samoyed) as well; Alekseenko (1967, 6) expresses the same opinion..

14

A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF KET

h™´mban, h™´mkan The Ket name for the (Tungus) Ewenki. The Yugh equivalent is f™´mban, allowing a "Yenisei-Ostyakic" reconstruct *ph™mb™, which also occurs in Sel'kup (pompa~); the direction of borrowing is not clear. t⁄´sde~

(PL); less commonly used Ket name for the Ewenki. Literally "stone people" < t⁄¿s "stone" + de¿~, because (some groups of) Ewenks live on the Podkamennaja ("Stony") Tunguska.

t⁄´rked, PL t⁄´rde~ Yugh name for the Kets, lit. "people from down the river", Yugh t⁄r "downriver", cf. Ket t˜, t⁄´ka "downriver (directional adverb)". This name is part of a naming pattern, which is also represented by Ket útaked, PL útade~, Yugh (PL) údde~ "people from up the river", cf. Ket úta "upriver". qƒni"q The Sel'kup name for the Kets (sometimes given as konak/kon™~ or the like in the literature). No convincing etymology is known, the assonance of Sel'kup qani"k "shore, bank" seems to invite a comparison, but it remains insecure (the root vowel in this appellative is consistently short). According to Alekseenko (1967, 6), this name may reflect a Ket clan name Qoni~.

kungop Sel'kup designation of the Yughs (only historically attested); Werner's speculation (2002, 451; < Ket. k™¿n (s.a.) + sel'k. qup "human, person") seems to be a possible explanation. jŒnśa- »a¢bi The Nenets designation of the Kets (Lit.: Eíçÿ’ õàáè"). »a¢bi is the Nenets name for the Khanty (Ostyaks), the (probably) original meaning of which is "slave, serf, subject"; it is generally used for all (indigenous) neighbours of the Nenets, usually with a clarifying element preposed (syja' »a¢bi = Man'si/Vogul, tasu' »a¢bi = Sel'kup7); here, this element is the Nenets name for the river Yenisei8. Thus, this Nenets exonym provides an exact parallel to "Yenisei-Ostyak". Since Russian contact with the Nenets predates that with most other aboriginal Siberian ethnic groups (save the Ob'-Ugrians and Siberian Tatars), this may well be also, by way of loan translation, the actual origin of this name.

7

Cf. the river name Taz, the main habitat of the Sel'kups. Actually, this Nenets name is in all probability the origin of Russian Yenisey, hence of all designations of this river in other European languages. Together with Enets d'edos´i' and Nganasan d'ent™d'i™ it can go back to Proto-Samoyedic *Jent™sV, which, in turn, could be an early loan from Tungusic *j™nd™si < *j™n™, cf. Ewenki j™nd(r)™gi "big river" ( Anikin 1997, 207). 8

THE KETS AND THEIR LANGUAGE

15

bág(g)o Possible Enets name for the Ket. It is clear that the Enets use(d) this name for the Khanty/Ostyaks. Since Kets were often mixed up with these Ob'Ugrians by their neighbours, this designation may (have) include(d) the Kets as well. Etymologically, it is identical with Enets bágo "pit", thus Ostyaks are "pit-dwellers" for the Enets, which squares well with historically attested dwelling-habits of the Kets, too9. d'andri

Ewenki (Sym dialect) designation of Western neighbours (Sel'kup, Khanty, Ket), etymologically obscure; it may be a rendering of Ket de¿~ "people".

d'ukul, d'ukun(dri) Ewenki name for the Elogui Kets. Though this name is folk-etymologically equated with Ewenki d'ukun "otter", it is rather an adaptation of the selfdesignation of the Yughs (later transferred to the Kets). n'umn'akan Also n'u~n'aki, Ewenki designation of the Kets, probably identical with Ewenki n'u~n'aki "goose". A Khanty/Ostyak designation for the Kets/Yughs has not been found by the present author. The similarity of the (modern) ethnonym Ket and the river name Ket' (a right tributary of the Ob', where Yeniseic tribes are attested historically, today part of Sel'kup territory) is in all probability fortuitous, as is the vague similarity with the name of the Kotts (see below). Sources, which refer to the Yughs as "Sym-Kets" routinely use the designation Imbat-Kets for what we and others call simply Kets. This name appears very early in Russian sources, and it is mostly taken for granted that it was originally a tribal name/autonym of at least some Ket groups, especially of those on the river Elogui, the etymology of which remains, however, obscure. It may, on the other hand, simply be another river name, since some maps (cf. Alekseenko 1967, 4) show two small rivulets by the name of Verkhnij ("upper") and Nizhnij ("lower") Imbat, respectively10. The small town of Verkhneimbatsk(oe) is situated at the confluence of the former with the Yenisei (directly opposite that of the Elogui). It remains unclear, however, whether these rather insignificant rivers may have been named secondarily after the settlement (which, then, owes its name to the ethnonym Imbat), or whether the actual course of naming-events took the opposite direction. A river-name Imbat , on the other hand, seems to be conspicuously absent from earlier sources.

9

Cf. Ket b á ~ ~ u s "semi-subterraneous dwelling"; the superficial resemblance of this compound (< ba¿~ "earth" + qu¿s "tent") with the Enets word is certainly fortuitous (Enets < Proto-Samoyedic *wå~k™ < Proto-Uralic *wo~ke/a, cf. Finnish onka- lo). 10 Ket and non-Ket residents of Verkhneimbatsk confirmed this in conversation with the author.

2.2

A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF KET

The Yeniseic family of languages

Ket is a member of the Yeniseic language family, consisting of Ket, Yugh (which has for a long time been viewed and described as a Ket dialect, Sym-Ket ), Kott, Arin, Assan , and Pumpokol. All Yeniseic languages save Ket are now definitely extinct, and, apart from well-described Yugh and reasonably well-attested Kott, fragmentary word-lists constitute our whole knowledge about them11. In the following sections, the most important data on the location, time of extinction, and available data are given for the extinct members of the family. It must be mentioned that the documented history of Yeniseic may actually be much older. Though at present (and very probably for good) lacking a decisive and final proof, the theory that (atleast one of the languages of the) Xiongnu confederation, which ruled the Central Asian steppes and Northern China in the centuries around the turn of the Christian Era, might have been Yeniseic (or, to use a more conservative formulation: did contain some Yeniseic elements) continues to be discussed in the field. The most substantial contributions to this field are those by Ligeti (1950), Pulleyblank (1962) and recently Vovin (2000, 2002). We might also mention our own idea that the well-known Turkic/Mongolic religious term tengri ("sky, God") may have a Yeniseic etymology (Georg 2001). 2.2.1 Yugh Since Castrén's times, the Yugh language was mostly, and sometimes continues to be, referred to as the Sym dialect of Ket (symskij dialekt ketskogo jazyka), after the river Sym , where its last speakers lived. Throughout the 20th century, it was the southernmost language of the Yeniseic family. Apart from (Imbat-) Ket, the object of this grammar, Yugh is the best known of all Yeniseic languages; already the first coherent treatment of any Yeniseic language, Castrén 1858, was, though principally pan-dialectal, heavily based on data from Yugh. The question, whether Yugh should be regarded as a sister language of Ket, or as a mere dialect of it, is of little theoretical importance. Suffice it to say that both languages/variants are closer to each other within the family, than either is to any of the other extinct languages, that their genetic relationship is obvious in every subsystem, but that the last living speakers reported mutual unintelligibility with (Imbat) Ket, and that their differences, again in all subsystems, certainly warrant a separate treatment. Yugh data will thus not be discussed in this grammar. While the earlier literature (especially Dul'zon 1968) treated both variants/languages promiscue, an in-depth study of Yugh in its own right is Werner 1997c. The name Yugh is unexplained (Ket jùk/j!k, Yugh d'uk); it should be mentioned, though, that initial /j-/ is not normally found in native Yeniseian words.

11

As I write the last lines of this volume, I receive Werner 2005, a definite statement of all remnants of Yeniseic languages of the XVIIIth century, with full descriptions of all available data, exhaustive glossaries and some new discoveries and corrections to earlier treatments.

THE KETS AND THEIR LANGUAGE

2.2.2

17

Kott

The first and last linguist, who worked on the Kott language with native informants was M.A. Castrén, who found a small settlement on the river Kan' (East of Krasnoyarsk), which was already at that time home to only five Kott individuals, who may have been the last speakers of this language. Kott was also spoken, in the XVIIth century A.D., along the river Biryusa (a right tributary of the Yenisei), and, possibly, on the Abakan (in Khakassia), the Mrass and the Kondoma (the latter two are tributaries of the river Tom' which in turn flows to the Ob' in the West); Kott may thus be a substratum language for the Turkic language Shor, which is spoken in this region. Toponymic evidence (hydronyms containing the element -«et/-‰et, cf. Kott «et "river") indicates that Kott settlements extended in the East into the Western parts of the Irkutskaya Oblast' and in the West until the river Tom'. The Kyshtym language, for which Strahlenberg 1730 records 30 words, was a variant of Kott, probably its southernmost variant. The self-designation of the Kotts has been recorded as Kottuen12. This name may, however, be originally a foreign exonym, cf. Buryat xoton "settlement", Written Mongolian qota(n) "id., city", a term used by Mongolic tribes for non-nomadizing neighbours13. It is also recorded as the autonym of the Assan (s.b.), whereas the Arin called the Kott "Assan". Apart from Ket and Yugh, Kott is the only Yeniseic language for which any information beyond mere word-lists is available. Kott words have been recorded by 18th century travellers Messerschmidt, Miller and Fischer (s.b.), and have been noted in the comparative dictionaries published by Pallas (1786) and Klaproth (1823). M.A. Castrén compiled a full description of Kott phonology and morphology, as well as a fairly extensive vocabulary, which constitute the main corpus of available Kott data. On the basis of these data, Werner published two monographs on Kott (1990, 1997a), which summarize all known linguistic facts about the language14. Both Castrén's data and those found in 18th century sources show internal differences which indicate the existence of two Kott dialects; though some of the observable variants may be due to imperfect transcription only, Werner (1997a, 6f.) treats them as "Kott A" and "Kott B", respectively15. However, no continuous texts and hardly any complete sentences in the Kott language have ever been recorded. 2.2.3

Assan

The status of Assan as an independent Yeniseic language is not entirely clear. The linguistic differences between Kott and data said to represent the "Assan" language 12

There seems to be no linguistic reason, which justifies the geminate in this name. Even if this speculation be wrong, it deserves to be mentioned that the superficial resemblance of Ket and Kott is only fortuitous. 14 Werner 1990 contains a full Russian-Kott glossary. 15 A note for users of Castrén 1858: Castrén is not consistent about this, but it seems that he marked "Kott B" forms by an asterisk. 13

18

A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF KET

(only from the 18th century) are indeed mostly slight, so that at least a "Kott-Assan" subgroup of Yeniseic can be postulated. Assan was spoken along the rivers Ona (a.k.a. Biryusa) and Usolka, to the North of the Kan' (i.e. in the immediate Northern vicinity of Kott). Available data are sparse, they are found in the materials of Fischer (24 words) and Miller (298 words). Georgi reports 10-12 Assan families on the Usolka in the mid-18th century, whereas Gmelin found, in the 1730s, only three individuals fluent in Assan (Werner 1997c, 7). 2.2.4 Arin Arin was spoken on both sides of the Yenisei (but mostly on its left shore) from Krasnoyarsk in the South to Enisejsk in the North. Toponymy suggests (hydronyms in -set/-sat, cf. Arin sat "river") that, in pre-contact times, Arin may have been present as far West as the river Ob'. It died out in the 18th century, but some lexical data are preserved in the materials of Strahlenberg, Miller and Fischer (also incorporated in Klaproth's and Pallas' compilations), altogether ca. 400 lexical items. The autonym of the Arin was probably Ar , or Ara , which, in turn, is also found in Khanty/Ostyak folklore sources (ar-jƒx "Ar people") as the designation of some otherwise unidentified Eastern neighbour population of theirs in the territories, which are characterized by Arin hydronyms. All available Arin data from earlier sources have been collected and analyzed by Toporov (1968), to which a sizable list of words (including a few finite verbs) found by Chelimskij in a Moscow archive (Chelimskij 1986) has to be added. 2.2.5 Pumpokol "Pumpokol" is originally a geographic name, i.e. that of a town and a (former) district on the upper course of the river Ket (Northwest of Krasnoyarsk)16. In the 18th century, the population of this district was mixed (the crucial fact being that there were also Yughs on the river Ket, who later moved eastward). The available data labelled "Pumpokol" are only few (appx. 65 words), and some items have been identified as Yugh, rather than "Pumpokol" (cf. Verner 1979, Werner 2005). However, the remaining data seem to justify the existence of a Yeniseic language in this region, which was not identical with Yugh or any other known member of the family. 2.2.6 Yeniseic as a language family The genetic unity and the external delimitations of the Yeniseic family have never been in doubt. Comparative issues will only marginally be touched upon in this grammar; however, the following short list of some words (commonly believed to

The internal classification of Yeniseic is still provisional, though the particular closeness of Ket and Yugh on the one hand, and that of Kott and Assan on the other hand, are clear enough. Arin seems to be closer to the Kott-Assan ("Southern") group, whereas Pumpokol has been assigned to both; a tentative classification can thus be given as:

Proto-Yeniseic

Northern Yeniseic ? "Yenisei-Ostyakic"

Ket

Southern Yeniseic ? Pumpokol

Yugh

"Assanic"

Kott

2.2.7. External genetic relationships of Yeniseic None. Of course, throughout the history of Yeniseic studies, scholars have compared Ket and its relatives with a great number of Eurasian and at times even North American languages, sometimes merely in terms of typology, but very often also in order to show these languages to be genetically related. Repeatedly, Chinese/Sino-Tibetan, North Caucasian languages, Basque, Burushaski, and even Athabaskan (or then "Na-

Dene", sometimes including, sometimes excluding Haida) have been claimed as relatives of Yeniseic. Less often, Sumerian, Indo-European, Kartvelian, so-called "Nostratic", and other Old World language families have been compared with Yeniseic. None of these attempts can at present be viewed as successful (many of them are seriously misguided and palpably wrong) and therefore Yeniseic (and now effectively Ket) is to be regarded as a language isolate with no known relatives among living and dead languages and language families of the world. 2.3 The Kets and their language 2.3.1 The homeland of the Kets Ket is still spoken in a number of settlements on or near the lower reaches of the Yenisei between Sym18 in the South and Maduyka in the North (see the table in 2.3.4, which enumerates all villages/towns with Ket inhabitants, and the map in 2.3.3). The present-day Ket villages are mostly situated directly on the shore of the river Yenisei or one of its tributaries. Houses are wooden log cabins without running water. Usually, diesel-generators provide electricity for most of the day. No village in the region is connected to any kind of road-system, the only means of long-range transport being the Yenisei with its long-distance passenger ships plying between Krasnoyarsk and Dudinka, and (somewhat) regular helicopter services bringing provisions and medical aid. Most villages are not connected to overland telephone lines. The Ket region is mostly covered by taiga (dense forest), which gradually gives way to the North Siberian tundra in the North (Kellog is in a zone which is usually described as lesotundra "forest-tundra"). The climate is extremely continental, with short, hot and mosquito-infested summers (30°C+ in July) and long, dark and cold winters (- 50°C are common in January). 2.3.2 Ket dialects Currently three major dialects are recognized in Ket proper, which are referred to by their relative geographical distribution: Southern, Central, and Northern Ket (many earlier works, however, treat the Yugh language as a Ket dialect and consequently speak about Sym-Ket = Yugh and Imbat-Ket = Ket proper). 2.3.2.1 Southern Ket This is the most vital Ket dialect, spoken in the villages Sym, Zotino, Vorogovo, Bor, Sulomai19, Sumarokovo, Bakhta, Kellog, Verkhneimbatsk, and Kangatovo. 18

Despite this name, only Imbat Ket is spoken in this settlement, "Sym Ket" (= Yugh) is completely extinct. 19 The Sulomai dialect was intensively studied by E.A. Krejnovich; the author learned in 2001 that this settlement on the Podkamennaya Tunguska was recently, obviously due to the heavy floods which struck the area in that year, abandoned and its inhabitants moved to Podkamennaya Tunguska (a village by the same name, located at the estuary of this river).

THE KETS AND THEIR LANGUAGE

21

The overall number of ethnic Kets (which, of course, does not necessarily coincide with the number of fluent speakers of the language) in these settlements is appx. 500. Southern Ket forms the basis of the newly introduced orthography and written language, now used sporadically in Ket schools, including settlements where other dialects are spoken. The author visited the Southern Ket settlements Kellog and Verkhneimbatsk in 2001. Kellog is one of the few places, where a spontaneous conversation in Ket may occasionally be overheard in the streets (reportedly, Maduyka in the North is another such place). 2.3.2.2 Central Ket Central Ket is spoken in the settlements Surgutikha, Vereshchagino, and Baklanikha (theoretically by app. 140 ethnic Kets). Formerly, the now abandoned settlement of Pakulikha was its main centre, whence it is mostly referred to as the Pakulikha dialect (pakulikhinskij govor) in the specialist literature. Everyday use of Ket is much less vigorous in the Central Ket area than in the South. Central Ket differs from Southern Ket chiefly in some phonological details. Thus, i.a., CK preserves intervocalic /d / as [d], whereas SK uses a flap [|] in these positions. The author of this grammar conducted informant-work in the Central Ket settlements of Baklanikha and Vereshchagino in 1999 and 2000. 2.3.2.3 Northern Ket Ket speakers have reached the settlements where Northern Ket is spoken only in post-contact times. The Northern Ket settlements are Kostino, Staryj Turukhansk, Turukhansk, Goroshikha, Svetlogorsk, Maduyka, and Kureyka, where Ket is used by theoretically approximately 170 ethnic Kets . Maduyka shares with Kellog in the south the distinction of being one of two settlements with more than 60% ethnic Kets; reportedly, the use of Ket is still relatively vigorous there. Most Ket speakers in Maduyka are descendants of Southern Ket speakers, but other varieties seem to be historically present as well. Given the fact that the Northern settlements had not been reached by Ket speakers by contact time, the difficulties with a proper definition of Northern Ket dialect features may be largely due to the fact that the Northern varieties are mixed dialects, or, in other words, the result of endohybridization, which arose through intensive contact between southern and central Ket speakers in a colonisation context (for a thorough argumentation that this is the case cf. Denning 1984, who demonstrates that especially Northern Ket phonology clearly shows a mixed character). In the meantime, a new settlement, Novyj Sulomaj was founded in the vicinity of the old village (Andrej Nefedov, p.c.).

22

A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF KET

Because of these difficulties, and because the author did not have the opportunity to work with Northern Ket speakers, data from this dialect will play no central role in this grammar. 2.3.3 Map of the Ket area

The "Yenisei Ostyaks" of the Symsko-Kasov-Tribe were speakers of the Yugh language (Sym-Ket ); later Soviet censuses did not differentiate these from Ket speakers. The decline of Yugh is obvious, and by the time of the late 1980s the last speakers of this language had died in Vorogovo and Yartsevo.

On the whole, the number of individuals claiming Ket ethnicity for themselves seems to be remarkably stable, but the language retention rate is decreasing rapidly. This observation is considerably strengthened by the wealth of data we find in the work of V.P. Krivonogov22, who visited every single settlement where Kets still live between 1991 and 1995 and managed to assemble a great amount of fine-tuned sociolinguistic data. According to Krivonogov, Ket was spoken in the following villages and settlements (from N to S)23: Kureyka Maduyka Svetlogorsk Goroshikha Turukhansk Star. Turukhansk Kostino Baklanikha 20

The following sociolinguistic overview is based on, and largely repeats, Georg 2002, which itself is heavily indebted to the meticulous statistics found in Krivonogov 1998. 21 These data are adapted from Patkanow 1909. 22 Krivonogov 1998. 23 The difference between the number of Kets given in the most recent census reports and the overall number of Kets found in the region by Krivonogov is, of course, accounted for by the fact that a certain number of Kets now live in Siberian cities like Krasnoyarsk, or in places as far afield as Moscow or St. Petersburg.

Regarding the internal dialectal division of Ket, all settlements south of (and including) Kangatovo are home to Southern Ket, in Baklanikha, Vereshchagino and Surgutikha Central Ket is spoken, and north of this is the territory of Northern Ket24. Only in three of these settlements Ket speakers form the majority, which in no case exceeds two thirds of the population: Maduyka with its small number of inhabitants and the two villages with the greatest percentage of Kets, Kellog and Sulomai, which are situated in quite inaccessible regions on tributaries of the Yenisei. It seems highly likely that this remoteness itself is a decisive factor for the ethnic composition of these settlements (Maduyka , too, is on a right tributary of the Yenisei); the villages right on the bank of the Yenisei, which is a major water-road between the densely populated south around Krasnoyarsk and the Far North with the industrial city of Noril'sk, always attracted more Russian and other non-local settlers than places, which are rarely served by regular transportation means and offer little economic prospects. All in all, only 454 ethnic Kets live in settlements where this nationality forms the majority. In addition to the decreasing language retention rate (48.3 % in 1989), the future prospects of Ket as a living language looks even less promising when we take into account Krivonogov's data on language proficiency. Of all ethnic Kets in the Yenisei regions, the following ratios (in %) are found regarding their ability to use Ket and other languages in all situations of daily life: lg. spoken

The dialectal differences between these variants are quite sharp and may at times stand in the way of mutual comprehension. Northern Ket is the least studied Ket variety, most extant data pertain to Southern Ket.

In 2003, V.P. Krivonogov published a similar table with figures obtained ten years after his first survey (Krivonogov 2003, 77)25, which shows that the decline of the Ket language is accelerating and unstoppable (data from 2001): age group 70+ 60-69 50-59 40-49 30-39 20-29 10-19 0-9

One word of caution might be added, lest the percentage of persons who speak Ket "with difficulties" is viewed with too much optimism. All too often, at least in the places that the present writer was able to visit in 1999, 2000, and 2001 (Baklanikha, Vereshchagino, and Kellog), this label has to be tacitly translated into "with considerable difficulties". It is very hard to find fluent speakers, and it is even harder to overhear a spontaneous Ket conversation between people under forty. Even some elderly persons which classify themselves as native speakers, who have not begun to use Russian before entering primary school (some of whom have served as language consultants in their youth and keep lively memories of Ketologists like A. P. Dul'zon working with them in the 1950s) may now at best be classified as semi-speakers, whose Ket speech is patched with long stretches of 25

This book was obtained shortly before the final redaction of this grammar, and only this table is reproduced here (the other data still reflecting the data of Krivonogov 1998, collected in 1991-1993). Krivonogov 2003 is, however, full of additional demographic and glossographic statistics, which generally underline the tendency shown here.

26

A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF KET

Russian. Krivonogov offers some further interesting statistics, which show that it is mostly the older generation which still uses Ket spontaneously, or which can expect to be addressed in Ket these days. Asked, which language they use most in their daily lives, Ket speakers gave the following answers (in %):

70+ 60-69 50-59 40-49 30-39 20-29 10-19 0-9

21.4 16.7 23.6 14.9 14.4 12.3 2.7 2.2

The most dramatic caesura is obviously that between the age cohorts of the 50-59 years old (born between 1930 and 1940) and older persons. While some of the latter have been exposed to elementary schooling in Ket in their youth, the next cohort had to grow up in the turmoil of World War II, when fathers fought on the front and a great number of deported persons (mainly Volga Germans and Balts) were resettled in villages of the North (where they and their descendents still live) with whom Russian was the only possible means of communication. And on the question with whom and when Ket is spoken, and when other languages are used, Krivonogov obtained the following figures (in % of those who speak Ket): language spoken:

Ket, thus, is increasingly losing its social functions. It is mainly used by the elderly, or by (adult) children communicating with their parents. From Krivonogov's data we also learn that no single monolingual Ket speaker exists26 (and that a minuscule ratio of 2.8 and 1.2 % admit to speak Russian only "with (great) difficulties"); the prospects of keeping Ket alive for more than the lifespan of the present middle generation thus seem to be very low. The most threatened of all Ket varieties still spoken is certainly the Central Ket dialect, especially its subvariety that is known in the literature as the dialect of Pakulikha. While it was chosen as the basis for the short-lived written language of the 1930s, it is now spoken only by very few individuals, and used on a daily basis 26

The 0.1 %, who do not speak Russian, have Sel'kup as a second language.

by almost none of them. Though this dialect is now spoken in Baklanikha and Vereshchagino, on the banks of the Yenisei, it was formerly the main language of the settlement of Pakulikha, which was situated on the left tributary of the Yenisei of the same name, until this village was officially dissolved by Soviet authorities in the early 1960s as one of the numerous Siberian villages "without perspective". The transfer of Pakulikha's population to their present homes is felt, by those who still remember, as the major caesura of their lives. Shortly after their resettlement, in the early 1970s, they were forced to abandon their traditional activity of reindeer breeding. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, most adults lost any opportunity to work and stayed unemployed ever since. Pensions are paid erratically only. Fishing, hunting and gathering wild berries and mushrooms are thus the only means left to insure survival. Needless to say, these circumstances do not encourage younger people to stay in their villages, and most of them plan to move to one of the Siberian cities, or even further away. Among those who stay, the omnipresent abuse of alcohol takes its toll, too, and, I have to say, in a very visible way. Languages are, first and foremost, problem-solving devices. For most Ket speakers, situations where only the use of Ket will allow them to solve real-life communicative problems will be extremely rare in their daily lives. However intensively linguists and local teachers strive to save the Ket language from oblivion, the one indispensable prerequisite for maintaining a native language and passing it on to the next generation is the need to use it. When in each communicative situation a potential, but restricted, Ket speaker will be confronted with, a different language, Russian, will be available, a language which is known by all members of the community, while only the elderly remain full speakers of Ket, little can be done to prevent the ultimate end of the use - and finally the knowledge of Ket, and, with it, of the Yeniseic language family. 2.3.5

Ket traditional culture

The best overall description of the Kets from an anthropological point of view remains Alekseenko (1967); still important, but difficult to access outside of Russia, is Dolgich (1934). In English, Donner 1933 is a useful treatment with many illustrations ; Vajda (2001, IX-XIX) offers a concise overview. The most important economic activity of the Kets was hunting wild game, such as ermines, foxes, sables or elks. Most important was the hunt on squirrels (sa¿q). Furs were mostly sold or, after contact time, used to pay the Siberian state-tax (yasak). Occasionally, bears were hunted, and a successful kill was celebrated in one of the famous bear-festivals, the last of which ever held may have been the one attended and described by Alekseenko in 1971 (Alekseenko 1985, cf. also Krejnovi‰ 1969). Traditionally, bows and arrows were used, but fire-arms have been in common use by Ket hunters for well over three centuries. Using various kinds of traps was also an important part of Ket hunting activities. Hunting was mainly a winter activity, with the exception of the hunt on ducks, which were shot in large quantities during the warm season. The short Siberian summer was largely devoted to fishing, using various kinds of nets and sophisticated fish-weirs. Some Ket groups, notably those living in the northern parts of the Ket territory in the closer vicinity of Northern Samoyedic groups, practiced reindeer-breeding.

28

A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF KET

Reindeer husbandry is generally believed to have been introduced into Ket culture due to contact with the Enets and/or Nenets. Herds were generally much smaller than those kept by Samoyeds in the Northern tundra. Since the 1960s, Soviet economic planning decisions removed most reindeer from all but the northernmost Ket settlements. At the end of the 20th century, after the end of the Soviet Union, most Kets remain without any regular earnings. As members of a "Nationality of the North" they receive a small state pension (which is sometimes, at least partially, paid in the form of pure alcohol for direct consumption). Retirement pensions are paid at irregular intervals at best, and the state-run institutions, which used to buy furs from Ket hunters on a regular basis have mostly been closed. As a consequence, the economic activities of most Kets in places like Baklanikha or Kellog are focused on the direct acquisition of food. Hunting is still an important activity (although long times of close season have to be observed, which are, despite the remoteness of the area, effectively reinforced by local authorities). Fishing may be more important now than it ever was, with the rivers supplying a considerable share of the population's protein supplies these days. Fish is mostly eaten fresh, but the practice of salting and drying it as a winter-supply (i.e. making Yukola, Ket ítn, widespread in native Siberia) is still found. One of the few sources for cash is the selling of fresh fish (mostly sturgeon) and caviar to passengers of ships passing through Ket territory on their way between Krasnoyarsk and Dudinka. In some Ket villages, a few cows are kept for milk and meat. Traditionally, the Kets do not practice agriculture of any kind, though vegetable-gardens are now relatively common. Flour, which has to be bought, is nevertheless an important staple, with Ket households normally baking white bread every few days. While collecting wild berries, cedar nuts and mushrooms is mentioned in the ethnographic literature as only a secondary activity, it recently gained importance, both for winter supplies and for generating cash. Pre-contact Ket life may be described as semi-nomadic, with a regular change of habitat in various seasons of the year. In winter, Kets moved deep into the forest to fixed hunting grounds. There, they dwelled in semi-subterraneous dugout-like huts (bá~~us); the hot summer months were spent on the river banks, usually in conical birch-bark tents (qu¿s), where the main activities were fishing and the preparation of dried winter provisions. For water-transport, canoe-like log boats were used, as well as the typically Ket houseboat (ásel, russ. dial. ilimka), which could hold a family; these were particularly useful for getting away from the clouds of mosquitoes, which infest especially the river shores during the hottest parts of the year. All these types of dwellings have been in use for the better part of the 20th century, and they have been observed and photographed by anthropologists. Today, however, all Ket families live in Russian-style wooden houses (izba), and the once regular moving-cycles are a thing of the past, albeit still remembered by members of the older generations. The Ket family is patrilinear and patrilocal. In earlier times, strict rules of exogamy between two moieties were observed. These groups were known by the names of

29

Qéntan and Bókdide~27. The latter are traditionally associated with the rivers Podkamennaya Tunguska and Bakhta (or, more generally, with the East), and the former with the West (chiefly the Elogui region). However, in historical times both groups generally lived together in the same settlements, with only the rules of exogamy and several social taboos (burials, e.g., had to be handled by members of the opposite moiety) differentiating between them. Kets are, nominally at least, members of the Russian Orthodox Church, though this fact does not seem to influence their lives in any observable way. In recent years, aggressive mission activities conducted by what seems to be a fundamentalist protestant group led to several conversions, including elderly people, in Kellog. Few traces of pre-Christian religious activities and beliefs play any role in presentday Ket life. The main personalities (human and superhuman) of Ket mythology, as depicted in fokloristic traditions and texts, are: Álba

Àllal

Bàlna

Dàk

A mythical personality, sometimes described as the first human or the first shaman, creator of the Yenisei and the Ket habitat; he was transformed into a range of rocks on the right bank of the Yenisei. Protecting spirit of a household (female); venerated in the form of a small wooden image with clothes, sometimes used for divination purposes (it is thrown in the air to answer questions by the way it comes to lie on the ground). A legendary (possibly historical) hero, fought against the Ewenki, viewed as endowed with supernatural powers, venerated as the ancestor of the Bal'din family in Kellog. (appellative noun, "loon, diver, russ. gagara"), the Ket holy bird, helping spirit of shamans. Cf. the Ewenki exonym for the Kets, n'umn'akan, which may refer to this bird (cf. supra). A legendary bird (a female eagle) with iron claws, symbol of the upper world, able to cover the sun.

Dòq/Dòk A legendary shaman of the Qéntan moiety (on the Elogui), who met with Tómam and Hósedam (q.v.). Dók-da qo¿t "Dòk's way" is the Ket name for the Milky Way.

The communication between humans and supernatural beings is handled by shamans (séna~). Shamanistic practices have been repeatedly described in the ethnographic literature at great length (cf. Anu‰in 1914, whose accounts have, however, been repeatedly criticized as not always fully accurate; here, too, Alekseenko 1967 remains the best source). Though shamans are an important feature of Ket traditional religious practice, as it is/was the case with many other indigenous ethnic groups of Northern

THE KETS AND THEIR LANGUAGE

31

Asia, it is only one aspect of traditional religion, and we do not think that a term like "shamanism" should be regarded as a proper, let alone precise, cover term for the often widely diverging native religions of Siberia. On a general note, it is worthy of mention that both the material and parts of the spiritual culture of the Kets bears often close resemblances with those of the Sel'kups. Without implying that anything, which seems cognate or strikingly similar here has to be regarded as "the same", and without jumping to conclusions on origins or possible directions of diffusion or influence, it seems fair to state that both ethnic groups and their cultures still merit being studied in context. It was still possible in 2001 - but increasingly difficult - to record traditional stories or descriptions of religious and/or traditional rituals and customs from elderly Ket speakers. Folkloristic Ket texts contain reminiscences of what may have been a prehistoric northward migration across a mighty mountain range (possibly the Sayan), and of wars between Kets and Ewenks as well as Samoyedic peoples. 2.4

The areal setting of Ket and Yeniseic

The Kets are not the only small nationality occupying their habitat. Many Ket settlements are also home to a sizable number of Sel'kups (who relatively often remain vigorous speakers of their emblematic language). Sel'kup is a Samoyedic (Uralic) language, the epicentre of which is the system of the Taz river, in the North West of the Ket region. Kets and Sel'kups are tied by a long common history of mutual exogamy; consequently, interethnic relations between Kets and Sel'kups have always been friendly and cooperative (cf. the Ket name for the Sel'kups, 2.1), a sizable number of ethnic Sel'kups speak Ket fluently, some additionally to Sel'kup and Russian, some as their only non-Russian language. In some settlements, Ewenks28 are present (to the East of the Yenisei, the Evenkijskij Natsional'nyj Okrug, capital Tura , is situated). Ewenki, the major language of the Tungusic language family, is still vigorously used in other regions of Siberia, whereas on the Yenisei most ethnic Ewenks have but a faint memory of this language. Traditionally, Ket-Ewenk relations are said to have been mostly hostile. The same holds for Ket-Nenets relations; Nenets is another (Northern) Samoyedic language, still vigorously used in three territories of the Russian North on both sides of the Ural mountain range (the Nenetskiy Avtonomny Okrug, capital Nar'yan-Mar on the cis-Uralic Pechora river; the Yamalo-Nenetskiy Avtonomny Okrug , capital Salekhard on the Ob' , and the Taimyrskiy [Dolgano-Nenetskiy] Avtonomny Okrug, capital Dudinka on the Yenisei). Today, there are few regular contacts between Ket and Nenets speakers. Another, moribund, Samoyedic language of the region, Enets, is now spoken nowhere near a settlement with Ket speakers; however, the Enets language shows some rather intriguing signs of former

28

In non-Russian works, this ethnic group and its language are most often called Evenki. However, the first consonant found in this name is clearly [w], Western renderings with being transliterations from Russian (which has no [w]).

A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF KET

language contact with a language which must have been Yeniseic, most probably Ket29. Other nationalities present in the Ket villages include of course the Russian and Ukrainian majorities and a sizable number of individuals belonging to ethnic groups deported to Siberia during World War II, including Volga Germans, Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Kuban Greeks, and other peoples of the former Soviet Union; some individuals still use the emblematic languages of their nationalities. 2.5

History of the investigation of Ket/Yeniseic30

The first Russian explorers reached the Yenisei relatively shortly after the cossack leader Yermak's successful campaigns against the Turkic Khanate Sibir' in the 1580s, the event, which is traditionally taken as the beginning of the Russian expansion across the Ural mountain range, and which eventually led to the establishment of "Siberia" as an integral part of the Russian Empire. The first Russians reached the region of the Yenisei and its left affluents as early as the first decade of the 17th century. They were "tax-collectors" who extended the fur-tax system (yasak) long before established to the West of the Urals to the terra nova in the East. Semi-permanent settlements, later fortresses (ostrogs), were set up for this purpose, some of which remained stable and developed into full-scale cities. Mangazeya on the river Taz - in Sel'kup territory - was one of these early encampments, now abandoned, which imposed the fur-tax regime on the natives of the region already in 1601. Parts of the Ket and Yeniseian population were doubtlessly in the range of this system from its very beginning (in 1607, an outpost from Mangazeya was established at a place called Inbak), and the Pumpokol tribe officially accepted the yasak31. The city of Tomsk, to the West of the Yeniseian territory, was founded in 1604, in 1619 Yeniseisk (in Yugh and Pumpokol territory), and in 1628 Krasnoyarsk and Kansk (the former in Arin, the latter in Assan and Kott territory) followed suit. In order to establish their right on the yasak, Russians had to break the power of the Turkic Yenisei Kirghiz, until then the political overlords of the upper reaches of the Yenisei (and yasak -collectors themselves). No collections of Ket or Yeniseian linguistic data were undertaken in these early days, but some ethnographical observations, and of course clan, place and personal names, can be found in historical documents surviving from this time (for details cf. Dolgich 1960).

It has, e.g., borrowed Yeniseic/Ket personal pronouns. This chapter is but a concise overview of scholars and their works pertaining to Ket and Yeniseian studies. In most cases, a few sentences have to suffice to characterize the contributions of the most important personalities in the field. A more detailed account can be found in Vajda 2001, 1-17. This outstanding book contains a remarkably complete bibliography of virtually everything written and published on Yeniseian linguistics and ethnography before the 21st century, and no student of Ket can afford to ever be without it. Readers demanding more information about the works of scholars mentioned in this chapter should open the relevant pages of Vajda's book and will find all of them enumerated, summarized and competently characterized, down to the tiniest newspaper article. 31 Much to the disappointment of Tungus groups, then politically quite dominant in the region, who continued to fight against the Russians for quite some time. 30

33

THE KETS AND THEIR LANGUAGE

Yeniseic peoples have been described in the early travel literature, beginning in the 17th century (cf. Vajda 2001, 1, for a concise account). However, linguistic data begin to be recorded only a good one hundred years after "contact time". The first lexical data from Yeniseic languages (Arin and Kott) to appear in print seem to be those found in the work of the Swedish officer Strahlenberg (*1676, cf. Strahlenberg 1730). Strahlenberg spent some 13 years in Russia as a prisoner of war after the defeat of the Swedes at Poltava in the Great Nordic War in 1709. His work was very influential in the 18th century and enjoyed some reputation as a first attempt to classify some of the native languages of Siberia. Strahlenberg's exact itinerary in the country remains, however, unknown, and it is unclear whether he collected all linguistic data found in his book himself. In fact, it is known that he was a part-time travel companion of the botanist D.G. Messerschmidt, who travelled in Siberia between 1720 and 1727. It was the latter, who is distinguished as being the first scholar to record Ket language data in the field. According to his diary, he reached the estuary of the river Bakhta on the 9th of June 1723. He managed to record several names of wild birds and a few numerals from the language of the "Ostyaks" he encountered there, i.e. Kets. On the following day, on the estuary of the rivulet "Eed-«e« " (lit. "sable river", modern Ket èd sŒs ), he recorded a longer specimen. In the following, we reproduce the list of Ket words (alphabetized, without the numerals) found in Messerschmidt's diary, confronted with the same words (if any) as given in Castrén's materials (1858, see below) and our modern notation of Ket words, which may show the relative stability of the basic features of Ket phonology during the last 280 years, as well as both Messerschmidt's and Castrén's ways of putting Ket to writing: Messerschmidt

This equation is not entirely secure; the modern Ket word designates the "twig of a coniferous tree"; Messerschmidt may well have received this answer producing such a twig and - being a botanist! - he could have mistaken his informants for professional colleagues and recorded the word as the name of the tree. 34 < russ. zoloto

Other travellers who crossed Ket and Yeniseian territory in the 18th century, and who brought home lexical data include G.F. Müller (trav. 1733-1743), J.G, Gmelin (id.), and J.E. Fischer (trav. 1739-1747). Some of these data were republished in the famous compilations of P.S. Pallas (1786) and J. Klaproth (1823). The next scholar to visit speakers of Yeniseian languages was, a whole century later, the Finnish linguist Mathias Alexander Castrén. On a quest to find and explore the eastern relatives of the Finns, he spent, between 1846 and 1848, several months in Yeniseian territory, where he was the first investigator to systematically collect linguistic data from Ket, Yugh and Kott, with the aim to understand and describe the structure of these languages39. After his untimely death in 1853, Anton Schiefner edited his numerous works posthumously. Apart from his full-scale grammar of Yenisei-Ostyak (Yugh and Ket) and Kott (which has a glossary, but no texts, Castrén 1858), his diaries and letters (published as Castrén 1856) contain

35

Castrén's term translates literally as "white copper" (baker < Tk.); Messerschmidt's entry seems to consist of the adjective 'white' only, here. Not entirely clear. 36 This is actually a finite verb form: ul7-(i)-ta "it is raining". 37 An unidentified word, with a very "un-yeniseic" outward appearance. 38 There is no direct equivalent in Castrén's material, and no exact cognate in modern Ket, but it seems clear enough that Messerschmidt's word is derived from the root √ídi~ "to write" (orig. "to decorate" or the like). 39 Castrén soon gave up on his initial idea that Yeniseian languages had anything to do with Finnish (Finno-Ugric, Uralic, "Ural-Altaic") and turned back to his main objective. In doing so, he founded almost single-handedly the discipline of comparative Samoyedology, and became the first scholar to write a grammar of a living Mongolic language (Buryat), a living Tungusic language (North-Baikal Ewenki), and one of the first persons to describe a living Siberian Turkic language (Tuvan and Tofa). For his Yeniseian work, it seems likely that at least some of his materials have been collected by his travel companion Bergstadi.

A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF KET

numerous pieces of information of great value for Yeniseian linguistics and ethnography. Again, Yeniseian studies remained orphaned for several decades, until the FinnoUgricist Kai Donner visited the Yenisei region in 1912. At this time, he collected mainly ethnographical data, but later he returned to Yeniseian studies and worked for a while with an informant (I.F. Dibikov) in Helsinki during the summer of 1928. The results of these activities are collected in his Ethnological Notes (Donner 1933), which contain valuable observations on the life of the Ket and Yugh. His linguistic materials (mostly lexical) were published posthumously (Donner 19551958). They retain their value, but Donner's command of Ket was - as he admitted himself - rather limited, and the reader of his works on Ket should without fail consult Karl Bouda's immensely learned commentaries on and corrections to them (Bouda 1958). Another travelling ethnographer visiting the Kets in the 1920s was Hans Findeisen, who collected a wealth of anthropological material in situ. He was only marginally interested in collecting language data, let alone in linguistics, but he did write down some texts, which still remain largely unpublished (with the exception of a short specimen which made it into Donner 1958). Findeisen may well have been the last non-Soviet scholar to visit Ket settlements before the dissolution of the USSR in and the subsequent lift of travel restrictions in Siberia in the 1990s. Among pre-WWII Soviet scholars Nestor Konstantinovich Karger stands out as the only linguist doing serious work on Ket. His works are few in number, but comprise the first grammatical sketch of Ket after Castrén (Karger 1934a) and the first - and for almost 60 years only - school primer in the Ket language (in the Central Ket dialect, Karger 1934b). The alphabet designed for this purpose was developed by him, and it was also he, who published the first continuous Ket text ever to appear in print (Karger 1927). Karger fell victim to the horrors of (probably) the year 1937 and its purges, and the Ket literacy program was discontinued until Heinrich Werner initiated a new one in 198940. The opening pages of Aleksandr Solzhenicyn's "Archipelag GULAG" mention Karger and his fate:

Ó Êà$ãå$à çàìåëè à$õèâ åíèñåéñêèõ îñòÿêîâ, çàï$åòèëè èçîá$åòåííó% èì ïèñüìåííîñòü è áóêâà$ü - è îñòàëñÿ íà$îäåö áåç ïèñüìåííîñòè. It was not before 1955 that the systematic investigation of Ket and Yugh started again. This year marks the first expedition of A.P. Dul'zon, based in Tomsk, to the peoples of the Yenisei. Dul'zon was an outstanding scholar who, from then on, managed to publish a truly impressive chain of works on all aspects of Ket and Yugh linguistics, ethnography, history and prehistory, as well as their relations with extinct Yeniseian peoples and their languages and contacts with non-Yeniseian groups41. Apart from his own work, the most important of which is his comprehensive grammar of Ket (and, promiscue, also of Yugh, Dul'zon 1968), he 40

In 2000, the present author was able to meet some elderly speakers of Central Ket in Vereshchagino, who remembered having received native-language instruction in their schooldays in the 1930s with Karger's book. 41 The enumeration of his Yeniseiological publications occupies pp. 95-112 of Vajda 2001.

was also a charismatic teacher42. Many of his students, who had been introduced to Yeniseian linguistics and, above all, field-work, continue their scholarly activities to this day, making the Pedagogical University of Tomsk and its Department (previously Laboratory for Siberian Indigenous Languages, now headed by Andrej Fil'‰enko) the chief centre of Ket and Yeniseian studies of the contemporary world. Most Soviet and Russian scholars working on these languages are in one way or another connected with the Tomsk school (an offshoot of which is now based in nearby Novosibirsk, N. M. Gri«ina, S.S. Butorin). For a concise overview of the Tomsk school and its most active members (some of which are now continuing their work outside of Russia) cf. Vajda 2001, 11-12, and the numerous bibliographical articles in the main part of that book43. The Laboratory still houses a wealth of handwritten and taped data collections from Ket, Yugh and other, nonYeniseian, languages of Central Siberia, which are now gradually being made accessible to the wider scholarly world with the support of the Max-Planck-Institut für Evolutionäre Anthropologie in Leipzig under the direction of Bernard Comrie. Though a direct student of Dul'zon's, Heinrich Werner44 is certainly to be regarded as a truly independent scholar. His publications touch on every aspect of Yeniseian; among other things, he detected the tonal systems of Ket and Yugh, developed the new Ket orthography, and produced full-scale grammars of Ket (1997c), Yugh (1997b), and Kott (1997a). His opus maximum is certainly the three-volume Vergleichendes Wörterbuch (Werner 2002), which constitutes a true thesaurus of all Yeniseian lexical data ever collected. For a fuller acknowledgement of Werner's unique contribution to Yeniseian studies, cf. Vajda/Anderson 2003 and the bibliography in Vajda 2001, 297-319 (Verner) and 325-330 (Werner). Some works of Werner's, which appeared after 1999 are listed in the bibliography of this grammar. Another very influental Russian Ketologist, working entirely on his own and not associated with the Tomsk school, was E.A. Krejnovi‰ in Leningrad. Already a renowned expert on two other "Palaeoasiatic" languages, Nivkh and Yukaghir, he turned to Ket in the 1960s. His book-length study of the structure of the Ket verb (Krejnovi‰ 1968) solved many riddles of this enigmatic part of speech and retains its great value to this day. Other contributors from Russia include S.A. and G.S. Starostin, who are mainly interested in the pursuit of external genetic relationships of Yeniseian (S.A. Starostin 1982, 1995). The present writer remains extremely skeptical towards these attempts, but the painstaking work of G.S. Starostin on the Ket verb, which steers free of the "Sino-Caucasian" hypothesis, should be singled out as a very valuable contribution to Ket linguistics. Outside of Russia, Yeniseian studies have found another home in the USA, where especially Edward Vajda of Western Washington University specializes in 42

And a true "linguist" in the older sense of this English word. When I asked V.V. Doro&kin (see below), who had worked as a Ket informant with Dul'zon decades ago, how well Dul'zon spoke Ket, I received the answer "Kak keto" ("Like a Ket"). 43 It is probably safe to say that the majority of Ketological works mentioned in this bibliography have been produced by Tomi‰i ("Tomskians"). For the time after 1955, this is clearly the case. 44 Genrich Kasparovi‰ Verner in Russian publications of his.

Yeniseian since the 1990s. His works on the Ket verb opened up entirely new paths of research, and the present grammar is heavily indebted to many insights brought forward by him. Some of his observations (the templatic nature of the system of Ket position classes, the reduction of morphological slots found in the Ket verb to 10, the four conjugation classes, the intricate system of morphotactic rules, to name but a few) are major breakthroughs. Though I - quite naturally - do not agree with every detail of his analysis (which is most easily accessible in Vajda 2004), I see no possibility to fall back behind his seminal paper (Vajda 2001), which constitutes, in my view, a watershed, after which nothing (or, say, few things) can ever be the same in Ket linguistics. 2.5.1 Author's fieldwork In the years 1999, 2000, and 2001, the author of this grammar visited several villages, where Central and Southern Ket are still spoken by some members of the community. In the late summer of 1999, he spent several weeks in Baklanikha on the Yenisei, in August 2000 in Baklanikha and Vereshchagino (together with Ekaterina Klopotova and Svetlana Stepanova, then doctoral students at Tomsk Pedagogical University45), which is located ca. 30 km south of Baklanikha, and in 2001, on a joint expedition with linguists from Tomsk and Novosibirsk (Elizaveta Kotorova, Natal'ja Gri«ina, Andrej Kazancev) the focus was shifted to the Southern Ket variant and its centre, Kellog on the Elogui. The main informants and suppliers of oral Ket data during the author's fieldwork were: Zoja Vasil'evna Maksunova Baklanikha, born in Pakulikha (*1950), Central Ket, Ket teacher, communal worker, and trained Ketologist Viktor Vasil'evi‰ Doro&kin Baklanikha, Central Ket, born in Pakulikha (*1956) Pavel' Michajlovi‰ Dibikov Vereshchagino, Central Ket, born in Pakulikha (*1927) Matrena Jakovlevna Chozova Vereshchagino, Central Ket, born in the taiga, locally widely known as Tyotya-Myotya , exceptionally good speaker (*1924) Tatjana F. Er«ova (née Bal'dina) Kellog, birth date unknown, ca. 1940 Ul'jana Kotusova Kellog, born in the taiga, ca. 1930 Valentina Andreevna Romanenkova Krasnoyarsk, born in Kellog (*1942), industrial worker, exceptionally fluent in Ket (for a photo taken by the author of this grammar, cf. the cover of Vajda 2004)

Notational conventions and façons de parler

Throughout the following - non-phonological - sections of this book, the transcription used will closely reflect the phonological system outlined and described below (chapter 3). However, for practical reasons, the following conventions are introduced: The correct morphological parsing of verbal forms will often involve the cancellation of several surface morphonological processes in the notation. Verbal forms will be given parsed according to the principles outlined in the chapters on morphology, sometimes accompanied by a representation of their surface manifestation; thus, e.g., "I am going" (√-tn) will be given as

bo/k6-a4-tn 1/D-T-go in some cases accompanied by , or, in Central Ket, , which are closer to the forms actually heard. In the parsed transcriptions, certain morphonological rules are deliberately violated, or cancelled, such as the intervocalic voicing and spirantization rule (of /k/ and /q/), while they are largely represented in the bracketed notation, which thus remains closer to that of other Ketologists, resp. of the various orthographic conventions for Ket. However, even here, phonetic palatalization is not given, nor is non-phonemic, predictable vowel allophony (especially if leading to [æ], [ø], [ø], [œ] respectively, which are normally reflected in other notational traditions of Ketology). Examples taken from published sources are retranscribed into the notational system used throughout this book, except where noted otherwise, or where phonetic details are central to the discussion. 2.6.1

The verbal formula

The parsing of finite verb forms is justified throughout chapter 4.4 and the representation of full and/or partial paradigms is outlined in section 2.6.4. If verbs are quoted as lexical entries, a schematic "verbal formula" is applied throughout. This formula contains the purely "lexical" elements of the Ket verb in the linear order in which they occur in an actual form, separated by hyphens, thus starting with any P7 incorporate46 (cf. 4.4.5.2), followed by any P5 determiner (4.4.5.4) and giving the lexical root (R, 4.4.5.1) at the rightmost edge. This string of lexical elements is then invariably followed by an indication of the conjugation class (I-V, 46

"P" stands for "position", and denotes one of the numbered morphological "slots" of the Ket verb, cf. 4.4.2

40

A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF KET

with, if applicable, a subscript indication of morphologically transitive (tr) or intransitive (itr) verbs, cf. 4.4.3). If present, thematic a4 is given in brackets47, as is the preterite marker used with this particular verb (i.e., in most cases, il or in, cf. 4.4.5.11)48. With verbs of conjugation classes II and III, the "series" of the P6 (subject and object) markers, which is not predictable, has to be indicated. This is done by bracketed (bo) or (ba). In these cases, following determiners are described in this grammar as "co-occupying" slot P6, rather than P5. These are given after a slash (/) in the same bracket as the P6 marker. More on P6 markers is to be found in 4.4.5.7, the justification of giving determiners as co-occupying P6 in these verbs is given in 4.4.5.3. Some examples:

loq~ Iitr (il) tn IIitr (bo/k) (a) (in) lubid7-bed IItr (bo/k) (a) (il) ok IIIitr (ba/t) (a) (in) tan IVitr (a) (il)

"to shiver, tremble" intransitive verb of conjugation I, no a4, preterite in il "to go" itr. verb, conj. II, bo-series of P6 markers, determiner k, a4, preterite in in "to love" tr. v., conj. II, P7 incorporate, bo -series in P6, determiner k, a4, pret. in in "to shudder" itr. v, conj. III, ba-series in P6, determiner t, a4, pret. in in "to stop, remain standing" itr. verb, conj. IV, a4, pret. in in

This formula (usually given in italics in this grammar) summarizes the minimum morphological information necessary to generate correct finite forms, or, for that matter, to correctly parse forms found in texts or other sources. 2.6.2 The notation of Ket words The transcription of Ket words in this grammar is intended to be as phonemic as possible. This makes it inevitable that some Ket words and morphemes - among them frequent lexical items and important affixes - may look at times unfamiliar to readers with some acquaintance with earlier ketological literature. The most important deviations from traditional Ketology (and, mutatis mutandis, from Ket orthography, as well) are the following:

47

The status of this element as a lexical element vs. a purely morphological marker is disputed (cf. 4.4.5.8.2); though we treat it as mostly lexical in nature (it cannot be "switched on or off" by purely morphological processes; it may, though, as Vajda thinks, have a function describable in morphological terms), we chose this notation in order to reflect its somewhat unclear status. 48 Of course, the preterite markers are morphological in nature, but the choice of the proper variant is governed by lexical factors only (at least in synchronically observable Ket and Yugh), so they need to be given in the formula, but are, here, removed from the purely lexical elements.

THE KETS AND THEIR LANGUAGE

41

- phonetically palatalized consonants will not be marked: instead of traditional , only , , , will be written; the phonological justification of this is to be found in 3.1.1. - the traditional three central vowels of Ket, , , are reduced to two, and ; [ø] is analyzable as an allophone of /™/, consequently only the latter two will be written. - the traditional open vowels, and are treated as allophones of /e/ and /o/ respectively, and only the latter will surface in the transcription; the phonological justification of this and the preceding convention is also to be found in 3.1.1. - automatic intervocalic and contact-induced voicing, as well as spirantization of consonants will not be recognized in the transcription, thus only , will be written (this holds also for the morphotactic separator (k ), which only appears intervocalically, and thus phonetically only as [V], but is to be analyzed as underlying /k/). - final devoicing will not be recognized in the transcription; this is perhaps one of the more radical deviations from the Ketological tradition, giving familiar and frequent elements a somewhat unfamiliar appearance:

Interlinear glosses

Throughout this grammar, sentence examples are accompanied by a free translation and a morph-by-morph gloss, which is designed to facilitate the understanding of Ket data50. 49

Actually, this notation is a compromise, made necessary by a somewhat conflicting behaviour of this root's final consonant: instances like d[i]8-albed7-a4-bed, phonetically [daÖl∆bE|aBet], "I cook fish soup", where rhotacism is observed, clearly speak in favour of /d /; however, if the root occurs in R position and is followed by
