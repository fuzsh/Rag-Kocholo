Bruno earned his bachelor's degree in 1950 from the University of Illinois, where he worked as a sportswriter for the university's newspaper, The Daily Illini, alongside Shel Silverstein, Bud Karmin, Gene Shalit, Hugh Hough and Robert Novak. He also worked for the Champaign News Gazette during weekends while in college. He served in the Korean War as an Army intelligence officer. Bruno then earned a Fulbright scholarship to study in India after the war. He married his wife, Margaret \"Meg\" Christian Bruno, on November 12, 1959. Bruno launched his professional career as a reporter for Chicago area newspapers and news agencies. His first job after his graduation was for Advertising Age before becoming the sports editor of the The Daily Chronicle. He temporarily left his profession in order to serve in the Korean War. Bruno returned to Chicago after the war and joined the staff of the Chicago City News Bureau as a police reporter. He joined The Chicago American in 1954. In 1956, Bruno earned a Fulbright Scholarship in India to study Indian media. He worked as a South Asian correspondent for the International News Service while in India. Bruno covered some of the biggest news stories of the 1950s, including the 1956 Suez Crisis, the Our Lady of the Angels School fire in 1958, and the Cuban revolution in 1959. He joined the staff of Newsweek magazine in 1960. Bruno worked as a reporter, foreign correspondent, news editor and chief political correspondent for Newsweek for 18 years.

The debate would become known for unusual responses and negative rhetoric from the candidates and the audience. It would later be called \"the most combative debate in the 32-year history of the televised forums\" by the Washington Post. One of the most memorable moments from the debate came early in the night. Bruno, in his capacity as debate moderator, asked James Stockdale, \"Admiral Stockdale, your opening statement, please, sir? \" Stockdale famously replied to Bruno's request: \"Who am I?

FIRST EDITION, first printing. Full number line present. Book is brand new and unread. Personally hand signed by author Bob Odenkirk of \"Breaking Bad\" fame AND his daughter, Erin, who did the illustrations for the book. Both signed to book specific bookplate affixed to first interior page. COA included! Dust jacket hand covered in protective archival grade Mylar for many worry free years of reading/collecting! Photos available upon request. Emmy Award-winning and New York Times bestselling writer, comedian, and actor Bob Odenkirk and his daughter, illustrator Erin Odenkirk, present poetic nonsense for all ages perfect for fans of Shel Silverstein and Jack Prelutsky! Bob Odenkirk began writing these poems with his children when they were little, compiling the poetry into a homemade book entitled Olde Time Rhymes. He wanted Nate and Erin to understand that actual people had written the books the family loved to read and to instill in them the feeling that they could be writers and illustrators themselves. Almost twenty years later, when the Odenkirks found themselves quarantined under the same roof, they revisited these mostly silly, sometimes poignant works. It wasn't until Erin began to create illustrations to accompany the words, though, that the book grew to be something much bigger than an Odenkirk family treasure. From the titular made-up word for a blanket fort, an adorable dog with a penchant for the zoomies, and a father teaching his kids how umbrellas work, the subjects of these works, complemented by Erin's whimsical and detailed linework, come alive on these pages. Featuring over seventy poems, Zilot & Other Important Rhymes will delight readers young and old. Signed by Author(s).\n\nHardcover. Condition: Very good +. Dust Jacket Condition: Very good +.
