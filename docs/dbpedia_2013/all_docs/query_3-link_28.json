        "text": "The study looks at the trade quantification, and documents single stages of the Russian-Chinese trade exchange in Kyakhta and May-ma-chen between 1727 and 1861. It is divided into three sections. The first one deals with an appraisal of available volume indicators that relates to the exchange trading. Based on findings and confronting other analysed spheres, the author defines the basic stages of the trade development in the monitored period. What he demonstrates is that the trade was greatly affected by political and geographical factors, and the fact that both countries did not attach equal importance to it. The trade in Kyakhta had never reached extent it could have had, but fell into rapid decline as soon as an alternative, cheaper way to trade exchange between Russia and China had appeared. Yet it influenced the town and the whole region development, including culture and education spheres; in the second quarter of the 19th century it substantially contributed to Siberian econo...\n\nThe contribution is devoted to qualitative and quantitative changes brought about by the 18th century in ongoing efforts of the Russian government circles to establish a direct contact with India, develop the Russian-Indian trade, and the role Indian trading communities had in the goods exchange between India and Russia. The study sets the mutual dependence of both phenomena in a direct context, and tries to show a cause of failure of the Russian side’s effort, which had also partially affected prosperity and change of the Indian trading community in Astrakhan.\n\nThe Merchants of Siberia: Trade in Early Modern Eurasia. Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 2016. xiii + 410 pp. isbn 978-0-80145-407-3. $ 49.95. In The Merchants of Siberia, Erika Monahan examines the relationship between Russia's economic ambitions and territorial expansion across Siberia from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries. One might be tempted to pause for a moment and ask: in the larger context of Russian imperial history, how important was Siberia? As the answer unfolds over eight chapters, divided into three parts, it becomes quite clear that for early modern Russia, Siberia was very important. Throughout her study, Monahan highlights not just Russian intentions, but the ways that the Siberian environment challenged Russian officials and merchants, requiring them to rethink their plans, modify them, and make new ones in order to achieve their goals. Monahan summarizes: \" Siberia immediately evokes associations of exile and fur, but the history of Siberia told here is that of an empire learning to function \" (p. vi). Part One of the book, \" Commerce and Empire, \" introduces readers to Rus-sian objectives in venturing into Siberia. Monahan observes that Moscow's political and commercial interests were in some ways different from those of other early modern European powers venturing out elsewhere in the globe. But she finds that the differences have often been overstated, and those that merit consideration stem from environmental factors peculiar to the Russian experience in Siberia and not from Russia's presumed backwardness or isolation. Together, merchants and agents of the state learned to negotiate governance, commercial relationships, and life in a distant and poorly defined imperial territory that was rapidly expanding and transforming over the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In these first two chapters, Monahan lays the foundation for her argument that the state was important, but that it was primarily local context that shaped infrastructure, relationships and fortunes in early modern Siberia.\n\nThis essay underlines the essential role of Russo-Chinese border trade in the creation of the multiethnic identity of Siberian outposts such as Nerchinsk and Kiakhta. In the seventeenth/early eighteenth century-under Tsar Peter the Great-Siberia became a meeting place for Russian, Central Asian and Chinese cultures. Furthermore, the Russo-Chinese trade was an important parameter of European economic expansion. Europe and the Far East met territorially only along the Eurasian frontier between Siberia and the Manchu Empire. Profitable trade, however, experienced a severe decline in the 1720s. Peter I&#39;s rigid fiscal policy choked off private initiative and prevented Siberia from becoming a major commercial entrepot between the West and East.\n\nThe imperative of the long-distance seaborne trade of Europeans, from the age of exploration, was to acquire the goods of the exotic East – the silks and porcelains and tea of China, the spices of the spice islands and the textiles of India. Goods from the East focuses on the trade in fine products: how they were made, marketed and distributed between Asia and Europe. This trade was conducted by East India Companies and many private traders, and the first Global Age that resulted deeply affected European consumption and manufacturing. This book provides a full comparative and connective study of Asia's trade with a range of European countries. Its themes relate closely to issues of fine manufacturing and luxury goods in the current age of globalization. Goods from the East brings together established scholars, such as Jan de Vries, Om Prakash and Josh Gommans, and a new generation of researchers, who together look into the connections between European consumer cultures and Asian trade.\n\nThe focus of this article is on legal-economic institutions that organized early-modern Eurasian trade. It identifies two such institutions that had divergent dispersion patterns, the corporation and the commenda. The corporation ended up as a uniquely European institution that did not migrate until the era of European colonization. The commenda that originated in Arabia migrated all the way to Western Europe and to China. The article explains their divergent dispersion based on differences in their institutional and geographical environments and on dynamic factors, claiming that institutional analysis errs when it ignores migration of institutions and providing building blocks for the modeling of institutional migration."
