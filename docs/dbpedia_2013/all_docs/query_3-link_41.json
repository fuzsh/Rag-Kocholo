        "text": "This study explores the socio-tribal organization of the Nanai living near Lake Bolon, with reference to environment and migration, using published and unpublished sources, S.K. Patkanov's statistical materials, and our fi eld data. We employ D.N. Anuchin's spatial distribution and variation method for reconstructing the pattern of settlement and assessing the socio-tribal structure with regard to the contacts between sedentary and nomadic populations in the Lower Amur region. The Lake Bolon area was a transit territory traversed by reindeer herders and hunters on their way to the Pacifi c coast, and the place whence the Amur natives migrated in various directions. This is where the herding, hunting, and fi shing traditions merged. The Nanai settlers selected places that matched their economic specializations, and these places eventually acquired symbolic functions. Small populations merged, and borrowed the names of large territorial groups. Marital contacts and kinship ties are analyzed in detail. Social relationships were regulated by the Dokha institution: clans concluded alliances based on mutual aid. Intermarriage was allowed only after several generations. The analysis of exogamous clans such as Khodzher, Odzyal, Kile, and Beldy, which had settled near the lake, and the interviewing of the natives suggest that along with the Tungus patrilineal kinship, the matrilineal system predating the Tungus expansion was still practiced."
