The authors skillfully address the panoply issues, central for understanding today’s regimes in these countries as well as differences among them. The book homes in on the problems of social change and continuity, legitimacy and resistance, people’s agency and conformism.”\n\nSPPS\n\n211\n\nSPPS\n\nEdited by Andreas Umland\n\nSoviet and Post-Soviet Politics and Society\n\nBennich-Björkman, Kurbatov (eds.)\n\nThis captivating volume brings together case studies drawn from four post-Soviet states— Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova. The collected papers illustrate how the events that started in 1985 and brought down the USSR six years later led to the rise of fifteen successor states, with their own historicized collective memories. The volume’s analyses juxtapose history textbooks for secondary schools and universities, and how they aim to create understandings as well as identities that are politically usable, within their different contexts. From this emerges a picture of multiple perestroika(s) and diverging development paths. Only in Ukraine—a country that recently experienced two popular uprisings, the Orange Revolution and the Revolution of Dignity—the people themselves are ascribed agency and the power to change their country. In the other three states, elites are, instead, presented as prime movers of society, as is historical determinism.\n\nVol. 211\n\nMichail Suslov, Assistant Professor of Cross-Cultural and Regional Studies, University of Copenhagen\n\nWhen the Future Came\n\nThe editors: Dr. Li Bennich-Björkman is Johan Skytte Professor in Eloquence and Political Science at the University of Uppsala.

Uppsala and Kyiv, 5 March, 2019 Li Bennich-Björkman, Sergiy Kurbatov\n\n8\n\nWhen the Future Came Li Bennich-Björkman and Sergiy Kurbatov\n\nIntroduction This is a book about how the changes that brought the Soviet Union to its end, and their aftermath, have gradually formed cultural, collective memories throughout the former Soviet Union. Told through the retrospective lens of official history writing in four post-Soviet countries, the rise of a new order has become embedded in the uniquely national experiences of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova. The book analyzes history textbooks for secondary schools and universities from the 1990s and up to 2012 in these four countries, striving to capture the officially sanctioned national gazes on what constitutes their recent past, gazes that take in the years of perestroika, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the independent statehood that followed, in partly similar, but mostly divergent narratives between the countries and over time. Focusing on the comparative aspects of how national history textbooks in these countries chose to narrate what to the surrounding world often and incorrectly appeared to be a commonly experienced historical process allows us to understand the various trajectories of sovereignty unfolding since independence in 1991 in these four countries, and beyond them in the former Soviet Union in its entirety. These trajectories range from renouncing the Soviet past and embracing statehood and nation-building in Ukraine, to regretting the loss of Soviet community and deemphasizing independence in Belarus. Not least among these four countries, there is also great diversity in how geopolitical orientations developed after the collapse, which is further explored by getting close to the historiographies of each of them. Today, after the Crimea annexation and the war in Eastern Ukraine, Ukrainians have been looking towards Europe more unanimously than before, whereas Moldova is still vacillating, and is now tending to move in a Russian direction. 9\n\n10\n\nL. BENNICH-BJÖRKMAN, S. KURBATOV\n\nBelarus has remained closely tied to Russia, upholding federative or confederative tendencies within the region, while keeping a door open towards the European Union through the Eastern Partnership. Russia, with its long history of empire in the region, has not ceased to strive for dominance over the former republics, although in the 1990s it briefly seemed to be coping with the loss of its former centrality in another, less imperative manner. The predominance of growing national consciousness is likewise diverging between the countries. What was the past, as constructed in the textbooks analyzed in the following pages, contributes to justifying and defending these choices. The idea behind the book grew out of discussions within a research group bringing together scholars and researchers from Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, Moldova, and Sweden. The dramatic events unfolding in the Soviet Union during the late 1980s and early 1990s, which ultimately led to the collapse of the Union and the rise of fifteen successor states, seemed to be understood and interpreted differently within the group depending on the nationalities of the participants. Whereas some aspects, such as the attention paid to the last president of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, recurred in many countries, others left markedly different traces. For example, the Chernobyl catastrophe in 1986 played hardly any role in Moldovan memory-making about this time, though it was ascribed a major role in Ukraine. Even more striking, the perceived significance of perestroika and the collapse as such differed between countries. Did they mark a radical shift, or simply discontinuity that reverted to continuity? While in the Western literature on Eastern Europe and this era, perestroika, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the emergence of the new post-Soviet states form a compelling narrative of major historical breakpoints, something less dramaturgically and analytically coherent can be glimpsed in the former Soviet Union’s own historiographies. Were there indeed such wide discrepancies in what happened when the Soviet Union collapsed and new countries came to life that there would be reason to speak not of one but several perestroikas, with particular national flavors and specific approaches to the past and future?\n\nWHEN THE FUTURE CAME\n\n11\n\nNot only did initial discussions within the group reveal divergences when it came to descriptions of what happened, but it became clear that normative assessments of the collapse and its consequences varied just as much, perhaps mirroring, we believed, dominant discourses in the countries of origin. Was the collapse of the Soviet Union an opening for progress and new freedom, or was it, on the contrary, to be grieved as a lost opportunity for future generations of post-Soviet inhabitants who were forced to struggle alone to find a way in a neoliberal world, without the soothing community of the Soviet family? Assessments differed profoundly. Where, we started to ask ourselves, did these assessments come from and how were they formed? Why were they so divergent? After all, these countries all shared a reasonably common Soviet past when it came to formal and informal institutions, and had all endured what on the surface seemed to be reasonably similar processes of radical change. Remembering these historic processes that ended the 20th century and marked the beginning of the 21st takes place in many layers and corners of the societies involved, but to see how the “we,” the state, chooses to interpret and memorialize these transformations into new existences, and bring it forward to new generations, textbooks are a natural source, one form of officially approved guidelines to the past. How are national memories formed in relation to the collapse of the Soviet Union in these country contexts? What do these processes of memorialization point to in terms of historical determinism, room for agency, and relations within and among society, the public, and the elites? These are the core questions that our discussions pointed to, and that structure the inquiries of the individual country chapters that form the empirical core of this book. These chapters focus on the national contexts of and textbook contents in Russia, Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine, whereas the comparison—which the country analyses make possible—dominates the last chapter. In that chapter, insights are brought together into an attempt to expose overall patterns of similarities and differences, particularly in addressing the Soviet past, the national consequences of the\n\n12\n\nL. BENNICH-BJÖRKMAN, S. KURBATOV\n\ncollapse, and the overall themes of historical determinism, structuralism, and agency—and, significantly, whose agency.\n\nA Four-Country Study The four former Soviet republics studied here were all previously part of Tsarist Russia, with some modifications. Bessarabia, present-day Moldova, became part of Tsarist Russia in 1812, but between the two world wars it was a Romanian territory and as such was claimed by the Soviets in 1940. The Transnistrian region was then added to Bessarabia, to form the Soviet Republic of Moldova. The Western Ukrainian regions of Galicia, Volhynia, and Bukovina and Transcarpathia used to be part of the Habsburg Empire until the end of World War I, and then during the interwar period of Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia, respectively. Ukraine is thus marked by historical legacies of different empires and states: the main territory of Ukraine was integrated into the Soviet Union in 1922 as a result of tensions and Civil War between the parties involved, while Western Ukraine— as mentioned—was made into Soviet territory much later, at the beginning of World War II as a result of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and its secret division of territories between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Ukraine offers an interesting complexity, with its present western territories being latecomers, and its Eastern, Southern, and Central parts originally in the Union. The Soviet-enforced collectivization was brutal in Eastern Ukraine, where millions of people did not survive the Great Famine, the Holodomor, of 1932–1933 (Conquest; Applebaum, Red Famine). Moreover, tens of thousands of Ukrainians were later deported in the great Ukrainian purges of 1937–1938 (Applebaum, Gulag). The Autonomous Crimean Republic had belonged to the Russian Soviet Federative Socialistic Republic, but in 1954 it was transferred to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialistic Republic pursuant to the Decree of the Presidium of Supreme Soviet of the USSR of 19 February. Regional differences in the processes of integration into the Soviet Union came to influence the forms of Sovietization in Ukraine, and subsequently shaped the attitudes of the\n\nWHEN THE FUTURE CAME\n\n13\n\npopulation towards Soviet rule. The legacy of these “different” Sovietizations compounds the ambivalence in the national identity of Ukrainians, including in attitudes towards perestroika, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the independence of Ukraine. The choice of the studied countries is not random. Whereas Russia, most of present-day Ukraine, and Belarus belong to the original group of territories in the Soviet Union as established in 1922, Moldova represents the group of Soviet latecomers (together with the three Baltic States and western parts of Ukraine and Belarus), though sharing with the three others the characteristic of having been strongly formed over time by Russian influences. Today, they are all states, formerly Soviet republics, where the historical and cultural ties to Russian civilization continue to be deep, and where the Russian language is spoken alongside Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Romanian. In contrast to the Baltic States, where the strong positions of the national languages and cultures distinguished them from Russian influences, the countries studied here—except Western Ukraine—have historically been much more integral to Russian civilization, and therefore could be presumed to historicize the collapse and what followed in a more similar way than would the Baltic States or the countries of the South Caucasus. The Soviet experience, proceeding from the Russian center, was familiar in a sense, and not alien, to the main territories of the four countries chosen. Nevertheless, they have also been formed over centuries by different legacies, mentalities, and territorial preconditions, as is clearly demonstrated in the individual chapters following this one.\n\nAnalyzing Post-Soviet Textbooks Analyzing school and university textbooks, while leaving aside other expressions of official historiography such as statues, monuments, and artwork commissioned by the state, means that the textbook is viewed as the major socialization tool of states: education for the generations coming of age. What is being taught in these books forms part of official socialization intended to\n\n14\n\nL. BENNICH-BJÖRKMAN, S. KURBATOV\n\ncreate shared values and, not least, shared memories. One of the core assumptions of the influential culturalist theory of how the “soft” resources binding a community together, such as memories, values, and beliefs, are transferred over generations is the importance of early-life socialization (Inglehart and Welzel 94– 135, Lockhart 91). Socialization has been understood as the process of transmitting cultural values, either intentionally or unintentionally. Individuals develop their basic orientations and outlooks in a process of cumulative formation in which experiences from different spheres of life are brought together in attempts to form coherent perceptions of the world (Almond and Verba 323–374). The family (Jennings and Niemi; Westholm 137159), school (Almond and Verba 323–374; Coleman; Eckstein 265– 285), the peer group (Coleman), and media and popular culture (Merelman) are all important arenas where individuals interact with one another across generations, and where socialization continuously occurs. The education system has always been a cornerstone of the ideological socialization of society, and schools and universities play important roles in shaping the minds of each generation. Although the individual chapters in this book do not explore how actual teaching practices influence and nuance textbook contents, they do capture—through the textbooks— attempts of socialization in the making. The question of socialization has far-reaching implications for understanding the processes of social continuity and change, since culture, understood as values, convictions, and memories, partly causes action and conditions the speed and depth of social transformation, as sociologist Karl Mannheim had already noted in 1952 (286). On a personal level, one of the authors of this chapter studied the Soviet version of the history of Ukraine at school and in his initial years of university, though after graduation he instead taught the national version of Ukrainian history. The absence of national history textbooks at the beginning of Ukrainian Independence was acutely felt, and the Ukrainian diaspora and the works of its representatives were the main resources filling this gap. Especially important in this respect was the book by\n\nWHEN THE FUTURE CAME\n\n15\n\nOrest Subtelny (1941–2016), Ukraine: A History (1988), translated into Ukrainian by Yuri Shevchuk and published in 1992. Numerous editions of this book came out during this time. Methodologically, the individual authors have worked within a common tradition of qualitative research, but using different discursive analytic methods, presented in more detail as necessary in the individual chapters. Otherwise, we have generally striven to make the chapters readable when taken together, although they do differ somewhat in their approaches and emphases. Strikingly, the Belarusian chapter contains an annotated list of school and university textbooks in its annexes, which the others do not. We chose to retain these annexes, since they could contain valuable information for those studying Belarus in particular.\n\nCollective Memory, Memory Politics, and History Textbooks When a familiar system collapses and the sense of security and safety shatters, the grounds for cultural trauma arise, in what sociologist Piotr Sztompka calls the other face of social change (450). Historians in the analyzed countries address this trauma in various ways: different countries regard the same processes as emotionally traumatic, but also the opposite, as creators of national pride and sentiments of liberation. “All happy families are alike. Every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way”—Leo Tolstoy’s famous observation is true not only of families, but metaphorically of countries emerging from the breakup of the Soviet Union as well. Although perestroika was a common stage experienced by all fifteen Soviet republics, each of them lived it in its own way. Independence came to them all, but how statehood was incorporated into national consciousness varied: while some new states rejoiced, others were more placid, even ambivalent. Understanding how the perestroika period was interpreted in the history textbooks of different countries should start from an understanding of specifics at the factual level. By focusing on what happened, who acted, why, and for what purpose, and what\n\n16\n\nL. BENNICH-BJÖRKMAN, S. KURBATOV\n\nthe consequences were, the interpretation of the recent past follows a common scheme that makes it possible to identify how parts of history are narrated to respond to perceived needs for continuity or change, drama or business as usual. The following analyses of history textbooks used in secondary schools and universities from the early 1990s and up to 2012 present a kaleidoscope in which the nationally elaborated views of the four countries shift from unaffected in Belarus to euphoric in Ukraine, from frustrated in Moldova to contained in Russia. History is growing in importance in the post-Soviet area, being the tool both to unite a people and to distinguish a people from those of other post-Soviet countries. Two recent examples from the former Soviet sphere illustrate that. Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv included a question in the examinations for the 2013–2014 academic year on the authoritarian regime of Victor Ianukovych. Students were asked to describe this regime’s violations of human rights, the Revolution of Dignity, and the Russian occupation of Crimea, and were impicitly to identify with the view of the Ianukovych government as illegitimate. Also, on 9 April 2015, four “decommunization” laws were adopted by the Ukrainian parliament: 1) On Access to Archives of Repressive Agencies of Totalitarian Communist Regime of 1917–1991; 2) On the Condemnation of the Communist and National Socialist (Nazi) Regimes, and Prohibition of Propaganda of Their Symbols; 3) On the Legal Status and Honoring the Memory of Fighters for Ukraine’s Independence in the Twentieth Century; and 4) On Perpetuation of the Victory over Nazism in World War II of 1939– 1945 (all texts in English are available at the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance official website, memory.gov.ua). In Latvia, the national assembly decided to anticipate criminal responsibility for denying that Soviet occupation had occurred, declaring that those who deny this fact can be jailed for up to five years. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs evaluated this action as an immoral attempt to modify/reconstruct history. Falk Pingel has stated: “Through the teaching of history and geography we create a mesh of reference points in time and space.\n\nWHEN THE FUTURE CAME\n\n17\n\nWhere we come from, where we live, are we allowed or are we entitled to live there? History and geography textbooks attempt to explain our roots, how and why we happen to be living in a certain place and how that place can be described and characterized—in other words, who we really are (7).” It is natural that numerous works are devoted to the problems of textbook research in general (Foster 5–20) and of history textbook research in particular (Repoussi and Tutiaux-Guillon 154–170). Especially interesting is research that tries to analyze the particularities of history textbook narratives in times of active nation-building, when such socialization is “defined and controlled by the ambivalent nexus between ideology and political expectations (that history textbooks contribute to national identity and patriotism), curricula assumptions (that quality history textbooks impact on pedagogical outcomes), and academic rigor and objectivity” (Zajda 185–191). The authors of nation-building narratives usually use history textbooks to promote selfdetermination (Janmaat and Vickers, 267–275) and, in the case of the post-Soviet states, to portray their nations and national histories as the victims of Russian oppression (Janmaat 307–324). Closely connected to the use of history is the concept of collective memory. Collective memory comprises tales of the past that come to dominate or prevail within a specific group. This is an original definition of Maurice Halbwachs, usually considered the “founding father” of the concept of collective memory. The literature on collective, cultural, or social memory and history has been growing steadily in recent decades, and these concepts have become fashionable in those parts of the social sciences and humanities concerned with identity and the biographical aspects of human life. However, many of the contributions articulate little that is new, and an implicit vagueness is part of the concept’s great attraction. However, Halbwachs’ basic insight, confirmed in an influential study by sociologist Robert Bellah et al., that collectives become communities because of a body of shared memories and perceptions of themselves, is crucial and underlines the cognitive aspect of community-building. In their inquiry into middle-class American mentality, Bellah et al. introduced the\n\n18\n\nL. BENNICH-BJÖRKMAN, S. KURBATOV\n\nconcept of “community of memory”: “In order not to forget that past, a community is involved in retelling its story, its constitutive narrative, and in so doing, it offers examples of the men and women who have embodied and exemplified the meaning of the community” (153). Collective memories are individually embraced, but they tell about a collective of which individuals feel part, and these memories are a determining element in shaping group identity. Memories are “collective” or “social” as opposed to individual inasmuch as they are shared by individuals identifying themselves as a group and are concerned with essential aspects of that particular group’s existence: what constitutes the collective and what are its boundaries, what values it cherishes, and what are its significant points of reference. Bellah et al. noted that essential elements of the stories constituting the community identify not just virtues and achievements, but also painful shared experiences that point out the fate shared by the community (250–275). Hence, these memories tell “the story of us” and have to be socialized over generations for the group to survive as a collective. The collective could be anything from a family, organization, or particular neighborhood to an ethnic group or state. In the case of the newly independent states founded after the collapse of the Soviet Union, history textbooks created a uniform and didactic “memory space”—“lieu de mémoire” (Nora)—for the official narratives of the past. In the literature on collective memory, there is a recurrent and often cited divide between the traditionalists, represented by Halbwachs’ Le Mémoire collective, who reserve the concept for orally transmitted communication, and the revisionists, represented by Jan Assman, who reject this limitation and also consider monuments, written sources, and arts to be transmitters of collective memories. “Cultural memory preserves the store of knowledge from which a group derives an awareness of its unity and pecularity,” wrote Assman (130). The major mechanism by which collective memories endure over time is to shape persistent,\n\nWHEN THE FUTURE CAME\n\n19\n\nbut in a sense constructed, identities of “who we are,” “who we were,” and “how we do things in this community.” Multiple voices contribute to shaping historical memory, forming it into a collective resource. Textbooks are far from the only such voices. Family members conversing around the dining table, writers, artists, and songwriters in their novels, paintings, and lyrics, all these are makers of collective memories (Bergman and Jakobsson 61). Museums are important loci for forming, and sometimes changing, cultural memories, telling about the past, interpreting it, articulating views, and making statements. Individual voices and collective expressions intertwine in creating and constructing beliefs and myths about the past, about what happened and why. All these voices can contribute to, and be used in, ongoing memory politics, or politics of memory, whose traces are also found in the struggle over history textbooks. However, textbooks differ from many other makers of collective memory in that what is stated is an officially sanctioned and recommended understanding—though more so in schools than in universities in the countries studied here. Whereas works of art, novels, or even museums in the end articulate the voices of individual creators or curators who say, “This is the way I view the past—see it through my eyes,” history textbooks say to students, “This is the way we should look at our past, and our surrounding world. This is the way we as a community understand and make sense of what happened.” A “we” is therefore assumed to be created. What historians do through history textbooks is, metaphorically, to edit the past, forming it into a narrative of the national collective that resonates with the affections and cognitions of the population. This process is connected with constructing collective identities and incorporating the individual “I” into the collective “we.” The population, not least of Russia, as this book demonstrates, could comprise several, coexisting populations whose separate memories need to be articulated to make sense of a perceived complexity. The textbooks in Chechnya and Tatarstan analyzed here edit the past differently from those of Russia.\n\n20\n\nL. BENNICH-BJÖRKMAN, S. KURBATOV\n\nHistory is the academic subject through which a governing ideology finds a channel to reach the younger generations to form shared mindsets. Textbooks’ explicit function is to form a shared understanding, or “gaze,” of the national and international past in the minds of young people, inculcated within the authoritative setting of a school or university. Required for the effective and long-term stability of society, where highly diverse interpretations of national history undermine community, solidarity, and institutions, a common past is a societal resource of crucial importance. George Orwell wrote in 1984: “Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past” (44). Of the countries studied here, nowhere is Orwell’s statement truer than in Moldova, where the power struggle between the Communists, center/right, and liberals has been heated. When the Communists governed the country from 2001 to 2009, the official history shifted as well. The governing political leaders put their mark on what should be the official gaze of the past. In Ukraine, which constitutes the opposite to Moldova in this respect, the national lens is firmly in place over the twenty years covered. The Ukranian political leaders “controlling” the past, although struggling over political power, were united in their view of how to remember the past, something that even slightly increased after the Orange Revolution in 2004. Any attempts to denationalize the official version of history faced strong resistance, the best-known example of which was the “pro-Russian” policy of Dmytro Tabachnyk, Minister of Education and Sciences of Ukraine from March 2010 to 23 February 2014. Fairly similar, but played out in a state that since 1994 and the election of president Alexander Lukashenko has been increasingly authoritarian, the past in Belarus is narrated in non-nationalist and non-dramatic terms. Political power has not changed since 1994, and the present government encourages stability and continuity. Recent developments in Russia since 2014, including the annexation of Crimea, military support for the separatist movement in Eastern Ukraine, and increasingly tense relations with the European Union, will probably be reflected in future\n\nWHEN THE FUTURE CAME\n\n21\n\ntextbooks in Russia, again shifting the national gaze. However, up to 2012, Russian historiography was open to the complexity embedded in a huge country that must hold together many nationalities, as well as crystallize the specific position of Russia as the successor state of the great Soviet Union. Russia, like Belarus, has been moving in an authoritarian direction since the election of Vladimir Putin in 2000, and no struggle over the past has been evident in history textbooks since then. However, the discussion— pointed out in the Russian chapter—of a common history textbook for the entire Russian Federation indicates a desire on the part of the political leadership to simplify historical remembrance.\n\nRadical Change in Turbulent Times Whatever futures Mikhail Gorbachev anticipated in 1985, when he officially launched the economic reform policies with the forwardlooking name of “restructuring” and the encouragement of further “openness,” the final dissolution of the Soviet Union and the rise of fifteen successor states was not among them. After “five years of luxury funerals,” as people colloquially referred to the 1980– 1985 period, when three General Secretaries and various other high-ranking Soviet officials died (Martirossian 100), the time had finally come for renewal. When the Swedish Embassy in Moscow reported home on 12 January 1990, amidst an unfolding Soviet breakup with uncertain results, the report described a highlystrung and tense Gorbachev visiting the defiant Lithuanian Republic in the process of declaring its independence, trying to prevent the further dissolution of the federation: With emphasis he pleads for the necessity of keeping the union together, thinking about all ties—not least the economic ones—that unite the republics. That the defence forces also have to be All-Union based was broadcast in the TV appearance. Gorbachev underlined that he was the Chairman of the Defence Council. He sought to find support for a renewal of the federation through allowing the republics wide-reaching political autonomy. From what he said, he seemed to be particularly worried by the prospect of discrimination against minorities (read “Russians”) in individual republics. (Swedish Government; Foreign Affairs Archives, 19891991, translation by the authors).\n\n22\n\nL. BENNICH-BJÖRKMAN, S. KURBATOV\n\nEverything indicates that the policies of perestroika were seriously intended to improve the stagnating Soviet economic and political system, improving life for the hundreds of millions living in the territories that stretched from Europe and into Asia. Taking up the competition with the West was a way to increase the legitimacy of the regime. Comparing itself to a West that in the 1980s was glowing with liberal self-confidence, with the United Kingdom, the United States, and West Germany being governed by ideologically committed leaders with liberal and conservative leanings, Moscow had reason to worry. Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, and Helmut Kohl were united in their vision of challenging the Soviet Union, through military means if necessary, but also relying on the attractions of the Western lifestyle of individual freedom and its associated material affluence. The last years of Soviet existence circled around power struggles, attempts at more or less failed coups d’état, waves of stronger and lesser aggression towards the republics that with stubborn persistence, and more and more openly, sought to leave the Union. The three Baltic States, with Lithuania as their courageous leader, played a determining role, and violent attacks took place against demonstrations in both Latvia and Lithuania, with people being killed and injured. Independence movements in Georgia, Moldova, and Armenia met with similar brutality. The breakup process left the Soviet leaders in Moscow trying to manage not only republican leaders with independence aspirations but also the birth of political leadership in the huge and powerful Russian Rederation1 with its growing demands for sovereignty. The open conflict between the elected leader of the Russian Federation, Boris Ieltsin, who sided with the independence fighters in the Baltics, and the Soviet leadership in Moscow put further burdens on the already pressed Union leaders. It is hard to overestimate the significance of the Soviet collapse and its impact on the world in the 21st century. The 1\n\nThe existing Russian Federation is composed by a number of territories, where the Russian Republic consists one (and the major one).\n\nWHEN THE FUTURE CAME\n\n23\n\npolitical theorist Francis Fukuyama famously contended that with the end of the Soviet Union, we were witnessing not just the end of the Cold War, but the end of history as such in terms of one of the grand ideologies going to the grave (Fukuyama, End of History amd the Last Man). The sociologist Zygmunt Bauman in an interview maintained that “the collapse of communism ushered us into an as-yet-unexplored world: a world without a collective utopia, without a conscious alternative to itself” (25). The disintegration of the Soviet bloc led not only to new geopolitical configurations hardly fathomable before, but also to new conflicts and instances of violence that were scarcely possible without the fall of the Communist system. The breakup of the Soviet Union was a historical turning point that came as a surprise not only to the rest of the world but also to many who lived in this vast territory. Several political actors recall feelings of surprise and unpreparedness: Independence “fell” upon them without many plans or preparations for the direction in which to move, for how to organize state institutions and a national economy. In Georgia and Moldova, the ethnic tensions that flared amidst severe economic realities escalated into Civil War over questions of territorial integrity (Blakkisrud and Kolstoe 281–298). The conflicts of Transnistria in Moldova and of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia are today “frozen” but continue to influence international relations and social and political life in these countries. War broke out between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, which continues to be a devastating conflict that has halted socioeconomic reforms and increased military spending. Added to this list is the Russian annexation of Crimea in March 2014 and the violent conflict in Ukrainian Donbas, where Russia has allegedly taken an active role by covertly supporting rebellion. With the exception of the Baltic States, which turned to Europe at an early stage and deliberately tried to shift trading patterns so as to broaden their economic basis, economic and political development has been slow and halting in many of the former republics, leading to a less than positive view of independence. The layers of first Tsarist and then Soviet\n\n24\n\nL. BENNICH-BJÖRKMAN, S. KURBATOV\n\nexperience seem to have generated unusually great difficulty adjusting to modern demands on the state in terms of combined democracy and infrastructural (not despotic) state power (Bennich-Björkman 1–18; Gel’man 455–473; Riabov 30–43). The shift from planned economies to market systems in the 1990s gave birth to a primitive, raw, and often lawless capitalism, since the state structures were reforming at the time and still lacked the instruments, will, and even understanding needed in order to control privatization. Sale of the Century: Russia’s Wild Ride from Communism to Capitalism, the well-chosen title of Chrystia Freeland’s book on Russia’s privatization, illustrates what often went on: insider sellouts at suppressed prices that enriched former state managers, nomenklatura, and Komsomol members in just a few years. The second decade of the market economy witnessed some calming of these provocative, sometimes illicit, processes as regulations began to function, but highly significant economic inequalities without the “soothing hand” of a compensating welfare state—which was present to a certain extent during the Soviet era—are among the lasting changes experienced by postSoviet societies. Many are even worse off economically today than in late 1989, and inequalities have continued to grow, producing a small strata of super-rich (“oligarchs” not least) (Kupatadze 279– 299; Lallemand 61–90; Puglisi 99–123; Söderbaum 10–25).\n\nPerestroika—and Beyond “Gorbachev’s proposed reformation is unprecedented in modern history,” claimed Cohen and van den Heuvel, who in 1987–1989 interviewed the foremost reformers in Moscow when perestroika was still unfolding (13). Perestroika was intended to reform socialism to become more pluralistic, open minded, and decentralized, opening up property for more private ownership, without giving up socialism as an ideology and while maintaining top-level control and a definite central role for Moscow. In the mythological tradition of returning to “the sacred past,” the reformers from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union tried to return to the true, Leninist visions of socialism, including the\n\nWHEN THE FUTURE CAME\n\n25\n\neconomic liberalization of the 1920s, the New Economic Policy. Gorbachev never wanted to let go of a more federative structure, believing that the advantages of an integrated Soviet economy demanded close cooperation in the future as well. This was what radical reformers in Moscow saw before them, and what the elites and grassroots in all the republics were to accommodate. In that way, the perestroika reforms were yet another expression of the social engineering that had been the hallmark of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev’s ideas, which entailed not only economic reforms permitting a more market-oriented economy, but also aspirations for civil organization, debate, and even critique, were at the time, and continued to be, controversial. Gorbachev was a reformist, who believed in the potential of positive change and in the will of the many republics and nationalities to keep the Union together. However, his opponents in the Central Committee in Moscow, like the leader of the conservative wing of the party, Yegor Ligachev (b. 1920), developing into outright enemies as the disintegration unfolded, did not share either his liberal credo or his optimism for a unified Soviet future should these large-scale reforms be put into practice. History proved them right. Gorbachev and his allies had grossly underestimated the forces of social change embedded in the societies of Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and the three Baltic States, not least of a nationalist character (Beissinger, 2002, 47–102; Suny 127–163; Szporluk 1–19). The first signs of change revived and gave birth to ideas and actors that in turn pressed for more, and quicker, reforms. Momentum was gathering, activating slumbering identities and resistance (Suny 127–163). Gorbachev, described as a rational and unemotional man, regarded national identity as of no great importance. He accordingly made a number of serious misjudgements and gravely underestimated the lingering longing combined with frustration among the many nationalities squeezed into the Soviet Union’s republics, feelings that quickly escaped control. Local elites and populations in the vast territories of the Soviet Union successively demanded first sovereignty and autonomy, and finally full economic and political independence. In most former Soviet republics, the former\n\n26\n\nL. BENNICH-BJÖRKMAN, S. KURBATOV\n\ncommunist leaders became the leaders of the new states. To some extent, it was a kind of transformation of one particular system of values into its opposite, from the priority of the international to the dominance of the national. The best example of this is the attempt to introduce a mandatory course on “scientific nationalism” in Ukrainian higher educational institutions, severely criticized by some intellectuals (Bystrytsky). This in itself is evidence of the inherent vulnerabilities built into practices of dictatorship and the large-scale centralization required to realize them. The Politbureau in Moscow was too detached from the grassroots sentiments and loyalties in the republics to be able to assess the potential effects of the reforms that had been set in motion. The termination of the huge Soviet experiment, with its grand industrialization ambitions and its striving to generate a new Soviet human, untainted by nationality, historical specificities, and collective memories, was nothing short of a tremendously powerful unintended consequence of ambitious intentions to modernize and reform that changed the path of history. When the summer of 1991 began, the end of which marked the final days of the Soviet Union, the political, economic, and strategic future appeared highly uncertain for the many republics. Just a few months earlier, in the spring, the Swedish Embassy in Moscow, where the developments were followed closely on a daily basis, reported to Stockholm that “the obvious candidates for secession from the union are, aside from the Baltic States, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, and later maybe Ukraine” (Swedish Government; Foreign Affairs Archives, 1989-1991) The Baltic States, Georgia, and Ukraine shared an increasingly strong nationalism, which inspired elite actions and popular mobilization. Those who hoped for and predicted that prospects, including economic ones, would be more promising outside a future federation or confederation also tended to push for secession, whereas those who regarded the alternatives as more limited instead held onto the idea of a federative or at least confederative structure (Darden 3–23; Hale 57–91). Most clearly among the latter were the republics of Central Asia. In the end, the idea of even a loose\n\nWHEN THE FUTURE CAME\n\n27\n\nconfederation did not survive a Russia that was pushing for independence and renewed statehood.\n\nRussia as the Ambivalent Inheritor of the Soviet Union: The Case(s) of Russia Natalia Tregubova, Liliya Erushkina, Alexandr Gorylev, and Alexey Rusakov\n\nIntroduction Russia is a huge country with many regions, oblasts, and autonomous territories that have their own experiences. The Russian understanding of national identity is one of citizenship in a multinational state that is dealing with the challenges of a global world and is in potential confrontation with other states. It is a civil identity, but with ethnic connotations. The relations between terms such as “ethnos,” “civil nation,” “the unity of one state,” and “the state” itself are not particularly clear and allow for various interpretations. Creating a civil identity through history education implies teaching primarily the history of the state or territory, and not that of the ethnic group as such. Because of the constant changes in the borders of the state over time, it is not quite clear what constitutes the basis of the Russian state itself, what constitutes Russian-ness, and whether it is connected with a particular territory, ethnos, religion, or a combination of these. This is reflected in the historiography of the Russian Federation, where the main discourse identifies Russia as the successor state of the Soviet Union and a nation like others. Challenged by two nationalistically oriented alternatives, an elite-oriented one in Chechnya and a grassroots-oriented one in Tatarstan, the “domino principle” discourse holds a strong grip on history textbooks in Russia. There has been a clear tendency towards the reunification of history education in Russia over time, not least since the 2000s, and the central government regulates how much emphasis is to be put on local versus regional history. The recent discussions of a 29\n\n30\n\nTREGUBOVA, ERUSHKINA, GORYLEV, RUSAKOV\n\nsingle history textbook provide good evidence for this desire to unify. Russia’s contemporary educational system is built on the reformation of the Soviet system. The 1990s was a time of discussion and of considerable change, from critiques of dehumanized Soviet education, to both the use of nonstandardized textbooks and the elaboration of state standards (Dneprov 132–133; Kozlovskaia 4–5). In the 2000s, educational reforms continued, new plans and standards were put into practice, and the modernization of education came to be regarded as a state priority (in 2005, education was proclaimed a “national project”). These transformations gave birth to a system of education that is more flexible and varied than the versions from before 1991 (Smolin 10); at the same time, it retains several features of the old Soviet system, such as centralization and regulation through state standards. However, it does not possess the systematic and uniform Soviet character, and has adapted badly to new market conditions (Kuz’minov 13–14; Tiurina 12–13). For history education in the 1990s, the reforms resulted in the approval of a concentric structure of historical education instead of a linear one; today the reverse transition is being discussed, from a concentric to a linear structure. A linear structure implies that history is taught in chronological sequence, while a concentric structure suggests that the same historical events and periods are taught several times: at a basic level in secondary school and more deeply in high school. One of the main problems in the reforms has been striking a balance between the new values of liberalism and nationalism that should supposedly be able to coexist (Puzatich 6–10). These problems and controversies have become apparent in the debate on uniform Russian history textbooks for secondary school that President Vladimir Putin proposed in early 2013. The discussion embraced not only the textbook contents, but also the idea of a single history textbook as such. In 2015–2016, several history textbooks were published, not the proposed single one, and they were designed with regard to the new historical–cultural standard for teaching domestic history. The debate about a\n\nTHE CASE(S) OF RUSSIA\n\n31\n\nunivocal history textbook therefore resulted in a compromise of moderate unification. The Constitution of the Russian Federation protects ideological diversity, expressed in articles 43 and 44 of the Constitution, which proclaim freedom of teaching and support for various forms of education. At the same time, Russia guarantees the right to education, primarily by means of the state federal education standards established by the government and defining the minimum educational content. The whole set of requirements is compulsory for institutions of general education accredited by the state. General education in Russia comprises primary and secondary education, and the Ministry of Education and Science examines and approves school textbooks. As for the institutions of higher education, they generally possess more freedom in creating programs and choosing literature than do secondary schools, and the Ministry does not approve their textbooks; instead, this is done by specially appointed university committees. At the time of writing, the subject of history consists of parallel courses in world and domestic history—much as in Moldova—with domestic history acquiring more importance over time. As for the textbooks themselves, they are descriptive, yet analytical in comparison with the highly uniform and ideological Soviet textbooks. Nevertheless, looking back at the period around year 2000, there is a clear tendency towards the reunification of education, and recent discussions of a single history textbook provide good evidence for this interpretation. Traces of the same tendency towards growing uniformity also show themselves in relation to openness to regional diversity. The Russian Federation is a large state with considerable regional differences, not only economic and social, but also concerning ethnic issues at the inter- and intra-regional levels. These regional divisions are viewed in terms of center versus periphery and center versus alternative (i.e., regional) centers, as opposed to Belarus, Moldova (in part), and Ukraine with their prevailing east–west divisions. One of the most important changes came in 2007 with the repeal of a law that allowed the regions (i.e., national republics) in Russia to determine what regional history\n\n32\n\nTREGUBOVA, ERUSHKINA, GORYLEV, RUSAKOV\n\nshould be taught and for how long in class. Instead, a flexible state federal standard was introduced that allows 10–15 percent of class time to be spent on regional history. Several republic governments formulated sharp critiques of these changes (for example in Tatarstan and North Ossetia), though it is difficult to say whether or not the role of the regional part of the basic education program has been diminished. Another tension connected with ethnic issues became manifest in relation to a university textbook from the center. This was the scandal concerning Russian History 1917–2009, written by Alexander Vdovin and Alexander Barsenkov, two professors from Moscow State University’s history department. The book included controversial statements about Chechen and Jewish people, prompting sharp criticism of the authors as well as intensive reaction in the mass media. As a result, the Academic Council of Moscow State University’s history department chose in the end not to accept the textbook. Nevertheless, it has been reprinted three times, is recommended for high school history programs, and remains in circulation. Unified standards control history education in the Russian Federation. What do these standards imply? For insights into how they are formulated, the document The Fundamental Core of the Content of General Education (Kozlov and Kondakov) for primary and secondary education is a good source. The document was formulated by the Russian Academy of Education by request of the Ministry of Science and Education and the Federal Agency of Education in 2009 (here we use the 4th, expanded edition from 2011). The main aim of the document is to define: “1) the system of basic national values; 2) the system of basic concepts; 3) the system of key tasks” (Kozlov and Kondakov 3; translation by the authors). It concerns itself with knowledge and values, which means that textbooks should be consistent, both scientifically and ideologically. Supposedly, the outlined values are basic national values that belong to the peoples, that is, to the many different ethnoses of the Russian Federation. Teaching history should aim at developing historical thinking, “the basis of a value- oriented person’s civil identity”\n\nTHE CASE(S) OF RUSSIA\n\n33\n\n(Kozlov and Kondakov 24, translation by the authors). The question is whether this teaching includes the values of certain ethnicities. The answer lies in the definition of basic national values, which only include values that “ensure the effective development of the country” (Kozlov and Kondakov 3, translation by the authors). The document exists to help realize “social cohesion and consent in the conditions of growth in the social, ethnic, religious, and cultural diversity of our society through the formation of Russian identity” (Kozlov and Kondakov 4, translation by the authors). It demonstrates that general education in Russia is intended to eliminate separatist tendencies and create citizens with a national identity in which ethnic differences are even accentuated while, it is claimed, the potential for ethnic (as well as social and religious) conflict is lessened. Furthermore, national identity is understood to be marked by citizenship in a multinational state that must respond to the challenges of a global world and is in potential confrontation with other states. However, there are references to the family as well, implying ethnos in a primordial sense, while simultaneously being connected with the presumably civil “Fatherland.” This inconsistency is more distinct in the use of the concept of “the people” in the document to refer to both ethnos (“traditions of the peoples of Russia”) and the civil nation (“multinational Russian people”) (Kozlov and Kondakov 10, translation by the authors). The inherent tension between civil and ethnic national identities is striking. Moreover, one characteristic of the document is that it presumes value and belief in the state itself, in the “integrity of the courts and responsibility of authorities” (Kozlov and Kondakov 10, translation by the authors), presenting the state as infallible. Finally, the document claims that these values “unite all Russians” (Kozlov and Kondakov 11, translation by the authors). In this case, all basic values (not only those that directly point to the civil nation) are supposed to create a pan-Russian identity, implying that all identities are necessary but that ethnic identities are subordinate to the national one. Therefore, the relationship\n\n34\n\nTREGUBOVA, ERUSHKINA, GORYLEV, RUSAKOV\n\nbetween civil and ethnic nationalism is not as transparent as it appears at first glance. A characteristic aspect of Russian history as a subject is that it includes references to the “history of Russia as an integral part of the world-historical process” (Kozlov and Kondakov 24, translation by the authors) and to “factors of originality in Russian history” (Kozlov and Kondakov 26, translation by the authors). These references imply the specificity of Russian history and its connection with the rest of the world. Importantly, this means that such a thing as Russian history exists. This includes the history of “ancient peoples and states” in the Russian territory, i.e., of “ancient Russia,” “medieval Russia,” “Russia in modern times,” and “the most recent history of Russia” from the 20th and 21st centuries (Kozlov and Kondakov 26–28, translation by the authors). These headings demonstrate that “Russian history” means the history of the state (or territory when there was no state). In the case of the perestroika period, for example, it is not seen as part of the history of Russia as part of the Soviet Union, but rather as part of the history of the Soviet state (and society), because the purposeful narration of various events and processes characterizes the historical trajectories of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the key point for Russian history connected with perestroika is the “collapse of the world system of socialism” (Kozlov and Kondakov 26, translation by the authors) in terms of the “causes and outcomes of the crisis and the disintegration of the Soviet system” (Kozlov and Kondakov 28, translation by the authors). The focus is on the end of the Soviet world’s existence (and not only the Soviet Union itself). The document characterizes the Soviet Union as “a type of state and society” and mentions “the problem of nationality” (in the sense of “ethnicities”) (Kozlov and Kondakov 28, translation by the authors). This corresponds to putting the value of civil national identity before that of ethnic identity. However, the question is whether the “nation” is becoming a substitute for the “state,” no matter what its borders were or are in specific epochs; another question remains, however: What is particular to this state that makes it Russian?\n\nTHE CASE(S) OF RUSSIA\n\n35\n\nTo sum up, the standards established by the central authorities presuppose the formation of a civil national identity of citizens of this multiethnic state through secondary education (by promoting basic national values). This identity is supposed to coexist with ethnic identity, thereby preventing ethnic conflict. However, a more intensive look at how words are used indicates that the relations between uses of terms such as “ethnos,” “civil nation,” “the unity of one state,” and “the state” itself are not particularly clear and allow for different interpretations. Creating civil identity through history education implies teaching primarily the history of the state or territory, and not that of the ethnic group as such. Because of the constant changes in the borders of the state over time, it is not quite clear what constitutes the basis of the Russian state itself, what is Russian-ness, and whether it is connected with a particular territory, ethnos, religion, or a combination of these. The texts concerning the perestroika period point to the end of Soviet history and the Soviet Union’s disintegration, confirming this “statist” perspective.\n\nThe Russian Study Russian history textbooks containing interpretations of perestroika vary greatly in subject, depending on the year and place of publication. To analyze and compare textbooks systematically, constructing a sample that captures their diversity proved necessary, which was done by identifying criteria that are germane in this context. Such a sample is suitable for qualitative research focused on making preliminary generalizations and revealing main tendencies. The first distinction is whether the textbook is intended for secondary school students or for those at the higher education level. This matters, because the procedures for approving these publications differ, as mentioned above. School textbooks have to adapt to the general educational standards, whereas university textbooks do not need to meet these standards and are much more varied in quantity and content. Edited by the universities themselves, the regional variety is greater in higher education\n\n36\n\nTREGUBOVA, ERUSHKINA, GORYLEV, RUSAKOV\n\ntextbooks. With this in mind, we ask whether the interpretation of perestroika in high school textbooks presents a more uniform description of perestroika than do university textbooks. Second, are the high school textbooks recommended by the Ministry of Education and Science more coherent and unified in their content than those that are only allowed to be published by the Ministry? A third dimension is the region from which a university textbook originates. To capture the differences, we compare university textbooks from different regions. Our main interest has been in polar cases: Moscow (the center) and the regional centers of autonomous regions with separatist tendencies (“alternative centers”) are included, as are regional centers without clear separatist tendencies. The question is whether the textbooks from these last centers are closer to those of Moscow or to those of the alternative centers in their content. Fourth, the textbooks’ main storylines are in focus: on one hand, there are histories of Russia (in general or in a certain period) and, on the other, histories of regions. Constructed by considering these dimensions, the sample comprises 22 textbooks (Annexes 1 and 2 contain comprehensive information). It includes eight regional textbooks, and choosing these regions constituted the most important challenge of the study’s design. We decided to include textbooks from Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, Chechnya, Irkutskaya Oblast, and Rostovskaya Oblast. The last two regions are intermediate between the center and the alternative centers, with no openly articulated separatist tendencies. Irkutskaya and Rostovskaya Oblasts are not autonomous regions, but represent parts of Russia that obviously differ from the center. Rostov-na-Donu is the administrative center of the Southern Federal Region and Irkutsk is one of the largest centers of Eastern Siberia. Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, and Chechnya are alternative centers. First, they were autonomous republics of the Soviet Union, and now they are entities of the Russian Federation with the legal status of a republic. This implies the broadest possible autonomy, including to enact state legislation and determine state languages. Chechnya and Tatarstan are crucial for the study\n\nTHE CASE(S) OF RUSSIA\n\n37\n\nbecause they are the most separatist Russian entities, though their separatisms differ. It was these two, as well as Ingushetia, that refused to sign the Federal Treaty in 1992 and thereby did not recognize their subordination to the Russian Federation. In the early 2000s, however, their trajectories came to differ. At that time, Tatarstan was negotiating with the Federal government, whereas Chechnya was involved in a war with Russia. As of today, these regions are entities of the Russian Federation by law. Finally, Bashkortostan was chosen as an interesting contrasting case of an ethnic regional center in relation to Chechnya and Tatarstan. In 1990, Bashkortostan declared its sovereignty, but chose to sign the Federal Treaty in 1992. Among the eight textbooks from the regions, four are regional histories: two of Tatarstan, one of Bashkortostan, and one of Chechnya. Hence, we examine regional histories of the alternative centers, treating Bashkortostan as a putative alternative center. The other four textbooks are histories of Russia, one from Irkutskaya Oblast, one from Rostovskaya Oblast, and two from Bashkortostan. The sample does not take into account two distinctions that could well be important for further studies. First, we do not classify textbooks by the year of the edition (though our sample includes textbooks from 1995 to 2012) because, given the size of our sample, we are unable to obtain valid results if we add one more criterion for comparison. Second, we analyze textbooks written only in Russian even though many of the regional textbooks are in regional languages. However, even given these limitations, inevitable in qualitative research of such a scope, the sample considers distinctions that are crucial for the Russian context. Therefore, it will be possible to characterize and generalize about the narrative of perestroika in Russian textbooks. The methods chosen are discourse and content analyses. The discourse analysis of the textbooks strives to lay bare the hidden logic of the historical narrative (what the authors identify as the “driving forces” of history). The goal is to reveal the discourse(s) of the textbooks studied. This could be defined as critical discourse analysis, according to the classification by Jørgensen\n\n38\n\nTREGUBOVA, ERUSHKINA, GORYLEV, RUSAKOV\n\nand Phillips, which helps in studying “the relations between discourse and social and cultural developments in different social domains” (60). Critical discourse analysis proposes a dialectical relationship between the discourse itself and its social context: discourse is regarded as a form of social practice, which both constitutes the social world and is constituted by other social practices. This method seems to be suitable for the analysis of our data, as it helps us find the middle way between the characteristics of abstract discourses considered fairly autonomous from the social world, on one hand, and the motives and social practices of particular textbook authors, on the other. Thus, we look into complex relations between the textbooks’ contents and contexts. As recommended by Jørgensen and Phillips (Chapter 3), we identify different elements of narrative, topics, and attitudes in the textbooks, and then relate them to the revealed discourses so that various elements can all belong to one discourse, and one element can be found in different discourses. The content analysis mainly verifies the findings of discourse analysis and is used to illustrate it using generalized qualitative data. Qualitative content analysis includes the analysis of definitions of perestroika and the titles of textbook sections devoted to perestroika. Below follows the analysis presented as characteristic of the revealed discourses with a focus on several crucial points: the preconditions for perestroika, the key actors and the logic of narration, the collapse of the Soviet Union as presumably the main outcome of perestroika, and the “portrait” of Gorbachev (as the major political actor). Description of the Chernobyl catastrophe as one of the most famous and tragic events of the period, communist ideology, and the preconditions for separatism are likewise covered. All these topics are sensitive to ideological biases, and illustrate differences in the evaluation of perestroika and of the history of Russia. The topics are highly relevant to the further comparisons of the post-Soviet countries taken up in this book.\n\nTHE CASE(S) OF RUSSIA\n\n39\n\nDiscourses of Perestroika in Russian Textbooks Three distinct discourses are discernible in Russian history textbooks: the “domino principle,” “feudal Machiavellianism,” and the “national awakening” discourses. The second and third discourses are represented by the textbooks of Chechnya and Tatarstan, respectively. The domino principle discourse is prevalent in all of the university textbooks produced in the center, as well as in the school textbooks. In what follows, we refer to it as the “main discourse” and to the others as “deviant discourses.” These labels refer only to quantitative representations of each discourse in our sample, by no means implying that one discourse is preferable to another (or even dominant in a certain region). The narrative of the perestroika process is, moreover, as coherent (or incoherent) in the school textbooks as in the university ones. The school textbooks do not differ from one another in this respect. Histories of Russia from Bashkortostan, Rostov-na-Donu, and Irkutsk—the intermediate centers—are consistent with the domino principle discourse. Among the histories of regions, the history of Bashkortostan (the contrasting case) is written within the framework of the domino principle discourse, but with the addition of “meanwhile in Bashkortostan” to make room for the regional perspective. Attention is paid to the awakening of national consciousness, but overall, the main perestroika narrative is the same as that of the center. The Domino Principle Discourse The basic discourse of perestroika that characterizes 19 out of 22 Russian textbooks is the domino principle. This principle implies that the primary steps in reforming socialism led to unexpected consequences that, in the end, resulted in the collapse of the Soviet Union. The preconditions for perestroika in this discourse are generally seen in the deep and latent economic, political, and cultural crises of Soviet society. The authors typically argue that perestroika was “the last chance for the system” (Danilov and Kosulina 232, translation by the authors), providing the possibility of reformation. The elite initiated the change, but the process later\n\n40\n\nTREGUBOVA, ERUSHKINA, GORYLEV, RUSAKOV\n\nescalated out of control: “perestroika gained autonomy from its initiators” (Barsenkov and Vdovin 609, translation by the authors); “the real power began to slip out of the hands of the party apparatus” (Bobyleva 126, translation by the authors); “perestroika’s results in many ways did not match the original intention of its creators” (Kislitsin 562, translation by the authors); and “the results of the reforms were far from the expected ones” (Zagladin, Minakov, Kozlenko and Petrov 373, translation by the authors). In the economic sphere, the reforms are characterized as inefficient; in the political sphere, unexpected results of the policy of “glasnost” are presented. Unlike in Belarus, but as in Ukraine (see chapters 4 and 3, respectively), in the Russian textbooks, it is possible to trace a single logic driving the perestroika process, a clear narrative that is independent of the individual authors of the textbooks. This narrative proceeds from an all-Soviet perspective with the Soviet Union being the main character, mentioned 839 times in 19 textbooks articulating the domino principle discourse; the next most mentioned term is Russia/the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), with 269 mentions; the United States is the most frequently mentioned foreign country with 105 mentions. In 19 textbooks, the average number of pages about perestroika is about 19 in the high school textbooks and about 16 in the university textbooks. The ratio of pages about perestroika to the total number of pages is slightly higher in school textbooks at 4.5 percent, versus 3.5 percent in the university ones. One can distinguish several recurring topics and a typical sequence of narrative within this discourse. The text is usually divided into a prologue, which covers economic development, political reformation, foreign policy, ethnic conflict, and cultural aspects, followed by an epilogue. The prologue covers events that preceded perestroika and its general preconditions, whereas the epilogue covers the collapse of the Soviet Union, the putsch, and the end of perestroika. Both school and university textbooks pay most attention to the economic and political domains (20–30 percent of the space). The main difference between school and university textbooks is that foreign affairs are much less featured\n\nTHE CASE(S) OF RUSSIA\n\n41\n\nin the university textbooks. Note, however, that the focus here is on history textbooks, whereas foreign affairs and/or world history is the topic of other disciplines. Fifteen of the nineteen textbooks within the domino principle discourse provide an explicit definition of perestroika. The most common or typical definition of perestroika is that it was an attempt by the political elite to reform all the spheres of society. However, three textbooks (Levandovskii and Shchetinov; Levandovskiy, Shchetinov and Mironenko; Lapteva) define perestroika differently: as a stage of Soviet history, characterized by attempts to overcome crisis and stop disintegration. Therefore, the definition of perestroika is ambivalent: as a set of reforms deliberately taken by the political elite, but also as a historical stage characterized by these reforms and their consequences. The latter is the more comprehensive definition, encompassing not only the reforms but also their outcomes and the responses to them. A typical chapter title is “Perestroika in the Soviet Union: 1985–1991,” illustrating that perestroika is presented as an integral part of the Soviet Union’s history. The most often mentioned individual in the textbooks belonging to the domino discourse is, unsurprisingly, the last Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev, with 389 mentions. The second most frequently mentioned figure (159 times) is Boris Ieltsin, the president of the Russian Federation. It is these two politicians, and not economists, writers, or workers, who are described as the main actors of perestroika. Other personalities are mentioned only rarely. Among those who are mentioned more than fifteen times, all are political actors of perestroika or played a role in shaping the preconditions for its start. Hence, Mikhail Gorbachev is the main political figure in the domino principle discourse. The textbooks initially focus on Gorbachev as a young, new political leader in the Communist Party. They characterize him as “energetic” (Barsenkov and Vdovin 588; Dmitrienko 585; Levandovskiy, Shchetinov and Mironenko 299; Orlov, Georgiev, Georgieva and Sivokhina 480, translation by the authors), “active and resolute” (Lapteva 317, translation by the authors), and as an “initiator” (Orlov, Georgiev,\n\n42\n\nTREGUBOVA, ERUSHKINA, GORYLEV, RUSAKOV\n\nGeorgieva and Sivokhina 480, translation by the authors), and point to the wide popularity and authority Gorbachev had at the beginning of perestroika. These are not personal qualities, however, but instead could be interpreted as Gorbachev’s public image, which differs strikingly from that of the old political leaders. Only two authors deliberately describe Gorbachev’s personal qualities: “unusual for the Soviet leader style of behavior” (Valiullin and Zaripova 189, translation by the authors) and “charming” (Barsenkov and Vdovin 589, translation by the authors). Characterized during perestroika by his actions as the head of state and a representative of the political elite, often synonymous with “the Soviet Union” or “the government of the Soviet Union,” he personifies centrist and reformist political forces. Reproached for reform inconsistencies, when the final stages of perestroika are described, most textbooks ascribe a passive role to Gorbachev (though previously characterizing him as energetic), and point to the disappointment and loss of trust in him: “the president chose the path of the observer, and thus predetermined his own fate” (Dmitrienko 590, translation by the authors). Gorbachev’s withdrawal coincides with the Soviet collapse and the end of perestroika. In general, the evaluation of Gorbachev’s image is marked by disappointment at the fall of a potential hero, who devolved from being a promising young leader to a passive and indecisive political figure. As for collective actors, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is mentioned most often (368 times). The State Committee for Extraordinary Situations (GKCHP) is another collective actor, with 90 mentions. GKCHP was the organization that, at the end of perestroika, represented the conservative part of the political elite, connected with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Other organizations play minor roles, and the vast majority of them are political parties and social movements of the perestroika epoch. When it comes to interpreting individual and collective agency in the Russian mainstream textbooks, there is a distinct perspective that focuses on the elite and the establishment rather than also on\n\nTHE CASE(S) OF RUSSIA\n\n43\n\nthe challengers from broader society. It is Gorbachev and the Communist Party that are in absolute focus. Mentions of the Chernobyl nuclear plant catastrophe, which turned the entire city of Pripjat into a ghost town and affected all the neighboring countries, occur in 14 out of 19 textbooks. Depicted as an accident (avariya) or a catastrophe (katastrofa), the tragedy is singled out as the most significant incident of the period. The description of Chernobyl is presented within the narrative of economic reforms (uskorenie, i.e., “acceleration”). The effects of Chernobyl are presented as damaging for Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia (Danilov, Kosulina and Brandt 312; Kirillov 607) and for the authorities’ prestige (Valiullin and Zaripova 189; Barsenkov and Vdovin 595) that caused people’s deaths (Kirillov 607; Valiullin and Zaripova 189) and economic loss (Zagladin, Minakov, Kozlenko and Petrov 371; Barsenkov and Vdovin 595), and became a reason for political distrust (Orlov, Georgiev, Georgieva and Sivokhina 490; Konukov 110). In general, the incident is used to illustrate the Soviet reforms’ drawbacks and unexpected results (similar to the treatment in Ukrainian textbooks, but less emotional). The most often mentioned events of the domino principle discourse are connected with the political life and actors of the second half and end of perestroika. In focus is on the Soviet level in general, the August Coup (putsch) of 1991, the denunciation of the Union Treaty of 1922, and the creation of the Treaty of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The abolition of article 6 of the Soviet Constitution that guaranteed the leading role of the Communist Party of the USSR (CPSU) is mentioned as well. Moreover, the declaration of Russia’s Independence and the parade of sovereignties are recurrently mentioned, and national conflicts in the eight parts of the Soviet Union are emphasized with various frequencies. We note the same focus on political actors and events at the Union level as well, with significant attention paid to separatism in both Russia and the national republics. Almost all of the authors of the textbooks sharing the domino principle discourse argue that perestroika started as an initiative\n\n44\n\nTREGUBOVA, ERUSHKINA, GORYLEV, RUSAKOV\n\nto renovate socialism in accordance with communist ideology: “perestroika was designed as a reform of the Soviet model of socialism” (Lapteva 818, translation by the authors). Later, when the initiated reforms appeared inconsistent and half-hearted, the Communist Party met with growing opposition from liberals and democrats and turned to conservative reactionaries. Defending the status quo, reactionary tendencies evolved, but the liberaldemocrats came out the winners. Portraying the leftists as disunited, almost all the textbooks point to important splits within the Communist Party itself. As for the ideological side, communist ideology itself is not generally in focus, except when it comes to primary attempts to reform socialism in “a Marxist-Leninist spirit.” Instead, the focus is on the rise of new values. In the Ukrainian textbooks, these are nationalist values. In Belarus and in the main discourse of the Russian textbooks, new humanist, democratic, and universal values are reported as having spread through glasnost. Earlier regarded as capitalist and Western (the growth of nationalist values in Russia concerns only the national republics), in the Russian context these values are characterized mostly in a positive way, unlike in the Belarusian textbooks where the assessments are much more ambivalent (see chapter 4). However, some textbooks refer to “the desire to earn more money” (Aleksashkina, Danilov and Kosulina 329, translation by the authors) and “passion for profit” (Levandovskiy, Shchetinov and Mironenko 310, translation by the authors) as a “dark side” of the new values. Most of the textbooks identify the separatist tensions in the national republics as starting with increased democratization and glasnost. The “relaxation” of political life along with economic decline led to more open displays of previously hidden conflicts. Old latent controversies that were suppressed during the Soviet regime were revived: “inconsistency of national policy has generated controversy in interethnic relations. In conditions of glasnost these conflicts escalated into open conflicts” (Orlov, Georgiev, Georgieva and Sivokhina 490, translation by the authors). Furthermore, the hesitancy of the center to allow greater autonomy is also proposed as partly accounting for separatist\n\nTHE CASE(S) OF RUSSIA\n\n45\n\ntendencies, and nationalism is considered a type of intervening mechanism between structural conditions (i.e., the reactivation of old controversies) and the struggle of the elites (i.e., center vs. periphery). Nationalism replaced the “ideological vacuum” that arose in the national republics: the “undermining [of] the authority of the CPSU leadership under the conditions of glasnost” and weakening of [the] impact of the communist ideology promoted the growth of ideas of nationalism” (Zagladin, Minakov, Kozlenko and Petrov 328, translation by the authors). Describing the relations between the Soviet Union and its largest republic, the RSFSR, most authors merely mention the fact that Russia became independent in 1990. Only three textbooks (Semin 489; Levandovskii, Shchetinov and Mironenko 307; Barsenkov and Vdovin 616) provide additional opinions on this issue, implying that the RSFSR was one of the Soviet republics and, as such, was subordinated to the center and affected by its destructive policies even more than were the other republics. Russians were not nationalists, however, and only reacted to nationalist movements in the other republics. Indeed, and interestingly, the authors do not point to nationalist values in connection with Russia, as opposed to the national republics: “nationalist parties and movements that rejected the communist ideology objectively became allies of forces working for rapid market reforms and democratization in Russia itself” (Zagladin, Minakov, Kozlenko and Petrov 398–399, translation by the authors), which holds the values of democracy and the market economy. Hence, Russian textbooks differ from those of the other countries examined here, in that in all the other countries, the textbooks point to national movements within the republics. Boris Ieltsin remarkably personifies the new, all-Soviet democratic forces in Russia, while for Belarus, he symbolizes regional separatism. Therefore, in the domino principle discourse, the preconditions for separatism in the RSFSR and in the national republics are partly the same and partly different. In both cases, the authors refer to the injurious policies of the center to which the struggle between the elites contributed. Nevertheless, when\n\n46\n\nTREGUBOVA, ERUSHKINA, GORYLEV, RUSAKOV\n\ndiscussing the national republics, the authors point to old ethnic controversies that “unthawed” during perestroika, and found their expression in the nationalist movements. In the case of the RSFSR, the authors instead emphasized the economic aspects of the center’s hurtful policies and the replacement of communism with liberal-democratic ideology, nationalism being mentioned only in relation to movements in the national republics. Therefore, the RSFSR represents the radical alternative to reforms planned for the entire Soviet Union, and its position could be regarded as “quasi-separatist.” The Soviet collapse is seen as the main outcome of perestroika in the domino principle discourse. There are different descriptions of this event. The basic descriptors appear rather neutral: the end of the existence (konets sushchestvovanija) and the disintegration (raspad/disintegratsia) of the Soviet Union or Soviet society. However, auxiliary descriptors are also used, such as breakdown (razval), collapse (krah), dismantling (demontazh), and death (konchina). These embed different rhetorical meanings, mostly of a negative and even pitiful sort. Presenting the collapse as the result of a process that ran out of control is common. Here, the interpretative framework still provides some room for different assessments of the inevitable failure of perestroika, and the possibility of the actors changing the course of the process. Were the reforms doomed from the outset or was there a chance to save the Soviet Union? There are traces of two sub-discourses within the domino principle discourse. They are mostly evident in the textbooks by Dmitrienko and by Levandovskii and Shchetinov, respectively. The first is a Marxist-like interpretation of the preconditions for perestroika, holding that the system spontaneously transformed in response to growing alienation: “Soviet man, alienated from the distribution of the produced product, became a performer ... to perform forced labor” (Dmitrienko 584, translation by the authors). This is a classic description of the historical inevitability of events from a Marxist perspective. Although, surprisingly, the author points to several possibilities for elites to influence the situation, nevertheless: “the aspiration to maintain the Communist\n\nTHE CASE(S) OF RUSSIA\n\n47\n\nParty apparatus’ control over the course of events did not allow the making of historic decisions that could change the country’s destiny” (Dmitrienko 524, translation by the authors). This interpretation is in line with the main discourse (i.e., that the unexpected collapse was facilitated by the incompetence of the elite) but with a stronger focus on the objective causes of perestroika’s failure. Here, there are reminiscences of Soviet-era history writing when the authors tended to neglect the opportunities open to the actors. The second sub-discourse points instead to a kind of actordriven Machiavellianism, describing rival, self-interested elites, while ordinary people wait for decisions “from above.” “The main objective was to stop the disintegration of the system of ‘state socialism’ and protect the interests of the ruling elite—the nomenklatura that formed these politicians and nominated them to the top (where the former part of the objective was subordinated to the latter one, and pretty soon the former was abandoned)” (Levandovskii and Shchetinov 311, translation by the authors). History is depicted as a game between political elites in which the people are silent. The logic of the narrative is similar to that of the first sub-discourse, but assigns responsibility to the actions of the politicians. The reforms are treated as a missed opportunity. However, in both sub-discourses the causes (preconditions) are internal, not external, as the conspiracy theories articulated in the Belarusian textbooks imply, as will be discussed below. "
