        "text": "The former president is still moving mountains.\n\nOver the weekend, Barack Obama celebrated his 63rd birthday, adding a dose of sweet celebration to the usually chaotic world of American politics. Of course, his wife Michelle Obama posted a sweet tribute—being married for more than three decades means a few requisite birthday traditions—that came via a never-before-seen photo that showed the happy couple on a hike together.\n\nIn the shot, Michelle is wearing a black tank top with black leggings and the former president wore a black-and-white Sporty Spice-approved 'fit that brought together shorts and a short-sleeved top. They wore matching hats as they pretended to push a boulder while surrounded by a craggy landscape set against a bright blue sky.\n\n\"Happy birthday to the love of my life, @BarackObama!\" Michelle captioned the post. \"Here's to weathering all of life's storms and moving mountains together. ❤️\"\n\nSocial media tributes between the two are nothing new. Last year, when the couple celebrated their 31st wedding anniversary, Michelle posted a similarly sweet message on social media, writing, \"31 years, and a lifetime to go. I love going through life with you by my side, @BarackObama. Happy anniversary, honey! ❤️.\"\n\nOn his own account, Barack wrote, \"Happy anniversary, sweetheart! @MichelleObama, you're brilliant, kind, funny, and beautiful—and I'm lucky to call you mine.\"\n\nBut even one of the most loved-up couples in the public eye can deal with some bumps. According to Entertainment Tonight, Michelle opened up about her marriage during a panel with Revolt TV with Kelly Rowland, H.E.R., Winnie Harlow, Tina Knowles-Lawson, and Angie Martinez back in December 2022. She explained how when her children were young, things were hard. Together, they share two daughters: Malia, 25, and Sasha, 23.\n\n\"People think I'm being catty by saying this—it's like, there were 10 years where I couldn't stand my husband,\" Michelle said. \"And guess when it happened? When those kids were little.\"\n\n\"We're trying to build our careers and, you know, worrying about school and who's doing what and what, I was like, 'Ugh, this isn't even,'\" she finished. \"And guess what? Marriage isn't 50/50, ever, ever. There are times I'm 70, he's 30. There are times he's 60, 40, but guess what? 10 years—we've been married 30. I would take 10 bad years over 30—it's just how you look at it.\"\n\nFor more InStyle news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
