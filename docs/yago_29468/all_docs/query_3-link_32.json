Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1989: Michelle was assigned as Barack's mentor at their law firm.\n\nBarack Obama, then 28, and Michelle Robinson, then 25, met at the law firm Sidley Austin LLP, where Robinson was assigned to be his mentor.\n\n\"Because I went to Harvard and he went to Harvard, and the firm thought, 'Oh, we'll hook these two people up,'\" Michelle told ABC News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1991: They got engaged in a simple and sweet way.\n\nThe pair got engaged at a dinner that was supposed to celebrate Barack passing his bar exam, they later told ABC News.\n\n\"And then the waiter came over with the dessert and a tray. And there was the ring,\" Michelle later said. \"And I was completely shocked.\"\n\nShe told ABC News that he simply got down on one knee and asked. Michelle, of course, said yes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1992: They got married.\n\nThe couple was married on October 3, 1992. Michelle later noted that her husband's vows were a glimpse at what was to come.\n\n“Barack didn’t pledge riches, only a life that would be interesting. On that promise he delivered,\" she later recalled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1998: They had their first child together.\n\nThe pair welcomed their first child, Malia Ann Obama, on July 4, 1998. Her very patriotic birthday was apparently a sign of things to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2001: They had their second child together.\n\nNatasha Obama, a.k.a Sasha, was born on July 10, 2001. Barack has said that he thinks that he and Michelle's love has been a great example to their daughters and that they've turned out to be smart young women.\n\n\"The great thing about the girls is they've got a wonderful role model in their mom,\" Obama told Essence. \"They've seen how Michelle and I interact — not only the love but also the respect that I show to their mom. So I think they have pretty high expectations about how relationships should be, and that gives me some confidence about the future. I joke about this stuff sometimes, but the truth is they are smart, steady young women.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2004: Barack was elected to US Senate, beginning their life in the spotlight.\n\nThough he was a state senator for several years, Barack became the state senator for Illinois in 2014, catapulting the family into the national spotlight.\n\nMichelle was a notable figure on his campaign, but had her own impressive role as vice president for Community and External Affairs at the University of Chicago Hospitals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2008: Barack was elected President, and the family stole hearts.\n\nMichelle eventually helped Barack become elected as the 44th President of The United States of America. Though he had a notable term, he once joked that being Michelle's husband was what people loved most about him.\n\n\"If you were going to list the 100 most popular things that I have done as president, being married to Michelle Obama is number one,\" Barack said during a State of the Union address in 2010.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2012: Barack won re-election and Michelle became an advocate for healthy eating.\n\nBarack won a re-election bid against Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. By then, the couple was a household name, with Michelle being known for her healthy eating initiatives. President Obama noted that he couldn't have done nearly as much in his time in office without the support and guidance of Michelle.\n\n\"Obviously I couldn't have done anything that I've done without Michelle ... not only has she been a great first lady, she is just my rock,\" he told Oprah. \"I count on her in so many ways every single day.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2016: At the end of their term as the first family, they seemed eager to go back to their old life.\n\nBeing the first family for eight years is not always a picnic, and both Barack and Michelle made clear that although they enjoyed their time in the White House, they were ready for a bit of normalcy.\n\n\"I want to open my front door without discussing it with anyone — and just walk,\" Michelle told Oprah.\n\n\"I want to go to Target again! I’ve heard so many things have changed in Target! I tell my friends they’re going to have to give me a re-entry training for like, 'OK, what do you do at CVS now? How do you check out?'\" she joked.\n\n\"All the women in my life are looking forward to being able to live a more normal life,” Obama told Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017: They seemed to be enjoying post-presidential life.\n\nOnce they left office in January 2017, the Obamas took some well-deserved time off. They traveled to Italy, Hawaii, and even Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands, a spot owned by billionaire Sir Richard Branson. They've been spotted white water rafting, on a yacht and even kite surfing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead the original article on INSIDER.
