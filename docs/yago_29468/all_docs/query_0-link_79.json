Thousands of children from military families around the National Capitol Region gathered to attend the concert. The concert featured performances by Miley Cyrus, the Jonas Brothers, Bow Wow, Demi Lovato and Corbin Blue. Country musician Billy Ray Cyrus appeared on stage and performed with daughter Miley. Keke Palmer and Usher Raymond IV also made appearances, as did comedian and actor George Lopez. Both Mrs. Obama and Jill Biden, wife of Vice President-elect Joe Biden, made speeches during the event. The event was one of many surrounding the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Barack Obama."
