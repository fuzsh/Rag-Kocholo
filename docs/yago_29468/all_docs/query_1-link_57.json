        "text": "Michelle Obama shares secret to a happy and successful marriage\n\nOn Saturday, Michelle Obama shared black-and-white pictures of herself and her husband, Barack Obama, on Instagram. In the post, the former First Lady penned a lengthy note, and she called the former President of the US her home. \"As an adult, I've lived in a number of places, but as far as I'm concerned, I've only ever had one real home. My home is my family. My home is Barack,\" she wrote. Check out her post below. (Also Read: Barack Obama posts pic with Michelle, Malia and Sasha on Father's Day, calls himself 'family's designated photographer')\n\nMichelle Obama added that the secret to her successful marriage is their readiness to listen to each other without defensiveness. She wrote, \"But here's the thing - our marriage has never been perfectly 50-50. One of us is always needing more or giving more. We have to be willing to listen to each other, honestly and without defensiveness. Only then, can we evolve together.\"\n\nShe further explained that to make marriages work, one has to make real compromises, prepare for long discomforts, and not glamorize the relationship while dating. \"Over the years, a lot of young people have asked me about marriage. And my response usually goes something like this: You have to prepare yourself for long stretches of discord and discomfort. You have to learn how to make real compromises in the way you've lived as an individual. Glamorizing a relationship while you're dating will lead you straight to difficulty once you're married,\" she wrote.\n\nIn the end, Michelle said people should ask some questions from themselves before marrying their partner - \"What are you trying to get out of this relationship? Have you truly thought it through? Do you want a wedding or do you want a lifelong partnership?\""
