        "text": "Barack and Michelle Obama could easily allow the world to believe their marriage is perfect. For many people, the first Black couple in the White House is a beacon of goals, famously fist-bumping on the campaign trail and swaying cheek to cheek as Beyoncé crooned “At Last” at the inaugural ball. On the historic night he won the presidency in 2008, Barack lifted Michelle up: “I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last 16 years, the rock of our family, the love of my life.”\n\nBut as the former president reveals in his new memoir out Tuesday, A Promised Land, the Obamas’ marriage was continually strained by his political ambition, even in its earliest days. As an Illinois state senator elected in 1995, Barack shuttled between the state capital in Springfield and Chicago, where Michelle was still working in law and caring for baby Malia. The couple “began arguing more, usually late at night when the two of us were thoroughly drained,” Barack writes. “This isn’t what I signed up for, Barack,” Michelle said at one point. “I feel like I’m doing it all by myself.” For two people whose roles would later become so extraordinary, their conflict was surprisingly common: a young couple trying to make their marriage, family, and careers work. In her own 2018 best seller, Becoming, Michelle wrote about going to couples therapy during this era—a revelation that dragged the practice out of the shadows for people across the country.\n\nThe Obamas had a rom-com-worthy meet-cute at Sidley Austin, the Chicago law firm where Michelle was assigned as Barack’s mentor. “She was tall, beautiful, funny, outgoing, generous, and wickedly smart—and I was smitten almost from the second I saw her,” he writes in A Promised Land. They were friends before he persuaded her to give him a chance. An adoring Barack calls Michelle “an original; I knew nobody quite like her,” even if “in those early years of our courtship, our arguments could be fierce. As cocksure as I could be, she never gave ground.” He recalls her older brother, Craig, joking that Michelle would never get married because “she was too tough—no guy could keep up with her. The weird thing was, I liked that about her; how she constantly challenged me and kept me honest.”\n\nChallenges came as the Obamas got married and became a family of four, while he sought ever higher political offices. Michelle was scarcely on board for Barack’s 2004 senate run, fearing the burden on their marriage, the scrutiny and potential financial weight of juggling homes in both Chicago and Washington. “This is it, Barack,” he remembers his wife telling him. “One last time. But don’t expect me to do any campaigning. In fact, you shouldn’t even count on my vote.”\n\nNo sooner had Senator Obama taken office than the murmurs began bubbling about a presidential run, leading to another marital clash. Barack approached Michelle tentatively, telling her a team was putting together a presentation to explore the possibility, including, as he put it, “whether we could win.” Michelle cut him off, her voice breaking, Barack recalls in A Promised Land. “‘Did you say we?’ she said. ‘You mean you, Barack.... This is your thing. I’ve supported you the whole time, because I believe in you, even though I hate politics. I hate the way it exposes our family. Now, finally, we have some stability…and now you tell me you’re going to run for president?’” When he demurred, saying he’d only consider running with her on board, Michelle remained skeptical: “‘If that’s really true, then the answer is no,’ she shot back. ‘God, Barack...when is it going to be enough?’”\n\nAs an author, Barack is very self-aware, even when it comes to the intimate details of his marriage. He writes that Michelle’s resistance to his presidential run forced him to question his motivations and ego. “Why would I put her through this? Was it just vanity? Or perhaps something darker‚ a raw hunger, a blind ambition wrapped up in the gauzy language of service? Or was I still trying to prove myself worthy to a father who had abandoned me, live up to my mother’s starry-eyed expectations of her only son, and resolve whatever self-doubt remained from being born a child of mixed race?” In Becoming, Michelle too wrote of how her husband’s ambition had a way of subsuming all else: “Coexisting with Barack’s strong sense of purpose—sleeping in the same bed with it, sitting at the breakfast table with it—was something to which I had to adjust.”\n\nMichelle eventually did get on board as Barack’s vision became more clear. “I know that the day I raise my right hand and take the oath to be president of the United States, the world will start looking at America differently,” he told her. “I know that kids all around this country—Black kids, Hispanic kids, kids who don’t fit in—they’ll see themselves differently, too...and that alone…that would be worth it.” After staring at Barack for what felt like an eternity, Michelle replied: “Well, honey...that was a pretty good answer.”\n\nStill, there were low moments, even in the White House. Shocker: being married to the president of the United States took a toll. “Despite Michelle’s success and popularity, I continued to sense an undercurrent of tension in her, subtle but constant, like the faint thrum of a hidden machine,” Barack writes. “It was as if, confined as we were within the walls of the White House, all her previous sources of frustration became more concentrated, more vivid, whether it was my round the clock absorption with work, or the way politics exposed our family to scrutiny and attacks, or the tendency of even friends and family members to treat her role as secondary in importance.” Lying next to Michelle in bed, “I’d think about those days when everything between us felt lighter, when her smile was more constant and our love less encumbered, and my heart would suddenly tighten at the thought that those days might not return.”\n\nBy all accounts—and by now we know the Obamas would admit it—their 28-year marriage and friendship is thriving in the post-presidential part of their lives. For a month after leaving office in 2017, the former president writes, the pair “slept late, ate leisurely dinners, went for long walks, swam in the ocean, took stock, replenished our friendship, rediscovered our love, and planned for a less eventful but hopefully no less satisfying second act.”\n\nThe Obamas could have stayed silent about their marital rockiness, letting us all believe they are perfect. Given the undue pressure and scrutiny on them as the first Black president and first lady, who could blame them for clinging to privacy? But in keeping with their record of service, they’ve become advocates for demystifying and normalizing a marriage’s trials. In both Becoming and A Promised Land, the Obamas’ candor and honesty about their struggles redefine what #couplegoals look like—not glossy, uncomplicated romance but an enduring partnership, complete with highs and lows, that’s worth fighting for. As Michelle told Good Morning America during her book tour two years ago: “I want [people] to know that Michelle and Barack Obama—who have a phenomenal marriage and who love each other—we work on our marriage, and we get help with our marriage when we need it.” The dedication of A Promised Land may say it all: “To Michelle—my love and life’s partner.”"
