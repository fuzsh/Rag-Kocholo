        "text": "Topline\n\nA recent poll suggested many voters would support a presidential run by former First Lady Michelle Obama, even though she has repeatedly shot down the idea of a run as analysts and a growing number of Democrats push President Joe Biden to drop out of the race following his disastrous debate performance last week.\n\nKey Facts\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nDespite Obama constantly saying she’s not interested in running for president, some bettors remain unconvinced. Betting platform Polymarket puts her odds of being the 2024 Democratic nominee at 6%—above figures like California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had 5% odds, according to Polymarket.\n\nKey Background\n\nBiden has faced questions about his advanced age throughout his presidency, as well as heavy criticism from Trump, who has repeatedly bashed Biden’s over what he says is diminished mental acuity and physical abilities, often mocking the president’s gaffes. But Biden’s age became a much larger concern among Democrats following CNN’s debate Thursday, when the 81-year-old appeared to struggle to stay on point in his answers, at times speaking incoherently and in a hoarse and whispery voice. At a campaign stop one day later, Biden admitted he doesn’t “debate as well” as he used to, but vowed to stay in the race, even as calls grew among Democratic pundits and lawmakers for Biden to step down. Biden also reportedly acknowledged privately he could drop out of the race if he performs poorly in an upcoming interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, The New York Times reported, though the Biden administration denied the report is accurate. Two Democratic members of Congress—Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, and Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz.—have called for Biden to drop his campaign, while editorial boards of prominent publications like The New York Times and Chicago Tribune have similarly said Biden should end his 2024 run.\n\nTangent\n\nA post-debate CNN/SRRS poll found Harris trails Trump 47%-45%, a better showing than Biden (six-point deficit to Trump), Whitmer (five-point deficit), Newsom (five-point deficit) and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg (four-point deficit). As it stands, FiveThirtyEight’s weighted polling average pegs Biden down nearly two points to Trump (41.9% to 39.8%) in a November rematch, though a Harris candidacy could also present challenges for Democrats. Her approval rating stands at a dismal 37.5%, according to FiveThirtyEight, only narrowly above Biden (37.2%).\n\nFurther Reading\n\nForbesHere's Who Is Calling On Joe Biden To Drop Out-A Democratic Lawmaker, Pundits And A Former Staffer"
