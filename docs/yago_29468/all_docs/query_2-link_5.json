        "text": "First Lady Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama is a lawyer, writer, and the wife of the 44th and current President, Barack Obama. She is the first African-American First Lady of the United States. Through her four main initiatives, she has become a role model for women and an advocate for healthy families, service members and their families, higher education, and international adolescent girls education.\n\nThe People's House\n\n\"It’s a place that is steeped in history, but it’s also a place where everyone should feel welcome.\"\n\n–Michelle Obama\n\nLearn more\n\nWhen people ask First Lady Michelle Obama to describe herself, she doesn't hesitate to say that first and foremost, she is Malia and Sasha's mom.\n\nBut before she was a mother — or a wife, lawyer, or public servant — she was Fraser and Marian Robinson's daughter. The Robinsons lived in a brick bungalow on the South Side of Chicago. Fraser was a pump operator for the Chicago Water Department, and despite being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at a young age, he hardly ever missed a day of work. Marian stayed home to raise Michelle and her older brother Craig, skillfully managing a busy household filled with love, laughter, and important life lessons.\n\nA product of Chicago public schools, Michelle Robinson studied sociology and African-American studies at Princeton University. After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1988, she joined the Chicago law firm Sidley & Austin, where she later met Barack Obama, the man who would become the love of her life.\n\nAfter a few years, Mrs. Obama decided her true calling was working with people to serve their communities and their neighbors. She served as assistant commissioner of planning and development in Chicago's City Hall before becoming the founding executive director of the Chicago chapter of Public Allies, an AmeriCorps program that prepares youth for public service.\n\nIn 1996, Mrs. Obama joined the University of Chicago with a vision of bringing campus and community together. As Associate Dean of Student Services, she developed the university's first community service program, and under her leadership as Vice President of Community and External Affairs for the University of Chicago Medical Center, volunteerism skyrocketed.\n\nMrs. Obama has continued her efforts to support and inspire young people during her time as First Lady.\n\nReach Higher\n\nIn 2014, First Lady Michelle Obama launched her Reach Higher initiative, an effort to inspire every student in America to take charge of their future by completing their education past high school, whether at a professional training program, a community college, or a four-year college or university.\n\nIn today's economy, a high school diploma just isn't enough, which is why the First Lady is working to rally the country around ensuring that the United States once again has the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.\n\nReach Higher aims to ensure all students understand what they need to complete their education, including: exposing students to college and career opportunities; understanding financial aid and college affordability; encouraging academic planning and summer learning opportunities; and supporting high school counselors who can help more kids get to and through a post-secondary institution.\n\nHelping More Students Reach Higher for College and Beyond\n\nCollege Opportunity Summits\n\nIn two separate summits in January and December of 2014, President Obama and the First Lady put out calls to action to college presidents, foundations, school district leaders, and college access professionals, culminating in over 700 commitments from these institutions to increase post-secondary success, especially for our most vulnerable students. Through the President and First Lady’s Call-to-Action on College Opportunity, hundreds of schools, organizations, and counselors have reported that they have already helped students access more than $5 billion in financial aid, enrolling 1 million more students in college, and setting 10 million more students on track to complete on time within the decade.\n\nNational College Signing Day\n\nThe First Lady, understanding the importance of celebrating education, decided to elevate College Signing Day to the national stage as a way to recognize high school seniors making the commitment to go to college. When she first participated, there were a few dozen such events around the country, but thanks to the First Lady and her Reach Higher initiative, in just two years, there were over 1,200 College Signing Day celebrations happening in all fifty states, with celebrities, athletes, actors, musicians, and influencers of all kinds taking to social media to post pictures in their college gear to celebrate students and promote a college-going culture.\n\nPress Release: First Lady Michelle Obama to Host 2016 College Signing Day Event in New York\n\nFact Sheet: Celebrating Progress in Expanding College Opportunity for Every Student on College Signing Day\n\nBeating the Odds Summit\n\nAs a first-generation college graduate herself, the First Lady has a deep and personal understanding of the struggles that first-generation students, or students from non-typical backgrounds, experience when they arrive to college. Today more than ever, more first-generation students are completing high school and going on to some sort of college education. However, too many of them are still struggling when they get on campus to acclimate and find the tools to be successful. That is why the First Lady brought hundreds of rising college freshmen from around the country to the White House for the past three summers, each with extraordinary stories of overcoming adversity in order to complete high school and get to college. These summits celebrated the students and their journeys, while also introducing them to coaching, support, and tools be successful after arriving on campus.\n\n2015 Video\n\n2016 Video\n\nLifting Up and Supporting School Counselors\n\nThe First Lady made supporting school counselors one of the key pillars of Reach Higher because she knows the important role they play in student success. Reach Higher has tried to elevate and support the counseling profession by: bringing the Counselor of the Year ceremony to the White House for a yearly tradition; inviting foundations and thought leaders to improve research, preparation, and technology for counselors; and convening teams of educational leaders from nearly 40 states at national Counseling Summits to implement best practices around college and career-readiness for counselors and school districts.\n\nVideo: 2015 Counselor of the Year\n\nVideo: 2016 Counselor of the Year\n\nFact Sheet: College Opportunity Summit\n\nLaunching “Better Make Room,” a Generation Z Social Media Campaign to reach students\n\nIn October of 2015, the First Lady launched her “Better Make Room” campaign. This campaign is working to reach students where they are on social media and mobile devices, but give them a place to celebrate education and get connected to important resources that will help them get to and through college. Since launching, Mrs. Obama has rapped with comedian Jay Pharaoh about going to college, talked with LeBron James about why he’s so invested in education, hung out with Viners to talk about school, and asked students to text “College” to 44044 to get updates on their phones about filling out federal financial aid and getting other student success tips.\n\nFact Sheet: The First Lady announces “Better Make Room” campaign\n\nVideo: The First Lady announces the “Better Make Room” Initiative\n\nBetter Tools to Make College Choices\n\nThe First Lady has helped students and families make better decisions about making the right college decision by pointing them to the administration launch of the College Scorecard to find a good-value school where they can pursue their educational and career goals while others in the public—policymakers, schools, parents, teachers, researchers—can use the data to help support colleges in improving their performance and serving students better. In addition, the First Lady secured commitments from Google to make over 100 college and career tours available through Google Expeditions, so that students and teachers can virtually visit campuses and examine careers.\n\nImproved Financial Aid Timing and Resources\n\nThe First Lady has helped ensure that more students understand the importance of filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), giving students access to over $180 billion available annually in Federal financial aid and millions more in state, institutional, and private scholarships. And as of October 1, 2016, the Administration made the FAFSA application available three months early. The First Lady held a FAFSA video challenge, spoke to daytime TV personalities, and helped launch a text messaging tool, UpNext, in order to help more students access these critical federal."
