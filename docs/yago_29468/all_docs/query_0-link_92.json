        "text": "Early Life and Career\n\nMichelle LaVaughn Robinson was born on January 17, 1964, in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up on the city’s South Side. She attended public schools, where she earned good grades and was a student leader. She then studied sociology and African American studies at Princeton University, earning a bachelor’s degree in 1985. Three years later she received a degree from Harvard Law School.\n\nReturning to Chicago after graduation, Michelle took a job as a junior associate at the law firm Sidley & Austin (now Sidley Austin LLP), where she specialized in intellectual property law. In 1989, while at the firm, she met Barack Obama, who had been hired as a summer associate. Seeking a career path based in public service, she became an assistant to Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley in 1991. The following year she married Barack, who was then a community organizer. From 1992 to 1993 Michelle was the assistant commissioner for the Chicago Department of Planning and Development. In 1993 she founded the Chicago branch of Public Allies, a leadership-training program for young adults. For three years she served as the branch’s executive director.\n\nIn 1996, the year Barack was elected to the Illinois Senate, Michelle became the associate dean of student services at the University of Chicago. In that post she helped organize the school’s community outreach programs. In 2002 she became the executive director of community and external affairs for the university. Three years later she became vice president of community and external affairs for the University of Chicago Medical Center.\n\nFirst Lady\n\nWhen her husband announced his candidacy for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, Michelle took a prominent role in his campaign. She took leave from her position at the University of Chicago to devote herself more fully to campaigning while still maintaining time to care for her and Barack’s two young daughters. A skilled speaker, she stumped extensively for her husband during the Democratic primary race and then in his general-election campaign against Republican John McCain. Michelle’s openness on the campaign trail and in interviews—she often humanized her husband by discussing his faults—endeared her to many. Campaign aides referred to her as “the closer” for her persuasiveness in winning over uncommitted voters who attended rallies. Her efforts contributed to Barack’s historic election to the presidency in November 2008. He was reelected in 2012.\n\nAs first lady, Michelle was involved in various causes, including supporting military families and working to end childhood obesity. In an effort to promote healthy eating she planted a vegetable garden on the South Lawn of the White House in 2009. She related her experiences with the project in the book American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America (2012). She was also a strong advocate for girls’ education throughout the world.\n\nMedia Projects\n\nThe Obamas left the White House at the end of Barack’s second term in January 2017. Afterward, Michelle kept a relatively low public profile, except for a series of media projects. She released an autobiography, Becoming, in 2018. She won a 2019 Grammy Award for best spoken word album for the book, and a tour for the book was the basis of the documentary Becoming (2020). The documentary aired on Netflix; Michelle and Barack had signed a deal in 2018 to produce shows for that media-streaming company. Among their other shows was Waffles + Mochi, a food program for kids starring Michelle and featuring puppets. It began airing in 2021. Meanwhile, Michelle also began hosting a podcast about relationship and health issues."
