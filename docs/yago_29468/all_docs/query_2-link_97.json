        "text": "Michelle Obama is showing her husband, Barack Obama, all the birthday love.\n\nOn Sunday, the former first lady posted a sweet message on Instagram to the former president in honor of his 63rd birthday.\n\n‚ÄúHappy birthday to the love of my life, @BarackObama! Here‚Äôs to weathering all of life‚Äôs storms and moving mountains together. ‚ù§Ô∏è,‚Äù she captioned the post.\n\nMichelle, 60, also shared a picture of her and her beau jokingly attempting to push a massive rock at an unknown location.\n\nBarack was showered with birthday love from several stars in the comments section of his wife‚Äôs post.\n\n‚ÄúHappy Birthday President Obama!!!üéâüéâüéâ,‚Äù wrote ‚ÄúReal Housewives of Atlanta‚Äù star Cynthia Bailey.\n\n‚ÄúBest couple ever,‚Äù added comedian Chelsea Handler.\n\n‚ÄúHappy Birthday Prez!!!!! Enjoy your day king!!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,‚Äù commented former ‚ÄúReal‚Äù co-host Loni Love.\n\n‚ÄúHappy Birthday President Obama! Best couple ‚ù§Ô∏è,‚Äù said actress Debi Mazar.\n\nBarack and Michelle met at a Chicago law firm and later tied the knot in October 1992.\n\nThe couple share two daughters: Malia, 26, and Sasha, 23.\n\nThe ‚ÄúBecoming‚Äù author has been candid about the ups and downs of her marriage to Barack.\n\nIn December 2022, Michelle admitted during a Revolt panel she ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt stand‚Äù her hubby during the first decade of their marriage because they were carrying uneven loads.\n\n‚ÄúPeople think I‚Äôm being catty saying this. It‚Äôs like, there were 10 years where I couldn‚Äôt stand my husband,‚Äù she said.\n\n‚ÄúAnd guess when it happened? When those kids were little.‚Äù\n\nMichelle said she began to envy the politician when he would find time to golf or travel for work while she tried to balance being a mother and a lawyer.\n\n‚ÄúAnd for 10 years, while we‚Äôre trying to build our careers and, you know, worrying about school and who‚Äôs doing what and what, I was like, ‚ÄòUgh, this isn‚Äôt even,‚Äô‚Äù she recalled.\n\n‚ÄúAnd guess what? Marriage isn‚Äôt 50/50 ‚Äî ever. There‚Äôs sometimes I‚Äôm 70, he‚Äôs 30, but guess what? We‚Äôve been married 30. I would take 10 bad years over 30.‚Äù"
