        "text": "Former First Lady Michelle Obama is not campaigning for President Joe Biden over private frustrations with the Biden family, Axios .\n\nThe family “largely exiled” Obama's close friend, Kathleen Buhle, after Buhle’s divorce from President Biden’s son Hunter, according to the publication. That decision reportedly tarnished Michelle Obama’s relationship with the Bidens, causing her to distance herself from both President Biden’s initial 2020 presidential campaign and his 2024 re-election bid.\n\nMichelle Obama and Buhle became “close” during their time in the White House, often working out together and sharing evening cocktails, according to Hunter Biden’s memoir.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama has attended fundraising events and appeared in videos supporting President Biden, but has noticeably done so without Michelle. She has instead worked on promoting her nonpartisan voting campaign “When We All Vote,” further emphasizing her distaste for partisan politics.\n\nA White House spokesperson told the publication, however, that such reports should not be conflated for animosity between the two families.\n\nThe Biden and Obama families are like family to one another, and whomever made these claims about that relationship isn’t familiar with it,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThe families still publicly show each other support in difficult moments. First Lady Jill Biden this week attended a memorial service for Michelle’s mother, Marian Robinson, a source told Axios. In 2015, Barack Obama also gave a eulogy for Beau Biden, which the family was “very grateful for,” the publication wrote.\n\nThe news adds new details to the relationship between President Biden and his former boss. A former Obama administration advisor last week Thursday’s presidential debate could spell “game over” for President Joe Biden.\n\n“Because, if Biden goes out there and messes up, it’s game over,” the advisor said on CNN. “If he walks out there, and a week later he’s lower in the polls, it’s panic in the party. But if he goes in there and he can handle himself against Donald Trump — a runaway train, a locomotive, a raging bull — then this guy deserves another shot to be president, because that is tough.”\n\nBarack also reportedly Biden from running for president in the past, according to Biden’s memoir “Promise Me, Dad,” and considered former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to be the stronger candidate.\n\nJackson Walker on X at @_jlwalker_ for the latest trending national news.
