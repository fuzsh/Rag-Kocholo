        "text": "WASHINGTON — Former President Barack Obama on Monday delivered the eulogy for his mother-in-law, Marian Lois Shields Robinson, at a memorial service at the South Shore Cultural Center.\n\nThe service was a celebration of her life, according to the office of the former president and former first lady Michelle Obama.\n\nThough the service was not on her schedule, first lady Jill Biden flew to Chicago to attend. Mrs. Robinson moved into the White House at the beginning of Obama’s first term and was a familiar figure to then-Vice President Joe Biden and his wife.\n\nMichelle Obama and her brother, Craig Robinson, delivered a “joint welcome.”"
