Michelle Obama is showing her husband, Barack Obama, all the birthday love.

On Sunday, the former first lady posted a sweet message on Instagram to the former president in honor of his 63rd birthday.

“Happy birthday to the love of my life, @BarackObama! Here’s to weathering all of life’s storms and moving mountains together. ❤️,” she captioned the post.

Michelle, 60, also shared a picture of her and her beau jokingly attempting to push a massive rock at an unknown location.

Barack was showered with birthday love from several stars in the comments section of his wife’s post.

“Happy Birthday President Obama!!!🎉🎉🎉,” wrote “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star Cynthia Bailey.

“Best couple ever,” added comedian Chelsea Handler.

“Happy Birthday Prez!!!!! Enjoy your day king!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️,” commented former “Real” co-host Loni Love.

“Happy Birthday President Obama! Best couple ❤️,” said actress Debi Mazar.

Barack and Michelle met at a Chicago law firm and later tied the knot in October 1992.

The couple share two daughters: Malia, 26, and Sasha, 23.

The “Becoming” author has been candid about the ups and downs of her marriage to Barack.

In December 2022, Michelle admitted during a Revolt panel she “couldn’t stand” her hubby during the first decade of their marriage because they were carrying uneven loads.

“People think I’m being catty saying this. It’s like, there were 10 years where I couldn’t stand my husband,” she said.

“And guess when it happened? When those kids were little.”

Michelle said she began to envy the politician when he would find time to golf or travel for work while she tried to balance being a mother and a lawyer.

“And for 10 years, while we’re trying to build our careers and, you know, worrying about school and who’s doing what and what, I was like, ‘Ugh, this isn’t even,’” she recalled.

“And guess what? Marriage isn’t 50/50 — ever. There’s sometimes I’m 70, he’s 30, but guess what? We’ve been married 30. I would take 10 bad years over 30.”
