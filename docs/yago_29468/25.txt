Barack Obama marked wife Michelle Obama's 60th birthday with a heartfelt tribute to her. The former US president, 62, posted a photo of his “better half” looking radiant in a yellow dress in the sunlight with the ocean as a backdrop.

In his caption, Mr Obama wrote, "This is what 60 looks like. Happy birthday to my better half — who happens to be one of the funniest, smartest, most beautiful people I know. @MichelleObama, you make every day better. I can't wait to see what this new decade brings you.”

Barack Obama and Michelle Obama met in the late 1980s while they were both working at the law firm Sidley Austin in Chicago. Mr Obama was a summer associate, and Michelle Obama, whose maiden name is Michelle Robinson, was assigned to be his adviser. They eventually started dating while working together.

The couple got married on October 3, 1992, at Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago. They have two daughters together, Malia and Sasha. The Obamas' marriage has been well-documented, and they have often spoken publicly about their relationship and the challenges they faced, as well as their enduring love and support for each other.

Last year, Barack and Michelle Obama celebrated their 31st wedding anniversary with sweet messages on social media. Mr Obama shared a rare photo of them together, calling his wife “brilliant, kind, funny, and beautiful.”

Michelle Obama also posted a picture of her and Mr Obama smiling with the city skyline behind them. “31 years, and a lifetime to go. I love going through life with you by my side, @BarackObama. Happy anniversary, honey!” she wrote.
