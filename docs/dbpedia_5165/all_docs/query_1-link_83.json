        "text": "The long standing secularization thesis which predicted gradual religious demise has been increasingly criticized. While the West is generally considered secular, religion has come to feature as an important factor in public discourse and as an agenda-setter for politics. The interest of this essay lies within secularization and secularism. It looks at the various ways in which secularization is thought to occur, and presents arguments against the very concept itself. It is argued that secularization as a concept is too problematic to be reasonably argued for or against. While there is an abundance of literature devoted to the topic, it fails to deliver the necessary coherence to be of general validity. Nevertheless, the subject matter addressed by the discourse is of high interest and considerable current importance. In addition to the literature review, the material of fourteen respondents who are members of secular organizations in the UK is analysed to get ideas about secularism that the literature does not provide. It is argued that while there is agreement on a few fundamental aspects of secularism, the attitudes diverge over the general acceptance of religion in society and the way religion should be treated when it comes to education. The data also suggests that secularism on an individual level plays a strong part in identity formation whereby secular characteristics are contrasted with religious ones to create a sense of meaning and distinctiveness. Lastly, there seems to be evidence that, contrary to the implications of most secularization theories, secularism develops a reactive character that causes it to become more assertive in response to a perceived resurgence of religion.\n\nPost-secularism is a term that has emerged in various disciplines including sociology to reflect the move back of religion in the public sphere and the need to take into account the voice of religious actors in any contemporary analysis of a society. This articles argues that post-secularism is in fact a specific type of secularism that deals with the neo-liberal management of religion in the public sphere. To unpack this, this article will first explore what is meant by post-secularism, and then via a case study on Shari’a in Australian, it will then move to the theory of multiple modernities to underline the relativity of such a term. It will then be proposed that what is meant by post-secularism is a type of secularism (perhaps a ‘late’ rather than a ‘post’) in neo-liberal societies.\n\nThere is a common view in the field of sociology, particularly, and social sciences, in general, that the world, as we know it, is a secular world and the role of religion in the public space is therefore minimal. This view has been challenged by a few sociologists of religion that pretended to see in the appearance of new religiosities and spiritualities, in the late 1970s and 1980s, a reawakening of the reality of the sacred and belief, now bound for the personal sphere and aside from the institutional functioning of churches and main denominations. Some of them have even talked about the privatization of religion and the disenchantment of the world, exhibiting mixed feelings of revivalism and nostalgia. They consider the thesis of secularization elaborated by important figures of sociology, like Max Weber, Durkheim and Marx, historically rooted and discredited by recent events in America and Great Britain and by the evolution of former atheist societies such as Russia and Eastern Europe. Modern sociologists of religion that subscribe to the thesis of secularization of the world, like Bryan Wilson, Steve Bruce and Charles Taylor, reformulated their initial outline of the model. These changes have not convinced those who shield themselves in the essentiality of religion in human society. The debate has somehow become frozen, in the two camps, around previous arguments. This essay looks to portray the evolution of the secularization thesis, taking in consideration other contributions beyond those originated in the English-speaking world. The Secularization Paradigm It was common, during the 1970s, to state that the Western world was more and more secularized and that only a few people recognized themselves as religious and pious."
