Goucher faculty, staff, and alumnae/i may also participate, and should contact Mike Semancik to indicate an interest in participating. Additional musicians are contracted for dress rehearsals and performances depending on student enrollment and repertoire requirements.

Goucher students and faculty often appear as soloists and guest conductors in concert.
