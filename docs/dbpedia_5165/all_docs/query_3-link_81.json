        "text": "The strings program conducts auditions to place students in the orchestra level that will best serve them. When a student is enrolled in the program, a link to schedule an audition will be provided to those with experience. Please visit the Auditions page for more information.\n\nIf you live in Flagler: no. The Flagler Youth Orchestra strings program is a free program offered by Flagler Schools and the Friends of the Youth Orchestra. The only expense associated with the program is that of the instrument, beginner book and your time. Because the program is free, parents and family members are strongly encouraged to participate in the few fundraising events throughout the year so that we can afford to offset the cost of instruction, take care of basic operational expenses and continue to purchase scholarship instruments for those in need. Out-of-county enrollment is available for a yearly fee.\n\nAny student who is at least eight years old by September 1st of the current school year, either living in Flagler County or receiving their education in Flagler, are welcome to join the program regardless of where they attend school. Out-of-county enrollment is available for a yearly fee. Current members who graduate and go to college locally can continue performing with the Flagler Youth Orchestra until they are 20 years of age.\n\nSometimes. Students are expected to provide their own instruments which they can acquire by either buying or renting. In some cases and based on availability, we do provide instruments to families who are financially unable to afford this expense. Acquiring an instrument is not as expensive as you might think, but please do not hesitate to ask for assistance. If a student qualifies for an instrument scholarship, there is a $15 per year maintenance fee that covers minor repairs\n\nWe are more than happy to help direct you in your search for an instrument. There are many companies selling what we like to call violin-shaped objects online. These “instruments” are difficult to tune, do not stay in tune, arrive not set up properly, and simply do not sound good. This can lead to a lot of frustration for the child, his teachers and parents. A child is more likely to enjoy playing if their instrument has a nice sound and stays in tune. We can help you find the best instrument for whatever your budget is. Here’s a hint though: if the instrument is any color other than brown, you do not have a real violin. Colorful violins are strongly discouraged."
