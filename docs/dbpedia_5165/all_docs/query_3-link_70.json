Their subject: the “madman” who has moved into the upstairs apartment of Christoph’s Vienna home. Excerpts of Beethoven’s music are magically woven into the drama as two actors share anecdotes and observations based on true incidents from the composer’s life. Presenting history, drama, music, and fun, this engaging concert is an ideal addition to any children’s education program or family concert series. Discovery Concerts are designed for families with children ages 4-12, but are enjoyable for all.\n\nPARKING: Parking is available in several nearby lots. There is limited street parking in the area. Accessible parking for patrons with disability permits is available on both sides of Myrtle Street and on Congress Street in front of City Hall. Parking spaces are in high demand in Portland. Please allow sufficient time before the start of a show to find a parking space. View more details here.\n\nWHERE DO I GO FIRST: Begin in the lobby to pick up or purchase your tickets from the Box office. If you have already received your tickets in the mail or have mobile tickets, you can go straight into the auditorium. If you are there before 2:00 PM, be sure to check out our Instrument Petting Zoo and Podium Hero!\n\nPRE-CONCERT ACTIVITIES: Come early and enjoy a hands-on Instrument Petting Zoo, Podium Hero conducting lessons, and other family fun!
