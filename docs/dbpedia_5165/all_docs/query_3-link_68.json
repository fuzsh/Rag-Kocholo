        "text": "Beethoven’s final symphony is a monstrous undertaking for any orchestra – it demands the highest quality of playing and demands a great deal of commitment from its listener.\n\nWikipedia source:\n\nThe symphony is in four movements, marked as follows:\n\nAllegro ma non troppo, un pocomaestoso (D minor)\n\nScherzo: Moltovivace – Presto (D minor)\n\nAdagio molto ecantabile – Andante moderato – Tempo primo – Andante moderato – Adagio – Lo stesso tempo (B-flat major)\n\nRecitative: (D minor-D major) (Presto – Allegro ma non troppo – Vivace – Adagio cantabile – Allegro assai – Presto:O Freunde) – Allegro molto assai:Freude, schöner Götterfunken – Alla marcia – Allegro assai vivace:Froh, wie seine Sonnen – Andante maestoso:Seid umschlungen, Millionen! – Adagio ma non troppo, ma divoto:Ihr, stürzt nieder – Allegro energico, sempre benmarcato: (Freude, schöner Götterfunken –Seid umschlungen, Millionen!) – Allegro ma non tanto:Freude, Tochter aus Elysium! – Prestissimo, Maestoso, Molto prestissimo:Seid umschlungen, Millionen!\n\nBeethoven changes the usual pattern of Classical symphonies in placing the scherzo movement before the slow movement (in symphonies, slow movements are usually placed before scherzo[19]). This was the first time that he did this in a symphony, although he had done so in some previous works (including the quartets Op. 18 no. 5, the “Archduke” piano trio Op. 97, the Hammerklavier piano sonata Op. 106). Haydn, too, had used this arrangement in a number of his own works such as theString Quartet No. 30 in E-flat major.\n\nFirst movement\n\nAllegro ma non troppo, un poco maestoso. Duration approx. 15 mins.\n\nThe first movement is in sonata form, and the mood is often stormy. The opening theme, played pianissimo over string tremolos, so much resembles the sound of an orchestra tuning, many commentators have suggested that was Beethoven’s inspiration—but from within that musical limbo emerges a theme of power and clarity that later drives the entire movement. At the outset of the recapitulation section, the theme returns fortissimo in D major, rather than the opening’s D minor. The introduction also uses the mediant to tonic relationship, which further distorts the tonic key until, finally, the bassoon plays in its lowest possible register.\n\nThe coda employs the chromatic fourth interval.\n\nSecond movement\n\nScherzo: Molto vivace – Presto. Duration approx. 12 mins.\n\nThe second movement, a scherzo and trio, is also in D minor, with the introduction bearing a passing resemblance to the opening theme of the first movement, a pattern also found in the Hammerklavier piano sonata, written a few years earlier. At times during the piece, Beethoven specifies one downbeat every three measures—perhaps because of the fast tempo—with the direction ritmo di tre battute (“rhythm of three beats”), and one beat every four measures with the direction ritmo di quattro battute(“rhythm of four beats”).\n\nBeethoven had been criticized before for failing to adhere to standard form for his compositions. He used this movement to answer his critics. Normally, a scherzo is in triple time. Beethoven wrote this piece in triple time, but punctuated it in a way that, when coupled with the tempo, makes it sound as if it were in quadruple time.\n\nWhile adhering to the standard ternary design of a dance movement (scherzo-trio-scherzo, or minuet-trio-minuet), the scherzo section has an elaborate internal structure; it is a complete sonata form. Within this sonata form, the first group of the exposition starts out with a fugue before modulating to C major for the second part. The exposition then repeats before a short development section. The recapitulation further develops the exposition, also containing timpani solos. A new development section leads to the repeat of the recapitulation, and the scherzo concludes with a brief codetta.\n\nThe contrasting trio section is in D major and in duple time. The trio is the first time the trombones play in the movement. Following the trio, the second occurrence of the scherzo, unlike the first, plays through without any repetition, after which there is a brief reprise of the trio, and the movement ends with an abrupt coda.\n\nThird movement\n\nAdagio molto e cantabile – Andante Moderato – Tempo Primo – Andante Moderato – Adagio – Lo Stesso Tempo. Duration approx. 16 mins.\n\nThe lyrical slow movement, in B-flat major, is in a loose variation form, with each pair of variations progressively elaborating the rhythm and melody. The first variation, like the theme, is in 4/4 time, the second in 12/8. The variations are separated by passages in 3/4, the first in D major, the second in G major. The final variation is twice interrupted by episodes in which loud fanfares for the full orchestra are answered by octaves played by the first violins alone. A prominent horn solo is assigned to the fourth player. Trombones are tacet for the movement.\n\nFourth movement\n\nPresto; Allegro molto assai (Alla marcia); Andante maestoso; Allegro energico, sempre ben marcato. Duration approx. 24 mins.\n\nThe famous choral finale is Beethoven’s musical representation of Universal Brotherhood. American pianist and music scholar Charles Rosen has characterized it as a symphony within a symphony, played without interruption.[20] This “inner symphony” follows the same overall pattern as the Ninth Symphony as a whole. The scheme is as follows:\n\nFirst “movement”: theme and variations with slow introduction. The main theme, which first appears in the cellos and basses, is later recapitulated with voices.\n\nSecond “movement”: 6/8 scherzo in military style (begins at “Alla marcia,” words “Froh, wie seine Sonnen fliegen”), in the “Turkish style“—and concludes with a 6/8 variation of the main theme with chorus.\n\nThird “movement”: slow meditation with a new theme on the text “Seid umschlungen, Millionen!” (begins at “Andante maestoso”)\n\nFourth “movement”:fugato finale on the themes of the first and third “movements” (begins at “Allegro energico”)\n\nThe movement has a thematic unity, in which every part is based on either the main theme, the “Seid umschlungen” theme, or some combination of the two.\n\nThe first “movement within a movement” itself is organized into sections:\n\nAn introduction, which starts with a stormyPresto passage. It then briefly quotes all three of the previous movements in order, each dismissed by the cellos and basses, which then play in an instrumental foreshadowing of the vocalrecitative. At the introduction of the main theme, the cellos and basses take it up and play it through.\n\nThe main theme forms the basis of a series ofvariations for orchestra alone.\n\nThe introduction is then repeated from thePresto passage, this time with the bass soloist singing the recitatives previously suggested by cellos and basses.\n\nThe main theme again undergoes variations, this time for vocal soloists and chorus.[21]\n\nText of the fourth movement\n\nThe text is largely taken from Schiller‘s “Ode to Joy“, with a few additional introductory words written specifically by Beethoven (shown in italics).[22] The text without repeats is shown below, with a translation into English.[23] The score includes many repeats. For the full libretto, including all repetitions, see German Wikisource.[24]\n\nO Freunde, nicht diese Töne!\n\nSondern laßt uns angenehmere anstimmen,\n\nund freudenvollere.\n\nOh friends, not these sounds!\n\nLet us instead strike up more pleasing\n\nand more joyful ones!\n\nFreude!\n\nFreude!\n\nJoy!\n\nJoy!\n\nFreude, schöner Götterfunken\n\nTochter aus Elysium,\n\nWir betreten feuertrunken,\n\nHimmlische, dein Heiligtum!\n\nDeine Zauber binden wieder\n\nWas die Mode streng geteilt;\n\nAlle Menschen werden Brüder,\n\nWo dein sanfter Flügel weilt.\n\nJoy, beautiful spark of divinity,\n\nDaughter fromElysium,\n\nWe enter, burning with fervour,\n\nheavenly being, your sanctuary!\n\nYour magic brings together\n\nwhat fashion has sternly divided.\n\nAll men shall become brothers,\n\nwherever your gentle wings hover.\n\nWem der große Wurf gelungen,\n\nEines Freundes Freund zu sein;\n\nWer ein holdes Weib errungen,\n\nMische seinen Jubel ein!\n\nJa, wer auch nur eine Seele\n\nSein nennt auf dem Erdenrund!\n\nUnd wer’s nie gekonnt, der stehle\n\nWeinend sich aus diesem Bund!\n\nWhoever has been lucky enough\n\nto become a friend to a friend,\n\nWhoever has found a beloved wife,\n\nlet him join our songs of praise!\n\nYes, and anyone who can call one soul\n\nhis own on this earth!\n\nAny who cannot, let them slink away\n\nfrom this gathering in tears!\n\nFreude trinken alle Wesen\n\nAn den Brüsten der Natur;\n\nAlle Guten, alle Bösen\n\nFolgen ihrer Rosenspur.\n\nKüsse gab sie uns und Reben,\n\nEinen Freund, geprüft im Tod;\n\nWollust ward dem Wurm gegeben,\n\nUnd der Cherub steht vor Gott.\n\nEvery creature drinks in joy\n\nat nature’s breast;\n\nGood and Bad alike\n\nfollow her trail of roses.\n\nShe gives us kisses and wine,\n\na true friend, even in death;\n\nEven the worm was given desire,\n\nand the cherub stands before God.\n\nFroh, wie seine Sonnen fliegen\n\nDurch des Himmels prächt’gen Plan,\n\nLaufet, Brüder, eure Bahn,\n\nFreudig, wie ein Held zum Siegen.\n\nGladly, just as His suns hurtle\n\nthrough the glorious universe,\n\nSo you, brothers, should run your course,\n\njoyfully, like a conquering hero.\n\nSeid umschlungen, Millionen!\n\nDiesen Kuß der ganzen Welt!\n\nBrüder, über’m Sternenzelt\n\nMuß ein lieber Vater wohnen.\n\nIhr stürzt nieder, Millionen?\n\nAhnest du den Schöpfer, Welt?\n\nSuch’ ihn über’m Sternenzelt!\n\nÜber Sternen muß er wohnen.\n\nBe embraced, you millions!\n\nThis kiss is for the whole world!\n\nBrothers, above the canopy of stars\n\nmust dwell a loving father.\n\nDo you bow down before Him, you millions?\n\nDo you sense your Creator, o world?\n\nSeek Him above the canopy of stars!\n\nHe must dwell beyond the stars."
