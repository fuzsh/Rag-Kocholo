        "text": "Note (August 2021): after a problem with YouTube, all the videos on this site have been reformatted and brought onto my server.\n\nThe aim of The Orchestra: A User's Manual is to provide information about the orchestra, orchestration, composition and instruments, for the benefit of anybody with an interest in the subject. Unlike conventional text-based orchestration manuals, this features movies of players explaining relevant aspects of their instruments and technique, audio clips and samples of the instruments, and illustrative music from the repertoire drawn from the Philharmonia's postwar recorded archive. The Philharmonia is the most recorded orchestra in history and from its birth in 1945 has been associated with new technologies. This use of the internet to convey information is entirely consistent with its desire to open up access to all areas of orchestral life and music-making.\n\nThe User's Manual will be useful to anyone with an interest in orchestras and orchestral music. It will also have a specific relevance to composers, orchestrators, students, and anyone learning to play an instrument. By asking players themselves to explain the nature and technical limitations of their instruments it is intended that a realistic picture of the orchestra will emerge. A recurring feature of the video clips is that, while certain techniques are a theoretical possibility, in practice they are often limited or even unsatisfactory. By acquainting the orchestrator with these, it is hoped that much time-wasting in rehearsal can be avoided! In addition, illustrative clips from the archive give actual sounding examples of good practice in orchestration.\n\nThe original version of the site was created in 2004/5 and is still available. This update was made in 2015 and re-presents the same material in a mobile-friendly format. 'The Orchestra: A User's Manual' is a research project into instrumental techniques, the history and repertoire of the orchestra and, most importantly, into the minds and attitudes of musicians. The research takes the form of structured and unstructured interviews, instrumental and orchestral recordings, historical discussion and musical analysis."
