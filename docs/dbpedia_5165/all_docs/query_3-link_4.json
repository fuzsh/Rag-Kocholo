These grades will be averaged together to determine the final grade. A = 90-100%, B = 80-89%, C = 70-79%, D = 60-69%.\n\nThe following percentages will apply in grading:\n\nPerformance (summative assessment) 40%\n\nIn-class work (formative assessment) 40%\n\nImprovement (formative assessment) 10%\n\nTests (summative assessment 10%\n\nConcert Performance: Since each member of the orchestra plays a vital part, the success of our orchestra depends on everyone attending each concert/performance. A student’s grade will be lowered for being late, talking, improper dress, not following directions, or improper behavior. Performances are required. Performance is evidence of practice and improvement made, and demonstration of learning gains. If a student conflict should arise, parental contact one week prior to the performance date is necessary. . Excused absences of Concert Performance will require make-up work. An example of make-up work would be for the student to make a recording of himself or herself playing their performance. There is a time limit to turn make-up work in. Unexcused absences will be unable to be made up.\n\nIn-class work: Each student is expected to participate fully in all classroom activities. Students must be present to participate and receive instruction; therefore, excessive absences or tardiness may interfere with a successful grade. Students are expected to show improvement each week. Students who do not have their instruments cannot receive a grade for participation. If a note from home is received stating the reason for non-participation (instrument in shop, pending repairs, student injury, etc.), then the grade can be made up. The note will be honored for five days.\n\nStudents who have three unexcused non-instrument days within one grading period may be assigned make-up work or have their grade lowered by one full step.\n\nClassroom disruptions may result in a reduction of the grade as well. Students who are disruptive may be asked to put their instruments away and may be removed from the classroom. Participation is graded by teacher observation.\n\nImprovement: Each student is expected to show improvement weekly throughout the semester. Teacher observation and playing tests will determine this portion of the grade. Practice will be given as homework, and is a requirement of the class. Learning to play an instrument is a progressive study of the processes, skills, strategies and styles that need to be practiced and repeated consistently.\n\nTest scores: Tests, both written and played, will be given during the semester. Tests that are missed should be made up within 5 days. If there is no effort by the student to schedule a time and date within these 5 days, a zero will be recorded in the grade book. There will be no extra credit offerings.\n\nHow to get an “A” in Orchestra:\n\nBe at all the performances and participate during class! Come to class prepared with music and instrument and pencil! Be a team player and make music! Play your instrument and practice at home!\n\nHOMEWORK (PRACTICE) POLICY:\n\nStudents are expected to practice at least 30 minutes each day they do not have school orchestra. Students need to practice scales and also school literature. Practicing an instrument is an important part of the learning process. Class time is reserved for instruction, ensemble rehearsal, and work with instrumental section. Improvement necessary for students requires out of class practice on technique and musicality. Practice is assigned homework in orchestra and is a requirement of the class.\n\nExtra rehearsals:\n\nSECTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:\n\nAdvanced Symphony Orchestra (OSAA Orchestra Competition – full orchestra)\n\nJanuary through mid-May: students are required to attend string sectional rehearsals after school -1st violins, Monday, 2nds and violas, Tuesday, Cellos, Wednesday. And full orchestra rehearsals from 6:00-7:30pm each Thursday evening.\n\nCamerata (OSAA Orchestra Competition – both full and string orchestra)\n\nJanuary through mid-May: Camerata students are required to participate with Advanced Symphony Orchestra in the district and state performances and will attend ASO’s sectional rehearsals.\n\nJanuary through mid-May: Additionally, Camerata students are expected to meet with their section once a week for 40 minutes. These sectionals will be scheduled to best accomodate students involved. They will be after school on weekdays. Conflicts between time commitments for orchestra and another music ensemble at Sprague HS (for example, ASO and Frameworks), will be worked out between the two directors involved.\n\nClassroom Policies\n\nABSENCES: Orchestra is a performance-based and participation-required class. Even when absences are excused, they may have a detrimental effect on learning and being successful in this class. Missed work/activities/concerts must be discussed with your teacher from any absence whether it is excused or unexcused.\n\nTARDIES: You are expected to be on time to class. Students who are late 10 minutes or less will be marked tardy. Tardies will be counted as a deduction from your daily participation grade, and when accumulated, will negatively affect a student’s grade. After three tardies, teacher will make a phone call to parents. After five tardies, a referral will be sent to Student Management.\n\nPARTICIPATION: You are expected to come to class prepared with a pencil that works, your instrument, music and rosin. If a student is unprepared for class, or does not participate or is a distraction, points will be deducted from your daily participation grade. When accumulated, these deductions in points will negatively affect a student’s grade. Excessive unexcused absences will lower students grade.\n\nDaily Expectations: Electronic devices, gum, food and drink are unacceptable in any music rehearsal. No food or drink will allowed in the classroom, except for water. Cell phones are not allowed in class, with the exception of when teacher asks student get them out for specific curriculum-based activities. (like for a tuner or metronome)\n\nBe Honest About What You Know: Be honest during individual assignments, such as tests or reports. Write your own work, present your own ideas and find your own answers.\n\nBathroom passes will be given only on a limited basis. You are expected to be in class.\n\nSprague High School behavior expectations will be followed. Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Safe. If students choose not to meet behavior expectations, consequences ranging in severity may be administered. (e.g. speaking with student/parents to referral to Student Management)\n\nElectronic Device policy\n\nCell phones, headphones, earbuds, hand held music or game devices are to be put away in the classroom. If an emergency arises and a parent needs to be communicated, the student will be sent to the office to communicate with parent. Electronic Devices disrupt the classroom and will be confiscated and referred to Student Management if they are out, or being used regardless of whether device is visible or not. Occasionally I will ask students take out their cell phones to record dates or tune instruments, use metronomes, or use music theory apps. I will be clear about when it is okay to take cell phones out for those educational purposes, and when they should be put away.\n\nPlagiarism: We at Sprague take plagiarism very seriously. Please make sure that both student and parent familiarize themselves with the policy in the Student Handbook. Students will be held accountable for producing their own work and documenting others' properly. See the handbook for consequences of Plagiarism.\n\nDress Code: Students at Sprague are expected to follow all dress code rules as outlined by Salem Keizer Public Schools. Please make sure that both student and parent familiarize themselves with the policy. Students will be held accountable if they are not dressed appropriately. They will be ofered an item of clothing that corrects the problem or will call home for parent to bring something that meets the policy. We need parents help to ensure they are dressed appropriately before they leave home each morning. Thanks in advance for your help. The dress code applies when Sprague students are at any Salem-Keizer event.\n\nParent-teacher contact – Mrs. Rael will contact parent/guardian if there are concerns about the conduct or performance of a student.\n\nRequired curriculum-related performances are: Four main concerts a year, & contests\n\nFall Concert, Winter Concert, Benefit Concert, and Spring Concert.\n\nOptional curriculum-related performances are:\n\nOrchestra program field trips with service learning performance, like Orchestra Chamber Camp and Disney Trip\n\nAcademic Support"
