These chapters-Country Profile, The Society, Government and Politics, The Economy, Military Geog- raphy, Transportation and Telecommunications, Armed Forces, Science, and Intelligence and Security, provide the primary NIS coverage. Some chapters, particularly Science and Intelligence and Security, that are not pertinent to all countries, are produced selectively. For small countries requiring only minimal NIS treatment, the General Survey coverage may be bound into one volume. Supplementing the General Survey is the NIS Basic Intelligence Fact- book, a ready reference publication that semiannually updates key sta- tistical data found in the Survey. An unclassified edition of the factbook omits some details on the economy, the defense forces, and the intelligence and security organizations. Although detailed sections on many topics were part of the NIS Program, production of these sections has been phased out. Those pre- viously produced will continue to be available as long as the major portion of the study is considered valid. A quarterly listing of all active NIS units is published in the Inventory of Available NIS Publications, which is also bound into the concurrent classified Factbook. The Inventory lists all NIS units by area name and number and includes classification and date of issue; it thus facilitates the ordering of NIS units as well as their filing, cataloging, and utilization. Initial dissemination, additional copies of NIS units, or separate chapters of the General Surveys can be obtained directly or through liaison channels from the Central Intelligence Agency. The General Survey is prepared for the NIS by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency under the general direction of the NIS Committee. It is coordinated, edited, published, and dissemi- nated by the Central Intelligence Agency.

Introduction The character of Soviet society derives from the forcible imposition of revolutionary theories and programs, Western in their dynamism and materialis- tic in their assumptions, on profoundly religious groups of peoples who for centuries had lived in tradition-bound ethnic communities isolated from the Western world. Impelled by a dynamic philosophy of history and with a formidable territorial base of operations, the Communist rulers of the U.S.S.R. have succeeded in a period of some 50 years in pushing forward the industrialization of a nation that was largely agrarian and technically backward. This, however, has been achieved at the price of creating a state that controls and represses the individual. Many of the tensions in Soviet society arise from the fact that the regime has forced upon its citizens ways that are foreign not only to their traditions but also to their character. By nature, the Russians are a frank and open people, free in the display of their emotions within defined limits of social control, gregarious and argumentative, and given to passionate discussions of broad abstractions. They value group membership highly and are dependent upon the group, especially its leaders, but seek personal, particularistic relationships. Veering between extremes of work and idleness, deprivation and indulgence, delight and despair, Russians have never been remarkable for the individual orderliness of their lives. It was such a people that the Communists had to ~ regiment. Rapid industrialization required order and discipline, and the Communist ideology demanded t single-minded acceptance of its principles. Resistance led to compulsion and suspicion. Religion was seen as a dangerous force that had to be counteracted. The huge bureaucracy erected by the regime was not geared to offer personal attention. Communist insistence that the individual had and must fulfill responsibilities to the abstract ideas of the state and the Communist Party destroyed the traditional linkage between subject and ruler. Cut off from many traditional sources of personal strength, the Russian was forced to hide his emotions, curb his curiosity, work efficiently and consistently, and be very careful about his talk and his associations. The problems created by the revolution-primarily those of industrialization and the practical application by centralized power of an often inexact and loosely drawn social theory-are still being worked out, and consequently the society is still in flux. According to some Western scholars, the traditional model of a dynamic totalitarian Soviet society pushing forward has been replaced with one of a society stagnating under the rule of a conservative bureaucracy and elite bent on resisting change for the sake of preserving vested interests. But whether \"dynamic\" or \"stagnant,\" Soviet society remains closely controlled. Yet, even though control is in the hands of a relatively small group which is capable of drastically changing policy or its implementation at a given moment, there are limits upon the power of the state over the individual. The sources of these limits are found not only in current ideology and political practice but also in prerevolutionary Russian culture and tradition and in the imperatives of technological progress. No system of government can control a society and remain untouched by the cultural context within which that society functions. Thus, the Soviet regime is a Russian Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 entity and has had to work with the culture it inherited. Indeed, its ability to use the nation's cultural heritage has been a major source of strength. This Russian cultural heritage originated in an agricultural society, considerably influenced by Byzantium, that was a universe unto itself, relatively untouched by the scientific, rational, and industrial currents that swept through the Western world. The Bolsheviks took power over a European people who had broken with serfdom later than any major Western nation, who had maintained a system of absolutist government reinforced by a highly centralized state church, and who had been bypassed by the Renaissance and the Reformation. The isolation of Russia from the West has been an important element in Russian history, just as today the isolation enforced by the regime promotes the goal of forcing revolutionary development on the Russian people. The inward-turning attitude of the people is fostered not only by the policies of the regime but also by geography. The vast plains of central Russia have always been an object of awe and pride to the people. The harsh climate and few roads in the great stretches of plain caused men to gather in tight, lonely communities. Survival was for the hardy and for those who learned that their only hope lay in the physical warmth' and social protection offered by the group. An individual counted for nothing against the limitless and formless plain. Yet those who survived reveled in the breadth of the land they occupied, and Russians continue even today to call themselves a \"broad\" people. The land and the immutable forces of nature were treated as sacred long before the introduction of Christianity. This pagan belief was fused with Christianity and respect for the state. For the mass of the people, God, the motherland, and the tsar became a triumvirate of powers, all of whom would come to the aid of the individual if they could be reached. Reverence for the motherland was effectively used by the regime during World War II, when political, specifically Soviet appeals did not meet with the desired response. The inviolability of the motherland has been a source of strength for any regime seeking to defend Russia against invasion. The primary units of allegiance in prerevolutionary Russia, apart from the country and the tsar, were the household, and the communal village or mir. The household was headed by a patriarch whose rule was absolute. The village elder, along with the mir council, was responsible for the periodic redistribution of the land, which was allotted to the household units on the basis of need. The elder's power derived from the community. Leadership was not sought; it was considered a burden. All decisions were made unanimously, on the basis of consensus without a vote, and once reached had the moral force of law and an aura of sanctity. Since decisionmaking depended on the absence of open disagreement, there was tremendous social pressure upon individuals to go along with the group. No provision was made in the mir for a dissenting minority or a loyal opposition. The origins of the present-day Soviet stress on. \"mass participation\" may be traced in part to the councils of the mir. Lenin and the Bolsheviks sought to remake the Russian people according to the theories of Karl Marx, but Marx had envisaged the socialist revolution taking place in a society with a developed capitalist industrial economy. The main necessity in Lenin's plan for a direct transition to socialism, therefore, was industrial development. Indeed, the Bolsheviks displayed a simplistic.. faith in the liberating and rationalizing power of secular industrial society once it was rid of the \"fetters\" of private property. With this faith went a corresponding contempt for what Marx and Engels in the Communist Manifesto called the \"idiocy of rural life.\" The peasant was to be recast in the mold of the urban worker. Rationality, science, and progress, defined in material terms, were to replace the static and traditionalist bias of the peasant world with its reliance on magic and religion. According to Marx, all social and cultural phenomena were seen as a \"superstructure\" dependent on and largely shaped by the economic base of society. The government itself, literature, the arts, science, the means of communication, morality, religion, and the family all were either products of this base or the servants of those who controlled the means of production. In conformity with this doctrine, all existing institutions would either disappear or have to be radically changed as the economic base itself changed from a system of capitalist exploitation to one controlled by the proletariat. As interpreted by Lenin, revolutionary Marxism held the promise of a paradise on earth. The new regime, as the precursor of a worldwide proletarian revolution, was \"in step with history\" and would lead the Soviet people to new greatness. Once the society was fully industrialized and all vestiges of capitalism were destroyed, the people would take over the going industrial plant and, as there would no longer be a need for repressive political controls, the state itself Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 would \"wither away.\" A classless society would emerge, operating under the slogan \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.\" The planning that became an essential part of the scheme of things after 1928 followed a period of much trial and error. Centralization of production inevitably brought into being a complex bureaucratic machinery. Rapid industrialization required broad integration of the economy and forced sacrifices on the part of the masses, who were considered not yet able or willing to think in terms of ultimate, common goals. Moreover, support of the new order was not universal and spontaneous, and resistance was not limited just to those who had been \"in control of the means of production.\" Even \"backward elements\" among the industrial workers resisted. The real masses, the peasantry, were left relatively free at first but, as a result of the forced collectivization drive initiated by the First Five-Year Plan, they found themselves being reduced to a state as miserable as that from which they had begun to emerge. Proceeding on the premise that its program must be pushed, whatever the resistance and the human toll, the regime developed an extensive police system to eliminate any possible disaffection or subversion. The political police enjoyed arbitrary and extralegal powers of arrest and conviction and thus became a source of terror for the majority of the people, despite their traditional acceptance of strong central authority. The regime also developed \"mass participation\" as a means of exerting constant social pressure on the people for increased industrial and agricultural production and for positive support of their policies. The withholding of approval because of apathy or indifference was interpreted by the authorities as hostility or even subversion. Following the death of Stalin, a gradual relaxation of internal controls and pressures on the individual ensued, particularly after Khrushchev's denunciation at a closed party meeting of Stalin's excesses. The demands of an industrial society for order and predictability in life, as well as the emergence of an established upper class with a vested interest in the system and in the maintenance of its favored position, have tended to push the regime away from punitive, terroristic, and negative controls in favor of incentives, exhortation, and orderly legal procedures. The problem of when to have recourse to intimidation and when to adhere to legal methods has been a continual source of difficulty. B. Structure and characteristics society of the 1. Ethnic composition Although Russians comprise a majority of the Soviet population and are predominant in national life, the population of the U.S.S.R. is marked by striking ethnic and linguistic diversity. According to the Academy of Sciences, there are 169 different ethnic groups, or \"nationalities,\" representing a number of basic racial or linguistic stocks. Twenty-two of these groups number in excess of 1 million (Figure 1). Most of the other groups are quite small, however, and are in the process, or face the eventual possibility, of being assimilated by a larger group, particularly the Russians. Official regime policy has always been to enable all ethnic groups to achieve literacy in their own language and to promote their own culture within the framework laid down by the Communist Party. It has also been policy to convert all nationalities to Marxism and to attract members of all groups to the party. Cultural autonomy, as well as proportional representation for minorities in all-union political and social institutions, generally has served to alleviate tensions that could cause serious disruption within the nation. Moreover, potential leaders of the various ethnic communities continually are being lured by the advantages which conformity to Soviet norms offers, leaving the masses largely inarticulate. The distribution of the various nationalities reveals that the Russians occupy primarily the heartland of the U.S.S.R., while the non-Russian groups are concentrated chiefly in borderland areas, primarily in union republics other than the R.S.F.S.R. (Figure 2). The western border area, from the Arctic coast southward, is inhabited mainly by Karelians, Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Belorussians, Ukrainians, and Moldavians, with the major exception of Murmanskaya Oblast, the Lake Ladoga region, and Kaliningradskaya Oblast, which are predominantly Russian. The southern border region, from west to east, is occupied by Ukrainians along the northern coast of the Black Sea; Georgians, Armenians, Azerbaidzhani, and other smaller groups in the Caucasus region; and Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tadzhiks, Kirgiz, and Kazakhs in Central Asia. Along the Siberian-Chinese border, Russians predominate, but there are significant pockets of Altays, Tuvinians, and Buryats. Much of the Pacific coast area of Asiatic Russia and most of the Arctic littoral are inhabited, Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 POPULATION PERCENT DISTRIBUTION PERCENT CHANGE, ETHNIC GROUP 1959 1970 1959 1970 1959-70 Russian ...................... 114,114 Ukrainian .................... 37,253 Uzbek ....................... 6,015 Belorussian ................... 7,913 Tatar ........................ 4,968 Kazakh ...................... 3,622 Azerbaidzhani ................. 2,940 Armenian .................... 2,787 Georgian ..................... 2,692 Moldavian .................... 2,214 Lithuanian ................... 2,326 Jewish ....................... 2,268 Tadzhik ...................... 1,397 German ...................... 1,620 Chuvash ..................... 1,470 Turkmen ..................... 1,002 Kirgiz ........................ 969 Latvian ...................... 1,400 Mordvin ..................... 1,285 Bashkir ...................... 989 Polish ........................ 1,380 Estonian ..................... 989 Other* ....................... 7,214 129,015 54.6 53.4 13.1 40,753 17.8 16.9 9.4 9,195 2.9 3.8 52.9 9,052 3.8 3.8 14.4 5,931 2.4 2.4 19.4 5,299 1.7 2.2 46.3 4,380 1.4 1.8 49.0 3,559 1.3 1.5 27.7 3,245 1.3 1.3 20.5 2,698 1.0 1.1 21.9 2,665 1.1 1.1 14.6 2,151 1.1 0.9 - 5.2 2,136 0.7 0.9 52.9 1,846 0.8 0.8 14.0 1,694 0.7 0.7 15.2 1,525 0.5 0.6 52.2 1,452 0.5 0.6 49.8 1,430 0.7 0.6 2.1 1,263 0.6 0.5 -1.7. 1,240 0.5 0.5 25.4 1,167 0.7 0.5 - 15.4 1,007 0.5 0.4 1.8 9,017 3.4 3.7 .12.5 NOTE-A minus (-) sign denotes a decrease. *Includes 147 officially distinct groups ranging in size in 1970 from 704,000 (Udmurts) down to a few hundred. albeit sparsely, by the primitive peoples of the North, Siberia, and the Far East, interspersed with Russians. Numbering 129 million in 1970, the Russians, or Great Russians, are by far the largest of Soviet ethnic groups. The second largest of the groups are the Ukrainians who, totaling nearly 41 million, are concentrated southwest of the Russians. North of the Ukrainians and west of the Russians are the Belorussians, or White Russians, who numbered slightly more than 9 million in 1970 and are the fourth largest ethnic community. The Russians, Ukrainians, and Belorussians are all of Slavic origin, speak closely related languages, were converted to Christianity in the 10th century, and trace their early history to the medieval principality known as Kiyevan Rus. All were overrun by the Mongol hordes in the 13th century, but thereafter the course of their histories diverged. Among Ukrainians in particular, this divergence has been reflected in a distinct national consciousness that separates them from the Russians and has not yet been erased despite continuing efforts of the regime. Other groups of Slavic peoples are also found in the U.S.S.R. The largest of these are the Poles (1.2 million), of whom about half live in Lithuania or Belorussia and others in Kazakhstan. Additional Slavic peoples include Bulgars (351,000), Czechs (21,000), and Slovaks (12,000). All together, persons of Slavic origin accounted for three-fourths of the total Soviet population in 1970. Aside from the Slavs, the largest bloc of nationalities is that comprised of Turkic-speaking peoples who, in the aggregate, make up about 13% of the population. These include, among others, the Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Kirgiz, and Turkmen of Central Asia; the Azer- baidzhani of the Caucasus; the Bashkirs, Chuvashes, and Tatars of the Volga valley; and the Tuvinians and Yakuts of Siberia. With few exceptions, e.g., the Chuvashes and the Yakuts, the Turkic-speaking peoples of the Soviet Union are Muslims. The Uzbeks, numbering 9.2 million in 1970, are the most numerous of the Turkic peoples and the third largest nationality in the country. Seven other Turkic groups number in excess of 1 million. 25X1 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 CJ?Qoo ? 0p 0 Riga.( ,ANSA ...:/ AN eningrad e MOSCOw?

As of 1970, there were 2.1 million Tadzhiks, living in an area bordering on Afghanistan. Some other small related groups are found in the Pamirs and in the Caucasus. A number of diverse peoples speaking languages that, with the exception of Armenian and Ossetian, have no known relationships to languages elsewhere in the world, inhabit part of the Caucasus, the region of hills and high mountains between the Black ;Sea and the Caspian Sea. Collectively, the term \"Caucasian\" has been applied to these peoples. The two most important Caucasian peoples are the Armenians and Georgians, who are culturally and racially but not linguistically related. Speaking an Indo-European tongue, the Armenians numbered 3.6 million persons in 1970 and are part of a larger group whose members live in other parts of the world, especially the United States and the Middle East. The Georgians totaled 3.2 million. Other Caucasian peoples include the Chechens, Ossetians (who speak an Indo-European tongue), Circassians (some known locally as Kabardians and others as Adighe), and Ingush, plus some 40 smaller groups living in the mountains, particularly in the remarkably diverse Dagestan, where there are no.less than 30 different nationalities. Among the non-Slavic peoples along the western border of the Soviet Union are the Moldavians, Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians. The Mol- davians, who numbered 2.7 million in 1970, live in the area formerly known as Bessarabia, annexed from Romania in 1940. They are practically identical with Romanians and their language, a Romance tongue, is indistinguishable from Romanian except for the fact that it is now written in the Cyrillic alphabet rather than the Roman one. In 1970, an additional 119,000 persons identified themselves as Romanians. Lithuanians and Latvians, numbering 2.7 million and 1.4 million, respectively, in 1970, comprise the majority ethnic communities in two of the three Baltic republics. They speak very old Indo-European languages. Along with Estonians, with whom they differ mainly linguistically, they are among the most Westernized of the Soviet peoples. The Estonians, totaling 1 million in 1970, occupy the northernmost of the Baltic republics. They speak a Uralic language akin to Finnish. Other Soviet peoples speaking Uralic tongues include the Mordvins (1.3 million), Udmurts (704,000), Mari (599,000), Komi (322,000), and such smaller groups as the Permyak, Karelians, and Finns. Most of these peoples live adjacent to or among the Russians, and most are rapidly being assimilated into the Russian majority. A number of small groups speak Altaic tongues other than Turkic; these languages are believed to be distantly related to those of the Uralic peoples. Included among these small Altaic groups are the Kalmyks and Buryats, both Mongolian peoples. The former live in the steppes of the lower Volga, the latter in areas near Lake Baikal. Also classified as Altaic peoples are some of those whom Soviet authorities refer to as peoples of the North, Siberia, and the Far East. These include the Evenki, Eveny, Khanty, Mansi, Nentsy, and Nganasany. Other small groups of peoples of the North, Siberia, and the Far East are classified as Paleo-Siberian peoples and are among the least advanced of all Soviet residents. Principal among the Paleo-Siberians are the Chukchi, Koryak, and Nivkhi. In addition to Poles, Bulgars, Moldavians (Romanians), and Finns, several other nationality groups are extensions of peoples residing in independent states outside the U.S.S.R. These include Germans, Jews, Greeks, and Hungarians. Within the Soviet Union, only the Germans and Jews are numerically important. The German community, numbering 1.8 million in 1970, represents the descendants of German immigrants of an earlier period. Prior to World War II, they were resident in the Ukraine, the North Caucasus, and along the Volga. Exiled to Central Asia and Siberia after the German attack in 1941, they now live scattered about the nation, but mainly in areas east of the Urals. The 2.1 million Jews reported in 1970 are mainly an urban people. Centers of Jewish population include Baku, Kharkov,' Kiyev, Leningrad, Minsk, Moscow, Odessa, Riga, Rostov, Sverdlovsk, Tashkent, and Tiflis. The total number of Russians increased slightly less rapidly during the 1959-70 intercensal period than the population as a whole and therefore the proportion of Russians in the total population declined. Nonethe- less, Russians still constituted a majority (53.4%) of all Soviet peoples. The other two principal Slavic groups-the Ukrainians and Belorussians-also grew less rapidly than the total. Significant increases in the number and proportion of Kazakhs and other ethnic groups in the Central Asian republics bear witness to high growth rates in these areas. Seven of the ethnic groups listed in the census results showed a decrease in number between 1959 and 1970. For five of these groups-Mordvins, Karelians, Finns, Czechs, and Slovaks-the numerical decrease was quite small and probably resulted from assimilation, high mortality among an aging group of people, or a 'For diacritics on place names, see the list of names at the end of this chapter.

The largest decrease shown was for Poles, who dropped by 213,000, or more than 15%. All the factors listed above, as well as emigration to Poland, probably were instrumental in this decline. The decline of 117,000, or 5.2%, in the number of Jews during the intercensal period is of particular note, given the continuing controversy over their status in Soviet society. Inasmuch as emigration of Jews during the 1950-69 period has been estimated at only 15,000, the most plausible explanation for the lower total in 1970 is assimilation or expediency. An analysis of the 1970 ethnic composition of the constituent republics (Figure 3) shows that, with two exceptions, the basic group, i.e., the one for whom the republic is named, constituted a majority within the republic. In Kazakhstan and Kirgiziya, however, the basic group did not account for half the population, and in Kazakhstan there were more Russians than Kazakhs. The number of Russians increased during the intercensal period in all republics but Georgia. Outside the R. S. F. S. R., this increase was largest in the Ukraine (2,035,000), followed by that in Kazakhstan (.1,550,000). Nonetheless, the proportion of the basic ethnic group decreased significantly in only two of the non-Russian republics. In Estonia, the proportion of Estonians in the total population declined from 74.6% in 1959 to 68.2% in 1970; in Latvia, the decline in the proportion of Latvians was from 62.0% to 56.8%. The decrease in both instances was the result not only of Russian in-migration, but also of the fact that the natural increase of the Russian minority in the two republics is higher than that of the indigenous ethnic group. Aside from these two exceptions, the proportion of the basic nationality in the various republics either declined by an insubstantial amount or actually increased. Even in the case of Kazakhstan, which experienced a heavy in-migration of Russians and other Slavs, in the 1959-70 period, the proportion of Kazakhs in the population rose. Two main factors explain the ability of most of the non-Russian republics to retain their ethnic identity in the face of in-migration by Slavs, especially Russians. The most important of these is the higher rate of natural increase among many non-Russian nationali- ties, as compared with that of the Russians. Even though large numbers of Russians have continued to migrate to republics other than the R.S.F.S.R., the frequently higher natural increase of the indigenous population, particularly the Turkic-speaking national- ities and the Armenians, has reduced or eliminated the effect of this in-migration. A second factor of importance in some republics has been the reinforcement of the basic ethnic group through immigration from abroad. Since the 1959 census, for example, an estimated 75,000 to 100,000 Kazakhs and Uighurs have immigrated into Central Asia from the People's Republic of China, while 10,000 to 20,000 Armenians have moved into the Armenian S.S.R., primarily from the Middle East. Russians are found in number in all of the union republics. The smaller ethnic groups in whose names republics have been established tend on the whole, to be less widely distributed. They are heavily concentrated, with one exception, in a single republic, sometimes lapping over into an adjacent republic. The Armenians, however, are remarkably dispersed for a nationality granted republic status. Whereas the other 14 such nationalities were listed in 1970 as having at least three-fourths of their numbers in their own national republic, only 62% of the U.S.S.R.'s Armenians lived in Armenia, with an additional 26% divided nearly evenly between Georgia and Azerbaijan, 8% living in the R.S.F.S.R., and smaller numbers in all other republics. Nonetheless, Armenia that year was far and away the most homogeneous republic in the Soviet Union, with 88.6% of its residents Armenian by nationality (Figure 4). Most of the Russians who have migrated to traditionally non-Russian areas have moved to the major urban centers of these areas, as managerial, professional, and technical personnel or as trained industrial workers. In most non-Russian republics, Russians constitute a larger proportion of the population in the capital city than they do in the republic as a whole, reflecting the important administrative role Russians play throughout the U.S.S.R. Their position as the dominant nationality is particularly pointed up in Kazakhstan and the Central Asian republics, where in 1970 they comprised at least 48% of the population in each of the capitals. Because ethnic identification usually is determined by mother tongue, it follows that the Soviet Union is a land of many languages, some of which are closely related and others totally dissimilar. Language families represented include Indo-European, Altaic, Uralic, and Caucasian. Despite the fact that two-fifths of the population speak a language other than Russian as their native tongue, Russian is by far the most important of Soviet languages. It is not only the language of the principal ethnic group, but it is also the official national language, the main language of higher education, and the language of communication between the various nationalities. Although most minority languages, under Soviet law, are granted equal status with Russian in areas where they are spoken, Russian has greater prestige and practical Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 GEORGIAN S.S.R. 4,686,000 AZERBAIJAN S.S.R. 5,1 1 7,000 UZBEK S.S.R. 1 1,960, 000 TADZHIK S.S.R. 2,900,000 NOTE: Areas of circles are proportional to population \"Other includes all nationalities comprising less than 5% of a republics population.

Nearly all well-educated minority persons speak it fluently, and a command of Russian is universally regarded as indispensable to political and social advancement. Among culturally developed minorities, such as the peoples of the Baltic republics, the Georgians, and the Armenians, wide use of Russian creates a certain friction, and even among less developed minorities, such as those of Central Asia, it has provoked a limited resistance. Minority languages are accorded equal status in many spheres, including law and public administration. Trials usually are conducted in the language spoken by the majority of the people of the area, and interpreters are supposed to be provided for those who cannot understand the language of the proceedings. All together, 141.8 million Soviets claimed Russian as their mother tongue in 1970. Of these, 128.8 million were Russians and 13 million were members of other nationalities. Another 41.9 million persons were reported as speaking the language \"fluently,\" as a second tongue. Thus, Russian was the native language of 59% of the population and was spoken by 76%. The proportion of persons in the various non-Russian nationality groups who claimed Russian as their mother tongue provides some measure of the extent to which they have been assimilated into the Russian- dominated Soviet society. Using this criterion, the Jews are by far the most Russified, followed by the Poles. Knowledge of Russian as a second language varies substantially among the non-Russian minorities. In general, those peoples living near or among Russians are far more likely to know Russian than those in the more remote parts of the nation. Among the Kalmyks, for example, 81.1% of those for whom Russian was not their native tongue claimed in 1970 to speak it as a second language. In contrast, the proportion among Uzbeks was 14.5%.

Among most of the large minority communities, at least 80% claimed the language of their nationality as their mother tongue. Major exceptions are the Jews and Poles and, to a lesser extent, the Germans and Bashkirs. Only 17.7% of the Jewish community in 1970 regarded Yiddish as their native language; only 32.5% of the Poles considered Polish as their mother tongue. In part, the low proportion among Jews reflects not only their assimilation to the Russian majority but also the refusal of Soviet authorities since 1948 to sanction the operation of Yiddish-language schools, notwithstand- ing constitutional stipulations guaranteeing each citizen the right to instruction in his native language. Primary schooling is provided in most indigenous languages, but secondary training is conducted only in the more important languages. The Soviet Govern- ment also supports the use of minority language by publishing newspapers, magazines, and books in these languages and by broadcasting in them. At the same time, almost all minority languages have undergone some degree of Russification. The Cyrillic alphabet is now used in all major languages except Estonian, Finnish, German, Latvian, Lithuanian, and Polish (which use Roman letters), Armenian and Georgian (which have unique scripts), and Yiddish (which uses Hebrew script). Words of foreign origin in minority languages have in many instances been purged and replaced with Russians words, and all minority languages have borrowed words-from Russian. Perhaps the most striking evidence of the ethnic an,25X1 linguistic complexity of society is found in the marked physical diversity of the Soviet peoples. Long and complicated racial history has produced such diversity between and even within nationality groups, so that there is no such thing as a typical Soviet citizen or even a typical Russian. Representative inhabitants of the U.S.S.R. are shown in Figure 5. In the early years of the Communist regime, the leadership called for the liquidation not only of the rich and the middle classes but also of all disparities (\"contradictions\") between urban and rural workers and economic differences and privileges which determine social classes. Although the ultimate goal of a \"classless\" society remains part of Communist theory, successive modifications concerning the means to achieve such a society have resulted in the continuation of disparities in the social structure. Thus, contemporary Soviet society tends to conform with other expanding, industrial societies, with social differentiations based on occupational groupings perpetuating the sort of distinction that traditionally has provided the basis for social classes. A more distinctive feature of Soviet society is the existence of two additional social differentiations which cut across or merge with essentially occupational groupings. The more important of these is the unequal division of the population into party and nonparty members. The second is the distinction between Russians and non-Russians, which places Russians in the positions with the highest pay, privileges, and political power in all areas of the U.S.S.R. The persistence of social classes has conflicted with the regime's ideological commitment to a classless society. Thus, the regime has repeatedly had to modify ideology to bring it into partial accord with reality. While its goal is a society guided by the principle \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs,\" the regime claims that in building communism Soviet society must continue to be governed by the maxim \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his work.\" As the work of various groups, such as peasants and urban workers, differs, so does their reward in terms of lifestyle, responsibility, and power.

It is sufficient for them that all the traditional \"exploiting\" classes-that is, the nobility and bourgeoisie-have been eliminated. Communist theorists do, however, recognize two \"nonantagonis- tic\" classes, the workers and the peasants, and one \"stratum,\" the intelligentsia. According to Commu- nist theory, although each of these groups has a differ- ent status within the system, they are interconnected through coownership of the most important means of production. In terms of the three officially recognized groups in society, the Soviet population consists of 20% intelligentsia, including white-collar workers; 20% peasants, including state farm workers; and 60% workers. Figure 6 details the development of the new class structure of Soviet society, as interpreted by Soviet statistics. The worker and peasant classes can each be subdivided into three groups. Those in the upper group of workers are the most highly skilled; \"they more or less consistently overproduce their quotas. Members of this group receive higher.base pay, special awards from the regime, special vacation leave, and other bonuses. In terms of prestige and economic position, they overlap the lower reaches of the white-collar group in the intelligentsia. The majority of -workers, however, are semiskilled. This large group shades off into the unskilled, a relatively unproductive group of workers estimated to make up 20%. of the work force. Most of these, earning a minimal wage, are new I1 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 rp Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 FIGURE 6.

At least a few peasants are relatively well-to-do and form the upper group of the peasantry. However, the per capita annual income for the collective farm peasantry ranks the more prosperous members of this group only slightly above the low-paid unskilled workers and not above the semiskilled. The more prosperous peasants have achieved their position through membership in a collective farm that has been exceptionally fortunate in terms of kind and amount of crops, fertility of land, and location. Some peasants on less favored farms may, through skill or development of \"model farm practices,\" achieve the higher income and official recognition that will place them in the prosperous group. Transitional between the prosperous collective farm peasantry and the semiskilled industrial workers are the state farm peasants, who share---the rural way of life with the collective farm workers but are paid wages by the state for their labor instead of depending on the vagaries of nature and consumer demand. The bulk of the rural work force, however, is lower on the social and economic scale than almost any industrial worker. Still further down the scale are the few remaining independent peasant farmers. While the regime prefers to lump together a great many occupational and status positions under the rubric \"intelligentsia,\" this group can be subdivided into an elite, a traditional intelligentsia, and a white- collar group. With the exception of the elite, which owes its position to the possession of political power, divisions within the intelligentsia are determined by such factors as income, education, type of employment, and a system of privileges and bureaucratic rank. Ethnic considerations. are not of fundamental importance, although Russians are more heavily represented in the higher ranks. Nor are the 14.7 million Communist Party members guaranteed a privileged position in society, although party membership is an important prerequisite for advancement. White-collar workers comprise the largest group in the intelligentsia stratum; they include a variety of nonmanual workers, descending from petty bureau- crats, through accountants and bookkeepers, technicians and teachers, down to ordinary clerks and salesgirls. Although the regime, for internal propaganda purposes, persists in lumping the white- collar group with the political elite and the traditional intelligentsia as a means of blurring the privileged group within the general population, the workers and peasants generally distinguish between the two higher groups and the ordinary white-collar workers. This latter group is broad not only in diversity of occupation but also in range of salary. The average salary is only slightly above the industrial worker's level, but a few earn an income as much as 10 times that amount. Members of this group have little in common, save a desire to maintain their position in Soviet society; to do so many belong to the party or to the Komsomol, the official youth organization. The traditional intelligentsia includes those occupying the upper and middle ranks in the party, government, economy, and military; most scientists, artists, and writers, engineers, managers of industrial enterprises, heads of collective and state farms, and others in responsible administrative positions; and those, regardless of their occupation, who are well educated. To some extent these groups form exclusive, strongly hierarchical castes along with some members of the white-collar group in the same line of employment. Thus, occupational group loyalties apart from general class distinction are engendered. Those- belonging to the traditional intelligentsia are well paid, with earnings averaging five to 10 times the average worker's wage, but rank and privilege are probably even more important considerations. Within this group the proportion belonging to the Communist Party is high. Members of the traditional intel- ligentsia, a majority of whom have had a higher education, are well rewarded because their capabilities are in great demand and their allegiance is essential for the regime's continued existence. Yet members of this group are not free from censure in instances of poor performance or undesirable political tendencies, and they must bear the brunt of recurrent criticism in politics, the arts, and sciences. The elite, numbering approximately 10,000 persons, is composed of the top party officials, senior government, economic, and military officials, and prominent scientists, artists, and writers. The elite is sharply differentiated from other Soviet groups, and 25X1 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 there is little overlapping with the traditional intelligentsia. Despite the elite's predominance in authority, rank, and responsibilities, however, its remuneration and privileges are not much greater than that of the traditional intelligentsia. The elite shares with the intelligentsia the various perquisites attached to their positions, such as priority in housing, medical care in special clinics and accommodations in the best sanatoriums, access to special stores and restaurants, and special opportunities for family members. Entry into the elite is difficult. Entrants must combine ruthlessness, great drive and ambition, ability in some specialty, and at least some capacity for scheming and maneuvering. Connections are also important, as many individuals rise to the top as proteges of one high official or another. The educational level of the elite is high, usually consisting of technical training. This education, however, has not been sufficiently broad to provide less intellectually gifted members of the elite with the critical ability to distinguish dogma and stereotypes from reality when making decisions. Despite their different activities, members of the elite belong to the party-a fact which tends to insure uniformity of interest and outlook and deters the development of particularistic interests counter to those of the top party leaders. Notwithstanding the leap which must be made to pass from the peasantry or working class into the intelligentsia, or from one layer in the intelligentsia into another, the Soviet social system is more fluid than that of prerevolutionary Russia. Individuals have greater opportunity to move up the social ladder on the basis of demonstrated political and technical merit. In the early days of the regime, this mobility derived from the fluid revolutionary situation and was continued by the rapid expansion and growth of the industrial sector of the economy. This social mobility proved a great source of strength to the regime, as people rising into the intelligentsia and the upper echelons of the working class had a stake in maintaining the system that provided them positions inconceivable under prerevolutionary conditions. The presence of officials, scientists, and artists of peasant and working-class background, even though their actual number is exaggerated by the regime, demonstrates to the Soviet citizenry that individual productive, political, and administrative abilities can receive recognition. The higher the individual rises in the social structure, however, the greater the possibility that the current may suddenly reverse and drag him down, possibly below where he started. The vulnerability associated with high positions has been known to deter some talented individuals from aspiring to them. Thus the party must actively seek out individuals with proficiency as technicians and leaders. This seeking out of potential leaders is a twofold process reinforcing the system. The capable are mobilized to serve the interests of the regime and are assured proper recognition, while those who are talented but refuse to join the party become suspect. The early egalitarian philosophy of the party stressed equal opportunity for both men and women, another avenue for mobility opened by the Communists. On the basis of occupation, working women theoretically are accorded the same position in the social structure as men. There have been instances, however, where job ratings have been manipulated extralegally so that professional women are paid somewhat less than men engaged in the same work. Most working women are in agricultural, manufactur- ing, and other semiskilled or unskilled jobs. Nonmanual workers among women seem to be in relatively \"safe\" and lower paid jobs-as is the tradition in the United States-such as teaching, nursing, bookkeeping, and secretarial work. The major exception to this is in medicine, where nearly three- fourths of the physicians are women; even in this field, however, the top positions are usually held by men. Whether by their own choice or by official policy, women are generally excluded from superior party posts and other positions notably high in vulnerability. While it is questionable that widespread class consciousness has taken root again in the U.S.S.R., there exists an awareness of and preoccupation with social differences among the population. Each class has its distinguishing marks which make it an identifiable target to others, and these visible distinctions reflect deeper differences in social viewpoint and lifestyle. Each class, in addition, has. its own problems, and to some extent other classes in society are seen as either creating these problems or failing to mitigate them. Since the death of Stalin, the regime has adopted a number of measures to counteract hardening class lines and to reduce growing economic differences. Thus, secondary school tuition fees have been abolished, taxes in the lower income brackets reduced, and the annual compulsory bond subscription drives eliminated. Minimum wages have risen, as have payments to collective farmers, while the wages of the upper income groups have risen less sharply. A general increase in pensions has benefited lower income groups chiefly. Yet, despite these measures, the gap between income extremes remains wide.

To avoid the danger of developing a permanent and closed elite, but at the same time to meet the need for an army of technicians to staff the ever larger and more complex economy, the regime has made several efforts to expand the educational opportunities available to the nation's youth. Khrushchev in particular attacked preferential schooling assignments based on parental influence rather than on merit and also the marked underrepresentation of students from worker and peasant families in higher educational institutions. The 1958 school reform, in addition to making available some financial aid, provided for an expansion of correspondence and part-time schools to give worker and peasant youths a better opportunity to continue their education. The academic standards in these schools were not equivalent to those in full- time schools, however, and their graduates remained at a disadvantage in competition with students from full-time schools for admission to higher educational institutions. The 1958 reform also made some effort to restore balance among applicants by requiring 2 years of work in production for all but the top fifth of applicants to higher educational institutions. After persistent criticism that these innovations lowered academic standards, the regime dropped the 2-year work requirement and substituted a percentage distribution in admissions among graduates of full- time secondary schools, production workers, and demobilized servicemen. Despite these efforts to increase social mobility, the children of the upper classes still enjoy an advantage by virtue of their parents higher income, more cultured home background, favorable geographical location, and personal influence and connections. b. Family The most distinguishing feature of the Soviet family is its subordination to and circumscription by the state. Fostered materially by low living levels, such dependency also reflects a real need to remain on good terms with regime authorities, particularly in the areas of housing, employment, and higher education. Otherwise, the behavior patterns of most Soviet families resemble those of their counterparts in industrialized Western European countries. Significant variations, however, occur in the relative values which the various Soviet peoples attach to the family as an institution. The Central Asian family, for example, with its respect for religious sanctions, emphasis on perpetuation of the male line, and extension of family relationships into political and economic life, contrasts sharply with the modern Russified family among whom, as in Western countries, family ties have been attenuated and family influence has waned. The regime follows a nationwide policy of remaking the family according to revolutionary theory which holds that members owe primary allegiance to the state rather than to each other. To achieve this objective the regime uses all the powers at its command, including legislation, police control, education, and propaganda. In many areas, rapid urbanization and industrialization have tended to accomplish the same end, drawing youths out of the family at an early age, reducing the family size, and splitting the family structure into its smallest unit, the nuclear family. In addition, because many women work outside the home to supplement a meager income, many child-rearing functions have been taken over by state nurseries, kindergartens, and schools. Early Soviet legislation governing marriage and the family was motivated. by the Marxist mandate to destroy the family as an instrument of \"bourgeois exploitation,\" as well as by the practical consideration of minimizing parental influence potentially unsympathetic to regime control. Indeed, decrees altering marriage and divorce codes were issued before the Bolsheviks were firmly established and preceded the separation of church and state, the definition of the rights and duties of local soviets, and many other measures vitally important to a new government struggling for survival. The most complete embodiment of early Soviet policy toward the family was contained in the 1926 code. Under this legislation, control of marriage and divorce was removed from the family and church and placed under the jurisdiction of the state. Marriage became a simple procedure of registering with the Government Civil Registry Office (ZAGS), while any change in family status could be reported to ZAGS by mail, a convenience that led to a rash of postcard divorces in European Russia. Furthermore, persons living together who wished to omit the formality of a registry marriage could do so without censure and could legalize their relationship retroactively at any time. Children born out of wedlock were granted the same rights as other children. Legal resources were provided the mother to establish paternity and to force the father to contribute to the child's support. In addition, the code legalized abortion, making it free of charge at government hospitals. Other provisions included the right of a wife to a joint interest in property accumulated during married life.

Changing course, the state denounced the free, unbound socialist family as \"leftist deviationism\" and returned to the ideal of a disciplined, stable family. Marriage was declared a solemn affair. Registry offices were made more attractive, and the manufacture of wedding rings was revived. By the same token, divorce was made more expensive and more difficult. In 1936, higher divorce fees were established, and penalties of up to 2 years' imprisonment for nonpayment of alimony were instituted. Abortion was outlawed. The 1944 family code introduced greater stringency. Divorce could no longer be obtained by simple registration but only through extended, expensive court action. Unregis- tered marriages were no longer recognized, and children born out of wedlock were not entitled to inherit on equal terms with legitimate children. Furthermore, a mother wishing to prove the paternity of an illegitimate child was denied the use of the courts, although the government supplied minimal assistance until the child reached age 12. Following World War II, the wave of reaction against liberal family policies subsided, and the regime began to pursue a more moderate course. In 1955, in view of popular feeling favoring abortion, the 1936 law was repealed, and abortions for other than medical reasons were again legalized if performed in hospitals under state supervision. In 1965, following long years of public complaint, the divorce laws were amended to make the proceedings less costly and less time consuming. Although unregistered marriages did not regain full legal status, in 1968 provision was made for children born to couples living together for an extended period to claim inheritance. Court paternity suits were again allowed and, if successful, the father was expected to contribute to the child's support. Emphasis on the large, stable family remains, however. Since 1944 the regime has extended financial and social aid to the family, at the same time penalizing the childless, whether married or not, by taxation. With the birth of the third child, the family receives a lump-sum payment, and monthly allowances begin with the fourth child. Employed mothers receive liberal maternity benefits, and mothers of large families are honored with medals and orders glorifying motherhood. On the other hand, leading a loose moral life and shirking family responsibility are grounds for expulsion from the party. According to the 1970 census, 72% of all Soviet men age 16 and older were married; the comparable proportion for women was 58%. Because of the shortage of men, sizable numbers of women over age 30 have been unable to marry; additionally, because women outlive men and because of huge losses of men during World War II, there are many widows in the older ages. As revealed by the census, the average woman marries between the ages of 20 and 25, while the average man weds between 25 and 30. In 1959, the latest date for which data are available, family size averaged 3.7 persons (3.5 in urban areas and 3.9 in rural areas). The 1970 census figures, when available, are expected to show a slight decrease in family size, despite regime efforts to encourage large families. Indeed, the number of children appears to vary inversely with family status, the more affluent families tending to restrict the number of children and use their resources to improve living levels. In 1970, the divorce rate was 2.6 per 1,000 population. Within the family the parents' mandate to govern their children comes not from the fact of procreation but from the government, which assigns them responsibility for rearing citizens loyal to the state. Through its representatives in the party, trade unions, or schools, the regime may intervene in a child's upbringing and will hold the parents responsible if the child misbehaves, does not do well in school, or makes deviationist statements. As a result, instead of stressing religious principles and traditional virtues, parents are inclined to foster caution in social relations and actions and to point out the importance of a successful career and material rewards. Pragmatic. adjustment to regime authority is considered prudent. Although ideological flexibility and political conformity are emphasized, blind obedience to authority, which the regime would like to have instilled, is not an objective of family training. It is considered enough to teach the child to stay out of trouble. Aware that school officials may elicit information on parental attitudes from their children, parents generally avoid political discussions in the home or any open expression of dissatisfaction with conditions or with regime policies. Since the traditional authority of the father has been transferred to officials of the schools and the party, parents no longer seem to expect the obedience and solidarity that once characterized the Russian family. Despite regime propaganda that parents must be strict, they seem to have intensified loving relationships with their children as their authority has waned. Because parents are nevertheless responsible for the acts and thoughts of their offspring, greater emphasis is placed on the relationship between Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 husband and wife as the only refuge for the free, confidential expression of ideas. The role of the individual in Soviet society is prescribed in detail by the party which establishes social norms, values, and standards of morality to be followed in all areas of life. The ideal citizen is the \"new Soviet man\" who, having shed all encumbering traditions, places the interests of the state above those of himself and his family. He is unquestioningly devoted to the tenets of Marxism-Leninism and gives unstintingly of his time and energy to further the Communist cause. At the same time he is disciplined, obedient, temperate, puritanical in conduct, and steady in mood. Although the party has secured a measure of surface conformity to this ideal, personal interest often motivates actions contrary to the general welfare as defined by the regime. Laws restricting private enterprise are often violated, and workers and peasants frequently indulge in speculative buying and selling. The crime rate may be rising. A constant propaganda barrage exhorting the people to be patriotic and obey the law belies the party's assertion that the people wholeheartedly support its program. The state discourages alternative loyalties to churches, geographic regions, and friendship groups, unless sanctioned by the party. Organizational ties allowed and encouraged are those to such instrumentalities of the state and party as the Komsomol, trade unions, cooperatives, civil defense and sports groups, and assorted cultural, professional, and technical societies. The general frustration of the Russians' natural gregariousness and the rigid control imposed by the state have left their mark. Despite outward conformity,. many individuals struggle to preserve some shred of personal independence. Often the struggle is manifested by escapist and \"antisocial\" attitudes and behavior, including drunkenness, a liking for foreign clothes and fads, and attraction to \"decadent\" forms of entertainment. On a higher level, many are preoccupied with the past and with scientific and technical occupations as little concerned with politics and ideology as possible. In all segments of Soviet society most citizens want only to be left alone to live their lives in peace, rear their families, work at their jobs, and enjoy recreation and the company of friends with minimum involvement in state and party affairs. Traditional values among Russians, Ukrainians, and Belorussians were formed historically under the strong influence of the teachings of the Orthodox Church, a predominantly rural economy, and an authoritarian political system unsoftened by traditional West European humanistic values. Peasant mentality was marked by fatalism, patience, and obedience and was generally weak in the spirit of individual initiative and competitiveness. Upon this framework the Marxist-Leninist ethic has been imposed with widely differing degrees of success in rural and urban areas, among economic classes, and among different ethnic groups. Rural areas have been less affected by industrialization and official indoctrination through the years. Therefore, although the peasant seems to live the least satisfying life, usually below the economic level of the average industrial worker, old traditions continue to persist in the rural areas. He is the farthest removed from the system and the least concerned with the absence of civil liberties, material comforts, and job potential or satisfaction. For generations the peasant had little hope of improving his position, and the wealthy person had little fear of losing his. Consequently there was no incentive for exceptional effort on the part of the individual. The state has set out to change these characteristics of lethargy and passivity by encouraging all to work diligently and demonstrate initiative in all fields but politics. Exhortation, education, economic and social rewards, contrived competition, and even legal penalties have been used to reshape the Soviet citizen into the \"new Soviet man.\" Despite this effort, passive obedience, devoid largely of enthusiasm, characterizes the outlook of most Soviet people. Although they seem to have an extraordinary capacity for hardship, and take pride in the amount of personal discomfort they can bear, they have grown adept at avoiding cumbersome bureaucracy by na levo methods, meaning \"to the left\" or indirectly. They are painfully aware of the imperfections and inequalities in Soviet society, and yet they fundamentally do not seem to be opposed to authoritarian rule. Although most workers accept the Communist ideology and the Soviet industrial system, there is a wide divergence in attitude among industrial workers as a result of the official policy of significant base pay differentials and other rewards. Those in positions of authority and responsibility within the regime demonstrate the greatest support, and those more distant from the source of power, the least. Skilled workers tend to be more favorably disposed to the regime, have more hopes and ambitions for self- improvement, and derive more satisfaction from their work than do unskilled workers.

In return for secure material position, intellectuals, for the most part, are disposed to accept a system which subordinates the individual to the state. Yet it is in this privileged class that much of present-day Soviet dissatisfaction is concentrated. The regime has been successful in isolating dissenters from the rest of the population, but not in preventing new outbursts. Most recent were two brilliant indictments of the political system by Andrei Amalrik, \"Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984\" and \"Involuntary journey to Siberia.\" Amalrik has since been tried and imprisoned for \"disseminating falsehoods derogatory to the Soviet state and social system.\" What enthusiasm or devotion exists among national, as opposed to social, groupings seems confined largely to the dominant Russians. Occasionally, however, they may experience ambivalent feelings toward the regime, but they remain unequivocally loyal to the nation. Alienation in attitudes appears to proceed by degree from resentment among the culturally conservative, but less developed ethnic groups in Central Asia and Siberia, to ill-disguised hostility among the culturally developed non-Russian minorities in the Baltic republics and the Caucasus. Ethnic tensions exist between the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, but except for anti- Semitism they are given little publicity and are usually kept under control. Nevertheless, these tensions present a serious problem to the regime. Among the more notable examples of hostility are the Balts' hatred for the Russians and the mutual antipathy between Georgians and Armenians. For their part, Russians tend to be condescending toward all other ethnic minorities, particularly the non-Slavic peoples. Proud of their culture, their mutual advances in the face of a harsh climate and foreign hostility, and the present Soviet position of influence in world politics, the Russians consider fitting the role assigned them in Soviet doctrine as the \"elder brother\" of all the other Soviet peoples. Even so, some privately admit to feelings of cultural inferiority to the Baltic peoples. Russian nationalism has received varying degrees of official encouragement ever since the early 1930's, with the aim of counterbalancing minority nationalisms and the stresses imposed by the stratified social system. At the end of World War II, the Russians were officially recognized as having made the largest contribution to victory. The histories of the minority peoples have subsequently been rewritten to show that their contact with the Russians brought them to a higher civilization and a better way of life. This indeed is a far cry from the Soviet propaganda of the 1920's, which condemned such \"Great Russian chauvinism\" as a tsarist device to keep down the minority peoples. Since the death of Stalin, the government has tended to play down Russian nationalism in the hope of preventing any spontaneous development which could promote anti- Soviet feelings. Instead, the concept of Russian cultural hegemony has been enunciated more subtly and skillfully, with greater emphasis on the alleged common desire of all Soviet people to build a new Communist society. The attitude of the public toward people of other societies and cultures has been conditioned by Soviet propaganda, which claims that the capitalist states are unalterably opposed to the U.S.S.R. and represent a threat, even though they are a \"dying\" political form. This propaganda, while creating many misconcep- tions, does not seem to have instilled hostility among Soviet citizens toward most foreigners as such: This may partly be a result of their acceptance of the distinction Soviet propagandists have always made between the \"clique of capitalists and militarists\" ruling a foreign nation and that nation's \"oppressed and poverty-stricken common people.\" At the same time the official line that only under the Communist system are people free has gained some credence because of the relative isolation of the Soviet citizen and his resulting ignorance of the rest of the world. The popular attitude toward most European peoples is colored to a certain extent by traditional prejudices. The Poles, for example, are generally regarded by the Russians with distaste, if not contempt, and have been for centuries. This antipathy toward the sister Slavic state tends to be shared by the Ukrainians and Belorussians. Likewise, all three Eastern Slavic peoples tend to hold similar attitudes toward the Germans, with hostile feelings somewhat more marked among the Russians. Generally, there is respect for the Germans' presumed orderliness, technical efficiency, and ingenuity and dislike for their supposed pettiness, meanness, and pedantry. Since World War II these basic attitudes have been expanded to include respect for the efficiency, fighting quality, and might of a German army, and awe mixed with fear at the barbarities Germans demonstrated themselves capable of committing. Many Russians distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" Germans, and these categories are applied both to the Communist East and capitalist West Germans. As for the other peoples of Central and Eastern Europe, popular attitudes are ambivalent, ranging from mild Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 friendliness to apathy. Although most Soviet citizens are satisfied that their nation's ties to the Communist countries of Eastern Europe demonstrate that the U.S.S.R. is not isolated in the world, many doubt the durability of the loyalty of these nations in the event of war. Despite more than 50 years of propaganda describing the \"spiritual decadence\" and predatory, anti-Soviet designs of the major Western capitalist countries, the present attitude of the great bulk of the Soviet peoples toward them seems to be a compound of admiration, apprehension, arrogance and pride, and, in varying degrees, a sense of inferiority. The Soviet people are impressed by the material progress of these nations, sensitive to their own country's shortcomings, and resentful of suggestions that they are in some ways a \"backward\" people. There is a fairly pervasive feeling that the U.S.S.R. represents a moral and spiritual force superior to the materialistic states of the West, and Soviet propaganda appeals to this feeling when it stresses the bizarre and alarming in its treatment of the affluent, consumer-oriented United States. Nevertheless, a generally friendly attitude toward Americans persists among the people. This attitude exists partly because of the earlier geographical remoteness of the two nations and consequent lack of traditional conflicts of interest and partly because of the historical image of the United States as a haven for political refugees and a land of opportunity. Acts of friendship and collaboration, such as U.S. famine relief in the 1920's, and the alliance and Lend-Lease program during World War II, have also contributed to U.S. popularity. After World War II, the Soviet regime went to great lengths to destroy this legacy of good will, and during the Korean War it charged the United States with aggression, bacteriological warfare, and Nazi-style atrocities. Following Stalin's death and the end of the war in Korea, anti-U.S. propaganda subsided, but with the development and expansion of the war in Indochina it revived. Soviet society, however, is no longer as inaccessible as it was in Stalin's day. A cultural exchange program with the United States has been in effect since 1958, and American tourism is encouraged. The resulting sporadic personal contacts between individual Soviet and U.S. citizens, as well as the occasional U.S. exhibits in various cities of the U.S.S.R., limited as they are, have helped to correct, at least partially, some Soviet misconceptions. The popular attitude toward the non-Western peoples of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East ranges from tolerance to condescension. The technical backwardness of these countries is attributed to capitalist exploitation of these countries and neglect by reactionary, feudal rulers, and the picture of the peoples of these areas struggling to become masters in their own house has aroused some sympathy. Underlying such empathy, however, is a certain ambivalance. An increasing number of Africans, Arabs, and other third world peoples have taken up residence in the U.S.S.R. for work, training, or study. The Soviet people's reaction toward them has been decidedly negative, their attitudes paralleling those of Western Europeans exposed to an influx of \"uncultured\" aliens. Russians traditionally have been suspicious of Orientals, considering them untrust- worthy and unreliable. As the People's Republic of China has come into its own, the popular attitude has developed into a mixture of fascination and growing anxiety. This anxiety appears to have increased as the rift between Moscow and Peking has deepened, expressing itself in the reality of public polemics and the possibility of military conflict. Like other European peoples who fought World War II on their home ground, the Soviet people are anxious for their leaders to avoid war. In contrast to its earlier touting of the ideological premise of a hostile . capitalist world, full of oppressed workers waiting impatiently to be liberated and set on the path of communism, the regime now prefers to present itself to the world and its own people as the leading exponent of peace and the creator of a peace bloc among nations. The Soviet people have responded to this line more positively than to ideological messianism, and it would be difficult for the regime to whip up enthusiasm for an openly aggressive war. In view of the vivid memories of the last war's terrible suffering and privation, as well as evidence of collaboration between some of the minority peoples and the enemy, there is even some question whether tried-and-true appeals along the line of \"the motherland in danger\" or \"the yellow peril\" would evoke a uniformly' favorable response. C. Population With an estimated 249,962,000 inhabitants as of mid-1973, the Soviet Union is the third most populous nation in the world, ranking behind the People's Republic of China and India, but with nearly 40 million more residents than the United States. The population as of mid-1973 represented an increase of slightly more than 8 million over the 241.7 million reported by the census of 15 January 1970, and 41 million more than the 208.8 million enumerated in 1959. I Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11: CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010004-5 Emigration and immigration being negligible, population growth in the U.S.S.R. is due almost wholly to natural increase. As in many European countries, in the Soviet Union the population had a spurt of growth in the immediate post-World War II years, followed by a period of rapid increase throughout the 1950's. By the early 1960's, however, the rate had begun to decline (Figure 7). In 1969, the rate of natural increase was 8.9 per 1,000 population, just half the level of 17.8 per 1,000 reported for 1960. It rose slightly in the years 1970-71 and will probably continue to rise during the remainder of the 1970's as a consequence of the entry into the prime childbearing ages of large cohorts of women born during the 1950's, but to a level far below that achieved in the late 1950's. If fertility remains constant at the 1971 level, the total population of the U.S.S.R. is projected to be about 320 million on 1 January 2000, an increase of 70 million over the total estimated for 1 July 1973. If fertility declines, as it has over the past decade, the total is projected to be between 292.million and 306 million at the beginning of 2000. Under either assumption, the excess of females over males will continue to decline, and the population will slowly reflect an increase in the older age groups. The most significant factor in the decline in the rate of natural increase during the 1960's was the decrease in the number of births. The birth rate was fairly stable in the 1950's, and in 1960, the year of the peak number of births, stood at 24.9 per 1,000 population. Reflecting the declining number of births in the 1960's, the birth rate dropped by nearly a third-to 17.0 in 1969. For 1970, it was 17.4 and for 1971, 1.7.8. Of the two components of the rate of natural increase, the death rate has changed less since 1950 than the birth rate. Starting at the relatively low level of 9.7 per 1,000 population in that year, the crude death rate dropped to a low of 6.9 in 1964, then gradually increased to 8.2 in 1970-a decline of 15.5% over the 20-year period. It remained at 8.2 in 1971. The rise in the death rate since 1964 has been due to the aging of the population and to an increase in mortality rates for males in all age groups 25 and above. Vital rates for the republics (Figure 8) offer clear evidence of the widely different patterns of population growth within the country. With the exception of Estonia and Latvia, where death rates are high because of the older age structure of the population, variations in the death rate among the republics are not great, and significant differences in the rate of natural increase result mainly from differences in birth rates. In 1971, the highest crude birth rate was 25X1 reported for the Tadzhik S.S.R. (36.8 per 1,000 population). This rate was over twice the national rate and nearly 21/2 times the rates for the R. S. F. S. R.; the Ukraine, and Latvia. Unlike the birth rates for all other republics, moreover, the Tadzhik rate did not decline between 1960 and 1971, but actually increased FIGURE 8.

In general, rates for the Central Asian republics were much higher than those for other republics, and they fell less rapidly during the 1960's than those for the western and Transcaucasian republics. The decreasing rate of population growth has induced concern on the part of Soviet planners, scholars, and the general public. Numerous studies have shown that the fertility behavior of Soviet women increasingly is being affected by factors operating to lower the number of children desired. These factors include urbanization, industrialization, increased demand for more education, greater participation in political, economic, and cultural activities, and the shortage of housing. The ready availability of abortion and the increasing availability of contraceptives have made it fairly easy for Soviet women to control births and accommodate to these new patterns of life. A nationwide survey in 1969 revealed the ideal number of children desired by Soviet women averaged 2.89; the range by republic varied from 2.60 for Latvia and 2.69 for the R. S. F. S. R. to 4.55 for Uzbekistan. Although consideration is being given to the question of instituting a pronatalist population policy, to date explicit actions by the government relating to population policy have been limited, and there is no clear outline of a conscious and defined policy. Such action as has been taken relates to abortion and a system of allowances and awards to mothers with large families. Abortion, legal in 1920-36 and again since 1955, is available on request, and one estimate in 1968 placed the number of legal abortions at 6 million per year, a figure substantially higher than the number of births. Soviet medical authorities openly comment on abortion's harmful consequences on the health of women and they campaign to reduce its incidence, but it appears that abortion is still used as the surest method of preventing the birth of an unwanted child. Although oral contraceptives, the interuterine device, and condoms are available in the Soviet Union, the use of these seemingly is not widespread. The condom is more commonly used than any other kind of contraceptive, however. Payments and allowances given to mothers (including unwed mothers) with large families was first instituted in 1936, but the program, altered at various subsequent times, has never been openly described by the Soviet Government as intended to stimulate an increase in the birth rate. Also, the average amount of the sums paid seems unlikely to be enough to spur an increase. Life expectancy at birth for both sexes increased from 1954-55 until the mid-1960's and has since remained fairly constant, as shown below: MALE FEMALE 1954-55 ................ 61 67 1955-56 ................ 63 69 1957-58 ................ 64 71 1958-59 ................ 64 72 1960-61 ................ 65 73 1962-63 ................ 65 73 1964-65 ................ 66 74 1966-67 ................ 66 74 1968-69 ................ 65 74 1970-71 ................ 65 74 The difference of 9 years between the values for the two sexes since the late 1960's is clear evidence of a much more favorable mortality pattern for females. Life expectancy at birth for females in the Soviet Union is comparable with that in the United States and the countries of Western Europe. That for males lags somewhat behind. 1. Density and distribution Despite its large population, the Soviet Union had an overall density at midyear 1973 of only 28.9 persons per square mile, one of the lowest ratios in the world. Population density in the U.S.S.R. is one-half that in the United States and about one-eighth that in the People's Republic of China (Figure 9).

In 1970, density ranged from less than one person per square mile in the Yakut A.S.S.R. and in Magadan Oblast (both in the R.S.F.S.R.) to 478 persons per square mile in Donetsk Oblast in the Ukraine. The average density in the European part of the U.S.S.R. was 85 persons per square mile; it was nine persons per square mile east of the Urals. The distribution of the total population by republic shows that the R.S.F.S.R. continues to account for slightly more than half of the nation's inhabitants, although the proportion has been gradually declining for some years (Figure 11). Published results of the 1.970 census reconfirmed long-term trends in the redistribution of the population among the various republics and regions. Movement from west to east continued. In 1959, there were 45,536,000 persons, or 21.8% of the total population, living east of the Urals. The population in this vast area increased nearly twice as fast as the total population in the 1959-70 intercensal period, and in 1970 numbered 58,153,000, or 24.1 % of the total. This increase was due principally to high rates of growth in Kazakhstan and the four Central Asian republics, as only one of the economic regions of the eastern part of the R.S.F.S.R.-the Far East region-grew more rapidly than the nation as a FIGURE 11. Population, by republic (Thousands) whole. It is of note that the heavily industrialized Urals region and the Western Siberia region grew at less than half the national rate. Despite plans to continue developing industrial capacity in these regions, the outflow of population, particularly from rural areas, held down the overall growth of population and labor force. Continuation of another long-term trend in population distribution-from the western and central regions of European Russia to the southern republics and regions-was also substantiated by the 1970 census. Thus, the North Caucasus region of the R.S.F.S.R., the South region of the Ukrainian S.S.R., and the republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Moldavia grew much more rapidly than the country as a whole. On the other hand, the Georgian S.S.R. barely kept pace with the national rate. Overall, of 160 principal administrative areas, 16 lost population during the intercensal period, 71 grew at a rate less than that of the nation as a whole, and 73 grew more rapidly, with 10 of these latter areas registering increases of more than 48% (Figure 12). Areas which experienced a net loss in population were primarily older rural regions where agriculture has stagnated and new ind"
