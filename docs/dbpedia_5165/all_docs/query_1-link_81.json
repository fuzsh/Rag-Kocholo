The concept originated among early Baptists in America. In 1644, Roger Williams, a puritan minister and founder of the state of Rhode Island and The First Baptist Church in America, was the first public official to call for \"a wall or hedge of separation\" between \"the wilderness of the world\" and \"the garden of the church.\" Although the concept is older, the exact phrase \"separation of church and state\" is derived from \"wall of separation between Church & State,\" a term coined by Thomas Jefferson in his 1802 letter to members of the Danbury Baptist association in the state of Connecticut. The concept was promoted by Enlightenment philosophers such as John Locke.",

For other uses, see Church and State (disambiguation).\n\nThe separation of church and state is a philosophical and jurisprudential concept for defining political distance in the relationship between religious organizations and the state. Conceptually, the term refers to the creation of a secular state (with or without legally explicit church-state separation) and to disestablishment, the changing of an existing, formal relationship between the church and the state.[1] The concept originated among early Baptists in America. In 1644, Roger Williams, a puritan minister and founder of the state of Rhode Island and The First Baptist Church in America, was the first public official to call for \"a wall or hedge of separation\" between \"the wilderness of the world\" and \"the garden of the church.\"[2] Although the concept is older, the exact phrase \"separation of church and state\" is derived from \"wall of separation between Church & State,\" a term coined by Thomas Jefferson in his 1802 letter to members of the Danbury Baptist association in the state of Connecticut.[3] The concept was promoted by Enlightenment philosophers such as John Locke.[4]\n\nIn a society, the degree of political separation between the church and the civil state is determined by the legal structures and prevalent legal views that define the proper relationship between organized religion and the state. The arm's length principle proposes a relationship wherein the two political entities interact as organizations each independent of the authority of the other. The strict application of the secular principle of laïcité is used in France, while secular societies such as Denmark and England maintain a form of constitutional recognition of an official state religion."
