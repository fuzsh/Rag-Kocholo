        "text": "Contributing to Chicago’s rich and cultural landscape, the DePaul Symphony Orchestra rehearses and performs in the Mary Patricia Gannon Concert Hall in the Holtschneider Performance Center on the Lincoln Park campus. The DePaul Symphony Orchestra focuses on a thorough and serious study of the core orchestral repertoire while also studying contemporary repertoire. Students receive regular coaching from members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Lyric Opera Orchestra, and DePaul’s pre-eminent string and wind faculties. Professionalism and orchestral fundamentals are prioritized. Rehearsals are two times a week for approximately two and a half hours, with concerts taking place a couple of times each quarter. Members of the DePaul Symphony Orchestra often perform as the DePaul Opera Theatre Orchestra.\n\nThe DePaul Symphony Orchestra will benefit from the artistic leadership of a roster of renowned guest conductors during the 2024-2025 academic year, including Lidiya Yankovaskaya, Allen Tinkham, Francesco Milioto, and Daniel Boico.\n\nMembership in the DePaul Symphony Orchestra is open to all DePaul students, subject to audition.\n\nMichael Lewanski, Conductor\n\nThe DePaul Concert Orchestra studies and performs a diverse range of works—standard repertoire to new music, from the 18th to the 21st centuries. The orchestra's concerts feature adventurous programming designed to provide thought-provoking aesthetic experiences that recontextualize well-known pieces, present unfamiliar ones and connect musicians and audiences more deeply to the music of their past and present. The DePaul Concert Orchestra collaborates annually with the DePaul Choirs and DePaul Ensemble 20+. Members of the DePaul Concert Orchestra often perform as the DePaul Opera Theatre Orchestra.\n\nMembership in the DePaul Concert Orchestra is open to all DePaul students, subject to audition.\n\nErica Neidlinger, Conductor\n\nConducted by Erica Neidlinger, DePaul Wind Symphony consists of 55-60 outstanding wind players who perform a repertoire chosen from a variety of historical periods and for ensembles of various sizes. While this group occasionally presents pieces composed for smaller groups, much of its time is spent studying and performing works from the standard symphonic band repertoire. As with every ensemble group at DePaul, professionalism in performance quality and attitude is always emphasized.\n\nMembership in DePaul Wind Symphony is open to all DePaul students, subject to audition.\n\nConductors of DePaul Choirs for the 2024-2025 academic year will be Eric Esparza (winter and spring quarters 2025) and Christopher Windle and Lonnie Norwood (autumn quarter 2024)\n\nThe DePaul Choirs are dedicated to developing the choral artistry of a wide array of student singers (music majors and non-music majors) with diverse and engaging repertoire. The choirs perform a variety of musical styles, including Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, 20th-Century, 21st-Century, spirituals, jazz, and music from a diverse mixture of world cultures. Performances are once or twice a quarter and often include collaborations with guest artists, culture bearers, and instrumental colleagues. Recent performances of masterworks have included Bach’s Hunting Cantata, Orff’s Carmina Burana, Stravinsky’s Symphony of Psalms, Rossini’s Stabat Mater, DuBois’s Seven Last Words of Christ, Verdi’s Four Sacred Songs, and the Fauré Requiem. Repertoire for smaller works has featured compositions by Ysaye Barnwell, Chen Yi, Lonnie Norwood, Florence Price, Manuel M. Ponce, Henry Purcell, and Marc-Antoine Charpentier.\n\nThe DePaul Choirs are comprised of the DePaul Chamber Choir, the DePaul Concert Choir, and the DePaul Symphonic Choir.\n\nMembership in the DePaul choirs is open to all DePaul students, subject to audition.\n\nAlways a venue for exceptional talent, DePaul Opera Theatre produces two or three full-length operas each year.

The opera program is led by Harry Silverstein, who has directed at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, San Francisco, New York City, and English National Operas and for companies in Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, and The Netherlands.\n\nMembership in DePaul Opera Theatre is open to all DePaul students, subject to audition.

The ensemble provides students with opportunities to develop further their understanding of medium and large ensemble performance practices; to improve improvisational knowledge and conceptual understanding of contemporary ensemble concepts and techniques; and to sharpen rhythmic flexibility, interpretative skills, section and ensemble phrasing techniques, and dynamic sensitivity.\n\nMembership in the DePaul Jazz Workshop is open to all DePaul students, with placements made based on audition results and the ensemble's needs.\n\nThomas Matta, Director\n\nFocusing on the traditional and contemporary repertoire for the standard big band instrumentation, the DePaul Jazz Ensemble performs a variety of works penned by contemporary and classic arrangers and composers, including new works.

With repertoire ranging from classic standards to contemporary compositions and arrangements, students perform music from premier arrangers of vocal jazz as well as emerging composers/arrangers within DePaul’s own Jazz Studies program. By exploring both classic jazz and other contemporary commercial music singing styles and techniques, students develop their skills in advanced harmony, improvisation, syncopation, ensemble blending, microphone technique, idiomatic phrasing, dynamics, solo and small group ensemble singing, sight reading, jazz arranging, and choral conducting.\n\nDePaul Vocal Jazz Ensemble membership is open to all DePaul students, subject to audition.\n\nThomas Matta, Coordinator of the Jazz Combo program\n\nPerformance in jazz combos plays a significant and required role in the education and curriculum of Jazz Studies students at DePaul. Jazz combos provide students with opportunities to develop individual and personal approaches to and an understanding of common performance practices of small jazz ensembles.\n\nCombos vary in size and instrumentation and are generally formed at the beginning of the academic year, with rosters and personnel remaining intact throughout the year. Jazz combos rehearse and are coached weekly by a jazz faculty member, culminating in an audio-recorded concert performance at each quarter’s end. Additionally, each combo will generally participate annually in at least one studio recording session. Additional performance opportunities on and off campus are a regular part of the program’s activities.\n\nMembership in the Jazz Combo program is open to all DePaul Jazz Studies majors and to School of Music students, subject to audition results and permission of the Coordinator of the Jazz Combo program.\n\nChamber Music at DePaul is a significant part of every student’s education and is a requirement for performance majors. The Chamber Music program is varied and extensive. During any given quarter, there might be 20 or more small ensembles rehearsing and being coached by faculty. Each group performs at the end of each quarter. Various chamber groups include small wind, strings, mixed, woodwind, and brass groups, in addition to the possibility of a brass ensemble or trombone ensemble. Baroque Ensemble and Percussion Ensemble are just two of the many chamber groups available every quarter.\n\nBaroque Ensemble\n\nJason Moy, Director\n\nThe DePaul Baroque Ensemble is dedicated to performing instrumental and vocal chamber music from the 16th through mid-18th centuries. Student ensembles are coached on performance practice and other techniques that will enable them to play this music in a historically informed manner, with particular emphasis given to musical rhetoric and style, ornamentation, and improvisation. Although students play on modern instruments, ensembles are augmented by the School of Music's historical instrument collection of three harpsichords, a chamber organ, and a set of Baroque bows, all of which are available for students to use in performing repertoire ranging from instrumental/vocal trios and quartets to music for chamber orchestra.\n\nPercussion Ensemble\n\nMichael Kozakis, Director\n\nThe Percussion Ensemble consists of 15-18 percussion majors who perform a large variety of music expressly written for percussion. The ensemble is dedicated to balancing historically significant works and the latest contemporary works. The ensemble performs fall, winter, and spring concerts and performances at student recitals and clinics, including the 2003 Yamaha Orchestral Percussion Seminar. Performances include a mix of works written for the small chamber group to the large percussion orchestra. The ensemble has been able to perform with several guest artists, including Brett Dietz, Eric Millstein, and Michael Burritt."
