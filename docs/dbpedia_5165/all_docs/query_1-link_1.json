        "text": "§ Colonel GRIFFITH-BOSCAWEN\n\nThe hon. Member and his friends are determined if they can to get such a measure through in the interregnum. We have seen an amusing scramble between hon. Members for Ireland and hon. Members for Wales as to who are to have preference. It was amicably settled at Holyhead the 1520 other day. The hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. Ellis Griffith), and the hon. Member for Waterford (Mr. John Redmond) met and talked about the brotherhood which existed between the two kindred Celtic people. Even that little friendly gathering was rather marred by the fact that the hon. Member for East Denbighshire (Mr. John) found himself unable to be present, because he did not agree with the policy of the hon. Member for Waterford. At all events he was not allowed to take the chair, for that would not have conduced to the brotherhood of two kindred peoples. I am at all events right in saying that it is perfectly clear that it is the intention of the Government and of the various parties who support it by a process of marvellous log-rolling to rush both Welsh Disestablishment and Home Rule through the present Parliament without either matter ever having been properly discussed by the country at all.\n\nWe heard a good deal this evening from the Prime Minister as to what mandate the Government had for Home Rule. The Prime Minister told us how he spent his Easter holidays driving through a beautiful part of the country in Surrey, and saw everywhere on the hoardings posters telling the people that if they voted for the Government it would mean Home Rule for Ireland; and he built from that theory that the country had been consulted on Home Rule and had agreed to it. Can the Prime Minister really suggest that in the case of Welsh Disestablishment the country was consulted at all? In what way? Take the election addresses. First of all I take the election 1521 addresses of the members for Wales who support the Government. Twenty-one of the Government candidates for Welsh constituencies issued election addresses. Of those only eight mentioned the subject at all. [An HON. MEMBER: \"Will the hon. Gentleman give the names?\"] I am sure the Committee would not wish me to read all the names if I had them. Of two other hon. Members out of the total number, one referred in vague terms to the great advantages of what he called religious equality. What religious equality may be I do not know, except if you are going to equally confiscate endowments of other religious bodies besides those of the Church.\n\n1.0 A.M.\n\nOn this great and burning question at all events the Welsh people are supposed to have made up their minds, yet only eight out of twenty-one candidates thought fit to mention the subject at all, and two others spoke about religious equality. [An HON. MEMBER: \"Will the hon. Gentleman give the names of the twenty-one candidates? \"] The hon. Member knows the names perfectly well. This election, which is supposed to have settled the question in Wales, resulted in our winning two boroughs in Wales, including the most important of all, namely, Cardiff. If you go back to the election of a previous Parliament, the only election at which there was anything like a referendum on the question of Welsh Disestablishment, which took place in 1895, and was directly upon the Welsh Disestablishment Bill, we then won seven seats. I am perfectly certain that if the question were put to the Welsh people again as clearly as it was in 1895 we should win at least all these seven seats.\n\nLet me refer to another point. This, after all, is not only a Welsh question. You are seeking to dismember the Church of England as a whole. You are seeking, if the Government proposals be carried out, to cut away four dioceses, and these the oldest dioceses of the Church of England, to divide the Church of England into two parts. You are seeking to do what you would never propose to do for a moment in the case of Nonconformists. I should like to see what kind of reception you would get if you brought in a Bill to seperate the Wesleyans in Wales from the Wesleyans in England, or if you sought to separate the Calvinists in Wales from the Calvinists in England.\n\n§ Colonel GRIFFITH-BOSCAWEN\n\nAn hon. Member opposite says \"Yes.\" Well, there are 210 supporters of the Government returned for English constituencies. How many of these mentioned Welsh Disestablishment on their election addresses? Only four. There are also six who spoke about religious equality. Granting that the whole of these six intended to convey disestablishment in England or Wales, or both, only ten out of 210 thought fit to mention this matter at the last general election. Yet you now come before this House and propose a Bill of this sort for which there can be no pretence of any mandate whatever, which has never been before the country at all, and has never been considered by the country, which was rejected by the country on the only occasion on which it was brought before them at all. Is it seriously contended that this Bill has got a mandate and that it is to go through the House of Commons and not to be revised in another place and become law at once. Whatever may be the 1523 case of Home Rule—I admit it is a very strong case—I mean a very strong case on my side—for exemption from the Clause I say the case of Welsh Disestablishment is even stronger, and I do appeal to the Government in this matter to give us some justice. They must see how manifestly unfair it is to force a measure of this sort through when it has never been before the country in any shape whatever.\n\nLet one take another point. When the Government some years ago first came in I know they had to deal with the aspirations of hon. Members from Wales. They appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into the real facts about the Church in Wales, and the Prime Minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, said:— That owing to the absence of official information on the questions which were now being submitted to the Royal Commission, the Government of the day were exposed to a good deal of embarrassment in the framing and conduct of the measure. Well, the Royal Commission sat and reported, but, mark the fact, that it never reported until the very moment when the general election took place. It was quite impossible for this Report to be before the country at all. My belief is that the Report was deliberately held back in order that the people should not know what the nature of the Report was. The facts are that the Report absolutely smashed all the old arguments in favour of Welsh Disestablishment, it proved that far from being the miserable minority which it was alleged to be, it was the largest and strongest religious body in the Principality, and proved also that it was the only religious body showing any real life or progress. That Report destroyed absolutely the old theory that it was an alien Church. It destroyed all the old arguments that were used in this House fifteen years ago, and further showed that these proposals for disendowment would take away from the Church all it had got in the way of endowment except 1s. 5½d. in the £.\n\n§ Colonel GRIFFITH-BOSCAWEN\n\nIt is a fact, and these are the figures. If the hon. Member chooses to contest the conclusions of the Royal Commission let him do so, but he will find that these are the figures. Yet that Report was never put before the public, because it was brought out too late for the people at the last election to have an opportunity to judge it, and we are told that a mandate has been given in 1524 favour of Welsh Disestablishment, and that this matter must be rushed through over the provisions of this Clause.\n\nI want now to look at the question from a broader aspect. I have been dealing so far with the specific proposal which the Government have made to the House, and I say further that a great question affecting the establishment and endowment of the Church ought, whether it be the Church in England or the Church in Wales or the Church in Scotland, to be exempt from the provisions of a clause like this. Of course, I am aware, so far as the church in Scotland goes, there is no direct attack upon it at the present moment, not at any rate in the form it took a few years ago. But I remember that in the first Parliament in which I sat a Suspensory Bill was brought in with regard to the Church in Scotland, and at any moment a similar action might be taken by the Government of the day, and either a Suspensory Disestablishment Bill or a Suspensory Disendowment Bill forced through this House with regard to the Church in Scotland without any control on the part of the Second Chamber.\n\nA question of this sort ought to be exempt from the provisions of this Clause, and I will remind the House of this, that when the Act of Union was passed between England and Ireland the churches of England and of Ireland were united, and it was enacted \"that the continuance and preservation of the said united church shall be deemed and taken to be an essential and fundamental part of the union.\" Of course, I am aware it suits them because the Church of Ireland has been disestablished. Yes, but that was by the concurrence of both Houses. [Some laughter.] Surely the House of Lords assented to the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, otherwise it could not have become an Act of Parliament. Therefore I submit that in the same way any measure of this sort affecting the Church of England or the Church of Scotland should not be carried by the fiat of one assembly, but should be submitted to the Second Chamber. For these reasons I move my Amendment.\n\n§ Mr. CHURCHILL\n\nThe Government and, I think, the Committee will recognise very readily that the hon. Gentleman and his friends have full justification for bringing forward an Amendment of this character. They, as a party, feel very strongly—it is an old and long tradition of their party—the importance of the 1525 maintenance of the endowed and Established Church. We can quite understand that they would wish that an Amendment excluding that church from the provisions of the Parliament Bill should be discussed and voted upon during the course of our debates to-day. Therefore I do not in the least quarrel with the hon. Gentleman, nor should I attempt to reply in any controversial spirit to his painstaking speech though I think there were one or two points—for instance, that where he tried to prove, by analysing election addresses, that the Welsh representatives were not in favour of Welsh Disestablishment. There were one or two such passages which might under more favourable circumstances have aroused considerable feelings of controversy. But this is not the time to discuss the merits of Welsh Disestablishment or the scope and character of such a measure as that.\n\nI do not think the hon. Gentleman would feel that we could with much advantage discuss the subject of mandate on this subject. After all, he knows perfectly well that the Liberal Party and other Liberal Governments have brought forward Bills dealing with the disestablishment of the Church of Wales. He knows perfectly well, experienced politician as he is, that the principle of disestablishment and the actual measure of Disestablishment of the Welsh Church has been an essential part of the political programme of every Member, I think, who has been elected to support a Liberal administration or a Liberal Party in opposition. Therefore, I do not think the question of the merits or of mandate require discussion at the present time. We are again at the same question we have been discussing during these past two days of our debates—of whether organic or Constitutional questions of a peculiar character should be exempted from the scope of the Parliament Bill. To that we have only one answer. We consider that the machinery of the Bill and the safeguards this Bill provides are adequate and sufficient for the discussion and passage into law of all measures and all legislative proposals and changes which may be made to Parliament and which may receive the assent of the House of Commons. That being so, I trust I have carefully endeavoured to avoid anything like a controversial tone, because we have got a good deal of work to do. An agreement having been reached, I do not think we should sit unduly late. With every desire to avoid anything which may 1526 cause hon. Gentlemen irritation, I am bound to meet this Amendment as we have met so many others which produce the same argument in the same tone.\n\n§ Mr. LONG\n\nThe right hon. Gentleman tells us that in face of the agreement we have arrived at we should avoid controversy. He certainly has done so. But it is not a question of agreement at all. This is a very simple matter. It is within the power of the Government to lay down what shall be the limits of debate and discussion. It is within the power of the Government to say whether we shall do our business within certain time. The Government may do so, but it is not a question of agreement. It is a question of our having to bow to those who are in authority. We have studied to make the best use of the time at our disposal and my hon. Friend has moved an Amendment which is of first-rate importance. The Home Secretary meets it by telling us that the Government have got a mandate and that it has been part of the policy of the Liberal party from time immemorial and so on. I suppose I am an old Member of the House of Commons. I remember when this question was not only controversial between the two Parties but was extremely controversial in the Party opposite. Within quite recent times a great many Members opposite thought it necessary to state that although they were ardently in favour of Radical measures one thing they were not in favour of was the disestablishment of the Church. In the late Parliament there were distinguished Members of the Party opposite who more than once on the floor of the House said that while they were Radical in everything else they resisted the disestablishment of the Church.\n\n§ Mr. LONG\n\nNo. Parliaments under the present regime follow so rapidly that I should have said the last Parliament but one. I am not talking of Welsh Members. My hon. Friend in moving his Amendment referred to the question of addresses, and his reference was met with laughter on the part of Gentlemen opposite. It seems to me we come in Debate every day to some fresh Parliamentary doctrine. It used to be understood quite recently that Members seeking to enter the House of Commons put into their addresses references to the subjects they thought to be of importance, and which they thought ought 1527 to be dealt with by Parliament; but now, apparently, the reverse is the doctrine. Now it is not the thing which is in the address, but which is left out of the address that matters in the eyes of hon. Gentlemen opposite. They argue: we do not put this into our addresses not because it is not important, but because we think something else is important. That makes it difficult to understand what legislation hon. Gentlemen who have adopted that doctrine wish to carry out. So far as the Amendment is concerned, I think it is a very proper one, and one which I think in different circumstances we might well have discussed for a very considerable time. But we are up against a brick wall. The Government are determined to carry their legislation in their own way. I do not think it would be much good to pursue at any great length the Debate, because I think what we are called upon to do is to realise and to ask the Government to realise what is their new policy. They ask us to agree to their view, that they have a mandate for every kind of legislation, and that they are therefor entitled to use the Parliament Bill to give effect to these measures. It is not worth while arguing that. What we are entitled to say is that is not a question of mandate, it is not a question of the will of the people, it is not a question of democratic legislation.\n\nLet us put all that nonsense on one side. It is a question of what the Government or what the Members on the Front Bench for the time being desire to carry into law. Having laid down their conditions their party are bound to support them or turn them out. They do not want to turn them out because they would possibly find someone else in their places. Therefore the legislation of the Government becomes the legislation of the day. Let us have no nonsense about the mandate of the people or the will of the people. What you are really doing is to give to the Government of the day power to carry any legislation they choose. They choose to include Welsh Disestablishment. We cannot resist it, but we can protest against it and my hon. Friend is justified in moving the Amendment, and we are justified in making our protest. But beyond that we cannot carry the contest. But we are entitled to ask in the first place that hon. Gentlemen opposite who are unwilling to take part in the Debate should at all events be courteous and be governed by the ordinary rules 1528 which have governed Debates ever since I have been a Member of this House and not to interrupt with interruptions not known under the old Parliamentary law. We are also entitled to say that in accepting the conditions in which we find ourselves we do not do so because we agree with the position the Government take up, but because we realise that to prolong the controversy is futile and that the Government are really seeking for themselves the right to carry legislation to which we object, for which they have not the mandate of the people, and which is not the legislation the people desire, the Government being the authority on what shall be done or what not.\n\nMr. GRIFFITH\n\nI was wrong then in attributing the failure of the hon. Member to only one reason. He had many, no doubt, but the chief and main reason of his defeat is the question to which I have referred. I am not going to follow the hon. Member into the merits of this controversy, and I do not think it would be in order to do so. He is not quite well informed on the subject of the Welsh Commission. As he is now a Member for Dudley it does not matter very much, but the hon. Member who sits next to him is an authority on the matter. I am sure if he cares to get up and contradict his hon. Friend on his left he will do so. The Welsh Commission proves this: the Welsh Church is in a minority as compared with the Free Churches of Wales as one to three or one to four. I take silence to mean consent on that point. So it really comes to this, that at any rate the Church of England in Wales is in a substantial or unsubstantial minority; and the real point we are discussing now is granted.\n\n1529 Most hon. Members will agree that for forty years in Wales this has been the main paramount issue to the people of Wales in deciding general elections. At eleven general elections the Welsh people have returned a majority of five to one in favour of this question. Since 1886 the National Liberal Federation has put it in a foremost place in its programme, and with regard to the general election of 1906, the late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman said it remained an integral part of the Liberal programme. In 1909 it \"was promised in the session of 1910. What was said by the leaders of the Liberal party at the last General Election? The Liberals ran the risk of being in favour of Disestablishment and if the Conservatives lost in many cases it was because they resisted the proposal. The Prime Minister said on 25th November, \"In a speech I made at the Albert Hall nearly a year ago I dwelt on some of the causes that we believe are in our keeping. I adhere to everything I said then. I spoke of Welsh Disestablishment \"—the very first question he mentioned—\"of the abolition of the Parliamentary veto, of a better licensing system, and of a national system of education.\" Curiously enough the hon. Member for East Worcester was speaking on the same day at Glasgow and he said, \"Any of the changes once discussed might be passed into law over their heads. It would have a right to disestablish as many churches as it liked. [A VOICE: 'Not of Scotland.'] Yes, of Scotland, and without consulting the Scottish people.\" That was what your leaders told the people. In spite of that threat the Scottish people again supported the Liberal party.\n\nBut I have a still higher authority than the Prime Minister and an ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer. I have a Bishop, and I will quote his words. Writing to \"The Times\" newspaper of 3rd December, 1910, the Bishop of St. David's said:— As a Bishop whose diocese Mr. Asquith is pledged to deprive of 87,500 out of 94,000 a year of endowments, I appeal to churchmen to vote for the Unionist proposal of a Referendum on all matters of great gravity. The Bishop wanted the Referendum. Well we have had the Referendum, so far as this matter is concerned, in Wales for forty years. [HON. MEMBERS: \"When?\"] At every general election. I venture to tell anyone who does not know anything about Wales that not a single Liberal Member for Wales has not been in favour of Welsh Disestablishment. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for St. George's, 1530 Hanover Square (Mr. A. Lyttelton) in his election address said:— The Parliament Bill once passed, a Radical Government, if faithful to its pledges, would carry Home Rule, Disestablishment and Disendowment of the Welsh Church, and destroy religious education in Church schools. In these circumstances can anyone come to any other conclusion than that the Prime Minister, as leader of the Liberal party, made this question part of the programme on which he appealed to the country? Leaders of the Conservative party, with their Bishops and other supporters, made it perfectly clear to the country that if they voted for a Liberal they were running the risk of having the Welsh Church disestablished and disendowed. The people have taken the risk. It is clear that this question is within the ambition of the Government's mandate. We have already waited too long. We in Wales who voted for the Parliament Bill did not vote for it as an end in itself, but as a means to an end. That is its real justification. It would be in accordance with the decision of the voters at the general election that the Parliament Bill shall apply to the disestablishment in Wales, and that the veto hitherto possessed by the peers shall be overridden.\n\nI think that in this Parliament we shall have religious equality. It is a strange thing to me that the hon. Member (Colonel Griffith-Boscawen) in his brief candidature was not told by one of the miners what religious equality meant in Wales. Religious equality and disestablishment are really the same thing. [HON. MEMBERS: \"And disendowment?\"] It is a little late to begin a lesson on these elementary points, but really it is so. The hon. Member for Dudley (Colonel Griffith-Boscawen) compared the establishment in Wales to the position of the Wesleyan body in the Free Church Council. However that may be we have been sent here by the electors of Wales to support this Bill not because we believe in it by itself, but because we have always found the House of Lords has been directly antagonistic to all Welsh reforms, not only in connection with our schools, but in every direction, and because we believe in the pledge of the Government that in this Parliament we shall at least have religious equality.\n\n§ Mr. ORMSBY-GORE\n\nI wish to be brief and have no desire to go outside the rules of order and follow the path into which I might have been easily led by the hon. Member for Anglesey and discuss the actual merits of the question of the Disestablishment of the Church in Wales. 1532 I wish to point out here that there is a special case for allowing the question of disestablishment, especially Welsh disestablishment, to remain outside the provisions of the Bill owing to the peculiar constitutional position of that establishment. I was endeavouring to prove that, according to my own notion, following upon the words of the Prime Minister spoken the other day, it is not strictly constitutional for Parliament to dismember the Church of England. I was endeavouring to point out that the question of disestablishment is an exceedingly difficult one to discuss, because there is no Act of Parliament establishing the established Church. It is a product of certain constitutional usages which date back to the time before Parliament existed and which resulted in this, that the Church of England is represented specifically in a body known as Convocation. Since before Parliament all the Welsh dioceses have been represented in the Convocation of Canterbury. Since before Edward I summoned Parliament the representatives of the Welsh Church were summoned to the Convocation at Canterbury. I suggest—adopting the Prime Minister's statement the other day—that whatever the difference between the legal powers of the two Houses of Parliament, we can make out a particularly strong case on the question of disestablishment for maintaining that if ever the Government does take it in hand it should take it as a whole, and that it should not go in for disestablishing a part of the Church or taking away part of its temporalities.\n\nThat is one point which I would urge most respectfully upon the Government. The relation between Convocation and Parliament is a particularly interesting one historically, and it is one which shows that the Church has historically, and by the constitutional usage of this House, a free and exclusive right to its own position, and to draw up its own composition in Convocation and things of that kind. That has been the constitutional usage. I know an Act of Parliament can do anything, legally. An Act of Parliament can turn a man into a woman. It can do anything; but the question is whether it is constitutionally feasible or constitutionally right. Under this Bill you could destroy and dissolve a Constitution as old as that of Parliament itself, one absolutely separate from that of Parliament, and which exists, not subordinate to Parliament, but parallel with it. I submit that is not a highly controversial point, and does not raise any 1533 purely controversial question such as those raised on the opposite side of the House.\n\nI wish to say a few words next on the subject of the mandate. I absolutely agree with other Members on this side of the House that the Amendment should be accepted because the question has not been submitted adequately or fully to the electors either of Wales or of England or Scotland. It is a question which in many places is far more keenly felt than the question of Home Rule, and of Ulster and other parts of Ireland. People feel very keenly in this House on the matter as they do in Wales. Churchmen everywhere feel very keenly upon this point, and I do submit that if you examine the records of the last two elections it is perfectly plain that the great religious questions were absolutely avoided. In January, 1910, the question of the Budget and the question of the Constitution, and questions like Tariff Reform, were prominent, and the same at the last election. I remember two nights after my own election coming into the street in one of the Montgomery boroughs: I remember distinctly having the Liberal candidate's last word given into my hands as I went to address a meeting, and I remember distinctly there was never a mention of disestablishment or disendowment, but there was a flaring placard, \"Vote for Humphreys-Owen and no Bread Taxes.\" That was the sum total. Was this question properly put before the electors of Wales? Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who has been mentioned by one speaker, mentioned this question in a speech in England, but when he came to Wales he never mentioned it. He came down to Wales and spoke at Wrexham, and he was specially warned not to mention it by the hon. Member who now sits for East Glamorgan.\n\n§ Lord HUGH CECIL\n\nI wish to be very brief and to carry with me, as far as I 1535 can, the opinions and sentiments of hon. Members on that side of the House as well as on this side. I think I can put a proposition which will not meet with much opposition on that side of the House. Here is a proposal which weighs very hard and heavily upon our feelings. We feel very deeply and warmly upon it. We say, \"You may ask us to make this sacrifice, but in any country ruled over by methods of self-government we cannot be asked to do it except in obedience to the will of the people.\" I can see the answer, and I am purposely putting my finger upon it. I can see the answer which the hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. Ellis Griffith) will give. He will say, \"The Welsh people are against you on that point.\" Well, I do very earnestly protest against the doctrine that this matter can be determined solely by the population of Wales.\n\nObserve what happened in the case of the Irish Church. In the case of the Irish Church the matter was certainly submitted to the whole of the United Kingdom, and the whole of the United Kingdom was deeply interested because beyond all doubt the question dominated the issue alone at a General Election. We have now no mandate on this question, but certainly in that case there was as near a decision on that great question as you could hope to get, though not to my mind a very satisfactory one. In this case no one will pretend that outside Wales, or even inside Wales, according to my hon. Friend who has just spoken on that point, the question of Welsh Disestablishment was given that sort of decision or anything distantly approaching to it. It was altogether a subordinate matter and was not an issue at all in Scotland and Ireland, and was altogether a subordinate matter in England.\n\nI will not put it so far as that the whole of the constituencies of the United Kingdom should give their views. It is perfectly plain that England and Wales are entitled to be heard, and I will not repeat the arguments of my hon. Friend. Look how deeply it strikes into the organisation of the English Church. The Province of Canterbury would be dismembered. The Convocation of Canterbury would be broken up, and, indeed, there are other points—like the districts which lie over the Welsh border in England, and which it would be necessary to legislate for. Supposing you 1536 had Welsh Home Rule and English Home Rule you would have to pass a Bill for Welsh Disestablishment either through the Imperial Parliament or through both the English House and the Welsh House. Therefore it is an English issue. It is a matter in which we have a right to say the English people have a right to pronounce upon. I may not carry hon. Members with me, but it is my strong opinion that a very decided majority of England and Wales taken together are against disestablishment. I think they have always been against it, and I think the feeling is moving in a direction away from Welsh Disestablishment. Take the broader ground than the mere technical and legal ground. Cannot hon. Gentlemen sympathise with what we feel when we are told that the opinion of the English people should not weigh in this matter? Why, it is our church; it is the church of which we are members.\n\nHon. Members go so far sometimes as to say it is an alien church. I think they are wrong. You cannot, however, say it is an English church, and at the same time say the English people are not concerned in the faith of it. I do appeal to hon. Members, and especially to Nonconformists. I have never doubted that great respect ought to be had for Nonconformist wishes. I put it to them, accepting as they do democratic self-government as the common basis, is it honest or fair to assume consent from the English and Welsh people taken together, which, in the circumstances, you cannot be sure of, and which, I am confident, does not exist; is it fair, when the whole country has been thinking of the fiscal, the constitutional and other issues, to slip through this Bill without any further appeal—a matter which touches so deeply the conscience and spiritual feelings of your countrymen? Would Nonconformists like themselves to be so treated? If our mother church is to be turned into the street at least give us, her children, a voice in the matter. It is, indeed, bound to us by the tenderest ties of affection. It is not the case that the English people do not feel for the common church. We say that this church is neither of the Church of England or of Wales, it is the common heritage of both people. What I would plead for is that the will of the people should be consulted and that a matter of this kind, which cuts so deeply into our hearts, should be carried only by the will of the people. The course 1537 hon. Members opposite are upon is a course repellant to them as good Christian men and honest men. It is a course which I am sure is neither Christian nor honest.\n\n§ Mr. JAMES HOPE\n\nmoved, in Sub-section (1), after the word \"Bill\" [\"If any Bill other than a Money Bill\"], to insert the words \"or a Bill affecting the independence of the judiciary or restricting the rights of the subject to trial by jury or appeal to a higher court.\"\n\nThe point I would make is, that the independence of the judiciary and the safeguarding of the subject for the independent determination of his case are the very last matters that ought to be the subject of any hasty change by any drastic constitutional procedure. The position at which we have arrived is the result of very slow evolution. Formerly the independence of the judiciary was, as is well known, affected by the prerogative of the Crown, and certain Acts to restrict that independence may be found during the Tudor period and part of the Stuart period. In the time of the Civil Wars this House took it upon itself to review judicial decisions and even to pass criminal sentences. These abuses were the subject of controversy, and gradually the independence of the judiciary was I established by placing them as far as possible away from the direct review of Parliament. That was the reason for the salaries of the judges being placed on the; Consolidated Fund, so that their decisions might not be reviewed in the ordinary course of Debate.\n\nI submit to the Committee that there is a real need that something of this kind should be maintained, and that this House should not directly or indirectly take upon itself, except for the most formal procedure and after due deliberation, to take: any steps that would lessen the complete I 1542 independence of the judges. It must be their duty occasionally to give unpopular decisions, and being men, they may occasionally give unfortunate decisions, and decisions that arouse a considerable degree of popular passion. These things are not of the same gravity and do not have the same consequences they would have if the judges were directly subordinate to and amenable to this House, and therefore any measure which places them in that position is one that ought to be assented to only after the strictest constitutional procedure, and is not fitting to be brought about by the summary changes proposed in this Clause. We have seen symptoms of great restive-ness against judicial decisions, so much so that a Minister of the Crown—\n\n§ Mr. JAMES HOPE\n\nI do not think I am out of order in saying that I was not present during the whole of that discussion, but, so far as I was present, I did not hear the remarks of the Minister of the Crown—the President of the Board of Education—referred to in the course of that discussion. The President of the Board of Education, as I understand the tenor of his remarks, did say that the conduct of the judiciary was a proper subject for the ordinary animadversion of this House and that they might be made accountable to this House. That is what I want to guard against by this Amendment. Although resentments might be felt in the ordinary course, it would be most unfortunate if, in the heat of the moment, if the judges were abused by a 1543 discussion in this House, and if their status and independence were threatened by debates in this House. I want to preserve the independence that has been won by many a hard struggle in the past. There are symptoms in the criticisms of to-day which seem to threaten them. That is the first point.\n\nAs regards the right of the subject to trial by jury and appeal to the High Court it is a kindred subject, though I do not think there is any pressing, any immediate, attack upon the right of the subject to trial by jury. With regard to the right of appeal, we have seen some matters in the first draft of the Finance Act of 1909, in which it was proposed that there should be taxation practically imposed without appeal, except to a court which was immediately amenable to the Government. It was evidence of a very dangerous tendency of the times, and one against which it is necessary to guard. Once the appeal from the ordinary Court of First Instance is done away with the jurisdiction of that Court of First Instance becomes itself impaired. It is essential to its judicial authority that its decisions should be open to be revised by a higher court, and any measure to take away that appeal should not be passed by any hasty or drastic procedure, and ought only to be accepted on the whole authority of Parliament as understood in the past. It is on these grounds that I move the Amendment.\n\n§ Mr. SANDYS\n\nI cannot quite understand the position which the Government have taken up on this Question. It appears to me, in view of the fact that they evidently intend to carry changes of an exceedingly revolutionary character, that once this Bill is passed into law there is no reason why we should suppose that some of these Constitutional rights of the British people could not possibly under this new scheme be attacked in the future. Therefore I think my hon. Friend was quite justified in bringing forward this Amendment in order to make perfectly certain that some of our most important privileges, namely, trial by jury and the preservation of the inviolability of the Court of Appeal, should be definitely provided for and maintained. Therefore I support the Amendment, and I hope the Government may see their way to reconsider it and allow it to be passed.\n\nThe arguments the Attorney-General brought forward in his somewhat brief speech did not impress me very much. He asked us not to accept this Amendment because of the action o£ the Government at the time when the original Finance Act 1547 was under consideration. He pointed out that under the Finance Act the fullest possible appeal was given to His Majesty's judges, but at the same time he incidentally mentioned that that right of appeal was only granted if a Debate had taken place in the House of Commons. Therefore he must acknowledge that it was the original intention of the Government, if they had been allowed to do so to abolish that right of appeal. I think that admission is sufficient to justify this Amendment and to justify my hon. Friend in pressing it to a division.?"
