        "text": "My mother, who died suddenly when I was a teenager, is buried alongside her ancestors in a historic mausoleum in the area of Cairo known as the City of the Dead. It’s the oldest continuously used Muslim cemetery in the world, and its history traces back to the seventh century. My ancestors chose this burial place in order to be near Imam al-Shafi’i, a ninth-century holy man who rests in a magnificent shrine there. My family has five mausoleums in the vicinity; the oldest is from the 1790s. From the outside they resemble the courtyarded houses of medieval Cairo. Inside there are gardens, carved marble cenotaphs and ornately decorated rooms, hung with dusty chandeliers, where grievers used to hold all-night vigils on holidays and death anniversaries.\n\nFor the most part, the tradition of spending the night among the dead has itself died out, but many of these rooms are still inhabited by families: At least half a million — perhaps several times that number — of Egypt’s poorest live in and among the tombs. Undertakers, calligraphers, caretakers, florists, masons and professional mourners have for many generations resided in the homes built by Cairenes for their dead. The City of the Dead has always been a city of the living as well.\n\nI’ve been visiting my mother’s grave regularly for 22 years. I have gotten to know some of the families that live in and care for our mausoleums and who hang their laundry across the tombs to dry in the breeze. My visits and the small acts of tending to the dead helped me make meaning out of a meaningless loss. We planted bougainvillea and set up umbrellas to shade the courtyard where we offer prayers. During my visits I became interested in the history of my family and of Egypt. With access to the national archives largely forbidden by state security — it wants to admit only those friendly to nationalist narratives — I made the cemetery an archive of my own. The City of the Dead does not house just my own personal memories; it is one of the last remaining open repositories of Egypt’s historical memory."
