        "text": "Asyut in Middle Egypt has been a regional centre from as early as Dynasty 6. The city was a centre of Christianity in the First Millennium AD. As an episcopal see, its history is associated with Bishop Meletius at the beginning of the 4th century AD and Bishop Constantine at the turn of the 6th and 7th centuries AD. The city was also home to St John of Lycopolis in the 4th century AD. The ancient city is almost completely lost under the strata of the alluvial plain, which is in turn covered by the rapidly growing modern city. Accordingly, archaeological evidence for the First Millennium AD city of Asyut is scarce. Columns dating back to early Christian times can occasionally be encountered in the cellars of houses in the historic centre at a depth of approximately 5m. The location of these columns is identical to that of the temple of the god Wepwawet from the pharaonic period at a depth of approximately 8m, suggesting continuity in the sacred landscape. In contrast to the city itself, the Gebel Asyut algharbi, a limestone mountain located to the west of Asyut at the edge of the Libyan Desert, provides far more information on ancient Asyut. The mountain rises to a height of up to 200m above sea level. During the pharaonic period, Gebel Asyut al-gharbi served as a necropolis for the inhabitants of Asyut, high officials among them, as well as for sacred animals. In addition to this, several areas of the mountain were exploited as a quarry. Christian anchorites––St John of Lycopolis (4th century AD) the most famous among them––lived on the mountain during the First Millennium AD and monasteries were erected on Gebel Asyut al-gharbi soon afterwards; Deir el-Meitin and Deir el-Azzam are especially noteworthy examples.\n\nWhile every pharaoh was understood to hold an elevated status with respect to the world of the divine, certain rulers seem to have achieved a special place within the Egyptian pantheon. Any king could expect to be venerated among the royal ancestors and as a transfigured being after death. Some, however, became the object of more intense and specialized worship in life, death, or both. It is often asserted that Horemheb was among the rulers of Egypt who attained this kind of extraordinary divine status, but no systematic study of the evidence for his cult has ever been carried out. This paper examines both the scope and content of Horemheb's apparent deification, seeking to clarify the extent of his worship in life and in death, as well as the attributes that may have characterized him as a divine being. The paper also addresses the relationship between Horemheb's place in historical memory and his deification, asking whether his non-royal origin and the political upheaval that surrounded his reign may have played a part in the development of his cult."
