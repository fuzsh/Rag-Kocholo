This road is parallel with the railway line which runs south from Cairo main station and both railway and Sharia Abu Safein cross over the main road.\n\nAccess up to Sharia Abu Safein is by using the northside ramp above the main road underpass, on the east side of the railway.\n\n​\n\nVisiting Information\n\nOpening times:\n\nSaturday to Thursday: 7.00am to 1.30pm\n\nFriday: Closed\n\nPlease note that the cemetery gates are kept closed, although unlocked, during working hours.\n\nVisitors can best reach the cemetery by private car or taxi.\n\nVisitors are best advised to contact the Commission's Regional office in advance of their visit, who will advise the Head Gardener of the arrival.\n\nTel: +202 2290 1247 or +202 2419 5561. Please note the office closes at 12.30 GMT.\n\nHistorical Information\n\nAt the outbreak of the First World War, Cairo was headquarters to the United Kingdom garrison in Egypt. With Alexandria, it became the main hospital centre for Gallipoli in 1915 and later dealt with the sick and wounded from operations in Egypt and Palestine.\n\nGeneral Headquarters, Middle East Command, was set up in Cairo shortly before the Second World War, remaining there throughout the war years. In January 1941, a Royal Air Force Sector Headquarters for Fighter Defence Canal Zone was established.\n\nCairo was again a significant hospital centre during the Second World War.\n\nCairo War Memorial Cemetery was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer. It was formerly part of the New British Protestant Cemetery, but plots B, D, F, H, K, M, O, P and Q were ceded to the Commission in 1920. Some graves were brought into these plots from elsewhere in the Protestant cemetery and in 1960, 85 First World War graves were concentrated from Minia War Cemetery, 200 km south of Cairo, where maintenance could not be assured. One burial of the Second World War was also moved later from Old Cairo Old Latin Cemetery for the same reason.\n\nThere are now 2,056 Commonwealth casualties of the First World War and 340 from the Second World War buried or commemorated in the cemetery. A small number, known to have been buried in other civil cemeteries in Cairo but whose graves are now lost, are commemorated by special memorial.\n\nBurials in the following civil cemeteries are now alternatively commemorated in Cairo War Memorial Cemetery:\n\nCairo (Basatin) Jewish Cemetery\n\nOld Cairo Jewish Cemetery\n\nCairo Maronite Cemetery\n\nCairo Civil International Cemetery\n\nOld Cairo New Latin Cemetery\n\nCemetery pictures used with the permission of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission\n\n​\n\nMajor General John Charles (Jock) Campbell, V. C., D. S. O., M. C.\n\nGeneral Staff Commanding 7th Armoured Division and Royal Artillery, died 26th February 1942, aged 48. Plot K. 171.\n\nSon of D. A. Campbell and Marion Campbell; husband of Rosamond E. Campbell, of Northampton.\n\nCitation: The following particulars are given in \"The London Gazette,\" of 30th January, 1942 : In recognition of most conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty at Sidi Rezegh, in Libya. On 21st November 1941 Brigadier Campbell was commanding a small force holding important ground in the area of Sidi Rezegh Ridge and Aerodrome. The force was repeatedly attacked by large numbers of tanks and infantry. Wherever the situation was most difficult and the fighting hardest Brigadier Campbell was to be seen with his forward troops either on foot or in an open car. In this car he carried out several reconnaissances for counter attacks and formed up tanks, under close and intense fire. The following day the enemy attacks were intensified. Brigadier Campbell was always in the forefront of the heaviest fighting, encouraging his troops, staging counter-attacks and personally controlling the fire of his guns. During the final enemy onslaught he was wounded but continued most actively in the foremost positions, controlling the fire of batteries which inflicted heavy losses on enemy tanks at close range. Throughout these two days his magnificent example and his utter disregard of personal danger were an inspiration to his men and to all who saw him. His brilliant leadership was the direct cause of the very heavy casualties inflicted on the enemy. In spite of his wound he refused to be evacuated and remained with his command where his outstanding bravery and consistent determination had a marked effect in maintaining the splendid fighting spirit of those under him.\n\n1537 Trooper\n\nClive Arthur\n\n3rd Bn.
