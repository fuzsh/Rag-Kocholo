        "text": "İbrahim Paşa (born c. 1493, Párga [Greece]—died March 15, 1536, Constantinople, Ottoman Empire [now Istanbul, Turkey]) was an Ottoman grand vizier (1523–36) who played a decisive role in diplomatic and military events during the reign of Sultan Süleyman I (1520–66).\n\nİbrahim’s first military expedition was to Egypt (1524), where he reestablished order and introduced administrative and fiscal measures that solidified Ottoman authority there. After his Egyptian success, he was appointed commander in chief of the Danubian campaigns of 1526, 1529 (a siege of Vienna), and 1532. In 1533, vested with full powers, he represented the sultan in negotiations with the Holy Roman emperor Charles V over the Hungarian question; these negotiations established most of Hungary as tributary to the Ottomans and confirmed the extraordinary powers of the grand vizier.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nUnderstanding the Ottoman Empire"
