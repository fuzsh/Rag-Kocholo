        "text": "Egypt's first democratically elected president Mohamed Morsi was buried on Tuesday as calls mounted for an independent investigation into the causes of his death after he collapsed in a Cairo courtroom.\n\nMorsi, who was overthrown in 2013 by military after a year of rule and later charged with espionage, was buried at a cemetery in eastern Cairo's Medinat Nasr, one of his lawyers said.\n\nAbdel Moneim Abdel Maksoud said family members had washed Morsi's body and prayed the last rites early on Tuesday morning at the Leeman Tora Hospital.\n\nThat lies near the prison where Egypt's first civilian president, a prominent Muslim Brotherhood member, had been held for six years in solitary confinement and deteriorating health.\n\nA quiet funeral\n\nThe prosecutor general's office said the 67-year-old leader had collapsed and \"died as he attended a hearing\" in a retrial hearing Monday over alleged collaboration with foreign powers and militant groups.\n\nAbdel Maksoud told AFP news agency only around 10 family members and close Morsi confidants were present, including himself.\n\nAn AFP reporter saw a handful of mourners entering the cemetery complex, accompanied by police officers, but journalists were prevented from entering the site.\n\nThe graveyard is in the same suburb as the largest massacre in Egypt's modern history, the August 2013 crackdown on the sit-in at Rabaa Square, weeks after Morsi's ouster by the military.\n\nOver 800 people were killed in a single day as security forces moved against protesters calling for Morsi's reinstatement.\n\nThe attorney general's office said Morsi, who appeared \"animated,\" had addressed the court on Monday for five minutes before falling to the ground inside the defendants' cage.\n\nAnother of Morsi's lawyers, Osama El Helw, said other defendants had started banging loudly on the glass, \"screaming loudly that Morsi had died.\"\n\nThe attorney general said he had been \"transported immediately to the hospital\", where medics pronounced him dead, a version of events confirmed by a judicial source.\n\n'Why are you afraid'\n\n\"He [Morsi] is dead, but Egyptian authorities are afraid of his body. They didn't let his wife witness the burial. He was buried this morning in the presence of his two sons. Why are you afraid?\" Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.\n\n'Killing him slowly'\n\nSince Morsi's overthrow on July 3, 2013, his former defence minister, now President Abdel Fattah el Sisi, has waged an ongoing crackdown that has seen thousands of Muslim Brotherhood supporters jailed and hundreds facing death sentences.\n\nRights groups have called for an independent probe into Morsi's detention conditions and death.\n\nThe Brotherhood's political wing – the Freedom and Justice Party – accused Egyptian authorities of \"deliberately killing him slowly\" in solitary confinement.\n\n\"They withheld medication and gave him disgusting food,\" it said in a statement. \"They did not grant him the most basic human rights.\"\n\nThe Egyptian government has not officially commented on his death, but private television channels slammed the Brotherhood as a \"terrorist group\" and played a looping tagline: \"The Brothers are liars\".\n\nHis death barely rated a mention in the local press, which referred to him by his full name but not his position as former president.\n\nMorsi last saw his family in September 2018. A month later, one of his sons, Abdallah, was arrested.\n\nAbdel Maksoud was the last member of his defence team to see him, in November 2017.\n\nRights group Amnesty International urged Egyptian authorities to open \"an impartial, thorough and transparent investigation\" into his death.\n\nHuman Rights Watch echoed that demand, saying Morsi had suffered years of \"insufficient access to medical care\".\n\n\"The United Nations Human Rights Council... should establish an investigation into ongoing gross violations of human rights in Egypt, including widespread ill-treatment in prisons and Morsi's death,\" it said.\n\n'Premature death'\n\nA group of British parliamentarians in March 2018 warned that his detention conditions had not met international standards and could lead to his \"premature death\". Other Brotherhood leaders have also died in custody.\n\nAllies such as Qatar and Turkey paid tribute to Morsi, while Iran's Foreign Ministry called his death \"sad and unfortunate\".\n\nInternationally he received some support, but in his homeland, Morsi has a chequered legacy.\n\nHe spent just one turbulent year in office after the 2011 uprising, before being overthrown by the powerful military after protesters took to the streets demanding his resignation.\n\nHe has been in prison since his ouster, on trial on charges including for spying for Iran, Qatar, and groups such as Hamas.\n\nMorsi was also accused of plotting terrorist acts.\n\nHe was sentenced to death in May 2015 for his role in jailbreaks during the uprising that ousted his predecessor, longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak.\n\nMorsi's turbulent rule was marked by widening schisms in Egyptian society, a crippling economic crisis and often-deadly opposition protests.\n\nHis death comes days before Egypt hosts the Africa Cup of Nations football tournament, starting Friday.\n\nAuthorities have been on high alert, announcing on Facebook on Monday that thousands of forces would be deployed to secure venues.\n\nTRT Arabi blocked\n\nIn the meantime, Egypt has blocked access to TRT Arabi. In 2017 the government had blocked Qatari channel Al Jazeera, HuffPost Arabi and the independent website Mada Masr.\n\nA year later, hundreds of news sites and blogs were blocked and around a dozen people were arrested and charged with publishing false news, many of them journalists or prominent government critics.\n\nFuneral prayers for Morsi [in absentia] took place across Turkey and in several cities of Pakistan.\n\nTRT World’s Abubakr al Shamahi has more from Istanbul."
