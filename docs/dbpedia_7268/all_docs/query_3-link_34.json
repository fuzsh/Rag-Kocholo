        "text": "Pharaohs, Queens and Rulers of Egypt\n\nKings and Rulers of Egypt\n\nWith multiple monarchs and rulers who impacted the civilization over thousands of years, Egypt has a rich and complicated history.\n\nEgypt is renowned for its extensive historical archives, which lasted more than 6,000 years. Numerous well-known sites, like the Great Sphinx andthe Giza Pyramids, which are visible on many Egypt Day Tours, are examples of this rich cultural legacy. Countless historic sites, including Memphis and the Dahshur pyramids, can be found in Egypt. With a large range of alternatives to suit all preferences, Egypt is a popular destination for its historical heritage, culture, and traditions.\n\nMost famous Kings of Egypt\n\nYou can step with your foot onto Thebes (Luxor at present),Karnak Temple, and theValley of the Kings during a comfortableEgypt Nile River Cruise. Such sites exhibit this legacy and remain an important centre of scientific and popular interest. Egypt's lengthy and rich cultural heritage is an essential part of its national identity, which has endured and often assimilated several foreign influences, includingGreek, Persian,Roman, Arab, Ottoman Turkish, and ancient Nubia.\n\nList of rulers of Egypt\n\nEgypt was an early and important centre ofChristianity, but was largely Islamized in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country, albeit with a significant Christian community. This is a comprehensive guide to thehistory of Egypt's most prominent monarchs to learn about their architectural achievements before you see them in person during a lot ofCairo Day Tours. You can Explore more of our Egypt Vacations or select the suitable category from all our packages at Egypt Travel Packages!\n\nThe Life of Kings in Egypt\n\nThe Pharaohs in Egypt wanted to be very powerful and have control over many places. They had strong armies and they were very focused on their religion because they loved their kings a lot.\n\nIf you want to visit lots of cool places and see really old things from Egypt, it's like finding special treasures from a long time ago! likeThe Ramesseum In Luxor The people who lived there a long time ago had a different way of life than we do now, and it's really interesting to see and learn about how they lived."
