        "text": "In today’s context, the Ummah finds itself deeply engaged with a range of matters, sometimes leading to challenges in staying updated on all the news. This situation is readily exploited by malicious individuals to further their own interests and propagate their mischief and malevolence in the Muslim lands, often under the pretense of ‘spirituality’ and ‘devotion to the Awliya/Ahl al-Bayt’.\n\nThe Link Between Shia and Sufi Grave Worship In Egypt\n\nThe close affinity between Sufism and Shiism led Ibn Khaldun to say that the later Sufis mixed with the Ismaili Rafidah Shia (‘Fatimids’), who were the early proponents of practices like celebrating the Prophet’s () Mawlid (birth) and excessively venerating saints tombs and shrines. As a result, both groups mutually influenced and learned from each other.\n\nTomb & Mosque of Sayyidah Nafisa – Cairo\n\nIn August 2021, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi issued instructions to the relevant authorities for the restoration and renovation of the shrines allegedly belonging to Ahl al-Bayt across Egypt. This effort is particularly directed towards the tombs of Nafisa, Zaynab, and Husayn. Furthermore, improvements have been made to the roads, squares, and nearby facilities to facilitate easier and smoother tomb and shrine veneration.\n\nThe ‘Syeds/Sayeds/Sharifs’ and other dubious claimants of Hashimite lineage are all celebrating:\n\n“The head of the Al-Ashraf Syndicate (Al-Ashraf are those who belong to the lineage of Muhammad), Mahmoud al-Sharif, told Al-Monitor, “Developing the roads, squares and facilities surrounding the Ahl al-Bayt mosques will make them more attractive to visitors and easier to reach, thus allowing visitors from all over the world to access these shrines once again.”\n\nMeanwhile, Abdel Hadi al-Qasabi, the president of the Supreme Council of Sufi Orders, said in a July 26 interview on Mehwar TV, ‘The interest in Ahl al-Bayt shrines is a revival of the values of love, sincerity, tolerance and acceptance of others, which is what we need at this time to preserve the successes of the Egyptian state in all fields during the recent period.”\n\nAbdel Rahim Rihan, director general of research, archaeological studies and scientific publishing in South Sinai at the Tourism Ministry, told Al-Monitor, “The political leadership’s sponsorship of shrines and [Sisi’s] directives to restore and renovate them, as well as the roads leading to them, boost these shrines’ value and contribute to revitalizing religious tourism in Egypt.”\n\nHe said, “The state’s interest in developing these attractions and facilitating access to them will make Egypt a destination for religious tourism for Muslim and Christian pilgrims alike from all over the world.”\n\nWhy not invoke Jesus, Mary, Husayn, and Nafisah collectively? After all, Sufi Muftis have endorsed this as a valid aspect of Islamic tradition.\n\nRihan said, “Restoring shrines helps to complete the religious tourism system, which also includes the Holy Family Trail that blesses the land of Egypt from Rafah in Sinai to the Muharraq Monastery in Assiut governorate.”\n\nHe pointed out that the two routes can be linked into one path to include visits to the holy family’s sites in Cairo, such as the Tree of the Virgin Mary in al-Matariyyah, the Maadi Church, the churches of ancient Egypt and the shrines of Ahl al-Bayt.\n\nMore and more shrines…\n\nRihan said, “The most famous shrines in Egypt [of Muhammad’s descendants] are located on al-Ashraf Street or what is known as Ahl al-Bayt Road in central Cairo. This street includes the tombs of Zain al-Abidin, Sayyida Nafisa, Sakinah bint Husayn, Sayyida Zeinab, Ibn Sirin and Ruqayah bint Ali, in addition to other shrines in different locations, such as the tomb of Fatma al-Nabawiyya in the al-Darb al-Ahmar district.”\n\nIn June 2021, a new shrine was inaugurated above the tomb during the visit of the leader of the Dawoodi Bohras (descendants of the ‘Fatimids’ within the Ismaili Rafidi Shia branch), with the presence of Sufi Azhari scholars.\n\nthedawoodibohras.com:\n\nPresident Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi inaugurated on Wednesday El-Hussein Mosque after extensive renovations in the presence of Sultan of the Indian Bohra community Mufaddal Saifuddin.\n\nThe President performed mosque greeting prayer and then recited Al-Fatiha, the first surah of the Holy Quran in front of the shrine of Imam El-Hussein.\n\nThe renovations were implemented as per El-Sisi’s directives to develop the shrines of ‘Ahl El-Bayt’ (‘The family of the Islamic prophet Muhammad’) across Egypt.\n\nAsharq Al-Awsat:"
