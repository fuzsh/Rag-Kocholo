        "text": "Former Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi has been buried hours after he collapsed in court and died on Monday.\n\nHis lawyer told the AFP news agency the former leader had been buried in eastern Cairo early on Tuesday morning with his family present.\n\nMorsi, who was 67, had been in custody since his removal from office in 2013.\n\nHuman rights groups, who had criticised the conditions in which he was kept, have called for an impartial investigation into his death.\n\nHis family and activists had repeatedly raised concerns about his health and the amount of time he was kept in solitary confinement, away from visits by lawyers and family.\n\nHis son, Abdullah Mohamed Morsi, told Reuters on Monday that Egyptian authorities had denied a family request for a public funeral in his hometown.\n\nA top figure in the now-banned Islamist movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, Morsi became the country's first democratically elected leader in 2012.\n\nHe was ousted and detained in a military coup a year later following mass protests against his rule.\n\nAbdul Fattah al-Sisi, a former army chief, has been in power since 2014.\n\nAfter Morsi's removal, the authorities launched a crackdown on his supporters and other dissent, leading to tens of thousands of arrests.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a close ally of Morsi, are among those who have blamed the Egyptian leadership for Morsi's death.\n\nWhat happened in court?\n\nMorsi was appearing in Cairo on Monday on charges of espionage related to suspected contacts with the Palestinian militant Islamist group Hamas.\n\nOfficials say he had asked to address the jury, and spoke for about five minutes from a soundproof glass cage where he was being held with other defendants.\n\nMinutes later, he apparently fainted during a break in proceedings.\n\n\"He was transferred to a hospital where he was pronounced dead,\" a statement by Egypt's public prosecutor said.\n\nOfficials said a forensic report had been ordered into his death, and insisted no new, visible injuries were found on his body.\n\nState television had earlier described the cause of death as a heart attack.\n\nMorsi was already facing decades in jail after being sentenced in three other trials. He had previously been given a death sentence, which was later overturned.\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nSarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division, tweeted that his death was \"terrible but entirely predictable\".\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

During his turbulent year in office, Morsi was accused of mounting an Islamist coup and mishandling the economy."
