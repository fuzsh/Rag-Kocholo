Ibrahim Pasha took care of his upbringing, teaching him the principles of science and Arabic, Turkish and Persian languages, and then traveled to the French capital, Paris, to join the Fifth Egyptian Mission, and then returned to Egypt during Ibrahim Pasha’s rule of Egypt, and after his death He moved to Astana.\n\nThe Ottoman Sultan appointed him as a member of the Ottoman Empire’s ruling council, and he did not return to Egypt until after Abbas I was killed, and he was deputy to Said Pasha in ruling Egypt during his travels to Sudan, Syria, Hijaz and Astana.\n\nIn 1861, Said Pasha Sardar appointed him to the Egyptian army, and entrusted him with suppressing the strife of some tribes in Sudan that year, so he was able to put down this strife.\n\nAfter assuming the rule of Egypt on January 18, 1863, Khedive Ismail transformed the Consultation Council into the Consultative Council of Representatives, and allowed the people to choose their representatives, transformed the bureaus into spectacles, and formed the first spectators to share the responsibility of governance, and abolished the consular courts and replaced them with mixed courts.\n\nEgypt during the reign of Khedive Ismail\n\nDuring the reign of Khedive Ismail, the digging of the Suez Canal was completed, and he built luxurious palaces such as Abdeen Palace, Ras Al-Tin Palace and Al-Quba Palace, and established the Opera House and the Qasr Al-Nil Bridge.\n\nDuring his reign, he also established factories, including 19 sugar factories, and built 15 beacons to revive trade. He took care of education, so he increased the budget of the Education Department, and commissioned Ali Mubarak to draw up a basic law for education, and established the House of Science to graduate teachers and the House of Books.\n\nThe press during the reign of Khedive Ismail\n\nDuring the reign of Khedive Ismail, some newspapers appeared, such as Al-Ahram, Al-Watan, and Kindergarten magazine. He established the Geographical Society and the Egyptian Antiquities House. He also concluded a treaty with Britain in 1877 to eliminate the slave trade.\n\nKhedive Ismail removed from the rule of Egypt\n\nThe independence tendency of Khedive Ismail in ruling Egypt led both England and France to feel anxious about Egypt, and under their pressure, the Ottoman Sultan issued a firman to isolate him on July 26, 1879. After his isolation, he traveled to Naples in Italy and then moved to reside in Astana, until he died in March 1895 ."
