        "text": "Egyptians tend to bury their dead as soon as possible after death. This is partly so in order for them to avoid embalming the corpse. After all, Islamic beliefs dictate that the relatives should not disturb the body. Moreover, they instruct Muslims to wash the body well and wrap it in a kafan, a special funerary white fabric.\n\nFurthermore, the funerary prayers (called janazah) always take place in a Mosque, with an Imam being in charge. After the Imam finishes the janazah, the men take the body to the mausoleum of the family. Similarly to Islamic traditions around the world, the body has to always face Mecca. It is also not common for Egyptians to use tombstones or other grave markers.\n\nIn addition to all of that, the official mourning period is 40 days. During this period loved ones of the deceased have special prayers for the dead’s soul. Finally, the average cost of a modern Islamic funeral in Egypt varies from 300 to 2.500 USD.\n\nEgyptian beliefs preach that the soul of the dead visits the grave multiple times. The soul returns firstly on the third day and then consecutively seven, fifteen and forty days after death. Additionally, Egyptians believe that the soul will continue returning every Friday. Connecting that with Islamic beliefs, the spirit of the prophet also visits the grave in order to smell the aloe plant that is often found next to graves.\n\nMoreover, when the soul is not visiting it is stuck either in the underworld or in heaven. Interestingly this is a belief shared both by Egyptian Muslims and Copts – a Christian denomination.\n\nThe most astonishing similarity, though, between ancient and modern Egyptian funeral practices is in regards to mourning. Specifically, after the one’s death, their female loved ones take it upon them to become professional mourners. Moreover, their grief can be very intense depending on how close they were with the deceased. For example, these women may roll on the floor and tear up their clothes or even scratch their faces and punch their breasts.\n\nAlmost identical lamentations took place during the funeral of Ramose, a vizier during the 18th Pharaonic Dynasty (around 1400BC). Contracted women were screaming loudly, weeping and tearing their clothes off.\n\nOne of the most peculiar Egyptian death practices from older times that made it all the way to modernity, are the death letters. In other words, these were letters addressed to the dead that the living would write for closure. Egyptians may publish these letters on newspapers and use them as a way to get closure. Up until the 1970s, around 14% of educated Egyptian were still writing these letters.\n\nHowever, the letters to the dead were not the only way to communicate with the dead. Alternatively, the dead may also appear in dreams that occur as a result of istikhara – referring to asking Allah for guidance. Additional means of communication is to touch the top of a loved one’s grave and say the Salam greetings.\n\nHowever, Egyptians don’t just try to ‘communicate’ with their dead loved ones through letters. Visiting graves of relatives is also a common practice. It is even really common for most Egyptians to have specific dates that they devote to visiting cemeteries.\n\nSpecifically, families gather at the cemetery and start praying or reciting the Quran. They also often bring grave offerings such as fruits, roses and palm tree leaves.\n\nFriday visitations are the norm but there are eight additional designated days annually when Egyptians go to the cemetery. These visitations – also called ziyaras – remain common amongst lower classes but have been abandoned by many Egyptians.\n\nThe City of the Dead is located in Cairo and it comprises multiple cemeteries. These cemeteries often belong in different districts of Cairo – called qisms. For instance, the Northern Cemetery is mostly part of the Manshiyat Naser qism, whereas the Southern Cemetery belongs to the Al-Khalifa qism. Additionally, many of these cemeteries pour into urban areas and vice versa, making it, thus, challenging to really differentiate between houses and tombs.\n\nThese blurred boundaries make it difficult for the Egyptian government to accurately estimate how many people reside within the City of the Dead. For example, the 1986 census supports that there are over 180.000 Egyptians living in the Necropolis.\n\nOther sources suggest though, that the current population of the City of the Dead could vary from half to two million people. Although researchers see the latter as unrealistic, they support that the population of the two aforementioned districts is no less than 375.000 (2019)!\n\nThe City of the Dead reached infamy when the media focused solely on the tomb-dwellers. After all, these are people living among the tombstones or squatting in the mausoleums. As a result, many have proposed that the City of the Dead is a slum. Unlike other stories about tomb-dwellers however, Cairo’s Necropolis is a bit more complex.\n\nSpecifically, most people residing in the City of the Dead actually live in houses that were at some point illegally built within the limits of these cemeteries.\n\nAn additional reason for the high concentration of living amongst the dead were various job opportunities. For example, many of these houses were constructed in the 1980s, when death-related professionals needed to reside close to the cemetery. Such professionals included gravediggers, tomb guardians and even morticians.\n\nFinally, the Egyptian government has not adopted a certain approach towards these tomb-dwellers. Although there has been talk of using force to remove them, that has never actually taken place.\n\nSpeaking of death-related professionals, it is worth perhaps mentioning the story of the toraby, or tomb keepers.\n\nSome of these tomb keepers support that they would not move out even if the government offered them housing elsewhere in Cairo. Many of the toraby live next to certain tombs with the blessing of the family of the deceased. In some cases they have even struck a deal with these families to take care of the tombstones. After all, being a toraby is not a job paid by the government; instead these Egyptians depend on the donations of relatives of the deceased.\n\nRead more\n\nWe hope you learned something new regarding this country’s death practices!\n\nIf you want know more about Ancient Egyptian beliefs and rituals, have a look here!
