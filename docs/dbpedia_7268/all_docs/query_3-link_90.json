        "text": "The Tomb of Saad Zaghloul\n\nToday (March 29) is the anniversary of Saad Zaghloul’s return to Egypt from exile in 1923.\n\nThe tomb of Saad Zaghloul is a gem of a building in central Cairo that is often overlooked by locals and excluded from itineraries by tourists and visitors. Aside from the its attractive design, the building has a fascinating story.\n\nOne short metro stop south of Tahrir Square is the Saad Zaghloul stop, named after the nationalist figure and former prime minister. Zaghloul’s tomb located between Mansour and Falaky streets in Monira, is a neo-Pharoanic edifice centered in a small garden that is fenced (It appears that the fence has always been part of the design, the fence features an interesting motif of deco triangles and corn husks). Mostly residential buildings overlook the tomb/garden with the exception of some government offices to the east and the headquarters for the ministry of military production to the south. Beyond the immediate surroundings, this area of Cairo is full of government offices where thousands of civil workers show up in the morning and depart by afternoon. During the day the sidewalks around the tomb are covered with street sellers selling everything from hair pins, fruits, underwear, fish and remote controls. While it is bustling by day, once the dust settles by early evening after the bureaucrats have left and the sellers who serve them have departed the streets and sidewalks around Saad’s tomb are full of trash and empty plastic bags. The tomb is invisible it seems to these daily users of the area, visitors from other parts of the city who must show up to push papers or gossip to collect a dismal check at the end of the month. The garden is unused.\n\nThe building was designed by Mustafa Fahmy and was constructed over a period of several years due to political disagreement over the building’s style, but also budget. Mustafa Fahmy is the architect behind King Farouk’s rest house at the base of the Great Pyramid (unused) and the Petit and Grande Palais of the 1936 Cairo Expo (currently part of the Cairo Opera complex, largely unused). Fahmy is in many ways the father of Egyptian modernism in the 20th century and could be seen as one of Cairo’s architects for visitors to follow his trail and trace his buildings, he was head of Royal Buildings and professor of architecture in Foad/Cairo University.\n\nSaad Zaghloul died in 1927, however his body was interred in its current tomb in 1936. After his death, the Wafdist government proposed to turn Zaghloul’s house into a museum. The house is across the street to the west and is known today as “House of the Nation.” The government purchased the land across from the house to build the tomb. Ideas spread about creating a large tomb for Zaghloul or creating a pantheon of Egyptian national heroes. The style of the new building was debated: should this be in the neo-Pharaonic style of the 1920s, or an Arabo-Islamic revival which was coming back into fashion by the beginning of the 30s, or should it be a Napoleonic style?\n\nAfter a drama that lasted for 8-years involving Wafdist officials and opponents, Safeyya Zaghloul (Saad’s wife), several interruptions of the project, mummies, a plethora of magazine and newspaper articles and finally a ceremonial reburial of Zaghloul’s remains from his burial in Imam Shaf`ii Cemetery to his newly erected monumental tomb, it was all done by June of 1936.\n\nThe building is perhaps the best preserved example of neo-Pharaonic style. This is not merely a decorated shed with ancient Egyptian references only applied to the surface. Fahmy combined contemporary design elements (art deco) along with a modern reinvention of ancient Egyptian form and motifs to create a modern building. In plan, this is a symmetrical building with a central axis where two doors (west and east) face one another and leading in and out of the central space where a solid unmarked sarcophagus is located. Along the north-south axis there are two smaller side spaces. The interior space is reached by steps leading to a symbolic pylon gate set between two red granite columns rising around 15-meters. A shallow portico leads to the entry doors decorated with re-imagined ancient Egyptian iconography such as the snake, the sun disk and the lotus flower.\n\nThe tall interior hall is flooded with light from twelve large clerestory windows that separate the lower part of the central hall from the ceiling above. The two side galleries also have three tall slender windows allowing more light into the space. Twelve red granite columns similar to the four on the outside (a pair at each door) line the interior space.\n\nIt isn’t clear which authority is responsible for the upkeep of the building, however there is a government appointed ticket person collecting a one-pound fee for entry. Although on every occasion of visiting this wonderful building and relatively peaceful garden the ticket man seems confused as to why anyone cares to visit, he also makes up him own rule on photography, sometimes allowing it and other times claiming it isn’t allowed. Go and take as many pictures as you like. Despite minimal to no maintenance this building has retained its beauty.\n\nSaad’s tomb is also an important destination for those interested in the development of Egyptian modernism. In the past decade two important public buildings have been claimed to showcase a revival of ancient Egyptian architecture in contemporary form. The first is the Supreme Constitutional Court and the second is the recent renovation of Cairo’s main train station. What those two recent projects lack is exactly what Mustafa Fahmy accomplished in Saad’s tomb: a careful investigation and understanding of ancient Egyptian design and aesthetics paired with competence in contemporary design and technique.\n\nThe Tomb of Saad Zaghloul is open for visitors during work hours (9-4) on work days. Entry fee one pound and photography is certainly allowed (no matter what the guard says)."
