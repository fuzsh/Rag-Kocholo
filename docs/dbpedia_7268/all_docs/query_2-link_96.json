        "text": "The life, death, and afterlife of an Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh\n\nThe almost intact burial of Tutankhamun was discovered in 1922 in the Valley of the Kings of Egypt. His body was laid to rest there more than 3000 years ago during the New Kingdom period of ancient Egypt. During this time, Egypt’s rulers were buried in deep tombs cut into the rock of a desert valley near to the city of Thebes – the religious centre of Egypt at the time.\n\nThe tomb of Tutankhamun remains the most intact royal burial discovered in Egypt from this period when it was uncovered by a team directed by Howard Carter (1874-1939) under the financial backing of Lord Carnarvon (1866-1923). Here we will learn more about the life of Tutankhamun, his death and burial, and his afterlife since 1922.\n\nThe Boy King\n\nTutankhamun was born and raised at the city of Akhetaten in Middle Egypt, 400km north of Thebes. It was here that his father, the king Akhenaten, founded a new royal city dedicated to the god Aten. The Aten, depicted as the disk of the sun, was considered a creator god who gave life to everything in the world. Akhenaten promoted the Aten above all the Egyptian pantheon, forsaking the other deities and allowing their temples to fall into ruin. When Tutankhamun was born, he was originally called Tutankhaten or ‘Living Image of the Aten’ in honour of his father’s chosen god. When Tutankhamun ascended to the throne, at the age of just 8 or 9 years old, he changed his name to Tutankhamun, or ‘Living Image of Amun’, and reverted to the old pantheon of deities, restoring their temples, and relocating the royal court back to Thebes. In his restoration text he claimed to have:\n\nLeft: Tutankhamun’s original name, Tutankhaten, can still be seen on some of his burial goods such as on the arm of this throne now in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo.\n\nAn early death\n\nThe subject of how Tutankhamun died, at a young age of just 18 or 19 years old, has been discussed by specialists since 1922. While some believe that Tutankhamun suffered from genetic diseases, others have speculated that he died more brutally, in a chariot accident or perhaps even the victim of assassination. What we do know is that Tutankhamun died at a young age and possibly unexpectedly, as his tomb was not yet complete.\n\nWhen the young king died, his body was mummified, embalmed, and encased within 8 shrines and coffins in the burial chamber. The king was accompanied on his journey to the afterlife with thousands of treasures. While some are made of gold, precious alabaster, and gems, others offered more practical support to help him reach the afterlife and join his ancestors. Clothing and pillows to help him rest, weapons to repel evil spirits that would hinder his path, and food to sustain him on the journey.\n\nWhen the tomb of Tutankhamun was discovered in 1922, it took Howard Carter and his team of experts more than 10 years to record, conserve, and remove the artefacts found within it. Today, these artefacts remain in Egypt and will soon be on display at the Grand Egyptian Museum.\n\n‘Wonderful things’ – some of the precious artefacts uncovered in the tomb of Tutankhamun.\n\nTutankhamun’s afterlife\n\nWith all the precious burial goods that accompanied him. It is likely that Tutankhamun did achieve his place in the Egyptian afterlife. In the modern world, however, Tutankhamun has achieved a very different afterlife. Having once been a forgotten Pharaoh, he is now the most famous – his name is known by every child at school and his golden mask is one of the most well-known artefacts of the ancient world. His name, and tomb, have inspired countless movies and novels, and motivated many to enter the field of archaeology in the hope of new discoveries.\n\nTutankhamun is more than the sum of his tomb or his mysterious death, however. He was a living king, and young boy, whose life was tragically cut short. In his short reign he achieved much, restoring Egypt’s administrative and religious systems, and re-establishing it as a world leader more than 3000 years ago.\n\nHave a go at designing your own golden mask!\n\nDownload a template here\n\nWonderful things: What would you take to the afterlife?\n\nDownload the activity here\n\nFact file"
