        "text": "Even though it was on display at the May 1910 Paris exhibition of Fine arts, for colonial-related reasons and fluid party politics the French-made statue of Nationalist Mustafa Kamel Pasha (1874 - February 10, 1908) was only unveiled by King Farouk on 14 May 1940 at Suares Square aptly renamed Midan Mustafa Kamel. The unveiling was brought about thanks to the efforts of a group of professors from al-Azhar and Cairo Universities (including the author's father Dr. Wahid Raafat) who rallied the government to their cause on 7 February 1938 when they initiated a symbolic vigil by the still statue warehoused statue at the Mustafa Kamel School in Khoronfesh.\n\nThe 2.8 meters bronze statue is the work of Leopold Savine in co-operation with atelier Ren√© Fulda, Fondeur d'Art, Paris. The statue itself cost LE 1,140 and was slapped with a 10% custom duty tax when it arrived in Port Saiid aboard an Austrian ship on 20 December 1913. Nevertheless, the monies (LE 3250) collected back in 1911 surpassed by far the cost the balance going to the school named after Mustafa Kamel.\n\nEgypt's Awakening by Mokhtar"
