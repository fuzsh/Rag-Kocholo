        "text": "Page 241 →Chapter XI Return to Alexandria Mohammed Ali, Ibrahim Pasha, and Their Families\n\nObjects, faces, circumstances, news, each sadder than the last, each more striking than the last, changed before us at a great pace, presenting themselves through the black prism of illnesses and sufferings. Finally, Cairo appeared before our eyes—the very city that we were so impatient to see. But alas, Cairo herself, as if in accordance with the sad reality round us, seemed deserted and gloomy, having borne the heavy burden of cholera.\n\nHow beautiful is the legend of the construction of old Cairo. While the city was besieged, a dove made a nest on Amr’s tent; the conqueror of Egypt, who had destroyed cities and decimated thousands of men, dared not destroy the nest of the dove as he set off to conquer Alexandria, and so he left his tent there, and a city grew round it, named Misr al-Fustat.369 Europeans deduced the name Cairo from the Arabic adjective el-kaherah, meaning victorious, with which the Arabs named this as well as many other cities.\n\nPage 242 →The court and consul-generals were all in Alexandria, but Clot Bey remained in Cairo: he had nothing to do in the service of the old Viceroy . . . It was the end! . . . Clot Bey said that the choice had been between the life and the mind of the sick man, and that strong measures had been inevitable: Mohammed Ali was indeed cured, but he had lost his mind! . . . God only knew if it would have been better for him to die . . . Did he himself think the same in his rare moments of self-knowledge, when he—he, Mohammed Ali!—could see all his nothingness and humiliation . . . Or did the world require yet another living evidence of the vanity of earthly greatness!? . . .\n\nIbrahim Pasha had not yet been invested by the Porte, but he ruled Egypt, presiding over a council that consisted of people who had been previously selected by Mohammed Ali, and were distinguished by their intelligence and activity. Mohammed Ali used to know how to choose his ministers. Nevertheless, Ibrahim Pasha ruled independently.\n\nOn the way from Cairo, we had cholera on board, its first victim being our engine operator, an Englishman. Anyhow, we reached Alexandria.\n\nUpon our arrival at Alexandria, I hastened to introduce myself to Ibrahim Pasha, whom I had not yet met. The house occupied by the new governor of Egypt was no different from the houses of private persons of average means, and much worse than those the Pasha rented out. It was empty and poor inside. We were obliged to search for the host ourselves. Fortunately, the voices we could hear from afar served as our guide in the matter, and having walked along several passages and climbed several staircases, we found ourselves in a large oblong room, the only furniture in it consisting of a few divans. On one of these divans sat a man of about 60 years of age, wearing a short frock-coat and close-fitting white trousers; he sat there European-style, his legs hanging down rather than crossed; the only difference between him and other Europeans who sat next to him being a long, snow-white beard. I was very surprised when the Consul introduced me to this person, his words clearly indicating that the man was Ibrahim Pasha. He rose, bowed European-style, and invited us to sit down. I am describing all these details here since they made a drastic contrast to the commonly Page 244 →accepted manner, being at that time the subject of everyone’s attention in Alexandria and Cairo, and much talked about there. Elsewhere in Egypt people were still convinced that Mohammed Ali ruled the country. A poor fellah cannot reconcile himself with the idea of ever having another ruler in Egypt except Mohammed Ali; it would be fair to say that, were the old Pasha to die upon bequeathing his beard to Egypt, they would obey it unreservedly, too.\n\nThis time traditional Turkish greetings, enquiries about health, &c. were soon over, for Ibrahim Pasha seemed impatient to hear about the success of our expedition; having embarked upon the subject, he was quite taken by it and spent two hours or so questioning me about it, having completely forgotten that there were other visitors in the room who might not be interested in our conversation. We could not help marveling at the speed with which he performed mental calculations, multiplications and divisions of most complicated numbers, announcing one result after another, so that we could barely follow him, let alone check his calculations. One could see extremely good skills in practical arithmetic. I poured out before him the gold I had brought from the established factory; Ibrahim Pasha sank his hands in it with visible pleasure, then poured the gold from his hands onto paper; the gold was good indeed—large-grained and bright-yellow in color, which proved its high quality.\n\nDespite all the fascination that our interview about the establishment of gold-washing factories held for him, Ibrahim Pasha still touched upon my discoveries in the fields of natural history and geography and was extremely pleased to hear that I had reached so deep into the wild lands beyond his rule, under the protection of his negro soldiers, thus spreading the glory and fame of the sovereigns of Egypt. If only he knew what the arrangement of the expedition had cost me. Talking to him, however, I could not help praising the indefatigability of his soldiers, of whom I had previously written to Mohammed Ali; Ibrahim told me that he had decided to form a negro battalion in Cairo, assigning to it negro officers and even a negro commander. I doubt very much that they could accustom themselves to the climate and the land of Lower Egypt: hitherto, at least, all such attempts have Page 245 →been unsuccessful; tens of thousands of negroes, extracted from their native mountains of Sennaar and Kordofan, paying for these novelties with their lives. Ibrahim Pasha was especially interested in my proposal to establish a frontier line of military settlements and encampments in the Toumat Mountains, asking me to submit this project, which he promised to realize.370\n\nI do not think it would be appropriate to relate here the entire interview, which was rather long for a first meeting; eventually I bid the Pasha farewell, hoping to see him several more times, but it never came to be. Cholera spread in Alexandria as quickly as it had done in Cairo, and Ibrahim Pasha hastened to leave for Rhodes, whereto I delivered the information which he required from me.\n\nIbrahim Pasha, as we have already happened to note, was not fond of Oriental opulence, setting his suite a striking example of moderation himself. He tried to free himself from the indispensable customs of the East, which only served to satisfy worldly vanity, as much as he did from the influence of politics or, it would be fairer to say, of the diplomatic agents of the West, who had recently extended their influence across the threshold of the harem, formerly unreachable for any foreigner.\n\nRecently people could see, to their extreme surprise, Ibrahim Pasha walking round Frank Square; like a mere mortal, he entered a shop and bought some trifles—candle-holders I think. The Governor on foot, the Governor in a shop, buying a candle-holder! It was a miracle unexpected by people, who had been accustomed, from time immemorial, to see Mohammed Ali in a coach drawn by a tandem horse team and surrounded by a crowd of servants, on foot and on horseback. By the time Ibrahim Pasha emerged from the shop, a great many people had gathered outside it. He stayed awhile, spoke to those he knew, and left.\n\nUpon taking the reins of the government, the first thing Ibrahim Pasha did was to intensify the works carried out to build fortifications in Alexandria, followed by the recruitment of battalions, which Page 246 →had not been done for several years. He justly enjoys the fame of a brave and experienced general. Military fame of any kind holds the most attraction for Ibrahim Pasha, which can be seen from his entire past life; I shall forego any description of the latter here, for it is well-known.\n\nIbrahim Pasha was born in Kavala in 1789, and rumors about the legitimacy of his birth are not worthy of a discussion. He does not have the same brilliant mind as his father did and is far from being possessed of equally lofty feelings; yet he is a good man of a similarly strong and uncompromising will; even if he fails to provide future development for Egypt, he will certainly hold it.371 Once cruel, his heart mellowed with age and experience; once given to passions, he was changed for the better by his illnesses, which he still suffers from.\n\nWhat shall become of Egypt when he is gone? It is difficult to predict. He has three sons, two of whom, both men of great promise, were educated in Paris, yet it is not his children who shall inherit from him, but rather the eldest in the clan—that is, his nephew Abbas Pasha, the son of Toussoun Pasha,372 35 years of age.\n\nAbbas Pasha was brought up—or, it would be better to say, matured—in traditional old ways, and he will certainly find himself protectors . . .\n\nOut of Mohammed Ali’s many children, the other surviving sons are Seid Pasha, educated in the French manner; Halim Bey, who also studied in France; and finally, Mohammed Ali,373 his favorite, whom he has always kept close to himself, bestowing his affections upon the young man even now, in his infirmity—that he recognizes his son I need hardly say, for he recognizes all his nearest, whatever the rumors about his insanity. Mohammed Ali also has two daughters: one, the widow of Page 248 →a well-known Defterdar, is said to greatly resemble Mohammed Ali in character; the other is married to Kamil Pasha.374\n\nAlexandria was quite empty of people, some having fled to the islands, others having locked themselves in their homes, voluntarily putting themselves in quarantine so as to avoid cholera; it was empty except for funeral processions, which flowed to cemeteries in a continuous stream, and for Mohammed Ali, who, not quite aware of what was happening around him, appeared on the deserted streets of Alexandria every day, at the usual hour, in his splendid coach and with the same grandeur.\n\nLet us behold once again, prior to parting, this extraordinary personality, who cannot help but attract attention.\n\nWhen Mohammed Ali took over Egypt, its population was 2,500,000, and when he retired, it was 5,000,000, as shown by a recently completed census. He is particularly criticized for his oppression of the people by means of extreme taxes; it is true that he brought the land entrusted to him by fate to a state in which Egypt makes more than 100,000,000 rubles in paper money, of which land taxes constitute 54,000,000 and personal taxes, 10,000,000; the rest comes from the sales of cotton, gomi,375 senneh, indigo, and various products of agriculture—this last practice having been created by Mohammed Ali—as well as from customs and other duties. As you can see from the above, the taxes levied on the people themselves are not great; the important thing is the injustices permitted by local authorities, yet Mohammed Ali certainly did not encourage their development but rather attempted to stop them as much as possible. Further, was it not for the benefit of the people and the country that Mohammed Ali used all the income obtained from Egypt? Having been its omnipotent and unaccountable governor during his 40-year-long reign, he retired without keeping a penny for himself, so that, should his successors refuse to keep him at the state’s expense, Mohammed Ali, miserable in his old age, would end his days in near poverty.\n\nPage 249 →Let us now bid our final farewell to this extraordinary man, who has left indelible memories in my mind.\n\nThere are no regular boats running between Alexandria and Jerusalem, and therefore I was very grateful to Ibrahim Pasha for providing me with a steam-boat. I left Alexandria, the hand of fate already weighing upon her, with sadness, and a few days later found myself in another city, which presented a no less doleful spectacle—in Jerusalem."
