First, the historiography of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā is examined in order to situate the mausoleum dynastically and geographically. Then, this study carefully reconstructs the complicated building chronology of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā by cross‑referencing contemporary sources with eyewitness accounts of nineteenth‑century travelers and drawings by Pascal Coste as well as Antonio Schranz Jr. to reassess when the mausoleum was built. In the course of critically rewriting the historical narrative of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā, this study maps the cemetery’s blend of appropriated decorative motifs to their original models of inspiration with the purpose of analyzing the eclectic tendencies of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā’s creative process and the definition of what constituted the Ottoman stylistic tradition in the nineteenth century. Finally, a comparative trajectory between the artistic milieus in the imperial state of Istanbul and the khedival province of Cairo is developed to question the vectors of influence driving the westernization of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā’s stylistic evolution. Ḥūš al‑Bāšā arguably represents a manifestation of power, a moment of decisive visual transformation, and a memory of a modernizing social order.",

        "text": "This paper is drawn from my Master’s thesis, which was submitted to the American University in Cairo (AUC) in January 2021. I am incredibly grateful to Professor Bernard O’Kane for reviewing multiple drafts of this paper and continuously guiding me through my academic research. I would like to also express my sincerest appreciation to Mrs. Eman Morgan, Assistant Director of Special Projects at the Rare Books and Special Collections Library—AUC, for helping me find crucial research materials especially during the difficult times of the COVID‑19 lockdown. Many thanks to the anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback on an earlier version of this study.\n\n1Ḥūš al-Bāšā, also known as the Tomb of the Family of Muḥammad ʿAlī (r. 1805–1848), is an architectural ensemble where cultural identities meet, artistic forms collide, and the dead keep each other company. The mausoleum is located in the Qarāfa, the Southern Cemetery in Cairo, near the shrine of al‑Imām al‑Šāfʿī. Fashioned slowly but surely throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century to accommodate deaths in the sovereign family, the royal cemetery’s gradual visual transformation reveals historically relevant information about the stylistic tendencies of local and imperial artistic milieus during this period. The main objective of this study is to, first and foremost, reconstruct Ḥūš al-Bāšā’s complicated building chronology and reassess when it was built. Then, this study surveys the various modes of ornamentation employed at the royal cemetery to bridge between its blend of decorative motifs and their diverse visual references, and identify if the creative process that shaped Ḥūš al‑Bāšā’s artistic expression was one of innovation, inspiration, or mere imitation. Finally, in an effort to better understand Ḥūš al‑Bāšā’s architectural character, the cemetery is studied in reference to the politics of the Imperial state, the ambitions of the provincial patron, and the identity of the so‑called Ottoman architect. Ḥūš al‑Bāšā is arguably one of the most intriguing architectural moments in Ottoman Cairo not only because of the significance of where it is located and who is buried there, but also, most importantly, how the mausoleum’s patterns of stylistic evolution reflect the complexity of socio-political factors that affected Cairo’s building activities at the time.\n\nHistorical context\n\n13 al-Maqrīzī, al-Mawāʿiẓ, pp. 850–851; the original text reads: “iʿlam an al-nās fī al-qadīm inamā (...)\n\nKnow that in the old days people would only bury their dead between the Mosque of al-Fatḥ and the foot of al-Muqaṭṭam and they also took their dead to the great burial grounds… which is now known as the Qarāfa al‑Kubrā (Great Cemetery). When Sulṭān al‑Kāmil Muḥammad ibn al‑ʿAdil Abū Bakr ibn Ayyūb buried his son in the year 608 (1211) next to the Tomb of Imām Muḥammad bin Idrīs al‑Šāfʿī and he built a great dome over the tomb and connected water to it from the pond of al‑Ḥabash by means of an aqueduct, people moved their buildings from the Qarāfa al‑Kubrā to the area around al‑Imām al‑Šāfʿī and established the burial grounds known as the Qarāfa al‑Suġrā (Lesser Cemetery), its buildings increased while the other’s (Great Cemetery) faded.\n\n8Muḥammad ʿAlī, be it consciously or organically, followed in the footsteps of his precursors. The Ottoman governor chose to bury his family and possibly planned at first to also have himself buried within close proximity to the Imām, just like al‑Malik al‑Kāmil did before him, for baraka and prestige. The new presence of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā in the area along with Muḥammad ʿAlī’s efforts to provide the site with water supplies and accessibility brought with it another wave of urbanization, whereby the rich and the ruling family alike, keeping up with the trend of family madfans and grand shrines, commissioned new structures and radically changed the landscape of the cemetery.\n\n19 Stephens, Incidents of Travel in Egypt, vol. 1, p. 42.\n\nIn this grand city of the dead stand the tombs of the Mamelukes, originally slaves from the foot of the Caucasus, then the lords and tyrants of Egypt, and now an exterminated race: the tombs are large, handsome buildings, with domes and minarets, the interior of the domes beautifully wrought, and windows of stained glass, all going to ruins. Here too, is the tomb of the pacha. Fallen, changed, completely revolutionized as Egypt is.\n\n10Whenever the tombs of the royal family are mentioned in contemporary sources, they are almost always discussed in topographical association with the mausoleum of al‑Imām al‑Šāfʿī, underlining the sacred shrine’s significance within the landscape. For example, in a biography of Muḥammad ʿAlī that examines the many phases of his long life, a French historian describes the funeral of his elder son Ṭūsūn Pāshā (d. 1816) as follows:\n\n20 Marcel, Égypte, p. 43 ; the original texts states: “Les obsèques du prince furent célébrées avec be (...)\n\nThe prince’s funeral was celebrated with great pomp, numerous processions of military dignitaries and civilians accompanied the funerary convoy, and Muḥammad ʿAlī followed on foot the remains of his son until al‑Imām al‑Šāfʿī, at the place intended for the burial of his family members. Abundant alms were distributed to the poor and the mosques. The tomb of Ṭūsūn is a domed construction, Arab in form.\n\n11This statement not only confirms the role of al‑Imām al‑Šāfʿī’s tomb as a pivotal landmark and that a ritualistic funerary procession to the Southern Cemetery was already established at the time, but it also reveals that the royal cemetery was more than a mere burial ground when Ṭūsūn Pāshā died.\n\nArchitectural overview\n\n12Before delving into careful considerations of how Ḥūš al‑Bāšā’s significant location, patron, and chronology fit within the broader frameworks of architectural precedents and political intentions, a description of the royal cemetery independent of any contextual connotations is in order. Along al‑Imām al‑Layth Street currently stands the stone edifice of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā. A projecting portal flanked by octagonal buttresses greets the visitor while the words Madāfin al‑ʿāʾila al‑mālika (Cemetery of the Royal Family) engraved across the doorway’s lintel formally introduce the building (fig. 1). Upon entering the structure through its wooden doors, a visitor is welcomed into a domed vestibule (fig. 2.3) with symmetrical extensions used originally as units for the kitchen and other dependencies (fig. 2.4). Regardless of the direction in which a visitor chooses to take from the vestibule, the architecture guides them back to the same point—the arcade (fig. 2.5). Surmounted by a series of small domes, the arcade opens onto the courtyard on either side and concludes at an intermediate vestibule with a stone-carved portal (fig. 2.7). A rectangular hall with a wooden roof follows the stone portal, leading firstly to a separate tomb chamber (fig. 2.9) made exclusively for Šafaq Nūr (d. 1883), the mother of Khedive Tawfīq (r. 1879–1892) and, secondly, to a series of irregular dome chambers where the sons of Muḥammad ʿAlī are buried along with their wives, children, government officials, and other devoted servants.\n\n13The architectural character of this funerary complex in its present state shifts in terms of circulation and decoration as a visitor moves within the building from one space to the next. Ḥūš al‑Bāšā can be conceptually partitioned into different spaces that are bound together by the same visual forms and spatial functions. The areas from the main entrance to the stone‑carved portal (fig. 2.2–7) serve as transitional spaces that not only bridge between the entrance and the dome chambers to lead the visitor, but also unify the interior and exterior spaces to incorporate the courtyard. The arcade leading up to the stone‑carved portal curates a striking visual juxtaposition as it captures within the frames of its columns a view of al-Imām al‑Šāfʿī’s dome on one side and a view of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā’s domes on the other.\n\n14The stone-carved portal preceding the rectangular hall marks a shift in Ḥūš al‑Bāšā’s spatial sequence and decorative scheme (fig. 3). Elements of ornamentation throughout the transitional spaces leading up to this intermediate vestibule have been subtle, stone‑carved, and appear mainly as medallions of radiating star designs in the domes and on the ceilings of corridors; whereas the stone-carved portal, though of the same material, is more decorative, featuring bands of small leaves in the archivolts, scroll work in the spandrels and tympanum, engaged columns on the jambs, and a frame of interlacing geometric patterns with rosettes.\n\n15Through the wooden doors of the stone-carved portal, a visitor enters a vast and colorful hall. Rectangular in shape and static in nature, the hall emerges as a staying space that invites the visitor to momentarily linger and take in the array of decorative motifs and diverse materials employed at different visual levels. Here, as opposed to the monotonous stone surfaces of the preceding transitional spaces, marble paneling is used for the dado, ashlar masonry for the upper walls, and wood panels for the flat roof. The roof, divided into a symmetrical grid with a large central medallion, is elaborately ornamented with panels of geometric designs carved in low relief and framed by patterns of interlacing foliage painted in red, green, gold, and dark blue. The palmettes and arabesques on the frames as well as the cornice are all intriguingly outlined with a slightly angled and faded darker color to create the optical illusion of a shadow, providing the painted forms with a sense of depth.\n\n16Across this hall from the stone-carved portal is the doorway into the adjacent dome chamber belonging to Šafaq Nūr (fig. 4). Though the rectangular hall does not have an obvious specific function, it essentially operates as an anteroom for Šafaq Nūr’s dome chamber, simultaneously linking the chamber to and separating it from the adjacent spaces. The marble dado continues from the hall into the chamber; however, the design and the color range of the marble panelling within the chamber is much more elaborate. From the marble dado up to the muqarnas pendentives, vertical bands are painted in the same color scheme of the flat wooden roof in the rectangular hall with a white border between the bands and a stylized lotus motif adorning the top and bottom of each color segment. The vertical lines of the marble panelling on the lower walls, the color segments on the upper walls, and the triple-tiered tomb seem to collectively emphasize the height of Šafaq Nūr’s chamber and draw the viewer’s gaze upwards. The dome, which feels lightweight due to the series of windows lining the drum, is beautifully painted in gold with an interlacing knotted grid that outlines arabesque foliage. The placement of Šafaq Nūr’s cenotaph in the center of the dome chamber dictates the visitor’s movement within this space, directing them to circumambulate the cenotaph, view every side of it, then exit the room, and return to the rectangular hall in order to access the rest of the chambers.\n\n19Across the barrel vault from Ṭūsūn’s dome chamber lies Ismāʿīl Pāshā (d. 1238/1822–1823), Muḥammad ʿAlī’s third son (fig. 2.13). In the adjacent dome chamber (fig. 2.14) is the wife of Muḥammad ʿAlī, Amīna Hānim (d. 1239/1823–1824), and Ismāʿīl Pāshā’s daughters, Ruqayya Hānim (d. 1239/1823) who shares a cenotaph with her sister Fātima Hānim (d. 1250/1834–1835). The juxtaposition of the chambers on either side of the barrel vault highlights the striking stylistic contrast between them. The chambers of Ṭūsūn and Ismāʿīl (fig. 2.10, 2.13) are structurally similar when it comes to the semi‑dome squinches underlined by cells of muqarnas in the zone of transition and the eight arched windows of stained glass fixed in stucco along the drum area; beyond those two elements, however, everything about these chambers is drastically different. While Ismāʿīl’s chamber has bare stone walls and a plain white dome, Ṭūsūn’s chamber is richly ornamented in massive acanthus scrolls with rose finials on the soffits of the arches, white marble dado fixed with slightly projecting niches of densely carved gold arabesques for the lower walls, imitation marble painted on plaster for the upper walls, acanthus medallions in gold and green between the semi‑dome squinches, thick acanthus foliate bands lining the drum and framing all eight of its windows, and a radial medallion of ribbon‑like rays expanding from the center of the green dome to the edges of the drum. This elaborate decorative scheme, which visibly breaks off once a visitor steps into the dome chambers of Ismāʿīl Pāshā and Amīna Hānim, is carried over by the barrel-vaulted space and continued throughout the remaining three large dome chambers.\n\n20Twenty-nine more people are buried in the remaining chambers (fig. 2.15–17). Some of the most prominent family members buried in the first of the three chambers (fig. 2.15) are Fātima Hānim the daughter of Muḥammad ʿAlī (d. 1248/1833), Zahraʾ ʿAʾiša Hānim the sister of Muḥammad ʿAlī (d. 1246/1831), and three of Muḥammad ʿAlī’s great grandchildren from ʿAbbās Ḥelmy I. In the adjacent dome chamber (fig. 2.16), Ibrāhīm Pāshā (d. 1264/1848), Muḥammad ʿAlī’s eldest son, and Šams Hānim (d. 1266/1850), one of the wives of Muḥammad ʿAlī are buried amongst other royal figures. In the last dome chamber (fig. 2.17), ʿAbbās Ḥelmy I (d. 1270/1854) is buried with one of his wives, his daughter, and his only surviving son Ibrahim Ilhāmy Pāshā; joining them is Aḥmed Rifʿat Pāshā (d. 1273/1857–1858), Ibrāhīm Pāshā’s son, and his wife Šams Hānim (d. 1308/1890–1891).\n\nBuilding chronology\n\n23Starting at the earliest possible historical point, Muḥammad Mahran suggests that the primary stage of the ḥūš originally dates back to the Mamluk period based on an account from Clot‑Bey’s Aperçu général sur l’Égypte, which claims:\n\n26 Clot-Bey, Aperçu général sur l’Égypte, vol. 2, pp. 555–556; the original text reads: “Dans le c (...)\n\nIn the cemetery of al-Imām al‑Šāfʿī in Cairo, a rectangular building was built during the Mamluk period near the large dome of the al‑Imām al‑Šāfʿī Mosque. In this building his highness Muḥammad ʿAlī Pāshā built a grand shrine for his son Ṭūsūn who died of the plague upon his return from campaigns against the Wahabin in the lands of the Arabs, along with additional tombs for other members of the family who had answered the calling of their lord and died since he [Muḥammad ʿAlī] started ruling the Egyptian lands.\n\n27When discussing the year 1816 as a potential date for the attribution of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā, the adjacent burial place of the Šarīf family should be taken into consideration. The neighboring mausoleum, which is also situated on Imām al-Layth Street, has a foundation inscription panel that mentions the royal cemetery. The square marble panel inscribed in thuluth translates as follows:\n\n32 Qurʾan 4:78; the original text reads: “bismillāh al-Raḥman al-raḥīm, qāl Allāh tabārak wa-taʿāllā a (...)\n\nIn the name of God, the most Gracious, the most Merciful\n\nsaid God, Exalted and Almighty, wherever you may be\n\ndeath will overtake you even if you were in fortified towers\n\nThis mausoleum was established and renovated by the honorable Affandina\n\nHis Excellency Muḥammad Šarīf during his lifetime\n\nInside the ḥūš of the benefactor the Khedive next to Sayyid\n\nal‑Imām al‑Šāfʿī and by it he gained from God\n\nthe continuous reward so date this\n\nwith the genuineness of the mighty lights.\n\n28A central cartouche on this panel contains the date 1231 (1815–1816). Though the inscriptions only mention a “ḥūš”, not necessarily a building, the word “bi‑dāḫil” (inside) interestingly implies an enclosure that to some extent has spatially defined parameters.\n\n35 Mahran 1998, pp. 131–132; this foundation inscription as well as the stelae inscriptions on the cen (...)\n\nIn the reign of the Sulṭān of Sulṭāns of the age\n\nand Emperor of Emperors of the world\n\nʿAbd al-Maǧid Ḫan, may God preserve his kingdom,\n\nconstruction of this beautiful structure\n\nfor the sake of the heavenly dwelling of Ibrāhīm Pāshā;\n\nhis honorable sons\n\nAḥmad Pāshā, and Ismāʿīl Pāshā\n\nand his Excellency Muṣṭafā Pāshā, in the year 1270 (1854),\n\nwith the adornment of all, made it complete.\n\nSanglāḫ Ḫurāsānī numbered it.\n\n30Certain scholars have considered this date to be the only solid evidence indicating when the building must have existed. But this date unfortunately does not determine when Ḥūš al-Bāšā was actually first built. If scholars are eager to settle for a terminus ante quem, then it might as well be the one provided by a decree from the Khedival court, dated 30 Šawwāl 1279 (July 27, 1853), which authorizes the removal of a wall in Ḥūš al‑Bāšā in order to place the oversized tomb of Ibrāhīm Pāshā in its current position. The decree declares:\n\n36 Diwan al-madāris, p. 99; the original text reads: “ṣadar al-amr bi-l-mūwāfqa ʿala al-ṭalab al-muqad (...)\n\nThe order was issued to approve the request submitted by their excellencies Aḥmad Pāshā, Ismāʿīl Pāshā, Muṣṭafā Bey, sons of the late Ibrāhīm Pāshā, regarding the permit to make an opening on the riverine [northern] wall to enter the installation of the late Pāshā’s tomb to its headquarters, provided that the demolition and construction costs are on the aforementioned princes.\n\n32A watercolor drawing in the Victoria and Albert Museum by the artist Antonio Schranz Jr., titled “Mausoleum of Mehmet Ali and his family at Cairo” and dated roughly to 1840–1850 (fig. 7), depicts Ḥūš al‑Bāšā from the position of where Ibrāhīm Pāshā’s tomb currently is (fig. 2.16) looking back towards the adjacent chamber (fig. 2.15). The drawing is fairly simple and unnaturalistic, but it’s realistic rendering of certain architectural details provides the viewer with enough visual information to be able to effectively identify each of the illustrated tombs and evaluate the decorative status of the cemetery at the time this drawing was created. The artist captures the wall segments oddly protruding to either side of the doorway in the far back as well as the tension between the grilled window and the muqarnas of the squinch directly above it (fig. 8), all of which are minute but crucial visual features that verify the drawing’s realism and the artist’s location in the cemetery. Based on the motifs of the depicted cenotaphs, their relative location within each chamber, the color of the cartouches on the stele, and the design of the adorning headdresses, the tombs depicted on the left belong to ʿAlī son of Muḥammad ʿAlī (d. 1252/1836–1837), Ibrāhīm Pāshā Yakan nephew of Muḥammad ʿAlī (d. 1262/1845–1846), and Muḥammad Bey the Daftardar (d. 1249/1833–1834) (figs. 9a–c). The tomb depicted in the drawing behind the arch on the right is the shared cenotaph between Zahraʾ ʿAʾiša the daughter of Muḥammad ʿAlī (d. 1246/1831) and Kulthūm the daughter of ʿAlī Ṭūsūn (d. 1278/1861) (fig. 10). After establishing the reliability of this representation, one is able to deduce that sometime between 1845 and approximately 1850, these dome chambers were not yet decorated in the style we see today (fig. 11).\n\n34Another sketch titled “Ville du Caire: vue du tombeau de Toussoun Pacha, fils de Mohamed Ali Pacha, vice‑roi d’Égypte, bâti dans le cimetière de l’Imām” (MS 1310–fol. 70b) depicts the same view of the tombs in Ḥūš al‑Bāšā along with an architectural plan (MS 1310–fol. 70a) (fig. 13). This rendition was produced by Pascal Coste on September 25, 1822. A visual comparison between this rendition and that of the aforementioned plate XXIX_LXIV shows some major differences:\n\na. the adjacent space indicated next to Ṭūsūn’s cenotaph in plate XXIX_LXIV is represented, instead, as an arched niche in the sketch “Ville du Caire” as well as the architectural plan, which is consistent with the present-day structural layout of Ṭūsūn’s chamber;\n\nb. the antechamber where Coste depicts figures emerging in plate XXIX_LXIV is blocked off in “Ville du Caire” by a stone wall with an entryway, which is also more true to Ḥūš al‑Bāšā’s existing architecture and, specifically, the doorway that currently connects the series of irregular dome chambers to the later architectural additions;\n\nc. the flat roofing that appears in plate XXIX_LXIV is not included in “Ville du Caire”, though fine traces of its outlines and hints of the cornices are discernible;\n\nd. additional details depicted in the sketch “Ville du Caire”, such as the ceiling shaft with stalactites in the foreground and the two jug-like water dispensers across from the entryway are found neither in plate XXIX_LXIV nor in Ḥūš al‑Bāšā today;\n\ne. a simplified version of the elaborate decorative scheme illustrated in plate XXIX_LXIV is only applied to half of the sketched structure represented in “Ville du Caire”.\n\nTravel accounts: comments and criticisms\n\n41Similar to paintings and drawings, travel accounts can be methodologically problematic as they range from relatively accurate to whimsical; nevertheless, they become of great importance for understanding the spatial layout and visual transformation of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā. Nineteenth‑century travelers enable us to fill scholarly gaps, which modern researchers have failed to bridge with what little information they have, by providing us with the opportunity to virtually go back in time and experience spaces as they were or, at the very least, as they seemed to be in their original historical contexts. Acknowledging the limitations set by a travel account’s distorted perceptions, this study will situate itself on the margins of these anecdotes in the sense that it will function mainly as a commentary to first, understand the knowledge given by the text and second, cross-reference this information in order to reach plausible conclusions regarding the building chronology of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā.\n\n52 St. John, Egypt and Mohammed Ali, pp. 135–136.\n\nOn reaching the enclosed space in which stood the tombs of the Pasha’s family, we found the keeper of the grounds seated beside an elegant mausoleum, with a stone canopy supported on four columns. Of him we asked and obtained permission to enter. Over the graves an edifice divided into several apartments has been erected […] The tomb of Toussoun Pasha, an ardent young man, who is said to have resembled Raphael in the manner of his death, was covered with withered flowers. That of his mother occupied, not many paces distant, the most distinguished place; and those of the other members of the family lay ranged around elegantly, tasteful, melancholy, in the midst of their golden ornaments.\n\n43Since both Lushington and St. John highlight only the prominent tombs of Ṭūsūn, Ismāʿīl, and Amīna amongst less significant others; the five domes or “several apartments” referred to in the texts could possibly be narrowed down to the contiguous chambers flanking the barrel vault (fig. 2.10–14). However, the two adjacent domes (fig. 2.15–16) were most likely already constructed at the time St. John had visited the cemetery because four people who are currently buried there died before 1834, including Fātima the daughter of Muḥammad ʿAlī (d. 1248/1833) and Zahraʾ ʿAʾiša Hānim the sister of Muḥammad ʿAlī (d. 1246/1831), and their elaborate cenotaphs would have unlikely been left in the outdoors. Later in 1838, Stephens gives a more comprehensible description of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā:\n\n53 Stephens, Incidents of Travel in Egypt, vol. 1, p. 42.\n\nThe tomb of the pacha is called the greatest structure of modern Egypt. It is a large stone building, with several domes, strongly but coarsely made. The interior, still, solemn, and imposing, is divided into two chambers; in the first, in a conspicuous situation, is the body of his favorite wife, and around those of the other members of his family; in the other chamber several tombs, covered with large and valuable cashmere shawls; several place yet unoccupied, and in one corner a large vacant place, reserved for the pacha himself. Both apartments are carpeted, and illuminated with lamps, with divans in the recesses, and little wicker chairs for the different members of the family who come to mourn and pray.\n\n44The American traveler divides the royal cemetery into two separate areas: the dome chambers flanking the barrel vault (fig. 2.10–14) and the dome chambers adjacent to them (fig. 2.15–16). It is unclear whether or not ʿAbbās Pāshā’s dome chamber (fig. 2.17) was already built at the time, but considering the fact that several places were still unoccupied as Stephens notes, there may not have been the need to build another chamber just yet; Wilde’s account may shed more light on this matter:\n\n54 Wilde, Narrative of a Voyage, pp. 217–218.\n\nWe were conducted into a well-lit chamber, which strange to say, was in the form of a cross; in the center of this was a row of tombs of white marble and constructed in the usual Turkish style […] Several splendid chandeliers hung from the arched roof […] Many of the tombs were strewn with flowers, not yet withered, and the apartment was well lighted by windows in European style, furnished with splendid pink silken curtains. At one end of the chamber is a space left for his highness.\n\n57 Du Camp, Le Nil, p. 56; the original text reads: “Sous une coupole constantinopolitaine, dans une c (...)\n\nUnder a Constantinopolitan dome, in a very large room, built of very precious materials, but so ill‑disposed that they become ugly, we have gathered all that can give an idea of the bad taste of Turks, the yellow, blue, red stelae, upset with golden foliage, topped with impossible turbans and improbable tarbouches, stand on illuminated sepulchers of tones so garish and so disparate, that they make eyes blink and irritate ears like the wrong notes of a flageolet blown by a child.\n\n47These harsh accounts report that clearly certain travelers were not fond of the newly adopted quasi‑European style at Ḥūš al‑Bāšā, but also, more importantly, that the visual transformation of the mausoleum’s decorative repertoire had already started by the time these two Frenchmen visited Cairo in the mid‑nineteenth century.\n\n48While the lines between earlier phases of building are blurred, the dates and patrons of later architectural additions to Ḥūš al‑Bāšā are fortunately clear. The dome chamber belonging solely to Šafaq Nūr has a foundation inscription above its doorway (fig. 17), attributing the chamber to the patronage of Khedive Tawfīq and the date to 1883–1884. In four cartouches of Arabic, the inscription proclaims:\n\n58 The original text reads: “ḫdiwīnā Tawfīq ānšaʾ bi-birrihi maqāmā bihi al-raḥmāt lāḥ ḍīāʾūha l-wālid (...)\n\nOur Khedive Tawfīq created with his reverence\n\na tomb within which mercy shines bright\n\nfor his late mother whose date of death was:\n\nŠafaq Nūr in the house of bliss is her delight. 1301.\n\n51The cemetery is also not an Ottoman continuation of any Mamluk plan. For example, Ḥūš al‑Bāšā neither follows the mosques of Maḥmūd Pāshā (1567) and Alṭī Barmak (1621–1622, 1711) that employ the plan of the Sulṭān Ḥasan Complex (1356–1363) by placing the mausoleum behind the qibla wall of a prayer area, nor does it follow the Mosque of Murad Pāshā (1578) that adopts the funerary Khanqah plan introduced by the complex of al‑Ašraf Barsbāy (1432). Ḥūš al‑Bāšā clearly belongs neither to the Imperial nor the local category of architectural plans, and functions exclusively as an enclosed burial ground. It was simply unplanned and, consequently, unprecedented.\n\n52To summarize the building chronology of Ḥūš al-Bāšā, some construction at the cemetery first happened in 1808–1809 according to the allegedly missing foundation inscription mentioned in a documented letter from the archives of Dar al‑Wathāʾiq al‑Qawmiyya. The mausoleum could have primarily consisted of the two shallow‑domed chambers (fig. 2.11–12), considering: a) the absence of any decoration; b) the accounts relayed by Clot Bey, Coste, and Pückler‑Muskau of a pre‑existing rectangular building with arcades; and, c) the fact that these two chambers contain the earliest tomb dating to 1805. It is confirmed that by 1816, Ṭūsūn’s dome chamber was constructed (fig. 2.10), but it is unclear whether the adjacent domes of his brother Ismāʿīl and his mother Amīna were also built by then or added later (fig. 2.13–14). Ismāʿīl’s chamber would have certainly been built by his death in 1822 as depicted by Coste in his architectural plan of the mausoleum. Similarly, the adjacent chamber belonging to Amīna Hānim and Ruqayya Hānim would have been added sometime before 1823 considering both of their death dates. The chamber of Ibrāhīm Pāshā and the one connected to it (fig. 2.15–16) would have been built at the same time, as early as 1831 and most certainly prior to 1838. Meanwhile, the last dome chamber that belongs to ʿAbbās Pāshā (fig. 2.17) would have been added later to the mausoleum by 1851 because that is when his wife, Hamdim Qadīn, died and was buried there. The elaborate decorative program of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā was applied in the mid-nineteenth century, based on Antonio Schranz Jr.’s realistic visual representation of the cemetery, and repaired later by Ibrāhīm Pāshā’s sons after removing a wall in their father’s chamber in 1854.\n\nCategories of ornamentation\n\n54The decorative sobriety of Ḥūš al-Bāšā’s façade leaves a visitor unprepared for the enchanted space within, where under the filtered lights shining through stained glass, the air is filled with mystery and the stones unravel their history (fig. 11). Marble tombs stand side by side, towering over the living, as markers of where the dead lie below and embodiments of who they were in this life. Gerard de Nerval once likened the cemetery of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā to a city; the French writer explains:\n\n65 Wiet 1959, p. 262; the original text reads: “Il y a là plus de soixante tombes, grandes et petites, (...)\n\nThere are more than sixty graves, large and small, new for the most, and composed of white marble cenotaphs. Each of these cenotaphs is surmounted either by a turban or a woman’s headdress, which gives all Turkish tombs a character of funereal reality; it seems that one walking through a petrified crowd. The most important of these tombs are draped in rich fabrics and wear turbans of silk and cashmere: the illusion is even more poignant.\n\nInscriptions\n\n56With the appropriate absence of figural decoration, epigraphy plays a crucial role in the iconography of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā as both a key source of information and a chief element of ornamentation. The various inscriptions employed at the royal cemetery reveal information about the history of the mausoleum, the identities of the dead buried within it, and the Islamic ideologies of the patrons who commissioned it.\n\n57The Day of Judgement is the first epigraphic theme a visitor confronts at Ḥūš al‑Bāšā. Visible from afar, prior to entering the mausoleum, verses from surat al-Ġāšīa line the drum of the dome above the entrance vestibule (fig. 19). Four lines, two Qurʾanic verses each, state:\n\n67 Qurʾan 88:8-10.\n\non that Day faces will be glowing with bliss, pleased with their striving\n\nin an exalted Garden, where no idle talk will be heard\n\nin it will be a running spring, along with thrones raised high\n\nand goblets set at hand, and cushions lined up.\n\n58In this context, a parallel is established between those buried in Ḥūš al‑Bāšā and the ones referred to in these verses, as opposed to those mentioned in the preceding verses whose faces will be downcast on that Day, exhausted, overburdened, and left to drink from a scalding spring. Upon reading the various descriptions of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā written by nineteenth-century travelers, one wonders if these verses are not just a promise to the dead royals but also a projection of what the visitor will see upon entering the cemetery.\n\n62The Islamic conviction that God alone possesses immortality is further emphasized in the non-Qurʾanic inscriptions on tombstones. For example, the Turkish inscriptions on the tombstone of Ruqayya Hānim, the daughter of Ismāʿīl Pāshā, state:\n\nHe remains\n\nWhere is Haǧar? Where is Sara? Where is Mariam? Where is Balqis [the Queen of Šeba]?\n\nOf course those who honor this guest house [earth] leave\n\nThis is how life in this world comes to an end, and [only] He is Alive and He remains.\n\n63The text goes on to explain how the world is at its best sorrowful and that its only blessing is salvation from all evil. Here, Ruqayya is compared to the most powerful and pious women in Islam only to show that in the end, they all died. Similarly, the inscriptions on Ibrāhīm Pāshā’s tomb ask in Persian, “where is King Sulaymān now?” The point of these rhetorical questions is to assert that nobody evades death; no matter how mighty or important someone is, death will always prevail.\n\n64While religious inscriptions are confined to the drum of the entrance dome and the surfaces of tombs, foundation inscription panels occupy customary zones on the lintels and dado. Besides the missing foundation inscription panel that allegedly used to be above the main entrance of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā, the cemetery has a total of two other foundation inscriptions that belong explicitly to the chambers of Šafaq Nūr and Ibrāhīm Pāshā.\n\n66The precise role of the second craftsman becomes less of a mystery after taking another look at the last two cartouches of Šafaq Nūr’s inscription panel:\n\nfor his late mother whose date of death started\n\nŠafaq Nūr in the house of bliss is her delight. 1301 (1883–1884).\n\n69Displaying power was intrinsic to the Ottomans both in life and in death as indicated by the repeated use of chronograms in the royal tombs of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā, including those of ʿAbbās Pāshā I, Ilhāmy Pāshā, and Ibrāhīm Pāshā. The stele crowning ʿAbbās Pāshā I’s tomb presents separate cartouches containing lines of Ottoman poetry, the last few of which state:\n\n80 ʿAbd Allāh, ʿAbd al-Sattār ʿUthmān 2004, pp. 313–314.\n\nhis reign was short, but the truth was\n\nthat he had revived Egypt with his justice and benevolence\n\nwith grief his date of death was recorded\n\nmay the Garden of Eden be a place for ʿAbbās Pāshā. 1270\n\n71Though Ḥūš al-Bāšā’s other foundation inscription panel belonging to Ibrāhīm Pāshā’s dome chamber does not contain any chronograms like that of Šafaq Nūr’s, the tomb of Ibrāhīm Pāshā does—one on each stele (fig. 20). The eastern stele narrates a poem in Arabic that compares Ibrāhīm Pāshā’s tomb to a holy site of pilgrimage, a garden with a delightful aroma, an elevated place with a river running beneath it, and a heaven where wishes come true. The inscriptions continue to state that Ibrāhīm Pāshā had prayed to God for more blessings and was thus flooded with wine and welcomed by maidens with gorgeous eyes. The last two cartouches state:\n\n82 The original Arabic inscription reads: “wa-daʿāh Riḍwān bušrāk ʾārakh zuīnat li-l-qudūm janna ʿadn”\n\nthe gatekeeper of heaven has called upon you with good news in the date\n\nfor your presence the heaven of Eden was decorated.\n\n72The inscription clearly indicates that the last line of the poem ought to be a chronogram, but the number 854 that it denotes is inconsistent with the dates cited in other literary and epigraphical sources, including the date provided by the other stele. The Turkish inscriptions on the western stele associate Ibrāhīm Pāshā with Ibrāhīm “the builder of God’s House”, describe his bravery on the battlefield, and state that, despite his unmatched glory, time was not in his favor because he only governed Egypt for seventy‑one days and departed when he was sixty years old on the fifteenth of Ḏul‑Ḥiǧa. The last two cartouches of the poem proclaim:\n\nI have said of this perfect person the history in full\n\nThe Garden of Eden will be Ibrāhīm Pāshā’s place.\n\n73Here, the chronogrammatic last line offers the date 1264 (1848), which is the official date of Ibrāhīm Pāshā’s death; nevertheless, this date is different from the ones engraved on the cenotaph by Sanglāḫ Ḫurāsānī and mentioned in the foundation inscription panel. The calligrapher repeatedly states in small cartouches engraved on every side of the cenotaph the date 1267 (1850–1851) under his name, which possibly indicated the completion of this masterpiece of a cenotaph that he designed and executed. The foundation inscription panel mentions the date 1270 (1854), which, as previously discussed, most likely refers to the installation of the tomb as well as the completion of the chamber’s structural and decorative repairs after the northern wall was removed in 1853.\n\n86 Fromentin, Voyage en Égypte, pp. 142–143; the original text reads: “La nécropole de Méhémet-Ali vau (...)\n\nʿAbbās is there under a tomb in bad taste. There are children in their tombs, smaller and less decorated. That of Ibrāhīm Pāshā alone is beautiful and makes you very solemn, perhaps because of the name of the deceased. It has the consecrated form, raised on successive degrees or stages, in the shape of an altar, all in marble, finely, surprisingly, very heavily chiseled in high relief. All the background is painted a dark indigo blue. The intricate work of the arabesques, the numbers, the Arabic characters with which it is loaded from top to bottom, are gilded with a very thick gold. It looks like carved wood without much taste, but with a very skillful hand. A green curtain, raised at the angles, serves as a canopy, and two large war banners, in crimson and green silk, edged and embroidered with faded gold, form on each side a noble and martial canopy.\n\nThe Floral ornament: appropriation and cultural continuity\n\n78Floral ornament has always been a component of the Ottoman decorative tradition, but amidst the plethora of palmettes, rosettes, scrolls, arabesques, tulips, lotuses, and acanthus leaves at Ḥūš al‑Bāšā, some floral motifs were adopted, some abandoned, and others adapted. In an illustrated treatise on Ottoman Architecture titled the ʾUsul‑i Miʿmari‑i ʿOsmani (Fundamentals of Ottoman Architecture), prepared by the Ottoman government in Turkish, French, and German for the Vienna World Exposition, the text claims:\n\n90 De Launay et al., L’architecture ottomane, p. 71; the original text reads: “les artistes ottomans n (...)\n\nThe Ottoman artists did not go very far to seek the types of their ornamentation; they took them among the plants in the vegetable patch or the flowers in the garden of their own house. The natural form has undergone various successive modifications in their hands and has ended up taking on a conventional character, a character which is eminently suited to decoration, the shape of the foliage, fruits and flowers thus having acquired new qualities, which have put them in perfect harmony with the nature of the materials used to represent them.\n\n80It comes as no surprise that chinoiserie appears on the chiseled and colored surfaces of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā, such as the modified or, rather, “Ottomanized’’ versions of peonies that appear on Ibrāhīm Pāshā’s tomb (fig. 21). Chinese designs have always been a main source of inspiration for the Ottomans since their introduction to the Islamic world during the Pax Mangolica. The authors of the ʾUsūl‑i Miʿmāri‑i ʿOsmāni admit that Ottoman artists were very much aware of the Chinese floral program but that they approached the style critically; in defense of Ottoman artists and architecture, the text states:\n\n92 De Launay et al., 1873, p. 73; the original text reads: “les conceptions chinoises ne leur étaient (...)\n\nChinese designs are not unknown to them. They have studied their ingenious motifs, analyzed and modified them, and have never slavishly copied them. Extremely skillful craftsmen, they attentively pursued a goal which they had drawn up in advance, and carefully calculated all the transformations which they wished to implement. By thus passing certain conceptions of Chinese artists into the dominion of Ottoman art, they did not accept them without making them undergo notable improvements, and never, for example, allowed the monstrous discontinuities which characterize Chinese ornamentation.\n\n82Different stylizations of plants in vases can also be found on many of the cenotaphs at Ḥūš al‑Bāšā, some are depicted stiffly while others are relatively natural. For example, the stele surmounted on Muṣṭafā Bey’s tomb (d. 1231/1816) has a symmetrical plant with a central stem growing out of a goblet‑like vase (fig. 22). Meanwhile, the cenotaph shared between Zahraʾ ʿAʾiša (d. 1246/1831) and Kulthūm (d. 1278/1861) is decorated with vases of intertwining stems and flowering plants that seem as though they are wilting (fig. 10). The plants on the latter tomb, though still symmetrical, show more fluidity in comparison with the earlier one. With time, the same motif continued to stylistically develop in naturalism and dimensionality as indicated by the later cenotaph of Ḫalīl Pāshā Yakan (d. 1310/1892) and Muṣṭafā Pāshā Yakan (d. 1263/1846), whereby vases with three‑dimensional bouquets of flowers adorn the sides and swooping curvilinear plants that flare out of cornucopias dominate the stelae (figs. 23a–b). While the cornucopia can be traced to the mosaics at the Dome of the Rock and to pre-Islamic prototypes, the style in which the motif is rendered recalls other diverse sources.\n\n86The same identity crisis faces the reciprocating design above the foundation inscription panel of Šafaq Nūr’s chamber (fig. 17), which can on the one hand be perceived by scholars as a simplified version of the patterns used in Mughal art, specifically manuscripts, such as the borders from a double page Indian Qurʾan folio written for the Sulṭān of Lahore and dated to 1573 (fig. 29). On the other hand, this study argues that the basic design is mimicking the joggled lintels of monuments in Cairo. Certainly, this type of motif can also be found in Ottoman architecture, such as the surviving plasterwork in the hot room of Ismāʿīl Bey’s Hamam dated to the sixteenth century; however, the style of this repeating pattern as well as the fact that it was not applied to a larger surface area as usual and, instead, occupies a closed frame above the doorway directly points at local sources. Comparable local examples are the lintels of the Mausoleum of al‑Saliḥ Nağm al‑Dīn (1249), of the Mosque of Baybārs (1267–1269), and especially in the mihrab of the Mosque of al-Muʾayyad Sheikh (1412–1421).\n\n87The transmission of ornamented designs from one medium to another, from stone to plaster and paint in this case, would not have been unusual for the artists of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā who had used imitation marble for the upper walls and squinches in four of the dome chambers (fig. 30). The brown veins of the painted plaster capture the same effect of the Byzantine technique of slicing marble into panels of symmetrical designs, recalling the dado at the Dome of the Rock and, most importantly, the grand monument of the Ottoman Empire—Hagia Sophia.\n\n89A detail that was also most commonly used on Anatolian Seljuk monuments but was more likely drawn from geographically closer precedents would be the pattern of interlacing geometric design to either side of the stone-carved portal (fig. 3); while the incorporation of rosettes in this geometric design makes it comparable to the one carved on the stone dome of Sulṭān al‑Ašraf Barsbāy’s complex in the Northern Cemetery (1432), the density of its interlacing pattern in particular recalls the bands of overlapping design outside the entrance portal of the Complex of Sulṭān Ḥasan (1356–1363). By far, the strongest visual reference of a pattern in Ḥūš al‑Bāšā to a local precedent is the beautifully painted design decorating Šafaq Nūr’s dome, which evokes the same interlacing knotted grid with arabesque foliage adorning the dome at the Mosque of Sulaymān Pāshā (1528) and, intriguingly, the exterior design on the Mamluk stone dome of Khayrbak’s Funerary Complex (1502–1521).\n\n91The ornamental categories employed at the royal cemetery each serve aesthetic and symbolic purposes simultaneously. Inscriptions, Qurʾanic and poetic, invoked blessings to the deceased in the afterlife. Ornamental plants, flowers, and fruits evoked notions of paradise. Even the European forms, which may seem superficial and flamboyant, emerge as markers of imperialism in association with a modern image. Another royal indicator is the crescent moon and stars adorning the slabs and stele of Ibrāhīm Pāshā’s tomb (fig. 27), which in any other context would have been charged with lunar connotation as opposed to being an established symbol of the Ottoman state.\n\n92Practices of cultural appropriation and adaptation have always been characteristic of arts produced in the Islamic world and the arts of the Ottoman Empire are no exception in this regard. Situated artistically somewhere between the familiar and the foreign, the decorative program of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā displays an intriguing fusion of cultural forms. Some motifs can be attributed to Ottoman and local traditions, other novel forms are suggestive of Iranian, European, and Mughal inspirations, and very few shapes remain ambiguous, but none can be identified as absolutely one or the other. There is a fluidity to the forms of Ottoman art generally and Ḥūš al‑Bāšā specifically that makes them resist modern categories of analysis, a cultural flow that allows them to be concurrently Turkish and Baroque, Chinese and Mamluk, and infinitely more. Every element that is interwoven in the iconographic fabric of the royal cemetery is a mutation and a reproduction that has transcended temporally and geographically, representing not a single cultural identity but a manifested symbolic meaning. After examining what many of the decorative elements of the mausoleum stand for, the question becomes: what does Ḥūš al‑Bāšā as a whole represent?\n\nIndependence within boundaries\n\n93The Ottoman Empire is often stereotyped as a multi-cultural outpost and its arts as hybrids of an otherwise advanced Islamic visual culture; however, the reality is more complex. Arts of the Ottoman Empire, especially towards the nineteenth century, were the products of dismantling past cultural patterns in order to create a new social order. Ḥūš al‑Bāšā is the manifestation of this new social order and its rapid stylistic evolution is the memory of a strategic synthetic process.\n\n94After surveying and analyzing the blend of appropriated cultural forms employed in the royal cemetery, the attention will henceforth shift to the vectors of influence driving these eclectic tendencies. Was Ottoman architecture in Cairo simply echoing the artistic milieu in Istanbul? Did the reformist agenda of the imperial state, materialized in the form of the Tanẓīmāt documents, resonate across the empire’s provinces? If Muḥammad ʿAlī had not shared the same vision of modernity for Egypt as the Ottoman Sulṭāns did for their empire, would the alleged central authority of the state have continued to influence building activities in Cairo? Last but not least, was the culturally diverse background of the Ottoman architect a passive agent or a convenient asset in this process of architectural eclecticism? Such questions must be carefully considered in the hopes of understanding whether Ḥūš al-Bāšā was indeed a strategically synthetic achievement or an unresolved hybrid monstrosity, or possibly somewhere between the two.\n\n96The dome chamber of Šafaq Nūr also combines old and new visual forms from both foreign and domestic cultural contexts to create an unusual mode of architectural expression. This chamber simultaneously pays homage to the past while breaking free from it by mixing the sixteenth‑century Cairene dome pattern with the seventeenth-century European vegetal motifs on the cenotaph, and the novel color stripes edged with lotuses on the upper walls. To some scholars, this juxtaposition of such intrinsically diverse elements highlights the tensions between modernity and anachronism that infamously became typical of nineteenth‑century Ottoman buildings; however, in comparison to the literally superficial additions of ornamental forms plastered on the walls of the older dome chambers of Ḥūš al‑Bāšā, the decorative elements in Nur’s chamber show balance and unity whereby earlier Ottoman experiments with the so‑called eclectic forms were finally molded into a synthesized whole.\n\n97Šafaq Nūr’s chamber (fig. 4), which was added to the mausoleum approximately thirty years after the mid‑nineteenth century renovations, shows a far more developed sense of cohesive visual identity in comparison to the irregular dome chambers. Admittedly, it is more convenient for decorative motifs to be fully integrated with the structure and one another when they have been planned in advance as opposed to being applied to a pre‑existing structure as was the case with the mid‑nineteenth century renovations. The Ottoman artists of the royal cemetery clearly tried to integrate their borrowed European styles of ornamentation by incorporating luscious garlands, rococo reliefs, and acanthus leaves into the rich marble carving program of later cenotaphs, but, regardless of their noble efforts, the plastered additions to the irregular dome chambers continue to function in a relatively independent manner as an artistic afterthought.\n\nEchoing eclecticism: state versus province\n\n104This period of dramatic change witnessed a multitude of foreign influences across the Ottoman Empire. Extending from the eighteenth century into the nineteenth century, this systematic shift towards modernity was consolidated by socio‑political reforms that were implemented by the Ottoman state and adopted by the provinces, not necessarily in a center-periphery type of model whereby provinces were connected vertically to the center and the reforms were diffused from culturally stronger to politically weaker cities; rather, in the case of a relatively independent province like Cairo, the complex interplay between authorities was one of constant cultural reciprocation and political reconciliation.\n\n106The early Tanẓīmāt architecture in both Istanbul and Cairo was by the 1840’s essentially a culmination of a long building tradition defined mostly by its appropriation of European stylistic forms. The Dolmabahçe Palace (1849–1856) and the Ortaköy Mosque (1854–1855) stand by the waterfront of the Bosphorus, in their parade of French neoclassical decorative features, as testaments of this period’s fully-fledged westernization. Catching up slowly but surely, features of the new style began marking their presence on the facades of Ottoman buildings and the interiors of palaces in Cairo, including the two sebils commissioned in the 1820’s by Muḥammad ʿAlī to commemorate the deaths of his sons and his palace in Shubra. The Tanẓīmāt period in Cairo witnessed the catalyzed progress in which the European mode of ornamentation, claiming its place in the local visual culture, developed into the style adopted by Ḥūš al‑Bāšā in the mid-nineteenth century and matured eventually into the decorative character represented by the selamlik built by Ḥasan Fouad Pāshā El‑Manasterly in 1851 and the Palace built by Ḥabīb Pāshā Sakākīnī in 1897.\n\n107The eclecticism of the new artistic tradition, though evidently orchestrated at the highest levels, cannot be credited single-handedly to any one entity. The stylistic orientation of nineteenth‑century Ottoman architecture was first set in motion by a succession of Sulṭāns, then implemented by the Imperial state, consumed by the provinces, and, last but not least, executed by the artisans. Many scholars argue that this highly eclectic blend of appropriated forms was introduced by the ethnically diverse architects and artisans of the Ottoman Empire, who were predominantly Greek and Armenian. The agency of a ḏimmī craftsman’s cultural and educational background can be demonstrated by the fluency in which European motifs were executed on Ottoman Imperial buildings, but the material culture created by these craftsmen for their own communities provide compelling evidence that they were ahead of the Ottoman-Baroque trend and may have very well set some of the earliest precedents for the new style.\n\n110Buildings and politics alike cannot be perceived in a vacuum, and only by placing them within the unique cultural circumstances that originally created them can they unravel their complex meanings. When examined in isolation, Ḥūš al‑Bāšā represents a moment of decisive architectural transformation or a sentiment of dramatic decorative rupture; however, if one chooses to take a step back and look at the bigger picture, it will become clearer that the mausoleum’s moment of visual transformation belonged to a long Ottoman tradition of stylistic synthesis formed by the rise of a distinctively modern historical consciousness across the empire.\n\n112In the process of examining Ḥūš al‑Bāšā’s historiography, this study managed to trace the architectural development and reconstruct the first comprehensive building chronology of the royal cemetery. The earliest mention of a building dates some of the construction at Ḥūš al‑Bāšā to 1808–1809, which could have primarily, but not exclusively, consisted of the two shallow dome chambers. Primary sources by contemporary historians confirmed that Ṭūsūn’s dome chamber was already constructed and prepared for his burial upon his death in 1816. Though it remains unclear whether or not the adjacent domes of Ismāʿīl and Amīna were also built at the same time as Ṭūsūn’s chamber, it is certain that these two chambers would have been built before 1823. Based on a survey of all those buried in the cemetery together with the information provided by nineteenth‑century travellers, the chamber of Ibrāhīm Pāshā and the one connected to it were built sometime between 1831 and 1838. Meanwhile, the dome chamber belonging to ʿAbbās Pāshā would have been added to the mausoleum by 1851.\n\n114Ḥūš al-Bāšā is a funerary monument that commemorates partly piety, but mainly power, prestige, and progress. Every visual form in the royal cemetery is effectively employed to communicate a statement of cultural dominance. The use of three different languages for the mausoleum’s epigraphic program is a testimony to the cosmopolitan nature of the Ottoman identity, but the prominent use of the Ottoman Turkish language in comparison to Arabic and Persian creates a linguistic hierarchy in which the native language of the rulers dominates. Similarly, the repeated use of foundational chronograms in the cemetery functioned as a visual emblem of Ottomanization, indicating a local shift in the urban as well as socio-political orders. Even the content of the inscriptions, both religious and non-Qurʾanic, stresses the power of God alone to highlight primarily that death does not undermine the power of the deceased Ottoman royals; hence, the evoked associations between the royals and some of the most powerful and pious figures in Islam, comparing Ibrāhīm Pāshā to King Sulaymān and Ruqayya Hānim to Mariam.\n\n115The Ottoman legacy behind Ḥūš al‑Bāšā’s eclectic blend of decorative motifs will always be one of cultural reciprocity, appropriation, integration, and innovation unrestricted to any temporal, religious, or geographical contexts. Situated at the cultural crossroads of nineteenth-century local and imperial artistic milieus, the royal cemetery represents an evocation of classical Ottoman traditions that drew upon the past for stylistic inspiration and a veneration of modernism that looked towards the West for new modes of ornamentation. Instead of dwelling on notions of hybridity, one should approach Ḥūš al‑Bāšā as a trilingual, intersectional being with languages to be interpreted, cultural sides to be acknowledged, and a history of reform that ultimately altered its stylistic evolution.\n\n116Walking through this mystical funerary space, where chandeliers once lit up its domes, Persian rugs covered its grounds, silk curtains draped over its windows, and flowers masked its air of sorrow, one cannot help but feel an overwhelming sense of melancholy over the cemetery’s currently abandoned state. Today, with restorations indefinitely suspended, dimmed lights seep through the mausoleum’s broken windows to shine on nothing but fine dust and the memories of a distant past floating through its air. Ḥūš al‑Bāšā, a curious place waiting to be unraveled, has yet to receive the amount of scholarly attention it merits.\n\nDrawing: Mai Kolkailah.\n\nPhotos: Mai Kolkailah."
