        "text": "Home Mosques Muslim Heritage Personalities Travel Contact Us\n\nHead of Imam Hussain Burial Mosque - Cairo\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe head of Imam Husaain Burial Mosque in Cairo has zarih (tomb) of burial of Imam Hussain’s head is located next to Khan el-Khalili Bazaar. A small park is also in front of the mosque, known as the Medain Imam Hussain (Imam Hussain Square). The mosque of Imam Hussain in Cairo was built in 1154 but current building is from the 19th century. A small door inside the mosque gives access to the zarih where head of Imam Hussain is buried.\n\nHistory\n\nIt is said that Dawoodi Bohra Imam, Abu Mansoor Nizar al-Aziz Billah (d.386 AH/996), who traced the site of the head of Imam Hussain. One should know that the body of Imam Hussain is buried in Karbala (Iraq) but the burial of the head is open to debate. It is believed that the head of Imam Hussain was buried in Ashkelon (part of Palestine/Israel today) for 250 years.\n\nFamous Muslim traveler Ibn Batuta wrote that the head of Imam Hussain was buried in the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus but later it was brought to Palestine for re-burial. Ibn Batuta went on to say that the head was brought to Cairo to save it from the Crusaders.\n\nReburial\n\nOn Sunday 8 Jumada al-Saani, 548Hijri (31 August 1153), this head arrived from Ashkelon to Cairo for reburial. The Head of Imam Hussain reached Cairo on Tuesday 10 Jumada al-Saani (2 September 1153). Famous historian Maqrizy added that, Prince Saif of the Tamim tribe presented the noble head of Imam Hussein.\n\nSyedi Hasan bin Asadgives details of this event as follows : “When the Raas (head) al Imam al Husain was taken out of the casket, in Ashkelon, drops of the fresh blood were visible on the Raas al Imam al Husain and the fragrance of Musk spread all over. Former grand imam of Al-Azhar had written a book called Al-Ithaf (the Present), which is dedicated to affirm the existence of the head of Imam Hussein in its well-regarded location in Cairo."
