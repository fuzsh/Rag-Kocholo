        "text": "by Halalbooking 5 months ago 16 min read\n\nEveryone knows and loves Egypt as one of the most popular travel destinations in the world. Admire the pyramids in Cairo, visit some of the oldest mosques in the world, sail the Nile or discover ancient Egyptian artefacts in Upper Egyptian cities like Luxor and Aswan! As it is a Muslim country, it’s needless to say all food is halal and many hotels booked through HalalBooking are alcohol free.\n\nEgypt is an easy-to-reach destination as most major international airports fly to Cairo daily and many low-cost airlines fly to Sharm el-Sheikh from European cities. And the great thing is that an average journey from Europe takes no more than 4-5 hours, making Egypt a great short-haul destination.\n\nBelow are our top 10 most beautiful holiday destinations in Egypt, each with their own unique charm and diverse attractions, whether you’re after a city break or relaxing on the beach overlooking the Red Sea or the Mediterranean.\n\n1. Cairo\n\nHome to over 20 million people, the capital of Egypt is a city that needs little to no introduction. With its centuries-old history, from the time of the pharaohs to the rise of Islam to the present day, Cairo is ideal for the halal-conscious visitor. Setting foot in Cairo is like stepping back in time through many centuries, from the ancient Egyptian era to the reign of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nTop Cairo attractions\n\nGiza Pyramids - The Pyramids of Giza are among the seven wonders of the ancient world. Visit the three pyramids and after a visit to the Valley Temple, embark on a camel caravan ride in the desert, then visit the Great Sphinx of Giza overlooking the scenic surroundings. Following that, make your way to Sakkara, Egypt’s oldest cemetery, where you can see the world’s first monumental stone building, the Step Pyramid of King Zoser. Discover one of the magnificent Mastabas (burial chamber) of either Ptah Hotep, Idut or Mereruca.\n\nCairo Tower - The free-standing concrete tower, Cairo's second most popular attraction after the pyramids, overlooks the Cairo countryside along the Nile. From the top, you can enjoy a 360 view of the city where on a clear day you can even see the Pyramids.\n\nAl-Azhar University - Dating back to 970, Al-Azhar University is one of the world’s oldest educational institutions. The original size of Al-Azhar was half what it is today, as many additions and restorations have been made throughout Egypt’s different eras. During the fighting between the French and the British occupation, Al-Azhar played a significant role in shaping the history of Egypt.\n\nManial Palace Museum - The museum depicts an important period in the history of modern Egypt and reconciles a number of Islamic architectural traditions. It is characterised by its architectural modern Islamic design, merging with Persian and Mamluk elements and inspired by Syriac, Moroccan, Andalusian and Ottoman motifs.\n\nMuseum of Islamic Art - Renowned for having some of the world’s greatest collections of work, with exceptional exhibits of rare woodwork and plaster artefacts, as well as metal, ceramic, glass, crystal and textile objects of all periods from all over the Islamic world.\n\nWhere to pray in Cairo\n\nMohammed Ali Mosque - Also known as the Alabaster Mosque, it was commissioned in the Ottoman era in the 19th century and is the most famous mosque in Cairo as it sits on the citadel overlooking the city. The mosque was built between 1830 and 1848 and was commissioned by Muhammad Ali Pasha, the erstwhile ruler of Egypt.\n\nImam Hussein Mosque - Located in the heart of Islamic Cairo, the Imam Hussein Mosque is famous for containing the oldest complete manuscript of the Holy Quran in the world. Built in 1154, it is next to the famous Khan el-Khalili Bazaar, where merchants have sold their wares since the 14th century.\n\n2.

Three earthquakes led to its destruction and the remains were used to build the Citadel of Qaitbay in its place in the 13th century.\n\nRoman Amphitheatre - This large circular Roman theatre is the only one of its kind in the country. Though often referred to as an amphitheatre, the site is actually more of a small Roman theatre than a larger sporting arena.
