        "text": "Nile Valley and Delta\n\nThe headwaters of the Nile River are in the highlands of East Africa. The Nile flows northward across Sudan and enters Egypt near the town of Wadi Halfa. The Nile is the world’s longest river. It flows for 4,132 miles (6,650 kilometers), with 960 miles (1,545 kilometers) of its course in Egypt. Annual flooding is a natural feature of the Nile. Fed by summer rains in the highlands, the flood travels northward, reaching Egypt in August.\n\nThe Upper Nile (the southern portion of the river) is confined to a narrow valley that is no more than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) wide. Outcrops of resistant granite rock form stretches of cascades and rapids called cataracts. The First Cataract—the only one in Egypt—is at Aswan, in the southern part of the country. A dam was built there in 1902 to help control the floodwaters for irrigation. Five other cataracts are located upstream of Aswan in Sudan.\n\nThe Aswan High Dam is located upstream of the original dam. Construction began in January 1960 and was completed in July 1970. The high dam created Lake Nasser, the largest artificial lake in the world. The lake extends roughly 350 miles (550 kilometers) southward, with a portion lying in Sudan. The high dam makes possible the large-scale storage and use of Nile water independent of natural floods. It also provides Egypt with low-cost hydroelectric power.\n\nBetween Aswan and Cairo the Nile valley widens into a plain ranging in width from 6 to 9 miles (10 to 15 kilometers). The delta of the Nile begins near Cairo, where the river separates into two branches. The Damietta branch is on the west, and the Rosetta branch is on the east. The delta covers about 8,500 square miles (22,000 square kilometers). It has numerous small waterways and canals. At its northern edge several large, shallow lakes have formed as the delta continues to expand into the Mediterranean. The largest of these is Lake Manzala, which is between Damietta and Port Said.\n\nPeople\n\nEgypt is the most populous country in the Middle East. Many people live along the banks of the Nile, which has one of the highest population densities in the world. The majority of Egyptians live in agricultural villages, some of which have 20,000 or more people.\n\nMost of the country’s people are Egyptian Arabs. They are descendants of the Hamites of ancient Egypt and of the Arabs who migrated to Egypt after the Muslim conquests of the 7th century. Egypt’s Nubians live mainly south of Aswan. Many of them were resettled in new villages at Kawm Umbu (Kom Ombo) when the Aswan High Dam was built. The dam created Lake Nasser, which flooded the Nubians’ homeland. Egypt is also home to Bedouins, Roma (Gypsies), a nomadic people called the Beja, and people of mixed Arab and Amazigh (Berber) descent. Small numbers of people of European ancestry, primarily Armenians and Greeks, live in some Egyptian cities.\n\nIslam is the country’s official religion. Most Egyptians, including Egyptian Arabs and Nubians, are Sunni Muslims. A smaller number of Egypt’s Muslims practice Sufism, a form of Islamic mysticism. The largest religious minority is made up of members of the Coptic church, one of the oldest Christian churches. Egypt also has adherents of other Christian churches and a small Jewish community.\n\nArabic is the official language. Most Egyptians speak one of its many dialects. Classical Arabic is used in printed materials and in the schools. Through radio and television the government has attempted to develop a vernacular Arabic as the common language. Many educated Egyptians use English and French as second languages. French-language publications have wide circulation in Cairo and Alexandria. Nubians speak a language of the Eastern Sudanic group. The Coptic language, related to ancient Egyptian, is used today only in Coptic church services.\n\nCulture\n\nEgypt is one of the foremost centers of Arabic literature. A recurring theme of modern Egyptian novels is the impact of the West on traditional Egyptian culture. Another common theme is the Egyptian countryside. Egypt’s greatest modern novelist, Naguib Mahfouz, often wrote about life among the country’s urban poor. He is best known for The Cairo Trilogy (1956–57). In 1988 Mahfouz became the first Arabic writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. Egyptian novelists continued to enjoy critical and popular success in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Authors such as Sonallah Ibrahim, Nawal El Saadawi, Bahaa Taher, and Alaa Al Aswany rose to international prominence.\n\nMusic and dance have long played an important part in Egyptian culture. Traditional Egyptian musical styles are quite diverse. Common musical instruments include a stringed, lute-like instrument called the ʿud (oud), a type of zither called the qanun, and a flute called the nay. Others include a two-stringed fiddle called the rabab and a tambourine called the riqq. The revival of traditional Arab music, both vocal and instrumental, owes much to government sponsorship.\n\nContemporary Egyptian music embraces native forms, traditional Arab music, and Western-style music. The country’s most famous pop star was Umm Kulthum (1904–75). For almost 50 years she was the leading female vocalist not only of Egypt but also of the whole Arab world.\n\nElectronic media have played an important role in spreading mass popular culture. Egyptian television has had a powerful influence on regional tastes, and viewers throughout the Arab world tune in to Egyptian programs. The country’s most popular actors enjoy wide recognition abroad. Egyptian films are shown to audiences throughout the Arab world and are also distributed in Asian and African countries.\n\nEgypt has one of the richest architectural traditions in the world, one that spans thousands of years. Numerous locations in the country have been named UNESCO World Heritage sites for both their historic and architectural significance. From ancient Egypt, they include the Pyramids of Giza, the Valley of the Kings, and sites at Memphis, Thebes, Karnak, Luxor, Abu Simbel, and Philae. Other Egyptian World Heritage sites are from the Roman, Byzantine, and Islamic periods. Western influence can be seen in much modern architecture in Egypt. Since the late 20th century there has been a movement to combine European and Islamic architectural styles. A notable ultramodern building in Egypt is the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, which opened in Alexandria in 2002. It is the modern incarnation of the ancient Library of Alexandria.\n\nThe Egyptian Ministry of Culture is responsible for many museums in Egypt. Among them is the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, which is internationally renowned for its treasures of ancient Egypt. Other notable museums in Cairo include the Coptic Museum, the Museum of Islamic Art, and the Museum of Modern Art. The Greco-Roman Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts are in Alexandria.\n\nThe most popular sport in Egypt is soccer (association football). Cairo’s two soccer teams can attract as many as 100,000 spectators to their games. The national team, the Pharaohs, was the first African team to compete in the World Cup (1934). The team has won many titles in the African Cup of Nations, the continent’s most prestigious soccer competition. Other team sports played in Egypt include volleyball and basketball. Wrestling, weightlifting, boxing, swimming, and martial arts are also popular.\n\nEgyptian cuisine has been influenced over time by other areas of the Mediterranean, including Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, and Syria. A well-known Egyptian dish is ful mudammis, which consists of slowly cooked fava (broad) beans and spices. It is widely considered the national food. Falafel, a fried patty of ground chickpeas, is a staple throughout the Middle East and probably originated in Egypt. Kuftah, a type of spiced meatball, is also common fare. As in other countries of the region, mutton is the most widely consumed meat. Egyptians also commonly eat chicken and fish. Pigeon is a delicacy. Honey is the most common sweetener, and native fruits—particularly figs and dates—are used in most puddings and other desserts. Coffee and tea are popular drinks.\n\nEducation and Health\n\nIlliteracy has been a severe problem in Egypt. Because of advances in the educational system, however, literacy rates have gradually risen. Today, roughly three-fourths of Egyptian adults can read and write.\n\nThere are three stages of general education provided by the government—primary school (which lasts for six years), preparatory school (three years), and secondary school (three years). From ages 6 to 12, children are required to attend primary school. At the end of primary school, students take examinations. Those who do well on the tests can continue their education. There are two types of secondary schools, general and technical. General high schools offer courses of study in math, sciences, and liberal arts. Most technical schools focus on either commercial, agricultural, or industrial subjects.\n\nInstead of attending public schools, some children study at institutes associated with al-Azhar University. The university is centered on al-Azhar Mosque in Cairo. Al-Azhar has been renowned as an Islamic teaching center for more than 1,000 years. It provides schooling at the primary, preparatory, secondary, and university levels, with an emphasis on traditional Islamic subjects.\n\nEgypt has many schools of higher education. The largest is Cairo University, founded as the Egyptian University in 1908. Universities were opened at Alexandria in 1942 and at Asyut in 1957. ʿAyn Shams University, incorporating several other schools near Cairo, was established in 1950. More universities were later added to the state system. There are also several private universities. The oldest is the American University in Cairo, which was founded in 1919.\n\nIn the late 20th century the government began spending more money on public-health programs, especially in rural areas. By the early 21st century, hundreds of hospitals and thousands of smaller health units were serving rural communities. The quality of these facilities was often low, however. Well-trained physicians and specialists are available in large numbers in the cities and larger towns.\n\nSignificant efforts have been made to promote preventive medicine. Parents are required by law to have their children vaccinated against smallpox, diphtheria, tuberculosis, and poliomyelitis (polio). Epidemics of malaria have been eliminated, though the disease is still found in the country, mainly in the south. A parasitic disease called schistosomiasis is widespread among the rural population. It presents a serious health problem.\n\nA health insurance law was passed in 1964. It requires health coverage for workers in companies with more than 100 employees as well as for all governmental and public employees. Poorer Egyptians often seek medical care at clinics or hospitals run by Islamic groups.\n\nAgriculture and Fishing\n\nAgriculture in Egypt depends almost entirely on irrigation from the Nile. Barrages and dams on the Nile, especially the Aswan High Dam, allow water to be stored for use when the river level is low. Canals distribute the water where it is needed throughout the year. Under year-round irrigation, a field may yield several crops annually. Cotton, rice, corn (maize), and sorghum are grown in summer. Barley, wheat, and fava (broad) beans are winter crops. Citrus fruits and vegetables are grown on the Mediterranean coast. Although enough fruits and vegetables are grown for the Egyptian people, only a small percent of the demand for wheat is met. Egypt imports much of its food supplies, primarily wheat and flour.\n\nCotton and cotton products are important exports. Egypt produces about one-third of the world’s long-staple cotton. The area planted in cotton, however, has greatly declined since 1968. Rice, fruits, and vegetables are also export crops. Sugarcane is grown to produce sugar for Egypt. Most cattle are used as draft animals. Sheep and goats are raised for wool and hair. Despite attempts to improve livestock husbandry, Egypt is a net importer of meat.\n\nEgypt faces growing food shortages. It has experienced rapid population growth, rapid urbanization, and an increased production of commercial export crops. These factors have intensified the pressure on a limited supply of agricultural land. Farms are limited to a maximum of 50 acres (20 hectares). Cooperatives aid farmers by renting implements and distributing seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides. Programs to increase the cultivated area through land reclamation are still ongoing. The New Valley project was begun in 1997. It is slated to bring roughly 500,000 acres (200,000 hectares) under production in the southern Western Desert by pumping water from Lake Nasser through a long canal. Major construction was completed by 2003. Similar programs have been undertaken in the western delta and the Sinai Peninsula.\n\nAfter the Aswan High Dam was built, the Egyptian government encouraged the development of a fishing industry. A fish farm and fishery complex were established at Lake Nasser. Fish culture (fish farming) contributes much of the country’s fish production.\n\nTransportation and Communications\n\nWater transportation is of primary importance in Egypt. The country has roughly 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) of navigable waterways. Half are on the Nile, and the other half are on canals, mostly in the delta.\n\nThe Suez Canal is an international shipping link between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. It is one of the world’s most heavily used shipping lanes. The canal extends 120 miles (193 kilometers) from Port Said to Suez, on the Gulf of Suez. Since 1975 the canal has been expanded to accommodate supertankers. In 2015 the Egyptian government finished a nearly $8.5 billion project to upgrade the canal. The project significantly increased the canal’s capacity. Alexandria, Port Said, Suez, Damietta, and El-Dekheila are Egypt’s major ports.\n\nFrom Cairo, rail lines extend along the Nile to Aswan. Other rail lines run across the north coast to Al-Sallum, and to Alexandria, Port Said, and Suez. A railroad parallels the west bank of the Suez Canal between Suez and Ismailia. A subway transit system for Cairo began operation in 1988.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Egypt’s roads are paved. The Ahmad Hamdi road tunnel under the Suez Canal opened in 1980. The national airline, EgyptAir, operates a full schedule of domestic and international flights.\n\nCairo is a major publishing center in the Middle East. Al-Ahram, which was founded in 1875 and is published in Cairo, is the most authoritative daily newspaper. The government owns and operates the Egyptian Radio and Television Corporation, which provides programs in a variety of languages. Satellite dishes, which receive Egyptian and foreign broadcasts, are popular and relatively common among middle-class and affluent households. Egypt has long been a regional leader in telecommunications. It has a relatively dense telephone network, and cellular telephone use is nearly universal. Despite government and Islamic censorship, all sorts of arts and information are accessible through the Internet.\n\nFrom Muhammad ʿAli to British Control\n\nMuhammad ʿAli, an officer in the Ottoman forces, became pasha, or governor, of Egypt in 1805. He launched military campaigns to expand Egypt’s territory. By 1821 he had conquered most of the northern portion of the Sudan region. ʿAli introduced many reforms to modernize Egypt. He improved the irrigation system and introduced new crops such as cotton. He also established Western-style schools in Egypt. Members of ʿAli’s family governed the country for more than 100 years. Although Egypt was still officially part of the Ottoman Empire during this period, Ottoman control of the country was weak. The Mamluks also grew less powerful.\n\nSaʿid Pasha, who was Muhammad ʿAli’s son, befriended the French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps. In 1856 Saʿid granted Lesseps the right to build the Suez Canal. It was opened in 1869 during the reign of Ismaʿil Pasha. To repay his debts to British and French bankers, Ismaʿil sold Egypt’s shares of Suez stock to Britain, giving it control of the canal. In 1876, again in debt, Ismaʿil allowed British and French officials strict control of Egypt’s finances. Meanwhile, a movement of nationalists—Egyptians who wanted to free Egypt from foreign rule—began to develop. The nationalists were not happy with the ruling family. In 1882 British forces occupied Egypt to support the monarchy in the face of the growing nationalist movement. The British quickly defeated the nationalists, but the British occupation continued. In 1899 Sudan (now Sudan and South Sudan) was established under joint British and Egyptian rule. In practice, however, Sudan became a British possession.\n\nIn World War I, the Ottoman Empire and Britain fought against each other. Britain proclaimed Egypt a protectorate, or dependent state, in November 1914. Britain then assumed responsibility for defending the Suez Canal. The nationalist movement to free Egypt from foreign rule gained strength in wartime. A countrywide nationalist organization called the Wafd was formed. After failing to reach a settlement with the Wafd, Britain abolished the protectorate. Egypt became an independent country on February 28, 1922. However, Britain retained responsibility for the security of the Suez Canal and the defense of Egypt.\n\nEgyptian Republic\n\nThe Nasser Regime\n\nA group of Egyptian army officers led by Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser overthrew King Farouk on July 23, 1952. The constitution was abolished, and political parties were dissolved. Egypt was declared a republic on June 18, 1953, and Nasser became prime minister. He was the first native Egyptian to rule Egypt in more than 2,000 years. Under Nasser, Egypt signed an agreement with Britain in 1953 that ended the union of Egypt and Sudan, resulting in independence for Sudan a few years later.\n\nAfter a new Egyptian constitution was approved in June 1956, Nasser was elected president. The British forces left Egypt in July. An international conflict called the Suez Crisis then occurred. The Suez Canal was internationally owned, mainly by British and French interests. In July 1956 Nasser declared that the canal was Egyptian property. The United States and Britain had withdrawn financial aid for the Aswan High Dam, and Nasser wanted to use revenues from the canal to finance Egypt’s share of the project. Britain and France feared that Nasser might close the Suez Canal. They did not want Egypt to cut off shipments of petroleum flowing from the Persian Gulf to western Europe. Britain and France decided to take military action, and Israel joined them as an ally. Israel invaded Sinai in October, and British and French forces landed in the canal zone in November. Nasser sank some 40 ships in the canal to block it. UN pressure brought a cease-fire and withdrawal of forces. The Suez Canal reopened in March 1957 under Egyptian control, with guarantees that other countries would be able to use the canal.\n\nEgypt and Syria merged as the United Arab Republic in 1958 and, with Yemen, formed the United Arab States. Syria withdrew from the union in 1961, and Egypt ousted Yemen. A 1963 agreement between Egypt, Syria, and Iraq to form another United Arab Republic failed.\n\nBecause of tensions between Israel and Syria, Nasser forced UN troops to withdraw from Egypt. Egypt blockaded the Gulf of Aqaba so that Israeli ships could not use it. Israel attacked Egypt on June 5, 1967, defeating the allied Arab forces in what became known as the Six-Day War. Israel occupied the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip, as well as other areas of Palestine. The Suez Canal was again blocked by damaged ships. A UN-negotiated cease-fire failed to result in a peace settlement. After the war Egypt faced severe financial crises and widespread discontent among students and workers. As efforts to reach a settlement continued through 1970, Egyptian and Israeli forces dueled across the canal.\n\nSadat Regime\n\nNasser died in September 1970 and was succeeded by Anwar el-Sadat. In April 1971 Egypt, Libya, and Syria agreed to form the Confederation of Arab Republics. However, a full union was prevented by worsening relations between Egypt and Libya.\n\nEarly in his presidency, Sadat extended peace overtures to Israel. Egypt would enter into a peace agreement if Israel would return the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt. However, Israel did not accept this offer. On October 6, 1973, Egypt and Syria launched surprise coordinated attacks on the Sinai Peninsula and another Israeli-held Arab territory (the Golan Heights). This set off a war called the Yom Kippur War or the October War. A UN-sponsored cease-fire took effect later that month. In January 1974 Egypt and Israel signed an agreement that returned to Egypt a strip of land east of the Suez Canal. The canal was reopened in 1975. Sadat emerged from the war with greatly enhanced prestige as the first Arab leader to have actually retaken some territory from Israel. This allowed him to pronounce the war an Egyptian victory and to seek an honorable peace with Israel.\n\nAfter the war, Sadat worked to establish better relations with Israel. In 1977 he became the first Arab head of state to visit Israel. As a result of the Camp David agreements, moderated by U.S. President Jimmy Carter, Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979. It provided for a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from Sinai. As talks about self-rule for Palestine continued, Egypt and Israel established diplomatic relations. In response, the Arab League suspended Egypt, which had once dominated the organization. Most of its member countries withdrew economic aid from Egypt.\n\nMubarak Regime\n\nSadat was assassinated by Muslim extremists in October 1981. Vice President Hosni Mubarak became president. In 1984 Egypt withdrew from its 1971 confederation with Syria and Libya. Despite the country’s economic difficulties, Mubarak was elected to a second term as president in 1987. He was reelected in 1993 and 1999.\n\nAt first Mubarak enjoyed widespread popular support, and political opposition to his government was minimal. He maintained Egypt’s commitment to peace with Israel while also gradually improving its relationships with other Arab states. Egypt rejoined the Arab League in 1989. In 1991 Mubarak introduced a program of economic reform and privatization—allowing private companies to own and run industries that had been owned and run by the government. These changes helped Egypt make notable economic gains, but progress stalled in the late 1990s.\n\nA major concern for the government beginning in the mid-1990s was a campaign of terrorism by militant Muslim groups. Among other incidents, Muslim extremists attempted to assassinate Mubarak in 1995 and killed some 60 tourists in Luxor in 1997. Mubarak’s government worked to improve security throughout the country to bring a halt to terrorist acts.\n\nAlthough Mubarak was reelected in 2005, opposition candidates had contested the election. Internal tensions grew as the Mubarak regime arrested opposition leaders and restricted political expression. Widespread irregularities were observed in the legislative elections of November 2010. On January 25, 2011, protests against the Mubarak regime erupted. Thousands of protesters gathered in Cairo, chanting slogans against corruption, political repression, and poverty. Clashes grew heated, resulting in mass arrests, injuries, and a few deaths. Protests erupted in other cities throughout the country, with especially violent clashes taking place in Suez and Alexandria. As the demonstrations progressed, Egypt’s established opposition groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood, increased their participation.\n\nOn January 28 the government began to take emergency measures, including issuing a curfew. Mubarak appeared on state television, announcing that he intended to remain president. However, he stated that he had asked his cabinet to resign immediately. He also pledged to advance social reforms in Egypt. Mubarak appointed a vice president for the first time in his presidency, choosing Omar Suleiman, the director of the powerful Egyptian General Intelligence Service. The protests against Mubarak continued, however. The following day Mubarak said that he would not run in Egypt’s next presidential election, scheduled for September 2011. Thousands of demonstrators continued to gather, and many others engaged in strikes in solidarity with the protesters. On February 11 Suleiman appeared on state television to announce that Mubarak had stepped down as president. The country would be governed by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, composed of Egypt’s highest-ranking military officers. The announcement was met with great joy by the crowds of protesters in Cairo.\n\nThe toppling of the Mubarak regime in Egypt was one of a series of pro-democracy protests that took place in the Middle East and North Africa in 2010 and 2011. The protests became known as the Arab Spring.\n\nTransition to an Elected Government\n\nThe transition to an elected government was not easy. Large protests continued to break out. After demonstrators demanded that ministers from the Mubarak era resign, a new interim cabinet was appointed. Protest leaders questioned the military’s commitment to democratic change. They charged that the army, eager to reestablish order, had begun adopting the repressive tactics of the former regime. Army troops repeatedly used force to clear protest sites, often beating and arresting demonstrators.\n\nIn late 2011 Egypt held its first elections of the post-Mubarak era. The elections were dominated by Egypt’s Islamist groups, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party. In June 2012, however, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces took steps to retain power and prevent Islamists from gaining control of the government. The Supreme Constitutional Court unexpectedly invalidated the results of the legislative elections, forcing the dissolution of the Islamist-dominated People’s Assembly. In June 2012 Mohammed Morsi, the head of the Freedom and Justice Party, was elected president of Egypt.\n\nThe process of writing a new constitution became the focus of bitter contention between the Islamists and a loose opposition. The opposition included liberal, secular, and Christian factions. The Islamists dominated the Constituent Assembly, which was formed to draft the constitution. The opposition staged walkouts and filed lawsuits challenging the legality of the assembly. In November 2012 President Morsi issued an edict exempting himself from judicial oversight and removing the courts’ power to dissolve the assembly. Mass demonstrations were held against what many saw as the president’s seizure of dictatorial powers. Later in November the Constituent Assembly approved a draft constitution without the input of boycotting Christian and secularist members. Crowds demanding Morsi’s ouster gathered at the presidential palace. As protests continued in early December, Morsi reversed parts of his edict. However, he retained the part preventing the courts from dissolving the Constituent Assembly. A referendum on the constitution was held in December 2012, and the new constitution was approved.\n\nSporadic violent protests against Morsi’s rule continued into 2013. In the middle of the year, calls for Morsi’s resignation increased. They were led by a loose coalition that included liberals, religious minorities, and Egyptians angered by high rates of unemployment and inflation. Massive anti-Morsi protests were held around the country on June 30, the first anniversary of his inauguration. More than a dozen people were killed, and many more were injured.\n\nOn July 1 the head of the Egyptian armed forces, General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, declared that the military would intervene to prevent chaos in the country if the two sides were unable to resolve their differences within two days. Morsi offered to negotiate with the opposition but refused to step down. The protests continued. On July 3 the Egyptian military suspended the constitution and removed Morsi from power. It created a new interim administration led by the head of the Supreme Constitutional Court, Adly Mansour. Sisi, however, continued to hold ultimate authority. A number of the Muslim Brotherhood’s leaders, including Morsi, were placed under arrest.\n\nEnraged members of the Muslim Brotherhood held demonstrations around the country to protest Morsi’s removal from office. Twice in July 2013, Egyptian security forces opened fire on Morsi supporters, killing and wounding many protesters. The following month security forces broke up Muslim Brotherhood sit-ins in Cairo. They killed more than 1,000 people while descending on protesters’ encampments. In the aftermath of the attack, Egyptian authorities declared a state of emergency. The government formally dissolved the Muslim Brotherhood in September 2013. Accused Muslim Brotherhood supporters were rounded up and convicted in mass trials for a variety of crimes allegedly committed during the protests following Morsi’s removal. During the spring of 2014, death sentences were passed against hundreds of accused members of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nMeanwhile, the interim administration had appointed a committee to amend the constitution. Few Islamists served on the committee. Unsurprisingly, the committee removed or weakened many of the provisions favored by Islamists in the 2012 constitution. It also strengthened language shielding the military and the police from civilian oversight. The amended text passed with more than 98 percent of the vote in a referendum in January 2014.\n\nSisi Regime\n\nIn the presidential election of May 2014, Sisi won an overwhelming victory. He had campaigned on promises to reduce poverty and to continue suppressing the Muslim Brotherhood. Sisi’s presidency marked the return to the authoritarian style of government that Egypt had experienced under Mubarak. Under Sisi’s leadership, the Egyptian security services cracked down on all forms of dissent, or opposition. They detained and tortured thousands of people they saw as political opponents. A new House of Representatives was elected in 2015. However, many observers believed that the government had interfered in the elections in favor of pro-Sisi candidates. The House of Representatives soon passed many laws restricting political activity. New laws also established government control over protests, the media, and nongovernmental organizations.\n\nAs president, Sisi struggled to deliver the economic stability and security that he had promised as a candidate. Egypt undertook large public works projects, such as a major expansion of the Suez Canal. Although such projects were popular, they did little to improve living standards. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave Egypt a three-year $12 billion loan package in 2016. This helped the country close its budget deficits. However, as part of the package, Egypt was required to raise taxes and cut government spending. That led to growing levels of inflation.\n\nMeanwhile, the Egyptian military battled Islamic militants around the country. Fighting was especially fierce in the Sinai Peninsula. The peninsula had long been the site of an uprising against the Egyptian government. Militant attacks grew more frequent after a group in Sinai pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in 2014.\n\nIn March 2018 Sisi ran for reelection as president. However, the election served more as confirmation of Sisi’s status as an all-powerful president than as a real democratic contest. In the months leading up to the election, several candidates were arrested or disqualified for procedural reasons. That left Sisi to face only one opponent, a little-known candidate who had himself been an outspoken supporter of Sisi’s. As expected, Sisi won an overwhelming victory. He received more than 97 percent of the vote.\n\nIn April 2019 the parliament overwhelmingly approved a set of constitutional amendments. The amendments would empower the presidency and further entrench the military in policy making. One amendment extended the presidential term to six years but reaffirmed a limit of two consecutive terms. However, another amendment specified that Sisi, who was already in his second term, could run for another six-year term in 2024. The amendments reinstituted a vice presidency and an upper chamber in the legislature, with one-third of its members appointed by the president. An amendment also allowed the president to appoint top judges in the judiciary. The defense minister, meanwhile, was made subject to the approval of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. The amendments were put to a nationwide referendum only days after passing the legislature. They were approved by 89 percent of the voters."
