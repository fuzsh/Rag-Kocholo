You can sit at the breakfast table, or in front of the fireplace, and easily imagine you are a client waiting for Holmes to emerge from an adjacent room. Or you can explore that adjacent room yourself, and perhaps discover the secret entrance into the other wonder of the Dobrys' basement: the vast subterranean warehouse filled with thousands of Doylean and Sherlockian books, periodicals, and ephemera of every sort, all for sale at bargain prices, with all proceeds going to the BSI Trust. (Don't worry, if you don't find the secret entrance, you can use the other, more conventional, passage into the warehouse.) This 221B is a must-see for all enthusiasts, and the warehouse is a must-shop. And the best time to visit is coming up. On September 30, the Dobrys will be hosting an all-day (\"from 10:00 am until everyone is gone,\" says Denny) book fair and open house. We hope to see you there! For more information, email Denny at dendobry@ptd.net.\n\n\"A Common Newsletter\" Is in the Mail â¦\n\nwith Some Humorous Handwriting\n\nAugust 14, 2023 â Volume 3, number 2 of our newsletter has entered the postal system.

These films were produced by Mark Jones under extraordinarily difficult technical conditions, which makes some features (for example, the slow-motion close-ups of the end of each race) even more impressive. We have still pictures as well, including (above) one of David MacGregor receiving his Doylean Honors award for Excellence in the Performing Arts from selection committee chair Monica Schmidt (photo by Louise Krull) and another (below) of Wessex Cup champion Derrick Belanger receiving the Wessex Cup from equine outfitter extraordinaire Peggy MacFarlane (photo by Christopher Zordan).\n\n2023 Membership Card\n\nby Regina Stinson\n\nJanuary 17, 2023 â When you join the ACD Society for 2023 (look to your left for instructions), you will receive an unorthodox and excellent membership card. It is a bit taller than a conventional card, and it is perforated. These features will enable you to wear with pride (as Gerard surely did) and amusement (as ACD surely intended) the handsome medal Napoleon presented to Brigadier Gerard (as brilliantly interpreted by Regina Stinson), along with a few suitably Napoleonic words: \"You will see ... that Brigadier Gerard has the special medal of honour, for I believe that if he has the thickest head he has also the stoutest heart in my army.\" Emperor Napoleon, speaking the last lines in The Medal of Brigadier Gerard (The Strand Magazine, December 1894). Cards will be mailed to current members later this week.\n\nThe Envelope, Please . . .\n\nJanuary 5, 2023 â It is with pleasure, pride, and great respect that we announce our 2023 Doylean Honorees.\n\nFor Lifetime Service:\n\nâ¢ Owen Dudley Edwards\n\nFor excellence in the \"Fiction and Poetry\" category:\n\nâ¢ Margie Deck for \"Whitneyâs Reflection\" in Steel True, Blade Straight (Belanger Books)\n\nâ¢ Paul Hiscock for âThe Ascentâ in Steel True, Blade Straight (Belanger Books)\n\nâ¢ David Marcum for âThe Unintended Offensesâ in Steel True, Blade Straight (Belanger Books)\n\nFor excellence in the \"Performing and Visual Arts\" category:\n\nâ¢ Jessie Amaolo for Virtual Tour of A Study in Sherlock & His Creator (Toronto Public Library)\n\nâ¢ David MacGregor for Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of the Ghost in the Machine (Purple Rose Theater Company)\n\nâ¢ Frank Cho for illustrations in Bonnie MacBirdâs What Child is This?: A Sherlock Holmes Christmas Adventure (HarperCollins)\n\nFor excellence in the \"Scholarly Writing\" category:\n\nâ¢ Shrabani Basu her book, The Mystery of the Parsee Lawyer: Arthur Conan Doyle, George Edalji and the Case of the Foreigner in the English Village (Bloomsbury)\n\nâ¢ Richard Fallon for âRediscovering Lost Worlds: Arthur Conan Doyle and the Modern Romance of Palaeontologyâ in his book Reimagining Dinosaurs in Late Victorian and Edwardian Literature (Cambridge University Press)\n\nâ¢ Brian McCuskey for âTheory and Preaching, 1887-1930â in his book, How Sherlock Pulled the Trick: Spiritualism and the Pseudoscientific Method (Penn State University Press)\n\nCongratulations to all!
