As such, it has become a by-word for the assumption of various, often contradictory habits of thought, belief, behaviour and perceptions. Victorian studies and studies in nineteenth-century literature and culture have, from their institutional inception, questioned narrowness of presumption, pushed at the limits of the nominal definition, and have sought to question the very grounds on which the unreflective perception of the socalled Victorian has been built; and so they continue to do. Victorian and nineteenth-century studies of literature and culture maintain a breadth and diversity of interest, of focus and inquiry, in an interrogative and intellectually open-minded and challenging manner, which are equal to the exploration and inquisitiveness of its subjects. Many of the questions asked by scholars and researchers of the innumerable productions of nineteenth-century society actively put into suspension the clichés and stereotypes of ‘Victorianism’, whether the approach has been sustained by historical, scientific, philosophical, empirical, ideological or theoretical concerns; indeed, it would be incorrect to assume that each of these approaches to the idea of the Victorian has been, or has remained, in the main exclusive, sealed off from the interests and engagements of other approaches. A vital interdisciplinarity has been pursued and embraced, for the most part, even as there has been contest and debate amongst Victorianists, pursued with as much fervour as the affirmative exploration between different disciplines and differing epistemologies put to work in the service of reading the nineteenth century. Edinburgh Critical Studies in Victorian Culture aims to take up both the debates and the inventive approaches and departures from convention that studies in the nineteenth century have witnessed for\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd vii\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\nviii\n\nSeries Editor’s Preface\n\nthe last half century at least. Aiming to maintain a ‘Victorian’ (in the most positive sense of that motif) spirit of inquiry, the series’ purpose is to continue and augment the cross-fertilisation of interdisciplinary approaches, and to offer, in addition, a number of timely and untimely revisions of Victorian literature, culture, history and identity. At the same time, the series will ask questions concerning what has been missed or improperly received, misread, or not read at all, in order to present a multi-faceted and heterogeneous kaleidoscope of representations. Drawing on the most provocative, thoughtful and original research, the series will seek to prod at the notion of the ‘Victorian’, and in so doing, principally through theoretically and epistemologically sophisticated close readings of the historicity of literature and culture in the nineteenth century, to offer the reader provocative insights into a world that is at once overly familiar, and irreducibly different, other and strange. Working from original sources, primary documents and recent interdisciplinary theoretical models, Edinburgh Critical Studies in Victorian Culture seeks not simply to push at the boundaries of research in the nineteenth century, but also to inaugurate the persistent erasure and provisional, strategic redrawing of those borders.

They were not newspaper bills but advertisements of the Strand Magazine.1 [1949] The number of monthly magazines that have existed is legion, but only a few have left more than a fleeting memory. Among those few [is] the Strand magazine, which owing to the economic difficulties of the time is to cease publication . . . the Strand was a popular influence of great importance in that lively period of English story-telling, both short and long, which reached its height in the nineties. Within six months the Sherlock Holmes short stories had begun to appear in the new magazine and from that date until his death Conan Doyle never wrote a Holmes story for any other paper.2\n\nThe lives of Arthur Conan Doyle and the Strand Magazine were so entwined that the majority of notices marking their respective deaths, twenty years apart, seemed incapable of referring to one without the other. This book offers a reading of the magazine and its most famous author through the lens of their relationship and the footprints that they left elsewhere upon British culture. Ultimately, it will argue that the interdependence of Conan Doyle and the Strand’s reputations was not an arbitrary occurrence, but instead the symptom of a series of shifts in the production and consumption of popular culture. The story of their relationship can illuminate these changes and further explain how author and publication sought to shepherd a determinedly Victorian audience through the turbulence of the early twentieth century. Reading a single, middlebrow magazine like the Strand over this period affords the opportunity to observe a series\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 1\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\n2\n\nTwentieth-Century Victorian\n\nof slow transformations in literary form, ideology, cultural attitudes and social values. Away from the white heat of artistic innovation, we can discover how a generation of Victorians acclimatised to the altered realities of the twentieth century. Beyond Sherlock Holmes, the Strand has survived in the popular imagination as, in the words of Mike Ashley, a ‘pot-pourri of humaninterest snippets, fairly useless knowledge and fiction aimed at lowermiddle class and “aspiring” working-class readers’.3 The attractions of this caricature are clear. If the magazine was constituted of fiction surrounded by ‘snippets’ and ‘useless information’, then literary history can helpfully discard most of the magazine’s non-fiction content when weighing its legacy. In practice, it can also disregard much of its fiction barring the odd exceptional figures such as Conan Doyle, P. G. Wodehouse or H. G. Wells. Yet the Strand between 1891 and 1930 was, in many ways, a single text guided by the same editorial hands and often written explicitly for long-term readers. As such, the meaning of isolated stories and serials was always contingent upon this massive drift of other writing. When we fall into the habit of thinking about stories and novels as distinct from their periodical origins, we can deracinate them and efface their identities while at the same time glossing over the significance of the periodicals themselves. It is necessary to disentangle the Strand both from its caricature in much existing scholarship as well as from the enticing allure of its more famous writers. While the inclusion of a Sherlock Holmes story could increase circulation by hundreds of thousands of copies, regular Strand readers bought the magazine every month, often without that attraction. To account for the success of the magazine solely through Conan Doyle or Sherlock Holmes and to equate their two popularities would be to give a false impression of the magazine’s own life, voice and influences. Rather than allow the work of one or two enduringly popular writers to stand in for the magazine as a whole, the magazine context can instead throw new light on their well-known texts as well as recovering many other stories and articles that have been simply forgotten. This emphasis upon periodical publishing over book publishing is essential because Conan Doyle belonged to a generation of writers whose early careers depended upon the rise of popular fiction magazines. Their art was shaped by the constant demand from magazines and the public at large for articles and stories. We can see this is in simplistic terms when, for example, H. G. Wells confessed that The Time Machine was only written to fill a ‘lean month’ when all his usual periodicals were backed up with ‘unused articles’.4 We can also\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 2\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nthink in more general terms about the ways in which short story writing was incentivised and how financial rewards became keyed to particular kinds of writerly effects. The single volumes containing Doyle’s collected stories such as Mysteries and Adventures or Round the Red Lamp would tell you significantly less about his early career than three months of the Strand’s content.5 This would be more helpful, not just in contributing to a more detailed view of the way in which such fiction was commissioned and published but also because it would establish a clearer relationship between fiction and nonfiction. There are many cases outlined throughout this book where this relationship is shown to be symbiotic and indivisible. The vast majority of Doyle’s work was read first in magazine form; this was true of his most half-baked short stories as well as of many of his mature historical novels like The White Company and Sir Nigel.6 By repatriating these works to their original form of publication, they can be re-imagined as incidental or transitory parts of a much larger cultural assemblage. In doing this one can also rediscover the huge body of reaction, comment and criticism that appeared in other periodicals. This reaction formed part of a crucial, first-response dialogue that is also often effaced from Conan Doyle criticism. Even in the most compelling recent critical assessments of Doyle, Catherine Wynne’s The Colonial Conan Doyle and Douglas Kerr’s Conan Doyle: Writing, Profession, and Practice, we find the Strand referred to in incidental flurries and generally only as a passive venue of publication. These omissions are entirely understandable but they underline the extent to which traditional approaches to criticism marginalise the potentially disruptive periodical ferment. Even dipping a trepidatious toe into the water threatens to decentre the author-hero and pollute the clarity of their productions with meaner textual matter. Accordingly, this book tries to balance the two impulses by holding the two career arcs of author and magazine alongside each other and tracing their fluctuations. Unsurprisingly, this approach brings its own problems. After choosing to focus on the Strand as an object of study, one might wonder whether one publication can justify this level of sustained scrutiny. In the last two decades periodical studies has, with notable exceptions like Catherine Waters’ Commodity Culture in Dickens’ Household Words, taken huge strides towards critiquing the preoccupation with studying single titles. The explosion of online databases of nineteenthcentury periodicals together with an increasing inclination towards poststructuralist notions of intertextuality and textual heterogeneity have meant that criticism has focused discussion on issues, debates,\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 3\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\n4\n\nTwentieth-Century Victorian\n\nfigures or ideas rather than single titles. James Mussell argues that taking note of any age’s periodicals ‘pluralizes the cast of actors, events and narratives through which we approach’ it.7 This has allowed critics and historians to move across the barriers between individual titles and track developing discourses not just over time on the pages of one publication, but simultaneously in many publications at once. The most striking examples of this work have come grown out of the Science in the Nineteenth-Century Periodical (SciPer) index and its resultant publications. The chapters in Science in the NineteenthCentury Periodical and Science Serialized display a startling agility in this regard. In Bernard Lightman’s work on John Tyndall’s materialism, for example, he maps the spread of particular ideas or images as they moved from public lectures, through serious journals, daily newspapers and through to caricatures in the popular comic press.8 With samples of so many periodical publications so tantalisingly accessible in digital form, it can seem positively disingenuous to purposely de-prioritise their broad vistas. This model, however, is better suited to the labours of intellectual history, where the periodical press is an invaluable record of public debate, than it can be to cultural history. Authors, magazines and publishers were engaged in conversations with their readers that evolved through time. As a result, a diachronic model of inquiry makes considerably more sense than a synchronic one. This is especially important given the ways in which the Strand has become a kind of shorthand for ‘Victorian’ taste, attitudes and habits of mind. This impression was clearly conveyed by the press coverage of its demise. Its passing, for example, shook the Spectator’s ‘belief in the stability of any human institution’ even though the magazine ‘belong[ed] essentially to the past’.9 How and why did this unilateral ‘Victorianisation’ of the Strand happen? According to Michael Wolff, periodicals represented no less than ‘the closest verbal and graphic equivalent which we have of Victorian urbanism’ and the Strand made this manifest.10 It situated its readers within a particular image of late Victorian London. Its cover image of the crowded city thoroughfare combined with its cultivation of a commuter-based distribution network to immerse its readers in a particular time and place. ‘To read the Strand itself’, writes Christopher Pittard, ‘was also to experience the city’.11 It was perhaps for this reason that the Strand became fused in the generational imagination with Conan Doyle, with Sherlock Holmes and with an overarching aura of ‘the Victorian’. This resulted in some strange cultural blurring between the magazine, the author and the character. One symptom of this phenomenon was that large numbers of interchangeable fan\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 4\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nletters addressed to ‘Sherlock Holmes’ would be sent to the Strand offices, to Conan Doyle’s house and to Baker Street itself.12 It is important to note that, while this blurring is often intriguing, it became increasingly ahistorical and unrepresentative of the Strand as a whole by cleaving to the timeframe of the Holmes stories. Despite being produced more or less regularly until 1930, no Sherlock Holmes story was set later than ‘His Last Bow’ in 1914 and only the occasional late oddity such as ‘The Lion’s Mane’ was set after 1903.13 Thus the stories continued to be placed against an increasingly ersatz, never-ending Victorian backdrop; the milieu known by Holmesian obsessives as ‘forever 1895’. This had the effect of relentlessly bludgeoning a particular periodisation on to perceptions of the Strand as a whole. As a consequence, it is seldom seen as belonging to the twentieth century in any meaningful way despite spending only a single decade of its sixty years under the reign of Victoria (although she was also one of its more esteemed contributors).14 The fact that the Strand had the temerity to run long into the twentieth century can disturb a sense of orderly historicity. Its Victorian readers became its Edwardian readers; they weathered at least one world war and saw the world around them change beyond all recognition. All this upheaval found its way into the magazine’s form and content, yet did so in rather unspectacular ways. Unlike its near relation, the Review of Reviews, the Strand was too middlebrow and had too rigorous a sense of decorum to become seriously involved in many of the heated debates which the openness and scale of the periodical form seemed to encourage. Even when its authors sought to join the debate on, for example, Home Rule or Tariff reform, they were generally sure to do so away from the Strand. We can see this particularly with Conan Doyle and H. G. Wells, who published letters and essays on an astonishing variety of issues in other publications, more often, albeit with notable exceptions, leaving the Strand as a place for fiction. The magazine in fact can seem to enjoy a rather smug elevation beyond the rest of the periodical field, which, in commercial terms, it came to dominate and redefine. The canon of Strand criticism that presents itself to the initiate is not substantial. Kate Jackson’s work has been hugely influential, especially the 2001 monograph George Newnes and the New Journalism in Britain, 1880–1910. The work is a meticulously researched business and cultural history of the publisher George Newnes whose firm also produced Tit-Bits, the Westminster Gazette, the Ladies Field and the Captain. Each of these publications is accorded a chapter as part of Jackson’s materialist account of diversification and popularisation in\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 5\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\n6\n\nTwentieth-Century Victorian\n\nthe periodical field after 1880. She views periodicals principally as culturally embedded products which can unveil the deep tensions between culture and profit in the period. She attempts to answer . . . the challenge posed by recent work in cultural studies and literary criticism concerning the relationship between the industrial production of cultural forms and the consumption or reception of those forms . . . The periodical . . . is a product of negotiation and interaction between editor-proprietor and audience, and is as much context as text.15\n\nThis collapsed distinction between ‘text’ and ‘context’, as well as Jackson’s somewhat arduous theoretical legwork on the construction of reading communities, fed directly into subsequent articles by Pittard on the Strand’s precisely middlebrow ‘purity’, Ruth Hoberman on the ‘auratic’ properties of middle-class commodities and Winnie Chan’s chapter on the magazine in her study of the late-century short story.16 James Mussell’s Science, Time and Space in the Late Nineteenth-Century Periodical Press contained a brief chapter on the magazine’s depictions of science and detective fiction and, more pertinently, Peter McDonald artfully examined the role of Conan Doyle’s agent A. P. Watt in the wave of professionalisation brought about by magazines like the Strand. He also made special reference to the collaborative dialogue between author, editor and agent in the production of the Return of Sherlock Holmes series.17 The more recent Revolutions from Grub Street helpfully locates the Strand within twentieth- and twenty-first-century developments in popular media but is rather light on the Strand itself, still relying on Jackson’s basic premises and reiterating her conclusions about George Newnes’s role in its success.18 Elsewhere, the magazine makes frequent, fleeting appearances in discussions of the art of magazine illustration, through its relation to the emergence of the linked series of short stories, studies of transAtlantic cultural influence, as a cultural prop to the politics of new imperialism or as the inconsequential backdrop to much Sherlock Holmes criticism. Few of these critics pay serious attention to the vast swathes of material that appeared alongside the stories in the Strand, and fewer still entertain the idea that their meaning could be modified by it. It is also noticeable that no serious analysis of the Strand extends beyond the length of a detailed chapter or journal article. Indeed, the only book on the subject was the instructive but hagiographic memoir of Reginald Pound who edited the Strand between 1942 and 1946. While this book is highly readable, it made\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 6\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nsparing use of a huge archive of priceless materials which were subsequently lost or destroyed. One more thing unites these disparate bodies of writing: a clear disinclination to discuss anything to do with the Strand much after 1901 when its cultural validity is presumed to have expired. The various electronic booms that have energised periodical studies are often similarly confined within Victorian or ‘nineteenth-century’ brackets. In turn this reinforces the strong connection between periodical studies and Victorian Studies from which it speciated in the work of Walter Houghton in the 1960s.19 Part of what makes the Strand’s lifespan so striking is that its cultural entrenchment and resistance to change coincided with a far greater longevity than the livelier, more protean illustrated monthly magazines that followed in its wake. Why did it come to exert so distinct and persistent a hold over so many opinion formers from Queen Victoria to Winston Churchill, with a rotating cast of judges, politicians, actors, clergymen, businessmen and scientists in between? Generations of writers and commentators accorded the Strand a privileged status as a metonym for an age and a specific cultural moment. So, if this book accords the Strand a position of privilege by isolating it as an object of study, this only reflects the unusual status granted it as part of its peculiar legacy. In acknowledging this fact, we must also be sceptical; the Strand was not kept afloat for sixty years by the custom of barristers and barons. It endured because it suited itself to the tastes of ordinary readers throughout a long period of extraordinary change. It surfed the wave of the monthly illustrated magazine revolution in the 1880s and 1890s and endured through the rise of the paperback, the gramophone, cinema and a hundred other microclimatic shifts in the production of popular culture. As such, it serves as a priceless record of the durability and adaptability of the British middlebrow sensibility.\n\nThe Twentieth-Century Conan Doyle Like the Strand, Arthur Conan Doyle suffers from a predisposition to be viewed principally as a Victorian writer. Even when his later works are considered, they are usually identified as outlying iterations of nineteenth-century forms. The early Challenger narratives, for example, are either late-appearing quest romances like The Lost World or, in the case of The Poison Belt, variations upon the 1890’s Wellsian scientific romances.20 His obituaries in 1930 solidified this impression: the Daily Mail compared him favourably to his ‘more eminent Victorian contemporaries’.21 Elsewhere, in a\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 7\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\n8\n\nTwentieth-Century Victorian\n\nthoughtful retrospective piece, the Bookman reflected that Conan Doyle and the Strand ‘typified’ the ‘English renaissance’ of the 1890s more than W. E. Henley’s ‘jingoistic’ National Observer or the ‘languishing aesthetics’ of Oscar Wilde and the Yellow Book. So strong was this impression that a ‘mental shock’ attended his ‘startling excursion[s] into the twentieth century’.22 This caricature was exacerbated by Conan Doyle’s turn towards public advocacy of spiritualism after the First World War. The perceived eccentricity of these efforts allowed him to be painted as the archetypal ‘Victorian out of water’, confusedly floundering at the changed cultural climate and suffering the curse of the writer doomed to outlive his usefulness and popularity. The Daily Mail’s obituary observed that ‘after the war, for various reasons, spiritualism claimed Sir Arthur . . . it became a rather credulous obsession’.23 It is thus easy to imagine both author and magazine running aground in the twentieth century, outflanked by a new generation of modernists and innovators who had little time or respect for these particularly eminent Victorians. This narrative is not only faintly insulting, it also uses hindsight to grant too much epistemological supremacy to the kind of fiction that most commonly features on university curricula and in recent popular imagination. The recovery and revaluation of popular fiction has formed a crucial part of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literary studies for many years, but the modernist stranglehold on the 1910s and 1920s has proved more difficult to break down. One can easily find entire critical discourses devoted to amatory fiction, the Gothic and sensation fiction which treat their subjects free from the gravitational pull of their ‘high’ art counterparts. Criticism treating the early twentieth century, however, habitually views popular fiction through the lens of modernism.24 Only in the very recent surge of interest in theorisations of the ‘middlebrow’ can we see genuine attempts to deal with this fiction on its own terms. Even here the focus is understandably on emerging authors and trends rather than formerly famous authors who were still working. Conan Doyle’s prescriptions for dealing with the early crises of the twentieth century may not have proved historically durable but they were certainly coherent, rooted in many important contemporaneous debates and, intermittently, very popular. This book focuses most of its energy upon the later output of author and magazine not just because they are under-discussed and often misunderstood, but also because they allow for necessary reformulations of the literary and cultural fields of the period. Our sense of what might constitute discrete streams of ‘modernist’, ‘popular’, ‘middlebrow’ or ‘lowbrow’ fiction is utterly compromised when reading fiction in the\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 8\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nperiodical press. Between 1910 and 1920, the Strand featured writing by Conan Doyle, Joseph Conrad, D. H. Lawrence, F. Britten Austin, Arnold Bennett, Sarah Grand, George Egerton, Rudyard Kipling, W. W. Jacobs, P. G. Wodehouse and hundreds of others dotted all over the cultural map of the period. In practice, they were not always accorded equal prestige; Grand and Egerton were generally confined to short symposium contributions, yet their names and views are indisputably part of the same continuous text. Not only was this the case within individual titles but in many authors’ promiscuous cross-publication between different titles. As a result, it is necessary to perform a little spadework with some important literary and historical terminology to establish a framework for viewing Conan Doyle’s later work. If we wish to disentangle him from his ‘Victorian’ mantle then it is useful to ask a series of contextual questions that relate to the period’s wider literary marketplace, the growth of mass culture, the rise of new entertainment media and the emergence of globalised American cultural power through its film and music exports. Recent developments in the fields of ‘popular’ modernism, ‘low’ modernism or ‘vulgar’ modernism initially appear helpful. The term ‘popular modernism’ has been most influentially deployed by Nicholas Daly who effectively argued for viewing the artefacts of elite and popular culture as bifurcated symptoms of the same, shared condition. Individual works may be distinct in the sense that one can recognise obvious differences between, say, D. H. Lawrence and P. G. Wodehouse or between Ezra Pound and John Masefield, but their family resemblances are marked rather than negligible. Daly sees them as ‘siblings’ rather than the daring nephew to the ‘decrepit great uncle’.25 Meanwhile, the term ‘low’ modernism was most prominently theorised by Rachel Potter’s argument for the aesthetic legitimacy of modernism’s most base cultural constituents. She argued that part of ‘Anglo-American’ modernism’s artistic achievement was its ability to fuse the rarefied traditions of naturalism and symbolism with materials habitually associated with low culture: ‘obscene bodies, animals and objects; masturbation, shit and piss’.26 Modernism’s prestige was thus built atop a healthy and mutually informed relationship with lots of other discourses whose critical reputations are negligible by comparison. J. Hoberman’s Vulgar Modernism took the opposite approach by tracing the ‘vulgar equivalents’ of modernism within the American mainstream culture industry.27 Instead of tracking vulgar strains within modernism, he explored the ways in which popular culture anticipated and drove developments in elite art. By this logic, Tex Avery becomes the equivalent of Manet while Buster Keaton’s\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 9\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\n10\n\nTwentieth-Century Victorian\n\ncomedies predict the experiments of Eisenstein. Any perceived binary ‘divide’ is, in fact, a subtly distorted mirroring. These projects use wildly different methodologies, yet their aims are comparable, each seeking to redistribute some of ‘high’ modernism’s cultural prestige to less exalted cultural products. This has historically proved difficult because a deep-lying set of value judgements was installed in the academy by the incorporation of ‘the classics of high modernism . . . [into] the so-called canon’ during the rise of English as a university subject.28 Fredric Jameson’s argument was that the ‘canonised’ modernists overcame their own contemporaneous denigration and, in the process, infected subsequent criticism with an over-exaggerated misreading of their high-minded disregard for the popular, the bourgeois and the middlebrow. As a result, subsequent generations of critics and scholars have struggled to overcome the lingering sense of an inferiority complex when entering these fields. Similarly, it has led to a diminished will to investigate popular work from the early twentieth century, particularly when produced by erstwhile Victorian writers. Daly, Potter and Hoberman channel some of the righteous fury of past critics who had sought to rehabilitate works of popular writing from, at best, ghettoisation or, at worst, consignment to what Franco Moretti called the ‘slaughterhouse of literature’.29 In attempting to untangle the theoretical congestion in this area, it becomes clear how much confusion has resulted from attempts to distil or filter culture into different streams. Conceptualisations of the ‘popular’, the ‘low’, the ‘mass’ and the ‘vulgar’ became entangled and effaced the real diversity of the early twentieth-century’s cultural moments. When working through the periods in this book, it becomes possible to see where and how these boundaries were consciously processed and where, by contrast, they were post facto impositions. To the aesthete, what is ‘popular’ might also be what is ‘low’ but to the popular writer, ‘low’ may well be something pornographic or vulgar (indeed, it may even be the opposite of popular). These are parallax terms, depending entirely on the position of the speaker. ‘Mass’ culture, on the other hand, carries industrial connotations that might render its status as a category within literature less directly relevant than for, say, music or cinema. The ‘mass’ production of culture, as analysed seminally by Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer, maps most effectively on to particular markets within literature such as the Mills and Boon or Beadle and Adams production lines.30 Yet the fiction produced under these regimes has left even less discernible trace in scholarship or criticism than the Strand or its contemporaries.\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 10\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nNotions of authorial prowess, intellectual prestige and individual genius were pervasive even within popular literature and disrupt the unproblematic deployment of the term. While each definition could be used (with more or less accuracy) to demarcate particular literary microclimates within the early 1900s, this was also the period when, according to Jameson, critical terms were starting to be defined by many of the same modernist writers who were producing the literary texts. After all, it was not just the literary works of the high modernists that were ‘canonised’; it was also a set of critical values and practices as laid out in their non-fiction. In a situation where neither gamekeeper nor poacher, text nor critical category, can be appropriately distinguished, it is better to find the most effective way of collapsing these critical debates into the study of the texts themselves. When working with a writer like Conan Doyle and a periodical like the Strand, this manoeuvre becomes markedly easier because the magazine featured numerous pieces discussing emerging trends in literature, the visual arts, cinema, theatre and music alongside its original works of fiction. The fiction that featured in the Strand was generally published and read with a strong and coherent set of cultural values that were constructed in relation to (we might initially say in opposition to) ‘modernist’ trends. Thus, the only borders and boundaries that need to be critically acknowledged are those that were being consciously processed at the time. While it is necessary to acknowledge later theoretical contortions, they can be respectfully nudged towards the background. This approach mitigates against the anachronistic desire to retrospectively reclassify Conan Doyle as a covert ‘modernist’ or ‘postmodernist’ writer by which one would simply mean ‘he’s a better writer than is commonly thought’ or worse ‘he is more socially and politically engaged than one might imagine’. One can, for example, read any shopping list of ‘modernist’ concerns, easily see them at work within Doyle’s writing and seek to re-christen him. One could seize on Peter Child’s contrast between The Lost World’s ‘mélange of adventure tropes’ and ‘modernist responses to it’ and gleefully show how Doyle was quite capable of satirising and critiquing those concepts himself.31 Yet if we want to ditch arbitrary divisions between cultures, this move seems instead to heartily reaffirm them. Popular texts, under this schema, achieve critical capital only where they mirror the ‘proper’ concerns of the period. This shows a remarkable lack of faith in the texts themselves to speak interestingly and on their own terms about readers whose chosen forms of art were largely unencumbered by formal and stylistic innovation\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 11\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\n12\n\nTwentieth-Century Victorian\n\nbut whose everyday lives were equally affected by the changing times. A comparable case could be made for seeing Conan Doyle and his middlebrow brethren not as fastidious Victorian grumblers but rather as the first wave of guerrilla, postmodernist critique. Andreas Huyssen’s After the Great Divide broadly makes this argument by highlighting the dialogic relationship that existed between modernism and its critiques. From this point of view, those popular writers who directly responded to modernism could be seen as the fathers of postmodernism and thus the true progenitors of late twentiethcentury culture.32 By making this distinction, one can also do away with the simplistic schema whereby postmodernism only occurs after the end of modernism.33 This periodisation harmoniously balances the century’s artistic developments alongside its major historical events and naturally suits the requirements of canon-building and curriculum design. If postmodernism, though, is defined principally as the vehicle for sceptical critiques of modernism (though this is far from the only definition available), then there is no reason for any great gap between the one and the other. They might be more or less simultaneous. Indeed, the benighted ‘divide’ between high and middlebrow culture might just be the misrecognised divide between modernism and postmodernism. By this point, the weary critic might be tempted to angrily conclude that all stratifications between types of writing are social constructions, produced by a remote class of literary technicians whose proclamations are designed to assert their own epistemological supremacy. However, sit any literate person in a library with a random assortment of fiction from the Strand and a collection of stories from the modernist ‘little’ magazines and they could reliably (with a few exceptions) split them into two distinct piles based on evident intrinsic and extrinsic differences. There are instinctual forces at work here that prevent us from abandoning this framework completely and therefore the withered mortmains of ‘modernist’ categorisations past and present cannot be escaped as easily as one might wish. There was much radicalism in popular fiction, but of a creeping, cumulative kind in contrast to the vivid iconoclasm of the Futurists or Vorticists. One can observe the accretion of very small advances or developments in literary form and style alongside slow, geological shifts of long-standing ideology among large groups of people. The importance of fiction in the Strand, and particularly that of Conan Doyle, lies in the fact that, for a large audience over time, multiple texts slowly collected enough revisions and small revelations to gradually unveil a changed world. This is a rather abstract way to\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 12\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\napproach the question of literature’s role in the evolution of social attitudes but, having established this basic framework, the connection between author and periodical publication becomes particularly significant. It is only by observing these slow changes over time that the Strand’s proper legacy can begin to be discerned. The chapters that follow concern themselves with chronological eras in the careers of the Strand and Conan Doyle. Given that so much writing on the Strand has focused on its early years, the first chapter will look at the appearance of the Strand, its reception in other periodicals and the ways in which its success and burgeoning reputation was parlayed into the emergence of the Sherlock Holmes phenomenon. It then establishes the formula for the magazine’s success in its first decade. The second chapter focuses on questions of science and modernity that clustered around the magazine’s coverage of the Boer War, the death of Queen Victoria and the end of the nineteenth century. The third chapter examines the Edwardian years that saw the first real divergence in the relationship between the Strand and Doyle through the troubled resuscitation of Sherlock Holmes. The fourth chapter looks at the role of the Strand and Doyle as propagandists during the First World War, the fifth at Doyle’s attempts to use the Strand as a spiritualist platform in the post-war years and the conclusion reads their shared commercial and artistic decline of the late 1920s against the rise of new forms of popular culture and mass entertainment. The study concludes in 1930, the year of Conan Doyle’s death and the retirement of the Strand’s long-time editor, Herbert Greenhough Smith, both of which events marked the first really decisive break in the magazine’s long history. The remaining twenty years after 1930, however, are also replete with tantalisingly untold stories. It is astonishing to think that the magazine of Sherlock Holmes, Raffles and Jeeves survived long enough to observe and discuss Nazism, the onset of the Cold War and the establishment of the NHS. Yet space and logic precludes essays into this period within the scope of this project.\n\nNotes 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.\n\n‘The Two Conan Doyles’, The Manchester Guardian, 8 July 1930, p. 10. ‘Farewell to the Strand’, The Times, 14 December 1949, p. 5.

T. Stead and the publisher George Newnes, who jointly founded the Review of Reviews in 1889. Their differences were explicitly cultural, centring on the function of journalism and its role within culture. The fallout from their disagreement fed directly into the creation of the Strand and helped to fashion its particular branding and identity. One of these disagreements was prompted by Stead’s desire to serialise Tolstoy’s novel The Kreutzer Sonata. Stead was mocked in the popular press as a treacherous Russophile; Pick-Me-Up observed that he ‘supports Russia, and denounces Great Britain . . . I do not suggest that anyone should nail Mr Stead’s ears to a pump, because it is a pity to spoil pumps.’1 Stead had not read the Kreutzer Sonata but had discussed it in person with the author on his visit to Russia in 1888. He anticipated it as an assault upon the ‘conventional illusion of romantic love’ and the institution of marriage.2 In contrast to Newnes, Stead’s approach to journalism was famously sensational and confrontational; he cast journalism as the new centre of power at the heart of increasingly literate and democratic states.3 Newnes, conversely, saw his proprietorial publications as a way to build and maintain a comfortable consensus with his readers based upon a reverence for their perceived sensitivities. The short partnership with Stead was legendarily lopsided as a consequence. Newnes was exasperated by the constant threat of ‘damages’ resulting from Stead’s taste for controversial literature, his veneration of spiritualism and, in particular, his attack on The Times for its false accusations against Charles Stewart Parnell in 1887. Stead wrote in the Review that the newspaper’s ‘disastrous campaign of moral assassination’ had left it ‘without prestige’ and mired in ‘catastrophe’.4\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 15\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\n16\n\nTwentieth-Century Victorian\n\nSo strident was this opinion piece, even in its altered final draft, that Newnes feared it landing his partner ‘in Holloway with me in the adjoining cell’. Finding himself discomposed by the whole experience, he sought to end the partnership ‘peacefully’.5 At times in their correspondence Newnes seems unable to decide whether he was bothered more by Stead’s blasphemy, his irreverence, his iconoclasm, his slander or his salaciousness. Upon the termination of their partnership, he wrote to Stead with a middlebrow mission statement set directly against the tenets of Stead’s ‘new’ journalism: There is one kind of journalism which directs the affairs of nations; it makes and unmakes cabinets; it upsets governments . . . It is magnificent . . . There is another kind of journalism which has no such great ambitions. It is content to plod on, year after year, giving wholesome and harmless entertainment to crowds of hardworking people . . . That is my journalism.6\n\nThis ennobling ‘homily’ is recorded in Hulda Friedrichs’s 1911 biography of Newnes. Stead remembered the conversation ending differently, as he wrote in the Review upon Newnes’s death: I remember talking with Sir George one night at his house at Putney Heath, when he remarked: ‘There are two kinds of journalism. There is one which is very magnificent, very powerful . . . and passes Acts of Parliament. That is your kind of journalism . . . There is another kind of journalism, that of Tit-Bits, which does none of those things but which does gather in the shekels.’7\n\nAs Newnes walked away from the Review of Reviews and made his plans for the future he had had quite enough of Stead’s ‘magnificence’. Nevertheless an intertextual relationship would continue between the Review and the Strand through their connection in the minds of reviewers, reciprocal advertising space and in the Review’s generally positive, if condescending, reviews. Stead’s uneasy financial arrangements left him unable to support the Review’s existing staff and, characteristically, Newnes felt obliged to keep the group together, putting them to work almost instantaneously on his new project. The conditions of the Strand’s creation were thus oppositional. The Review was created with excitement and anticipation for the contests and challenges of modernity while the Strand purposefully went into the future with its eyes determinedly focused elsewhere.\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 16\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\nThe Strand at the Beginning\n\n17\n\nThere was a political dimension to these disputes as well as a cultural one. Newnes had initially recruited Stead from the Pall Mall Gazette, a Conservative evening daily that had begun in 1865 but which had switched to the Liberals in 1880 when it was taken over by Henry Yates Thompson. Under Stead’s editorial influence in the 1880s the Gazette became, according to Andrew King, ‘an early proponent of new journalism’ and a natural home for the radical Liberal politics of William Gladstone, whom he often supported.8 Newnes served as the Liberal MP for Newmarket between 1885 and 1895 when he was made a peer. He returned to Parliament in 1900 to represent Swansea Town and served until his death in 1910. A staunch party man, his meagre parliamentary record showed him to represent the more cautious and populist aspects of his party. Like many Liberals of this stripe, he was focused upon the liberating, democratising potential of the market and the aspirational voting bloc of the expanding, professional middle class.9 Stead patronisingly termed him ‘a good Liberal of the old school’.10 In her biography, Friedrichs characterised his political career thus: In the House itself he was generally a silent member, and probably no one seeing him there, cheerful and debonair, if occasionally a little absentminded, when the pressure of his own work was very great, would have guessed that deep down in his heart he was a saddened and disappointed politician . . . He had meant to do such good work for the Liberal cause [but] as the years went by he felt more and more strongly that one man alone could not move the cumbersome parliamentary machine.11\n\nUnderneath this, he was essentially a cultural conservative, pitting himself directly against Stead who represented the much more radical side of the Liberal coalition. Nevertheless, the Gazette’s readers, predominantly from the educated middle class but not part of the intellectual elite, were precisely the ‘common men’ of Newnes’s imagination and he coveted them as potential readers for his new monthly magazine. Instinctively he believed that he could appeal to their tastes much more effectively than Stead had been able to. Their disputes firmly influenced Newnes’s image of an ideal reader: a middle-class family man who was active and anxious for self-improvement but without a taste for anything avant-garde. When plotting the new Strand Magazine, he was thus able to project a benign, largely depoliticised vision of Liberal England, shorn of the vicious infighting and political instabilities that had split the party in the 1880s and would again in the\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 17\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\n18\n\nTwentieth-Century Victorian\n\n1910s. This vision was of an England of striving workers, progressive and benign institutions and individual freedoms at the heart of an ethical empire. The Strand’s first advertisements in November 1890 were specifically targeted in Tit-Bits but also the Pall Mall Gazette where, a small footer politely informed the reader that ‘THE printing of THE STRAND MAGAZINE has now BEGUN and will be continued day and night until publication’.12 This was followed by other modestly phrased and positioned adverts on 26 and 30. These small beginnings might seem inconsequential but they hint at Newnes’s delicate understanding of the cultural and intellectual economies of the periodical marketplace and his ability to gather and coalesce a reading community. Before analysing the content of the early issues, it is instructive to examine how the Strand was reviewed elsewhere in the popular press upon its first appearance. It is strange to survey the reaction to the Strand’s first issue, since almost every recent viewpoint commends its ‘newness’ and ‘innovation’. In contrast to this commonplace observation, the Dublin-based Freeman’s Journal received the magazine with a studied tedium, beginning simply ‘yet another’ before adding that ‘it is not badly got up’. It did, though, specifically condemn the Portraits of Celebrities at Different Times in Their Lives section (featuring Alfred Tennyson, John Lubbock, Henry Irving and H. Rider Haggard among others) as ‘hav[ing] very little interest either for the educated or the hoi polloi. We are already surfeited with the photos of these shop window celebrities.’13 This ennui was understandable; the phenomenon of the illustrated monthly magazine had indeed been in full swing for some years. Golden Hours (1864), London Society (1862) and the Savoy (1865) all ran into the late 1880s and featured some mixture of fiction, current affairs and human interest content. In the 1880s there was a second wave of ‘shilling monthly’ magazines including Art and Letters (1888), the Bookworm (1881) and the market-leading English Illustrated Magazine (1883). The Strand’s principal claims to distinction were the relatively low price of sixpence and a comparatively lavish number of illustrations, diagrams and photographs. In this context, the world-weariness of the Freeman’s Journal makes even more sense. The glorious future of the Strand was, at this point, entirely unpredictable. Of the countless reviews of the Strand’s first number, certain qualities were repeatedly highlighted as being of interest to readers. Portraits of Celebrities was mentioned, as was the high number of\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 18\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\nThe Strand at the Beginning\n\n19\n\nillustrations, the noticeable influence of American magazines, the number of translated stories, the role of Newnes, his association with Tit-Bits and the institutional portraits of the Animal Hospital, the Metropolitan Fire Brigade and the Thames River Police. Its prospects for success were agreed to be fair to moderate. The Birmingham Daily Post asserted that the English Illustrated Magazine ‘ha[d] yet no rival’ despite the Strand aping ‘some of the lighter features of that admirable magazine’ and being, for all its sins, ‘bright’, ‘clever’ and ‘entertaining’.14 The most frequently used word in the reviews was ‘capital’ which seems an appropriately moderate expression of approbation for a solid, if unoriginal venture. These judgements were necessarily revised, however, when the first issue of the Strand sold over 300,000 copies and was elevated to the forefront of the periodical marketplace.15 The Pall Mall Gazette of 6 February contained a huge advertisement that trumpeted the triumph: The phenomenal sale of No. 1 of the STRAND MAGAZINE makes the appearance of No. 2 peculiarly interesting. The sale of No. 1 extended to the hitherto unheard-of total of 350,000. It is an interesting fact that not one single copy has been returned to us from the trade. It is probable that had we been able to print No. 1 fast enough we could have sold half a million.16\n\nKate Jackson suggests that Newnes’s success with the Strand was principally attributable to his ‘established reputation as a publisher’ and his aptitude for ‘promoting his magazine prior to its appearance’.17 In testament to this, adverts almost overlap with positive reviews in the Gazette which opined: Good in many respects as the first number of the Strand Magazine was, the second issue shows a very marked improvement. It is a home-made Harper. The articles are each excellent, and the illustrations are worthy of them.18\n\nThe column then contained a lengthy extract from the symposium article ‘Letters from Artists on Ladies’ Dress’ which ran in the Strand’s first issue. The Strand was widely advertised, well positioned against comparable publications and was able to live up to those expectations in its lavish first edition. It found a harmonious balance between novelty and familiarity, and between luxury and affordability.\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 19\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\n20\n\nTwentieth-Century Victorian\n\nNewnes integrated his magazine with his potential readers’ lives through specifically targeted daily newspapers and by banking upon both his reputation and the reputation of Tit-Bits, which was circulating 600,000 copies a week by the early 1890s.19 He was thus able to broadcast a clear image of his publication to the reading public. The key qualities that the magazine embedded into this campaign were as follows: a middlebrow miscellany blending the high-minded Review of Reviews with the mass appeal of Tit-Bits; high-quality continental fiction; a clear avoidance of anything salacious or sensational; the cultivation of a high-toned sense of ‘celebrity’ focused on public figures as much as on actresses or singers; and, finally, non-fiction pieces which explained modern life and institutions in light-hearted, uncritical prose. Newnes wrote, in relation to his Tit-Bits readership, that ‘they care for things that cheer and make them laugh, and lead them momentarily away from their own more or less drab lives, into an atmosphere of fun and merriment’.20 Greenhough Smith’s curation of the magazine’s fiction was a crucial component of this nascent popularity. He would later explain the Strand’s cultural attitude towards fiction in a diary entry. However irresponsible those early short-story writers of ours seem to our war-tried, more mature generations . . . they did not fashion their plots out of man’s bewilderments and fears; nor did they have any part in the brutal disillusioning process to which many of the new writers put their gifts.21\n\nIn 1921 Smith used his considerable connections to assemble a booklength symposium on modern authorship called What I Think. Contributors included the most famous names in the Strand’s stable: P. G. Wodehouse, W. W. Jacobs, Cyril ‘Sapper’ McNeile, Arthur Conan Doyle, E. Philips Oppenheim, Jerome K. Jerome, Hugh Walpole and George Bernard Shaw among others. In one section they were asked to comment upon ‘the book I shall never write’.22 Ian Hay summed up the ideal middlebrow relationship between author and reader: Your steady reader does not like his oats changed. Once he has decided what you are – a realist, a feminist, or a humorist, or what not – he sees to it that you remain humbly and reverently in that station to which Vox Populi has appointed you . . . If I were to join that frankly morbid school of soul-dissectors and sex-analysts who are enjoying (so far as they are capable of enjoying anything) so great a vogue today, I should be inundated with protests.23\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 20\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\nThe Strand at the Beginning\n\n21\n\nHay, who is now largely forgotten but who was a solidly middlebrow ‘bestseller’ in the 1910s, was simply outlining long-standing Strand editorial policy.24 The Strand’s fiction operated within tight moral and artistic constraints, determinedly defined against the destabilising tendencies of naturalism and early modernism. The Strand’s contents can thus be seen as the result of a three-way pact between the magazine’s editorial staff, its contributors and its readers. The positive response to the first number of the Strand, condescendingly attributed by the Review of Reviews to its colour supplement, ‘so inspirited’ Newnes that he proposed to print a greatly increased number of copies of the second issue.25 The tone was ironic but the relationship it identified was real enough; an ideological pact had been formed between Newnes, his publication and his readers and no party would happily ‘have their oats changed’ for decades to come. In July 1891 Newnes took his publishing company public and declared his intentions, once again in the Pall Mall Gazette: The business consists principally in the publication of the well-known periodicals Tit-Bits and the Strand Magazine. The former was first published in the year 1881, and the circulation is now at the rate of upwards of 550,000 copies per month. Mr Newnes is confident that the business is capable of great development, and he desires to make further provisions for securing the co-operation of those who are able to promote or are interested in such development – viz. Newsagents, booksellers and advertisers. It is this desire which has led to the formation of the company and to the offer now made of a portion of the shares for subscription. Only applications from newsagents, booksellers, bookstall clerks, and advertisers . . . will be considered.26\n\nDescriptions of Newnes’s relationship to his readers often fail to take account of this strategy, which was designed to bind the broader network of advertisers and news-stand owners into the shared community of his success. He understood that the magazine’s initial popularity was precarious and so moved quickly to shore up its foundations by implicating those tradesmen responsible for its sale at street-level into its continued prosperity. This move was the subject of envious sniping from other illustrated publications. Funny Folks, a humorous miscellany, published a satirical column from the illiterate perspective of a newspaper boy: By the way, sir, do you see that the Strand Magazine and Tit-Bits are being turned into an enormous limited liability company, with speshal\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 21\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\n22\n\nTwentieth-Century Victorian fassilities – as shareholders – for the likes of us, who can push their sail? It’s a fact and a ‘cute one too, I call it. Moreover, I’d take some shares like a shot if I had the £ s. D. – speshly the £. I have it not. But not so my boss – he’s got a stocking full of savings somewhere or other, and has taken shares galore. You should see how he’s pushing the July Strand. I hope you won’t sack me sir, when I tell you that I push F. F.27\n\nEven at this early stage, the Strand had become a coveted property on the periodical marketplace, the subject of speculation and interest from those publications that it was outselling. As the subject of reviews, the provider of extracts, anecdotes, reprinted interviews and gossip, the magazine filled the pages of other periodicals both national and local. The ‘Illustrated Interview’ with Cardinal Manning in July 1891, for example, provided anecdotes that were reprinted countless times in the wider press. All of this occurred before the appearance of Sherlock Holmes in the magazine, and so those famous stories cannot claim to have solely precipitated its enduring success. Nevertheless, they certainly raised it from a notable publishing success to a fully fledged cultural phenomenon. After ‘A Scandal in Bohemia’ appeared in July 1891, it took no time for Holmes, Watson and Conan Doyle to be deployed as representative images of the Strand’s identity, a development evidenced by their inseparability in the minds of contemporary reviewers. The Sheffield Independent of 16 July wrote, with considerable foresight, that the stories [in the July Strand] are all sensational and worth reading, especially the detective story entitled ‘A Scandal in Bohemia’. This is not at all the common type of detective story, with which we are getting very familiar . . . Altogether the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes are likely to prove interesting.28\n\nThe stories instantly displaced the parts of the magazine that had traditionally been highlighted by reviewers. Reviews in the Royal Cornwall Gazette, the Hampshire Advertiser, the Glasgow Herald and the Aberdeen Weekly Advertiser throughout the following months never failed to mention the inclusion of a new ‘Sherlock Holmes story’ in their reviews.29 The process had begun by which the fame of the stories and their association with the magazine would be solidified by the same network of national and regional newspapers that had reviewed and advertised the magazine since it began. So close was this association that, upon the conclusion of the Adventures,\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 22\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\nThe Strand at the Beginning\n\n23\n\nthe Review of Reviews was led to express patronising concern for the Strand’s endurance: ‘Having no longer the attraction of Sherlock Holmes, the Strand Magazine is lucky in having still Mrs Meade’s series Stories from the Diary of a Doctor to please lovers of the sensational.’30 While Holmes was anything but the ideal Strand reader, there is a clear sense in which the stories played an ambassadorial role for the magazine throughout popular culture. Of Holmes’s connection to the Strand, Hulda Friedrichs has written that The name of Sherlock Holmes was almost synonymous with that of the Strand. It was in its pages where the prince of detectives appeared one day out of nowhere, it might be said, since, so far, he had not attained the world-wide celebrity in store for him. The Strand had leapt into popularity with its first number; with the arrival of Sherlock Holmes it entered upon the period where it had to be sent to press a month before the date of publication, keeping the machines working till the day it was put upon the bookstalls.31\n\nConan Doyle’s bond with the magazine and the astonishing success of the stories would provide him with a curious mixture of wealth, prestige, criticism and no little restlessness. He was first led to the Strand by desperation as much as anything else. His diaries and commonplace books for 1889 and 1890 are largely concerned with two subjects: his failure to achieve publication with some manuscripts and his dissatisfaction with the meagre terms under which others had been published. His accession to literary celebrity served as a marker for Ashley’s ‘age of the storyteller’, a euphemistic term that really describes the professionalisation of popular fiction writing. Conan Doyle was in many ways fortunate that he arrived at a kind of literary maturity precisely when the periodical marketplace was providing increasing opportunities to reach large readerships and make money. The appearance of the Holmes stories in the Strand and the serialisation of The White Company in the Cornhill (both in 1891) enabled him to break from his nominal ‘employment’ as an ophthalmologist. In doing so, he was not making a Wordsworthian retreat towards literature but instead moving sideways from one profession to another, considerably more profitable one. The change was facilitated as much by his short stories as by his novels, though The White Company, The Firm of Girdlestone and Micah Clarke were all still providing him with both income and cultural prestige.32 In 1889, however, stories like ‘The Great Brown-Pericord Motor’ and ‘The Physiologist’s Wife’ as well as his critical article ‘Mr. Stevenson’s\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 23\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\n24\n\nTwentieth-Century Victorian\n\nMethods in Fiction’ wended a weary passage between Tit-Bits, Cornhill, Blackwood’s, the Fortnightly Review, the National Review and the Nineteenth Century in search of acceptance. In 1890 Conan Doyle saw an increase in the profits from his work, especially after The Sign of Four was serialised in Lippincott’s Monthly. ‘Offer from Warne and Co. of £125 for shilling shocker. Refused’ reads the entry for Friday 14 March, 1890.33 This refusal was significant because Warne were peddlers of cheap, sensational literature only marginally lower in Conan Doyle’s eyes than Ward, Lock and Co., which had published A Study in Scarlet. His new financial stability enabled him to focus on completing The White Company which would feature, to Doyle’s triumph, in the rarefied pages of the Cornhill for which he had ‘reverence’.34 In October 1890 he finished a much less significant work, a short story called ‘The Voice of Science’, which he unsuccessfully sent to Figaro. While this rejection was painful, it enabled the story to be published anonymously in the Strand Magazine’s March issue the following year. ‘The Voice of Science’ was an unremarkable story made interesting by the way in which it helped to establish many tropes that would become Strand archetypes in the years to come. It sat somewhat uneasily between translated stories from Alphonse Daudet, Paul Heyse, Michael Lermontoff, Léo Lespès and Alexander Pushkin. These European writers had been chosen because of the high reputation of continental short fiction and because the stories could be selectively plucked and translated from existing bodies of work. Lermontoff, Lespès and Pushkin also had the inestimable virtue of being dead, meaning that their work could be used in the same way that Newnes had grafted press clippings to form the body of Tit-Bits. This was a clever cultural manoeuvre because it enabled Newnes to claim the works as high art while choosing particular kinds of conventional story, isolating them and having them translated into syrupy English prose that was unlikely to scare off any of his readers. By contrast ‘The Voice of Science’, like Grant Allen’s ‘A Deadly Dilemma’ in the Strand’s first issue, offered a snappy and plainly told romance narrative. In the story, a young woman, Rose Esdaile, has trouble choosing the right fiancée. Her mother, a lady of ‘remarkable scientific attainments’, has brought a phonograph into the family home for the purpose of recording a scientific lecture she has organised.35 Rose is enamoured of an army captain, Charles Beesly, and seems keen to accept his proposal during the coming evening. Rose’s brother, Rupert, has heard rumours about Beesly’s shady past and decides to trap him into a confession using the phonograph: ‘Slowly his hands emerged from his pockets as his eye fell upon the apparatus,\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 24\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\nThe Strand at the Beginning\n\n25\n\nand with languid curiosity he completed the connection and started the machine.’36 Here we see a dull story, worn thin through use and reuse. Yet with his spark of inspiration, Rupert Esdaile connects some wires and gives the story, like the magazine in which it featured, the superficial air of modernity. Esdaile records himself challenging Beesly on his past indiscretions and plays the recording before an assembled party, from which Beesly flees. ‘The Voice of Science’ ends with a pertinent illustration by W. S. Stacey (Fig. 1.1) that shows Beesly’s flight. The door to the Esdaile house is ajar leading light to spill out; the happy, genteel party has been restored to its position of security. The ideological and ethical menace of the lustful Beesly has been banished by the new auspices of scientific surveillance. The middle-class home, the ideological fortress at the heart of the Strand, is secured by the expulsion of the unwelcome intruder.\n\nFigure 1.1 Illustration by W. S. Stacey taken from Arthur Conan Doyle, ‘The Voice of Science’, Strand Magazine, March 1891, pp. 312–17, p. 317.\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 25\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\n26\n\nTwentieth-Century Victorian\n\nBy March, when ‘The Voice of Science’ appeared, Conan Doyle was settled in London, working in his barren oculist’s practice on Wimpole Street where the first two Sherlock Holmes stories would be finished. When they were ready, his agent A. P. Watt’s first instinct was to send them to Greenhough Smith at the Strand, with whom he had so recently been successful. Had the stories been sent anywhere else first and had they appeared in a magazine not experiencing its own surge of early popularity, it is difficult to imagine their endemic popularity being repeated. They appeared just at the moment when the name of the Strand was spreading dramatically through the periodical landscape and capturing a huge readership. In any case, the success of Holmes made it clear to Smith and Newnes that readers were considerably more interested in contemporary domestic fiction than in decades-old continental writing. Over time, this brought the magazine’s fiction content much more into line with its non-fiction writing on contemporary everyday life. As Conan Doyle acclimatised to the first surge of public interest and began to write additional stories for the series, he succumbed to a fever that nearly killed him and from which he emerged changed: For a week I was in great danger, and then found myself as weak as a child and as emotional, but with a mind as clear as crystal. It was then, as I surveyed my own life, that I saw how foolish I was to waste my literary earnings in keeping up an oculist’s room in Wimpole Street, and I determined with a wild rush of joy to cut the painter and to trust for ever to my power of writing . . . I should at last be my own master.37\n\nThis liberation was facilitated not through the painstaking labour of his historical novels, but through his short stories. Soon he would be able to gauge his own burgeoning celebrity through the same periodical press upon which the Strand had left such marked footprints in the preceding months. After 1891 a huge drift of reviews, notices, corrections, interviews, satires, gossip pieces and long critical pieces would refer to him, use his image and solidify the connections between him, the Strand and Holmes. His appearances and mentions in the Bookman, for example, were so numerous that an entire volume has been published to collect them together for the benefit of Sherlockian scholars.38 Amid this proliferation, however, there remains an interesting question as to how well the Holmes stories and Conan Doyle’s values more generally fitted into the Strand as a whole. Jackson observes that\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 26\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\nThe Strand at the Beginning\n\n27\n\nthe success of the Strand was also dependent upon the editor-publisher’s editorial experience, and his creation of close affective and social ties with a circle of readers and contributors . . . Appeals to ‘loyalty’ and ‘friendship’ were a common Newnesian ploy . . . Appearing at a time when its middle and upper middle class readers were beset by the forces of change and anxiety over a variety of social problems, [it provided] them with security, stability, a sense of ‘immutable British order’.39\n\nThat final phrase was taken from Stephen Knight’s hugely influential Form and Ideology in Crime Fiction. Without much recourse to the actual contents of the magazine, Knight nevertheless outlined his argument that the readers of the Strand identified with Holmes’s clients, ‘daunted by the puzzling and mundane nature of their experience’ and found ‘comfort’ in Holmes’s grandeur.40 While their relationship would fluctuate dramatically over the next four decades, Conan Doyle’s stories and the magazine as a whole marched through the early 1890s more or less in ideological lockstep.\n\nThe Strand, Property and the Law of Exchange In many ways, the Holmes stories served to underline the professional ethics of the magazine itself as well as Newnes’s political vision. We can see this particularly through the representation of money, wages and contemporary employment practices. In ‘A Case of Identity’, James Windibank marries an older woman, Mrs Sutherland, both for her money and for the money of her daughter, Mary. His lifestyle rests upon keeping Mary a dependent in his house and so he disguises himself as a suitor named Hosmer Angel and presses her for an oath of faithfulness before abandoning her on the chapel steps. It was, like many of the Holmes stories, a mystery of capital, a tale of monetary appropriation and distribution. As Knight and many others writing in his wake have observed, the stories depict an ordered society but one subject to interference and assailment from outsiders who seek to distort the tightly woven economies which regulate it. These economies included the market value for waged employment, the codes of conduct within domestic romance, a clearly gendered understanding of familial roles, a class structure which pivoted around the middle class and, finally, the assumed primacy of Britain within both the European political economy and its own colonial hierarchy. James Windibank is a semi-itinerant social climber who ‘travels’ for claret importers ‘Westhouse and Marbank’.41 These details provide\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 27\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\n28\n\nTwentieth-Century Victorian\n\nhim with a professional identity of exactly the kind that his alter ego, Hosmer Angel, purposely avoids: ‘Mr Angel was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street – and –’ ‘What Office?’ ‘That is the worst of it Mr Holmes, I don’t know.’ ‘Where did he live then?’ ‘He slept on the premises . . . [I addressed my letters] to the Leadenhall Post-Office, to be left till called for.’42\n\nFinancial details pepper the story. We discover that Mary’s private income derives from the 4% annual interest on £2,500 of stock held in New Zealand. We also learn that Hosmer Angel made no attempt to procure a dowry before his disappearance and that Mr Windibank lived a lifestyle that seemed suspiciously beyond his means. Why do these details occur with such frequency throughout the story? Doyle’s unpoetic style and uncluttered plotting meant that where a detail about a character was noted, it was either a false lure to purposely derail the readers’ expectations or a clue that Holmes would sooner or later be called upon to interpret. Here, a traceable presence within the economy provided a means by which individuals could be classified and surveilled. Angel’s conspicuous lack of such a presence alerted Holmes to his unreality. Franco Moretti equates criminality in the Holmes stories with a violation of the ‘perfect balance’ of supply and demand and ‘the law of exchange’.43 Thus the acceptance of a low salary or seemingly excessive rewards signalled the occurrence of antisocial or criminal activities. Time and again throughout the Adventures and Memoirs series plots are driven by disruptions of this kind. In ‘The Copper Beeches’, a governess, Violet Hunter, is hired at an excessive wage to act as an unwitting substitute for the imprisoned daughter of the family. In ‘The Stockbroker’s Clerk’, Hall Pycroft is lured away from his banking job with the offer of a much increased salary so that his position can be taken by a criminal impersonator. In ‘The Engineer’s Thumb’, Victor Hatherley is rescued from under-employment by an obscene offer of ‘fifty guineas for a night’s work’ to covertly fix a forger’s press.44 Money, due to its high visibility in the way the stories are told, functions as a sensitive cortex to the underworld of criminality. The subterranean actions of criminals can be intuited from the surface twitches and ruptures in the law of exchange. ‘The Red-Headed League’ exemplified this relationship by representing the fictional world of the stories as a delicately balanced\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 28\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\nThe Strand at the Beginning\n\n29\n\nand interconnected system where each participant benefited from recognising the inherent value of their position without striving to accrue surplus value or accepting less than they were worth. The first action of the plot (though it is one of the last details to be revealed) is that the City and Suburban Bank strengthened its gold resources by borrowing a large amount of bullion from the French government. This artificial augmentation of value (which was supposed to remain secret) remained in one site: the bank’s Coburg branch.45 This attracted the attention of the criminal network to which the chief villain, John Clay, belonged. All subsequent perversions of the law of exchange resulted from this one temptation, including John Clay’s acceptance of a half-wage to work for Jabez Wilson and the League’s offer to Jabez of ‘nominal’ employment for a ludicrously high wage.46 This continues to the story’s conclusion where Holmes mentions the ‘small expenses’ that he incurred during his investigation and which he ‘expect[ed] the bank to refund’.47 Money broadcasts intention and, as Holmes understands, excessive outlays can only mean deferred, illicit profits at some point in the future. Wilson is pushed ‘outside the conventions and the humdrum routine of everyday life’ and ‘off the beaten track’ by his proximity to the gold reserves. His ordinariness is emphasised in relation to his benign, self-sustaining financial life. He earns enough to make ‘a living’ and ‘keep a roof over [his] head and pay [his] debts . . . if nothing more’.48 He was linked to the Coburg bank by the ‘immense stream of commerce’ that flowed next to his ‘faded and stagnant square’.49 His story is thus an archetypal parable of the persecuted ‘middle’, an honest tradesman placed in danger by an irresponsible financial elite on the one hand, and a ruthless, avaricious criminal underclass on the other. The Holmesian method in these cases is almost always to follow the money. For example, the ‘resistless, inexorable evil’ that John Openshaw described in ‘The Five Orange Pips’ can be reduced to the fact that, when in America, his father stole papers that implicated ‘some of the first men in the South’ in involvement with the Ku Klux Klan.50 The series of violent disasters that persecute his family in England are in fact the violent outlay of wealthy men’s capital as they seek to preserve their liberty and status. In ‘The Man With the Twisted Lip’, meanwhile, Neville St Clair sets himself up in ‘a good style’ within the new commuter belt of Sussex. Yet instead of the clean money flowing from his ‘interest in several companies’, it is all paid for by his unusual career of begging in disguise on the London streets. The principal clue to Holmes unravelling the mystery lies in the discovery of a coat weighted down\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 29\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\n30\n\nTwentieth-Century Victorian\n\nwith ‘pennies and half pennies’.51 Holmes is called, then, to effectively police the borderline between streams of legitimate and illegitimate income. St Clair balked at the prospect of ‘arduous work at 2 pounds a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still’.52 Holmes restores St Clair to his large family villa on the understanding that he immediately rejoin the ranks of waged commuters. Finally, in ‘The Musgrave Ritual’, the educated working-class Brunton serves as butler to the oafish aristocrat Musgrave. His intelligence and articulacy impress all Musgrave’s visitors and his employer still retains bemusement that he ‘should have been satisfied so long in such a position’.53 This provides the key to Brunton’s eventual disappearance and death. He solves a centuries-old riddle and discovers the secret burial place of what he believes to be a lost royal fortune. He was happy to remain in the job only because he held designs upon the mislaid fortune apparently concealed somewhere on the Musgrave estate. Just as the Holmes stories came to dominate the public’s perception of the Strand, so they influenced its early changes of direction. The most notable change was the aforementioned transition from continental to domestic short stories. Some of these, like Arthur Morrison’s Martin Hewitt and James Muddock’s Dick Donovan detective series, directly mimicked aspects of Sherlock Holmes, but many others were just plainly narrated stories about the lives and loves of the middle classes, echoing ‘The Voice of Science’ much more obviously. In these largely forgotten stories, we find a similar ideological preoccupation with work and the fruits of professional labour and family life. By 1893 the transformation of the magazine’s fiction was almost complete and the number of French stories had been cut to one in each issue. The March 1893 issue memorably opened with a story called ‘A Game of Chess’ set in the sixteenthcentury court of Philip II. No author or translator was identified but a little note marked the prose as being ‘from the French’.54 Yet these boutique, historical narratives were becoming increasingly outnumbered by a swell of domestic fiction. These developments focused the magazine’s gaze upon the peoples and places of everyday life and, as a consequence, fashioned a more clearly coherent worldview. It became preoccupied with the imagined concerns of the reader: marriage, the acquisition and maintenance of a home, the institutions of social order and, particularly, the intimate concerns of waged, white-collar labour. These were the\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 30\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\nThe Strand at the Beginning\n\n31\n\nconcerns of the clients in the Holmes stories but here they could be served neat, without the thrilling but unreliably bohemian mediation of Holmes himself. As Winnie Chan argues, the short story as a kind of prestige art form, its aesthetic criteria, its critical reception and its deep entrenchment in popular taste were absolutely conditioned by the business practices of the monthly magazines like the Strand and its imitators. These models discouraged both the artistic autonomy of the author and whatever residual notions of creative genius had survived from Romantic theories of authorship.55 E. W. Hornung’s ‘Author! Author!’ made tragedy from juxtaposing the respective plights of two writers who take different paths through the era of professionalisation.56 The unnamed narrator opines in later life that ‘writing wasn’t in those days what it is now. I am thinking less of merit than of high prices, and less of high prices than of cheap notoriety.’57 His friend, Pharazyn, ruins himself by giving up all his journalistic and fictional work in order to devote himself fruitlessly to becoming a playwright. As Pharazyn becomes a peripatetic, his former friend acquires all the trappings of worldly, authorial success. The story touches on many issues including the changing cultural hierarchy of fiction, journalism and theatre as well as the whims of literary fashion. Yet its core is the contrast between the two writers: one able to produce regular, workmanlike prose for a ‘weekly cheque’ and the other touched by ‘genius’, but who invests his whole life into his work and thereby finds his ruin. Professional identities and the ethics of work also play into Walter Besant’s ‘One and Two’ where a young undergraduate named Will Challice finds himself torn between a life of idle dreaming and professional advancement. ‘I have not yet decided,’ he arrogantly wonders; ‘The Church, to raise the world. The Law, to maintain the social order. The House, to rule the nation. Literature, Science, Art – which?’58 He finds a war waging within himself between the lure of idleness and the pressures of hard work. At Cambridge he becomes too preoccupied with getting drunk and reading French novels until, like Edgar Allan Poe’s William Wilson, he encounters a doppelgänger who embodies his ‘Intellectual’ side and who begins to take over his life. His personality thus splits into the ‘Intellectual’ and the ‘Animal’ and he finds himself bewildered, watching his other self achieve great worldly success. Unlike the Poe story to which it owes a clear debt, there is a didactic, almost juvenile moral to the story. ‘William Wilson’ expertly left readers suspended in Todorov’s moment of fantastic ‘hesitation’ between mundane and supernatural explanations for the strange events.59 Besant’s story is far less deft as he confusedly seeks\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 31\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\n32\n\nTwentieth-Century Victorian\n\nto effect a reunification between the two sides of Challice’s personality. The ‘Intellectual’ realises the need for the ‘Animal’ in order to seal his courtship of the limpid love interest Nell. By tethering a fantastic narrative to a set of mundane conventions, the story makes a mess of its own moral. The lazy Challice is thus able to coast drunkenly through university while his ‘Intellectual’ patsy does all the hard work and acquires a prestigious career in the law before becoming whole again just in time for his wedding night. Meanwhile, in Marianne Kent’s ‘A Dark Transaction’, the narrator introduces himself as ‘John Blount, commercial traveller’.60 He finds his enjoyable life of business and travel compromised by the illness of his new wife. In hurrying to her bedside, he misses a crucial train and finds himself desperately rushing on foot through a tunnel where he is almost killed by an oncoming train. In missing his train and abandoning his usual work duties, Blount falls between the cracks of his secure lifestyle and ends up swapping clothes with a convict who saves his life. The majority of these stories are variations upon this basic structure: the ordered world is kept turning by the honest labours of the professional class until some disruption pulls them away from their routine. These domestic narratives were complemented by imperial adventure stories such as Charles J. Mansford’s Shafts From an Eastern Quiver series and W. Clark Russell’s ‘The Major’s Commission’. Russell’s story offered a reheated version of Wilkie Collins’s The Moonstone, with characters contesting the ownership of valuable Indian diamonds lost in the fallout of the 1857 Mutiny. More interestingly, Mansford’s stories have been identified by Ronald R. Thomas as key to understanding the Strand’s complicity in the rise of the New Imperialism.61 The stories, like those of his later Africa-set series Gleams from the Dark Continent, are astonishingly crude popular variations upon the patterns established by Kipling’s short fiction and the quest romances of Arthur Quiller-Couch and H. Rider Haggard. These debts were acknowledged by contemporary reviews which euphemistically noted that ‘the short story’ was ‘not the work in which Mr Mansford is likely to establish a reputation’.62 The interminable Quiver series lasted for ten instalments running through a catalogue of stereotypes and tropes from the orientalist playbook. Mansford seemed determined to prove Patrick Brantlinger’s charitable view of the quest romance wrong when he claimed that it was not ‘inherently racist, but rather its conventions mapped easily onto the polar oppositions of racism’.63 The stories describe the picaresque adventures of two Englishmen, Harold and Frank, as they\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 32\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\nThe Strand at the Beginning\n\n33\n\ntravel around Persia and Arabia. They are assisted and guided by a subservient ‘native’ called Hassan who they refer to as their ‘nigger’.64 In the first story, ‘The Diamonds of Shomar’s Queen’, Hassan leads the Englishmen to a lost city carved into a remote and dangerous crevasse. They are able to trick their way past the gate, abuse the sole elderly ‘crone’ guarding it, steal a priceless necklace from the statuesque corpse of the tragic, eponymous princess and blast their way out by demolishing a wall. As Frank approaches the princess’s body, he suffers a moment’s unease: ‘it seemed like robbery to remove the diamonds, but they are useless to the dead, and to us mean an immense fortune’.65 Underpinning the stories is an unquestioned belief in the idea of the wider world, especially the Orient, as a dramatic stage upon which traditional models of masculine dominance could be performed in the accrual of great wealth. The transposition of the quest romance form from the novel to the linked series format degraded an already glaringly unsubtle collection of generic characteristics. In his examination of the genre, Edward Said wrote that the quest romance revival in the late Victorian period was psychologically freeing for readers used to the default tragic mode of much realist or psychological fiction. According to this logic, the ‘tragically, or sometimes comically blocked protagonists’ of realist fiction become gradually substituted by an alternative – not only in the novel of frank exoticism and confident empire, but travel narratives, works of colonial exploration and scholarship . . . we discern a new narrative progression and triumphalism.66\n\nThe liberating freedom of the quest narrative form, then, was part of an ecstatic exculpation from imperial guilt that Thomas also identified as a crucial component of the New Imperialist cultural phenomenon. For the Strand, the British model of imperialism was a historical necessity, a moral obligation and, directly or indirectly, a reliable generator of simplistic narratives. The connection between domestic and adventure narratives was underlined beautifully by a later story, Austin Philips’s ‘The Boy Who Read Kipling’. Here, the young hero, Harry Bassett, solves all of his romantic and financial problems by assiduously studying his eponymous author hero. His ‘cleanly, finely Philistine’ bookshelf contains ‘some Doyle’s, some Q’s . . . a stray Stevenson’ and ‘in one red magnificent row, a dozen or more Kiplings’.67 In a scene of almost comically earnest frenzy, a job interview ends triumphantly as his interviewer\n\n5052_Cranfield.indd 33\n\n08/06/16 5:15 PM\n\n34\n\nTwentieth-Century Victorian\n\nrecognises Harry as ‘a White man’ and the two men depart, arm in arm, reciting ‘If’ together.68 In provincial banking careers as in orientalist adventures, perceived impediments and objections simply melt away in the world of the Strand’s stories. Mansford and his ilk helped to establish an imperial framework within which to understand the rhythms of everyday life at home. Domestic comfort was underpinned by the thrill of foreign adventures and the two economies were mutually supportive. Interestingly, Mansford’s adventurers are able to cash in their discovery by sending it home to London, contributing to the very consumerism celebrated elsewhere in the magazine. The diamonds were bought from us eventually by a syndicate of London merchants . . . The wearers of them, as they see the light sparkling from the gems, little suppose that they are adorned with the diamonds of Shomar’s queen.69\n\nSo, even while the narratives roam through the remote deserts and oases of fevered Western imaginations, the gravitational pull of the Imperial centre assures the legitimacy of their efforts as well as guaranteeing their immense financial rewards. Ruth Hoberman makes a convincing case for the Strand’s deep complicity in new styles of middle-class consumerism. She takes Walter Benjamin’s argument about the depreciation of the artobject’s ‘aura’ in the age of mechanical reproduction and shows how the Strand valorised the mass-produced commodities that filled the middle-class home. This kind of ‘respectable’ consumerism was privileged over the profligate, indulgent model of aristocr"
