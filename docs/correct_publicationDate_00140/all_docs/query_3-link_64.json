        "text": "Clouds of Doom\n\nA number of science fiction clouds over the years have presented a direct threat to life on Planet Earth. An early science fiction story in which an interstellar cloud (of a sort) features is The Poison Belt by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (novel, 1913). This novel features Doyle’s recurring scientist character Professor Challenger and his friends, better known for their appearance in The Lost World (1912). In this narrative, the professor correctly predicts that Earth’s solar system is drifting into a toxic region of “the ether”, which causes confusion, euphoria, coma and death - with potentially lethal consequences for all animal life on the planet. By the time this novel was written, the existence of a hypothesised ether (or luminiferous aether) had been abandoned by physicists as a result of unsuccessful attempts (such as the Michelson-Morley experiment) to detect it. However it was still in common use in popular culture, with an approximate meaning which we would now equate to the structure of space-time, but commonly described in the form of clouds of one kind or another.\n\nThe Poison Belt articulates a theme common to many stories involving interstellar nebulae: the insignificance in scale of humanity and Earth when compared to the wider Universe. Challenger equates the imminent elimination of humanity to the bacilli washed off grapes by a gardener, while the story concludes with a consideration of the same question:\n\n“It is from that salutory but terrible ordeal that we have just emerged, with minds which are still stunned by the suddenness of the blow and with spirits which are chastened by the realisation of our own limitations and impotence.”\n\nDoyle’s poisonous ether actually proves to be a narrow belt, which the Earth passes through more rapidly and with less catastrophic effects than originally feared, but the novel is an early forerunner of the kind of post-apocalyptic novels that involved similar scenarios in the later twentieth century.\n\nIn contrast, another living energy-matter cloud - this time fully sentient - can be found in an episode of the much earlier Star Trek: The Animated Series. In 1973’s “One of our Planets is Missing”, a dense cloud described as rather larger than Jupiter absorbs and destroys one rocky planet and is en route towards another. As Spock describes, “It is like a huge bull, grazing here and there in the pasture of the Universe.” Unfortunately, it remains unaware that the planets it is grazing on are inhabited. As Voyager would do later, the Enterprise enters the cloud, although this time with intent of destroying it. However, as in Hoyle’s The Black Cloud, it proves possible to communicate with this example, and to alert it to the population on the planet in its path.\n\nYet another example can be found in Star Trek: The Next Generation where the Enterprise-D scans a cloud that appears to be travelling at warp speed in “Lonely Among Us” (1987). The act of scanning draws an energy-based life form into the ship, where it possesses the physical bodies of various crew members in its attempt to return to its home environment in the cloud. It’s not clear here whether this sentience is one amongst many in the cloud, alone, or only a fragment of a much larger whole. Voyager would encounter a similar situation, with the ship possessed by a nebula-based energy being rather than individuals, in “The Haunting of Deck Twelve” (2000), which also features a nebula dense enough to penetrate the ship and fog its corridors.\n\nIn fact, the very low density of interstellar material presents the biggest challenge to the concept of intelligent gas or dust clouds. Such widely scattered particles are unlikely to generate sufficiently strong fields or interactions to transfer any kind of information between them akin to nervous activity, while the individual particles themselves are too small to support intelligence. And life that did form would exist in what we on Earth would still consider a hard vacuum, and one exposed to the temperatures of deep space.\n\nSo if the fundamental idea is so implausible, why are dust clouds so often used in science fiction? Well, perhaps more than anything else, they provide an incredibly attractive and enthralling visual setting. Particularly since the advent of modern astrophotography, and the false colour imagery distributed based on Hubble Space Telescope observations, images of genuine nebulae have formed the backdrop to endless science science fictions [4]. Such swirls of light and colour are far more interesting than the black void of space, and provide a good stage against which to set the exploration of human qualities in science fiction.\n\nHowever such clouds also hold a psychological attraction. They represent the unknown and unfamiliar, an obscuring fog when compared to the clear white light of stars. Indeed even to astronomers, the nature of interstellar dust and gas remained unclear for a long time (although now it is the details rather than general composition of clouds that cause debate). As well as this obscurity, the idea of intelligent nebulae in particular possess the attraction of contrast - for beings as small and physical as humans, the concept of a vast, formless and shapeless creature perhaps represents the most alien of possible intelligences.\n\nModern observations have found a vast range of chemical compounds in astronomical clouds, including a range of large molecules. Some of these include prebiotic compounds such as complex hydrocarbon chains - with some claims of molecules approaching the complexity of the amino acids that form our DNA. This is a long way from claiming the discovery of DNA itself, or the possibility of life in such conditions, but it nonetheless continues to feed speculation and research into the concept of panspermia.\n\n“Gathering Clouds”, Elizabeth Stanway, Cosmic Stories blog, 12th March 2023.\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] Examples of use of the Crab Nebula as an exotic-sounding but poorly understood setting include the Doctor Who short story “Sons of the Crab” from 1966, the home base of villains Spectra in Battle of the Planets, short stories including “First Contact” by Murray Leinster, and books such as Colossus and the Crab by D F Jones. At least the first two are impressively scientifically-illiterate, describing the Crab Nebula (a local supernova remnants) as outside our galaxy or even outside the Universe. [Return to text]\n\n[2] Blake’s 7 also exhibits the widespread cloud-as-hiding-place trope in the episode \"Hostage\". [Return to text]\n\n[3] Regrettably, while these two Hoyle & Hoyle novels have some interesting scientific details woven into the narrative, there is little to recommend them in terms of plot or characters, and the second book ends with a surprisingly large number of plot elements unresolved. [Return to text]\n\n[4] Indeed, as far back as 1937, the science fantasy film The Man Who Could Work Miracles portrayed its celestial intelligences as nebula-like shimmers of light against a dark sky.
