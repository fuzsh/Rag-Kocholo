        "text": "The legendary Professor Challenger hits the headlines once again. In a letter to 'The Times', he asserts that a change in the earth’s cosmic surroundings is resulting in the poisoning of the planet. He claims that seemingly unconnected worldwide disasters prove that the earth has swum into a poison belt of ether – and towards inevitable destruction. Ed Malone, the dynamic young journalist, is then invited to visit the Professor with the strange request to ‘bring oxygen’. The four members of 'The Lost World' expedition reunited, they settle down to a hearty lunch, with the Professor determined to enjoy his final few hours. Is this all a strange ruse of the Professor’s, or is total annihilation really only hours away?"
