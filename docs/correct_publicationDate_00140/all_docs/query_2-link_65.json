        "text": "The Brigadier Gerard stories of Arthur Conan Doyle\n\nSome writers are authors and some are morthors – more imaginative, more creative, able to create more characters in more genres and more styles than their mundane fellows. And the best example of a morthor that I know is Arthur Conan Doyle. If you know him only by Sherlock Holmes, you’re missing out on a lot. Not just more good characters, like Professor Challenger and the wicked Pirate Sharkey, but more of Doyle’s literary range. You don’t read the Holmes stories for their lightheartedness, humor and romantic intrigues. But those things are central to The Adventures – and The Exploits – of Brigadier Gerard.\n\nAnd who is Brigadier Gerard? He’s a dashing French Hussar who fights with great valor and distinction in the Napoleonic wars, serving (and observing) Napoleon with unswerving admiration and devotion, then ends his days impoverished and forgotten, reminiscing with a glass of wine in a ramshackle café in his home-province of Gascony. The stories are told in his own words, implicitly translated from French, and they bring Gerard boisterously and boundingly to life. At the beginning of “How the Brigadier Captured Saragossa”, he’s ready to fight a duel with twelve of his fellow officers, one after another. By the end of the story, he’s ready to fight them all at once. And that’s when they realize that they shouldn’t have insulted him when he first arrived in a new mess.\n\nGerard is foolish but formidable, you see. Doyle is poking fun at the French and paying homage to them at the same time. But he also pokes fun at the English, particularly in the story “How the Brigadier Slew the Fox”. Gerard is always misreading situations and behavior, but he’s never further from the truth than he is here:\n\nIn all the great hosts of France there was only one officer toward whom the English of Wellington’s Army retained a deep, steady, and unchangeable hatred. […] But the strange part of it is that [the] gallant gentleman did this hateful thing, and made himself the most unpopular man in the Peninsula, without ever knowing that he had done a crime for which there is hardly a name amid all the resources of our language. He died of old age, and never once in that imperturbable self-confidence which adorned or disfigured his character knew that so many thousand Englishmen would gladly have hanged him with their own hands. On the contrary, he numbered this adventure among those other exploits which he has given to the world, and many a time he chuckled and hugged himself as he narrated it to the eager circle who gathered round him in that humble cafe where, between his dinner and his dominoes, he would tell, amid tears and laughter, of that inconceivable Napoleonic past when France, like an angel of wrath, rose up, splendid and terrible, before a cowering continent. Let us listen to him as he tells the story in his own way and from his own point of view. – “How Gerard Slew the Fox”\n\nAnd yes, you should listen, because the Gerard stories deserve to be much better-known. In a way, though, both the Brigadier and his adventures have been well-known for decades to millions of readers. They just haven’t realized it. Under a different name and with an entirely different psychology, Gerard became a best-seller in 1969. That was when the first Flashman novel was published. And I’m sure that the Gerard stories were the central inspiration for Flashman, the honour-laden Victorian soldier who looks back on his military adventures in his old age just as Gerard did. It’s just that where Gerard really was a dashing and debonaire cavalryman, headstrong, heroic and hellbent on glory, Flashman only appeared to be so. With Gerard, it was fundamental; with Flashman, it was façade.\n\nThat’s not to take anything away from George MacDonald Fraser, Flashman’s creator. All authors borrow and bend. But not all authors are morthors. MacDonald Fraser wasn’t a morthor; Conan Doyle was. And as I discovered when I looked for an image to accompany this review, GMF actually wrote an introduction to one edition of the collected Gerard stories. So he too wanted a few more Flashman fans to try the Gerard stories and realize that they’d already met his cowardly twin brother. But, cowardly or courageous, each brother tells a good story and brings history to life as he describes how he wooed woman and found himself foremost when the steel was flashing and bullets flying. Gerard was chivalrous with women and wanted to be in the midst of battle; Flashman wasn’t and didn’t. Gerard deserved his honors and the respect of his comrades and enemies; Flashman most emphatically didn’t. Those were MacDonald Fraser’s comic twists and they worked well in novel after novel.\n\nBut the Gerard stories work better. Like P.G. Wodehouse, Arthur Conan Doyle could infuse ink with joie-de-vivre. He doesn’t do that with Sherlock Holmes, but he did with Brigadier Gerard. And unlike me, you or any other reader, Gerard will never die. He lives on the page and always will.\n\nElsewhere other-accessible\n\n• The Exploits of Gerard (1896) at Project Gutenberg\n\n• The Adventures of Gerard (1903)\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nThe Lost World and Other Stories, Arthur Conan Doyle (various dates)\n\nProfessor Challenger, the “ape-man in a lounge-suit”, is someone else in Sherlock’s shadow, but in some ways he’s much more interesting than Doyle’s detective. Holmes may have set “the whole world talking” but “to set the whole world screaming was the privilege of Challenger alone.” He does that in the last story of the collection, “When the World Screamed” (1928), in which the earth is found to be even more alive than the modern Gaia theory suggests. And it kicks against Challenger’s prick. That foreshadowing of later science is also found in “The Poison Belt” (1913):\n\nA third-rate sun, with its rag tag and bobtail of insignificant satellites, we float towards some unknown end, some squalid catastrophe which will overwhelm us at the ultimate confines of space, where we are swept over an etheric Niagara or dashed upon some unthinkable Labrador. I see… many reasons why we should watch with a very close and interested attention every indication of change in those cosmic surroundings upon which our own ultimate fate may depend.\n\nThere are some very interesting and prescient ideas here: Doyle should get much more credit for his pioneering science fiction, but again Holmes is probably to blame. Not that Holmes would have wanted to take the limelight: he’s introverted and not played for comedy. Challenger is the opposite in both ways. Ted Malone, the narrator of “The Lost World” (1912), notes that his “enormously massive genial manner” is “almost as overpowering as his violence”. Later, Malone has an unpleasant encounter with a tick in the South American jungle:\n\n“Filthy vermin!” I cried.\n\nProfessor Challenger raised his great eyebrows in protest, and placed a soothing paw upon my shoulder.\n\n“You should cultivate the scientific eye and the detached scientific mind,” said he. “To a man of philosophic temperament like myself the blood-tick, with its lancet-like proboscis and its distending stomach, is as beautiful a work of Nature as the peacock or, for that matter, the aurora borealis. It pains me to hear you speak of it in so unappreciative a fashion. No doubt, with due diligence, we can secure some other specimen.”\n\n“There can be no doubt of that,” said Summerlee, grimly, “for one has just disappeared behind your shirt-collar.”\n\nChallenger sprang into the air bellowing like a bull, and tore frantically at his coat and shirt to get them off.\n\nEach of the four main characters in “The Lost World” has a distinct personality, as though Doyle is trying to embody the Greek humours: there’s the choleric Challenger; the phlegmatic Summerlee, Challenger’s sardonic rival; the sanguine Lord Roxton, a big-game huntsman who accompanies the expedition for sport; and the melancholic Irishman Ted Malone, the journalist who narrates the story. This makes for entertaining reading, as I’ve found every time I’ve come back to the story. And my re-readings must be in double figures now. Doyle’s racial descriptions will provoke disapproval in many modern readers, but they’re something else that may be prescient and they aren’t confined to “villainous half-breeds” and the “huge negro Zambo, who is as faithful as a dog” but not very intelligent. Doyle also describes the Irish as distinct within the white European race, which does seem to be the case.\n\nBut Doyle’s prescience has failed so far in the longest story of the collection, which, in its way, is another joke at Professor Challenger’s expense. Having made the character popular before the First World War, Doyle shoe-horned him into “The Land of Mist” in 1927 as part of his propaganda for spiritualism. I’ve never re-read this story, which has more historical and biographical interest than literary merit. Doyle lost a son and brother during the War and the wishful thinking that inspired his support of spiritualism is evident throughout the story. He even makes Challenger turn on his head for the purposes of spiritualist propaganda. This is Challenger in “The Poison Belt” in 1913:\n\n“No, Summerlee, I will have none of your materialism, for I, at least, am too great a thing to end in mere physical constituents, a packet of salts and three bucketfuls of water. Here ― here” ― and he beat his great head with his huge, hairy fist ― “there is something which uses matter, but is not of it ― something which might destroy death, but which death can never destroy.”\n\nBut in “The Land of Mist”, fourteen years later, Challenger opposes the supernatural and has to be brought round against his will. He champions materialism as his daughter Enid and his friend Malone, both reporters, are about to attend a spiritualist meeting. Malone reluctantly accepts materialism as an intellectual proposition:\n\n“But my instincts are against!” cried Enid. “No, no, never can I believe it.” She threw her arms round the great bull neck. “Don’t tell me, Daddy, that you with all your complex brain and wonderful self are a thing with no more life hereafter than a broken clock!”\n\n“Four buckets of water and a bagful of salts,” said Challenger as he smilingly detached his daughter’s grip. “That’s your daddy, my lass, and you may as well reconcile your mind to it.”\n\nEnid doesn’t and in the end Challenger admits he was wrong. The effort Doyle put into the story was wasted: it’s only a historical curiosity nowadays and seems likely to remain so. To see why the other stories, some much shorter, are much more valuable, simply pick up a copy of the collection in the excellent Wordsworth series.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nThe Conan Doyle Stories, Arthur Conan Doyle (Blitz Editions, 1990)\n\nMary Shelley wrote about a monster that broke free of its creator. It then broke free of its creatrix too: Frankenstein’s monster became far more famous than Mary Shelley ever was. Dracula and James Bond outgrew Bram Stoker and Ian Fleming in the same way, but Sherlock Holmes and Arthur Conan Doyle are a little different. It isn’t just Doyle who stands in his character’s shadow now but a host of Doyle’s other characters too. That’s what made it so galling for Doyle, because he didn’t think the Sherlock Holmes stories were his best work.\n\nIf you read this marvellous collection, a modern facsimile of a book published before the Second World War, you might begin to agree with him. Doyle wasn’t so much an author as an industry, and the range of his invention and subjects is startling. There’s everything from realism to the supernatural by way of science fiction, from “The Croxley Master”, the story of a prize-fight in a tough Yorkshire mining district, to “Lot No. 249”, the story of a murderous Egyptian relic, by way of “The Horror of the Heights”, a proto-Lovecraftian story of early aviation. But perhaps my favourites are the pirate stories about the wicked Captain Sharkey, whose sail, believe me, you would not have liked to see appear on your horizon all those years ago. There’s a Brigadier Gerard story too, as light and playful as the Sharkey stories are dark and sadistic, and reminding me that I ought to re-read the full set of Gerard stories again.\n\nEverything else has its interesting points, but some stories were re-printed because Doyle became famous, not because they’re any good, and two are throw-aways turning on what were, when they were written, the startling inventions of recorded sound and moving pictures (Holmes aficionados will recall that Doyle used the idea elsewhere). Like those two, many stories have political or social preoccupations that make them interesting in ways never intended. In other ways, however, Doyle’s writing may be becoming less rather than more dated as the years pass: his shameless racial and sexual stereotyping — opposing the phlegmatic Saxon to the highly-strung Celt, for example — was once taken for granted, then dismissed, but is now being vindicated by genetics. Doyle trained and practised as a doctor, after all, and brought a trained eye and wide experience of human variety to his writing. There are medical stories here too, but Doyle says in his introduction that his “Tales of Long Ago” are the ones he would choose to preserve if he could save only one section.\n\nI don’t think they’re the best in the book myself, but they are among the most powerful and they have a breadth of knowledge and minuteness of observation worthy of the great Victorian artist Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, who specialized in classical scenes. Like Alma-Tadema, Doyle was knighted for bringing so much pleasure to the general public, but his reputation and fame have survived much better than the painter’s, thanks to Sherlock Holmes. Read this collection to discover why there is much more to Doyle than his detective.\n\nRead Full Post »"
