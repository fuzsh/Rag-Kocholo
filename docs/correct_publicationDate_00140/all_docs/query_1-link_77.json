        "text": "by Dr. Sean Manning Ph.D.\n\nWhen I visited Iran in 2016, I made sure to look for one of the sculptures at Persepolis in particular. On the walls of the staircases which lead to the platform with the great throne-hall or Apadana, Darius’ workers carved delegations of subjects in their national costumes bringing tribute. Each delegation is led by an usher in a Persian tunic and trousers or a flowing Elamite robe. When the main entrance was moved from the east to the north under Darius or his son Xerxes, the sculptors packed up their tool-boxes and carved the same relief on the new eastern staircase. After Alexander the Great’s soldiers burned down the hall with its pillars of cedar and roof of ebony and teak, the mud-brick walls slumped down and buried the staircases with their reliefs so that they were not destroyed by rain or scavenged by villagers. At the start of the lowest level of the staircase is a delegation of three little men with curly hair bringing a pot, an elephant tusk, and a strange animal with four legs and a long neck. Most scholars argue that this is a representation of a giraffe, and that the delegation are from the country along the upper Nile, variously called Kush, Ethiopia, or Nubia in antiquity. Paintings from Bronze Age Egypt often show people from Kush bringing elephant tusks and giraffes, and kings outside of Africa sometimes kept giraffes to show their power: the Yongle emperor of China received one from the Sultan of Bengal in the fifteenth century. In one of his articles for the journal Isis, L. Sprague de Camp promoted a different theory.\n\nIt is generally agreed that the creature at Persepolis does not look much like a giraffe. Its body is too stout, its neck too short, and its hooves more like domestic cattle. If the artists just wanted an animal from exotic Africa which would fit in a triangular space, why not choose a monkey? However, there is a relative of the giraffe called the okapi. It is much smaller with a short neck,with a general appearance similar to a zebra. The okapi is shy and lives in dense forests. In recent times, okapi are not found much further north than the Congo, but in recent times pygmies don’t live close to Egypt either, and much of what is now the Sahara Desert was less dry in antiquity. Little people of one kind or another were common in Bronze Age Egypt and Roman artists imagined that Egypt was still full of them. So in his novel The Dragon of the Ishtar Gate (1961) and his article for Isis, de Camp suggested that around the time of Xerxes, someone had travelled from Egypt to the Upper Nile and returned with either a live okapi or at least drawings of the beast. This theory was not new (Erich F. Schmidt, chief excavator at Persepolis, attributes it to paleontologist Bryan Patterson) but de Camp helped to spread it.\n\nIn 1980, two researchers published a different theory. South Asia has a species of wild cattle called nilgai. They have humps over their forequarters like the animals on the staircase. Nilgai have manes on their necks, short straight horns on their heads, and large tufts on their tails, which are both features of the animals on the sculptures but not of okapi. Whereas male giraffes are about 3.3 metres tall at the shoulder, and okapi about 1.6 metres, nilgai are 1 to 1.5 metres high at the shoulder. That is much closer to the creature at Persepolis whose shoulders are around the waist level of the usher. Nilgai live in herds in the hills and plains and have been tamed and used to pull carts, so they could certainly be captured and brought as tribute. Okapi are shy animals and have not been commonly trained or kept in zoos. Darius and Xerxes ruled territories in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent, and people have sailed between western India and the Persian Gulf since the Bronze Age whenever the land and sea were not too dangerous. Nilgai could have made their journey to the heart of the Persian empire by river and sea, rather than having to walk all the way overland. Lastly, both South Asia and Africa have short curly-haired peoples with dark skin (although in recent times Asian ‘negritos’ mostly live in the east and on islands). Herodotus said that dark-skinned Indians looked like “Ethiopians,” and Assyrian scholars transplanted old names for exotic peoples from the east to the west. None of the delegations at Persepolis is labelled, so scholars have to guess which nation each represents. So the idea that this is a delegation from distant parts of India, rather than distant parts of Africa, is not absurd.\n\nBecause I am an Achaemenid historian, I can dig into my collection of books and articles and show how the conversation continued. As far as I can tell the giraffe theory remains popular. Egyptologist Robert Morkot had this to say thirty years ago:\n\nThe identity of this animal has been disputed, some believing it is an okapi, found only in central Africa. De Camp’s (1963) suggestion that the scene was inspired by an expedition sent by Xerxes to central Africa within sight of the Ruwenzori range can be little more than fantasy. The explanation for its being an Indian Nilgai (Valdez, Tuck 1980) is equally fanciful, and most probably the animal is meant to represent a giraffe, frequently found in Egyptian paintings as part of the Kushite tribute. Any inaccuracies in the drawing may be put down to the artist’s unfamiliarity with the animal, possibly having to draw from a skin rather than live beast, or simply to a lack of wall space.\n\nand art historian Henry P. Colburn in 2021:\n\nSeveral commentators have identified this animal as an okapi, or forest giraffe, native to the tropical forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. While it is entirely possible that an okapi was transported some 2000 km from its native habitat to Kush, and then onwards to Persepolis, this would have to have been a recurring event in order for the okapi to become emblematic of the Kushites. A simpler explanation is that the Kushites on the Apadana are modeled on the Kushite tribute bearers found in Egyptian tomb paintings of the New Kingdom. For example, the tomb of Rekhmire at Thebes, dating to the 18th Dynasty, features an image of two Kushite tribute bears herding a giraffe and a monkey (fig. 7). As Root has shown, the imagery of the Apadana reliefs draws in significant part on the tradition of Egyptian tomb painting, including in the rendering of the Kushite delegation. Indeed, it seems more likely that there would be knowledge of Egyptian tomb decorations at Persepolis than there would be of actual Kushites, let alone of fauna from central Africa.\n\nI like the idea that the reliefs of tribute-bearers are modeled on Egyptian paintings of foreigners travelling to Egypt. But it seems to me that master stonecarvers at Persepolis could have sorted through their sketches and mixed up one kind of little curly-haired person or one exotic animal with another. I think L. Sprague de Camp would have loved the researchers’ proposal that a delegation from Ethiopia might have picked up a nilgai along the way and hoped that nobody would know the difference, because in his Gataho stories and his essays like “Barbarians I Have Known” he was amused by indigenous people who perform the kind of indigeneity that wealthy outsiders expect to see. If I ever get a chance to lecture on Persepolis, I will certainly mention the okapi and nilgai theories.\n\nSean Manning grew up on the west coast of Canada, moved to Calgary to write a master’s thesis on the revolt of Cyrus the Younger (2013), and moved to Austria where he was awarded a PhD in November 2018 at the Universität Innsbruck for his work on the Achaemenid empire. As of 2023 he is an affiliated researcher with the Department of Greek and Roman Studies at the University of Victoria.

Sprague de Camp! I had forgotten I had this book. I eagerly re-read it. It’s been so long it was like reading a new Sprague book! Following is my report.\n\nThe first chapter is “Invention Comes to America.” Sprague reminds the reader about how much America has changed since George Washington’s time. On page 10 he writes “During the scant two hundred years since the men of George Washington’s time transformed the thirteen colonies into states, another far-reaching revolution has taken place, silently, without proclamation, but increasing in pace as the years passed by. It started in England about 1765 and is still changing people’s lives all over the world.” Sprague then tells us that “The basis of the Industrial Revolution was a series of inventions. Of these inventions, the first and most important was the steam engine.”\n\nSprague then does a mini-essay on why the Industrial Revolution had not started sooner. He points out that through human history that there had been many inventions but that the right set of circumstances never came off. Sprague guesses that mankind came closest during the Hellenistic Age. On page 12 he points out that “One fact may partly explain the failure of Hellenistic science to become the self-perpetuating, ever-growing thing that science is today. This is the separation of pure science from applied science- that is, from engineering and invention. Nowadays, pure science could not advance unless inventors provided it with new tools and instruments, while inventors would soon bog down without new scientific discoveries to apply and exploit. In ancient times, however, pure science was a matter of upper-class philosophers, while inventions were mostly made by obscure common workmen. Archimedes, deeming himself primarily a pure scientist, apologized for his inventions as beneath the dignity of a gentleman. As a result of this attitude, scientific research was brought to a standstill because nobody had invented the microscope, the telescope, and the wheeled clock to enable scientists to observe phenomena beyond the reach of their unaided senses.”\n\nSprague then writes on page 15 that after a long, frustrating, and painful history “In time, however, many people came to realize that inventions are advantageous in the long run and so ought to be encouraged.” Inventors would be encouraged by being given a temporary monopoly known as “patents.” Sprague then tells us that the granting of patents began in fifteenth century Italy. The first known patent was given by the Republic of Florence in 1421. During the early stages of the scientific revolution, people also began to realize that science and invention are closely connected.”\n\nOn page 16 Sprague writes that “In the eighteenth century American colonies, men began to show that talent for gadgeteering which ever since has been such a conspicuous trait of our national character.” Sprague reminds us that “Colonial America would not have appeared so inventive had it not been for one man, a man of such extraordinary genius and versatility as to seem almost like a one-man Renaissance. This was Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790). Besides being an abolitionist, athlete, author, civic leader, composer, diplomat, economist, fireman, hoaxer, journalist, landlord, legislator, librarian, linguist, Mason, musician, nudist, paper manufacturer, politician, post-master, printer, publisher, scientist, soldier, spelling reformer, statesman, storekeeper, and jolly good fellow, he found time to be the most active American inventor of his day.”\n\nSprague describes the invention of the “Franklin stove” and Franklin’s experiments with electricity. Franklin’s discovery that “lightning is nothing but a big electric spark” led to Franklin’s invention of the lightning rod. Franklin, no matter how busy he was, continued to invent for the rest of his life. Sprague also tells us about the misadventures of John Fitch (1743-1798), “after Franklin perhaps the most brilliant inventor of colonial America and certainly the unhappiest.” The steamboats of Fitch never quite worked out and Fitch eventually committed suicide. Sprague writes “Poor Fitch was doomed from the start by his own shortcomings. Though brilliant, he was so touchy, quarrelsome, excitable, and foolish in worldly matters that he could never work for long with anybody.” That many inventors were cantankerous and hard to get along with is a theme in this book.\n\nChapter 2 describes how the Heroic Age begins. Sprague discusses Thomas Jefferson and Fulton and Eli Whitney. Whitney’s cotton gin is a excellent example how a machine can change history: “The gin, however, made the cultivation of upland cotton by Negro slaves immensely profitable. The lust of profit overrode all other considerations, and the South became so heavily committed to slavery that it took the Civil War to end the institution.” At the end of the chapter Sprague tells us that “we may date the heroic age roughly from 1836 to 1917. It began with the reorganization of the Patent Office and ended with the entry of the United States into the First World War.”\n\nChapter 3 is titled “The Stevenses and Railroading.” Sprague reminds us that “In a few decades the railroad shrank the United States, in terms of travel time, from its original vastness down to the size of New England. The railroad carried millions and employed tens of thousands; it governed the course of the Civil War; it became one of the nation’s foremost problems in the days of trusts and early labor union organization.” You read about English engineers Richard Trevithick and George Stephenson. Sprague then focuses his gaze on the brilliant Stevens family: John Stevens, Jr. and his son Robert Livingston Stevens. You will learn about how American engineering improved, how the articulated locomotives were invented, choosing the railroad track gauge, and the invention of the safe railroad automatic car coupling which Sprague reminds us that “The Janney coupling saved not only lives and limbs but also time.” Sprague’s discussion of the railroad track gauge reminds me of a book about the Nazi invasion of Soviet Russia. One of the many problems that the Germans ran into was that the Soviet railroad track gauge was different from the German gauge.\n\n“Henry, Morse, and the Telegraph” is the title of Chapter 4. Sprague tells us of Joseph Henry and his experiments with electricity and how his thoughts and inventions were able to assist Samuel Morse and his telegraph system. Morse was (as so many of the inventors described in this book “vain, volatile, testy, and temperamental.” He and Henry had a falling out and Morse was also a man of strong religious and racial prejudices who sided with the South in the Civil War. Sprague writes that “after the war, however, people forgave Morse his part in this conspiracy, and he ended his days old, rich, and honored.”\n\nThe most fascinating part of this chapter to me was the tale of Cyrus W. Field. He came up with the idea of the transatlantic cable. On page 72 Sprague writes “So began a thirteen-year struggle that cost twelve million dollars and required Field to cross the Atlantic forty times, when such crossings took the better part of a month and were far from comfortable.” Sprague finished this chapter telling us that there were nineteen transatlantic cables. I recently read that there were now ten in use. I suppose the advent of the satellite put quite a few of them out of commission.\n\nIn Chapter 5 we read about “Colt and other gunmakers.” Because of the inventions of Colt and the Maxim brothers, Sprague reminds us that Alexander and Caesar “would easily have recognized a Napoleonic battle for what it was. By the First World War, all this was changed out of recognition. On a twentieth-century battlefield, Alexander or Caesar might mistake the battle for some vast, impersonal convulsion of nature.” Sprague tells us much about Samuel Colt and the Maxim brothers, and their revolutionary inventions.\n\nChapter 6 is titled “McCormick and Farm Machinery.” We learn that “Early American farming was especially backward. European travelers were astonished by its crudity.” Enter Robert McCormick! He was a brilliant inventor who was “ruthlessly intolerant of opposition. Although several rival inventors of harvesters were as original as he, he overcame and outsold them all by his shrewdness in business and by his invincible drive and energy.” A constant theme in this book is how ornery most of these inventors were. You do NOT want to get on their bad side! McCormick is described as “a rampant individualist–a tooth-and-nail fighter who never compromised or co-operated with an opponent.” On page 109 we read about the celebrated McCormick Reaper Case in Cincinnati and how an Illinois lawyer named Abraham Lincoln became involved. Sprague concludes the chapter that reminds us that “We are still in the midst of an Agricultural Revolution as far-reaching in its effects as the Industrial Revolution, which preceded it and or which it is an outgrowth.”\n\nChapter 7 is titled “Ericsson and the Modern Warship.” We are told about the 19th century transition from wooden warships powered by sail to steam driven “Ironclads” and its revolutionary effect on sea warfare. John Ericsson designed the “Monitor,” a revolutionary warship used in the Civil War. Ericsson had enormous physical strength, being able at age 18 to deadlift a 600-pound cannon ball. As with so many of the extraordinary characters in this book, Sprague tells us that Ericsson was “volatile, hot tempered, and opinionated.” Improvements in artillery shells, rifling, and powder all contributed to making naval warfare much more long range and deadly.\n\nWe read about “Kelly and Steel Refining” in Chapter 8. Sprague tells us that if we could whisk forward in time Caesar or Leonardo they would be amazed to find that “steel, while never so valuable as gold and silver, was still costly enough in the days of Caesar and Leonardo da Vinci so that its lavish use in the modern world would astonish them. How did this change come about?” Sprague tells us of the properties of iron and how it was improved over time. He states that “we cannot separate the American contributions from the European. The story leaps back and forth across the Atlantic like a tennis ball across from a court.” We learn about the inventors Henry Cort, William Kelly, Henry Bessemer, and Robert F. Mushet. These men persevered through many setbacks and patent issues and in the end “As a result of these advances, steel soon replaced wrought iron in cannon, railroad rails, boilers, ship plates, and many other applications; and thus the steel industry became the colossus of the modern industrial world.”\n\nChapter 9 tells us of “Mergenthaler, Sholes, and Writing Machines.” Sprague reminds us that “Speech flows along at about ten times the speed of ordinary longhand writing.” He tells us that “The great step forward in speeding up writing was that taken in Mainz, Germany, in 1450 by Johann Gutenberg, with his invention of movable type–unless, as some maintain, Gutenberg stole the idea from Laurens Janszoon Coster.” The industrial revolution took over printing. The first steam press was built in Germany in 1811. The man who solved the slow and laborious typesetter problem was a native of Germany, Ottmar Mergenthaler. Mergenthaler began making his type casting machines in 1886. He succumbed to tuberculosis at the age of 45.\n\nChristopher Latham Sholes was the inventor who gave us the modern typewriter. He was another man who led a short life because of tuberculosis. Sprague reminds us that Sholes started a revolution: “He believed that the typewriter could provide genteel jobs for women, and it did on a scale far beyond anyone’s imaginings. It was, in fact, one of the biggest factors in the emancipation of women. So marked was the social revolution brought about by this one invention that Sir James M. Barrie wrote a one-act play on the subject, The Twelve Pound Look. Ethel Barrymore once played in it, portraying Kate, the woman who had been freed by a typewriter from servile dependence on a tyrannical husband.” (The 12 pounds refers to the cost in British money of a typewriter.)\n\nIn Chapter 10 we hear the story of ” Bell and the Telephone.” Bell’s many struggles culminated when he called his assistant Thomas Watson, ” Mr. Watson, please come here; I want you.” Bell had luck, hard work, a good business sense, and won his patent battles. Later in life, very rich, Bell bought “a baronial estate in Nova Scotia, where he bred sheep. He built a laboratory to help the deaf and became very active in and generous to scientific organizations.” In 1915 the first transcontinental telephone line was opened. As part of the ceremony, Bell in the East and Watson on the Pacific Coast spoke over it as they had thirty-nine years before. Bell: ” Mr. Watson, please come here; I want you.” Watson replied: “It would take me a week now!”\n\n“Edison and the Electric Light” is the title of Chapter 11. We learn of Edison’s many struggles and what a hard worker he was. On page 175 Sprague writes ” he kept fantastic hours, sleeping two or three hours out of the twenty-four and expecting his men to do likewise.” To Sprague “the dominant impression of his personality is one of detachment–of a man with no time for ordinary human emotions.” As with many characters in this book, Edison became embroiled in countless patent battles. The Heroic Age of American Invention was not for the faint of heart! This book implies to me that many of these men enjoyed a good brawl and cherished a good grudge! Sprague sums up Edison thusly:” Even if he did not do all the things that some of his admirers credited him with, Edison’s real accomplishments were astonishing enough. With 1093 patents to his name, he was the most productive inventor in the history of the United States, and possibly the most productive inventor in the history of the human race.”\n\nChapter 12 gives us the history of “Thomson and Alternating Current.” Elihu Thomson was born in England and went to Philadelphia as a small boy. He invented arc welding and revived this invention “eight years later, when alternating-current generators were available, he revived the invention.” On page 201 Sprague tells us ” Although Edison was the most prolific inventor in the history of the republic, Thomson was perhaps the second most productive, with 692 patents.” Sprague thought Thomson should be more well known: “In his contributions to the electrical revolution, he was but little behind Edison; yet for every American who knows about Thomson, thousands have heard of Edison. “From pages 203-208 Sprague writes about Nikola Tesla. Despite his brilliance, Sprague saw Tesla as the “Mad Scientist” type who made “life interesting” for all of those around him. Reading this now, I caught a distinct whiff of the exasperation Sprague felt when he wrote about HPL. Both Lovecraft and Tesla were brilliant men, geniuses, who had absolutely no common sense or rudimentary survival skills. Tesla lost millions of dollars because he had no business sense, and in 1912 he turned down the joint Nobel Prize with Edison because “it was wrong, said he, that he, the great scientific discoverer, should be bracketed with a mere tinkerer like Edison.” Sprague concludes by telling us that “Tesla ran his affairs in a way that makes such unworldly incompetents as John Fitch and Charles Goodyear look like prudent and thrifty businessmen.”\n\nChapter 13 tells us about “Selden and the automobile.” Sprague reminds us that “The modern automobile is a combination of many inventions. “We read about the adventures and misadventures of George Baldwin Selden. Selden was a brilliant man but another of the many people in this book who were “Impatient and irascible.” Henry Ford perfected the production line, so that automobiles could be rationally mass produced.\n\nChapter 14 relates the story of “Langley, the Wrights, and Flying.” You are impressed yet again by the sheer hard work and inventiveness of the Wright Brothers and many others as they strived to build flying machines that in the beginning were very dangerous to use. Sprague points out that the basic reason that Samuel Langley failed where the Wrights succeeded was that the Wrights started out with glider planes, learning to fly and control the planes before attaching an engine. Langley tried to build a powered plane without really learning the practical art of flying a plane. “But that’s the wisdom of hindsight.” Orville Wright lived to see the B-29 drop atomic bombs on Japan. Sprague tells us that “One factor in their success was the intelligent ways in which they attacked their problem, first mastering all that was known of aeronautics in their time and then going on from there, step by logical step.”\n\nChapter 15 tells us of “Fessenden, De Forest, and Radio.” There were many “fathers” of the radio, but Sprague singles out Reginald Fessenden as “the father of radio broadcasting.” I was again struck by how competitive and irascible and non-compromising Fessenden and De Forest and Edwin Armstrong were. All of them were brilliant, creative men, but they wasted a lot of time quarreling with other inventors and having to take out expensive lawsuits. Armstrong, who basically invented FM radio, committed suicide “without the cause being clear or apparent.”\n\nSprague concludes this splendid volume with “The End of the Heroic Age” in Chapter 16. After WW1 inventions came more often out of company run labs and the heroic inventors generally became parts of huge teams. Research and Development has multiplied a thousand-fold since the 19th century and huge amounts of money are now spent on all sorts of research. Sprague also points out that “many inventors are ornery individualists by nature, the very opposite of the ‘organization man.’ To such people, fitting themselves into a corporate mold and practicing teamwork and togetherness are apt to be particularly irksome.”\n\nEven though this book was written in 1960, it ages well as Sprague stopped the history at about WW1. He wrote, for instance, that in 1960 there were 19 underwater transAtlantic phone cables. I recently read there are now ten cables still in use. Re-reading this book after many years was a real pleasure. I have come to see this book as a sequel to The Ancient Engineers. If you can find a copy of this volume or the later Barnes and Noble reprint be sure to grab it!\n\nWhen Sprague autographed this book for me, he wrote “This would have been a much better book with pictures.” I guess he ran into the same penny pinching he did with The Great Monkey Trial, where the publisher was trying to keep costs down by not including any photographs.\n\nSprague gives you a master class on inventing and how many of the things we take for granted work. This is another book by Sprague that makes you see the world in a different way. I consider this review to be a small supplement to Brian’s masterly review, but I hope it expresses some of the pleasure I think that Sprague took in writing it. Enjoy!!\n\nby Brian Kunde\n\nThis is a book that has been on my peripheral radar for some years. Recently it showed up on Gary’s radar as well, and he suggested I might like to review it. That stirred my interest enough to order and read it, and here we are.\n\nRocket to the Morgue, first issued in hardcover by Duell, Sloan and Pearce in 1942, is a mystery novel and roman à clef, originally published as by “H. H. Holmes,” a pseudonym for author and editor Anthony Boucher, which itself is a pseudonym for William Anthony Parker White (1911-1968). He did well to disguise himself, given the studied blandness of his real name—and his own appearance under his more usual pseudonym as a character in his own novel! As Boucher he became a prominent mystery and science fiction author, and even more prominent editor, who co-founded and long edited The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, a periodical that has endured to this day. Most of which was still in the future when he wrote this book.\n\nThe book was reissued in paperback by Phantom Mystery in the same year as the hardcover, and in the pulp magazine Two Complete Detective Books for March 1944, both appearances retaining the Holmes pseudonym. Later paperback editions, from Dell Books in 1952, Pyramid Books in October 1967 and January 1975, and International Polygonics Ltd. In May 1988, dropped the pretense and were issued as by Boucher.\n\nThe current edition, also as by Boucher, was published in hardcover, trade paperback, and e-book by Penzler Publishers in July 2019. A prefatory “Cast of Characters” and an afterword by the author were added to the text in the Dell versions; the former seems to have subsequently been dropped, but the latter was retained in subsequent editions. The Penzler edition adds an introduction by F. Paul Wilson. Other prefatory materials, presumably common to all editions, are a Who’s Who entry for a fictional writer, Fowler Foulkes, an assessment of the man from an equally fictional biography on him, and a quote from one of his works, again fictional, attributed to his most famous character, Dr. Derringer; “Eliminated the impossible. Then if nothing remains, some part of the ‘impossible’ must be possible.” All of these help set the scene for the story that follows.\n\nThe novel proper is set amid the society of Los Angeles speculative fiction authors and fans some eighty-to-ninety years back, in the “Golden Age of Science Fiction,” when editor John W. Campbell was remaking the field and authors like Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, A. E. Van Vogt, and L. Sprague de Camp rose to meet the challenge. Specifically, it involves the literary circle of Heinlein himself, the “Mañana Literary Society,” with various members appearing as characters, either in their own personas or in lightly fictionalized guise. Mostly as possible suspects in a series of murderous attempts on the life of a local luminary. Boucher, incidentally, dedicated his book to “The Mañana Literary Society and in particular for ROBERT HEINLEIN and CLEVE CARTMILL.”\n\nOther characters are just characters. These include our sleuths, police lt. detective Terrence Marshall, and the nun Sister Ursula, his partner in crime solving in all but name, as well as, in their close circle, Marshall’s wife Leona, writer Matt Duncan, and Duncan’s wife Concha. F. Paul Wilson wastes some of his intro wondering who Duncan “really” was, but he’s barking up the wrong tree; Rocket to the Morgue is the sequel to another Boucher mystery, Nine Times Nine, from which all five of these characters are derived. Duncan, in other words, was likely an original character, based on no one. Nine Times Nine, incidentally, having underwhelmed the critics, was not as durable as its sequel, and is currently in “print” only as an e-book.\n\nEncountering the story’s various other characters and trying to puzzle out who they “really” are, is great fun, and likely has helped keep this book in print from that time to this. Some of them are actually pre-revealed for us in Wilson’s introduction and Boucher’s afterword. Though Boucher covers himself against libel by claiming “no character in this novel is based specifically on any actual writer—nor is any character quite devoid of some factual basis.” Take this with a grain of salt. Each actually seems based primarily on one actual writer, with perhaps a few superficial traits borrowed from others. (The Heinlein character, for instance, is paired with a wife who is also a writer, which neither of his actual wives was.) Boucher also pads out his character list by representing pseudonyms used by several real authors as separate people.\n\nThe Los Angeles group was far from SF’s center of gravity—that was New York—so it may have a slightly unfamiliar, even provincial air even to fans well versed in the era. But it included some big names—not just Heinlein himself, but Jack Williamson, L. Ron Hubbard, and Cleve Cartmill, whose prescient story about atomic power put the U.S. government in a panic that someone had been leaking classified data on the Manhattan Project. Not to mention such hangers-on as Jack Parsons, notorious rocket enthusiast and occultist. Boucher, then a peripheral but enthusiastic newbie in the field, did his best to portray the group and how it functioned accurately, and his portrait is like a window into that world.\n\nReaders who have enjoyed the fictionalized versions of the Trap Door Spiders, the New York literary and dining society founded by Fletcher Pratt, will also find Boucher’s novel congenial. Those unfortunates yet to encounter these can seek them out in the “Seven Strangers” appearing in L. Sprague de Camp’s historical novel The Bronze God of Rhodes, and (more closely represented) in Isaac Asimov’s series of “Black Widowers” mysteries.\n\nBut Rocket to the Morgue is more than just a look into a bygone world. It’s also a good mystery. It revolves around deceased author Fowler Foulks, creator of the beloved SF character Dr. Derringer (both discussed above, but who exist, alas, only between the covers of Boucher’s novel). Foulks is envisioned as having done for SF with Derringer what Sir Arthur Conan Doyle did for detective fiction with Sherlock Holmes, While Boucher nowhere says so explicitly, Derringer is plainly modeled physically on Doyle’s Professor Challenger of The Lost World and The Poison Belt fame—though Derringer is seen as having made a much bigger splash. And Foulks? He’s a stand-in for Doyle himself!\n\nAt the time of the novel, however, Foulks is ten years in his grave, and Derringer, along with his other literary properties, is now managed by the great man’s son and heir Hillary Foulks. Hillary controls the rights to them with an iron fist. Want to include quotes from Foulks as chapter headings in your own novel? Continue the Derringer saga with pastiche fiction? Transcribe the Derringer stories into Braille? Then be prepared to pay through the nose for the privilege. Though you may not expect to; the younger Foulks represents the fee as nominal, which, from his privileged perspective, it likely is. Only when you’ve already put in the work and can never recover the time will you likely discover it is actually inordinate. That Hillary is a supercilious, self-important, self-serving and annoying twit adds insult to the injury. Through no fault of his own (as he sees it), he has made enemies right and left. To know him is to hate him.\n\nAnd it seems that someone who hates him is now trying to kill him. Someone who, on the rare occasions he is seen, appears to be the spitting image of none other than … Dr. Derringer.\n\nWe are told there have been several attempts on Hillary’s life. A speeding vehicle that nearly struck him. A brick falling from a construction site that almost brained him. A gift box of chocolates poisoned with arsenic. A bomb sent to his residence at the very moment Lt. Detective Marshall, there to investigate another case, happens to be visiting. And, soon enough—a nearly fatal stabbing in a locked room no one could possibly have entered and left unseen. Then the rocket of the title. And, finally, another impossible stabbing in the same locked room as the first, which—but that, you’ll have to find out for yourself. You wouldn’t want me to spoil everything, would you?\n\nBoucher is almost as generous with his deaths as he is with his attempts. Over the course of the novel, three people die. The first is a “floater,” as Marshall calls him, a transient of no evident interest or importance, but whose death still must be investigated. It is this death that first brings him, seemingly by chance, into contact with Hillary and the Conspiracy Against Him. (He soon discovers all roads lead to Hillary.) The second death is the poor fellow who is figuratively and to some degree literally rocketed to the morgue, which appears incidental, but which, as the title implies, turns out to be the most important one. The third, a kind of ironic coda to the whole series, appears to be the most important one, and certainly helps make sense of the whole train of events, but mainly serves to convert the tragicomedy of the plot into tragi-farce. Which is wholly appropriate for a fun story which regrettably proves fatal to three of its characters.\n\nBoucher plays fair. All the clues (which he calls “clews”) are patiently set out for us, and, in the end, all are put together by the detective and his associate sleuth to arrive at the inevitable conclusion. Which is not at all as it has appeared. The plot is convoluted and fiendish, and, it’s safe to say, will not be figured out by the reader in advance of the denouement.\n\nAll in all, a delightful mystery. If marred at all, it from an overdependence on a genetic anomaly as a plot point, which Boucher likes a little too much. Enough that he pushes it just past the point of credibility at the very end. Unnecessarily so, since by that time it has already accomplished all that was required of it.\n\nYou will note that I have not, by and large, revealed the names or true identities of the various tuckerized characters with which the narrative is spiced. People have been playing the “who is it?” game for generations, now, and I wouldn’t want to spoil that game for you. It’s true that some matches are obvious (introducer F. Paul Wilson gets most of these), but others aren’t. Even some of the character models have been subject to confusion as to whether they are in or out. For instance, a number of people over the years have counted L. Sprague de Camp among the tuckerized, including the man himself. As far as I can tell, he isn’t. While he was indeed a resident of Southern California for several years, it was well before the formation of the community of SF authors and fans there—and, moreover, before he was one of them. He did know most of the members of that community but was not among them—certainly not during the period of which Boucher writes. He is referenced once (under his real name) in a discussion of alternate universe fiction, but that’s it. Unless, just maybe, he has been conflated with the similarly named L. Ron Hubbard in the person of one of the novel’s less pleasant characters.\n\nThat said, there’s one fellow who warrants further discussion—because in his case, life imitated art. Just as his fictional self was at the center of the spectacular death for which the novel is named, in later years his true self would be at the center of another spectacular death; his own. I refer Jack Parsons, rocket enthusiast, egotist, hedonist, cultist and occultist, acolyte of Aleister Crowley, friend, rival and victim of L. Ron Hubbard, and all-around weird guy. He made a strong impression on those who met him; de Camp, like Boucher, would base one of his fictional characters on him (Courtney James, in “A Gun for Dinosaur” (1956)). Neither of the fictional versions is anywhere near as strange as was the actual man. As for his death, he was fatally wounded while working with explosives in June 1952. Officially, the event was attributed to an accident caused by personal carelessness; unofficially, speculation has ranged from murderous conspiracy to assassination to miscarried magical rite to suicide.\n\nDe Camp, who was on the wrong coast when it happened, was interested enough to query his friend and fellow-SF author Jack Williamson; his postcards indicate some of the stories going around at the time:\n\nAnd his fascination continued, as witness these missives from 1975 and 1980:\n\nYou should read this book. You should play Boucher’s author game, and hunt up the works of the real life counterparts of his characters. Find out about Cleve Cartmill and Jack Parsons. Rocket to the Morgue is a gateway to all sorts of fun!\n\n#\n\n(3/17-19,23, 5/13/24)\n\nby Vincent N. Darlage, Ph.D.\n\n“‘Listen, my lord. I was a great sorcerer in the south. Men spoke of Thoth-amon as they spoke of Rammon. King Ctesphon of Stygia gave me great honor, casting down the magicians from the high places to exalt me above them. They hated me, but they feared me, for I controlled beings from outside which came at my call and did my bidding. By Set, mine enemy knew not the hour when he might awake at midnight to feel the taloned fingers of a nameless horror at his throat! I did dark and terrible magic with the Serpent Ring of Set, which I found in a nighted tomb a league beneath the earth, forgotten before the first man crawled out of the slimy sea.”\n\nRobert E. Howard, “The Phoenix on the Sword”\n\nThoth-amon is commonly considered Conan’s arch-enemy, but in Robert E. Howard’s stories, he simply was not. Yes, he was in “Phoenix on the Sword,” the first Conan story; however, he wasn’t trying to kill Conan. He didn’t give a shit about Conan. Thoth-amon wanted to kill Ascalante. The only reason Conan was in danger was because of the last thing Thoth-amon said to his baboon-like demon, “and all with him!”\n\nThoth-amon was the slave of Ascalante and when he found his Ring again, he wanted Ascalente dead. And the “all with him” was just icing on the cake. With this story we find a wonderful antagonist, and his attack was about his enslaver. That his enslaver was attacking Conan at the time was incidental. I reject the idea that Thoth-amon considered Conan an enemy at all.\n\nHowever, my opinion doesn’t matter at all. The world turns in its own way regardless of my opinions on just about any matter. Thus, it turns with Thoth-amon, who would, in due course, become Conan’s nemesis in pop-culture.\n\nThe Phoenix on the Sword\n\n“Thoth-amon’s eyes narrowed. For all his iron-self-control, he was near bursting with long pent-up shame, hate and rage, ready to take any sort of a desperate chance. What he did not reckon on was the fact that Dion saw him, not as a human being with a brain and a wit, but simply a slave, and as such, a creature beneath notice.”\n\nRobert E. Howard, “The Phoenix on the Sword”\n\nThoth-amon first appeared in “The Phoenix on the Sword.” It’s also the first Conan story, and well known as a rewrite of an unsold King Kull story, “By This Axe I Rule.” The Kull story did not have Thoth-amon in it, nor counterpart to the sorcerer-turned-slave. There was no demon of the Ring or anything of the sort. These elements would be added only in the Conan version of the story, an addition of supernatural elements needed for Weird Tales.\n\nAs I mentioned in the introduction, Thoth-amon is not angry with Conan nor is he Conan’s opponent in “The Phoenix on the Sword.” He is a slave of Ascalante. He was once a powerful sorcerer and priest in Stygia, but he lost his precious Serpent Ring of Set – which weakened him and allowed rival priests to overthrow him and sell him into slavery. Somehow Dion, the fat baron of Attalus, bought the Serpent Ring from a thief and considered it a good luck charm. Thoth-amon slew Dion, took back his ring, and summoned the haunter of the Ring to slay his enslaver, Ascalante. That King Conan was in the room with Ascalante was mere happenstance.\n\nThoth-amon is shown to be an intelligent observer and a wise advisor. Whenever he is under another’s power, whether through sorcery or blackmail, he is always careful to gain leverage and gather magical links to one day turn the tables on his oppressor; in this story he kept one of Ascalante’s sandals with him. When he makes an enemy, he is unlikely to rest until that enemy is painfully dead. “The Phoenix on the Sword” also establishes that Thoth-amon needs his Ring to be powerful. When it was stolen, he was overthrown by others. One wonders what became of Thoth-amon when the fiend was slain by Conan – if it truly was slain.\n\nThe God in the Bowl\n\n“’I found a symbol on the bottom of the Bowl!’ chattered Promero. ‘Not an ancient hieroglyphic, but a symbol recently carved! The mark of Thoth-amon, the Stygian sorcerer, Kalanthes’ deadly foe!’”\n\nRobert E. Howard, “The God in the Bowl”\n\nThoth-amon is mentioned again in “The God in the Bowl,” identified as the deadly foe of Kalanthes, the priest of Ibis. Again, he is not after Conan, but someone else entirely (the afore-mentioned Kalanthes). This story is in Conan’s youth. “The Phoenix on the Sword” is in Conan’s middle years. An REH purist would not find any other interactions between Conan and Thoth-amon, and wouldn’t consider Thoth-amon to be Conan’s greatest enemy. Conan and Thoth-amon don’t even meet in any Robert E. Howard story.\n\nThe Hour of the Dragon\n\n“’Men say that he has opposed Thoth-amon, who is the master of all priests of Set, and dwells in Luxur, and that Thutothmes seeks hidden power to overthrow the Great One. But who am I to say? When priests war with one another a common man can but lie on his belly and hope neither treads upon him.’”\n\nRobert E. Howard, The Hour of the Dragon\n\nThoth-amon does not appear in The Hour of the Dragon, but he is mentioned. “Only occultists high in the mazes of the hideous Black Ring possessed the power of the black hand that dealt death by its touch; and only such a man would dare defy Thoth-Amon, whom the western world knew only as a figure of terror and myth.” Thoth-amon is a monster in Stygia, and it takes someone of great power to openly defy him. Thutothmes of Khemi is such a someone. He discusses Thoth-amon in more detail in the following quote:\n\n“Ask me not how I, Thutothmes of Khemi and the Night, heard the word before Thoth-Amon who calls himself prince of all wizards. There are secrets not meet for such ears even as yours, and Thoth-Amon is not the only lord of the Black Ring.\n\n“I knew, and I went to meet the Heart which came southward. It was like a magnet which drew me, unerringly. From death to death it came, riding on a river of human blood. Blood feeds it, blood draws it. Its power is greatest when there is blood on the hands that grasp it, when it is wrested by slaughter from its holder. Wherever it gleams, blood is spilt and kingdoms totter, and the forces of nature are put in turmoil. “And here I stand, the master of the Heart, and have summoned you to come secretly, who are faithful to me, to share in the black kingdom that shall be. Tonight you shall witness the breaking of Thoth-Amon’s chains which enslave us, and the birth of empire.”\n\nHowever, these three Conan stories were not the only times Robert E. Howard wrote of Thoth-amon…\n\nMarchers of Valhalla (Draft)\n\n“Listen, and I will tell you!” she cried, hitching toward me on her knees and catching at the skirt of my tunic. “Only listen, and then grant me the little thing I ask! I am Ishtar, a daughter of a king in dim Lemuria, which the sea gulped so long ago. Thoth-amon, the sorcerer of Stygia, hated my father, and to spite him, he put the curse on me of Life ever-lasting!”\n\nRobert E. Howard, Marchers of Valhalla (Draft)\n\nIn one of the drafts of Marchers of Valhalla, Robert E. Howard references Thoth-amon, the sorcerer of Stygia. In this draft, Ishtar claims Thoth-amon had the ability to curse people with eternal life, and that she was the recipient of this curse.\n\nThe Haunter of the Ring\n\n“’I knew as soon as I saw the ring on Evelyn Gordon’s finger; the ring she could not remove; the ancient and accursed ring of Thoth-amon, handed down by foul cults of sorcerers since the days of forgotten Stygia.’”\n\nRobert E. Howard, “The Haunter of the Ring”\n\nWhen I discovered “The Haunter of the Ring,” I was beyond surprised. That story mesmerized me. It’s probably most easily found in The Horror Stories of Robert E. Howard, the Del Rey edition, page 410. For me, I discovered it with Beyond the Borders, Baen, October 1996. Unlike most of the stories involving Thoth-amon, this one takes place in the 1920s-1930s. John Kirowan’s friend, James Gordon, has arrived, with a tale of a mysterious ring, possibly found in Hungary, that was sent to his wife, Evelyn. She cannot get this ring off her finger. It is described as “copper, made like a scaly snake coiled three times, with its tail in its mouth and yellow jewels for eyes.”\n\nThe ring causes her to dream of a horrible faceless black thing that mumbles and paws over her with apish hands… and during the day, she tries to kill her husband, Jim Gordon (not the police commissioner of Gotham, just the same name). Kirowan leads the narrator (Michael O’Donnel) to their enemy, Joseph Roelocke (aka Yosef Vrolok), a Hungarian with psychic powers who gave Evelyn the ring… a ring revealed to be Thoth-amon’s, which summons a demon more ferocious than all in Hell. Apparently, Conan didn’t kill the demon permanently, or Thoth-amon trapped another demon within it.\n\nThe fate of the ring is unclear, however. I suppose Kirowan was able to get it off Evelyn’s finger and then kept it, but where it lurks today, who can say? I think a story of it’s modern-day appearance would be FANTASTIC!\n\nConan the Buccaneer\n\n“The man was a dusky giant, with broad shoulders and aloof, hawklike features. From his shaven skull to his sandaled feet, his skin was a deep, rich brown. Black eyes glittered hypnotically from the depths of cavernous eye-sockets. He wore a simple white linen robe. The only ornament to be seen on his person was a copper-colored ring, in the form of a serpent that, making three turns around one finger of a muscular hand, held its tail in its jaws.”\n\nL. Sprague de Camp & Lin Carter, Conan the Buccaneer\n\nI am not here to debate the merits or demerits of L. Sprague de Camp or Lin Carter. I was a teenager when I discovered the Ace/Lancer Conan series, and they included pastiches… and I enjoyed those pastiches when I was younger. At the end of Chapter One, a character named Menkara goes to seek Thoth-Amon. L. Sprague de Camp followed Weird Tales editor Farnsworth Wright’s original edit and capitalized the “Amon” portion of the name, whereas Robert E. Howard (in his typescript) did not. Sometimes, de Camp and Carter (undoubtedly a typo) spell his name “Thoth-Ammon,” sometimes in adjacent paragraphs (page 32 of the Ace edition of “Conan the Buccaneer”). I’ll use the de Camp & Carter capitalization for their version of Thoth-Amon.\n\nThoth-Amon first appears in Chapter 8. He uses magic freely and easily, telekinetically moving things with the snap of his fingers. In Chapter 12, Thoth-Amon can search through the Akashic Plane for people. He appears again in Chapter 14, teleporting in to steal the Cobra Crown. He handwaves the Amazon queen to unconsciousness and teleports back again. His attitude toward Conan is simply, “Thoth-Amon regarded the Cimmerian buccaneer as but a minor annoyance, as one would a buzzing mosquito.”\n\nThoth-Amon becomes King of Zingara in Chapter 19, but it doesn’t last long, and Thoth-Amon destroys the Cobra Crown. Thoth-Amon turns invisible, uses his Serpent Ring to animate a tapestry, and escapes.\n\nThe Treasure of Tranicos\n\n“’He was Thoth-Amon of the Ring, in exile from his native Stygia. He had fled in the reign of King Mentupherra, and when Mentupherra died and Ctesphon ascended the ivory throne of Luxur, Thoth-Amon lingered in Kordava though he might have returned home, dunning me for the debt I owed him. But instead of paying him the moiety of my gains as I had promised, I denounced him to my own monarch, so that Thoth-Amon must needs willy-nilly return to Stygia in haste and stealth.’”\n\nL. Sprague de Camp, “The Treasure of Tranicos”\n\n“The Treasure of Tranicos” is an odd duck to say the least. The story behind how “The Black Stranger” became “Swords of the Red Brotherhood” and then became “The Treasure of Tranicos” is best left for other essays and has been covered many times. While Thoth-amon does not appear in REH’s original “The Black Stranger,” Thoth-Amon does appear in the de Camp-rewritten “The Treasure of Tranicos.”\n\nThoth-Amon is depicted as Valenso’s enemy in court. De Camp changed the text so the magician Valenso cheated wasn’t killed, but lived… and was none other than Thoth-Amon. Conan slays Thoth-Amon’s demon and supposed Thoth-Amon had slunk off to some Stygian tomb because “these wizards are a queer lot.” Ace also released an illustrated edition of the Treasure of Tranicos, and there is a pretty great picture of Thoth-Amon by Esteban Maroto on page 63.\n\nEven at this stage, Thoth-Amon is not Conan’s enemy per se. He’s always after someone else.\n\nConan of Aquilonia\n\n“Then the coil of writhing vapor that was Thoth-Amon’s spirit stiffened and writhed in Conan’s impalpable clutch. Thoth-Amon shrieked soundlessly – an awful, hollow cry of agony and despair. The bodiless thing melted in his grasp. It disintegrated and faded into the cold mists of the void.”\n\nL. Sprague de Camp & Lin Carter, “Shadows in the Skull”\n\nConan of Aquilonia was always an interesting book for me when I was young. Conan is older, and he has a son. This is the book where L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter really cemented Thoth-Amon as Conan’s nemesis.\n\nIn “The Witch of the Mists,” King Conan discovers that Thoth-Amon is behind the plot to kidnap Conan’s son, Conn.\n\nIn “Black Sphinx of Nebthu,” King Conan leads an army into Stygia, into the ancient city of Nebthu, to seek out Thoth-Amon. A druid kept Conan’s army basically invisible to Thoth-Amon’s magical sight. Conan knows Thoth-Amon was behind the demon that attacked in “Phoenix on the Sword.” For his part, Thoth-Amon recounts the events of “The God in the Bowl,” Conan the Buccaneer, “Treasure of Tranicos,” and “Phoenix on the Sword.” Thoth-Amon is surrounded by hundreds of wizards and acolytes. He can shoot green rays from his fingers to knock swords out of hands. Soon, the hundreds of wizards join Thoth-Amon in shooting green rays at Conan and his men, but the White Druid of Pictland defended them with his magic staff. When the druid started to falter, Conan produced the Heart of Ahriman. The Heart of Ahriman killed or drove mad the hundreds of wizards, but Thoth-Amon summoned a giant, demonic black sphinx which slaughtered Conan’s army, but vanished with the coming daylight. Thoth-Amon flees to Zembabwei.\n\nIn “Red Moon of Zembabwei,” Thoth-Amon meets with another ally, Nenaunir, a king and fellow wizard. Thoth-Amon captures Conan and Conn, but ultimately must flee southward on a wyvern. This leads into Shadows in the Skull, where Thoth-Amon takes refuge among a remnant colony of serpent-men. The life-force of Thoth-Amon battled the life-force of Conan. Conan and Conn, however, won the day, finally killing their foe.\n\nIn this book, Thoth-Amon is shown to use magic almost absent-mindedly, shooting green bolts of eldritch energy with ease. He is also shown to have sorcerous allies and a cult with hundreds of votaries.\n\nMarvel Comics\n\nMarvel Comics leaned into L. Sprague de Camp’s vision of Thoth-Amon as a nemesis for Conan. In their adaptation of “The God in the Bowl” in Conan the Barbarian (CtB) #7, Conan actually gets a visionary glimpse of Thoth-Amon, complete with curled ram’s horns as headgear. In CtB #43, Morophla is worried that Conan might be an assassin sent by Thoth-Amon. In CtB #89, Thoth-Amon is seen blasting apart a door and he takes on an advisory role in the rule of Ctesphon III. Thoth-Amon appears also in The Savage Sword of Conan (SSoC). SSoC #191-193 are notable because chronologically, this is the first time in the Marvel Universe that Conan and Thoth-Amon meet.\n\nOf course, Thoth-Amon appears in the various adaptations of “The Phoenix on the Sword,” Conan of Aquilonia, and Conan the Buccaneer. I prefer Thoth-Amon bald headed than with the ram’s horn headdress, but it is notable and easily identifiable. Thoth-Amon is generally portrayed as a bad-ass in the Marvel Comics. Effort is made to make him a mighty and fearsome foe.\n\nMarvel Comics ran a Thoth-Amon short story by Matt Forbeck called “The Fall of Thoth-Amon” in Age of Conan: Valeria #1-5. It is a very slight tale that more or less explains how Thoth-Amon lost his ring and became Ascalante’s slave.\n\nTor Novels\n\n“Tevek had met Thoth-Amon once, years hence in Nebthu, and that meeting had left a lasting impression. The raw essence of evil had pervaded the very air about Thoth-Amon, whose mere presence had cowed the haughty priests of Nebthu. Tevek himself had felt the cold fire of Thoth-Amon’s gaze, for the Stygian mage had questioned everyone at Nebthu regarding an ancient tome for which he searched.”\n\nSean A. Moore, Conan and the Grim Grey God\n\nThrough the 1980s and 1990s, Tor published 42 Conan pastiches (in 2004, they published a 43rd) of varying degrees of quality. A handful of these have appearances by Thoth-Amon. The Tor books used L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter’s preference of capitalizing the “Amon” and I will do so in this section as well.\n\nConan the Invincible by Robert Jordan gave Thoth-Amon a minor role. A Stygian sorcerer used a homunculus to basically call up Thoth-Amon and give him a progress report. Although I like the use of a homunculus, and it felt reasonably weird, I am generally not on board with writers using magic to duplicate modern conveniences, like telephones.\n\nConan the Valorous by John Maddox Roberts has Thoth-Amon appearing in Crom’s Cave beneath Ben Morgh. Hathor-Ka, another wizard, believed herself to be the equal to Thoth-Amon and comes to realize she was woefully mistaken. He then proceeds to teach her about magic. Thoth-Amon is also briefly mentioned in Conan and the Manhunters by John Maddox Roberts.\n\nConan and the Grim Grey God by Sean A. Moore gives Thoth-Amon a lot more to do. Thoth-Amon is seeking Eibon’s codices, and several other books of power, and the titular grim grey god. Thoth-Amon shoots green magical energy from his Ring, which is called the Black Ring in this book instead of the Serpent Ring. Thoth-Amon loans this Ring out to a necromancer, pointing out that he is still powerful even without it. He creates a candle that will kill this necromancer if the Ring is not returned in a fortnight. In this novel, Thoth-Amon is more about spreading the religion of Set and destroying rival religions than he is about personal power. At the end of the novel he escapes by teleporting away.\n\nAnok, Heretic of Stygia (Age of Conan Trilogy)\n\n“He had somehow expected a small, old, wizened figure of a man. But Thoth-Amon was tall, towering over Anok, nearly as tall as Teferi, and broader of shoulder. As he stepped towards them, he carried himself gracefully, having neither the swagger of a warrior, or the hesitant gait of an old-man.\n\nHe wore long, flowing robes of red and black, elaborately embroidered with gold thread, and on his seemingly hairless skull, he wore a skull-cap of mirror-polished metal. His face was angular and deeply chiseled, his nose long and hooked, his skin dark and gray, like cold ash from a fireplace. A pointed goatee framed his lipless mouth, and eyes like black marbles glinted from deep and shadowed sockets.\n\nHe smiled, and it was a terrible thing.”\n\nJ. Steven York, Heretic of Set\n\nIn 2006 or so, Ace came out with four trilogies for “The Age of Conan.” I read three of the four trilogies, and those three were abysmal. The trilogy that interests us here is the Anok, Heretic of Stygia trilogy. This trilogy is seriously marred, for although it supposedly takes place during the Hyborian age, it actually takes place in a fantasy world called Hyboria where everything is resolved by magic. Magic is so prevalent that one scene required a location in a “no-magic” zone – but of course magic is needed there to resolve the conflict of that scene, so the no-magic zone included a magic zone! Here’s my review of the third book that pretty much sums up the problems with the whole series:\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show/93418239\n\nHowever, regardless of how much I despise this trilogy, Thoth-Amon is in the series, so I’m going to discuss his appearance here. Thoth-Amon is mentioned several times in the story, usually referencing how Conan kicked his ass, but appears in Chapter 22 of Heretic of Set (Book 2 of the trilogy). Anok has reached Thoth-Amon’s castle. He meets Thoth-Amon where he learned the sorcerer was conspiring against Set with Ramsa. Thoth-Amon laughed because Anok feared gaining Corruption (which is a tangible thing the priests can measure and talk about). Anok battled Thoth-amon in a High Fantasy sorcerer’s duel. Anok lost and was sent to his villa. Thoth-Amon briefly returns in Chapter 23 of Venom of Luxur (Book 3 of the trilogy). Anok discovered Thoth-Amon at Luxur and that Anok is to be killed. Thoth-Amon is not a major character in the book, but his inclusion was kind of nifty.\n\nDark Horse Comics\n\nDarkhorse Comics gave Thoth-amon a more traditionally Egyptian style headdress, which I liked better than the Marvel Ram’s Horns.\n\nConan: The Book of Thoth gives Thoth-amon’s origin story. Thoth-amon grows up as a street-rat and, through nefarious means, manages to rise up through the ranks of the priesthood. He is depicted as thoroughly evil throughout.\n\nConan the Roleplaying Game (Mongoose Publishing)\n\nIan Sturrock created statistics for Thoth-amon in Mongoose Publishing’s The Scrolls of Skelos. The text states that the statistics reflect Thoth-amon without his ring, but he is still a 20th level Scholar and absolutely mighty. Interestingly, Ian Sturrock did not give Thoth-amon any levels in this prestige class. In the same volume, he also created a “Lord of the Black Ring” prestige class and outlined the Serpent Ring of Set for the game. This prestige class gives the character Demonologist as a class feature. Interestingly, Ian Sturrock did not give Thoth-amon any levels in this prestige class. I suspect that is because he intended to include Thoth-amon in the base game book, but it just didn’t happen that way.\n\nIn Stygia – Serpent of the South, I offered an alternative version of Thoth-amon, but for whatever reason, I decided not to give him levels in the Lord of the Black Ring prestige class. He’s a straight 20th level Scholar in that book. Although I do not remember, I suspect I did it that way because that is the way Ian Sturrock statted him. I just wanted to correct the notion that he was powerful without his Ring, so the Stygia book includes a much weaker version of the character at 10th level without his Ring, with all the negative effects of Obsession at play. I also wanted to add in new rules from Scrolls of Skelos and Stygia – Serpent of the South and improve upon Ian Sturrock’s description of Thoth-amon’s personality. I also worked on making Knowledge (religion) a more useful skill. In this book, characters could take ranks in their god’s “mysteries” instead of a generic “religion” check. These ranks would affect what the character could do and provide cult-specific benefits at various ranks.\n\nPresented below is my unpublished final version of Thoth-amon. Personally, any RPG statistics of Thoth-amon without making him considerably weaker without his ring is problematic, so I made sure to include Thoth-amon’s statistics without the Ring of Set. Even though you may or may not be interested in his game statistics, you might enjoy the character description.\n\nConan: Adventures in an Age Undreamed Of (Modiphius Entertainment)"
