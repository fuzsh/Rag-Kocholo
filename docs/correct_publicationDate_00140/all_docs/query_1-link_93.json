        "text": "\"Johnson uses attachment theory and object relations theory sensitively to explore the ways in which early responses to separation and loss influence writers' visions of art. The use of contemporary psychoanalytic theory is particularly valuable when exploring the literary and cultural implications of bereavement following World War One. To my knowledge, Johnson's book may well be the first to take this approach . Johnson writes clearly and gracefully...\" Jeffrey Berman, Professor of English, University at Albany, SUNY, USA\n\n\"In Mourning and Mysticism in First World War Literature and Beyond, George M. Johnson brings the literature of trauma and loss vividly to life. Johnson deftly reveals the illuminating ways in which a host of British writers drew upon their fascination with mysticism and spiritualism in order to fuel a literary corpus for the ages.\" Kenneth Womack, Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, Penn State Altoona, USA\n\n\"By resisting commonly held assumptions, Johnson demonstrates the value that mysticism held for literature and life in a post-World War I England experiencing a state of national mourning. In doing so, Johnson makes a revelatory contribution to our understanding of Edwardian and modernist literature.\" Andrew J. Kunka, Professor of English, University of South Carolina Sumter, USA"
