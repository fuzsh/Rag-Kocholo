Watson mentions keeping a bull pup but we never see any indication of it at Baker Street.

They dont show the contrast between them well.\n\nThe ideal would be anything better than that. Jude Law version was pretty good. Not too much or too little.\n\nI know errors and inconsistencies Doyle writing of them both. Frankly i dont care too much for Holmes tv,film versions often to really have much trouble with Dr.Watson. He is almost impossible to translate well to tv,film. He is the narrator mostly.\n\nI only like Brett and new modern Sherlock series. 99% of the times i care only for written series.\n\nThats why i created this thread and not tv,film thread.\n\nAas many times as I have gone through the complete series, I always notice something different each time. My last time through I did catch seem to read the Yellow Face for the first time. There were definitely some attitudes that didn't seem to be consistent with Victorian England. Another instance where Doyle was way ahead of his time.\n\nI have read his biography he fought for many social,radical issues for his times.\n\nI was surprised to see a social issue like that dealt with in Sherlock Holmes story. Usually in my fav 1800s literature you have to accept the old ways, a writer being a product of his times.\n\nAlso i liked the story because it showed it is one of several cases mentioned where Holmes theories was incorrect. Holmes has this unfair reputation of being machine like always correct, too brilliant in his ways. I have read stories where he wasnt quick enough in his work to catch the criminals, where they escaped him. Where he was wrong and missed his criminal.\n\nIt makes him even more interesting, human and it makes his scientific way of detecting more realistic when he is wrong in half dozen cases.\n\nI can read many of Doyle's stories again and again. Is there even one Sherlock Holmes story that is just a \"completists only need read this one\" affair, even if many of the best ones were written early? I also like two of the Professor Challenger stories, The Lost World and The Poison Belt quite a bit. \"The Captain of the Pole Star\" is a fine ghost story. \"The Lost Special\" was a good puzzle story.\n\nOn the other hand, there were a couple of mummy stories, I think, that weren't so great!\n\nIm starting to feel the same every new book,collection i read of Holmes im impressed by the consistent level of the stories. Great,good or at worst decent detective stories. Stories full of historical detail,vivid characters. I almost forget Sherlock himself when i read the stories i like how he builds detective stories of urban crime, social problems of his times.\n\nI have only read Grenadier Gerard story or two other than Holmes stories. I have The Lost World to read when i finish Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes collection.\n\nI'm also a fan of some of his Lost Worlds fiction and didn't mind his historical novel Sir Nigel.\n\nWhat are these? I read the novel the Lost World and loved it, didn't know it was part of a series?\n\nI'm enjoying the Adventures so far. I probably should've read the first two novels first, but it doesn't seem to have been a problem so far. I have read Baskervilles before and enjoyed it, even if I the ending/resolution gave me a bit of a laugh for recognizing it as the solution to almost every mystery Scooby and the gang ever solved.\n\nI was initially thrown off by my first few Holmes stories, thinking they'd play out like a parlour mystery I suppose, or Encyclopedia Brown... where the reader is given all the clues and can try to best the detective and solve along with him. Holmes really isn't like that and often pulls off his deductions by knowing some arcane or obscure bit of information most people would never have been able to guess.\n\nSo once I stopped trying to spot clues on my own I enjoyed them a lot more. It's really much more about the action and his interplay with those around him. I was surprised at how vibrant they are despite, as some have noted, the slower pace of some of the detecting conventions like carriages and couriers. Holmes is often donning costumes, involved in stakeouts, laying ambushes and various other proactive things. It's not the Christie-esque people standing around chatting until it's sorted that I was anticipating, which makes it a lot more fun.\n\nAs to Watson, I don't think he comes off as dim. Obviously, he's not as sharp as Holmes, but he seems less the standard devoted sidekick and more a bright albeit deliberate doctor that simply can't resist tagging along on his eccentric friend's adventures. In a way, it's Watson that makes Holmes a success by providing, in comic terms, a straight man to play off Holmes' more vibrant character. Holmes himself can often be arrogant and unlikeable and on his own would probably wear thin. Seeing him through Watson's eyes makes it easier to see past his faults and through to the excitement at the core of the stories.\n\nWhat are these? I read the novel the Lost World and loved it, didn't know it was part of a series?\n\nOh Yes there were a few novels and stories that fall into Doyle's Lost World canon starring Professor Raymond Chandler..and before you ask No I haven't read all of them and to date I like the original novel the most although Land Of Mist isn't bad. I've taken this off Wikipedia as it was handy to do so...in fact there is a list of several authors who have written Lost World fiction featuring Chandler if you look up the article on wiki. Lost Worlds it should be noted is a sub Genre of its own including fiction by other well known authors e.g Burroughs' The Land That Time Forgot.\n\nNovels\n\n1912 - The Lost World, which describes an expedition to a plateau in South America where prehistoric creatures including dinosaurs still survive.\n\n1913 - The Poison Belt, in which the earth passes through a cloud of poisonous ether.\n\n1926 - The Land of Mist, a story of the supernatural, reflecting the strong belief in Spiritualism Conan Doyle developed later in life.\n\nShort stories\n\n1928 - When the World Screamed, on Challenger's World Echinus theory.\n\n1929 - The Disintegration Machine, concerning the potentially-dangerous new invention by a scientist named Theodore Nemor."
