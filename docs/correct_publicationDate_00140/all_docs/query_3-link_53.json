        "text": "One aviator. Monsieur Santos-Dumont was attempting a high altitude balloon ascent (with oxygen) when the incident began, and also tried to stave off the effects. Unfortunately he ran out after five hours and collapsed. Amazingly he survived the experience, recovering consciousness with the remains of his balloon caught in a tree more than 250 miles from his last recorded position.\n\nAdditionally, at least one unidentified person remained conscious in Monte Carlo; someone entered the Casino, smashed several doors, cut through a steel grille, and stole gold and notes worth approximately eighty thousand pounds. No clues were found, and the money has never been traced.\n\nOnce the \"shock wave\" had passed the Earth, there may have been a period of reduced ether density, probably lasting about as long as the initial crisis, which slowed chemical reactions slightly, and would have deepened the comas of everyone who succumbed to the initial effect. Those who remained conscious reported a feeling of shock and deep melancholy, which would support this theory; unfortunately it might equally well be a natural result of their belief that most of the human race was dead. Unfortunately none of the unaffected were in a position to take spectrographs or make other observations that might support or disprove this hypothesis. If it is correct, the moment at which most of the sleepers awoke may have marked a return to normal ether densities.\n\nWhile it is natural to be interested in the fortunate individuals who stayed conscious during this crisis, it should not be forgotten that millions died. Confirmed figures from Europe and North America are as follows:\n\nDrowned2,200 Missing, believed killed [1]3,300 Starvation (especially infants)5,000 Killed aboard ships, trains, etc.7,250 Falls and other accidents14,500 Exposure and exposure-related illnesses [2]200,000 Fires and gas explosions2,850,500 Other causes [3]220,000 Total3,302,750\n\nMostly persons in isolated areas who were subsequently found to be missing, and persons whose exact whereabouts were unknown at the time of the incident and have not subsequently been traced. Probably includes drownings, falls, unidentified bodies, etc.\n\nIncludes many who died subsequent to the incident, and most of the children killed during the incident. Pneumonia deaths peaked in mid-September, and the final death toll by the end of the year exceeded 3.8 million.\n\nIncludes cardiac patients, suffocation while unconscious, allergic reaction to plant poisons, etc.\n\nFigures for Africa, China, South America, and other areas have not been analysed in such detail, but probably exceed ten million, with extreme dehydration a common cause of death in warmer areas.\n\nIn addition to this human tragedy, animal deaths included the drowning of most of the world's whales and dolphins, many thousands of elephants and rhinoceri (apparently killed by pneumonia; it is now known that these animals accumulate fluid in their lungs if they are anaesthetised for prolonged periods), and vast numbers of birds. Millions of sharks also died; the largest species must swim continuously to oxygenate their gills. Commercial whaling and shark fishing virtually ceased until the mid-1930s, when stocks had built up again, and the price of ivory tumbled as the tusks of the unfortunate elephants reached the markets of Europe and America.\n\nDespite the immensity of this disaster, there is reason to believe that this was a \"lucky\" escape. High ether densities have only been created in the laboratory on a minute scale, but the effects include acceleration of most chemical reactions. One possible result would be spontaneous combustion of most flammable materials, including human flesh. At even higher densities spontaneous nuclear fusion is theoretically possible, but has never been observed.\n\nGame Data\n\n\"Daturon\" acts as a poison, its effect varying with ether density. It is convenient to give this density a wholly arbitrary Effect number from 0 (normal) to 10 (the peak of the Poison Belt episode). Comparatively small amounts of oxygen reduce the Effect by 5.\n\nAt moderately high ether densities (Effect 1-5) the result is mild euphoria, mania, and eventually irrational rage. If MIND can overcome the Effect these symptoms are suppressed.\n\nAt higher densities (Effect 6 or more) these symptoms are supplemented by a feeling of choking and suffocation, followed by collapse. If BODY can overcome the Effect it is possible to stay conscious, but this must be re-rolled every round. Once unconscious, the body enters a cataleptic trance almost indistinguishable from death. This continues for approximately double the period of exposure to abnormal ether densities.\n\nWhile the Poison Belt episode was a one-off event, it is possible that a sufficiently evil genius might be able to duplicate the phenomenon, if only on a small scale. For example, it might be used to make the inhabitants of London or New York sleep during the robbery of the century (see The New Avengers TV series for an example of this idea) or to cover some much more sinister event (see The Midwich Cuckoos by John Wyndham, AKA Village Of The Damned). This should be difficult to arrange and phenomenally expensive.\n\nOther possibilities for ether density manipulation include a comparatively safe form of anaesthetic, generating a localised field of high ether density affecting the brain, and stun weapons.\n\nDevelopment of any of these devices should be extremely slow, requiring a long series of Scientist rolls against increasing Difficulty, laboratory facilities, and tools and components worth many thousands of pounds.\n\n4.2 The Strange Case of Theodore Nemor\n\nback to contents\n\n'You have heard both in Oriental magic and in Western occultism of the phenomenon of the apport when some object is suddenly brought from a distance and appears in a new place. How can such a thing be done save by the loosening of the molecules, their conveyance upon an etheric wave, and their reassembling, each exactly in its own place, drawn together by some irresistible law? That seems a fair analogy to that which is done by my machine.' [DM]\n\n'...a large whitewashed room with innumerable copper wires hanging in festoons from the ceiling, and a huge magnet balanced upon a pedestal. In front of this was what looked like a prism of glass, three feet in length and about a foot in diameter. To the right of it was a chair which rested upon a platform of zinc, and which had a burnished copper cap suspended above it. Both the cap and the chair had heavy wires attached to them, and at the side was a sort of ratchet with numbered slots and a handle covered with indiarubber which lay at present in the slot marked zero.' [DM]\n\nIn 1928 Theodore Nemor, a Latvian scientist, invented a disintegration machine (illustrated in 15_DISIN.GIF). Nemor showed the device to various potential customers, making objects disappear and reappear unharmed. His visitors included Edward Malone and Professor Challenger, who both saw a convincing demonstration; in fact, both were disintegrated for several minutes. At the end of the experiment they left Nemor working on the machine, which had given Challenger a mild electric shock. They were the last to see him, alive or dead. It seems likely that he accidentally disintegrated himself shortly after they left.\n\nLater that afternoon the police arrested three members of the Russian Ambassador's staff, who were trying to break into Nemor's flat. They claimed that Nemor had agreed to sell them his machine, and that they were simply acting out of concern for his safety, since he hadn't answered the door. They had no proof of their statement, apart from a contract which hadn't yet been signed. Since they had diplomatic immunity they could not be questioned in any depth. The only other visitors who could be traced were Malone and Challenger, who knew nothing of any contract, and a party from the German Embassy, which also claimed an option on the machine.\n\nActing on Challenger's advice, the Home Office impounded the machine pending Nemor's reappearance or proof of his death. Naturally this decision was unpopular, especially in Russia and Germany. It was even claimed that Challenger or Malone had murdered Nemor to keep his invention in Britain! Naturally there was nothing to support this extraordinary allegation. Home office pathologists spent some time checking the machine for clues, but found no forensic evidence. Eventually it was packed into several crates, consigned to a warehouse and (apparently) forgotten.\n\nWhile this story was allowed to circulate, the reality was very different. At the warehouse the crates were opened, filled with bricks, and resealed, and the machine was whisked off to Cambridge. Although the mechanism of disintegration remained a mystery, scientists soon understood how to control the process, and could make inanimate objects appear and disappear. Tests with rats, rabbits, and guinea pigs followed; the mortality rate was initially very high, but after several successes it was tried on dogs, monkeys, and a student volunteer. This was a mistake; all subsequently died, apparently starved to death. Their symptoms, and subsequent experiments, revealed the truth about Nemor's invention.\n\nWhile Nemor claimed that his machine could \"loosen molecules\" and dissolve them in the ether, this explanation was misleading. Normal matter contains innumerable electromagnetic fields. If they are forced into a common alignment, in one of the extra dimensions required by current etheric theory, the object affected disappears. Naturally the effect can only be temporary; unless the machine maintains its control, atoms start to spontaneously revert to their original state, and rematerialise. Since the Earth is constantly moving through the ether, this material is left behind in the Earth's wake. Rematerialisation is slow (most experiments suggest that 5-10% of an object rematerialises per hour), so a cloud of free atoms and particles forms over several hours. In the 1990s, with disintegration commonplace, a trail of tiny gas clouds has been detected telescopically (16_TRAIL.GIF), and the ionised gas molecules are a considerable nuisance to radio astronomers. Similar trails may possibly be a means of detecting advanced civilisations in nearby solar systems.\n\nNemor's real genius lay in the control mechanism, which can hold objects in the ether near the disintegrator, and postpone the gradual rematerialisation so long as power is available to maintain the disintegration field, or reverse the polarisation and recover the object intact. It is also possible to adjust the controls, fine-tuning them to leave behind a particular type of molecule (such as the keratin of hair and finger nails), or (as in the tragic Cambridge experiment) to materialise objects as stereoisomers, with their \"handedness\" reversed at the molecular level, so that foods and vitamins can't be absorbed, and many enzymes fail to function correctly.\n\nOne surprising discovery was the realisation that Nemor's device could never have become the weapon of mass destruction he envisaged. Power consumption is initially low, but increases with the third power of the distance between the electrodes, from a starting value of 150 watts at one foot. The voltage needed to initiate the effect rises even more steeply, with the fourth power of the distance, from a starting value of 27 volts at one foot. Finally, electrode surface area affects the speed with which the process can be initiated; beginning at 0.75 seconds for a 1ft square plate, the time rises with the square of surface area.\n\nThe table below shows approximate power and voltage requirements for disintegration between two 1 ft square electrodes at various distances:\n\nDistance Power Voltage Uses 6 in 20 W 6 V Industrial applications 1 ft 150 W 48 V 2 ft 1.2 KW 768 V Medical applications 3 ft 4 KW 4 KV 3.5 ft 6.4 KW 7.2 KV Nemor's prototype machine 4 ft 9.6 KW 12 KV 5 ft 19 KW 30 KV 6 ft 32 KW 62 KV 7 ft 52 KW 115 KV 8 ft 77 KW 197 KV 9 ft 110 KW 315 KV 10 ft 150 KW 480 KV 15 ft 506 KW 2.4 MV Stilton I (see below), 1935 20 ft 1.2 MW 7.7 MV 30 ft 4 MW 39 MV Stilton II, 1941 40 ft 9.6 MW 123 MV 50 ft 19 MW 300 MV 75 ft 63 MW 1,518 MV Theoretical limit in dry air 100 ft 150 MW 4,800 MV Theoretically possible in vacuum.\n\nRemember that the minimum period of power consumption is 0.75 seconds, for a small electrode; a 10 ft square electrode takes this time to 75 seconds! If the disintegrator is used to hold an object in the ether, rather than to destroy it, the power must be kept on indefinitely.\n\nWhile power consumption is an obvious problem, voltage actually sets the fundamental limits. At sufficiently high voltages air breaks down and conducts electricity; this \"breakdown voltage\" is about 900,000 V per foot. Voltage per foot rises above this level when the electrodes are a little over 75ft apart. To make matters worse, moisture considerably reduces the arcing voltage for any given distance. In practice this means that 30 ft is the maximum practical distance in a moist country like Britain, even on a dry day; it is almost impossible to produce the effect over water, except at very short distances.\n\nPutting these facts together, it is comparatively easy to build a small disintegrator with a gap of three or four feet, as demonstrated by Nemor. Increasing the surface area of the plates, or the distance between them, greatly increases power consumption and voltage requirements. Unfortunately restricting the size of the plates also leads to problems; theoretically a needle electrode would use virtually no power regardless of distance, in practice sharp electrodes \"leak\" voltage, and are useless in all but the smallest of applications, at comparatively low voltages.\n\nNaturally these experiments were conducted under conditions of great secrecy. As soon as Nemor's device was duplicated, the original was carefully disabled and returned to storage.\n\n'Once the mechanics of Nemor's process were understood, work began on the production of a weapon based on the disintegration principle. With the possible exception of the infamous \"Panjandrum\", this was Britain's least successful secret weapon, and its history is an object lesson in how not to design military hardware.'\n\n[The Secret War: BBC TV 1978]\n\nSeveral years passed, and a series of abortive experiments proved that there was no easy way around the limitations of the disintegrator. By 1935 it was becoming increasingly apparent that another European war was likely. Knowing that it would be almost impossible to field the disintegration effect as an offensive weapon, and possibly worried about government reaction if the research was fruitless, scientists suggested that it might be deployed defensively as a form of booby-trap, set up at strategic points where it could impede an invasion force. Theoretically the machine might be used to generate a momentary razor-thin \"plane\" of disintegration between two wires, one buried under a road and the other on telegraph poles above it. If timing was right this would act like an irresistible cheese wire, cutting troops and tanks into thin slices. By a process of word association this concept was eventually called \"Stilton\". The 1935 prototype used a wire suspended 15 ft above a road; the generator and other components of the system were housed in a large \"cottage\" nearby.\n\nUnfortunately there were some fundamental flaws in this idea. Most notably, if the wires were too thin they radiated electrons, as described above, and \"leaked\" voltage almost as fast as it could be supplied. With thick wires this problem was reduced but the increased surface area of the wires increased power requirements. Also any large metal mass (such as a tank) between the wires effectively reduced the distance between them. This made it much more likely that the air breakdown voltage would be exceeded; the result was a violent shower of sparks, usually causing minor damage to the target, and severe damage to the generators and capacitors needed to produce the incredibly violent pulse of electricity in the first place.\n\nIt was also difficult to imagine a German invasion force ignoring a cottage that hummed loudly and was surrounded by thinly sliced tanks and soldiers. Despite this obvious drawback, 29 more cottages were purchased or built at strategic locations along the South coast, ready to receive Stilton installations when the system was perfected. As in many military projects, this took longer, and cost much more money, than was expected.\n\nStilton II, the 1941 production prototype, used two vertical electrodes disguised as telegraph posts. While new generators made it possible to increase the effective range to 30 ft on a dry day, any hint of mist or rain ensured that the only result was a spectacular shower of sparks. During tests on cloudy days the high voltage often led to an unexpected effect; the electrodes were struck by lightning. Camouflage was little more than a joke; the power needed for this system required four large diesel generators, which belched their fumes through the cottage chimney and could be heard at a distance of several hundred yards.\n\nEventually the awesome cost of this project came to the attention of the Prime Minister, who \"suggested\" a cheaper alternative; forget the disintegration effect, fill the cottages with explosives, and detonate them if an opportune target presented itself. Ultimately about half the cottages were prepared for this purpose; the remainder would have posed too great a risk to civilian homes, factories, or railway lines, and were eventually sold off as housing. The final epilogue to this story was the evacuation of Canvey Island, in the Thames estuary, in 1951; one of the cottages was somehow overlooked at the end of the war, and ignored until the local council approached the Army for permission to demolish it. When a wrecking crew broke in, they found that it was packed with badly deteriorated explosives. Defusing them took nearly a week.\n\nSome associated events, which were previously covered by the Official Secrets Act, have recently been revealed. In 1944, by a series of \"accidents\" and \"errors\" now known to have been engineered by Kim Philby, the crates containing Nemor's machine were labelled as munitions and loaded onto a convoy bound for Russia, where they disappeared from view. There were fears that the Russians would repair the machine and somehow find a way to improve it, and in an unexpected way these fears were justified. In 1957, following several rumours of disintegration experiments in Siberia, a Soviet defector claimed that one of Russia's secret laboratory complexes had been destroyed by the machine. A few weeks later a U-2 flight discovered a perfectly smooth circular crater, approximately two miles wide and several hundred yards deep, where there had formerly been a high-security installation, previously thought to be a radar test site. While the Soviet scientists certainly repaired Nemor's machine and learned its secrets (Russian disintegration technology is on a par with that of Europe and America), they must have gone on to find a way around its limitations. Unfortunately the discovery apparently died with them, and records of the former USSR add little more to this story - the station simply disappeared three days after filing routine progress reports which contain no hints of a breakthrough.\n\n'\"This is an industrial disintegrator. It generates a microscopically fine beam of etheric force which can cut through anything - the slab of gold you lie on, or your body - with equal ease.\"\n\n\"Do you expect me to talk?\"\n\n\"No, Mister Bond, I expect you to die...\"'\n\n[Goldfinger, 1964]\n\nOnce the war was over, and it was apparent that disintegration was not likely to be an immediate cause of mass-destruction, thoughts turned to industrial uses. Disintegrators are very expensive, and require careful adjustment, but their operation can be very cheap, especially if there is no need to preserve the disintegrated object. With needle electrodes the disintegration field is extremely narrow, a perfect replacement for jig saws and many other industrial devices. Other models replace guillotines and some lathe tools; low power consumption, coolness, speed, and the completely smooth finish left by disintegration are the most obvious advantages, but elimination of oil jets and waste removal vacuum systems are also important. For obvious safety reasons, and because precise adjustments are needed if the electrodes are moved, they are usually fixed in place; the working material is moved between them. Despite the excesses of some spy fiction, truly mobile disintegrators are still very rare, and too cumbersome to be useful in crime or espionage.\n\nTypical prices in 1994 range from £12,500 for a one-inch narrow-beam cutter to £750,000 for the elaborate mobile systems used to manufacture ship's screws and turbines. In the latter case the cost is small compared to that of the industrial robots, hydraulic arms, and computers that are needed to manipulate the disintegration machine and the work piece.\n\nThe future of this technology largely depends on the degree to which it can be simplified, miniaturised, and made more portable. Despite more than sixty years of development, disintegrators are still expensive to build and bulky, and require extremely careful adjustment before they can be used. Mobile disintegrators are still uncommon; movement requires constant painstaking adjustment, usually under the control of powerful computers.\n\nSeveral power-tool manufacturers recently formed a consortium to develop practical hand-held disintegrators for catering and DIY work, which they hope to market in the early 21st century. Since research costs are likely to be very high, their initial models will probably be built around a common disintegration engine / computer package, with details such as case design and power pack life varying between manufacturers. Provided the price is low enough, most cutting tools could be replaced by disintegration systems, although safety is obviously a considerable problem. There is also the risk of their use by criminals; a tool that can cut through anything is a potential threat to society. Further miniaturisation should lead to replacements for electric razors, hair clippers, etc.\n\nThe chemical industry uses disintegration for cheap production of stereoisomers (such as antibiotics and pure enzymes), and for purification. By fine tuning it is possible to rotate an impure chemical into the ether, bring back only the desired ingredient, remove it from the field, then bring back the unwanted components for disposal or further processing, or leave them to disperse in the ether.\n\nOne obvious danger is the risk that fine-tuned disintegration might be used to separate isotopes from reactor fuel, as a cheap source of weapons-grade plutonium. Since the reverse of this process is common practice in the nuclear industry, which also finds disintegration the ideal way to dispose of nuclear waste, there is little reason for complacency. These machines are still heavily restricted, and must be built to perform one particular type of separation, with no facility for adjustment for different isotopes. They are controlled and inspected under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\n'\"You mean they left me in the ether for a hundred years? My library fines must be unbelievable!\"'\n\n[Sleeper, 1973]\n\nDisintegration has obvious medical applications, ranging from its use in surgery to the indefinite preservation of human life, by rotating subjects outside normal space and time.\n\nSurgical applications are still limited by the immobility of most disintegrators. No-one has developed a usable hand-held system; the control systems and servos needed for mobile units are much too bulky to be practical. To add to these problems, wounds made by disintegrators tend to bleed much more freely than those made by conventional surgical equipment, since blood vessels are neither crushed (as by cutting) or cauterised (as in the use of heated wires and other electrical instruments). Most hospitals keep a disintegrator for major amputations, since the effect is less traumatic than the use of a saw, but small-scale work is still out of the question. It is hoped that this will gradually change as smaller disintegrators are developed; they would be very useful for microsurgery.\n\nThe most important medical implication of disintegration is its potential for the indefinite preservation of human life. Patients can be disintegrated and \"held\" in the ether until it is possible to cure them, months or years after they would otherwise be dead. Naturally there are snags; each patient needs a separate disintegrator, which must be supplied with power until medical science has advanced to allow a cure. One Californian patient has been kept in the ether for more than nine years, another was recovered (and treated successfully) four years after disintegration. No side effects have been noted, but the per-patient cost is still about £100,000 per disintegrator (including backup power supplies) plus running expenses. As yet the procedure is not available through any public health service.\n\nThe legal status of disintegrated patients is debatable; America has accumulated the most civil and criminal case law on the subject, mostly related to estates and presumption of death, and it is often contradictory. Briefly, anyone intending to risk this procedure should make very sure that there is no objection from anyone that might be in a position to benefit from their estate, and that trust funds have been set up to cover all expenses. Disintegration cannot be used to evade arrest, America's Statute of Limitations, or the normal time limits on tax liability; this latter point is also law in Britain and most of Europe (but not Ireland). Switching off a disintegrator would presumably be murder, but such a case could be a minefield for the prosecution, who would have to prove that the victim (a) was alive when disintegrated, (b) could be recovered at any point until the moment the power was cut, (c) had not been recovered before power was cut, and (d) was irretrievably lost when power was cut.\n\nOne other medical application shows promise, which hasn't yet been realised. Theoretically it is possible to fine-tune a disintegrator to distinguish between living flesh and viruses, and leave the viruses in the ether while the patient is recovered. Experiments on these lines have been uniformly unsuccessful, but a considerable amount of funding is available via AIDS and cancer research organisations, and there is still hope that the problem will eventually be solved.\n\n'\"So, Skywalker, you have built your own ether-sabre. Your skills as a Jedi will soon be complete...\"'\n\n[Return Of The Jedi, 1983]\n\n'\"...Uh.. You see, Mister Tracy, by rotating all Virgil's molecules into the ether, I can make him ..uh.. disappear completely. If I change the focus of the ..uh.. projector it's possible to rematerialise him inside a locked room, even a bank vault.\"\n\n\"Great, Brains. It sure beats cutting in with torches. Now show me how you get him back.\"\n\n\"I'm still ..uh.. working on that...\"'\n\n[Thunderbirds, 'Peril In The Ether', 1967]\n\nThe future of disintegration seems bright, but a lot depends on the speed with which equipment becomes smaller, cheaper, and easier to use. There is slow progress in all these areas. A major limitation is still the need to produce the field between two electrodes, which means that it may never be possible to build a device equivalent to a hand-held electric drill. If this problem can be overcome, we may eventually see the hand-held disintegrators which are so common in science fiction novels and films, but most probably as tools, not weapons.\n\nOne use suggested by Nemor has not been achieved; there is still no practical way to use disintegration for travel on Earth. All attempts to link two machines and transfer matter between them have failed. To the great relief of police and security forces throughout the world, there also appears to be no way to use a single disintegrator to project matter to a remote location.\n\nGame Data\n\nAdventure fiction is full of horrendously dangerous inventions, which can usually be destroyed by killing their creator. There's a basic drawback to this idea; once something is known to be possible, reinventing it is usually easier than the original work.\n\nNemor developed the disintegrator in a world where the ether was known to exist, and must have drawn on prior work. Unless he somehow found an entirely new approach to etheric physics, he must have left a trail that any interested party could follow. With Nemor's machine left intact, eventual discovery of his secrets was certain. If it was destroyed, study of the books he owned, and any papers he published, would be invaluable clues.\n\nUnstoppable weapons sound good in fiction, but don't leave many options in an RPG. For the purposes of this worldbook, Nemor's puzzle was solved, but the solution was less destructive than he originally thought.\n\nAny new technology is bound to have a few spin-off applications. I've added later inventions which might appear in embryo in a campaign, or might be described in speculative articles of the period. In the time-frame suggested for a Challenger campaign, all of this technology is still in the future or has only been suggested in a few far-fetched magazine articles. Adventurers with an interest in science might encounter Nemor before his disappearance, or meet another scientist who has duplicated his machine or built something just a little more powerful. They might also uncover some hint of the highly secret British weapons program, or meet a charlatan who pretends that he has a working disintegrator.\n\nOne of the adventures includes an encounter with Nemor much earlier in his career.\n\n4.3 The Ether And Spiritualism - The Scientific View\n\nback to contents\n\n'\"The higher spirits .... are in very different zones of vibration. It is we who are near (the lower spirits) and can help them.\"' [LM:4]\n\n'\"...the natural body .... is dissolved at death, and the etheric or spiritual body .... survives and functions upon an etheric plane.\"' [LM:8]\n\n'...names buzzed in his etheric ears...' [LM:16]\n\n'\"...blast open a hole in the ether and go after them!\"\n\n\"Do you realise what we have here? The vital defence industry of the next millennium!\"'\n\n[Ghostbusters, 1984]\n\nPhysics uses a vocabulary which occasionally overlaps that of spiritualism. This overlap is most obvious in etheric physics, whose pioneers included such notable spiritualists as Sir Oliver Lodge. While most scientists now accept that a minority of mediums can produce real effects, such as materialisation and clairvoyance, there is still general disagreement about the mechanisms responsible for these effects, and especially about any supernatural involvement. Scientifically, the most widely accepted theory states that these so-called supernatural events are actually manifestations of the subconscious of the medium.\n\nSpiritualists claim that the afterlife is on a different \"plane of vibration\" to the physical universe. Since it is known that the ether exists in several extra dimensions, and vibrates to propagate electromagnetic energy, this may literally be true. The disintegrator shows that such \"planes\" might exist, occupying different spatial and temporal dimensions to our own, but all evidence suggests that they are not accessible by disintegration (although it has been claimed that time stops for the disintegrated because it is forbidden for the living to see the afterlife).\n\nIt is certain that ectoplasm and other materials summoned by materialisation mediums are drawn from the ether, returning to it when the concentration of the medium ends, inverting the means by which the Nemor disintegrator pushes matter into the ether. The classic proof was obtained by Rhine in the 1950s; a colleague used a Nemor disintegrator to destroy samples of wax impregnated with Carbon-14, while Rhine witnessed a materialisation medium produce ectoplasm in an adjoining room. Geiger counters detected a rise in radiation levels while the ectoplasm was present. Energy requirements for disintegration can be very low, and it is suspected that the corresponding materialisation process may be initiated by neural voltages; the fact that ectoplasm is usually produced as an extremely thin layer is highly suggestive. Most materialisation mediums have very bright Kirilian auras, which are related to the natural electrical potential of the body.\n\nTelepathy can certainly be explained etherically; by some means that is not yet apparent, brain waves are propagated through the ether and are picked up by especially sensitive minds. This may again be related to the body's electrical field.\n\nClairvoyance may also be explicable in terms of etheric physics. Light waves are carried by the ether, and it is possible that there is some \"leakage\" which is detectable by an attuned mind. Clairaudience cannot be explained so easily, but there is every reason to believe that it is usually a form of telepathic communication.\n\nMeanwhile any question of communication with the dead is at best questionable and at worst deliberate fraud.\n\nGame Data\n\nSpriritualism is covered in more depth in section 7; the above is the \"scientific\" viewpoint held by most non-spiritualists in this world. For game purposes ectoplasm is made up of loosely-associated matter pulled from the ether in the manner described above, and is held in our world purely by the will power of the medium; it is usually about as solid as thick smoke. Scientific opinion agrees that this can occur, but disagrees with spiritualism on the power responsible for its materialisation.\n\n4.4 Adventures In The Ether\n\nback to contents\n\nThe Man Who Broke The Bank...\n\n1913. During the Poison Belt episode the Casino at Monte Carlo was robbed of £80,000. Gendarmes know that the thief had access to oxygen and tools, including a hacksaw, crow bar, and sledge hammer, and must have spent several hours working on locks and doors. This strongly implies someone local, but unfortunately nobody seems to fill the bill; no garages or workshops are equipped with oxygen, and even the hospital doesn't yet have a supply. Obviously someone could have come in from outside the Principality, robbed the Casino, and left again before the great awakening - the area of the entire country is only about a square mile - but money is heavy, no vehicles are missing, and by chance the roads from Monaco were closed by a train wreck, a brush fire, and fallen cattle for the duration of the incident. It seems likely that the thief is a local, or was already in town when the crisis started, and that the money is still hidden somewhere in the Principality.\n\nThe adventurers happen to be in Monte Carlo at the time, and some odd circumstance (their equipment includes tools and welding gear, there is an oxygen tank for diving gear on their yacht, nobody remembers seeing them in town before the incident) has made them suspects. Monaco uses the Code Napoleon, and the accused must prove his innocence...\n\nThe Man Who Broke The Bank II\n\nAs above, except the adventurers are gentlemen thieves - and guilty as hell. Begin as people start to feel strange, on the morning of the crisis; you'll need to explain how the adventurers come to be in Monaco at the right moment, how they happen to have oxygen available (oxy-acetylene equipment is possibly a good starting point), and why they think of using it, but the actual mechanics of the robbery can probably be left to players, when they realise that the opportunity is there. Once the crime is committed, circumstances conspire to strand the adventurers in the town. How will they get the money out of Monaco? How will they evade the gendarmes? Make things really tough, and remember that Monaco uses French law, and has the guillotine ready for murderers. Useful references are the films Rififi, The Getaway, The Split, and Reservoir Dogs, and E.W. Hornungs \"Raffles\" stories.\n\nThe Sky Is Falling\n\nThe Poison Belt episode caused enormous insurance losses. Now (any time from 1913 onwards) one of the leading etheric physicists claims that the ether density is slowly increasing again. Is he mistaken? Is the world endangered? Why is someone systematically dumping insurance shares? The adventurers are 'Names', investors in one of the insurance syndicates that make up Lloyds of London. Like all Names they have agreed to unlimited personal liability if their syndicate runs into debt. They face ruin if there is another crisis that causes as much damage as the 1913 incident.\n\nCatch The Star Winds\n\nThe Earth moves through the ether at 1850 miles per second. Could it be possible to harness this motion as a limitless source of energy? An eccentric Belgian scientist claims that he has the key to this power, and will sell it to the highest bidder; the opening offer he's looking for is a hundred thousand pounds. Has he made a genuine breakthrough, or is it a case of mistaken ideas or deliberate fraud?\n\nNB: The title for this segment was suggested by an excellent novel by A. Bertram Chandler. See section 5.1 for some other ideas on direct use of the ether's energy.\n\nCatch The Star Winds II\n\nThe Earth and solar system move through the ether, but from our point of view it seems that an etheric gale is blowing past at 1850 miles per second. Ectoplasm is an interaction between our world and the ether; could it be generated mechanically, to allow the construction of a sailing ship of space? An ether sail needn't be efficient; a tiny fraction of etheric force would suffice, and might be easier to handle than the full gale. Tacking and other manoeuvres could be difficult, but with sufficient ingenuity anything is possible.\n\nForgotten Futures II contains details of a \"scientific romance solar system\" that might easily be adapted to the Challenger universe. The FF2 spaceship design rules can be used unchanged; simply assume that the engines described in its worldbook generate \"ether sails\", and that ships use a combination of the thrust of the ether and the pull of gravity to manoeuvre.\n\nFor more elaborately described (but somewhat different) ether spaceship technology see G.D.W.'s Space 1889 RPG. See also my article The D.M.'s Guide To The Galaxy, White Dwarf issue 26, and the novel Star Winds by Barrington J. Bayley [1978].\n\nThe Disintegrators\n\n\"Good afternoon, comrades. Two years ago a Latvian scientist named Theodore Nemor demonstrated a so-called disintegration machine to the representatives of various governments. After some negotiation he agreed to the proposals of our representatives, and consented to deliver the machine, and his personal knowledge of its operating principles, to our glorious Motherland.\n\n\"Unfortunately Nemor made the mistake of trusting reactionary elements, the so-called scientist Challenger and a running-dog journalist lackey, and was murdered by the British before he could fulfil his agreement. The machine was held by the capitalists, while their warmongering scientists attempted to discover its secrets. Evidently they failed, since the machine has recently been returned to storage in a warehouse on an army base outside London.\n\n\"Your mission, should you decide to accept, is to recover the disintegrator for our glorious Motherland. I trust, comrades, that anyone who does not wish to accept has developed a healthy appetite for salt...\"\n\nThe adventurers are Russian agents, and must cope with the exotic capitalist temptations of 1930 Britain (\"Look, Comrade, this tap has hot water in it!\"), as well as the army, burglar alarms, guard dogs, and any other complications a sadistic referee cares to add.\n\n5.0 The Living Planet\n\nback to contents\n\nToday everyone knows that our planet is alive; the evidence is overwhelming. In the 1920s things were very different. For its time Challenger's \"World Echidna\" theory was bizarre, and apparently insane. It just happened to be correct, a triumph of flawed logic that stumbled upon the right conclusions.\n\nChallenger reasoned that the Earth is a slightly flattened sphere, so that the distance from the Equator to the centre of the Earth is greater than the distance from either Pole to the centre of the Earth. If the core of the Earth were truly molten, the Poles would be hotter than the Equator; since they are not, the core cannot be molten. If the core is not molten, something else must cause earthquakes, volcanoes, and other geological phenomena.\n\nIt would be tedious to explain all the errors in this argument; by far the most important are the facts that the Poles are only slightly flattened, and that in any case temperature was supposed to be related to depth underground, not to distance from the centre of the Earth. Regardless of the inner nature of the Earth, the temperature of the surface is almost entirely a result of heat received from the Sun; the Poles are cold because they are at an angle to the Sun's rays, so that any given area receives much less heat than an equivalent area on the Equator.\n\nChallenger disliked the accepted theory, despite the fact that Maple White Land was created by volcanism, and looked for an alternative, deciding that the underground heat, volcanoes, earthquakes, and other effects must be caused by something comparatively close to the surface.\n\nHow Challenger came to believe that the underlying cause was life is a mystery; it is entirely possible that he started out with completely different ideas. One theory popular in psychic circles suggests that Challenger's intuition (in this and in several other instances) was in fact a form of extra-sensory perception, which led him to make wild but correct guesses from inadequate data. The first definite hint of life is a sketch in his notebooks, made some time in late 1928 or early 1929 (17_GLOBE.GIF). Whatever the truth, even his most trusted associates knew nothing of his ideas until the eventual discovery of the so-called 'twitching rock', a layer of grey scum-permeated stone, several hundred yards thick, which literally squirmed in response to hammer blows and drilling. The nature of this material, now known as Challengerite, is discussed in more detail below. Under it was the vulnerable inner structure, the living flesh of our planet. Where others might have proceeded slowly, taking samples and experimenting with progressively greater stimuli, Challenger boldly (and perhaps foolishly) decided to go all-out for an immediate reaction, and arranged to plunge a sharp artesian drill deep into the flesh of the World-Echidna.\n\nChallenger undoubtedly expected there to be some response; it is doubtful that even he guessed the full magnitude of what was to come. Mr. Peerless Jones has vividly described the discovery that the drill was about to collapse into the shaft, and the subsequent race to flee the eruption that followed [WS]. His account makes one assumption that may be inaccurate, and can never be checked; he says \"We had not gone thirty paces from the shaft when far down in the depths my iron dart shot into the nerve ganglion of old Mother Earth...\", but all that is really known is that the equipment seemed to be ready to fall when they were in the shaft, and that the Earth reacted approximately sixteen minutes later, the time needed to reach the surface from the bottom of Challenger's shaft. The equipment possibly collapsed well before they reached the surface, and the response may have taken some time to develop.\n\n\"...both of us were swept off our feet as by a cyclone and swirled along the grass, revolving round and round like two curling stones upon an ice rink. At the same time our ears were assailed by the most horrible yell that ever yet was heard.\" [WS]\n\nJones' summary of the results of the experiment simplifies some details. The first effect has been widely described as a shriek or roar, but an organism living in airless conditions several miles underground cannot plausibly have a mechanism for the production of sound. The noise was probably inanimate; the air in the shaft, eight miles deep, was suddenly compressed by pressure from below, and resonated as it passed through various choke points of the lift system. The result was a combination of infrasound and audible frequencies, which shook the area around the excavation and was heard at least thirty miles away.\n\n\"When several separate pellets are placed in a blow-pipe they still shoot forth in their order and separately from each other. So the fourteen lift cages appeared one after the other in the air...\" [WS]\n\nAs air left the shaft it blew out the lift cages, which crashed to earth in a radius of five to ten miles from the pit. Fortunately it was too early in the year for many holiday makers to be on the beaches between Worthing and Chichester, or casualties might have been very heavy. Miraculously no-one was hurt by any of the cages, although insurance companies in the area were inundated with claims for damage caused by flying debris. It has been estimated that if all were genuine there must have been several tons of scrap iron and tools lying on top of the lift cages. One particularly impudent claimant produced a piece of machinery which had supposedly smashed through the roof of his greenhouse; on close inspection, it was found to be part of an old mangle. One of the cages landed on power cables and blacked out part of Chichester. Four disappeared; three were subsequently found in the sea during mine sweeping operations in 1942-3, the last has never been located, but is probably somewhere under the coastal sands.\n\nThe geyser that followed consisted of an aromatic hydrocarbon material smelling like \"the distilled essence of skunk, garlic, cabbage, and old socks\", to quote one of the journalists it soaked. This material is believed to be the principal body fluid of the World-Echidna; its nature and functions are also described in more detail below. It is probable that the amount involved was relatively small, compared to the size of the shaft; the best estimates put it at five hundred to a thousand cubic yards, weighing nearly as many tons, but fortunately atomised into fine droplets by the time it returned to Earth. It is similar to the slime of Challengerite, which surrounded the base of the shaft, and it seems likely that it was released as part of the process that closed the shaft, then squeezed out like an enormous length of toothpaste as it collapsed.\n\nWithin hours every active volcano in Europe erupted, fortunately without fatalities. Further afield, there was volcanic activity in South America, Japan, Hawaii, and the United States. It has subsequently been learned that Mount Erebus, in Antarctica, also erupted at about this time. Days later shocks were still being felt in many areas, and an earthquake in China killed several hundred, while avalanches in Switzerland claimed nine lives. There is no proof, of course, that Challenger's experiment was responsible for these later incidents.\n\nA few weeks later Challenger was asked to give evidence at an emergency session of the League Of Nations. When questioned, he admitted that it might be possible to stimulate the World Echidna and deliberately trigger volcanoes or earthquakes. The second 1929 revision of the Geneva Convention banned all forms of \"geological warfare\", its language strongly implying that any repetition of the Hengist Down experiment might in itself be regarded as an act of war. This decision has been reflected in many subsequent treaties; for example, while the 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty required all signatories to perform their tests underground, it also stated that the maximum depth permissible was one mile in geologically stable areas, one half mile in areas where the crust might be unusually thin. Deep oil wells are also monitored carefully, in case they trigger a reaction; for example, in the 1980s Iraqi engineers dug deep shafts along the Iran-Iraq border, although any rational assessment of the situation would suggest that both countries were likely to be hurt by such an experiment. Destruction of these deep drilling rigs was one of the goals of Operation Desert Storm, and is believed to have been completed successfully.\n\nLooking back from the 1990s, it's difficult to believe that Challenger's dramatic demonstration (and the earlier near-extinction of the whales and dolphins) did not immediately lead to general acceptance of the truth, and formation of today's conservation movements. Some ideas are evidently too big to be digested quickly, and text books published as late as the 1950s still presented old ideas of geology and the formation of our world. Nevertheless, the idea of a living planet slowly gained ground as supporting evidence emerged from various fields, and began to enter the public consciousness.\n\nParadoxically, one factor that delayed general acceptance was the idea's enthusiastic adoption by various fringe cults and extremist groups, such as the Druids (not, as often claimed, an ancient tradition; the current British incarnation of this belief only dates back to the 19th century). They already worshipped the Earth, and it was easy to make a mental shift to the idea that it was literally alive. Later the Nazis jumped onto this bandwagon; the idea fitted in well with Hitler's vision of the State as Father-God, and the Earth as Mother-Goddess. Unfortunately this concept was mainly used to justify the Nazi assertion that the living Earth must be cleansed of \"The harmful bacteria of Judaism and the mould of Communism\". The sincerity of this belief can be judged by the fact that the Nazis were also prepared to invest time and money into Horbinger's \"World Ice\" theory, and various \"Hollow Earth\" theories (see section 8.0) which were obviously made untenable by the existence of the World Echidna. In the Soviet Union news of the Earth's life was suppressed for many years, as \"Capitalist Science\"; Challenger's brushes with the Soviet authorities, especially in the matter of Nemor's disintegration machine, did little to endear his work to Communism, and \"Materialist Geology\" was official doctrine until the early 1960s, although translations of Challenger's papers were circulated as samizdat publications in the thirties. It's interesting to note that the Soviet government was signatory to treaties against deep drilling some years before official recognition of our planet's nature.\n\nEdward and Enid Malone did much to bring the environmental aspects of these matters into the public eye in the 1930s and post-war years, but their views on spiritualism were often held against them, and ultimately proved an embarrassment to the environmental movement; although they were active behind the scenes in the founding (and funding) of the World Wildlife Fund, Greenpeace, and Friends Of The Earth, their names have all but disappeared from the official records of these organisations.\n\nEven with hindsight, it's hard to estimate how much difference these events made to environmentalism. Even before Hengist Down there was concern about pollution and endangered species; if the world were not alive, we might still have seen similar organisations develop. It's doubtful that they would be as widespread or as effective as those we know, but no-one can ever be sure.\n\nOne unlikely development has ensured that memories of the Hengist Down experiment remain fresh. Peerless Jones' autobiography` Adventures of an Artesian Engineer was reprinted in the 1970s, and was promptly purchased for the cinema. Most readers will be familiar with the series of films that followed; Raiders Of The Lost Shaft, Peerless Jones And The Last Cascade, and Peerless Jones And The Tunnel Of Doom. Any resemblance to Jones' real life is entirely coincidental, although Michael Cule's portrayal of Challenger in the third film has been commended by those who remember the Professor, and was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\n5.1 Biology Of The World-Echidna\n\nback to contents\n\nFor obvious reasons (not least the Geneva Convention, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and parts of successive SALT treaties) there are serious obstacles to any study of our living planet, but much has been learned from seismic evidence, geology in general, radar observations of volcanoes, and analogy from other living creatures. It should be emphasised that what follows includes some highly speculative elements!\n\nWorld-Echidnae are classified as ethervores, creatures capable of extracting energy from their motion through the ether. This process is inefficient, making huge body size essential. A small ethervore can barely support its own metabolism; larger specimens (such as our world) have an energy surplus which can be used for reproduction, growth, and other functions.\n\nIn its earliest stage the ethervore is a \"spore\" (See 18_SPORE.GIF), weighing about 30 pounds, propelled into space by a volcanic explosion then accelerated by hundreds of ectoplasmic filaments which somehow interact with the ether. Once in interstellar space the spore accelerates to its maximum speed (or rather, slows relative to the ether), then presumably becomes dormant. Undoubtedly most spores die, starved of energy, or are destroyed by natural forces. A tiny proportion survive to encounter the conditions needed for growth.\n\nWhen spores hit the warm gas cloud around an evolving proto-star, they extend filaments which act as a braking parachute. The filaments are electrically charged and accumulate molecules of dust and gas, used as building materials. As the World-Echidna slows, its velocity relative to the ether increases, and more energy becomes available for growth.\n\nFor the next few hundred thousand years the ethervore's life is precariously balanced. It must slowly accumulate matter while hoarding its energy reserves, and regularise its orbit to avoid drifting off into interstellar space. Slowly it develops into a gigantic organism, coated in a layer of dust and debris. Gradually its energy reserves increase, and it can take some control of its environment; for instance, it can melt parts of its crust to incandescence, using the gas released to change its course and speed.\n\nEventually the World-Echidna is so large that it attracts matter by gravitation, and its future growth is then assured. Convection currents in the crust convey nutrients from the surface to the underlying organism, which uses them to construct more body matter. Obviously there are potential problems; if growth is too fast, the organism can be crushed by the material it accumulates. There is reason to believe that the World-Echidna that became Venus may have suffered this fate.\n\nAs the World-Echidna matures it can start to produce spores of its own, which are ejected into space by volcanoes as described above. This appears to be the main goal of a World-Echidna's life cycle; everything else, such as the evolution of an atmosphere and the eventual development of life and intelligence on its surface, is irrelevant to the organism.\n\nThe general structure of our own World-Echidna will be familiar to most readers. The outer crust of the Earth is a thick layer of rock, the external shell accumulated by the World-Echidna as it formed. This material is primarily a protective shell, but is also used as a store for elements which the organism only needs occasionally, or wishes to keep out of its \"flesh\". For example, most of the copper in the crust was probably excreted many millions of years ago. The crust is endlessly recycled by the processes of plate tectonics, its material feeding into channels of molten lava (heated by etheric energy accumulated by the World-Echidna) which allow the organism to add its wastes and recover any substances which it needs. In the nineteenth century it was believed that the material underlying the plates was more molten rock, but this assumption was incorrect; while there are tubes of molten lava, some of them twenty or thirty miles wide, much of the Earth's interior is comparatively cool. Most volcanoes are simply vents for the excess pressure of these lava channels, but a small proportion are linked to deep tunnels which convey the World-Echidna's spores to the surface, and act as gigantic cannon to propel them into space.\n\nChallenger found that in non-volcanic areas normal rock ended at a depth of about eight miles, where he encountered the inner layer of the crust. This material (Challengerite) consists of a spongy mass of branching carbon filaments, recently discovered to be tubular Fullerene molecules, permeated by an extremely dense oily fluid, an aromatic cocktail of dozens of carbon and silicon compounds. This material formed the \"shivering rock\" reported by Malone and Jones:\n\n'Funny-looking stuff,' said the chief engineer, passing his hand over the nearest section of rock. He held it to the light and showed that it was glistening with a curious slimy scum. 'There have been shiverings and tremblings down here...' [WS]\n\nThis movement is a relatively simple electrochemical process, and has been reproduced with samples collected from the Hengist Down excavation. Low DC voltages applied to the soaked carbon \"sponge\" make it contract, much like a muscle; the maximum change in volume is about 0.5%, which, when cubic miles are affected, is ample to cause enormous pressure changes in the crust above this material. The collapse of the Hengist Down shaft was a localised affair, probably the equivalent of a reflex reaction. Earthquakes are the most obvious result of more general contractions, but from the World-Echidna's viewpoint they are probably an unnoticed by-product of the continual recycling of the crust. No-one is entirely sure how the movement is controlled, and it may be an entirely automatic process, a wave of electrical change spreading through the \"sponge\", like the regular contractions of the intestines.\n\nThe crust ends abruptly, after a few hundred feet, and underneath is a thin layer of the same fluid, covering the inner \"flesh\" of the World-Echidna:\n\n'It was a most extraordinary and terrifying sight. The floor consisted of some greyish material, glazed and shiny, which rose and fell in slow palpitation. The throbs were not direct, but gave the impression of a gentle ripple or rhythm, which ran across the surface. This surface itself was not entirely homogeneous, but beneath it, seen as through ground glass, there were dim whitish patches or vacuoles, which varied constantly in shape and size. We stood all three gazing spell-bound at this extraordinary sight.' [WS]\n\nAt this point our definite knowledge of the World-Echidna ends; all that we really know is that this \"flesh\" is sensitive to light, and most certainly noticed the impact of a sharp drill. The results have been described. Seismic evidence suggests that there are dense inner organs, hundreds of miles across, much deeper in the World-Echidna's body, but exact details are unknown.\n\nThe World-Echidna is probably not intelligent, in any sense that we would understand. Psychics have failed to detect anything that might correspond to a planetary consciousness, and there is every reason to believe that it has roughly the same level of mentation as its namesake, the sea urchin, its behaviour governed by the urge to feed, reproduce, and avoid unpleasant stimuli. Of course this view could be mistaken; perhaps there is a vast intelligence at work deep beneath our feet, totally uninterested in our puny intellects, communing with its brethren by etheric waves or some unimaginably slow form of telepathy.\n\nThe welfare of humanity is totally dependent on the continued health of our living planet. Its reflex reaction to an injury might in itself be enough to destroy civilisation; a few hundred volcanoes erupting simultaneously could upset the global climate, accelerating the greenhouse effect or plunging us into another Ice Age. It's fortunate that the Hengist Down experiment didn't trigger a response on this scale. If it were to die, the effects are totally unknowable, but its death-spasms might spell the end of the human race. Fortunately this seems unlikely; it has survived for millions of years, and must have experienced asteroid collisions and other events that would dwarf anything mankind can devise. Nevertheless there have been world-wide extinctions, cataclysmic events on a scale that implies that it is occasionally abnormally active. This activity may have been the result of injuries.\n\nSeveral scientists have speculated that there might be parasites and predators that prey on World-Echidnae. While it's difficult to imagine such creatures, we've only known about our own World-Echidna for seventy years; there is still no proof that any other planet has a similar living core.\n\nAs emphasised earlier, most of this section is speculation, and the reality may be very different from our beliefs. One iconoclastic theory, put forward by Sir Fred Hoyle, suggests that the most widely accepted ideas about the World-Echidna's life cycle are wrong, that it played no real part in the formation of the Earth, and that it is in fact a parasite, slowly devouring our world like a worm in an apple. Eventually it will hatch and migrate back into space, leaving the broken shell of the Earth behind. Far fetched, perhaps, but only a little less believable than the most widely accepted theories. It is unlikely that we will know more this century. In the longer term, NASA plans to attempt to intercept a spore in space, and has considered a deep drilling experiment on Mars. Both schemes are strongly opposed by most environmental groups.\n\n5.2 Adventures On (And In) The Living Planet\n\nback to contents\n\nThe resources needed for experiments in this field make it unlikely that adventurers will ever get really close to the living core of our world. However...\n\nBy Bathysphere To The Earth's Core\n\nIn the wake of Challenger's experiment, a distinguished oceanographer wonders if it might be possible to reach the World-Echidna through fissures in the ocean bed. Of course he needs backers, and the help of suitably skilled scientists and engineers. What he finds is up to the referee...\n\nOutlandish Journey\n\nSomething is wrong with the World Echidna; volcanoes are erupting daily, and earthquakes have devastated major cities. The crisis seems to be intensifying by the day. Seismic records show that the trouble is at its worst deep below the Central Australian Desert. In response to this threat, an international team of scientists has developed a mole machine, which can dig its way down to the source of the disturbance in a matter of days; no-one is sure that the trouble can be cured, but the alternative doesn't bear thinking about. The adventurers have skills that are badly needed; will they volunteer for this suicidally desperate mission?\n\nEyeballs In The Sky\n\nScientists have always believed that the Moon is dead, but suddenly it seems to have come to life. Volcanoes are erupting at several points, and the crust is breaking apart. Could the Moon be a gigantic chrysalis, about to transform into a new stage in a World-Echidna's life? If it is, what of the Earth and the other planets, and what (if anything) can the adventurers do about it?\n\nUltimatum\n\nAliens arrive on Earth, claiming that the World-Echidna has summoned them by means of an etheric message, relayed by their own living world. They claim that disintegration experiments are polluting the ether, and slowly poisoning the World-Echidna, and order the human race to cease all use of etheric machines. In return, they will teach us to talk to the World-Echidna directly. Are the aliens sincere, or do they have an ulterior motive, and how will they enforce their demands? See \"The Day The Earth Stood Still\" and other 1950s SF, and the novelette \"If The Stars Are Gods\" (Greg Benford [1974]); GURPS Atomic Horror (Steve Jackson Games) also has some useful ideas.\n\n6.0 Life In The Sky\n\nback to contents\n\n\"I say, wingco, I think that the Jerries are circling behind those bally flying jellyfish!\"\n\n\"Well spotted, Algy! All aircraft, bandits at ten o'clock!\"\n\n[Capt. W.E. Johns - Biggles Defies The Swastika, 1941]\n\nIt's a truism of biology that life will expand into every niche it can possibly occupy. We dwell on a living planet, and there are plants and animals in the deep sea, in the most desolate desert, at the Poles, and on the highest mountain. But until the 1920s no-one imagined that there could be living creatures in the upper reaches of the atmosphere.\n\nThe pioneer of aerobiology was Mr. Joyce-Armstrong, a British aviator and inventor who set a series of altitude records between 1912 and 1924, and developed many of the safety and navigation aids used in the aircraft of his day.\n\nJoyce-Armstrong's story is well known; the 1954 film biography, starring David Niven, is reasonably accurate, based on diaries and other papers published by his family in 1937. His portrayal in the recent Peerless Jones And The Tunnel Of Doom is pure fiction; he never met Jones or Challenger, and was killed years before the Hengist Down experiment reached its climax.\n\nTo recap his story, a series of aviators died or disappeared between 1920 and 1924. All were attempting high-altitude flights; a common feature of the incidents was the recovery of the aircraft, with the pilot's body missing or horribly mutilated. Where others might have assumed that the pilots had somehow been thrown out of their aircraft, Joyce-Armstrong guessed that something had pulled them out. His aircraft was equipped to test this idea. Taking off from Devizes in Wiltshire, he flew West towards Salisbury Plain and encountered the Northern fringes of Britain's largest aerial \"jungle\". He was lucky enough to see some of the larger aerial fauna. On this occasion he escaped successfully, but on his next flight he returned to the jungle without adequate protection; his notebook and other effects were subsequently found near the village of Withyham, on the Kent and Sussex border (see 19_SSI.GIF for these and other sites of interest in Southern England). It seems likely that he flew through the main body of the \"jungle\", where several predators attacked in a pack, and was picked off before he could escape; his notes partially confirm this, but their contents have been documented elsewhere [HH].\n\nThe Joyce-Armstrong manuscript was widely regarded as a hoax in extremely poor taste, or possibly a description of a hallucination, but it happened to be published at a time when several designers were experimenting with closed cockpits and more powerful engines. While the main aim of these improvements was increased speed, there were obvious advantages in protection against the so-called \"Horror of the Heights\" described by Joyce-Armstrong. His initial descriptions were confirmed by eyewitness accounts and still photographs in 1924-6, and by film in 1927, with the first live aeroplankton captured in 1928. Larger species were immobilised and studied in the late thirties, but even today none of the major aerofauna have been successfully brought down to Earth.\n\n6.1 The Aerofauna\n\nback to contents\n\nSince 1970 the Aerofauna have been classified as a separate biological kingdom. While there are superficial resemblances to terrestrial and marine animal forms, these creatures represent a completely isolated evolutionary chain. Unfortunately there is no fossil record to confirm their exact relationships; specimens are crushed or disintegrate at low altitude, their cells imploding under pressure. Genetic typing shows that they are more closely related to each other than to any other living organism; the closest similarity is found in some marine protozoans, but even there the resemblance is not great. The most distinctive feature is the presence of a blue-grey photosynthetic pigment in all cells, even in animal-like species; this pigment is most efficient in the higher UV frequencies, and has not been found in any terrestrial or aquatic species. Uniquely, a by-product of this process is hydrogen, used for buoyancy.\n\nToday approximately 250 species are known, ranging from microscopic aeroplankton to the mighty Aeromomedusa Leviathan of the East African aerial jungle. Nineteen species are commonly found over Britain and Europe. All are superficially similar to protozoans or invertebrates; none have developed bones, although some remarkably strong lightweight structures have taken their place. There are generally considered to be four main phyla, all named after the nearest marine or terrestrial equivalent; aeroplankton, aeromedusae, aeromesozoa, and aeromollusca.\n\nThe larger species retain photosynthetic pigments in their cells, but cannot generate enough hydrogen to stay aloft. The aeromedusae and aeromesozoa feed on aeroplankton for extra energy and hydrogen, and are in turn prey to the aeromollusca. In ecological terms, their distribution represents a typical pyramid of biomass; roughly twenty tons of aeroplankton per ton of primary consumer (aeromedusae and aeromesozoa), and about the same proportion of primary consumers to predators (aeromollusca).\n\nAeroplankton\n\n'The air in front of me had lost its crystal clearness. It was full of long, ragged wisps of something which I can only compare to very fine cigarette-smoke. It hung about in wreaths and coils, turning and twisting slowly in the sunlight. As the monoplane shot through it, I was aware of a faint taste of oil upon my lips, and there was a greasy scum upon the woodwork of the machine. Some infinitely fine organic matter appeared to be suspended in the atmosphere.' [HH]\n\nThe aeroplankton (20_PLANK.GIF) are similar to unicellular organisms of the ocean, but their photosynthetic pigment is specialised for high-energy UV radiation, splitting water vapour into oxygen and hydrogen. The hydrogen is mostly used to construct foods from carbon dioxide, but a small surplus is retained in vacuoles inside the cell, buoying the aeroplankton and allowing it to fly. Some other raw materials are extracted from volcanic and meteoric dust. Because hydrogen production is only possible by day, and hydrogen can readily diffuse through protoplasm, the aeroplankton rise during the day and fall by night, and all the other organisms of the sky must rise and fall with them. Starting at about 38000 ft at dawn, they rise to around 45000 ft by sunset, then slowly descend overnight (the range is greater in the tropics). The aeroplankton layer is usually less than five thousand feet thick, but this is very variable. From the ground it is virtually invisible, a thin mist so diffuse that its effect on astronomical photography wasn't apparent until these creatures were known to exist. The main European species are Aeroplankton Joyce- Armstrong, the common British variety, and the slightly smaller Aeroplankton Challengeri, sometimes found over Britain but more common in warmer areas, with another eight similar but rarer species found throughout the European range.\n\nAeroplankton can't perform any type of attack, but particularly dense clouds can explode (Effect 10, radius 10 ft) if ignited. Most clouds are too diffuse to explode.\n\nAeromesozoa\n\n'...fantastic coils of vapour like material, which turned and twisted with great speed, flying round and round at such a pace that the eyes could hardly follow them. Some of these ghost-like creatures were twenty or thirty feet long, but it was difficult to tell their girth, for their outline was so hazy that it seemed to fade away into the air around them. These air-snakes were of a very light grey or smoke colour, with some darker lines within, which gave the impression of a definite organism...' [HH]\n\nThe aeromesozoa (21_WORM.GIF) are colonial organisms resembling ghostly worms. They consists of thousands of aeroplankton-like cells connected by a loose mesh of fine filaments. Aeroplankton are sucked into the \"mouth\", and torn apart as food. Most of their hydrogen escapes, but the mean density of the air between the mesh is lower than that outside the organism, providing enough lift to keep the animal airborne. Specimens up to 50 ft long have been reported, massing 15-20 lb. Only five species are known, all with global range, and all apparently harmless. They are seasonal migrants, following the sun between the hemispheres; since there is considerable doubt as to the species originally observed by Joyce-Armstrong, all five species are named for later zoologists. They do not have eyes, but are sensitive to changes in light intensity.\n\nSpecimens have been observed inside the digestive tracts of aeromedusae. While early reports suggested that they had been eaten, there is no real evidence to support this theory; it is possible that they are parasites, entering the guts of the Aeromedusae to steal aeroplankton and hydrogen.\n\nBODY [3], MIND [-], SOUL [-]\n\nNo attacks, burns readily (Effect 10) if ignited but does not explode.\n\nWounds: C[ ]\n\nMost attacks can penetrate these creatures without any harm; if cut in two, the halves fly away as new animals. Due to the presence of hydrogen in their bodies all fire-based attacks have double Effect.\n\nAeromedusae\n\n'...a jelly-fish such as sails in our summer seas, bell-shaped... far larger, I should judge, than the dome of St. Paul's. It was of a light pink colour veined with a delicate green, but the whole huge fabric so tenuous that it was but a fairy outline against the dark blue sky. It pulsated with a delicate and regular rhythm. From it there depended two long, drooping green tentacles, which swayed slowly backward and forwards.' [HH]\n\nThe large aeromedusae (22_JFISH.GIF) are superficially similar to jellyfish, their bodies built to trap aeroplankton on long adhesive tentacles. Once drawn inside the main bell of the animal, the aeroplankton are digested, their hydrogen accumulating in its gas bags. They can grow to impressive sizes, and may mass up to 100-150 lb if well fed. Naturally their life-style leaves little need for intelligence, and they are content to drift with the wind and the aeroplankton. If attacked they can use their adhesive tentacles defensively, but they are rarely able to escape. The gasbag cells of these creatures can be up to a foot wide, but are as thin as the skin of a soap bubble. Seven species have been encountered above Europe, differing mainly in size and coloration; the number of tentacles is variable. All are harmless to man, although their explosive gas is a potential hazard to aircraft. The most common British species is Aeromedusa Joyce-Armstrong, although there is some reason to believe that he may have actually observed a larger and rarer form, Aeromedusa Santos-Dumont.\n\nBODY [8], MIND [-], SOUL [-]\n\nNo attacks, but explodes with Effect 20, radius 30 ft, if ignited.\n\nWounds: B[ ] F[ ] I[ ] C[ ]\n\nDue to the presence of hydrogen in their bodies all fire-based attacks have double Effect.\n\nAeromollusca\n\n'...it appeared to be hundreds of square feet in size. Though fashioned of some transparent, jelly-like substance, it was none the less of much more definite outline and solid consistence than anything which I had seen before. There were more traces, too, of a physical organization, especially two vast shadowy, circular plates upon either side, which may have been eyes, and a perfectly solid white projection between them which was as curved and cruel as the beak of a vulture...'\n\n\"...On the upper curve of its huge body there were three great projections which I can only describe as enormous bubbles, and I was convinced as I looked at them that they were charged with some extremely light gas which served to buoy up the misshapen and semi-solid mass in the rarefied air...'\n\n'...So elastic and gelatinous was it that never for two successive minutes was it the same shape, and yet each change made it more threatening and loathsome than the last...' [HH]\n\nThe final denizens of the sky are the aeromollusca (23_HOROR.GIF), predators that feed on the other large aerofauna; their anatomy is far more complex, resembling that of carnivorous slugs and snails, and their cellular structure is relatively dense, although still much softer than any large terrestrial animal. Most species have hard \"armour\" plates and beaks, all as strong as horn. Typically they are equipped with several tentacles, using them for locomotion and for feeding. All have eyes, a keen sense of smell, and a powerful electrical sense analogous to that of some sharks. All are superbly camouflaged, which is surprising because they prey on animals with no eyes; while naturalists have occasionally observed these creatures fighting, the degree of camouflage exhibited suggests that their prey may include an unknown species with better visual powers, or that they evolved to avoid some other predator, also unknown. There has been some considerable speculation about the nature of this predator; a larger form of aeromollusc seems most likely, but it's possible that one of the other phyla has produced an unknown predatory form.\n\nBODY [12], MIND [1], SOUL [1]\n\nBrawling [13];\n\nTentacles, Effect 10, Damage A:B, B:F, C:I\n\nBeak, Effect 15, Damage A:F, B:I/C, C:K\n\nExplodes with Effect 15, radius 10 ft, if the body is ignited; the slime coating the tentacles is not flammable, and it instantly withdraws them from anything hot before the hydrogen is ignited.\n\nWounds: B[ ] F[ ] I[ ] I[ ] I[ ] C[ ]\n\nAnything struck by the tentacles is grabbed (on a B or C result) and pulled up to the beak; the victim has one round to overcome the creature's Brawling skill and break free, and is attacked by the beak in the following round. It can lift a maximum of half its BODY (eg BODY 7), which includes any undigested food in its gut; food is digested at 1 BODY per 1D6 hours. Food that is too heavy to lift is torn apart; for example, a human victim's head and limbs might each have BODY 1.\n\nBecause of the amorphous nature of their flesh, halve the Effect of bullets and other piercing attacks; shotguns have normal Effect, as do knives and other weapons capable of slashing. Due to the presence of hydrogen in their bodies all fire-based attacks have double Effect. See the adventures for more on their attack methods and tactics.\n\n6.2 The Aerofauna Today\n\nback to contents\n\nWhile the aerofauna were originally considered fascinating freaks, of interest only to scientists, they soon proved a considerable problem to aviators. By 1928 aircraft were regularly entering their domain. Accidents were inevitable, and many pilots of the thirties reported collisions with aeromedusae; a number of mysterious crashes can probably be blamed on larger and more solid aeromollusca. Equipping propeller-driven aircraft with sharpened wing edges and steel airscrews reduced the casualty rate considerably, and avoidance of the danger altitudes helped even more. Balloons and airships were also at risk; balloons, in particular, have repeatedly been attacked (for want of a better word) by amorous aeromedusae.\n\nIn 1930 Professor Challenger designed and obtained funds for a semi-rigid airship, the JA-1 (Joyce-Armstrong 1; 24_JA1.GIF). Years ahead of its time, it could fly at 55 MPH and was tested to 55,000 ft. When fully fuelled it could lift 3.2 tons, over and above the weight of the airship itself, but this gave no safety margin; about a half-ton of equipment, the crew of two, and up to four passengers were a more typical load. Equipment carried at different times included etheric, magnetic, and electromagnetic sensors, telescopes, cameras, and nets. Like most early semi-rigid airships (often called \"blimps\"), it had to fly forward to scoop up air and keep the envelope around the gas-bags rigid. Minimum speed was about 15 MPH, giving a theoretical maximum endurance of 4 days. This was a serious limitation, since it meant that the airship could not hover noiselessly. Another drawback was a lack of cabin pressurisation, which meant that the occupants had to use oxygen equipment and wear heavy clothing, and restricted flights to a real maximum of about 24-36 hours. While it flew at least twenty-five times between 1932 and 1937, these problems and serious gas-bag leakage meant that it was scrapped in 1938.\n\nAfter the Second World War radar was used to route aircraft above or around the aerial \"jungles\". Needless to say, a great deal of effort has gone into making sure that aircraft are not mistaken for aerofauna, or vice versa, but military stealth systems have undoubtedly been built with the goal of imitating these creatures. There is good reason to believe that the USA and USSR experimented with spy balloons disguised as aeromedusae during the Cold War, and it is certain that the CIA fitted time-delay cameras to a large number of these creatures near Russian air space in the 1960s. The natural result was a series of fighter sweeps against \"suspicious\" aerial jungles, with major disruption of the habitat.\n\nIn 1973-5 the USAAF built fighter prototypes equipped to climb into an aerial jungle then scoop up aeroplankton as fuel. Theoretically a fighter with this equipment could fly to altitude then loiter there indefinitely, ready to attack enemy aircraft. Ignoring the obvious environmental problems, the idea was fatally flawed; the scoops were either too small to gather enough aeroplankton, or so large that their air resistance slowed the aircraft. Fighters deliberately flying in the aerial jungles were bound to run into the larger aerofauna eventually; when this happened the jets usually flamed out, and in at least one instance exploded violently. Finally, the over-sized air intakes were incompatible with any sort of stealth capability. The project was abandoned after approximately $1.2 billion had been spent.\n\nMost of the aerofauna are now listed as endangered species; decades of aviation, pollution, and the depletion of the ozone layer have all taken their toll, and between 1930 and 1990 there has been an estimated 80% reduction in numbers. So far as is known there have been no extinctions, since all of the species have wide distribution, but there may only be a few hundred aeromollusca left over Europe, and today's aeromedusae are much smaller than those encountered before World War 2. Although pollution controls may eventually bring some relief, their future is uncertain.\n\nPaul Veroner Monoplane\n\n'The engine is a ten-cylinder rotary Robur working up to one hundred and seventy-five. It has all the modern improvements; enclosed fuselage, high-curved landing skids, brakes, gyroscopic steadiers, and three speeds, worked by an alteration of the angle of the planes upon the Venetian-blind principle.'[HH]\n\nThis high-winged 175 HP monoplane (included in 23_HOROR.GIF) shows the new aviation technology of the 1920s in a period of transition. It has ten hours endurance, a maximum ceiling of about 42,000 ft (7.9 miles), and a top speed of 75 MPH (100 MPH in a dive). It is extraordinarily stable, extremely quiet (apart from wind noise and mechanical noise from the engine; the exhaust is almost completely silent), and very strong. The wings are triple aerofoils resembling a modern wing with permanently extended forward and aft flaps; together with gyroscopic stabilisers, they ensure steady flight but reduce agility.\n\nWithin five years most of these innovations were forgotten; better pilot training and the quest for speed meant that stability was sacrificed in favour of manoeuvrability, while closed cockpits and the need for greater engine power made silencers a liability.\n\nAircraft: Paul Veroner Monoplane Length: 30 ft (9m) Maximum Width: 60 ft (18m) Capacity: .2 tons Maximum Speed: 100 MPH BODY: 15\n\nNotes: This aircraft is extremely easy to control in level or steadily climbing flight (+1 to Pilot skill), but its stabilisers make it difficult to manoeuvre sharply (-2 in any combat manoeuvre, evasive action, etc.)\n\nJA-1 Semi-Rigid Airship\n\nSee the description above for history and more performance data. This dirigible has some features that make it unusually easy to fly; +1 to pilot skill. Unfortunately it uses flammable hydrogen for lift, does not have self-sealing gas bags, and must keep flying forward to maintain envelope rigidity. If one of the external engines fails the JA-1 will start to fly in circles; if both fail the envelope starts to collapse, squashing the inner ballonets (gas bags) and reducing lift. It's a long way down...\n\nLength: 250 ft (75m) Maximum Width: 30 ft (9m) Length-Width Ratio: 8:1 Lift: 3.2 tons Maximum Speed: 55 MPH BODY: 20\n\nForgotten Futures I: The A.B.C. Files contains detailed futuristic aircraft construction systems, which were mostly ignored in designing these comparatively primitive craft.\n\n6.3 Adventures In The Sky\n\nback to contents\n\nBring Them Back Alive II\n\nSee Section 3.4; this is essentially the same adventure idea with different problems. Zoos and private exhibitors would pay a fortune for any aerofauna, even relatively small specimens. Capturing something the size of St. Paul's Cathedral won't be easy, and it will take days or weeks to bring it down to low altitudes without killing it. Feeding is also likely to lead to difficulties, since the peculiar form of photosynthesis used by aeroplankton only works at high altitudes. Finally, how do you cage something that big?\n\nReady When You Are II\n\n1928. Mammoth Pictures has decided to make The Joyce-Armstrong Story, a stirring bio-pic based on the life of the aerial pioneer. Authentic footage of the aerofauna is essential; the most difficult shot will be an aeromollusc attacking a Paul Veroner monoplane. Unfortunately someone has to fly it, find a suitable aeromollusc, and arrange to be attacked, without endangering the camera crew or the stars. There's only one snag (apart from all the obvious ones); Mammoth Pictures is teetering on the verge of bankruptcy, and will fold if the film isn't ready within a few days. Credit is very tight, and equipment (such as cameras and aircraft) is old, poorly maintained, and unlikely to be replaced if there's a problem.\n\nWith minor changes this can be set in 1954, with David Niven in the title role, or in the present day as second unit photography for Peerless Jones And The Tunnel Of Doom.\n\nEyeballs In The Sky II\n\n1935. British agents report that the Zeppelin airship factory is working extra shifts, although no new projects have been announced, and no structural steel has been transported to the factory. This suggests that they are working on something new; possibly simple barrage balloons for air defence, which might suggest that there are plans for war, possibly some other type of semi-rigid airship. Is it just a coincidence that German naturalists seem to be making an intensive study of aeromedusa migration routes over Britain, Europe and Scandinavia?\n\nTop Predator\n\nIn conventional ecological terms a top predator is the ultimate beneficiary of most food chains; examples include lions, crocodiles, sharks, and man. In the sky the aeromollusca seem to have this role, but naturalists have noted that they seem to be superbly camouflaged, despite the fact that their prey is blind. For years there has been speculation about an unknown predator of the skies, far more powerful than the aeromollusca. Analysis of migration routes suggest that the aeromolluscs seem to avoid certain areas, mostly over oceans, and that these areas have an unusually large number of disappearing aircraft and shipwrecks. Maybe the aeromolluscs are just avoiding bad weather, but it's possible that something really nasty is waiting somewhere in the region called the Bermuda Triangle...\n\n7.0 Spiritualism\n\nback to contents\n\nThe 19th century saw an immense flowering of interest in spiritualism and psychic phenomena. In brief, spiritualism assumes that it is possible to communicate with the dead. It is not a new faith; most early cultures have some equivalent, and survival after death is, of course, an important tenet of most religions.\n\nModern spiritualism began with Margaret Fox, an American medium who could produce spirit \"rappings\" in answer to questions put to her. By the mid-1850s she was internationally famous, although she later admitted that she produced rapping noises by flexing her own joints. Spiritualists generally prefer to believe that she only did this when she was unable to achieve true rapport with the spirit world. She was followed by many other mediums, especially in Britain and America. Their common repertoire often included levitation (especially of tables and smaller inanimate objects), clairvoyance and clairaudience, speaking in tongues and with the voice of spirits, automatic writing, and the production of visual apparitions and ectoplasm. The movement gained many more followers during the First World War, and the subsequent influenza pandemic, when many millions of families were bereaved.\n\nOne result of the flowering of spiritualism was the foundation of many spiritualist churches. While most worshippers were entirely sincere, there were undoubtedly many fake or deluded pseudo-mediums. The religious ties of spiritualism, and the frequent unmasking of fakes, lead to bias in scientific studies of the matter. Many distinguished scientists rejected spiritualism completely, while reports from scientists with an interest in the matter were for a long time assumed to be the result of fraud, wishful thinking, or religious mania. Some of the scientists tarred with this brush included Sir William Crookes, Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir William Barrett, Lombroso, A.R. Wallace, Flammarion, Dr. Maupuis of Paris, and Professor G.E. Challenger.\n\n\"...It is really the religious side of this matter which interests me, and that is conspicuously wanting in the minds of these scientific men of the Continent...\" [LM:9]\n\nThe twentieth century has seen a good deal of evidence for the reality of the ether (see section 4, and especially 4.3, above), and of other phenomena commonly associated with spiritualism. There is still a good deal of doubt about the real origin of these phenomena; basically, spiritualists claim a supernatural source, materialists believe that there are natural and psychological causes which are not related to survival after death.\n\nSpiritualism is often confused with other forms of paranormal activity or study, ranging from a belief in Atlantis or a flat earth to black magic and witchcraft. While a tiny minority of spiritualists dabble in these fields, most react to them with horror or disdain.\n\nA Note From The Author\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle was a spiritualist; I am not. Since The Land Of Mist treats this belief as factual and scientifically provable, it would be unfair to his intentions to omit it. Since I am not qualified to discuss the religious aspects of spiritualism, I have chosen to concentrate on the \"mechanics\" of the subject, as presented in The Land Of Mist, with special reference to role playing, and to treat spiritualist concepts as part of the worldbook's background, without much discussion of their religious implications.\n\nDoyle makes it clear that some psychic phenomena can be demonstrated experimentally, but suggests that scientists will be very reluctant to accept a supernatural explanation of these processes. The rest of this collection reflects this point of view. I have not attempted to cover fringe activities, such as magic.\n\nUse of this aspect of the background is entirely optional, but it should be mentioned that spiritualism and other aspects of the paranormal are important in one of the scenarios accompanying this collection, and may affect others.\n\nIf there are any readers with a belief in spiritualism, I hope that they will not be offended by my treatment of their faith, and trust that they will at least enjoy The Land Of Mist.\n\n7.1 Mediums And Psychic Phenomena\n\nback to contents\n\nMediums differ greatly in their power and abilities. There is no such thing as a typical medium; at its lowest level mediumship is little more than susceptibility to psychic impressions and enhanced intuition, while the most powerful can produce visual and auditory phenomena, streams of ectoplasm, and temporarily solid matter. Most spiritualists claim that the spirit creates these phenomena, not the medium, although mediums are usually exhausted after any prolonged use of their abilities. A majority of mediums are women, but that may simply be because these abilities are sometimes linked to bereavement, and there are more widows than widowers.\n\nGenerally, experienced mediums are most likely to be able to produce spectacular phenomena, but the ability also seems to be linked to belief, religious commitment, and intent; those who try to use their powers for selfish ends, or for personal gain over and above the bare necessities of life, are likely to find that their abilites desert them when they are most needed.\n\nMediums almost always achieve their best results in the dark, or under dim red lighting. Brighter light and other colours create more powerful etheric vibrations, and seem to disrupt paranormal activities. Until the 1930s most fast photographic film was insensitive to red light, making it very difficult to record these phenomena as they occurred. The introduction of faster red and infra-red sensitive materials revolutionised scientific study of spiritualism, and led to the exposure of many fakes. However, there was soon ample evidence of genuine effects, photographed under conditions which ruled out fakery. After the Second World War infra-red image converters made it possible for observers to see perfectly under these conditions; while a few more fakes were eliminated, genuine phenomena were soon susceptible to closer analysis. Today image intensifiers, thermal imaging, computer image enhancement, and voice-print analysis have revolutionised these studies; it is now certain that something is going on, and the scientific debate mainly revolves around the source of phenomena, not their existence.\n\n\"...There is a spirit building up behind you. It is a man. He is a tall man -- six foot maybe. High forehead, eyes grey or blue, a long chin, brown moustache, lines on his face. Do you recognize him, friend?\" [LM:2]\n\n\"...Some victim that he had driven to suicide got into the medium. He got the moneylender by the throat and it was a close thing for his life...\" [LM:4]\n\nThe most common form of mediumship is exactly that; the medium acts as a medium, or channel, between the living and spirit worlds. Through her the spirits speak, and may also sometimes use her body to write or act. Sometimes the medium simply sees and hears the spirit; sometimes there is literal possession of the medium's body. Usually the medium must enter some sort of trance before these phenomena begin. Occasionally the voice of the spirit contact can be heard directly, rather than speaking through the mouth of the medium, or the spirit may communicate by knocks and other codes. This is most common if a seance is attended by several psychically sensitive individuals, but does not have a single medium in control.\n\nSpirits almost always use the vocabulary and abilities of the medium, and the personality displayed is often obviously modified by the medium's ideas and preconceptions; for example, Red Indian and Chinese spirit guides rarely understand their native languages when they are filtered through the mind of the medium, since the medium doesn't understand them. They may also use phraseology or make jokes which are in part derived from the personality or preconceptions of the medium; for example:\n\n\"..Oh, what big man with beard! Mailey, Mister Mailey, I meet him before. He big Mailey, I little femaley...\" [LM:4]\n\n\"Good day, Chief! How the squaw? How the papooses? Strange faces in wigwam to-night.\" [LM:4]\n\nIn the first of these examples, the pun uses a vocabulary which is obviously not derived from the spirit, an eight year old African child. In the second, the Red Indian spirit guide uses terms which are more appropriate to popular fiction about the Wild West. This mental filtering effect may explain the preponderance of Red Indian spirit guides, and the frequency with which the spirits of the famous or infamous appear to manifest; the medium may be interpreting something, that would otherwise be incomprehensible, in familiar terms.\n\nClairvoyance and clairaudience apart, common communication methods include raps and knocks, automatic writing (with a pen held by a trance medium, or a planchette - a small trolley bearing a pencil - controlled jointly by several participants), and the use of Ouija boards and other alphabet systems. These are most often seen at seances where none of the participants is a strong psychic. See 25_SEANC.GIF for pictures of this equipment.\n\n'The tambourine had risen in the air, and the dot of luminous paint showed that it was circling round. Presently it descended and touched their heads each in turn. Then with a jingle it quivered down upon the table.' [LM:4]\n\n'Several more (lights) had broken out. They were of different types, slow-moving clouds and little dancing sparks like glow-worms. At the same time both visitors were conscious of a cold wind which blew upon their faces. It was no delusion, for Enid felt her hair stream across her forehead.' [LM:4]\n\nPhysical effects produced at seances are similar to those attributed to poltergeists; movement of lightweight objects, and the appearance of small lights, often associated with other manifestations such as voices or cold winds. Under controlled conditions the latter are often accompanied by strong Kirilian auras, suggesting that they are primarily electrostatic effects. Slight fluctuations in ether density have also been observed. EEG recordings of genuine mediums often show intense hind-brain activity associated with poltergeist and telekinetic effects. While they do not seem to be susceptible to conscious control, these results suggest that they are at least partially generated by the minds of those involved in the seance.\n\n'...It seemed to him that the features were semi-fluid, moulding themselves into a shape, as if some unseen hand was modelling them in putty. \"Mother!\" he cried. \"Mother!\"\n\nInstantly the figure threw up both her hands in a wild gesture of joy. The motion seemed to destroy her equilibrium and she vanished.' [LM:5]\n\n'An instant later Malone was aware of a shaggy head extended between Lord Roxton and himself. With his left hand he could feel long, coarse hair. It turned towards him, and it needed all his self-control to hold his hand still when a long soft tongue caressed it. Then it was gone.' [LM:12]\n\nOccasionally mediums can do much more, producing visual apparitions, and sometimes even tangible objects, from ectoplasm. The mechanism was discussed briefly in section 4.3, but is little-understood even in the 1990s. Basically, small electrical fields can pull material from the ether; under the control of the medium or a guiding spirit, this ectoplasm can assume the shape of the spirit or some other familiar object or person. This ability can only be used in a trance. Ectoplasm is extremely fragile, and is often connected to the medium's body at the nostrils and other orifices. If it is disturbed, the medium often feels an intense shock, and may even be stunned or knocked out. This may be an electrical effect; when these phenomena are produced, Kirilian auras are particularly strong around the associated nerve endings, which may be generating the electrical field used to materialise the ectoplasm.\n\nIn a minority of cases materialisations occur at locations well away from the medium's body. As yet this phenomenon has not been explained.\n\n7.1.1 False Mediums\n\nback to contents\n\nGenuine "
