        "text": "Two Authors in an Attic\n\nRobert Lewis Taylor, The New Yorker, 8 and 15 September 1951\n\nPart 1\n\nJohn Dickson Carr, a slight, dark, rather spooky man of forty-four, is one of the ablest and most prolific writers of “mystery,” or detective, fiction, a form of literature dedicated to the proposition that death is everywhere but never from natural causes. Carr works in an attic, as a capital way to get in a grisly mood, and once considered stocking the place with bats. His wife, who loves mysteries but has a strong practical turn of mind, persuaded him to install an air-conditioning machine instead. At cruising speed, Carr turns out four full-length books per year; in an emergency, he can rev up to around six books and a couple of dozen short stories in the same period. One of his recent shorts, entitled “The Gentleman from Paris,” put together while he was having a sandwich lunch, won the two-thousand-dollar first prize in a contest sponsored by Ellery Queen, a noted co-toiler in the blood-and-bones vineyard, and sold to the movies for five thousand dollars. It has been mentioned by lovers of both mystery and lay fiction as being a distinguished tour de force, with a fine double wallop at the end, of the sort that Carr has made famous. “The majority of detective writers usually rest on the one big surprise,” he says, “but I prefer the double. It’s more ingenious.” For example, in “The Gentleman from Paris,” SPOILER not only did a bibulous ruin in a saloon solve a riddle cleverly but he turned out to be Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nThe streak of duality suggested here extends more deeply into Carr’s operations. Because of the rich prodigality of his output, he has split his creative forces and produces books under two names, his own and the not dissimilar pseudonym of Carter Dickson. As John Dickson Carr, he works through Harper’s and features his well-known amateur sleuth Dr Gideon Fell; as Carter Dickson, he works through Morrow and features his other well-known amateur sleuth, Sir Henry Merrivale, or H.M., as detective-story fans affectionately call him. In this way, Carr has become perhaps the first person ever to prove that a house divided against itself can indeed stand; his works do well at both publishers. At one time, Carr, like Gaul, was divided into three parts, using yet another pen name, Carr Dickson, under which he wrote “The Bowstring Murders,” a treatise on the more macabre aspects of armoury. Saleswise, he functioned extremely well in triplicate, but he nevertheless has not used the third name again, on the theory that it might be confusing.\n\nAltogether, Carr has published fifty-two books, all but three of them mysteries. Some of his titles are (by John Dickson Carr) “It Walks by Night,” “The Lost Gallows,” “Poison in Jest,” “Hag’s Nook,” “The Blind Barber,” “Death Watch,” “The Three Coffins,” “The Burning Court,” “The Four False Weapons,” “The Problem of the Wire Cage,” “Death Turns the Tables,” “The Emperor’s Snuff-Box,” and “The Sleeping Sphinx,” and (by Carter Dickson) “The White Priory Murders,” “The Red Widow Murders,” “The Unicorn Murders,” “The Punch and Judy Murders,” “The Peacock Feather Murders,” “And So to Murder,” “She Died a Lady,” “Nine—and Death Makes Ten,” “My Late Wives,” “The Skeleton in the Clock,” and “A Graveyard to Let.” His list is so long that he is unable to identify at least half of the titles. At a party, he is apt to hear somebody comment enthusiastically upon, say, “The Red Widow Murders” and mutter, in generous agreement, “Oh, yes, Agatha Christie—an excellent piece of work.” He is an inveterate browser among the bookstalls and has been known to pick up a worn volume, glance abstractedly at the title, and become quite absorbed in the first chapter before realising it is something he dashed off in 1933. Like other writers of detective novels, Carr is sick of the special category into which they have been thrust; he sees the practice of lumping reviews of “Mysteries” at the tail end of book sections as a kind of literary Jim Crowism. In an effort to burst his chains, he wrote, in 1949, his first historical novel, “The Bride of Newgate,” which had a popular sale, and in the same year he brought out—perhaps his chef-d’oeuvre to date—“The Life of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.” The biography was very favourably reviewed and was on the best-seller lists for six weeks, a combination that Carr considers a pretty nifty double wallop in itself, since it has become stylish for profound reviewers to regard all inevitable best-sellers with high suspicion, as possibly containing atomic secrets in code.\n\nAfter a year of such crowded activity, the average writer would doubtless have knocked off to convalesce. Carr viewed himself as two books under his annual par, and he buckled down with flinty discipline. Carter Dickson began a work entitled “Night at the Mocking Widow;” John Dickson Carr, conscience-stricken, set out with all stops open on a number called “Below Suspicion.” Coatless, locked in their attic, sunk far in twin pits of concentration, the two struggled for priority. Never in Stevenson’s wildest fevers did Jekyll and Hyde grapple more passionately for the smoking retort. The two books grew concurrently. In a Sir Henry Merrivale mood, Carter Dickson would forge ahead; then, as Dr Fell asserted himself, John Dickson Carr would briefly hold the initiative. “Night at the Mocking Widow,” completed in six weeks, appeared in June, 1950. In a venture aimed at coördinating all his forces, and still a bit down in the production line, Carr is presently engaged in writing a long historical novel containing a mystery and based largely on biographical facts. The book will appear under the name of John Dickson Carr.\n\nTHOUGH a native American, Carr is currently having a little trouble getting acclimatised here, since he returned only in 1948 from a seventeen-year sojourn in England, the spiritual home of all detective writers. He had wished to prowl the native haunts of Holmes and Watson since his early childhood, and upon the publication of his first book, “It Walks by Night,” in 1930, he made the first of a series of ocean trips that culminated in his lengthy residence abroad. The next year, he married an English girl, Clarice Cleaves, and took up residence in London. Carr and his wife are vastly unexcited by Socialism, and by all other forms of herd living, but they endured the postwar British regime as long as possible. When it appeared that the happiest advices of government were likely to consist, ad infinitum, of orders to “tighten the belt another notch, men,” they decided, somewhat like the Pilgrims before them, to leave England in search of freedom.\n\nAt Mamaroneck, where Carr bought a house after returning to this country, he is politically free but imprisoned, as in the past, by one of the murkiest imaginations in the entire field of letters. There is scarcely a moment in the day when he is not fighting his way out of situations unbelievably grotesque. Ideas, nearly all of them frightful, scamper over his mind like rats across a cellar floor. J.B. Priestley once said, “Carr has a sense of the macabre that lifts him high above average detective-story writers,” and many reviewers, both American and English, have commented on his particular gift for the gruesome. “If there’s one thing I can’t stand, it’s a nice healthy murder,” Carr himself says. In England, he is published as Carter Dickson by William Heinemann, Ltd., and as John Dickson Carr by Hamish Hamilton, Ltd. This bewildering spectacle of a bisected man with four publishers may have contributed, Carr’s friends believe, to the growing complexity of his meditations. Further, he has come to identify himself with several fictional hawkshaws, including his own, and a fair sprinkling of felons, both real and imaginary, domestic and foreign. He is like an actor practicing several parts at once, and it often requires a spirited wrench for the authentic Carr to swim to the surface and take command.\n\nAt home, in harness, he ascends to his attic around 8 A.M., occasionally kicking out at dark corners en route to be sure they are not tenanted with the sort of citizenry he habitually creates. He carries a large percolator of coffee along, and he swills the brew, stepping downstairs for frequent refills, throughout the day. His wife estimates that he consumes around two gallons in a medium day and about a gallon and a half more than that on days when things get out of hand and his villains start outwitting his sleuths. Carr smokes cigarettes continuously and tosses the butts aside still lighted. By now, the floor, which in the main is uncarpeted, is liberally pocked with burns, and the atmosphere, despite his air-conditioner, is fragrant with the invigorating smell of scorched pine. In practically all respects, his chamber is conducive to the germination of macabre prose. On one long side, t has shelves bulging with reference books on every form of crime. “With the exception of the late Harry Hodge’s in Edinburgh, I believe my crime collection is the best in the world,” Carr says. His books fill not only his attic shelves but the shelves of a number of rooms in lower parts of the house. It is his pets, embodying the naked spirit of gore—several hundred rare volumes on poison, hangings, throat-slitting, dismemberment, witchcraft, and diverse rascality—that he keeps close at hand while he works. As a result, should he feel the dread encroachment of a wholesome mood, he has only to reach out for “The Bloody Assizes,” “The Hangmen of England,” “Lives of Twelve Bad Women,” “Dramas of the Dock,” or another such work, and, like Milton, shake off the vain, deluding joys.\n\nCarr is thought to be the only non-government employee ever to own a copy of the top-secret English Coroner’s Official Handbook of Poisons. The slender volume, as valuable to him as “Fannie Farmer’s Cookbook” is to a young bride, came into his possession by some means too dark even to hint at. “Aha!” is as close as he ever gets to a detailed explanation. Digging away at a new thriller, in which poison must take its deadly toll, Carr consults the handbook often, remarking, perhaps, the characteristic smell of prussic acid (much like that of almonds), or taking quick notes on the antidote to an overdose of ratsbane (swallow some good emetic). Carr also is fortunate in having the “Complete Newgate Calendar,” several dusty volumes containing, among other things, minutes of the animated proceedings in that fabled old English centre of incarceration and punishment. The series is a treasure-trove of outré criminality and original mischief. Carr has vowed, in all seriousness, that he would not exchange it for a first edition of “Beowulf.” Among the rarest of his literary belongings, and certainly among the most useful in his work, is a book, printed in the early eighteenth century, that presents the verbatim court reporting of several ancient upper-class British cases, including the treason trial of the Duke of Norfolk, in 1571; the trial of the Earl of Somerset, on a poison charge, in 1616; and the trial of Mary Queen of Scots, in 1586. “It isn’t generally known that they had a kind of shorthand in that time,” Carr says. “Every word they uttered in those cases was preserved, and I’ve got it all between covers.” Thus, writing about the period, Carr needn’t guess what the Duke of Norfolk said at his trial; the lilting sentences are available to be quoted exactly and with only a trifling danger of libel.\n\nFor accuracy and verisimilitude, Carr stands almost supreme among mystery writers. He is known as a fervent champion of the trivial detail. A passage involving esoteric swordplay, for instance, may set him burrowing through his library or hurrying off to the armour room of the nearest museum. He is able to solve superficial problems in this category at home, for the walls of his living room and study are liberally festooned with some of the finest specimens of the blade-maker’s art. Rapiers of Toledo steel, English smallswords, Italian stilettos, and other purposeful cutlery are greatly in evidence, and he is forever handling them with a peculiarly wistful look. He is likely to break off a conversation with a guest by snatching down a cutlass and flashing it through the air. Carr is an accomplished swordsman, and he deplores the explosive turn modern murder has taken. Some months ago, he visited his close friend Adrian Conan Doyle, the youngest son of the author, at his winter home in Tangier. They fenced pretty steadily for two weeks and, mounted, had a passage or two with lances. Then they worked on their plans to revive the old-fashioned joust. Carr and Doyle quite seriously hope to see the lists brought back as a testing ground for controversy; they both view humanity’s current practice of slaughter by firearms as woefully lacking in chic.\n\nCARR’s early history offers only a few guideposts to the spectral development of his genius. There is practically no accounting for the dark and labyrinthine hallways of his mind. Like Poe, who also lived in a world of umbrageous fantasia, he enjoyed the beginning serenity of a normal family circle. Poe’s descent into the maelstrom of his own imagination may conceivably have been a reaction from the pressures of West Point, but Carr had a boyhood comparatively free from coercion. He was born in 1906 in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, a tranquil place, though more than ordinarily menaced by witches, as attested by the colourful hex signs on the Pennsylvania Dutch farmers’ barns. As a small boy, Carr avoided witches and attended the local schools without achieving special distinction. His father is a lawyer, and his grandfather had an interest in one of the daily papers of Uniontown. Young Carr, who was a child with an eager, prying mind, took to hanging around both his father’s law office and his grandfather’s newspaper. Then, merging his interests, he began to report various court news, concentrating on chatty items about murder cases, for the paper when he was eleven years old. By the time he was fifteen, he was conducting his own column, somewhat precociously entitled “Ignaz the Oracle,” and had emerged as an expert on prize fighting. The annals of American journalism offer few more striking examples of the prodigy at work than the infant Carr in Uniontown. Mark Twain set type in his early teens and wrote occasional libellous bits, but at eleven he was still fishing for catfish in the Mississippi River. As a child expert on murder and pugilism, Carr led a busy life. His remarks about sports were frank in the extreme, even insulting. The local fighters acquired the nervous habit of scanning Ignaz the Oracle, to note cases of fresh calumny, and several of them made public declarations that they would beat the columnist groggy if they ever caught him out without his parents. But Carr was wiry physically as well as mentally, and he outran them for years.\n\nWith the exception of a four-year stint in Washington, after his father had been elected Democratic representative from Pennsylvania, Carr remained in Uniontown until his early teens. Then, already a town character and slightly drunk with power, he rather condescendingly went off to The Hill School. The Oracle had become a municipal force in Uniontown, and Carr felt it undignified for a fully ripened sage to sit with children—many of whom knew nothing of murder and had only an elementary grasp of prize-fighting—waving pennants and screaming “Osky-wow-wow.” Notwithstanding the comedown, he entered cheerfully into the school life; he played baseball, he was tolerant of the students, and toward the end he even accepted several of the faculty as his peers. In this period, Carr, detached from journalism, embarked upon a regimen of reading that has not seen many counterparts anywhere. On an average, he knocked over a book a day, diversifying his selections to include not only works of entertainment but also volumes of immense significance. After the first flush of his enthusiasm had passed and he had absorbed nearly everything worth while printed in English, he fell victim to the Shakespearean prediction that murder will out. His taste, he found, was centring on offerings of violence. The seeds of horror planted in Uniontown had begun to burgeon at Hill.\n\nThe development of a good mystery writer, like that of a good mystery, is apt to be a tortuous process. There are subplots and false clues. At Hill, it seemed at one time that Carr might succumb to the ordinary. He was made editor of the school’s literary magazine, and he busied himself with bloodless essays on the new wing for the library and the follies of cribbing. He was regarded as a sound but preoccupied youth, and the authorities prophesied that he would take his place in the Pennsylvania scheme of things in traditional Hill style. This viewpoint was modified later on when he went to Haverford and edited the literary magazine there. Murder, only dormant at best in his thinking, reappeared in the form of a mystery story minus the ending; he wrote it and put it in the journal, together with the princely offer of twenty-five dollars to the first person who came forward with the solution. It was, he felt, a foolproof puzzle, and he sat back with enjoyment to witness the discomfiture of his fellows. To his stunned dismay, a bored youngster came in about an hour after the magazine was distributed, presented a detailed and accurate solution, and, not unnaturally, asked for his cash. Carr, penniless, was obliged to call on his father to make up the deficit. His father, in a letter forwarding a check, inserted a gratuitous essay on the follies of mystery writing.\n\nThis incident marks an important step in Carr’s career. He had acquired, for twenty-five dollars, a deep respect for the technique of creating workable mystery stories. He learned that, unlike the goddess Minerva, mystery writers do not make their first appearance in a full-blown condition. He determined to learn the baffling art if it took every dime his father could raise. However, his colleagues on the magazine dissuaded him from further contests, and he pursued his studies in private. Thereafter, at college, Carr wrote ceaselessly on themes of death and terror, destroyed what he wrote, and relaxed from his labours by playing baseball, soccer, and cricket, a Haverford favourite. “I was never actually a member of the team,” he says today, sadly. “I had good shoulders and I was willing, but I was a little runty. I was one of those of whom, at the end of the season, they always said, ‘We also wish to thank…’”\n\nAfter his graduation, Carr made up his mind to attempt beautiful letters as a full-time occupation. In that period (1928), dozens of American writers, including one or two whose names became familiar, were clustered on the Left Bank, in Paris, growing beards, drinking absinthe, and talking away energetically at their profession. Carr concluded that France was a locale more often visited by the muse than others; with the hopeful backing of his family, he left home, taking a typewriter and plenty of copy paper, and shortly afterward arrived in Paris. One exposure to the high jinks at the Café Dôme and other centres of near-creativeness convinced him that the bohemian life was a matter of tinsel and sham. He decided on a revolutionary gesture. Instead of establishing himself in a garret and buying a beret, he engaged a handsome suite in the Rue des Eaux, on the Right Bank. He wore excellent clothes, took baths regularly, and, altogether, disported himself in such elegant style as to be a genuine affront to his countrymen in the genius wallows of the Quarter. At least once a week, he dropped over, with the lordly air of Diamond Jim Brady visiting the Bowery, and conducted missionary sessions. “Give it up, fellows,” he used to tell them. “Come on across the river and get a decent room. Buy a new suit. Trim your beards. Why don’t you quit talking about Art and get some work done?”\n\nCarr’s own work was proceeding apace. He turned out a mystery novel every two weeks or so and, as at college, discarded the entire output as unworthy. He made a little rite of piling up his manuscript in one of the several marble fireplaces of the flat and setting fire to it. Much later, when he had grown successful, he had cause to regret what he by then regarded as the acts of a dangerous pyromaniac. His case was roughly analogous to that of the novelist Jesse Stuart, who, while recently a public-relations officer in the Navy, explained, in a lecture to a class of naval indoctrinates, the capital loss he took on poetry. When he was a young Kentucky schoolteacher-writer, he dashed off hundreds of poems, Stuart said, and, finding the first few unacceptable by editors, tossed them into a poetry barrel in his basement. After the publication of his book “Taps for Private Tussie,” his poems were greatly in demand. Like other newly arrived writers with an inventory, he decided to unload, starting with the vintage verse. He went into his basement and found the barrel cleaned out by rats. “I sat down with a pencil and a notebook,” Stuart told his class, “and figured out that the rats had eaten a little over thirty-five hundred dollars’ worth of poetry.” Many of Carr’s Parisian tales, he reflected afterward, would probably have become marketable at high rates.\n\nIn 1930, still unpublished after two years abroad, Carr returned to New York. His fortunes did a turnabout almost immediately. In his hotel room, he wrote a mystery novel he entitled “It Walks by Night,” and, feeling that he had rung the gong at last, took it, with a letter of introduction from a mutual friend, to Henry Tomlinson, Jr., a salesman at Harper’s. Tomlinson, the son of the English author H.M. Tomlinson, was so impressed by the work that he practically forced it on the Harper chairman of the board, T.B. Wells, who wearily made a bet that he could spot the murderer before page 200. Not only did he lose the bet, Wells said later, but so intricate was the spider-web of Carr’s plot that he wasn’t entirely sure about the murderer after he’d finished the book. In any case, he was able to recognise the truth—that Harper’s had, by a lucky accident, discovered a first-rate performer—and the stately old house brought up its heaviest promotional artillery. It has been observed that a publisher’s apathy over a non-selling book can be matched only by his frenzy for a probable winner; Harper’s, in the delirium of its new zest, took a page ad in the Times to announce the debut o John Dickson Carr with “It Walks by Night.” It was the first time the firm had ever allotted such space to a mystery, a kind of book that was then selling on an average of five thousand copies for Harper’s. Carr came through nobly in justification of his sponsor’s courageous outlay; “It Walks by Night,” a mystery involving a “locked-room” puzzle, a line of inquiry for which Carr is now noted, sold fifteen thousand copies and made the usual post-mortem trips through the consecutive purgatories of the reprint market.\n\nAT the ageo f twenty-four, Carr was a best-selling author in full stride, and he took up the unending search for a living program that would make for peak productivity—a nervous and inevitable accompaniment to artistic creation. His first situation was imperfect, though nourishing. He moved into a duplex flat on Columbia Heights, in Brooklyn, with Tomlinson and Edward Delafield, also a Harper’s salesman and a friend of Carr’s from his college days. It was an offhand, prankish household, given to mild roistering. Both Delafield and Tomlinson regarded themselves as singularly blessed, for they were able to sit back and watch a top mystery writer at work, an exhibit available to only the privileged few. Ideas came to Carr at odd moments. He was apt to come sprinting out of the shower, crying, “I’ve got it!” He would pick up a newspaper and, seeking out the crime notes, as was his habit, seize cheerfully on a brief, routine suicide. “He would begin to twist it and turn it around,” says Delafield, “and before long it would emerge as a full-fledged book plot. And the next thing we knew, he’d have it written and published.” Tomlinson once asked Carr if he had undue trouble with plots. Fixing him with a Holmesian glare, Carr replied, “I’ve had exactly a hundred and twenty complete plots outlined, for emergencies, since I was eleven years old.”\n\nWhen Carr was first with Harper’s, he was paid, according to publishing custom, every six months. It was an infelicitous arrangement for both Delafield and Tomlinson. Carr would take his money, board the first ship out of New York Harbor, and ride back and forth to Europe, or to the African Gold Coast, or to Madagascar, until he was financially exhausted. Then his roommates would receive a cablegram, from some remote port, saying, “MUST HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS IMMEDIATELY.” “That was always his sum,” says Delafield. “Two hundred and fifty dollars. I have no idea how he worked it out.” In any event, the demand often left Delafield and Tomlinson in a pecuniary mess, and their landlady in an even worse one. “I was always interested in John’s attitude toward money,” relates Delafield, who now is vice-president of Crown Publishers, Inc. (Tomlinson is living in England.) “He looked upon it as something to be got rid of right away. After a few of his trans-oceanic trips, I suggested to Harper’s that he be paid a hundred dollars a month. This more or less kept him landlocked and all of us solvent. But it by no means stopped his freehanded spending.” During most of his career, Carr has put all his assets in a checking account, even when he has been prosperous and able to invest. Once, asked about this curious quirk, he replied, “The time lag involved in liquidating securities and spending the money might make me nervous.”\n\nWhile in the flat on Columbia Heights, Carr demonstrated that he was also socially inventive. On the eve of a soirée the three men gave for some congenial ladies, he toiled all afternoon to rig up a humorous device. He attached a microphone upstairs to a radio in the living room downstairs and sneaked up often to add lurid comments to the program. The net result of his joke was worthless, however, since displaying a chronic weakness of the creative soul, he finally overdid it. As the group below were sipping refreshment, a shot rang out and a frenzied voice broke in, saying, “We interrupt with an important news bulletin from Italy—Premier Mussolini has just shot the American Ambassador.” Upon hearing this news, the ladies all got up and ran home, throwing the party out of joint. Delafield had an automobile, and Carr frequently borrowed it after a hard tussle with the mysteries. He almost never brought it back. “By golly, I did take the car,” he’d say. “Now, let’s see—I believe I parked it somewhere.” Delafield and Tomlinson would comb the streets, and sometimes ask the police for help. Carr’s own attitude toward the police represented, they thought, some atavistic reaction to authority. He would pick out a cop and follow him around on the beat, carrying on an impertinent monologue that fell just short of being actionable. Sometimes, he’d ask the officer to help him across a street, or salute him pompously when they passed each other. Then he’d search lawns with a magnifying glass, looking for clues, and take notes in a little black book. The police in the area knew him and treated him with heavy patience. “Why don’t you go on home, Mr Carr?” they’d say. “Write some more mysteries. Show us how a real detective works.” When the humour was on him, Carr made life chancy for his roommates with practical jokes. In return, they enlivened things for him. They were amused to learn that he had a bothersome phobia about sand. Toward the end of one party, when he became drowsy, they put him in the back seat of the car and deposited him on the beach at Coney Island, well down toward the water. He reported home the next day and didn’t mention the outing.\n\nOn one of his trips back from Europe, Carr met Miss Cleaves, who was en route to America to visit relatives. Their acquaintance ripened into romance, and they were married in New York in 1931. After the ceremony, Carr decided that creating fictitious detectives of classic outlines was awkward in a land of such uncomplicated violence. For months, his spirit had yearned for the refined grotesqueries of an older civilisation. The musty havens of mediaeval torture drew him like a beacon. As a group of Mid-Victorian painters returned to the pre-Raphael primitives for their inspiration, Carr looked back to Holmes and Dupin. With reluctance, he bade farewell to the birthplace of “It Walks by Night.” He was headed for England, and great successes, and an expatriate residence of such chameleon identification with the landscape that a critic was one day to say, “John Dickson Carr is surely the most English of all the writers of fine English mystery.”—ROBERT LEWIS TAYLOR\n\nPart 2\n\nIn the field of mystery fiction, John Dickson Carr, who also writes as Carter Dickson, holds a lofty and commanding position. As of a month ago, he had published forty-nine much-praised mystery novels, a factual account of a true murder case, a costume novel drenched with blood, and a biography of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He produces at the steady clip of four books a year, to the cheerful despair of his colleagues, whose dreams of overhauling him resemble the ambitions of racing greyhounds in pursuit of the pilot rabbit. Though outpaced, the members of Carr’s craft regard him fondly. Three years ago, upon his return from a seventeen-year sojourn in England, they elected him president of the Mystery Writers of America, a trade group greatly rent by squabbling. It was Carr’s pleasure, while serving a year’s term as president, to add coals to the blazing fires. He has a dramatic, mildly spastic platform manner, not unlike that of the late Sir Henry Irving, and he enjoys wringing emotion, however violent, from a crowd. (Carr’s theatrical gifts derive from his early childhood, when his father, a Pennsylvania lawyer and congressman, would stand him on the dinner table, while entertaining guests like William Jennings Bryan, and make him recite Shakespeare.) “For shame!” he’d cry at one of the monthly club meetings, held here at the Fontainebleau Restaurant. “Fie on this writing to please the public! Write for yourselves alone. Are you artists or cowards?” The members, dangerously stung, would leap to their feet shouting “How do you expect us to make a living?” and other pertinent remarks, and Carr would continue his goading. “It amused me to watch their congested faces,” he says. “It’s a healthy thing for writers to get worked up. It isolates the pressures.”\n\nParadoxically, more than half the members of the Mystery Writers of America prefer the term “detective novel” to “mystery novel.” Carr’s own definition of the latter is “a novel in which there is no mystery because the detective never sits still long enough to think he is mystified. If you see him in an armchair, it’s because somebody has hit him on the head with a blackjack.” On the other hand, a detective novel, according to Carr, is one involving a mysterious crime and setting forth all clues so clearly that the reader, if he has sufficient wit and curiosity, can solve the puzzle.\n\nThose are the basic distinctions drawn by an expert. To the general public, other breakdowns are available. Crime books featuring the “private eye,” or “peeper,” have been much in vogue of late, partly owing to their high suitability for movie use. In this category, the plots are simple. An agitated client enters the dingy chamber of the private detective in question, and engages him to unravel something pretty nasty. The client is then addressed with unbelievable rudeness, is told he will be charged around forty dollars a day for “expenses,” is asked for a retainer of three thousand dollars, and, in addition, is told to keep his nose clean or else he’ll find himself in a peck of trouble. While the detective eyes him with suspicion, the client, having bought protection, leaves. He is murdered on his way down the street. As a rule, several members of his family are murdered, too, and a few of his friends, and the sum total of these disasters makes the detective so angry that he goes ahead and clears up the mystery—though a little tardily, from the client’s standpoint. The solution is accomplished through a series of galvanic sorties too bewildering for the human brain to follow. The last third of the book is given over to explaining how it was done, and in the windup the detective marries the late client’s niece.\n\nOn the more genteel side, Mary Roberts Rinehart, in America, and Agatha Christie, in England, have been pace setters. Writers of the Rinehart school establish a locale in Newport, or Bar Harbor, or some other fashionable centre, and devote considerable space to séances. The murderer is the butler. For the most part, the characters are so relentlessly upper-class that if it becomes necessary to identify a maid-servant by name, it is usually explained that she has royal blood on her mother’s side. The murder is done for pecuniary reasons, involving an abstracted will, and the final explanation leaves several stray ends dangling in the supernatural. “Then what was it that caused the curtains to tremble?” inquired Dick Goodall (Yale, “Bones”), and his aunt, who was shot at but missed, replies softly, “I suppose we shall never know.” In these novels, from one to five persons are living in secret compartments opening off the central staircase. In England, Miss Christie and her disciples have immortalised the sinister tennis party. Ten guests who detest each other cordially arrive at a country house on Thursday night for a long weekend. The atmosphere is so charged with peeve, irritation, jealousy, and boredom that it is no great surprise to anyone, not excluding the reader, when the group begins to be chopped off one by one. The murderer, Major Peavine, a man whose conversational range extends from “Ho? Jolly good. Quite” to “Dashed bounder. Mean to say!,” is launched on his program of multiple carnage largely by accident, and, the implication is, should probably be forgiven. To the Major’s dismay, the guests include a Colonel Burke-Wynkoop, who, in one of the dirtiest episodes in British military history, stole Peavine’s gem of a batman when they were “out there,” or serving in the Indian Army. The theft has been preying on the Major’s mind for thirty years, and at last he is able to square the account, with a polo mallet, and have several cadavers left over.\n\nThe British influence is strongly felt in John Dickson Carr, who has explored the best English avenues and opened a number of new ones, chilly in character. He has not, for example, ignored the tennis party, obviously a first-rate device for assembling a quorum of suspects. In “The Problem of the Wire Cage,” he kills Frank Dorrance, a loathsome youngster, on the court itself, a new wrinkle briskly applauded in the mystery world. Carr’s principal deviation from the English school is his preoccupation with spooks. Witchcraft and demonology have high priority in his literary arsenal. It is Carr’s Halloween mind that sets him apart from his guild. He is unable to read of the simplest unattended death without hearing a faint chorus of incantations. On any moonlit night, he would scarcely be surprised to find a whiskered band of druids practicing their happy rites in Central Park. In his “Below Suspicion,” the law-abiding characters, in present-day England, run up against a society of practicing witches as cohesive and successful as the Garment Workers’ Union. “Satanism,” observes the author at one point. “The flesh and the devil. Black candles burning at a human altar, under a reversed cross. Red garters and laces and strings, withered with the evil of the past.”\n\nCarr’s women represent an important contribution to mystery literature. “I can’t stand these anaemic, dimensionless, overcivilised heroines,” he says. “Women ought to be healthy and ripe.” Perhaps because of his long absence abroad, he has a more candid attitude toward sex than most American mystery writers. Carr’s women love life; their sweaters are full, their blood warm. In “Night at the Mocking Widow,” he establishes the rounded appearance of Joan Bailey with a quick apt simile. “ ‘Listen, my wench,’” says Sir Henry Merrivale, “frankly looking her up and down. ‘Did anybody ever tell you you’ve got a figure that would make Aphrodite look like a laundry bag in a thunderstorm?’” Then Miss Bailey meets the local vicar on the inevitable tennis court: “ ‘Good,’ said the Rev. J. Cadman Hunter to himself. It is possible that he was much attracted by the blue-eyed brown-haired Joan. She wore shorts and a sleeveless blouse, which…still, it is possible he did not even notice this.” In “Below Suspicion,” SPOILER Carr’s chief female character, Joyce, a girl with a winner of a body, turns out to be the witches’ leader and a pious devotee of organised sex orgies. She comes within an ace of seducing Patrick Butler, a lawyer-detective:\n\nJoyce also stood up. They were so close they could almost have touched each other. Joyce moved closer.\n\n“Oh? What did you dream?”\n\n“I dreamed I was kissing you, just as I kissed Lucia before that.”\n\n“Only kissing?” murmured Joyce. “How tame your dreams must be.”\n\nButler, who is torn between taking a cold shower and hearing more, is saved when Joyce, unstable, like so many witches, breaks off and shoots him in the chest.\n\nCarr’s two detectives—Dr Gideon Fell (John Dickson Carr) and Sir Henry Merrivale (Carter Dickson)—are violently different types. Fell is wildly eccentric, though dignified; Merrivale is a rowdy buffoon, given to low-grade profanity and pratfalls in the public square. “Fell is G.K. Chesterton, of course,” says Carr. “Chesterton and his Father Brown stories were idols of my boyhood. When I got going good, I decided to create a detective in the great man’s image.” In “The Man Who Could Not Shudder,” Carr presents Fell in a few graphic sentences: “Vast and beaming, wearing a box-pleated cape as big as a tent, he sat in the centre of the gaudy swing with his hands folded over his crutch stick. His shovel hat almost touched the canopy overhead. His eyeglasses were set precariously on a pink nose; the black ribbon of these glasses blew wide with each vast puff of breath which rumbled up from under his three chins, and agitated his bandit’s moustache. But what you noticed most was the twinkle in his eye. A huge joy of life, a piratical swagger merely to be hearing and seeing and thinking, glowed from him like steam from a furnace. It was like meeting Father Christmas or Old King Cole.”\n\nSir Henry Merrivale, or H.M., a bald, pigeon-toed, barrel-shaped man with “a lofty, lordly sneer,” may be Carr’s favourite of his two detectives. “He’s a composite,” says Carr. “There’s a lot of Churchill in him, and some other people I know in England, and possibly even a little of me.” Merrivale is constantly finding himself in situations of exploded dignity. In one book:\n\nH.M., his Panama hat crushed over his eyes, lifted both fists to heaven. From his lips issued such a torrent of profanity, such a picturesque arrangement of obscenities, that upper windows flew up along the street like a trick effect in a musical revue.\n\n“I beg of you!” moaned Danvers.\n\n“—!” said the great man.\n\nSir Henry’s peculiarities, Carr feels, provide an unusual contrast to the behaviour one would associate with the holder of “one of England’s oldest baronetcies.”\n\nThe creation of a memorable detective must involve a combination of ingenious mannerisms. Sherlock Holmes and his cocaine, his scraping at the violin (“he could play pieces, and difficult pieces”), his use of a Persian slipper as a repository for shag, his experiments with chemicals, his indoor practice with a revolver, set the stage for the lively band that has followed. Poe’s Dupin, who preceded Holmes, and whose birth, in “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” in Graham’s Magazine in 1841, was a comparatively normal man, with only extra-sensitive powers of ratiocination to give him distinction. In the years between Poe and Doyle, the French writer Emile Gaboriau took the field with a pair of detectives—M. Lecoq, a professional, and Père Tabaret, an amateur—who were somewhat friskier than Dupin, and the Englishman Wilkie Collins produced the first full-length detective novel in English, “The Moonstone,” starring one Sergeant Cuff. Most mystery writers today consider this book the preëminent classic in its category.\n\nThe sensational popularity of Sherlock Holmes, beginning with “A Study in Scarlet,” in 1887, has been skilfully described by John Dickson Carr in his biography of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, published in 1949. After Holmes, the spreading rash of detective stories returned to America—fairly quiescent since Poe—in 1907, with the writing of “The Thinking Machine,” by Jacques Futrelle. It was early in the twentieth century that Mary Roberts Rinehart, combining detection and mystery, established a positive trend in this country, and a couple of decades later Dashiell Hammett, an ex-Pinkerton agent, introduced the unsentimental, skull-cracking note that has been so grievously imitated. Despite the most frenzied and laudable efforts, nobody since Doyle has been able to create a detective as appealingly human as Holmes. Experts, attempting to assay the peculiar magic of the stringy figure in the deerstalker cap, agree in general that it is an air of comfort at 221b Baker Street, of sport for the sake of English chivalry rather than for cash, that gives Holmes one of his extra measures of verve. And when Holmes extracts a check for six thousand pounds from the Duke of Holdernesse (in “The Adventure of the Priory School”) for telling the nobleman where he has secreted his own son, the reader accepts it in the spirit of mercenary good fun. Agatha Christie’s Hercule Poirot, though able, is an excitable Belgian given to making irritating references to his “little grey cells”. Dorothy L. Sayers, another of the leaders of the present-day English school, solves her highly regarded problems through the odd offices of Lord Peter Wimsey, an inflexibly flippant young man who looks like a film actor and wears a monocle. In this country, Rex Stout has fashioned perhaps the most eccentric detective on record, in the person of Nero Wolfe, a man so grossly overweight that he is unwilling to vacate his premises for even the simplest investigation. Devoted to horticulture and to the sedentary life, Wolfe cleans up messes, aggravated by police fumbling, through those incandescent flashes of divination that Doyle attributed to Sherlock Holmes’ lazy brother, Mycroft.\n\nWHEN Carr was a very young man, his paramount social ambition was to meet Chesterton, whose vivid swashbuckling was adding lustre to the English literary scene. When Carr was an older young man, the meeting was booked, and the place set, but it fell through, under tragic circumstances. The broken date represents one of the toughest blows of Carr’s life to date. He had won the privilege through his literary success in England, where he moved, with his British-born wife, in 1931, in an effort to get close to the masters, dead and living, of his craft.\n\nThe couple first settled in Bristol, where Mrs Carr’s family resided. Carr, with an American mystery-novel triumph, “It Walks by Night,” to his credit, began the series of subsequent books that rapidly brought him to the attention of the innermost circles of mystery connoisseurs, both domestic and foreign. “I’d arranged for two American publishers before I left—Harper’s for John Dickson Carr and William Morrow for my new pen-name of Carter Dickson,” he says. “In addition, two British publishers agreed to take me on—Hamish Hamilton for Carr and William Heinemann for Dickson. The American firms were sending me a total of two hundred and twenty-five dollars a month to live on, and we made out. We dined on black tea, had very little heat, and no social life. But I fired off the books at the rate of four a year, and presently Dorothy Sayers gave me a whopping, magnificent review in the Sunday Times in London. I was established overnight. Sales began to boom on all four fronts, and they’ve kept on going.”\n\nIn the early days of Carr’s English travail, his recreational life consisted of frequent trips to Dartmoor, where he got in the mood by staring at the prison and walking in solitude over the mottled barrens. As Holmes had once camped out on the moor near the great Grimpen Mire, Carr sat with a box lunch in the vestigial dwelling places of Neolithic man. then, infused with a sufficient dosage of the horrors, he would make haste for home and set to work before his humour brightened. Mrs Carr, who, socially, regarded Neolithic man as a closed book, preferred to spend her time with his present-day descendants, and she usually visited her family. Not long after Miss Sayers’ laudatory piece in the Sunday Times, the Carrs moved to London, and Carr, his star in the ascendant, took his place in the literary life of the British capital. He was elected to the Savage and Garrick clubs, and, at last, was made a member of the ultimate in mystery writers’ groups, the small and snobbish Detection Club in London. Chesterton then reigned as president, handing down decisions on how books were to be written, how the plots unfolded, how the characters drawn, how the standards uplifted in general. Carr put on his best suit for his presentation to his hero, but Chesterton died shortly before the meeting. In all his appearances at the club thereafter, Carr has tried to behave in a manner that he believes Chesterton would have approved.\n\nThe Detection Club is ritualistic in form, verging on the Oriental. At the annual initiation for new members, by sickly candlelight, a black-robed skull-bearer marches down a central aisle, exhibiting his grisly offering. Then, a nice emotional balance between this world and the next having been struck, the president goes into a mumbo-jumbo stating the club’s creed, in the form of questions, which the initiates, under an oath, answer in mournful concert. Among the questions, the following are pivotal: “Do you solemnly swear never to conceal a vital clue from a reader?” “Will you honour the King’s English?” “Do you promise that your detectives shall well and truly detect the crimes presented to them, using those wits which it may please you to bestow upon them and not placing reliance on nor making use of Divine Revelation, Feminine Intuition, Jiggery-Pokery, Coincidence or the Act of God?” “Do you promise to observe a seemly moderation in the use of Gangs, Conspiracies, Death-Rays, Ghosts, Hypnotism, Trap-Doors, Chinamen, Super-Criminals and Lunatics; and utterly and for ever to forswear Mysterious Poisons unknown to Science?” Chesterton, during his polychromatic tenure, had two basic precepts for his flock: (1) the detective story should be carefully written, and (2) it should play strictly fair with the reader in the matter of clues.\n\nCarr feels that these high-minded standards have elevated the whole field of English detective fiction. With the shade of Chesterton over his shoulder, he toils with dreadful anxiety to make his work both literary and explicable. First, in the preparation of a new book, he draws up what he calls a “clue outline,” marking points in the narrative at which he plans to plant the signposts to the guilt of whichever fiend he is building. Then, with elaborate pains, he makes working sketches of the characters, sometimes promoting minor players to star roles, and the reverse, as he goes, depending on how they respond to the call to creation. He jots down snatches of dialogue as he visualises the characters and hears their speech in his mind. Plotting is easy for Carr—he habitually sees the entire network of human relations as a slough of intrigue—and the blocking out of the separate scenes is perhaps his favourite chore. He hates the actual writing, however, and does it in anguish, emerging from each long session hollow-eyed and spent. As one of his detective-writer friends has remarked, “This is a hell of a tough rap for a man who has to write four books a year to stay happy.”\n\nIn a recent novel, Carr expressed, through a character, his philosophy of living, working, and success:\n\n“…scrimp and save, scrimp and save, to the meanest little farthing that’ll get you steerage passage through the Malay Straits or a bug-filled room in San Francisco! But that’s not the way to do it… If you can’t afford to travel first-class, with special tips for special favours, then don’t travel at all.\n\n“That means work. And rightly! At my job, it means work , work, work, grind, grind, grind, eighteen hours a day or twenty if you can stand it. Never look away; never look up. No other activities except books; no holidays; who wants a silly trip to St. Ives when you’re headed for the Mountains of the Moon? Hit ’em with book after book; force ’em to recognise you; make ’em know you’ve got quality; grind, grind, grind, for five years, ten years, even fifteen years…\n\n“Well, it doesn’t take quite as long as that. About halfway through—you don’t know why; nothing seems to have made a dent—all of a sudden it changes. Streams of cash begin to come running in from all directions. Suddenly you realise you’re nearly at the top. But you must make sure, Joan. You must make sure.”\n\nDuring the time when Carr was grinding away at books, he drew severe lines in his own reading. He is intolerant of “high-brow” writers and critics and their sycophants. He clings to the belief that a good story is necessary to a good novel, and he abhors the pretentious obscurity that he thinks has crept into literature. His detective creation Sir Henry Merrivale has his say on the subject in “Night at the Mocking Widow”:\n\n“And speaking of windows, here are these three Russian crutch-walkers on the table by the bed. We’d better get rid of ’em now.”\n\nThere was a whir of leaves and then three separate thuds as Dostoievski, Tolstoy and Chekhov flew out of the open window and struck the bole of an oak tree.\n\n“The thing is,” explained H.M., “I want you to read some fellers named Dumas and Mark Twain and Stevenson and Chesterton and Conan Doyle. They’re dead, yes; but they can still whack the britches off anybody at tellin’ a story.”\n\nEngland took profitable advantage of Carr’s story-telling ability during the war. He was assigned by the B.B.C. to dig up and dramatise for the radio morale-boosting feats of counter-espionage and general underground activity. In making the assignment, the B.B.C. was fortunately unconscious of the snowball of force it was releasing for the public weal. Carr continually got the B.B.C. in hot water, of a pleasant sort, by scooping the press on important stories. He circulated among the underground folk like a wartime Warner Brothers blonde. Most of his stories ran along the lines of his own fictional situations. On one occasion, he presented a corking program about a supposedly hunchbacked Pole, who went around with a walkie-talkie secreted on his back and actually had no deformity. Again, he told of a blind French fiddler whose fiddle bow was a gun and who was given to interrupting melodies to knock off stray members of the German occupational force. The B.B.C. got especially warm responses to Carr’s series on the Belgian underground, which appears to have been among the sprightliest in Europe. In Brussels, the German masters and their collaborationists published a daily paper, emetic in tone, called Le Soir. The underground, rounding up the best journalistic brains in the country, began to sprinkle here and there a facsimile impossible, at first glance, to distinguish from the original. It appeared sporadically and threw the city into a violent uproar. The front page would perhaps be given over to a rousing description, with nicely faked pictures, of a narcotics raid involving the local gauleiter’s wife. Once it ran a spirited account of a disagreement and fist fight between Hitler and Mussolini. Occasionally, it reported a German surrender. The residents of Brussels, entering into the spirit of the broadcasts, besieged the German headquarters with calls, rioted in the streets, and created general havoc.\n\nCarr received one small official reprimand during his B.B.C. days, as the luckless victim of intramural joking. One of his programs, which he called “Girls at the Guns,” featured a girl radio “talker,” or plane spotter, at work in the days of the Battle of Britain. The talkers used a code, a kind of gibberish. Doing his reporting in the field, crawling from talker to talker in the midst of heavy raids, Carr faithfully copied off several sentences, realising their splendid dramatic value. But he was unaware that the robust girl talkers, during lulls, relaxed with profanity of an exceptionally purple order. Carr’s radio report, which proved to be intelligible to a great many people, started off with the code for “To hell with Hitler” and rapidly increased in eloquence. His script was called in for scrutiny, he was dressed down, and the script was returned with the red-pencilled notation “All right this time. Don’t do it again.”\n\nCarr led a migratory sort of life in England during the war, for he was bombed out of three separate establishments. A fine house that he and his wife and their two small children moved into, at 118a Maida Vale, in 1940, was destroyed shortly thereafter. Having ust sent the children out of London for safety’s sake, Carr and his wife, who belonged to the school that advocated ignoring the bombs rather than diving underground, were seated in their living room, reading, when they heard a whistle, a heavy hiss, and a series of thunderclap concussions, and then found themselves on the floor, blinded by dust. The first thing Carr noticed when he got up and cleared his eyes was that they now had an uninterrupted view of their garden, the wall on that side being absent. Neither he nor his wife was injured, but the house was almost a total wreck. He removed the family’s headquarters to Bristol, and his cottage there was hit, without serious consequences to the inhabitants, a month or so afterward. By this time, Carr had taken on a slight persecution complex, and he set himself up alone, to do his work, at the Savage Club. While he was sipping a whiskey sour at the bar one evening, at the club’s most hallowed hour, a whacking great explosion shook the brotherhood, spilled several drinks, and tore out the wall behind the bar, leaving Carr and three or four other sippers staring off into space. The comments at the bar as the members viewed the spilled whiskey were, Carr believed, indicative of the impassioned British attitude in crises, and boded no good for the Hun. One fellow said, in an uncommonly loud voice, “Really, now!;” another remarked bitterly, “Scarcely done;” and there were additional indictments. To Carr, the episode represented another strong reminder that there will always be an England.\n\nAfter seventeen years in that country, Carr would feel acutely deprived without an England. So steeped did he become in English ways that his speech has a faint Oxonian accent, his idiom is less American than English, and the bulk of his fictional works have to do with England. He says that the professional high point of his life to date was the richly English experience he had with the Doyle family while preparing his well-received biography of Sir Arthur. Carr and Adrian Conan Doyle, the writer’s third son, first met casually, at a party, in 1941. Later, when the B.B.C. undertook a radio dramatization of “The Lost World,” Adrian Conan Doyle asked that Carr be persuaded to act in an advisory capacity on the script. The two men became friendly, and it developed that the Doyle family, smarting because of what they considered an inadequate biography Hesketh Pearson had done of Sherlock Holmes’ creator, were interested in having somebody write the definitive work. Carr, consulted about this, journeyed to Bignell Wood, Adrian’s home, in the centre of a gigantic forest, and made a preliminary survey. He was apprehensive about the touchy factor of spiritualism, which the Doyle family fervently embraces. “But see here,” Carr kept saying, “I’m no spiritualist, you know. I’m open-minded about everything, I hope, but I’m no spiritualist.” He had the calm assurance of Adrian Conan Doyle that his religious or metaphysical tastes would be of little moment in the preparation of the biography.\n\nCarr spent a great deal of time in the homes of Sir Arthur’s progeny. It was a delicate proposition. Late at night, the family would be seated in the library, say, and a banging noise would issue from the billiard room. “What’s that?” one of the ladies might cry, springing up. “Dear me, do be seated,” another member would say. “It’s only Father looking for his pipe.” “To be sure. Of course,” Carr would echo heartily. “Sir Arthur looking for his pipe.” And they would settle down again. It was often difficult, he recalls, when lowering himself into a chair, to resist arching back hastily and calling out, “Oh, beg pardon, Sir Arthur!” Carr has intense respect for all the Doyle family, and he undertook his biography with the idolatrous regard for Arthur Conan Doyle that almost every mystery writer has. The job represented, in fact, a mystery writer’s dream of heaven. There were more than twenty trunkfuls of memorabilia and sixty scrapbooks covering Sir Arthur’s life from the age of ten. Carr grazed in these pleasant pastures for a year, and became very close to the family. He learned about members, dead and living, so intimately that when he met Denis Conan Doyle, another of the author’s sons, some time after he’d started the project, he blurted out, “Oh, yes, I knew your father well.”\n\nThe task, including research and writing, took Carr two years, an unprecedentedly long time for him to devote to a book. He was sorry to see it end, and he has kept up his association, through correspondence and visits, with the Doyle family. In the course of doing the book, he made several important discoveries, chief among them the fact that Sherlock Holmes’ stout-hearted but unimaginative side-kick, Watson, was drawn from a counterpart in real life. In going through some old records, Carr found that Arthur Conan Doyle had belonged to, and taken an active part in, the Portsmouth Literary and Scientific Society, whose president was a Dr James Watson. Carr was more or less prepared for some such revelation, for he, and many others, had long before noted the slip made by Watson’s wife, in “The Man with the Twisted Lip,” when she referred to her husband as James, instead of calling him by his correct name of John. Carr’s discovery was greatly approved of by the London press, and was made much of here in 1949, when Carr was guest of honour at a dinner given by the Baker Street Irregulars, a cult that assembles periodically to do posthumous homage to Doyle and dig frantically into his writings.\n\nNOW in America, as before in England, Carr’s energies are poured almost wholly into his writing. He works all day every day, including Sunday, and often far into the night. He and his wife and their three children live in a rambling, porch-encircled house he bought in Mamaroneck three years ago. He does all his writing in the attic. Sometimes at night, restless, divorced from the muse, he prowls dark, dingy alleys until dawn, hoping to stray into one of those insoluble problems that rose continually in the lives of Holmes and Watson. But things untoward seldom happen to writers of fiction. On occasion, forcing the issue, he attends an autopsy at some doctor friend’s; in England he was often welcomed at such dubious rites by the late Sir Bernard Spilsbury, for many years the public pathologist. Both Carr and his wife like mystery movies, and see a good many. As a rule, he writhes and jerks with irritation, ticking off the flaws and the falseness, the transparency of the plots. Recently, watching a murder film n which the central figure was laid low by “calomel” poisoning, he leaped to his feet and stamped out, muttering in tones audible several rows distant, “Impossible! Balderdash! They’re trying to sell this rot to me?” As he passed a thunderstruck usher, he added, “No such poison.”\n\nSocially, Carr proceeds at a snail’s pace, finding that the high gaiety of cocktail parties takes a reckless toll of his creative force. In Mamaroneck, he sees a few friends of congenial interests. Half of Ellery Queen lives nearby, and several other mystery writers, intact, live in the general area. They are mildly disapproving of a new literary bent toward costume novels that Carr shows, but they are reassured by his promise that each such book will contain a rousing mystery. There can be no question that the mysteries will be extraordinary and phantasmic. Carr feels that De Quincey showed an artist’s appreciation of civilization’s most damned and applauded act when he chose, for a title, “On Murder as One of the Fine Arts.” If things go well, murder, in fancy dress, will out, with Carr, about four times a year, and society will be the richer for it.\n\n—ROBERT LEWIS TAYLOR"
