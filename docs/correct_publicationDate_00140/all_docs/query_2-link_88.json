        "text": "Grove Koger\n\nTravel encompasses a number of directions and dimensions. Although I’m accustomed to thinking “over there” when I write about the subject, travel can also include “up there” and “back then” as well as “what might have been” and “what might be.” In fact, I probably should have called my blog Worlds Enough.\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle (shown below in a 1914 portrait by Arnold Genthe) made use of a wide range of geographical settings, along with the past and the near future. Besides writing about Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson for much longer than he cared to, he also published historical novels and a small number of supernatural and science fiction works. And “The Horror of the Heights (Which Includes the Manuscript Known as the Joyce-Armstrong Fragment)” ranks near the top of this latter category.\n\nThe story purports to reproduce what remains of a damaged notebook found in a field in East Sussex. The pages record the theories and apparently final flying experiences of a daring amateur pilot, one Joyce-Armstrong. Noted among fellow flyers for his bravery and mastery of the sport, Joyce-Armstrong also has his quirks. He believes that there are “jungles of the upper air,” and he’s intent on penetrating them, carrying a shotgun with him.\n\nDoyle integrates the purely fantastic elements of the work within an unnervingly vivid framework: “I had hoped to reach an eternal stillness in these high altitudes, but with every thousand feet of ascent the gale grew stronger. My machine groaned and trembled in every joint and rivet as she faced it, and swept away like a sheet of paper when I banked her on the turn, skimming down wind at a greater pace, perhaps, than ever mortal man has moved.…\n\n“When I reached the nineteen-thousand foot level, which was about midday, the wind was so severe that I looked with some anxiety to the stays of my wings, expecting momentarily to see them snap or slacken. I even cast loose the parachute behind me, and fastened its hook into the ring of my leathern belt, so as to be ready for the worst.… But she held together bravely. Every cord and strut was humping and vibrating like so many harp strings.”\n\nBut will the pilot and his reassuringly solid machine (and his shotgun) be a match for what might lurk in the jungle overhead?\n\n“The Horror of the Heights” was published in The Strand Magazine for November 1913, and over the following years was reprinted in several other periodicals. Book publication came in Doyle’s Tales of Terror and Mystery (John Murray, 1922), and over the past few decades, it’s become a staple of anthologies.\n\nThe most attractive version of the story I’ve seen is an oversized Calabash Press edition, which was published “in conjunction with the Sherlock Holmes Collections at the University of Minnesota Libraries, the Arthur Conan Doyle Society, [and] the Norwegian Explorers on the occasion of their co-sponsored conference, 11-13 June 2004.” The book reproduces Doyle’s original holograph manuscript and comes with notes, a preface by one of my favorite critics, Michael Dirda, and an essay by Thomas R. Tietze on “rationalism and imagination” in the story.\n\nBest of all, to my way of thinking, are reproductions of several black-and-white and color illustrations from the story’s periodical appearances, although oddly enough for a publication of this quality, not all the artists responsible are identified. Referring to the entry in the online Arthur Conan Doyle Encyclopedia, I’ve determined that the first and fourth images in today’s post are by Henry Reuterdahl. The third, which is the opening page of the Strand printing, is obviously the work of W.R.S Stott, while below is the cover of the Calabash edition.\n\nGrove Koger\n\nAmong the many, many books I bought as a boy from Boise’s now-vanished Book Shop, there were two handsome paperbacks that I still prize—The Lord of the Sea by M.P. Shiel and Om, the Secret of Abhor Valley by Talbot Mundy. Both were part of the Xanadu Library, an imprint of Crown Publishers of New York.\n\nEach volume described Xanadu on its back cover as “a new series of paperback books that are classics of imaginative writing. The Xanadu Library will be built around books on worlds that never were, worlds that might have been and worlds that still may be.”\n\nI can’t think of any words more likely to excite the imagination of a young boy anxious to learn about the wider world!\n\nAs far as I’ve been able to establish, the Xanadu Library ran to the eight volumes listed below:\n\nJames Churchward: The Lost Continent of Mu, 1961\n\nTalbot Mundy: Om, the Secret of Abhor Valley, 1961\n\nJames Branch Cabell: Jurgen: A Comedy of Justice, 1962? 1963?\n\nErnest Bramah: Kai Lung’s Golden Hours, 1962?\n\nE.R. Eddison: The Worm Ouroboros, 1962?\n\nAnatole France: The Revolt of the Angels, 1962\n\nM.P. Shiel: The Lord of the Sea, 1963\n\nIgnatius Donnelly: Atlantis: The Antediluvian World, ?\n\nThe Churchward and Connelly titles are ostensibly nonfiction, although they’re the sort for which the phrase “farrago of nonsense” might originally have been formulated. The others, however, are important works in their genres, although those genres don’t get a lot respect these days.\n\nOm, for instance, is a classic of Indian adventure that I would rank with Rudyard Kipling’s Kim, and The Lord of the Sea is a bizarre mixture of romance, revenge, and socioeconomic speculation. Rebecca West described its author as “a writer of imperial imagination who combines the scientific qualities of Wells with the mystery of Poe.” Cabell published ribald pseudomedieval comedies and was highly regarded by critics such as Edmund Wilson, while France won the 1921 Nobel Prize for Literature. Bramah wrote highly popular detective and pseudo-oriental tales, and Eddison a series of epic fantasies set on, of all places, the planet Mercury. Really!\n\nI suspect that Crown either had rights to the works or were able to procure the rights cheaply. For instance, it appears to have been the first American publisher of the revised, 1924 version of Lord of the Sea. All the authors were dead by the time Xanadu appeared on the scene, although Cabell had died as recently as 1958. Only two of the volumes bore cover illustrations—the Shiel (a sketch by an uncredited artist) and the Donnelly (a map of the Atlantic Ocean identifying the supposed location of the famous lost continent). The rest carried generic covers of overlapping circles in various muted colors.\n\nWhy weren’t there more titles? Most Xanadu volumes were solid, but dated, choices; their time had come and gone. There was competition from newer works with jazzier covers—Robert Heinlein’s Stranger in a Strange Land appeared in 1961, for instance—and those carried the day with most young readers.\n\n□□□\n\nXanadu, by the way, was the name of Kublai Khan’s capitals, although the spelling Shangdu is now more common. But we can be pretty sure that the editors at Crown had in mind not the real city but the fabled one that Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote about in his poem “Kubla Khan,” which opens with the lines “In Xanadu did Kubla Khan / A stately pleasure-dome decree.”\n\nToday, Shangdu is a ruin and Xanadu itself remains as elusive as ever.\n\nGrove Koger\n\nAs I explained in my October 30 post, one of the first science fiction novels I read as a boy was H.G. Wells’ famous War of the Worlds. In addition to its classic status, it served as the basis for a famous, make that infamous, radio broadcast. The paragraphs below conclude my description of that night and discuss the event from the perspective of Idaho’s capital city. The article originally appeared in the September/October 2014 issue of Greenbelt Magazine as “A Night to Remember.”\n\n□□□\n\n“It’s Coming This Way”\n\nThe end of the cylinder was seen to be rotating, and listeners heard the clank of a huge piece of falling metal. And then, on cue, Phillips described “something wriggling out of the shadow like a gray snake.” There was a “humped shape,” a “jet of flame” that set everything afire. “It’s coming this way now,” Phillips announced breathlessly, “about 20 yards to my right—”\n\nPhillips would not be heard from again, but an announcer brought on the commander of the New Jersey state militia to report that several counties in the area had been placed under martial law. There followed a series of self-assured comments from a Captain Lansing who described the scene as thousands of militiamen advanced on the cylinder. But then the captain’s voice turned anxious as he watched something rise out of the pit, something “rearing up on a sort of metal framework” and turning its heat ray upon the troops …\n\nMeanwhile\n\nHere in Boise, authorities were deluged with calls from worried residents. And no wonder. The program they were listening to was describing “one of the most startling defeats ever suffered by any army in modern times.” More of the mysterious cylinders had hit the earth! New York City was being evacuated as the Martians strode across the countryside in their monstrous tripods! Miraculously, Professor Pierson was back on the air, broadcasting from an empty house and wondering whether he might be the “last living man on earth.”\n\nAs the Idaho Statesman would report breathlessly the next day, “hundreds of radio listeners in Boise and vicinity verged on hysteria.” According to the paper, four of its reporters spent the hour of the broadcast trying to reassure frightened members of the public. One hysterical caller said that “hundreds of death machines” from Mars had “landed in New Jersey!” Another screamed, “They’ll be here in Boise by dawn!”\n\nIn Newark, New Jersey, hundreds of men and women were said to have run through the streets, their heads wrapped in towels and handkerchiefs to ward off the effects of the Martians’ poison gas. In Birmingham, Alabama, the pious gathered in groups to pray. Closer to home, in Concrete, Washington, the power went out during the broadcast. For a time, according to the Statesman, the town was “frantic.”\n\nBut Wait—\n\nUnlike the Statesman, the Boise Capital News reported that radio’s “super-catastrophe” didn’t create a panic in Boise. “Those who were accustomed to listening intelligently and thoughtfully … enjoyed the program, went off to bed and untroubled sleep.”\n\nIt’s difficult now to determine who was right, but studies suggest that things weren’t as bad as the Statesman claimed. In Getting It Wrong, W. Joseph Campbell argues that “most listeners … were neither frightened nor unnerved.” Instead, says Campbell, the broadcast gave American newspapers an “irresistible opportunity” to rebuke the new medium of radio, which was competing with the papers for advertisers. Much the same relationship exists today between older media and the Internet.\n\nJust as we can’t be sure of the extent of the “panic” that October night, we can’t be sure of what expectations Welles may have had. Not surprisingly, however, his sputtering Mercury Theatre got a new lease on life when Campbell’s Soup agreed to sponsor 13 more episodes. Given the broadcast’s date—the night before Halloween, remember—it was a lucky number indeed.\n\n□□□\n\nThe illustrations I’ve added to my article were drawn by Brazilian artist Henrique Alvim Corrêa for the 1906 edition of Wells’ novel.\n\nGrove Koger\n\nOne of the first science fiction novels I read as a boy was H.G. Wells’ famous War of the Worlds. It’s never been surpassed as an account of interplanetary invasion, and I doubt that it ever will be. But among its other claims to fame, it served as the basis for a famous, perhaps infamous, radio broadcast. This article, which discusses that event from the perspective of Idaho’s capital city, originally appeared in the September/October 2014 issue of Greenbelt Magazine. Given its length, I’ll post its conclusion tomorrow.\n\n□□□\n\nOctober 30, 1938, was a cool, rainy Sunday in Boise. It was also the day before Halloween, a fact that might have raised suspicions about what took place that night. But as events unfolded with ever-increasing rapidity, it must have been difficult to think clearly.\n\n“Merely a Coincidence”\n\nRadio listeners who had tuned in a few minutes late to The Mercury Theatre on the Air may have been intrigued to hear a report that “several explosions of incandescent gas” had been observed on Mars. The broadcast then returned to a program of dance music, but was interrupted again by another announcement. Listeners should stand by for an interview with one Professor Pierson, a “noted astronomer” with the Princeton Observatory.\n\nShortly afterward commentator Carl Phillips began his interview with Pierson, who was apparently at that very moment staring through a huge telescope at the red planet. He assured Phillips that while the chances of finding intelligent beings on Mars were a “thousand to one,” he could not account for the explosions.\n\nAt that point someone handing a message to Pierson, who examined it and then helpfully passed it on. At 9:15 PM Eastern Standard Time, Phillips read aloud, a seismograph had registered a “shock of almost earthquake intensity” near Princeton. The professor speculated that the shock was probably due to a meteorite of “unusual size” and dismissed its arrival as “merely a coincidence.”\n\nThings were starting to get interesting …\n\nMr. Welles and Mr. Wells\n\nWhat many listeners failed to note was that the director of The Mercury Theatre, a 23-year-old American named Orson Welles, was staging a dramatization of The War of the Worlds by British writer H.G. Wells. As it turned out, the novel proved ideal for the director’s purposes, although he moved its setting from England to the east coast of the United States.\n\nEven now, decades later, one sentence that Welles adapted from the novel’s opening stands out. “Across an immense ethereal gulf,” he intoned ominously, “minds that to our minds as ours are to the beasts in the jungle, intellects vast, cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.”\n\nOf course if you had tuned in late, as many listeners had, you would have missed the explanation. (And you may not have noticed that “Professor Pierson” sounded a lot like Orson Welles.) Some 40 minutes into the program there was a brief announcement identifying the dramatization for what it was, but by then there was plenty of cause for alarm.\n\nIt seems that a “huge, flaming object” had landed near Grover’s Mill, New Jersey, where Phillips had driven with Pierson. Half-buried in a pit was a “huge cylinder” that the ever-helpful Pierson estimated to be about 30 yards in diameter. There was a crowd that the police couldn’t contain. There was a “curious humming sound” that seemed to come from inside the cylinder. Then there was a scraping sound.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED\n\nThe marvelous illustrations I’ve added to my article were drawn by Brazilian artist Henrique Alvim Corrêa for the 1906 edition of Wells’ novel."
