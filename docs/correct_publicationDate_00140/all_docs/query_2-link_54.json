        "text": "Although Arthur Conan Doyle is best known for his stories about the detective Sherlock Holmes, he was a prolific writer whose other works include science fiction stories, historical novels, plays, romances, poetry, and non-fiction. First published in 1892, Beyond the City, unlike other Conan Doyle works, is set in suburbia and is concerned with women's rights. The history of three families intricately connected by fate, the story focuses on the character of Mrs.Westmacott, the feminist heroine who drinks stout and smokes cigarettes. The lives of 19th century women are beautifully portrayed in this novel."
