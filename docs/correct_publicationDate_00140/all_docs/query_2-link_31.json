        "text": "6 minutes ago, vodkafan said:\n\nApparently Christianity was Chesterton's big thing, he really deplored the fact that the world was becoming more secular and lots of people no longer believed.\n\nYes, I've given him a go, but there is a reason why he is not read much any more. I read The Napoleon of Notting Hill, which I seem to remember had some odd religiosity too, but not as much as The Man Who Was Thursday. Although NoNH was set in 1984, it could not really be called science fiction. I read his Father Brown stories, which are rather like Sherlock Holmes, but not quite as engaging. It struck me that these days he would be in great demand writing TV plots for series like Dr Who, only he didn't write women at all; he almost entirely ignored them. I think one or two of his poems are quite good. I may well ask for the Rolling English Road to be read at my funeral.\n\n@KEV67 Yeah, there's a few Professor Challenger stories and they're all based on science in some way, with Challenger giving his scientific theories. Supposedly Arthur Conan Doyle much preferred writing about Challenger to Sherlock Holmes. When he killed Sherlock it was so he could focus on this other character, but then there was so much uproar and demand for Sherlock to come back he gave in and carried on with that instead.\n\nWithout giving too much of the plots away: The Disintegration Machine,is literally about a scientist inventing a machine which can disintegrate a person and put them back together, quite an interesting early comment on weapons of mass destruction. The Poison Belt is about the what happens when the earth passes through a belt of poisonous ether (with Challenger and his friends watching the effects from a sealed room) and When the World Screamed is based on the idea that the mantle of the earth is actually a sentient being and if we could drill down far enough it could be alerted to the presence of humans. The Land of Mist is another Professor Challenger one, it's about the debate between science and spiritualism but it leans towards spiritualism more than science. There are some interesting examples of scientific experiments which attempt to prove or disprove the existence of spirits though as far as I can remember.\n\nJust thought maybe you could count Mary Shelley's Frankenstein too. Technically I think it's horror but I know there are people who argue it was the first real science fiction novel.\n\nI have The Invisible Man on my to-read list, it's one I'm really looking forward to\n\nOn 2017-6-11 at 0:00 AM, KEV67 said:\n\nFrankenstein does not actually have an awful lot of science in it. Frankenstein won't say how he made the monster, although it seemed to entail digging up body parts from the graveyard and torturing animals. Frankenstein said he made the monster very large because it was an easier scale to work with, not so fiddly. So, does that he made all the body parts from scratch? Where would you find bones and parts for a man that big.\n\nI agree, I remember the actual creation of the monster being an unexpectedly short part of the book. Still, some people do claim it was the first science fiction novel and, either way, it's a good book.\n\nInteresting thought on the size of the monster. I definitely got the impression that the body parts were stolen rather than made from scratch. The monster was supposed to be about 8 foot tall I think, which isn't actually impossible for a human, just really unlikely. Maybe we're supposed to assume that the way he was put together, or the odd combination of parts made him unusually tall?\n\nAnyway, regarding HG Wells' early science fiction: they must have been startling at the time. The late C19th seems to have been a period of change literature wise. All the great old Victorian authors were dead. The old triple decker novels were falling out of fashion. Arthur Conan Doyle was writing his detective books. Rudyard Kipling was writing his Empire and animal books. Science was advancing, yet technology was still in a half and half state. When Wells was writing in the Victorian era, we did not have radio, but we did have the telegraph. We did not have cars, so we still relied on horse power, but we did have trains. We did not really have much electricity, but we did have gas. Wells' books must have seemed explosive back then - short but totally original."
