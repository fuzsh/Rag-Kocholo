        "text": "“Our object, in the present work, is to endeavour to show that the presumed incompatibility of Science and Religion does not exist”. With this sentence, Balfour Stewart and Peter Guthrie Tait started the preface to the first edition of their best-seller The Unseen Universe or Physical Speculations on a Future State. Certainly, this statement is far from unusual. Many a book has directly or indirectly made the same claim; and a myriad of other works have defended the thesis of a supposed warfare between science and religion. As John H. Brooke’s work demonstrated, however, neither claim can be understood without delimiting the semantic field of the words ‘science’ and ‘religion’, and without undertaking a local (historical, philosophical, sociological,…) analysis of the particular endeavours to overcome, or to stoke, such conflict. In this paper, I want to draw attention to one Victorian attempt to address this issue by these two outstanding physicists of the moment. P. G. Tait was professor of Natural Philosophy in St Andrews and a major actor in the development of what has been called the Science of Energy. Together with William Thomson, probably the most influential scientist in Victorian Britain, he wrote in the 1870’s the magnum opus Treatise of Natural Philosophy, which was intended as the exposition of the mechanical foundations of all physics. B. Stewart was professor at Owens College, Manchester, and a well-known physicist and chemist. He had been trained in Dundee, St Andrews and Edinburgh, which makes him a paradigmatic case of Scottish Victorian science. Before his appointment at Owens, he had been the director of the Kew observatory. The Unseen Universe, which first appeared in 1875, was an immediate publishing success. Nevertheless, the argument of the book was (and is) far from clear. This is particularly evident in the reactions to the book, which range from the enthusiastic to the dismissive from both theological and scientific trenches. That stems, partly, from the fact that the book was put together in only a few months, as an urgent response to the much publicised address that John Tyndall had given in the 1874 meeting of the BAAS in Belfast. In that address, Tyndall had strongly defended a materialistic conception of Nature using the latest developments in physics, especially the conservation of energy, and Stewart and Tait thought it their duty to counter-attack materialists with similar arguments. But the result was, as I shall try to discuss, rather eclectic. Scientific theorems and principles were presented and slightly changed in order to fit in a vision of the universe with room for the spiritual. In doing so, they ended up touching upon every fibre of Christian doctrine, from the possibility of an immortal soul to the very notion of creation. Analysis of the latter is the aim of my paper. As William Carroll argues in this volume from a Thomistic point of view, the metaphysical notion of creation ex nihilo has, in Modernity, been seriously distorted and greatly watered down. Far too often, debates on the very existence of a god rely on notions of creation that identify it with organisation, law-giving, or extraordinary miracle-making. As I shall argue, The Unseen Universe is in no better position, falling into similar philosophical weaknesses. Furthermore, this book is one of many unfortunate examples in which the latest development in science is used as the corner-stone of all truth, scientific or otherwise, including also all religious truth. In the next section, I shall briefly discuss the intellectual ethos of the 1870s and the central role played by the principle of conservation of energy in shaping a particular vision of the world, after which I shall describe the central ideas of The Unseen Universe. In section four, I will focus my attention to the way the notion of creation is dealt with in the book and the philosophical questions that this treatment raises. I shall finish with a discussion of the main contemporary responses to the book and the arguments used to criticise it."
