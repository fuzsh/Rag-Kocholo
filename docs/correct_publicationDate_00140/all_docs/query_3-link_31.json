The books are ranked in our list below based on which titles have the highest overall score between all 3 review sites in comparison with all of the other books by the same author. The process isn’t super scientific and in reality, most books aren’t “better” than other books as much as they are just different. That being said, we do enjoy seeing where our favorites landed, and if you aren’t familiar with the author at all, the rankings can help you see what books might be best to start with.\n\nThe full ranking chart is also included below the countdown on the bottom of the page.\n\nHappy Scrolling!\n\nThe Top Book’s Of Arthur Conan Doyle\n\n50 ) The Poems of Arthur Conan Doyle: Collected Edition\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 48\n\nAmazon: 44\n\nLibraryThing: 45\n\n49 ) Our African Winter\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 45\n\nAmazon: 44\n\nLibraryThing: 45\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle traveled extensively. This eloquent travelogue recreates in amusing detail the difficulties ordinary tourists encountered while travelling abroad, while at the same time giving a lucid picture of colonial life at the early part of the 20th century.\n\n48 ) The Case for Spirit Photography\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 41\n\nAmazon: 44\n\nLibraryThing: 45\n\n47 ) Songs of the Road\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 48\n\nAmazon: 35\n\nLibraryThing: 45\n\n45 ) The Last Galley\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 39\n\nAmazon: 42\n\nLibraryThing: 43\n\nI have written “Impressions and Tales” upon the title-page of this volume, because I have included within the same cover two styles of work which present an essential difference. The second half of the collection consists of eight stories, which explain themselves. The first half is made up of a series of pictures of the past which maybe regarded as trial flights towards a larger ideal which I have long had in my mind. It has seemed to me that there is a region between actual story and actual history which has never been adequately exploited.\n\n45 ) The Land of Mist\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 42\n\nAmazon: 38\n\nLibraryThing: 44\n\nThis is the third and last novel in the “Professor Challenger” series, and is a marked departure from the previous tales. In this novel Challenger becomes a Spiritualist, and the novel strongly promotes the concept of Spiritualism. A belief strongly adopted by the author towards the end of his life. This novel was first published in a serial form in “The Strand” magazine July 1925-May 1928.\n\n44 ) A Duet, with an Occasional Chorus\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 40\n\nAmazon: 38\n\nLibraryThing: 37\n\n43 ) Three of Them\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 47\n\nAmazon: 44\n\nLibraryThing: 23\n\nBut it took the queerest shape – like many of his vagaries – for his ways were original. It be gan by sticking remarks of his own into his prayers, which were by no means of a humble or prayerful character. Thus he said, addressing his Maker, Please make me a good boy – which I am! At the dictation of his mother he said, Please teach me self-control to others, and added, please also teach others self-control to me. Finally he showed how much he needed this self-control by completely losing his temper, and charging in tears and fury, with clenched teeth and raging fists, at Laddie, who looked with gentle contempt at the furious figure, and re marked icily, Do blow your nose! Which brought the charge to an ignominious halt. That was a touch of Laddie’s knightly spirit, as cool, proud, and reserved before menace as he was soft and yielding to love.\n\n42 ) Songs of Action\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 20\n\nAmazon: 44\n\nLibraryThing: 45\n\nSir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle, DL (1859-1930) was a Scottish author. He is most noted for his stories about the detective Sherlock Holmes, which are generally considered a major innovation in the field of crime fiction, and for the adventures of Professor Challenger. He was a prolific writer whose other works include science fiction stories, historical novels, plays and romances, poetry, and non-fiction. His first significant work was A Study in Scarlet, which appeared in Beeton’s Christmas Annual for 1887 and featured the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes, who was partially modelled after his former university professor, Joseph Bell. Other works include The Firm of Girdlestone (1890), The Captain of the Polestar (1890), The Doings of Raffles Haw (1892), Beyond the City (1892), The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1892), The Exploits of Brigadier Gerard (1896), The Great Boer War (1900), The Green Flag (1900), The Hound of the Baskervilles (1902), and The Lost World (1912).\n\n41 ) The Guards Came Through, and Other Poems\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 46\n\nAmazon: 23\n\nLibraryThing: 37\n\n40 ) The Gully of Bluemansdyke\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 37\n\nAmazon: 23\n\nLibraryThing: 45\n\n39 ) The Poison Belt\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 33\n\nAmazon: 37\n\nLibraryThing: 33\n\nThe poison belt The disintegration machine When the world screamed\n\n38 ) The Coming of the Fairies\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 34\n\nAmazon: 35\n\nLibraryThing: 32\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle, best known as the creator of Sherlock Holmes but also a devout spiritualist, was entirely convinced by a set of photographs seemingly showing two young girls playing with a group of tiny, translucent fairies.\n\n37 ) The Edge of the Unknown\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 43\n\nAmazon: 27\n\nLibraryThing: 29\n\nA small, solid iron tank was filled with water. A man was placed inside, water completely covering him. Over this an iron lid with three hasps & staples was securely locked. The body was submerged & a clock began ticking off the seconds. In less than a minute & a half, the entombed man was standing calmly outside the tank, still dripping the locks had not been touched, the lid was still secure. Once again, the great Harry Houdini had confounded scientists & his audience by escaping sure death! How was it possible to survive this? His friend, Arthur Conan Doyle, thought the answer might lie in spiritualism. The Edge of the Unknown presents the evidence. Houdini’s powers comprised only one area on which Doyle focused attention. Here he details all he uncovered in decades of psychic investigation. Because he was convinced for that psychic occurrences could be explained by natural laws, he began a skeptic.\n\n36 ) The Wanderings of a Spiritualist\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 35\n\nAmazon: 27\n\nLibraryThing: 34\n\n35 ) The Mystery of Cloomber\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 27\n\nAmazon: 32\n\nLibraryThing: 36\n\nMaster of detective fiction, Arthur Conan Doyle here reveals his deep fascination with spiritualism and the paranormal. To his fellow residents on the remote western coast of Scotland, Major Heatherstone’s behavior seems far from orthodox. Spurning all attempts at friendship, he instead becomes a recluse in Cloomber Hall, forbidding his children even to leave their home. Yet unbeknownst to him, they strike up a friendship with the neighboring Hunter Wests, who slowly begin to learn the cause of the Major’s paranoia and his fear of the fifth of October.\n\n34 ) The Stark Munro Letters\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 19\n\nAmazon: 33\n\nLibraryThing: 35\n\nThis book an EXACT reproduction of the original book published before 1923.

Set in Napoleon’s era, it involves a Frenchman returning to his native land to join the Emperor’s ranks.\n\n31 ) The New Revelation\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 38\n\nAmazon: 3\n\nLibraryThing: 42\n\nhe (dis)connection between psychological (or scientific) and psychic mind is a subject that has baffled man for centuries. The phenomenon captured in a very particular way the attention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, a man in whom the analytic and artistic struggled for dominance, and inspired The New Revelation, originally published in 1918. The treatise deals not only with the issue of physical versus metaphysical, but also considers the problem of death (and afterlife) and the question of communication with the spirit world. Conan Doyle’s captivating prose and pragmatic, yet human, voice makes for an enlightening exploration of some eternally relevant questions-and possible answers. Scottish surgeon and political activist SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE (1859-1930) turned his passions into stories and novels, producing fiction and nonfiction works sometimes controversial (The Great Boer War, 1900), sometimes fanciful (The Coming of the Fairies, 1922), and sometimes legendary (The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, 1892).\n\n30 ) The Parasite\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 25\n\nAmazon: 27\n\nLibraryThing: 30\n\nThe skeptical Gilroy’s fiancEe, Agatha, is put into a trance to prove Miss Penclosa’s powers. This succeeds and Gilroy begins to go to the Professor’s house where Miss Penclosa practices her powers on him. Let me try to reason it out. This woman, by her own explanation, can dominate my nervous organism. She can project herself into my body and take command of it. She has a parasite soul; yes, she is a parasite, a monstrous parasite. She creeps into my frame as the hermit crab does into the whelk’s shell. I am powerless! What can I do? I am dealing with forces of which I know nothing. And I can tell no one of my trouble. They would set me down as a madman. Certainly, if it got noised abroad, the university would say that they had no need of a devil-ridden professor. And Agatha! No, no, I must face it alone.\n\n29 ) Rodney Stone\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 23\n\nAmazon: 20\n\nLibraryThing: 37\n\n28 ) The Green Flag and Other Stories of War and Sport\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 31\n\nAmazon: 38\n\nLibraryThing: 9\n\n27 ) The Firm of Girdlestone\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 17\n\nAmazon: 16\n\nLibraryThing: 37\n\n25 ) Round the Red Lamp: Being Facts and Fancies of Medical Life\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 48\n\nAmazon: 18\n\nLibraryThing: 3\n\nFifteen short stories, most of which emphasize the graver side of life. The red lamp is the usual sign of the general practitioner in England. Many of these tales have medical interest. The separate titles are: Behind The Times. His First Operation. A Straggler Of ’15. The Third Generation. A False Start. The Curse Of Eve. Sweethearts. A Physiologist’s Wife. The Case Of Lady Sannox. A Question Of Diplomacy. … and many more ..\n\n25 ) The Tragedy of the Korosko\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 29\n\nAmazon: 18\n\nLibraryThing: 22\n\nWritten in 1898, Arthur Conan Doyle’s classic tale of high adventure portrays an alarmist era of imperial sovereignty, invasive foreign policy, and religious extremism, positing the naivety of a group of Anglo-American holiday-makers against the unbending convictions of Middle Eastern banditti. Among others, a young American ingenue, her matronly aunt, a fusty old bachelor, a loving Irish couple, and an opinionated French graduate gather aboard the Korosko. But during a morning tour of the desert, they are taken hostage by a group whose intention it is either to convert them to Islam or to kill them. Conan Doyle brings his mastery of thrills and suspense to bear on this extraordinary tale of East meets West. Scottish-born writer and novelist Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is best remembered as the creator of the immortal detective Sherlock Holmes.\n\n24 ) The White Company\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 15\n\nAmazon: 27\n\nLibraryThing: 26\n\nNow order the ranks, and fling wide the banners, for our souls are God’s and our bodies the king’s, and our swords for Saint George and for England!” With that rousing proclamation, twelve hundred knights ride into battle, accompanied by the stalwart archers known as the White Company. Fueled by their appetite for glory, this motley crew of freebooters stands united in their unswerving devotion to the company commander, Sir Nigel Loring. Short, bald, and extremely nearsighted, Sir Nigel’s unprepossessing appearance belies his warrior’s heart and his chivalrous nature. The rollicking adventures of his company during the Hundred Years War center around Sir Nigel’s loyal squire, Alleyne Edricson. Raised in the sheltered confines of a monastery, young Alleyne comes of age amid the rough-and-tumble of armed conflict and the bewildering ways of courtly love. Best known as the creator of Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was also a passionate historian.

It did not seem fit to us that such a one as he should trouble his head about spondees and dactyls, or care to know who signed Magna Charta.\n\n21 ) Micah Clarke\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 24\n\nAmazon: 38\n\nLibraryThing: 3\n\n21 ) The Captain of the Polestar and Other Tales\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 29\n\nAmazon: 23\n\nLibraryThing: 13\n\n20 ) Round the Fire Stories\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 12\n\nAmazon: 33\n\nLibraryThing: 18\n\nOriginally published in 1908 and out of print for more than half a century, this collection of stories, complete with a Preface by the author, presents Sir Arthur Conan Doyle at his finest.

One of Doyle’s last literary efforts, this work traces the history of spiritualism through the early 20th century, and includes profiles of such prominent spiritualists as Emmanuel Swedenborg, Edward Irving, D. D. Home, Sir William Crookes, and Eusapia Palladino. Best known as the creator of Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) dedicated himself to the cause of spiritualism in later life. His passion for the paranormal led Doyle to such excesses as the ill-advised endorsement of Elsie Wright’s and Frances Griffith’s clumsily faked photographs of the “Cottingley fairies” in 1922.\n\n16 ) The Vital Message\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 43\n\nAmazon: 1\n\nLibraryThing: 9\n\nIn “The New Revelation” the first dawn of the coming change has been described. In “The Vital Message” the sun has risen higher, and one sees more clearly and broadly what our new relations with the Unseen may be. As I look into the future of the human race I am reminded of how once, from amid the bleak chaos of rock and snow at the head of an Alpine pass, I looked down upon the far stretching view of Lombardy, shimmering in the sunshine and extending in one splendid panorama of blue lakes and green rolling hills until it melted into the golden haze which draped the far horizon. Such a promised land is at our very feet which, when we attain it, will make our present civilisation seem barren and uncouth. Already our vanguard is well over the pass. Nothing can now prevent us from reaching that wonderful land which stretches so clearly before those eyes which are opened to see it.\n\n15 ) Mysteries and Adventures\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 1\n\nAmazon: 42\n\nLibraryThing: 9\n\n14 ) Sir Nigel\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 14\n\nAmazon: 6\n\nLibraryThing: 31\n\nSir Nigel is a historical novel set during the Hundred Years’ War, by the British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
