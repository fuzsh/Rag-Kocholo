        "text": "The Lost World is a good book for fans of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's work, with a decent plot, good characters, and sufficient details to keep the reader amused. Many people who have seen the TV series are sometimes disappointed with the book, however the series was definitely based on it. I found the constant fighting between the two professors to be annoying, however some may find it amusing. A good book, but it could have been better.\n\nThe Poison Belt is the continuation to the Lost World story with professor Challenger and his friends. A good book for those who liked the characters from the Lost World and want to see more of them, however not a great book. The plot is far fetched and the story is not good enough to make up for the plot. Some humour and interesting details, and short enough where it is not a big mistake to try reading this book.\n\nUnderground city is an enjoyable Jules Verne story about people who decide to live in a mine (there is a large subterranean cave in the mine). But unexplainable accidents plague the peaceful inhabitants and threaten to destroy their city.\n\nDracula starts out really well, in and old Transylvanian castle belonging to Count Dracula. Although we all know who and what Dracula is, the main character in the story does not. The narrative style is in the form of letters from different people and journal entries, which is interesting at first but becomes tiresome as the story progresses. After the first few chapters, the story shifts to England, and we hardly see Dracula again. The first few chapters excluded, this book is a waste of time.\n\nSir Gawain, is an excellent work that survived by way of a single manuscript. It is the tale of Sir Gawain, a knight of the round table who accepts a challenge from the Green Knight around Christmas, and must set out to find him in one year to fulfil the second half of a deadly challenge. However all is not as it seems. A good King Arthur story full of descriptions, deceit, and the Sir Gawain's quest for honour.\n\nThe epic poem of Beowulf, a mighty warrior, who fights numerous monsters. There are three parts to this epic poem, parts A and B happen when he is a young man, and part C happens fifty years later when he is king. This is one of the first great English works of poetry, though the plot is simple, the structure, and underling ideas are complex. A good book, and the inspiration for the Lord of the Rings. This book was almost lost in a fire in 1731 (as there was only one copy in existence) and was finally printed in 1815 when it started to become a popular work.\n\nThe Sign of the Four is the second Sherlock Holmes story and the action takes place before those in the short-story collections. One of the most interesting short novels by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Holmes and Watson must solve a complex case involving mystery, murder, and a man with a wooden leg."
