        "text": "Early progenitors of science fiction, from Mary Shelley and Edgar Allan Poe to Jules Verne and H. G. Wells, found that to work in an emerging and as yet undefined genre, conventions had to be broken down and reassembled. As the genre began to find its feet, it became a Frankenstein’s monster of various forms such as the detective, adventure and gothic narratives, but with a new focus on scientific and historical authority which reflected the growing prominence of Marxist, Freudian, and Darwinian thinking. The destruction of convention involved in the creation of science fiction was reflected in the form of these works, often composed of fragmented and unreliable narrative sections, and in their subject matter, which often featured the destruction of a familiar world to create the defamiliarized settings required of their fantastical plots.\n\nBrian W. Aldiss and David Wingrove in Trillion Year Spree, Kingsley Amis in “Starting Points,” and Mike Ashley in The Time Machines credit Mary Shelley as being a foundational figure in the construction of science fiction. The simultaneous rise of the seminal Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine leads Ashley to claim that science fiction and the magazines grew together, “albeit slowly” and that science fiction found expression in the marriage of experimental narrative content and form (4). The fragmented form of serialized magazine publication and the myriad composition of the individual issues became an ideal place to house a genre that was still indistinct and finding its identity. Released the same year as Shelley’s The Last Man (1826), the March issue of Blackwood’s featured a short story titled “The Last Man” that was signed just “X B.” The story is very short and gives just a glimpse of a world where mankind has perished but for one solitary observer. Several aspects of the story, such as its reliance on Romantic descriptions of nature, are very reminiscent of Shelley’s novel. It may be that this short piece was intended to increase interest in apocalyptic stories to boost sales of Shelley’s novel, released in February of that year to bad reviews and soon to go out of print for well over a century. The parallel publication of these two works show a kind of writing that seems uncertain of its place, both in venue and content. In the lead up to the creation of a venue specifically for science fiction, Amazing Stories (first released in 1926), early science fiction had a close connection to magazines, with works by Robert Barr, E. M. Forster, Jack London and Wells, among many others, appearing first in magazines as disparate as the serious, educated The Oxford and Cambridge Review to the daily, ephemeral Pall Mall Gazette.\n\nWells’s The Time Machine represents an interesting case study of early science fiction stories that struggled to find a suitable place among contemporary writing. Five versions of this story precede its final publication by Heinemann, although the simultaneous London and New York editions of the book form (both published in 1895) also contain several differences. Bernard Bergonzi tracks these differences in ‘The Publication of The Time Machine 1894-5” (1960). Serialized in the Science School’s Journal (1893), National Observer (1894), and The New Review (1895), the narrative underwent several fundamental changes, reflecting the changing contexts of its publications. The content of the story itself also reflects the difficulty of this new form in establishing its place, as Wells relies for narration on various characters from scientific and professional spheres to interpret the fantastical claims of “the Time Traveler.” The depiction of a ruined London in the story, and the re-purposing of the ruins to suit the needs of the Eloi and Morlocks, adds to feeling that established ideas and conventions were being disassembled and reassembled to reflect the dawning of a new age of civilization and artistic forms. The earlier publication in the Pall Mall Gazette of Wells’s “The Man of the Year Million” (1893), which contains many similarities to The Time Machine in its content, reinforces this issue. Appearing alongside letters and articles, and professing itself to be a “Scientific Forecast” in its subtitle, the essay borrows and manipulates the codes of non-fiction writing in fashioning a new mode that is still in its formative stages. Orson Welles would go on to adapt Wells’s The War of the Worlds (1898) in 1938 using a similar process of disrupting established modes, this time structuring the story through the new media of radio with fictionalized news reports and commentary. In each case these works use the foundation of scientific research and theories to speculate about fantastical events in the future.\n\nAlso emblematic of the patchwork assembly of science fiction is its utilization of conventional or more established genres. Verne’s The Eternal Adam (1910) and H. P. Lovecraft’s “The Call of Cthulhu” (1928) both use aspects of the detective story in relaying their narratives; Wells’s “The Empire of the Ants” (1905) begins in a very similar manner to Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness” (1899), and Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Poison Belt (1913) tells an end-of-the-world narrative as part of a trilogy of adventure stories; and Poe’s “The Conversation of Eiros and Charmion” (1839), “The Colloquy of Monos and Una” (1841) and “The Masque of the Red Death” (1842), as well as Shelley’s The Last Man, all emerge from the gothic mode. Likewise, Robert Barr’s “The Doom of London” (1892), Wells’s The War of the Worlds and The War in the Air (1907), and Jack London’s “The Unparalleled Invasion” (1910) all draw heavily on the invasion-scare genre to tell tales of widespread destruction in alternate futures. Each of these works uses established modes and genres to devise new ways of thinking about the possibilities of the future, and focus principally on scenes of destruction and apocalypse to do so.\n\nEach of these primary texts sits at a crucial point in the formation of science fiction. As modernity and the fast-paced, industrialized city disrupted tradition and established conventions, literature reflected this transition in the reassembling of genres for a new fiction that focused on fantastic futures. With the advent of Greenwich Mean Time, railway schedules, industrial workdays, and new technology like the wristwatch, temporality became of crucial interest in fiction concerned with alternate presents and futures. Only the narratives enabled by Time Traveler’s time machine or the future historians of London’s and Verne’s stories, therefore, could reassemble the fragmented histories of a modernity still being understood. As novels and stories of science fiction struggled to negotiate a place for themselves, established modes had to be compromised and pieced back together in new ways, to allow a new mode of speculative writing. As a consequence of this, many of these works feature worlds that are literally fragmented, with the defamiliarized ruins of cities such as London and New York standing for the crumbling establishment, with emergent civilizations rising in their place like a phoenix from the ashes. Apocalypse, as with the genre of science fiction, allows for a literature of a remade order, reflecting the shockwaves caused by a transition to a new age of civilization."
