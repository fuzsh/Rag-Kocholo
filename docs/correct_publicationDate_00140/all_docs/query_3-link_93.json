        "text": "1. SHARE READING PROGRAM Can you say the name of a famous Detective?\n\n2. Arthur Conan Doyle’s masterpiece: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\n\n3. Let’s begin with a test. The one who makes it, sells it. The one who buys it, doesn’t use it. The one who uses it, doesn’t know he’s using it. What is it?\n\n4. PROBLEM SOLVING\n\n5. Sherlock Holmes • Sherlock Holmes is not the first fictional detective. C. Augusts Dupin, hero of a bunch of stories by American author Edgar Allan Poe, as well as a very few others detectives, came before. • Poe invented the classic formula: the super-smart private detective and his less smart (but more literary) narrator buddy.\n\n6. Sherlock Holmes • Though Holmes may not be the first detective in fiction, but we kind of think he's the best.\n\n7. Why is it the best? • It was published chapter by chapter in the magazine The Strand, in order to keep readers’ attention. • Doyle introduced a change in the old way of publishing novels in magazines (Full episodes): “The Episodic drama.” • A caracter-focused genre series. Commertial success.\n\n8. Doyle’s dream. • In spite of his success, Conan Doyle had higher aspirations: Historical Novels. • He tried to kill Sherlock Holmes at the end of the second book about the hero: The memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. • The Hound of the Baskervilles .\n\n9. Why should I care? • Sherlock is the most clever, intelligent characters ever created. • He wants to fight evil no matter how, and wants justice for everyone by using his powers. • Regardless their socio-economical status, every one in London and Europe looked for his help.\n\n10. Why should I care? • He job is more oriented to the intellectual work, than to the moral judgment. • He never fails in unveiling the hidden truth. • He is the most faithful and caring friend you can ever have in real life. • Unparalled capacity of observation, drawing conclusions, and making inferences from his surroundings. (Beyond intelligent)."
