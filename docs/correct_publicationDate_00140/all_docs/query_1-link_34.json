It points to some ancient history of ACD's Bignall Wood country estate, and to an amusing quiz question in \"The Times\" of London. There's another page from Margie Deck and Nancy Holder's \"Blue John Gap\" Project (with an essay by Tamar Zeffren), a reminder that our annual Doylean Honors ceremony at Otto Penzler's The Mysterious Bookshop â including our inaugural Wessex Cup â is just around the next bend of the calendar, on January 5, and, of course, more. Soon an electronic edition will be available for free right here.\n\nThe Return (Yet Again) of the Terror:\n\n4 New Papers and MS Page 3 from the \"Blue John Gap\" Project\n\nDecember 11, 2022 â Margie Deck and Nancy Holder have another batch of fascinating commentary on ACD's \"The Terror of Blue John Gap\" for us.

It is mostly an appreciation â partly by ACD, partly by the Society â of Sir Nigel, and slightly a reminder that sometime soon would be a good time to renew your membership.\n\nA Wessex Cup Full of Firsts\n\nAdded to Doylean Honors\n\nOctober 14, 2022 â When we gather to applaud Doylean Honors winners at Otto Penzlerâs The Mysterious Bookshop on January 5 of the 2023 BSI Weekend, we will also witness the first running of a new kind of Wessex Cup. For details, read the first issue of The Doylean Sporting Times (otherwise known as the \"New Pink 'Un\").\n\nIt's Time to Nominate Excellent\n\n\"Performing & Visual Arts\"\n\nfor Doylean Honors\n\nSeptember 9, 2022 â The nomination form for the \"Performing & Visual Arts\" category of our annual Doylean Honors is online here.

The exhibition includes ancient and modern original works by illustrators of ACD: Joseph Clement Coll (Sir Nigel, 1905-1906) and Sergio Martinez (numerous Sherlock stories, 1986-1998).

It points to some new respect for an old film based on ACD's \"The Lost World\" and an architect's vision of ACD's first mansion. There's another page from Margie Deck and Nancy Holder's \"Blue John Gap\" Project (with an essay by Peter Blau), a reminder that time is running out to register for Jubilee@221B (the conference The Bootmakers of Toronto and The Friends of the Arthur Conan Doyle Collection are hosting on September 23-25), and, of course, more. Soon an electronic edition will be available for free right here.\n\nTerrifying Update: 4 New Papers and MS Page 2 from the \"Blue John Gap\" Project\n\nAugust 7, 2022 â Margie Deck and Nancy Holder have been busy developing and editing new commentary about ACD's classic horror story, \"The Terror of Blue John Gap.\" They've launched the Page 2 portion of their project, with a facsimile (and transcription) of page 2 of ACD's autograph manuscript, accompanied by their own commentary and new essays by Peter E. Blau (\"What is Blue John?\"), Elinor Gray Howell (\"The Victorian Superfluous Woman\"), and Peter Adrian Behravesh (\"Doyle & 'The Arabian Nights'\"). In addition, there is a new paper on Page C by Roberta Pearson (\"'So the old dog returns to his vomit': 'The Terror of Blue John Gap' and Arthur Conan Doyle's Readers\"). Read and relish!\n\n\"A Common Newsletter\"\n\nIs in the Mail\n\nMay 18, 2022 â The first issue of the second year of our newsletter â featuring news about the latest ACD exhibition at the Toronto Public Library (curated by Jessie Amaolo), a page from Margie Deck and Nancy Holder's \"Blue John Gap\" Project, a tidbit about the Mirankers' \"221 Objects\" book, and more â is in the mail to members. Soon an electronic edition will be available for free right here.\n\n\"The Terror of Blue John Gap\" Project\n\nLaunched by Deck & Holder\n\nApril 18, 2022 â Late last year we announced that Margie Deck and Nancy Holder (pictured above, left and right, with a terrified Dr. James Hardcastle between them) had agreed to co-edit a new annotated edition of ACD's classic horror story, \"The Terror of Blue John Gap.\" Since then, Margie and Nancy have been developing this project in more directions, and in more interesting ways, than we could have imagined. Now they are ready to go public. You can read their introductory essay â Welcome to \"The Terror of Blue John Gap\" Project & All Our Questions â and a whole lot more at their new website. You can also get there by clicking on the \"Terror of Blue John Gap\" image at the top right-hand corner of this page. Go! Now! Look for more news (and imagery) about this project in the next issue of A Common Newsletter later this spring.

The event will take place on the Thursday (January 5) of the 2023 BSI Weekend, at 11:30 a.m. Many thanks to Otto! It is a great honor and pleasure to recognize excellence in Doylean arts, literature, scholarship, and service in such a respectable, enjoyable, and significant place, and in such fine company.\n\nDoylean Honors at\n\nThe Mysterious Bookshop\n\nFebruary 18, 2022 â On January 13, 2022, the Doylean-Sherlockian glitterati begin to gather at Otto Penzlerâs The Mysterious Bookshop for the ACD Societyâs inaugural Doylean Honors awards ceremony. Above, left to right: Otto Penzler, Derrick Belanger, Mike McSwiggin, Les Klinger, Bev Wolov, Tom Horrocks, Brian Belanger, Peter Blau, Ray Betzner, Ross Davies, Don Hobbs, Joe Eckrich, Steve Mason, Jerry Kegley, and Mark Jones.

We hope they find suitable locations for proud display. And this seems like an appropriate moment to share the thoughtful acceptance we received from honoree Douglas Kerr.\n\nWatch the Doylean Honors Ceremony\n\non Doings of Doyle\n\nJanuary 18, 2022 â The Doings of Doyle YouTube channel features a complete recording of our inaugural Doylean Honors ceremony, including announcements of the honorees: Gretchen Altabef, Stephen Carver, Stephen Gallagher, Daniel Henocq, Douglas Kerr, Bonnie MacBird, Peggy Perdue, Christopher Roden, Shawna Ross, and Barbara Rusch. The formal proceedings begin about four minutes into the recording. Watch all the way to the end to catch Monica Schmidt's pitch (at about 21:07) for The ACD Society's cricket squad! The recording also offers a few nice glimpses of Otto Penzler's The Mysterious Bookshop, which hosted the event.\n\nArthur Conan Doily\n\nJanuary 17, 2022 â Peggy Perdue has created yet another artistic interpretation of Arthur Conan Doyle. This one, titled \"Arthur Conan Doily,\" was introduced to the world in a limited-edition pamphlet distributed to Doyleans who attended the inaugural Doylean Honors ceremony at The Mysterious Bookshop in New York City on January 13. The ACD Society promised (in appropriately fine print appropriately situated at the bottom of the back page of the pamphlet): \"An e-version will soon be available on the Society's website at www.acdsociety.com.\" And here it is! The images above illustrate three important stages in the creation of the Arthur Conan Doily: (1) creation of a grid to guide eye and needle, (2) creation of the Doily itself, and (3) inspection of the Doily.\n\nThe Envelope, Please . . .\n\nJanuary 13, 2022 â It is with pleasure, pride, and great respect that we announce our inaugural Doylean Honorees.\n\nFor Lifetime Service:\n\nâ¢ Christopher Roden\n\nFor excellence in the \"Fiction and Poetry\" category:\n\nâ¢ Gretchen Altabef for the short story in Sir Arthur and the Time Machine Sherlock Holmes: Further Adventures in the Realms of H.G.

See you at the Bookshop or online for the inaugural Doylean Honors!\n\nAn Early Welcome to 2022\n\nDecember 29, 2021 â Society membership cards for 2022 are in the mail and en route to folks whose memberships extend into 2022. We hope you are terrified, and perhaps mystified, by the image on the other side. Happy new year!\n\n\"A Common Newsletter\"\n\nIs at the Printer, and Here Now\n\nDecember 17, 2021 â The third issue of our newsletter (and the last for 2021) is at the printer now. We will mail it to members as soon as we have it in hand, but, alas, it might not reach them until early 2022. So, to ensure that the last of the 2021 newsletters really is available in December 2021 (even if the ink-on-paper version isnât until January 2022), weâre posting an electronic edition now. Voila!\n\nWe Have a Logo, and a Moustache\n\nNovember 28, 2021 â We are pleased to report that the ACD Society now has a logo. We announced a logo contest back in January, with a deadline of June. Why did it take so long to announce a winner? Partly because we received numerous excellent entries, and partly because we just aren't very efficient.\n\nSo, we begin by thanking the creative and generous Doyleans who sent us their logos.\n\nSecond, we thank and congratulate Brian Belanger (of Belanger Books fame, pictured below between two of his book covers) for creating the Society's logo. You can admire the logo's mustachioed elegance in the banner at the top of this webpage, where it appears in the middle of an array of ACD's works. Soon you will also find it in \"A Common Newsletter,\" on the Doylean Honors certificates we will be presenting on January 13, in our tweets, and elsewhere.\n\n\"A Common Newsletter\"\n\nIs in the Mail\n\nOctober 16, 2021 â The second issue of our newsletter is in the mail to members. Soon an electronic edition will be available for free right here. While you are waiting, would you care to speculate about the title ACD would have given to the \"untold tale\" of the \"two forces of the future\" that Mark Jones describes here? If you would, please feel free to share your ideas with us via Twitter, ACD's social medium of choice.\n\nYouâre Invited!\n\nOctober 7, 2021 â The inaugural \"Doylean Honors\" ceremony will be held on January 13, 2022, at 11:15 a.m., at Otto Penzler's The Mysterious Bookshop, 58 Warren Street, in NYC. We will be presenting Doylean Honors in the categories of \"Fiction and Poetry,\" \"Performing and Visual Arts,\" \"Scholarly Writing,\" and \"Lifetime Service.\" We will post more details here as they become available. We hope to see you there!\n\nThere is still time to nominate your favorite recent Doylean works for Doylean Honors, but please hurry â the deadline is November 1.\n\n\"Performing and Visual Arts\" category: The nomination form is here.\n\n\"Scholarly Writing\" category: The nomination form is here.\n\n\"Fiction and Poetry\" category: The nomination form is here (English version), here (Japanese version), and here (German version).\n\nIn addition, in another piece of big news, the amazing \"Fiction and Poetry\" committee has produced yet another version of its nomination form. We are pleased and proud to present the Czech version (it is here), which was created by Ales Kolodrubec. Ales has been an Executive Founder of the Czech Society of Sherlock Holmes since its founding in 2000, and is President of the Society. He worked as a librarian at the Charles University and as a translator from English for a Prague-based publishing house. He has retired and is now living the life of a hermit among his bees and his books in a small farm in the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands. Here is Ales in his current elevated apian environment:\n\n\"Fiction and Poetry\" ... Translated!\n\nJuly 30, 2021 â We have some impressive news from our Doylean Honors \"Fiction and Poetry\" committee: Mitch (Masamichi) Higurashi has translated the committeeâs nomination form into Japanese (it is available here), and Philipp Haack has translated the form into German (it is available here).\n\nAnd now a few words about Mitch and Philipp. Mitchâs first job in the Japanese publishing world was as a literary agent! For the past 40 years, he has been working as a translator, which has included publishing many works in the Holmesian canon and also ACD-related books such as \"ACD: A Life in Letters.\" Mitch is a member of the BSI, the SHSL, and the Japan Sherlock Holmes Club. Philipp is a proud member of the Deutsche Sherlock Holmes Gesellschaft (German Sherlock Holmes Society) and the creator of www.sherlockianer.de (a German Sherlock Holmes blog with articles, reviews, and insights from his collection).

Committee chair Monica Schmidt has divided her category into three sub-categories and assembled an impressive group of committee members for each:\n\nâ¢ Professional/Fan Visual Art: Amanda Downs Chaplin, Frank Cho, Steve Doyle.\n\nâ¢ Theatre/Live performance/YouTube (unpolished): David Harnois, Jeffrey Hatcher, Mike McSwiggin.\n\nâ¢ Film/Television/YouTube (fully produced): Curtis Armstrong, Ashley Polasek, Monica Schmidt.\n\nNominating your favorite recent Doylean work (it must have debuted in 2020 or 2021) is easy: just download the nomination form (here), complete it, and email it to Monica.\n\nAnd here is a reminder of what Doylean Honorees receive:\n\nâ¢ An invitation to an event in their honor to be held at The Mysterious Bookshop in NYC during the week of January 10, 2022 (exact date TBD).\n\nâ¢ A $250 Bookshop credit and a lovely certificate.\n\nâ¢ A justifiable sense of pleasure and pride for impressing Doyleans of good taste and high integrity.\n\nPlease do act when you witness Doylean excellence, because the deadline for nominations is November 1, 2021!\n\nPick a Number,\n\nAlmost Any Number\n\nFebruary 18, 2021 â We will start mailing membership cards next week. If you are a member and you would prefer a particular member number, please tell us via email, with your name and preferred number in the subject line. Because we believe membership in the ACDS should reflect community and collegiality, we are not limiting the number of members who can have a particular member number.\n\nSo, if it turns out that we have a lot of members who are attached to a number associated with Le Guinâs best book or Bozemanâs best film or Swiftâs best song or Enoâs best band (or, yes, your favorite staircase or year or street address) or something else special, thatâs fine. Everyone can have their number (in other words, more than one person can have the same number). The only constraint is that your number must fit on the little line just to the right of the word ânumberâ on the bottom of the back of the card (pictured above), which does, alas, disqualify sentimental favorites by the likes of Avogadro, Curie, Gopala, and Knuth.\n\nThere is no deadline for this, but be warned: If we have not heard from you by the time we mail your card, we will choose one (or maybe some other number) for you, and then you will be stuck with that number, at least for this year. (If youâre wondering whatâs on the other side of the card, youâll just have to wait until someone receives theirs and posts a picture somewhere.)\n\nWelcome to a Thrillingly\n\nBoring Beginning\n\nOur website is dull because adding a spark to something like this is part of the fun of being in on the founding of an organization. We want to share that fun with as many Doyleans as we can. (Besides, this site does not need to do much, because a magnificent Doylean website â a veritable online encyclopedia of ACD â already exists: Alexis Barquin's Arthur Conan Doyle Encyclopedia.)\n\nThat is why we have put together what we hope is the simple, sturdy skeleton of a website that can be improved by, for example, a contest to develop a logo for the ACD Society. Hmmm . . . yes. That is where we will start with our glamorizing. The logo contest rules are . . . here.\n\nThe same outlook applies to the ACD Society itself. We would like to think we have a simple, sturdy skeleton of program and organization â outlined below (and inspired by Cliff Goldfarb's 2019 letter) â that will foster and celebrate much good Doylean work.\n\nThe Program\n\nDoylean Honors: Awards for Doylean excellence in four categories: fiction and poetry, performing and visual arts, scholarly writing, and service. They will be presented in January 2022 at Otto Penzler's The Mysterious Bookshop in New York City, and annually thereafter. Each honoree will receive a $250 Bookshop credit and a certificate featuring (you guessed it) a doily selected by lace expert Bev Wolov.\n\nConferences: Triennial events to be held at locations that have Doylean significance, with online accessibility for those who cannot attend in person. The first will be in 2023, with a \"One Crowded Hour\" theme â in collaboration with Ashley D. Polasek's Conan Doyle Review and Mark Jones and Paul M. Chapman's Doings of Doyle. Watch for a call for papers later this year.\n\nCricket team: It does not yet have a name or a home field, but it does have a mission â to challenge, and perhaps someday even overcome, Sherlockians and Wodehousians and other amicable athletes. We hope to play our first match during the 2023 Doylean conference.\n\nNewsletter: A trimesterly periodical highlighting Doylean accomplishments and events. An electronic edition will be available for free right here. A print edition will be mailed to members.\n\nWebsite: This site is boring but (we hope) useful now, and it will (we are sure) gradually become increasingly useful and lovely and lively.\n\nThat is enough for starters.\n\nThe Organization\n\nDoylean Honors: We will have committees to select honorees in each of the three substantive Doylean Honor categories. The chair of each committee is responsible for organizing their committee, adopting a process for selecting honorees in their category (up to three honorees per year), and then doing the selecting. Jayantika Ganguly is chair of the \"Fiction and Poetry\" committee, Monica Schmidt is chair of the \"Performing and Visual Arts\" committee, and Anastasia Klimchynskaya is chair of the \"Scholarly Writing\" committee. Each chair is organizing their committee now. We expect to have nomination forms for all three categories up here by May 1.\n\nAdvisors: Cliff Goldfarb is the chairman of our board of advisors, which he is in the process of organizing. In addition to giving us advice, each year the board will select an individual to receive the Doylean Honor for service.\n\nConferences: More about them later. If you want to bother someone about them now, even though there is not yet much to say, you might try Carlina de la Cova or Ira Brad Matetsky.\n\nCricket team: Our temporarily nameless and homeless team will be captained by Andrew Heger, advised by honorary captain Stuart Law. If you are a Doylean who wants to play, please sharpen your cricket skills (or acquire some!), because Andy will eventually be holding tryouts, one way or another.\n\nNewsletter: It has an editor. Greg D. Ruby is thinking about suitable periodical names.\n\nThe work of chairs and editors and captains is being coordinated by Ross Davies, who also runs occasional meetings and errands.\n\nQuestions? Comments? Ideas?\n\nPlease email us at acdsocy@gmail.com.\n\nOh, you already have questions? You want to know who can join the society, what it costs, and what you get for your money?\n\nOK.\n\nEveryone is welcome to join, so please do.\n\nMembership costs $10 per calendar year. The money will help to cover some but not all of the costs of the society. (Remember, an e-version of the newsletter will be available for free here, so don't pay to join if your only reason for doing so would be to read it. Then again, print versions might turn out to be nifty keepsakes. You never know.)\n\nWhen you pay, you will provide your name, email address, and mailing address. The name and addresses will help us communicate with you, including sending you the goods: an annual membership card and three printed issues of the newsletter per year. And perhaps other things, if it turns out that we can afford them.\n\nYou can do the paying and address-providing via PayPal . . .\n\nDo you want one, two, or three years?\n\n. . . or by downloading this form and following the instructions you find on it.\n\nBy the way, if you want to support the ACD Society more generously, please feel free to send a larger Paypal or check to the Green Bag (the organization that is collecting our dues and paying our bills now and will for the foreseeable future be covering the difference between dues coming in and expenses going out). It is a 501(c)(3) and will gladly send a receipt.\n\nThank you for reading!"
