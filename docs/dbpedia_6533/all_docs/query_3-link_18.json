        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nThe morning was cold and silent, there were no traces of sun in the sky covered in its ash-white blanket. The fog fell like a thick layer of smoke, seeping between the branches of the tallest pines and covering them about three-quarters of their totality. A soft fresh smell of the coming rain enveloped the air as well as the dense cloud near the surface. It was about ten fifteen minutes in the day, but the dark sky announced that it was getting dark.\n\nThere was not much to do, so they repeatedly appealed to the tasks that were destined for the betas who took care of the castle to vary between their own activities. Kings never intervened in their children's decisions as long as they were kept safe and within the boundaries of the castle, where no one could see that they were substituting for the servant caste from time to time.\n\nRight now, the two princes of Deutsh-Azelette were in the royal family's berry orchard, picking each of them with their own hands and depositing them in light wooden buckets.\n\n—Sometimes we usually ride horses or take our classical dance classes. His mother says that we should practice as soon as possible so as not to spoil the summer dance. — A gust of wind prompted the omega to adjust his fluffy polar gray aviator hat, made mostly of soft and warm materials. In addition, he tightened the leafy coat of the same color that covered his entire anatomy tighter to his thin body, brushing the terracotta earth under his feet. —He makes me laugh, he is someone very charismatic and has even taken the trouble to hire a beta so that I can take knitting and embroidery classes alongside me. I will say that his stitches are not the best, he is still a little clumsy, but I think it is already quite captivating that he gives himself the opportunity to spend his time on omega activities.\n\nA twinge in his throat managed to spread through the central part of his body, reaching through his veins to his heart and sending dozens of electric shocks to it incessantly. It was a description of the pain that occasionally ran through his body. Every word spoken by Sunoo tested Sunghoon's patience and sanity.\n\nThe Crown Prince of Deutsh-Azelette learned with severe lessons to keep his emotions at a very low limit, his alpha nature mostly helped him not to hinder himself in that task, but the puppy that lived in him that had been treated as a delicate omega forced him to have that sensitive side.\n\nIn each situation, the superficial layer of their decision-making was their inner alpha, however, it was that tender part that maintained some goodness that was not recognized in resolutions given by the older caste. For that reason he couldn't help but feel on edge at times like now, where he just wanted to slip into protective arms that could soothe the agony of his heart whenever he was told that he could never be Heeseung's.\n\n—Your nature is stronger than you think, Sunoo. It doesn't matter if your rational side isn't ready, your omega side will know perfectly how to care for a puppy. — The alpha gave the omega an encouraging smile with a hint of melancholy in it, which, if it was disguised enough, Sunoo wouldn't notice. —Heeseung won't force you to have puppies in the first heat you have together, either.\n\nThose were words that he had heard directly from the mouth of the alpha with red aroma, only that, unlike the current situation, that phrase was dedicated to his own person. Heeseung would never have forced him to have a puppy, both stated that the future prince would be the product of the security, trust and above all the love that arose in the hearts of both.\n\n—We haven't talked about it yet, I guess we've both unwittingly decided we'll wait for the right time. — Sunoo stuffed a juicy berry into his mouth, splattering his lips with a red color. The hand that wasn't holding the bucket momentarily caressed her belly over her coat. It was a quick move, but the alpha managed to catch it.\n\nSunghoon was fearful for his future in the coming months. A few years ago he saw the idea of letting Heeseung go too far away, however, now it was only a matter of months for the inevitable to happen and he did not know how to react to it. Sunoo would be a Wiltz and Jungwon a Deutsh-Azelette, Sunoo would take Heeseung's cubs and Jungwon would carry his and there was no way to stop that. His fate was irreparable.\n\n—How is Jungwon? Since New Year's dinner I haven't had a letter of reply. — The voice sounded next to him and Sunghoon abruptly jumped at the sound after having remained silent, he immediately resumed his actions of collection, sending the whirlwind of thoughts to the depths of his being.\n\n—Jungwon is fine. He has been busy with paperwork for the omega camp abroad. It will be in mid-April, so he hardly has time for himself. — Sunghoon shrugged casually, taking a new bucket to continue picking up the tiny fruits. —I'll tell him today to take a break to answer you, or at best so that he can visit you.\n\n—Okay, anyway, it's only a couple of weeks until the ball for his seventeenth birthday. — Sunghoon pursed his lips in a straight line at the mention of his future omega's age. Jungwon was too young to have to deal with upcoming arranged marriages, although there wouldn't even have to be one for him since his family wasn't established under those agreements.\n\nThe pretty plump-cheeked omega, despite his concerns, was excited about becoming a real omega; to have a family, to serve their alpha and to help them in the decision-making of the kingdom. The same ideal of Sunghoon was transmitted to Sunoo by all the talks they had between them, in addition, the magical women of the forest also announced the caste of the minor as soon as he was born saying that he was an omega. It was to be expected that both princes would share their thoughts and end up having similar desires.\n\nAfter Sunghoon introduced himself as an alpha, Sunoo was handed over to Heeseung as his new omega. The younger did not reproach because he knew that this would be his fate, he did not care that the Prince of Wiltz had been his brother's alpha since the beginning of his life, although his thoughts could be classified as selfish and inconsiderate, in reality they could not be blamed. Sunghoon was so good with his act of hiding his true feelings that Sunoo really believed that his brother couldn't feel anything for Heeseung now that he had become alpha.\n\nHe didn't know for sure what was going through Sunghoon's mind at that moment because the older one decided to lock himself in his capsule, so he had no choice but to draw his own conclusions: if Sunghoon had become alpha, then the love he had developed for Heeseung must have gone with his inner cub and, consequently, Heeseung stopped loving him because two alphas couldn't be together.\n\n—It's nothing. These are silly concerns. — Sunghoon carefully combed the strands of black hair that fell over the opposite forehead, allowing him to appreciate his entire face. Sunoo's clear eyes were shining brightly, although the sky didn't have any celestial bodies to make them dazzle like that, the small lights in them were authentic; small hazelnut freckles spread across his cheeks like stardust; his lips were as beautiful as the berries they had just picked. Sunoo was beautiful, both on the outside and inside.\n\n—What are you worried about, Hoonie? — The soft notes of banana and coconut stung the Alfa's nostrils in a warm way. Sunoo used to release pheromones to help calm him down when he used to think too much, perpetually weakening him to the point of helping him sleep.\n\n—After you get engaged, we'll stop seeing each other for a while. I don't want that. — Sunoo extended his smile even more because of the cuteness caused by the alpha's concern. The omega left the bucket next to the other on the ground and now with both hands free wrapped them around the eldest's waist, burying his head in his chest.\n\n—And Jungwon will do the same for you. — Sunghoon tensed up a little at the radical change of person to whom his words were directed. It was reasonable for Sunoo to speak well of Jungwon, he did the same with Heeseung. As siblings, they would always want each other's well-being. —He is a good omega and will do his best to always please you. Take good care of it.\n\n—I will, I promise. — As if their conversation was destined to end that way, the echoing sound of galloping in the distance began to approach, echoing against their ears. Sunghoon could see above the omega's head as a brown horse approached them, being ridden by one of the betas who was guarding them. When the horse stopped near their radar, the words of the beta were unnecessary to know what he had to say: they must leave.\n\nA chaste kiss was placed on Sunoo's hat, and they naturally separated. They picked up the four buckets full of fresh berries and strapped them to the saddle of their respective horses before mounting them, beginning to ride on a leisurely march back to the castle.\n\n.\n\nSunghoon sighed, dropping his body abruptly against the velvety back of the carriage seat where he was transported. His head lightly tapped the wooden wall behind him as the tiredness in his body was more present than before, however, his eyes remained open, watching as the windowpane on the door next to him was filled with tiny drops of water, obstructing the view towards the outer grasslands covered with a thin layer of mist.\n\nSunghoon said that miles and miles of grassland had already passed and he was still puzzled as to how he still couldn't memorize the path he had been constantly traveling for a long time, but he couldn't blame himself after spending the two hours of travel immersed in the gaps of his mind.\n\nEventually the extensive grasslands turned into leafy trees, mostly dry green from the winter, covering like a kind of arch the entrance to the great Kingdom of Feulen. The carriage moved through the cobblestone and traditional-looking streets, stealing a few glances from the people who wandered around with umbrellas on their heads. The climate was not much different from that of the Kingdom of Deutsh-Azelette, the only difference being that the rain was heavier in the present-day region. It wasn't long before they came back to an area full of trees that led to the entrance of the castle, revealing in the distance the white and brown structure of the castle.\n\nSunghoon walked over to the younger boy on the other side of the fence, wearing a beautiful ecru dress under an oversized fluffy white coat. His body was protected from the gentle drizzle by a white umbrella. As soon as the black metal bars ceased to exist between them, Sunghoon took Jungwon's outstretched hand and left a soft kiss on it to show his loyalty and a chaste kiss on his lips to show him love.\n\nWhen they entered the castle their coats were removed and hung on the coat rack by the main door and then they were guided to the main hall to enjoy tea time, which thanks to the weather conditions, could not be taken in the beautiful rose fields of the royal family.\n\nUpon entering, Sunghoon noticed how two two-seat sofas had been moved near the fireplace and in front of them was a coffee table with the steaming tea set, the curtains were gathered to the sides with thick ropes, being the gray light from outside the only one that illuminated the room because the lamps were off and the thick clouds did not allow the sun's rays to pass through.\n\n—My father wanted it to be something more romantic today because of the temperature outside... — explained the omega once the doors were closed behind them, leaving them completely alone. Jungwon seemed to think for a bit before speaking again with a hesitation. —You know how he is.\n\nJungwon's companion betas were not allowed to take care of him when he was in the company of his future alpha according to the rules of the Kings of Feulen. Labeled as high-risk conduct by other people, however, they were forbidden from any obscene activity prior to marriage, so they need not worry as the Princes took any rules imposed seriously.\n\nUsually it was like that, moments absolved of gossip and simply enjoying each other's company. Sunghoon closed his eyes, feeling himself with the warmth of the room and feeling at peace with the omega by his side, however, his serenity did not last long as he heard with his sensitive ears the shivering of teeth. When he spread his eyelids and looked beside him, he saw the Prince de Feulen with his arms wrapping around himself, as if the warmth of the fireplace wasn't enough to appease his cold. His alpha instinct led him to take off his jacket.\n\nThe younger one who had his eyes focused on the burning wood was startled when he heard that voice, but he was not frightened, instead, he showed his flashing smile and got up from his seat to sit next to the alpha, who covered the exposed skin of his shoulders with his garment. Sunghoon's arm was on Jungwon's shoulders and pulled him towards him, placing them in a position where they were snuggling up to each other.\n\nHis inner alpha felt steamy with the omega so close to him. It was natural that he would not reject his presence, and by now they were so comfortable that he hardly noticed that it existed within him.\n\n—I don't want to be inadequate with my question, but... — the omega's voice was low, as if he was going to be heard by someone else who did not exist in the room. —Do you know if the Prince of Capellmert is all right?\n\n—Jaeyun misses you, I can assure you of that, but I don't think he's well since the news of the arranged marriage. — Sunghoon remembered the words Heeseung had said a while ago. He then took Jungwon's hand in his and intertwined his fingers, stroking the back of it with his thumb. —You can see it at your ball, Won.\n\nMiraculously, they were both left almost alone on one of the paths in the rose field except for Jungwon's lady-in-waiting who followed them a few meters behind them, giving them enough privacy. The Prince de Feulen walked with his head bowed, his fingers braiding the greenish organza fabric between them.\n\n—Prince Jungwon, is there anything worrying that is on your mind now? — Sunghoon asked, tilting his head slightly and trying to make his voice feel nothing but sincerity. Jungwon opened his lips, looked back, and then closed them again.\n\n—You'll become my alpha no matter what... — the omega whispered, raising his head to look directly into the older's dark eyes —and my intuition says that it does not agree with that. I'm not either.\n\n—The only thing I want to ask you is patience. — Jungwon stopped abruptly, taking Sunghoon's hand in his. His voice cut off every few words, but there were no tears in his eyes. —I can't fall in love with you immediately because my heart belongs to someone else. I don't ask you to let me see it, I just want you to give me time to heal my broken heart and I swear I will love you, Prince Sunghoon.\n\nSunghoon accepted it. He accepted Jungwon even when his heart was beating for someone else, because he knew it was a situation he was no stranger to. It only took a look at the minor to know that this would be the new secret they would keep between them for the rest of their lives. In his mind and heart he also vowed to surpass Heeseung to fall in love with Jungwon properly. He feared that with the passage of time his promise had been fulfilled or that it was simply a wish that had drowned in the lake of his heart.\n\nThe omega's anxiety seemed to dissipate as his footsteps moved along the earthy roads. His scent returned to normal, although his movements still hummed in nervousness and recklessness, his mind seemed calm. A part of Sunghoon wanted to completely ignore things, but most of him wanted to know who owned Jungwon's heart, however, his trust was unstructured and Jungwon still had the possibility of betrayal by the alpha, even if he had told him that it would not be that way.\n\nThe first few times he passed by Jungwon's side were strange. None of them were used to talking to a different person than the one they had planned to spend the rest of their days and it was for that very reason that they started with a friendship. While Jungwon didn't know what was going on between the Princes of Wiltz and Deutsh-Azelette, he knew that something was holding Sunghoon back from accepting the arranged marriage with him in full.\n\nBut neither of them was worthy of an uncertain future full of confusion, they should not spend their next years of life wondering how things would be different if everything had gone in their favor. They didn't deserve any of that.\n\nSo their meetings began to be more intimate, deeper. Prince Sunghoon at some point confided to Jungwon the deepest of his pains; have become alpha. He confided in him his concerns and some of the desires he had in his childhood as an omega. It was unreasonable for him alone to share his misfortune, and instead of judging him, the omega shared his own experiences.\n\nThe Prince de Feulen was dreadful as it was his first ball, however, a warm scent of truffle, spices and orange came to his nose like the gentle touch of a distant flame on a winter's day. When his green eyes connected with the chestnut trees of an alpha, he knew immediately. The pressure that lay on his back from being the most recently introduced omega was no longer his present situation.\n\nEverything turned around the attractive alpha who twirled their bodies all over the dance floor of the great hall, the alpha from whom he did not part all night even when his feet hurt immensely, but he refused to rest or let another omega dance with the other. When they were able to sit for a moment on one of the benches in the main garden, they made their identities known and held hands on that cool night.\n\nPrince Jaeyun was not a crown prince, he was actually the last cub of a litter of three, he was only sixteen years old at the time and lived on the other side of the great lake of the Haute-Sûre in Diekirch. A monumental distance from his own kingdom.\n\nSoon misfortune for the Prince of Feulen would come in the form of a king and queen of the Kingdom of Deutsh-Azelette. He didn't know it when he first saw them, however, when his parents required his presence he knew something wasn't right. From a young age he had a slight gift of intuition, Sunghoon noticed it when they first met, but at that time the omega used it to persuade that the reason behind the kings' visit had to do with Jaeyun.\n\nJust like Sunghoon once, Jungwon's world fell apart when his parents announced that he would no longer be able to see the Prince of Capellmert after three years because he had a new engagement to the Prince of Deutsh-Azelette. The announcement was so abrupt that he did not have time to say goodbye to his alpha and the letters he received were burned at the stake.\n\nSunghoon pitied him. He understood every drop of the omega's feelings, but unlike his inevitable ruin, the alpha prince could do something to calm the hell Jungwon was going through. He waited a couple of months before a ball was held that most kingdoms attended and communicated with a person so that everything was prepared for that night.\n\nWhen the dance in Vianden took place Sunghoon took Jungwon and they passed the beginning of it as any couple would usually do, but as fast as the clock struck nine, the alpha took his omega's hand and led him to the free fields behind the castle. Jungwon gave him that look with hopeful eyes before even the Prince of Capellmert could appear on the periphery.\n\nThe balls were a place for Jungwon and Jaeyun to express their romance, all thanks to Sunghoon's kind heart. He knew that the omega hadn't asked him to have encounters with his former alpha from the beginning, but Sunghoon couldn't let someone so young go through that pain.\n\n—It's not something you have to pay for, omega. I never asked you for anything in return. — The Crown Prince smiled briefly when he saw how part of the fabric of the minor's dress covered part of his legs.\n\n—Kiss me, alpha. — Sunghoon did not look at him confused or surprised at his singular request. He took the omega's chin with his fingers and raised it, there being a slight tingling sensation at the tip of these and finally pressed his lips with the opposites.\n\nA form of momentary consolation, something that could cover what the following years had in store for them. Their minds dancing in falsehood as they imagined that other lips were on his."
