Zadorozhnyy g- rut _nrre micctom OF THE SOVIET SOLDIR xawil Forty-two years have passed since the workers and peasants of our country, led by the Communist Party, have accomplished the Great October Socialist Revolution, created their own armed organization - the Soviet Army. While de- fining its historic purpose, Vladimir Il'ich Lenin said that it was called upon to guard, from all and every kind of enemies, the achievements of the proletarian revolution, the government of the people, its peaceful creative labor directed to- ward the construction of a Communist society. \"The socialist army\", emphasized Lenin, \"upholds it cause, its land, its rule in the factory, and defends the govern- ment of the workers\". Flesh and blood of its people, the Soviet Army is rightfully called the army of a new type. For the first time in the history of human society an army began serv- ing, not the aims of aggression, suppression, and enslavement, but the vital in- terests of the workers and the defense of their Fatherland which is the stronghold of the peace and security of peoples. These noble and just aims, these indissoluble ties and unity with the people determine the boundless power and potentialities of our Army. Its tried organizer, leader and indoctrinator is the wise Communist Party, and herein lies the main source of might of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union. The whole history of the Soviet State confirms the fact that the only purpose of its army is the defense of the country against military aggression by the imperialist powers and the protection of the socialist achievements and peaceful labor of its people. This follows from the very essence of the Soviet Government. The state of the workers and peasants came into being under the banner of ideas of peace and friendship among peoples. The decree on peace signed by the hand of the leader of the Revolution was the first legislative act of the Soviet Government. The Leninist principles of peaceful coexistence in relations with other states, regardless of their social and economic systems, underlay and underlie the external policy of the Communist Party and the Soviet State. By serving whole-heartedly the Socialist Motherland and the cause of the Com- munist Party, the Armed Forces of the USSR have gained the universal love of the people. The unparalleled selfless struggle of the young Soviet Army and its out- standing victories over the united forces of external and internal Counter:tre,volution in civil war will never be forgotten. The per son.nel of the Army., Air Force, and the Navy worthily and honorably fulfilled their historic mission in the subsequent period as well, in the years of Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2014/05/02: CIA-RDP81-01043R004800160001-7 , , Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2014/05/02: CIA-RDP81-01043R004800160001-7 MIL 2 Editorial 4?111.101111111: peaceful construction. In those years the Soviet Union was the only socialist state in the capitalist encirclement. More than once our glorious Army had to rebuff re- solutely the provocative attacks of enemies, while guarding the inviolability of the borders?of the USSR. Immortal through the ages is the titanic feat of the Soviet Armed Forces in the Great Patriotic War. The memory of our people and of all progressive humanity will forever retain the crystal-clear image of the Soviet soldier as a fighter and as a man filled with a sense of lofty humanism and who gave all that he could to rid the earth of the Fascist plague, of Hitlerite enslavement. Covered with the glory of heroic victories, the Soviet Armed Forces are celeb- rating their 42nd Anniver sa.ry. As ever they vigilantly and indefatigably continue to stand their honor guard, while guarding what is most sacred ? peace and happiness, the creative labor of the peoples. The traditional celebration of Soviet Army and Navy Day takes place this year as our Motherland is flourishing mightily. Eloquently be this are the results of the development of the national economy during the past year. According to the report of the Central Statistics Department of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, the volume of industrial out- put has grown more than 11 percent in comparison with 1958. In excess of the an- nual quota, industrial production has amounted to almost 50 billion rubles. Great successes have been obtained by the toilers of our agriculture. Soviet scientific and technical thought achieved new outstanding victories. Re- cently, as appears from the reports of TASS, a successful test was conducted for a more powerful multistage ballistic rocket, designed for launching heavy earth satellites and the realization of cosmic flights to the planets of the solar system. The whole world admires the precision of calculations: the rocket traveled a dis- tance of 12.5 thousand kilometers, and the deviation of the point of fall of the rocket from the computed one was less than two kilometers. All of this vididly attests to the steady growth of socialist economy and the flourishing of science. In the year of 1960 just begun, the Soviet Union will take a new great stride along the path. towards its objective. During the current year the gross production of industry must increase by 8. 1 percent. It is certain that the planned quota will be overfulfilled. Steel smelting will reach almost 65 million tons. The production volume of light industry will increase by about 9 billion rubles. Inspired by the decisions of the December Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU which outlined specific measures for further development in agriculture, the toilers of rural areas strive to sel that the gross collection of grain during the second year of the seven year planeriaches 9. 3 billion poods. The production of meat is approaching 10. 6 million 'isms (itati-g-hte-reweight). It is planned to obtain 72 million tons of milk, or 336 kilograms per ca ita of population, as against the 330 kilograms obtained by the USA in 1958. The rapid rates of economic development of the USSR will ensure the fulfillment of the seven year plan ahead of time. The course of historic development clearly shows that in peaceful economic competition between two systems, the more pro- gressive and viable socialist regime- will win the victory. Reecently the fourth session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR passed an act of the greatest historic significance. Having discussed the report by Comrade, N. S. Editorial aummarir- 11111111010MINIM1111.116 Khrushchev \"Disarmament - a Road to Securing Peace and Ensuring Friendship Among Nations\", the Supreme Council of the Union of the SSR unanimously passed a law providing for a considerable reduction of the Armed Forces of the USSR. The strength of the Armed Forces is being further reduced by another 1 million 200 thousand men, and after this 9nr Army and Navy Will number in strength 2 million 243 thousand men. The Communist Party of the USSR, undeviatingly carrying out the Leninist pol- icy of peace, persistently and consistently fights for a relaxation in international relations and for ridding the nations of the threat of new war. The conclusion was reached at the XX and the XXI Congresses that there is no more fatal inevitability of wars under the present situation, and that it is possible and necessary to elimi- nate war forever from the life of human society. A clear road to this objective is universal and total inspected disarmament, the program of which was introduced for consideration in the United Nations Organization on 18 September 1959 by the head of the Soviet Government, Comrade N. So Khrushchev. during his historic visit to the USA. Now on the eve of the critical international conferences at which this program will be considered, the Soviet Union has made-a decision for a further reduction in its Armed Forces. It does this on its own initiative, as a unilateral action, without waiting until its partners in negotiations finally put an end to endless de- bates on disarmament. \"We accept a reduction in our Armed Forces because\", said N. S. Khrush- chev at a session of the Supreme Soviet, \"we do not want war, because we do not intend attacking anyone, do not wish to threaten anyone and have no predatory aims.\" The very fact that the Soviet country is now going through a period of unprece- dented rapid development in itS national economy constitutes the basis for our firm conviction of the correctness of the step taken, the new considerable reduction in the Armed Forces of the USSR as a unilateral action. This conviction is based on the indestructible moral and political unity of the Soviet society., The development of our economy, the achievements of scientific and technical thought - this is what created the con.ditions favorable to the reduction in the Armed Forces. Passing a law of the greatest historic significance, the Supreme Council of the USSR also took into consideration the fact that the mighty socialist camp, steadily strengthen- ing and growing, now is a strong bastion of peace. Progressive people throughout the world justly evaluate the new outstanding contribution of the Soviet Union in strengthening the cause of peace, its new peace- loving initiative. No subterfuges of false imperialist propaganda are able to diminish the great international significance of the law passed by the Supreme Soviet for a further considerable reduction in the Armed Forces of the USSR and the appeal to the parliaments and governments of all the states of the world to respond to the call for the new peace movement of the Soviet Union to undertake, for their part, practical measures directed toward a reduction in existing armed forces. As for those who did not profit by the convincing lessons of history and who continue nurturing aggressive plans with regard to the USSR and the states of the socialist camp, they have all received a frankaand clear warning: the numerical reduction of the Soviet Armed Forces not only will not diminish their fire power, Declassified in Part- Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @50-Yr 2014/05/02: CIA-RDP81-01043R004800160001-7 111111111111111 4 Editorial A Declassified in Part -Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2014/05/02 : CIA-RDP81-01043R004800160001-7 VMMORMIMML 1111111?11111111111MINIKIIIMMIIMPRIMIN but on the contrary, this power will increase qualitatively many times. Due to the successes of Soviet scientists, engineers and workers engaged in the defense industry, our Army has at its disposal the newest and the most modern types of armament - rockets and nuclear weapons. These weapons are being per- fected and will farther be perfected until they are banned. The Soviet Army is armed with a sufficient quantity of ballistic rockets of var- ious types, including operational-tactical ones with an effective range of from tens of to several hundred kilometers, as well as strategic rockets, including the inter- continental missiles with a practically unlimited range. Thus rocket troops under present-day conditions have become a major branch of the Armed Forces of the USSR. At the same time, the Party and the Government proceed from the fact that the successful conduct of military operations even in a modern war is possible only on the basis of a coordinated application of all means of armed combat and the com- bined efforts of all types of armed forces. Therefore the Soviet Government re- tains a certain number- of and a corresponding reasonable proportion in all types of armed forces. Their constant combat readiness and high vigilance make it possible at any time to deal a crushing, retaliatory blow against any aggressor. Filled with pride for their beloved Motherland and their people, the soldiers of the Army, Air Force and the Navy unanimously welcome the decision made by the Supreme Soviet for a further considerable reduction in the size of the Armed For- ces. At the conferences and meetings of the personnel, meetings of Party aktivs conducted in the units and groups of the Air Force, the aviator-fighters warmly approve the measures of the Soviet Government, express their aspiration to serve the Fatherland even better, to perfect combat skill, and more persistently to mas- ter the equipment and weapons intrusted to them. Each aviator is deeply conscious of the fact that the historic peaceloving step taken by the Soviet Government will enhance the international prestige of our Mother- land even more, will extend the scope of the struggle of progressive forces for dis- armament even further and for strengthening peace and security in all the world. The reduction of the Armed Forces by one third and decreasing the expenditures for military needs according to the government budget of the USSR will yield an ap- preciable economy in material resources. All of this will be an additional rein.- forcement for considerably overfulfilling the plans of the national economy. In the soldiers who will be put in the reserves the socialist industry will obtain valuable workers. Let us take, for example, the aviators. The officers of the Air Force ? be it a commander or a political worker, a pilot or a navigator, an engineer or a tech- nician, an instrument specialist or a technical landing-facilities specialist, a work- er in the Air Force rear or repair shops ? by an overwhelming majority they all possess high moral and political qualities and organizational abilities. At the same time they constantly deal with the most up-to-date and complex equipment and have gained practical habits in handling it. A good number of our combat comrades, having left the control sticks of air- craft, are successfully working in plants and factories, in mines, in kolkhozes and sovkhozes, in transportation, and fly the air routes of civil aviation. The Soviet man is filled with peaceful aspirations and creative plans. However, he is not only able to work well, but also to guard his home from plunderers and invaders. The peaceful la.bor of our people is guarded vigilantly and indefatigably, a AINNIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMMINO11101111.11?1111111111111111 Editorial as before, by the glorious Soviet Armed Forces which have all that is needed to utterly defeat any aggressor. Celebrating the 42nd Anniversary of the Soviet Army and Navy, the soldiers of the Air Force achieved new remarkable successes in combat and political training. During the past academic year there was an increase in the ranks of Military Pilots and Navigators First Class, masters of flying, who skillfully use the corn-'' bat capabilities of aircraft under the most adverse conditions, at various altitudes, day and night. Many air commanders, who are veritable masters of t.caining and indoctrinat- ing soldiers, during the last war had themselves passed through a stern school of combat training. The Motherland evaluated their feats of arms according to their deserts. More than 2000 aviator-pilots were honored with the high title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Many of these heroes of past combats are now skillfully training subordinates and indoctrinate able aerial fighters. In this issue of the magazine we have articles by such air commanders as Heroes of the Soviet Union P. P. Karava.y, N. A. Opryshko and A. V. Sarygin as well as stories about successes in training aviators achieved by Heroes of the Soviet Union V. A. Tyshevich and M. I. Rybak. The practical experience of the heroes of past combats in indoctrinating and training subordinates in peace time presents great interest and deserves wide dissemination. The 42nd Anniversary is marked with great successes by the aviators of the subunits headed by Military Pilots First Class, officers M. N. Molchanov and I. S. Krutenko. During the last year all the pilots here raised their class rating to the next higher level, they fly well day and night; Outstanding Men comprise three fourths of the total number of soldiers. The elements commanded by officers V. I. Maloy, B. A. Akopov and N. T. Prikhoda became Outstanding. The pilots of these subunits excellently carried out missions in tactical training and were citcd by the Minister of Defense of the USSR. The engineering and technical personnel of air units and subunits now ensure more reliably the operation and maintenance of aircraft, striving to eliminate causes for flight accidents. The soldiers of the Air Force rear are working suc- cessfully. Due to skillful organization of work by air commanders, the initiative and creative attitude toward work of all the Party organizations and all the Commun- ists in the units and subunits, there has been an increase not only in the number of Outstanding Airmen but also a great number of entire crews, elements, and squadrons have won the honorable right to be called Outstanding. The aviator-fighters will also in the future strive for further improvement in showings for all types of combat and political training, increase the combat read- iness of units and subunits, reliably guard the interests of our great Motherland. It is exactly here that they see their primary and paramount task. Its successful resolution will in many respects be promoted by a further improvement in the ideological work amongst the masses. The resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU \"On the Tasks of Party Propaganda Under Modern Conditions\" makes it obligatory for our army Commu- nists and Party organizations to strengthen by all means ideological indoctrination work, strive to see that the all-conquering propaganda of Marxist-reninist ideas attain the level of modern requirements, that it serve the victory of Communism. in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2014/05/02: CIA-RDP81-01043R004800160001-7 1 6 Editorial Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release Now the task of raising combat skill is set before the personnel of the AirTh? Force in a more acute form, firstly because the Air Force becomes smaller in size and, consequently, it must be controlled immeasurably better; secondly, be- cause it will be necessary to master new, more improved, and therefore more complex aircraft which are being adopted.

MUST BE AT THE LEVEL ? OF PARTY REQUIREMENTS? Col. V. A. 1_,IPATOV With great interest and attention the aviators continue to study the decisions and materials of the December Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU in 1959 which summed up the work done by the Party for the steep upsurge in agri- culture and outlined an extensive program for its further development. Each commander and chief, each Party leader of the units and groups of the Air Force learns from the Party from the heroic examples of the struggle for Communism to be a militant or in resolving the tasks of combat training and improvement of combat readiness. The Plenum noted with satisfaction that the period after the Twenty-First Cong- ress of the Party was marked by new outstanding successes in the development of industry, agriculture, in the rise of the welfare of the people, in the realization of the peaceloving foreign policy of the Soviet State. As a result of the efforts of the heroic working class and all the toilers of our country, the output of industrial products in 1959 surpassed the planned quotas. An unprecedented activity .was displayed by the workers in agriculture who de- veloped socialist competition for fulfilling the quotas of the seven-year plan in four or five years and in order to quickly catch up with the USA in the production of the most important agricultural products per capita of population. Their selfless struggle showed appreciable results. In 1959 the kolkhozes and sovkhozes produced more meat, milk, eggs, and wool than in 1958. Our country has already surpassed the USA in the gross production of milk, as well as in the production of butter per capita of population. A remarkable example in the struggle for a rise in common animal husbandry was displayed by the workers of Ryazan' region under the leadership of the Party organization. In the past year they incre,ased the production of meat 3.8 times and sold to the State 3 times more of it than in 1958. Considerable results in the struggle for a rise in agriculture and animal hus- bandry and an increase in the output of agricultural products was obtained by the Russian Federated, the Ukrainian, the Byelorussian, and other republics, regions, districts, sovkhozes and kolkhozes of our country.

Ljaatov Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release In all the republieth., territories and regions, in all fields of agriculture there are thousands of innovators who show outstanding achievements. The widely- developed socialist competition shows that the' decisions, of the Twenty-First Con- gress of the Party for the development of agriculture will be fulfilled ahead of time. In the successes of agricultural development the Soviet people see the advan- tages of our socialist system and great possibilities for even more accelerated development of the kolkhoz village along the road to Communism. The example of agricultural toilers, especially of the Ryazan' region, shows what great results may be obtained in resolving tasks with well set-up organizational work, correct- ly chosen cadres, by mastering technology, and when the masses are skilfully stirred for great deeds. The Party organization of the Ryazan' region headed by the First Secretary of the Regional Committee, now Hero of Socialist Labor, A. N. Larionov, were able to stir and organize the masses to resolve great tasks, as a result of which the region became one of the foremost ones and a school of advanced experience. However, slackening of organizational work is still allowed here and there. Thus in the Kazakh Republic, as a result of faults in agricultural leadership and a low level of organizational work, serious shortcomings developed in carrying out the state plans for agricultural development. In connection with this the Plenum demanded of the Party organizations that they decisively improve the condition of organizational and political work amongst the masses, achieve an increase in the output of products and the unconditional fulfillment of pledges. The Plenum approved measures fora further rise of agriculture and animal husbandry, an increase of agricultural products and pledges for fulfilling the quotas of the seven-year plan ahead of time, and instructed the Party and the Soviet organs to concentrate the efforts of the Communists and all the workers on the prac- tical realization of outlined plans. Addressing the Plenum, N. S. Khrushchev said: \"In the final analysis, our successes are brilliant. The enemies of socialism are now discouraged by the victories of the Soviet Union. Having these victories, we can move ahead rnore confidently toward new achievements. We have climbed to a great height and have gathered good speed. Therefore it is already easier now to switch over to the higher speeds and gain new heights.\" The call of the Plenum to fulfill the quotas of the seven-year plan ahead of time and to create an abundance of agricultural products and the examples of innovators inspire all the Soviet people, including the soldiers of the Soviet Army, to hp-relit- labor for the glory of our great socialist Motherland. The decisions of the Plenum and the practical tasks ensuing from them to im- prove organizational work as one of the major links at the present stage are active- ly discussed at Army Party organizations. At past conferences and meetings, Communist aviators, armed with the decisions of the Plenum, uncovered a number of shortcomings in the organizational work of commander-Communists, political organs and Party organizations, and outlined specific measures for improving Party-political work. It is necessary that the organizational work in the units and subunits be raised to the level of Party requirements, which will serve as a pledge for resolving the tasks facing the aviators in 1960. 50-Yr 2014/05/02 : CIA-RDP81-01043R004800160001-7 ANNILMINIMIW The Organizational Role MP 9 The improvement of organizational work amongst the masses has been always given great emphasis by our Party. The Party constantly taught and teaches that the resolutions of outlined tasks never come by themselves, spontaneously, without hard practical work, that they are secured through a high level of organizational work among Communists and non-Party men. The Party subjected those to severe criticism who substituted for live organizational work amongst the masses talks on tasks \"in general\", speechifying, and mere paper work. The Party teaches that at the present stage of Communist building the role of organizational work will rise constantly, inasmuch as ever newer masses of work- ers join active participation in deciding national tasks, while socialist democracy attains ever greater development. Organizational work is conducive to pulling the lagging areas up to the level of the foremost ones. In the units and subunits of the Air Force there is quite a number of remark- able organizers of combat and political training, innovators, and outsta.ncling stu- dents by whose example all the aviators learn. Known as good organizers are air commanders A. A. Ionov, S. V. Pepelin, and political workers V. M. Yegor'yi- chev, N. M. Inyakin, G. Kh. Sadykov, and many others. In the fighter subunit which is now commanded by A. A. Ionov there was pre- viously a whole number of material shortcomings in flight training. With the as- signment of officer Ionov as commander, the situation noticeably changed for the better. This Communist, an experienced air commander, supported by the force of the Party organization, introduced the necessary organization into the combat training. ? Assisting the laggers and extensively utilizing the experience of the foremost pilots, masters of aerial combat and sniper fire, he was able to organize the job in such a manner that not an hour of training was wasted. The commander raised the exactingness toward subordinates, was able to create a strong nucleus of in- structor-pilots. With a knowledge of the job, the Party organization actively helps the commander to eradicate shortcomings, widely propagandizes the experience of the foremost pilots and aircraft specialists. Competition became here lively and creative. At the present time the subunit has become foremost, a fact which was noted at the Party conference, and officer Ionov was commended by the senior commander. Soldiers are organized in a combat-like fashion for raising combat readiness and for mastering equipment and forestalling flight accidents by political workers V. M Yegor'yichev and N. M. Inyakin. Together with the commanders, they con- duct great mass-political and organizational work, striving to see that all the mis- sions are carried out by the flight personnel in a superior manner and on time. Since 1950 the pilots of the unit where secretary of the Party bureau is P. S. Litvinov have been flying without flight accidents. This was achieved here due to the good organizational work of commander-Communists, the great responsibility for the job entrusted, and constant feeling for the new. The commander and the Party organization managed to unite the unit into a team, to organize well the execution of each new mission, think out and conduct work to forestall, flight acci- dents and the causes of them. As was noted at the Party conference, the Party organization does not concern itself with registering neglects, but fights for success in work and forestalling shortcomings.

A. Lipatov Unfortunately organizational work is still far from answering the demands of the Party everywhere. As was pointed out at a Party conference, officers T. P. Levchenko and N. V. Berezin made a pledge.in 1959 on behalf of the personnel of their subunit to make the si.xbunit the best in the unit and challenged another subunit to compete. This pledge, however, was not fulfilled. Actually it was forgotten in the unit as well. Is it really possible to call such actions organizational work, actions which are mainly directed toward registering facts? Of course not. In order to be a mili- tant organizer of the masses it is necessary to study the state of affairs well, out- line ways and methods for an upsurge in work, take into account all the resources and possibilities, stir the people for a struggle and to head it personally. A correct attitude for fulfilling. pledges made was taken in the squadron com- manded by Communist L. Z.? Rubin. In the past year the personnel of the squadrnn worked hard and persistently for. fulfilling their pledges, which were embodied in actual deeds. In 1960 the squadron assumed new and higher socialist pledges: to become Outstanding and strive to see that each pilot, in addition to successfully ful- filling the plan of flight training, considerably raise his engineering and technical knowledge. Fighting aviators carry on the service selflessly. Having warmly approved the \"Law for a New Considerable Reduction in the Armed Forces of the USSR\" passed by the Fourth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Soviet pilots, navi- gators, aviation specialists, and all of those who are called upon, in line of duty, to guard vigilantly the peaceful creative labor of our people, spare no efforts in raising their knowledge and combat skill to strengthen the combat readiness of the subtinits. The reduction of the Armed Forces of the USSR is a measure of great state importance. Putting the measure into practice will require considerable time, great organizational work, exceptional attention by commanders, political organs, and the Party organizations. The main point consists in the fact that this reduction must be carried out in a most organized manner, while preserving superior combat readiness in our Army and Navi. As previously, the questions of combat readiness of the troops and the vigilance of the personnel must be the center of attention for all our officer cadres and all the political and Party organizations. The strengthening of ideological work in the masses as required by the resolution of the CC of the CPSU \"On the Tasks of the Party Propaganda Under Modern Condi- tions\" will be a pledge of the successful resolution of the tasks facing the fighting aviators. Commanders, political organs and the Party organizations must support each new beginning, encourage the foremost men in training, and stir all the personnel to fight for new successes in their work. It is necessary to raise the organizational skills of our cadres, be an example in work, skilfully inspire the people to resolve great: talcs s and achieve new successes. We are committed to this by the historic decisions of the Twenty-First Congress of the Party and the December Plenum of the CC of the CPSU. This year the personnel of the Air Force have great tasks before them. In or- der to resolve them successfully it isnecessary to raise the flight and methodo- logical training of the leading personnel and its instructor skills to a new level. Air commanders must sharply improve the style of their work in training and he r anizationI, ole 11 indoctrinating subordinates. By systematically adopting advanCed methods of training in practice, supporting the initiative of innovators, correctly utilizing the forces of the Party and Komsomol organizations, we will achieve new successes and will indoctrinate quite a number of high-class military pilots, navigator s, and aircraft specials ists. This will raise the level of combat readiness of our units and subunits. Party conferences have shown that we have at our disposal great possibilities for a more successful resolution of tasks posed by the Party before the Armed Forces. It is only necessary that the commanders, political organs, ?Party organ- izations, and all the Communists improve political and organizational work. To be militant organizers of the masses ? such is the requirement of the Party. olg 0 CIO Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2014/05/02 : CIA-RDP81-01043R004800160001-7 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release Fi? rI 111L1TAIV-HI5TawAL WO KIM. UNREMITTING ATTENTION Col. Gen. of the Air Force S. I. MIRONOV, Hero of the Soviet Union In recent years, increasingly more military historical work is being done in the air units, commands, and educational institutions. In the Air Force of the Moscow, Carpathian, and other military districts, .study of the combat operations of Soviet aviation during the Great Patriotic War_has been organized. A number of subjects are being studied in the command training program. In the clubs and Officers' Homes, lectures and reports on military historical subjects are being given periodically; in the subunits, talks are being. organized with the young men on the history and the combat course of the unit. Meetings with Heroes of the Soviet Union, veterans of past wars, and partisans of the Great Patriotic War en- joy great popularity among the airmen. In many air unit's, there are combat course stands, combat glory rooms are being built, the histories of units, commands, and educational institutions have been written and are being written. Initiative worthy of imitation has been displayed by the motion picture fans of one of the units in the Air Force of the Moscow Military District. By their own re- sources they produced a documentary topical film on the history of their unit, which was given a high evaluation by the personnel and the command of the Air Force of the military district. In the Leningrad A. F. Mozhayskiy Military Air Engineering Academy, mili- tary historical work is being conducted according to a specially worked out plan. There the study of the history of military art and the history of aviation has been organized with permanent personnel. With the aim of improving the quality of teaching this discipline, the lectures have been reworked, equipping of the history of military art and history of aviation room is being completed, textbooks and visual aids have been prepared. An authors' collective has been organized to write the history of the Academy. A history of .the Academy room is also being equipped. Great service in this work has been done by the teachers of the depart- ment headed by officer R. I. Dolmatov. To raise the ideological and scientific level of military historical work, as- semblies were held of teachers of military art and history of aviation in the mili- tary educational institutions of the Air Force. This made it possible to augment ? 4. 50-Yr 2014/05/02 : CIA-RDP81-01043R004800160001-7 For Military-Historical Work 13 11111111MINOINIMIIIIP the knowledge of the teachers with important new information on the history of the Civil War and the Great Patriotic War, especially in regard to the development and combat application of the Soviet Air Force, to work out uniform views on the meth- odology of teaching the history of military art and the history of aviation, and to exchange experience. In the past year, seven military historical works have been published, which can be used by the officers and generals for independent study of the combat ex- perience of our Air Force. It must be said that this year and in subsequent years the publication of such literature will increase. Thus, a group of authors has undertaken to produce major works in which the history of domestic aviation will be reflected quite extensively and completely. Steps are being taken to publish source and reference literature. Several collections of documents on the history and combat operations of the Air Force have already been published; a work that is extremely necessary for military historians and xesearchers, as well as for all officers and generals, \"The Soviet Air Force in the Great Patriotic War in Fig- ures\", is being produced. A series of posters on the history of our aviation is ex- pected to come out. Work has been begun on \"A History of Navigation and Aviation in Illustrations\". Production of several educational documentary topical films has been planned. All this, without a doubt, attests to an incipient upsurge in military historical work and is directed toward giving air officers and generals the necessary mini- mum of historical knowledge that facilitates more successful resolution of the tasks of combat training of the troops and more profound comprehension and further creative development of the present-day operational art and tactics of the Air Force. Study of the heroic past of our aviation will permit improving the indoc- trination of the personnel in the glorious combat traditions of So-riet airmen. Familiarization with the status of military historical work shows, however, that not yet all commanders and Party-political organs use to the fullest extent in the indoctrination and education of the men the glorious history of our aviation, the numerous examples of heroism and unexampled devotion of Soviet airmen to their Motherland. In some units and educational institutions, even lectures and reports on mili- tary historical subjects are used extremely little in propaganda and cultural educa- tional work and in the system of command training. And yet these are forms of propaganda that are accessible to all and that are most simple in organization. Things are not 'entirely satisfactory with visual propaganda of the heroic past and the best traditions of air units, commands, and formations. Nothing except an indifferent attitude toward this matter can explain the lack of combat glory rooms in even some of the renowned Guards air units and commands. Still too rare is collective discussion of published military historical works, articles, and memoirs of air commanders. Some officers and generals bury in oblivion the experience of the past war, reasoning somewhat as follows: why, they say, study the history of military ari and the history of aviation when the development of technology is going forward so rapidly and therefore much of the past is no longer applicable now? Such ideas and reasoning may arise among those who seek in combat experience, in the historical past, a standard that is most appropriate for present-day combat or operations. But this is precisely what cannot be done. 0 neclassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2014/05/02 : CIA-RDP81-01043R004800160001-7 14 S. I. Mironov Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2014/05/02 : CIA-RDP81-01043R004800160001-7 Study of the history of wars, of military art, and of aviation helps to reveal regularities in armed struggle, inculcates habits of a creative approach to the de- velopment of battle tactics and the art of conducting operations that are the most applicable for the given conditions, and to a whole series of other problems that are urgent for the Air Force. In studying history, principal attention should be concentrated on the most im- portant operations in the Great Patriotic War. In the system of command training for the 1960 training year there can be planned, for example, a study of such sub- jects as the combat operations of the Soviet Air Force in the summer and fall cam- paign of 1941, the battles at Moscow and Stalingrad, and the air battles over the Northern Caucasus in 1943. In this, special attention should be devoted to master- ing organizational experience and the conduct and support of the combat operations of Soviet aviation. The forms and methods of study may be diverse, but lectures and seminar lessons have proven themselves in the air units and commands to be the most vital. The time and the specific questions for each subject should be determined in addition, depending on the profile and level of the training of the study group. Let us take, for example, such a subject as \"The Combat Operations of Soviet Aviation in the Battle of Moscow\". In this case, a group of air unit flight personnel should analyze in greater detail the tactics of aviation operations; a group of engineering- technical personnel must dwell more on examining the work of the aircraft engi- neering service under combat conditions; while officers of the air technical sub- units should concentrate principal attention on problems of material and technical support and airfield servicing of the combat operations of air units. In the study groups of air commands the emphasis should be on the development of tactics and particularly the operational art of the Air Force during the war. In this it must be kept in mind that the main form of studying history will be independent work by the officers. Consequently, everything necessary must be done to make it fruitful. In particular, it -.is necessar-y- to take pains that the lib- raries of the units and commands have the necesSary quantity of military historical literature. Lists of literature must be displayed prominently in the classroom or in the rooms for independent preparation. Both the higher and the secondary educational institutions of the Air Force should give considerable assistance to the air units in studying the history of mili- tary art, especially in the early stages. Teachers of the history of military art in the academies, the higher engineering and secondary military education institutions could go to the troops periodically to give lectures and reports on military histor- ical subjects. There must be no relaxation of efforts to improve and perfect the forms of teaching the course on the history of military art and the history of aviation to the cadets and students of Air Force higher educational institutions. More creativeness must be displayed in the departments in working out lectures, textbooks and visual aids. However, not everywhere is this work being done at the proper level. Thus, in the military educational institution where the teacher is Maj. V. I. Zaytsev, the lectures are not written out completely and not all of them are apt in content. C 0 O For Militar -Historical Work 15 The general military situation is outlined in too much detail in them, and too little attention is paid to the development of the operational art and tactics of the .44-r Force. The classroom and the history of military art room are not equipped. The diagrams are drawn very primitively, incompletely, and with distortions. Even the report cards contain violations of the requirements of methodological instruc- tions. All this was a result of the fact that there is no proper control in the school over the quality of the lectures worked out on the history of military art and the conduct of methodological work. It is absolutely not normal when the work of the teacher in this discipline was checked only once in the cour se of a year and only two lectures written by him were discussed-in 1958 and 1959 at methodological conferences on the series.

A good history room has been set up, in particular, in one of the units of the Air Force of the Moscow Military District on the initiative of Communists N. Ya. ?Kobel'kov and V. S. Frolov with the active participation of the Party and Komsomol organizations. Shown graphically here is the glorious path traveled by the military unit and the remarkable people that were brought up in its friendly collective. It is attractively decorated, with great taste and love. The men of the unit consider it their pride and visit it with great eagerness. There is no doubt that such rooms will help every officer and soldier to learn better the-history of his unit, war deeds, and the feats of heroes from -whom exam- ples can be taken, to imitate the steadfastness, courage, and daring that have been displayed in the fight against the enemies of our Motherland. In the Soviet Air Force there are many renowned Guards units and commands and venerable educational institutions whose heroic past and combat traditions should be known both to the men of the Soviet Army and to the entire Soviet people, especially the young generation. Worthy of approval in this connection is the initi- ative of a number of commanders and political organs who have already published the history of their units and educational institutions. Let us name but a few of ? them. The history of the X air regiment, published by the Political Administration of the Transcaucasian Military District, shows the combat path, the heroism, and the courage of the personnel in battles at the walls of Stalingrad, in the Kursk bulge, for right-bank Ukraine, and for liberation of the peoples of Europe from the Hitlerite enslavers. A special chapter is devoted to the immortal feats of the X.orn- somol members of the regiment. The text is illustrated with sketches and photo- graphs of the distinguished men of the unit. Also well organized is the history of the Orenburg Military Aviation School for Pilots. Officers L. A. Treskunov, V. V. Veselov, F. G. Ivanov, V. V. Kondrat'- yev, A. T. Klement',rev, and others worked hard on it. Related in the pages of this book is the birth of one of the oldest Soviet aviation schools, its early years of activity, the participation of the school's graduates in the development of our avia- tion and in battles for the Soviet Motherland, especially during the Great Patriotic War, and about those who today are multiplying the glory and traditions of the school. Reflected in it is the great concern of the Communist Party and the Soviet Government for the development and strengthening of the. Soviet Air Force, for the training and indoctrination of aviation cadres. Educated within the walls of this school were many of those who later on glori- fied our Motherland with helroic deeds and enriched Soviet aviation science and technology with new discoveries and achievements. In the book their deeds are shown, their recollections and photographs are given. In compiling and writing the books,, both the documents of the unit and the school and archive materials were used, as were the recollections of veterans and graduates of the school. These books have now become desk copies; they call for cherishing and augmenting glorious traditions. In conformity with instructional documents, it is necessary to produce histor- ies of units and educational institutions in the course of two years. The most ex- perienced and best prepared officers should be brought in. for this. 4. ? For Military-Historical Work AMR 17 We still publish too little memoir literature and the recollections of veterans of past wars. Evidently, still inadequately developed is organizational and ex- planato:y work among- 'officers and generals in reserve and in retirement and the necessary conditions for their creative activity have not been established. And yet this task could successfully be performed by the political organs and Party organizations through the clubs and garrison Officers' Homes. Relying on the aktiv of officers and generals in reserve, the clubs and Officers' Homes could or- ganize discussions of military historical works that are published and disseminate propaganda of the history of aviation more extensively. No small role in increasing the output of military historical literature on avia- tion can be played by the publishing organs, and in particular, by the Military Publishing House of the Ministry of Defense of the USSR. There is no need to. prove the great importan.ce.that movies may have in the propaganda of the heroic past. Very unfortunately, almost no films appear on our screens telling of the history of Soviet aviation, of its personnel. Air commanders, political organs, and Party and Komsomol organizations must devote considerably more attention to military historical work, which will facilitate the ideological indoctrination of the men as required by the resolution of the CC of the CPSU \"On the Tasks of Party Propaganda Under Present-Day Conditions\". IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE SEVEN- YEAR PLAN \"Where are you now, regimental friends?\" This question about the fate of many former fighting airmi can he answered briefly thlis in the forefront of the? seven-year plan, there where the material-technical base of Communism is being built. Here is some brief news on the peaceful work affairs of some demobilized pilots. ...The distinguished fighter pilot who destroyed several dozens of Fascist planes in aerial battles, twice Hero of the Soviet Union, officer Vasiliy Aleksand- rovich Zaytsev after demobilization became head of an industrial enterprise, which, as they said in the Party district committee, \"was limping on all four legs\". Former air commander V. A. Zaytsev was not frightened by the difficulties, was able to become a true production commander and bring the enterprise he head- ed among the leading ones. Now from month to month plans are being overfulfilled there, the amount of above-plan output is increasing, cost is declining, the tech- nical efficiency of production is rising. The collective of the plant headed by V. A. Zaytsev is making by its labor a worthy contribution to the common cause of building Communism. ? ? ? Fighter pilot Nikolay Kuz'rnich Loshakov, .who fought the enemy during the war at Leningrad, worked for some time after demobilization as chief of the Vorkuta airport. However, he wanted to master the specialty of a miner and began working at a mine, extracting quality Pechora coal for the country. Soon N. K. Loshakov became section chief in pit No. 40 of the \"Vorkutaugol\" Combine.

Cadet Yu. A. Faints flying became unsteady; he some- times made serious errors. The suggestion was made to wash him out. We had a talk with him. It developed that Filin came to the flying school with a lot of enthus- iasm; he studied with perseverance and persistently, but in some areas he had dif- ficulty; moreover, for some time he was ill and fell behind in his studies. \"I want to fly,\" Filin announced, \"but not everything runs smoothly. I am try- ing to correct my deficiencies.\" The last words the cadet uttered without conviction. It was evident that he was beginning to seriously doubt his own ability and aptitude. I understood his state of mind. After all, I too at one time had been a trainee, and I too had a similar difficulty. I was discouraged by failures, faith in myself and my abilities waned, and with it fled the hope of becoming a pilot. It was then that my instructor came to my aid! His firm conviction in my ability to surmount my difficulties was unwavering. It seemed that he knew what I was capable of better than I did. Patiently the instructor over and over again showed me how to perform the troublesome operation until he finally succeeded. \"You will fly,\" he firmly announced after a routine flight during which I had achieved some measure of success in fathoming the \"secret\" of performing a dif- ficult aerobatic maneuver. From flight to flight my skill improved and with it grew faith in myself and the remarkable Soviet craft. And this faith, springing forth and growing strong through the painstaking care of the instructor, withstood all the trials of war years spent in combat. Many times my fighter-pilot subordinates and I were faced with a difficult combat situation. And every time we came through the difficult trials with honor. In 170 combat sorties made with my combat comrades, I carried out 31 aerial battles, personally shooting down 16 enemy aircraft and took part in 7 group battles. The feeling of confidence in my own ability, in my aircraft and armament was the firm basis of the victories I won. This is what I recalled when I was having my talk with cadet Filin. It was neces- sary to help him to gain confidence in himself, in his ability. We managed to sup- port the cadet in this moment so difficult for him, to force him to believe that he could fly successfully. Soon I had occasion to fly with him on a training plane inta the practice zone. Under difficult circumstances Filin made the takeoff, the flight in the pattern, and the landing successfully. True, Filin did not know the docu- ments that regulate flight work as he should have. But he quickly corrected-this. I think that Filin will be a good pilot. To undermine a trainee's faith in his own ability is easy, to restore and strengthen it is many times more difficult. We know that the activity of a pilot takes place under peculiar conditions; and the flying profession itself requires cer- tain definite qualities. What qualities are required for mastering the piloting technique and the combat employment of a present-day aircraft? In our opinion a pilot must be quite capable of concentrating his attention and reacting quickly, he must not be \"stiff\" and over- ly tense in flight, he must have good health and a good physical constitution, as well as good theoretical training and outstanding skills in operating aircraft and the special equipment. As we can see, these qualities cannot be inborn. This means that the flying profession does not demand of a person any special 'natural\" endowments. A 0 0 CIA-RDP81-01043R004800160001-7 v Heroes of the Soviet Union 23 genuine combat pilot can be developed during the process of training out of any youth who has a normal level of physical and mental development. Yet at one time there was among pilots a so-called theory of \"inborn flying qualities\", according to which a pilot must be born and only some kind of special innate qualities of \"flying talent\" are a pledge of successful flight work. From this there also flowed an underestimation of the role of training and teaching of the business of flying. Instead of doing painstaking work with this or that cadet, they often cast him aside as incapable. The methodology of teaching the technique of piloting, which consisted of narration, explanation, and demon- stration both on the ground and in flight, was underestimated. This same \"theory\" of innate flying qualities engendered among the trainees a lack of faith in their own abilities at the very first failure or difficulty. Many years of experience in teaching and training cadets in the business of fly- ing at our school eloquently refutes this, if one may call it that, theory. Exper- ience attests to the fact that those instructor pilots and teachers who study pro- foundly the qualities of the cadets from the first to the last days of their training and who use the individual approach in teaching achieve positive results. A good example is the activity of instructor pilots officers P. G. Gribkov, Yu. Yu. Ryazanov, Yu. K. Skirrnunt, B. L. Podosinnikov, S. G. Savinov, and a number of others. Training subordinates in complex aviation equipment for a long time, they have achieved high results, and they have not washed out a single cadet because of lack of flying proficiency. What is the answer? Why do these instructor pilots have no unproficient stu- dents? Have they had only cadets with high \"innate\" flying qualities? Their suc- cess lies in the fact that they know very well the basic principles of Soviet peda- gogy, apply them efficiently in the process of training, and understand to perfec- tion the technique of piloting a plane and the methodology of demonstration both on the ground and in flight. They do not look for inherent qualities among the cadets, but during the entire course of the training period they inculcate in them the neces- sary qualities, instill a valuable sense of confidence in their abilities and in the combat equipment. Even in these subunits there are difficulties, critical situations so to speak, but the teacher commanders help the cadets in time to overcome their difficulties. Let us give an example. Cadet V. A. Fedorov successfully completed the dual program in a combat training plane and received permission to make a solo flight. But he made the first solo flight and subsequent flights with grave mistakes. What was the matter? CaLling up the trainee for a frank talk, instructor pilot officer S. G. Savinov found out that he had lost faith -3..n his ability because the crackup of a plane by another cadet had made a negative impression on him. The instructor had to work to instill the necessary moral qualities in the trainee. Once again they had a talk about the reliability of the aviation equipment. Flights were made to correct mistakes in landing. During the landings Savinov created situations such that the plane deviated from the assigned glide path, brought the craft, down to the ground with a low or a high roundout, etc., and re- quired-the cadet to correct the mistake. With each flight the trainee acted more confidently and competently. He learned that the plane is very reliable, it is only necessary to operate it competently and skillfully. As a result, Cadet Fedorov Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2014/05/02 : CIA-RDP81-01043R004800160001-7"
