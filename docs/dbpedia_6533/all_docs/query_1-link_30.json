This ranking is based on the behavior of users around the world, including Japan, so it does not mean that the names are commonly viewed by Japanese people only.\n\nPlease note that just because a name has been viewed more times does not mean it is a famous name in Japan.\n\nWhat is Hiragana?\n\nHiragana is a syllabary used in written Japanese, which originated from the cursive style of Kanji.\n\nWhat is Katakana?\n\nKatakana is also a Japanese syllabary. Basically, the characters don't have any meaning by themselves, they only represent the sounds.\n\nJapanese try to express the words came from foreign languages with the most similar sounds in Japanese using Katakana.\n\nWhat is English Transcription?\n\nEnglish Transcription is a term used when translating Japanese names into English. It represents a romanised version of the name with the aim of reproducing the pronunciation as accurately as possible. English Transcription can also be used for name searches.\n\nJapanese Style Nickname\n\nIn Japan, nicknames are commonly used to express familiarity and affection. Here are key features and contexts:\n\nShortened Forms: Names are often shortened for ease and intimacy, such as 'Yuki' from 'Yukiko' or 'Taka' from 'Takashi'.\n\nSuffixes: Terms like 'chan' for girls and 'kun' for boys are added to names among close friends and family. However, 'chan' can also be used for boys during childhood. Additionally, among adults who are very close, like best friends, 'chan' may still be used to convey affection and familiarity. More Details\n\nUsage and Cultural Aspects: Nicknames are typically used in informal settings among friends, family, or close colleagues, and are not suitable for formal or professional environments. The use of a nickname suggests a degree of intimacy and should reflect the nature of the relationship. Young people often demonstrate creativity in their social interactions by crafting unique nicknames.\n\nNote: In Japanese, the long vowel sound is indicated by a special character called a \"chōonpu\" (長音符), which looks like a horizontal dash (ー). This character serves to extend the duration of the vowel sound immediately preceding it. For instance, in the name \"あーちゃん\" (A-chan), the \"あ\" (A) is extended, producing a prolonged \"ah\" sound, similar to the \"a\" in \"father.\""
