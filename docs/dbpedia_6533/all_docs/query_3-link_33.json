        "text": "Jay might argue with Sunghoon about the most trivial, mundane things on a day-to-day basis, but one thing they had easily agreed on was that they wouldn’t really bother keeping their relationship a secret from the other members.\n\n“It’ll be convenient,” Sunghoon had said. “Let them think whatever they want to think. We only have to be careful in front of the cameras and the fans.”\n\nThe latter was a given anyway, and something they had been cautious about already. It didn’t mean that they would necessarily try to make it obvious to the group, or, heaven forbid, make an announcement to them, but Jay figured that if a member asked, they could have the conversation with everyone then. They were stable enough as a group, and they were all mature too.\n\n“Hey, idiot!” Sunghoon shouted, his expression open and full of laughter as he pointed accusingly at Jay, the other members around them giggling at Sunghoon’s reaction. Right, very mature. “We could’ve gotten that point if you had hit the buzzer in time!”\n\nThey were playing a speed quiz as a part of their EN-O’CLOCK retreat episode, and Jay had missed his timing, currently landing their three-person team in last place. He was kind of terrible at this game, he realized.\n\n“When did you get so competitive?” Jay asked with a sniff, purposefully pushing the buzzer away from his reach as if to say, screw you too.\n\nSunoo, sitting between them, put his head in his hands. “Please put in me a different team,” he bemoaned.\n\n“What, you don’t like me?” Sunghoon asked Sunoo.\n\nJungwon snickered from the side. “We actually have a chance, Heeseung hyung. That team’s falling apart—Jay hyung and Sunghoon hyung are fighting again.”\n\n“And of course I’m being competitive,” Sunghoon said, turning his attention back to Jay. “The prize is hanwoo beef. I don’t joke around about hanwoo beef,” he said gravely.\n\n“I can buy you all the beef you could possibly want after this, even if we don’t win,” Jay pointed out. If he hadn’t been frowning at Sunghoon when he’d said that, it would’ve practically been a love confession. No one really seemed to notice, though. Or even care, really.\n\nSunghoon looked at him incredulously. “You’ve seriously lost your mind. Sunoo, take him away.”\n\n“Do I look like some sort of guard to you? Take him away where?” Sunoo asked, almost in despair.\n\nJungwon was right: their team was falling apart. Jay could see even some of the staff members giggling at them behind the cameras, and pressed his lips together not to laugh as well.\n\nThe game quickly moved on to the final round where Jake and Ni-ki’s team buzzed first, Ni-ki getting the answer correct and Jake freaking out in celebration.\n\n“Naur way… let’s go!!”\n\n“Ah, Jjongssaeng!” Sunghoon cried out, standing up in his passion as Sunoo laid his head down on the table in defeat.\n\nNi-ki and Jake embraced each other with a kind of heartfelt victory that would make one assume that they’d won a prestigious award rather than some meat, jumping up and down as the director congratulated them with their prize.\n\nJay laughed at the ridiculousness of the situation, a warm, fond feeling settling in his chest as he observed the members. If Sunghoon remained sulky about the team’s loss, Jay would just treat him to an even better cut of beef after their retreat. It wasn’t hard, not with Sunghoon.\n\nThings that Sunghoon called Jay:\n\n“Hey, idiot!”\n\n“Jjongssaeng”\n\n“Jay-ah~” (when he wanted something)\n\nJay had never been particularly big on nicknames. It wasn’t anything personal or even that he disliked them or anything—he called Heeseung hyung because it was proper, referred to Ni-ki as ‘Riki’ when they weren’t on camera, and sometimes switched between Jake and Jaeyun when the situation called for it, but otherwise remained fairly loyal to everyone’s given names—he’d just never given it too much thought.\n\nSunghoon, on the other hand, clearly found nicknames exceedingly amusing, if all the variations of Jongseong he rattled out in a single day was any indication. “Jjongssaeng, our Jjongssaengie,” he’d say, his eyes crinkling in laughter, like the nickname was the funniest thing that had ever occurred to him. The others would also laugh along with him, not necessarily because they found the nickname inherently funny, but rather because Sunghoon being amused by such small measures was entertaining in and of itself.\n\nIt wasn’t just Jay that was a target of Sunghoon’s odd affections, though it did seem he was the main recipient. Ikeu, ekeu, Jake, cake was also a particular phrase that Sunghoon seemed to be fond of lately, constantly rolling the hard consonants around on his tongue, and nowadays seemed to forego greeting Jungwon by name altogether and opted to meow whenever he saw him instead. It was just slightly eccentric enough in the typical Sunghoon way, and it would actually be incredibly endearing if it didn’t also make Sunghoon a bit of an oddball.\n\n“Jay-ah~” came Sunghoon’s distant voice. “Come help me figure this out!” Which basically meant, come do something for me.\n\n“What, you can’t do anything without me?” Jay called back, though he was already on his way down the hallway to the kitchen.\n\nThe place the group was spending the day in for their EN-O’CLOCK retreat was a rather lovely house—a house! not even an apartment like their dorm—and most of the members were now scattered across different rooms.\n\nThey had played another quick game after their speed quiz to decide who would be on the grocery shopping team, cooking team, or the dutyless winning team, and Jay had been put in the groceries team alongside Jungwon and Jake.\n\n“We’re really letting Ni-ki and Sunghoon be in charge of our dinner?” Jungwon had asked dubiously in the supermarket as Jay placed a container of ssamjang into their shopping cart.\n\n“Let’s not think too deeply about it,” Jay had said with a sigh, before turning his attention back to what else they would need to make a good dinner. Sunghoon and Ni-ki weren’t an entirely hopeless pair of cooks—Jay had faith in them. Kind of. “And we’re only getting one pack of ramyeon, Jake!”\n\n“If all else fails, Sunghoon and Ni-ki can at least make ramyeon for us,” Jake had pointed out as he turned his hand-held camera in Jay’s direction, so Jay sighed as he let Jake add another pack of ramyeon to their cart.\n\nThey had arrived back home with their groceries, unpacking everything in the kitchen before Jungwon and Jake immediately disappeared to where Sunoo and Heeseung were relaxing.\n\nJay, on the other hand, had barely sat down on the couch, scrolling on his phone for not even ten minutes before he was being summoned by Sunghoon’s call.\n\nSunghoon was holding a frozen meal kit that they’d bought close to his face, squinting at the instructions printed on the back. He looked up as Jay entered the doorway, immediately holding the package out for Jay to take. “You do it.”\n\n“You try,” Jay said.\n\n“The words for the instructions are too small,” Sunghoon insisted.\n\n“Then what makes you think I can read it?”\n\nSunghoon sighed, lowering his arm. “Right, I forgot you’re old and aging.”\n\nJay snatched the meal kit out of his hands. “I really can’t with you,” he said, shuffling over to the stovetop. He could feel Sunghoon hovering over his shoulder as he opened the package, familiar with the process, having made it before once at their dorm. “Where’s Ni-ki?” he asked. Ni-ki was supposed to be helping Sunghoon with dinner preparations, not Jay.\n\n“He disappeared,” Sunghoon said, seeming unconcerned for someone who had been clearly ditched by his cooking partner. “And it seems like a bad idea to make Ni-ki do anything too close to the stovetop anyway.”\n\nNi-ki wasn’t a little kid anymore, but Jay also had similar reservations about letting any of the younger members cook in front of a fire for a prolonged period of time, so he couldn’t really say anything.\n\n“Still, you’re not going to chase him down?” Jay asked, looking around the cabinets and then spotting an appropriate pot in triumph, the recipes for different dishes already forming in his head.\n\n“Why would I? I have you now,” Sunghoon said simply.\n\nJay paused, turning around to properly face Sunghoon, taking in the cheeky look on his face. “Are you using me?” he demanded. He didn’t actually mind, not really. Cooking was usually therapeutic for him, and there was something fulfilling about the members eating things that Jay made. “You know, I already did the grocery shopping. I shouldn’t have to cook as well.”\n\n“You should be honored,” Sunghoon retorted. “It shows how much faith I have in your cooking abilities.”\n\n“I’m not making dinner for seven people all by myself.”\n\n“You’re not,” Sunghoon said bluntly, like he was explaining something to a small child. “You have me.”\n\nIt was so annoyingly Sunghoon of him to reply like that. Ugh, it made Jay want to kiss him.\n\nThe thought hit him so hard and so suddenly it almost made him reel, suddenly too aware that the two of them were alone in the kitchen, with multiple cameras in every room that were going to be constantly filming as long as they were all in the house.\n\nAfterwards, he thought to himself. “Fine,” he said as he turned back to the stovetop, maybe a little gruffly. “Could you help me wash and chop the green onions for the stew? They should be in the fridge.”\n\n“Yessir,” Sunghoon said, mockingly saluting him.\n\nMaybe Jay would lightly smack the back of Sunghoon’s head afterwards too, for his insolence. “I’m helping you out of the goodness of my heart,” Jay warned.\n\n“Get to work, Chef Jjongssaeng.”\n\nJay began to fill his pot with water to prepare the meal kit, a comfortable silence settling between them as they worked on their own tasks.\n\nJjongssaeng. It was like Sunghoon couldn’t go an hour without calling him that these days. Jay didn’t have anything against it, especially not when it amused Sunghoon so much.\n\nWhen it came to Jay addressing Sunghoon, though, Jay found that it wasn’t so much specific nicknames he used, but rather a more specific tone or emotion that came over his voice—that tone or emotion usually being disappointment.\n\nJay rarely had a reason to directly call Sunghoon’s name unless Sunghoon was actively annoying him or teasing him. Or inconveniencing him. Or basically just bothering Jay in general. So on second thought, it was quite often.\n\n“Sunghoon-ah,” Jay said with a heavy sigh, giving Sunghoon a reproachful look as he took over Sunghoon’s spot in front of the stovetop, setting aside his task of cutting the onion for now. They had been working for a couple minutes, all of their dinner recipes in motion, until Sunghoon raised a sudden concern.\n\n“I didn’t know it was sugar,” Sunghoon said defensively. “It looks exactly the same as the salt in the containers.”\n\nIt didn’t really matter—Sunghoon had only used a pinch, just like the recipe had called for, except with sugar instead of salt. Worst case, they were just going to have a slightly sweeter stew than planned.\n\n“It’s fine, obviously,” Jay assured, just so Sunghoon wouldn’t feel guilty. Sunghoon probably didn’t, likely finding it funny more than anything else, but still. “But do I need to kick you out of the kitchen?”\n\nSunghoon crossed his arms. “And make you do everything by yourself? Yeah, maybe you should kick me out.” Contrary to his own words, he leaned over Jay’s shoulder to watch Jay stir the stew with a wooden spoon, and though they weren’t touching, his body was still a phantom line of warmth against Jay’s side.\n\nThey were probably close enough that if Jay turned his head, he’d be able to kiss Sunghoon’s cheek. Not that he would, because that would be crazy. It was just an observation.\n\nJay kept his face resolutely forward, even though the stew didn’t really need all that much attention, and then turned off the stove.\n\nThe sound of footsteps came down the hallway towards the kitchen. Sunghoon took a step back. “I can finish cutting the onion for you,” he said.\n\n“It’ll make you cry,” Jay said. “Wash the lettuce instead. The stew is done.”\n\nSunghoon made a face. “Why would I cry,” he muttered as if he didn’t know, though he opened the fridge to find the lettuce anyway.\n\nNi-ki, the culprit of the footsteps, wandered into the kitchen, almost like he had known Jay was there. “Hyung, did you buy any snacks from the grocery store?” he asked Jay.\n\n“Ni-ki!” Sunghoon exclaimed, abandoning his lettuce by the sink just like that. “Don’t think that you’ve gotten away with ditching cooking duty!”\n\n“Yah, don’t leave the water running!” Jay scolded Sunghoon. “And no snacks before dinner. You’ll ruin your appetite,” he said, chiding Ni-ki. In that moment, he was suddenly reminded so much of his own mom’s nagging that he stopped himself short in mild shock before shaking it off.\n\n“You’re no fun,” Ni-ki said petulantly, but acquiesced surprisingly easily. Jay supposed it was because of Ni-ki's residual guilt of being caught skiving off his dinner duties. “But fine. What can I do to help?”\n\n“The ramyeon,” Sunghoon said, pointing at the packages on the countertop. “Jay’s going to grill the meat.”\n\n“Oh great,” Jay said sarcastically. “I guess I’m grilling the meat.”\n\nHe had planned to be the one grilling the meat anyway, having bought the particular cuts of meat that he knew how to specifically grill to perfection, but Sunghoon’s audacity, seriously.\n\nBut dinner was coming together nicely, and Jay was filled with a certain sense of accomplishment. It was particularly nice spending time in the kitchen with Sunghoon, a kind of domesticity that Jay hadn’t known he’d been craving settling in his stomach. Maybe he could convince Sunghoon to make dinner with him back in the dorm sometime.\n\n“Or I could grill the meat,” Sunghoon offered, genuine.\n\nJay had been kidding, but maybe it had gone over Sunghoon’s head. “No, I’ll do it,” he said sincerely. “I was going to do it anyway.”\n\nSunghoon raised his eyebrows at him, an unspoken question but in a way that he must’ve known Jay would understand.\n\nJay just raised an eyebrow back at him, challenging him.\n\nSunghoon crossed his arms. “So,” he said in a tone Jay knew Sunghoon took whenever he wanted to be particularly teasingly difficult, “you think I can’t grill meat?”\n\n“No, hyung, you need to take advantage of stuff like this,” Ni-ki said, tugging at Sunghoon’s sleeve while holding the package of instant ramyeon in his other hand. “Especially if Jay hyung is offering to do it…”\n\nSunghoon cast a sideways smile at Ni-ki. “And you would know all about taking advantage of offers like that, wouldn’t you, you little punk?” he asked, poking Ni-ki’s side.\n\nNi-ki shrieked at the contact, running away from Sunghoon. Sunghoon immediately took after him in a near uncharacteristically childish manner, the two of them disappearing out of the kitchen into the hallway.\n\n“I already said I was sorry for ditching cooking duties!” came Ni-ki’s muffled shout.\n\n“No, you didn’t!”\n\nJay, left alone in the kitchen, smiled to himself as he returned to his chopping board.\n\nJay was almost disappointed when they had to leave the house after they wrapped up filming the next morning, being bundled up into different cars to their dorm, back to the real world.\n\nAs it was, Sunghoon had a scheduled dentist appointment to remove his wisdom teeth the next day. Usually, these things were done when they could be with their parents, but with how timing worked out against their favor, it found both Sunghoon and Jay awake and sitting at the kitchen table at nine in the morning, Sunghoon complaining about being hungry before the appointment.\n\nHalf of the remaining members were out on individual schedules, and the other half were sleeping in. Jay would’ve been sleeping in too, if not for Sunghoon barging into his room fully dressed and sitting down directly on Jay’s blanketed shins, making Jay suddenly lurch upright into consciousness from the unexpected weight. Probably the fastest way he’d ever been woken up in the morning. And the most painful.\n\nJay was still blinking the sleep out of his eyes, resisting the urge for his morning coffee since Sunghoon wasn’t able to eat or drink anything before going under anesthesia for the procedure either. “Isn’t there some psychological thing where the more you can’t have something, the more you want it?” he said.\n\n“I don’t care,” Sunghoon said. He drummed his fingers on the table anxiously, checking the time on his phone. He was waiting for the manager to arrive to pick him up for the appointment. “I’m hungry.”\n\n“Yeah, but,” Jay said reasonably, “you’re probably only so hungry because you’re not allowed to eat anything right now—”\n\nSunghoon’s eyes flashed dangerously, and Jay dutifully shut his mouth. Fair enough, it was hard to hear logic when you were tired and hungry.\n\nJay fought the instinct to comfort him, knowing Sunghoon would hate that even more. Instead, he picked up his phone, absently looking up recipes of soft foods Sunghoon would be able to eat after getting his wisdom teeth pulled out and saving a couple on his phone.\n\n“Let’s go eat galbi after this,” Sunghoon mumbled. He had reached over, fingers twisting into the sleeves of Jay’s pajamas, a rare initiation of touch. Probably only because they were the only two awake in the dorm at the moment. “I want barbeque meat.”\n\n“Sounds good,” Jay said affably, even though it would probably be a little while until Sunghoon could eat meat again. “Anything for the protein prince.”\n\nSunghoon just held onto Jay’s sleeve.\n\nThen, Sunghoon’s phone buzzed; the manager was here.\n\nSunghoon stood up, letting go of Jay and facing him. “So…” he said, trailing off a little. “I’ll see you after.”\n\n“Yeah,” Jay said, also standing up. Sunghoon didn’t seem all that nervous, but he was also sometimes extraordinarily good at masking his nerves. Jay wanted to be there for Sunghoon, and was glad that Sunghoon had woken him up before leaving for his appointment. “I’ll be around. I’m free today.”\n\nSunghoon’s hand twitched. He was still standing in front of Jay, almost awkwardly, his gaze somewhere at Jay’s slippered feet.\n\nJay wondered what was going through Sunghoon’s head. “Do… you want me to come with you?” he asked a bit hesitantly.\n\nSunghoon’s eyes snapped back to Jay’s, something ignited in his expression. “You must’ve lost your mind,” he announced. So that was a no. Jay had to willfully stop himself from rolling his eyes; he had just asked, just in case. “No, obviously. I’m leaving now.”\n\n“Alright,” Jay said, watching Sunghoon put on his sneakers in front of their apartment door. “I’ll see you. Text me?”\n\n“You can live without me for a couple of hours,” Sunghoon said, his hand on the door handle.\n\n“Or you can just text me,” Jay said.\n\n“You’re obsessed with me.”\n\n“I’m going back to sleep.”\n\nDespite his words, Jay watched until Sunghoon disappeared behind the door, giving him a little wave. He wasn’t sure if Sunghoon saw.\n\nHe stood by the front entrance for a few moments longer before trudging over to the kitchen to make himself some coffee.\n\nA few hours later, with Jay having done nothing particularly productive except for having lunch with Sunoo and practicing a few songs on the guitar in his room, Jay received a video call request from Sunghoon.\n\nHe accepted without hesitation, shuffling around to find his earphones. He looked back at the screen once he found them, concern flaring up the moment their manager’s face appeared instead of Sunghoon’s.\n\n“Hey, Jay,” the manager said. It seemed like he was sitting in the driver’s seat of the car. “I’m with Sunghoon right now.”\n\n“Did everything go alright?” Jay asked cautiously, almost being able to feel his heart pounding.\n\n“Yeah, everything’s fine,” the manager said candidly, making the vice grip in Jay’s chest loosen. As long as Sunghoon was fine. “We’re in the car, about to head back to the apartment. Sunghoon was just… looking for you?”\n\nJay blinked, something warm flooding his face. He hoped it wasn’t obvious to the manager. “Oh,” he said, suddenly conflicted if he should be embarrassed or ridiculously pleased at the statement. Sunghoon was looking for you. He was looking for me.\n\n“I think he wanted to call you, but he’s a little confused from the anesthesia. I’ll pass you to him now.”\n\nSunghoon came into frame with the moving phone, one hand gripping it as the other fumbled to put an Airpod in his ear. There was a gauze in his mouth and a blank look on his face, the kind he usually had whenever he zoned out.\n\nHe was so cute.\n\n“Hello,” Jay said sweetly. He wanted to giggle, but held back for the sake of Sunghoon and his dignity. If he was even aware of it at the moment.\n\n“Jjongssaeng,” Sunghoon mumbled, blinking slowly. “Someone took my teeth…”\n\n“They did,” Jay said, pressing his lips together so as not to laugh. “You shouldn’t be opening your mouth too much.”\n\n“Someone took my teeth,” Sunghoon insisted, his words a bit muffled by the gauze. He had lowered his phone so that it was mostly his upper body in frame, and Jay could only see a sliver of his face. “They took… Jay. Jjay-ah.”\n\nJay smiled, hopelessly endeared. “I’m here.”\n\nSunghoon fell into silence, and Jay was content to sit at his desk with his phone propped up, watching Sunghoon blankly sit in the passenger seat as fragments of the highway passed by in the small corner view Jay had of the car window.\n\nIt kind of reminded him of the time he and Sunghoon video called over a holiday break, when they were at their own family’s homes. It had been before they’d started dating, with Jay calling Sunghoon out of the blue with no real excuse other than a demand to see his dog. Sunghoon had surprisingly picked up and obliged, only for Gaeul to quickly lose interest and worm her way out of Sunghoon’s lap, leaving just the two of them on call together. Jay had assumed Sunghoon would hang up the moment Gaeul left, but Sunghoon stayed on, just silently sitting there, seeming unbothered by the lack of conversation between them.\n\nItching to break the silence, Jay had talked up a storm. Now, he could barely remember what he’d talked about, except that he just really wanted to make Sunghoon laugh.\n\nIt was a little different now, seeing how Sunghoon’s lack of words at the moment was not so much a willful silence but more of a situation where there were probably little to no thoughts going through Sunghoon’s head because of the anesthesia. But still, the same affection was surging through Jay—it was just that before, when he’d been in denial about how he felt about Sunghoon, he hadn’t known how to qualify such a feeling.\n\nNow, he knew. It was a privilege, he thought.\n\nSunghoon aimed the phone to his face again, and Jay took in his pixelated form, something warm in his chest at the sight. “Someone took my teeth,” Sunghoon repeated softly. “Give it back.”\n\nJay couldn’t help but giggle at Sunghoon’s obstinance. “I don’t have it, baby,” he said.\n\nSunghoon groaned weakly, like Jay’s words had genuinely disappointed him. “Jay took my teeth,” he said mournfully, his words still muffled by his gauze, maybe talking to their manager. “I don’t like… this cotton.”\n\n“Suddenly I’m the one who took your teeth?” Jay asked, grinning. He shouldn’t be teasing. Sunghoon was still coming off of some evidently powerful medical drugs, and wasn’t in the right mind to tease back. But it was so, so hard to resist when Sunghoon was so, so cute.\n\n“Where’d it go…” Sunghoon looked around, though his movements seemed a bit sluggish still. The view of Sunghoon on Jay’s phone was jostling around with the way Sunghoon was moving.\n\n“What are you looking for?” came the faint voice of the manager, distant. He was driving, after all.\n\n“Jay… No, not…” Sunghoon muttered, slumping into his seat and now remaining still.\n\n“I’m here,” Jay repeated with a small smile, amused that he was feeling a little forgotten despite being actively looked for. He wished he’d gone to the appointment with Sunghoon.\n\nSunghoon looked back at the phone, at Jay. “I have to go,” he mumbled, and then hung up the call without any further warning.\n\nA laugh escaped him as Jay looked down at the dark screen of his phone. He couldn’t even be annoyed at Sunghoon hanging up on him so suddenly, and wondered if Sunghoon would remember this incident later on when he was feeling more like himself.\n\nIt turned out they had been calling for not even fifteen minutes, as Jay noticed when he plugged his phone in to charge. Still, Sunghoon and the manager were probably arriving within the next half hour, so Jay busied himself with cleaning up his side of the room. It probably wasn’t up to Sunghoon’s cleanliness standards, but Jay couldn’t be too bothered with how far he got once he heard the keypad to the front door of their apartment beeping.\n\nJay came out of his room in time to see Sunghoon slowly enter the apartment on slightly unsteady legs, their manager right behind him.\n\n“Congratulations,” Jay said as he watched Sunghoon toe off his shoes at an almost sluggish pace, still neatly arranging them like he usually did. Sunghoon hadn’t acknowledged Jay at all yet, but that wasn’t entirely new to Jay even on a regular day. Jay also gave a half-bow to their manager. “And thank you for bringing him back.”\n\n“Of course,” their manager said, as Sunghoon made his way to the bathroom sink.\n\nTheir manager soon left them, leaving Jay with basic care instructions after Jay insisted upon it. He’d also told Jay that the anesthesia would likely wear off soon, and that Sunghoon had been instructed to take it easy throughout the rest of the day, if not sleep it off entirely.\n\n“Sunghoon should already know what he needs to do,” their manager said kindly before leaving. “He’s just a little loopy at the moment.”\n\nJay made sure Sunghoon got to his room to rest, a hand hovering over Sunghoon’s back even though that probably wasn’t all that necessary.\n\n“Are you comfortable?” Jay asked once Sunghoon was settled on his bed.\n\nSunghoon blinked at him, his eyes half-lidded. “Aren’t you coming in?” he asked, lifting the blanket that Jay had pulled over him. His talking was somewhat back to normal, now that his mouth wasn’t obscured by cotton anymore. But there was still something hazy about Sunghoon’s attention span, a lack of alertness in his eyes. He looked soft, unassuming. Cute, even.\n\nJay hesitated, caught a bit off guard by the question, not expecting Sunghoon to indirectly ask to cuddle so frankly. Clearly still loopy, then.\n\n“Come in,” Sunghoon insisted, somehow still stubborn despite how bleary he looked. “Jay-ah.”\n\nJay laughed a little, feeling an overwhelming fondness. “Whatever you want, baby,” he said teasingly, then almost froze as soon as the words left his mouth.\n\nBaby. Jay’s face felt warm. It had just slipped out so naturally as if he’d been calling Sunghoon that for ages.\n\nSunghoon would hate it. Or maybe not. Sometimes Sunghoon was unpredictable like that. Baby. Jay kind of liked how it sounded on his tongue. And besides, Sunghoon was hardly going to remember this anyway, so Jay let himself enjoy the moment.\n\nSunghoon’s eyes were already closed, like he was certain that Jay was going to climb in next to him without having to see it for himself.\n\n“Sunghoon?” Jay asked, draping the blanket over the both of them. Sunghoon didn’t stir, so Jay felt a little bolder. “Baby?” he said, just to test the waters.\n\nSunghoon looked peaceful sleeping.\n\nJay stayed beside Sunghoon until Sunghoon’s breathing evened out before heading back to his own room.\n\nIt was all fine until Jay woke up the next day and was informed, along with the rest of the members, that Sunghoon would not be joining them for the day’s schedules.\n\n“How come?” Jake piped up, voicing Jay’s internal concern.\n\n“He has a fever,” Jungwon said. Judging by his sympathetic expression, it didn’t seem like anything too serious, but it was worrying nonetheless. “Apparently it happens sometimes, after wisdom teeth removal.”\n\nThere wasn’t anything too major Sunghoon would be missing out on—mainly a long day of dance practice, but still unfortunate either way.\n\nJay checked on Sunghoon before they had to leave, stepping quietly into the room to see a still-sleeping Sunghoon. He was almost paler than usual, a concerning feat considering how pale Sunghoon normally was. Jay leaned down to press his lips against Sunghoon’s unnaturally warm forehead to get a temperature check. Definitely a fever.\n\nDespite Jungwon assuring everyone that one of their managers was coming over to keep watch over Sunghoon while they were all away, Jay still couldn't chase away the itch of worry that restlessly wormed its way under his skin throughout the rest of the day.\n\nDancing helped, though, clearing his mind as he lent his body to the beat hour after hour. But every time they were dismissed for a short water break, Jay’s mind wandered back to Sunghoon, knowing that he was at the apartment with a fever, alone.\n\nBeing sick was nothing new to any of them, especially considering how fast a cold got passed around the seven of them living in such close quarters with each other. Hell, Jake had an on-and-off cold sore for the better part of an entire year. Still, it bothered Jay that Sunghoon was alone. With a manager, of course, but… Sunghoon had spent so many years of his childhood on the ice alone, making him no stranger to being on his own. Jay just wanted to make sure that Sunghoon never had to be alone, especially when he was sick or vulnerable.\n\nJungwon slid down next to him against the wall of the practice room, handing him a water bottle that Jay gratefully accepted. “Should we call him?” he asked, a troubled look on his face. “To check on how he’s doing?”\n\nSuddenly, Jay felt a little transparent, like Jungwon was seeing right through him. There was probably a reason why Jungwon was coming to ask him this instead of anyone else. “I don’t want to wake him in case he’s sleeping,” Jay said quickly.\n\nHe didn't know where this self-consciousness was coming from. It was natural to be worried about a fellow member. Ni-ki had brought up Sunghoon several times as they’d run through their choreography during segments when he’d normally have a pair dance part with Sunghoon, wondering out loud if Sunghoon was doing alright.\n\nJungwon nodded in acknowledgement. “Well, the manager texted,” he said. “Apparently some of the fever’s gone down. And some swelling in the face, but nothing serious.” He glanced sideways at Jay, biting his lip. “I hope he’s feeling okay.”\n\nJay took a sip of his water. Logically, he knew it was just a fever. It wasn’t like Sunghoon never had a fever before, and Jay wanted to alleviate any anxieties that may be swirling through Jungwon’s head, considering how Jungwon had enough on his plate. “Sunghoon’s tough,” Jay said, knowing it to be true. “He’ll be fine.”\n\nTheir break time was coming to a close. Jungwon just nodded again, solemn, patting Jay’s shoulder before returning to the center of the room. Jay set his bottle down, a weird feeling settling in his chest, like he was the one who’d been comforted instead of the other way around.\n\nHe got up to join everyone else.\n\nTwo hours later, Jungwon called for an end to their practice. He’d cut it a bit shorter than expected.\n\n“Since Sunghoon hyung isn’t here,” Jungwon explained. “It’d be better to coordinate the finer details with the choreo with him here anyway.”\n\nUpon their return to their apartment, Jay headed straight to Sunghoon’s room.\n\nThe room was dark, the curtains half-drawn. Sunghoon was no longer sleeping, sitting up in his bed and staring vacantly at some blank point in the wall across from him. He barely acknowledged Jay’s presence when he came in, but his head tilted toward him when he came beside Sunghoon’s bed.\n\n“How are you feeling?” Jay asked, reaching out to cradle a side of Sunghoon’s face.\n\n“Fine,” Sunghoon said, clearing his voice after his voice came out roughly. His skin was still concerningly warm under Jay’s hand, but that could be because he’d been in bed all day.\n\n“Tell me,” Jay said quietly.\n\nSunghoon tilted his head into Jay’s touch, Jay’s hand more cool than Sunghoon’s skin. “Headache,” he finally admitted.\n\n“Do you want me to get you any medicine?”\n\n“Already took some.”\n\nIt was like the anxious feeling that had itching under Jay’s skin the whole day was coming back in full force, even though Sunghoon was in front of him.\n\nAs if sensing Jay’s uneasiness, Sunghoon wrapped his fingers around Jay’s wrist. “I’ll be okay,” Sunghoon said. “It’s just a fever. Apparently it sometimes happens after procedures like this.”\n\n“It’s not supposed to be like this, though,” Jay said, feeling the frown on his face as he dropped his hand. Sunghoon’s words were barely assuaging his concerns. “Your face is still a bit swollen.”\n\nSunghoon grimaced. “I don’t like anyone seeing me like this.”\n\nSomething in Jay’s chest clenched. “That’s not what I meant,” Jay said, a bit disheartened that that was where Sunghoon’s mind immediately went. “You know you’re beautiful.”\n\n“I’ll throw up,” Sunghoon said flatly, the way he did whenever he wanted to deflect a compliment.\n\n“Don’t joke like that right now,” Jay said, then paused fearfully. “Unless you actually need to throw u—”\n\n“Shut up, Jay. I’m fine.”\n\n“I’m going to get you a cold wet cloth for your head.”\n\n“I’m fine.”\n\n“Let me take care of you,” Jay insisted, standing up, only for Sunghoon to catch his hand.\n\nWhen Jay looked down, Sunghoon was already looking at him with wide, betrayed eyes. “Don’t leave me,” Sunghoon said, his voice almost teetering on sounding upset, still tightly holding onto Jay’s hand. “Why are you trying to leave me.”\n\nJay was taken aback by Sunghoon’s unexpected reaction. It was unlike him, but Sunghoon was generally unlike himself at the moment, like how his typically bright eyes were dull from his fever. “I’d come back,” Jay said, though he’d already made the decision in his head to stay. He sat back down, trying to disentangle his hand from Sunghoon’s grip to feel Sunghoon’s forehead, and then gave up and used his other hand when Sunghoon refused to let go. Sunghoon was still warm, the last of the fever refusing to loosen its grip. “But yeah, I’ll stay,” Jay said.\n\n“Stay until I fall asleep,” Sunghoon ordered, though his tone lacked any real, authoritative strength.\n\n“Then you should at least start by lying down,” Jay said, beginning to help Sunghoon adjust his pillows and blankets that were in disarray.\n\nIt was strange, this version of Sunghoon, reserved but in a different way than he usually was. There was something caustically honest about him, whether it was an effect from the remnants of his fever or the medicine in his system, and Jay felt a little off-kilter seeing him like this.\n\nSunghoon fell asleep almost startlingly quickly, out like a light nearly the moment his head hit the pillow. Jay stroked Sunghoon’s hair, taking in everything the dim lighting in the room offered him of Sunghoon. His dark eyebrows, long eyelashes, his soft lips… Jay had always thought every part of Sunghoon was beautiful, even in his sleep.\n\nThe door to the room cracked open, Jungwon poking his head through. “Is Sunghoonie hyung sleeping?” he asked in a whisper.\n\nJay got up from the bed carefully. “Yeah,” he said quietly. He wished he could stay, but the quad bedroom was crowded enough as it was, and he didn’t have many viable excuses to remain by Sunghoon’s side.\n\n“I’ll keep an eye on him,” Jungwon promised as he made room for Jay to pass through the door.\n\n“I know,” Jay said warmly. “Thank you. I know everyone else is worried too.”\n\n“Yeah,” Jungwon said, pursing his lips for a moment. “We all are. But the managers said he’ll be fine soon enough. You just seemed… particularly worried today.”\n\nJay felt himself straighten. Maybe he'd overdone it with the hovering and worrying, but Sunghoon had been plaguing his mind all day, a lingering desperation to be in front of him so Jay could make sure he was okay. He was sure everyone else felt a similar way. “It’s Sunghoon, you know?” was all that Jay could offer.\n\nJungwon nodded. “I get it,” he said sagely. “You’re a good member, you know that, Jay hyung? We need you.”\n\n“And you’re a good leader,” Jay parried, a deep appreciation for the young leader bubbling up inside of him.\n\n“Ayy,” Jungwon said, clapping Jay’s shoulder. “Sleep well, okay, hyung?”\n\nJay saluted him before heading to his own room to retire for the night.\n\nIt was a testament to Sunghoon’s immune system the way Jay had been worrying about Sunghoon up until the moment he fell asleep that night, only to wake up the next morning and see Sunghoon already at the kitchen table with Jake and Jungwon, laughing at something they said as he held a spoonful of gyeranjjim.\n\n“Feeling better?” Jay asked, directing the question to Sunghoon, shuffling in and zeroing in on the coffee machine. There was some coffee in there, thank god.\n\n“Perfect,” Sunghoon replied in English. Puh-pec-teu. He really was feeling better, then.\n\n“Your mouth doesn’t hurt?”\n\n“Don’t be stupid, of course my mouth hurts,” Sunghoon snarked. Jake barked out a laugh from beside him. Wow, thanks for the camaraderie, roomie. “But that has nothing to do with being able to perform.”\n\nIt was so like Sunghoon to push forward and to continue working hard even after going through something that rightfully earned him a little break.\n\n“But the managers also said he needed to spend one more day in recovery,” Jake said, filling Jay in. “Especially since he just got out of a fever.”\n\nJungwon started humming “Fever” under his breath.\n\n“I’ll be back soon. Tomorrow,” Sunghoon said, sounding a little wistful. “I’ll be missing the fancall event today.”\n\n“It might be for the best,” Jake said solemnly. “Enjoy your break while you can.”\n\n“Like a fever, fever, fever…”\n\nSunghoon cast a judgy sideways look at Jungwon, looking like he wanted to say something, but ultimately didn’t, taking a bite of his steamed eggs instead.\n\nJay stifled a laugh.\n\nAfter their schedules ended that night, Sunghoon wandered into Jay’s room, squinting at his phone. “Did I call you after I got out of surgery?” he asked, holding up his phone to show Jay the list of outgoing calls on his screen.\n\nJay pressed his lips together so as not to smile too widely at the memory. “Mhm,” he said casually.\n\nSunghoon’s face became mildly horrified at Jay’s response, like he’d been hoping Jay would say otherwise. “What did I… did I say anything?” he said, almost like he was afraid to ask.\n\n“I’ll never tell,” Jay said with a smirk as Sunghoon frowned, taking advantage of the fact that he rarely had the opportunity to make fun Sunghoon. “What if I said that you told me that you loved me,” Jay teased, “and that you wanted me so bad—”\n\nSunghoon aimed to kick his slipper in Jay’s general direction.\n\n“You didn’t say much!” Jay exclaimed, immediately cowering. Knowing Sunghoon, he would really do it, and Jay had survival instincts, after all. Jay peeked out from between his raised arms covering his face. “You were just cute, okay?”\n\n“Erase all of it from your memory,” Sunghoon demanded, pointing at him accusingly, like it was somehow Jay’s fault that Sunghoon had called him after his wisdom teeth surgery.\n\n“Yes, of course,” Jay said dutifully. He was lying, but whatever. “Forgotten. Nada. Zip.”\n\nSunghoon whirled around and left the room.\n\nDamn. So Sunghoon really was feeling better. Jay felt like he could’ve maybe wheedled a kiss out of Sunghoon in that moment if he’d played his cards a little better, but oh well. There was always next time.\n\nA little under a month slipped by since Sunghoon recovered.\n\nThey were all swamped with so many miscellaneous schedules that Jay barely had a time to take a breather, much less think about spending actual quality time with Sunghoon. They somehow made things work, though, whether it was sitting next to each other at a restaurant group dinner or brushing their teeth side by side in the bathroom, trying to find pockets of time where they could be in each other’s proximity, even if it wasn’t the kind of time together they really wanted.\n\n“I’m sleeping in Heeseung’s room tonight,” Jake announced as he entered their room, making Jay look up from his phone.\n\nIt was late Friday evening, and they’d just gotten notice that they’d received Saturday off. A rare break, so the dorm was in high spirits.\n\n“How come?” Jay asked, feeling his brows furrow. “His room is, like, barely a couple meters down the hall from ours.”\n\n“Him, me, and Ni-ki are planning to play FIFA until we pass out,” Jake said simply, picking up his pillow from his bed. “We got the blankets and pillows ready and everything. Sleepover.”\n\n“And I’m not invited?” Jay asked, only jokingly offended. These gatherings were usually always open to everyone. Besides, even if he’d been explicitly invited, he would’ve politely declined—tonight felt like a quiet kind of night, not a gaming one.\n\nJake shrugged. “Obviously you can come. I was just letting you know that you have the room to yourself tonight, if you want.”\n\nThat got Jay’s attention. “Oh,” Jay said, nodding. He set his phone down beside him on his bed. “Okay, cool.”\n\n“You okay, dude?” Jake asked, tilting his head.\n\nJay was playing it cool. Or maybe not, based on Jake’s sudden concern. But what would Jake know? “Yeah, no, I’m good,” Jay said. He smiled at Jake. “Thanks for letting me know, man.”\n\n“Right. Any time,” Jake said, patting their door frame once as he left with his pillow, presumably to Heeseung’s room.\n\nIt was only until Jake’s footsteps faded away that Jay realized how much Jake’s presence took up their shared room. Despite Jay having no problems with being alone—he spent enough time with all the members as it was, although it wasn’t that Jay ever got sick of them—it was an odd feeling to be suddenly so aware that he had the room to himself.\n\nNot that he’d have it to himself for long, though. Jay had an idea, one that had occurred to him the moment Jake mentioned it. An idea that involved inviting Sunghoon over, a rare opportunity for a casual date night sort of thing.\n\nJay passed by the living room on the way to Sunghoon’s room, seeing Jungwon and Sunoo curled up on the couch together, both of them giggling at something on Jungwon’s phone. They paid no mind to Jay, who strided up to the bedroom’s closed door and loudly knocked a few times before cracking the door open.\n\nThe room was dimly lit by only a lamp, with Sunghoon sitting on his bed. He was turned towards Jay, the glow from his phone screen making his facial features seem unusually softer than usual.\n\n“Oh, it’s Jay!” Sunghoon said. He waved his phone at Jay, showing him that he was doing a voice live. Right, Jay had seen Sunghoon’s message in the group chat twenty minutes ago and had promptly forgotten about it. It wasn’t a big deal. Their fans usually liked it when another member unexpectedly featured in an otherwise solo livestream.\n\nJay leaned against the doorway, crossing his arms. “Want some ramyeon?”\n\n“What?”\n\nJay watched Sunghoon flip up the hood of his white hoodie, as if Jay had never seen his messy hair before. It was cute. “I’m making ramyeon. Want some?” Jay asked, his voice pitching lower than it normally did. Maybe it was the moody lighting that had him speaking more quietly.\n\nSunghoon blinked slowly. “Yes,” he said, looking down at his phone.\n\nJay nodded, feeling a smile creep over his face. Just a side effect of seeing Sunghoon, it seemed. As he started to leave, he heard Sunghoon’s voice say, “I have to go. Jay’s making me ramyeon,” to begin wrapping up his livestream, and felt his smile widen.\n\nJay had almost finished stirring the instant ramyeon to completion when Sunghoon padded into the kitchen. Jay had offered some to Sunoo and Jungwon who had still been in the living room, but Jungwon said he was going to bed soon and Sunoo said he wasn’t in the mood, both disappearing into their room shortly afterward.\n\n“What was that?” Sunghoon demanded.\n\nJay shooed Sunghoon aside as he carried the pot to their dining table, setting an oven mitt underneath it. “What was what?” Jay asked, opening a cabinet and pulling out two bowls. He handed one to Sunghoon, who accepted it and sat down.\n\n“Your voice. While I was doing my live. It was your flirty voice,” Sunghoon said with a haughty sniff, moving some of the noodles into his bowl. “It’s late, and ramyeon… There are implications, Jay. Fans with overactive imaginations.”\n\nJay laughed. “Are you thinking naughty things right now? I did literally mean ramyeon,” he said, picking up his chopsticks to start eating as well.\n\n“Don’t be stupid. I’m just telling you what it sounded like.”\n\n“You ended your live pretty quick for someone who was so concerned about the implications.”\n\n“Yeah, because noodles get mushy if you leave them for too long,” Sunghoon said. Duh, was unsaid but clearly heard from his tone.\n\nJay finished chewing before he spoke again. “So, Jake said he’s sleeping in Heeseung’s room tonight. Game night, or whatever.”\n\nSunghoon’s chopsticks clattered against his bowl. “So I was right,” he sighed. “Late night invitation. Ramyeon and chill. I see right through you.”\n\n“Sunghoon-ah, can you stop acting like me trying to spend time you is some kind of nefarious scheme?” Jay said exasperatedly, knowing Sunghoon was teasing him. He really had no specific plans in mind, content to let Sunghoon set the tone and pace of whatever he wanted to do. “You literally told me the other day that you missed us having one-on-one time together.”\n\n“Don’t put words in my mouth,” Sunghoon said, surly. “Although I did say that.”\n\nJay let out a laugh at Sunghoon’s expression. “Come on, let’s eat.”\n\nThey finished eating in relative silence, with Jay accidentally nudging Sunghoon’s foot under the table at one point and then promptly falling into something that was less lovey-dovey footsie and more like a competitive version of attacking each other’s shins short of directly kicking each other.\n\n“Okay, I’m sorry!” Jay exclaimed as Sunghoon giggled. “You don’t need to actually stomp on my feet. Are you done eating?”\n\nSunghoon kindly offered to clean up since Jay had made the ramyeon, urging him to wash up first and that he’d join him soon.\n\nAfter his shower, Jay ended up in his room, scrolling on his phone with his damp towel still around his neck. Shortly after he heard the water stop running in the bathroom, his bedroom door opened, revealing Sunghoon wearing comfortable sweats and an oversized t-shirt with blow-dried hair.\n\n“So no Jake,” Sunghoon remarked.\n\nJay stood up, tossing his towel into the hamper before he took Sunghoon’s hand to bring him into the room, closing the door behind him.\n\n“Nope. I’m all yours,” Jay said as he cupped Sunghoon’s face with his hands, kind of just wanting an excuse to stare at him. He brushed a thumb over Sunghoon’s cheekbone as he looked into his eyes, feeling Sunghoon’s face heat up under his palms.\n\nSunghoon pulled away from Jay, feigning sudden disinterest as he moved to sit on Jay’s bed. “We haven’t watched a movie together in a while. Let’s watch one,” he said, and Jay was happy to go along with his wishes.\n\nBut as it was, they barely made it twenty minutes into the movie—a mindless action movie that Jay had no real interest in—before Jay could start to feel Sunghoon stealing glances at him.\n\nJay didn’t need to look to know it was happening; Sunghoon wasn’t being particularly subtle. He thought about ignoring him just to see Sunghoon huff and passive aggressively complain, but the simmering desperation to actually kiss Sunghoon overtook any urge to tease him.\n\nShifting the laptop on his lap further away, Jay turned his whole body toward Sunghoon, pressing his chin against Sunghoon’s shoulder. “Hi,” he said, a delicate whisper into Sunghoon’s ear.\n\n“Are you bored?” Sunghoon asked, looking down at him and raising an eyebrow. Like he hadn’t been staring at Jay a second ago. “You picked the movie, you know.”\n\nJay blew into Sunghoon’s ear, laughing softly at the way Sunghoon slightly flinched at the unexpected sensation. Jay could watch Sunghoon for hours. “You’re just far more interesting,” Jay said.\n\n“You’re so lame,” Sunghoon said, finally meeting Jay’s gaze. His brown eyes were dark, pretty. Jay knew this look. He couldn’t forget it if he tried.\n\n“Mm, whatever,” Jay managed to say before Sunghoon leaned in and pressed his lips to Jay’s.\n\nThe movie and the laptop were quickly forgotten as they kissed, Jay pulling Sunghoon closer and tilting his head as the kiss rapidly deepened. Sunghoon’s hands grasped around the shirt fabric by Jay’s waist, his dark eyelashes fanning prettily under his closed eyes.\n\nJay could’ve kept going, wanted it, but he soon felt his laptop digging into his leg a few minutes into the kiss, registering the sounds of the movie still playing in the background. He broke away first, giving Sunghoon a sheepish smile as he closed the laptop shut, leaning up to set it on his desk.\n\n“You said it wasn’t that kind of night,” Sunghoon said, a playful look in his eye as Jay turned back to look at him.\n\n“I didn’t say that. I just wanted to spend time with you,” Jay said, coming back closer to Sunghoon. “You were the one who kicked up a whole fuss about it.” Jay hovered over him on his knees, relishing in the rapt attention Sunghoon was giving him. “Why? Wanna do something else?”\n\nJay knew that it couldn’t be farther from what Sunghoon wanted. Sunghoon was already looking at him with a kind of heated look like he wanted to eat Jay whole, and it was driving Jay crazy.\n\nWith little preamble, Jay started kissing down Sunghoon’s neck, letting his hands wander around Sunghoon’s body, savoring every little reaction he was pulling out of him.\n\n“Well, it’d be a waste not to—” Sunghoon gasped as Jay’s hand brushed against his lap, his hand in Jay’s hair twisting and sending a pleasant spark through Jay.\n\n“Not to…?” Jay prompted with a grin, knowing that he was being obnoxious. He loved how particularly reactive Sunghoon was tonight—probably because they hadn’t properly done anything together in a while.\n\n“Don’t tease me,” Sunghoon ground out. He hauled Jay in for another kiss, and Jay allowed himself to be pulled closer, sliding a knee between Sunghoon’s legs as their lips slotted together. This time, Jay purposefully pressed against Sunghoon’s length, rewarded with a moan tumbling out of Sunghoon’s mouth that went straight to his own dick.\n\n“You’re so sensitive,” Jay said, leaning back to look at Sunghoon in almost wonder, whose breath was coming uneven, his hair in disarray. They’d barely done anything and they were both already hard. Had it really been that long since they’d last gotten each other off?\n\n“Get on with it,” Sunghoon said, his hand clenching at the sheets underneath him.\n\nSunghoon was always so bossy. Jay liked it, but he also liked it when Sunghoon got a little desperate. They had time, after all.\n\nThe words left his mouth before he could even think about it. “Beg for it,” Jay said, then flushed at his own boldness.\n\nSunghoon gaped at him. “Wh—what?”\n\n“You want it, right?” Jay asked. He had to keep going. Sunghoon’s cheeks were ruddy, a slightly dazed look already in his eyes. It was so attractive it made Jay feel dizzy, hot all over. Jay pressed his thumb against Sunghoon’s lower lip. “Tell me what you want.”\n\nJay could see Sunghoon considering it, battling the conflicting urges on whether to fight back like he instinctively wanted to, or to go along with Jay. Jay waited, only because he knew that in situations like these, Sunghoon often folded easily.\n\n“Jay…” Sunghoon’s voice veered on a whine, his hips twitching, like he was trying to chase the pressure Jay’s knee previously had on him. “Please…”\n\n“Please what?” Jay asked, not relenting. He moved toward him again, feeling Sunghoon start to grind against him. “You want it like this, on my leg? Or what, you want me to suck you off?”\n\nIt was a heady feeling, to have Sunghoon like this. Minutes seemed to slip by, lost to the little noises intermittently leaving Sunghoon’s mouth, but Jay didn’t mind. He could be patient.\n\n“Jay,” Sunghoon whimpered, his hips bucking as Jay laid his palm flat against Sunghoon’s hard-on over his sweats.\n\n“Use your words,” Jay said, his voice coming surprisingly steadier than he felt. The world could be ending outside his window right now and Jay still wouldn’t be able to take his eyes off of Sunghoon.\n\nSunghoon squeezed his eyes shut, breathing shaky. “Want you to fuck me,” he breathed out. “Please.”\n\nJay had known it was coming, but actually hearing it come out of Sunghoon’s mouth made something hot wash over him, a muted buzz of excitement coursing through his veins.\n\n“Okay. Okay, baby, I got you,” Jay murmured, dragging his hand against Sunghoon’s length just one more time—only for Sunghoon to arch into his touch, suddenly coming with a loud moan, nearly trembling with his eyes still shut.\n\nJay froze, blood rushing in his ears as he processed what just happened.\n\nSunghoon blinked out of his daze. “Oh my god,” he said faintly, his hands coming up to cover his face.\n\nJay snapped into motion once he realized that Sunghoon seemed mortified. He pulled Sunghoon’s hands away from his face, smiling even though Sunghoon was avoiding his eyes. “Don’t hide. That was hot,” Jay reassured him heatedly, lacing his fingers with Sunghoon’s. His own arousal still thrumming underneath his skin in anticipation, both for what was to come for himself, and for how much more he could wrangle out of Sunghoon.\n\n“I’m all sticky,” Sunghoon complained, his face reddened with embarrassment now. “You know I don’t like that.”\n\nJay laughed, leaning in to press a kiss to Sunghoon’s lips, then a quick one on his cheek. “You know you can borrow anything from my closet,” he said.\n\nSunghoon’s cheeks were flushed, but he still met Jay’s gaze straight on. “Or…” Sunghoon said slowly in consideration, “I can keep going. If you’re up for that.”\n\nHeat washed over Jay once again as he understood what Sunghoon was saying. “I like the way you think,” he said, watching Sunghoon bite his lip. It dimly occurred to Jay that he wanted to be the one biting Sunghoon’s lip instead, but the thought soon evaporated as Sunghoon put his hands on Jay’s shoulders.\n\n“Of course you do,” Sunghoon said with a glint in his eye, before pushing him down onto the bed to kiss him.\n\n“Three times is a record,” Jay noted, trying not to sound too pleased. He felt like he deserved to feel a bit proud, though.\n\n“Shut up, Jay.”\n\n“Twice in thirty minutes…”\n\n“You were counting?” Sunghoon demanded. He was wearing a fresh set of clothes he’d pulled out of Jay’s wardrobe, laying on new sheets that Jay had fitted over his bed while Sunghoon was in the bathroom.\n\n“What do you mean? I couldn’t help but remember,” Jay said, sitting on the bed beside Sunghoon and pretending like he didn’t see Sunghoon roll his eyes. “How could I forget when you look so pretty when you—”\n\n“Yeah, yeah,” Sunghoon grumbled. “You’re so weird.”\n\n“Suck my dick.”\n\n“That doesn’t work on someone who already did, you loser.” Sunghoon reached out a hand to Jay, and Jay complied to his silent request, laying down next to him.\n\n“This was really nice,” Jay said softly, inching closer so he could bump his nose against Sunghoon’s.\n\nThere was an exhaustion he could feel deep in his bones, but it was the kind that felt good. The edges of sleepiness were beginning to creep in, as he was certain was particularly true for Sunghoon, but he liked to talk with Sunghoon afterwards, like they always did.\n\n“Imagine there had been dance practice tomorrow,” Sunghoon said, his finger tracing a small, squiggly shape over and over on Jay’s cheekbone. Jay belatedly realized that it was a heart. “I would’ve made you take full responsibility for my condition.”\n\nJay snorted. “You walked just fine to the bathroom and back just now.”\n\nHe had watched Sunghoon pull his oversized shirt on and get up—a brief lick of arousal shooting down his spine at how boneless and fucked out Sunghoon looked before getting up even though he knew he couldn’t go again—and had immediately stepped forward to help when Sunghoon winced, only for Sunghoon to slap his outstretched arms away.\n\n“With great effort,” Sunghoon sighed, pulling away and turning to look at the ceiling instead.\n\n“I could’ve carried you to the bathroom,” Jay said. He would’ve drawn a bath for Sunghoon, but Sunghoon had insisted on getting to bed sooner. (“I’m not taking a bath right now. At this hour? Please be reasonable, Jay.”)\n\n“I would’ve killed you.”\n\nIt was now late into the night. They were undoubtedly the only two who were awake in the dorm.\n\nJay poked Sunghoon’s cheek, and Sunghoon turned his head to look at him again. Sunghoon’s face was soft, maybe a little sleepy, with none of the challenging energy he usually carried in his eyes.\n\nIn that moment, Jay felt it deep inside somewhere in his ribcage with a swelling, absolute certainty that he utterly and wholly belonged to Sunghoon. It was an overwhelming feeling, the way it was every time it came over him, hitting him unexpectedly in waves.\n\n“Hey,” Jay said softly. He poked Sunghoon’s cheek again, this time not to get his attention, but just because, smiling at how Sunghoon frowned as he tried to tilt his head away.\n\n“What?” Sunghoon said.\n\nJay trailed his finger across the moles on Sunghoon’s face, trying to connect them like constellations. He’s never had a particular interest in stars before, but Sunghoon made him wonder about them sometimes. Sunghoon made him think about a lot of things.\n\n“I love you,” Jay said. A confession, one he’s made a million times before.\n\nSunghoon laughed, a light thing, the kind that made his eyes crinkle. “You’re crazy,” he said, pushing at Jay’s face with the palm of his hand.\n\nIt wasn’t like Sunghoon had never said it back before, but he reacted similarly every time, the way he’d just done, eyes sparkling and playful.\n\n“Come on,” Jay whined.\n\n“What?” Sunghoon said. Like he didn’t know.\n\n“Sunghoon-ah,” Jay said, hearing the sulk in his own voice. When Sunghoon made no signs of saying more, Jay petulantly crossed his arms and rolled to his side to turn his back on Sunghoon, mostly for show. Sunghoon often kept his words close to his chest, and maybe he didn’t even realize how much he did, but Jay had just felt like trying his luck.\n\n“Ah, Jay-ah~” Sunghoon drew his name out, lifting himself up on his elbows to hover over Jay. His face loomed over Jay’s, though Jay pretended not to see.\n\nJay almost flinched in surprise as Sunghoon dropped a kiss on his cheek. Then another. Then another, and another, with Sunghoon tipping Jay back onto his back and peppering kisses all over his face until Jay couldn’t hold back the wide smile taking over his face.\n\n“Okay, okay!” Jay said, giggling as he covered his face.\n\n“Jay-ah,” Sunghoon said, his eyes soft. His eyes had always been startlingly expressive.\n\nJay reached up to brush a strand of Sunghoon’s bangs away from his eyes, a careful touch. He wanted to be careful with Sunghoon.\n\nSunghoon settled back down onto the bed, shifting down a little so he could bury his head into the crook of Jay’s neck. His soft hair tickled Jay’s chin, Jay’s hand coming up to thread his fingers through Sunghoon’s hair on instinct as Sunghoon pressed himself closer.\n\nA comfortable silence stretched over them, across the dimness of the room.\n\nThen: “I like it here,” Sunghoon said quietly, maybe a confession of his own. Jay felt Sunghoon’s slow breaths against his collarbone. “I like it a lot.”\n\nThings that Jay called Sunghoon:\n\n“Sunghoon-ah…” (usually disappointed)\n\n“Yah!”\n\n“Baby” (NEW) (+1)\n\nIt was like Jay couldn’t stop once he started, like he’d gotten a taste of something addicting and couldn’t put it down anymore.\n\nThe pet name had slipped out once again when Jay had been swept up in his lust-addled state, but it seemed like Sunghoon hadn’t even noticed, so basically it was an if a tree fell and no one heard it situation where it was almost as if Jay hadn’t said it at all. Technically.\n\nBut then Jay opened his big dumb mouth again.\n\nSunghoon had begun to doze off on their way back from a magazine photoshoot and interview, using Jay’s shoulder as a pillow until a harsh bump on the road jerked him awake, stiffening as he seemed to realize that he’d been leaning against Jay.\n\n“It’s okay,” Jay said quietly. It was only Heeseung and Ni-ki in the car with them, both of them sitting in the seats in front of them.\n\n“Don’t tell me what to do,” Sunghoon mumbled before closing his eyes again. It was so rare to see Sunghoon sleeping anywhere but on his bed, especially when it was usually Jay who fell asleep anytime and anywhere, so Jay decided to leave him be. And maybe take a picture or two, just as a private keepsake.\n\nThey finally reached their dorm after a short while, and Heeseung and Ni-ki got off the car first, Heeseung stepping forward again to move the seat so that Jay and Sunghoon could exit as well.\n\n“Hey,” Jay said, shaking Sunghoon gently. “Come on, baby, we’re home.”\n\nSunghoon stirred, blinking himself awake, and Jay flushed as he realized what he’d called him in front of both Heeseung and Ni-ki.\n\nJay’s eyes almost involuntarily flicked up to meet Heeseung’s, and then immediately tried to forget the mildly amused look he saw on Heeseung’s face. Whatever. Whatever, Jay thought to himself furiously. It wasn’t that weird.\n\n“You guys are so weird,” Ni-ki commented off-handedly. “Come on, Sunghoonie hyung, let’s go!”\n\nSunghoon gazed at Jay for a moment, a curious look in his eyes that made Jay’s insides feel a little weird.\n\n“Let’s go,” Jay said lamely. “Sunghoon,” he tacked on, even more lamely. He wanted the earth to swallow him up whole at that point, and thanked whatever divine forces that kept Sunghoon from commenting on his awkwardness.\n\nJay kept some distance apart from Sunghoon as they entered their apartment building, in case he called him any extraneous pet names again, or did something equally crazy like accidentally proposing to him or something.\n\nIt really wasn’t that he had anything inherently against calling Sunghoon baby. At this point, the way it was falling out of his mouth left and right, it couldn’t be clearer that somewhere in his subconscious he enjoyed calling him that nickname.\n\nNo, it wasn’t a Jay thing, but rather an idle wariness of what would happen to Jay once Sunghoon properly caught onto what Jay was calling him. Sunghoon was smart. He’d realize that these incidents were often a slip of the tongue, that Jay didn’t purposefully mean to, which could only mean that somewhere deep down for Jay, Sunghoon was someone that Jay was genuinely, instinctively calling baby.\n\nUgh, PUKE! Tomato, tomato, and boos from everyone and everywhere around him. Jay could only imagine Sunghoon’s tantrum.\n\nBaby. It wasn’t in the same way Jay viewed the younger members of the group, the way he doted on Ni-ki, or Jungwon and Sunoo. There was something else about how he felt about Sunghoon, a loose collection of feelings from seeing his softness coexisting his constant endeavors at making fun of Jay, from tracing the downturned, puppy-like edges of his eyes and watching his lashes flutter, from hearing the timber of his voice lilt up and down when he animatedly spoke to the members.\n\nSunghoon was independent and self-sufficient almost to a fault, both humble and hard-working as he gracefully walked through life with his head held high. Jay just wanted to be able to catch him, if he ever stumbled. Jay liked being the one to bring Sunghoon out of his head, to be able to reach through to his spikes and hold him, only to realize that maybe the spikes were never really there at all.\n\nThere was something constant about Sunghoon, a familiarity to his rhythm despite his occasional antics and spats with Jay, and the safety and stability Sunghoon offered meant more to Jay than he’d ever imagined it could, especially with the line of work they were in.\n\nJay wanted to show it back to him, how protected he felt even from just the warmth of Sunghoon’s shoulders pressed against his. He wanted Sunghoon to know.\n\n“Whoa, slow down,” Jay said with a laugh, his hands coming to hold Sunghoon’s waist to steady him as Sunghoon settled over his lap, his knees bracketing Jay’s legs. “Weren’t you tired earlier?”\n\n“I slept a little in the car,” Sunghoon said simply, pressing a kiss to Jay’s lips as he looped his arms around Jay’s neck, weirdly affectionate.\n\n“Did you want to take a proper nap?” Jay asked, looking up at him. He knew that Sunghoon had a long day of schedules yesterday, and had a packed morning even before their magazine interview today.\n\n“Mmm, no,” Sunghoon said, dipping his head to nose at Jay’s neck, dropping a kiss there too.\n\nJay squirmed a little at the contact. “Well, then did you want something to ea—”\n\n“Jay,” Sunghoon interrupted, lifting his head as he trailed his hands from Jay’s nape to hold his shoulders instead. “I kind of just want to kiss you. Is that okay?”\n\n“N-no,” Jay stuttered out, suddenly flustered by Sunghoon’s forwardness. This was not a common occurrence, not at all. “I mean. Yes. Yes, sounds good. Um. Kiss away.”\n\nSunghoon stilled in his motions, squinting at him. If Sunghoon processed that for any longer, it would be another thing he could taunt Jay with.\n\n“Just,” Jay said, feeling his face redden. Willing the heat on his face to die down, he pulled Sunghoon down to kiss him instead.\n\nFrom there, it was easy to get lost in the moment, in the softness of Sunghoon’s lips and the slide of their lips slotting together, with Sunghoon’s hands wandering up to Jay’s hair after a few minutes as Jay’s dropped to Sunghoon’s hips.\n\nAt a certain point, Jay was contemplating if he should slide a hand under Sunghoon’s shirt when Sunghoon unexpectedly ground down a little, punching a gasp out of Jay.\n\n“What are you doing?” Jay asked tensely, tightening his grip on Sunghoon’s hips. What had felt like a hazy few minutes could’ve actually been a half an hour for all he knew, with how making out between the two of them often tended to go, but Sunghoon’s little move had made every nerve in Jay’s body suddenly alert.\n\nSunghoon seemed to search Jay’s face, his eyes dark. “I don’t know,” he said a little breathily, as if he wasn’t the one who started it. His lips were a bit swollen, glistening in the light. “Jake could come in here at any time.”\n\n“Yeah, so behave,” Jay warned, though he could feel how his mouth had suddenly gone dry. It was embarrassing how easy he was when it came to Sunghoon.\n\n“We’re just kissing,” Sunghoon, the liar, said before leaning back in to kiss him again.\n\nBut it was as if a flip had been switched, where Jay was now hyperaware of every single movement, every time Sunghoon shifted even a millimeter against him. It was rapidly becoming almost uncomfortable, and Jay felt a little crazy that Sunghoon didn’t seem nearly as affected as him, just occasionally moaning softly into Jay’s mouth as Jay rubbed circles into Sunghoon’s waist under his shirt as they continued to make out.\n\n“I think…” Sunghoon said, being the one to break away first. Jay, almost mesmerized, watched how a strand of saliva followed, reaching out to swipe his thumb over Sunghoon’s lips. “I think I hear Jake coming.”\n\n“No you don’t,” Jay said immediately. He briefly wanted to push his thumb into Sunghoon’s mouth, just to see how he’d react, but had to quickly banish the thought when it wasn’t helping his situation. But he didn’t want to think about Jake coming. He wanted to think about Sunghoon—no, no, he had to redirect his thoughts.\n\n“Yeah, I hear footsteps,” Sunghoon said, hurriedly climbing off of Jay’s lap. Jay tried not to wince at the loss of pressure as Sunghoon tossed Jay’s extra pillow in his direction. “For your, um.”\n\nSo he’d known about it, the fucker.\n\nAs if he had said or done nothing, Sunghoon slid over to Jay’s chair to sit down, reaching for his phone on the desk.\n\nJay was just about to kill him for his nonchalance when the door swung open, no knocking or decorum or anything. Although to be fair, this was also Jake’s room.\n\n“Whoa. Is this a bad time?” Jake asked, blinking. “I was just gonna ask Jay something.”\n\nJay had to resist the urge to throw his pillow at Jake, mainly because Jake didn’t really deserve it, and also because he needed to keep this pillow over his lap.\n\n“No,” Sunghoon said mildly.\n\nJake squinted at them, still not stepping into the room. “Did you guys fight?”\n\n“What? No,” Jay said, trying not to grit his teeth. Now would be a good time to stop asking questions.\n\n“There’s just a weird tension between you two right now,” Jake said, shifting his gaze back and forth between Jay and Sunghoon. He remained by the door, as if they were radioactive, or contagious with something.\n\n“We’re fine,” Jay said. There was probably ‘weird tension’ between them because Jay was so turned on he could probably die and yet he was having a conversation with his roommate instead of having his pretty boyfriend on his lap. “Of course we’re fine. Why wouldn’t we be?”\n\nJake scrutinized him for a moment. “Are you sure?” he emphasized.\n\nSunghoon sighed. “I’ll go,” he said, dusting off invisible lint from his sleeves as he got up. He brushed past Jake in the doorway, with Jake giving him a pretty wide berth, and disappeared down the hallway.\n\n“Dude,” Jake said, falsely vindictive. “That’s why I’m asking. Weird vibes, man.”\n\nJay groaned. It wasn’t Jake’s fault, he told himself. “Just—what did you need to ask me?”\n\nJake hesitated, glancing at the door. “Hey, are you sure you and Sunghoon are okay?”\n\n“Yes,” Jay said tightly.\n\n“Because it looked like…” Jake shrugged. “Sometimes you guys fight, so. Hope everything’s alright. I’m always here for you.”\n\n“Thank you.” Jay didn’t mention that he and Sunghoon rarely ever fought for serious reasons. Sure, they had petty little quarrels for fun that sometimes led to real fights, but they were never anything that couldn’t be fixed within a few hours. This had been true of Jay and Sunghoon even before they’d gotten together, and it was certainly never anything to be so wary of like Jake was at the moment. Jay was beginning to seriously doubt Jake’s understanding of his relationship with Sunghoon.\n\n“Anyway. Sunghoon didn’t have to leave for this, but whatever,” Jake said. “I was just going to ask if you wanted to order anything with me for dinner. Everyone’s kind of fending for themselves tonight, and I remember you said you wanted to try that restaurant I ordered from last time.”\n\n“Oh, thanks,” Jay said, touched by Jake’s thoughtfulness, and then was reminded that what he kind of wanted the most right now was to be touched. Wow, he seriously had to just stop thinking about it. “Yeah, um, just order another of whatever you’re gonna order.”\n\n“Really?” Jake said. “You sure?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“Okay,” Jake said, looking down at his phone. “You think Sunghoon will want anything?”\n\n“You should ask Sunghoon that.”\n\nJake pointed at him, like Jay had gotten an answer right. “Right. Okay, I’ll go ask him. It’s okay if we eat together, right? Like…”\n\nJay sighed. “Jake, Sunghoon and I are not fighting.”\n\n“Okay, great,” Jake said brightly. “Dinner together, then!”\n\nJay collapsed against the headboard of his bed as Jake left the room, tossing the now useless pillow aside. The heated feeling under his skin had died down, and he paused to think about how everything had unraveled so quickly.\n\nIt was startlingly nice to receive random bursts of affection from Sunghoon—cute, even, with the way his whole expression seemed to melt into something softer, his light giggles filling Jay’s ears. Jay wondered what had prompted Sunghoon’s good mood, and resolved to ask about it later.\n\nBut another thing.\n\nThe thing was, Jake had caught them mid-makeout session and still didn’t seem to realize that Jay and Sunghoon were together.\n\nIt wasn’t that Jay was particularly crazy about the idea of being found out, but he also kind of… was? He and Sunghoon had already agreed that keeping their relationship a secret and sneaking around would be an unnecessary source of stress, seeing how they had enough on their plate to juggle already. If the members found out, they found out, and they both trusted them all enough to figure it out from there.\n\nBut here he was.\n\nWas the idea of him and Sunghoon being together so absurd that Jake would immediately assume any sort of tension between them would be a result of arguing rather than anything else?\n\nBut maybe Jay was overthinking it. Sunghoon had acted quickly, so maybe there hadn’t been any indicators that they’d been making out silly before Jake had interrupted. Perhaps it was for the better: Jake could also be a menace when it came to teasing Jay, and unlike Sunghoon, he wasn’t even someone Jay could shut up with a kiss.\n\nStill, regardless of any of that, it was also true that no one had even brought up his and Sunghoon’s relationship once, even just to ask. It was an odd feeling, Jay not knowing what he even wanted. But it was obvious, Jay and Sunghoon, wasn’t it? Jay felt like he was bleeding love everywhere. He was a wounded man in action, a lovesick fool struck by Cupid’s arrow.\n\nAlthough Jay was all too aware of the multitude of reasons why they couldn’t be together publicly, it was a different story with the members. The members had all even joked about it at one point, dating and love, maybe even with each other, just not specifically about Jay-and-Sunghoon.\n\nBut in a way, Jay could understand why the average person would not think that he and Sunghoon were dating. Even his mom had asked if he’d really meant to say Sunghoon when he’d called to tell her that he had a boyfriend, although her response had been admittedly more tongue-in-cheek than anything else. (“I’m kidding, son. You two have been acting like a married couple of twenty years ever since you’d properly become friends. Treat him well, alright? And make sure he treats you well too.”)\n\nThere was a thing they had going on. Black and white, fire and gasoline, water and oil. Opposites in so many ways, but ones that fit together in all the ways that actually mattered. Sunghoon would laugh himself into a tizzy as Jay voluntarily made a fool of himself in front of everyone, saying Jjongssaeng, you’re so cute, Jjongssaeng, and Jay would pretend to be annoyed by it. Sunghoon would make bad puns on camera, glancing sideways at Jay for his reaction, and Jay would make a show out of sighing and pinching the bridge of his nose, even though he actually found it funny in a loserly kind of way.\n\nJay suddenly wondered if it was actually himself who was creating some kind of distance between each other, the culprit behind the reason why it never occurred to anyone that he and Sunghoon were dating. Was he taking the bit too far? Was it not obvious enough that he held some sort of special regard for Sunghoon?\n\nSunghoon had his own little arsenal of nicknames for the people he loved around him, and for Jay in particular. Meanwhile, Jay couldn’t even call Sunghoon a pet name in front of the members without wanting to sink into the floor. It was a little pathetic.\n\nJay got up from his bed, finding himself walking toward Heeseung’s room. He’d go chase down Sunghoon again shortly, but he just wanted to ask Heeseung about it. Heeseung seemed like the right person to go to, especially since he’d been a witness to Jay making that epic blunder (that actually wasn’t really a blunder) of him calling Sunghoon baby in front of their apartment earlier.\n\nHe knocked on Heeseung’s door twice, waiting to hear Heeseung’s response before entering.\n\n“Hey,” Heeseung said as Jay made a beeline for Heeseung’s bed.\n\n“Hi,” Jay said, heaving a sigh as he sat down. “So I was thinking.”\n\n“Uh oh,” Heeseung joked, turning off his computer monitor and turning his gaming chair to face Jay properly. “What’s up?”\n\nJay had to think about how to approach the conversation. He’d come to Heeseung without much of a plan, except that this wasn’t really the sort of thing you made plans for, so he decided to just go for it.\n\n“So, you know how Sunghoon and I have a thing?” Jay made a face as he said the words. It sounded like what they had was some sort of fling, when it was so much more than that. “You know… like, you get it.”\n\nHeeseung nodded. “Yeah, obviously.”\n\nJay processed that for a moment. Okay, so at least one person knew. Obviously. Was it obvious, though? “I guess I’m just kind of wondering if it’s maybe not entirely obvious,” he said.\n\n“Oh, I think it’s pretty obvious,” Heeseung said blithely, the opposite of what Jay had expected him to say. “You know, ‘my one and only unit’ and everything. You guys push it pretty hard.”\n\nJay blinked. That certainly could not be true, what with Jake’s recent reaction to them and also practically almost everyone else, but it was also highly likely that Heeseung just had a different view of the two of them than the rest of the group. Heeseung had known Jay for many years and knew things about Jay’s life that Jay wasn’t sure that even Sunghoon fully knew yet, and it was also no secret that Heeseung adored Sunghoon, paying him a kind of fond attention that Sunghoon didn't seem to realize he was receiving.\n\n“I’m not trying to push anything,” Jay said, just in case Heeseung had misunderstood his earlier interaction with Sunghoon. “That would be weird for the group. I just—want Sunghoon… to know…? Yeah. I guess I just want Sunghoon to know, and I’m not sure if he… if he does.”\n\nIt made less and less sense as Jay tried to articulate it into actual words, but Heeseung seemed to consider it all the same. “He probably knows,” Heeseung decided. “You’re not really a subtle guy, you know?”\n\nBut I don’t think he does, Jay wanted to insist, but that was something that would launch the conversation into circles, and Heeseung didn’t need to hear about Jay’s personal rabbithole into the emotional depths of his and Sunghoon’s relationship.\n\nJay would figure it out on his own. It seemed like the announcement of him and Sunghoon wasn’t even that big of a surprise to Heeseung anyway, and it had been a bit of a silly concern in the first place.\n\n“Yeah, I guess,” Jay said, figuring he’d wrap it up there. “Well, thanks. Have you eaten yet?”\n\nHeeseung nodded. “I had some ramyeon earlier.”\n\n“That’s it?” Jay asked, frowning a little. “What about some protein?”\n\nHeeseung waved him off. “I added egg into the soup. But I’ll also order something else later; don’t worry about me, Jongseong-ah.”\n\nWith a few more assurances from Heeseung that he’d eat something more nutritiously balanced, Jay left Heeseung’s room in search of Sunghoon, who had apparently returned to his own room. Jungwon was also in the room, lying on his stomach on his own bed, looking at something on his phone. Probably Weverse.\n\n“Hi,” Jungwon said, raising a hand to waggle his fingers at him.\n\n“Jungwon, hey,” Jay replied with a smile as Jungwon returned his attention back to whatever he’d been looking at. Jay looked at Sunghoon, beckoning to him while trying not to seem too overt about it.\n\nWhy? was the look in Sunghoon’s eyes, because Sunghoon rarely ever made anything easy for Jay at first try.\n\nOh well. Jay turned around and left, knowing that Sunghoon would inevitably follow. Hopefully. He passed by Jake sitting on the living room couch watching TV with Ni-ki and Sunoo, the three of them likely just burning time while waiting for their dinner orders to arrive, and went back to his own room.\n\nSure enough, Sunghoon soon followed, closing the door behind him.\n\n“What did you bring me here for?” Sunghoon asked. Like he didn’t know. Well, Jay didn’t know exactly either. He just knew that he wanted to be close to Sunghoon again.\n\n“What if I just… missed you?” Jay offered. He patted the space beside him on the bed, scooting himself into the corner between the headboard and the wall to make more room for Sunghoon.\n\nSunghoon gave him a look of disbelief but still came to sit next to him. “You can’t get enough of me,” he said.\n\n“Yeah,” Jay agreed easily, in no position to dispute Sunghoon’s words. Whatever you say, baby.\n\nSunghoon settled against Jay’s chest, and Jay instinctively raised an arm to drape it across Sunghoon’s shoulders. Sunghoon was so pleasantly broad, Jay absently noted.\n\n“How come you abandoned ship so fast earlier?” Jay asked.\n\n“Are you gonna keep asking silly questions?” Sunghoon replied, tilting his head backwards onto Jay’s shoulders so he could look at Jay. “You know that Jake would’ve walked in on us.”\n\n“Yeah, but,” Jay said slowly, “maybe I wouldn’t have minded.”\n\nSunghoon narrowed his eyes at him before moving to properly face him. “Okay, you freak,” he said, his brows furrowed in consideration as he put a little distance between them. “Do you have something you want to tell me?”\n\nIt finally clicked in Jay’s head what Sunghoon probably thought he meant. “Not like that,” he said, horrified. “Not—Sunghoon!”\n\n“What!” Sunghoon hissed.\n\nJay sighed, trying to get the conversation back on track. “I’ve just been thinking, what if we didn’t keep us a secret anymore?”\n\n“It’s never been a secret,” Sunghoon pointed out. “That was the whole point.”\n\n“But when Jake—”\n\n“There’s a difference between Jake finding out that we’re dating and Jake walking in on us looking like we’re five minutes away from fucking,” Sunghoon said, giving him a look. “Come on, Jay.”\n\n“Oh, but didn’t you say that we were ‘just kissing’?” Jay said, crossing his arms. “And we don’t fuck. We—”\n\n“I’m seriously going to throw up if you say that we make love.”\n\nJay snapped his mouth shut, dropping his arms back to his sides again. “Come back here,” he said with a sigh.\n\n“No, you’ve got a serious case of loser-itis right now, and I bet it’s contagious,” Sunghoon said, even though he was already inching closer to Jay, back to how he’d been sitting before.\n\nJay wrapped his arms around Sunghoon’s waist and lowered his mouth to the warmth of Sunghoon’s neck, leaving a long kiss there. “I spoke to Heeseung hyung earlier,” he said. “Apparently he already knew about us.”\n\n“You told him?” Sunghoon said, sounding surprised. “Without telling me?”\n\nJay felt suddenly caught off-guard. They hadn’t really discussed what the exact parameters of not keeping it a secret were. “Was I not supposed to?” he asked a little nervously. “I just figured…”\n\n“We never talked about that,” Sunghoon said with a frown. “But I mean I did too, so whatever. I told Sunoo.”\n\nJay really just couldn’t with Sunghoon sometimes. He poked Sunghoon’s side, feeling exasperated amusement creep into his face. “And? How’d he react?”\n\n“He laughed in my face,” Sunghoon deadpanned.\n\n“Right,” Jay said, wincing, feeling like he should’ve expected something like that.\n\n“And then we got called out of the waiting room, so we never finished talking about it,” Sunghoon said. “Which is fine. I don’t really mention it to people.”\n\n“Right,” Jay repeated. He didn’t know how to continue the conversation, even though it was he who had brought it all up. It was strange, considering how he usually never felt at a loss of things to say when he was with Sunghoon. If anything, it was usually Jay trying to draw words out of a quiet Sunghoon in any given conversation, even if it meant creating some sort of ordeal to make Sunghoon laugh, or to bait him into making fun of Jay.\n\nSunghoon had taken one of Jay’s hands to absently play with Jay’s fingers in his lap, running the pads of his pale fingers along the ridges of Jay’s hands in different patterns. It was soothing, a motion that Jay wasn’t sure Sunghoon was even aware he was doing.\n\nAs expected, Sunghoon didn’t pick up the threads of the conversation. He was often content to just sit in silence, something Jay used to nervously fill with non-stop chattering before he got to know Sunghoon a little better. Now, Jay had come to value it, the comfortable tranquility and increased awareness of the proximity he shared with Sunghoon, soaking in the line of warmth pressed against the front of Jay’s body. He’d come to know that it meant that Sunghoon liked him, glad to just be near him.\n\nJay lowered his head to rest his chin on Sunghoon’s shoulder, shifting a few times to make sure it wouldn’t make Sunghoon uncomfortable. Sunghoon stopped fiddling with his fingers, lacing them together instead, and Jay thought he could feel Sunghoon’s heartbeat from where they were connected. His pulse point was by Jay’s cheek. Alive. Real.\n\nThere was a muffled shout from the living room. Jake. Food’s here!\n\nAs much as Jay wanted to stay where they were forever, they shouldn’t keep Jake waiting. Jay nudged Sunghoon when he made no move to get up. “He’s calling us. Let’s go, baby,” he said softly.\n\nSunghoon was still for one moment longer, then nodded, scooting to the edge of the bed and standing up. He turned to look at Jay, like he was contemplating something.\n\n“What?” Jay said as he also stood up, watching Sunghoon linger. And then—\n\nSunghoon swiftly leaned in to kiss Jay on the cheek, a light thing. “Nothing,” he said, happy, stepping back quickly and turning to head out the door.\n\nHeat rose in Jay’s face at Sunghoon’s unexpected action. “Okay,” he muttered to himself, hand coming up to touch where Sunghoon kissed him, like he was hypnotized. “What the hell.”\n\nHe was still standing alone in the middle of his room where Jake’s voice called out again. Jay, the vultures are going to eat your food if you don’t come out soon! Ni-ki, come on, I asked you if you wanted to order anything—yeah, yeah, you can have some of mine, you brat. Park Jongseong!\n\n“Coming!” Jay called back. He pressed his palm to his cheek. He was fine.\n\n“Sunghoon hyung, can you at least pretend like you’re not trying to telepathically blow up Jay hyung in your head right now?”\n\nJake whipped his head to the camera crew and staff in front of them, bewildered. “Are we even allowed to say things like that on camera?”\n\n“Lighten up, Sunghoon hyung!” Sunoo cheered, ignoring Jake. “You got this!”\n\n“You would say that, Sunoo,” Sunghoon gritted out. For a moment, Jay was fearful that Sunghoon would quite literally explode on the spot.\n\nHeeseung was clearly finding this whole situation amusing. “You did lose fair and square, Sunghoon,” he reminded him, which probably wasn’t very helpful for Sunghoon at all.\n\n“I feel like this is more of a penalty for everyone else who’s watching than it is for Sunghoon,” Jay noted dryly, eliciting a couple laughs from around him.\n\n“I can’t do this,” Sunghoon said, covering his face with his hands. “I can’t!”\n\n“You have to!” Sunoo egged on. “We want to see your aegyo!”\n\n“No, you don’t!” Sunghoon insisted. His body was turned away from Jay almost entirely, facing the rest of the members instead.\n\n“You lost, so you have to!” Ni-ki chimed in. “Besides, Engenes will love it.”\n\nIt was quite simple how the situation came to this: they had played several rounds of games for the filming of a variety show, and rules were that the loser had a final mission of doing aegyo in front of a random member until the loser got a pass from the member.\n\nIt was something of a blessing and a curse that Sunghoon had gotten the lowest score across the game rounds, and that Jay had been the one chosen to receive Sunghoon’s… ambiguous set of actions that he attempted to pass off as aegyo until Heeseung called time-out to point out that Sunghoon wasn’t really doing aegyo.\n\nSunghoon had quickly dropped the reluctant V-sign he’d been holding up against his expressionless face and proceeded to complain. Quite excessively, actually, as anyone would expect.\n\n“You are not allowed to let that pass,” Jungwon said to Jay with a laugh, his eyes crinkled into little crescents the way it did when he was particularly amused.\n\nSunghoon looked like he was three seconds from threatening to throw himself into incoming traffic.\n\nBut rules were rules. While it was true that Jay was particularly weak to Sunghoon’s demands, he knew that the other members would never let the opportunity to get their most aegyo-averse member to act cute in front of the camera go to waste, in the name of content.\n\n“Give me the best you got,” Jay said.\n\nSunghoon glared at him, then gave his cheek a dutiful poke. Jay pursed his lips together so as not to laugh.\n\n“That’s still weak!” Ni-ki called out.\n\n“You should give us a demonstration, then,” Jake said to him, and Ni-ki immediately seemed to find the wall behind them incredibly interesting.\n\n“How about you do an aegyo song?” Sunoo suggested, giggling when Sunghoon shot him an incredibly betrayed look.\n\n“What about a set of hearts?” Jay said, trying to guess what Sunghoon’s limits of too cool for this were.\n\n“Ah, Jjongssaeng…”\n\n“Come on, they’re hearts, you do them all the time anyway.”\n\nThe cameras were rolling, the clock ticking. Jay was nothing if not a dedicated comedian first and an idol second, and he just thought it would be extra entertaining to get a fun reaction out of Sunghoon, now that he was given the chance.\n\nSunghoon soullessly flashed him a set of three different hearts, each with a distinct vibe of here, damn. It was kind of deceptively hilarious in his own Sunghoon way.\n\n“What about a cute version of our recent comeback’s dance challenge?” Jay said.\n\n“That’s a good one,” Jungwon said.\n\nSunghoon heaved a sigh, and did the dance challenge with Heeseung singing the lyrics, though it technically lacked any notable changes to make it particularly cute.\n\nJay let it slide, finding this a little too much fun. It was a rare occasion to hold any sort of leverage over Sunghoon, and the fact that they were in front of cameras meant that there were no stray slippers or arm punches that would come flying his way even if he pushed it a little with Sunghoon. “What about—”\n\n“Park Jongseong,” Sunghoon said threateningly. “When I see you back in the dorms later today…”\n\nA good handful of the members collapsed laughing.\n\n“Okay, then how about you say something nice to me,” Jay said, compromising. “You don’t need to say much, just something like, Jay, you have beaten me today with your incredible prowess at variety show games. Please let me escape the penalty as I acknowledge that I am inferior at games than J—”\n\n“Are you crazy?” Sunghoon all but shrieked.\n\n“Okay, okay,” Heeseung said, trying to organize the situation. “Sunghoon, just do anything.”\n\nSunghoon closed his eyes for a moment. “Fine,” he said, then stepped forward closer to Jay. “Jjongssaeng,” he said evenly, because that seemed to be his default phrase when it came to Jay. “I think I’ve done enough.”\n\nJake laughed, somewhere off to the side. “Is he trying to reason with Jay instead of doing the actual mission?”\n\n“Just a little more,” Jay said, knowing that there was a little bit of a shit-eating grin on his face. He couldn’t help it—a little something like payback for all the times Sunghoon had dunked on him in their previous variety content.\n\nSunghoon stubbornly held up another pathetic V-sign.\n\nJay raised an eyebrow.\n\nDropping his hand, Sunghoon kicked his foot a little. “Really, isn’t this enough?” he asked, a little pleading. “Like, come on… hyung.”\n\nJay blinked.\n\n“Ooh, the big guns,” Sunoo said with a little laugh.\n\nSunghoon was looking at him with a resolute look in his eye, and Jay suddenly felt a little warm in the face.\n\n“Fine, okay,” Jay said quickly, avoiding looking at the other members. “You pass.”\n\n“Yes!” Sunghoon exclaimed loudly, pumping his fist. “Finally!”\n\nIt was almost ridiculous how quickly Jay had crumbled, but that particular form of address was something that caught Jay off guard every time Sunghoon used it. Hyung was used more sparsely than others, but it was still another one of Sunghoon’s many different names he kept on rotation to address Jay.\n\nBut the way Sunghoon had said it so shamelessly in front of everyone else, a strangely unbridled form of affection from Sunghoon who was usually so allergic to such displays of endearment, gave Jay a bit of startling clarity.\n\nHeeseung gave him a clap on the shoulder and a smile once the filming crew called it a wrap. Jay didn’t know how to feel about that either.\n\nAfter they finished filming, the seven of them had to part ways, some back to the apartment, some to a few additional schedules.\n\nJay approached the couch, having finished washing up, and sat down on the opposite end of where Sunghoon was already sitting. “What are you watching?” he asked.\n\nSunghoon had the remote in his hand, flicking through the TV channels. “Not sure,” he said. “Can’t watch that drama I was watching with Jungwon, since he isn’t here.”\n\nJay slid himself closer to Sunghoon so he could steal the remote.\n\n“Get away from me,” Sunghoon said, holding the remote out of Jay’s reach.\n\n“Let me pick,” Jay huffed. “You’re going through the channels too fast.”\n\nSunghoon rolled his eyes, though he handed the remote over good-naturedly. “You know, you kind of left me for dead out there today,” he said conversationally. “The final mission?”\n\n“The aegyo,” Jay said knowingly. “You knocked it out of the park.”\n\n“No I didn’t,” Sunghoon said flatly. “It should’ve been you.”\n\n“Too bad I’m just better at games than you.”\n\n“Too bad you’re just yet another person in my life who’s insecure about their game skills.”\n\nJay frowned in contemplation. “Who’s the other—ah, Jake.”\n\n“Yeah, Jake,” Sunghoon said at the same time.\n\n“I’m not being insecure,” Jay said pointedly. “I’m gloating. There’s a difference.”\n\n“Keep gloating, and see if you still have a boyfriend by the end of it,” Sunghoon snarked.\n\n“It’s funny how you only ever call yourself my boyfriend whenever you threaten to break up with me,” Jay said, exasperatedly poking Sunghoon’s side, not even finding it in himself to be offended. “You can’t say you’re my boyfriend any other time?”\n\n“Don’t be ridiculous,” Sunghoon said, shoving Jay’s hand away. He glanced at Jay, a hint of a smile dancing on his lips betraying his real emotions. A genuine one, one that suited his face so well. “You know…” he said thoughtfully. “What if we asked to swap rooms tonight? I could ask Jake.”\n\n“Like,” Jay said, “I sleep in your room and you sleep in my room?”\n\nSunghoon punched him in the arm. There was usually a time limit on Sunghoon being nice to him. “No, you idiot. Us. Hanging out. Sleepover, whatever.”\n\n“We’re hanging out now,” Jay pointed out. He wasn’t trying to be difficult on purpose, just trying to figure out what had brought this on. And also maybe to be a little difficult on purpose, but that wasn’t the point. “What, you missed me that much?”\n\n“Is that such a crime?” Sunghoon asked, crossing his arms. “I don’t know. Maybe I just want to see you all the time.”\n\nJay was pleasantly taken aback, reminded in that moment that even though Sunghoon’s words were sometimes rough at the edges and that he also easily got a little silly with Jay at times, he was never cruel. In fact, Sunghoon was usually the first to stop a practical joke that toed the line of going too far at Jay’s expense, and he was also always understanding despite how much they bickered. There was an unbothered quality to Sunghoon that was amusing to goad, a bit different from the hair trigger type of arguing that Jay fell into so easily with Jake, or Jungwon, or with anyone else in the group. Jay secretly liked that he had a certain effect on Sunghoon, that he could get Sunghoon so incensed over nothing.\n\nThere were many things he liked about Sunghoon.\n\n“I’d like that,” Jay said.\n\nThen, as if the universe had been listening in on their conversation, Jake walked into the living room, his face brightening as he caught sight of them on the couch. “What are you guys watching?” he asked.\n\n“Uh…” Jay glanced at the TV that had settled on a random channel amidst their conversation. “Home shopping, I guess?”\n\nJake looked at the TV screen as well. “I’m sure our dorm is in dire need of a baby cradle,” he joked, looking back at them.\n\n“Who knows, Ni-ki might want a new bed sometime soon,” Sunghoon said, his chin in his hand.\n\nJake seemed to study him for a moment, and then turned his gaze to Jay. “Hey, is something up? There’s this, like, weird tension between you guys.”\n\nJay blinked in bafflement, getting a strange sense of deja vu. “Huh?” he said. He and Sunghoon were just sitting side by side, nothing more and nothing less.\n\nJake made a vague, hand-wavy motion in the air. “I don’t know. There’s a… vibe?”\n\nThere should be no vibe. Or if there was, it should be a good one. Jay and Sunghoon had just finished a pleasant conversation before Jake had walked in. Or… right? Jay minutely felt like he was going crazy.\n\n“You’re crazy,” Sunghoon announced, though his words were directed towards Jake instead of Jay.\n\nJake shrugged, easily letting it go. “Whatever, okay.”\n\n“Jake,” Sunghoon said, and then added, “Jakey, Jakey,” like he couldn’t resist, before continuing. “Thoughts on you and I swapping rooms for tonight?”\n\n“Sure,” Jake said simply. “Epic. Sleepover in the quad room.”\n\n“Every day is a sleepover in the quad room for me,” Sunghoon muttered. “I need to indulge in this double bedroom lifestyle.”\n\n“Then maybe you shouldn’t have lost rock paper scissors when we drew lots for the rooms,” Jake said, wiggling his eyebrows up and down in a Jake-typical, goofy way. “Skill issue!”\n\n“I’ll show you skill issue,” Sunghoon hissed, leaping up from the couch. “Come on, open up League right now!”\n\nJake immediately faltered. “Naw, I’m so busy right now,” he said, backing away. “Like, so busy. Like, insanely bu—” Jake cut himself off as he whipped around, sprinting down the hallway.\n\n“I need to beat his ass,” Sunghoon explained calmly to Jay, then ran off to chase after Jake.\n\nJay was left to watch the home shopping channel advertise a massage chair to him. God, he kind of wanted to be sitting in one right now.\n\nInstead of sitting on the couch pathetically watching a home shopping channel by himself, Jay found himself wandering over to Heeseung’s room. The door was slightly ajar, with Heeseung seated at his desk, playing a game on his monitor.\n\n“Hey,” Jay said. “You don’t need to pause it or anything. I’m just here to watch.”\n\n“Sure,” Heeseung said, turning back to his game. It wasn’t the first time Jay came to watch him play something. “What’s up?”\n\nWhat was up? Nothing, really. There was an interesting mix of feelings happening in Jay at the moment, a maelstrom of exhaustion and affection and confusion and also maybe a dash of insecurity building up in the pit of his stomach. The filming today, everything with Sunghoon, Jake’s reaction to them sitting next to each other on the couch. There’s this, like, weird tension between you guys.\n\nHow to explain all of that without sounding a bit unhinged? There wasn’t really a way.\n\n“Not much,” Jay admitted, just to keep it simple. “Tired, mostly.”\n\n“Tell me about it,” Heeseung said with a sigh, rapidly clicking on his mouse as he spared a glance beside him at Jay. “It’s nice to have something to destress with, though, you know?”\n\n“Yeah, this looks…” Jay watched Heeseung destroy an enemy on the screen. “Looks like it would destress you pretty well.”\n\nHeeseung hummed, expertly tapping across his keyboard in a way Jay didn’t really bother to understand.\n\nJay rested his chin in his palm, continuing to watch Heeseung’s screen. “Do you ever feel weird that everyone calls you hyung?” he asked.\n\n“Not really,” Heeseung said, his eyes not leaving the screen.\n\nJay should’ve figured that Heeseung would say that, considering Heeseung was the oldest. It actually made sense for everyone to call him hyung.\n\n“Why?” Heeseung asked.\n\n“Nothing,” Jay said quickly. “It’s just weird hearing Sunghoon say it to anyone who isn’t you.”\n\n“To you, you mean,” Heeseung said. Jay should’ve known that Heeseung would be unexpectedly perceptive. He watched Heeseung maneuver his character through the game map. “Sunghoon calls you a bunch of different things all the time, though.”\n\n“Ye"
