        "text": "On January 4, 2018, six women prisoners filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging systematic, misogynistic mistreatment of women prisoners at the Alameda County Jail in Santa Rita, California. The plaintiffs sued Alameda County and the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office under 42 U.S.C. §1983 for violations of their rights under the U.S. Constitution and state law. Represented by private counsel, they sought monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief.\n\nSpecifically, the complaint alleges that pregnant women prisoners were denied medical attention and other accommodations including weather-appropriate clothing, nutritious food, feminine hygiene products, and fresh air. The specific conduct targeted toward pregnant women took place within an environment marked by general hostility toward women prisoners and indifference to women’s medical and hygienic needs. Further, the complaint alleged that the Alameda County Jail systematically discriminated against the women prisoners, compared to men prisoners, in access to reasonable facilities and services. In the complaint, the women prisoners sought recognition of class certification consisting of a main class of women prisoners with a sub-class of pregnant prisoners. The plaintiffs claimed that the conduct of the Alameda County Jail staff violated women prisoners’ rights protected by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.\n\nOn the same day that the initial complaint was filed, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent further harm to the pregnant plaintiffs. The women prisoners also sought relief in the form of compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees for the litigation. The case proceeded before Judge James Donato.\n\nOn April 12, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. The plaintiffs elaborated on the allegations in the original complaint of the mistreatment against pregnant women prisoners and discrimination against women prisoners in general. The second amended complaint also added additional causes of action under California state law. The second amended complaint delineated the named plaintiffs into various groups: current women prisoners, women who were formerly imprisoned, pregnant prisoners currently in custody, and formerly pregnant prisoners who suffered a miscarriage due to mistreatment while in custody. The complaint also identified additional named defendants beyond the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office and individuals employed therein, including the California Forensic Medical Group, retained to provide medical services to prisoners and Aramark Correctional Services, a for-profit food services provider at the Jail.\n\nThe amended complaint also amended the relief sought by the women prisoners. The plaintiffs requested that the court certify the plaintiff class of women prisoners and the subclass of pregnant women prisoners, and that the court issue emergency remedy, by decree, to ensure that the women prisoners receive the medical care and other accommodations they needed to be safe while in custody at the Alameda County Jail. Finally, in addition to the injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages requested in the original complaint, the plaintiffs requested that the court affirmatively direct the defendants to fully comply with all state statutes and regulations regarding medical treatment, nutrition, activities, and personal hygiene for women prisoners.\n\nOn December 31, 2018, one named plaintiff moved to relate the case to Upshaw v. County of Alameda. The parties began engaging in settlement negotiations and entered an agreement in principle on May 14, 2018. Settlement proceedings were heard by Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler. The parties initially agreed to resolve money damages and other substantive relief and the plaintiffs agreed to withdraw the motion for class certification. The parties held a number of settlement conferences between May 14, 2018 and December 12, 2019."
