There are many children in Ukraine whose homes have been destroyed and without food and water. Gentle support is needed.\n\nPlease donate to Save the Children.\n\nAccording to Google Analytics, Japanese Names.info has been visited from 217 countries and regions for 30 days. Of course, Ukrainian and Russian users are also included.\n\nFor the kind Russian people\n\nApparently this isn't broadcast on Russian TV, but what the Russian government is doing isn't actually a peacekeeping operation, but is more correctly described as an invasion and looting of your relative's country, Ukraine.\n\nThe only power that can change the reality in Ukraine is for the Russian people to speak out. Please touch the world media outside of Russia to see how your government is causing the tragic situation. Thank you for a peaceful world!\n\ne.g. UNICEF, Red Cross"
