        "text": "Hardcover. Condition: Near Fine. Dust Jacket Condition: Very Good. Text in English. 186 pp. Moderate scuffing to the dust jacket edges. Soviet museums possess twentynine paintings by Paul Gauguin. Fifteen are housed at the Hermitage in Leningrad and fourteen at the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow. Regrettably, this collection does not include the master's Impressionist works relating to the early stage of his career. All the pictures in these Soviet museums, with the exception of four canvases, were painted in Tahiti and at La Dominica, the artist's last abode. The Soviet collection is so representative both in volume and quality that it gives a fairly comprehensive idea of Gauguin's art. Although it does not cover all the phases of his development, it illustrates his most important and fruitful period, when the artist's creative principles found their most articulate expression in the portrayal of the natural world of Oceania and its people. This explains why Gauguin's name is most readily associated with his Tahitian pictures, for in them the artist's original aesthetics revealed itself to the full and his pictorial idiom found its realization. Gauguin's works in the USSR originate from the Moscow private collections assembled in the early twentieth century by Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morozov-two men whose names are now well-known to every connoisseur of modern French art. None of Shchukin's or Morozov's acquisitions can be described as having little or no significance for the understanding of Gauguin's art. Many of these pictures were mentioned by the artist in his letters as characteristic examples illustrating his aesthetic views and his creative aspirations. This is true of What! Are You Jealous? which Gauguin believed to be one of his best productions of 1892; of Pastorales Tahitiennes which, according to the artist himself, marked a new period in his career; and of Her Name Is Vairaumati which, though inspired by literary sources, owes its pictorial conception to his creative fancy. Many a line in Gauguin's letters is devoted to his famous picture The Queen (The King's Wife). In his book Noa Noa one can find parallels to the explanations accompanying some of the pictures now in the Soviet museums, for example Conversation, Landscape with Peacocks, Woman Holding a Fruit and The Canoe (A Tahitian Family). Other paintings are related to his large thematic panels Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? (Landscape with Two Goats and Man Picking Fruit from a Tree) and Preparations for a Feast (Gathering Fruit, Three Tahitian Women against a Yellow Background and Woman Carrying Flowers). Even the earliest of Gauguin's paintings represent important stages in his career. Thus, the still life Fruit, once presented by the artist to Charles Laval, manifests his synthetic method; the Cafe at Arles is one of the key works done during Gauguin's dramatic sojourn with Van Gogh at Arles; while the Self-Portrait is characteristic of the outlook of the artist who sees himself as a messiah repudiated by society. Present-day students of Gauguin's art cannot afford to leave out the pictures in the Soviet collection, and we hope, therefore, that this volume, in which every work is reproduced and provided with references, will be welcomed by professionals and art lovers alike."
