Okumura Mikoya. Mikouya is a dance hall. The characters Gokouya and Bikouya are applied to it, but it originally means Goshinya. The dance hall is about four tatami mats wide in the dei-no-ma room, which is a tatami room, and is covered with shimeren (paper lanterns). Many of the shimen decorations in the Okumura mikoya are made from kirigami. A rectangular piece of white paper with 'Niwa' cut out of it is called a chicken. In the centre, a primitive primitive shrine is built to welcome the divine spirit, which is called Takatenbaru. Around it, kagura utensils and masks are decorated. The kagura masks are covered with white paper except when dancing. On top of the altar, all the sacred staffs used in the kagura performance and the mizukami are displayed for the number of households in the area. When the kagura is over, each villager takes his or her own household deities home to be worshipped.
