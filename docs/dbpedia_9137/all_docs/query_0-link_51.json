I have always been interested in astronomy as far as I remember. One close conjunction memory burned in my brain turned out to be on 14th June 1983, a very high conjunction of the Moon and Venus; according to investigation on a desktop planetarium. My first observation (recorded) was on 29th February 1992. First astrophotograpy came late 1992. I bought my first telescope, a 80 mm newtonian, in 1993.\n\nI have always lived in Bursa apart from the years spent in Ankara for a college education. In that time, I and some friends in Middle East Technical University's AAS organized a trip to Kastamonu for 500 people to see the total Solar eclipse of 1999. After graduating as a civil engineer in 2002, I try to spend as much time as possible to observe the heavens, mostly from back home. But weekend escapes to Ankara, Uludag, Izmir or Antalya are always welcome. My other hobbies\n\nare Bird watching, nature photography, geology, skiing and trekking.\n\nAreas of interest\n\nAfter all these years, I think I like taking standard or wide angle pictures of sky with foreground, preferably with planets and the Moon.\n\n.\n\nOthers: Eclipses (of course); close conjunctions or occultations of bright star/planet/bright cluster\n\nwith/by the Moon; all-sky photograpy; time-lapse composites or movies, especially retrograde motion; meteor showers.\n\nAstrophotography publications Magazines\n\nAstronomy Now, Sky & Telescope\n\nNight Sky (Atlas,Turkish geography magazine)\n\n.

This mountain is a national park and a ski resort as well has a good road up to 1865 meters, my dark sky heaven (Ml~7).\n\nI occasionally travel to Ankara, where I went to college (Middle East Technical University) to meet\n\nfriends and go to Beynam Forest (40 km south of Ankara). The place is around 1400 m above sea level (39d 40'N, 33d 5'E) (Ml~6.5, except for due North). Another good place for observing for me is around Antalya, by the Mediterranean Sea. A few degrees to the South really helpes. Best spot near Kas (36d 12'N, 29d 38'E) (Ml~6.8).\n\nAstronomical Equipment\n\nTelescope\n\nMeade 8\" LX10 SCT\n\n.\n\nCameras\n\nCanon EOS 300D (Digital Rebel) SLR\n\nZenit 12XP SLR (for really cold conditions, my first camera since 1993)\n\nPentax Spotmatic SLR\n\nhome-made medium format all-sky camera,\n\nhome-made barn-door drive (since 1996).\n\nPhilips TouCam Pro 740 webcam\n\n.\n\nSoftware\n\nAdobe Photoshop 6,\n\nGrasshopper's ImageAlign 1.2.1"
