        "text": "“\n\nfantastic\n\nAre you a flight sim flyer that likes to fly correct procedures at airports around the world but find it hard to obtain the charts ? well Simplates is the answer, what Simplates is is a very neat program that will down load these charts for you in next to no time , the program is stand alone so you dont need any other program to run it and will work with any Flight Simulator eg FS2004 to X-Plane etc, there are Over 30,000 real-world IFR plates and some VFR ones too .. but thats not all as the Android version is now the new ultra edition which now has about 80,000 charts . I have used an older version of Simplates on the PC so i knew this version would be good , in fact its better then i thought it would be and so too is the customer support as i had a few problems but these turned out to be the fault of my credit card company and not the program. One thing i would add is dont use these for any form of real world flying as the charts will be out of date but are great for flight simulators. all in all a great product that works fine on my S2 and would look even better on a tablet .\n\n”\n\n“\n\nAmazingly excellent collection\n\nThe reviewer who gave this one star is a liar, and probably one who planted the review artificially for his much more expensive subscription based service. The reality is that simplates has a HUGE amount of plates.. larger than any other, does NOT have any supposed license check other than the one that Google play has for ALL apps and of course you don't have to manually copy the plates to your device like you do with the rip off subscription that the other guy mentioned. Simplates has more and better plates now and the dauntless help desk told me there would be a massive free upgrade soon, too. Love this app. Incredible value for what you get. I use it every time I use msfs.\n\n”"
