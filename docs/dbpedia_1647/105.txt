Eleventh Hour is an American thriller television series that was aired on CBS from 2008 to 2009. The show is a thriller that keeps the audience engaged with intriguing episodes that have scientific themes. The show stars Rufus Sewell as Dr. Jacob Hood, a researcher and science adviser to the US government. He is a former combat trauma surgeon, and he holds a Ph.D. in biophysics from MIT. Dr. Hood is a brilliant scientist who has a knack for solving the most complex scientific problems. His job is to investigate and solve any cases that are deemed emergencies that are related to future threats against humanity, from viruses to genetically modified food.

Each episode deals with a specific scientific problem that Dr. Hood is trying to solve. This often involves him approaching the problem using his own scientific methods, which can lead to interesting results. The show is peppered with scientific references and is very informative, allowing the viewers to learn about various scientific concepts.

One major theme that is explored throughout the series is the potential consequences of rapid scientific advancements. Dr. Hood often must deal with the after-effects of human interference in the natural world, be it through cloning or other experiments. This provides a thought-provoking atmosphere and starts important discussions on the implications of scientific creation.

Throughout the show, Hood is joined by his FBI agent handler, Special Agent Rachel Young (played by Marley Shelton). The two characters have a tense yet affectionate relationship that can easily transpose to everyday police and doctor relationships. She assists in his investigations, but the overarching theme is of her trying to reign him in so that he adheres to the laws that govern scientific experimentation.

The show is well-written and well-paced, with a genuine sense of excitement and urgency in every episode. The subject matter is interesting and informative, and the cast is excellent, making this an enjoyable and thrilling TV series. The show's effects and filming are excellent, and the dialogue is gripping, keeping the audience glued to their screens. Dr. Hood's scientific expertise and Agent Young's cool demeanor make for an entertaining duo, and their collaborations are a highlight of the show.

One of the most appealing aspects of Eleventh Hour is that there is no pretence of knowing everything, no omniscient character who miraculously solves the cases without any flaws; the characters are given the opportunity to make mistakes, to learn from them, and to develop strong relationships that transcend their differences.

The show's strength, in a sense, is that it doesn't pretend to know everything. The characters and their complicated relationships are explored, and their emotional journey can be as interesting as the case they're investigating. The show is, therefore, a compelling thriller, not your typical police procedural, with themes that will delight scientific enthusiasts.

In summary, Eleventh Hour is a must-watch for those who enjoy compelling thrillers that are fueled by scientific investigative games. With its well-crafted episodes, strong writing, and excellent actors, the show is compelling and often features the characters' personal stories alongside their science-based detective work. Watching Rufus Sewell's mesmerizing performances alone is worth the watch. If you're looking for an intelligent show that's thrilling, informative and has heart, Eleventh Hour is the show you are looking for.

Eleventh Hour is a series that is currently running and has 1 seasons (18 episodes). The series first aired on October 9, 2008.
