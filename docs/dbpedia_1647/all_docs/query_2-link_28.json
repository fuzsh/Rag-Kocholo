        "text": "The Living TV channel has picked up the exclusive UK rights to hit American mystery drama Eleventh Hour, which was based on the ITV drama that starred Patrick Stewart.\n\nThe show, from CSI producer Jerry Bruckheimer, has been one of the biggest hits of the US TV season, averaging around 12 million viewers on CBS.\n\nThe drama stars British actor Rufus Sewell as biophysicist Dr Jacob Hood who investigates scientific crises and oddities. It is based on the British series by Stephen Gallagher.\n\nThe drama will air on Living, owned by Virgin Media Television, later this year after the cable and satellite channel completed a deal with Warner Bros International Television Distribution.\n\nThe Virgin Media Television head of acquisitions, Amy Barham, said: \"Strong, compelling with hard-hitting storylines and a great cast, including an amazing performance from Rufus Sewell, Eleventh Hour is a great addition to Living's drama line up.\"\n\nLiving, which last week pulled in its highest ratings with coverage of Jade Goody's wedding, already airs a number of US dramas including Grey's Anatomy, Criminal Minds and Ghost Whisperer.\n\nTo contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857. For all other inquiries please call the main Guardian switchboard on 020 3353 2000."
