        "text": "The truth is out there, or at least the truth is that a lot of famous faces passed through the doors of Fox's iconic sci-fi series The X-Files during its original 1993 to 2002 run as well as its revivals in 2016 and 2018, respectively.\n\nLed by Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny, the TV series propelled the actors to superstardom and their run as Special Agents Fox Mulder (Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Anderson) who investigated an array of paranormal cases that gripped the nation. The pair worked with a number of great actors at the time, some of whom went on to became big names in their own right after their time on the show.\n\nHere is everything that you need to know about the biggest names to have appeared in the series.\n\nThe stars you forgot were in The X-Files\n\nJack Black\n\nAlready well on his way to becoming the star he is today, Jack Black made a guest appearance in the 1995 episode D.P.O as Bart \"Zero\" Liquori. His character is a friend of the episode's focus Darren Peter Oswald (Giovanni Ribisi), who wakes up one day to discover he has powers.\n\nRead more: The truth about The X-Files' greatness was there right from the pilot episode\n\nThe pair come across Scully and Mulder during their investigation into some strange activity, with them meeting Black's character at the video game store where he works.\n\nJodie Foster\n\nA less obvious cameo in The X-Files is of Academy Award winner Jodie Foster, who voices the character Betty in season 4's Never Again in 1997. Betty is a jealous tattoo who begins to make snide comments towards Ed Jerse, the man who got the ink after losing his divorce settlement.\n\nRyan Reynolds\n\nIn one of his earliest roles, Ryan Reynolds played high schooler Jay De Boom in Syzygy. The role wasn't a large one, given his character was killed after offering to drive two classmates home from a midnight vigil but it certainly was memorable when the character's coffin burst into flames.\n\nBryan Cranston\n\nBefore he led Breaking Bad, Bryan Cranston met Vince Gilligan on The X-Files. In the sci-fi series Cranston played antagonist Patrick Crump in season 6's Drive, a villainous role that Gilligan felt was perfect for the actor after years of his nice-guy persona on Malcolm in the Middle.\n\nHis success in the role led to his casting as Walter White in Breaking Bad, Gilligan made his name on the sci-fi series and Cranston is just one of several actors who appeared on X-Files first. Others include Dean Norris, who played Hank, and Raymond Cruz, who played Tuco.\n\nAaron Paul\n\nSpeaking of Breaking Bad, Cranston's co-star Aaron Paul also cut his teeth on The X-Files. Paul appeared on the show in 2001 as David 'Sky Commander Winky' Winkle in Lord of the Flies, an episode written by Thomas Schnauz who went on to work on Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul.\n\nPaul's character is the leader of a group of teens that Scully and Mulder meets after his friend died doing a stunt, only for it to be discovered he died as a result of a swarm of killer flies hidden in his brain.\n\nLily Tomlin\n\nThe iconic Lily Tomlin needs little introduction, and she was certainly famous before she appeared on The X-Files but that doesn't mean that viewers remember she was in it. The actor starred in the episode, How the Ghosts Stole Christmas, where Mulder and Scully visit a haunted mansion and meet the ghosts residing in it — Lyda (Tomlin) and Maurice (Ed Asner).\n\nOctavia Spencer\n\nOscar winner Octavia Spencer stars in The X-Files episode Millennium as Nurse Octavia, a staffer at a mental institution that Scully and Mulder visit. Fans might best remember the episode for being the one where the FBI agents kiss for the first time, so they'd be forgiven for forgetting Spencer's part in it.\n\nLucy Liu\n\nBefore Charlie's Angels and Kill Bill made her a silver screen icon, Lucy Liu appeared on The X-Files as Kim Hsin, a leukemia patient whose father chooses to use dark forces to try and save her. The episode, Hell Money, sees Scully and Mulder investigate a murder in San Fransisco's Chinatown.\n\nBurt Reynolds\n\nOne of the great Hollywood actors, Burt Reynolds appears in the season 9 episode Improbable. The actor was a big fan of The X-Files at the time and had expressed an interest in appearing on the show, he was then cast in the role of God for the episode.\n\nDanny Trejo\n\nThe X-Files ninth season featured the episode Redrum, which starred Danny Trejo as Cesar Ocampo. The actor portrays a killer who Scully and partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick) encounter over the course of their investigation.\n\nDave Grohl\n\nHe may be best known as the frontman of Foo Fighters and drummer for Nirvana, but Dave Grohl also has a few acting credits to his name, including The X-Files. In an uncredited cameo, Grohl appears in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment in season 3 episode Pusher as a background character.\n\nMinnie Driver\n\nAnother brief cameo from an A-lister in The X-Files is with Minnie Driver, the actor had already made Good Will Hunting by this point but she was perfectly happy to play an unnamed character who was part of the audience at a Lazarus Bowl screening in season 7's Hollywood AD.\n\nMichael Bublé\n\nYes, really, singer Michael Bublé has appeared in The X-Files. The musician used to play extras in a variety of shows to make ends meet, and he played a member of a submarine crew in two episodes from season 3: Piper Maru and Apocrypha.\n\nThe experience was not a fun one for the musician because he was fired from the job, in an interview with TV Live Bublé revealed he lost his job after eating a hot dog from the crafts table that was intended for the series' regular cast and crew."
