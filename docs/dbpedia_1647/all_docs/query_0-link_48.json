A background artist is a person or member of a group contributing to the overall authenticity and atmosphere of a scene. The individual or individuals in the group may be dressed in clothing identifiable with the role, calling or trade selected for each by the producer or advertiser, and may be directed by the director to move and/or react as required on the set. Crowd noises can include community singing of well known songs where words do not have to be learned.\n\nWalk-on definition: An identifiable non-speaking artist, except that background speech or noise shall not be deemed to be speaking in this context, who shall be required to act individually in medium shot, or more closely, a special function peculiar only to the role, trade or calling that the character is supposed to portray and/or who, at the same time that his/her movements are recorded, is subject to individual direction and has a direct relationship with an actor (ie visual Featured Artist) who is performing his/her part as directed. A walk-on role could be removed from the narrative of the context and the story of the piece would still work.\n\nAn appropriate test of whether ‘an individual role plays an essential part’ in telling the commercial story is to ask whether or not the performance could be removed from the commercial without compromising the relaying of the commercial story. If it can, then the artist is not a Featured Visual Artist; if it cannot, then the artist is a Featured Visual Artist.\n\nFeatured definition:\n\nA Featured Visual Artist is someone whose individual performance plays an essential part in how the commercial story is relayed to the viewer. In applying the definition of a Featured Visual Artist to any artist’s contribution in a commercial, it is understood that the artist’s performance will be assessed against these guidelines and the artist’s contribution to the overall presentation of the commercial.\n\nCommercial Upgrades important note: It is possible you may be booked as a background artist and then upgraded to a walk on role. However, this upgrade ALWAYS depends on the final edit of the content and discretion of the production and not on the actions or direction taken on the day."
