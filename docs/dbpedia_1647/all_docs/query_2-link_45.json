        "text": "God is a God of what Tolkien called eucatastrophe; in other words, He’s an eleventh hour God. When you think everything is falling in around you, He will bring victory at the last minute. Maybe you’re sick and you don’t know how you’re going to get well, or maybe you feel like your marriage is caving in; don’t lose hope because God loves to do the miraculous, just in the nick of time! Like raising Lazarus from the dead even though He could have healed him while he was still alive, it can be annoying when Jesus acts last-minute, but an undying faith in the midst of uncertainty pleases Him.\n\nI remember when I had just graduated from high school and God put it on my heart to take a missions trip to Russia to visit a camp for orphans. The cost of the trip was $3,700, but to me, it may as well have been a bazillion dollars — it sounded impossible. To make it worse, I only had three weeks to raise the money. I said, “Lord, if this is from you, I’m just going to take the first step and get out of the boat. I’m simply going to try.” After that, I started asking people in my church for money, but nobody gave me anything. Then I began working — washing cars, laying railroad ties, and anything else I could find to do, but I was still nowhere near having the full amount. With only $67 in my pocket, I prayed again, and the next day, I got an envelope in the mail from someone I didn’t even know with a check for $300 in it. As the days went on, I got more and more of these envelopes with my name on them with checks inside, and I was praising God because to me, they were like manna from Heaven. It turns out, my mom had sent graduation announcements to about 500 people, but she didn’t tell me. When all was said and done, I ended up getting about $4,000 from people all over the world in this eucatastrophe event, and it was a sign for me.\n\nThis is how God does things, my friend. If you have the vision, He has the power and the resources. His timing isn’t always your timing, but you can listen, trust and remember that He’s calling you to do great things, in Jesus’ Name!"
