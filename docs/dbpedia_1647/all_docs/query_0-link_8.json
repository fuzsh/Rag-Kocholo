        "text": "The BBC has acquired crime drama series Rebus, a new adaptation of the best-selling Inspector Rebus novels by Scottish author Ian Rankin, starring Richard Rankin (Outlander, The Replacement) in the lead role.\n\nAdapted for the small screen by Gregory Burke (´71, Six Four) and produced by Eleventh Hour Films for Nordic streamer Viaplay, the six-part series will air on the U.K. public broadcaster’s flagship network BBC One, BBC Scotland and streamer BBC iPlayer this spring.\n\nRebus has been seen on the screen and stage before. An ITV series ran for four seasons from 2000 until 2007. The fictional inspector has also been featured in radio and theater adaptations.\n\nThe show features a younger, and recently divorced and demoted, protagonist. Set in Edinburgh, it “reimagines John Rebus as a younger Detective Sergeant drawn into a violent criminal conflict that turns personal when his brother Michael, a former soldier, crosses the line into criminality,” according to a plot description. “Rebus finds himself torn between protecting his brother and enforcing the law to bring Michael to justice. This epic series explores family, morality and class through an emotionally-charged story, set against the Scottish landmarks that Rankin’s readers know so well.”\n\nFilming took place in Glasgow and Edinburgh last year. Alongside Richard Rankin, who is not related to the author of the novels, the series also stars Lucie Shorthouse (Line of Duty, Ten Percent), Brian Ferguson (The Ipcress File, Spanish Princess), Amy Manson (The Nevers, The Diplomat), Neshla Caplan (The Rig, Scot Squad), Noof Ousellam (Vigil, Guilt), Stuart Bowman (The Serpent, Bodyguard), Caroline Lee Johnson (Trying, Ridley), Sean Buchanan (Censor, Mary Queen of Scots), Thoren Ferguson (The Midwich Cuckoos) and Michelle Duncan (Baptise, Elizabeth Is Missing).\n\nSaid author Ian Rankin: “I’m thrilled that Rebus is coming to the BBC. A great cast and a compelling story — I really can’t wait for viewers to see it.”\n\nSue Deeks, head of program acquisition at the BBC, lauded “this exciting new incarnation of Ian Rankin’s iconic character,” adding: “Viewers can expect compelling storylines, complex characters and an enjoyable mix of action, wit and humor.”\n\nSaid Sandra McFadden, head of business, BBC Scotland Commissioning: “Rebus of course needs no introduction, being one of Scotland’s most prolific literary characters, but we’re thrilled to be bringing this new television adaptation, starring Richard Rankin, to our audiences in Scotland and across the U.K.”\n\nRebus features six 45-minute episodes. It is directed by Niall MacCormick (Complicit, The Victim, Wallander) and Fiona Walton (Shetland, Annika) and produced by Angela Murray. Paula Cuddy, Jill Green, Eve Gutierrez, Tomas Axelsson, Isabelle Hultén, MacCormick, Burke and Ian Rankin are the executive producers. Rebus is distributed internationally by Viaplay Content Distribution."
