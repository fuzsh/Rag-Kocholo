        "text": "A new producer, a new companion and a new Doctor. With all this change, it’s still the same old approach… just done right. Moffat proves that he’s the man for the job and Matt Smith is the modern Doctor that we have all been waiting for.\n\nDoctor Who and the Eleventh Hour\n\nSeries 05, Story 01\n\n3 April, 2010\n\nPreface:\n\nAfter four years of David Tennant, Russel T Davies and the bombastic music of Murray Gold I had was ready to throw in the towel on the new Doctor Who.\n\nI quite enjoyed the first season for all its many flaws thanks to the excellent performance of Chris Eccleston as the Doctor. He brought a certain street-level credibility to the program. The Doctor in the 2005 series was an angst-ridden and neurotic mess who encouraged change in others rather than taking any direct action himself. In the finale, the Doctor was driven into a rage so profound that he nearly blew up the Daleks entirely. The first season was a great story arc carefully crafted. Even with the mis-steps it worked. The humor was a bit off, the stories were a mixed bag of inspired and woeful, but as an oddity it worked. As the beginning of a comeback for Doctor Who, I’m not so sure.\n\nThe second series made what is in my opinion a major mistake of bridging the gap between the classic and new series by having the Doctor meet K-9 and Sarah Jane Smith. The new series just doesn’t feel like the old one to me due to the incessant pop culture references, focus on hastily created background characters and a completely out of character version of the Doctor. One can certainly make a case for any other ‘era’ of the previous classic program also deviating from what one would term as classic Who, but this series functions so much better as its own beast in my opinion. But the damage was done and there’s no sense going on about it. The tenth Doctor was all teeth, bugged out eyes and crazy gelled-up hair (like Tom Baker seen through the eyes of a contemporary tabloid). Doctor No. 10 was presented by RTD as a messianic figure (even flanked by Angels in one story) who everyone loved yet he pined for his lost love like an emotional teenager… the only woman with bigger teeth than him, Rose Tyler. Stories became more overblown and more poorly constructed each successive year. The romance between the Doctor and Rose took precedence over everything else, even when she was no longer on the program. Pacing was dreadful, comedy was tasteless or corny and the direction ranged from inspired to embarrassing. In several stories we were treated to an array of newscasters telling us what was happening right in front of our eyes, breaking any dramatic tension that the story hoped to create. It was a mess.\n\nI could go on, but I’ve said a lot of this in previous posts about my problems with RTD’s vision of Doctor Who. Besides, I’m actually happy about the Eleventh Hour. Consider the above my closing statement on the RTD era.\n\nThe new deal:\n\nNebula Award-winning writer Steven Moffat has taken the reigns of producer and head writer from RTD this year. Introducing the first new opening sequence in 5 years and new signature tune, Moffat’s era also begins with a new TARDIS interior, new companion and of course a new Doctor, this time played by 26 year-old Matt Smith.\n\nThe youngest actor to ever play the part, Matt is a former rugby player who turned to acting after an injury. Reading all of the press leading up to the first episode of his run as the Doctor I rolled my eyes at the ‘my mum said I should be the Doctor because I have that scarf’ and going about his departed cat as his best mate as twee nonsense. But I was wrong. He is a genuine eccentric. As I covered in my previous posts over the weekend, part of the problem in casting the lead in Doctor Who is that you are not just looking for an actor, you are looking for an odd type of person. This lead to several key casting successes and a few flops. Thanks to the many comment posts to my blog, I know that David Tennant is well loved as the Doctor but he never worked for me, always straining every muscle in his body and speaking his lines through gritted teeth. It was too forced. Smith, however… is the real thing.\n\nMoffat has stated that he views Doctor Who as a fairy tale, a short leap from RTD’s view that Who is a Road Dahl storybook. While I disagree with both statements, Moffat at least has a gameplan for making this concept of Doctor Who as fantasy work. It’s easy to argue any number of points for a 40+ year-long program, one may view it as hard sci-fi, another as a comedy, still some think it is a kid’s program. Moffat is clearly taking hints from another successful TV Program, Sapphire and Steel, in his re-envisioning of the series… which is a good thing. Known for creating the sitcom Coupling and the thriller Jekyll, Moffat has also written some great Doctor Who scripts. If there was ever a chance of me enjoying the new Who, this was it.\n\nSeries 5 trailer\n\nSPOILERS AHOY for US viewers…\n\nThe Doctor crashes into a little girl’s backyard while she prays to Santa (???) for someone to come and see the crack in her wall. After a very funny comedic scene involving hilarious food gags that takes the place of the ‘groggy Doctor tries to remember who he is’ routine that we are more than used to, the story cranks the action up. The crack is in reality a tear in reality housing something called ‘Prisoner Zero.’ The Doctor identifies the giant eyeball gazing out them as a guard, but is very curious about the crack and what it could mean. Before the Doctor can deal with the situation, he is called back to the TARDIS which is in the throes of rebirth as well. Promising to be back in five minutes, the Doctor takes off and returns… several years later. In that time the little girl has grown up into a bit of a mad young woman who has been waiting all this time for her imaginary friend to re-appear and whisk her away. She teams up with the Doctor and between the two of them (and with the help of a laptop and mobile phone), a crisis is averted. One of the more interesting moment occurs when Prisoner Zero is taken away by the Atraxi and as the space police speed away the Doctor calls them back, warning them that the planet is guarded… by him. A brief montage of previous Doctors flicker across the screen with Smith walking through the hologram at the end, establishing that he IS the Doctor. It’s a clever idea and for the first time knots together all of the Doctors without making it look forced or weird.\n\nKaren Gillan as Amy Pond is quite good, though she seems to get stick staring off with her mouth shut a lot. I swear that I saw her do this at least ten times in one episode alone. A former model, Gillan was apparently whisked away from a waitressing gig to be the new Who girl… no kidding. She has a lot of potential and could easily be the best companion of the program, and with Moffat as her creator I am sure that she will have an interesting story to tell.\n\nAll is not perfect, though. The Doctor is still a miraculous hero to all of humanity feared by monsters. Moffat has toned the messianic approach, reducing the Doctor instead into a folklore hero, slayer of monsters and no-goodnicks the world over. The aliens are for some reason terrified of the Doctor on the spot which is a little silly. Cellular phones and laptops are used to save the day which was a dated idea when it was done in 1996’s Independence Day. The pacing is still a bit frenetic and the script still tells the viewer what is clearly happening on screen, but the Eleventh Hour is a clear improvement over what we have seen and that is largely due to Smith himself and the chemistry that he shares with Gillan.\n\nSmith’s take on the Doctor is very much in keeping with what we have already seen in Doctor’s No. 9 and 10, a frenetic anxious genius running from place to place with often nonsensical solutions to problems that make no sense. Even so, Smith makes it look natural. The Doctor is more practical than his predecessors and while he still uses his magic wand it is not to rapidly solve a problem as it has. In short, a lot of the same problems that I have had with the new series depiction of the Doctor are still there, just toned down and played better.\n\nEven though I think that he is wrong, the approach that Moffat has taken of treating Doctor Who as a fairy tale seems to work. Up to this point (with exceptions), the new Doctor Who has felt like glorified fan faction with a budget. This story is a step in the right direction of establishing the new series as its own thing. The season-long thread (silence will fall) is established and there is clearly a more complicated reason as to why the Doctor has chosen Amy Pond as his traveling companion other than just being lonely. There is a genuine excitement to the fifth season as everything really is brand new, including the TARDIS interior, easily the most lavish and creatively designed version to date (with the TV Movie a close second). I’m still annoyed at the goofy technology found on the console, but the program is convinced that the Doctor is whimsical and wacky, so that won’t go away.\n\nThe budget is noticeably smaller than it has been in some time with the CGi work very poor. Moffat has stated in interviews that he is not bothered by the drop in money as it forces the production team to stress creative ways to convey ideas rather than just a special effect. In telling a friend the plot of the story (inter-dimensional prison in a little girl’s wall, giant eyeball peering out), he was very intrigued. The ideas are great and the execution is only slightly off. I can live with that. That’s Doctor Who.\n\nAll in all… the first watchable episode in quite some time. I’m glad I stuck around to see the 11th Doctor and hope that the season keeps up this quality."
