        "text": "Background\n\nITV Studios Global Distribution Limited is the international distribution unit of ITV Studios. With the retirement of the Granada brand, ITV renamed Granada International Media Limited as ITV Global Entertainment Limited in September 2008, trading as ITV Studios Global Entertainment. In January 2020, the division was renamed ITV Studios Global Distribution Limited .\n\n1st Logo (2009-2013)\n\nVisuals: Same as the 2009 ITV Studios logo, but with \"Global Entertainment\" below.\n\nVariants:\n\nA white background version exists, which is used for the video game adaptation of Nanny 911, with \"Global Entertainment\" written below.\n\nA similar version with only \"GLOBAL\" exists, which appears on Countdown for the Nintendo DS and is also seen on some shows such as Demsey and Makepeace and some movies like The Red Shoes.\n\nA B&W variant of this logo also exists, which is seen on A Night to Remember (1958) on the Blu-ray release thereof. Though some, may use the color version instead.\n\nOn the last-two seasons of Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids (titled Grizzly Tales at this point), the logo is next to the Grizzly TV, Honeycomb Animation, Elephant Productions and Nicktoons logos.\n\nA 4:3 version of this logo exists.\n\nA still variant of this logo also exists, which is seen on ITV4 airings of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes episode \"The Solitary Cyclist\".\n\nTechnique: CGI by Mammal Design.\n\nAudio: The ending theme of the programme or none.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn DVD and Blu-ray releases, the audio from the 2010 ITV Studios Home Entertainment logo is heard.\n\nOn a November 10, 2022 UK airing of Countess Dracula (1971) on LEGEND, the logo is silent.\n\nAvailability: Seen on ITV plc programmes during the time-period until 2013, and was used as an plaster method. Sometimes, it also appears on DVD releases.\n\nIt also plasters over previous logos on newer prints of older ITV shows (mainly those from Granada).\n\nHowever, it has since been plastered over with the 2013 version, though some prints may still have it intact.\n\nIt also appears as a de-facto home video logo for ITV Studios Home Entertainment, and sometimes take the place of the latter logo as well such as disc 2-6 of later copies of Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons: The Complete Collection since after 2010.\n\nIt is also seen on American Pocoyo DVD releases by NCircle Entertainment (by the time the show aired on Nick Jr. from 2011-2015).\n\nIt was also seen at the end of a September 11, 2022 airing of Wycliffe and the Cycle of Death on ITV3.\n\nIt was also seen at the start and end of a November 10, 2022 UK airing of Countess Dracula (1971) on LEGEND.\n\nThe \"GLOBAL\" variant has only been sighted on ITV4 airings of It's Tommy Cooper, some Dempsey and Makepeace episodes, the 2009 TV movie Held Hostage on Amazon Prime Video, the Criterion Collection releases of The Red Shoes and Black Narcissius, a Movie Channel airing of Friendly Fire (1979), The Last Warrior on Tubi, and Multicom's print of the 1998 TV movie When He Didn't Come Home (aka The Disappearing Act).\n\n2nd Logo (January 14, 2013-2021)\n\nVisuals: Same as the 2013 ITV Studios logo, but with the words \"GLOBAL ENTERTAINMENT\" below. It also plays a bit slower than the standard logo.\n\nVariants:\n\nA B&W variant exists. Though some, like current prints of The Square Peg (1959), use the colour version instead.\n\nA shortened version of this logo also exists.\n\nA still version of this logo exists.\n\nA 4:3 version of this logo exists.\n\nAn in-credit version exists.\n\nOn Keep it Spotless, a very sped-up version is used which also exists.\n\nTechnique: Computer animation.\n\nAudio: The three-note synth theme from the ITV Studios logo, or the ending theme of the show.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nSome shows might have the end theme of the show playing over it (episodes of Knightmare on Challenge have the end of the show's theme playing over it).\n\nAn extended version of the theme exists, which has the notes drawn longer.\n\nBoth high tone and low tone variants also exist.\n\nAt the end of current prints of at least two episodes of the 1960's classic television series The Prisoner titled \"A Change of Mind\" and \"Fall Out\", respectively, the end of the music from the 1987 ITC Entertainment \"Gold Diamonds\" logo can be heard before the logo begins.\n\nSometimes, the logo is silent.\n\nAvailability: Again, this logo is seen on ITV programmes and home media releases from the time-period until 2021.\n\nIt is also seen at the beginning of ITV home media releases in the UK.\n\nIt is also seen on DVD releases of ITV content in other countries released under license by third-party companies (e.g., U.S. Hell's Kitchen DVD releases).\n\nOn television, this is normally used to plaster older logos.\n\nIt plasters the Anglia logo on the first two seasons of Knightmare (seasons 3 and 4 retain the 1989 \"Anglia Production for ITV\" endcap) and the Central logo on various episodes of Family Fortunes on Challenge (although recent airings have reinstated the Central logo), as well as the 1994 series of Blockbusters on the same channel.\n\nAs of recent, this also plasters the 2009 ITV Studios logo on 2010-2013 episodes of The Chase when reran on Challenge.\n\nThis variant also plasters the 2004 Granada America logo (and possibly others) on Virgin Media One/Two/Three Ireland airings of most made-for-TV movies whenever they air on the network.\n\nIt can also occasionally be seen plastering original Yorkshire Television endcaps on Heartbeat and The Royal on ITV3.\n\nIt is also seen at the beginning (and sometimes end) of many films from the ITV library, including films from ITC and The Rank Organisation.\n\nIt is also seen at the end of Hands of the Ripper and a late-2010s print of the 2008 TV movie Husband for Hire on Tubi.\n\nThis logo is also seen on newer prints of shows, movies and documentaries that were produced by ITV Studios, its units or other companies like shows produced by its predecessors Granada and Carlton, and is also seen on shows that were produced by ITC Entertainment.\n\nThis logo is also strangely seen at the beginning and end of current prints of at least two episodes of the 1960's classic television series The Prisoner titled \"A Change of Mind\" and \"Fall Out\" (the last ever episode).\n\nIt is also seen at the end of an Amazon print of Doppelganger (1993), following the 1987 ITC Entertainment \"Gold Diamonds\" logo.\n\nThis logo does not appear on Britbox prints of the fifth and sixth seasons of The Saint, as they instead use older prints (1990s-era) with the 1987 ITC Entertainment \"Gold Diamonds\" logo or no logo at all.\n\nIt is also seen on a later print of The Saint episode \"A Double in Diamonds\", following the 1999 Carlton International logo.\n\nIt is also seen at the end of the Britbox print of We Dive at Dawn (1942), which has the 1999 Carlton International logo at the start, due to the Britbox print being based on the Carlton International-era print, though the 2015 UK DVD release of the film from Strawberry Media has this plastering the General Film Distributors logo instead.\n\nIt is also seen at the end of the ITVX print of Vendetta for The Saint (1969), following the black standalone in-credit background variant of the 1973 ITC Entertainment logo.\n\nIt was also seen on Murdoch Mysteries until 2020, Keep it Spotless, Schiit's Creek and Good Which until 2020.\n\nIt is also seen on all three seasons of Poldark, the first five seasons of Shetland, the Blu-ray release of My Left Foot and was also seen on a 2021 episode of Love Island South Africa.\n\nThe B&W variant was mainly used to plaster over logos on shows that were in black and white, such as the black and white episodes of Upstairs, Downstairs.\n\nOn DVD reprints, although this logo appears on the packaging (and sometimes on the disc labels), it does not appear on-screen on them. ITV normally reuses previous DVD prints for re-releases, and so older logos (eg, Carlton Visual Entertainment, Granada Ventures, ITV DVD, ITV Studios Home Entertainment, etc.) will be preserved. The same goes for releases licensed to Network Distributing.\n\nIt is also seen on the 2013 version of Carry On: The Ultimate Collection, which is not a reprint of an earlier release.\n\nIt was also seen at the end of a December 27, 2022 UK airing of Saturn 3 (1980) on LEGEND.\n\nIt is also seen on recent airings of the TV movies such as Outrage on Virgin Media Two and Goodnight Mister Tom on ITV3.\n\nOccasionally, it follows an older ITV endcap, with one example being the Britbox streaming print of S8E01 of A Touch of Frost, which has the logo following the 1999 Yorkshire Television endcap.\n\nIt is also seen at the start of a Sky Go New Zealand streaming print of Richard III (1955), following the 2011 StudioCanal logo with the Canal+ byline.\n\nIt is also seen at the end of a UKTV Play streaming print of S04E01 of Soldier Soldier titled \"Stormy Weather\", plastering the 1994 A Central Programme for ITV variant of the 3rd logo.\n\nFinal Note\n\nAfter the name change to ITV Studios Global Distribution, programmes and home media releases now use the 3rd ITV Studios logo instead with no Global Distribution identifier."
