        "text": "European television has a double connotation: it characterizes both the history and current existence of multiple television institutions and channels across Europe as well as the phenomenon of transnational, European television. Reaffirming the concept of Europe as “unity in diversity” and acknowledging the contested nature of Europe as a discursive character, both television and Europe can best be defined as projects that need to be continuously renegotiated and reinvented. Both “Europe” and “television” as concepts are constructed entities whose identities vary depending on the topic of inquiry and the roster of questions of those investigating the phenomena. Europe as a discursive construction has been instrumentalized from a multitude of angles (historical, religious, geographical, political, and cultural), and television has been approached as being essentially a technology, an institution, an art, or simply a form of popular entertainment. Historically speaking, the first regular television services started before World War II in Germany (1935) and Great Britain, but the late 1950s and early 1960s marked the real take off of television as a mass medium in most European countries. Transnational television in Europe started with the launch of Eurovision, the organization for the exchange of television programs within the European Broadcasting Union. Until the advent of the so-called dual broadcasting systems in the 1980s, most European countries had public service television institutions, financed by broadcasting fees. The start of commercial television and the advent of satellite broadcasting in the 1980s radically changed the European television landscape. This bibliography aims at offering guidance to the technical, economic, political, and cultural factors that shaped European television since its emergence in the late 1930s. It tries to pay equal attention to both important transnational developments and to specificities of national television cultures.\n\nThe history of European televisions’ commercialization is interesting and complex. In many European countries, early attempts to launch some form of private television took place on a local, national, or even supra-national basis. The process of television commercialization in Europe didn’t just start during the 1980s. Its implementation happened from the very beginning, and followed very different paths in each country. This issue on the History of Private and Commercial Television in Europe may help deepen our understanding of how the commercialization of television has shaped media culture in Europe. It offers a scholarly view on the history of private and commercial television in Europe, addressing institutional, technological, political, and cultural perspectives, and their entanglement, so as to allow for transnational comparison.\n\nOver 20 years, the European Journal of Cultural Studies has been an important resource for those writing and thinking about television, and this article reflects on the rich material contained in the long run of issues published since 1998. As part of ‘On the Move’, the Special Issue to mark the 20th anniversary of the journal, it also introduces the special online dossier of articles on television. It offers an impressionistic reflection on the author’s experiences of engaging with work on television as it has appeared in this journal. In homage to Raymond Williams, that great writer about television (and much else), this article focuses on three key words which seem crucial to this enterprise – journal, television and European.\n\nThis article claims that the emergence of television in the 1950s must be interpreted as a conservative media revolution. It aims at revisiting some of the popular narratives about the emergence of television as a revolutionary moment in media history and questions the newness of television in the European mass media ensemble. Focusing on a set of privileged sites of negotiation where the tensions between the conservative and modernising agencies of the medium became most visible or explicit, the article emphasizes the ambiguous and contested nature of television as a new medium. Finally, the author pleas for an integral approach to media history that studies the intermedial relationships and interdependencies between television and other mass media.\n\ntextabstractThe EUscreen project represents the European television archives and acts as a domain aggregator for Europeana, Europe’s digital library. The main motivation for it is to provide unified access to a representative collection of television programs, secondary sources, and articles, and in this way to allow students, scholars, and the general public to study the history of television in its wider context. In this paper, we present the various issues that were addressed in order to accomplish the challenging task of publishing Europe’s television heritage as Linked Data.\n\nThis chapter aims to broaden the perspective on the history of television by exploring the relations between Europe’s two main broadcasting organisations during the Cold War: the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and the International Organization of Radio and Television (OIRT). In particular, the chapter demonstrates how the EBU and the OIRT were involved in fierce competition during the 1950s and 1960s, trying to present themselves as the leading broadcasting organizations in the global arena. At the same time, they established a common framework for the production and transmission of live transnational television in Europe, resulting in the linking of their respective networks and the inauguration of a live cross-border television network covering the entire continent in spring 1961. The analysis of these relations demonstrates two things. First, early television history had a transnational dimension that is often neglected in the predominantly national narratives of television history. Second, the relations between broadcasting organizations counter the image of a divided Cold War Europe with a rigid East-West binary."
