        "text": "Sony Pictures Television backed Eleventh Hour Films has secured the screen rights to best-selling author Jane Casey’s upcoming thriller ‘The Killing Kind’, ahead of publication today.\n\nFilmmakers and screenwriters Zara Hayes and Jonathan Stewart will adapt The Killing Kind for screen. They will co-write, with Hayes set to direct. Author Jane Casey serves as Executive Producer on the adaptation, alongside Jill Green, Eve Gutierrez and Paula Cuddy from Eleventh Hour Films.\n\nHayes is a British filmmaker who works between the UK and the USA and is currently shooting SHOWTRIAL for BBC One, a five-part legal thriller about a young woman accused of murder. Her narrative feature debut, POMS, a comedy drama starring Diane Keaton and Jacki Weaver, was widely theatrically released across the US by STX Films in 2019. Previously Hayes directed the critically acclaimed Billie Jean King feature documentary BATTLE OF THE SEXES. Her documentary work includes the National Geographic event series DIAN FOSSEY: SECRETS IN THE MIST, executive produced and narrated by Sigourney Weaver; CAPTIVE for Netflix, executive produced by Doug Liman about the murky world of hostage-taking; 12 YEAR OLD LIFER for Channel 4; and CLOTHES TO DIE FOR on BBC Two.\n\nStewart is a Brit who works in the UK and the USA with a pedigree for developing thrillers for the screen. He is currently developing Les Standiford’s MEET YOU IN HELL as a television series, and an original thriller feature for AGC Studios. Other credits include co-writing JD Dillard’s Korean war feature DEVOTION, currently in post-production. He is also writing an original series with Hayes for Sky Studios.\n\nJane Casey has written eleven crime novels for adults and three for teenagers. The Maeve Kerrigan series has been nominated for many awards: in 2015 Jane won the Mary Higgins Clark Award for The Stranger You Know and Irish Crime Novel of the Year for After the Fire. In 2019, Cruel Acts was chosen as Irish Crime Novel of the Year at the Irish Book Awards and was a Sunday Times bestseller. The Killing Kind is her latest novel.\n\nPaula Cuddy, Creative Director, Eleventh Hour Films, said “The Killing Kind is an exceptional thriller from the brilliant Jane Casey, which delivers the twists, turns and emotion to grip a global TV audience. Ingrid is a compelling protagonist, whose story is most timely as she navigates professional and personal ethics, her journey making us question ‘justice’ in every sense. We are delighted to be bringing this to screen and with the brilliant Zara Hayes and Jonathan Stewart on board we couldn’t be in better hands.”\n\nZara Hayes says “I’m always looking to tell stories with compelling and complex female characters front and centre. When I read The Killing Kind it felt like the perfect fit. Jane’s book is a gripping, twisty thriller, all told through the eyes of Ingrid – a richly layered, intelligent woman who is working out what success means on her own terms. I’m so happy to be able to bring my previous experience both in documentary and drama to work with Jonathan, Jane and Eleventh Hour to create a series that captures the spirit of the book”\n\nJonathan Stewart said “Jane’s book is both a joyride of a mystery for viewers and a powerful character-driven investigation of the thin line between those you can trust the most and those so close they can dangerously deceive you. Collaborating with Eleventh Hour, Paula, Jane and Zara is a true honour.”\n\nJane Casey, author of The Killing Kind, says “I am thrilled to be working with such an incredible team to bring The Killing Kind to TV. Having had amazing support from United Agents and HarperCollins in developing the book from my original idea, I’m delighted to see it published today. Zara and Jonathan’s creative response to the book is enormously exciting and I look forward to working with them, Paula Cuddy and the team at Eleventh Hour Films to tell Ingrid’s story in a new way.”\n\nThe deal was brokered by Jennifer Thomas on behalf of Ariella Feiner at United Agents. Zara Hayes is represented by United Agents and WME, and Jonathan Stewart is represented by 42, Grandview and CAA.\n\nJon Creamer\n\nShare this story"
