        "text": "Fox’s J.J. Abrams’ thriller “Fringe” and CBS’ Jerry Bruckheimer procedural drama “Eleventh Hour” will be the highest-rated new shows, while NBC’s “Kath & Kim” and CBS’ “Worst Week” will prove to be weak links in their respective comedy blocks.\n\nThat’s according to an annual television report by Horizon Media that includes speculative estimates of how every broadcast show will fare in the fall.\n\nThe analysis contained some expected claims — that established hits as ABC’s “Grey’s Anatomy,” NBC’s “Heroes” and CBS’ “Survivor” will continue to rule their time periods.\n\nBut there also were some surprises, with the report suggesting that a certain network will overthrow CBS on Fridays and that one under-the-radar sitcom will break out. How CW’s “90210,” NBC’s “Knight Rider” and others are expected to perform this fall are after the jump.\n\nIn general, the report was skeptical about how new shows in generalwould stack up against competitors; not one new show is expected to winits time period in the adults 18-49 demographic.\n\nAfter “Eleventh” and “Fringe,” Horizon had David E. Kelley’s upcomingdrama “Life on Mars” as the third-highest-rated new show, yet it alsoexpects “Mars” to continue ABC’s streak of coming in last place at 10p.m. Thursdays despite its “Grey’s” lead-in.\n\nThe CW’s “90210” is expected to outshine the network’s currentbuzz-heavy “Gossip Girl,” but not break the network into a new ratingsstratosphere.\n\nTuesday night’s new unscripted shows — NBC’s documentary series”America’s Toughest Jobs” and ABC’s Tuesday night game show”Opportunity Knocks” — are expected to come in last place in theirrespective time periods among the major networks. The study likewisesuggested that CBS’ new strategy of opening\n\nWednesday night with a comedy hour featuring “The New Adventures of Old Christine” and “Project Gary” will have a rough time.\n\nThe report gave unexpectedly high marks to Fox’s sitcom “Do NotDisturb,” however, expecting the show to build greatly on its weak “’Til Death” lead-in Wednesday nights.\n\nWith ABC shifting reality veterans “Wife Swap” and “Supernanny” toFridays in the fall, the report speculated that the network will takecontrol of the evening from longtime winner CBS. Although CBS’ “GhostWhisperer” and “Numbers” are expected to win their time periods(including besting NBC’s new drama “Crusoe”), the report has ABC’s”Supernanny” trouncing the new drama “The Ex List” in the former”Moonlight” slot to tip the scale.\n\nRounding out the fall freshman shows, Horizon predicts that CBS’ “TheMentalist,” NBC’s “My Own Worst Enemy” and the CW’s “Stylista” toperform solidly but has low expectations for NBC’s “Knight Rider” andthe CW’s “Surviving the Filthy Rich.”"
