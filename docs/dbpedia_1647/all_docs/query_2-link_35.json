        "text": "Sony Pictures Television (SPT)-backed Eleventh Hour Films is adapting author CM Ewan’s newly published thriller The House Hunt as a limited series.\n\nThe book, published today in the UK by Pan Macmillan, follows an everyday young couple as they prepare to sell their recently renovated dream house, but things take a turn when a potential buyer reveals something inconceivable and events spiral out of control.\n\nPaula Cuddy, Eve Gutierrez and Jill Green from Eleventh Hour Films will serve as executive producers on the adaptation alongside Ewan. The House Hunt will be published in the US by Grand Central Publishing in 2024.\n\nEwan is the critically acclaimed and bestselling author of many mystery and thriller novels, including The Interview and A Window Breaks. The option deal was struck by WME on behalf of the Darley Anderson Literary Agency.\n\nIt comes ahead of the release of Eleventh Hour Films’ forthcoming drama series The Killing Kind, based on the novel by Jane Casey, on Paramount+ UK on September 7.\n\nCuddy, creative director, and Gutierrez, executive producer and head of talent at Eleventh Hour Films, said in a joint statement: “Chris takes a relatable, ordinary situation and masterfully tilts it on a knife edge, delivering a tense and gripping story that twists and turns to the very end.”"
