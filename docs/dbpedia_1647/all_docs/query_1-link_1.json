        "text": "ER Vet McCrane on Directing Miami Medical: I Avoided the Helicopters\n\nWhile directing Friday's episode of Miami Medical, former ER star Paul McCrane made sure of one thing. &nbsp;\"There are helicopters in Miami Medical,\" McCrane says with a laugh, \"but fortunately I stayed far away.\" Check out photos of the Miami Medical cast McCrane, of course, played ER's Dr. Robert Romano, who lost his arm when he backed into the tail rotor blade of a chopper. One season later, McCrane's character was killed off when another helicopter crashed in the ambulance bay, crushing him.\n\nMega Buzz on Chuck, Gossip Girl, Without a Trace, True Blood and More!\n\nEvery week, senior editors Matt Webb Mitovich, Mickey O'Connor and Tim Molloy satisfy your need for TV scoop. Please send all questions to megascoop@tvguide.com. Chuck deserves a whole season, not just 13 episodes. Any chance of more? &mdash; DarrylMATT: Actually, yes. NBC entertainment president Ben Silverman says that while the current plan is to deliver 13 midseason episodes, depending on the ratings, \"we may extend it out and continue it through the summer,\" where he thinks it could pair nicely with Friday Night Lights. \"We're looking to ... keep [Chuck] incredibly viral and buzz-worthy until it returns, and then hopefully have it on our air for many years to come.\" That'd be Awesome. And even more so? I chatted up Scott Bakula at TNT's upfronts luncheon, and he's game for more Chuck, if need be. Any scoop on Gossip Girl's Season 3? &mdash; F.R.MICKEY: Speaking with TVGuide.com at the CW upfronts, Leighton Meester seemed to confirm that Georgina's plan to ...\n\nFall TV: CBS Adds Eight New Series, Makes Big (and Medium!) Changes\n\nCBS announced eight brand-new series for the 2009-10 TV season, including ones starring Chris O'Donnell, LL Cool J, Julianna Margulies and Alex O'Loughlin, and swooped in and picked up NBC's castoff Medium. The Eye ordered a full 22-episode season of Medium, slotting it after Ghost Whisperer on Fridays. As CBS entertainment boss Nina Tassler says, \"If Ghost Whisperer and Numbers had an offspring, Medium would be it.\" CBS also has tinkered with its Monday lineup in unexpected ways. How I Met Your Mother will now ...\n\nMega Buzz on Lost, Heroes, 90210, House, Supernatural & More!\n\nEvery week, senior editors Matt Webb Mitovich, Mickey O'Connor and Tim Molloy satisfy your need for TV scoop. Please send all questions&nbsp;to megascoop@tvguide.com. I like Sawyer and I love Juliet, but I really need this Sawyer/Juliet thing to be over soon on Lost. &mdash; ClaudiaMATT: I on the other hand have taken a shine to \"Suliet,\" so it is with some glee that I tell you that there will be a bit more idyllic \"playing of the house\" &mdash; as well as a little smooching! &mdash; before the action-packed ramp-up to the May 13 season finale. It kind of makes you wonder to whom Kate might turn since Jack, I am hearing, is going to only become more unlikable. Please bring Heroes' Daphne back.&nbsp; She was a super hero, and her complex personality and fantastic look made her one of my favorites. &mdash; CordialeaTIM: Brea Grant's speedster may return in some capacity, but you'll have to accept that she is, in the words of imaginary flying partner Greg Grunberg ...\n\nMega Buzz on 24, Heroes, SVU, Without a Trace and More\n\nSenior editors Matt Mitovich, Mickey O'Connor and Tim Molloy answer your questions. Speaking of questions, we invite you to drop us a line at megascoop@tvguide.com. 24 is totally back on track, but the one downside is Sean. I don't know whether it's the actor or the writing, but I do know I want that guy gone. Anything coming up that would make me a happy camper? &mdash; MikeMATT: I suppose it would depend on whether Sean (aka he who has since been revealed as Moley McMoleberg) is truly traitorous or a red herring a la Season 6's Nadia. My own moles (none of whom are played by Rhys Coiro, mind you) tell me that Agent Hillinger's fate may be cinched during the game-changing back-to-back episodes airing March 2.&nbsp; Please tell this Heroes fan that somehow Hiro or Peter will get the power to travel through time again so that they can go back and save Daphne. &mdash; AshleyTIM: Good concept, but Heroes has promised us ..."
