Network TV series, just like films, are a collaborative effort, but it must be noted that producer and director Peter Tewksbury deserves the lion's share of the credit for these beautifully crafted episodes. Directing every single episode of this first season (a sizeable logistical feat, even had the episodes turned out to be mediocre - which they most certainly are not), Tewksbury displays a fluid camera style (and, by design I would imagine, the footage for seamless editing) that resembles a particularly accomplished feature film, not a rushed, weekly TV series.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Dick Powell Theatre,\" also known as \"The Dick Powell Show,\" was an anthology series hosted by Powell.\n\nCategory: Television program\n\nYear: 1963\n\nStarred: Dick Powell and many guests, since it was an anthology series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Mister Ed\" is one of those shows where the theme song is probably known by people who have never seen it.\n\nCategory: Television series - Comedy\n\nYear: 1963\n\nStarred: Mister Ed, Alan Young, Connie Hines\n\nPaul Mavis wrote for DVD Talk:\n\n\"I've never understood why Mister Ed, as well as other series from the later, so-called \"fantasy period\" of middle-60s network television programming, has garnered only grudging respect at times from critics and historians. Is it because the central plot element - a talking horse - is just too ridiculous to be taken seriously? Stretching that point a bit, I don't see why that should be, when logic-straining fantasies like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are regarded with almost Talmudic reverence today (if you're wondering whether or not I'm directly comparing Mister Ed to Harry Potter, I'm not...but I know which one I'd prefer to watch, too, ten times out of ten). Maybe it's because it's a sitcom - probably the least well-regarded genre on television (next to game shows), owing to that age-old prejudice here with American critics where comedy somehow is seen as intrinsically less \"worthy\" than drama. Maybe these critics and historians are suspicious of the experience itself.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Danny Kaye Show\" saw the star of big-budget Technicolor musicals bring his talents to a small-screen weekly variety show.\n\nCategory: Television series - Variety\n\nYear: 1964\n\nStarred: Danny Kaye\n\nJustin Remer wrote for DVD Talk,\n\n\"The first disc highlights three episodes from the show's Emmy-winning first season.

Mission: Impossible stood out from the pack because it was more high-toned and buttoned-down. Originally developed in the early ’60s by writer Bruce Geller as a pitch for a classy caper film (similar to director Jules Dassin’s contemporaneous worldwide hits Rififi and Topkapi), Mission: Impossible was itself something of an impossibility: a weekly hour-long adventure series about a loose-knit group of covert agents with unusual specialties, working together to defuse insanely complicated international crises. Geller—who only wrote the pilot—left his show’s creative team with a difficult weekly challenge, to come up with thorny problems and clever solutions. Yet for 171 episodes spread across seven seasons, from ’66 to ’73, the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) busted up terrorist cells, humiliated mob bosses, and thwarted communist dictators by using disguises, deception, split-second timing, and switcheroos.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Rowan and Martin’s Laugh-In\" brought a new rapid-fire style of comedy to American households.\n\nCategory: Television series\n\nYear: 1969\n\nStarred: Dan Rowan, Dick Martin, Ruth Buzzi, Gary Owens\n\nJoe Corey wrote for Inside Pulse:\n\n\"When Ernie Kovacs passed away in 1962, comedy on television stepped back from pushing the boundaries of technology and settled back into a comfort zone. Most variety shows followed the simple formula of host monologue, long sketches with celebrities, guest musical act and stand up routine. It was the classic put on a stage show mentality. All of that changed on September 9, 1967 when NBC threw away the recipe and gave an hour of primetime to two nightclub comics and a supporting cast of around a dozen players. The show was rapid fire as it would cut away to gags and jokes that didn’t require a six-minute sketch to get to the punchline. 'Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In' was a shock to the system, but quickly became a hit and changed the way comedy was approached. The fast edits pushed video editing.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Marcus Welby, M.D.\" featured one of Steven Spielberg’s earliest turns at directing during its first season.\n\nCategory: Television series\n\nYear: 1970\n\nStarred: Robert Young, James Brolin, Elena Verdugo\n\nNoel Murray wrote for the AV Club:\n\n\"Much of what makes Marcus Welby, M.D. compelling even now has to do with those circa-1970 courses of treatment, delivered by a man who seemed to have a surprising amount of free time on his schedule, given his ever-growing roster of patients. Welby would encourage the mother of an autistic child to spank the boy frequently, he’d freely offer tranquilizers to a newly pregnant woman, and he’d order Brolin to lie to their patients for their own good… in short, he was an arrogant hothead, playing a risky game of \"Doctor Knows Best.\" But given the turbulence of the times, there was something wonderfully escapist about the show. The divorce rate was rising and kids were getting more disrespectful, but no matter whether people voted for Nixon or dropped acid in the Haight, they all got sick just the same. And while Marcus Welby couldn’t heal society, he could heal the people in it, one knee-jerk diagnosis at a time.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Carol Burnett Show\" is still beloved among fans of sketch shows.\n\nCategory: Television series - Musical or Comedy\n\nYears awarded: 1970, 1971\n\nStarred: Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, Harvey Korman, Lyle Waggoner\n\nUK TV fan site Television Heaven wrote:\n\n\"For an hour each week, Carol Burnett and her talented co-stars (Vicki Lawrence; Lyle Waggoner; Harvey Korman and (later) Tim Conway) spoofed everything from movies to commercials; performed in slice-of-life skits (one of which would later be a TV series of its own); and generally cracked each other up before the live studio audience that came for the taping of what became one of the USA's best loved comedy sketch shows of all time.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Medical Center\" starred James Daly and featured Edward G.

It was a throwaway line from an early episode, repurposed ad nauseam in clever TV Land ads that touted the series’ twice-a-day reruns during the late 1990s. But it captured the ethos of Mannix, a no-frills detective drama that was the template for a glut of crime series that choked the airwaves during the early ’70s (and Mannix was more a show of the ’70s than the ’60s, even though it debuted in 1967). Cannon was the fat private dick, Barnaby Jones was the old one, Longstreet was the blind (yes, blind) one. Mannix was the original model. Like the early seasons of ER or C.S.I., Mannix was put together with skill and care, but its mainstream success made it easy to take for granted.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Columbo\" became one of TV’s most memorable, relatable private detectives of all time.\n\nCategory: Drama\n\nYear: 1973\n\nStarred: Peter Falk\n\nGwen Ihnat wrote for the AV Club:\n\n\"Falk made the detective’s underdog appeal unforgettable. So much credit must be given to the way he completely inhabited the character; within an episode or two, viewers learned Columbo’s every idiosyncrasy. Not just his trenchcoat, his cigar, and his car, but his stooped posture, his gestures, his tendency to pull random objects out of his pockets, and his unfailing politeness, even when speaking to a party he knows is guilty. Unlike gritty cops of the era, he didn’t even carry a gun. Falk described the character in his 2007 autobiography (Just One More Thing, the title adapted from Columbo’s personal catchphrase) as \"a guy with a mind like Einstein who sounded like the box boy at Food Giant.\" Falk hand-selected Columbo’s permanent wardrobe—including the legendary raincoat as well a tie and shoes from his own closet—and picked out the beat-up 1959 Peugeot 403 convertible right out of the lot. All of these elements fleshed out this original character in a wholly three-dimensional way, creating an irrepressible, relatable everyman.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"All in the Family\" is still regarded as one of the most influential, medium-changing shows in television history.\n\nCategory: Musical or Comedy\n\nYears awarded: 1973, 1974, 1978\n\nStarred: Carroll O'Connor, Jean Stapleton, Rob Reiner, Sally Struthers, Mike Evans\n\nRobert David Sullivan wrote for the AV Club:\n\n\"'All In The Family' wasn’t the first TV series to tackle controversial subjects such as racism, rape, and homophobia. What was groundbreaking about the series, which ran from 1971 through 1979 and was the highest-rated show on television for five seasons, is that it mined comedy from hot-button issues, and it explored them through characters we got to know every week, as opposed to guest stars on heavy-handed dramas like The Defenders or Marcus Welby, MD.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Waltons\" helped establish the family drama genre on the small screen.\n\nCategory: Drama\n\nYear: 1974\n\nStarred: Jon Walmsley, Mary Beth McDonough, Eric Scott, Judy Norton\n\nTelevision Heaven wrote:\n\n\"In December of 1971, CBS aired a television special 'The Homecoming' which won strong critical acclaim and audience response. Due to its surprising success, CBS turned to 'The Homecoming' screenwriter Earl Hamner, Jr., to develop his story into a full hour, weekly series, and in September of 1972, we saw the birth of what is lovingly known as the granddaddy of all family-themed dramas. Like the television special the show was based on, 'The Waltons' was inspired by the lifetime kept diary of its head writer, Earl Hamner, Jr. Hamner was joined by John McGreevey (whose writing credits would take a story of their own), Marion Hargrove and Nigel McKeand. The story of 'The Waltons' chronicled the everyday life of the Walton family, a family of 11 living in rural Virginia during the depression. The series nearly mirror imaged the early life and experiences of its creator, who had been one of 18 children, growing up near Schuyler, Virginia, before leaving home in the late 1930s to pursue writing. The origin of the series had been the Hamner scripted motion picture, Spencer's Mountain, set in Wyoming, and starring Henry Fonda, Maureen O'Hara, and James MacArthur.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Upstairs, Downstairs\" is now regarded by many as the spiritual predecessor to \"Downton Abbey.\"\n\nCategory: Drama\n\nYear: 1975\n\nStarred: Gordon Jackson, David Langton, Jean Marsh\n\nTodd VanDerWerff wrote for the AV Club:\n\n\"Belying 'Upstairs, Downstairs’ reputation as typically stodgy PBS Masterpiece Theatre material, the new 40th-anniversary complete-series collection reveals the show as an important missing link between the anthology dramas of the earliest days of television and the serialized dramas that became popular in the years after it left the airwaves. Now it’s easy to draw a direct line between the kinds of cumulative stories Upstairs, Downstairs told and the similar storylines on modern-day classics like The Sopranos and Mad Men. Produced by British broadcasters, Upstairs, Downstairs found success on PBS in the States, winning the Emmy for drama series or limited series every year it was on the air.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Rhoda\" gave beloved \"Mary Tyler Moore Show\" character Rhoda Morgenstern her own series.\n\nCategory: Musical or Comedy\n\nYear: 1975\n\nStarred: Valerie Harper, Julie Kavner, Lorenzo Music\n\nTodd VanDerWerff wrote for the AV Club:\n\n\"The story of Mary Tyler Moore Show spinoff 'Rhoda' is one of a show that debuted huge and really did find ways to differentiate itself from its parent series, then found itself falling apart as its producers kept trying to mess with what had worked because it simply wasn’t as good of a show as the series could have been. There are episodes of 'Rhoda' as good as anything on the parent show, and there are episodes that flail about wildly, looking for something to do.

Roseanne’s success further emboldened Barr and her writers (whose ranks included Joss Whedon and Amy Sherman-Palladino, among other notables), who used the Conner family to tell the sorts of stories that weren’t often being told on sitcoms, at least not in the '80s. In addition to storylines informed by Barr’s feminist stance and facilitated by a cast with two teenage girls—featuring issues like birth control, menstruation, PMS, and teenage sex—the show was and remains one of very few successful sitcoms to engage, routinely and enthusiastically, with the struggles of the working class.\"\n\nThe show was renewed in 2018 but Barr's character was killed off by an opioid overdose after she posted a racist tweet about former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett.

'Party Of Five' straddled the lines of young-adult drama, offering up love triangles and tragedies for the Salingers in their late teens and 20s, and teen drama, with sweeter, smaller stories for the younger characters. Second, the show figured out fairly early on that it could successfully graft its premise onto a social-issues melodrama. With each season, the Salingers confronted the sort of small-scale problem—abortion, alcoholism, cancer, domestic violence—they might believably run into in real life. These issues gave the show a sense of external stakes other family dramas of its type sometimes lacked.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Cybill\" was a return to television for Cybill Shepherd.\n\nCategory: Musical or Comedy\n\nYear: 1996\n\nStarred: Cybill Shepherd, Christine Baranski, Alicia Witt\n\nJohn J.

On the one hand this seems appalling (in what sane universe would Richard Chamberlain receive top billing over Toshiro Mifune?), but on the other hand it’s completely understandable given the context. 'Shogun' was made for broadcast television and needed to attract large numbers of viewers, not just the few who might have seen 'The Seven Samurai' or 'Yojimbo' at an art house cinema.
