        "text": "I got into the graphic novel series The Adventure Zone by Clint McElroy, Griffin McElroy, Justin McElroy, Travis McElroy, and Carey Pietsch about a year ago; I read the existing four volumes one after another and had a very good time. They’re bizarre, irreverent, and fun and they’re such quick reads that when I finally got my hands on the new one, I was able to take it in The Eleventh Hour over the span of a single morning and a single cup of hot chocolate.\n\nWhat’s it about?\n\nOnce again, our heroes Magnus, Merle, and Taako are sent by the Bureau of Balance to track down a Grand Relic. This one is located in a small mining town that has been trapped in a bubble of time. Once inside, the adventurers quickly discover that the whole community is a few years behind the rest of the world, and they find themselves stuck in a time loop that restarts every time they die (which is a lot).\n\nWhat’d I think?\n\nTime loops are one of those sci-fi/fantasy tropes that it feels like everything gets to eventually. It’s not my favorite, but it can be fun enough when done well. The Adventure Zone’s bread and butter is playing with expectations and providing meta commentary, so I figured this would be an inventive take on the trope. It’s an engaging story with some interesting new backstory on all three of our heroes that complicates them, but for the most part The Eleventh Hour plays everything pretty straight, or at least more straight than previous installments.\n\nGriffin, the gamemaster, pops up less than usual and as a result there are fewer wink winks about the characters all knowing they’re in a story. At one point they ask Griffin to fast forward through one repeated scene and he complies, but other than that and a few other similarly small moments, they pretty much behave like normal characters (aside from Taako lampshading a death montage; Taako continues to be the best character). I do like that each individual installment has its own genre and overall feel that doesn’t match anything that came before or after, so there’s been a fluctuation of this throughout. It’s not like The Eleventh Hour feels dissonantly serious or anything. It still fits nicely into the overall tone of the series, but is perhaps not quite as meta as Here There Be Gerblins, which had the trio quibbling with Griffin over almost everything. Volume five is very funny, and there are still moments that capitalize on the fourth-wall-breaking humor that works so well here, but on the whole there’s a lot less interaction between the story’s primary reality and the one that involves its gamemaster.\n\nIn that the action does largely play out like a more traditional and less media-savvy adventure, I wished for a little more big-picture stuff and a little less on the monster-of-the-week shenanigans. Don’t get me wrong: the shenanigans are as fun as ever, with the one-off characters always being especially amusing.The last few installments have teased that the Bureau perhaps isn’t the paragon of goodness and universe-benefitting that they present themselves as, and the red-cloaked figure pops up in this one—as in his previous appearances—just enough to get me curious and whet my appetite for the upcoming reveals before disappearing. Similarly, I was a little sad at how little of Kravitz we saw. What with the premise of this one and the sheer number of deaths by our heroes, I assumed that Kravitz would be a near-constant presence and he isn’t. He’s just a little tease right at the end and that’s kind of a bummer because Kravitz is really cool and always a highlight in his brief cameos.\n\nI’m sure a lot of this is just how graphic novels are as a genre. I have the same issues with the other graphic novels I read regularly: the plot inches forward every issue, so slowly that you can more or less summarize what happened in a single sentence. It’s like watching a sitcom but waiting two years between episodes. Yeah, half the fun is the nonsense that is silly just for silly’s sake, but I’d love just a little more plot momentum. Like, is the Bureau shady or isn’t it?\n\nFor the record, I know there’s a podcast out there. I could probably get the answers I want, but to be totally honest I don’t like podcasts. I’m a very impatient person, and I’m whatever the opposite of an auditory learner is and podcasts and audiobooks don’t work for me. I need to be able to go at my own pace, and I need to look at or read something. I might be able to read a transcript of a podcast, but something tells me that wouldn’t have quite the same experience. Anyway, this is a review of the graphic novel series, and speaking as someone who has read the graphic novels without the podcast… they stand perfectly well on their own. I’m sure they’ll get to everything. They’ll just take their sweet time getting there.\n\nThat all being said, this made for a really fun morning. The main thing that The Adventure Zone does well is the humor, and despite the fact that The Eleventh Hour has an overall more somber vibe than the others—Merle and Magnus’ backstories were not what I expected! Taako’s was a surprise but, like, the sort of absurd surprise that makes perfect sense, but those two legitimately took me aback—there are still a lot of jokes. I like that the laughs are varied: there’s meta humor, adult humor, slapstick humor, allusions, and more. For the first time, Taako actually didn’t have my single favorite joke. Shoutout to Merle for the Book of Mormon reference. (“I’m all about flirting with death but, like, literally” is second, so it’s not like Taako wasn’t still firing on all cylinders).\n\nI also continue to really like the art style, so props to Carey Pietsch. And I love the early sketches included at the back of the book, particularly the costume designs. I like how everyone is styled just a little differently each volume, to better situate them in whatever genre they’ve found themselves in this time. The trading cards in the BN exclusive version are very cute as well.\n\nWhat’s the verdict?\n\nThe Crystal Kingdom is still my favorite individual issue of The Adventure Zone, but I’m definitely going to keep up with this series. It’s funny and quick-paced, and has a lot more emotion to it that I’d originally expected from a graphic novel based on a podcaster family’s fantasy roleplaying game. I’m excited by the expanding main plot, and there are enough laughs to keep me going though the stand-alone moments.\n\nPrevious review\n\nNext review\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nLike Groundhog-Day-esque time loops? You can find a list of them that’s far more exhaustive than anything I could put together on tvtropes.\n\nAs I said above, I haven’t read a lot of graphic novels. There are two series that I love, though. My favorite (tied for favorite with Adventure Zone? I don’t know. It’s close) is Fence by C.S. Pacat and Johanna the Mad, which is about a high school fencing team. I also like Heartstopper by Alice Oseman.\n\nThe Girl from the Sea by Molly Knox Ostertag is the only fantasy graphic novel I can recall reading that isn’t The Adventure Zone, but it’s cute. It has a similarly colorful, cheerful art style.\n\nI also enjoyed the graphic novel memoir Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe. Kobabe actually briefly references The Adventure Zone; Taako is Kobabe’s favorite character, perhaps unsurprisingly.\n\nLike silly meta fantasy? I adore In Other Lands by Sarah Rees Brennan. Carry On by Rainbow Rowell is slightly more serious, but still does the fantasy meta thing and is excellent. Ditto The Rest of Us Just Live Here by Patrick Ness. The Gentleman’s Guide to Vice and Virtue by Mackenzi Lee also has chaotic adventurer appeal. These are all particularly good choices if Taako is your favorite character because they’ve all got queer characters and wry humor.\n\nThis is the point where I feel like I should offer suggestions if your favorite character isn’t Taako. Sorry about that. I went through my bookshelves but everything I came up was nebulous at best. Just acknowledge that Taako is the best character and proceed with the above recommendations.\n\nSix of Crows by Leigh Bardugo isn’t meta, but it does have a bunch of chaotic protagonists with questionable morals. The Crows are significantly more competent than Magnus, Merle, and Taako but they’re equally delightful. Also, Six of Crows is my favorite book, so if it’s even slightly relevant I’m going to bring it up."
