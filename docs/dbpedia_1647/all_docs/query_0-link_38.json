        "text": "It’s good to be HBO — er, “HBO Max” — er, “HBO / Max.” How big was the pay cabler-slash-streamer when it comes to this year’s Emmy nominations? In the supporting actor in a drama category, the outlet held all eight slots (on the backs of just two programs: “Succession” and “The White Lotus”), and in supporting actress, it was six of the eight.\n\nIn a nomination announcement filled with surprises, there was one that was absolutely a given: “Succession” would dominate, and, Roy, did it ever: The outgoing HBO drama scored 27 nominations — including best drama, lead actress (Sarah Snook) and a record three lead actor noms (Brian Cox, Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Strong). Even a good chunk of the show’s supporting cast managed nods, including J. Smith-Cameron, Nicholas Braun, Matthew Macfadyen, Alexander Skarsgård and (for the Conheads in the house) Alan Ruck.\n\nWhatever you call it (they’d now like to be HBO-slash-Max), the network actually scored the top three shows with “The Last of Us” — the first video game adaptation to receive major Emmy attention — scoring 24 noms, followed by Season 2 of “The White Lotus” (now a drama series, last year a limited series) landing 23. It has four of the eight drama nods, which might make that Emmy party a bit awkward this year, but nonetheless a high-class problem to have. (If there’s one miss, it’s the fact that HBO-slash-Max doesn’t have a contender in limited series, a category it normally dominates, including last year’s winner “White Lotus,” or TV movie, which used to be a reliable HBO win.)\n\nIt was another year of haves and have nots, which means the Television Academy’s procedural change — in which voters were limited to voting for just the number of nominees that were allotted in the category. (In years past, voters could select as many as they wanted). The idea was to spread the wealth around — but nonetheless, voters know what they like and will put all their eggs in those baskets. “Succession” actually landed two more nominations than last year’s 25, for example, while “The White Lotus” landed three more than in 2022.\n\nMeanwhile Apple TV+’s “Ted Lasso,” which may or may not have ended its run with Season 3, scored 21 noms, making it the year’s biggest comedy. (That’s one more than last year’s 20, and just one shy of the record in the category — 22 for “30 Rock” in 2009). Netflix’s “Dahmer — Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,” with 13 nods, was the year’s most recognized limited/anthology series. Roku’s “Weird: The Al Yankovic Story” was tops in TV movie, with eight. And “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” with seven, was the top unscripted series.\n\nDepending on what you think HBO-slash-Max now is (a streamer? A pay cabler?), the year was once again all about the streaming world. Netflix was next in line among nominated platforms (with 103), thanks to “Beef,” “Dahmer” and “Wednesday,” all pulling double digits. Apple TV+, Hulu and Disney+ continued to perform well, while Amazon also had its best-ever year, with 45 between Prime Video and Freevee.\n\nEven the year’s biggest show from a basic cable outlet, FX’s “The Bear,” isn’t really from a basic cable outlet, as “The Bear” is only available on streamer Hulu. In that case, the final season of AMC’s “Better Call Saul” is actually the most-nommed basic cable series (with seven). Broadcast was almost completely missing once again, with ABC’s “Abbott Elementary” the only scripted primetime series to land any major noms (eight total, including outstanding comedy) and NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” leading with nine — actually a lower-than-usual tally for the sketch series, which didn’t score a single acting nom for the first time since 2008.\n\nIn the drama race, incumbent winner “Succession” faces another incumbent winner in “The White Lotus” as that show switches to drama, as well as previous category victor “The Crown.” Also, there is “House of the Dragon,” the sequel to previous drama winner “Game of Thrones.” Previous nominees “Better Call Saul” and “Yellowjackets” are back, and then newcomers “Andor” and “The Last of Us” are in the mix.\n\nLast year’s comedy winner “Ted Lasso” is back for another round, while previous nominees “Abbott Elementary,” “Barry,” “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” and “Only Murders in the Building” are joined by newcomers “The Bear,” “Jury Duty” and “Wednesday.”\n\nThe Emmy nominations recognize shows on TV that ran from June 1, 2022, to May 31, 2023. Yvette Nicole Brown and Television Academy chairman and CEO Frank Scherma revealed the nominees on Wednesday morning in a live webstream.\n\nAs for now, Fox is slated to air the 75th Primetime Emmys on September 18, produced by Jesse Collins Entertainment. (The two-night Creative Arts Emmys are scheduled for Sept. 9 and Sept. 10, with the ceremonies being broadcast by FXX on Sept. 10.) But as Variety reported on Monday, the WGA strike and potential SAG-AFTRA strike will likely push the telecast to either November (the TV Academy’s choice) or January (when Fox would like to air it). A host has not yet been named.
