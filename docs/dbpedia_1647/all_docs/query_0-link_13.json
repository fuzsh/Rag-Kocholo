        "text": "The following public talk was delivered on 7 September 2013, at the le Carré’s People symposium, at Birkbeck, University of London, co-organised by Penguin Modern Classics, to mark the fiftieth anniversary of The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.\n\nN.b. This is the original text, with minor additions in square-brackets from my vantage point a decade on in 2023.\n\nOn 8 February 1966, David Cornwell, aka. John le Carré, was interviewed by broadcaster Malcolm Muggeridge for BBC-2’s talk show Intimations (1965-66) – which, the previous year, had featured popular literary novelists Lawrence Durrell and Robert Graves. In this TV appearance, the 34 year-old writer names Graham Greene as a major influence on his writing, along with Joseph Conrad’s Under Western Eyes (1911) and The Secret Agent (1907). Le Carré launches a withering attack on James Bond, seeing him as an “international gangster”, symbolic of a culture where consumer goods are overvalued. In contrast, he outlines his own concerns with ethics and verisimilitude; his work, he claims, represents “the moral search of the solitary”. Le Carré, perhaps tellingly, refers in jaded tones to becoming embroiled in the “circus” of Public Relations. He also claims not to be attracted to film as a medium and that he would prefer to adapt the work of others, following his experience co-scripting The Spy Who Came In From The Cold (1965 film). He does not mention prospective television adaptations of his work, or the prospect of original writing for television.\n\nAs Randall Stevenson has stated, ‘television […] opened up new forms of cultural engagement for the population as a whole’.[1] From the 1960s, TV was deeply involved in social questions; for example, David Frost’s forceful inquisitions and drama that was instilled with a topical and ethical spirit by the Canadian Sydney Newman. Newman had worked for the National Film Board of Canada from 1941, and was promoted within the organisation by Scottish filmmaker John Grierson during WW2; Grierson later assisted with Newman’s move into television production in 1949. Grierson had coined the term ‘documentary’ in 1927 and produced films of social conscience and poetry like Housing Problems (1935) and Night Mail (1936). He saw an ethical imperative – ‘I look on cinema as a pulpit and use it as a propagandist’ – and John Caughie has compared him with Lord John Reith, founder Director-General of the BBC.[2] Newman was more comfortable with commercial values than Reith, but he did not neglect the legacy of the secular Scottish radical Grierson.\n\nNewman moved to the BBC in 1962; as Head of Drama he split the department into three distinct areas of production: serials, series and single-plays. Serials included adaptations of literary works; series tended to be economical and long-running, gaining large audiences through the familiarity of regular casts and narratives that fused the everyday with the melodramatic – though they were not necessarily lacking in social comment. See Tony Warren’s Coronation Street (Granada for ITV/ITV1, 1960- ) and Troy Kennedy Martin’s Z-Cars (BBC TV/BBC1, 1962-78).\n\nSingle-plays tended to be the most experimental type of drama on television. ABC’s Newman-led Armchair Theatre had pioneered in naturalistic television drama with plays like Alun Owen’s Lena, O My Lena (1960) and, the same year, 14 million viewers had tuned into its Harold Pinter play, A Night Out. On the BBC, Newman co-initiated The Wednesday Play in 1964, which featured socially engaged plays like Up the Junction (1965) and Cathy Come Home. These subsequently much-repeated dramas gained 9.21 million and 11.8 million viewers on their first screenings, respectively, [according to BBC data].\n\nCultural historian Robert Hewison has described how the 1950s and 60s saw challenges to the Leavisite privileging of a literary and artistic canon. Pop Art and the vastly popular music of the Beatles and others were being taken increasingly seriously, which marked a logical advance from how the Kingsley Amis generation had elevated jazz, detective stories and science fiction. The Robbins Report of 1963 had led to an expansion of University education; culture was being redefined, outside the control of Oxbridge-educated ‘mandarins’. In literary terms, the Powell and Waugh generation was supplanted by that of Larkin and Sillitoe. Cultural Studies was instituted as an academic field in 1964, and areas such as television were increasingly regarded as important.\n\nThe first JlC-related one-off drama was Dare I Weep, Dare I Mourn? (1966), made by Associated-Rediffusion for ITV, shot on film and in the sort of vivid, verdant colour common in ITC and ATV series like The Avengers (1961-69) and Man in a Suitcase (1967). It features James Mason as the limping, troubled Otto Hoffman, and its broadcast was almost concurrent with the release of The Deadly Affair (1966), a mixed, if soundly moody film adaptation of le Carré’s debut novel, Call from the Dead (1962). This film also starred Mason as ‘Albert Dobbs’.\n\nDare I Weep… was adapted from a le Carré short story by Stanley Mann, who had written for Armchair Theatre. Its Toronto-born director Ted Kotcheff had helmed 28 AT plays and his career witnessed a curious trajectory: from directing Doris Lessing’s Play with a Tiger at the Comedy Theatre, London in 1962 to making Rambo: First Blood in 1982. [In 1971 alone this extraordinary director made the visceral Australian film Wake in Fright and that seminal Play for Today imbued with deep social conscience and dramatic force, Edna, The Inebriate Woman]\n\nDare I Weep… contains characteristic comments on the folly of the Cold War and individual human loneliness. Jill Bennett functions as something of a wish-fulfilment romantic interest as the virtuous rebel Frida. She is not as she seems, but is part of what is referred to as ‘The Movement’. Not with Larkin, Amis and Conquest, but an anti-Communist one on the east side of the Berlin Wall!\n\nOn 21 September 1966, Dare I Weep… reached 8.1 million homes, which equates to an estimated 17.82million actual viewers.[3] This calculates as a colossal 32.7% of the total UK population. It was fourth for its week in the TAM Top 20, a weekly record of the most watched programmes which had been published in the Financial Times since the early 1960s. For comparison, William Hartnell era Doctor Who averaged 8.5 million viewers, Steptoe and Son in 1963-64 regularly got 12-21million and The Forsyte Saga’s mean audience was 15.65 million. [It is worth noting that ITV’s TAM-meter system may have inflated the figures somewhat compared with the BBC’s Daily Viewing Barometers’ more conservative figures, which were based on attentive-viewing; see May (2023) unpublished thesis, I:132-135, freely downloadable here]\n\nGuardian critic Gerald Fay was in two minds about Dare I Weep…; he extolled the ‘very spirited and talented performances’ of Mason, Jill Bennett and Hugh Griffith, but saw it as falling apart at the end.[4] The Observer’s Maurice Richardson was pleased by Bennett’s ‘pillar-box mouth’ but rather tired of Berlin Wall stories; for him, ‘the overall mood was so uniformly downbeat that I was more inclined to yawn than mourn.’[5]\n\nBy 1968, Armchair Theatre had begun a ratings resurgence; a bizarre Ken Campbell play One Night I Danced with Mr Dalton was seen in June by as many people as Opportunity Knocks, and was praised in the Express and the Telegraph for its ‘confident lunatic logic’.[6] That July, Thames replaced ABC and, when AT returned in 1969, its estimated average audience was 14.34 million.\n\nDirector Alan Cooke had helmed four Wednesday Plays, was to direct four Plays for Today and this was the last of no fewer than twenty-two Armchair Theatres he had helmed since 1959. He directed End of the Line (1970), which was le Carré’s only work written solely for television.\n\nWhen interviewed in 2004 by Mark Lawson, le Carré mentioned his preoccupation with writing interrogation scenes that had ‘a measure of compassion and humanity’.[7] His first TV play represents this tendency, which was entirely missing from Dare I Weep… It is an exemplar of the economical studio-play, shot on video and, primarily, in one set, with very occasional filmed inserts. The two main protagonists are closeted in a first-class compartment within an East Coast Main Line train, starting in Edinburgh, terminating in London. 48 of the play’s 52 minutes are comprised of a duologue on a single set, broken only by the commercial break. Cooke handles the limitations of the setting rather well, with the nimble camera interrogating the characters.\n\nWhile the play is primarily naturalistic, late on, there is non-diegetic sound that represents the mental anguish of Frayne (Robert Harris), on whom the MI5 agent-with-the-dog-collar-disguise Bagley (Ian Holm) turns the tables. This play functions as a sustained confessional, or battle of wills, between characters who do not appear elsewhere in the le Carré oeuvre. We get a sense of the humanistic, idiosyncratic approach to cross-examination that le Carré admires – in stark contrast to approaches taken by what he has described to Lawson as the ‘uninformed’ and ‘paranoid’ UK intelligence community today.[8] [Though, watching this again in 2023, I feel this needs qualifying, as the manner and means of Frayne’s removal at the end does not seem humane, but, is rather, casually disturbing]\n\nEnd of the Line was broadcast at 8.30pm on Monday 29 June 1970, amid a prime-time schedule of networked ITV shows: following Opportunity Knocks, Coronation Street, World in Action; preceding a below-par Harry H. Corbett-June Whitfield comedy vehicle, The Best Things in Life. It competed with Panorama and The Troubleshooters on BBC-1 and, on BBC-2 an American Western series, The High Chaparral. 11.33 million viewers tuned in, down just over a million from the series’ third episode, but up from the opener, which had gained 10.3 million viewers [from TAM figures].\n\nCritically, it received mixed reviews. In the Guardian, Nancy Banks-Smith disliked this ‘savage, sophisticated ordeal by rail’, not appreciating the erratic nature of the protagonists and finding it ‘disturbing’.[9] Henry Raynor in the Times was much more positive, commenting on le Carré’s ‘remarkably pointed, literary dialogue’, the lack of binary good-evil distinctions and ‘remarkable’ acting.[10]\n\nThe casting of the protean pair is ideal. Robert Harris, with his melodious tones, is Frayne, as English a traitor as they come: 70-year-old Harris had appeared in The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943) and The Avengers (1969) and had played King Henry IV in a 1959 series. The role is comparable to John Le Mesurier’s Adrian Harris in Dennis Potter’s Play for Today, Traitor (1971) the following year – with the Dad’s Army star devastatingly imposing as the Philbyesque character. [As expounded in my historical analysis here,] Traitor creates a greater sense of antagonism between competing political ideas – though both Frayne and Harris have in common an intense, ambivalent attitude to England…\n\nIan Holm plays the more subdued MI5 agent – who aptly disguises himself as a priest to extract the confession from Frayne. This was just a year after his unsettling lead performance as an Al Bowlly fanatic in Dennis Potter’s brilliant, intense single-play for LWT, Moonlight on the Highway (1969). [Holm’s sole appearances in The Wednesday Play and Play for Today – Emma’s Time, 1970, and Soft Targets, 1982, were also notably in explicitly Cold War texts written by David Mercer and Stephen Poliakoff, respectively]\n\nThe rest of Armchair Theatre‘s 1970 run included plays by TV stalwarts such as Roger Marshall and Fay Weldon, and one by the sitting MP for Coventry North, Maurice Edelman. There was also the excellent Say Goodnight to Your Grandma by [the redoubtable] Colin Welland, very much in the style of John Hopkins’ plays of domestic disorder, who also contributed his third and last play for the strand. This particular series did well in the ratings: receiving an estimated average of 13 million viewers per play, according to TAM data. The largest television audience of the year, however, was for Miss World on 20th November, when 23.21 million people tuned into BBC-1 to watch the objectifying spectacle; not expecting to see scenes of Women’s Liberation protestors throwing smoke bombs and leaflets onto the stage and heckling the compere Bob Hope.\n\nFast-forward to British television, 1979: David Attenborough’s ground-breaking Life on Earth, the second runs of Fawlty Towers and Ripping Yarns. The irreverent Not the Nine O’Clock News quickly garnered acclaim akin to that of a contemporary Beyond the Fringe. In [its remarkably strong] years of 1979 and 1980 Play for Today included work by talents as various as Trevor Griffiths, Dennis Potter, Mike Leigh, Brian Glover, [Carol Bunyan], [Horace Ové & Jim Hawkins] and Ian McEwan. But before we get to the key TV adaptation of JlC, let’s focus on its key creative figures.\n\nIn a 1980 Times interview, director John Irvin speaks of being brought up in the same South Tyneside town as Ridley Scott: South Shields; as he says, “there must be something about the smell of the fish queues that produces film directors”.[11] In 1962, Irvin had received a £750 grant from the BFI to make Gala Day, an impressionistic portrait of the Durham miners’ annual Big Meeting in July of that year. This film had much in common with the Free Cinema movement of Lindsay Anderson and others, with its preoccupation with working-class culture, though this film is infinitely more approving of the carnivalesque behaviour of its subjects than Anderson’s scathing O Dreamland (1953).\n\nIn 1968, Journalist Arthur Hopcraft wrote a widely regarded classic of football writing, The Football Man. For Michael Wale in The Times, it was ‘the first clearly defined statement of the modern game’.[12] In the same year, he wrote in the Observer regarding the ‘banner of privacy’ that clubs were trying to apply to the game: ‘a field which has to be public or else it cannot exist’.[13] [This notably echoes the arguments made by literary scholar Andrew Hammond in British Fiction and the Cold War (2013) that British writers often represented public and private lives being lived in increasingly clandestine ways, in parallel to the era’s great geopolitical conflict.]\n\nHopcraft soon moved into television writing. which included an excellent, warm, subtle Play for Today, The Reporters in October 1972, featuring Michael Kitchen as an ambitious rookie journalist and Robert Urquhart as a down-at-heel veteran; both working at a paper in a provincial northern town. In The Observer, Clive James acclaimed its delicate pace and fastidious writing, saying it would make a good companion piece to a Dennis Potter play about journalism: ‘Potter all rage, Hopcraft all plangency.’[14]\n\n[The (probably) Blackburn-set] The Reporters has evocative dialogue and settings – all fish and chips, 1970s boozers, references to Aldermaston marches, the Salvation Army and Dickens. Urquhart’s character describes Dickens as “the greatest of all reporters”, while expressing deep scorn for the modern popular press such as The Daily Express, which Kitchen ends up moving to work for.\n\nHopcraft became a prolific TV writer; he created and penned the bookending episodes of Granada’s Nightingale’s Boys, broadcast on ITV from January 1975: an elegiac series about a socialist Grammar School master (Derek Farr) who had served in the Spanish Civil War and stages a reunion for his favourite old class from 1949. In previewing this series in The Observer, Helen Dawson had described Hopcraft as ‘thoroughly dependable’.[15] In April of the same year, he completed his first television adaptation of a literary work: John Vanbrugh’s A Journey to London. In 1976, his play for Victorian Scandals: ‘Hannah’ focused on ‘that odd Victorian obsession with class and caste.’[16] In 1977, Hopcraft combined these two elements of adaptation and Victoriana when he adapted Dickens’s socio-political novel Hard Times, again for Granada, and shown in the Autumn. This adaptation, with a budget of £4,000 per televised minute, was not the last drama serial to be directed by John Irvin and written by Arthur Hopcraft to feature a circus…[17]\n\nVirtually all broadsheet newspaper critics acclaimed Hard Times, and persistently throughout its run. Nancy Banks-Smith admires it as a ‘magnificent looker’ and in ‘some respects better than the book’ – giving the example of the performance and portrayal of the unfortunate Stephen Blackpool.[18] Clive James reviewed two of the four episodes, appraising the strong, gripping way Hopcraft puts across the novel’s ethical and political issues.[19] Chris Dunkley also praises it as fleshing out the symbolic elements of the novel and mentioned the hard choice drama viewers had between Play for Today on BBC1 and Hard Times on ITV.[20] All broadsheet TV critics commented warmly on production designer Roy Stonehouse’s work – ‘miraculously busy, teeming with detail’, according to James. Michael Church in the Times showed his political partiality in his disappointment that Hopcraft had ‘quietly but fundamentally redrawn’ Dickens’ odious union militant character Slackbridge ‘to suit the currently fashionable placatory attitude to militant trade unionism.’[21]\n\nIn 1978, Stanley Reynolds compared Hopcraft to Alan Bennett, seeing them as teledramatists who are ‘unmistakably English in an old-fashioned way’. [This remark sets the scene for Hopcraft’s version of JlC’s Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, which is widely regarded as an exceptional engagement with seedy and complex Englishness]\n\nTTSS was shot entirely on film, not on video as was then the norm with BBC television period dramas or literary adaptations; like, say, I, Claudius (1976) [expertly directed by Herbert Wise in studio space]. It was produced in association with US film company Paramount and was one of several harbingers of the rise in TV drama co-productions on British television.\n\nIn Alec Guinness’ first significant television assignment, he spent six months working on it. Helpfully, BBC-2 screened a couple of his Ealing films on Tuesdays at 7pm in the direct run-up to TTSS’s broadcast: The Lavender Hill Mob (4 September) and The Ladykillers (11 September). [Piquantly, the BBC had purchased Ealing Film Studios in 1955, and were to use it for filmed material for the next four decades] As le Carré said, in a May 2009 interview with Mark Lawson, Guinness was ‘a hugely loved actor in Britain at that time’ and his 2% cut of the profits from Star Wars had secured him financially. In an interview with Tom Sutcliffe in The Guardian, published two days before the broadcast of episode 1, Guinness spoke of being impressed by how little Arthur Hopcraft had had to change the novel.\n\n[Graphic designer Douglas Burd’s brilliant, minimalist and memorable title sequence establishes, and prepares us for, TTSS‘s tone. Geoffrey Burgon’s ruminative, minor-key musical ident, led by strings and woodwinds, circles, uncertainly, alongside the visual motif of Russian Matroyshka dolls, with one containing another and so on, in a traditional representation of a chain of mothers reproducing. Lighting Cameraman Vic Cummings masters interior lighting here, just like he did with exterior when working on the 1976-77 Play for Today title sequence. We also see names of many character players from the rich ensemble cast, like Ian Richardson and Beryl Reid, who are crucial in making JlC’s often elliptical text work in human terms]\n\n[Furthermore, the end-credits contain Burgon’s thoroughly haunting, stately and lonely sounding ‘Nunc Dimittis’, sung by a choirboy]\n\nMultiple episodes of the serial were reviewed by several newspapers. That is, expect for The Times. Similarly to ITV, which was off-air for 9 weeks from the 6th August – it was affected by industrial action: going unpublished for nearly a year. Reviewing episode 1 in The Guardian, Banks-Smith admired the performances and atmosphere, describing Guinness’ Smiley as ‘a hero for our times’. [The ITV strike meant that all episodes of TTSS had no direct ITV opposition – barring the final Sunday repeat. This fact seriously bolstered TTSS‘s ratings, which were incredible for BBC-2: which ranged from 6 to 8.3 million, according to BBC data (BBC Audience Research Report, VR/79/482]. The entire series gained a high Reaction Index of 65 from viewers, though this was interestingly down on the average for individual episodes of 70 (ibid.).]\n\nHopcraft emphasises Bill Prideaux’s wistful telling of H.C. McNeile’s Bulldog Drummond stories to his pupils, when engaged as supply-teacher. The old patriotic certainties didn’t hold wide sway any more, at least pre-Falklands. Peter Tilbury’s downbeat sitcom, Shelley, with its over-educated and unemployed protagonist, played by Hywel Bennett, began closely prior to TTSS in July 1979 – and became a considerable ratings success. Its 1980 and 1981 series’ saw it gain audiences that ranged from 11 to nearly 16 million [according to TAM figures]. Bennett is well cast in TTSS as the seamy Ricki Tarr. The schedules seemed to be filled with dissections of Englishness, as Chris Dunkley argued in his review of episode 4. Eddie Shoestring was another down-at-heel, distinctly non-heroic character on BBC-1; BBC-2 had Jonathan Gill’s documentary series Public School and a sitcom called Bloomers, the last series to feature Richard Beckinsale – playing ‘an unemployed actor named Stan who goes into partnership with a florist’. Dunkley refers to TTSS as ‘a positive showpiece of Englishness’. [This may refer to the faded elegance of the varied locations used and its actors’ skilled rendering of complex and refined speech]\n\nTTSS is, surely, a precursor to prestigious dramas like Inspector Morse (1987-2000) and The Jewel in the Crown (1984), which conveyed similarly ornate, yet ambivalent portraits of Englishness to expansive worldwide audiences. Dunkley locates TTSS as different to, on the one hand, the glamorous Scarlet Pimpernel and James Bond-style depictions of spies, and, on the other, the pathetic and sordid type represented by the character Lonely in ABC and Thames’ long-running espionage drama Callan (ITV, 1967-72).\n\nDunkley agrees with James that TTSS‘s plot is slow moving, but he commends the serial’s focus as ‘closer to anthropology […] we are being shown the enclosed society (The Circus) within a society (Post-War Britain) which earlier harboured Kim Philby.’ TTSS does indeed have a comparable focus to Dennis Potter’s aforementioned ‘Traitor’ and Granada’s documentary-styled drama, Philby, Burgess and Maclean (1977) – a sturdy, inelegant representation of the real-life events, with compelling performances from Derek Jacobi as a camp, acerbic Burgess and the stalwart character actor Anthony Bate as an unflappable Philby. Surely Powell and others had this association in mind when they cast the lugubrious Bate as the mandarin and overseer Oliver Lacon in TTSS. Bate is one of relatively few actors to return in Smiley’s People (1982).\n\nIn the Observer, Clive James mentioned the ‘dull’ trailers, which featured Arthur Hopcraft strolling Hampstead Heath and insinuating that anyone around could be spies! James didn’t like the programme either, seeing the dialogue as stilted; for him, there is too much emphasis on character and too little on plot. However, by episode 4, he was declaring it ‘a good deal less wearisome’. For James, Hopcraft does capture what is best in le Carré: a ‘unique […] romantic dowdiness which nobody else can quite match’. While he says it is ‘only marginally better than plain dull’, he does concede, as a subjective viewer, that he will watch to the end.\n\nPeter Fiddick’s review of episode 7 was highly personal, bemoaning that his wife, having previously read the novel, had spoiled his enjoyment of the guessing-game by telling him the traitor’s identity. Fiddick discerns that Hopcraft deals well with the inevitable division of the audience into the ‘Knows’ and ‘Don’t Knows’ – i.e. those who had read the novel and those who had not. He astutely observes how Hopcraft, contrary to Guinness’s perspective that he barely changed anything, shifted the chronology of the events surrounding Bill Prideaux to keep the ‘Knows’ guessing and uncertain.\n\nPierre Bourdieu’s theory of ‘cultural capital’ can be applied to Dunkley’s retrospective stance on this serial, which is culturally refined, or pompous, depending on your perspective: ‘[TTSS] has the same sort of satisfying logic and symmetry as a good crossword or a Bach suite.’ In the same extended piece, Dunkley praises the BBC and derides the section of the audience who were resistant to the appeal of TTSS: ‘Goodness knows what all the inverted snobs will do now that they can’t spend the week boasting about their inability to follow a single minute.’ His high cultural tastes according with a distaste for rank misogyny, Dunkley understandably takes some delight in the fact that the same industrial dispute by BBC technicians which had affected editions of Doctor Who, Tomorrow’s World and Newsnight had also thwarted the broadcast of Miss World 1979. Clearly, cultural capital in 1970s Britain was accrued by ‘getting’ such programmes as TTSS and denouncing the more egregious popular shows.\n\nTTSS was named the best drama series in the annual Broadcasting Press Guild awards, decided by television writers and critics and, unsurprisingly, Alec Guinness won the best television actor award for his magisterially subtle portrayal of George Smiley which anchored the whole production.\n\nTTSS was popular in an era when popular programmes were regularly good, or, ascribed with ‘value’ by many. On BBC1, for example, the crime drama series Shoestring, with Trevor Eve as its pacifistic, provincial detective, series one of which averaged about 17.1 million viewers, [aided somewhat by the ITV strike]. While David Wheeler of The Listener did not like it, the same publication’s Andrew Sinclair praised its eccentricity, originality and attention to social problems.[22] He quotes the essayist Joseph Addison’s view that the good and the popular are intrinsically linked. Peter Smith, who directed episode five of Shoestring‘s first run, ‘Listen to Me’, went onto direct A Perfect Spy eight years later.\n\nTTSS’s producer Jonathan Powell was responsible for further literary adaptations, Testament of Youth and Pride and Prejudice in early 1980, which completed a trio of ‘astonishing’ productions, in Dunkley’s view, [whose response strongly approves of the BBC’s long-term provision of perceived high-quality literary-sourced period dramas].[23] Interestingly, given debates regarding ‘value’, it was Powell who, with Michael Grade, proved the nemesis of Doctor Who in the mid-1980s. In his role as Head of Drama Series and Serials he gave the show little support or encouragement (see Marson, 2013).\n\nJohn Hopkins co-adapted Smiley’s People (1982) with le Carré. In 1966, Hopkins had written the masterful four-part drama of domesticity and clashing values, Talking to a Stranger, in 1966; in October 1976, the serial was, aptly, shown as the centrepiece of the first ever public retrospective of British television drama at the NFT.[24] Hopkins had written many vivid Wednesday Plays, such as Horror of Darkness (1965), a striking, sensitive and intense chamber drama about a gay man’s role in a tortuous love triangle; [this brilliant drama with Alfred Lynch, Nicol Williamson and Glenda Jackson appeared] two years before the Sexual Offences Act 1967. Curiously, another of his assignments involved contributing to the James Bond jaunt Thunderball (1965). Simon Langton directed, John Irvin having moved to Hollywood straight after TTSS, to direct the likes of The Dogs of War (1980), a war film about mercenaries adapted from a Frederick Forsyth novel, for which he enlisted Geoffrey Burgon for the underscore.\n\n[Smiley’s People has an ingenious, if perhaps more arcane, title sequence than TTSS‘s. Stewart Austin’s award-winning design – following TTSS‘s similar accolades – shows the chalked lines on the park bench, a spy tradecraft signal: this, along with the meticulously peeling coloured paint on the wooden bench, feels peak JlC in its drab realism, saying to us: these are the authentic rules of the game. There’s stately, but dramatic, subtle changes in lighting and slow camera movement create an intriguing atmosphere, which feels more arty, but also prosaic, than TTSS‘s Matroyshka dolls. It ends with an explosion, highlighting the potential for danger ahead. This sequence retains the focus on the actors, starting with ‘ALEC GUINNESS IN’, and then also listing six other key actors, including Bernard Hepton, Rosalie Crutchley and Patrick Stewart. Patrick Gowers’s musical ident feels like a mildewed, slowed-down version of Burgon’s musical textures, strings sounding thoroughly diseased and weary, lead horns processing forlornly and sinisterly; the deathly drift is barely disturbed even by the climactic tympani used for the explosion. This piece’s title, ‘Ostrakova’ evokes Eileen Atkins’s character.]\n\nSmiley’s People was given a prime space in the late autumn-winter 1982 schedules, 8pm, and averaged between 7-8 million viewers; often topping BBC-2’s own chart, and a remarkable figure given the lack of ITV strikes. Banks-Smith found the series ‘less compulsively mysterious’ than TTSS; the Times’ Dennis Hackett liked the interplay between Smiley and the ‘cannibalistic careerist’ Lacon. The Guardian’s Martin Walker praised the cast but felt disappointed, writing his review in the second-person to Smiley: ‘They begin your credits with some trash that sounds as if it had been warmed over from a spaghetti Western […] The mood is changed and the mood was all [my emphasis].’ The end credit-sequence is utterly overshadowed by that of TTSS, which had Geoffrey Burgon’s melancholy choirboy music. In the Financial Times, Anthony Thorncroft saw it as ‘a triumph of style over content’, though Dunkley thought it ‘outstandingly good’, if more conventional than TTSS.\n\nA Perfect Spy (1987) was another co-production, and earned significant overseas sales for BBC Enterprises in an era when the Corporation was moving towards a more ‘hard-headed commercialism’, [spearheaded by whizz-kid accountant Michael Checkland, whose steadiness has been praised by Jean Seaton (2015)]. It saw the return of Hopcraft as adaptor and achieved solid ratings for BBC-2: 5.55 million for episode 1, and 4.9 and 4.1 million for its other two appearances in the channel’s weekly Top 10.\n\n[I haven’t actually seen all of A Perfect Spy, so can’t thoroughly assess it myself, but I can analyse its titles. There is a feature film-like use of a preceding, nearly two minute dramatic scene before the tile sequence begins. Mildly foreboding strings play a brief, lamenting, violin-led ident; its 27 seconds or so are not accompanied by any substantive visuals, just a few credits and the series title in white formal typeface on a blank black background. The previous two adaptations’ focus on an acting ensemble goes: we only seen ‘STARRING RAY McANALLY’, no one else. This bare anti-aesthetic represents either bullish confidence in the JlC moniker to pull viewers in on its own terms, the BBC responding to its perennially straitened economic conditions, or, simply, a baffling lack of effort – or maybe it’s a bit of all three?! The end credits, also simply with white text on black, feel very late 1980s or early 1990s, with Midi synths and piano, joined belatedly by violin, feeling a blander variant on Barrington Pheloung’s lushly ornate TV music.]\n\nThe Times’ Peter Waymark acclaimed Hopcraft’s ‘strong script’; all reviews endorsed Ray McAnally and Peter Egan. [The former was soon to star in A Very British Coup (1988), Alan Plater’s skilled adaptation of Chris Mullin’s political counterfactual novel]; the latter was famous contemporaneously as the urbane Paul Ryman in Esmonde and Larbey’s melancholy sitcom Ever Decreasing Circles (1984-89). However, Hugh Hebert in The Guardian described it as a ‘lugubrious, plodding tale’, unfavourably comparing it with Potter’s The Singing Detective (1986) as an exploration of father and son, past and present. Andrew Hislop found it ‘an unforgivable error’ to alter the novel’s complex chronology and proceed chronologically through Pym’s childhood. However, in The Listener, Peter Lennon thought it ‘overlooked’ and ‘the outstanding serial of the year’.[25]\n\n1980s television drama saw the eclipse of the single-play. It was cheaper and easier to make series and soap operas, due to their recycling of actors, costumes and sets – and their [generally being a safer bet to achieve higher audience sizes]. While academic George W. Brandt (1993) saw much hope in the series and serials, Alan Plater foresaw in 1989 the long-term damage that would result from the single-play’s demise, arguing in the Listener that ‘We must battle for original work’. Plater himself had – literally – adapted; fashioning an acclaimed BBC serial like the Trollope adapation The Barchester Chronicles (1982) alongside producer Powell, alongside his own deadpan, warmly socialist humanist Beiderbecke trilogy for Yorkshire Television (ITV, 1984-88). Indeed, the older generation of writers made magnificent serials in this era: Beiderbecke, Edge and Darkness (1985) and Potter’s aforementioned The Singing Detective surely constituting the pinnacle.\n\nHowever, opportunities were now denied to younger writers. Following the cancelling of Play for Today in 1984 and the gradual whittling down of other single-play strands – aspiring young writers could not learn and experiment, as Plater had been able to. Young British people in 2013 know the feeling, living through the educational policies of Michael Gove. [The Play for Today ethos actually outlived the ‘PfT’ strand banner, as original, contemporary-set one-off dramas did persist on BBC-1 and BBC-2 prime-time until 1991, at least; though it had disappeared as a regular fixture by the end of the 1990s]\n\nThe success of the le Carré adaptations was surely a factor in the commissioning of TV serials that depicted self-serving establishments, corruption and intrigue: Muck and Brass (1982), Edge of Darkness, The Monocled Mutineer (1986), A Very British Coup and Traffik (1989). However, more influential today seems to be the nostalgic heritage period drama of John Mortimer’s Brideshead Revisited (Granada for ITV, 1981) and Julian Bond’s The Far Pavilions (Goldcrest and HBO for Channel 4, 1984), stretching forward to Downton Abbey [(Carnival Films and WGBH-TV for ITV, 2010-15)].\n\nIn April 1991, JlC’s own feature-length adaptation of A Murder of Quality gained a sound audience of 10.99 million on ITV, helmed by a notable arts documentarian and Play for Today director Gavin Millar.[26] While it was comfortably defeated by The Darling Buds of May, Prime Suspect and the big soap operas, it was more popular than mainstream propositions like Russ Abbot, Davro, Little and Large, Top of the Pops and A Question of Sport. AMOQ was made by Thames; over 20 years after the same company had produced End of the Line. Thames was only to broadcast for another year, falling victim to the Thatcher government’s 1990 Broadcasting Act, a deregulation of the Independent Television franchise system which has led directly to the market-driven, culturally-impoverished state of ITV of today.\n\nA Murder of Quality reflects the shift towards the only one-off TV dramas becoming single docudramas or biographical dramas not gathered in a strand, being part of film-centric strands, or like this: one-off TV movies. Stanley Myers, a key composer straddling the worlds of Hollywood and the Wednesday Play-Play for Today, provides an underscore which builds on some of the atonal modernist classical sounds he evokes in David Pirie’s late Play for Today Rainy Day Women (1984).\n\nWith AMOQ, Le Carré finally became sole adaptor of one of his own works, twenty-six years after he had told Muggeridge on BBC-2 that he wouldn’t do so. The varied cast included skilled veterans of Armchair Theatre and The Wednesday Play: Billie Whitelaw, [David Threlfall, Joss Ackland, Denholm Elliott] and Glenda Jackson [- alongside a teenaged Christian Bale!] The Guardian’s Matt Sweeting saw it as dated: ‘anything scruffy looked like as though it had been sprinkled with 30 year old dust […] A good Morse would run rings round this’.[27] Lynne Truss of The Times thought it a predictable and ‘conventional murder mystery’, involving ‘mundane detective work’.[28] In stark contrast, JlC adherent Chris Dunkley, still at the FT, commended the ‘outstanding’ cast – featuring Threlfall of future Shameless fame and Elliott playing George Smiley – and valued its concerted focus on the English class system.[29]\n\n[Since 2013, le Carré remains a regular source for film adaptations and, notably, his work has become at home on BBC-1 as attested by prestigious, ‘high-end’ thriller series like The Night Manager (2016) and The Little Drummer Girl (2018).\n\n[The title sequence of The Night Manager aurally contains busy, Hollywood strings and jauntily foreboding bombast. Visually, we see non-human objects, focused on often in high definition close-ups akin to expensive advertising imagery. We see rockets, drinking glasses, cups of tea, planes, fireworks, boats, missiles, a lamp (?); culminating in a chandelier which explodes, evoking a shift in focus from the pyrotechnics of Smiley’s People‘s title sequence, with its richly drab espionage particulars towards moneyed, super-rich lifestyles. The music sounds oddly generic, but clearly prepares people for a globe-trobbing adventure that will include suspense and action; a popular thriller, that does not flag up any bleakness or political themes.\n\nThe Night Manager was, unquestionably, compelling, combining Jed Mercurio-like populist suspense with its highly elite public-schooled cast who adeptly embodied the corruptions of the globalised Blair-Bush-Clinton era. In terms of audience sizes, TNM was a vast success, outscoring the latter adaptation in the popular zeitgeist. However, as I argued here, director Park Chan-wook and the exceptional Florence Pugh ensured that TLDG had greater artistry and deeper, more trenchant political insights than TNM, and was a vast improvement on George Roy Hill’s 1984 film version.\n\nThe Little Drummer Girl‘s titles shift back, musically, towards the slow and melancholy, being led by a delicate, rueful Spanish guitar. We see empty cinema seats. Rarely, for a JlC title sequence, characters appear: Florence Pugh’s Charlie clutching a suitcase, her blonde hair blowing in the wind in ultra-slow motion. She is fashionably dressed, standing in front of grey high rise buildings in a city. We see a partially concealed monochrome photo on a desk, a man’s back and his shadow on the wall, a phone on the ground – evoking disarray – an aerial shot of a red car driving on an urban road, paused, like everything else here. A modernistic clock with steel hands, the seconds moving by. A moustached man turns to us, a tape recorder spoils. We return to Charlie, back to back with an indistinct woman, and then see a lone bag on the ground through a doorway. This sequence returns us to a more drab urban JlC aesthetic, with a stately, dense patchwork of paused images; amid the intrigue we know we will follow a modern woman protagonist within a primarily urban setting, with the prominent suitcase and bag suggesting Charlie will travel far.]\n\nUltimately, television, [with its innate intimacy and situation within the domestic environment] has proved an ideal medium to depict non-heroic protagonists. It has thoroughly represented David Cornwell’s systemic analysis of the British intelligence world, with its flawed protagonists, searching interrogations and sense of moral malaise that can be more broadly applied to British power structures in the 1970s more generally [and, unarguably, even more so today]. Also, Le Carré on television reflects the history of television: a move away from single-plays towards series and serials. [While longer-form dramas have sometimes delivered great depth and richness, the economically-driven shift to this form has, unfortunately, denied writers sufficient scope to develop their individual styles, therefore depriving us of dramas which give voice to contemporary life in the UK.

I doubt he did. Naval man though he was, and so familiar with the whole range of filthy language, I think he would have regarded it as impossibly crude.’[1]\n\nPeter Morgan: ‘I could not care less about the royal family; it’s absolutely scandalous that they should still exist in an egalitarian society.’[2]\n\nTom Nairn: ‘During the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the prime mover had to at least look like the rest of nation-state normality. Contrived timelessness was the answer.’[3]\n\nThe Crown is visually lavish; an example of expansive, spectacular television, with imperious casting and locations, which yet contains the depth that ten hours affords. A £5m per episode – or mini-movie, as Trevor Johnston has it[4] – budget augments and does not overwhelm thoughtful screenwriting from Peter Morgan.[5] Its strength is its polysemy: that it can be taken plenty of ways. And, also, that it is a television series and frankly not a series of ‘mini-movies’, whatever Sight and Sound might want us to believe…\n\nThe LRB described its total budget as £100m., but this isn’t an expensive jaunt that leaves no trace: I strongly recall images and scenes, such as the elegant foreshadowing of Prince Philip in a private members’ club with a decidedly right-wing atmosphere, watching a newsreel film about Nasser, several years before Suez. I recall Lithgow’s hunched frame and craggy features, the actor embodying that problematic national avatar Churchill.\n\nIn 2011, left-wing writer on matters of state Tom Nairn referred to how ‘the overblown came to counter-posed to an understated essence’. This phrase aptly describes the mix of absurd yet public-captivating pomp is deliberately balanced by the media image created of a ‘real’ family with dutiful, modest values. Peter Morgan’s series manages to show convincing individuals embroiled in a bizarre spectacle, following constitutional imperatives that they seem to have no control over. Nairn also described ‘Crown mythology’ as ‘an instrument for holding such a ‘united kingdom’ together’.[6] In 1961, Henry Fairlie had described it as ‘threatening to become the sole prop of the weak, the sole provider of emotional security, the sole cohesive force in society’.[7] At its best, Morgan’s series is a questioning take on what it would actually be like on a human level to have to symbolise a ‘united’ nation and its traditions. One’s daily life as a crucial part of how national ‘unity’ and ‘traditions’ are manufactured.\n\nThe strongest episode for me is the Julian Jarrold-directed ‘Act of God’, a whole hour of television based around the now slightly less obscure Great Smog of London in December 1952. This episode dramatises the political scene of the last ‘Churchill era’, a neglected area other than by your Kynastons, Bogdanors and Hennessys and places Attlee and Churchill at the centre. It reveals both just how out-of-touch Churchill was, and yet how much residual media-savvy he could deploy with his back against the wall. This is the episode which most places the monarchy and the establishment among the wider populace. Hopefully, there will be more such edgier episodes in future series’. The series is at times limited by its Great Men & Women focus on history, and many episodes feature little sense of those who are ruled over. The smog episode is the one to truly create some sense of the view from ‘below’.\n\nI had been convinced by Peter Morgan’s interview in Sight and Sound that this series would be worth a go: and not at all like Hallmark’s ridiculed William & Catherine: A Royal Romance (2011), which has Prince Charles saying “Puff Daddy”. There is leisurely, but often tense, character-based drama in The Crown rather than arrant stupidity. Its daring is shown in its depiction of tensions within Elizabeth and Phillip’s marriage, and Morgan’s skill in characterisation is no surprise given his previous handling of British history like The Deal (2003) and Longford (2006). In an insightful article for the LRB (15/12/16, p.15), Andrew O’Hagan acclaims Morgan’s writing for how it subversively ‘exposes the royals by undressing their silence with words’. They are made more human by their various uses of language and are thus inserted into history as actors.\n\nThey are made more human by their various uses of language and are thus inserted into history as actors.\n\nPeter Hitchens, writing in early October – presumably without having seen the series – lays into its seeing the past through the present’s perspective. Bizarrely, he seems to think a drama series could hope to truly capture another era; historical dramas have always been just as telling about their own times they were produced in as the eras they depict. He accuses Smith and Foy of being representatives of the younger British generations he regards as essentially foreign: ‘They are too knowing about trivial things, and too innocent of important ones.’[8]\n\nHaving watched all ten episodes, I don’t think this is borne out – I am convinced by their accents and the attitudes and bearings they convey. I agree with O’Hagan about royal historian Hugo Vickers’ nit-picking article in The Times; it is not important how accurate it is, it is whether it is good drama: ‘fibs are fine, so long as they tap at the human problems underneath.’ (p.16) While I partially accept Hitchens’ point that they don’t look like they’ve lived through WW2, such a deep background will be difficult for any actor to suggest without being unsubtle. And, thankfully, Smith and Foy haven’t lived through WW2, however much that might anger our Peter!\n\nMore convincing than Hitchens’ perennial obsession with an imagined 1950s are Harry Leslie Smith’s reservations, Smith having lived through the times depicted: ‘The Crown is like an expensive painting in which the only subjects in focus are the rich and privileged. Everyone else, people like me or your grandparents if they came from the working class and even the middle class, are considered no more than background scenery. We are the undefined face in the crowd waving religiously at our so-called betters.’[9] Smith accurately notes how little we get in The Crown of the struggles to establish the Welfare State. This perhaps show some commercially rooted compromise from the ‘egalitarian’ Morgan. Though I feel this lack is counterbalanced by the uniquely in-depth human picture we get of this strange family…\n\nA weak link is the eighth episode, ‘Pride & Joy’, which depicts Margaret stepping in and fulfilling the Queen’s duties. It also contains the utter tedium of the Queen Marm’s trip to Scotland where she ends up buying a castle. While episode #6 ‘Gelignite’ managed to capture something of the tragic in Margaret’s predicament, both episodes veered close to the blander, glossier kind of soap opera. The final episode, however, proved an enticing set-up for series 2, which will deal with the epoch-defining Suez Crisis. Morgan has discussed the similarities of Brexit vote to Suez, with ‘a country mortgaging its international respect as a stable democracy’.[10]\n\nMargaret’s newsreel appearance at the pit is a foretaste of Diana. But Margaret doesn’t seem quite as adept at the media business, wanting to get closer to the people – in this case, the miners – and show some individuality and conscience. Phillip is something of an ally to her, as frustrated moderniser of an institution that stubbornly, imperiously demands it stay above the human fray. We get some sense that the public sympathise with Townsend and Margaret, but not nearly enough depth on the public attitudes.\n\nBrilliant performances include Alex Jennings, imperiously arch and acidic as the Duke of Windsor, ever ready with tart, cutting asides. Jared Harris is affecting as his brother, George VI; as Cooke argues, Harris ‘turns in one of the most subtle and weirdly moving performances I’ve seen this year, perhaps this decade’, plus he gets to use the word ‘cunt’.[11] Pip Torrens has the requisite ruthless, barbed edge as royal fixer Tommy Lascelles, who is at the heart of the heartless operation. Matt Smith does a fine job with suggesting the buffoon, the malcontent and the moderniser within Prince Phillip. At times, he comes across as like a proto-Blairite, at others he channels Bertie Wooster, or even Mr Toad. It’s an intriguing, subtle portrait of a foreigner, affected by his own experience of Greek class conflict, playing at essentially eccentric Englishness… This is one of many examples supporting Johnston’s argument that this ‘quality and prestige’ production manages to avoid being pitched to ‘a broader common denominator’.[12]\n\nMatt Smith does a fine job with suggesting the buffoon, the malcontent and the moderniser within Prince Phillip. At times, he comes across as like a proto-Blairite, at others he channels Bertie Wooster, or even Mr Toad.\n\nJohn Lithgow is magnificent as Churchill, enabling viewers to love or loathe him, often simultaneously. His personal arrogance, entitlement and humbleness towards the crown all come across, as does the sense that this is a man clinging onto office due to delusions of grandeur and personal preeminence. We see how he struggles with changing times, yet oddly there’s no mention of his preoccupation with writing history himself. The final volumes of his A History of the English Speaking Peoples were published in 1956-58 – which led to BBC’s absurdly expansive, reviled 26-episode Churchill’s People dramatization of 1975, so this infirm, drink-addled eighty year-old must have been working on these books alongside his painting hobby, not to mention the small matter of his prime ministerial duties…\n\nThe excellent episode #9 ‘Assassins’ balances a necessary, representative picture of the Queen’s horse-racing milieu with compelling scenes of Churchill being literally depicted by his fellow but more modernist artist Graham Sutherland (Stephen Dillane). This shows how out-of-time Churchill has become, and how culturally divided and torn the country was between a metropolitan elite that questioned and liked avant-garde art, and the older, more traditional establishment represented by the likes of Churchill and the Queen Mother. Churchill engages in dialogue with the modernising times, in surprising ways, even if this all leads to a focus on Churchill and Sutherland’s lives and not explicitly to wider socio-historical issues. This writer hopes Lithgow has the occasional contribution to the story as it is told of the mid-50s to mid-60s…\n\nAs Peter Wilby has argued, it is ultimately an unflattering portrait of the monarchy: ‘The Crown shows something cold and inhumane – almost a moral vacuum – at the heart of monarchy. Is this really an ideal that “ordinary people” should strive towards?’[13] That hasn’t stopped a lot of the coverage and ‘criticism’ being entirely preoccupied by the show’s trinkets, trappings and costumes. It often avoids the problem with historical dramas identified by New Left Marxist Colin McArthur in 1978: that they so often entirely personalise historical events and are prey to the British culture’s cult of the individual, with Jenny (1974), Edward the Seventh (1975) and Lillie (1978) among the exemplars. McArthur stated that ‘the category of the individual is regarded as a natural structuring category in the milieu of television (historical) drama.’[14] However, this show’s title is The Crown, and this entitling does reflect its focus being on a specific institution rather than sole ‘key players’. While, as Cooke remarks, it tends to select events from 1947-55 which best ‘illuminate the personalities involved’, I would argue we get a strong sense of how it works as a systemic structure.[15] The individual stories illumine the deeper power structures.\n\nCooke is perceptive on how this epic historical drama captures the addictive expansiveness of monarchical tradition:\n\n‘Morgan explains us to ourselves. We’re all Russian dolls, products of our parents’ times as well as our own. Think of what your grandmother might have felt in 1952 on seeing three generations of queens – Mary, and two Elizabeths – in their mourning veils. The eldest of these three was born in 1867, and the youngest is on the throne still. Morgan understands that this is mind-bending and potentially revelatory, and if you don’t, that is your loss.’[16]\n\nThis stimulating reading chimes with my hope that the series will become as much a portrait of the wider public as the royals. Hopefully, Morgan will investigate how the country failed to become the egalitarian society that would have put an ornate, bloated monarchy behind it.\n\nLiverpool Edge Hill academic Hannah Andrews has commented that ‘conflict between duty to country and to husband remains the only dramatic narrative afforded a married queen.’[17] She is right that the Queen is often sidelined. While there is a strong scene where she ticks off the public-school politicians for their Machiavellian meddling, like ‘nanny’, virtually all of her narrative seems to be based on the familial vs. national duty trope. Her hiring of a private tutor (Alan Williams), in a bid to become more informed following her unchallenging education, doesn’t really lead anywhere. Or hasn’t yet… Episode 9’s focus on her friend Porchey only really serves to highlight her alternately tense and distant relations with Philip.\n\nAs Wilby argues, the monarchy is depicted as a cold, inhuman, manipulative institution, with the Queen Mother, assorted Archbishops and Lascelles in particular as individuals perpetuating the systemic chill. Claire Foy does a good job of showing how Elizabeth Windsor is compromised and has to be crushed in favour of the unchanging, symbolic ‘Elizabeth Regina’.\n\nWe are given a picture of what Robert Lacey referred to in 1977 as the Queen’s ‘insistent grasp of normality’.[18] Crucially, she ultimately decides against developing her intellect beyond the limiting ‘constitutionalism’ dictated her by printed and spoken mentors Bagehot and Churchill. She opts for duty, restraint and blandness: to best preserve the institution of the monarchy; questioning is out of the question. This portrayal of the Queen gets more subtle and perceptive as the series develops. Nothing in the portrayal of the Queen Mother makes me warm to a woman I have always regarded as dodgy, an expert waver from balconies, yes, but with objectionable qualities behind the smiles.\n\nWhat future instalments of The Crown need is to show more of its ‘subjects’: a wider tapestry of the ‘united kingdom’ that the institution of the crown aims to unify. However, this ‘long-form’ series does succeed in portraying the royals’ essentially trapped nature; as Morgan reflected, ‘We the people don’t know what we want from them, whether they’re our gods or our slaves, and so they’re trapped in a hellish predicament.’[19]\n\n[1] Hitchens, P.

U. de Lisboa, Portugal) placed Bond in the context of Portuguese cultural history. She mentioned how Fleming had stayed at the Palacio Estoril Hotel – to the west of Lisbon on the coast – in 1941, also using its casino, which yielded some of his later writing. During WW2, Portugal was officially neutral, which reminded me of Rui Lopes’ paper from Spying on Spies last year. Moreira explained some further influence of Portugal on Bond, with Guincho Beach proving a setting in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969).\n\nMoreira located Bond as ‘the most popular figure in entertainment’ with repetitive narrative structures important to how Fleming established his archetypal hero. She identified product placement as a significant part of the series’ persistent appeal. Using Galician and Bordeau’s four category model (2004) of how product placement is used in films (1. Verbal/hand placement, 2. Implied endorsement, 3. Signage, 4. Clutter), she argued it allowed the series to develop throughout time and adapt to changing tastes.\n\nWe were then treated to some revealing cultural history in the shape of the Whicker’s World ‘James Bond Special’ (TX: BBC-1, 25th March 1967). This documentary was of Pinewood Studios in the time of You Only Live Twice’s making. Whicker’s phrases – such as “a modern fairy tale”, “space age gubbins”, “the Bondwagon”, “Bondiana”, “no message to sell” and “like Kleenex!” – amounted to a smugly indulgent, supercilious reveling in the trivial nature of pop culture and Bond’s amorality.\n\nThis documentary didn’t just reveal that Cubby Broccoli’s grandfather introduced broccoli the vegetable, but indirectly showed a stark difference to 2016 in sexual mores – pre-1970s ‘women’s lib’ – with women marginalised or patronised in the show’s preferred reading. A particularly telling section saw YOLT screenwriter Roald Dahl drily responding to Whicker’s eager ‘wink-wink’ question about how Bond “gets through women”.\n\nConnery’s appearance showed how comparatively low-key the nature of celebrity was in 1967, compared with 2016; he comes across as down to earth and mildly embarrassed by the absurd level of media attention he was experiencing. He also focused on how the books ‘lack humour’ and how he liked how the films increased it.\n\nThere wasn’t time to watch the whole programme; then, a Q&A pertaining to Moreira’s paper and the Whicker programme. Alan ‘Gus’ Burton referred back to his own paper – the lineage of 1964-73 British spy films – and how Hammerhead included location usage of Lisbon to signify the exotic.\n\nMention was made of the democratising impact of brands on culture, from the 1960s onwards. This appearance of luxury could be compared to the supposed ‘privileging’ of audiences’ being able to vote for ‘talent’ on Hughie Green’s TV shows in the same era, as Joe Moran has detailed in his excellent article for History Workshop, ”Stand Up and Be Counted’: Hughie Green, the 1970s and Popular Memory’.\n\nA delegate highlighted that items like Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green in the 2006 Casino Royale)’s necklace will set you back £2000, showing money’s lack of democracy. There was discussion, linking back to Felix Thompson’s Day 1 paper, of how the programme showed a pre-mass tourism age – with Whicker’s formulaic parade of wealthy people and foregrounding of luxury. The almost parodic silliness of Whicker’s persona perhaps chimed with the fact that YOLT was more negatively received, with many film critics discussing the formula as growing ‘stale’. Cultural change was commented on: casinos are now seen as tacky. There was juxtaposition of the worldly, urbane Roger Moore with Daniel Craig in CR – ‘the first Bond to be drunk on screen’. This was seen as influenced by the Bourne films, with Jason Bourne’s ‘grim and gritty lifestyle’ – at least in the early films – being anti-Bondian. Some anticipation was evident in the room for the new Jason Bourne (2016).\n\nThe next panel included myself and was all a little rushed, with lunch on the way! Both papers made use of video matter. Toby Manning began by showing clips from Smiley’s People (1982) and US drama series Homeland (2011 – date). His clips proved that dialogue in the latter was practically lifted from the former, eliciting belly laughs from conference goers… He contrasted the former’s advocating of détente with the latter’s anti-Iranian ‘terrorist’ hawkishness. Manning argued that the JLC TV adaptations provide a ‘source book, a template’ used by what he described as the ‘trashier’ Homeland. The adaptations reflected the ‘posh end of heritage’. He commented on the oddity of a ‘hate-fuelling’ Homeland using as its template the humanist hero Smiley and also considering that JLC was very critical of the ‘War on Terror’.\n\nManning described Saul Berenson as the best thing about it: possessing probity and Smiley-like moral scruples. By season 3, JLC was being channeled ever more explicitly, as an attempt by the show to lend itself ‘legitimacy’. Enhanced by his opposition to the Iraq War, JLC is often seen as the great liberal conscience; Manning commented that Homeland gets to seem liberal while being hawkish. Saul increasingly gets given Smiley’s lines. Carrie is said to enact all of the mad and bad stuff, with Saul being scrupulous initially but ultimately endorsing her actions. Season 3 channels The Spy Who Came in from the Cold and also quoted several other plagiaristic lines. He unfavourably contrasted Berenson’s ultimate concern being with his own career with Smiley’s wider sense of duty.\n\nManning began to conclude by criticising the Manichean idea that ‘the enemy’ is peculiarly inhuman and brutal. He said that it was one thing to portray Communists as barbaric – “You can argue with that and I do” – but that it was quite another to argue that Muslims are inherently barbaric and stated that there was a racist element at work in Homeland… He closed by saying that Smiley was a liberal hawk as early as in The Honourable Schoolboy; he executes Dieter Frei in Call from the Dead, is implicated in Liz and Leamas’ setting-up in TSWCIFTC and allows Bill Haydon’s death in TTSS. His ruthless pursuit of Karla is due to his loss of faith in détente. Manning’s excellent long conclusion ended with how the spy genre works to reassure us that the threat is real and to give us avatars like Berenson and Smiley, doing the job ‘as decently as possible in the circumstances’. These ‘reassuring hawks’ wring their hands on our behalf but ultimately enact the dominant ideological impulses.\n\nNext was my own paper, available here. I argued, akin to Manning about Homeland, that the Christopher Hampton-scripted film version of The Honorary Consul ultimately endorses hegemonic politics, ignoring much of the notable counter-hegemonic discourse of Greene’s original 1973 novel. Unfortunately, the timings in the schedule were slightly off so there was no specific Q&A just for this panel. Though there was another good cold buffet lunch to go straight into! Wherein I discussed Greene with Felix Thompson, who mentioned how comparatively forgotten oppositional representations to the NATO hegemony now are…\n\nThen, it was onto the very final panel of the day; this was delivered by three gents from King’s College London, with complementary papers on recent James Bond texts. Edward Lamberti began with analysis of the ‘shortest’ Bond film, Quantum of Solace (2008), using Judith Butler’s performativity theory and – as more of a curve-ball – J.L. Austin’s Speech-Act Theory (1955). This was the only mention in the conference of this theory that language brings things into being: “It’s a girl!” “We find the defendant guilty”. Some use was made of Sandy Petry’s Speech Acts and Literary Theory (1990) as a framework.\n\nHe developed an analysis of Bond in QOS as conveying a sense of loss and melancholy, mentioning how Cinema Paradiso (1988) reflecting a sense of the past as better. “A newly Bourne secret agent” elicited a groan or two! This grittier Bond’s isolation and alienation was argued to contain insight into the structures of society. Lamberti asserted that a ‘productive melancholy’ on Bond’s part reflected a rebelliousness seen as a threat by M.\n\nThe next speaker Christopher Holiday (KCL) focused on recent portrayals of London on screen seem fixated on showing it battered into oblivion. Use was made of Charlotte Brunsdon’s London in Cinema (2007) to develop his thoughts on a ‘London has fallen’ cycle of films, which included some recent Bonds. The US-made The Day the Earth Was Stopped (2008) was derided. A clip was used from G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013). These films were more broadly contextualised in a lineage of British science fiction cinema: The Giant Behemoth (1959), Konga (1961) and Gorgo (1961) – the titular monster of whom was to some the ‘English Godzilla’ – and I.Q. Hunter was quoted on this tradition.\n\nThe true ‘London sequence’ was argued to have started with the relatively politicised V for Vendetta (2005) and Children of Men (2006), though key scenes in this latter film are in the UKIP-terrain of ‘Bexhill’*, East Sussex, though the detention camp scenes were actually filmed in Aldershot. PD James-adaptation COM is a very notable film, with satirising of nihilistic post-modernist neo-liberalism and an against-type casting of Michael Caine as a romantic hippie.\n\nLondon was being used more, not just for British films, but by others – as British crews were experienced, now generally non-unionised and there was greater studio space. Mention was made of a 2013 Telegraph article by John Hiscock, who seems to have written about the subject since at least the late-90s.\n\nThe SIS Building (1994) was used in GoldenEye (1995). Holiday discussed Craig’s Bond as being strongly aligned with London through his unveiling as Bond on a Royal Marine speedboat on the Thames on 14th October 2005. He showed this clip and it was undoubtedly powerful iconography, no doubt intended to counterbalance Craig’s more working-class, northern origins with patriotic ballast.\n\nEthical issues were discussed, with relation to the criticism London Has Fallen (2016) itself had received from 7/7 victims’ families for its ‘insensitivity’. Holiday referred to the most recent JB film SPECTRE (2015) as ‘haunted cinema’, a sort of prelude to the next paper.\n\nSpeaker 26, the last of the Conference, was Alexander Sergeant (again KCL) who discussed the function of the “Bond girl” as a Structuring Archetype in SPECTRE, according to Jungian spectator theory. He said he wanted to steer away from the common – in the 1970s-90s, anyway – field of Lacan/Metz/Freud psychoanalytical approaches to film. Can’t say I blamed him, really!\n\nHis paper focused on individuation and how archetypes have roots in the collective unconscious. Dr Madeleine Swann – a psychologist working in the Austrian Alps – in SPECTRE is referred to as a contradiction to the ‘Bond Girl’ archetype, who along with Bond will have to return. Proust was referred to.\n\nThe Q&A incorporated all three KCL speakers, Toby Manning and I. Sadly, I can remember little of it but that I made a point about social class and the poacher character in Went the Day Well? It only remained for me to make my way to the station with some other delegates and go through a grueling nigh on nine-hour journey back to the north east!\n\nFour days after the end of the conference came the Brexit vote.\n\n*Bexhill and Battle UK parliamentary constituency is a rock-solid Tory seat, which even had a Tory majority of 11,100 in 1997, and is now over 20,000 with UKIP in second place. Both Stuart Wheeler and Nigel Farage – two of the most reprehensible influences in our body politic in the last 20 years – stood here and got in excess of 2,500 votes.\n\nFriday 18th June 2016\n\nPlymouth\n\nThis day proved to be perhaps the most enlightening conference day I have yet attended in my fledgling academic ‘career’, if it can be called that. I would particularly highlight Chris Smith and Joseph Oldham’s papers for their forensic detail and historical reach. I look forward to books by Nick Barnett and Oldham respectively on ‘First Cold War’ culture in Britain and the history of the spy and conspiracy genres on British television.\n\nThe Liverpudlian Cat Mahoney (Northumbria University) began proceedings with an analysis of the TV version of Marvel’s Agent Carter – is/was Peggy a new popular feminist hero? This ‘physically and mentally tough’ character was seen as becoming much more than just the love interest of Captain America; figuring in 1946 NYC in a Vera Lynn-like role, with an English accent. The focus given to Bletchley Park was mentioned, and Mahoney argued that Peggy was much more feminist than post-feminist, being very practical in nature. She has a John Steed equivalent in Edwin Jarvis. Mahoney mentioned the series’ ‘cautionary tale’ as regards the character Whitney Frost, pointing to a ‘Women in Refrigerator’ trope.\n\nThis paper was a closely argued case that Peggy ‘leans towards being feminist’, without any of the internalising of the male gaze that you see with post-feminism. Yet, Mahoney acknowledged Sarah Miles’ criticism that this was a Marvel ‘version of feminism’, with Peggy as the only truly significant female character with agency and who is also white.\n\nNext was a connected paper: Laura Crossley (Edge Hill University, Liverpool), dissecting differing manifestations of Peter O’Donnell’s Modesty Blaise character, from her origins in a London Evening Standard cartoon strip in 1963 (running thirty-nine years) to novels and film and radio adaptations. Pulp Fiction (1994) was later to allude to it, with Travolta’s character seen reading Peter O’Donnell’s 1965 MB novel.\n\nJoseph Losey’s 1966 film was referred to as strongly ‘camp’ ‘oddity’ which has its pleasures. Crossley quoted Losey’s intent to make a film that would end all of the James Bond films – not a notably successful outcome there, Joe! She showed a few clips from the film, which looked unusual, proto-postmodernist and with some anti-imperialist political charge to it.\n\nCrossley seemed to value the novel most highly; praising how Modesty is represented as displaying physical prowess and being better than a man: Kingsley Amis and his wife were fans of the Blaise books, and KA wrote a fan’s letter to O’Donnell – which Crossley showed. It seemed to me this was part of the cultural climate which had enabled Cathy Gale and Emma Peel to become ground-breaking televisual characters.\n\nCrossley linked Willie Garvin – Modesty’s companion – with the previous day’s Bond – Palmer – Callan educational formulation, saying that Garvin was ‘lower’ even than Callan, having gone to a reform school. She explained how O’Donnell satirises the old-boy network, with colonialism open to some question in the strips and novel. Strip #3678 was said to include the interrogative: ‘We could appeal to the unions, maybe?’ It seems, unsurprisingly, that this was a strip from circa May 1975…\n\nThe Q&A revealed some interesting discussion of the film Spy (dir. Paul Feig, 2015) with Melissa McCarthy, which was argued as going beyond mere jokes about MM’s unusual physicality. Yet, there was a questioning of how so many of these sort of texts depict violence and killing people as the main focus of what these female characters do and are about. Are they then that different from the Bonds, or mere female ‘versions’ of an ethically questionable normative hero?\n\nCrossley argued that Blaise is the dominant one in the pairing with Garvin, but that it is heteronormative, though no less progressive in the context of the 1960s. Mahoney referred to Dotty in Agent Carter, who has signs of some deviancy, possibly linked to Soviet training. This may just seem to us to be part of the constraining binary of Cold War ideological thinking. The discussion included Philip’s non-heteronormative activities as Soviet deep cover agent in The Americans and Norman Pett’s significant comic-strip Jane, which ran in the Daily Mirror from 1932-59. There was an attempt to update for the early-60s with Daughter of Jane by Roger Woddis running from 1961-63. Woddis (1917-93) is an interesting figure, a writer of one of my favourite episodes of The Prisoner, ‘Hammer into Anvil’ and Communist Party member who in the 1970s-90s wrote poems for the New Statesman and Punch. Also, curiously enough, Jane was adapted for TV with Blakes 7’s Glynis Barber as Jane for two series in 1982 and 1984 respectively.\n\nThe Q&A ended with some righteous focus on how Rosa Klebb represented the ‘monstrous feminine’ and also how the recent case of Star Wars reflected a lack of progress: none of the action figures were female.\n\nSpeaker 12 of the conference was via Skype, Claudia Sternberg (University of Leeds). This paper analysed whether WW1 screen espionage reflected female empowerment. Lang’s Spione (1928) and George Fitzmaurice’s pre-Hays Code Mata Hari (1931) were mentioned as films which reflected a sensationalising of the female spy as a glamour figure. Where, in fact, the female spy was subject to low-pay and low-status, with women being seen as ‘less able to feel patriotism; and being ‘prone to romantic sentiment’. Working-class women were left out of spy films. Victor Saville’s I Was a Spy (1933) was analysed as one of the key British examples of the sub-genre.\n\nShe gave an overview of many 1930s and 40s films, and stated that the cycle came to an end in 1945, to be replaced in a few years by the Cold War. The 1991 TV Ashenden re-adapts W. Somerset Maugham and incorporated much autobiographical material, and added a homosexual romance.\n\nHistorian Chris Smith (University of Kent, Canterbury) placed the WW2-related Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes films in their historical context. This was an excellent paper, limiting much analysis of the film texts and taking the films as sources among many. He made good use of Monthly Film Bulletin reviews, and placed the films’ content and reception in the wider historical context. He discussed the ‘Fifth Column’ as a moral panic before Stanley Cohen had coined the concept. I spoke to the speaker later when we were on a boat trip.\n\nSmith referred to the government’s failed ‘Silent Column’ propaganda campaign. This encouraged the telling off and prosecution of rumour-mongers, like ‘Miss Leaky Mouth’. He mentioned a Spectator editorial criticising the wasting of time that this all amounted to.\n\nThe combative Kent academic praised Ealing’s The Next of Kin (1942) as a superior propaganda film. When it was first shown privately, it showed the British commandos losing; Churchill insisted on the British commandos winning, so the ending was changed. Smith provided statistical detail which highlighted the importance of cinema: over 4000 cinemas were open in the UK with over 19 million cinema-goers – and the BBC, with 90% of homes having a radio.\n\nIn the Q&A, Smith had more chance to discuss left-wing Scottish historian Angus Calder’s The People’s War: Britain, 1939-1945 (1969). He argued that in Sherlock Holmes and The Voice of Terror (1942), the people come to Holmes’ aid: that it isn’t just about the hero, it’s the British public who are agents and contributors. He made reference to Roland Barthes and myth, and said more important than debunking them is considering why the powerful are trying to create myths.\n\nAmong many films that got mentioned was Cottage to Let (1941) with Alastair Sim, a recommendation in itself! Toby Manning and Joseph Oldham made reference to George Smiley as being rather like Sherlock Holmes: both are essentially analysts of data, like historians. Oldham added that many WW2 spies were historians.\n\nSecond Scouse speaker and conference co-organiser Nicholas Barnett (Plymouth University) discussed the BBC’s retro spy-drama The Game (2014) and its representation of the 1970s. The cultural historian saw this 1972-set series as a period piece, and how it is looking back on the Cold War ‘with a sense of nostalgia’. The title contains the chess-like Cold War metaphor; a very blatant engagement with ‘the familiar’ by writer Toby Whithouse. Barnett referred to inter-textual references to George Cockroft’s novel The Dice Man (1971). In episodes 5 and 6, the game becomes poker. He described there being a subtler narrative of chess in the first three episodes, with its copying of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1979), with the last three copying The Americans. This lack of originality prefigures what Manning was to say about Homeland on Sunday. The series becomes a game of chess between Joe and Odin, who makes himself more sinister through peeling apples.\n\nThe clichés have to be there for it to be a spy drama, and are part of a view of the 1970s as a ‘comforting’ time: the ‘sinister Russian enemy’, the mole within MI5, a fairground scene with the protagonist having a gun, signposting dialogue like “welcome to the end of our story” (episode 6), a dead letter drop (episode 2), Russian vodka, a clunky camera, reel-to-reel tapes and open-plan committee rooms in Birmingham City Library used as a set. In the show, the 1970s are where, while it less comforting than WW2, ‘we knew where we stood with the Russians’.\n\nBarnett went on to discuss a ‘lost politics of class in British society’. Waterhouse, the head of counter intelligence, pin-striped suited and has a servant; he was contrasted with Joe, state-school educated like Callan. ‘Daddy’ (Brian Cox) is referred to as a post-war masculine ideal: at once the war hero but also the family man – which Barnett compared with Lynne Segal’s analysis. Chloe Pirrie’s Wendy is presented as a voice of reason, and Waterhouse eventually follows her advice. Daddy talks of WW2 as a war ‘that made heroes’, feeling a nostalgia for the previous war; making the audience perhaps think that people like Daddy were heroes of the Cold War. This is described as an attempt by Whithouse to draw some lines of continuity between WW2 and the CW.\n\nHe mentioned the show’s depiction of working-class areas; the working-class comedian telling an Irish joke complete with a garish jacket and a comb-over, pubs with beer mugs with handles and smoking – that past that is within our memory but is just beyond us. I would have liked a bit more analysis of this, but this was no doubt due to time constraints…\n\nThe public information film Protect and Survive is used anachronistically – it was actually made in 1976, not in 1972. Barnett quoted historian Matthew Grant’s comments about oral history interviewees’ misremembering of the past: people saying they’d seen Duck and Cover (1951), which was never shown in Britain.\n\nBarnett finished by summarising how The Game portrays the Cold War as a simpler time with its continuities with WW2, and its noble, familiar intelligence game, but also as part of the transition towards today’s less comforting world, with a more dangerous game with increasingly endangered civilians.\n\nJustin Harrison (Learning Commons Librarian, University of Victoria BC, Canada) gave a rare power-point-less talk. He discussed the representations of Britishness in The Avengers. He discussed the confident, optimistic national identity, as projected via the lion on the shield in the Tara King titles sequence. He emphasised the ‘mutual respect’ between the generations conveyed by the series and its core audience being young women in the 18-34 age group. This discussion of Steed as an establishment gave rise to my thought that the agent might be an attempt to redeem the public-school spy following Philby and co…\n\nHarrison argued that tradition and modernity co-existed; there’s the British lion, but then also Linda Thorson’s character is simply known as ‘Tara King’ without any marriage title. He discussed the inconsequential nature of much of the show’s narratives, with plot often being merely a justification for a champagne cork popping at the end. The last Tara King episode ‘Bizarre’ (TX: 22/05/1969) was used as an exemplar in its ‘preposterous’ plot. Writer on 1960s Britain Mark Donnelly was used to discuss how the show kept reality away.\n\nHarrison concluded by mentioning the intriguing sounding ‘Two’s a Crowd’ (TX: 17/12/1965), one of very few Avengers stories to identify its villains as Soviets and thus more directly engage in the Cold War. On the long train to Plymouth and before bed following the first night of the conference, I had watched two Tara King episodes on my laptop: ‘The Rotters’, which partly fitted Harrison’s depiction of Steed as rural gent, with signifiers of ‘English oak’, ‘dry rot’ and a red-pillar box, and ‘The Interrogators’ with villain Christopher Lee backed by Chinese army uniformed helpers. This latter was rather better, and showed an at least tangential relation to the Cold War.\n\nJoseph Oldham (Warwick University) said that his paper came out of the previous Spying on Spies conference. And reflected how little focus there had been there on the 1990s, basically between the end of the Cold War and the start of the War on Terror. This can be seen as a lost decade in spy fiction and Oldham wanted to question whether or not this was due to the lull in major geopolitical tensions. This led to his focus on Bugs (1995-99), televised in the ‘Doctor Who’ Saturday evening slot and which often gained 10 million viewers; a series which he said had been ‘written out of the academic narrative’. He focused mainly on the first two series’.\n\nIts focus was on the ‘miniaturized wizardry and computer cunning’ and ‘excitement of technological gadgetry for good and evil’. Even Charles Jennings’ positive review in The Observer was patronising: Jennings viewing it as ‘light-hearted entertainment and not to be taken seriously’. The Radio Times spread to promote the first series placed it in the heritage of The Avengers (1961-69), The New Avengers (1976-77) and The Professionals (1978-82). Brian Clemens had been brought on board as ‘series consultant’.\n\nOldham used David Buxton’s analysis of The Avengers as a ‘pop series’, a historically specific thing that could only have existed the way it did in the 1960s. He mentioned Felix Thompson’s comments on Clemens’ 1970s works being different and then how the Radio Times spread positioned Bugs as ‘we are doing The Avengers again’. The 1990s background included the nostalgia boom of 1960s adventure series being repeated on BBC-2 and Channel 4, which fed into the ‘Cool Britannia’ moment which was heavily indebted to the 1960s style. He also mentioned the exaggerated use of such imagery by Austin Powers, and how Bugs didn’t go in for this sort of iconography.\n\nBugs’ aesthetic has bold colours, indebted to the 1960s pop-futurism, but mixed in with glassy, chrome visuals which reflected what Oldham described as a ‘neo-liberal futurism’. By being largely shot on location in the London Docklands, formerly derelict, which had been massively redeveloped in the Thatcher era as a hub of the financial sector – the process which is incisively investigated by Andy Beckett in Promised You a Miracle: Why 1980-82 Made Modern Britain (2015). He mentioned The Observer’s commenting that ‘You will never see a pre-1990 building in Bugs’; Oldham said this was an exaggeration – it should have been pre-1980. The series sees this area (unnamed in the series) as ‘massively important and a key point of vulnerability’. Canary Wharf is said to appear in every episode of series 3. There’s an obsession with landmarks, and also innovations such as driver-less trains on the Docklands Light Railway.\n\nThe retro element is more to do with narrative than visual aesthetics. The common gripe of 1990s TV drama was articulated by Brian Clemens himself in the publicity for Bugs: ‘Normally when the BBC or ITV have a free evening slot, they stick in a copper, a vet or a doctor and they’re all so downbeat and depressing’. This was the idea of there being much ‘soapification’, issue-led stuff, and there being a need to return to the adventure show and ‘rollercoaster’ viewing. Oldham mentioned how there’s little ongoing narrative in Bugs and how most episodes end with a terrible joke and they all laugh!\n\nUnlike in the 1960s TV adventure series’, Oldham described the spies in Bugs as not working for the state but working as a ‘small-business enterprise’. He placed this in the context of the 1990s dot.com boom and Thatcherite ideology. Key was the characters’ role as ‘surveillance experts’; this was before Big Brother and CSI were on British TV. He said that Bugs was part of the gadget renaissance of the 1990s, as in GoldenEye and contrasted them with older, Orwellian British TV drama series’ like 1990 (1977-78). Their company was called ‘Gizmos’ and their use of surveillance is portrayed as quirky, small and not as threatening as the archetypal Orwellian state surveillance operation.\n\nOldham concluded his excellent paper by arguing that Spooks continues the glassy aesthetic of Bugs and that the neglected 1990s series represents how we got from the 1960s adventure series and the Cold War to Spooks and the War on Terror. He plausibly argued fot it as a key text right in the midst of what we might term the 1990s interregnum.\n\nThe Q&A included a question by Felix Thompson about how serious was the focus on Canary Wharf and the banking sector. Oldham commented on the uncertainty of the tone between irony and seriousness. When Barnett asked about the villains, Oldham said that eco-terrorists tended to come up a bit.\n\nBarnett said that nostalgia is usually linked to declinism but that that doesn’t seem to be the case with Cold War nostalgia, in the context of what is generally seen as the ‘relative success’ of the Cold War.\n\nCatherine Edwards (ICCS Manager, Birmingham University) tackled narrative beginnings in John le Carré adaptations, though this also sprouted off into discussion of In Bruges (2008) with its bickering hitmen giving the names Cranham and Blakely when they check into a hotel: inter-textually referencing Kenneth and Colin, who played the hitmen in a mid-80s TV version of Pinter’s The Dumb Waiter. This got me thinking about how comparatively little explored is Harold Pinter’s relation to the Cold War – despite such plays as One for the Road, and also his manifest exploration of communication ambiguities, complexities of identity in so many of his other plays which were staged in the ‘intelligence’ and ‘spy’ era.\n\nEdwards also discussed the problematic nature of ‘beginnings’, utilising the example of Coney theatre company’s immersive methodology, with their plays existing from before, to and after the ‘actual production’, living on afterwards in minds and in its influence.\n\nEdward Biddulph (independent scholar) was next, describing On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1968) as his favourite Bond film and exploring some of the franchise’s memes. The reach and sway of JB was emphasised with the example of Allen Dulles’ claim that in recruitment he would look for people with Bond’s qualities.\n\nMemes were defined as units of cultural selection, like genes. Among many examples were ‘Bond, James Bond’ and ‘Shaken, not stirred’. Biddulph traced the dominance of these, as well as ‘Bond Girl’: singer of Skyfall Bond theme Adele was asked in 2013 about whether she’d want to be a ‘Bond Girl’ and when interviewed used the collocation naturally herself. Biddulph used multiple examples of these memes amid newspaper and other cultural discourses from the 1960s until today.\n\nBiddulph extracted probably the biggest laugh of the conference with his captioned image adapting the ‘Seven Ages of Man’ ape-to-man progress for Bond, including ‘Campus Rogerus’, a Safari-suit-clad Moore among the others!\n\nBarbara Korte (University of Freiburg) discussed the agency of the agent in SPECTRE (2015), analysing surveillance and prevention concepts in today’s supposedly ‘post-heroic times’. The meme of ‘friendly surveillance’ was located in this recent Bond film, with MI6 being shown to be more transparent. This film and Skyfall (2012), representative of the technologically reliant era, were said to display nostalgia for the days of the field agent when there was a perceived greater level of agency and inventiveness. Cold War inter-textuality was present in SPECTRE, with M using the phrase “George Orwell’s worst nightmare”. Korte linked the location of a meeting in Rome to the Italian capital’s previous status as a fascist capital in the Mussolini era.\n\nThe Q&A included discussion of the anticipation before texts are released and reaction to texts after release, alongside a focus on the precise rhythm and timing of phrases in the Bond films. This, again, got me thinking of Pinter, with the precise, metronomic focus on pauses inherited from Beckett. Korte’s power-point slide of still images from SPECTRE was much focused on, with Craig’s Bond conveyed as a Romantic hero, bare-chested within sublime landscapes. One of them resembled Caspar David Friederich’s 1818 oil painting Wanderer above the Sea of Fog.\n\nThere was additional focus on how SPECTRE had a conservative ideology in how security is provided by the state, with the ‘responsible’ presentation of M. Someone mentioned the ‘disconcerting’ role of Lucas North character, played by Richard Armitage in seasons 7-9 of Spooks (BBC-1, 2002-11). This show interestingly involved firebrand leftist writer Howard Brenton in its early series’.\n\nRosie White (Northumbria University) was the conference’s 20th – and the day’s ‘Keynote’ – speaker. White gave an interesting talk, comparing and dissecting the screen personae of Leslie Howard in the title role of The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934) and Tom Hiddleston as Jonathan Pine. Power-point included an evocative use of a gif animated image of Howard that showed his expressive quality and eyes. She spoke of being both seduced and discomfited by early 2016’s ratings success The Night Manager, with its narrative of the arms trade mingling with cinematic glamour. Mention was made of how JLC’s ethically engaged tone was downplayed in this BBC international co-production which marketed itself as ‘Quality British Television’ and encouraged press discourses of Pine being an audition for the role of James Bond.\n\nWhite was eloquently uncomfortable at the ‘exotic, saturated colour contrasts’ and what she saw as the fetishisation of the lives of the “super-rich”. Indeed, I would support this – remembering how much The Guardian in a Saturday edition played on the series’ popularity to pitch its locations as holiday destinations: for its presumably more affluent readers. While I did enjoy the series, its pleasures were somewhat out of place in the light not just of the arms dealing narrative, but also the Austerity Britain we are living through.\n\nShe spoke of the contrast between the mythical Englishness shown in Howard’s gentle features and Hiddleston’s more studied and manufactured projections of English identity, which showed a lot more conscious ‘work’. White argued persuasively that the myth of Englishness today is spread via more globalised cultural industries, and is increasingly hollow. Howard was once the subject of an old Jeffrey Richards Listener article I chanced on in the British Library; Richards portrayed him as a national phenomenon comparable to Priestley and Churchill. White alluded to this same idea of the Howard as a powerful myth, even more so due to his premature death.\n\nShe referred to the film’s use of John of Gaunt’s ‘This Sceptred Isle’ speech from Shakespeare’s Richard II. As I mentioned elsewhere, Graham Greene was intensely critical of how this speech omitted reference to Robert Southwell’s execution and the turmoil experienced by Catholics in England.\n\nPimpernel Smith (1941) was analysed for how it demonstrated Richards’ description of the national characteristic of the English ‘sense of humour’ as a ‘redoubtable bulwark against tyranny.’ Smith, in rebuke to our present-day ideas, always has a book on him – rather like Niven’s jovial renaissance-man Peter Carter in A Matter of Life and Death (1946). Another consciously ‘elegiac’ Jeffrey Richards essay from the Aldgate-Richards collection Britain Can Take It was quoted from: ‘a mystic England’, ‘an England of the soul’ and so forth…\n\nWith the ethereal gif of Howard playing, I thought of how indexical the two terms “English” and “gentleman” always seem to be… I also thought of ‘The News in English’, Graham Greene’s story of a Lord Haw Haw figure, but who has the tones of ‘a typical English don’. I thought also of how excluded the working-classes have been; an area Greene touched on with Purves, the poacher, getting a key role in his short story, ‘The Lieutenant Died Last’. Interestingly comparable to Howard is David Niven, not least in The Elusive Pimpernel – a Powell and Pressuburger curio that I have never seen and is damnably tricky to track down.\n\nWhite reflected on just how dominant the Dragon School in Oxford and its ‘Eminent Dragon’ alumni have been in British politics and culture: Alain de Botton, John Betjeman, Hugh Gaitskell, Rory Stewart, Tim Henman, Dom Joly… This was followed, of course, by reference to the casting of Eminent Dragons Hugh Laurie, Toms Hollander and Hiddleston in TNM. She referred to Laurence Fox’s defensive reaction (“Shut up!”) to Julie Walters’ comments on the now-entrenched class divisions in British acting. White finished pointedly with an oppositional image that made an unarguable case for the situation of the advantaged vs. the disadvantaged in the British arts today… During the Q&A, Laura Crossley helped tie some of the threads together by saying she’d read that Hiddleston had been quoted saying he’d love to play the Scarlet Pimpernel…\n\nThus, Day 2 concluded; relaxation ensued, but ghosts and images of the past and present stayed very much in mind.\n\nThis piece is a fuller, more rambling expansion of the piece I have written here for Literary 007. I wasn’t quite sure they were so interested in the 1950s boffin, ‘Father Stanley Unwin’ and Glasgow locations standing in for Czechoslovakia (and there was a word limit)!\n\nOn a pleasant Friday morning (17/06/2016), the Spies on British Screens Conference commenced in a small lecture room, housed in a building that was less than ten years old. Most of Plymouth was suitably early Cold War in its look – plenty of concrete shopping precincts and 1950s-60s tower blocks.\n\nAlan Burton (Klagenfurt University) provided a chronological survey of the British spy film cycle, from 1964-73. He applied genre-theorist Steve Neale’s formulation of a film ‘cycle’ to a group of films made in a ‘specific and limited timespan’, in the wake of the success of From Russia with Love (1963). The focus was initially on the 1960s; Burton quoted Alexander Walker’s description of James Bond as ‘man of the decade’. He argued that the cycle’s high-water mark was in April 1965, when Films and Feelings magazine declared a state of ‘spy mania’: the year of the stratospheric box-office success of Thunderball and the anti-Bond complexities of The Spy Who Came in from the Cold and The Ipcress File.\n\nMany films in the cycle couldn’t escape the shadow of Bond: Where the Bullets Fly (1966) even promoted Tom Adams’ Charles Vine as the world’s ‘second best’ secret agent! Among the many obscure films in the cycle that Burton mentioned (and, for many, it sounded like this status was entirely deserved!), some particularly interesting ones were Where the Spies Are (1966) and Otley (1968), with Tom Courtenay as a small-time antiques dea"
