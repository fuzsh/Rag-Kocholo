I wanted to start a thread for this in case anyone missed my posts elsewhere, or had any questions.\n\nPlease check out the link below for all the info, and please please please help us out with this. It will be more than a shame should this show get canceled. I think we can all see its potential, especially after the finale.\n\nSo, come, take a look, send a watch and have some fun!\n\nwww.cbs.com/forum/posts/list/46315.page\n\nPost by luvinx on\n\nHi guys! With the announcements of cancellations/renewals closing in on us, I just wanted to remind everyone to come and check this out. We have attracted a lot of new fans to the show, and made it known to many others that this show was not necessarily going to be renewed - and they have all eagerly jumped in to help out with the campaign. Please come and help if you are not already. I really think it would be a HUGE shame to lose this show. And it is all very easy and quick things to do. So take a second and come help us out!\n\nwww.cbs.com/forum/posts/list/46315.page\n\nPost by rueful on\n\nThanks for the reminder luvinx. I went over and sent some more user feedback to cbs, and I will continue to do so.\n\nI was disappointed that this week the Hollywood Reporter said the prospects for EH \"do not look good\" partly because that kind of thing can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Every website that picked up the THR story then repeated that prediction. However, I have seen a couple of other sites that are more positive. Keeping my fingers crossed!\n\nPost by luvinx on\n\nThanks rueful! I really appreciate your help. It is very frustrating with all these articles. I have actually seen ones that say \"it is gone\" and then I go somewhere else and see \"it is a shoe-in for a renewal\" and I am\n\nBut it just makes me want to try that much harder. Especially since I think it is all just speculation, and CBS is still taking its sweet time making up its mind.\n\nPost by Famke on\n\nLuvinx,\n\nYour reminder also persuaded me to do my due diligence!\n\nI too sent a user feedback to CBS.\n\nArrrghhh... this month of waiting is killing me...when will we find out again? May 29th or so?\n\nPost by luvinx on\n\nThanks Famke! I was nervous to post a reminder, too, cause I was afraid you guys would be like \"shut up already!\".\n\nBut I just want to try and do everything we can, you know?\n\nCBS is supposed to announce its fall line-up on May 20th. Still, too long to wait.\n\nPost by peach on\n\nluvinx, hello again, we really need to get the word out, and have anyone who posts here to hop on over to CBS and innundate the powers that be. If anyone is ti post there, stress the fact that we shop, and shop their sponsors, mention that often, b/c we all know that networks rely on that, and w/o the viewership on Thursday, that may change. I too have read several conflicting stories concerning its fate. Zap2it, about two weeks ago said that it had the legs for a re-newal.\n\nPost by peach on\n\nhot off the presses, from Canada.com a little over five hours ago, let's hope those Canadiens are wrong,\n\nTV shows at their Eleventh Hour: series on the cusp of cancellation.\n\nBy Alex Strachan, Canwest News ServiceApril 22, 2009\n\nLife is dead or dying. The clock looks as if it has run out for Eleventh Hour. And the made-in-Vancouver Reaper may be about to meet its maker.\n\nThere will be more casualties than usual when the major broadcast networks unveil their plans for fall in the coming weeks.\n\nAn unusually high number of new, midseason dramas and comedies means there are more shows than usual hovering between renewal and cancellation.\n\nPost by luvinx on\n\nDon't worry too much, peach. I saw 3 other articles today that said it was probably coming back. So I just don't know. Like I said before, I think everyone just wants to say something, whether they know what is going on or not.\n\nHang in there!\n\nPost by luvinx on\n\nluvinx, did you see the response on the CBS board concerning your renewal campaign? Way to go, c'mon ladies keep it up.\n\nYes I surely did see!\n\nI PM'd him and he said that all our voices are definitely being heard! He was cryptic, otherwise, as I knew he would be. But we are at the very least getting noticed, and that is what we set out to do!\n\nSo, yes, come on guys....let's double up our efforts because now we know that they are definitely listening. We can make this happen.\n\nPost by luvinx on\n\nI know! Wasn't that great?\n\nAnd yes, a good omen. Or, at least, that is what I am taking away from it!"
