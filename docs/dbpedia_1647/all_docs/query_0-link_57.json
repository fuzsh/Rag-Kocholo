        "text": "Stacey Dooley: Stalkers\n\nType: Factual\n\nLength: 2 x 47 minutes\n\nProducer: ScreenDog Productions\n\nBroadcaster: BBC3 (UK)\n\nOrange Smarty’s relationship with Stacey Dooley spans more than 10 titles, but it had to move fast to secure the journalist and presenter’s latest investigative series for the BBC. Stalkers, produced by south coast indie ScreenDog Productions, was already a “hot property” before Orange Smarty boarded the series, according to founder and chief exec Karen Young.\n\nIn the two-parter, Dooley embeds herself with professionals – a Cheshire police unit specialising in stalking and a victim support organisation – to understand the criminal activity. She also spends time with the victims and perpetrators to uncover raw and stark details from those whose lives are consumed by stalking.\n\nEpisode one focuses on stalking by ex-partners, the most common type, with Dooley following stories involving victims and perpetrators. In episode two, Dooley covers stranger stalking, looking at how to stop stalking long term and exploring whether prison or therapy is the best method to prevent the crime.\n\nYoung says the doc goes beyond common perceptions of stalking, such as its association with celebrity. In talking to victims and culprits, the series informs viewers about the nuances of the crime, in particular the “type of people who become stalkers, and what led them to it”.\n\n“With all Stacey’s programmes, she presents a balanced view without making any statements at the end of it, leaving the viewer to go away and mull it over,” Young says.\n\nShe adds that the doc’s balanced viewpoints are driven by the access ScreenDog secured with both the police and victim support units, and Dooley’s talent in executing engaging and informative investigative docs.\n\nStalkers, which was watched by 1.4 million when it aired on BBC1 in January, has already pre-sold to SBS in Australia and public broadcasters in the Nordics and Belgium, with Young citing Smarty’s prior work with Dooley as reasons for its solid start on the international market.\n\n“We have a good knowledge of how Stacey’s programming sells, where it sells, and the value to broadcasters,” she says. “We’re bringing programming to market that fits broadcaster needs.”\n\nDooley’s presence is a selling point for “certain territories where her reputation is very strong”, such as Australia and the Nordics, but it is the universality of the subject matter that makes Stalkers something “most people can relate to in some way”, says Young. “There’s an intrigue. It resonates.”\n\nYoung believes the doc could sell as a standalone two-parter or form part of a “curated collection”.\n\n“We’d pitch it as a collective to buyers, promoting the idea of a whole Stacey season, with our previous titles,” she says. “Talent is a key driver at the moment and taking talent and pushing them into another vehicle, such as Stacey has done with Glow Up and Sleeps Over, is something we’re going to see more and more.\n\n“Online platforms are driven by talent, because it brings audience. The more you can utilise talent in different directions, the more opportunities you will create.”\n\nWonders Of The Celtic Deep\n\nType: Factual\n\nLength: 4 x 60 minutes\n\nProducer: One Tribe TV\n\nBroadcaster: BBC1 Wales (UK)\n\n‘It’s early stages, but we have a strategy in place: we’ll handle the SVoD, AVoD and Fast channels within that, but Mipcom is its moment to shine’\n\nFactual specialist Orange Smarty has long been associated with thought-provoking social-impact docs including Bring Back The Bush: Where Did Our Pubic Hair Go?, true-crime series such as The Moment Of Proof and fact-ent returners like A Place In The Sun, but it also has a healthy collection of natural history series.\n\nIn Wonders Of The Celtic Deep, the distributor has picked up a landmark doc for both itself and commissioner BBC Cymru Wales. Described as the broadcaster’s “most ambitious natural history series to date”, the programme is the first in Wales to be shot in 4K.\n\nThe series dives into the natural wonders of the Welsh seas, exploring birds that can ‘fly’ underwater and some of the largest and smallest creatures of the ocean. As it unfolds, audiences will embark on an exciting journey of discovery from the shores and estuaries of Wales, into the bays and shallow waters of the wildlife ‘golden zone’ and finally into the marine superhighway of the sea.\n\nOne Tribe executive producer Dale Templar was part of the team behind the BBC’s Bafta- and Emmy-winning natural history series Human Planet.\n\nOrange Smarty founder and chief executive Karen Young says the series resonated so much with her that the distributor fully deficit-financed the series. She says that the presence of\n\nOne Tribe, which has an existing relationship with the distributor, was also pivotal because natural history generally, and underwater natural history in particular, can be risky.\n\nYoung says there is a “market demand” for natural history, both for linear and VoD. SVoD and AVoD services are of specific interest because they are “not prescriptive in terms of genre” and want an “eclectic mix of content”.\n\n“What’s also interesting about this project is that it’s a four-parter,” she adds. “The first three episodes explore the coastline and the sea, and the fourth is about sustainability.”\n\nOrange Smarty has already fielded calls from buyers and Young expects broadcasters from France, Germany and the US to be interested. She adds that there is a bolt-on package for online platforms, which talks about the making of the film.\n\n“It’s early stages, but we have a strategy in place: we’ll handle the SVoD, AVoD and Fast channels within that, but Mipcom is its moment to shine,” she concludes.\n\n25 Siblings and Me\n\nType: Factual\n\nLength: 1 x 60-minutes/1 x 90-minutes\n\nProducer: Expectation Entertainment\n\nBroadcaster: BBC3/BBC2 (UK)\n\nExpectation’s one-off doc “felt right” for distributor Orange Smarty because it covered many different aspects of buyers’ current needs, but also “resonated” with the sales house, according to chief executive Karen Young.\n\nThe film, which aired at the back end of 2020 on BBC3 in the UK, tells the story of Oli, a 21-year-old man with Asperger’s, who was born to two mums and lives in London. Overnight, he discovers he has 25 siblings from the same American sperm donor dad. Desperate to be part of this new family, Oli travels to the USA, meeting his donor and joining a mass sibling reunion. 25 Siblings follows Oli as he struggles to navigate the fragile dynamics in this new type of family formation.\n\nAlthough ostensibly a youth-skewing show, Young says the film is tailor-made for “co-viewing”.\n\n“This fits into the category of a cross-generational piece of content,” she says. “People will view it in different ways It’s about ethics, disability, family, self-discovery. It’s about the ethics of sperm donation, but Oli also has Asperger’s, so it’s about unravelling his story. With Asperger’s relationships can be really tricky and now he has to navigate these various different relationships, as he goes on his journey to meet all his siblings.”\n\n25 Siblings has already sold to Denmark, Australia and Belgium, but a US buyer is likely given the setting for Oli’s journey. Young acknowledges that English-speaking territories and those where there is more awareness and understanding of Asperger’s will be more interested in the film.\n\nHowever, a key advantage for the doc is that “it doesn’t date”, which makes it a handy title for broadcasters still battling production uncertainties during the ongoing pandemic.\n\n“It’s something you can still repeat and that’s really important for channels,” Young adds. “As we see in our home territories, channels need to repeat product because they may not have the investment for new content or, when productions stop, they need product they can put out there. It’s important that content is repeatable and has a shelf-life.”\n\nThis is Our Family\n\nType: Factual\n\nLength: 4 x 60-minutes\n\nProducer: Little Gem Media\n\nBroadcaster: Sky Atlantic (UK)\n\nWhen Sky Vision was subsumed into NBC Universal Global Distribution last year, it was expected some producers would look to reclaim their content or risk it being lost in the US studio’s giant catalogue.\n\nLittle Gem took this approach with This is Our Family, a documentary series uniquely shot over a three-year period. NBCU decided to let the series go, allowing Orange Smarty to jump in and acquire international sales rights.\n\nOrange Smarty is now keenly pitching the title to broadcasters and channel groups with human interest and socially themed slots in their schedules.\n\nCentral to the sell is the drawn-out shoot of each of the intimate, hour-long films, resulting in ‘Boyhood meets Modern Family’-style stories of British families.\n\nThese include the Borgs, who prepare for a wedding while dealing with issues of bereavement and blended family dynamics; the Hoyles, whose daughter has a complex form of epilepsy; the Miles, whose extravert matriarch grandmother is living with dementia; and the Nailors, whose story involves the father, who has spent many years in jail for various crimes, attempting to help his son have an easier transition into manhood than his own.\n\n“Interestingly, this doesn’t have to sell as a series,” says Young. “Each story is an individual story so can sell film by film.”\n\nThis opens different episodes up to different channels – science-themed networks might consider the episodes with medical issues at their cores, for example.\n\n“This is a simple concept with sensitive execution and engaging characters,” Young adds. “It’s not sensationalist, but real television. Family is very interesting for a lot of people right now and the fact it was shot over three years is very unusual in this climate.”\n\nAs an English-language show, Karen Young expects it to “naturally skew” to territories such as the US, Australasia, Benelux, and Scandinavia and the wider Nordics.\n\nBespoke offer key to boosting factual productions\n\nBrighton-based Orange Smarty has established itself as one of the UK’s true boutique factual programming distributors since its launch in 2013. Founder Karen Young has worked in international programmes sales for 25 years, holding the experience necessary to run a TV sales house that focuses on providing producers with a service they can’t get from some of the bigger firms on the market.\n\nAccording to last year’s Broadcast Distributors Survey, the company turned over £3.68m in 2018-19 – its 22% year-on-year revenue growth making it one of the fastest-growing distributors on the market.\n\nPerhaps its most well-known title in 1,200-hour catalogue is Freeform Productions’ A Place in the Sun, but the company has also forged a reputation for selling factual programming from right across the genre’s gamut.\n\n“When I initially set up the company, I stuck with what I know – factual content – and we now push the message we are a factual specialist,” says Young. “With the way the market has evolved it’s important to push that we are specialists, not just factual distributors.”\n\nOrange Smarty tends to hire staff with significant market experience and every sales rep is expected to have watched at least some of every title in the catalogue – a key part of the bespoke service Young wants the company to provide.\n\nThis mitigates the natural scepticism she has observed many producers can feel towards distributors. “Distributors can look like hyenas but actually they work incredibly hard and have a huge amount of knowledge about the international market, while maintaining a huge number of relationships,” she says.\n\nProving this involves a personal service – meaning no late payments, giving clients full access to content plans around each show and ensuring producers don’t feel isolated from their programmes by providing regular updates and constant communication. “We are more collaborative than arm’s length,” says Young.\n\nWith the Covid-19 lockdown still upsetting the international distribution business, Young has doubled down on relationship building, helping producers build an international approach into their latest projects.\n\nWith Channel 4 no longer taking international revenues from their commissions and other broadcasters relaxing their back-end revenue demands to ensure better British VoD rights, Young says it is even more important than ever for producers to speak with distributors about how their shows can make money beyond the UK."
