        "text": "Hello, I am Dirk-Willem van Gulik, Chief Technical Architect here at the BBC. An important part of my job is to help the BBC use the right internet and web technologies - and help the industry and open standards bodies create the internet and web technologies which are right for the BBC.\n\nNow the BBC is a very special place to work. And one of the main things which makes it so special is \"Quality\". At the BBC it is a currency, it is a goal, it is a culture - and as an engineer, it is something you are tasked to deliver.\n\nOne of our roles in FM&T is to provide our creative colleagues with tools. The tools they need for broadcast and to create high quality video. This includes tools for \"non linear editing\" - taking short clips, cutting them to the right length, stringing them together, adding some voice overs and graphics - and then endlessly tuning the resulting video so that it tells a story perfectly.\n\nUsually we shoot hundreds of hours of video, import it onto an editing server, painstakingly tagging or \"logging\" the content on the way, and then edit each clip into something that makes sense. Because the original video files are so huge (especially in HD), we actually edit low resolution \"proxy\" versions of each file, and we store edit decisions using timecodes rather than actually mashing up the real video all the time. Then everything can be synced up and \"conformed\" using the original high-quality versions later on.\n\nThroughout all of this, timecodes play a major role. They are the key 'link' to get right. They ensure that recipes done on the proxy give identical (albeit at a higher resolution) results when repeated on the raw high resolution footage at the end. They ensure that the audio tracks are perfectly synchronized with the clips, that transitions start and end at exactly the right time (and there is not some extra black frame due to a rounding error). They are also important in the creative process - as they let us communicate. We can ask each other to look at a specific frame - or discuss whether we move a cut by a few frames to achieve a particular effect.\n\nIf this sounds a bit overly perfectionistic and artistic - then consider this - a cut every 3 seconds or so is quite normal. So if you are off by 1 frame either way - then we're already talking errors of over 2%! Even a very pragmatic engineer would have to agree that that matters!\n\nSo timecodes using exact frame references are important. Really important. And the dirty little secret is that the internet has none. NONE! None of today's open standard technologies, or even the dominant proprietary ones, do timecodes right. They are off by one; they round to the nearest half second, they jump to the nearest previous I-frame. Whatever. (In all fairness - there are highly specialist products one can buy and install, usually with special browser plugins, which are accurate, often provided they are used with specially prepared material and within a single LAN. But none of those are conductive to the 'internet' network effect by facilitating collaboration between creative people across organisational barriers.)\n\nSo at the BBC we've been struggling with this. Because creative people want to work together, over the internet, from where ever they are. From their iPad, from their laptop, from a PC in a internet cafe near Tahrir Square. Anywhere, any time. Regardless for what production house they work for (as we outsource a lot, i.e. commission at third parties) and with workflows which often span across many specialist companies. So right now - we cannot create BBC quality video using internet and web technology based tools.\n\nBecause the first thing a professional needs is a rock solid way to reference each and every individual frame accurately. So they can talk about it. For us - 'video on the web' is a bit as in James May's programme - today the internet feels like that plastic 1:1 model of a spitfire[9]. It looks like one - but it sure does not fly.\n\nNow over the past two months that landscape has started to radically change. A few of us[1] have been working with the various open standard and open source HTML5 communities. And as of this week, after 120 emails, the bleeding edge development versions of several HTML5 implementations (as used in Safari, Chrome, Mozilla and many others) are now fully frame accurate.\n\nFirst was WebKit (the basis for Safari, Chrome and several dozen other browsers), which as of revision r77919 has frame accurate playback!\n\nReally. Frame Accurate. Actually even more accurate than just a frame (which is important for audio). You can jump to any point in the video (i.e. 1 hour, 3 minutes, 6 seconds and 5 frames, or to frame 178127) - and it will be exactly at that frame. Not at the nearest i-frame, rounded down to the nearest second, or off by one. No it will be exactly at that very frame.\n\nSo today, the HTML5 community has opened a door for us. Which will allow creative people to collaborate and edit professional video on the web.\n\nDo know though that, while key, this is just a first step. There is a lot to still build, so we'll need many hyper creative companies and internet engineers working together to make this work. We need to create a new breed of web based production tools which can interact at the quality levels professionals and the BBC expect. And we still have issues around UMIDs (unique global references for video) to crack. And even some very basic things (like did you know that a pixel in the video world is actually rectangular, rather than square?!) will need to universally understood between the broadcasting and internet engineers. But boy, getting timecodes, that is a big step!\n\nAgain - a big thank you to the open source folks of WebKit and Mozilla. IE9 is not quite there - (progress is tracked at https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/details/636755) but Microsoft has let us know that we \"can expect the video-frame-accurate seeking be available when IE9 is final\"!\n\n[1] To give credit where credit is due: within the BBC, Raymond Le Gué (programme director at BBC) insisted on having frame accurate playback in the browser. Rob Coenen went on and beyond his call of duty to make this happen, filing bugs - patiently working with the wider developer community, explaining what SMPTE frame counts are, why film and television production cannot live without it, proving that it was not working in browsers and helping the developers to fix it. He got help from Bas Schouten (at Mozilla), Andy Armstrong and Dirk-Willem van Gulik (both at the BBC).\n\nBut most credit should go to the open standards and open source communities around Webkit, Chrome and Mozilla which made it happen: Andrew Scherkus and the Chromium team get credit for being the first to understand the significance. The actual fixes where ultimately created by Jer Noble, Eric Carlson (both at Apple) and Chrome developer Andrew Scherkus; while Matthew Gregan and Anthony Hughes did the job for Mozilla.\n\nDirk-Willem van Gulik is Chief Architect, BBC Future Media & Tecnology\n\nSMPTE timecode based and frame accurate metadata logging is now possible over the web with HTML5. The image above is a made up screen shot of what a prototype tool to do this might look like.\n\nToday we are launching a new feature in BBC iPlayer that helps you find programmes from other broadcasters and on demand content providers.\n\nThrough metadata-sharing partnerships, you can now find programmes from ITV, Channel 4, S4C, Five, SeeSaw.com and new partner MSN Video Player, directly from the BBC iPlayer website.\n\nEither by using the 'schedule widget' (see left), or the 'search' function (see below), you will be able to find other video on demand content, and link directly into the playback page of your chosen programme from one of our partners websites.\n\nTo do this, feeds are taken from our partners periodically that contain all their programme information, both scheduled and on demand to make the programmes findable through the BBC iPlayer interface.\n\nImage left shows a Five schedule displayed via BBC iPlayer 'schedule widget\n\nImage below shows Channel 4' \"Shameless\" displayed via BBC iPlayer search function\n\nWhen the content isn't available the programme title is greyed out and the words (not available) appear beneath the program information:\n\nIt's been a while in the making, but this has been an extremely ambitious and technically complicated project. We wanted to get to a user-experience that feels intuitive and not \"bolted on\", even though the experience is as much reliant on the data feeds from our partners as our own engineering.\n\nWe've worked hard with our partners to make sure that we're getting the right data and images for programmes when available, however you may find from time to time there's no images (see image below). We've also updated our FAQ section to include Partner Linking, click here for more information.\n\nThe occasional lack of images is down to technical limitations and we're working with all partners to rectify this as soon as we can. We really pleased to have six partners for launch but inclusion into this programme is not limited. Any provider of UK on demand content that holds rights to video that has previously been broadcast on an OFCOM regulated channel can apply to become a BBC iPlayer partner and have their content added, so we hope to see more partners programmes appear in BBC iPlayer over time.\n\nMore broadly, we think BBC Online should serve as a hub to support other UK sites and want to double the traffic we send externally. Already the BBC News product is one of the top 5 sites driving referrals to UK newspapers, adding value to the UK online economy and our audiences: this partnership is a good example of how the BBC iPlayer can follow in those footsteps.\n\nGiven the popularity of BBC iPlayer, we hope this feature will support fellow broadcasters and boost the overall uptake of video on demand.\n\nMost importantly, by helping audiences uncover great digital services that exist elsewhere on the web, we believe we're performing an important public service.\n\nAs always I'd welcome your feedback.\n\nPaul Clark is Head of Audience-Facing Services, Programmes and On Demand, BBC Future Media and Technology\n\nN.B. Clarification 3.50 p.m.: Channel 4 are currently not in the new BBC iPlayer schedule widget but will be soon (due to technical issues which are being addressed). However C4 are an On Demand Partner, and C4 programmes can be searched for in iPlayer. For example, here are search results for Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, and Hollyoaks.\n\nLast week BBC updated the terms governing how all BBC online services on bbc.co.uk can be used. BBC online services include the website at bbc.co.uk and any other services which allow users to access BBC content from our websites, such as BBC iPlayer, BBC Embedded Media Player, BBC Podcasts and BBC RSS Feeds.\n\nWe have also produced a set of Frequently Asked Questions to address the most common questions we receive about our online services.\n\nBBC online services enable users to access BBC content across many kinds of devices (for instance, TVs, PCs, games consoles and handheld/ mobile devices etc). The updated terms apply to all of these devices. As new technologies emerge additional terms can easily be added.\n\nIt's clear that personal and business users have different needs from the BBC online services. For instance, there are more restrictions on the commercial use of our content so we've decided to separate users into these two groups to help businesses understand what they can and can't do without confusing personal users. The new terms also help personal users understand their rights in using BBC online services, which are different to those of business users.\n\nThe BBC aims to be as open and transparent as it can, so we want the terms of use for bbc.co.uk to be clear and easily understandable. This is why the updated terms are drafted in plain English and try to explain in a straightforward way how the BBC's online services can be used.\n\nThe terms for all BBC online services now also follow a more consistent form. They are divided into general terms of use that apply to all services and 'additional terms' which apply to how specific services are used. They are available to users at the direct point of access to each BBC online service as well as from one central page on bbc.co.uk . This makes them easier for users to navigate and find.\n\nWe want to continue to improve the site, and in the future intend to create a separate page for 'Educational Users' to set how BBC online services can be used for educational purposes.\n\nThe new updated terms are available here. Terms and conditions are always \"work in progress\" and when they are further updated I will be blogging again to explain any changes.\n\nConor O'Flaherty is Senior Lawyer, Business Development, BBC Future Media & Technology\n\nThere's been a lively discussion on the issues around archiving websites this week that kicked off with an initial post from Adactio blogger Jeremy Keith. He suggested that the BBC's plans to halve its top level directories were cultural vandalism. This was picked up (though later clarified) by @bengoldacre and many others. The tenor of the criticism was the same - that the BBC is failing in its duty to preserve a record of its online past.\n\nOn Friday Metro reported on a 'BBC fan' who has captured for posterity a record of the 170 sites it's suggested we'll be deleting for efficiency reasons.\n\nAnd many have claimed this is only the latest failure, after the wiping (or worse) of programmes in the sixties which are seen as classics today. This is not, and never was, part of the plan.\n\nMy post last month explained that we were exploring a range of options for managing legacy content. \"Deleting the lot\" was not one of them, though offline storage is. The debate is quite complex. For example, one of our oldest sites www.bbc.co.uk/otr is still accessible but you could argue that it is a travesty of what its makers intended. Over time various features (for example, search) have ceased to function. You could argue that the BBC should spend money bringing this site up to date every time technology moves on, but would that be money well spent? The site still offers a number of transcripts of political interviews of the time and we may make it part of the news product. But there still may come a time when people interested in the site are better served by careful offline storage. We are also looking to apply this approach to www.bbc.co.uk/politics97.\n\nMany have argued that www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar should remain accessible to a wide audience. Again, this is an example of a site we are looking to consolidate into a bigger product - in this case the history section of knowledge and learning.\n\nSimilarly, assets from many of the 170 sites will be re-presented in forms which can be more easily kept up to date. For instance, www.bbc.co.uk/hamlet has been superseded by https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00pk71s and placed into a format which will allow the data and assets to be refreshed or editorially changed going forward. The same has been done with www.bbc.co.uk/annefrank.\n\nThis is similar to what a site like the Guardian does when it updates its look and feel. A story from 1999 is still viewable but much of its context has gone, at least in the form which is most accessible, online https://www.guardian.co.uk/news/1999/dec/03/guardianobituaries?INTCMP=SRCH\n\nThis means that if we wish to preserve a full record of what we have published, context as well as content, we need to explore a range of options including offline storage.\n\nTo restate our intentions: we are moving towards a rational content lifecycle for our websites as practiced by many other sites across the web. The aim is consistent high quality everywhere on the site. We have a number of stand-alone websites which will in due course become obsolete and need to be managed. Some will be consolidated into bigger, persistently managed, content offerings. Others will be moved offline to be preserved.\n\nAs our plan develops we'll keep you informed.\n\nIan Hunter is Managing Editor, BBC Online\n\nEditor's note: Some people seem to be experiencing difficulties commenting on this post. This is a technical problem or bug which is being investigated. Apologies and please bear with us. Update 1 p.m. - this bug has now been fixed and comments are now open again. Apologies.\n\nLast week, one section of the CBBC website was relaunched in a radically improved and more easily navigable format, so I'd like to explain what it is that we have done and how we got to where we are.\n\nThe first CBBC website\n\nThe first incarnation of the CBBC website appeared back in 1995: in this video you can see it being introduced by Toby Anstis. The world was a different place back then, and I should warn you that statistically 3.4 of you will actually die laughing while watching this, so please view with assistance nearby.\n\nI have scoured our archives and there is just no record of the page Toby introduces still in existence; but here I have found a version of the site from 1998:\n\nThere are a couple of nice touches here: in those days we used the Comic Sans font which is now prohibited in the contracts of our designers, and it also includes one of my favourite sentences on the entire internet which I have stolen for the title of this blog post:\n\nThere was also an animated version of the site, hence the reference to the 'Normal version', but the animated one apparently included 'a massive rocket'.\n\nThe digital hub of Children's lives\n\nThere are two recurring themes I will write about today, and if we move forward to 1999, you will see the first of them emerging:\n\nComic Sans has now been dropped, but you also see a great example of the phenomenal breadth of content that is the cornerstone of CBBC:\n\nThis juxtaposition is a particularly heroic one, but for me, the ability to cover many parts of life, introducing them to children in a way that is both engaging and not patronising is a core strength and indeed essence of CBBC, both on TV and online.\n\nWe see this again on the CBBC homepage on September 11, 2001.\n\nWe know from our statistics and search logs that children have a tremendous hunger to understand the world: on this day, the CBBC website rose to the challenge, telling people about the attacks on the World Trade Center and encouraging them to ask questions if they didn't understand what was happening.\n\nManaging increasing amounts of content\n\nLater in 2001 we see the first emergence of my second theme: the website struggling to cope with the sheer volume of this content:\n\nI have cut off the image for your sanity, but there were actually 17 items in the left hand menu, plus another 5 in the top menu. As humans can struggle to quickly process more than about 5 options, this website will certainly have been a struggle to get around for many children.\n\nThis continues in 2002. At this time, CBBC got its own TV channel, and content for younger children was spun off into another channel and website: CBeebies. So, there was now less to show, but how to show it all remained a problem:\n\nHere the navigation has moved into three dimensions: the TV shows are in a carousel on the right hand side (starting with Shoebox Zoo and Xchange); more generic content such as Search and Games is on the left hand menu, and there is also a top menu which I think was meant to house services, but with Star Chat appearing has also began to house content.\n\nIn 2005, for the first time, CBBC moved into a technical platform designed to manage content, which addressed some of these problems:\n\nHere again we have shows on the right of the page starting with Basil Brush, and generic content on the left starting with Art; but we also see some rather neat solutions to allow children to get to the content they want. Under each of the headings on the left are some linked examples of what the heading means - so you can go to the Cartoons index page via the heading, or go straight to content from Pitt and Kantrop or Likeaballs.\n\nThe content remains both varied and magical: as well as a cartoon about spies called The Secret Show, there is some content around 'Saving Planet Earth', again an area of huge concern for children. In the bottom row there are tips for staying safe on the internet, and also children's voices directly on the CBBC homepage in the 'Message Boards' section - albeit (ahem) with a bug on the example above so no messages are actually showing. It worked some a lot of the time.\n\nHowever, in 2007 the legacy content management system the CBBC website was being phased out and this website went back to being managed editorially. This was accompanied by a fantastic new design:\n\nAnd again, the content is strong: I can highly recommend the Championsheeps games. But the problems with holding the content began to re-emerge. The menu for shows is now on the second row starting with Deadly 60: 7 shows are visible at any one time, and to see different ones you click on the lever marked 'PULL' at the right.\n\nHowever, after the first set of 7 shows which are chosen by the CBBC team, it is actually randomised as to which ones appear: every user testing session we go on includes a hugely depressing 30 seconds or so while children pull the lever as many times as is necessary to see the logo of their favourite show.\n\nThe relaunched CBBC website: allowing the CBBC audience to find exactly what they want\n\nSo what we have we arrived at today? The CBBC homepage remains as above, but if you go into the section marked 'Things To Do' in the top menu you will move into a modern, database driven website.\n\nHere, instead of the CBBC team simply choosing what to highlight, children can also filter through the wealth of content to get precisely what they want: just things to do from Blue Peter, or just stuff to colour in, or anything to do around animals. So at last, CBBC's website is able to showcase its tremendous content in the best possible way.\n\nYou will notice that there is not a vast visual difference between this and the previous version of the site: this is both because Things To Do is side by side with sections still in the old system, and a reflection of the visual strength of the current design.\n\nHowever, over the coming weeks, you will see firstly that the other sections will be are moved into the new system and benefit from all the architectural advantages, and then, when the whole website is ready, we will tweak the design further. This will include replacing the 'Pull' lever navigation: no 'clippy' style wake is currently planned, but suggestions are welcome. The Games section is coming next, followed by Watch.\n\nI'll post again when the further sections are out, but please let us know what you think.\n\nI'd also like to thank the team for their tremendous efforts in delivering what I think is a fantastic website.\n\nPhil Buckley is Portfolio and Product Manager for BBC Children's and BBC Future Media & Technology"
