We work in various roles as firewall engineers, penetration testers, auditors, management, and the like. The common thread is risk: It is part of our job description. The Information Security Governance and Risk Management domain focuses on risk analysis and mitigation. It also details security governance, or the organizational structure required for a successful information security program. The difference between organizations that are successful and those that fail in this realm is usually not tied to dollars or staff size.: It is tied to the right people in the right roles. Knowledgeable and experienced information security staff and supportive and vested leadership are the keys to success. Speaking of leadership, learning to speak the language of leaders is another key to personal success in this industry. The ability to effectively communicate information security concepts with C-level executives is a rare and needed skill. This domain also helps you speak this language by discussing risk in terms such as Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Return on Investment (ROI).\n\nRisk analysis All information security professionals assess risk: We do it so often that it becomes second nature. A patch is released on a Tuesday. Your company normally tests for two weeks before installing, but a network-based worm is spreading on the Internet that infects unpatched systems. If you install the patch now, you risk downtime due to lack of testing. If you wait to test, you risk infection\n\nEleventh Hour CISSP® Study Guide. DOI: 10.1016/B978-1-59749-566-0.00001-1 © 2011 by Elsevier Inc.\n\n2\n\nEleventh Hour CISSP® Study Guide by the worm. What is the bigger risk? What should you do? Risk Analysis (RA) will help you decide. The average person does a poor job of accurately analyzing risk: If you fear the risk of dying while traveling and, to mitigate that risk, drive from New York to Florida instead of flying, you have done a poor job of analyzing risk. It is far riskier, per mile, to travel by car than by airplane when considering the risk of death while traveling. Accurate Risk Analysis is a critical skill for an information security professional. We must hold ourselves to a higher standard when judging risk. Our risk decisions dictate which safeguards we deploy to protect our assets, and the amount of money and resources we spend doing so. Poor decisions result in wasted money or, even worse, compromised data.\n\nAssets Assets are the valuable resources you are trying to protect. They can be data, systems, people, buildings, property, and so forth. The value or criticality of the asset dictates the safeguards you deploy. People are your most valuable asset.\n\nThreats and vulnerabilities A threat is a potentially harmful occurrence, such as an earthquake, a power outage, or a network-based worm like Conficker (aka Downadup or Kido; see www .microsoft.com/security/worms/Conficker.aspx), which began attacking Microsoft Windows operating systems in late 2008. A threat is a negative action that may harm a system. A vulnerability is a weakness that allows a threat to cause harm. Examples of vulnerabilities (matching our previous threats) are buildings that are not built to withstand earthquakes, a data center without proper backup power, or a Microsoft Windows XP system that has not been patched in a few years. Fast Facts Using the worm example, the threat is Conficker; it spreads through three vectors: 1. Lack of the MS08-067 patch (see www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS08 -067.mspx). 2. Infected USB tokens that “autorun” when inserted into a Windows system 3. Weak passwords on network shares.\n\nA networked Microsoft Windows system is vulnerable if it lacks the patch, if it automatically runs software on a USB token when inserted, or if it has a network share with a weak password. If any of those three conditions are true, you have risk. A Linux system has no vulnerability to Conficker and therefore runs no risk from it.\n\nDomain 1: Information Security Governance Chapter 1 Risk = Threat × Vulnerability To have risk, a threat must connect to a vulnerability. This relationship is stated by the formula: Risk = Threat × Vulnerability You can choose a value to specific risks using this formula. Assign a number to both threats and vulnerabilities. A common range is 1 through 5 (the range is arbitrary; just keep it consistent when comparing different risks).\n\nImpact The “Risk = Threat × Vulnerability” equation sometimes uses an added variable, impact: “Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact.” Impact is the severity of the damage, sometimes expressed in dollars, which is why Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Cost is sometimes used. A synonym for impact is consequences.\n\nExam Warning Loss of human life has a near-infinite significance on the exam. When calculating risk using the “Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact” formula, any risk involving loss of human life is extremely high and must be mitigated.\n\nRisk Analysis Matrix The Risk Analysis Matrix uses a quadrant to map the likelihood of a risk occurring against the consequences (or impact) that the risk would have. The Australia/New Zealand 4360 Standard on Risk Management (AS/NZS 4360, see www.stand­ards .org.au) describes the Risk Analysis Matrix, which is shown in Table 1.1. The Risk Analysis Matrix allows you to perform Qualitative Risk Analysis (see the section Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Analysis to come) based on likelihood (from rare to almost certain) and consequences, or impact, Table 1.1\n\nRisk Analysis Matrix\n\nLikelihood\n\nConsequences Insignificant 1\n\nMinor 2\n\nModerate 3\n\nMajor 4\n\nCatastrophic 5\n\n5.

Low risks are handled via normal processes; moderate risks require management notification; high risks require senior management notification; and extreme risks require immediate action, including a detailed mitigation plan (and senior management notification). The goal of the matrix is to identify high-likelihood/high-consequence risks (upper right quadrant of Table 1.1) and drive them down to the low-likelihood/ low-consequence level (lower left quadrant).\n\nCalculating Annualized Loss Expectancy The Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) calculation allows you to determine the annual cost of a loss due to a given risk. Once calculated, ALE allows you to make informed decisions to mitigate the risk. This section uses an example of risk due to lost or stolen unencrypted laptops. Assume that your company has 1000 laptops that contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII). You are the Security Officer, and your concern is the risk of exposure of PII due to the laptops’ misplacement or theft.. You want to purchase and deploy a laptop encryption solution. The solution is expensive, so you need to convince management that it is worthwhile.\n\nAsset Value The Asset Value (AV) is the value of the asset you are trying to protect. In this example, each laptop costs $2,500, but the real value is in the PII it contains. Theft of unencrypted PII occurred previously and cost the company many times the value of the laptops in regulatory fines, bad publicity, legal fees, staff hours spent investigating, and so forth. The true average Asset Value of a laptop with PII for this example is $25,000 ($2,500 for the hardware and $22,500 for the exposed PII). Exposure Factor The Exposure Factor (EF) is the percentage of value lost by an asset because of an incident. In the case of a stolen laptop with unencrypted PII, the Exposure Factor is 100%: The laptop and all the data are gone. Single Loss Expectancy The Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) is the cost of a single loss. SLE is the Asset Value (AV) times the Exposure Factor (EF). In our case, SLE is $25,000 (Asset Value) times 100% (Exposure Factor), or $25,000. Annual Rate of Occurrence The Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) is the number of losses you suffer per year. Looking through past events, you discover that you have suffered 11 lost or stolen laptops per year on average, so your ARO is 11.\n\nDomain 1: Information Security Governance Chapter 1\n\nTable 1.2\n\nSummary of Risk Equations\n\nAsset Value (AV) Exposure Factor (EF) Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)\n\nFormula\n\nDescription\n\nAV EF AV × EF ARO SLE × ARO\n\nValue of asset Percentage of asset value lost Cost of one loss Number of losses per year Cost of losses per year\n\nAnnualized Loss Expectancy The Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) is your yearly cost due to a risk. It is calculated by multiplying the Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) times the Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO). In our case it is $25,000 (SLE) times 11 (ARO), or $275,000. Table 1.2 summarizes the equations used to determine Annualized Loss Expectancy.\n\nTotal Cost of Ownership The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is the total cost of a mitigating safeguard. It combines upfront costs (often one-time capital expenses) and annual cost of maintenance, including staff hours, vendor maintenance fees, software subscriptions, and so forth. These ongoing costs are usually considered operational expenses. Using our laptop encryption example, the upfront cost of laptop encryption software is $100/laptop, or $100,000 for 1,000 laptops. The vendor charges a 10% annual support fee, or $10,000/year. You estimate that it will take 4 staff hours per laptop to install the software, or 4,000 staff hours in total. The staff that performs this work makes $50/hour plus benefits. Including benefits, the staff cost per hour is $70 times 4,000 hours, or $280,000. Your company uses a three-year technology refresh cycle, so you calculate the Total Cost of Ownership over three years: ■ ■ ■ ■ ■\n\nSoftware cost: $100,000 Three years of vendor support: $10,000 × 3 = $30,000 Hourly staff cost: $280,000 Total Cost of Ownership over three years: $410,000 Total Cost of Ownership per year: $410,000/3 = $136,667/year\n\nYour Annual Total Cost of Ownership for the laptop encryption project is $136,667 per year.\n\nReturn on Investment The Return on Investment (ROI) is the amount of money saved by implementing a safeguard.

If your TCO is higher than your ALE, you have made a poor choice. The annual TCO of laptop encryption is $136,667; the Annualized Loss Expectancy for lost or stolen unencrypted laptops is $275,000. The math is summarized in Table 1.3. Implementing laptop encryption will change the Exposure Factor. The laptop hardware is worth $2,500, and the exposed PII costs an additional $22,500, for a $25,000 Asset Value. If an unencrypted laptop is lost or stolen, the EF is 100% (the hardware and all data are exposed). Laptop encryption mitigates the PII exposure risk, lowering the exposure factor from 100% (the laptop and all data) to 10% (just the laptop hardware). The lower Exposure Factor lowers the Annualized Loss Expectancy from $275,000 to $27,500, as shown in Table 1.4. You will save $247,500/year (the old ALE, $275,000, minus the new ALE, $27,500) by making an investment of $136,667. Your ROI is $110,833 per year ($247,500 minus $136,667). The laptop encryption project has a positive ROI and is a wise investment.\n\nRisk choices Once we have assessed risk, we must decide what to do. Options include accepting the risk, mitigating or eliminating it, transferring it, and avoiding it.\n\nDomain 1: Information Security Governance Chapter 1 Accept the Risk Some risks may be accepted: In certain cases, it is cheaper to leave an asset unprotected from a specific risk rather than make the effort (and spend the money) required to protect it. This cannot be an ignorant decision: The risk, and all options, must be considered before you can accept it.\n\nRisk Acceptance Criteria Low-likelihood/low-consequence risks are candidates for risk acceptance. High and Extreme risks are not . There are cases, such as data protected by laws or regulations or risk to human life or safety, where accepting the risk is not an option.\n\nMitigate the Risk Mitigating the risk means lowering it to an acceptable level. The laptop encryption example given previously in the Annualized Loss Expectancy section is an example of risk mitigation. The risk of lost PII due to stolen laptops was mitigated by encrypting the data on them. It was not eliminated entirely: A weak or exposed encryption password could expose the PII, but the risk was reduced to an acceptable level. In some cases it is possible to remove the risk entirely: this is called eliminating it.\n\nTransfer the Risk Risk transfer is the “insurance model.” Most people do not assume the risk of fire to their house: They pay an insurance company to assume that risk for them. Avoid the Risk A thorough Risk Analysis should be completed before taking on a new project. If it discovers high or extreme risks that cannot be easily mitigated, avoiding the risk (and the project) may be the best option. The math for this decision is straightforward: Calculate the Annualized Loss Expectancy of the new project, and compare it with the Return on Investment expected from the project. If the ALE is higher than the ROI (even after risk mitigation), risk avoidance is the best course. There may also be legal or regulatory reasons that will dictate avoiding the risk.\n\nQualitative and Quantitative Risk Analysis Quantitative and Qualitative Risk Analysis are two methods for analyzing risk. Quantitative Risk Analysis uses hard metrics, such as dollars. Qualitative Risk Analysis uses simple approximate values. Quantitative is more objective; qualitative is more subjective.\n\nExam Warning Quantitative Risk Analysis requires you to calculate the quantity of the asset you are protecting. “Quantitative-quantity” is a hint to remember on the exam.\n\n7\n\n8\n\nEleventh Hour CISSP® Study Guide Calculating the Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) is an example of Quantitative Risk Analysis. The inputs for ALE are hard numbers: Asset Value (in dollars), Exposure Factor (as a percentage), and Annual Rate of Occurrence (as a hard number). The Risk Analysis Matrix (shown in Table 1.1) is an example of Qualitative Risk Analysis. Likelihood and Consequences are rough (and sometimes subjective) values, ranging from 1 to 5. Whether the consequences of a certain risk are a 4 or a 5 can be a matter of (subjective) debate. Quantitative Risk Analysis is more difficult: To quantitatively analyze the risk of damage to a data center due to an earthquake, you need to calculate the asset value of the data center, such as the cost of the building, servers, network equipment, computer racks, and monitors. Then you must calculate the Exposure Factor and so on. To qualitatively analyze the same risk, you research it and agree that the likelihood is a 2 and the consequences are a 4, and use the Risk Analysis Matrix to determine a risk of “high.”\n\nThe risk management process Published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Special Publication 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems (see: http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf), describes a ­nine-step Risk Analysis process: 1. System Characterization 2. Threat Identification 3. Vulnerability Identification 4. Control Analysis 5. Likelihood Determination 6. Impact Analysis 7. Risk Determination 8. Control Recommendations 9. Results Documentation1 We covered these steps individually; let’s end this section by following NIST’s process. Step 1, System Characterization, describes the scope of the risk management effort and the systems that will be analyzed. Threat Identification and Vulnerability Identification, Steps 2 and 3, identify the threats and vulnerabilities required to determine risks using the “Risk = Threat × Vulnerability” formula. Step 4, Control Analysis, analyzes the security controls (safeguards) in place or planned to mitigate risk. Steps 5 and 6, Likelihood Determination and Impact Analysis, identify important risks (especially those with high likelihood and high impact/consequence).\n\nDomain 1: Information Security Governance Chapter 1 Steps 1 through 7 are used to determine Control Recommendations, or the risk ­mitigation strategy. That strategy is documented in Step 8, Results Documentation.\n\nInformation security governance Information Security Governance is information security at the organizational level: senior management, policies, processes, and staffing. It is also the organizational priority, provided by senior leadership, that is required for a successful information security program.\n\nSecurity policy and related documents Documents such as policies and procedures are a required part of any successful information security program. These should be grounded in reality: They are not idealistic documents that sit on shelves collecting dust, but should mirror the real world and provide guidance on the correct (and sometimes required) way of doing things.\n\nPolicy Policies are high-level management directives. Policy is mandatory: If you do not agree with your company’s policy on sexual harassment, for example, you do not have the option of not following it.\n\nCrunch Time Policy is high level: It does not delve into specifics. A server security policy discusses protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system (usually in those terms). It may discuss software updates and patching. It\n\ndoes not use terms like “Linux” or “Windows”; these are too low level. In fact, if you converted your servers from Windows to Linux, your server policy would not change. Other documents, like procedures, would change.\n\nComponents of Program Policy All policy should contain these basic components: n n n n\n\nPurpose Scope Responsibilities Compliance Purpose describes the need for the policy, typically to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Scope describes the systems, people, facilities, and organizations that are covered by the policy. Any related entities that are not in scope should be documented to avoid confusion.\n\n9\n\n10\n\nEleventh Hour CISSP® Study Guide Responsibilities include those of the information security staff and policy and management teams, as well as those of all members of the organization. Compliance describes two related issues: how to judge the effectiveness of the policies (how well they are working), and what happens when a policy is violated (the sanction). All policy must have “teeth”: One that forbids accessing explicit content via the Internet is not useful if there are no consequences for doing so.\n\nPolicy Types The NIST Special Publication 800-12 (see http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/ 800-12/800-12-html/chapter5.html) discusses three specific policy types: program, issue-specific, and system-specific. Program policy establishes an organization’s information security program. Examples of issue-specific policies listed in NIST SP 800-12 include email and email privacy. System-specific policy examples include file servers and web servers.\n\nProcedures A procedure is a step-by-step guide for accomplishing a task. Procedures are low-level and specific. Like policies, they are mandatory. Here is a simple example of a procedure for creating a new user: 1. Receive a new-user request form and verify its completeness. 2. Verify that the user’s manager has signed the form. 3. Verify that the user has read and agreed to the user account security policy. 4. Classify the user’s role by following role-assignment procedure NX-103. 5. Verify that the user has selected a “secret word,” such” as mother’s maiden name, and enter it into the help desk account profile. 6. Create the account and assign the proper role. 7. Assign the secret word as the initial password, and set “Force user to change password on next login” to “True.” 8. Email the New-Account document to the user and his or her manager. The steps in this procedure are mandatory. Security administrators do not have the option of skipping Step 1, for example, and creating an account without a form.\n\nDid You Know? Other safeguards depend on the fact that procedures are mandatory: When a user calls the help desk because of a forgotten password, the help desk follows its “forgotten password” procedure, which includes asking for the user’s secret word. It cannot do that unless Step 5 was completed: Without that word, the help desk cannot securely reset the password. This mitigates social engineering attacks, in which an imposter tries to trick the help desk into resetting a password for an account he or she is not authorized to access.\n\nDomain 1: Information Security Governance Chapter 1 Standards A standard describes the specific use of technology, often applied to hardware and software. “All employees will receive an ACME Nexus-6 laptop with 2 gigabytes of memory, a 2.8-GHZ duo core CPU, and 300-gigabyte disk” is an example of a hardware standard. “The laptops will run Windows 7 Professional, 32-bit version” is an example of a software (operating system) standard. Standards are mandatory. They lower the Total Cost of Ownership of a safeguard. They also support disaster recovery, as recovering from disasters is easier when standards are employed.\n\nGuidelines Guidelines are recommendations (which are discretionary). They can include a useful piece of advice, such as “To create a strong password, take the first letter of every word in a sentence, and mix in some numbers and symbols. ‘I will pass the CISSP exam in 6 months!’ becomes ‘Iwptcei6m!’” You can create a strong password without following this advice, which is why guidelines are not mandatory. They are useful, especially for novice users.\n\nBaselines Baselines are uniform ways of implementing a safeguard. An example is “Harden the system by applying the Center for Internet Security Linux benchmarks” (see www.cisecurity.org for the CISecurity benchmarks; they are a great resource). The system must meet the baseline described by a benchmark. Baselines are discretionary. It is acceptable to harden the system without following the aforementioned benchmarks, as long as it is at least as secure as a system hardened using the benchmarks. Table 1.5 summarizes the types of security documentation.\n\nTable 1.5\n\nSummary of Security Documentation\n\nDocument\n\nExample\n\nMandatory or Discretionary?\n\nPolicy\n\nProtect the CIA of PII by hardening the operating system\n\nMandatory\n\nProcedure\n\nStep 1: Install prehardened OS Image.

Awareness changes user behavior; training provides a skill set. Reminding users to never share accounts or write their passwords down is an example of awareness. It is assumed that some users are doing the wrong thing, and awareness is designed to change that behavior. Security training teaches a user how to do something. Examples include training new help desk personnel to open, modify, and close service tickets; training network engineers to configure a router; and training a security administrator to create a new account.\n\nRoles and responsibilities Primary information security roles include Senior Management, Data Owner, Custodian, and User. Each plays a different role in securing an organization’s assets. Senior Management creates the information security program and ensures that it is properly staffed and funded, and has organizational priority. It is responsible for ensuring that all organizational assets are protected. The Data Owner (also called the Information Owner or the Business Owner) is a management employee responsible for ensuring that specific data is protected. Data Owners determine data sensitivity labels and how frequently data should be backed up. A company with multiple lines of business may have multiple Data Owners. The Data Owner performs management duties, whereas the hands-on protection of data is performed by Custodians. A Custodian provides hands-on protection of assets such as data. He or she performs data backups and restoration, patches systems, configures antivirus software, and so forth. Custodians follow detailed orders; they do not make critical decisions on how data is protected. The Data Owner may dictate that “All data must be backed up every 24 hours.” The Custodians (and their managers) then deploy and operate a backup solution that meets the Data Owner’s requirements. The User is the fourth primary information security role. Users must follow the rules: They must comply with mandatory policies, procedures, standards, and so forth. They must not write their passwords down or share accounts, for example. Users must be made aware of these risks and requirements. You cannot assume they will know what to do or that they are already doing the right thing: They must be told, via information security awareness.\n\nPrivacy Privacy is the protection of the confidentiality of personal information. Many organizations host personal information about their users: PII such as social security numbers, financial information (e.g., annual salary and bank account\n\nDomain 1: Information Security Governance Chapter 1 information required for payroll deposits), and healthcare information for insurance purposes. The confidentiality of this information must be assured.\n\nOutsourcing and offshoring Outsourcing is using a third party to provide Information Technology support services that were previously performed in-house. Offshoring is outsourcing to another country. Both can lower Total Cost of Ownership by providing IT services at lower cost. They may also enhance the information technology resources and skill set and resources available to a company (especially a small one), which can improve confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Offshoring can raise privacy and regulatory issues. For a U.S. company with data offshored to Australia, there is no Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the primary regulation covering healthcare data in the United States. Nor is there SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley), for example, which protects publicly traded data in the United States, or GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), which protects financial information in the United States), and so forth. A thorough and accurate Risk Analysis must be performed before outsourcing or offshoring sensitive data. If the data will reside in another country, you must ensure that laws and regulations governing it are followed, even beyond the country’s jurisdiction. This can be done contractually: The Australian outsourcing company can, for example, agree to follow HIPAA via contract.\n\nAuditing and control frameworks Auditing means verifying compliance to a security control framework (or published specification). It helps support Risk Analysis efforts by verifying that a company not only “talks the talk” (has documentation supporting a robust information security program) but also “walks the walk” (actually has a robust information security program in practice). A number of control frameworks are available to assist the auditing of Risk Analysis. Some, such as PCI (the Payment Card Industry), are industry-specific (vendors who use credit cards in the example). Others, such as OCTAVE, ISO 17799/27002, and COBIT, covered next, are more general.\n\nOCTAVE OCTAVE is the Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation, a risk management framework from Carnegie Mellon University. It describes a three-phase process for managing risk. Phase 1 identifies staff knowledge, assets, and threats. Phase 2 identifies vulnerabilities and evaluates safeguards. Phase 3 conducts the Risk Analysis and develops the risk mitigation strategy. OCTAVE is a high-quality free resource that may be downloaded from www.cert .org/octave/.\n\n13\n\n14\n\nEleventh Hour CISSP® Study Guide ISO 17799 and the ISO 27000 Series ISO 17799 was a broad-based approach for the information security code of practice of the International Organization for Standardization (based in Geneva, Switzerland). The full title is “ISO/IEC 17799:2005 Information Technology: Security Techniques—Code of Practice for Information Security Management.” “ISO 17799:2005” signifies the 2005 version of the standard. It was based on BS (British Standard) 7799 part one.\n\nFast Facts ISO 17799 had 11 areas, focusing on specific information security controls: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11.\n\nPolicy Organization of information security Asset management Human resources security Physical and environmental security Communications and operations management Access control Information systems acquisition, development, and maintenance Information security incident management Business continuity management Compliance2\n\nISO 17799 was renumbered as ISO 27002 in 2005 to make it consistent with the 27000 series of ISO security standards. ISO 27001 is a related standard, formally called ISO/IEC 27001:2005 Information technology: Security techniques– Information Security Management Systems–Requirements. It was based on BS 7799 part two. Note that the title of ISO 27002 includes the word “Techniques”; ISO 27001 includes the word “Requirements.” Simply put, ISO 27002 describes information security best practices (techniques), and ISO 27001 describes a process for auditing those best practices (requirements).\n\nCOBIT COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology) is a control framework for employing information security governance best practices within an organization. COBIT’s purpose is to provide management and business process owners with an information technology (IT) governance model that helps in delivering value from IT and understanding and managing the risks associated with IT. COBIT helps bridge the gaps amongst business requirements, control needs and technical issues. It is a control model to meet the needs of IT governance and ensure the integrity of information and information systems.3\n\nDomain 1: Information Security Governance Chapter 1 COBIT has 34 IT processes. More information about it is available at www.isaca .org/cobit/. COBIT was developed by ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association; see www.isaca.org). Version 4.1 was released in 2007.\n\nITIL ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a framework for providing best services in IT Service Management (ITSM). More information about it is available at www.itil-officialsite.com. ITIL contains five “Service Management Practices–Core Guidance” publications: n n n n n\n\nService strategy Service design Service transition Service operation Continual service improvement\n\nService Strategy helps IT provide services. Service Design details the infrastructure and architecture required to deliver IT services. Service Transition describes taking new projects and making them operational. Service Operation covers IT operations controls. Finally, Continual Service Improvement describes ways to improve existing IT services.\n\nCertification and accreditation Certification is a detailed inspection that verifies whether a system meets the documented security requirements. Accreditation is the Data Owner’s acceptance of the risk represented by a system. This process is called Certification and Accreditation, or C&A. The NIST Special Publication 800-37, “Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems” (see http://csrc.nist.gov/­publications /nistpubs/800-37-rev1/sp800-37-rev1-final.pdf), describes U.S. federal certification and accreditation. According to NIST, Security certification is a comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and technical security controls in an information system, made in support of security accreditation, to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. Also, Security accreditation is the official management decision given by a senior agency official to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls.4\n\n15\n\n16\n\nEleventh Hour CISSP® Study Guide Certification may be performed by a trusted third party such as an auditor. Certifiers investigate a system, inspect documentation, and may observe operations. They audit the system to ensure compliance. Certification is only a recommendation: The certifier does not have the ability to approve a system or an environment. Only the Data Owner (the Accreditor) can do so. NIST SP 800-37 describes a four-step Certification and Accreditation process: n n n n\n\nInitiation Phase Security Certification Phase Security Accreditation Phase Continuous Monitoring Phase\n\nThe information security system and risk mitigation plan is researched during the initiation phase. The security of the system is assessed and documented during the security certification phase. The decision to accept the risk represented by the system is made and documented during the security accreditation phase. Finally, once accredited, the ongoing security of the system is verified during the continuous monitoring phase.\n\nSummary of exam objectives Information security governance ensures that an organization has the correct information structure, leadership, and guidance. Risk Analysis (RA) helps ensure that an organization properly identifies, analyzes, and mitigates risk. All three of these qualities—information security governance, ethics, and Risk Analysis—are crucial for the success of an organization. Finally, accurately assessing risk and understanding terms such as Annualized Loss Expectancy, Total Cost of Ownership, and Return on Investment will not only help you on the exam but also help advance your information security career.\n\nTop five toughest questions 1.

Access control is achieved by implementing strong technical, physical, and administrative measures.\n\nCornerstone access control concepts Understanding cornerstone access control concepts, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability (as well as their mirror opposites: disclosure, alteration, and destruction), and subjects and objects, is a critical foundation for understanding access control.\n\nConfidentiality, integrity, and availability Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are the “CIA triad,” the cornerstone concept of information security. The triad, shown in Figure 2.1, forms the threelegged stool that information security is built on.\n\nConfidentiality Confidentiality seeks to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information. In other words, it seeks to prevent unauthorized read access to data. An example of a confidentiality attack would be the theft of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as credit card data.

Systems need to be usable (available) for normal business use. An example of an attack on availability would be Denial of Service (DoS), which seeks to deny system service (or availability).\n\nCrunch Time There are two types of integrity: data and system. Data integrity seeks to protect information against unauthorized modification; system ­integrity seeks to\n\nprotect a system, such as a Windows 2008 server operating system, from unauthorized modification.\n\nDisclosure, Alteration, and Destruction The CIA triad may also be described by its opposite: Disclosure, Alteration, and Destruction (DAD). Disclosure is the unauthorized disclosure of information; alteration is the unauthorized modification of data; destruction is making systems unavailable. While the CIA acronym sometimes changes, the DAD acronym is shown in that order.\n\nIdentity and authentication, authorization, and accountability The term “AAA” is often used to describe the cornerstone concepts Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability. Left out of the AAA acronym is Identification, which is required before the three As can follow.\n\nIdentity and Authentication Identity is a claim: If your name is Person X, you identify yourself by saying “I am Person X.” Identity alone is weak because there is no proof. You can also identify yourself by saying “I am Person Y.” Proving an identity claim is called authentication: You authenticate the identity claim, usually by supplying a piece of information or an object that only you possess, such as a password or your passport. Authorization Authorization describes the actions you can perform on a system once you have been identified and authenticated. Actions may include reading, writing, and executing files or programs.\n\nDomain 2: Access Control Chapter 2 Accountability Accountability holds users accountable for their actions. This is typically done by logging and analyzing audit data. Enforcing accountability helps keep “honest people honest.” For some users, knowing that data is logged is not enough to provide accountability: They must know that the data is logged and audited, and that sanctions may result from violation of policy.\n\nNonrepudiation Nonrepudiation means that a user cannot deny (repudiate) having performed a transaction. It combines authentication and integrity: Nonrepudiation authenticates the identity of a user who performs a transaction, and ensures the integrity of that transaction. You must have both authentication and integrity to have nonrepudiation: Proving you signed a contract to buy a car (authenticating your identity as the purchaser) is not useful if the car dealer can change the price from $20,000 to $40,000 (violating the integrity of the contract).\n\nLeast privilege and need to know Least privilege means that users should be granted the minimum amount of access (authorization) required to do their jobs, and no more. Need to know is more granular than least privilege: The user must need to know that specific piece of information before accessing it.\n\nDefense in depth Defense in Depth (also called layered defenses) applies multiple safeguards (also called controls—that is, measures taken to reduce risk) to protect an asset. Any one security control may fail; by deploying multiple controls, you improve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data.\n\nSubjects and objects A subject is an active entity on a data system. Most examples involve people accessing data files. However, running computer programs are subjects as well. A Dynamic Link Library file or a Perl script that updates database files with new information is also a subject. An object is any passive data within the system. Objects can range from databases to text files. The important thing to remember about objects is that they are passive within the system. They do not manipulate other objects.\n\nAccess control models Now that we have reviewed the cornerstone access control concepts, we can discuss the different access control models: The primary models are Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Mandatory Access Control (MAC), and Nondiscretionary Access Control.\n\n21\n\n22\n\nEleventh Hour CISSP® Study Guide Discretionary access control Discretionary Access Control gives subjects full control of objects they have or have been given access to, including sharing the objects with other subjects. Subjects are empowered and control their data. Standard UNIX and Windows operating systems use DAC for filesystems: Subjects can grant other subjects access to their files, change their attributes, alter them, or delete them.\n\nMandatory access control Mandatory Access Control is system-enforced, based on a subject’s clearance and an object’s labels. Subjects and objects have clearances and labels, respectively, such as confidential, secret, and top secret. A subject may access an object only if its clearance is equal to or greater than the object’s label. Subjects cannot share objects with other subjects who lack the proper clearance, or “write down” objects to a lower classification level (e.g., from top secret to secret). MAC systems are usually focused on preserving the confidentiality of data.\n\nNondiscretionary access control Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) defines how information is accessed on a system based on the role of the subject. A role can be a nurse, a backup administrator, a help desk technician, and the like. Subjects are grouped into roles, and each defined role has access permissions based on it, not on the individual. RBAC is a type of nondiscretionary access control because users do not have discretion regarding the groups of objects they are allowed to access, and they are unable to transfer objects to other subjects. Task-based access control is another nondiscretionary access control model related to RBAC. It is based on the tasks each subject must perform, such as writing prescriptions, restoring data from a backup tape, or opening a help desk ticket.\n\nCentralized access control Centralized access control is concentrated at one logical point for a system or organization. Instead of using local access control databases, systems authenticate via third-party authentication servers. Centralized access control can be used to provide Single Sign-On (SSO), where a subject may authenticate once and then access multiple systems.\n\nDecentralized access control Decentralized access control allows the IT administration to be closer to the mission and operations of the organization. With it, an organization spans multiple locations, and the local sites support and maintain independent systems, access control databases, and data. Decentralized access control is also called distributed access control.\n\nDomain 2: Access Control Chapter 2 Access control protocols and frameworks Both centralized and decentralized models may support remote users authenticating to local systems. A number of protocols and frameworks may be used to support this need, including RADIUS, Diameter, TACACS/TACACS+, PAP, and CHAP.\n\nRADIUS The Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) protocol is a thirdparty authentication system. It is described in RFCs 2865 and 2866, and uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP) ports 1812 (authentication) and 1813 (accounting). RADIUS formerly used the (unofficially assigned) ports 1645 and 1646 for the same respective purposes; some continue to use them. RADIUS is considered an “AAA” system, comprising three components: authentication, authorization, and accounting. It authenticates a subject’s credentials against an authentication database. It authorizes users by allowing specific users access to specific data objects. It accounts for each data session by creating a log entry for each RADIUS connection made. RADIUS request and response data is carried in Attribute Value Pairs (AVPs).\n\nDiameter Diameter is RADIUS’s successor, designed to provide an improved Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) framework. RADIUS provides limited accountability and has problems with flexibility, scalability, reliability, and security. Diameter also uses Attribute Value Pairs, but supports many more: While RADIUS uses 8 bits for the AVP field (allowing 256 total possible AVPs), Diameter uses 32 bits for the AVP field (allowing billions of potential AVPs). This makes Diameter more flexible, allowing support for mobile remote users, for example. TACACS and TACACS+ The Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS) is a centralized access control system that requires users to send an ID and a static (reusable) password for authentication. TACACS uses UDP port 49 (and may also use TCP). Reusable passwords are a security vulnerability: The improved TACACS+ provides better password protection by allowing two-factor strong authentication. TACACS+ is not backward compatible with TACACS. It uses TCP port 49 for authentication with the TACACS+ server.\n\nPAP and CHAP The Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) is defined by RFC 1334 (http:// tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1334#section-2) and is referred to as “not a strong authentication method.”1 A user enters a password, which is sent across the network in clear text. Sniffing the network may disclose plaintext passwords.\n\n23\n\n24\n\nEleventh Hour CISSP® Study Guide The Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP), defined by RFC 1994 (www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1994.html), provides protection against playback attacks.2 It uses a central location that challenges remote users. As stated in the RFC, CHAP depends upon a “secret” known only to the authenticator and the peer. The secret is not sent over the link. Although the authentication is only one-way, by negotiating CHAP in both directions the same secret set may easily be used for mutual authentication.3\n\nProcedural issues for access control The day-to-day management of access control requires management of labels, clearances, formal access approval, and need to know. These formal mechanisms are typically used to protect highly sensitive data, such as for the government or the military.\n\nLabels Objects have labels, and as we will see in the next section, subjects have clearances. The object labels used by many world governments are confidential, secret, and top secret. Additional labels exist, such as unclassified (data that is not sensitive), SBU (sensitive but unclassified) and for official use only (FOUO). SBU describes sensitive data that is not a matter of national security, such as the healthcare records of military enlisted personnel. This data must be protected, even though its release would not normally cause national security issues. Private-sector companies use labels such as “Internal Use Only” and “Company Proprietary.”\n\nClearance A clearance is a determination, typically made by a senior security professional, of whether or not a user can be trusted with a specific level of information. Clearances must determine the subject’s current and potential future trustworthiness—the latter is harder (and more expensive) to assess.\n\nRule-based access controls Rule-based access control (RBAC) uses a series of defined rules, restrictions, and filters for accessing objects within a system. The rules are in the form of “if/ then” statements. An example of a rule-based access control device is a proxy firewall that only allows users to web-surf to predefined approved content (e.g., “If the user is authorized to surf the Web, and the site is on the approved list, then allow access”).\n\nDomain 2: Access Control Chapter 2 Access control lists Access control lists (ACLs) are used in many IT security policies, procedures, and technologies. they contain objects, and each entry describes the subjects that may access that object. Any attempt by a subject to access an object that does not have a matching entry in the ACL will be denied.\n\nAccess control defensive categories and types In order to understand and appropriately implement access controls, understanding the benefits that each control can add to security is vital. There are six access control types: n n n n n n\n\nPreventive Detective Corrective Recovery Deterrent Compensating Fast Facts Access control types can fall into one of three categories: administrative, technical, or physical. Administrative (also called directive) controls are implemented by creating and following organizational policy, procedure, or regulation. User training and awareness fall into this category. n Technical controls are implemented using software, hardware, or firmware that restricts logical access in an information technology system. Examples are firewalls, routers, encryption, and the like. n Physical controls are implemented with physical devices, such as locks, fences, gates, and security guards. n\n\nPreventive Preventive controls prevent actions. They apply restrictions to what a potential user, either authorized or unauthorized, can do. An example of an administrative preventive control is pre-employment drug screening, which is designed to prevent an organization from hiring an employee who is using illegal drugs.\n\nDetective Detective controls are controls that send alerts during or after an attack. Intrusion detection systems alerting after an attack, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras alerting guards to an intruder, and a building alarm system that is triggered by an intruder are all examples of detective controls.\n\n25\n\n26\n\nEleventh Hour CISSP® Study Guide Corrective Corrective controls “correct” a damaged system or process. They typically work hand in hand with detective controls. Antivirus software has both components. First, it runs a scan and uses its definition file to detect if there is any software that matches its virus list. If it detects a virus, the corrective controls take over, placing the suspicious software in quarantine or deleting it from the system.\n\nRecovery After a security incident has occurred, recovery controls may be needed to restore functionality to the system and the organization. Recovery means that the system must be recovered: reinstalled from OS media or images, data restored from backups, and so forth.\n\nDeterrent Deterrent controls deter users from performing actions on a system. Examples include a “beware of dog” sign: A thief facing two buildings, one with guard dogs and one without, is more likely to attack the building without.\n\nCompensating A compensating control is an additional security control put in place to compensate for weaknesses in others.\n\nAuthentication methods A key concept for implementing any type of access control is controlling the proper authentication of subjects within the IT system.\n\nDid You Know? There are three basic authentication methods: Type 1 (something you know), Type 2 (something you have), and Type 3 (something you are). A fourth type of authentication is some place you are.\n\nType 1 Authentication: Something you know Type 1 Authentication (something you know) requires testing the subject with some sort of challenge and response where the subject must respond with a knowledgeable answer. The subject is granted access based on something he or she knows, like a password or PIN (Personal Identification Number). This is the easiest, and often weakest, form of authentication.\n\nDomain 2: Access Control Chapter 2 Passwords Passwords have been the cornerstone of access control in IT systems. They are relatively easy and cheap to implement. There are four types of passwords to consider when implementing access controls: static, passphrases, one-time, and dynamic. Static passwords are reusable and may or may not expire. They are typically user generated and work best when combined with another authentication type, like a smart card or biometric control. n Passphrases are long static passwords comprising words in a phrase or sentence. An example of a passphrase is “I will pass the CISSP in 6 months!” Passphrases may be made stronger by using nonsense words (replacing “CISSP” with “XYZZY,” for example), mixing case, and using additional numbers and symbols. n One-time passwords may be used for a single authentication. They are very secure but difficult to manage. A one-time password is impossible to reuse and is valid for a one-time use only. n Dynamic passwords change at regular intervals. RSA Security makes a synchronous token device called SecurID that generates a new token code every 60 seconds. The user combines his or her static PIN with the RSA dynamic token code to create one dynamic password that changes every time it is used. One drawback of dynamic passwords is the expense of the tokens themselves. n\n\nStrong authentication (also called multi-factor authentication) requires that the user present more than one authentication factor. For example, a user must insert an ATM card in order to withdraw money out of the bank but must also input the correct PIN.\n\nType 2 Authentication: Something you have Type 2 authentication (something you have) requires that users possess something, such as a token, that proves they are authenticated. A token is a physical object that helps prove an identity claim.\n\nSynchronous Dynamic Token Synchronous Dynamic Tokens use time or counters to synchronize a displayed token code with the code expected by the authentication server: The codes are synchronized. Time-based synchronous dynamic tokens display dynamic token codes that change frequently, such as every 60 seconds. The dynamic code is only good during that window. The authentication server knows the serial number of each authorized token, the user it is associated with, and the time. It can predict the dynamic code on each token using these three pieces of information. Counter-based synchronous dynamic tokens use a simple counter: The authentication server expects token code 1, and the user’s token displays it. Once that code is used, the token displays the second code, so the server also expects token 2.\n\n27\n\n28\n\nEleventh Hour CISSP® Study Guide Asynchronous Dynamic Token Asynchronous Dynamic Tokens are not synchronized with a central server. Their most common variety is challenge-response. Challenge-response token authentication systems produce a challenge, or input for the token device. The user then manually enters the information into the device along with her PIN, and the device produces an output. This output is sent to the system.\n\nType 3 Authentication: Something you are Type 3 authentication (something you are) is biometrics, which uses physical characteristics as a means of identification or authentication. Biometrics can establish an identity or authenticate (prove an identity claim). For example: An airport facial recognition system can establish the identity of a known terrorist, and a fingerprint scanner can authenticate the identity of a subject (who makes the identity claim and then swipes his finger to prove it).\n\nBiometric Enrollment and Throughput Enrollment is the process of creating an account for the first time with a biometric system. Users typically provide their username (identity), a password or PIN, and provide biometric information such as by swiping their fingerprints on a fingerprint reader or having a photograph taken of their irises. Enrollment is a one-time process that should take two minutes or less. Throughput is the process of authenticating to a biometric system. This is also called the biometric system response time. A typical throughput is six to ten seconds.\n\nAccuracy of Biometric Systems The accuracy of biometric systems should be considered before implementing a biometric control program. Three metrics are used to judge biometric accuracy: False Reject Rate (FRR), False Accept Rate (FAR), and Crossover Error Rate (CER).\n\nFalse Reject Rate A false rejection occurs when an authorized subject is rejected by the biometric system as unauthorized. A false rejection is also called a Type I error. False rejections cause frustration in authorized users, reduction in work due to poor access conditions, and expenditure of resources to revalidate authorized users.\n\nFalse Accept Rate A false acceptance occurs when an unauthorized subject is accepted as valid. If an organization’s biometric control is producing many false rejections, the overall control might have to lower the accuracy of the system by lessening the amount of data it collects when authenticating subjects. When the data points are lowered, the organization risks an increase in false acceptance rates, thus risking an unauthorized user gaining access. This type of error is also called a Type II error.\n\nDomain 2: Access Control Chapter 2 Crossover Error Rate The crossover error rate describes the point where the False Reject Rate and False Accept Rate are equal. The CER is also known as the Equal Error Rate (EER). It describes the overall accuracy of a biometric system. FAR\n\nFRR\n\nErrors\n\nAs the accuracy of a biometric system increases, FARs rise and FRRs drop. Conversely, as the accuracy decreases, FARs drop and FRRs rise. Figure 2.2 shows a graph depicting the FAR versus the FRR. The CER is the intersection of both lines of the graph, based on the 2007 IS Auditing Guideline: G36 Biometric Controls.4\n\nCER\n\nTypes of Biometric Control A number of biometric controls are used today. The following subsections describe the major implementations and their specific pros and cons with regard to access control security.\n\nFingerprints\n\nSensitivity\n\nFigure 2.2 Crossover error rate.\n\nFingerprints are the most widely used biometric Source: ISACA IS Auditing Guideline: G36 Biometric Controls. URL: www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Standards/Pages/IS-Auditingcontrol now available. The data used for storing Guideline-G36-Biometric-Controls.aspx (accessed July 21, 2010). each person’s fingerprint must be small enough to be used for authentication. This data is a mathematical representation of fingerprint minutiae— that is, specific details of fingerprint friction ridges such as whorls and bifurcation. Figure 2.3 shows minutiae types (from left): bifurcation, ridge ending, core, and delta.5\n\nRetina scan A retina scan is a laser scan of the capillaries that feed the retina at the back of the eye. This can seem personally intrusive because the light beam must directly enter the pupil, and the user usually needs to press her eye up to an eye cup so that the scan can map the blood vessels of the retina. Information about the user’s health can be gained through a retina scan: Conditions such as pregnancy and diabetes can be determined, which may raise legitimate privacy issues.\n\nIris scan An iris scan is a passive biometric control. A camera takes a picture of the iris (the colored portion of the eye) and then compares it to photos within the authentication database. This also works via contact lenses and glasses.\n\nFigure 2.3 Fingerprint minutiae. Source: NIST Tech Beat, March 16, 2006. URL: www.nist .gov/public_affairs/techbeat/tb2006_0316.htm (accessed July 21, 2010).\n\n29\n\n30\n\nEleventh Hour CISSP® Study Guide\n\nExam Warning Retina scans are rarely used because of health risks and privacy issues. Alternatives should be considered for any biometric controls that risk exchange of bodily fluid or that raise legitimate privacy concerns.\n\nEach person’s two irises are unique, as are twins’ irises. The benefits of iris scans include high accuracy, passive scanning (which may be accomplished without the subject’s knowledge), and no exchange of bodily fluids.\n\nHand geometry In hand geometry biometric control, measurements are taken from specific points on the subject’s hand: “The devices use a simple concept of measuring and recording the length, width, thickness, and surface area of an individual’s hand while guided on a plate.”6 Hand geometry devices are fairly simple and can store information in as little as nine bytes.\n\nKeyboard dynamics Keyboard dynamics measure how hard a person presses each key and the rhythm with which the keys are pressed. As people learn how to type and use a computer keyboard, they develop specific habits that are difficult to impersonate, although not impossible.\n\nDynamic signature Dynamic signatures measure the process by which someone signs his name. They are similar to keyboard dynamics, except that the method involved measures the handwriting of the subject while he signs his name.\n\nVoice print A voice print measures the subject’s tone of voice while speaking a specific sentence or phrase. This type of access control is vulnerable to replay attacks (replaying a recorded voice), so other access controls must be implemented along with it. One such control requires subjects to say random words, protecting against an attacker playing prerecorded specific phrases. Another issue is that voices may substantially change because of illness, resulting in a false rejection.\n\nFacial scan Facial scan technology has greatly improved over the last few years. Also called facial recognition, it is the process of passively taking a picture of a subject’s face and comparing that picture to a list stored in a database.\n\nDomain 2: Access Control Chapter 2 Someplace you are Someplace you are describes location-based access control using technologies such as the global positioning system (GPS), IP address−based geo-location, or the physical location for a point-of-sale purchase. These controls can deny access if the subject is not in the right place.\n\nAccess control technologies Several technologies are used for the implementation of access controls. As each technology is presented, it is important to identify what is unique about it.\n\nSingle Sign-On In Single Sign-On (SSO), multiple systems use a central authentication server (AS). This allows users to authenticate once and then access multiple different systems. It also allows security administrators to add, change, or revoke user privileges on one central system. The primary disadvantage of SSO is that it may allow an attacker to gain access to multiple resources after compromising one authentication method such as a password.\n\nKerberos Kerberos is a third-party authentication service that supports Single Sign-On (www.kerberos.org/) Kerberos (or Cerberus) was the name of the three-headed dog that guarded the entrance to Hades in Greek mythology.\n\nKerberos Characteristics Kerberos uses secret key encryption and provides mutual authentication of both clients and servers. It protects against network sniffing and replay attacks. The current version of Kerberos is version 5, described by RFC 4120 (www.ietf .org/rfc/rfc4120.txt). Fast Facts Kerberos has the following components: n n n n n n n n\n\nPrincipal: client (user) or service Realm: logical Kerberos network Ticket: data that authenticates a principal’s identity Credentials: a ticket and a service key KDC: Key Distribution Center, which authenticates principals TGS: Ticket Granting Service TGT: Ticket Granting Ticket C/S: Client/Server, regarding communications between the two\n\n31\n\n32\n\nEleventh Hour CISSP® Study Guide Kerberos Operational Steps A Kerberos principal, a client run by user Alice, wishes to access a printer. Alice may print after taking these five (simplified) steps: 1. Kerberos Principal Alice contacts the KDC (Key Distribution Center, which acts as an authentication server), requesting authentication. 2. The KDC sends Alice a session key, encrypted with Alice’s secret key. The KDC also sends a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket), encrypted with the TGS’s secret key 3. Alice decrypts the session key and uses it to request permission to print from the TGS 4. Seeing that Alice has a valid session key (and therefore has proven her identity claim), the TGS sends her a C/S session key (second session key) to use to print. The TGS also sends a service ticket encrypted with the printer’s key. 5. Alice connects to the printer. The printer, seeing a valid C/S session key, knows she has permission to print, and also knows that she is authentic This process is summarized in Figure 2.4. The session key in step 2 of Figure 2.4 is encrypted with Alice’s key (represented as {Session Key}KeyAlice). Note that the TGT is encrypted with the TGS’s key: Alice cannot decrypt the TGT (only the TGS can); she simply sends it to the TGS. The TGT contains a number of items, including a copy of Alice’s session key. This is how the TGS knows that Alice has a valid session key (which proves that Alice is authenticated).\n\n1: Alice wishes to authenticate\n\n2: {Session Key}KeyAlice {TGT}KeyTGS\n\nKerberos Principal Alice\n\nKey Distribution Center (KDC)\n\n3: Alice wishes to print {TGT}KeyTGS, {Auth1}Keysession\n\n4: {Service Ticket}Keyprinter {C/S Session Key}Keysession\n\n5: Service: print {Service Ticket}Keyprinter {Auth2}Keyc/s session\n\nTicket Granting Server (TGS)\n\nPrinter\n\nFigure 2.4 Kerberos steps. Source: Kerberos. URL: www.giac.org/resources/whitepaper/cryptography/47.php (accessed July 21, 2010).\n\nDomain 2: Access Control Chapter 2 The TGT is good for a site-selected specific lifetime, often set at 10 hours. This allows a typical user to authenticate once and access network resources for the lifetime of the ticket. Kerberos is stateless for this reason: Once Alice has a TGT, she may use it for its lifetime, even if the KDC goes offline. Also, the TGS can allow Alice to print without consulting the KDC: Everything the TGS needs to know is contained in the traffic Alice sends, including the TGT and the first authenticator. The same is true for the service ticket Alice sends to the printer. It is encrypted with the printer’s key and contains a copy of the client/server session key. Alice cannot decrypt it and simply passes it back to the printer. This allows the printer to make its decision based entirely on what Alice sends, without consulting the KDC or the TGS.\n\nSESAME The Secure European System for Applications in a Multi-vendor Envi­ronment (SESAME) is a single sign-on system that supports heterogeneous environments. It can be thought of as a sequel of sorts to Kerberos: “SESAME adds to Kerberos: heterogeneity, sophisticated access control features, scalability of public key systems, better manageability, audit and delegation.”7 Of those improvements, the addition of public key (asymmetric) encryption is the most compelling because it addresses one of the biggest weaknesses in Kerberos: the plaintext storage of symmetric keys. SESAME uses Privilege Attribute Certificates (PACs) in place of Kerberos tickets. More information on SESAME is available at www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/ sesame/.\n\nAssessing access control A number of processes exist to assess the effectiveness of access control. Tests with a narrow scope include penetration, vulnerability assessments, and security audits. A security assessment is a broader test that may include the narrower tests (e.g., penetration), as subsections.\n\nPenetration testing A penetration tester is a white-hat hacker who receives authorization to attempt to break into an organization’s physical or electronic perimeter (and sometimes both). Penetration tests (“pen tests” for short) are designed to determine whether black-hat hackers can do the same. They are narrow, but often useful, especially if the penetration tester is successful. Penetration tests may include the following: Network (Internet) Network (internal or DMZ) n War dialing n n\n\n33\n\n34\n\nEleventh Hour CISSP® Study Guide Wireless Physical (attempt to gain entrance to a facility or room) n Wireless n n\n\nNetwork attacks may leverage client-side, server-side, or web application attacks. (See Chapter 5 for more information on these.) War dialing uses a modem to dial a series of phone numbers, looking for an answering modem carrier tone (the penetration tester then attempts to access the answering system); the name derives from the 1983 movie WarGames. Social engineering uses the human mind to bypass security controls. It may be used in combination with many types of attacks, especially client-side attacks or physical tests A zero knowledge (or black-box) test is “blind”; the penetration tester starts with no external or trusted information and begins with public information only. A full knowledge test (also called crystal-box) provides internal information to the penetration tester, including network diagrams, policies and procedures, and sometime reports from previous testers. Partial knowledge tests are between zero and full knowledge: The penetration tester receives limited trusted information.\n\nVulnerability testing Vulnerability scanning (also called vulnerability testing) scans a network or system for a list of predefined vulnerabilities such as system misconfiguration, outdated software, or a lack of patching. A vulnerability testing tool such as Nessus (www.nessus.org) or OpenVAS (www.openvas.org) may be used to identify the vulnerabilities.\n\nSecurity audits A security audit is a test against a published standard. Organizations may be audited for PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliance, for example. PCI includes many required controls such as firewalls, specific access control models, and wireless encryption. An auditor verifies that a site or organization meets the published standard.\n\nSecurity assessments Security assessments are a holistic approach to assessing the effectiveness of access control. Instead of looking narrowly at penetration tests or vulnerability assessments, security assessments have a broader scope.\n\nSummary of exam objectives If one thinks of the castle analogy for security, access control would be the moat and the castle walls. It ensures that the border protection mechanisms, from both a logical and a physical viewpoint, are secured. Its purpose is to\n\nDomain 2: Access Control Chapter 2 allow authorized users access to appropriate data and to deny access to unauthorized users. This is also known as limiting subjects’ access to objects. Even though this task is complex and involved, it is possible to implement a strong access control program without overburdening the users who rely on access to the system. Protecting the CIA triad is another key aspect to implementing access controls. Maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability is of the utmost importance. Maintaining the security of a CIA’s system means enacting specific procedures for data access. These procedures will change depending on the functionality that users require and the sensitivity of the data stored in the system.\n\nTop five toughest questions 1. Which group launches the most attacks? A. Insiders B. Outsiders C. Hacktivists D. Script kiddies Questions 2 and 3 are based on this scenario: Your company has hired a ­third party to conduct a penetration test. Your CIO wants to know if exploitation of critical business systems is possible. The following are the company’s two requirements: The tests will be conducted on live business-functional networks. These networks must be functional in order for business to run and cannot be shut down, even for an evaluation. n The test will be as in depth as possible. n\n\n2. Which kind of test should be recommended? A. Zero knowledge B. Partial knowledge C. Full knowledge D. Vulnerability 3. While conducting the penetration test, the tester discovers that a critical business system is currently compromised. What should he do? A. Note the results in the penetration testing report B. Immediately end the penetration test and call the CIO C. Remove the malware D. Shut the system down 4. A policy that a user must have a business requirement to view data before attempting to do so is an example of enforcing what? A. Least privilege B. Need to know C. Rotation of duties D. Separation of duties\n\n35\n\n36\n\nEleventh Hour CISSP® Study Guide 5. Which technique would raise the False Accept Rate (FAR) and lower the False Reject Rate (FRR) in a fingerprint-scanning system? A. Decrease the amount of minutiae that is verified B. Increase the amount of minutiae that is verified C. Lengthen the enrollment time D. Lower the throughput time\n\nAnswers 1. Correct Answer and Explanation: B. Answer B is correct; outsiders launch most attacks (though most fail). Incorrect Answers and Explanations: A, C, and D. Answers A, C, and D are incorrect. Insiders may launch the most successful attacks that cause the highest impact, but most attacks are launched from the outside (and typically mitigated). Hacktivists and Script kiddies are usually subsets of outsiders, making B the best answer. 2. Correct Answer and Explanation: C. C is the correct answer; the customer wants a full evaluation but is worried because of the importance of the network. Because the customer wants as full an evaluation as possible but does not want the network in any kind of jeopardy, a full knowledge assessment is necessary because it is the only one that will allow for the most in-depth analysis with the least amount of risk to the network. Incorrect Answers and Explanations: A, B, and D. A is incorrect because a zero knowledge test will not produce the most in-depth assessment of the network. B is incorrect because partial knowledge, although better than zero knowledge, will not produce the necessary assessment. D is incorrect because vulnerability testing does not exploit systems, which is a requirement of the test. 3. Correct Answer and Explanation: B. Answer B is correct; when discovering a live malicious intrusion, the penetration tester should immediately end the test and notify the client. Incorrect Answers and Explanations: A, C, and D. Answers A, C, and D are incorrect. Noting the results is not enough: System integrity, data integrity, and confidentiality are compromised or at risk and immediate action is required. Removing the malware may cause more damage and/or alert the attackers to the penetration tester’s presence. Attackers may become more malicious if they believe they have been discovered. Shutting the system down will harm availability (and possibly integrity), and will destroy any evidence that exists in memory. 4. Correct Answer and Explanation: B. Answer B is correct; need to know means that the user must have a need (requirement) to access a specific object before doing so. Incorrect Answers and Explanations: A, C, and D. Answers A, C, and D are incorrect. Least privilege is less granular than need to know: Users have the least amount of privilege to do their jobs, but objects are still typically grouped together (such as for allowing access to all backup tapes for a\n\nDomain 2: Access Control Chapter 2 backup administrator). Separation of duties is designed to divide sensitive tasks among multiple subjects. Rotation of duties is designed to mitigate collusion. 5. Correct Answer and Explanation: A. Answer A is correct; decreasing the amount of minutiae will lower the accuracy of the system, which will lower false rejects but raise false accepts. Incorrect Answers and Explanations: B, C, and D. Answers B, C, and D are incorrect. Increasing the amount of minutiae will make the system more accurate, increasing the FRR and lowering the FAR. Enrollment and throughput time are not directly connected to FAR and FRR.\n\nEndnotes 1. RFC 1334 PAP. URL: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1334#section-2 (accessed July 21, 2010). 2. RFC 1994 CHAP.

While the fact that data is being transmitted may be known, the content of that data should remain unknown to third parties. Data in motion (moving on a network) and at rest (stored on a device such as a disk) may be encrypted.\n\nCornerstone cryptographic concepts Fundamental cryptographic concepts are embodied by all strong encryption. They must be understood before learning about specific implementations.\n\nKey terms Cryptology is the science of secure communications. Cryptography creates messages whose meaning is hidden. Cryptanalysis is the science of breaking encrypted messages (recovering their meaning). Many use the term ­cryptography in place of cryptology; however, it is important to remember that cryptology encompasses both cryptography and cryptanalysis. A cipher is a cryptographic algorithm. A plaintext message is an unencrypted message. Encryption converts the plaintext to ciphertext. Decryption turns ciphertext back into plaintext.\n\nEleventh Hour CISSP® Study Guide.

Cryptography can also provide authentication (proving an identity claim). Additionally, cryptography can provide nonrepudiation, which is assurance that a specific user performed a specific transaction and assurance that the transaction did not change.\n\nSubstitution and permutation Cryptographic substitution replaces one character for another. Permutation (also called transposition) rearranges the characters of the plaintext anagramstyle. “ATTACKATDAWN” can be rearranged to “CAAKDTANTATW,” for example. Substitution and permutation are often combined.\n\nDid You Know? Strong encryption destroys patterns. If a single bit of plaintext changes, the odds of every bit of resulting ciphertext changing should be 50/50. Any signs of nonrandomness may be used as clues by a cryptanalyst, hinting at the underlying order of the original plaintext or key.\n\nCryptographic strength Good encryption is strong: For key-based encryption, it should be very difficult (and ideally impossible) to convert ciphertext back to plaintext without the key. The work factor describes how long it will take to break a cryptosystem (i.e., to decrypt a ciphertext without the key). Secrecy of the cryptographic algorithm does not provide strength. In fact, secret algorithms are often proven to be quite weak. Strong crypto relies on math, not secrecy, to provide strength. Ciphers that have stood the test of time are public algorithms such as the Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES) and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).\n\nMonoalphabetic and polyalphabetic ciphers A monoalphabetic cipher uses one alphabet: A specific letter (say E) is substituted for another (say X). A polyalphabetic cipher uses multiple alphabets: E may be substituted for X in one round and then S in the next round. Monoalphabetic ciphers are susceptible to frequency analysis.\n\nExclusive Or Exclusive Or (XOR) is the “secret sauce” behind modern encryption. Combining a key with a plaintext via XOR creates ciphertext. XORing the same key to the ciphertext restores the original plaintext.\n\nDomain 3: Cryptography Chapter 3\n\nTable 3.1\n\nXOR Truth Table\n\nX\n\nY\n\nX XOR Y\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\nTwo bits are true (or 1) if one or the other (exclusively, not both) is 1. If both bits are 0 or both bits are 1, they XOR to 0. XOR uses a truth table (see Table 3.1). In the truth table, a 0 is false and a 1 is true. This dictates how to combine the bits of a key and plaintext.\n\nTypes of cryptography There are three primary types of modern encryption: symmetric, asymmetric, and hashing, which will be discussed in the following sections. Symmetric encryption uses one key: The same key encrypts and decrypts. Asymmetric cryptography uses two keys: If you encrypt with one key, you can decrypt with the other. Hashing is a one-way cryptographic transformation using an algorithm (and no key).\n\nSymmetric encryption Symmetric encryption uses one key to encrypt and decrypt. If you encrypt a zip file and then decrypt it with the same key, you are using symmetric encryption. In symmetric encryption, also called “secret key” encryption, the key must be kept secret from third parties. Strengths include speed and cryptographic strength per bit of key. The major weakness is that the key must be securely shared before two parties may securely communicate. Symmetric keys are often shared via an out-of-band method, such as faceto-face discussion.\n\nStream and block ciphers Symmetric encryption may have stream and block modes. Stream mode means that each bit is independently encrypted in a “stream.” Block mode ciphers encrypt blocks of data each round: for example, 56 bits for the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and 128, 192, or 256 bits for AES. Some block ciphers can emulate stream ciphers by setting the block size to 1 bit.\n\nDES DES is the Data Encryption Standard, which describes the Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA). DES was designed by IBM, based on their older Lucifer symmetric cipher. It uses a 64-bit block size (meaning that it encrypts 64 bits each round) and a 56-bit key.\n\n41\n\n42\n\nEleventh Hour CISSP® Study Guide\n\nExam Warning Even though “DES” is commonly referred to as an algorithm, it is technically the name of the published standard that describes DEA. It may sound like splitting hairs, but that is an important distinction to keep in mind on the exam. “DEA” may be the best answer for a question regarding the algorithm itself.\n\nModes of DES DES can use five different modes to encrypt data. The modes’ primary differences are block versus (emulated) stream, the use of initialization vectors, and whether errors in encryption will propagate to subsequent blocks.\n\nFast Facts The five modes of DES are n\n\nElectronic Code Book (ECB) Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) n Cipher Feedback (CFB) n Output Feedback (OFB) n Counter (CTR) n\n\nECB is the original mode of DES. CBC, CFB, and OFB were later added in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 81 (see www .itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip81.htm). CTR is the newest mode, described in NIST Special Publication 800-38a (see http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-38a/sp80038a.pdf).\n\nElectronic Code Book Electronic Code Book (ECB) is the simplest and weakest form of DES. It uses no initialization vector or chaining. Identical plaintexts with identical keys encrypt to identical ciphertexts. Two plaintexts with partial identical portions (such as the header of a letter) encrypted with the same key have partial identical ciphertext portions. ECB may also leave plaintext patterns evident in the resulting ciphertext.\n\nCipher Block Chaining Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) is a block mode of DES that XORs the previous encrypted block of ciphertext to the next block of plaintext to be encrypted. The first encrypted block is an initialization vector that contains random data. This “chaining” destroys patterns. One limitation of CBC is that encryption errors propagate: An encryption error in one block will cascade through subsequent blocks because of the chaining, thus destroying their integrity.\n\nDomain 3: Cryptography Chapter 3 Cipher Feedback Cipher Feedback (CFB) is very similar to CBC; the primary difference is that CFB is a stream mode, using feedback to destroy patterns. Like CBC, CFB uses an initialization vector; patterns are destroyed and errors propagate.\n\nOutput Feedback Output Feedback (OFB) differs from CFB in the way feedback is accomplished: CFB uses the previous ciphertext—that is, the previous ciphertext is the subkey XORed to the plaintext. OFB uses the subkey before it is XORed to the plaintext. Since the subkey is not affected by encryption errors, errors do not propagate.\n\nCounter Counter (CTR) is like OFB; the difference again is the feedback: CTR uses a counter. This mode shares the same advantages as OFB (patterns are destroyed and errors do not propagate) with an additional advantage: since the feedback can be as simple as an ascending number, CTR encryption can be done in parallel. A simple example would be the first block is XORed to the number 1, the second to the number 2, and so forth. Any number of rounds can be combined in parallel in this way. Table 3.2 summarizes the 5 modes of DES.\n\nSingle DES Single DES is the original DES implementation, encrypting 64-bit blocks of data with a 56-bit key using 16 rounds of encryption. The work factor required to break DES was reasonable in 1976, but advances in CPU speed and parallel architecture have made it vulnerable to a brute-force key attack today, where every possible key is generated and attempted. Triple DES Triple DES applies single DES encryption three times per block. Formally called the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) and commonly called TDES, it became a recommended standard in 1999.\n\nTable 3.2\n\nModes of DES\n\nMode\n\nType\n\nInitialization vector\n\nError propagation?\n\nElectronic Code Book (ECB) Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Cipher Feedback (CFB) Output Feedback (OFB) Counter Mode (CTR)\n\nBlock Block Stream Stream Stream\n\nNo Yes Yes Yes Yes\n\nNo Yes Yes No No\n\n43\n\n44\n\nEleventh Hour CISSP® Study Guide Triple DES encryption order and keying options Triple DES applies DES encryption three times per block. FIPS 46-3 describes this as “Encrypt, Decrypt, Encrypt” (EDE) order using three keying options: one, two, or three unique keys (1TDES EDE, 2TDES EDE, and 3TDES EDE, respectively).\n\nInternational Data Encryption Algorithm The International Data Encryption Algorithm is a symmetric block cipher designed as an international replacement for DES. Patented in many countries, IDEA uses a 128-bit key and a 64-bit block size.\n\nAdvanced Encryption Standard The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the current U.S. standard symmetric block cipher. It uses 128-bit keys (10 rounds of encryption), 192-bit keys (12 rounds of encryption), or 256-bit keys (14 rounds of encryption) to encrypt 128-bit blocks of data.\n\nChoosing AES The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) solicited input on a replacement for DES in the Federal Register in January 1997. Fifteen AES candidates were announced in August 1998, and the list was reduced to five in August 1999. Table 3.3 lists the five AES finalists. Rijndael was chosen and became AES, which has four functions: SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey.\n\nBlowfish and Twofish Blowfish an"
