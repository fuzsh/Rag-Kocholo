        "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron has called on Iran to “avoid regional military escalation” following last weekend’s deadly attack on a soccer field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights which Israel maintains was carried out by the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.\n\nAlthough Hezbollah has “firmly” denied masterminding the attack, Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has promised to ensure that Hezbollah “pays the price,” spiking fears that a wider regional war could break out.\n\nMacron called his Iranian counterpart, newly elected President Masoud Pezeshkian, on Monday to express his “deep concern at the rising tensions between Israel and Lebanon” among other issues, according to a readout from the Élysée Palace.\n\nFrance has committed to staying in contact with all parties to “avoid a war that would have devastating consequences for the region,” the Élysée stressed.\n\nThe Lebanese government has warned Israel about the ramifications of invading Lebanon with the country’s caretaker Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib telling CNN’s Ben Wedeman Sunday that “war against Lebanon is a regional war” that would see other actors such as the Houthis and Iraqi militias get involved in fighting.\n\nThe Israeli Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on Monday hit back at Hamas accusations that changing Israeli conditions were hampering a ceasefire and hostage deal.\n\nThe PMO said that it was instead the Hamas leadership that was preventing an agreement.\n\nBut the PMO said Israel had not changed or added conditions to the proposal.\n\nCNN has previously reported that Netanyahu had made eleventh-hour demands, including barring armed men from northern Gaza and Israeli control of the Philadelphi corridor, a 14km strip of land that serves as a buffer zone on the border between Egypt and Gaza.\n\nThe PMO’s latest statements directly addressed those demands but described them as part of the “original outline.”\n\n“Israel stands on its principles according to the original outline: Maximizing the number of living hostages, Israeli control over the Philadelphi Corridor and preventing the passage of terrorists, weapons and ammunition to the northern Gaza Strip,” it said.\n\nMore than 200,000 people – nine percent of Gaza’s population – have been displaced over the past week in the wake of Israeli evacuation orders, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said Monday.\n\n“Humanitarian partners tracking population movements in Gaza estimate that new directives issued by Israeli authorities on Saturday and Sunday affected parts of Rafah, Khan Younis and Deir al Balah where a combined 56,000 people had been sheltering,” it added.\n\nOnly around 14 percent of areas in Gaza “are not under evacuation orders,” the Commissioner-General for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, said in a post on X on Sunday.\n\nThe latest round of displacement “comes at a time when water, sanitation and hygiene conditions are being further eroded in Gaza, with infectious diseases on the rise,” UNOCHA said.\n\n“Earlier this month, the polio virus was detected in wastewater samples in Gaza. Though no cases have been recorded, it is crucial that conditions on the ground enable aid organizations to respond quickly and at scale, including by ensuring that children can receive vaccines. The World Health Organization announced last week that it is sending 1 million polio vaccines to Gaza,” UNOCHA added.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told his American counterpart Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin that Israel would hold Hezbollah responsible for Saturday’s deadly strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.\n\nGallant spoke to Austin on Monday, briefing him on the attack. He shared with Austin the evidence that Israel said indicates Hezbollah’s responsibility for the strike, according to a statement from Israel’s Government Press Office (GPO).\n\nThe Iran-backed Lebanese militant group on Saturday “firmly denied” firing projectiles into the village of Majdal Shams, where 12 children were killed and many others injured.\n\n“Minister Gallant expressed his appreciation to Secretary Austin and the US administration for their clear stance vis-a-vis Hezbollah’s attack, and for their ongoing commitment to Israel’s security,” the GPO said.\n\nWeapons experts told CNN the rocket that exploded on the soccer pitch in the village was likely fired by militants.\n\nAnalyzing footage of the explosion and its aftermath, experts told CNN the blast and damage seen on the site were consistent with the types of munitions fired at northern Israel and the Golan Heights from Lebanon and Syria.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday said “every indication” suggests the strike which killed 12 children in the occupied Golan Heights was a rocket fired by Hezbollah.\n\nThe US is not currently planning to evacuate US citizens from Lebanon, even as a growing number of airlines cancel Beirut flights, according to a State Department spokesperson.\n\n“We don’t have any plans for, or an announcement as it relates to, an evacuation or efforts for private US citizens from Lebanon,” State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel told a press briefing.\n\nPatel also said there has been no change to the staffing or security levels at the US embassy there.\n\n“Our message to American citizens in Lebanon continues to be that they should enroll in the Smart Traveler program so that they can receive important messages about the safety conditions on the ground and other considerations and factors that they may have,” said Patel.\n\nPatel also reiterated that the State Department has issued a Level 3 travel advisory, meaning that US citizens should “reconsider travel,” for all of Lebanon, and a “do not travel” Level 4 advisory for southern Lebanon specifically.\n\nThe US Embassy in Beirut on Monday recommended a “crisis plan of action” for US citizens in Lebanon in a new post on social media according to Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs Rena Bitter. This included an advisory to be prepared to “shelter in place for long periods of time,” as the country braces for an Israeli response to the rocket attack on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights which killed at least 12 children.\n\nAt around midnight on Sunday, the CNN team in Beirut rushed to the hotel balcony after hearing what sounded like explosions. What we found instead were fireworks lighting up the night sky from a nearby rave.\n\nTens of thousands of Lebanon’s relatively affluent diaspora have flocked to Beirut this summer, despite daily confrontations between Hezbollah and Israel at Lebanon’s southern border, just a two-hour drive from the capital. The threat of a wider war has loomed over the summer season, normally a boon for Lebanon’s flailing economy. This year seems to be no exception, with hundreds of thousands of airport arrivals in June alone, according to Lebanese officials, ignoring the warnings of a growing chorus of countries calling on their nationals to avoid travel to the tiny eastern Mediterranean country.\n\nThe July 27 strike in the town of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 children and teenagers at a soccer field sent tensions soaring. Israel blamed the attack on Hezbollah, who denied the allegations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to deliver a “severe” retaliation.\n\nA full-throated diplomatic effort has sought to prevent an escalation, fearing that a wider war that could rope in Hezbollah’s allies beyond Lebanon’s borders, triggering unforeseen consequences. Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told CNN’s Ben Wedeman that Beirut had received “assurances” from unnamed international actors that Israel’s anticipated strike would be “limited,” falling short of triggering a wider war.\n\nBouHabib said Lebanon was not given specifics about what a “limited response” would entail.\n\nHezbollah itself is in a heightened state of alert and has vacated some military positions. “The state of mobilization and preparedness, and the vacating some of the military positions here and there is a normal part of the war, especially since the escalation in Israeli threats since yesterday,” Mohammad Afif, head of Hezbollah’s media unit, told CNN.\n\nMeanwhile, Lebanon’s summer season continues apace, and it feels a world away from the death and devastation that stalks the southern part of the country, where around 100,000 people have been displaced.\n\nToday, especially, those words resonate.\n\nThe Biden administration said Monday that Israel “has a right to respond” to the attack in the Golan Heights that killed a dozen children on Saturday – and it believed fears the attack could lead to a broader war were “exaggerated.”\n\nWhite House national security spokesperson John Kirby said during a call with reporters Monday that the US “absolutely condemned” the attack.\n\n“Our hearts go out to all the families of those who lost loved ones, and certainly we’re praying for a speedy recovery for those who have been hurt.”\n\nKirby said the attack was conducted by the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, “despite their denials.”\n\n“It’s their rocket,” Kirby said. “It’s launched from an area that they control.”\n\nKirby said the administration believed there was still time and space for a diplomatic solution and that it was in continuous discussions with its Israeli and Lebanese counterparts, continuing “to support efforts to reach a diplomatic solution.”\n\nThat solution, Kirby said, will “end these terrible attacks once and for all” and “allow Israeli and Lebanese citizens on both sides of the border to safely return to their homes.”\n\n“Our support for Israel’s security remains ironclad, and it’s unwavering against all Iran-backed threats, including those from Hezbollah,” Kirby said. “No nation can be expected to tolerate the kind of severe threats that the Israelis face.”\n\nAsked about fears of a broader conflict in the region, Kirby responded that at “multiple points over the last 10 months, those predictions were exaggerated.”\n\n“Quite frankly,” he said, “we think they’re exaggerated now.”\n\nIsrael’s response to the deadly rocket attack on Majdal Shams over the weekend “will be severe,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a visit to the town on Monday, according to a statement from his office.\n\n“These children are our children, they are the children of all of us,” Netanyahu said. “The State of Israel will not and cannot put this to rest. Our response will come, and it will be severe.”\n\nNetanyahu was accompanied by the head of Shin Bet, Ronen Bar. The two men met representatives of the bereaved families, the statement said.\n\nIsrael blamed the Lebanese group Hezbollah for the rocket attack that killed 12 children in Majdal Shams, a Syrian Druze town in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Hezbollah denies it was behind the attack.\n\nMore than 20,000 Druze Arabs live in the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in 1967. Many of them identify as Syrian and have rejected an offer of Israeli citizenship. None of the people killed in Saturday’s attack held Israeli citizenship, the Regional Council of Majdal Shams told CNN.\n\nThe strike was the deadliest to hit Israel or Israeli-controlled territory since the October 7 attack by Hamas.\n\nThe United States and several European countries have reiterated calls for their citizens to urgently leave Lebanon, as the country braces for an Israeli response to a deadly rocket attack that Israel has blamed on the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.\n\nThe US Embassy of Beirut recommends a “crisis plan of action” for US citizens in Lebanon, Rena Bitter, assistant secretary for consular affairs, said in a video message posted on X Monday.\n\nBitter said US citizens should leave before a crisis begins, or if transportation is not available, “individuals already in Lebanon should be prepared to shelter in place for long periods of time.” She also warned against relatives coming to Lebanon “should conflict increase in the region.”\n\nA German foreign ministry spokesperson on Monday also called on Germans still in Lebanon to urgently leave. The Belgian foreign ministry warned its citizens the security situation could deteriorate without notice and that the entire country could be affected by escalating conflict.\n\nOther European countries, including the United Kingdom and Ireland, have said their previous warnings from late June still stand. Last month, countries around the world urged citizens to leave Lebanon amid heightened tensions and daily exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael’s emergency security cabinet has authorized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to decide on “the nature” and “timing” of the response against Hezbollah, according to a Sunday statement from the prime minister’s office.\n\nThis comes after Israel blamed the Lebanese militant group for a rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 children and teenagers on Saturday, which Hezbollah denies orchestrating.\n\nLebanon’s caretaker Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib has however said he received reassurances from third countries that Israel’s response to the strike will be limited, hinting that the US and France were two of those countries.\n\nThe attack was the deadliest to hit Israel or Israeli-controlled territory since the October 7 attack by Hamas. Israel vowed Hezbollah will “pay the price.”\n\nThe strike has raised fears once again that an all-out war could envelop the region. A key backer of Hezbollah, Iran has warned against “any new adventures” aimed at Lebanon, while Bou Habib said his country will not get involved in a war, but will stand behind Hezbollah.\n\nBou Habib also warned that other actors in the region may get involved, including in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.\n\nOnly 14% of Gaza is not under Israeli evacuation orders, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said Sunday.\n\n“Almost everyone in Gaza has been impacted by these orders,” he said, adding that many Palestinians have been forced to flee on average once a month since October 7.\n\nHuman rights agencies have warned against Israeli evacuation orders issued without the promise of safety or secure accommodation for Palestinians trying to survive bombardment. Israel has previously asked Palestinians to relocate from “humanitarian zones” as it expanded its military operation or sought to uproot what it said were Hamas fighters embedded in the areas.\n\nLazzarini warned that the evacuation orders are creating havoc and panic as well as bringing more misery and suffering to civilians. “The people of Gaza are not pinballs or chess pieces, they are people,” he said on X.\n\nThe statement comes hours after the Israeli military issued another evacuation order for Palestinians in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza.\n\nAbout 200,000 Palestinians have been evacuated throughout last week, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nIsrael has vowed that Hezbollah will “pay the price” after blaming the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group for a rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 children on Saturday.\n\nWhile Hezbollah says it “firmly denies” it was behind the strike, it has raised fears once again that an all-out war would envelop the region.\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\nKids killed while playing soccer: At least 12 children were killed when a rocket hit a football pitch in Majdal Shams, in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday. At least 44 people were wounded in the attack that left the town’s Syrian Druze community in shock. A funeral procession was held in the middle of the village on Sunday. “They were just kids. What did they do wrong?” one resident told CNN.\n\nMajor escalation: The attack involved “approximately 30 projectiles” crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory, and was the deadliest to hit Israeli-controlled territory since the October 7 Hamas attacks. It was a major escalation in what had already been an extremely volatile few months in the border area between Israel and Lebanon.\n\nIsrael blames Hezbollah: Israeli officials have blamed Hezbollah for the strike and Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant pledged a heavy response. “Hezbollah is responsible for this and they will pay the price,” Gallant said. “We will hit the enemy hard,” he said in an earlier statement.\n\nHezbollah denies it: Hezbollah acknowledged striking the Golan Heights on Saturday, but “firmly” denied responsibility for the attack on Majdal Shams.\n\nWeapons expert weighs in: Experts told CNN the blast and damage was consistent with the types of munitions fired at Israel and the Golan Heights from Lebanon and Syria. Weapon fragments at the scene indicated the rocket was fired by Hezbollah or another militant group, one expert said, ruling out the possibility of the blast having been caused by an Israeli interceptor missile.\n\nLebanon’s response: Lebanon will not get involved in a war, but will stand behind Hezbollah, the country’s foreign minister said. If Israel responded by invading Lebanon, it risked dragging the whole region into war. “It’s not going to be Hezbollah against Israel…You have the Houthis, you have the Iraqi militias, you have militias in Syria who are not Syrians: Pakistani, Afghan militias. They’re all going to get involved in that,” caretaker Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said.\n\nIsrael’s response: Lebanon has said it received reassurances from third countries that Israel’s response to the deadly strike on a town in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights will be limited. Hezbollah’s response to Israel’s escalation will also be limited, Lebanon’s foreign minister said. Asked to identify the countries that had offered reassurance, the minister hinted that the US and France were two of those countries.\n\nMeanwhile in Gaza:\n\nIsraeli attacks continue: Israeli attacks killed at least 19 Palestinians, including children, and wounded numerous others across Gaza on Sunday. At least 10 were killed in an airstrike on a house in Khan Younis. CNN video shot at the Nasser Hospital shows several body bags at the morgue and people carrying the wounded, including children. Another airstrike hit tents in the Al-Mawasi area, which the Israeli military has designated a “humanitarian zone,” killing at least four people.\n\nPerpetual displacement: Only 14 percent of Gaza is not under Israeli evacuation orders, the UNRWA Commissioner-General said Sunday. “Almost everyone in Gaza has been impacted by these orders,” he said. Many Palestinians have been forced to flee on average once a month since October 7, he said. On Sunday, almost 30,000 people were in the area Israel designated for evacuation in the Bureij refugee camp and Al-Shuhada street.\n\nThe Israeli military issued yet more evacuation orders to thousands of people in Gaza on Sunday.\n\nIn central Gaza’s Bureij refugee camp and Al-Shuhada street, about 30,000 people were affected by the evacuation order, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said.\n\nA man evacuating the Bureij camp with his son on Sunday told CNN it was his 26th time being displaced since his house was destroyed a few days following October 7.\n\nAnother Gazan told CNN the Palestinians there are “living like animals” and that he has to keep going for his family.\n\nAn elderly woman using a stick to walk was also seen evacuating toward the Nuseirat camp.\n\nOn Sunday, Israeli attacks killed at least 19 Palestinians, including children, and wounded numerous others across Gaza, according to health officials and Gaza’s Civil Defense.\n\nIran on Sunday warned Israel against “any new adventures” aimed at Lebanon following the deadly rocket strike in the town of Majdal Shams.\n\nIsrael has blamed Hezbollah for the strike which killed at least 12 children, while the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group has denied responsibility.\n\nSome context: Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza has escalated hostilities across the region and brought a longstanding shadow war with Iran out into the open.\n\nIran’s allies and proxies – the so-called axis of resistance – have launched attacks on Israeli forces and its allies, including US military positions, since October.\n\nWho is Hezbollah? An Iran-backed Islamist movement with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, Hezbollah is seen as Iran’s most effective non-state partner, possessing an estimated 150,000 rockets that could overwhelm Israel’s defenses if an all-out war breaks out.\n\nFor months, the international community has been trying to de-escalate tensions between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nThe Lebanese foreign minister has warned that if Israel responded by invading Lebanon, it risked dragging the whole region into war.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah have been trading rocket fire on a near-daily basis with increasing ferocity since Hamas’ October 7 attacks on Israel.\n\nEven before Saturday’s strike, regional leaders had warned the conflict was reaching a boiling point, sparking fears on several occasions that Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza would spiral into a conflict on multiple fronts across the Middle East.\n\nThe tit-far-tat strikes across the border had become more frequent in recent weeks, with both sides targeting sites deeper into each other’s territory.\n\nTensions increased further when Israel killed two high-ranking Hezbollah commanders in June – Sami Taleb Abdullah in May and Muhammed Neamah Naser – blaming them for directing attacks both before and after the October 7 assault. Hezbollah retaliated by firing hundreds of missiles into Israel.\n\nFollowing Saturday’s strike on the soccer field, Israeli warplanes conducted airstrikes against Hezbollah targets “deep inside Lebanese territory” and along the border overnight Sunday, according to the military.\n\nAll eyes on Israel: Israel’s initial response appeared to stop short of the kind of attack that would launch an all-out war, but it gave rise to an incredibly tense day in the region.\n\nYesterday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened an emergency security cabinet meeting, and members “authorized the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense to decide on the nature of the response against the terror organization Hezbollah, and on its’ timing,” according to the Prime Minister’s Office.\n\nIsraeli officials have blamed Hezbollah for the strike and vowed to retaliate, while the Lebanese militant group has denied responsibility.\n\nIn the wake of the deadly strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, some residents of the town of Majdal Shams have questioned whether the area’s warning system was working properly.\n\nAn eyewitness to the strike on the soccer field told CNN’s Jeremy Diamond that the rocket hit less than five seconds after the sirens sounded.\n\nNo time to react: Majdal Shams resident Taymor Wili said he was in his apartment overlooking the soccer field when the rocket hit. He said there was no time for the children on the field to react between the first alert siren and the moment of impact.\n\nHe also said the safety shelter was only yards from the soccer field and if those on the pitch had had more time, they likely could have made it to the shelter.\n\nVideo of the safety shelter shows it yards away from the crater made by the rocket’s impact.\n\nIn several videos from Majdal Shams, sirens can be heard for several seconds before the rocket hits.\n\nIsrael says system was working: The Israeli military told CNN that a preliminary examination showed the alert system was working properly before the rocket hit.\n\nEleven-year-old Alma was daddy’s little girl. She used to get away with anything she wanted. Her father, Ayman Fakhr al-Din said she was always filled with energy and loved playing sports.\n\nAlma was killed alongside 11 other children when a rocket hit a football pitch in Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday.\n\nAt least 44 people were wounded in the attack that has rocked the town’s Syrian Druze community.\n\nCaught between the simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, people here tell CNN they’re used to hearing sirens and seeing rockets flying overhead – but never like this.\n\nWhen Fakhr al-Din heard the massive attack rock the area, he called his eldest son, 13-year-old Rayan, to check on him.\n\nRayan and his younger brother had been playing on the football pitch just minutes before the rocket fell. Fakhr al-Din was relieved to know they were alive.\n\nTheir brothers assumed she had gone home, but Fakhr al-Din thought he’d go to the scene regardless.\n\nThe town’s tight-knit community is filled with a sense of bewilderment and shock.\n\nThousands of mourners paid their respects on Sunday at a funeral procession, with people standing on balconies and rooftops overlooking the ceremony.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nWhat is the Golan Heights? The Golan Heights is a plateau that Israel seized from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967 before formally annexing it in 1981. It shares a border with Jordan and Lebanon.\n\nThe Israeli-occupied part of the region is separated from Syria by a buffer zone supported by the United Nations.\n\nThe Golan Heights is considered to be occupied territory under international law and UN Security Council resolutions, and Syria continues to demand it be returned.\n\nThe area has often been a flashpoint, most recently in 2019 when former President Donald Trump said the US would recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights – a move that overturned years of policy and worsened tensions with Syria.\n\nIsrael sees the Golan Heights as key to its national security interests and says it needs to control the region to fend off threats from Syria and Iranian proxy groups there.\n\nWho are the Druze? The Druze are an Arab sect of roughly one million people who primarily live in Syria, Lebanon and Israel. The group practices an offshoot of Islam that permits no converts – either to or from the religion – and no intermarriage.\n\nMore than 20,000 Druze live in the Golan Heights. Most of them identify as Syrian and rejected an offer of Israeli citizenship when Israel seized the region in 1967.\n\nNone of the Druze killed in Saturday’s attack on the soccer field held Israeli citizenship, the Regional Council of Majdal Shams told CNN.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nBack in May, Amos Hochstein, US President Joe Biden’s point-man for keeping a lid on tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, spoke in a webinar.\n\nThe equivalent of that bus came on Saturday evening in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights when a rocket, which Israel says was launched by Hezbollah, slammed into a soccer pitch in the Druze town of Majdal Shams and killed 12 children. Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the strike.\n\nWill Hochstein’s fear come to pass? If Israel’s Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, is to be believed, it probably will.\n\nThe United States has blessed retaliatory action, to some degree.\n\nThe response, so far, has been timid.\n\nBut on a visit to Majdal Shams on Saturday, Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant pledged a heavy response.\n\n“Hezbollah is responsible for this and they will pay the price,” Gallant said. In an earlier statement from his office, he said:\n\nRead the full analysis."
