        "text": "I had a thorough check, and in the 13 years of archives of this particular blog, I don’t seem to have ever got around to writing about Zen, which was first broadcast in 2011, the year I started this blog. Go figure. But there I was last night, in France with nothing but my vast library of TV and film to draw from, and I decided to watch an episode.\n\nI read quite a few of the the books, by Michael Didbin (who died too young) and felt that the titular detective was interesting: seemed to solve crimes by accident, by stumbling (sometimes literally) into the solution. This trope was evident in the first episode of the too-short TV series, “Vendetta”, which involves Zen visiting a remote village to re-open a murder investigation. He literally falls into a hole, discovers a tunnel into the murder house, and then (later on) someone hands him the murder weapon to help him defend himself against a gangster, who has escaped from prison and is seeking revenge.\n\nPhew.\n\nI don’t know why* there were only three episodes, but I can think of several reasons. For a start, it was clearly a lavishly expensive show to make. Set in Italy, with lush locations, and featuring a cast of familiar faces. I think it would stand more of a chance in today’s streaming landscape, but back then I guess the overnights were everything.\n\nIt was a co-production between at least four different companies, so the money was clearly coming in dribs and drabs. O for an Apple to just throw them a bunch of cash. It really has the vibes of a contemporary prestige drama, and if, via a wormhole and a mass outbreak of amnesia, it were to drop on Apple TV+ this Friday, I’m sure it would do well.\n\nRufus Sewell, looking so young back then (he was just 43 when this was made) plays Aurelio Zen, an Italian detective with a reputation for honesty that embarrasses him in a system where everybody is assumed to be on the take. His reputation leads politicians to try to make use of him, which is what happens in the first episode. A confessed killer has withdrawn his confession, and to avoid an embarrassing court case, the pols want Zen to “solve” the crime by finding another perp.\n\nHe won’t do it, he says, and you know he wouldn’t. Except, turns out, he believes the guy who now says he didn’t do it, and finds all kinds of reasons to suspect that someone else was involved. Zen is a kind of anti-hero. He doesn’t often say what he’s thinking, and people just assume…\n\nIf you watch it (and, sorry, you can’t), you will find a veritable host of familiar faces. The show was filmed in Italy, but in English. There’s Ben Miles as a slimy political fixer; Greg Wise as the no-longer confessing suspect; Peter Guinness as the escaped gangster; Ed Stoppard as Zen’s office rival; Stanley Townsend as Zen’s boss; Zoe Tapper (3rd episode); and a host of beautiful women from the four corners of Europe, including Caterina Murino as Tania Moretti, office support worker and love interest for Zen. Caterino Murino is smoking hawt. You may know her from foreign films, like Casino Royale.\n\nIt’s in the casting that you can see the show’s age. All the cops are blokes, and the women are there to be dangerously Other or to worry about Zen. Which is a shame, but I think this would be fixed in the wormhole that brings the show to Apple TV+ in 2024.\n\n*At the bottom of the Wikipedia article, the story is told in links. From January 2011, the Guardian reflects on the rise of the Sunday night prestige drama: Zen and the art of Sunday night television scheduling. Then from March 2011, the sub-headline, Axed drama proves popular at the BBC’s international sales conference boosting chances of it being picked up by a UK broadcaster. (Reader, it wasn’t.) Because, here is the BBC on 28 April 2011: BBC One controller to cull male crime-fighters: BBC One controller Danny Cohen has said he plans to limit the number of male detectives in the channel’s dramas. Bum.\n\nDanny fucking Cohen. Where is he now? President of Access Entertainment, part of an American conglomerate that does media as part of a portfolio that includes biotech and real estate. A soulless suit climbing the greasy corporate pole, in other words. Fuck these people and their ambitions.\n\nAnyway, pour one out for Zen, and try to find it if you can. It’s worth a look. I got mine on iTunes, back when that was a thing. I’m watching another tonight.\n\nThings tend to happen in clusters, I guess. Here is a review of two period dramas on Apple TV+, both featuring murders and both with “strong female lead characters” fighting against misogyny and gender expectations. It must have been a good year to be in retro costume design.\n\nFirst to Baltimore in the 1960s, and we have a (non-devout) Jewish housewife, Maddie Schwartz, played by Natalie Portman. Maddie is unhappy in her marriage and is treated like shit by both him and her teenage son Seth (Noah Jupe), who has to be one of the most punchable characters ever committed to video. Obsessed with the murder of a neighbour’s daughter, she decides to leave both husband and son, and facing social opprobrium on Scarlet Letter levels, sets herself up in an apartment in a black neighbourhood.\n\nThe original inspirations for the novel on which this series is based were two real murder cases from 1969. The first was an 11-year-old Jewish girl whose murder got wall-to-wall press coverage. The second was the murder of a 33 year-old black woman, reported in the local African-American newspaper only.\n\nMoses Ingram plays Cleo Johnson, a woman working multiple jobs and dealing with a feckless husband. Her story plays out in parallel to Maddie’s. There are only slight hints, after a few episodes, that Cleo is about to become a murder victim.\n\nThis series was extravagantly praised in The Guardian, with a five-star review. Other critics have been less enthused. I have to say, though it has a great look and an intriguing premise, I don’t find it all that gripping. The switching between storylines keeps letting the air out, and the “murder mystery” which Maddie will eventually become interested in is no mystery to the audience, who are watching it all play out.\n\nI dunno. Natalie Portman is a huge star, but I realise I haven’t seen much she’s made since Beautiful Girls, which was one of her juvenile roles. I did love that film. Here, her character seems brittle and out of her depth. I suppose she’s supposed to be, but her slow evolution into investigative reporter is hard to swallow.\n\nAnd so to Mexico City, a couple of years later. Women in Blue, or Las Azules. You’re going to need those subtitles, or watch it dubbed. Sideburns, moustaches, leather jackets. We’re in an early 70s cop show. Could be Starsky and Hutch or Kojak. A serial killer called the Undresser is on the loose. To deflect press attention from criticism of the police, the new Chief decides to import some eye candy. Cue training montage, as female recruits are put through their paces and made to jump out of an aeroplane for some reason.\n\nWhen the last 16 are given their uniforms, it’s kinda kinky. The blue of the title is very blue, and the uniform boots are shiny and black. The women look fabulous. We’re supposed to notice. They’re dressed up like mannequins and put on parade. It’s kinda pervy. And yet all the while there’s a killer who ties women up and strangles them, leaving them without their clothes. Also pervy. Clue from the trailer: mannequins will be a factor.\n\nI love the look of this show, the use of split screen edits and other stylistic flourishes. The characters are cartoonish, telenovela-style, but the narrative plot is really interesting. In common with Lady in the Lake, these women face misogyny at every turn. Cheating husbands, demanding children, brutal fathers, indifferent employers. Sometimes it’s hard to be a woman, sang Tammy Wynette in 1968, and she was still singing it in 1975, when it got its UK release. Progress for women was and has been slow, and in many respects America is going backwards. Presumably there are weird republican men in America, even as we speak, watching these shows and thinking, damn right.\n\nBut not me. I find the sexism and misogyny hard to watch and hard to take. It’s very stressful. When one character’s father slaps her round the face for “putting me in this position”, you just want her to punch back. When Seth Schwarz speaks to Maddie like she’s his unfaithful servant, you want her to put him over her knee. Men! Just cut it out already.\n\nIf you were to watch just one of these, go for the subtitles and the women in blue. The Natalie Portman vehicle is a bit messier.\n\nTick tock. Three weeks to go. My pension kicks in September 1st, but there are three working weeks to the summer holiday, twenty-one days, fifteen working days. This year has been all about the countdowns. I’ve become a little OCD about countdowns. Not really. I couldn’t tell you how many working hours it is, for example. But it is about 28 lessons. Which seems quite a lot.\n\nPeople ask me all the time, but I’m still not feeling it really. The days pass slowly and I’m not feeling the imminence. One of my two timetable weeks is easier than the other, for reasons. So the good week passes relatively quickly, because I feel relaxed and my mood is better. The hard week drags, naturellement. Two of the last three weeks are the hard one. Hard won.\n\nBut being where we are in the school year also brings a blessing.\n\nSaturday saw the first stage of this year’s Tour de France, so of course I wasted the day in front of the TV while the sun shone outside, enjoying the shots of the beautiful Tuscan countryside, the castles, the peloton. I have sat through mawkish adverts for charities, unsparing in their depictions of suffering. I will never give money to charities that force such distressing imagery into my eyeballs. I sat through the Viking cruise ads, the extended infomercials for white elephant pressure washers, various lotteries, taps that deliver scalding water, and of course the Sponsored by Skoda messages.\n\nAt times it seems there is more advertising than there is Ned Boulting commentary, but still, watching the Tour is my happy place. Usually, it starts while we’re still at work but by the time it ends, I’m in France. Don’t think that’s working out this time. It has been a forty! week! school! year! and my OH has to do a cruel and unusual extra couple of days more than me. So we’ll be limping our way to France after the cycling finishes in Nice.\n\nStill, the 21-stage race nicely coincides with my own final 21 stages. My last working day will coincide with Stage 19, Embrun to Isola 2000, a resort with a weird name (it’s at 2000 metres) in the Alpes Maritimes.\n\nIt feels a bit bad to be wishing my life away like this, but you can’t help it. Even in a year you’re not retiring, the end of term can’t come soon enough. Everybody is done, lots of people are completely checked out, and those that aren’t are already thinking about September. So, deep breath, wind the clock. Tick tock.\n\nNow we’ve seen all eight episodes of Ncuti Gatwa’s first season in the role, in the new Disney+ era to boot, I thought it worth looking back and seeing how Year Zero went.\n\nAlways remembering that it is not really for me, then…\n\nI’m fine with almost everything. Ncuti Gatwa is great, full of energy and emotion, and managing to conjure up the essence of the Doctor while adding new layers. Maybe a few too many tears. I’m fine with almost all of the two-fingers-to-the-fandom stuff. By all accounts, the Doctor Who fandom is the most toxic of them all. My only real exposure to the negativity is through reading a few comments on the Guardian recaps. There are always people who pop up to complain about how terrible it is, and there are at least two levels to the wondering why they bother. In terms of the sexist, racist, homophobic, anti-trans elements, I think they can consider themselves thoroughly trolled.\n\nIf they’re still watching (and complaining) after all that, then you have to wonder how thick they really are. Like billionaires who promise to leave the country if Labour wins an election, you just want to help them pack. Some Guardian commenters have started trolling them (when they say something about being done with the show and never watching it again) with, “Can I have your stuff?”\n\nCan I help you pack?\n\nWe all always have the choice not to watch, not to engage, and not to think about it. I still watch because I’ve been watching it – give or take the Colin Baker / Sylvester McCoy years – all my life. The show is a little bit younger than me. I quite enjoy watching it but my level of engagement is surprisingly low (of which more below).\n\nThe one thing about Doctor Who that I’ve never really been fine with — and this is going back decades — is its lack of storytelling rigour. Of all the loosely-related-to-genre shows, it’s the one that refuses to have rules. Which: whatever, but I’ve always been of the opinion that storytelling is better, more creative, more thought-provoking, if it takes place in a rules-based universe. With hard science fiction, you’re talking about the fundamental laws of physics (or at least contemporary understanding of what they might be); when it comes to fantasy, even in worlds of magic and the supernatural, having rules always makes for better stories. Like, if there’s magic, it should cost you something to use it; if you bring something back to life, something else has to die. That kind of thing. But the thing about Who is that the only consistent thing about it – for 60 years – is that it refuses to be consistent.\n\nThis is something for me to get over, and I know it doesn’t bother other people as much as it bothers me. But I think we’ve lived in this Peak-TV world, this Platinum Age of television, for so long now that there’s really no excuse for skipping over the difficulties in a script. The writer’s job is to make it work, and whether it’s The X Files, or Buffy, The Magicians, Travelers, The Expanse, Stargate Universe or Strange New Worlds, the best genre writing avoids the hand waving and gets into it.\n\nAnd this major flaw at the heart of Doctor Who has come up a lot in this first Disney+/BBC season. The amount of hand waving in the finale was so extreme, they might as well have included a giant Reset button.\n\nThe other thing I’ve got very little time for is the fan service. And I find it odd, in this latest RTD era that there is both two fingers held up to the fandom and arcane references to the show’s past that only those fans get or care about. I have generally only watched each episode once. I forget most of it immediately. I know the order the Doctors came in, but I have no idea what most of the individual episodes or serials were called. In the wilderness years, I never kept up with the magazines, the fandom, the books, the audio serials, and I really don’t think any of that early stuff stands up to rewatching — unless it’s to chortle at the shonkiness of it all.\n\nOne more thing, before I get into individual episodes. How strange, how bizarre, to fanfare a new Doctor actor and give it so much of a push only to cut the season down to eight episodes—and to have him disappear for most of one, and stand still for most of another — and another. The audience barely gets a chance to get used to this new era and it’s gone.\n\n(I’m just going to write about the recent eight, and not go back to the Christmas special.)\n\nSpace Babies\n\nAs previously noted, this was silly but fun. It followed a lot of familiar beats as a season opener. It’s premise was utterly ridiculous, and probably the first example of hanging a lampshade on the idea that the showrunner doesn’t care what long terms fans think. This episode was calibrated to appeal to the very young and make anyone older than, say, ten, feel not even faintly embarrassed to be watching. My rating: 6/10\n\nThe Devil’s Chord\n\nAlso as previously noted, this episode made a number of mistakes that seem almost perverse. The casting of the Beatles was awful; the musical number at the end was provocatively bad; the production design merely gestured towards historical accuracy. Fine. We know where we stand. If nothing else, it created some good imagery for the season trailer. Personally, I found the villain, The Maestro, irritating. Which is an odd thing to say about a villain, for whom the baseline should be irritating. But it was all too Musical Theatre for me, and did not bear comparison to Sweet, the antagonist of the Buffy musical episode. I don’t have a camp sensibility, I just find it grating. My rating: 4/10\n\nBoom\n\nThe Doctor waltzes blithely out of the Tardis, in the middle of an obviously war-torn landscape, and steps on a landmine. Remember the days when the Doctor would cautiously look at the viewscreen inside the Tardis, making an assessment of the conditions outside? You probably don’t. Apart from that eye-rolling detail, this was a solid bottle episode, a high concept idea that worked pretty well, and worked in some reminders of Ruby Sunday weirdness. My rating 8/10\n\n73 Yards\n\nHere we go. As mentioned above, Ncuti Gatwa is the new Doctor, this is the new season, the first to be on Disney+, big hype! So let’s have an episode without him. Regardless of the quality of the episode, which was decent, it seems an odd decision. Also odd was to sequence this one immediately after the one before. Because what happens? Instead of checking conditions outside the Tardis and proceeding with caution, as he should have done last week, he blithely steps out of the Tardis and into a… fairy ring? A kind of supernatural land mine. Anyway, the show isn’t really interested in this ring, or why it’s there, or how it works. Cf. my comments above about the “no rules” vibe of Doctor Who. Another show would be interested in all of the fairy ring lore and laws and woulds have written a brilliant episode about it. Doctor Who doesn’t care. Anyway, the Doctor is gone, so we get one of the character-lives-an-entire-lifetime episodes, which are always good. They’ve done it in Doctor Who before, and it was done in Star Trek: The Next Generation and The Magicians, and many others I’m sure. Anyway, Ruby lives out her life haunted by a woman standing 73 yards away. Or just under 67 metres. The ending is neat, but the other detail that the writers don’t care about is what could this woman possibly be saying to the people who approach her? Because they all run away screaming, or change their attitude towards Ruby in a negative way. But instead of writing the lines, they just leave it hanging. Which, I know, a lot of people don’t mind at all. But for me, it’s just yet another example of the lazy, lackadaisical writing you get on Doctor Who. A better show would have the writers come up with something. My genuine belief is that, not only do they not care what the woman was saying, but they don’t have a clue. My rating 7/10.\n\nDot and Bubble\n\nThis was a good one, although the production design didn’t look like Doctor Who at all. On the one hand, a satire about social media bubbles. On the other a story about class and race with a sting in the tale. I was alerted early on, when the protagonist, Lindy Pepper-Bean, blocked the Doctor on her socials account very very quickly, but did not block Ruby, who was saying similar things. It was subtle, but it was there. And then the episode ended with a ship of bigots heading off to almost certain death rather than share space with a person of colour. I think the Doctor was the only one crying over them, however. He does cry a lot, and I don’t think these people deserved his tears. By the way, another Doctor Lite episode, in the sense that he spends most of the episode in a video chat window with a plain background. So much for the much vaunted Disney budget. My rating 9/10\n\nRogue\n\nThis was okay, but felt like a retread. Once again, I found myself asking where all the Disney money was, because the costumes/make-up were very Farscape. Which was Muppets in Space, if you remember. This season really has revisited some familiar beats, and for me, this episode did not compare well with The Girl in the Fireplace, which was set in a similar era. But we were reminded a lot of Captain Jack Harkness from earlier seasons (and Torchwood) the difference being that the Doctor was less backward in coming forward. Anyway, it was all okay, but suffered a bit from the we-don’t-care-about-rules syndrome. There was a lot of telling as opposed to showing. Some people have complained especially about the end, where Ruby, who cannot move, is moved/saved by the Rogue character. I was actually okay with it, though, on the basis that he replaced her weight on the transport pad thing with his, like Indiana Jones with his sack of sand. The Doctor clearly wasn’t willing to sacrifice himself to save Ruby, which seems a bit out of character. In the end, as with many of the episodes, the plotting seemed peremptory and half-baked because this is a show that doesn’t care about rules, or consistency, or indeed plot. My rating 7/10\n\nThe Legend of Ruby Sunday\n\nAnd so we reach part one of the season finale, which has come up very quickly this time. And what are we doing watching it in June, when a Doctor Who season should start in October and finish at Christmas? Anyway, here is where all the RTD tropes come home to roost. Get everybody on board, too many characters, throw in too many ideas, fail to follow anything through, and bring back a Big Bad from 1975, or something. I had no memory of this particular Big Bad, or the episode in which it featured. (Pyramids of Mars is the third serial of the 13th season of Old Who, it says here.) I was twelve when it was on, and it’s only because I listen to podcasts and read the Guardian recap that I even knew it was a reference. Anyway, this seemed like a typical RTD finale setup, in that it was too busy and too bombastic, and too messy, and too hyped. There was a nice little mystery plot about Ruby’s origins, and a clever bit of technology for turning old VHS tape into a sensorama surround experience. But then this all gets derailed by a big bad smoke monster. And if this big bad is so bad, why is it wasting time playing games with Susan Triad appearances and anagrams? And why is UNIT employing children? I don’t get it. My rating: 6/10\n\nEmpire of Death\n\nThe end. The problem of too-many-people-on-screen was dealt with quickly by killing them all off… which immediately told the viewer that there would be a big Reset button at some point. In between the two halves of the finale, I watched Pyramids of Mars. Turns out that I’d watched it not that long ago, but had no memory of what it was called. Mainly because the title bears nearly no relation to the contents of the episodes, which take place mainly on Earth, in 1911. Anyway, why RTD picked on this Sutekh monster is beyond me. I guess that’s why he runs a popular TV show and I sit at home complaining about it. Maybe he briefed himself to look for villains and monsters that hadn’t been used multiple times. In which case, well done. It was a relief to have a series with no Daleks and no Cybermen, so bringing back obscure one-off villains (like the Toymaker and Sutekh) is a decent idea. Or you could, you know, invent some new ones. But beyond that, I could see no significance. Pyramids of Mars wasn’t up to much, and nor was this. There was a strange interlude after which everything was destroyed, during which the Doctor talks to a woman who can’t remember anything and she gives him a spoon. It was like something out of a different story, just dropped into the middle. And then when they’d dealt with Sutekh (the usual hand waving), the mystery of Ruby’s mother was ‘solved’ but in a very unconvincing way. For example, why a scared 15-year-old girl who has just had a baby is wearing the cloak out of The Traitors is not explained. More hand waving. My rating: 4/10\n\nAnyway. I’m not going to stop watching. It’s fine. The show has always been both good and bad in equal measure. It’s current iteration offers the usual mix of inspiration and desperation. I have to admit, I don’t get why RTD is considered to be such a great writer. Bless him for reviving Doctor Who in the first place, but there is never anything substantial behind all the bombast. He’s very good at hype, and he’s already hyping the next season, but there’s a huge credibility gap between his hype and the execution.\n\nDoctor Who is loud music, flashing lights, and running up and down corridors, and always has been. But any number of other genre shows have shown by now that you can produce episodes of television with style and substance. I happened to finish watching Stargate Atlantis on the night “The Legend of Ruby Sunday” aired, and it was so telling. Here was a mid-budget Canadian science fiction show doing an episode that played with CSI tropes, throwing familiar characters into a random genre, and yet managing to tell a story that fitted in with the other 99 episodes quite effectively. And that’s the thing about Who: it so very nearly manages to be good, but always swerves towards the bad.\n\nI’ve been burning my way through the other Stargate show, Atlantis. I’ve previously written (several times) about the late, great Stargate Universe. If you don’t know these shows, it might be hard to get your head around the idea that someone might deeply love a spin-off while not being terribly interested in the original. It would be like loving Angel, but not liking Buffy.\n\nBut the clever thing about this particular franchise is that they managed to give all of their shows a different vibe. And as a space opera, Universe is even a very different genre than the other two.\n\nSo I’ve been thinking for a few days about writing something about Atlantis, and I almost didn’t because it feels a little bit embarrassing. Possibly because the premise of this spinoff seems just a little bit sillier than the original. It’s clearly a cheaper show, with some shonky special effects and special makeup effects. But the joy of it lies in the cast of characters, and there’s something appealing about the cast of actors, many of whom are quite familiar from other science fiction franchises and mid-budget Canadian science fiction shows. The other thing to say about it, as science fiction, is that it does establish rules and stick with them. Wormhole technology may only be theoretical, but the fact that the writing team establishes a set of possibilities and impossibilities is part of the entertainment. We’ll be having words about the lack of rules in Doctor Who in a couple of week’s time.\n\nThe original series, SG1 is by now the one I’m least familiar with. Needless to say, it’s a military science fiction show about a network of linked wormhole devices known as Stargates. There’s lots of conflict with other alien races and (it says here) references to Earth mythologies. You may recall that the original film was something to do with ancient Egypt and the pyramids.\n\nAtlantis is another military science fiction show, but it takes the cast away from a base on Earth and drops them in a different galaxy, in a city built by the ancient race who constructed the Stargate network and then disappeared. Like Universe, part of the show’s premise involves trying to understand the Ancients and their technology. But the Atlantis mission’s original archaeological/research purpose is derailed by the team’s inadvertent activation of a group of vampire-like aliens, the Wraith. The Wraith have been lying dormant, but they’re woken by the Atlantis explorers, who then get involved in a 5-year war of survival. The Wraith “feed” not by sucking blood, but by sucking the life force out of human beings.\n\nBut really they’re vampires. So this franchise in particular is a little like the Scooby Gang in space. Buffy with space portals. It’s fun.\n\nThe scripts tend to be light and witty, though not quite managing Whedon levels of banter. But banter the actors do. Genius scientist Rodney McKay (David Hewlett) whines and moans but also achieves feats of technological brilliance to save the day over and over again. John Sheppard (Joe Flanagan) is the slightly louche and sardonic military flyer, who has an important genetic marker that allows him to control Ancient tech. Teyla Emmagan (Rachel Luttrell) is a Pegasus Galaxy native, one of those whose lives were upended when the Stargate people woke the Wraith. She joins the team and represents the high-kicking Buffy type.\n\nA more problematic member of the cast was Torri Higginson as lead researcher Elizabeth Weir. The problem with her was that she was meant to be the leader, but the team (and show) got sidetracked by the Wraith, and there just wasn’t enough for her to do. Her role was to look stern and tell people to be careful. She didn’t go on missions through the local gate, and it really seemed as if the scriptwriters didn’t know what to do with her. After three of the five seasons, her role was much reduced, and she was eventually so gone that they couldn’t even get the actor back for one last episode in season 5 to wrap up her story.\n\nShe was replaced, for one season, by Amanda Tapping from the original show, who was more action oriented. But then even she was replaced by Robert Picardo, Star Trek’s famous hologram doctor. What is the nature of the medical emergency. His role was to look stern and tell people to follow the rules.\n\nThere are two other cast members who make Atlantis worth watching. The first (from season 2 onwards) is a pre-Game of Thrones Jason Momoa as Ronon Dex. Yes, Aquaman himself, in Atlantis. He plays another local, this one captured and released by the Wraith as a “runner”, to be hunted through the stargates and across planets. The people from Earth disable his tracker and add him to the team. So he ends up being the Angel to Rachel Luttrell’s Buffy.\n\nFinally, someone from the actual Whedonverse joins the series in season 3 and stays to the end: Jewel Staite, as Doctor Jennifer Keller, is there for all your Secret Girlfriend needs. One of the odd things about this filmed-in-Canada franchise is that the same actors appear across (sometimes) all three versions, playing different parts. A Runner from season 5 is also one of the Lucian Alliance in Universe. Jewel Staite appeared in an early episode of Atlantis as a “tamed” Wraith before showing up again as the team’s doctor later on.\n\nIt’s low budget, formulaic, and I would never put it up against the best of the best. It doesn’t have the wit and heart of Buffy, the intrigue of The X Files, the soul of Travelers. But it is witty and engaging and it’s more entertaining than quite a lot of the new stuff being released at this arse end of the television year. And there’s enough star quality to keep you watching.\n\nAbsolutely massive spoilers ahead for this Apple TV+ show, which relies heavily upon a twist.\n\nHere’s the thing about twists.\n\nIf you’re going to use one, then it had better be a good one. It had better be so good that it makes the viewer want to go back and rewatch everything before the twist and view it in a new light.\n\nWhen you study genre, you learn something about the relationship between producers and audiences. A genre is a kind of bargain, an agreement between creator and audience. The audience will love it if you do it right. If you do it wrong, they will feel cheated. One of the worst tricks you can play — one which shows contempt for your audience — is to pretend to be one genre while really being another. Especially if it turns out that you appear have no interest in either genre. If it turns out to be that your main schtick is contempt for the audience.\n\nThe Guardian forewarned us about Sugar, suggesting in its two-star review that the (unearned) twist would infuriate more people than it pleased. Knowing there was a twist, therefore, I watched with slightly more cynical eyes than I might have done. In fact, the only reason I kept watching was because I knew there would be a twist, and I was curious to see what it was. More on that below.\n\nBut had I not known about the twist, I’d have given up after one episode, or two at the most. Because it’s terrible. The script is lacklustre, the plot is nothing special, the performances forgettable. Woman is kidnapped. Private detective hired to find her. Woman is rescued. One of the perps turns out to be known to the detective. (I told you there would be spoilers.) Detective feels sad. The plot beats feel well trodden, with passing references to Chinatown, Blade Runner, and other noirs, neo- and otherwise. There are interstitial clips from famous films. Muted trumpet, Los Angeles, easily disarmed hoods. Voiceover.\n\nThe presence of a voiceover with a so-called Neo-Noir is a conundrum, because you can’t be sure whether its there for the right reason (stylistic, and done well) or the wrong reason (to patch holes in an otherwise incomprehensible or pointless narrative plot — or because the studio suits insisted on it). I’m here to tell you that right-reason voiceovers are vanishingly rare. If “the most baffling movie ever made” – Bogart’s The Big Sleep – didn’t have one, then nothing needs one. Not Blade Runner, and certainly not Sugar.\n\nAccording to Alec Worley, there are five types of twist ending.\n\nType one is reversal of identity: someone turns out to be someone else.\n\nThat just about sums up Sugar. The detective, played by Colin Farrell, turns out to be someone else. Forewarned about the twist, I guessed robot, but it turned out to be alien. But it makes no difference, because it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t make you want to go back and review and rewatch. There were plenty of oddnesses, but they weren’t interesting. The whole situation felt unlikely. They want you to feel it’s a Type three (reversal of perception) but you just feel bored.\n\nThe show has absolutely no interest in this group of aliens or their mission. Desultory conversations, vague plans to return to their home planet. They try to convey a sense of urgency but the pacing of the show undermines it, as Colin Farrell seems to have unlimited time to do what he wants. But the show also has no real interest in its serial killer or his victims, no interest in the “solution” to its film noir mystery plot, no interest in its science fiction elements. Which is why the twist comes so late on. They’re not willing to spend the money on hair, make-up or special effects, so Colin Farrell and all of the others will appear to be human most of the time.\n\nDavid Thomson’s novel Suspects explored the world of film noir and suggested links between characters and plots by taking characters from well known films and placing them together in a separate plot. A biographical dictionary becomes a novel. The darkness at the heart of the best noirs comes off the page and into the heart of the reader. And the twist is a very dark twist indeed that leaves the reader feeling broken and bereft rather than cheated of their time. I mention Suspects because it seemed to me that Sugar wanted to be something like Suspects but didn’t have the intellect or the work ethic. It ends up being a lazy rehash of old ideas burdened by the wrong kind of narrative twist.\n\nI watched a couple of new things on TV this week, as well as the one very old thing that I always have opinions about.\n\nFirst of all, Shardlake on Disney+. I’ve heard some of the radio adaptations of this on BBC Sounds. It never grabbed me, as an historical detective drama, in the way that both Falco and Cadfael did. But I was prepared to give it a chance on TV. Should I be surprised that one of the leading roles was played by Irish actor Anthony Boyle? He was in Masters of the Air and also played John Wilkes Booth in Manhunt (both on Apple TV+). Anyway, he’s having a hot career streak, because he’s playing sort-of sidekick Jack Barak in Shardlake. Which is fine. Historical detective in the time of the tyrant King Henry VIII. You’re getting Name of the Rose vibes, which is also fine, but structurally it has the problem that there is absolutely no chance that anybody will ever turn a light on. So dark screens ahoy, which means I’m mainly treating it as radio, with the occasional look up at the screen.\n\nI also watched one episode of Dark Matter, Apple TV+, which is a parallel universe tale based on the many worlds theory of quantum mechanics. Hand wave away the science, and we have a high school physics teacher kidnapped – for some reason – by his more (scientifically) successful self from another universe. Episode two is waiting in the wings, but I was not so grabbed that I went for it immediately. In fact, it says a lot that I would rather (re)watch old Stargate Atlantis episodes than bother with this one.\n\nWhich brings me, finally, to yet another iteration of “new” Doctor Who, the start proper of Ncuti Gatwa’s first season in the role. The first episode, Space Babies, was clearly riffing on some of the early Billie Piper episodes, with the Tardis appearing on a space station in the far future. Looking out from a viewing platform, “fixing” a mobile phone so new companion Ruby (Millie Gibson) can call her mum. Look at the echo: Rose has become Ruby; Billie has become Millie.\n\nAnyway, a supremely silly episode, reminding crusty old fans that this is a show for, you know, the kids, so there were talking babies and a snot monster.\n\nNcuti Gatwa seems great in the role, full of energy and fun, and giving a performance full of handbrake turns and gear shifts. All of which was evident in the second episode, Space Beatles, or The Devil’s Chord, which was surely the episode most freighted with expectations.\n\nTurning up at Abbey Road (then simply known as EMI Recording Studios) in 1963 as the Beatles are recording their first album, the Doctor and Ruby discover that something has gone wrong with music. This was a neat way around the problem of paying for the global rights to a Beatles number, I guess.\n\nBut, as one of the podcasters said, if you’re going to use the Beatles as characters, you’ve got to make it mean something. And it didn’t. Without using a Beatles song, or even a Beatles chord, the show simply threw away their Special Historical Guest Stars. This was no Van Gogh episode (Vincent and the Doctor).\n\nThe casting seemed like it was deliberately awful. As if the casting director had been shown a cartoon of the Beatles drawn by a dog. As if to send the message, don’t expect us to be taking this seriously.\n\nListen, I’m completely on board with Russel T Davies’ tendency to stick two fingers up to the fandom. Good for him. But of course, being on the receiving end of the two fingers feels slightly different. I can’t stand hypocrisy, but I’m always prepared to make an exception in my own case. Anyway, two fingers up to Beatles fans wanting verisimilitude was what we got. The wrong-era VW Beetle parked on Abbey Road; the “sixties” fashions that were a little beyond what 1963 had to offer; Beatles who didn’t look like Beatles; John Lennon glasses that must have had their own Tardis. Which is before you get to the non-use of Beatles music, or even a single Beatles chord. The plot hinged on a chord (it’s in the title) and the Beatles, famously, had two world shattering chords in their historical repertoire. But no.\n\nBut all of that is fine. Two fingers to fandom, whatever.\n\nAnd I absolutely loved the non-diegetic music joke. Excellent. Top marks.\n\nWhat was unforgivable was the song and dance number at the end.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with a musical episode. I have watched and loved musical episodes from Buffy, The Magicians, and even Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with a breakout extra-diegetic song and dance sequence.\n\nBut there was something wrong with this one. It was terrible. From the opening lines, sung by the Doctor, both lyrics and music were just wrong. It was bad. It was so bad but everyone was dancing as if it was a brilliant, show-stopping, feel-good musical number. But it was just bad, bad, bad. Bad lyrics, bad tune.\n\nIf the Beatles had been cast by someone who had simply heard a rumour about a sketch by a dog of the Beatles, this was a song written by someone who grew up in that other, parallel world, the one where music had gone wrong.\n\nIn other words, no sooner had the world been put right by the playing of the (absolutely unexceptional) magic chord than we got the breakout song and dance sequence from the bad world. Nothing had been put right, after all. That was the twist.\n\nI didn’t see no aurora. When it comes to it, it turns out, I am too lazy to get up and go outside to look. You have no idea how disappointed I am in myself.\n\nCouple of bike rides this weekend. Regular trainers, using the flat side of my two-sided pedals, and no padded shorts. As a result, very little foot pain: using cleats means an aching foot within 30 minutes. But some soreness around the saddle area on the second ride. I will take this under advisement.\n\nThis came on during the first of these two rides:\n\nA track so obscure that it has been on YouTube for five years and has (as of today) 291 views. Nobody will take my word for it, but it’s a really good track. And I genuinely think the guitar solo on it is absolutely fucking brilliant. Raises the heart rate. It’s my absolute favourite guitar solo, give or take the one on Let it Be (album version).\n\nSpeaking of Let it Be. I watched the remastered version on Disney+ and it is really good. It genuinely is nothing like the film that is written about in all the books. That reassessment is partly driven by the Get Back context, but also is a reaffirmation of the opinion I expressed when I wrote about it on here before. Five years ago, I confirmed that it’s not that bad, and there are only a couple of awkward moments. I stand by that, though the second awkward moment is less awkward in Get Back hindsight.\n\nIt’s a fascinating watch. There’s no context. No mention of torchlit arabs. No George walkout. There’s virtually no discussion. It’s mostly music. The rooftop concert just happens, no reason given. The Beatles still look nothing like the rest of London in 1969. The film looks and sounds great, and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with it. As I said to a friend, every single book that claimed Let it Be was miserable and the Beatles were breaking up in front of our eyes needs to be pulped.\n\nNot much happening on Apple TV+ at the moment. Their two historical dramas, Franklin and Manhunt didn’t grab me. Just didn’t zing off the screen, and the two of them being released so close together was odd. I watched two episodes of Manhunt (about the search for the assassin of Abraham Lincoln) before giving up. I felt in the end that the use of anachronisms (the characters really speak like they’re in The Fugitive) didn’t really work. As to Franklin, it has a starry cast, but as many critics have noted, the story is simply not one of the more interesting from Franklin’s life. Also, I hate watching stuff set in the era of candlelight and oil lamps. The modern trend towards darkness on screens continues.\n\nStar Trek Discovery (Paramount+) is about halfway through its final season. It remains watchable, in its touchy feely way. I think this season’s Maguffin plot is a bit lightweight, but it’s nice to spend time with these characters one last time. It’s not Strange New Worlds, but it’s Star Trek, so I’ll watch.\n\nTalking of Maguffins, I watched (on Paramount+) the most recent Mission Impossible film, Dead Reckoning. For a start, a totally meaningless title. Plot concerns a runaway AI called The Entity, and the Maguffin is some key that unlocks some secret system in a sunken Russian submarine. A spectacular if unlikely chase sequence in Rome tries hard to best the one in The Bourne Identity and fails. The film is ridiculously long, considering it doesn’t have much of a plot, a sin compounded by the lack of a proper ending (there’s another episode in the pipeline).\n\nQuestions remain about the silly rubber masks that they wear. I have forgotten if there was ever an explanation for how they manage to change their voices? And I’m unclear on how height works. How does the quite short Cruise character suddenly become a regular height person? And forgive me for noticing Hayley Atwell’s figure, but how does she pass for a different woman with that rack?\n\nAnyway, the final hour of the film takes place, for some reason, on a steam train in the Alps. And I’m sure 90% of the audience is aware that a steam train needs to be fed fuel and water to keep working. So how this train then manages to become a “runaway” train for 50 minutes is impossible to explain. So I’m assuming that, like me, 90% of the audience was done with the film for the last third of it.\n\nQuite the best thing on lately has been The Red King (Alibi/Now), created by Toby Whitehouse, who has a good track record including The Game and Being Human. Detective Grace Narayan (Anjli Mohindra) is ostracised out of her job onto a remote island where the locals like wearing horrific folk masks and frighten tourists with tales of an old religion called The True Way. On the island, she immediately clashes with the local ways and reopens a missing persons investigation against everybody’s wishes. When a body turns up, she looks righteous, but events spiral out of control when a plot device storm cuts the island off from the mainland.\n\nUsually, when Sky or ITV or the Beeb gives you six episodes of something you get a strong first episode or two, then a saggy dip while the show is padded for length, and then an ending that makes you wish you hadn’t bothered. Not so this. The dialogue is witty, the characters engaging, and the island keeps throwing up new problems and mysteries. Grace doesn’t (cannot) know who to trust, and the Wicker Man vibes are handled just differently enough that you don’t think the whole thing is a rip off. My favourite character was Winter Bain, played by Maeve Courtier-Lilley, who keeps her performance floating somewhere between young-woman-with-a-crush and witchy island waif. And so it is with many of the supporting cast, who one minute seem as if they might be the voice of reason, but the next appear to be part of the general island derangement.\n\nAnyway, it’s good stuff, and I burned through the whole lot over a couple of nights."
