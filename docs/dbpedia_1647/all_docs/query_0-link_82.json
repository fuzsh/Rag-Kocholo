I was drawn to these programmes by the appeal of the raw footage, which looked so different from the slick sitcoms, dramas and even newscasts on other channels. I was drawn, too, by the counter-intuitive appeal of slow-paced, trivial, repetitive events screened on television, where every minute is worth a small fortune and ‘dead time’ is anathema. When, I asked myself, had tedium on the small screen become compulsive viewing? In 2000, I joined the ranks of viewers the world over who were glued nightly to the first season of Big Brother (1999–). Despite the different premise and viewing experience of Big Brother, this show struck me as a continuation of the techniques from Cops and America’s Funniest Home Videos. The camerawork and the unrehearsed performances of people engaging with the trivia of everyday life made the link seem obvious. Reality TV innovations since then – and there have been too many to count – have similarly been absorbed into the programming slipstream they have helped to create, even though now there is probably not a single feature that is shared by all of the programmes which fall under the rubric of ‘reality TV’. As I write, the TV discussion sites and review pages are abuzz with debates about Jersey Shore (2009–) on MTV and My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding (2010–) on Channel 4 in Britain. As hyperbolic representations of social and personal identity, these two very different programmes probably have something in common, but it is far less clear how they link back to the mundanity of a show like Cops. Even in the current environment of 2011/12, it is difficult to articulate the connections among programmes like Jersey Shore, which is a Real World (1992–) offshoot for Italian American youths; My Big Fat Gypsy 1\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 1\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\n2\n\nREALITY TV\n\nWedding, which is a sociological series about marriage rituals amongst Britain’s traveller communities; Who Do You Think You Are? (2004–), which is a genealogy series that traces the family tree of celebrities; Tabatha’s Salon Takeover (2008–), which is a makeover series helmed by an Australian hairstyling diva; and the popular American Idol (2002–)/ MasterChef (1990–2001; 2005–)/Project Runway (2004–) talent quests. There also seems little to connect the humdrum aesthetic of a programme like 16 and Pregnant (2009–), an MTV observational series about pregnant teens, with the VH1 celebrity mini-industry that began with The Surreal Life (2003–6) and led to the rapper/rocker dating shows Flavor of Love (2006–8) and Rock of Love (2007–9), the spin-off etiquette programme Charm School (2007–9) and the catch-all hybrid I Love Money (2008–10), which collects together D-list denizens of the previous programmes to squabble in a shared house while competing for cash. All of these programmes are regularly referred to by viewers, commentators and industry professionals as ‘reality TV’, yet the framework that allows them to be grouped together is less than obvious. Despite its generic haziness, one cannot overestimate the impact of reality TV. In just two decades, it has transformed programming schedules, branded satellite and digital channels, created a celebrity industry in its own right and turned viewers into savvy readers of – not to mention potential participants in – the mechanics of television production. Some critics have gone so far as to declare that reality TV has ‘remade’ television culture (Murray and Ouellette 2004). Yet, despite the wide circulation of the term ‘reality TV’ and its comparatively short tenure on our screens, its genre status, cultural significance and even history are all heavily contested. On the one hand, programmers, viewers and commentators use the term in full confidence that they will be understood, whether it is meant as an industry pitch, a statement of viewing preference, a marketing tool or the topic of a university course. On the other hand, there is confusion about what constitutes and delimits ‘reality television’ as a grouping or genre, in part because of its format hybridity and in part as a result of the sheer volume and changing nature of the programmes themselves. As a populist form, moreover, reality TV sits at the intersection of numerous extra-televisual discourses, from trade magazines, viewing guides and official websites, to the tabloid press, unofficial webpages and television discussion forums. Reality TV thus does not just consist of programme texts but also of the entire discursive field that surrounds them. This discursive field now includes a considerable amount of\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 2\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\nWHAT IS REALITY TV ?\n\n3\n\nacademic scholarship. Key areas of study to date have focused on reality television’s associations with documentary, its hybridisation of fictional and factual programme styles, its intersection with everyday life and ordinary people, its representation of social identities (such as gender, sexuality, class, ethnicity and race), and its participation in the production of makeover culture as well as media celebrity. Of these areas, the study of reality television’s relation to documentary film and realism was the earliest and most influential academic approach, especially in the British television context (Biressi and Nunn 2005: 1). From the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, as the phrases ‘reality TV’ and ‘docudrama’ began to enter the academic lexicon, scholars defined reality TV as a televisual form that blurs traditional distinctions between information and entertainment, documentary and drama, public and private discourses (Kilborn 1994; Nichols 1994; Bondebjerg 1996). Focusing on the crime/emergency programmes and docusoaps of the 1990s, these studies framed their investigation of reality TV through concepts like realism, hyperreality and/or its claims to the ‘real’ (Friedman 2002; Cummings 2002). This often meant, however, that reality TV was positioned as documentary ‘lite’ and associated with the decline of public service television; it was considered to be either a cheap form of ‘trash TV’ aimed at entertaining the masses or a postmodern ‘nightmare’ that took hybridisation and surveillance technology too far (Dovey 2000: 83). While John Corner has consistently argued that the legacy of documentary is still at work in reality TV, albeit in revised form (2000, 2002), this legacy has also meant that reality TV continues to be judged as either ‘dumbed-down’ television or ‘lowest-common denominator’ programming which presents nothing of social value. With the appearance of the highly popular Big Brother in 1999/2000 and the introduction of fabricated competitive environments to reality TV, other scholarly approaches and methods began to be applicable. Reality TV became an important site of discussion for scholars of surveillance culture (Andrejevic 2004) as well as those interested in the relation between television and everyday life (Bonner 2003), and public and private spheres (van Zoonen 2004). Big Brother further led to the first sustained audience and fan studies of reality TV (Hill 2002, 2005; Jones 2003) as well as industry analyses (Ritchie 2000) and studies of the intersection between television and new media (Jones 2004). Since Big Brother the rise of competition programmes as well as shows that promise self-improvement for ordinary people has meant a growing critical interest in the interventionist role of reality TV, from DIY programmes to the parenting and lifestyle shows\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 3\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\n4\n\nREALITY TV\n\nthat appear to teach audiences how to better manage themselves (Ouellette and Hay 2008). Although reality television’s many detractors remain, within academic scholarship as well as among public commentators, the tendency in recent years has been to study reality TV from the perspective of its continuing popularity rather than condemning its populism: critics now ask which forms of reality TV appeal to viewers in which contexts, how reality TV intersects with a multitude of social discourses, and what role particular programmes play in helping viewers to negotiate the social, political and technological forces that shape their lives. In keeping with this attitude, this book will not seek to assess the value of reality TV in comparison with other genres or media forms. Rather, I wish to investigate reality TV on its own terms, as a form whose stubborn ability to renew and extend itself indicates just how well integrated it has become into contemporary social structures. This book does not attempt to subscribe to any one method or perspective for studying reality TV but rather to include the range of critical approaches as part of its broader discursive context. I aim to navigate a path through this rich territory by tracing reality TV as a textual, social and cultural formation with an entangled programming and critical history. If, as Jason Mittel has argued, ‘[g]enres operate in an ongoing historical process of category formation’ (2004: xiv), then the book offers a textured account of the rise and development of reality television in a way that ties genre to history and emphasises its cultural, industrial and conceptual contexts. To achieve this, I have chosen a methodology which I call genealogical, in recognition of Foucault’s understanding of genealogy as a way of ‘doing’ history that does not involve finding singular stories with a beginning, a middle and an end. Given the sheer number of reality TV programmes and the continuing shifts in format styles as producers in various contexts try to predict and outpace audience tastes, no traditionally chronological history could cover such diversity, nor explain reality TV in terms of a single origin. Thus, the genealogical method I have selected seeks to trace multiple origins, intersections and resemblances among reality TV forms. Adapting Foucault’s genealogical method to genre studies, this book maps structural connections as well as key conceptual shifts by breaking reality television into three ‘generations’ based on discursive resemblances, namely, the camcorder generation, the competition generation and the celebrity generation. To answer the tricky question ‘what is reality TV’, the book will work through its more complex variant: how do we find order in such a diverse, protean yet omnipresent array of programmes?\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 4\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\nWHAT IS REALITY TV ?\n\n5\n\nSo what is reality television? If there is a simple definition of reality television then we might say that the term refers to unscripted shows with non-professional actors being observed by cameras in preconfigured environments. The immediate temptation, however, is to think of exceptions to this rule, so the simple definition is quickly revealed to be reductive. A more complex definition might seek to supplement the internal features of reality TV texts with information about the critical discourses and cultural economies in which they are embedded. In this view, reality television is associated with low production values, high emotions, cheap antics and questionable ethics because it is ‘an unabashedly commercial’ form that mixes the serious traditions of documentary with the entertainment purpose of populist formats (Murray and Ouellette 2004: 2). While this is a more nuanced definition, it has little to say about the appeal of reality TV, or why this genre has had such an impact on the production, distribution and consumption patterns of television itself. Indeed, the cultural devaluation of reality television has more to do with the expectations associated with its genre label than with individual programmes, many of which their detractors will not even have watched. As I indicated above, the actual programmes that fall under the umbrella term ‘reality television’ are so highly differentiated as to make any definition quite tenuous. This, of course, poses problems for claiming its status as a singular TV genre. But to what extent is reality television an ‘it’? Unlike soap operas, sitcoms or even gameshows, which have a long history establishing their status as recognisable genres, reality TV is a relatively new genre. It can be traced back to the late 1980s, when reality crime shows appeared in the US, or to 1992, when The Real World appeared on MTV, or to 1999/2000, when Big Brother began to break ratings records. This uncertainty in mapping its origins reminds us that genres do not spring fully formed into cultural consciousness. Rather, there is a period of name-testing, categorising and recategorising before a genre becomes accepted by audiences, critics, programmers and broadcasters. The process has been made more difficult in the case of reality TV, however, because the one defining feature on which critics seem to agree is its generic hybridity, suggesting that reality TV shows have combined aspects of other television genres rather than inventing any of their own. This might lead us to question, as Jason Mittel puts it, whether reality TV can be considered ‘a full-fledged television genre’ (2004: 197). The E! channel, in contrast, has no such concerns. It is so confident that contemporary viewers know what to expect from\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 5\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\n6\n\nREALITY TV\n\nthe term that it now promises ‘more reality!’, not even needing to specify it as ‘reality TV’. So it seems that we face a quandary that is common to genre studies but is exacerbated in the case of reality TV: programmers and viewers know what reality TV is, while genre theorists encounter difficulties once they scratch the surface. There are no doubt recognisable, repeated cultural practices that have accrued around the term ‘reality TV’, involving viewing choices, programming schedules, production decisions and format sales. There are also numerous discourses that have become consolidated around these practices, such as the language of promotion and marketing, television reviews, viewer discussion boards and the idioms popularised by the shows themselves (e.g. ‘flying under the radar’). At the same time, the theoretical work of defining and grouping these programmes remains contentious. But this does not mean the work is not worth doing. In fact, twenty years on – at least according to my version of the history of reality TV – it may be time to stop and take stock. What do we mean when we call reality TV a genre, or treat it as one? Which shows do we include, and on what basis? And how do we think about the relationship between genre classifications, cultural practices and production histories in this broad group of shows? Genre and Genealogy Historically, the term ‘genre’ refers to texts which can be grouped together on the basis of shared characteristics. These shared attributes are traditionally considered to be integral to the texts themselves, which in turn provides the basis for defining a text according to its genre (e.g. a novel) and a genre according to its internal features (e.g. a single-authored fictional work of prose organised around characters and events). This notion of genre has been instrumental to the categorisation of texts within a range of established aesthetic forms, such as literature, theatre and film. Most critics now agree, however, that the definitional approach is too limited, since texts always operate within contexts of reception and production. Steve Neale, for instance, in his influential study of film genre, has insisted that the text-based understanding of genre be expanded to include ‘specific systems of expectation and hypothesis that spectators bring with them to the cinema’ (1990: 46), while Jane Feuer’s (1992) approach to the genre of sitcoms introduces historical contextualisation by analysing changing industrial and cultural conditions in the 1970s and 1980s. In television studies, however, there has been much debate about the\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 6\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\nWHAT IS REALITY TV ?\n\n7\n\napplicability of even contextualised notions of genre to the medium. While scholars in film studies have developed a sustained theorisation of genre, their counterparts in television studies have been less willing to do so. Addressing this relative lack, Laura Stempel-Mumford has argued that television’s adaptable formats and self-reflexive borrowings make it ‘resistant as a medium to the rigidity that [genre] categorizations are thought to require’ (1995: 20; original emphasis). John Fiske, however, has argued that television is a ‘highly generic’ medium (1987: 109), with genre classifications informing how television texts are placed in schedules and how they are read by audiences. For Fiske, this is not to deny the adaptability of television formats but to argue that audiences, producers and schedulers incorporate format fluidity into their use of generic designations. Against the backdrop of these debates, reality television has been treated either as the exception to the applicability of genre in television or as the exemplar of television genre itself. Because reality TV self-consciously and self-reflexively mixes generic forms (Holmes and Jermyn 2004: 6–7), this can be read either as its failure to fit the basic criteria of genre or as the grounds for considering it to be the definitive genre within an inherently adaptable medium. Mittel, tending toward the latter position, has noted that television itself ‘regularly mixes narrative and nonnarrative formats’ (2004: xiii), which would suggest that reality TV is working within the medium’s own traditions. This book will consider reality television to be exemplary of television genre owing to the ease with which it mixes fictional and documentary forms, soap operas and game shows, talkshows and advertising platforms – all without losing its legibility as ‘reality TV’. This does not mean, however, that reality television should be treated as a static genre whose features have already been canonised. On the contrary, the interest of this new form lies precisely in the rhythms of its emergence, consolidation and continuing development. Jason Mittel’s work on genre and television (2004) provides a helpful theoretical framework for tracing this emergence. For Mittel, television genres are first and foremost cultural constructions, and hence must be studied as ‘generic clusters’ that emerge through ‘discursive practices of definition, interpretation and evaluation’ (2004: 196). While these discursive practices appear to reflect on a given genre, as though the genre comes first and the talk about it second, Mittel argues that discourses are in fact ‘constitutive of that genre’ (2004: xiv). This argument shifts the focus from understanding television genre as a shared set of attributes to understanding it as a form that is ‘constantly in flux’ and hence always in a state of adapting formats, borrowing material\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 7\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\n8\n\nREALITY TV\n\nand moving on the next thing. Mittel’s approach proves doubly useful for the study of reality television. First, reality TV changes so quickly that flux is one of its key attributes, and hence any attempt to discuss it as a genre must incorporate its mutability rather than sidelining it as incidental to the form. Second, in my earlier musings about how to connect Cops with I Love Money, I ended up suggesting that there is not a single feature that is shared by all of the programmes which today circulate in the discursive category of ‘reality TV’. For a traditional or textual approach to genre, which seeks to distil a shared set of attributes, this would obviously be a problem. With an approach that understands genres to ‘operate in an ongoing historical process of category formation’ (Mittel 2004: xiv), however, the focus shifts from generic attributes to history. This book thus addresses reality TV as a genre from a historical perspective. In and of itself, I find this a useful task because the history of reality television has so far been told from partial perspectives, depending on the national viewing contexts of scholars and their chosen time frames as well as criteria. While I cannot make a claim to being able to cover all reality TV shows in every country they have appeared, I do attempt in this book to take a multi-national perspective, with a particular focus on innovations and influences arising in the US, UK, Europe and Australia/New Zealand. Addressing reality TV from a historical perspective, however, also raises a theoretical question about how to do history. Although this sounds like an impossibly grand question, I will again take my lead from Mittel, following his suggestion that Foucault’s historical model of genealogy is appropriate to studying genres as discursive formations (2004: 13). In his celebrated essay ‘Nietzsche, Genealogy, History’, Foucault argues that telling history should not involve a search for origins, since such a search ‘assumes the existence of immobile forms that precede the world of accident and succession’ (1984: 78). Although Foucault is talking about the historiography of world events, the method seems peculiarly applicable to television studies. If television genres are always in flux, as has been argued, then any method that assumes ‘immobile forms’ will fail to capture the conditions for their emergence. Thus, in order to grasp a history that accounts for accidents and detours and multiple origins and broken threads – such as have been the pathways of reality television – Foucault argues that one must take a genealogical approach. Resisting ‘ideal signification and indefinite teleologies’ (1984: 77), Foucauldian genealogy seeks to ‘record the singularity of events outside of any monotonous finality’ (1984: 76). Rejecting overarching narratives, it finds history in the twists and turns\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 8\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\nWHAT IS REALITY TV ?\n\n9\n\ntaken by particular elements rather than in neat arcs with a beginning, middle and end. A genealogy on this model is thus sensitive to ruptures in timelines as well as the co-existence of diverse forms; it looks for commonalities across related strands rather than attempting to map linear routes. In taking such an approach to reality TV, I will be collecting together the ‘micro-instances’ that constitute the ‘macro-account of a genre’s history from the bottom up’ (Mittel 2004: 14). The process will involve following different genealogical strands, allowing some continuities to be broken while paying attention to connections and interrelations among others. Rather than looking for a single origin, I will find numerous starting points for reality TV. In place of linear trajectories, I will highlight the socio-political contexts, cultural shifts, technological innovations and industrial practices that have contributed to the formation of reality TV as a genre. Chapter Overview The organising premise of this book is to begin ‘before’ reality TV, with televisual precedents which later reappear in the discourses of its production and reception. From there, I offer a classification that breaks reality TV down into waves or, more in keeping with genealogy, into generations, each with a set of significant discursive characteristics connected to a particular historical, national and conceptual context. In doing so, I am aware of producing categories that exist only as a result of my analysis; yet, given that genre distinctions are by definition mobile, the aim of the book is to offer an explanatory paradigm which can be tested against readers’ own viewing experiences. In my schema, the first generation, or the camcorder generation, encompasses the reality crime programmes of the first half of the 1990s, which had their start in the US, as well as the ‘docusoaps’ of the second half of the 1990s, which had their start in the UK. The second generation, or the competition generation, begins with Big Brother, the ground-breaking show which appeared in 1999 in the Netherlands and introduced game show-type competition under conditions of surveillance in a contrived setting. Within a few years, this developed into interventionist formats predicated on a challenge, in which participants are given an opportunity for self-transformation. The third generation, although it lacks a major programme that encapsulates its attributes, is concerned with the production of celebrity. At this stage, reality TV disengages from its documentary roots and becomes a self-conscious participant in the rituals of self-commodification and\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 9\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\n10\n\nREALITY TV\n\nself-legitimation that define contemporary celebrity culture. Although the breaks between these generations cannot be rigidly enforced, they do help to focus our attention not only on historical contexts but also on associated concepts. To set the scene for the later appearance of reality TV, the first chapter reviews important genealogical antecedents by focusing on two early attempts to capture televisual ‘reality’: Alan Funt’s Cold War-era Candid Camera (1947–1970s) and the 1970s documentary series An American Family (PBS, 1973). These two programmes are both concerned with the observation of everyday life, but they implement different innovative techniques to do so, namely, the hidden camera in Candid Camera and what I call the ‘live-in’ camera in An American Family. The discussion of Candid Camera in this chapter draws links with the surveillance culture of the Cold War era as well the growing scientific interest in observing everyday life and behaviours. The discussion of An American Family extends beyond the series itself to follow its legacy through the ‘family docs’ it influenced, from the controversial UK series The Family (BBC, 1974), to the even more controversial Australian series Sylvania Waters (ABC, 1992/BBC, 1993), and finally to the relatively quiet return of The Family in Britain on Channel 4 (2008–10). The second chapter is devoted to the first generation of reality television, the crime/emergency shows that sprang up in the early 1990s in the US, followed some five years later in the UK by docusoaps. The chapter combines consideration of political climate, conditions in the television industry and the rise of camcorder culture to make a claim for the similar bases of these two new format types while keeping their contexts of emergence distinct. Conceptually, the chapter considers how conservative economic policies of deregulation led to the television industry creating hybrid forms that sought to document ‘everyday life’ within the framework of entertainment. As these programmes repeatedly show, the everyday is equal parts banality and conflict, a paradox which challenges conventional programming practices in television and leads to what John Corner (2000) has called a ‘post-documentary’ culture of diversion. For many television scholars and commentators, reality TV only begins with Big Brother in 1999 and Survivor in 2000. In Chapter 3, I argue that these two programmes mark the start of the second generation of reality TV by placing surveillance technology within the framework of competition. The idea of putting strangers together in a living situation and filming the results, however, belonged to the producers of The Real World (MTV, 1992), so this chapter begins by reaching\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 10\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\nWHAT IS REALITY TV ?\n\n11\n\nback to a different ‘origin’ in order to map the concerns that would become relevant to the second generation. The bulk of the chapter is devoted to the phenomenon of Big Brother, considering it as a controversial social experiment, an international new media object and a site for competing discourses about authenticity and performance. In the final section, the chapter focuses on the implications of the competitive framework by using theories of play to analyse Survivor in its own discursive terms, as a game. In Chapter 4 I trace the direct legacy of these two major competitive surveillance formats on the programmes that followed in the first half of the 2000s. In order to map the explosion of reality TV formats in this period, I argue that the competitive focus of Survivor becomes redefined more broadly in terms of the personal challenge, which then provides participants with opportunities for self-improvement and self-transformation. The chapter traces the development of reality TV as a transformative opportunity through four programme clusters: post-Survivor competition formats, real-love formats such as The Bachelor, makeover programmes and ‘life intervention’ shows (the term comes from Ouellette and Hay 2008). Conceptually, the chapter interrogates the meanings and effects of televisual transformation, laying the groundwork for thinking about reality TV as a mechanism of ‘biopolitics’, which is a term derived from Michel Foucault to address the way that institutions use political means to regulate how people live and thrive. The fifth chapter claims that reality television has entered upon a third generation, which marks the shift from a focus on ordinary people to a concern with the mechanisms of celebrity. Tracing the various ways in which reality TV engages with these mechanisms, the discussion moves from a focus on talent formats (e.g. American Idol) through no-talent-required formats (as exemplified by reality TV stars who are famous for ‘nothing’) to those formats which are based on the participation of existing celebrities (e.g. The Osbournes, Strictly Come Dancing). In its approach, this chapter focuses on celebrity as a commodity which circulates in the economy of reality TV production and consumption. ‘Economy’ is used here in a broad sense, since celebrity serves a number of purposes in reality TV: as the highly desirable commodity called ‘fame’, as a form of labour leading to lucrative reward and as a form of capital that can be reinvested to produce greater celebrity. Finally, the book concludes by returning to the vexed question of genre through one of the channels that pioneered reality television, MTV, in order to better understand the contemporary hallmarks and legacies of reality TV. Although I offer some general observations\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 11\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\n12\n\nREALITY TV\n\nabout the generic consistency of reality television, my preferred mode remains at the level of the particular. My investigation of reality TV thus closes with a brief case-study of Jersey Shore, a programme which seems to encapsulate the highs, lows and ambiguities of this constantly developing form. By tracing the generations of reality TV, this book seeks to introduce readers to the key themes that have structured this field of study. It covers central concepts such as authenticity and realism, ordinary life, competition, self-transformation and celebrity culture, while also providing a history of the clustering and consolidation of reality television as a genre. Along with relevant technological and industrial developments, these concepts are considered in the context of specific socio-historical periods and television programming trends to argue that reality television definitely comes from somewhere, even if we may not quite know where it is going.\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 12\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\n1 Before Reality TV: From Candid Camera to Family Docs\n\nNo genre springs into culture fully formed. Rather, scholars like Steve Neale (2000) and Jason Mittel (2004) stress that genres are always in the process of formation. This is in part because any genre’s textual forms and associated industry practices take time to coalesce, and in part because a genre develops through its usage, as it circulates in the discourses of high or popular culture. Reality television is no exception. Its prehistory can be traced back through documentary, quiz shows, talent competitions and talk shows – any television format that over the decades has invited ‘real people’ before the camera. For this reason, many critics have argued that reality TV offers little that is new. A more careful genealogy, however, must draw attention not simply to the presence of non-actors before the camera but also to the place of the camera itself in relation to ‘real people’. This chapter thus reviews the important genealogical antecedents to reality television by focusing on two early modes of capturing reality through television: the hidden camera and what I will call the live-in camera. The former was brought to television and popularised by Allen Funt’s Candid Camera, which began in 1948 and has continued off and on to the present day. The latter is exemplified by two 1970s documentary experiments in capturing ‘real’ families, one from each side of the Atlantic: An American Family (PBS, Alan and Susan Raymond, 1973) and The Family (BBC, Paul Watson, 1974). Although all three of these programmes have been identified by scholars as key sources for the development of reality television (notably McCarthy 2004; Clissold 2004; and Ruoff 2002), they have yet to be considered together as providing a dual legacy – technological and conceptual – for reality TV. Both kinds of camera, the hidden and the live-in camera, are reliant on technological developments in the mid-twentieth century that led to smaller, portable audio-visual recording devices. Documentary film-makers in the 1940s had been severely restricted by the large and clunky apparatus required to film with synchronised sound; they 13\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 13\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\n14\n\nREALITY TV\n\npreferred to film black-and-white images with lighter equipment and add sound in post-production (Ellis and McLane 2005). When Allen Funt began using the innovative wire recorder in the mid-1940s, he became one of numerous documentarists in the post-war period who used its portability to capture real voices – although he was the only one to think of concealing it to produce ‘candid’ vignettes as a media commodity. By the late 1950s, fuelled by the recording needs of the television news market, technological advances were making it possible to record image and sound synchronously on portable equipment (Neupert 2007). It was the mobile 16 mm cameras and magnetic tape recorders of the 1960s, however, that revolutionised both fiction and documentary film-making. The film-makers of the French New Wave, for instance, made an art form out of the possibilities presented by the new technology, favouring location shooting, natural lighting, short shooting schedules and non-eventful, everyday storylines. The same techniques meant that documentary-makers were discovering that it was ‘possible to film everyday events with minimal staging or intervention’ (Nichols 2001: 100). The clichéd storylines of traditional fiction film and the didactic narration of conventional documentaries could be traded in for something more real, shot direct from life. As the new equipment became more lightweight, dropping from 200 to 20 lbs in 1960 alone (Ellis and McLane 2005: 210), filming reality without alteration or interruption became more plausible – and more desirable. The 1960s and 1970s saw the rise of two observational documentary approaches made possible by the technological advances in portable filming equipment: cinema vérité in France and direct cinema in the US. Although both sought to capture life on the fly through the synchronous recording of image and sound, the two methods had a different approach to the role of the camera. The term cinema vérité was coined by French ethnographic film-maker Jean Rouch, who was himself inspired by pioneer Soviet film-maker Dziga Vertov’s kino pravda (cinema of truth) from forty years earlier (Ellis and McLane 2005: 216). Borrowing concepts from New Wave film-makers, cinema vérité acknowledged the role of the camera as a catalyst to events and the film-maker as an active participant, producing a visual style ‘that incorporated informality and spontaneity into its “look”, including such unconventional “mistakes” as poor lighting and the optically violent movement of the camera, which was frequently handheld’ (Monaco 2001: 203). On the other side of the Atlantic, photojournalist Robert Drew and cinematographer Ricky Leacock joined American documentary makers in creating ‘direct cinema’, which sought to revolutionise the tradition of didactic documentary film-making by\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 14\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\nBEFORE REALITY TV\n\n15\n\ndoing away with a narrator and giving viewers a sense of ‘being there’. Both of these documentary movements are observational, in the sense that they claim to let the material speak for itself. They are distinguished, however, by their stance on filmic objectivity: whereas cinema vérité denied the possibility of objectivity and embraced the subjective involvement of the film-maker, direct cinema placed its faith in an unobtrusive, fly-on-the-wall camera held by an objective observer. Climactic events or tense scenarios provided the best material for both documentary approaches, but Erik Barnouw notes the crucial distinction between the way they approached climaxes: ‘The direct cinema documentarist took his camera to a situation of tension and waited hopefully for a crisis; the Rouch version of cinema-vérité tried to precipitate one. The direct cinema artist aspired to invisibility; the Rouch cinema-vérité artist was often an avowed participant’ (Barnouw 1993: 254–5). This struggle to decide whether the camera should offer reality directly or direct reality remains pertinent for discussions of reality TV. In this chapter we will consider Candid Camera as an early televisual form of directing reality, since situations on this programme were constructed in order to elicit humorous behaviour from unknowing participants. In An American Family and The Family, by contrast, we will find the observational or ‘fly-on-the-wall’ camera used in these programmes in an attempt to show reality directly and objectively. Both of these approaches to filming reality, the contrived and the observed, become crucial strands of the reality TV genre yet to be developed. Of course, any media form must by definition mediate the reality it seeks to capture, and this inevitably opens the way to accusations of intervention, manipulation, simulation and even deception. Such accusations are exacerbated when the mediated reality intersects with the genres and frameworks of television entertainment. In this chapter we will thus consider the foundational issues for reality TV. Do ‘real people’ before a camera remain real and under what conditions might this be possible? How much manipulation is permissible, or even necessary, by reality documentarists and at what stage of the process? What is the social value and the ethical cost of putting real people under surveillance? And finally, what are the legacies of the observational style for the development of the reality TV genre? Candid Camera: History and Format Candid Camera originated in audio format as Candid Microphone, broadcast on radio in 1947. Allen Funt, the creator and producer,\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 15\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\n16\n\nREALITY TV\n\ntraces the provenance of the programme to his early beginnings as an ‘idea and gimmick man’ for radio shows (Zimbardo 1985: 44), which in turn led to his ‘show business apprenticeship’ in the US Army Signal Corps during World War II (Nadis 2007: 14). Here, he was given the opportunity to create radio shows, including one called ‘The Gripe Booth’ in which GI’s aired their complaints. Whereas Funt began by inviting soldiers to speak into the microphone, he soon discovered that the men would speak more candidly if they did not know they were being recorded; the new wire recorder that was available in the Army, Funt says, ‘was a revelation because it was small enough to conceal’ (Zimbardo 1985: 44). In the hands of Funt, this revelation was revolutionary: the concept of the hidden microphone, placed in the service of media entertainment, was born. For Funt, the appeal of covert recording, which he successfully pitched to producers on his return to New York, lay in creating ‘a program that would simply record the beauty of everyday conversation’ through ‘pure eavesdropping’ (Funt and Reed 1994, cited in Nadis 2007: 14). In the hands of Funt, eavesdropping became a neutral and even necessary tool of the documentary impulse to capture everyday reality. But Funt also discovered that everyday conversation could be dull if allowed to unfold at its own pace. He thus created scenarios to see how people reacted when they were ‘unposed, unrehearsed and completely off-guard’ (Funt, cited in Nadis 2007: 18). In an episode of Candid Microphone, for instance, one vignette involves the icon of early horror films, Bela Lugosi, posing as a curiosity shop owner and asking an unwitting female customer to admire his shop’s collection of shrunken heads, human bones and sundry unpleasantries.1 While the setting is obviously staged, Funt had already figured out in 1947 that ‘everyday conversation’ was only truly interesting if people were given something to react to, a strange situation or everyday crisis that would test their responses. The hidden microphone was not just an eavesdropper, but also a stagehand. In 1948, Candid Microphone switched media, from radio to television, and from microphone to camera. The new show Candid Camera ‘became the first programme to be aired on the new ABC network’, as Bradley Clissold points out, thus placing this progenitor of reality TV at the origins of network television itself (2004: 35). Over the next two decades, Candid Camera appeared on all three major US networks, in syndication and as part of evening talkshows,2 eventually achieving prime-time popularity as a weekly series on CBS from 1960 to 1967. During this same period, a UK version was developed which ran for five series. In the early 1970s, Funt made three films on\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 16\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\nBEFORE REALITY TV\n\n17\n\nthe model of Candid Camera about sex, money and marriage, respectively.3 Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Candid Camera appeared sporadically in syndication, as network specials and on cable, including an adult version produced by Funt for the Playboy Channel. Although Allen Funt ended his involvement in 1993, his son Peter Funt continued with the programme, co-hosting a weekly show on CBS from 1998 before moving in 2001 to the PAX network and eventually switching from production to DVD sales. This decades-long output does not include the numerous other countries that have picked up the format and adapted it to their own specifications.4 To say, then, that Candid Camera has enjoyed enduring popularity is an understatement: Funt’s entertainment concept of placing ordinary people in a simulated scenario, unaware that they are being filmed, struck a chord with viewers that overflows historical and cultural boundaries. Fred Nadis expresses some surprise that the original show ‘pleased audiences even though it did not fit pre-existing genres or broadcasters’ notion of television’s strengths as a medium’ (2007: 15). With the advantage of hindsight, however, it might be more accurate to suggest that Funt was inventing a genre, one that presciently foresaw the possibilities to come of television as a channel for ‘mediatized observation’ (Yesil 2001). The format of Candid Camera is disarmingly simple and hence repeatable with endless variation. The show consists of multiple short vignettes, each of which involves a preconceived scenario set up in a public place to lure unwitting participants, whose reactions are then secretly filmed. After a few minutes, the camera and set-up are exposed to the participants, providing a dramatic climax which Funt called ‘the reveal’. Although Funt developed numerous categories from which to generate vignettes – including ‘tricks of the trade’, ‘wish fulfilment’ and ‘human frailties’ (Nadis 2007: 15) – the mainstay of the long-running series was the ‘small crisis’ (ibid.). Whether the ‘crisis’ is a mailbox that engages passers-by in conversation, a mimeograph machine that won’t stop spitting out paper or a temporary secretary ushered into a business office and asked to take a love letter, in all of these situations people find themselves in familiar, ‘normal’ settings that are made somehow strange or abnormal. Repeatedly in these scenarios, Funt is interested in the interpersonal context, especially in the way that people respond to authority, whether institutional or simply social pressure. He thus returned several times to the elevator gag, where Candid Camera operatives face to the side or back of a lift, forcing the unwitting participant to do the same or stand out as different. Similarly, he tested how motorists would react to a motorway sign claiming that the state of Delaware is closed for the day (they\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 17\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\n18\n\nREALITY TV\n\nobediently turned around and tried another state). Interestingly, despite the fact that the camera is always concealed, most participants respond to abnormality in an everyday situation by looking around to see if they are being observed. This is one reason, perhaps, why the ‘reveal’ is so often met with smiles and relief, since the camera materialises a gaze that the participant was already expecting. Although Candid Camera is best remembered for creating small crises in everyday scenarios, the ‘reveal’ is equally pertinent to the success of this reality TV precursor. Crucially, the skits work only because the reveal at the end balances the unequal power relations between duped and duper, bringing the unwitting participants into the circle of the knowing and placing them on an equal footing with the ‘ordinary’ members of the audience. With the ubiquitous catchphrase ‘Smile, you’re on Candid Camera!’, Funt invited the duped participants to laugh at themselves along with the social community of Candid Camera crew and viewers at home. In fact, it is in the moment when participants discover the camera – and hence look directly into it – that the connection between the ordinary person on screen and ordinary viewers at home is made most strongly. In the reveal, then, it is not only the duped who become knowing but also the knowing who recognise their affinity with the duped: ‘It works when we are essentially laughing at ourselves and our weaknesses, and when it plays up our ability to endure those weaknesses and still get on with the business of living’ (Funt, cited in Zimbardo 1985: 47). The contrary is precisely what does not work. Placing people in cruel scenarios or ‘show[ing] people at . . . an enormous disadvantage’ causes audiences to dissociate themselves from the prank. In these cases, writes Funt, ‘one simply starts laughing at [the subjects] with total sympathy and exhibits a total antipathy toward the people who are perpetrating the hoax’ (Funt 1971: 254). Such antipathy to the perpetrators, whether on the part of audiences or participants, represents the Achilles heel of a format based on pranks and contrived situations. This is why Funt stresses that ‘I am personally supportive, not aloof or condescending . . . Everyone who agrees to let us air their segment gets medals inscribed, “I was on Candid Camera and I was big enough to let other people share the experience with me” – and they were’ (cited in Zimbardo 1985: 47). By thus cajoling people into seeing themselves as associates who ‘share the experience’ with him – and offering a medal as proof of achievement – Funt was able to obtain signed releases from the majority of his subjects. In fact, Funt made a point of obtaining releases from all recognisable participants; if someone refused to sign, then he would not even develop the film (Funt 1971: 258). The release, both\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 18\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\nBEFORE REALITY TV\n\n19\n\na legal document and a statement of acquiescence to ‘sharing’ the experience, was a guarantee against future lawsuits. But it also granted participants a degree of (retroactive) choice as well as a literal buy-in to the process, thereby redressing the ethical imbalance of power in the prank. As Clissold points out, the release placed participants, who had previously been unwitting dupes, in the position of ‘“knowledgeable agents” capable of resisting and negotiating the terms of their own surveillance’ (2004: 42). Further, the release constituted the basis of an economic exchange. Paid on average $50 for signing the release, participants turned their performance into a commodity, making surveillance, Clissold argues, into ‘a business transaction’ (ibid.). Candid Camera as Surveillance When Funt first began experimenting with the wire recorder, the concept of the hidden microphone already existed, although not yet for purposes of business or entertainment. Rather, it was an important part of surveillance practices being carried out by governmental and military forces, especially in the aftermath of World War II as a political and ideological stand-off escalated between the US and the Soviet Union. From the late 1940s until well into the 1970s – that is, the same period in which the original Candid Camera appeared regularly on networks or in syndication – daily life in the US was marked by the Cold War era, a period characterised by threats of nuclear attack, fears of Communist infiltration, domestic vigilance against ‘un-American’ activities, and the spread of surveillance on both sides of the political divide. Funt himself was well aware that the popularity of Candid Microphone had much to do with the cultural context of surveillance: In those days, the late forties, the public was fascinated by the idea of recording equipment that was so small it could be hidden. Remember, this was the beginning of the Cold War and fears of the Russians spying on the U.S. were constantly on people’s minds. Publicity for Candid Microphone always mentioned how the microphone was hidden. (Funt and Reed 1994: 35) Allen Funt, in other words, was ‘the idea and gimmick man’ who produced the right idea for the right time. The initial reviews of Candid Microphone archived by Funt suggest a degree of anxiety associated with covert surveillance as well as a fascination with its seemingly unstoppable spread. A Time magazine reviewer noted, ‘[t]he whole country seems likely to be plagued with hidden microphones’, while the New York Herald Tribune had the\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 19\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\n20\n\nREALITY TV\n\nprescience to foresee the next move: ‘The possibilities are limitless: the prospect is horrifying. Wait till they get the Candid Television Camera. You won’t be safe in your own bathtub’ (Funt and Reed 1994: 30). As articulated in these reviews, the concern has less to do with Communists or un-American activities than with the violation of privacy implicit in skits which catch people off-guard. Of course, for practical as well as legal reasons, Funt was careful to set up candid scenarios in public places, but the idea of covert surveillance, then as now, inspired anxiety about being caught in one’s most private moments (e.g. naked in the bathtub). Bradley Clissold, however, argues that the reviewers mistakenly held Funt’s show responsible for the spread of private surveillance: Candid Microphone wasn’t responsible for placing hidden microphones or cameras in suburban backyards and households; they were already there in the eyes and ears of concerned and vigilant citizens encouraged by government propaganda to report any signs of “un-American” activity. (Clissold 2004: 35) Since a culture of surveillance involving citizens as well as the government had already established itself on American soil, this meant that Candid Microphone and later Candid Camera found it easy to take root. Clissold goes on to point out, moreover, that this was a two-way relationship. Whereas ‘[t]he climate of Cold War politics and culture arguably made audiences ideologically receptive’ to the hidden-camera show, Candid Camera ‘[i]n turn . . . made surveillance entertaining, less threatening and ideologically acceptable’ (ibid.). The show not only asked participants literally to accept surveillance by signing a release but also diluted viewers’ surveillance-anxiety with laughter (Clissold 2004: 33). In this Cold War climate of surveillance, where people watched each other as intently as they watched themselves to make sure their behaviour could not be construed as ‘un-American’, it is no surprise that authority and conformity are major themes of the Candid shows. Indeed the very first skit Funt undertook for Candid Microphone signalled the series’ interest in institutional authority and obedient citizenship: In the first scenario I used, I went up to a New York City policeman and confessed to overparking my car the day before. I asked him to give me a ticket. As he tried to talk me out of it, I became more insistent about the values of citizenship and obeying the law. (Funt, cited in Zimbardo 1985: 44)\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 20\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\nBEFORE REALITY TV\n\n21\n\nFunt’s exaggerated obedience to the law as a ‘model citizen’ in this skit subverts the power of the policeman (to give tickets) and deflates the grand ideologies of citizenship (into paying fines for parking infractions). Thus, in the very act of drawing attention to the ‘values of citizenship’ and the power of institutional authority, he undermines both. By using a hidden microphone, moreover, Funt inverts the conventional power hierarchy: in place of government authorities using recording equipment for ‘espionage and surveillance’, Funt uses these ‘same recording technologies’ to undercut authority for the purposes of entertainment (Clissold 2004: 39). This attitude to institutional authority goes hand in hand with Funt’s lifelong crusade against social conformity: ‘the worst thing, and I see it over and over, is how easily people can be led by any kind of authority figure, or even the most minimal signs of authority’ (cited in Zimbardo 1985: 47). In scenarios like people facing the wrong way in an elevator or a motorway sign that Delaware is closed for the day, viewers are asked to laugh at – and hence to undercut – their own willing conformity to social pressure and minimal degrees of authority. By pressing his subjects to ‘Smile!’ and be a good sport, however, Funt was himself engaged in modelling a certain kind of citizen, the individual who accepted surveillance with grace. His position as a well-known personality on Candid Camera was its own kind of authority, and the laughter his skits evinced was also a means of social regulation. If Big Brother-style surveillance, whether institutional or social, can be used to produce the model citizen, then Funt was among the first to use surveillance both to critique authority and to promote a citizenship that accepts surveillance as a useful tool of the modern mediated world. As with reality TV, the ethics are troublingly circular: surveillance is the tool of resistance that provides the means of ‘teaching responsible citizenship’ (McCarthy 2004: 23), which in turn involves being compliant with (televisual) surveillance. Candid Camera as Behavioural Science Allen Funt was not the only one between the 1950s and the 1970s to be using ‘covertly filmed behavior [as] a tool for teaching responsible citizenship’, as Anna McCarthy points out (2004: 23). This was also a period of social experimentation with human subjects by psychologists and experimental sociologists eager to understand the motivations of human behaviour in a world which had produced fascist and Communist totalitarianism. In this era, which was beginning ‘to use simulation as a problem-solving tool’ and ‘as a means for producing new knowledge’ (McCarthy 2004: 30; original emphasis), Funt was\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 21\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\n22\n\nREALITY TV\n\npraised for his ability to elicit the norms of human behaviour from simulated situations. Embracing Funt’s work as a popularisation of their own models, social scientists praised Candid Camera for the ‘educational value’ (Funt, cited in Zimbardo 1985: 47) of placing people in an experimental situation to test their responses. Philip Zimbardo, a social psychologist at Stanford University, compared Funt to Sigmund Freud in his preface to a 1985 interview with Funt in Psychology Today: ‘What Sigmund Freud did for the couch and the study of the abnormal, Allen Funt has done for elevators, street corners, mailboxes and the study of the normal’ (Zimbardo 1985: 43). Zimbardo’s belief in the scientific importance of Funt’s work was echoed by James Maas, a social psychologist at Cornell University who persuaded Funt to donate the Candid Camera film records to Cornell for scientific uses (Maas and Toivanen 1978). Funt’s work also met with appreciation from Stanley Milgram, a Yale University professor of psychology who co-wrote an article with a graduate student in 1979 pointing to the convergences, as well as divergences, between Candid Camera and social scientific techniques. In this article Milgram and Sabini noted the similarities between Candid Camera and the ethno-methodological approach of Harold Garfinkel, an experimental sociologist who asked his students to disrupt the habits of their daily interactions in order to prove ‘that people continuously construct meanings out of the flux of daily life, even out of incongruity’ (Milgram and Sabini 1979: 74). For Milgram and Sabini, Candid Camera was to be praised for ‘giv[ing] us a new vision through the disruption of the habitual’ (1979: 72). In the view of these contemporary social scientists, the candid scenarios are not the settings for pranks, but for serious studies of human behaviour. In the 1985 interview with Zimbardo, Funt admitted to some ambivalence about the ethical aspects of his show: ‘I believe Candid Camera has educational value, but I also worry about what happens when the same type of deception or exposé of human frailty is used by the wrong people’ (Zimbardo 1985: 47). What Funt has in mind as ‘wrong’ uses of the hidden camera concept are ‘the scams of confidence men, or spying by governments or businesses, or even TV programs that encourage people to make fools of themselves for money’ (ibid.). We will return to the suggestion that TV shows subsequent to Candid Camera might constitute a wrong or unethical use of surveillance and simulation, but for now it is interesting to note that Funt does not include experimental psychologists in the list, even though a number of these experiments have since become notorious for their unethical treatment of subjects. In the Cold War climate of anxie-\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 22\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\nBEFORE REALITY TV\n\n23\n\nties about fascist and Communist totalitarianism, many behavioural psychologists and social scientists were concerned, like Funt, to test the human response to authority and social pressure by setting up situations which experimented with human subjects. Two of these experiments, carried out by vocal supporters of Funt, were particularly controversial. In the early 1960s, Stanley Milgram conducted an experiment in which subjects were asked to administer increasing doses of electric shock to a person attached to a machine as part of a putative experiment on aversion tactics in learning. The experiment depended on simulation; the shocks were a fake, the ‘learner’ was an actor, and the actual purpose of the experiment was to find out how far people would go to obey an authority that commands them to hurt another human being. The experiments found over and over again that subjects were willing to continue administrating increased shocks when told to do so, with the majority carrying on despite hearing cries of pain (which were actually sounds on playback) (McCarthy 2004: 32). Although no human subjects were physically hurt in the experiment, the psychological community (as represented, for instance, by the American Psychological Association) questioned the ethics of subjecting unwary participants to the distress of causing pain to others. Moreover, as Anna McCarthy makes clear in her choice of words to describe the experiment, there is a blurred line between simulation and outright deception: ‘Using actors, props, a script, and an artificial laboratory setting, Milgram deceived human subjects into believing that they were administering punitive electric shocks to other participants’ (2004: 31; my emphasis). Not surprisingly, perhaps, Milgram’s own co-authored article about Candid Camera is very careful to use the word ‘simulation’ with reference to the hidden-camera technique, even though he excuses the ethical dilemma in the interests of scientific purpose: ‘Ethically, this aspect of Candid Camera [observing behaviour without the awareness of the participants] is problematical; scientifically it is indispensable to a full understanding of human behavior’ (Milgram and Sabini 1979: 73). Philip Zimbardo, who not only interviewed Funt but also collaborated with him on psychology classroom films, created the notorious Stanford Prison Experiment, which remains highly controversial today. In this experiment, carried out in 1971, a group of male volunteers were randomly divided into ‘guards’ and ‘prisoners’ and placed in a simulated prison setting, from arrest through booking and incarceration. The point, writes Zimbardo on the dedicated website (www.prisonexp.org), was to ask, ‘What happens when you put good people in an evil place? Does humanity win over evil, or does evil\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 23\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\n24\n\nREALITY TV\n\ntriumph?’ The answer, it seems, came more quickly than expected when Zimbardo lost control of the two-week experiment and shut it down after six days: ‘In only a few days, our guards became sadistic and our prisoners became depressed and showed signs of extreme stress’ (www.prisonexp.org). Although this experiment, unlike Milgram’s, used volunteers who understood the conditions of their undertaking, the concept of placing people in an extreme situation over whose outcome they have little or no control is highly problematic, especially given that both simulations invite people to do violence to others. Nonetheless, perhaps because of its ability to address issues of state control in relation to social and psychological violence, the Stanford experiment has had a cultural reawakening. In 2001, a disturbing German film called Das Experiment (dir.: Oliver Hirschbiegel) offered a fictional re-enactment of the event, and in 2005 the Polish video artist Artur Zmijewski created a restaging of the experiment with actual volunteers, from which he produced the 20-minute video Repetition (see Kavka 2009). Just as Milgram went on to make a documentary based on his experiments called Obedience (1965), so the Stanford Prison Experiment has had a media after-life, although not in Zimbardo’s own hands. One notable form of this after-life is the discourse of social and psychological experimentation that clings to reality television, especially with Big Brother and other programmes that house ‘inmates’ together to see what will happen over prolonged cohabitation (see Chapter 3). Perhaps not coincidentally, early seasons of Big Brother in numerous countries used in-studio psychologists to provide analyses of the dynamics in the Big Brother house as well as to lend the gravitas of science to televisual simulation. As Anna McCarthy argues, ‘reality TV in the 1950s and today . . . is a place where TV and social and applied psychology come together’ (2004: 23). Candid Camera as Seen on TV With the Candid series, Allen Funt brought the tools of surveillance to the medium of radio and then television to produce entertainment within ‘a psychological or sociological framework’ (Funt 1971: 257). Combining art and science, theatre and pedagogy (McCarthy 2004: 27), Funt was able to capitalise on the technological base and cultural context of mass media in the 1950s and 1960s to popularise scientific discourse and assuage surveillance anxiety through documentary tactics. He did this by understanding that the mass media could – and in his mind, should – capture a ‘poetics of everyday life’ (Nadis 2007: 18) that was more immediate than film and more quotidian than the\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 24\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\nBEFORE REALITY TV\n\n25\n\noutdated newsreel. Proud of having recorded an estimated one and a quarter million people in the course of his career (Zimbardo 1985: 45), Funt believed that the technology and reach of broadcast media could be used for the democratic purpose of picking individuals out of the anonymous mechanisms of history (Nadis 2007: 18). In the introduction to his first LP anthology from the Candid Microphone series, he celebrated the fact that ‘the plain everyday kind of people you never see in the headlines or in the movies or on the stage . . . make themselves heard here as individuals’ (cited in Nadis 2007: 18). In a sense, Funt implemented the utopian promise of mechanical reproduction that the cultural theorist Walter Benjamin had foreseen in the 1930s. Prior to the twentieth century, argues Benjamin, people could be recorded for posterity only by becoming a work of art in the literal sense of having their portrait painted. With the arrival of recording technology, however, it became possible to document countless people, hence ‘offer[ing] everyone the opportunity to rise from passerby to movie extra. In this way any man might even find himself part of a work of art’ (Benjamin 2006: 27). While Benjamin had in mind the newsreel, Funt’s Candid vignettes go one better than offering everyone a part as an extra; they offer everyone the opportunity to appear as themselves in the mass media. This is the first legacy of Candid Camera to subsequent generations of reality TV. Once the Candid format moved from radio to television, the camera increased the individualisation of the ‘everyday kind of people’ who passed before the lens. Beyond simply being heard, people could be seen, expressing their particularity through a whole range of actions and non-verbal expressions, even if – or precisely because – they did so unknowingly. It is in this potential of the television medium to capture an individual’s particularities that Funt found his medium: ‘Most of all, I wanted to go beyond what people merely said, to record what they did – their gestures, facial expression, confusions and delights’ (cited in Zimbardo 1985: 45). When asked by Zimbardo to reflect on what made Candid Camera work, Funt did not emphasise the hidden recording, which he saw as little more than a red herring (Funt 1971: 259). Rather, he drew attention to the medium itself: ‘We used the medium of TV well. There were close-ups of people in action. The audience saw ordinary people, like themselves, and the reality of events as they were unfolding’ (cited in Zimbardo 1985: 46). This insightful combination of ‘ordinary people’ with an immediate ‘reality of events’ unfolding before the viewer lies at the core of Candid Camera’s success. This is its second legacy to reality television. I suggested earlier, in response to Fred Nadis’s bemusement that\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 25\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\n26\n\nREALITY TV\n\nCandid Camera was popular ‘even though it did not fit pre-existing genres’, that Funt was in the process of creating a genre. More accurately, since a genre is not made out of just one programme, he was laying the groundwork for what might later become a genre, creating an outline in the cultural imaginary where a particular set of techniques and terms might eventually coalesce into a recognisable generic form. Interestingly, Candid Camera remained a unique format from the late 1940s until the late 1980s, arguably until the appearance America’s Funniest Home Videos discovered that the humoroussituation clip could be self-made. Although the format was sold to other countries and has recently spawned a subgenre of reality-prank programmes (e.g. Punk’d (MTV, 2003–7); Prank’d (MTV, 2010–)), the show had no US competitors and hence little generic recognisability in its 1960s heyday. This is evident from an episode of the popular quiz show What’s My Line (CBS, 1950–67) in which Allen Funt appears as the ‘mystery challenger’ (TX, 15 September 1963).5 Facing a blindfolded celebrity panel that must guess who he is or what he does, Funt disguises his voice and succeeds in flummoxing the panel. They discover early on in the questioning that he is on a TV show but they cannot figure out which one because they try to narrow it down by genre: panel show, situation comedy, drama, variety show? Even Arlene Francis’s question about whether the show is based on comedy meets with the ambiguous response, ‘sometimes yes and sometimes otherwise’. Had the panel, of course, asked whether this was a hidden-camera programme which captured ordinary people’s reactions to small crises in everyday settings, the answer would have been obvious. But no one thought to use any of those terms – hidden camera, ordinary people, contrived situations – because at the time the show was unique. Setting out the terms around which a genre could coalesce around these terms is the third legacy of Candid Camera to reality television. Observing Ordinary People At the same time as Allen Funt and his camera crews were taking advantage of portable – and concealable – sync-sound equipment for CBS in the 1960s, another team of American film-makers was taking candid recording for film and television in a different direction. Drew Associates was founded by Robert Drew in the late 1950s and consisted of a group of young documentarists whose names would soon become synonymous with direct cinema: Drew himself, Richard Leacock, D. A. Pennebaker, Albert and David Maysles and others.\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 26\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\nBEFORE REALITY TV\n\n27\n\nIn 1960, with Robert Drew as writer and director, Drew Associates made the landmark film Primary, which chronicled the battle between Democratic presidential nominees John F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey on the campaign trail before the Wisconsin primary election. Using hand-held cameras, long takes and no interviews or narration, the film literally follows the two candidates and observes them from an insider position, shooting them in their hotel rooms as well as in town halls. This up-close, fly-on-the-wall style represented the direct cinema documentarists’ commitment to recording actuality ‘without script, without direction, with scarcely any editing’ (Ellis and McLane 2005: 218). The documentary subjects were left to direct themselves, and the stories told themselves in the pictorial style Drew called ‘candid photography’, which he had learned as a photojournalist at LIFE magazine in the 1950s. The observational style of direct cinema became the mark of cutting-edge documentary film-making in the 1960s. Seeking to show rather than tell, documentary makers such as the Maysles brothers, D. A. Pennebaker and even the artist Andy Warhol experimented with placing an objective camera in intimate relation to the unfolding of everyday life. Perhaps the best-known film is D. A. Pennebaker’s portrait of Bob Dylan on tour, Don’t Look Back (1967), but not all direct cinema required famous subjects from politics or culture. On the contrary, the observational style lent itself to up-close portraits of ordinary people as a way of addressing social issues. In the UK, John Boorman produced a five-part series for the BBC called Citizen 63 (1963), which made use of extensive mobile observational footage, combined with narration, to focus on one ordinary person per episode as ‘part of our society’ (cited in BFI Screenonline). In 1964, the investigative current affairs show World in Action (ITV, 1963–98) launched the experimental Up series with Seven Up!, a documentary which selected fourteen British schoolchildren from a range of socio-economic backgrounds for a project which would film them every seven years to show how social class determines future status. In the US, independent film-maker Frederick Wiseman documented unnamed individuals in American social institutions, such as High School (1969) and Hospital (1970). And in 1969, Allan King extended the same logic by applying the observational style to the most intimate of social institutions – marriage. His film about ten critical weeks in a marriage, called simply A Married Couple, directly inspired Craig Gilbert, producer of An American Family, to apply the observational style to tracking an ordinary family (Ruoff 2002: 12–13). The result, much to producer Craig Gilbert’s surprise, was a media and cultural event, which\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 27\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\n28\n\nREALITY TV\n\nwould influence future televisual representation of real families and (eventually) spawn the 24/7 reality TV form. An American Family: The Original Family Doc On 11 January 1973 the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) aired the first episode of a twelve-part unscripted series devoted to the everyday life of the Loud family in Santa Barbara, California. Over the ensuing three months, it became one of the most watched and talkedabout non-fiction programmes in the history of US television, with an estimated 10 million viewers tuning in per episode (Ruoff 2002: xv). It was widely, if not necessarily positively, reviewed in respected newspapers and magazines. The members of the Loud family themselves wrote articles, gave interviews and appeared on all three of the major issue-oriented talkshows of the early 1970s: The Phil Donahue Show, The Mike Douglas Show and, most memorably, The Dick Cavett Show. Producer Craig Gilbert made it clear that this was intended as a sociological programme about the issues affecting – and irretrievably changing – family life in 1970s’ America: divorce rates, the women’s movement, the generation gap, and new attitudes to sex, sexuality and drugs (Rupert and Puckett 2010). The Louds may not have been the ‘average or typical’ American family, as Gilbert’s introductory narration to the first episode insisted, but they were certainly an American family. Hence, they were worth watching as individuals undergoing many of the daily strains and crises that plagued other families. Critics and viewers alike, however, tended to overlook the sociological aspects of An American Family for the far more fascinating spectacle of real people living out their lives on television,6 especially when it came to the on-screen break-up of Pat and Bill Loud’s twenty-year marriage or the revelation that eldest son Lance was gay. As Gail Rock contended in a review for Ms. magazine, the show was ‘more candid than Allen Funt’s wildest dreams’ (cited in Ruoff 2002: 102). The Louds were an affluent and attractive nuclear family, but they were not the idealised family of sitcoms. Craig Gilbert had selected them in part because they lived in California, which Gilbert thought was at the cutting-edge of American culture (Ruoff 2002: 17), and in part because they were educated and promised to be articulate about the social pressures on family life. To some extent the pressures on this nuclear family were standard: with five children aged between thirteen and twenty, the family was prone to disruption by teenage rebellion and the older children’s bids for independence. The pressures were also, however, specific to the changing social mores of the 1970s: while\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 28\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\nBEFORE REALITY TV\n\n29\n\nfather Bill, who owned a concrete company, preached the values of hard work to his long-haired, less-than-motivated sons, mother Pat was the educated but bored housewife targeted by the women’s movement. Lance Loud, the eldest and most opinionated of the children, had already left the family for New York, where he was unemployed and living at the Chelsea Hotel, famed as a centre for artistic and bohemian life. When, in the second episode of the series, Lance ‘came out’ to TV audiences by speaking openly with his mother about being gay, the revelation sent shock waves through viewers. And when, in the ninth episode, Pat asked Bill for a divorce, it became clear that Gilbert had found a family who radically subverted the traditional representations of family life on television while reflecting the shifting family demographics of the early 1970s. Although the series aired in 1973, filming took place two years earlier, for seven months from May to December 1971. This was the first time that a television production team had placed ordinary people under such close scrutiny for such an extended period of time. To capture the lived reality of the family, Gilbert hired husband-and-wife team Susan and Alan Raymond as the film crew, with Susan recording sound and Alan behind the camera. The Raymonds shot the Louds continuously over the seven-month period, producing over 300 hours of film (including the footage from a second camera crew with Lance). Between the hours of 8 am and 10 pm, the Raymonds had uninterrupted access to the Louds, becoming in effect a part of the family. For all intents and purposes, then, the Louds were monitored by a live-in camera whose presence became an accepted part of their intimate domestic space. In keeping with the observational style, Craig Gilbert had counselled the Louds ‘to live their lives as if there were no camera present’, and had told the Raymonds not to intrude, alter or in any way direct events (cited in Ruoff 2002: 27). The crew, in other words, was to be omnipresent but invisible, an expected but ignorable element in the Louds’ daily lives. Bill Loud, appearing with the family on The Dick Cavett Show, said approvingly that the presence of the crew was like having ‘a maid in the house’ (cited in Ruoff 2002: 34), while Pat Loud noted about the Raymonds that ‘[w]e really liked and cared about each other’ (cited in Ruoff 2002: 29). Trust was thus a necessary part of the relationship between subjects and film-makers, as other direct cinema documentarists had found (Ruoff 2002: 29; Ellis and McLane 2005: 215–16), but the depth of the relationship between the Raymonds and the Louds also meant that the crew was unlikely to be invisible. This was to some extent offset by a sense of contractual obligation on the part of the Louds. Even though the family by common consent was\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 29\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\n30\n\nREALITY TV\n\nnot being paid (Ruoff 2002: 27), Pat Loud reflected in her subsequent autobiography on the sense of obligation ‘to live up to our part of the bargain, which was, of course, to try to be as honest and candid as we normally would be had the cameras not been there’ (cited in Ruoff 2002: 35; original emphasis). As Jeffrey Ruoff succinctly notes, the Louds’ job was to live their lives and the Raymonds’ job was to film it (2002: 35). The ‘missing’ year between filming in 1971 and screening in early 1973 was devoted entirely to editing. Although the long takes and wide shots of the observational style allowed the action to unfold ‘without script, without direction’, there was no hope of producing the series ‘with scarcely any editing’ (Ellis and McLane 2005: 218). On the contrary, the editors had to reduce over 300 hours of film into 12 hours of screen time, which meant deciding not only what to cut but also how to arrange the little material that made it to air. Since the family had been filmed over such a long period, numerous events had occurred in causal and seasonal relation to one another, so the editors opted to arrange material chronologically. They thus organised scenes around incidents rather than characters. The result was a multiple-focus and multiple-character narrative that told a coherent story, even if this remained open-ended. The only exception to this editing strategy occurred in the first episode, which opened with on-camera narration by Craig Gilbert describing not only the history of the William C. Loud family and their settlement in Santa Barbara, but also admitting upfront, ‘There is no question that the presence of our camera crews and their equipment had an effect on the Louds, one which is impossible to evaluate’ (TX, 11 January 1973). More striking in the first episode, however, is the editors’ decision to start the story with the last day of shooting. Over the family’s preparations for that evening’s New Year’s Eve party, Gilbert intones, ‘This New Year’s will be unlike any other . . . for the first time, the family will not be spending it together’ – before the camera cuts to a shot of Bill alone in his office. The entire narrative is thus framed by the break-up of the marriage and the rupture of the family. Everything that unfolds thereafter is organised around this climactic moment to come, and the family is represented from the start as a broken family. Even Gilbert’s chirpy voice-over saying ‘our story begins seven months earlier at 6.30 on a late spring morning’ signals the beginning of a story of decline. The decision to book-end the chronological framework with footage of the ruptured family invites comparison with the structure of fictional narratives. Indeed, An American Family is a heterogeneous combination of non-fiction and fiction formats: it is shot in an observational\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 30\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\nBEFORE REALITY TV\n\n31\n\nstyle without direction or script but adapted in post-production to television as a storytelling medium. Given that there was no pre-set genre for this kind of programme, the producer and editors borrowed from existing TV genres in order to make the show more recognisable to viewers. As Ruoff notes, the opening credits sequence for each episode emphasises the series’ connection to television sitcoms by introducing each of the family members to an upbeat theme song and then boxing them into their own space on screen, recalling the openings of The Brady Bunch and The Partridge Family (2002: 67) but also prefiguring the tongue-in-cheek credits of The Osbournes (MTV, 2002–5). Unlike the idealised sitcoms of the 1970s, however, the word ‘family’ cracks at the end of the American Family title sequence, signalling that the family itself is broken. The ongoing disagreements between Bill and his sons about the importance of work, Pat’s morose and sometimes jealous responses to her husband, Lance’s bohemian lifestyle and homosexuality, not to mention the break-up of the parents’ marriage on air – for viewers, this material was recognisable from soap operas, not sitcoms or documentaries. Indeed, the multiple-character narrative and division of the programme into episodes copied the format of soaps, keeping viewers tuning in to see what will happen ‘next time’. The fact that this was a real-life soap, however, shot using the conventions of observational realism, meant that viewers were also reminded they were watching non-fiction. This generic instability led reviewers to compare it to ‘home movies, television commercials, talk shows, variety shows, situation comedies, soap operas, novels, plays, sociological studies and documentaries’ (Ruoff 2002: 108). No one could quite figure out what they were watching, but everyone tuned in to watch. The post-production decisions about editing, screen credits and publicity impacted strongly on how the series was received. By and large, An American Family met with highly critical reviews and negative publicity (although Pat Loud stresses in her autobiography that she received many letters of support from viewers as well). If there was genre confusion among reviewers, there was even greater confusion about where to draw the line between reality and mediated fiction. On the one hand, ‘[t]he open-ended episodic structure of the program, broadcast weekly, accentuated similarities with everyday life and promoted strong identification with the Louds’ (Ruoff 2002: 105). Audiences accepted the Louds as ordinary people like themselves, so much so that ‘most reviewers . . . talked about the Louds as if they were their next-door neighbours’ (Ruoff 2002: 102). On the other hand, the very fact that the Louds were on television raised questions – and invited condemnation – about the effect of the camera on their\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 31\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\n32\n\nREALITY TV\n\nbehaviour. It became a common refrain in reviews and later criticism that the series had caused the Louds to break up, even though Pat Loud asserted in her autobiography that the filming had probably extended the life of the marriage (cited in Ruoff 2002: 111). Similarly Lance Loud was deemed to have come out on TV, as though the presence of the camera had forced the dramatic event, even though Lance’s family had already known for some time he was homosexual. As an anonymous reviewer wrote in America, ‘As this journal of deterioration unfolds . . . might it have been otherwise if there were no camera and no microphone?’ (cited in Ruoff 2002: 117). The suggestion here is clear: the camera is not an observer but an intruder into the family home, causing dramatic ruptures by its very presence. As Ruoff points out, ‘An American Family may best be remembered as a nonfiction program haunted by the presence of the camera’ (2002: 117). More to the point, it is the first non-fiction programme to be haunted by the presence of the live-in camera, which holds out the promise of a more intimate portrait of everyday life while it threatens to distort that everyday life by intervening in it. This tension between reality and mediation is unresolved in the responses to An American Family. Roger Rosenblatt wrote in The New Republic, ‘never was there greater realism on television except in the murders of Oswald and Robert Kennedy’ (cited in Ruoff 2002: 102), while S. I. Hayakama claimed in the Chicago Tribune that the series was ‘a most artificial situation’ (cited in Ruoff 2002: 117). Both responses, of course, were equally true – a paradox that would only be exacerbated as later generations came to ‘live their lives’ on TV. The Family: Realism and Social Class In 1974, influenced by An American Family, producer Paul Watson made the twelve-part series The Family for the BBC in Britain. The series, which screened from early April to late June, brought the live-in camera to the home of the extended Wilkins family in Reading, England. Despite the similarity in episodic structure and observational style to An American Family, there were some notable differences between the two programmes. Most importantly, there was a difference in social class. Whereas the Louds were an affluent family with a sprawling eight-room ranch house and four vehicles in suburban southern California, the Wilkins were a working-class family of nine people living in a small six-room flat above a greengrocer’s shop in an industrial town. Like the Louds, Terry and Margaret Wilkins had children spread across a range of ages, from nine to nineteen, but their\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 32\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\nBEFORE REALITY TV\n\n33\n\nflat was also home to the elder two children’s partners and one grandchild: eighteen-year-old Paul had married his pregnant girlfriend at sixteen, with his small family occupying a room of the Wilkins’s flat, while nineteen-year-old Marion was sharing her bedroom with her boyfriend Tom. Like An American Family, this programme raised controversial social issues, such as pre-marital sex and interracial relationships (fifteen-year-old Heather had a mixed-race boyfriend, Melvin), but the series took a more didactic approach, adding voice-over narration and directorial engagement to the fly-on-the-wall observational style. Moreover, the series began screening during the fourth week of filming, which allowed later episodes to incorporate self-reflexivity about the reception of the programme. Despite these differences, however, the impact of The Family was much the same as that of An American Family: the series was ‘one of the most talked-about documentaries ever shown on television’,7 and the Wilkins became celebrities surrounded by negative publicity. They were vilified in the local, tabloid and broadsheet press for being immoral, immodest and, ultimately, both too real and not real enough. Unlike the Louds’s reception in the US, the mediation of the Wilkins’s lives cast doubt among the British public about the value of the observational domestic gaze. Just as the Louds had been explicitly selected for An American Family because of their social class, the Wilkins were intended to provide an individualised portrait of class-based life in Britain. The difference between the two approaches to class, however, could not be more striking, first, because of the stark difference between the socioeconomic status of the two families and, second, because the issue of class is masked by the myth of self-invention in the American context, whereas in the British context it remains central to social identity. The Louds were chosen primarily because they represented the American dream (Rupert and Puckett 2010); as the pre-screening publicity emphasised, they had a large house, numerous cars, experience as international travellers and a poolside lifestyle in the sunny paradise of southern California. In other words, their affluence and lifestyle were the central components of the dream to which it was presumed all Americans aspired, a dream which had been regularly depicted in idealised family representations on sitcoms since the 1960s. Their class status, as is still the case in American culture, was deemed to be secondary to their material success, although the desirability of their possessions did not prevent the Louds from being demonised in the press as ‘affluent zombies’ (cited in Ruoff 2002: 103). The Wilkins, by contrast, were positioned as ‘ordinary people’ precisely by dint of being working class.

In the UK, the working classes have long served as a cultural signifier of authenticity, and social realist film-makers since John Grierson – often called the father of British documentary film – sought to educate the public about the harsh realities of working-class life so as to bring about social change. The Family adopts a less expository mode than the Griersonian documentaries of the 1930s and 1940s but its implicit claim to the authentic representation of family life has as much to do with the Wilkins’s working-class status as with the fly-on-the-wall technique. In fact, producer Paul Watson was aiming to correct the tendency of television to give airtime only to people who were already ‘somebody’ (Young 1974: 208) by placing on screen the kind of people who were not usually represented (Corner 2004) – the ‘nobodies’ who were authentic because they were ordinary workers. The footage shot for The Family is carefully organised in the early episodes so as to highlight the socio-political themes of everyday working-class life: housing shortages, pregnancy and marriage, schooling, work and income, parenting and domestic responsibilities, and racial tensions. The difference from previous representations of working-class life in Britain, however, lies with the live-in camera, which offers a protracted gaze on the private lives of a family that speaks for and about itself. As Mrs Wilkins makes clear in the first episode about her motivation for taking part in the series: ‘All right, so we get paid . . . but it gives us a chance to portray ordinary people’ (TX, 3 April 1974). Of course, once they appear on television, they become ‘somebodies’ and far from ordinary people, which we now understand to be the contradictory, and often disturbing, effect of television cameras that seek out ordinariness. But already in the 1970s, as Su Holmes argues, ‘Watson was as much interested in how the family would respond to being mediated as he was in reflecting aspects of social life in Britain’ (Holmes 2008b: 202). As in An American Family, the camera (and crew) did not literally live in the house, but it seemed that way: the family was filmed for some sixteen hours a day for three months largely in the confines of their six-room flat. The initial description of the show in The Radio Times did not mince words about the novelty of the programme: ‘The ups and downs of a real life family are captured week by week in this twelve-part documentary serial. The Wilkins family of Reading have a BBC crew living with them’ (cited in Holmes 2008b: 198). This is accentuated in the first episode of the series, when Watson, sitting\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 34\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\nBEFORE REALITY TV\n\n35\n\nwith the family at the kitchen table but remaining off-screen, warns them that ‘we are here all the time, and we can film you anywhere, anytime’ (TX, 3 April 1974). The live-in camera thus promised viewers unparalleled accessibility to and intimacy with everyday life, but this required finding ‘a family prepared to tolerate the intrusion of a film crew into their every private moment’ (opening voice-over, episode 1). In such a small house, the intrusion is palpable; the frame and the space are literally crammed with people. Unlike the ‘human’ point of view favoured by realist documentary, camera angles are often rakishly low or high with people pushed to the sides of the frame as the unseen camera crew presses into what little space is available. The mise-en-scène registers the vibrant but claustrophobic atmosphere of this overcrowded flat, especially in the kitchen, where cooking, eating, dishwashing, hairwashing and laundering compete for space alongside extended conversations and altercations. The notion of intrusiveness as a tool of accessibility and intimacy is accentuated by the opening credits to each episode. The camera moves through a series of dissolves as it swoops from high above the city, across rooftops and chimneys, before entering a window and moving through the lounge to seek out picture frames positioned on the mantelpiece. The pictures consist of black-and-white family shots but the camera then intrudes into the frame itself, animating the subjects into motion in colour, before zooming back out to the family posed for a portrait in the lounge. This title sequence not only promises full revelation as layer after layer of wall, curtain and frame are peeled back but also offers to animate the family for the viewers’ gaze. It is small wonder, then, that the series met with outcries about voyeurism and intrusions on privacy from viewers who felt uncomfortably placed by the promise of live-in access. As Colin Young stated in a contemporary overview of the responses to The Family, ‘There is nothing necessarily subversive about observational cinema. But in the present case it has clearly made people consider where they personally would draw a line between observing and snooping’ (Young 1974: 209). The subject matter of the observational gaze may be authentic but, when the camera lives in, viewers in the 1970s begin to feel uncomfortable about ‘prying into the private lives’ of a family (letter to the editor, cited in Young 1974: 206). To offset this discomfort, the early episodes of the series are organised thematically to introduce each family member as a character with particular concerns that reflect larger social patterns. The second episode, for instance, presents a still of the lodger Tom who, the voiceover informs us, ‘has finally told Margaret that he is not marrying her daughter [Marion] on April 27’, while the third episode starts with a\n\nKAVKA 9780748637225 PRINT.indd 35\n\n21/12/2011 12:26\n\n36\n\nREALITY TV\n\nstill of daughter Heather, who ‘is 15 and hates school’, and the fourth episode introduces"
