        "text": "Stephen Hawking: One can see from space how the human race has changed the Earth. Nearly all of the available land has been cleared of forest and is now used for agriculture or urban development. The polar icecaps are shrinking and the desert areas are increasing. At night, the Earth is no longer dark, but large areas are lit up. All of this is evidence that human exploitation of the planet is reaching a critical limit. But human demands and expectations are ever-increasing. We cannot continue to pollute the atmosphere, poison the ocean and exhaust the land. There isn't any more available.\n\nDavid Suzuki - Scientist, Environmentalist, Broadcaster: Economists don't include all of the things that nature does for us for nothing. Some technologies would never be able to do what nature does. For example, pollinating all of the flowering plants. What would it cost us to take carbon dioxide out of the air and put oxygen back in, which all the green things do for us for nothing? It's possible to do a crude estimate of what it would cost us to replace nature. Well, it turns out,\n\n[one researcher]\n\nDavid Suzuki - Scientist, Environmentalist, Broadcaster: estimated it would cost us $35 trillion a year to do what nature is doing for us for nothing. Now to put that in perspective. If you had added up all of the annual economies of all the countries in the world at that time, it would come to $18 trillion. So, nature is doing twice as much service for us as the economies of the world. And in the madness of conventional economics, this is not in the equation.\n\n[last lines]\n\nOren Lyons: What if we choose to eradicate ourselves from this Earth, by whatever means? The Earth goes nowhere. And in time, it will regenerate, and all the lakes will be pristine. The rivers, the waters, the mountains, everything will be green again. It'll be peaceful. There may not be people, but the Earth will regenerate. And you know why? - Because the Earth has all the time in the world and we don't. So I think that's where we're at, right now.\n\nWes Jackson: It's not just global warming. It's not just fossil-fuel dependency. It's not just soil erosion It's not just chemical contamination of our land and water. It's not just the population problem. And it's not just all of those. - The deterioration of the environment of our planet is an outward mirror of an inner condition. - Like inside, like outside. And that's a part of the Great Work."
