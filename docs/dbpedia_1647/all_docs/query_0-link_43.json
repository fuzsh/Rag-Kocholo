        "text": "Heroes and Villains. BBC1. 2 Feb 1995\n\nOut of Town. Meridian. 1993\n\nI’ve mentioned previously that the irony of keeping a recording of something is that it results, more often than not, in actually watching it less. Not so the first programme on this tape.\n\nAn episode of a largely forgotten series about British adventurers shown in 1995 and never repeated. Had I not recorded and kept this tape I would have only seen it once, instead of the several dozen times I actually have.\n\nHeroes and Villains: Full Throttle (Genome)\n\nAs I write this learned reviewers are debating Rowan Atkinson’s ability to play a straight role following the début last weekend of Maigret, but his portrayal of real-life “Bentley Boy” Tim Birkin in Full Throttle pre-dates this by over 20 years.\n\nA contemporary review in Motorsport magazine complained of historical inaccuracy and unauthentic locations, noting:\n\n“The possible availability of the genuine single-seater blower-4½ Bentley with which Sir Henry broke the Brooklands lap record was seemingly ignored, but Stanley Mann brought his ex-Birkin 3-litre, and the blower 4½ GY 3904, whose first owner was G R Handley, not Birkin…”\n\nI can’t read that without hearing an adenoidal voice.\n\nFor me it’s a great story and features some splendid action scenes with fabulous cars (even if not always, apparently, the right ones). Clearly the budget was modest by modern standards – no doubt a remake today would fill in an entire CGI circuit of Tripoli, for instance, rather than the “studio palms” that so offended the Motorsport reviewer – but that’s academic because there won’t be a remake.\n\nIn its closing paragraph Motorsport conceded “A good enough bit of drama for the TV viewing public…” which I think is really the point. For an hour on BBC1 the world of 1930’s motor racing was brought alive in a prime time drama and the lives of some unsung British heroes shown to a mainstream audience. That’s nostalgia in itself.\n\nI had always thought Heroes & Villains was series of six (probably because 6 different “picture cards” are shown in the opening titles) but with the benefit of BBC Genome I find that there were actually only two other episodes listed in Radio Times:\n\nQueen of the East, Jennifer Saunders as Lady Hester Stanhope (Genome)\n\nThe Last Englishman, Jim Broadbent as Colonel AD Wintle (Genome)\n\n…neither of which I recorded, somewhat regrettably.\n\nOut of Town\n\nOn the rest of the tape some more of the “made for video” episodes of Jack Hargreaves’ series, as broadcast by Meridian. The episode titles written on a slip of paper in the tape’s box are:\n\nLambing / Mayfly\n\nSheep Shearing / Bream\n\nKingfishers / Model Boats\n\nKent: Iron and Charcoal / Lobsters\n\nKidney Onions / Blandford / Rivers\n\nBeing from the first transmission they lack the credit for cameraman Stan Brehaut, an omission that was later rectified (see tape 169).\n\nA rather tatty (well used) BASF tape.\n\nITN News item. ITV. 9-Jun-1993\n\nGMTV.\n\nSouthern Gold Series 1. Meridian.\n\nEpisode 1. Countryside. 24-May-1993\n\nEpisode 2. Houseparty. 7-Jun-1993\n\nEpisode 4. News. 21-Jun-1993\n\nEpisode 5. Music & Entertainment. 28-Jun-1993\n\nEpisode 6. Children’s. 5-July-1993\n\nNews At Ten.\n\nA report from the Isle of Man TT races on an alarming rise in the death rate amongst the spectators.\n\nGMTV.\n\nFern Britton at the helm in this (presumably) 1993 edition. Nothing in it to give me any clues as to when or even why it was recorded at all, let alone kept.\n\nThere then follows an almost complete run of the first series of Southern Gold, Meridian’s Nostalgic interview and archive footage series hosted by Fred Dinenage.\n\n“Looking back at the 24 carat clips from the Southern Television archives;\n\na nostalgic trip down our local Memory Lane for anyone who remembers\n\nWorzel Gummidge, Houseparty, Jack Hargreaves or The Trevor Baker All\n\nWeather Show”.\n\nOnly episode 3 on Sport (14-Jun-1993) is missing, although I’ve since got hold of it.\n\nSouthern Gold (S01E01) – Countryside\n\nThe first programme of the series features clips of countryside related programmes including Kite’s Country and, of course, Out Of Town. Guest: Jack Hargreaves.\n\nSouthern Gold (S01E02) – Houseparty / Women\n\nIf you’re looking for Noel Edmonds, look elsewhere! This is the original Houseparty.\n\nPart one celebrates Southern Television’s long running women’s magazine programme Houseparty with a number of clips and interviews.\n\nA varied mix of items in part two includes royal visits; Diana Dors’ chat show; and the story of Caroline Grace who learnt to fly her husband’s beloved Spitfire after his tragic death in a motor accident. Guests: Ann Ladbury, Cherry Marshall, Daphne Lee and Sylvia Marshall\n\nSouthern Gold (S01E04) – News\n\nA look back at Southern Television’s news coverage. Includes the great train robbers,\n\nthe Falklands war and the story of a young man who spent six months searching for\n\nhis dog. Guest: Alastair Stewart\n\nSouthern Gold (S01E05) – Entertainment\n\n“The secret of success is rubbish”\n\nTony Blackburn, radio personality and DJ, recalls how he started his career.\n\nAlso vintage footage of the Trevor Baker All Weather Show. Guest: Tony Blackburn\n\nSouthern Gold (S01E06) – Children’s\n\nSome rattles from the Southern Gold toy cupboard. Una Stubbs shares her memories of Worzel Gummidge. Archive clips of How includes one of Fred’s legendary failures (see if you can lip read his exclamation!). Standard Southern fare such as Freewheelers, The Famous Five and Flockton Flyer are included plus some rarer clips from Saturday Banana, On Safari and Runaround. Guest: Una Stubbs.\n\nAnd so ends series 1. A single episode from series 2, again featuring Jack Hargreaves, is on tape 146.\n\nAnother Super Premium Standard Panasonic High Power videocassette.\n\nA City Saved. Meridian. Jan-1994\n\nSouthern Gold. Meridian. 15-Mar-1994\n\nA Tribute to Jack Hargreaves. Meridian. 28-Mar-1994\n\nMeridian News item.\n\nTour de France. Various.\n\nA very local theme to all the recordings on this tape.\n\nA City Saved.\n\nA 30 minute documentary by Meridian about the flooding in Chichester, West Sussex. A copy of the full programme can be found on the West Sussex Fire & Rescue Service channel on YouTube.\n\nSouthern Gold. S02E04.\n\nThis is the only episode I recorded from series 2 of Meridian’s nostalgia series, but it is an iconic programme. It features, in the words of host Fred Dinenage “two of Southern Television’s most popular programmes: Out of Town and How“.\n\nAfter some vintage clips Fred tells us, somewhat prophetically, that “Jack has agreed to do just one more episode of Out of Town“. A segment recorded at Jack Hargreaves’ Dorset home precedes a studio interview. After the break, there are archive clips of children’s show How ahead of a reunion of Fred and Jack with the two other How presenters, Bunty James and Jon Miller.\n\nThe show finishes with a piece about Southern Television’s religious output.\n\nThe programme was transmitted on 13 March 1994 and this article later in the week reflects the poignancy of the broadcast:\n\nObiturary: Jack Hargreaves.\n\nAt 6.30pm on Tuesday evening, viewers in the Meridian television area saw another revival, with Hargreaves presenting a final edition of Out of Town as part of a programme called Southern Gold. The five-minute segment was recorded at the end of January in response to viewers’ demands to see Hargreaves on screen again. He was interviewed by Fred Dinenage and reunited with his other original How? co-presenters Bunty James and Jon Miller.\n\n‘Things are still as they used to be,’ he said, in his ‘potting shed’. ‘I still spend about half my life in the shed, particularly in wintertime. I still can’t resist mending things that were busted 50 or 60 years ago and I still can’t throw anything away.’\n\nAt 7.30pm on Tuesday, shortly after the programme finished, Hargreaves was dead, taking with him a love of traditional rural life that did much to enhance viewers’ appreciation of country ways.\n\nIndependent (17 Mar 1994)\n\nInevitably the next recording on the tape is…\n\nA Tribute to Jack Hargreaves.\n\nPresented by Fred Dinenage and broadcast by Meridian on 28 March 1994.\n\nThere follows a 2 minute local news item about a Midhurst man awarded the OBE.\n\nTour de France.\n\nThree different reports covering the south of England leg of the 1994 tour.\n\nA Memorex E-195 tape which seems to have been acquired from my parents, my mother’s “label on the box” cataloguing system reveals that Great Train Journeys was sacrificed.\n\nOut of Town – Tide Mill / Ice fishing in Kent.\n\nA Week to Remember. BBC2. Feb 1997\n\nOne Foot in the Past. BBC. 6 Aug 1997\n\nTime Team Live. C4. 23-25 Aug 1997\n\nOut of Town. Another one of the 1986 Contender video editions as seen on tape 169.\n\nIn this one Jack Hargreaves describes how a tide mill works with the use of chalk, some small boxes and a sheet of plywood balanced on a Black & Decker Workmate. We then go to some footage of Jack visiting such a mill at Eling in Hampshire.\n\nThese programmes reused location films shot for the original Out of Town programmes between 1969 and 1981. Included in this one is an aerial sequence over the Solent and up Southampton Water to Eling creak … quite ambitious by Southern Television standards.\n\nNext A Week To Remember.\n\nTwo 10 minute compilations of Pathé newsreels from forty years previously .i.e. the last week of February 1957. A period that I found worth recording for reasons that need not concern you. Genome\n\nContinuing the history theme with One Foot in the Past. An edition from the fifth series looking at England’s history and heritage. Introduced by Kirsty Wark.\n\nI have the full programme which comprised:\n\n‘Manchester Pub’\n\nOld Wellington Tudor pub in Manchester moving 200 yards.\n\n‘Heritage Heroes’\n\nDorothy Smith, Shop Assistant. Ightham Mote, Kent.\n\n‘Monumentalism’\n\nAlexander Stoddart argues for a return to the heroic and triumphal.\n\n‘Ruin of the Week’\n\nThe old museum, Ipswich\n\n‘Bosham’\n\nAvengers star Patrick Macnee returns to his secret sixties hideaway in sleepy\n\nBosham by the sea.\n\nBeing a big fan of The Avengers (as will probably become evident in due course) as well as an occasional visitor to ‘sleepy’ Bosham, it was this last item that caused me to record and keep the programme. Genome.\n\nFinally Time Team Live, the first ever…\n\nbroadcast over the August bank holiday 1997 from the site of a Roman occupation at Turkdean, Gloucestershire. It features the usual team plus Bill Oddie at the finds table.\n\nAnother BBC tape (they must have been on offer).\n\nAn epic collection that defies categorisation.\n\nRuby Does The Season: Polo. Meridian. 1995\n\nHeroes of Comedy: Terry-Thomas. C4. 17-Nov-1995\n\nPerfect Day. BBC\n\nDavid Jason – In His Element. ITV. 1997\n\nMagic’s Biggest Secrets (x3).\n\n40 Years of ITV in the South. Meridian. 30-Aug-1998\n\nCaptain Pugwash. CITV. 25-Sep-1998\n\nThe handwritten label suggests there are 5 1/2 hours of programmes and the tape itself has even more with a couple of unexpected additions. Clearly a lot of long-play here.\n\nFirstly Ruby Does The Season.\n\nA largely forgotten Ruby Wax fronted series from 1995 which doesn’t even have an IMDB entry. In this episode Ruby investigates the world of Polo. Made by Meridian, as presumably were the other programmes in the series.\n\nNext a profile of the comic actor Terry-Thomas\n\nfrom the Heroes of Comedy series made by Thames Television for Channel 4. This episode broadcast on 17-Nov-1995.\n\nA full length edition of the “Perfect Day” BBC promo\n\nprecedes a Yorkshire Television programme following David Jason as he indulges in his passion for sea life. IMDB\n\nUnfortunately this cuts out after part one, over recorded by 3 long-play episodes of …\n\n… subtitled Cracking The Magician’s Code. A rare example of U.S. programmes in my collection, and even rarer (possibly unique) is that episode 1 has been recorded from Sky.\n\nThat completes the programmes written on the label but the tape carries on with Fred Dinenage and friends celebrating 40 Years of ITV in the South (also in LP).\n\nDirected by Nick Knowles and filmed on the West Sussex preserved railway the Bluebell line, it covers 40 years of Southern, TVS and Meridian programming with archive clips and interviews. “Here’s to the next forty years” concludes Fred.\n\nIf only.\n\nThis is followed by some CITV continuity with Stephen Mulhern and Danielle Nicholls, around an episode of Captain Pugwash which a YouTube user tells me is from 25-Sep-1998.\n\nThe recording cuts out with Bernard’s Watch and reverts to a programme from Sky about prisoners in the U.S., presumably run on from the earlier Magic Secrets programme.\n\nAnother BBC cassette but the box is wrong. Clearly a wholesale rehousing of tapes into boxes occurred at some time, the BASF box contains a TV Times clip for episode 3 of T.V. Heaven which means it almost certainly once held tape 73.\n\nThis transfer marks a minor project milestone. Working from the most recent tapes backwards this is the first time I’ve encountered material processed in one of my previous digitising efforts that went in the other direction. I originally transferred Ruby Does the Season in March 2009 and Heroes of Comedy in September 2008.\n\nOut Of Town – Branding / Cider\n\nOut Of Town – Bee Skips / Pheasant Shoot\n\nOut Of Town – Appleby Horse Fair / Rams\n\nOut Of Town – Market / Minnows / Lobster Fishing\n\nOut Of Town – Brick Making / Stonehenge\n\nVarious time-shift (details further down)\n\nTo avoid any undue excitement from the outset these are not original episodes. For an overview of the various incarnations of Out Of Town you could do worse than have a quick peek at yesterday’s post about Jack Hargreaves.\n\nIn 1986 after a long broadcasting career Jack entered semi-retirement with a set of VHS releases. These were compiled from original 16 mm location films, some of them going back to 1969, bought from Southern Television with new links and commentary recorded at Jack’s Dorset home.\n\nIn 1994 Meridian television started to broadcast these reconstructed episodes and five of them are on this tape, recorded on a repeat run in 1996.\n\nThere are a couple of minor differences between these recordings and the Contender videos. Firstly, each video segment begins with a title caption which isn’t present in the broadcast version.\n\nAnd the position of Stan Bréhaut’s name in the closing credits differs. Stan was a staff cameraman for Southern Television and as well as all the filming for Out Of Town he also filmed for news reports and numerous Southern programmes, including the much loved children’s adventure series Freewheelers.\n\nWhen these Contender episodes were first broadcast by Meridian, Stan was a little miffed to see that he hadn’t received a credit – understandably given that every piece of film in the programmes had been shot by him. With Jack’s help the situation was resolved and Stan gets first billing as the credits scroll across the bottom of the screen on these later transmissions. On the reissued DVDs there is a static caption at the end.\n\nIn both cases his name is in his preferred abbreviated form of Stan and with the accent in place on Bréhaut, something he had never managed to get the caption writers at Southern to achieve!\n\nWhen Contender Group reissued the videos on DVD in 2004 they labelled the first two discs “original series as seen on TV“, which is half true at best. The remaining seven discs made no such claim. For their part, on one example on this tape, Meridian claimed the programme as their own.\n\nThe final edition “Brick Making and Stonehenge” was only very recently released by Delta Leisure as a DVD and even then only as part of the 10 disc box set. Soon afterwards Delta went into administration, consequently this particular episode is pretty scarce.\n\nThe tape then carries on to an advert break and the ends of previous temporary recordings:\n\nAdverts and trailers\n\nA Drop of Digance\n\nGlorious Goodwood\n\nCBBC continuity around Tom & Jerry\n\nDalziel & Pascoe\n\nAuf Wiedersehen, Pet\n\nThe trailers are for an early Nick Knowles’ show for Meridian called RidgeRiders:\n\nand an upcoming Channel 4 series Moving People …\n\n… a reality show about moving house fronted, rather implausibly, by John Peel.\n\nThen there is the briefest glimpse of a young Tim Vine on stage in A Drop Of Digance.\n\nFollowed by more time-shift ends: Racing from Goodwood; Tom & Jerry on CBBC; Dalziel & Pascoe; and another Auf Wiedersehen, Pet.\n\nAlmost unbelievably it’s another standard tape in a BASF Chrome Cassette box, together with an incomplete note of the tape contents.\n\nSay what you will\n\nThe countryside is still\n\nThe only place where I could settle down\n\nTroubles there are so much rarer\n\nOut of town\n\nBefore the next tape, a short primer on the work of Jack Hargreaves.\n\n1960-1981. Southern TV Out of Town.\n\nJack made around 800 editions of Out of Town, a 30 minute programme about life in the country, for Southern Independent Television.\n\nIn each programme Jack would make an introduction from a set built to look like shed in Southern’s Northam studios and then provide an unscripted commentary over a 5-10 minute piece of location film about a country pursuit.\n\nAfter a commercial break the second half would mirror the first, sometimes continuing the theme but more often on a completely different subject. The location filming was by Southern cameraman Stan Bréhaut using a handheld Arriflex 16mm camera.\n\n1983-1985. Channel 4 Old Country.\n\nWhen Southern Television lost its franchise at the end of 1981, Jack was commissioned to continue the programme for Channel 4 and a total of 60 more were made under the new title Old Country.\n\nThe same shed set used at Southern was set up in the village hall at Meonstoke in Hampshire, complete with fittings such as roll top desk and pot bellied stove to match the originals as closely as possible.\n\nLocation filming for these programmes was by Steve Wagstaff.\n\n1986. Contender Videos\n\nWhen Old Country finished Jack produced a series 28 programmes for the VHS video market under the original title Out of Town.\n\nThis time the introductions and links were made from a real shed, his own at his home in Dorset.\n\nThere was no new location filming for these. Instead Jack obtained what remained of Stan Bréhaut’s original 16 mm films from Southern Television which were re-edited and a new commentary recorded in Jack’s front room. One of the side-effects of using these films that were up to 15 years old is the noticeable change in Jack’s appearance between his shed and the great outdoors.\n\nSo to summarise, in chronological order:\n\nSouthern Out of Town\n\nChannel 4 Old Country\n\nContender Out of Town videos\n\n(Yes I know this is ignoring Jack’s other TV work such as Gone Fishing, Country Boy, Country Visit, HOW…. perhaps some other time).\n\nSo far, so straightforward. But then in came Delta Leisure to muddy the waters.\n\nWhen it comes to commercial releases of these programmes obviously the first, and most prevalent, of these are the Contender videos; they were after all specifically made for the retail market.\n\nOver the years they appeared in various guises, firstly on VHS cassette and then DVD. When Delta took over the rights they repackaged them and sold them through a variety of outlets such as garden centres and Edinburgh Woollen Mill shops. A box set of 10 was also produced.\n\nThese, to recap, these were not original broadcast programmes even though Delta put the Southern TV logo on the boxes.\n\nThen in 2012 the master tapes of 34 original and complete Southern Out of Town episodes were discovered. These programmes, not broadcast since 1980/81, were also given a DVD release as “The Lost Episodes”. However, and against all advice to the contrary, Delta elected to market these 34 episodes as a set of 10 DVDs in almost identical packaging to the Contender videos:\n\nSpot the difference!\n\nBoth these sets went on sale as individual DVDs in the same outlets, no wonder buyers were confused. We can be very grateful to Delta Leisure for issuing these masterpieces but why they didn’t clearly differentiate between the two sets is a complete mystery. Regrettably Delta Leisure went into receivership in 2015 so supplies are now becoming scarce.\n\nIf you want to know more about Jack and Out of Town I recommend you look at the Wikipedia article and the Facebook page administered by Jack’s stepson Simon Baddeley (and where incidentally you can also find out about the Old Country DVDs not touched on here).\n\nThere’s no test but I will refer back to this post sooner or later. Actually sooner and later."
