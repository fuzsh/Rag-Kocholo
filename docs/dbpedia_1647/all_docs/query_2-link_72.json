        "text": "Science-y crime dramas Life on Mars and Eleventh Hour are duking it out to dominate TV's plum 10 p.m. Thursday time slot. The shows have a lot in common: Both are based on U.K. miniseries; both feature a crime fighter aided by a beautiful blonde colleague; both premiered Oct. 9.\n\nBut that's where things diverge. In ABC's Life on Mars, a time-traveling cop (Irish actor Jason O'Mara, pictured above left) catches bad guys with help from Gretchen Mol (The Notorious Bettie Page). CBS' Eleventh Hour teams a brainy biophysicist (British actor Rufus Sewell, pictured above right) with Marley Shelton (Death Proof) as high-tech sleuths.\n\nDoes science trample time travel in this prime-time face-off? We've put together a five-round, voting-enabled smackdown to get your take on which show is breaking new ground.\n\nClick on the head next to the best argument in each round.\n\nABC's Life on Mars and CBS' Eleventh Hour air Thursdays at 10 p.m.\n\nPhotos courtesy ABC, CBS\n\nSee also:\n\nRufus Sewell Channels Brainy Biophysicist for Eleventh Hour\n\nABC Rediscovers Life on Mars\n\nSci-Fi Sanctuary Makes Leap From Web to TV\n\nTV's Killer App: Social Video Viewing?\n\nFall TV Preview: Time Travel, Vampires and Weird Science\n\nThe 40 Best Shows on Max (aka HBO Max) Right Now\n\nHouse of the Dragon, The Sopranos, and Industry are just a few of the shows you need to be watching on Max this month.\n\nThe 52 Best Shows on Disney+ Right Now\n\nArctic Ascent With Alex Honnold, X-Men ’97, and Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures are just a few of the shows you should be watching on Disney+ this month.\n\nThe 55 Best Shows on Netflix Right Now\n\nThe Boyfriend, The Decameron, and Kleo are just a few of the shows you need to watch on Netflix this month.\n\nThe 42 Best Shows on Hulu Right Now\n\nThe Bear, Futurama, and Solar Opposites just a few of the shows you should be watching on Hulu this month.\n\nNBC’s Olympics Broadcast Isn’t Just Addictive.
