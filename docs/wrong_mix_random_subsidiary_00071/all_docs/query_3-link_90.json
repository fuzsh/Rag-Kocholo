        "text": "The aim of the paper is to compare the decision making process on VAT increases in Japan in 1988 and 2012. While Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru managed to achieve this difficult task without breaking the unity of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Prime Minister Noda Yoshihiko’s endeavors ended in a series of defections from the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). By using the example of VAT increase, I draw broader conclusions on the differences between the traditional decision making processes in the LDP and the strategy employed by Noda administration. I argue that Noda tried to emulate the consensus-seeking practices (nemawashi) of the LDP, but he could not rely on unofficial policymaking mechanisms to preserve intraparty harmony. In order to convince LDP backbenchers to VAT increase in 1988 Prime Minister Takeshita made a maximum use of his position as the leader of the largest LDP faction and his personal influence among the Japanese politicians and bureaucrats. While the LDP had elaborated a clear set of principles for behind-the-scenes negotiations, the DPJ started experimenting with decision making mechanisms only after having assumed power in 2009. Lack of transparence of advance screening process and arbitrary decisions imposed by the DPJ Policy Research Committee Chairperson Maehara Seiji met with opposition from the anti-mainstream groups in the ruling party and triggered a series of splits.\n\nWhile drawing on theoretical arguments from media studies and cultural sociology, this thesis addresses the role of scandal in postwar Japan. I present an outline of what can be labeled as scandalogy, and introduce the historical background of scandal in Japan and the West. Furthermore, I locate the social phenomena of transgression and scandal in a wider field of social practice, and provide a theoretical package for critical analysis of media scandal as framed narrative and spectacular (pseudo)event. While utilizing the scope of contemporary neofunctionalist thought, I approach the general function of scandal as a social drama and cultural performance, semantically located between ritual (motivated expressive behavior) and strategy (conscious strategic action). After addressing the role of scandal, media and corruption in Japanese postwar society, I closely elaborate on three selected scandals: the Sakai Noriko celebrity scandal (2009), the Ozawa Ichirō political scandal (2009-12), and the corporate scandal of the Olympus Corporation (2011-12). Based on the output from these case studies, I offer theoretical implications for the scandal mediation process in contemporary Japan, while highlighting the modi operandi of the mainstream media, weekly tabloids, and other outside media as the key players in a scandal-network of collusion and collaboration. Furthermore, I develop a model of scandal mediation in Japan, during which the mainstream media, the power elites, the business circles, and other interdependent forces intersect in sociopolitical and journalistic fields of struggle. While approaching media scandal as a commercialized product of the journalistic rituals of objectivity, I also touch upon the performance of scandal as a mediatized ritual of pollution, purification through exclusion, and reintegration. My basic assumption is that scandal is a multifaceted social phenomenon: while simultaneously serving the interests of capitalistic media institutions, the scandal-rituals define social norms, reflect the values of society, and manage social transgression. If exposed, Japanese scandals represent highly popular media commodities, but they do not prevent future elite deviance, and they do not make the collusion of power structures in Japan more transparent.\n\nThe decision-making process in Japan has been characterized by extensive powers possessed by the bureaucrats who often overshadowed their political superiors. Foreign policy making was not an exception. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) boasted strong control over Japan’s diplomacy. While the role of civil servants was theoretically limited to the implementation of the decisions made by politicians, in reality the administrative staff used a range of informal sources of power to act as arbiters of state matters. Only after the entry into force of Hashimoto’s administrative reform in 2001 did top-level decision makers gain new institutional tools that helped them to conduct an independent foreign policy on a more regular basis. Without denying this conventional wisdom, I argue that the politicians could occasionally play a significant role in Japan’s diplomacy even before implementation of institutional changes at the beginning of the 21st century. Under special circumstances, prime ministers, chief cabinet secretaries and foreign ministers were able to exert a considerable influence on the course of foreign policy, sometimes even changing its direction. Up to the 1990s the most influential figures in the government had enough authority to overcome the domination of the bureaucrats and impose their own will on MOFA.\n\nFirst of all we wish to reveal certain universally-structuralist qualities, same as culturally-relative features of scandals and their mediation in a non-Western society. Secondly, we will illuminate how the mass media take active part in processing political issues in Japan, where as anywhere else in the media-saturated modern industrial world politicians significantly depend on the media (and vice versa); where political live shows and news programs – including scandals – became an important force, at times driving public sentiment while eventually generating support for opposition; and where wealth and its surplus is inevitably tied to a higher potential to grasp and secure power. We will then proceed to the main part of the paper, where we focus more closely on Japanese political scandals whereby preparing theoretical ground for a discourse analysis in the scandal case study of Ozawa Ichirō – one of the most powerful political heavyweights, and simultaneously one of the epitomes of political corruption in Japan. 1 In our endeavor we were motivated by the fact that there exists plethora of literature on scandals in the west, but a detailed media discourse analysis of Japanese scandals is still lacking in academia worldwide."
