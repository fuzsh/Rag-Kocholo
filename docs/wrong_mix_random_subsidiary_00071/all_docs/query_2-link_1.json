        "text": "Tanaka Kakuei (born May 4, 1918, Kariwa, Niigata prefecture, Japan—died Dec. 16, 1993, Tokyo) was a politician who was prime minister of Japan from 1972 to 1974 and who subsequently became the central figure in a major political scandal.\n\nTanaka was the only son of a bankrupt cattle dealer. He dropped out of school at the age of 15 and soon opened his own construction firm, the Tanaka Civil Engineering Company. His business prospered during World War II, largely because of military contracts, and he became one of the richest men in Japan. Entering politics, he was elected to a seat in the lower house of the Diet (parliament) in 1947 and rose rapidly through the ranks of the powerful Liberal-Democratic Party to become minister of postal services and communications in 1957. Resigning from that post in 1958, he then served as minister of finance from 1962 to 1964. He became one of his party’s most powerful politicians and was made secretary-general of the party in 1965 and again in 1968.\n\nAfter serving as minister of international trade and industry in the cabinet of Satō Eisaku, prime minister from 1964 to 1972, Tanaka succeeded the latter in a surprising upset victory over Satō’s chosen successor, the former foreign minister Fukuda Takeo. Tanaka was a vigorous and popular prime minister; he pushed through many government projects and was responsible for economically revitalizing much of western Japan. He also established diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China. Japan’s economic growth slowed and inflation rose during his time in office, however, and in the elections of July 1974 his party made a poor showing. These problems, added to charges that he had profited illegally by means of his office, led to his resignation in December 1974."
