[A) It all depends an what the ~'ukuda faction does. [B] E'ukuda will not say OK to Nikaido. - [C] That isn't inevitable. The Fukuda faction would ~oin if Shinta.r.o Abe is mad~ secretary general and then follows Nikaido. - [Question] Could the election be won with a Nikaido government? 1 - FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070051-4 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-04850R000400070051-4 - FOR OFFICLAL USE ONLY ~ [C] If the election can't be won wi,th a Nilcaido goyexnment, it can~t be won _ with either Nakasone ox ~ukuda. There is no xeason why the electfon can'~ be won with Nikaido. [Question] But if \"dirty\" gov~rnment official Nikaido becomes prime minister... [CJ There are no politicians who would say he is dirty. [Question] That may be so in the world of professionals, but from the view of the general voters, it would be distasteful for a dirty official to become prime minister. [C] Yet, Kakuei Tanaka about whom that has been written so much is now the most popular with the people. [B] Being popular and being supported are not the sam?e thing. If Kakuei comes forth, people will be brought out, but the votes won't be bxought in. _ [C] When it is seen that Dietmembers for who m the election is more important _ than iife are joining the Tanaka faction in great numbers like the feces of ~oldfish, it means he is popular with the people after all. Inviting Kakuei's Popularity [Question] In short, would yo~ like t~ have Kakuei Tanaka come to give a speech supporting your campaign when you are campaigning for el~ection? [C] Everyone wants him to come. [Question] But is the result clear from this past Tokyo metropolitan election? [C] A metropolitan election is somewhat different. That is, the present executiv~ committee wasn't very agressive. Therefore, the Tanaka faction has taken responsibility for all the weak fellows. It is said that the rate of the Tanaka faction's wins was small but the Tanaka faction had the great- est number elected. It just says it took resï¿½ponsibility for doubtful fellows who were unable to have anyone care for them. If a public opinion poll were conducted now on who should be the next prime minister, the answer would be overwhelmingly for Kakuei. (B] A que3tionnaire was given at the Surugadai Prep School on whom would ~ you most like to hear. The first would be Kakuei Tanaka and the second, Ryoichi Sasagawa. [A] He may place somewhere in a public opinion poll, but I don't think he would be overwhelmingly number one. [C:] No, no, There's no double he would be first, and I think he would be far ahead of the number two person. 2 FOR OFFICIAL TJSE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070051-4 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2407/42/09: CIA-RDP82-00854R000440070051-4 FOR OFF . [C~uPStion] What is it about hi.~ that makes you have auch expectat~ons of him? [C] His strong politics. Because of the prese:zt poor economic situation. [Questionl However, didn't Tanaka bring on extremely high prices of commodi- ties, and that proved fatal to fiim? - (C] Didn't the people understand it wasn't Kakuei's fault ~ut that Arab oil prices went o~p? [Question] Oil prices went up but in addition, he incited a speculation c-raze with his \"plan for the reconstruction of the archipelago\" and that was reflect- ed in the market. - (CJ There is no other nation in ti~e world but Japan where prices didn't go up that much even though 2 dollar oil went to 35-36 dollars. The people real- ized that. [D] However, Mr. C., once there was certainly a cry, Kakuei shuuld come _ forth,\" when there was widespread economic depression,'but recently we don't hear that. It is recognized that economic depression is not something re- lated to the policies and judgment of one politician but is determined by the international state of affairs such as the Arab question. [A] Well, Kakuei's popularity comes from the fact that politics is not very - inter.esting right now. [B] That's right. There is no other attractive politician. [A] So, tlaat is the responsibility of the new leaders. From the mid-40's to the late 50's there were politicians who hore the expectation~ flf the people, such as Ichiro Kono, Yasuhiro Nakasone and Hakuei Ishida. But now - there is no politician with such popularity with the people. [C] Don't the people have the feeling that only Kakuei has the vigor to do what should be done for the country and speaks out, for example, on what should be the relationship with the opposition parties and what should the policies be. [AJ Once there were popular supra-partisan politicians in the opposition _ parties, suciz as Inajiro Asanuma. The present popularity of Kakuei is similar to a Inajiro Asanuma style popularity. - [B~ That's right. On the other hand, it is also like the strength of Ichiro Kon~. Unfortunately, there is not even one other pers~?n besides Kakue~. Michio Watanabe, Lone Wolf [A] In .~ssence, I think it is Nakasone who should have the popularity now. 3 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY ~ APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070051-4 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-04850R000400070051-4 rvn urr~~ï¿½w u.+.. v...~~ ~ .

Yow tfiat tfie handsome fellow ~ with the young man's topknct has become bald, you can't very well call him handsome. (Laughter) [B] About the time he was the leader of the young men, this man was not ~ called an opportunist. ' [A] He wasn`t called that. He was someone who gave the image of being ex- tremely militant. [C) He was the most splendid when he was rampaging under Ichiro Kono. ~ [B) Next tr~ Kaku~ei, isn't it Michio Watanabe who is the topic of barbershop political conversations? [A] That's right. But won't the time come when the people gradually get tired if his talk is simply interesting? Where is the difference between Kakuei and Michio Watanabe? [D] Watanabe doesn't have Lockheed! (Laughter) [B] Kakuei Tanaka now has ï¿½allen from being \"imperial adviser\" to accused defendant, and that is the literary, or historical, narrative of the mutabili- ; ty of life. But in the case of Michio Watanabe, it is as though Hitotsubashi ~ University is making the talk interesting. ~ (.r,] Michio Watanabe's p~pularity came from his seeking a quarrel with tne medical association.which was taboo; and as for where is Michio Watanabe's - excellence, it is only his quarrel with the medical a~sociation. [BJ One more positive point of Michio Wata:~abe is that he appears on TV , and speaks intelligibly on such subjects as public finance and medical insur- ance, and makes politics familiar to the people. Quarrels and commentaries ---those two points, right? [Ques*_ion] His services were greatly conducive to the zero ceiling decision in this special. session on administrative reform. - [B] I think so too. [C] But he is, after all, just a lone wolf. He is not a person who will move up. He is not someone who can gather together people and build up power. - He is in the category of Monjiro Kogarashi and others; he won't be a Hidegoro Omaeda. 4 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY , APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070051-4 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-04850R000400070051-4 FOR OFFICIAI,, USE ONLY ~ [BJ I don`t think that'ï¿½s quite r~.ght.

Rokusuke Tanaka, Prominent Political Fundraiser [C] Nakagawa waged his own flesh and blood in this past election; at any rate for 2 csr 3 supporters. [B] Compared to Nakagawa, isn*t Watanabe too intelligent and cunnin~ and causes others to exercise caution? jC] Isn't it ~ust the opposite. I feel Watsnabe is a superior but ill-natured person; Nakagawa is quite tr~a scoundrel but is kind-hearted. Therefore, al- - though he won't be a Hidegoro bmaeda, he is svmewhat li[ce a Chu~i Kuriisada. _ (D] Watanabe is too sharp. I don't think Nakagawa is sm,zrt, but somehow is depP\"ndable... [Aj The latter is preferable as a politician's disposition. _ [C] Everything has gone too well for Michio; he has never stood in a place where the sun doesn't sine. Nakagawa was deprived of a possible role because he opposed Ohira. [QuestionJ What about his ability to raise political funds? [C] If anyone would conquer the whole country with his abilit~ to raise funds, it would be Rokusuke Tanaka. [AJ Is he tha,, remarkable? [C] Yes. In addition to that, this man is not especially skillful at speak- ing like Michio Watan~be or Ichiro Nakagawa, nor does he have any star-like qualities, but concerning his b~hind-tl:e-scenes political power and the like, whether it is true or not, he has publicized that he set up two cabinets, the Ohira cabinet and the Suzuki cabinet. (Laughter) [B] At any rate, that is because he pulls together no lesa tilan 50 Diet mem- _ bers. [C] To look at him, he has no appeal at all. Watanabe has appeal in his own way; Nakagawa has appeal in his own way. Compared to th~m, Rokusuke Tanaka has new leader appeal neither in speech nor countenance. However, speaking of the role he performed in actually moving politics, aside from whether it 5 - FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070051-4 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070051-4 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY is true or not, duzing the ohj.za ar.d S.uzuk~, govex'nments, he was at the scene where he can say, \"I set up two cabinets.\" If he wasntt there, be couldn~t even tell the lie. (LaughtexZ [D] Concerning his ability to raise political funds~ I think whetfier he c&n raise political funds or not w~ll determine fiis future when fie resigns as MITI minister. _ [A] Isn't Wat~nabe himself setting up a new to gather in money by using his position as finance minister? ~ - [B] I rhink Nakagawa's and Watanabe's ability to raise funds will probably = continue even after leaving their posts, but in Rokusuke's case, won`t he fall noticeable when he leaves his post? [CJ However, now it is only Rokusuki Tanaka whn is collecting money and giv- ing it to every~ae in the Suzuki faction. [D] I don't think that's true. [A] At any rate, it is certain that Rokusuke Tanaka has started to stand in the new leader section since he became MITI minister. [C] The order of our conversation is reversed but as for the new ?.eader champions, they are Takeshita and Abe, after all. Watanabe, Nakagawa and Rokusuke Tanaka are below them. But it is simply becau~se Rokusuke Tanaka i and Watanabe are by chance in the most fortunate positions that they became subjects first, but if Watanabe aad Tanaka step down as ministers, they would not have been su~ects of our talks far an hoc~r. On those points, Takeshita is now in the most unfortunate situation. [Question] Takeshita once tried to take arms against Tanaka. Isn't his popularity low because that was unfinished? [C~ It is outrageous for him to have taken up arms. Without Tanaka, Take- shita doesn't sxist. Noboru Takeshita has meaning because of the Tanaka faction. ' [B] Supporting the generation change theory, Takeshita set up the neo-liber- _ alism research society together with Shintaro abe and Kiichi Miyazawa. That incurred Kakuei's wrath. [D] That's why he was made to scrub the floor. (Laughter) [B] But that neoliberalism reseaxch society was significant. It seema that both Tanaka and Fukuda held down that society in that format, but as a result, the new leaders became finance minister and chairman of the Policy Research Committee, and thus it can be said doors to various important posts were opened. Witfiout that society, control by the elders, the so-called era of the influential political leaders, would have continued. 6 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070051-4 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00854R400404070051-4 ï¿½ , AL U! ~E ONL' i~ , - Shintaro Abe's Favorable Tex~nps [Question] .How about Ganri Yamashita ox Tokusaburo YCozaka c~f the Tanaka - faction? [C] Such persons can in no way he new leaders. Ganri Yamashita is a made-up image. Kozaka is not even a topic of comiersation witfiin the faction. [B] If some accident happened to Tanaka, up to 90 percent of the Tanaka faction would stay ~aith Takeshita. [CJ No, it would be with Ni~.aido. If something happened to Tanaka and Nikaido, 90 perce.nt would go to Takeshita. - [B] Almost no or~e would stay with Ganri Yamashita. Thirty percent would follow Kozaka. [A] What about Kanamaru? [B] He is Takeshita's guardian. Don't more than half of the 90 percent who w~uld follow Takeshita idolize Kanamaru's v2rtues. [C] At any rate, because Tanaka equals Takeshita, Takeshita cannot survive if he rebels against Tanaka. The way for Takeshita to survie is to earnestly and loyally serve Tanaka. [Question] Tanaka is looking after Takeshita thinking he's an excellent fel- low. As for those in the Tanaka faction, they pretend to be following after Takeshita because Kakuei is looking after him. But, should Tanaka have an accident, isn't there the gossibility they would converge not on Takeshita but on another? [C] Just the opposite. Although Takeah~ta was more or less given a cold shoulder by Tanaka, I think the maiority was sympathetic to Takeshita. [B] Therefore, it resembles when the Sato faction dissolved into the Tanaka faction an.i Fukuda faction, most went to Tanaka who had more or less been ig- nored by Sato. (C] Now, Ganri Yamashita is called a fine fellow by Tanaka. But no one would follow him. Kakuei thinks Takeshita is the le~der of the young genera- tion who seeks a quick change of leadership, and sometimes talks ill behind his (Tanaka's) back---the rascal. Even so, he recognizes the strength of the Takeshita-Kanamaru group and thinks he has to keep them close at hand even while }~olding them in check. [D] As for my view of the future, I think Shintaro Abe will certain~y be the first among the present new leaders to assume political power. 7 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070051-4 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2407142/09: CIA-RDP82-00854R000440070051-4 ~~~i. urrx~~u. ~ac UNLY [QuestionJ Why do you say that? [D] One reason is Fukuda~s age. No mattex hoGr~much he persists, Fuiwda has only 3 or 4 years left. He is in the fortunate positi~on of hsving an old boss. Secondly, he has no rival in tfie Fukuda faction. Thirdlys he is neither a skillful speaker nor particularly sfiarp, but Tie stands above others---shall we call him an absentminded young man or young leader---and he has the personality to be a natural leader of others. [A] Both Nakagawa and Takeshita are mini-Tanaka types. However, tfiey are not, after all, men who can outstrip Kakuei Tanaka. Fort~na~tely or unfor- runately, because Abe bQlongs to a different type of politician, there is absolutely no way he can be compared to Tanaka. That is also to his credit. [B] One more point. He doesn't give the image of being ~extremely sharp, but he has a sense of balance. As far as the Fukuda fac~ion's course is con- cerned, it is hawkish and to the right and it would not be strange if he ran to the far right like Nakagawa. But within the Fukuda faction, he is a per- son who gives a sense of security that he won.'t fly away fram th~ conserva- tive main current. Noboru Takeshita's Survival Path [D] Contrary to other new leaders, he doesn't have to strain to bring in money. [Cj Ye:s, that's rignt. He doesn't have t~ make any effort at all. Kishi is looking after him. _ [B] Compared tc him, Rokusuke Tanaka is trying so.hard. [C] Frantically. (Laughter) [A] Nakagawa is also working hard. (B] That isn't so for Takeshita or Abe. - [C] Takeshita once tried hard, but now he has become very quiet. The road - to a new life for T'akeshita is to be forgotten by the public. ~C] It is better for him to disappear from the topic of nFw leaders. [Question] How is the relationship between Takeshita and Nikaido? For example, in a situation wi?ere some accident happened to Tanaka, wouldn't th?~ Nikaido f.action and Takeshita faction split? [CJ No. No doubt, Nikaido would be the one turned to. [B] However, that quiet strength of Nikaido has gradually came to shine. After Zenko, it will be Nikaido, and after Nikaido, Shintaro Abe. - 8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070051-4 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2407142/09: CIA-RDP82-00854R000440070051-4 , E ONLY . [AJ Tf \"dirty\" Nik$ido hecomes pxiipe m~nisteac, ~ton't there he various txoubles inside the LD~? [C] \"Dirty official\" is a word used only by tfie~mass media and the opposition parties. No one thinks Nikaida is a dirty of.ficial. a [Question] Didn't he get money from All Nippon Airlines? [C] If he said he didntt get any money, then f~e d~dn't get any. (Laughter) But if receiving money is 3irty, there aren't any politicians who are not dirty. (Laughter) Moreover, as for fiaving received 5 million, if that is dirty, I don't think there are any politicians who are not dirty. Mr..X, if such is the case, then you are pitch black. (Laughter) [Mr. X~ No, I am told I'm deep r~d. ï¿½ _ [BJ As for Ivikaido's personality~ he is a simple, gocd man. I have that impression. A negative criticism of him is that he is wrapped up too much in Kakuei's shadow. Finally, whether ~here is a Nikaido government degends on how the public digests the problem cf Kakuei. [A] Therefore, conversely speaking, given a situation where Kakuei Tanaka has an accident and dies and a Nikaido government assumes power, or a situ- ation where Nikaido takes over the gover~ent with Tanaka still alive, the public would have strong opposition to the latter. [B] I think that there is also a case where there would be an atmosphere which allows Nikaido if Kaku~i is not around. A Nikaido government would be easier if Kakuei is not around. [C] Kakuei won't fall. He'll be around for another hundred years! (Laughter) [A] But if Nikaido assumes power while Kakuei is around, won't there be quite a bit of confusion? For e~cample, if Kakuei's tr3i1 3udges him innocent and at the time Nikaido happends to be prime minister, it will seem that pol- _ itical power controls even the ~udicial power. [C] F.verything is being put in ord~r before that. [D] Everything will pr.obably be put in order by the fall of next year. Tokusaburo Kozaka's Limits [Cj WelJ., it is common sense to say it will be either Nakasone or Nikaido after Zenko, but depending on circiunstances, there is Kawamoto, a d3rk horse. = After him, it will be the era of Shintaro Abe, Noboru Takeshita~ Rokusuke Tanaka, Ichiro Nakagawa and Michio Watanabe. Oh, I forgot---we have to add in Kiichi Miyazawa for the time being. Nikaido and Nakasone are of the san:e rank. If Kr~kuei says Nikaido, it wi11 be Nikaido; if he says Nakasone, it will be Nakasone. If these two are not possible, then Kawamoto or Miyazawa will emerge. 9 - FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070051-4 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2407142/09: CIA-RDP82-00854R000440070051-4 . . __.r _ [A] I still thix~k Tokusahuro Rozaka ~s poss~hle.

He came forth from the outset saying, \"I'll be a new leader,\" , and he is, so to speak, one of those wfio are recommnended from above to the politic3l world. [D] He is in line with Aiichiro Fu~iyama, Naoto Ichimanda and Tatsunosuke Takasaki. [B] In that sense, won't he follow the same fate as Shintaro Ishihara who failed? - [A] Kozaka cannot be called a candidate for prime minister if he is so afraid and intimidated by Hamako. [C] Each has suffered being on the lowest rung of the ladder. Rokusuke Tanaka is now showily handling the position of MITI minister, but he has suf- fered miserably at tfi e lowest rung in order to support the Ohira cabinet as vice chairman of the Diet Policy Committee when Abe was chairman. So each has his own suffering. [B] The reason Miyazawa is not more attractive is that he became minister while quite young and so he has not experienced the bottom rung. [C] The-cefore, he has no sympathy from his companions. Takeshita, Abe, Rokusuke Tanaka, Nakagawa, Watanabe, they a11 have the mutual experience of _ the bottom rung. Therefore, a mutual feeling of fellowship exists. [D] The reason Kozaka somehow isn't popular is because he came from the financial world, and has a mean spirit of not wanting to be a repetition of Aichiro Fujiyama. On the other hand, if he is in the mood or sp irit to pour all that financial power into politics, saying it's fine if I am a . repeat of Fu3iyama, I think he would become more popular because that would - be transmitted to o~hers. I think there is no hope as long as he plays ten- _ nis, cruises on yachts and worri~s about having his fortune dwindle. - [B] As for someone in the New Liberal Club, the reason it is said that Toshio Yamaguchi, rather than Yohei Kono, has gradually won trust is probably because there is the feeling about him that he has suffered and scrubbed floors. [C] If Tokusaburo Kozaka ~oined the Suzuki faction, a little more could be done. He ~oined the Tanaka faction even though he is older than Kakuei Tanaka; isn't that political suicide? 10 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070051-4 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070051-4 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY [B] The li~i,ts o~ hi.s poli,tical sense can he understood when one looks at the .fact he ~oined the Tanalca #action. Odds-on Favorite and Competitor in Priine Minister Race [Question] If you were to buy a pariwutuel ticket in the post-Suzuki prime - minister race, who would be the odds-on favorite, tfi~ competitor and the , dark hor~e? [C] Nikaido and Nakasone, 4 and ~i; Kawamoto and Miyazawa, 1 and 1. [A] In terms of tfie significance of the post-Suzuki prime minister, it won't be Rokusuke Tanaka, Nakagawr~ or Abe. [B] Isn't Fukuda also about 0.5? _ [C] I don't thi_n_k ~u, [D] Aside from how long the Suzuki government will last, it will be Nakasone, - 4; Nikaido, 3; and Kawamoto, 2. The reason Miyazawa is one is because there - could not be a third generation prime minister from the Kochikai. But if he became prime minister, I give him a 1 because he would do well. [Question] What about successive victories and double entries? Far example, next would be Takeshita. [G] Then is would be Nikaido and Abe. _ [A] Nakasone and Takeshita. [B] I think Nakasone and Abe. [Question] What about Zenko Suzuki's reelection in November next year? _ [A] I think that has the strongeat possibility. = [D] I think so too. - [Question] If Suzuki should fall, what would be the hurdles besides health reasons? [C] If the Tanaka faction leaves him. ~ [QuestionJ Even if he gains no points politically, won't he continue as long as the Tanaka faction is with him? - [C] Right. _ [A] Tanaka won't leave him. For Tanaka, he is the most convenient prime minister imaginable. 11 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070051-4 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2407142/09: CIA-RDP82-00854R000440070051-4 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY [D] Now he ~s good ~ox hoth the.

[D] What about his real intention? [C] Only Tanaka knows that. However, because he intends to be active for another 20 years or so, he would be a splendid post-Suzuki candidate. Right now he thinks of nothing but having the courts declare him innocent. [D~ Of course from his perspective, isn't his f2eling one of how do I live the rest of my life if politics is taken away from me. Actually, it's quite distressing.

[B] In such a case, what would the Nakagawa and Abe group do? [D] Perhaps split the party.

[C] One sees that when one reads newspaper articles on politics. There has perhaps been no time as uninteresting as now. [D] Yesterday when I went to the Ginza, there was talk of nothing but Motoko _ Ito. ~ - (A] Politics isn't a topic. When it was a question of whether Tanaka or rukuda, arguments about the political situation were barbershop talk, but when it's a question of either Nakasone or Nikaido, it won't even become a topic of barbershop political talk. [BJ In the same way, whether it's Abe or Takeshita just won't become a topic. - [C] On that point, the stars have all disappeared.

POLITICAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL ~ SOCIALIST PARTY CONVENTION PREPARATIONS UNDERWAY Tokyo ASAHI EVENING NEWS in English 4 Nov 81 p 7 [Editorial: \"JSP Conventiun\"] [Text] The Japan Soci~list Party has' started pceparing foT its national convcntion in February 1982. It has drAwn up a draft for the revision o~ \"The Road to 5ociallsm in Japan,\" which h;u hithcrto been a party platform in all but nad~e: 7tiis' 3r8ft~ which was drawn up after ledgthy debate, will be subtnitt~d, to' the convention. There are also moves tn hold an el~ction of the party cliairman, in which all the party members will parti- cipate, prior to the convention. The draft for the revision of \"The . Road to Socialism\" takes an unprecedentedly realistic vIew of ï¿½the domestic and _ internutional scenes, and is ckarly designed to eatablish a new~ coursc: for the 1980s, a course that' is far more realistic thanï¿½ the onc established 15 years ago by \"The Road to Socialiatn:' Let us look at the changes in the party's appraisal of 'the existing. situation and at the steps it intends to't~ke to cop~ with thisï¿½ - situation. ' . For instance. it recognizes the trends toward the mulri- polarization and diversification of international relations sind' shows signs ot trying to escape from .thf simple formula of East-Wcst canfrontation. It also statee that pmblems with regard to democracy are common to the soeialist countries and. that this springs from political immaturity. In, the drive to reform [he existing situation, t~e party, according to the draft, will not restrict itself tv opposing the C~overnment'e policies, but will encourngc thc fouadation of a democratic social~st state by means of greater patticipation in papulac mov.emente; ï¿½ But in the process of arriving at this draf~, thera remein siispicions about just how much debate there wus concerning the implications of developments' fn Afghanistan and Poland. In addition, despitc the fact that Uhe intellectuals who prepared the draft had taken as broad a point o! view as posslble, it scems that, when thc draft wus presented for diacuasion by the party, the rightists and left9sts merel}~ bickered oVer it in terms of their own narrow views. In this de6ate, the main theme, which concerned the socialist vision of the future, was carried over as a study theme until tho end of 1982. Henceforth, .debt?te shauld not be con- - fincd to rhe party; it is important that !he iaterest of Ohe general public should be aroused. t' ~ 26 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY ï¿½ APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400070051-4 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-04850R000400070051-4 FOR OFFIC7Al. USE O1~1.Y :t~ lfiis debate will he greatly affected bq the JSP's system of lcadership, and the ability of its leaders. Since these factors ` are connected with the course the party takes, it is' only natural - that there sho~ild be interest both inside and outside the party concerning who will lead the party. Recent~ly, there have been a series of pr~blems thatï¿½ havc - exposed the weakness of Asukata's leadership. , In additioa to the waverings with respact to the `ï¿½`administrative. reform Diet\" and the split in the JSP's Tokyo Chapter, there is the lack of consistency concerning the action policy for the U~per House nadonal constitueacy electivn in 1983. Tht.pntty.Iei~dPxs firs~ decided on a policy of dividing the oon5tituency by iegion so that candidatPs would get votes principally from the regions to which they are assigned. In the face of strong opposition from ' ttie labor tinions, however, it seems that the leadera are now in- clined to retain to somo extent the present formuta, by which c:indidates get votes from labor unions. 7'he rightist factions wilhin the party, which' are dissatis~ed with the present confused situation, are thinking of setting un _ a candidate to oppose Asttkata. But observers within the party, and particularly the letl~~t'g9etions that intend .to .continue .sup- . pocting Asukata, believe that ehese moves are aimad eventually at winning the post of secretary-general for. the'iight, and not the chairmanship. If this is true, the factional politickir.g that has been endemic ;n the party 1~as cleariy not been laid to rest. 'Perhaps the sclection of party leaden by maatte of com- promises reached between factions cannot be hel.ped. But there - is no serious debate in the JSP concerning what system of leadcrship is needed so that the long decline in the party's - strength can be arrested. It is only these fact3onel transactions that are noticeable. - \"Che party should take a look a~ the changes in the environ- - mcnt surrounding the party. In view of the laboi federations' _ moves to form a unified front, the ciection pf S~e'JSP'.lesders wi11 have greater significance than ever. An clection in whlCh; ~ACtional considerali~as .are ~wltawed too much play will create grudges att~l wilt futtheT re8uce the energy of thc party. The party should consider a run-off vote in an election in which all the party members participate. This wulild be appreciated by the genera] public.
