On July 4 — America's Independence Day — an Israeli commando force staged a dramatic raid on Entebbe airport in Uganda, rescuing all but four of the 106 hostages who had been aboard a hijacked Air France jet.\n\nOn July 28, in one of the most deadly natural disasters of the 20th century, a massive earthquake struck the Chinese city of Tangshan, Hebei Province, killing hundreds of thousands.\n\nThe day before the earthquake devastated Tangshan, Japan was rattled by a manmade quake, in a manner of speaking, as Kakuei Tanaka — who had served as prime minister from July 1972 to December 1974 and, as head of the largest faction in the Liberal Democratic Party, remained Japan's most influential politician — was arrested and marched off to the Tokyo Detention Center on charges of receiving nearly $2 million in bribes from Lockheed Aircraft Corp."
