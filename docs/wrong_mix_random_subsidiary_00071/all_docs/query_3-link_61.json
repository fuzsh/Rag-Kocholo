        "text": "TOKYO -- In the 1970s, Donald Keene traveled all around Japan. He visited 12 cities in 1973 and 1974, as he was in charge of a serial publication for Japan Airlines Co.'s internal newsletter \"Ohzora.\"\n\nKeene may seem like a tour guide specializing in introducing famous spots, like Kyoto, Nara, Fukuoka, Nagasaki and Kanazawa. However, through his nationwide tour, he forged close, lifelong ties with the Shizuoka Prefecture city of Shimoda, and the Sea of Japan island of Sado in Niigata Prefecture. He later told me that he \"acquired the taste for travel\" through this experience. I figure he must have rediscovered Japan in the calm environment.\n\nShimoda was also filled with memories of literary giant Yukio Mishima, and Keene writes about the city, which he visited almost every year, in the following passages.\n\n----------\n\nShimoda's chief distinction for many years was its inaccessibility. Nowadays it takes less than two and a half hours by express train from Tokyo to Shimoda, but even fifteen years ago the trains only went halfway down the Izu Peninsula, and the rest of the way to Shimoda was on a bus that creaked and swayed as it navigated the innumerable curves on the mountainous roads. Even so, it was certainly not so remote as it was when Townsend Harris arrived there 1856 to establish the first foreign consulate in Japan. It seemed to him like the end of the world, and when he finally got permission to go to Edo (the modern Tokyo) he learned to his great discomfort how many jolts and lurches passengers riding in palanquins had to suffer on the way.\n\nBut even Harris, whose various ailments undoubtedly affected his record of the lonely years he spent in Shimoda, was not insensitive to the exceptional beauty of the place. The bay with its islands and promontories and the surrounding green hills again and again caused this sometimes insensitive observer of the Japanese scene to interrupt the recitation of his woes. Harris persevered with his mission, despite his ailments, the isolation, and the reluctance of the Japanese officials to negotiate with him, but he is best known today not for his diplomatic skills but for his brief romance with a Shimoda geisha called Okichi. It would be hard to find a less romantic figure than Harris, but the story of their great love, invented early in the twentieth century on the basis of flimsy evidence, has given Okichi something approaching the status of a patron saint. A statue of the Buddhist divinity of compassion, Kannon, is known as the Okichi Kannon, and her name has been applied to many varieties of souvenirs of Shimoda, ranging from delicate little cakes to pornographic dolls.\n\nThere was indeed an historical Okichi, and evidence indicates that she was persuaded, perhaps against her wishes, to serve the American consul. Okichi visited the Gyokusenji, the Buddhist temple Harris used as his consulate and residence, in June 1857 and received a substantial sum of money. But, alas for the romancers, after three days' service, Harris sent Okichi away. Apparently a skin infection had displeased him, but even after the infection was cured and she asked to serve him again Harris refused, saying he was unwell. Presumably he never saw Okichi again. Their romance -- if it merits that name -- hardly seems like sufficient reason for canonizing Okichi, but everywhere in Shimoda one sees relics which are said to have belonged to her, though few of them can be genuine.\n\n[TRAVELS IN JAPAN II]\n\n----------\n\nFor Keene, a U.S.-born scholar of Japanese literature, Shimoda must not have been just a rural area, but the origin of U.S.-Japan relations. It's interesting that nonetheless, he views with irony how \"geisha\" hostess Okichi -- who in Shimoda, accommodated Townsend Harris, the first American consul to reside in Japan -- became mythologized through novels, movies, and other media as the tragic heroine \"Tojin Okichi.\"\n\n----------\n\nIt would probably not have surprised the pompous Harris if somehow he had been able to look into the future and learn that the town would be famous because of him, though he would no doubt have been acutely distressed to discover that his name would forever be linked with that of his paramour of three nights, the unhappy Okichi.\n\n[TRAVELS IN JAPAN II]\n\n----------\n\nKeene's essays, originally in English, were titled \"Travels in Japan,\" and were later published in Japanese. According to the afterword, the essays were received favorably, and Keene began occasionally writing travelogues for the Chuo Koron magazine shortly after.\n\nIn his essay on Sado, Keene introduces \"Bunya Ningyo,\" a type of traditional puppetry passed down in the area.\n\n----------\n\nThat night we walked after dinner to the nearby Hommachi Shinto shrine to attend a performance of bunya, a kind of puppet show that survives only in Sado. I was introduced to the chief priest, Sasaki Yoshihide, and said \"How do you do?\" in the usual way, only for Mr. Sasaki to inform me that we had met before, on the evening of August 24, 1956. He remembered all the circumstances, down to the names of the people in the group I had traveled with. I vaguely recalled there had been a performance in a Ryotsu hotel, but certainly not the precise day nor what puppet play I had witnessed, and it astonished me that Mr. Sasaki could remember the occasion with such exactness. The performance fifteen years ago was in the main ballroom of the hotel, and although I was intrigued by what I saw, I missed the natural setting for bunya.\n\nThis time, however, the performance took place inside the hall of worship of the shrine. Most of the people who attended offered some money, clapped their hands in prayer, and then took their places facing the tiny stage, which was fenced off by a waist-high blue cloth decorated with a design of Chinese lion cavorting amid peonies. After an unseen person announced the title of the play to be performed, Gempei Hiragana Seisuiki (The rise and fall of the Minamoto and Taira), the curtain was drawn aside to reveal a simple setting. I noticed immediately that, unlike the bunraku puppets operated by three men, each bunya puppet is operated by only one man. The movements are less refined and lifelike than those of the bunraku puppets, but what they lack in delicacy they make up for in swiftness and vitality. The play is often performed both at the bunraku and kabuki theaters, but the sections I knew well were passed over in favor of totally unfamiliar ones. The manner of performance was also unlike that of bunraku. The single chanter and shamisen accompanist were both hidden behind the curtain and not visible to the audience. With minor exceptions the text was sung throughout, rather than delivered in the mixture of song and declaimed dialogue typical of bunraku. The music, though monotonous, lent additional solemnity to the performance.\n\nThere were only three puppet operators. When more than three puppets appeared on stage, one man might operate two puppets, one with each hand, but more often puppets that were not taking an active part in a scene were left leaning against a partition.\n\nI felt sure as I watched the performance that the early puppet plays in Japan must have been similar to bunya. The movements were sometimes awkward, and on occasion someone concealed by the curtain would stretch out a fan to help a puppet whose clothes were disarrayed, but the dramatic effect was never impaired.\n\n[TRAVELS IN JAPAN V]\n\n----------\n\nThe Bunya Ningyo show Keene watched is classified as \"Kojoruri,\" an ancient form of \"Ningyo Joruri\" traditional puppetry plays. It is a classical type of the Bunraku puppet plays performed today, and was passed down in multiple areas.\n\nThe script of one such ancient play \"Kochi Hoin Godenki\" (\"The Adventures of High Priest Kochi\") was discovered in London's British Museum library in 1962. The story is based on the legend of Kochi Hoin, a 14th century priest whose mummified remains are kept at a temple in Niigata Prefecture. Keene suggested reviving the play, and the show was brought to life in Kashiwazaki, Niigata Prefecture, in 2009, and other places. They were performed by Keene's adopted son Seiki, a former Bunraku shamisen (three-stringed lute) professional from Niigata, and a troupe of Bunya Ningyo puppeteers. In 2017, the show made its London debut.\n\nBy a mysterious, invisible string, Keene was tied to Sado throughout his life.\n\n* * *\n\nThis series navigates the past century by following the life of the late scholar Donald Keene, who contributed to the elevation of Japanese culture and literature in the world. News from The Mainichi that made headlines in Keene's time is introduced alongside Keene's personal history. The series began in 2022, the 100th anniversary of Keene's birth -- also the centennial of The Mainichi.\n\n(This is Part 47 of a series. The next \"Donald Keene's Japan\" story will be published on Jan. 2.)\n\n(Japanese original by Tadahiko Mori, The Mainichi Staff Writer and Donald Keene Memorial Foundation director)\n\nThe original text of Donald Keene's autobiographies is used with permission from the Donald Keene Memorial Foundation. The foundation's website can be reached at: https://www.donaldkeene.org/\n\n* * *\n\nProfile:\n\nDonald Keene was born on June 18, 1922, in Brooklyn, New York. He was a Japanese literature scholar and professor emeritus at Columbia University. After earning postgraduate degrees at Columbia University and Cambridge University, he received a fellowship to study at Kyoto University in 1953. Keene developed friendships with prominent Japanese authors, including Junichiro Tanizaki, Yasunari Kawabata and Yukio Mishima. Over the course of half a century, Keene traveled back and forth between the U.S. and Japan, and continued to study Japanese literature and culture, while conveying their charms to the world in English. His main works include a multivolume history of Japanese literature, \"Travelers of a Hundred Ages,\" and \"Emperor of Japan: Meiji and His World, 1852-1912.\" In 2008, Keene received the Order of Culture from the Japanese government. The scholar obtained Japanese citizenship in the year following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami. He died on Feb. 24, 2019, at age 96."
