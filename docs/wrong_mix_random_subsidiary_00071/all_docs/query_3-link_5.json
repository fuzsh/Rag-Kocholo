        "text": "The Japanese government will give Harvard $1 million to promote Japanese studies, the country's ambassador to the United States said on August 17.\n\nThe donation is the second million dollar gift from Japan in the last year. In September 1972, the Mitsubishi group of industries established a chair in Japanese legal studies at the Law School with an endowed professorship.\n\nJapanese Ambassador Takesi Yashawa informed President Bok about the latest gift a month after Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka announced in Washington that the Japan Foundation would donate $10 million to American universities. Nine other colleges in addition to Harvard are recipients of these funds.\n\nThe grant is one of the first major contributions towards the development of a $15 million Japan Institute. It will also be used for a University-wide program of research and training in the field of Japanese studies.\n\n\"The idea of a Japan Institute, and Japanese support of it, is not just public relations, but is intended to promote a deep understanding of Japan in the U.S.,\" Albert M. Craig, associate director of the East Asian Research Center, said Monday.\n\nExpression of Thanks\n\nCraig also speculated that the gift may also be an expression of thanks for U.S. aid during the post-war period.\n\nWilliam Olney, director of Special Projects, said Monday that the Tanaka gift is unrestricted and will \"probably be used for the endowment of a new professorship.\""
