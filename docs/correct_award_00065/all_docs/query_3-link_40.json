        "text": "Knut Hamsun, the Nobel prize-winning Norwegian author who fell from grace for supporting the Nazi occupation of Norway, is to be put on a commemorative coin by his homeland's central bank.\n\nThe coin is the first to celebrate Hamsun, a Norwegian national hero until his sympathy for the Nazi party emerged. \"NORWEGIANS! Throw down your rifles and go home again,\" he wrote in a newspaper article after the Nazis arrived in Norway in 1940. \"The Germans are fighting for us all, and will crush the English tyranny over us and over all neutrals.\" His post-war trial for treason was ended after two psychiatrists ruled he was suffering from \"permanently impaired mental faculties\", but he was sentenced to the loss of his property, put under psychiatric observation, and died in 1952 in poverty.\n\nThe coin's issue, to mark the 150th anniversary of Hamsun's birth, comes seven years after a ferocious debate over naming an Oslo street after the author, an idea which was eventually dropped after public outrage. The coin shows a reproduction of Hamsun's notes for his masterpiece Markens Gr√∏de (Growth of the Soil), along with his features, which are partially visible through the text, and his signature.\n\nLeif Veggum, a director of Norges Bank, said the coin was being issued \"in honour of Hamsun's works, which have had a strong influence on both Norwegian and international literature\". Hamsun is best known for his novel Hunger, which is seen as one of the first genuinely modern Norwegian novels, telling of a starving young writer driven to extremes of euphoria and despair, and for the classic works Mysteries, Pan, Victoria and Growth of the Soil.\n\nThe bank is issuing a limited run of 40,000 coins, which will retail for NK450, with a face value of NK200."
