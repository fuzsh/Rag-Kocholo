        "text": "Norwegian author and dramatist Jon Fosse has been awarded the 2023 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his innovative plays and prose which give voice to the unsayable\", the award-giving body has announced.\n\nOne of his country's most-performed dramatists, Fosse, 64, has written some 40 plays as well as novels, short stories, children’s books, poetry and essays.\n\n\"I am overwhelmed, and somewhat frightened,\" Fosse said in a statement.\n\n\"I see this as an award to the literature that first and foremost aims to be literature, without other considerations.\"\n\nMats Malm, permanent secretary of the academy, announced the prize in Stockholm on Thursday.\n\nMr Malm said he reached Fosse by telephone to inform him of the prize and that the writer was driving in the countryside and promised to drive home carefully.\n\nAnders Olsson, chair of the Nobel literature committee, said Fosse's work was rooted \"in the language and nature of his Norwegian background\".\n\nThe prize is awarded by the Swedish Academy and is worth 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.5 million.)\n\nFosse is the fourth Norwegian writer to receive the Nobel.\n\nBjørnstjerne Bjørnson got it in 1903, Knut Hamsun was awarded it in 1920 and Sigrid Undset in 1928.\n\nFosse's European breakthrough as a dramatist came with Claude Régy's 1999 Paris production of his 1996 play Nokon kjem til å komme (Someone Is Going to Come).\n\nHis magnum opus in prose is the Septology he completed in 2021 — Det andre namnet (2019), The Other Name (2020), Eg er ein annan (2020), I is Another (2020), and Eit nytt namn (A New Name) (2021).\n\nFosse, who writes in the least common of the two official versions of Norwegian, said he regarded the award as a recognition of this language and the movement promoting it, and that he ultimately owed the prize to the language itself.\n\nKnown as \"new Norwegian\" and used by only about 10 per cent of the country's population, Fosse's version of the language was developed in the 19th century with rural dialects at its base, making it an alternative to the dominant use of Danish that followed from a 400-year union with Denmark.\n\nAccording to his publisher, Fosse's work has been translated into more than 40 languages, and there have been more than 1,000 different productions of his plays.\n\nEstablished in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel, the prizes for achievements in literature, science and peace have been awarded since 1901, becoming a career pinnacle in the fields.\n\nThe economics prize is a later addition established by the Swedish central bank.\n\nAlongside the peace prize, literature has often drawn the most attention, and controversy, thrusting lesser-known authors into the global spotlight as well as lifting book sales for well-established literary superstars.\n\nOver the years, the literature prize has also picked winners well beyond the novelist tradition, including playwrights, historians, philosophers and poets, even breaking new ground with the award going to singer-songwriter Bob Dylan in 2016.\n\nLast year's Nobel was won by one of the main favourites, author Annie Ernaux, for her largely autobiographical books examining memory and social inequality, making her the first French woman to win the world's most prestigious literary award."
