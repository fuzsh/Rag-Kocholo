        "text": "Award\n\nAward\n\n1920 Nobel Prize in LiteratureKnut HamsunDate\n\n13 November 1920 (announcement)\n\n10 December 1920\n\n(ceremony)\n\nLocationStockholm, SwedenPresented bySwedish AcademyFirst awarded1901WebsiteOfficial website\n\n← 1919 · Nobel Prize in Literature · 1921 →\n\nThe 1920 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to the Norwegian author Knut Hamsun (1859–1952) \"for his monumental work, Growth of the Soil.\"[1] He was the second Norwegian Nobel laureate in literature after Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson won in 1903.\n\nLaureate[edit]\n\nMain article: Knut Hamsun\n\nThe novel Sult (\"Hunger\", 1890), widely regarded as the first modern novel in Norwegian literature, marked Knutman's debut as a writer. In his writings, he basically highlights the simple life lived in harmony with nature and shows an aversion to civilization. He admired Germany, which made him sympathetic to the Nazi invasion of Norway in 1940. After the World War II, he was ordered to forfeit his possessions and placed under psychiatric monitoring for a period. He pioneered psychological literature with techniques of stream of consciousness and interior monologue influencing authors such as Kafka, Mann, Miller and Hesse. Among his famous oeuvres include Mysterier (\"Mysteries\", 1892), Pan (1894), and Victoria (1898), and published one poetry collection, Det vilde Kor (\"The Wild Choir\", 1904).[2][3]\n\nGrowth of the Soil[edit]\n\nThe Nobel Prize was given to Hamsun for his 1917 novel Markens Grøde (\"Growth of the Soil\"), which is regarded as an epic ode to labor and the interdependence of man and nature. The protagonists in the novel are portrayed as actual individuals, but Hamsun gives the settlers' attempts to develop the wilderness heroic aspects in the manner of the classical poet Hesiod.[2] Employing stream of consciousness, the novel exemplified his aversion to modernity and inclination towards primitivism and the agrarian lifestyle.[4][page needed]\n\nDeliberations[edit]\n\nNominations[edit]\n\nHamsun only received 3 nominations in total for consecutive two years. He first received his nomination in 1918 from Norwegian art historian Harry Fett, but no award was that year due to the deliberations being disrupted by World War I. He then received two nominations in 1920 once again from Harry Fett and Academy member Erik Axel Karlfeldt.[5]\n\nIn total, the Nobel Committee earned 27 nominations for authors like Thomas Hardy, Grazia Deledda (awarded in 1926), Georg Brandes, John Galsworthy (awarded in 1932), Władysław Reymont (awarded in 1924), Ebenezer Howard and Juhani Aho. Only one author was newly recommended namely the American historian Wilbur Cortez Abbott and Italian writer Grazia Deledda was the only female nominee.[6]\n\nThe authors Paul Adam, Alice E.
