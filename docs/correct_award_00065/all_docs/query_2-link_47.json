        "text": "“While the book is ostensibly about hunger, it strikes me as more of an early work focused on existential despair.”\n\nKnut Hamsun is a Norwegian writer, Nobel Prize winner (Literature, 1920) and creative force. He lived for almost a hundred years (1859 – 1952) and published dozens of novels, among other creative projects. He was known for tackling human consciousness in a new and more accurate, intimate way, pioneering—according to some—“psychological literature.”\n\nIn Hunger, published in 1890, he takes readers inside the head of, literally, a starving artist—a writer in this case. The unnamed protagonist is wandering the streets of Oslo (Kristiania at the time), impoverished, starving and trying mostly unsuccessfully to sell his writing.\n\n“I was bitterly hungry; I wished myself dead and buried; I got maudlin, and wet.”\n\nWhen he’s at his lowest, he tries to sate his hunger with odd items: “I hungered sorely. I found a chip of wood in the street to chew—that helped a bit.” And: “A brown orange-peel, too, that I had found in the street, and which I commenced to chew at once, had given me nausea. I was ill—the veins swelled up bluely on my wrists.”\n\nAll in all, a rough state for doing meaningful creative work.\n\n“The last crisis had dealt rather roughly with me. My hair fell out in masses, and I was much troubled with headaches, particularly in the morning, and my nervous strain died a hard death. I sat and wrote during the day with my hands bound up in rags, simply because I could not endure the touch of my own breath upon them.”\n\nWhile I’ve, thankfully, never been without food for long periods—usually I’m a peckish artist at best or, in the worst of times, a mildly hungry artist—I do have insights into the creative process and Hamsun captures that mysterious, empowering and often disheartening process well.\n\n“It would be such an extraordinary help to me if I were lucky enough to find a suitable winding up for this little essay. I had stuck just at a rather difficult point in it, where there ought to be a quiet imperceptible transition to something fresh, then a subdued gliding finale, a prolonged murmur, ending at last in a climax as bold and as startling as a shot, or the sound of a mountain avalanche—full stop.”\n\nBut it was not to be. Even though the protagonist is a talented writer who places one piece and finds a supporter in a local editor, he can’t stick with it.\n\n“A couple of short sentences formed themselves with much trouble, a score of poor words which I tortured forth with might and main to try and finish something. Then I stopped, my head was barren…” And, “I stared at these strange, shaky letters that bristled up from the paper like small hairy creeping things, till at last I could make neither head nor tail of any of it. I thought on nothing.”\n\nHe’s trapped in a horrific but ultimately self-imposed existence, his poverty and hunger compounded by a self-sabotaging sense of pride, self-loathing and perpetual doubt. And chronicling his sad state of mental affairs is where Hamsun really shines:\n\n“I railed at myself for my poverty, called myself abusive names, invented furious designations—rich, rough nuggets—in a vein of abuse with which I overwhelmed myself.”\n\nAnd, “I jeered at myself, and hugged myself with pleasure at the spectacle of my own exhaustion. At length, after the lapse of a few moments, I gave myself, with a nod, permission to be seated, though, even then, I chose the most uncomfortable place on the steps.”\n\nAnd, “With steadily increasing fury, grinding my teeth under the consciousness of my impotence, with tears and oaths I raged on, without looking at the people who passed me by. I commenced once more to martyr myself, ran my forehead against lamp-posts on purpose, dug my nails deep into my palms, bit my tongue with frenzy when it didn’t articulate clearly, and laughed insanely each time it hurt much.\n\nIt is this self-inflicted pain, amplifying but not caused by the hunger and poverty, that defines his miserable existence and keeps him trapped there.\n\n“I laughed sardonically at my delicate scruples, spat contemptuously in the street, and could not find words half strong enough to mock myself for my stupidity.”\n\nHe squanders every opportunity at happiness, turning down free meals, giving away his money and possessions to prove he’s above simple begging and even rebuffing a woman, whose motivations remained a bit murky to me, offering a chance at romantic entanglement and support.\n\nSo while the book is ostensibly about hunger, it strikes me as more of an early work focused on existential despair. The protagonist is both driven and repulsed by his own existence and its limits, forever trying unsuccessfully to rise above the shackles of biological life — characterized by hunger —through sheer (and misguided) intellectual will and the creative power of art.\n\n“My very hands seem distasteful to me; the loose, almost coarse, expression of the backs of them pains me, disgusts me. I feel myself rudely affected by the sight of my lean fingers. I hate the whole of my gaunt, shrunken body, and shrink from bearing it, from feeling it envelop me.”\n\nAnd, “I clenched my hands in frenzy, burst into tears from sheer helplessness, and gnawed away as one possessed. I cried, so that the bone got wet and dirty with my tears, vomited, cursed and groaned again, cried as if my heart would break, and vomited anew.”\n\nThis is a person facing more than simple hunger; he’s having an existential crisis and a mental health crisis simultaneously. And readers experience directly it through the eyes, and wild thoughts, of the long-suffering protagonist. It’s not a pleasant read, but it is certainly memorable."
