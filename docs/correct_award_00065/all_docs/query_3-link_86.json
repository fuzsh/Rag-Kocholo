        "meta_description": "Knut Hamsun's obituary of Adolf Hitler is the single most provoking item of his writings and also the most difficult to understand. It was published in the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten on 7 May 1945 â€“ the day before the Norwegian Liberation Day. Hamsun praised the German dictator as a \"warrior for humankind and a preacher of the gospel of justice for all nations\" and \"a first-rate reformatory figure\" who had had the misfortune to work \"in a time characterised by unparalleled brutality, which eventually overthrew him\". Hamsun's conclusion underscores these opinions with its blind loyalty: \"This is how the average Western European looks at Adolf Hitler. And we, his closest followers, all bow our heads at his death.\"",
