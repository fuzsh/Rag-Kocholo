        "text": "(1859–1952). The work of the Norwegian novelist, dramatist, and poet Knut Hamsun represents a return to Romantic fiction at the end of the 19th century. His desire was to rescue literature from the excessive realism and naturalism that had preoccupied writers from the 1850s (see novel, “Romanticism”). He was impatient with books about social problems. Instead he concentrated on a psychological analysis of an individual’s attempts to cope with simple realities. Hamsun was awarded the Nobel prize for literature in 1920.\n\nHamsun was the pen name of Knut Pedersen, who was born in Lom, Norway, on August 4, 1859. He spent most of his childhood in remote Hamarøy, Nordland county, and had almost no formal schooling. He started writing at age 19 while working as a shoemaker’s apprentice in Bodø. For the next 10 years he worked at various jobs, and during this period he twice visited the United States. For a time he was a streetcar conductor in Chicago and a farmhand in North Dakota.\n\nHamsun’s first novel, Hunger, published in 1890, was published after his return to Norway. His other works include Pan (1894), Children of the Age (1913), Growth of the Soil (1917), The Women at the Pump (1920), and Vagabonds (1927). His contempt for Western culture led him to support the Nazi occupation of Norway during World War II. After the war he was imprisoned for treason but was soon released because of his age. He died near Grimstad, Norway, on February19, 1952."
