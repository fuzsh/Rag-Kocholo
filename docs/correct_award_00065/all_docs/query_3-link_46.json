        "text": "The Norwegian novelist and playwright Jon Fosse has won the Nobel Prize for literature, the Swedish Academy announced on Thursday, for works that “give voice to the unsayable.”\n\nFosse was born in 1959 on the Norwegian west coast, and his large body of work spans genres, ranging from plays, novels and poetry collections, to essays, translations and children’s books. “Fosse’s magnum opus is his ‘Septology’ in three books,” a representative of the Academy said during the announcement ceremony, “completed in 2021, in which an elderly artist speaks to himself as another person” over the course of seven days.\n\n“Septology,” translated by Damion Searls, was brought to the United States by the California-based nonprofit publisher Transit Books, which is run by the husband-and-wife team of Adam Z. Levy and Ashley Nelson Levy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\nThe 2023 Nobel Prizes\n\nPhysiology and medicine: Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman for work that helped with the development of mRNA coronavirus vaccines\n\nPhysics: Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L’Huillier for their work studying electrons\n\nChemistry: Moungi Bawendi, Louis Brus and Alexei Ekimov for fundamental discoveries in nanotechnology\n\nLiterature: Jon Fosse for works that “give voice to the unsayable”\n\nPeace: Narges Mohammadi for fighting for women’s rights in Iran\n\nEconomics: Claudia Goldin for work on women in the labor market\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nSpeaking from his home in the East Bay, Adam Levy said he and his wife “did something really reckless”: They signed on to publish the entire multivolume work of “Septology” on the basis of a 30-page sample that was sent to them by Fosse’s British publisher, Fitzcarraldo Editions. At the time, the second and third volumes had not been written yet. Transit published “Septology” in one volume in 2022 and previously had published it as three separate volumes titled “The Other Name,” “I Is Another” and “A New Name.” “A New Name” was a finalist last year for the National Book Award for translated literature and the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction.\n\nAdam Levy said that when he and Ashley Levy read the opening sequence of “Septology,” they were immediately drawn in: “It’s about two doppelgängers on the western coast of Norway. They’re both painters, and they’re reflecting on life and death and art and Catholicism and alcoholism,” Adam Levy said, with passion in his voice about what he called the “truly hypnotic” quality of Fosse’s prose. He noted that Fosse has been published his whole career by small presses, which really understand the author’s “transfixing style,” Levy said. “You kind of get into that current in his work, and then you’re off. You’re taken away with it.”\n\nFosse’s work has been translated into more than 40 languages, and his plays, which include “Someone Is Going to Come,” “Dream of Autumn” and “I Am the Wind,” are some of the most widely performed in the world. His dramatic work often draws comparisons to Samuel Beckett and Henrik Ibsen. In an interview last year, after “A New Name” was shortlisted for the International Booker Prize, Fosse cited Norwegian writer Tarjei Vesaas, Austrian poet Georg Trakl, and Beckett as his influences, adding: “I think the writers I admire the most are Franz Kafka and Knut Hamsun.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe critic Merve Emre, writing in a profile of Fosse for the New Yorker in 2022, said: “To read Fosse’s plays and novels is to enter into communion with a writer whose presence one feels all the more intensely owing to his air of reserve, his withdrawal.” And: “‘Septology’ is the only novel I have read that has made me believe in the reality of the divine.”\n\nReaders looking for a gateway into Fosse’s work might try his new work, “A Shining,” also translated by Searls, which Transit will release at the end of this month. It is slim at a mere 44 pages, “but it contains a lot of the stylistic and sensibility of his larger work,” Levy said. “It’s about a man who kind of stops his car at the edge of a forest, and then he wanders into the forest in the dark and is confronted by a glowing presence. And in that presence, [he is able to] meditate more broadly on things like religion, art and life.”\n\nThe Nobel in literature is bestowed by 18 judges who make up the Swedish Academy, and it honors a writer’s entire body of work, not a single work. As Alfred Nobel, for whom the prizes are named, specified in his will, the prize should go “to the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction.” The winner receives 11 million Swedish kronor — close to $1 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrench writer Annie Ernaux won the prize last year, receiving the Nobel “for the courage and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of personal memory.” As Meghan O’Rourke wrote in The Washington Post, Ernaux “has produced a succession of slender, scorching and closely observed books about experiences that usually go unrecorded or unexamined.” Tanzanian writer Abdulrazak Gurnah won the Nobel in literature in 2021, and American poet Louise Glück won in 2020.\n\nNobel winners in physics, medicine and chemistry were announced earlier this week. Two scientists, Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman, received the Nobel in medicine for their groundbreaking research on messenger RNA, which was critical to the development of coronavirus vaccines. The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded on Friday, and the Nobel Prize for economics will be awarded on Monday. All 2023 winners are invited to an awards ceremony to be held on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death."
