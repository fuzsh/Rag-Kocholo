First-ever new edition of J. S. Scott's 1924 English translation of Nobel Prize winner Knut Hamsun's novel.

Children of the Age was a commercial success when it was first published as BÃ¸rn av Tiden in Norway in 1913. Isaac Anderson, writing in The Literary Digest International Book Review (1924), described it as "Hamsun's art at its best," and, while concluding that was "not so great a novel as Growth of the Soil," it had the same epic quality, and "deserves, and undoubtedly will have, a high place among the novels of our time."

J. S. Scott's English translation of the novel was published by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in 1924. Unlike most of Hamsun's other novels that were released in the U.S. shortly after he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1920, the English version of Children of the Age has never been reissued, despite recent published translations in French, German, Russian, Portuguese, Swedish, Czech, Romanian, and Estonian.

Hamsun described Children of the Age as "a novel about the war between the aristocrat and the peasant." The Encyclopedia of the Novel (2014) called it "a historically basedâand utterly scathingâcritique of modernity." And the Hamsun Centre (Hamsunsenteret) website wrote: "In Children of the Age a family's rise and fall are used to describe the decline and fall of a whole epoch. Thematically the novel has similarities to Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks (1901), with Hamsun's humour being the stylistic difference between the two."
