        "text": "“The Bear” broke an Emmys comedy record this year by securing the most ever nominations — 23 — in a single year for a comedy show. The previous record was held by “30 Rock,” which snagged 22 citations in 2009.\n\n10 of those 23 bids for “The Bear” came for acting, making the FX show one of this year’s kings of comedy acting. The show joins the likes of “30 Rock,” “Modern Family,” “Veep,” and “Friends” as another comedy series to snag multiple Emmy nominations for its eclectic comedic cast. The latter show, in particular, was beloved by audience members as the six main cast members — Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer — turned in excellent performances throughout the 10 seasons of the NBC show.\n\nAniston played the it-girl Rachel Green, who was at the center of the show thanks to her will-they-won’t-they relationship with Schwimmer’s paleontologist Ross Gellar. Cox played Schwimmer’s on-screen sister, neat-freak head chef Monica Gellar, who eventually became Monica Bing after she married Perry’s sarcastic, rapid-fire Chandler Bing. Kudrow featured as the spiritual, kookie Phoebe Buffay who married Paul Rudd’s Mike Hannigan in season 10 while LeBlanc played the dopey, lovable, ladies-man actor Joey Tribbiani. Each actor inhabited their character so well that ask any “Friends” fan who their favorite of the six is, and you’re sure to get a different response every time.\n\nLet’s break down each of these actors’ success at the Emmys in terms of Emmy nominations. First, we’ll rank them in order of overall Emmy nominations across their whole careers, then we’ll focus on their citations for “Friends” only.\n\nOverall Emmy Nominations\n\nLisa Kudrow — One win, 15 nominations\n\nBest Comedy Supporting Actress, “Friends” — 1995\n\nBest Comedy Supporting Actress, “Friends” — 1997\n\nBest Comedy Supporting Actress, “Friends” — 1998 — WON\n\nBest Comedy Supporting Actress, “Friends” — 1999\n\nBest Comedy Supporting Actress, “Friends” — 2000\n\nBest Comedy Supporting Actress, “Friends” — 2001\n\nBest Comedy Actress, “The Comeback” — 2006\n\nBest Short Form Series, “Web Therapy” — 2012\n\nBest Reality Program, “Who Do You Think You Are?” — 2012\n\nBest Structured Reality Program, “Who Do You Think You Are?” — 2014\n\nBest Comedy Actress, “The Comeback” — 2015\n\nBest Structured Reality Program, “Who Do You Think You Are?” — 2017\n\nBest Structured Reality Program, “Who Do You Think You Are?” — 2018\n\nBest Structured Reality Program, “Who Do You Think You Are?” — 2019\n\nBest Variety Special (Pre-Recorded), “Friends: The Reunion” — 2021\n\nJennifer Aniston — One win, nine nominations\n\nBest Comedy Supporting Actress, “Friends” — 2002\n\nBest Comedy Supporting Actress, “Friends” — 2001\n\nBest Comedy Actress, “Friends” — 2002 — WON\n\nBest Comedy Actress, “Friends” — 2003\n\nBest Comedy Actress, “Friends” — 2004\n\nBest Comedy Guest Actress, “30 Rock” — 2009\n\nBest Drama Actress, “The Morning Show” — 2020\n\nBest Variety Special (Pre-Recorded), “Friends: The Reunion” — 2021\n\nBest Drama Actress, “The Morning Show” — 2024\n\nMatt LeBlanc — Zero wins, eight nominations\n\nBest Comedy Actor, “Friends” — 2002\n\nBest Comedy Actor, “Friends” — 2003\n\nBest Comedy Actor, “Friends” — 2004\n\nBest Comedy Actor, “Episodes” — 2011\n\nBest Comedy Actor, “Episodes” — 2013\n\nBest Comedy Actor, “Episodes” — 2014\n\nBest Comedy Actor, “Episodes” — 2015\n\nBest Variety Special (Pre-Recorded), “Friends: The Reunion” — 2021\n\nMatthew Perry — Zero wins, five nominations\n\nBest Comedy Actor, “Friends” — 2002\n\nBest Drama Guest Actor, “The West Wing” — 2003\n\nBest Drama Guest Actor, “The West Wing” — 2004\n\nBest TV Movie/Limited Series Actor, “The Ron Clark Story” — 2007\n\nBest Variety Special (Pre-Recorded), “Friends: The Reunion” — 2021\n\nDavid Schwimmer — Zero wins, three nominations\n\nBest Comedy Supporting Actor, “Friends” — 1995\n\nBest TV Movie/Limited Series Supporting Actor, “The People vs. O.J. Simpson” — 2016\n\nBest Variety Special (Pre-Recorded), “Friends: The Reunion” — 2021\n\nCourteney Cox — One nomination, zero wins\n\nBest Variety Special (Pre-Recorded), “Friends: The Reunion” — 2021\n\n“Friends” Only Nominations*\n\n*This is not counting their Variety Special (Pre-Recorded) nomination for “Friends: The Reunion.” All six cast members were nominated for this.\n\nLisa Kudrow — One win, six nominations\n\nBest Comedy Supporting Actress, “Friends” — 1995\n\nBest Comedy Supporting Actress, “Friends” — 1997\n\nBest Comedy Supporting Actress, “Friends” — 1998 — WON\n\nBest Comedy Supporting Actress, “Friends” — 1999\n\nBest Comedy Supporting Actress, “Friends” — 2000\n\nBest Comedy Supporting Actress, “Friends” — 2001\n\nJennifer Aniston — One win, five nominations\n\nBest Comedy Supporting Actress, “Friends” — 2002\n\nBest Comedy Supporting Actress, “Friends” — 20001\n\nBest Comedy Actress, “Friends” — 2002 — WON\n\nBest Comedy Actress, “Friends” — 2003\n\nBest Comedy Actress, “Friends” — 2004\n\nMatt LeBlanc — Zero wins, three nominations\n\nBest Comedy Actor, “Friends” — 2002\n\nBest Comedy Actor, “Friends” — 2003\n\nBest Comedy Actor, “Friends” — 2004\n\nDavid Schwimmer — Zero wins, one nomination\n\nBest Comedy Supporting Actor, “Friends” — 1995\n\nMatthew Perry — Zero wins, one nomination\n\nBest Comedy Actor, “Friends” — 2002\n\nCourteney Cox — Zero nominations\n\nSo, there you go. Kudrow is the most nominated actress in both fields, earning the most Emmy bids across her career with a huge 15 citations while also picking up the most nods specifically for “Friends” with six nominations. She is also only one of two of the six “Friends” actors to win an Emmy. Both she and Aniston won for “Friends,” although Kudrow won for Comedy Supporting Actress and Aniston took home Comedy Actress. However, seven of Kudrow’s 15 citations came for producing. She has the same amount of bids for acting as Aniston — eight each.\n\nAll six of Kudrow’s “Friends” bids came for Comedy Supporting Actress, which is the most nominations in any one category out of all six of these performers.\n\nCox is the unlucky one here. She is the only one of these six great comedic actors to never secure an Emmy nomination for “Friends.” In fact, she has never been nominated for any acting performance in her career and her only bid came as a producer on “Friends: The Reunion.” She and the five others were nominated for that show in 2021 for Best Variety Special (Pre-Recorded).\n\nMake your predictions at Gold Derby now.
