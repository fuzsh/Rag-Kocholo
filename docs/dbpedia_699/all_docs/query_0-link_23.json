In 1897, hoping to find relief for his father's painful, debilitating rheumatism, Hoffmann began searching through decades-old research and conducting experiments in the company lab. On 10 August 1897, he discovered a new process for modifying salicylic acid into acetylsalicylic acid. He took the drug home and gave a dose to his father, whose pain vanished almost immediately. It was Hoffmann's boss, Heinrich Dreser, who coined the name Aspirin, and credit is also due to early 19th century scientist Charles Gergardt, who discovered essentially the same chemical compound but failed to recognize its medicinal value.\n\nHoffmann continued his experiments, and eleven days later he synthesized medicinal diacetylmorphine -- heroin -- which Bayer marketed as a cough suppressant. He was soon promoted to department head, but Hoffmann was paid no royalties, as the German Patent Board determined that his chemical tinkering was not sufficiently novel. Originally a prescription drug sold as a bottled powder, Aspirin in tablet form was approved in America for over-the-counter sales in 1915. The reason why aspirin works was unraveled decades later by Nobel laureate John R. Vane.\n\nUniversity: BS Chemistry, University of Munich (1891)\n\nUniversity: PhD Chemistry, University of Munich (1893)\n\nBayer AG Chemist (1893-1928)\n\nNational Inventors Hall of Fame 2002\n\nNew!\n\nNNDB MAPPER Create a map starting with Felix Hoffmann\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
