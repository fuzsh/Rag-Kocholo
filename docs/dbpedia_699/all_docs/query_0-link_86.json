        "text": "LeanIX Virtual Workspaces make it possible for enterprises to operate across a shared IT inventory while setting specific access rights to protect confidential data or reducing the complexity of a workspace for certain business units. LeanIX admins now have the ability to decide which users can access Fact Sheets and to segment their workspaces according to e.g. enterprise brands or business unitsâ€”all while e.g. keeping a common Business Capability model intact. The new feature is based on a flexible concept using Access Control Entities (ACEs) and Access Control Lists, and a group-view is available built-in to allow for centralized analyses.\n\nIn this webinar, our Product Manager, Felix Hoffman will be conducting a deep-dive session about Virtual Workspaces on 4th July 2019 at 3-4 pm CEST. We will also cover best practices, tips and tricks for Virtual Workspaces use cases.\n\nHighlights:\n\nUnderstand the difference: Virtual Workspaces vs Role-based Access Control (Authorization)\n\nPre-requisites to start with Virtual Workspaces\n\nOverview of Access Control Entities (ACE) and Access Control List (ACL)\n\nAssign ACLs to users and LeanIX Fact Sheets\n\nUse-case demonstration"
