Urgent call from the clinic: Not for the first time, Dr. Felix Hoffmann the comfortable TV evening for use in the emergency room. He spontaneously takes over the night shift for a colleague. The ward doctor has no idea what consequences the next few hours will have for him and his girlfriend Celine. When a patient dies in the emergency room, Dr. Hoffmann does not believe in a natural death. The Ukrainian Misha Chenkov was part of a cleaning crew at the hospital and was therefore no stranger to him. In addition, he was recently released from the clinic in good health - but his patient file has disappeared. Dr. Hoffman tells his girlfriend Celine about the case. She immediately has a suspicion and wants to investigate the matter. So the two stumble into a criminal case and become more and more involved in the mafia-like machinations of the clinic management.",
