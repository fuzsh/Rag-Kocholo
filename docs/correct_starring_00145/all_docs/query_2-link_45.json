        "text": "Brat Pack\n\nAmerican actors\n\nBrat Pack, the name of a group of actors who starred alongside one another in several coming-of-age films throughout the 1980s. The term was originally disparaging, though it came to be embraced by some fans. The members of the Brat Pack vary depending on which source is consulted, but they typically are considered to have been:\n\nEmilio Estevez\n\nAnthony Michael Hall\n\nAndrew McCarthy\n\nJudd Nelson\n\nMolly Ringwald\n\nAlly Sheedy\n\nVarious combinations of these actors appeared in movies throughout the decade, though the entire group never featured together in one film. Classic Brat Pack films include The Breakfast Club and St. Elmo’s Fire (both 1985).\n\nNew York magazine and the Brat Pack label\n\nThe term Brat Pack was coined by New York magazine writer David Blum in a profile of several up-and-coming actors published in June 1985. That spring, Blum flew from New York City to Los Angeles to interview Emilio Estevez, a son of Martin Sheen and brother of Charlie Sheen (both of whom are also actors). Estevez had appeared in several films, including Francis Ford Coppola’s The Outsiders (1983), the action-comedy Repo Man (1984), and the high-school drama The Breakfast Club. Blum’s initial goal was to write solely about Estevez, but, when the two met, Estevez invited Blum out with his friends, Rob Lowe and Judd Nelson, both of whom had just finished working with Estevez on the soon-to-be-released film St. Elmo’s Fire. (Lowe had also worked with Estevez in The Outsiders, and Nelson had starred with him in The Breakfast Club.)\n\nFrom this night on the town with Estevez and his friends, Blum composed his New York cover story, titled “Hollywood’s Brat Pack,” as a critical glimpse into the lives of the young actors. Blum dubbed Estevez “the unofficial president of the Brat Pack,” playing off of the iconic 1960s-era “Rat Pack,” which included famous carousers such as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis, Jr. Blum classified the newly anointed Brat Pack as the Rat Pack’s ’80s equivalent, “a roving band of famous young stars on the prowl for parties, women, and a good time.” The profile described the pack’s night out in detail, portraying them as privileged and haughty. Blum named success as the most critical aspect of the Brat Pack’s lives, writing:\n\nFor one of the pack, [failure] is a mortal sin—because what makes you a member, what makes you a Brat, is the ability to be in a position where Hollywood needs you more than you need Hollywood.\n\nBlum also proclaimed Taps (1981), a drama about military cadets that featured Tom Cruise, Sean Penn, and Timothy Hutton, to have been the first Brat Pack film. He listed several other actors whom he considered to be part of the Brat Pack, noting their connections to one another and to big players in Hollywood. His list included Cruise, Penn, Hutton, Matt Dillon, Andrew McCarthy, and Nicolas Cage. Blum did not include any actresses, only briefly mentioning Demi Moore (a St. Elmo’s Fire cast member) and Melissa Gilbert (former star of the TV show Little House on the Prairie) in terms of their romances with Estevez and Lowe, respectively.\n\nImpact of the Brat Pack label\n\nMany young actors of the 1980s became associated with the Brat Pack label, including:\n\nMatthew Broderick\n\nJon Cryer\n\nJohn Cusack\n\nCorey Feldman\n\nJami Gertz\n\nJennifer Grey\n\nCorey Haim\n\nDiane Lane\n\nMary Stuart Masterson\n\nMatthew Modine\n\nCharlie Sheen\n\nEric Stoltz\n\nLea Thompson\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nFollowing the article’s publication, many of the actors mentioned, particularly Estevez, Lowe, and Nelson, felt betrayed by Blum’s depiction of them. Despite their objections, “Brat Pack” quickly became the common name for the group of actors. Ironically, a number of actors who came to be regarded as Brat Pack members—namely, Anthony Michael Hall, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy—did not feature in the story, but the title stuck to them regardless. As a result, the friendships that had formed between some of the actors were damaged because quite a few of them did not want to be caught in public hanging out together. In Susannah Gora’s book You Couldn’t Ignore Me If You Tried: The Brat Pack, John Hughes, and Their Impact on a Generation (2010), Sheedy said the article “just destroyed [the group]. I had felt truly a part of something, and [Blum] blew it to pieces.” Other Brat Packers, especially Hall and Nelson, insisted there was no Brat Pack; in fact, Hall and McCarthy had never even met each other.\n\nSome actors named in the article, such as Cruise and Penn, managed to shake off the association easily, such that many film fans and critics came to forget they had ever been considered part of the group. At the same time, the label continued to be applied throughout the 1980s to numerous other young actors and actresses, many of them being tagged with the label simply because of their age and because they had, at some point, been cast in a film that was geared toward teenagers or young adults. In 2024 McCarthy told reporters that the label “represented a seismic cultural shift” in which “movies were suddenly about kids.…Some people loved that, and some people thought we were brats.”\n\nBrat Pack films\n\nDespite Blum’s claim that Taps was the first Brat Pack movie, many film buffs classify a Brat Pack flick as being one in which multiple members of the classic Brat Pack lineup appear together. Moreover, all Brat Pack movies feature a coming-of-age plotline. According to that definition, there are 12 Brat Pack films, released between 1983 and 1990. The collaborations began with Estevez and Lowe in The Outsiders, a story of rival teen gangs in Oklahoma in the 1960s that also starred Dillon, Ralph Macchio, Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, and Diane Lane. Other Brat Pack films that meet this definition include Class (1983), Sixteen Candles (1984), Oxford Blues (1984), Pretty in Pink (1986), Blue City (1986), About Last Night… (1986), Wisdom (1986), and Fresh Horses (1988).\n\n(Discover “12 Essential Brat Pack Flicks.”)\n\nThe most prominent Brat Pack films, however, are John Hughes’s The Breakfast Club and Joel Schumacher’s St. Elmo’s Fire. These two films feature over half of the classic Brat Pack lineup and, notably, complement each other in terms of the life stages that they address. The Breakfast Club, which starred Estevez, Hall, Nelson, Ringwald, and Sheedy, centers on five high-school students who become unlikely friends while assigned to all-day detention. St. Elmo’s Fire, which starred Estevez, Lowe, Nelson, McCarthy, Moore, and Sheedy, follows the lives of recent college graduates struggling with adulthood. (Mare Winningham also starred in the film, and yet, in what remains an unsolved mystery of the 1980s, she fully dodged the Brat Pack label.) Betsy’s Wedding (1990), a romantic comedy featuring Ringwald and Sheedy, is considered to be the last film in the Brat Pack genre.\n\nAll the Brat Pack actors continued to do notable work, as actors, directors, or writers, though with different career peaks and valleys. Their careers also continued to overlap occasionally. Both Moore and Nelson had recurring roles on the television series Empire (2015–20), and Ringwald and Sheedy reunited in an episode of Single Drunk Female (2022–23). In 2024 Ringwald and Moore appeared in the miniseries Feud: Capote vs. the Swans.\n\nIn early 2024 McCarthy announced that a documentary titled Brats would air on Hulu later that year. Inspired by McCarthy’s memoir Brat: An ’80s Story (2021), the documentary promised to feature interviews with his fellow Brat Packers Moore, Sheedy, Estevez, and Lowe, as well as with Blum, the journalist who gave them their infamous name."
