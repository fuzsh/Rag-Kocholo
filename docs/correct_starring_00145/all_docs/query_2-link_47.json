        "text": "Rob Lowe’s iconic career spans four decades in film, television, and theater. He is also an acclaimed author and has been nominated for two Emmys, six Golden Globes and four Screen Actors Guild Awards, in which he won two. He has starred in the ‘80s classics \"St. Elmo’s Fire,\" \"About Last Night,\" and \"The Outsiders,\" as well as television classics such as \"The West Wing\" and \"Parks and Recreation.\" Rob’s incredibly diverse career also includes scene-stealing work in \"Behind Candelabra,\" \"Austin Powers,\" and \"Tommy Boy.\" His two memoirs, \"Stories I Only Tell My Friends\" and \"Love Life,\" are both New York Times Best Sellers. He has taken his first memoir and made it into a touring show called \"Stories I Only Tell My Friends: Live!,\" which received rave reviews throughout the country and sold out in London. Rob also directed and starred in a remake of the four-time Academy Award-nominated film, \"The Bad Seed,\" and starred alongside Kristin Davis in \"Holiday in the Wild\" for Netflix. Rob recently starred in and produced FOX’s highly anticipated \"9-1-1\" Texas-set spinoff \"9-1-1: Lone Star\" alongside Liv Tyler. Created and executive produced by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Tim Minear, the series was the highest rated broadcast drama debut in five years and FOX’s most-watched drama debut in 11 years. Lowe has been married to jewelry designer, Sheryl Lowe, since 1991. They have two sons, Matthew and John Owen."
