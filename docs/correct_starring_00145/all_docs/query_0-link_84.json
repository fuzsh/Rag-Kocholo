Using a home computer and some old-fashioned teenage ingenuity, they create Lisa (Kelly LeBrock), a stunningly beautiful woman with a mind of her own.

Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling), the high school heartthrob, is the object of Samantha's affection while she is relentlessly pursued by a nerdy freshman named Ted, (Anthony Michael Hall). As the day unfolds, hilarious and heartfelt moments ensue, culminating in a memorable birthday that Samantha didn't expect. This film marks an important milestone in teenage films for its honest depiction of adolescent life.\n\n3\n\nEmilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson\n\nReleased : 1985\n\nDirected by : John Hughes\n\nIn the film The Breakfast Club, five high school students, each representing a different stereotype, meet in detention.

As they spend a Saturday together under supervision of the strict assistant principal Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason), they gradually open up to one another, revealing their deeper selves beneath their public personas.
