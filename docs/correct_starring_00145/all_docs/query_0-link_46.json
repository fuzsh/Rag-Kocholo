        "text": "Roger Ebert (may he rest in peace) said this about Johnny Be Good: ” ‘Johnny Be Good‘ is completely bereft of comic imagination” and “There is no possible motivation for [the final] scene, except for the obvious one – artistic bankruptcy” as well as “The screenplay for this movie bears every sign of being a first draft – a quick and dirty one. The movie doesn’t feel written, it feels dictated.” Not exactly a ringing endorsement, eh? It currently sits at 0% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. To put in perspective what that means, Gigli sits at 7% fresh. So this film is widely recognized as a shit sandwich by pretty much everyone. Well, except me, I guess. I’ll agree to disagree with Mr. Ebert on this one.\n\nThe premise of this film is pretty simple – Johnny Walker (Anthony Michael Hall) is the best high school quarterback in the country. Every school is licking their chops at his talent and wants him at their school and they will do anything to get him. Johnny is a kid who comes from a humble home. His father has passed away and he lives with his mother (Deborah May), his grandfather (George Hall) and his brother and sister. So when colleges are offering big money for him to attend, he is listening, much to the chagrin of the family and his beautiful girlfriend Georgia (Uma Thurman, smoking hot in her first film role). Johnny considers himself a package deal with his best friend Leo (Robert Downey, Jr.), so both are getting propositioned from all sides, including overtures made by their high school coach Wayne Hisler (Paul Gleason, also Mr. Vernon from The Breakfast Club). Johnny’s recruitment circus is being followed closely by an NCAA recruitment investigator (Robert Downey Sr.), and shit blows up like The Godfather as it’s clear that violations abound in certain schools’ pursuit of him.\n\nHere are four reasons that this film is still worthy of a watch:\n\n4) Paul Gleason as Coach Hisler and his clothes\n\nPaul Gleason is amazing in this. Not only does he build off his asshole performances in Trading Places and The Breakfast Club , he brings some kitsch to this one. As the clueless head coach of Johnny’s team, Hisler is married to Connie, played by Jennifer Tilly, a woman who throws Tupperware parties. Still. I know this was made in 1988, but didn’t that shit go out of style in 1972? Clad in some of the sweetest gear this side of Paul Newman‘s wardrobe in Slap Shot, Hisler really spells C-L-A-S-S. The shirt pictured above is really the tip of the iceberg. Screenshots were pretty scarce, but you should watch this film alone to see his yellow suit. It is unreal.\n\nFor all of his attempts at being sneaky, Hisler really just comes off looking like a dumbass. But don’t let that fool you as he’s still one of the best characters in the film. His lack of social awareness (he drives a Pacer for God’s sake) is actually kind of endearing. Obviously he’s a better football coach than he is a schemer or being a social animal.\n\nHere is the speech he gives just before the state championship football game:\n\n3) Jim McMahon‘s cameo\n\nIf you lived in the 80s and you don’t know who Jim McMahon is you might have been living under a rock…or just aren’t a sports fan. “The Punky QB” played for probably the best pro football team ever assembled, the 1985 Chicago Bears. He was known for his outrageous behavior and for being trouble for then NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle. Was he the best quarterback? No. But he had more personality than all of them. That he’s doing an Adidas commercial is comical because he was fined for wearing an Adidas headband which was against league rules. Suck on that, Rozelle.\n\nYou can watch his cameo here.\n\n2) Anthony Michael Hall is all growns up\n\nFrom the time I saw him in Six Pack, shaking the dew off his lilly, to watching him in Johnny Be Good, Anthony Michael Hall completed a perfect transition from nerd extraordinaire or “King of the Dipshits” as his character Ted exclaims in Sixteen Candles, to the guys who dates the hottest girl in school and someone who everyone wants a piece of. His comedic timing evolved over the films he did with John Hughes (RIP) and works well in this film. Perhaps his stint on Saturday Night Live in 1985-1986 helped with this, although I recall those episodes to be below average. All the same, it’s nice to see AMH pick up where his character, Gary Wallace, left off in Weird Science. This was his last “big” leading role in film – he did play the villain in Tim Burton‘s Edward Scissorhands in 1990. A fitting way for a young talent to go out? I’d say no, but I think it provides ample humor despite the film’s serious shortcomings. I have always hoped he would have a big comeback. Perhaps Tarantino can write him into something. I mean, he helped out John Travolta‘s one-note ass. Why not AMH?\n\n1) Robert Downey, Jr. is off his ass funny\n\nAs bad/good as this movie is, one thing is certain: Robert Downey Jr. had obvious talent. He steals the show as Leo Wiggins, Johnny’s best friend and back-up quarterback. His crazy monologues/diatribes are quite funny and his facial expressions are so expressive, it’s no wonder he was chosen to play Charlie Chaplin in Chaplin. It’s not strange that he appears in this film as he co-starred with AMH in Weird Science, Saturday Night Live and showed his own range between these two and Johnny Be Good when he appeared in Back to School (a character similar to Leo Wiggins), alongside fellow AMH– brat packer Molly Ringwald in the Hughes-ian The Pickup Artist and showed his more dramatic side in the adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis‘ debut novel Less Than Zero.\n\nThe funniest part besides when RDJ tries to “smell it” at the beginning in Coach Hisler’s speech, is the stories he tells the girls they pick up at Murf’s Better Burger:\n\nAll in all the production of this film is pretty sorry. It may have the worst sound production of any film I’ve seen in some time. The amount of ADR (additional dialogue recording) is so obvious, it hurts. Seems like half of the dialogue was redubbed. One astonishing thing about this film is that Robert Yeoman, the director of photography for all of Wes Anderson‘s films, shot this film as well, much like two-time Oscar-winner Janusz Kaminski shot Vanilla Ice‘s Cool As Ice.\n\nThis, like many of the movies of the time, are time capsules of the period in which they were shot. Looking back, it’s probably best that some stay that way. The events that occur in this film are so over-the-top and unbelievable, it’s hard to argue where Roger Ebert was coming from. Still, I find this film fun to watch and laugh at. One of the best parts about this film to me is that I saw this in theater with my grandma. The only other films I remember seeing with her in the theater: Disney’s Song of the South and Chariots of Fire. Quite an eclectic set of movies, no? A cultured woman, for sure.\n\nAnyhither, give this one a spin if you want to see Anthony Michael Hall right before he fell into oblivion.\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\nHere is the entire movie, should you feel frisky:\n\nLast week, I wrote about my 10 favorite scenes to open a film. So, in the parlance of our time, turn about is fair play – so I thought I’d write about my favorite ending scenes. As I thought this over and compiled my list, I couldn’t narrow it down to only 10 and even 15. So here are my top 16 favorite film endings. The ending of a film can be a revelation, tying the entire film you just watched all together in a perfect bow, it can leave the resolution to characters’ dilemma open-ended allowing you the license to think and discuss what became of them and the events before, it can piss you off asking what the fuck the writer and director were thinking (Oliver Stone – I’m looking at you for that shit ending to Savages, which sucked anyway), or it can totally destroy a film begging you to ask yourself why you just wasted the 90-120 minutes you just spent watching it.\n\nNow, Let it be known that watching many of these may give away key points to the films. I will have tried to list which have spoilers. Beware.\n\nLastly, I urge you to watch all of the following films. They are all fantastic. They wouldn’t have left the impression on me that they did if they weren’t.\n\nHere we go…\n\nKontroll (2003)\n\n(this is the entire film – watch from 1:43:20-1:46:20)\n\nIt is unfortunate that this film remains relatively unknown to many in this country. It’s really incredible. I was fortunate to see this at the Chicago International Film Festival in 2004 where it won the Gold Hugo, its top prize. And well deserved, I might add. The film follows a group of slacker subway ticket controllers in Budapest as they try and find out who has been pushing patrons in front of oncoming trains. Led by Bulcsú (Sándor Csányi), the group must deal with their hotheaded boss, rival gangs of ticket controllers, punk kids and an ethereal girl dressed in a bear and fairy costumes (Eszter Balla) who may or may not really exist. This film is extremely ripe for interpretation and presents many mysteries that challenge its viewer. That it is Hungarian probably turns some people off. Don’t let that bother you – you know you watched Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and that shit had subtitles too. This may not have hot ass kung fu, but it does have a narcoleptic who provides very funny comedic moments and a peek into a different slice of the world you might not otherwise see.\n\nThis film ending may not mean much without the entire context of the film, but I do know it is one of the most satisfying I’ve seen. I’ve provided a link that allows you to watch this badass film for free. DO IT.\n\nKiss Me Deadly (1955)\n\nSPOILER – this one pretty much gives away the entire premise of the film, so BEWARE.\n\nMade at the height of the Cold War, Kiss Me Deadly is exceedingly representative of the Red Scare and McCarthyism. A film noir staple, this one’s got it all – beatings, intimidation, dames, broads, cars, guns, double-crosses…and a mysterious box that everyone seems to want to get their hands on. The ending is one of the more twisted and deranged I’ve seen, but it fits so well with all of the other bizarre shit that happens before it. Without a doubt one of the most memorable I’ve seen and it certainly deserves to be on this or any best-of ending list.\n\nHeaven (2002)\n\nThis film features Cate Blanchett, who I feel is the finest actress working today. Typical of her role choices, this is one you wouldn’t expect from many Hollywood women. She plays a school teacher living in Italy whose husband dies of a drug overdose. When she sees a chance to get even with the powerful drug lord who was responsible, she plants a bomb intended to kill him. When that plan goes wrong, four innocent people die. With the help of a young policeman (Giovanni Ribisi), she escapes and goes on the run. The film ends with the inevitable confrontation between her and the police and what director Tom Tykwer (who has two films appear on this list) gives us is one of the most elegiac endings I’ve ever seen. It completely blew me away.\n\nThe Breakfast Club (1985)\n\nProbably the most the iconic ending of all the films from my childhood. I’ve recently written about this film here so I won’t elaborate too much more than I already have. This ending is a great example of the synergy of filmmaking elements – music, narration and editing all play keys roles in contributing to why I think this ending is so wonderful. Without Brian Johnson’s (Anthony Michael Hall) narration of the letter coupled with the Simple Minds’ song “Don’t You (Forget About Me)” and the cuts between Vernon (Paul Gleason) in the library and John Bender (Judd Nelson) walking home over the football field, I don’t think this would have been anywhere near as successful and the perfect culmination of the events we had witnessed the prior 97 minutes.\n\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975)\n\nSPOILER ahead – not in the scene above, but the text below.\n\nIn the portion of the film that precedes this one, you just can’t get over how damn depressing it is. Chief (Will Sampson) suffocates McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) after he’s been lobotimized. Just gutting. But what comes next is uplifting and really takes the edge off that scene. McMurphy’s death, both in the physical and spiritual sense (Nurse Ratched and the doctors took care of that over time), gave life to Chief who can be held no more by confines of the sanitarium and in a way, gives life to the rest of the group who remain. I remember seeing this film at a very early age (perhaps too early – Todd Solondz would have been jealous) and it left an indelible mark on me. This is my father’s favorite film of all-time (outside of Lonesome Dove, which is technically a mini-series) so it always reminds me of him.\n\nThe Bad News Bears (1976)\n\nThe inappropriateness of this ending is what touches me so deeply, I think. That any film would show kids from 11-13 years old drinking beers and cursing after losing in the championship of a Little League baseball tournament hits this guy right where it hurts – these are kids, especially Tanner (Chris Barnes), who could have been me. Their philosophy of “Wait ‘Til Next Year!”, a favorite mantra among us poor Chicago Cubs fans, is also one I employ in my real life, always banking that next year will be better (it usually isn’t). This ending also marks the transformation of manager Morris Buttermaker (Walter Matthau, so perfectly cast) from drunk who cares about nothing but himself and his liquor to showing this band of misfit kids how to be ballplayers, how to never give up and play the game the right way. Except for the beer. And cursing. That the other parents join in the celebration in this clip is unreal.\n\nThis ending is the product of its times, which is good. Not a chance this ending is ever made today. Case in point: the what-I-assume-is-a-SHITTY-remake Richard Linklater put together (never have and never will watch it – why mess with perfection?) in 2005. In the end of that one, the kids drink non-alcoholic beer. SIGH. I also love the pull back of the camera capturing the American flag in the frame. ‘MURICA!!!\n\nThe 400 Blows (1959)\n\nThis ending literally stunned the jury and everyone else at its screenings at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival. 27-year old François Truffaut, film critic-turned-director, earned Best Director for The 400 Blows and helped usher in the French New Wave with the film. And the ending of this film is one of the most famous in film history. The freeze-frame of Antoine Doinel (played by Jean-Pierre Leaud), Tuffaut‘s alter-ego, looking directly into the camera was nothing like anything that had been done before, especially in french cinema where the young critics who turned into filmmakers (Godard, Resnais, Chabrol, Rohmer and Rivette) had grown tired of the boring traditional filmmaking that had occurred since the war. They sought to change it and boy did they ever. This final shot of Antoine leaves us to wonder whether he will emerge from the shitty circumstances that led him to reform school or if he will fall back into the behavior that got him there. Neither hopeful nor pessimistic, Truffaut leaves the viewer to decide what Antoine’s fate is…at least with this film. He did go on to make three more films about Doinel (all played wonderfully by Leaud).\n\nPerfume (2006)\n\nSPOILER – this clip and subsequent commentary gives the ending of the film away.\n\nAs a HUGE fan of Patrick Süskind‘s novel Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, I was always wary of whether it could make a great or even good film. With many sequences inside the head of protagonist Jean-Baptiste Grenouille and the overwhelming description of the olfactory smorgasbord he encounters in the novel, I just wasn’t sure it could be done. Tom Tykwer, along with German superproducer Bernd Eichinger (may he rest in peace) and Andrew Birkin, crafted a script that captured the best elements of the book and transferred them to the screen…well, except Dustin Hoffman‘s Italian-esque accent – what the fuck was that? Anyway, this is a grisly story and Grenouille’s (Ben Whishaw, the new Q in the Bond films, worked nicely in his role) fate deserves something special. Just when we think he’s gotten away with his murder spree at his trial, we get the proper ending that Süskind gave us in the book, which is absolutely fitting given his actions throughout the film. And thus the magic of cinema takes us by surprise again.\n\nNo Country for Old Men (2007)\n\nThis is quite possibly the most polarizing ending of a film I’ve ever witnessed. When I saw this film in the theater, about 80% of the people there moaned and complained out loud about how terrible it was. To me, it seemed like the perfect ending to such a brutal film, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) telling of a dream about his dead father ushering him to heaven, there waiting for him. As Bell states, he is about 20 years older than his daddy ever got to be and I think that this dream revelation he gives also tells us why there is no country for old men like him – bored, desperate now that he is retired, waiting to meet his daddy on the cold, dark mountain, horn of fire in hand. This ending is pure Cormac McCarthy, writer of the novel on which this film is based. While the film adaptation of the ending is different as Bell tells his wife about the dream, the book describes it as sort of in Bell’s head without him verbalizing it. This film ends very abruptly and I think is a bit confusing to people who may not be aware of the book or how McCarthy writes. That doesn’t take away from how honest and fabulous it is.\n\nThe King of Comedy (1983)\n\nSPOILERS in the clip and the comments.\n\nScorsese is insane. He makes touchpoint films that resonate well after they are released and The King of Comedy is one of them as I wrote here. With all of the intense interest in “celebrity” culture, now so more than ever, this film remains increasingly more pertinent. What is depicted in the clip above is suspect as we don’t know if these events are really happening or if they are just the machinations of antihero Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro). If you’ve seen this film, you know that Pupkin has a mock talk show set in his mother’s basement where he practices his comedy routines and television demeanor.\n\nSo this film comes full circle from when Rupert acts out a scene at the beginning of the film as if Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis as a stand-in for Johnny Carson) asks him to take over his talk show for 6 weeks to the epilogue where he is a huge thing and everyone wants a piece of him. That the announcer says Rupert’s name seven times in his introduction is a key to me that this is all a delusion – hearing his name on television is all he’s ever wanted. That he is such a hit elsewhere – new TV show, book deal, fans greeting him at prison – is also a key. I could be wrong here, of course. Nonetheless, it’s a fascinating ending to an incredible film. One of Scorsese‘s best.\n\nSe7en (1995)\n\nSPOILER: this pretty much gives it all away. If you haven’t seen this film and plan on doing so, don’t watch or read.\n\nDirector David Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker bring the thunder in this thriller. John Doe (Kevin Spacey) takes detectives Mills (Brad Pitt) and Somerset (Morgan Freeman, another role in which he gets to play the wise, old sage) to the brink of his own madness. With 5 of the deadly sins already acted out by Doe and his victims, the ending gives us the final two – envy and wrath. This is one the most clever and creepy endings to a movie I’ve ever seen. Who can blame Mills for what he does even though Somerset is right? Doe does win by Mills blowing him away. Mills doesn’t break his character, though. It would have been a cop out (pun intended) if he had not shot Doe for his transgressions and I’m glad that Fincher and Walker kept it that way. Everything that Mills does leading up to this moment leads us to believe he would shoot him. It makes for a far more powerful ending and is a good comment about mankind’s will to do/not to do the right thing when faced with extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThere Will Be Blood (2007)\n\nWho would have thought this film, of all things, would be the impetus for one of the more overused memes in recent history? Milkshakes. This final scene is the culmination of a man, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis in one of his most exquisite performances), completing his fall from venerable oil man to money hungry lout. Where we probably once respected Plainview for having taken in the young son of a worker killed in an accident and stood up for himself against bigger oil outfits, that respect has all but gone by this point in the film. I must sickly admit, though, that I found some pleasure in Plainview’s extermination of Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) in this clip. Supposedly a man of God, Eli, like Daniel, becomes a money hungry cretin, forsaking his duties as a preacher in the quest for the wrong almighty…the dollar. Look no further than this clip that comes before the “I drink your milkshake” portion:\n\nEli cashes in his faith, his beliefs for money: “I am a false prophet. God is a superstition!” He is as soulless and Daniel is, but his transgression is far worse than Daniel’s, who never postures as anything but who he is – a businessman. While brutal and unflinching, this ending is the logical course of the film and one that has made a lasting impression on me since I first saw it.\n\nMemento (2000)\n\nSPOILERS\n\nSince this film is told backwards, the ending of the film is actually the beginning of the story. It’s here we see Leonard (Guy Pearce) begin his quest anew in his search for John G., the man who he believes murdered his wife and damaged his hippocampus, giving him a condition where he can’t make new memories.After putting in the work, trying to figure maintain coherence, you get here and it sets everything up that you just saw. The real question is: can you remember what you saw prior to this scene to piece everything together? That he lists Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) as the John G. he’s looking for as a grudge gives an insight into Leonard that up to this point we wouldn’t have imagined. Teddy is perfectly correct when he says, “You don’t want the truth. You make up your own truth.” And when Teddy catches Leonard’s ire…it’s lights out.\n\nThis is a film that really needs several views to grasp what’s going on. Director Christopher Nolan is very tricky in the editing of the film and hides nice little morsels in there that sway the meaning of the film…should you catch them. If you don’t, the meaning changes, which isn’t a bad thing. Couple that with its reverse structure, which mirrors Leonard’s condition, and you have a truly unique film that will likely blow your mind. One of the most original films in years, this is a can’t miss.\n\nThe Usual Suspects (1995)\n\nSPOILER – this will without a doubt give away one of the best endings ever. If you haven’t seen the film and plan on doing so, DO NOT watch this or read the commentary below.\n\nIf you’ve seen this film, you know why this ending is so badass. The real question isn’t whether Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey, yet again on this list) perpetuated the crime that killed Hockney (Kevin Pollak), McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fenster (Benicio del Toro) and Keaton (Gabriel Byrne). This clip leaves no doubt in that. The real question is, is Kint really Keyser Söze or is he capitalizing on the myth/legend of Keyser Söze, one that he tells to Agent Kujan (Chazz Palmintieri)? There is no definitive answer that I’ve ever seen, although I would fall into the latter camp. This is undoubtedly the best twist ending ever in my mind, much better than The Sixth Sense and even better than Psycho.\n\nThe Thin Blue Line (1988)\n\nOnce again – SPOILERS.\n\nThis film literally saved a man’s life, much like the Paradise Lost films have done for the West Memphis Three. Think about that. If it weren’t for the inquisitiveness of director Errol Morris, the absolute finest documentarian working today, Randall Adams would still be serving his life sentence for murdering a police officer, a crime he never committed, had he not passed away in 2010. The absolute power of this film is unparalleled. Not only did Morris, with the help of several other folks in Texas, do the legwork to uncover the inconsistencies in the testimony, HE GOT THE DAMN CONFESSION OF THE REAL KILLER. He did what no officer of the law could do and he did it through film. If this doesn’t convince people of just how influential films can be, ask Randall Adams’ ghost. This is one of the most amazing films ever made and would fall into my top 10 favorites of all-time.\n\nRushmore (1999)\n\nThis film has my favorite ending to any movie I’ve ever seen. The tensions and rivalries that have gotten the better of the characters Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), Herman Blume (Bill Murray) and Rosemarie Cross (Olivia Williams) throughout the film come to pass here. Max has moved past his crush on Miss Cross and is now dating Margaret Yang (Sara Tanaka), but there is work to be done, wounds to be healed including Max’s. When Reuben (Stephen Dignan), the DJ at the cotillion, spins Faces’ “Ooh La La” and the first guitar chord hits, it’s like magic. When Miss Cross removes Max’s glasses in this scene, she is reflecting back on her husband, Rushmore-alum Edward Appleby, who passed away and is the reason she is teaching at Rushmore. Earlier in the movie, she tells Max, “You remind me of him, you know?” And here it’s come full circle. She looks at Max like we assume she looked at Edward Appleby, whom she knew her whole life.\n\nThe usage of slow motion in this scene, a technique favored by director Wes Anderson in the final scene of every film he’s made up to Moonrise Kingdom where it was noticeably absent, is superb. It allows us to linger in this moment, to cherish what these characters are feeling as they’ve finally rounded this corner that caused them all so much grief. The song coupled with this technique are so perfect. For the first time, we see all of the major players of the film – Max, Blume, Miss Cross, Max’s father (Seymour Cassel), Margaret, Max’s best friend Dirk Calloway (Mason Gamble) and even Rushmore headmaster Nelson Guggenheim (Brian Cox) – in the same frame, happy. Without a doubt, one of the most cathartic film moments I’ve ever witnessed. Part of me wishes life was a never ending loop of this scene – slow motion dance and Faces’ “Ooh La La.” What a wonderful world it would be.\n\nI haven’t assigned a number to each of these as I had in the post about my favorite openings. This list was too hard to quantify in that way. I can honestly say that the endings to Rushmore and The Thin Blue Line are the two that hit me most on an emotional level and I would feel safe slotting them in at #1 and #2. Other than that, I can’t do it.\n\nJohn Hughes would have been 63 today. His death in 2009 shocked me even though he had been out of the public eye for years and hadn’t directed a film since Curly Sue in 1991. Hughes was the absolute MAYOR of the 80s. His youth/teen films raised the bar for the genre and, in my opinion, have yet to be eclipsed. But he was more than just a teen film director. His adult comedies were as pertinent as anything he did in the teen realm, echoing the same themes of acceptance and understanding all while bringing the funny sprinkled with moments of levity.\n\nHughes‘ films are important to me. I hold them as dear to my heart as any film(s) that I’ve ever seen. I saw Weird Science at the Rivoli Theater in downtown Muncie, Indiana, when my parents were in court over visitation rights. I couldn’t imagine a better way to have staved off the nervousness I felt that day. I happily recall watching Sixteen Candles with friends, rewinding about a hundred times the scene where Anthony Michael Hall is dancing with Molly Ringwald and farts, laughing equally hard each time. Ferris Bueller’s Day Off may or may not have been the inspiration for my own two-week school skipping streak in 7th grade. These films helped me with the rough road through adolescence, showing me that insecurity, dysfunction and all of the other problems of youth were the norm, not the exception. I don’t think I’m alone in feeling that and I believe that’s why his films resonated so well then and continue to do so to this day.\n\nI have been trying to rack my brain and I can’t think of another filmmaker that had a run of success in such a short time as John Hughes did from 1983-1987. As prolific as Rainer Werner Fassbinder was (is this the first time Hughes and Fassbinder have been mentioned together, I wonder?), I don’t think he even put up the resume that Hughes has. Woody Allen has had some good runs in his life, but none quite so strong as Hughes. Let’s take a look at the the films that Hughes either wrote or wrote/directed in this time period:\n\nMr. Mom (1983) – wrote\n\nNational Lampoon’s Vacation (1983) – wrote\n\nNate & Hayes (1983) – wrote (I had never heard of this one)\n\nSixteen Candles (1984) – wrote and directed\n\nThe Breakfast Club (1984) – wrote and directed\n\nNational Lampoon’s European Vacation (1984) – wrote\n\nWeird Science (1985) – wrote and directed\n\nPretty in Pink (1986) – wrote\n\nFerris Bueller’s Day Off (1986) – wrote and directed\n\nSome Kind of Wonderful (1987)- wrote\n\nPlanes, Trains & Automobiles (1987) – wrote and directed\n\nBy my count, that’s 11 films, eight of which represent some the most well-known and iconic films of the decade. Hughes only directed three other films past this period – She’s Having a Baby, Uncle Buck and Curly Sue – all fair films, I suppose, but none match the beloved status of the bulk of the list above. While he continued to write mostly family films (Home Alone series, Beethoven series) for years after pulling his best Keyser Söze (And like that, poof. He’s gone), he never quite captured the magic he had from 83-87. That’s a pretty tall order in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAs is the norm, here are my 5 (cheated, really 6) favorite works to which John Hughes contributed and why they still rock:\n\n5) Mr. Mom (tie)\n\nThe Wall Street Journal just declared the caricature of inept stay-at-home dads depicted in Mr. Mom dead just a couple of weeks ago. However, the appeal of this movie still endures. Michael Keaton‘s portrayal of Jack Butler, the former GM engineer who lost his job and now stays home with the kids, is incredibly funny and I believe was probably pretty spot on for the time. I was raised by my father and I can certainly say that he was far more able to raise three kids than poor Jack, but this would seem more the exception rather than the rule. I think that’s why this is so enjoyable for me as it gives me an insight to what my childhood could have been like with a more maladroit father. Keaton is loveable despite his cringe worthy displays. For example:\n\nAll this aside, this film was pretty groundbreaking. Showing a woman, Caroline (played magnificently by Terri Garr), who is out in the workforce while the children are at home, succeeding and moving up the corporate ladder? I can’t recall a single film like it at the time. And as is typical, Hughes gives his characters some really great, memorable lines:\n\nIf Mr. Moms are indeed dead, then I’m glad we will always have this record to remind us of their haplessness. For that, John Hughes, I say thank you.\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\n5) National Lampoon’s Vacation (tie)\n\nThe first in the Vacation series by National Lampoon, and undoubtedly the best, Hughes adapted a short story he wrote while working for advertising/public relations firm Leo Burnett (you can read it here) to start the journey of the Griswolds on-screen. Hughes seems to be especially hard on fathers in his films, and this one is no exception. Released in the same year (1983) as Mr. Mom, they seem to be perfect companion pieces to one another.\n\nAs most everyone knows, this movie follows the Griswold family – Clark (Chevy Chase), Ellen (Beverly D’Angelo), Rusty (Anthony Michael Hall) and Audrey (Dana Barron) – as they traverse the country from Chicago to California on their way to Wally World, America’s Favorite Family Fun Park. Convinced that driving is the only way to travel, the Griswolds stop at roadside attractions as well as seeing some family. Randy Quaid makes his first appearance as white trash Cousin Eddie and is in fine form. After a series of car breakdowns, getting lost in the ‘hood of St. Louis, nearly getting arrested for animal cruelty, a dead aunt, and a near adulterous encounter, Clark glides the finally happy family into the parking lot of Wally World…only to find out that it’s closed for two weeks. The final punctuation on a road trip where not much else could have gone wrong. So, he takes matters into his own hands…\n\nAn homage to all shitty family road trips, National Lampoon’s Vacation hits the proverbial nail on the head. Even as stupid as Clark seems, he still has a the biggest heart and wants nothing but the best for his family. Unfortunately, he fucks it up every time, a motif that plays itself out over the course of the three other films in this series – European Vacation (without a doubt the absolute worst of the bunch – that Hughes had anything to do with this one makes me sad), Christmas Vacation and the awful Vegas Vacation, whose only saving grace is the appearance by Wayne Newton.\n\nFar and away the best part of this movie, I still laugh hysterically each time I see it:\n\nThe edited version for TV is nearly as funny: What I look like – Christopher Columbo?\n\nSo if you’re preparing to take the kiddos to Disney (as I am in May – God help me) or any other long road trip, give this one a watch and learn what not to do.\n\nHere is the trailer:\n\n4) The Breakfast Club\n\nThe quintessential 80s angst film, The Breakfast Club has comedic moments, but this one hits a closer to the bone than the rest of his films. Set in Saturday detention, five seemingly different high school students – a nerd (Anthony Michael Hall), a freak (Ally Sheedy), a popular rich girl (Molly Ringwald), a popular wrestling star (Emilio Estevez) and a hood (Judd Nelson) – are charged with writing an essay telling the tyrannical Assistant Principal Mr. Vernon (Paul Gleeson) who they think they are. As the day progresses, the group of teens go back and forth, attacking one another, reconciling, telling each other their tales of why they are there. The more time they spend together, the more they realize they are alike.\n\nThis was one of the two films (St. Elmo’s Fire being the other) that spawned the term The Brat Pack and solidified Molly Ringwald‘s short-lived status as Hollywood’s “it-girl.” This of all of Hughes‘ films still seems to resonate the most, ring as the most timeless. These characters still exist in today’s high schools (watch Nanette Burstein‘s documentary American Teen for easy examples), so it’s no wonder why Hughes is/was the teenager’s poet laureate. Its anti-authoritarian message certainly helps.\n\nThe ending sequence is pretty unforgettable (pun intended), as Vernon reads the essay that the five left behind, Anthony Michael Hall narrating. That Simple Minds’ “Don’t You (Forget About Me)” plays over it (flush with a Truffaut-like freeze frame) really is the perfect accompaniment, an anthem that all high schoolers echo just wanting to be noticed.\n\nI always adored this moment. Even though I was only in fifth grade when this came out, it struck a chord. While I couldn’t know the rough waters I’d have to tread when in high school, this was a nice primer and one of the many reasons I cherish Hughes‘ oeuvre. I think it was this film that Hughes found his full voice as a writer. You could see traces his craft coming together in his previous films, but this is a fully realized work that melds the comedic and serious perfectly.\n\nHere is the trailer:\n\n3) Ferris Bueller’s Day Off\n\nIt doesn’t get much more iconic than Ferris Bueller. This movie drips cool, well…with the exception of Cameron’s (Alan Ruck) stupid ass Detroit Red Wings jersey. That sucks. Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick‘s signature role) is the guy everyone wants to know in high school – friend to all, big and small, cool or not.\n\nWhen Ferris decides to fake being sick (who can be expected to go to school on a day like this?), an elaborate process that dupes his clueless parents, but not Vice Principal Edward R. Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), Rooney decides to catch Ferris and make him an example, in order to show other students that the path Ferris has chosen is wrong. Thus unfolds an epic game of cat and mouse between Rooney, Ferris and Ferris’ girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara),best friend Cameron and his sister Jeanie/sometimes Shawna (Jennifer Grey).\n\nCameron is actually sick, but Ferris cons him into driving Ferris around for the day. Cameron is also a tight ass (if you stick a lump of coal up his ass, in two weeks you get a diamond) who needs to have some fun. So they embark on a journey for the ages, taking in the sites of Chicago and breaking through some barriers for each of the characters.\n\nIf you didn’t want to be Ferris Bueller in 1986, then I don’t know what to say about you. Who didn’t want to sing Wayne Newton and The Beatles on a float in a German parade through the streets of Chicago?\n\nIncidentally, I lost a bet to my mother on whether the person singing “Danke Schoen” was a man or a woman watching this movie the first time.\n\nThis is one of the most fun movies I’ve ever seen and may well be Hughes‘ finest creation. I think it, along with The Breakfast Club, is probably the most enduring as its themes are also universal. As Polonius said to Laertes in Hamlet: “This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man.” I think Ferris followed this advice better than anyone. He never misrepresents himself to anyone he’s with, even to Rooney, and I think that’s why he’s such a relatable character. This was Hughes‘ biggest strength as a writer. It is evident in every film discussed here and why we are still talking about these films.\n\nShout out to Joshua Budich for the badass poster and Maxim Dalton for the killer board game image.\n\nI hope The rebelliousness of Ferris is alive and well among the youth of today. If not, you must be a bunch of boring bastards…\n\nHere is the trailer:\n\n2) Sixteen Candles\n\nI’m not sure how I originally stumbled upon Sixteen Candles when I was a kid. I can’t remember if we just happened to pick it up at the video store (yes, kids, there used to be actual stores where you could go rent videos, not DVDs) or if we had seen some preview for it. I wasn’t exactly following certain directors’ work back when I was 9. Or was I? Nonetheless, this movie floored me with its humor, its depiction of family as insanely fucked up, and the hope that things you wish for may actually come true.\n\nThe story centers around Samantha Baker (Molly Ringwald in her first real starring role) who turns 16. However, her birthday happens to fall on the day before her older sister Ginny (Blanche Baker) is getting married. Since her family is up to their eyes in wedding details, they forget that it’s Sam’s birthday. An obvious nightmare for anyone, let alone a girl on her sweet sixteen. The scene when she realizes this is perfection, truly setting up each of the family member’s characters in a short 45-second scene. Watch:\n\nSam has one more big issue in this film as well, and that’s Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling). She has a crush on him, but he is the most popular guy in school, very rich and is dating the hottest girl in school, Caroline Mulford (Haviland Morris). When she passes a note that falls to Jake accidentally, he finds out about this. As she tries to make things happen with Jake, she is followed around by a geek and self-professed “king of the dipshits” named Ted (Anthony Michael Hall), who incessantly tries to pick her up. Couple all of this with being saddled with taking her grandparents foreign exchange student, Long Duk Dong (Gedde Watanabe), to the school dance where Jake will be, and she’s got a lot on her plate.\n\nOne of the biggest successes of this film is that it is also Anthony Michael Hall‘s coming out party. He really established himself as a quality comedic actor in this film. He had obviously worked with Hughes material in National Lampoon’s Vacation before, so perhaps that was to his advantage. His character is so slimy, yet so endearing that you feel sorry for him. Also, he is the chief architect of a few of the film’s funniest scenes, e.g. when he and his friends (one being a young John Cusack) meet Long Duk Dong for the first time at Jake’s party, the aforementioned dance sequence, and when he takes a drunken/passed out Caroline to meet his friends in the middle of the night.\n\nBut ultimately, this is Samantha’s journey. We ride the roller coaster with her, and at times, it is difficult. The talk she has with her father (Paul Dooley) after he realizes they forgot her birthday was very real and quite spot-on. Or I imagine it is as I’ve never had this talk with a teenage girl or been a teenage girl, but Hughes situated it where I could empathize. Not an easy task. While this film has its share of juvenile humor (it is a film about high school after all), it has a heart and certain characters end up showing this even when you think that they aren’t able.\n\nThis is for you ladies:\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\n1) Weird Science\n\nSo this is number one. With a bullet. This may be one of the three funniest movies I’ve ever seen. A absolute riot from start to finish, this was kind of a surprise from Hughes who with Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club had added more drama to each film leading up to Weird Science. It’s juvenile, filled with raunchy humor and is a departure from the prior formula he employed. And it works. WELL. At least in my opinion. It is far and away the Hughes film that I watch most and that it why it grabbed spot #1 on this list.\n\nThe basic premise is two losers, Gary (Anthony Michael Hall in his finest role) and Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith), can’t fit in. Picked on, abused by cooler kids, and ignored by all girls, they decide to build their own woman using Wyatt’s souped up computer while his parents are away for the weekend. They cull the most beautiful images from Playboy magazines, give her genius intelligence and finish the job by harnessing the electricity from a thunderstorm to give her life a la Dr. Frankenstein all while wearing bras on their heads (ceremonial). And BOOM! They have Lisa (Kelly LeBrock).\n\nSo it becomes Lisa’s mission to help make the guys transition from being nerds to cool. Not an easy process considering what she has to work with. She starts off with them in a night on the town, which quickly goes from bad to worse. But then, Gary hits his stride amid the funniest scene in the entire film. Watch:\n\nFats, man…let me tell you my story, man. Were funnier opening words to a story ever uttered? Methinks not.\n\nAnd let’s credit Hughes for maybe the best part of this film – the creation of Chet (Bill Paxton), Wyatt’s older brother and caretaker while his parents are away. Abusive and gross in every sense of the word, Chet represents what these two are up against every day of their lives. And Wyatt, chicken shit that he is, takes everything Chet has to give, served in a dirty ash tray. Chet extorts him and abuses him verbally and physically. But when Lisa enters the story, things start to change even with Chet. All that aside, I would argue that Chet is the second best movie character next to Reg Dunlop (Paul Newman) in Slap Shot. And Paxton‘s performance pretty much rules. Who else can say, “But first, I’d like to butter your muffin…” any slimier than he does? I dare you to find someone. DARE YOU.\n\nThe guys have their eyes on two girls, Deb (Suzanne Snyder) and Hilly (Judie Aronson) at school, but they happen to be dating Gary and Wyatt’s arch nemeses, Ian (a very young Robert Downey, Jr.) and Max (Robert Ruslan). Lisa decides to help the guys out and throw a BIIIIG party at Wyatt’s house and invite everyone. When the guys stay in bathroom, Lisa does what she can to coax them out and prove their meddle so Deb and Hilly will see them for who they are. This of course yields two of the funnier parts of the film, but it’s here they make their final transition from nerds to being not necessarily cool, but noticeable, shall we say.\n\nWhile it doesn’t have quite the same touching ending that both Sixteen Candles or The Breakfast Club have, Weird Science earns its ending. While Hughes moved on to more adult and family friendly fare after this (with exception of maybe Uncle Buck which treads some of the same water here), I’m so glad he squeezed this one in.\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\nSo as I said before, Hughes left a mark on my childhood – his films helped me navigate the unsteady times of adolescence. These films are signposts that me and many of my friends can point to as we continue to try and make our way through this world. Hughes‘ passing in 2009 was tragic because he gave voice to my generation. While he hadn’t spoken for it in quite some time, he still held that title when he died and I believe he continues to do so. There are rumors that one of his unproduced scripts in moving into production. PLEASE DON’T. Let the man rest. There is a reason that project went unproduced.\n\nAs I was thinking about this list, I was surprised that I couldn’t really think of any dramas that were as quotable as comedies, specifically those of those of my youth. Perhaps it’s because we watched the comedies at least 10 times before we had to return the videotape back to the video store. You remember what those look like, right? Rewinding them was a bitch.\n\nWe all know that Casablanca has 145 incredibly famous, quotable lines. We can take This Is Spinal Tap and Slap Shot as a givens. Films like these are in the canon of quotable movies and will be passed over here. My wife said this list is more about me and people I hang out with than anything about quotable movies, and that if I really wanted to list quotable films, I would list things like When Harry Met Sally or other fluffy nonsense. While that she may be correct about this list, that ain’t happening, my love. You may be smarter than I am, but no one I know quotes movies like WHMS and the like so they will also be absent from this list of triple-delicious quotedom as well.\n\nI know there are many that would include Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy on this list. I can’t understand why people like it. I thought it was a piece of shit. I posted about it here if you’re interested in my one sentence review.\n\nSo, that said, here are the five films that I believe to be the most quotable from my vast movie watching experience:\n\n5. Clerks\n\nKevin Smith‘s raucous and raunchy debut Clerks was a revelation at the time of its release. At least to me. Living in southern Indiana at the time, we were only used to getting big blockbuster fare and romantic comedies. So when I talked three friends into going to see it with me (reluctantly), we were all bowled over by its expletive-laden dialogue and its, truth be told, frank portrayal of the lives of two convenient store-working slackers, Dante (Brian O’Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson). Perfect combination for the time it was released. One of the funniest theater experiences of my life. Say what you will about Smith and his films, but I love this one.\n\nThe Quotability Factor (QF) on this film is pretty high. Some of the highlights:\n\nDante: “My girlfriend sucked 37 dicks” Customer: “In a row?”\n\nRandal: “I’m a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class. Especially since I rule.”\n\nJay (Jason Mewes): What’s up babes? What’s up, sluts?\n\nDante: “Are there any balls down there?” Jay: “About the biggest pair you’ve ever seen, dingleberry!”\n\nDante: “I’m not even supposed to be here today!”\n\nJay: “I don’t care if she’s my cousin or not, I’m gonna knock those boots again tonight.”\n\nRandal: “I don’t appreciate your ruse, ma’am.” Customer: “I beg your pardon?” Randal: “Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.”\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\nIt’s raw, low-budget and flawed, but it’s still wonderful and continues to make me laugh this very day.\n\n4. Better Off Dead\n\n1985, the year of “The Super Bowl Shuffle” and Gorbachev’s ascendency, might have been the best year ever for quotable films, three of which appear on this list. The Goonies, Fletch, and The Breakfast Club were all released in 1985 and don’t make this list. Better Off Dead also was released in 1985, the first of the ’85ers to hit my list at #4.\n\nBetter Off Dead is pure 80s goodness. Completely bizarre and super depressing if you think about what Lane Meyer (played by John Cusack at his absolute finest) puts himself through. BoD follows Lane as he falls from being a mid-level ski jock at his high school in Vermont, dating a hot girl whom he loved very much, only to have it all come crashing down when the aptly named Roy Stalin (Aaron Dozier) comes to the school, steals his girl Beth (Amanda Wyss) and his spot on the ski team. Lane then tries to kill himself in various different ways to cope with the pain, stopping before the act is committed. All that changes when French foreign exchange Monique (Diane Franklin) moves into the house next door.\n\nThis movie has a supporting character that easily rivals all other supporting characters in quotability and general awesomeness – Charles De Mar (played by Curtis Armstrong also known for his role as Booger in the Revenge of the Nerds movies).\n\nThe QF for this film rates high, chock full of memorable moments. The great quotes come from a range of folks, from the main players to even the most ancillary characters. Here’s a taste:\n\nMailman (Taylor Negron): Hey Badger, your book on how to pick up trashy women came today. What’s a little boy like you doing with big boy smut like this?\n\nCharles De Mar: “The K-12 dude. You make a gnarly run like that and girls will get sterile just looking at you.”\n\nTree Trimmer (Steven Williams): “Now that’s a real shame when folks be throwin’ away a perfectly good white boy like that.”\n\nAl Meyer (David Ogden Stiers): “I know it’s bacon… but what have you done to it?”\n\nCharles De Mar: “Do you have any idea what the street value of this mountain is?”\n\nLane Meyer: “No, tentacles. N-T. There’s a big difference.”\n\nRoy Stalin: “You’d make a fine little helper. What’s your name?” Charles De Mar: “Charles De Mar.” Roy Stalin: “Shut up, geek.”\n\nJohnny Gasparini (Sebastian Dungan): “I want my two dollars!”\n\nCharles De Mar: “Man, you’re the hottest thing since sunburn!”\n\nLane Meyer: “Which is better, speaking no English at all, or speaking Howard Cosell?”\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\nBetter Off Dead is a tasty 80s treat. It hasn’t aged as well as some films and the humor probably is a little goofy compared to today’s standards. However, if taken as an artifact, it’s incredibly insightful, funny and wonderful. And the soundtrack is INCREDIBLE. All the Howard Jones you can get your hands on.\n\n3. Weird Science\n\nWhere do I begin with this one? This is my favorite of the John Hughes films, which is a large statement given the run of absolute comedy/quotable gold he was on in the middle to late 80s. The first time I saw Weird Science was at the Rivoli Theater in Muncie, IN – a magical theater that is long gone unfortunately. Another ’85er on the list.\n\nWeird Science tells the story of two high school losers, Gary Wallace (played by Hughes all-star Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt Donnelly (Ilan Mitchell-Smith), guys who are picked on, ridiculed and bullied. Since they are the anti-Spanish Fly with women, they decide to make their own woman when Wyatt’s parents are out of town. When they are successful, Lisa (played by Kelly LeBrock who undoubtedly caused massive amounts of carpal tunnel for young men in the mid-80s) tries with all of her powers to make them cool. Wyatt’s prickish older brother Chet (Bill Paxton in a game changing role, one of the absolute best in any Hughes film) does his best to thwart their attempts.\n\nThe QF for this film is off the charts. Age plays a role in this one falling to #3, but, truth be told, it can hold its own on any given day in quoteworthiness. Gary Wallace could sneak to the top of the list of most quotable characters should one ever surface. Take that Rick Blaine! The other star of the show is Chet. Just an amazingly awful, gross, loathsome character, but one I cherish to this very day.\n\nTake a look:\n\nGary: “There are chicks outside and you’re dropping wolf bait!”\n\nChet: “You’re stewed, buttwad!”\n\nThe absolute best scene in the entire film, all of it quote worthy:\n\nWyatt: Gary, don’t you feel like a chicken? Gary: Wyatt, if I could shoot an egg out my ass right now, I would! Look we can deal with shame, death is a much deeper issue.”\n\nGary: “Why don’t you shut up, bitch?”\n\nChet: “But first I’d like to… butter your muffin.”\n\nGary: “Then bang! We hit the city baby, dead on! For a little drinks, a little night-life, dancing.”\n\nAl Wallace (Brit Leach): “Soir-what?”\n\nLisa: “This is a Pershing missile, Chip!” Chet: “It’s Chet…my name is Chet! And I didn’t think it was a whale’s dick, honey!”\n\nChet: “The boozehounds return. What a joke!”\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\nJohn Hughes had a talent that is hard to match. I miss him everyday. Watch this movie and laugh your ass off. You won’t regret it.\n\n2 Swingers\n\nI still recall when my older brother called me out of the blue and said no matter what I do, I can’t miss Swingers should it play near me. He said there was one part, he didn’t need to tell me which, that he knew I would literally be on the floor laughing when it happened. I had never heard of it and kept my eyes peeled, and when it did come to my college town, I jumped all over it. It was an amazing experience, and one that I will give full credit to my brother for keying me into. More about that incredible scene in a few.\n\nSwingers is a tale that revolves around a group of friends who have moved to LA to try and make it in Hollywood. Mike (Jon Favreau, who also wrote the script), Trent (Vince Vaughan in his breakout role), Rob (Office Space‘s Ron Livingston), Sue (Patrick Van Horn) and Charles (Alex Desert) all vie for various acting jobs and try to portray the cool of the Rat Pack at the same time. Mike, however, is still trying to get over his girlfriend dumping him six months prior. His friends rally around him to get him back in the game…with mixed results. Written with crackling dialogue, Swingers rewrote cool for the 90s.\n\nThe QF for Swingers is second only to one other film in my opinion. Here are plenty of examples as to why that is:\n\nMike: “You ever been to the Ha-Ha Hole?”\n\nTrent: “Baby, we’re going to be up five hundy by midnight!”\n\nRob: “You better replace the pin, Chi-Chi. The natives look restless.”\n\nMike: “And it’s like I’m supposed to be all happy ’cause she’s wearing a backpack, you know?”\n\nTrent: “Look, you take yourself out of the game, you start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course its going to end up on the friendship tip.”\n\nMike: “Haven’t you seen Boyz in tha Hood? Now one of us is gonna get shot!”\n\nCharles: “This place is dead anyway.”\n\nTrent: “Hey! What’re you kicking me for? You want me to ask? All right, I’ll ask! Ma’am, where do the high school girls hang out in this town?”\n\nMike: “Well…we’re not in Kansas anymore…”\n\nThis is the scene of which my brother was speaking:\n\nAs soon as the organ music from Sega’s NHL ’94 started, I immediately was in tears because I knew what was coming. One of the best scenes in any movie. EVER. My cousin’s special ladyfriend even made this for me recently:\n\nTrent: “Baby you are so money and don’t even know it.”\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\nTrent is clearly the star of the show. He is responsible for probably 85% of all quoteworthy moments in the film. It’s a shame that Vaughan hasn’t been able to recapture the magic from this film in any of his others. Nonetheless, Swingers is one of the finest comedies of its day and will remain quotable for years to come.\n\nAnd now the drum roll….\n\n1. The Big Lebowski\n\nSo here it is – the Holy Grail of all quotable movies: The Coen Brothers‘ The Big Lebowski. For a film that did very modestly at the box office, especially in contrast with their prior release Fargo, The Big Lebowski has one of the biggest followings of any movie in history. Outside of sci-fi franchises like Star Wars and Star Trek, how many films have spawned their own yearly festival? Can’t be that many.\n\nI doubt many don’t know what The Big Lebowski is about, but for those of you who are not privy to all the new shit, here’s the story: Arguably the laziest man alive, Jeff Lebowski, more widely known as The Dude (Jeff Bridges), is confused for another Jeffrey Lebowski by a pair of thugs. The other Jeffrey Lebowski is a well respected businessman and millionaire whose wife owes the thugs’ boss, porn-king Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara), money and they have come to collect mistaking The Dude for the rich Lebowski. After rolling his apartment and roughing The Dude up, Woo (Phillip Moon) pisses on the rug in The Dude’s living room, which really tied the room together. The Dude decides, after consulting his cohorts, the high strung Vietnam veteran Wlater Sobchak (John Goodman) and the more docile Donnie (Steve Buscemi), to approach the other Lebowski to be remunerated for the pissed-on rug in the case of mistaken identity. After being thrown out and taking a rug from the residence, The Big Lebowski and his toady Brandt (Philip Seymour Hoffman) call The Dude and ask him to help them find The Big Lebowski’s wife, Bunny (Tara Reid), as she’s been kidnapped. Hijinks, misunderstandings, accidents and interpretive dances occur as The Dude tries to figure out what really happened with Bunny and at the same time keep his johnson intact.\n\nThe QF for The Big Lebowski is immeasurable since nearly every line has probably been said in thousands of different situations in every corner of the world. The Coen Brothers have always been known for their incredible writing talent, but it’s clear that this is their greatest triumph…at least when it comes to being quoted. Many of their films could make this, but Lebowski is the one that rules them all.\n\nThere are so many quotes I’d like to list here, but I will drop only a small handful. Enjoy them:\n\nThe Dude: “Nice marmot.”\n\nWalter: “Saturday, Donny, is Shabbos, the Jewish day of rest. That means that I don’t work, I don’t drive a car, I don’t fucking ride in a car, I don’t handle money, I don’t turn on the oven, and I sure as shit *don’t fucking roll*!\n\nThe Dude: “He thinks the carpet pissers did this?”\n\nWalter: “Is this your homework, Larry?”\n\nBunny: “Uli doesn’t care about anything. He’s a nihilist. The Dude: “Ooh, that must be exhausting.”\n\nThe Dude: “Careful, man, there’s a beverage here!”\n\nThe Jesus (John Turturro): Let me tell you something, pendejo – you pull any of your crazy shit with us, you flash a piece out on the lanes, I’ll take it away from you and stick it up your ass and pull the fucking trigger ’til it goes Click!”\n\nWalter: “Smokey – this is not ‘Nam, this is bowling. There are rules…”\n\nThe Dude: “Nothing is fucked here, man.”\n\nMaude (Julianne Moore): “Don’t be fatuous, Jeffrey.”\n\nThe Dude: “How are you gonna keep ’em down on the farm once they’ve seen Karl Hungus?”\n\nDonnie: “They were Nazis, Dude?” Walter: “Oh come on, Donnie – they were threatening castration. Are we gonna split hairs here?”\n\nThe Dude: “You mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie.”\n\nWalter: “Oh, please, dear? For your information, the Supreme Court has roundly rejected prior restraint!”\n\nKarl Hungus (Peter Stormare): “My name is Karl. Ich bin Expert.”\n\nThe Dude: “Mr. Treehorn treats objects like women, man.”\n\nWalter: “Hell, I could get you a toe by 3 o’clock this afternoon…with nail polish.”\n\nThe Dude: “Well…that’s just, like uh, your opinion, man.”\n\nWalter: “You are entering a world of pain.”\n\nI could actually keep going on and on and on. The Big Lebowski is a cornucopia of quotations applicable in almost any situation (“This aggression will not stand, man!” and that is why it rests atop Quotable Mountain.\n\nHere is the trailer:\n\nIf you have a Netflix account, you are blessed with being able to watch this film as many times as your heart desires as it’s available through their streaming service. And do so. It will make you a better person in the end.\n\nSo that wraps up the official list. Five great films, as quotable as any of the classics. Sally forth and quote away!\n\nBelow, I have listed three films that didn’t quite make the list, but have quote values that are still high.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nFast Times at Ridgemont High\n\nThis film covers the trials and tribulations of high school life in a California community. Written by Cameron Crowe, this is one of the more quotable 80s comedies. Jeff Spicoli (played by a young Sean Penn) is a quotable powerhouse: “This is U.S. History, I see the globe right there.” and “My dad’s a tv repairman. He has an ultimate set of tools. I can fix it.” are among his finest.\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\nMenace II Society\n\nThe only drama to appear on any part of this list, Menace II Society is a serious observation on the tough life of inner city kids living in the projects and the decisions that they have to make each day to survive. I saw this film when I was a senior in high school and equate it to hearing N.W.A.’s Straight Outta Compton for the first time. It opened an entire world to me of which was previously unknown. Unflinching in its portrayal, the dialogue was key to the understanding of the characters’ situations. “I had the dope ride, but I was sittin’ on some bullshit. I needed rims bad…and I knew just how to get ’em” So as people took to quoting The Godfather and Scarface, my friends and I took to quoting Menace.\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\nReal Genius\n\nReal Genius would likely have been #6 on my most quotable films list. Val Kilmer plays one of the all-time best movie characters in super-genius Chris Knight, who takes super-nerd Mitch (Gabriel Jarret) under his wing as he arrives at Pacific Tech University after leaving high school early. They clash with Prof. Gerry Hathaway (William Atherton) and his toady Kent (Robert Prescott) while working on a secret project for the military. When they find out what they were working on, they decide to exact revenge with the help of all their brainy friends.\n\nThe QF of this film is extremely high. The Knight character just kills it:\n\n“In the immortal words of Socrates…I drank what?”\n\n“Was it a dream where you see yourself standing in sort of sun-god robes on a pyramid with a thousand naked women screaming and throwing little pickles at you?”\n\nAnd then there is Prof. Hathaway’s all-time great quote: “You’re laborers, you’re supposed to be laboring. That’s what you get for not having an education.”\n\nAnd last but not least, let’s not forget perhaps the best line of the film:\n\nSusan Decker (Deborah Foreman): “Can you hammer a 6-inch spike through a board with your penis?” Chris: Not right now. Susan: A girl’s gotta have her standards…\n\nAn incredibly funny film chock full of quotable moments. It is another of the ’85er films, cementing it as the greatest year in quotable film.\n\nHere is the trailer:\n\nEveryone has their own list of these films. Watch them, enjoy them, pass them along to your friends. This is the great thing about watching movies – nearly everyone can relate to something in them."
