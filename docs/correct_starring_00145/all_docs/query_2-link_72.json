Listen to the conversation above, or wherever you get your podcasts, and watch the full interview below.\n\nRelated Video\n\nThe iconic actor dives into why he is so attracted to playing villains, basing his Trigger Warning character on Ted Turner, and what it was like to do big action stunts with Alba. He also discusses a TV project he’s been working on for years with good friend Robert Downey Jr. called Singularity, and how the success of HBO’s Succession forced them to rework their original concept.\n\nElsewhere, Hall touches on the impact working with John Hughes on classics like The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, and Weird Science had on his career, as well as why he chose not to appear in Andrew McCarthy’s documentary on the famed Brat Pack, Brats. (McCarthy himself was a guest on KMW last month, talking about Brats and coming to terms with being a member of the Brat Pack.)\n\nAdvertisement"
