        "text": "Anthony Michael Hall is happy to be back starring in the second season of USA Network's hit series, \"The Dead Zone.\"\n\nHe feels that this year's storylines revolving around his character, Johnny Smith, are twice as better as last year's.\n\n\"The writing is better, the characters are more solid, it's all more ambitious,\" he says.\n\nThe show is based on characters in Stephen King's novel of the same title. Smith is a young man who awakens from a six-year coma after being injured in a near-fatal car accident.\n\nHe discovers that everything that he had loved, he has now lost: his mother, his fiancée Sarah, his teaching job, etc. Yet, he has gained extrasensory powers from the \"dead zone\" in the brain. Through touch, he can see visions of the past and the future. He now has to learn how deal with this gift and the responsibilities that go along with it, as well as try to catch up on the past he's missed, and to restart his own life.\n\n\"The Dead Zone\" also features Nicole deBoer as Sarah Bannerman, Johnny's former fiancée. Sarah is now married to the county sheriff, Walt, played by soap opera actor Chris Bruno. The Bannermans are raising Sarah and Johnny's son, who was conceived on the night of the accident. Sarah still has deep feelings for Johnny and is torn in her love for him and for Walt.\n\nJohn L. Adams plays Johnny's physical therapist and friend Bruce Lewis; Kristen Dalton has the role of reporter Dana Bright. David Ogden Stiers appears as Reverend Gene Purdy, Johnny's step-father, a conservative televangelist who inherited a fortune from Johnny's late mother and has been acting as his legal guardian. Sean Patrick Flanery rounds out the cast, playing the recurring role of ambitious congressional candidate Greg Stillson, Johnny's evil nemesis.\n\nThis isn't the first time \"The Dead Zone\" has been brought to the screen. In 1983 it was made into a movie starring Christopher Walken as Johnny Smith.\n\nThe television series was developed by writer-executive producer Michael Piller, who produced \"Star Trek: The Next Generation,\" \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" and \"Star Trek: Voyager\"; and his son, co- producer Shawn Piller. Lions Gate Television and Paramount International Television, along with Piller², the Segan Company, and USA Network produce the show.\n\nHall, 34, originally from Massachusetts, now lives in California. He still has lots of family in the Boston area. \"My mother is one of 13 kids. I have seven uncles and five aunts.\" He lived in West Roxbury for the first two years of his life. His mother, a single parent at the time, was pursuing her dream to be a jazz singer. So they moved to California for a few years, and then came back east to New York, where he ultimately grew up. He says he gets back to the Boston area several times a year to see relatives.\n\nAt the moment, Hall is living in Vancouver, British Columbia where \"The Dead Zone\" is filmed. He enjoys living there. \"It's a beautiful place on an inlet with the mountains and the ocean,\" he says. Hall prides himself on being from New England. He relates to the Canadian laid-back attitude to sports and beer, and feels that it's close to that of New Englanders. With a laugh, he says he thinks there are more liquor stores in Boston than any place else.\n\nMany TV shows and movies are filmed in Vancouver, and the city has become known as \"Hollywood North.\" Economically, it's cheaper to film there. Canada also provides incentives and tax breaks to film companies, Hall explains.\n\nLast season, the filming of the 13 episodes went from March to August. Then the cast and crew had two months off, and came back for a second season of another 13 episodes in September. The new season started airing Jan. 5.\n\nRight now, they are filming episode 11. They will complete this season's filming by the end of the third week of February. \"It's a great sense of accomplishment for me,\" he says, \"to work on a series to this extent.\"\n\nWhen he's done with this season, Hall may work on some other projects. He's been offered a couple of movies, but it all depends on whether the show is picked up for a third year.\n\nThe actor says that Piller and his son Sean are creating different shows that are like \"mini-movies.\" Hall is excited that each episode is treated as though it were a $50 million movie, yet made in seven days. \"It's a different movie, a new director each week,\" he says.\n\nHall explains that this year's plotlines will work on a resolution of Sarah and Walt's relationship and how they both get along with Johnny. Sarah is torn between the two of them: Walt needs to get along with Johnny since he often wants Johnny's help on cases. \"Michael Piller wanted to align Walt and I [Johnny] as a necessity of fate,\" he says.\n\nAnother plotline deals with Johnny's continuing premonitions involving Stillson. Every time he runs into Stillson and touches him, he keeps seeing visions of the end of the world. Will Johnny have to do something to prevent this?\n\n\"Michael Piller often uses a 'Christ metaphor' for the show,\" explains Hall, a practicing Catholic. \"The character I'm playing is a mystic, an empath who helps people, and I want to make it believable. I take it seriously, but I'm having a good time.\"\n\nWhen [the show] came to me, I didn't know who Michael Piller was. He's a gentleman, a 'showrunner' -which is an executive producer who can also write.\" He's had so much success; Hall felt it would be good to work with him. And it's been a great learning experience.\n\nHe's had the chance to watch a variety of directors at work, learning their techniques for creating performances and shots. \"I love the different styles.\" In his contract, he has a deal to direct an episode next year if the show continues. He has already directed a film and music videos.\n\nThere will be several guest stars this season including Gerald McRaney, Robert Culp and British actor Peter Wingfield, as well as former \"Brat Pack\" member, Ally Sheedy, one of Hall's co-stars in \"The Breakfast Club.\"\n\nBesides acting on the show, Hall is one of its co-producers. \"I oversee many elements every day. I get updates from prep meetings, the art department and I facilitate on the set. I shadow the director, the cast and crew and the actors.\" He helps to develop a comfort level on the set. For example, he'll set up rehearsals for the actors if they request it. He also has even been dealing with the marketing of the show. \"It's been a turning point in my life.\"\n\nHall has been in the acting business for 27 years. He was given his first acting job at the age of 8 when comedian/writer Steve Allen cast him in a summer stock production of \"The Wake.\" He also changed his name as a child. When he went to get his Screen Actors Guild card, he found out that there already was a Michael Hall. So he moved his middle name in front of his first name.\n\nThough he began his career in the theater, he says he has no interest in theater acting. \"I like film and television.\" And, laughing, Hall says, \"It makes money.\"\n\nSince then, he's appeared in over 40 films and many TV shows. At first \"it was a hobby, it was fun and off the cuff.\" As a teen, he appeared in several John Hughes films: \"National Lampoon's Summer Vacation\" (1983), \"Sixteen Candles\" (1984), \"The Breakfast Club\" (1985) and \"Weird Science\" (1985). In 1985, he also joined the cast of \"Saturday Night Live\" at age 17 for a year, and was the youngest cast member \"SNL\" ever had.\n\nYet, after the hoopla of these movies went away, he discovered that's when he really became an actor. He says it was tough making the transition from teen roles to adult ones. He's been through lots of auditions and rejection. But, \"that's how you learn. You learn from failure. I've had ups and downs, and you savor the work. The hard part is dealing with 'nos.'\"\n\nHe kept at it, re-establishing his career as an actor. Some of his films included \"Edward Scissorhands\" (1990), \"Six Degrees of Separation\" (1993), and more recently, \"Caveman's Valentine\" ((2001) with Samuel L. Jackson; \"Freddy Got Fingered\" (2001) and \"All About the Benjamins\" (2001).\n\nHe also played real-life characters such as record producer Mutt Lange in the 2001 VH1 TV film \"Hysteria: The Def Leppard Story,\" pitcher Whitey Ford in Billy Crystal's 2001 HBO film \"61*\" and Bill Gates in the 1999 TNT TV movie \"The Pirates of Silicon Valley.\"\n\nHall was offered the role of Johnny Smith after Michael Piller saw him \"The Pirates of Silicon Valley.\" He had auditioned for this role, and worked hard to get it. To research the role, he read biographies about Gates and business magazines. He and his acting coach, Steve Bridgewater, would work on his speech, his posture, and the walk. Hall had two goals: to play the richest man in the world, and to be nominated for an Emmy Award. The movie was nominated for five awards but did not win one.\n\nBesides developing his acting craft, Hall has also been working on his music, which he says is influenced by rock 'n' roll, r & b and funk. He plays guitar, writes songs and sings. He made one LP a few years ago under the band name, Hall of Mirrors. Some of his music will be uploaded to \"The Dead Zone\" Web site. He hopes some will be used on the show, and to release an album of music featured on the program.\n\nRecently, Hall appeared on psychic John Edwards' SciFi Channel program. At the reading, Edwards acknowledged to Hall that the various types of shows that he had been doing over the years were meant to be and had been leading him to where he is now in his career. Coincidence or just hard work and lots of perseverance?\n\nViewers will enjoy the mixture of flashbacks, special effects, romance, mystery and humor. Hall adds that \"the show plays with time, and moral and ethical dilemmas. Johnny's visions can be portals to other worlds. The visions can take us anywhere, to the past and the future. It's a lot of fun.\"\n\n\"The Dead Zone\" airs on the USA Network, Sundays, 10 p.m. and midnight; Thursdays, 11 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m.; and on the SciFi Channel, Fridays, 7 p.m. For more information about the show, go to http://www.usanetwork.com/series/thedeadzone\n\nSue Klasky can be reached at sklasky@cnc.com"
