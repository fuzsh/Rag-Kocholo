        "text": "Anthony Michael Hall and Sonya Cassidy have joined the cast of “Reacher” as series regulars for the upcoming third season.\n\nSeason 3 of the Alan Ritchson-led action show is based on the seventh book in Lee Child’s bestselling “Jack Reacher” series, titled “Persuader.” In the novel, Reacher goes undercover to rescue an informant held by an enemy from his past.\n\nHall (“Bosch: Legacy,” “Halloween Kills”) joins the series as Zachary Beck, who is described as “a formidable and successful businessman” as well as “a widow and single father of a 20-year-old son, Richard.” Zachary owns a rug import company that Reacher and his associates believe is covering for a more nefarious operation.\n\nCassidy has been cast as Susan Duffy, who is “an extremely intelligent and tough DEA agent from Boston with a sharp and sarcastic sense of humor.” Cassidy is best known for “The Man Who Fell to Earth” and “Lodge 49.”\n\nHall is represented by Untitled, A3 and Jill Fritzo PR. Cassidy is repped by UTA and Independent Talent.\n\n“Reacher” is currently in production in Toronto after the third season renewal was announced in December, two weeks before Season 2 dropped on Prime Video. During its premiere weekend, that season was the No. 1 most-watched title on the Amazon-owned streamer across TV and film.\n\nThe series is written for television by Emmy-nominated writer Nick Santora (“Fubar,” “Prison Break”), who also executive produces and serves as showrunner. “Reacher” is produced by Amazon MGM Studios, Skydance Television, and Paramount Television Studios. Ritchson joins Santora and author Child as executive producer for Season 3, alongside Don Granger, Scott Sullivan, Mick Betancourt, David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, and Matt Thunell for Skydance. Carolyn Harris and Kenny Madrid are the execs in charge of the series for Skydance."
