        "text": "1988\n\nCity Locations\n\nGeorgetown, San Antonio, Irving, Alamo Heights, TX (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nSchools/Colleges, Mansions, Sports Venue\n\nLocation Styles\n\nSchool, Hotel/Motel Style, Colonial, French, Southwestern, Building Dated/Retro\n\nAbout Johnny Be Good\n\nJourney into the world of high school football recruitment in the 1988 comedy, Johnny Be Good. This American film, directed by Bud S. Smith and starring Anthony Michael Hall in the lead role of Johnny Walker, was released on March 25, 1988. The star-studded cast includes Paul Gleason, Robert Downey Jr., Uma Thurman, Steve James, and Jennifer Tilly.\n\nThe film revolves around Johnny Walker, a high school quarterback who is the object of intense recruitment efforts by several colleges. His best friend, Leo Wiggins (Robert Downey Jr.), advises him to hold out for the best deal, while his girlfriend, Georgia (Uma Thurman), urges him to enroll at the State University with her. The movie humorously charts Johnny's path as he grapples with these competing pressures and the different paths he's being nudged towards.\n\nDespite the film's unique exploration of football recruitment and the trials faced by a teenage athlete, the reaction to Johnny Be Good was less than stellar. The movie received negative reviews and only grossed $18 million.\n\nHowever, the film's soundtrack was a standout, featuring contributions from renowned artists such as Judas Priest, Saga, and Ted Nugent. Unfortunately, Nugent's song \"Skintight\" was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song in 1988.\n\nDespite the poor reviews, Johnny Be Good offers an intriguing glimpse into high school sports, the pressures of college recruitment, and the struggle of making choices at the cusp of adulthoodâall served with a generous dash of humor.\n\nJohnny Be Good Locations\n\nThe 1988 film Johnny Be Good utilized the picturesque regions of Texas as its primary filming locations. Georgetown, San Antonio, and New Braunfels served as the film's backdrop, capturing the unique charm of these Texan locales. Most scenes were shot on the school campuses of Thomas Jefferson High School, the University of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio, and Alamo Heights High School, offering viewers a genuine glimpse into the heart of Texan education.\n\nThe Bildarth Estate in Comfort, TX, served as another pivotal filming location, effectively doubling as the fictional \"Olde Tex University.\" Anthony Michael Hall, who took on the role of the country's most coveted high school football star, underwent a rigorous training program under trainer Thomas Anthony Patti. This commitment allowed him to gain 22 pounds, further enhancing the authenticity of his character portrayal.\n\nParticular scenes were filmed at specific locations, adding even more local flavor to the film. For instance, a scene near the film's end featuring Anthony Michael Hall running down a corridor was captured at San Antonioâs St. Maryâs University. Another scene was shot at Kenoâs Drive Inn grocery and bait store in New Braunfels, Texas.\n\nThese filming locations are worth visiting not just for fans of Johnny Be Good but also for those interested in exploring the diverse landscapes of Texas. From the hustle and bustle of San Antonio's schools to the quaint charm of a local grocery in New Braunfels, these locations offer a worthwhile trip down the memory lane of 1980s cinema while immersing you in Texan culture.\n\nThe film opens with a climactic scene set in a school rugby matchâthe final one of the season. Before the game begins, the coach (Paul Gleason) delivers an impassioned victory speech, setting the tone for the upcoming battle on the field. This scene serves as a powerful introduction to the movie's narrative, establishing the high stakes and the intense competition that characterizes the world of high school sports.\n\nThe Texas Stadium in Irving, a suburb located west of Dallas, served as the filming location for this memorable scene. Opened in 1971, the stadium was recognized for its one-of-a-kind architectural elementâa hole in the roof. This was due to initial plans to build a retractable roof that was eventually scrapped. The unique aesthetic of the stadium provided an authentic and unforgettable setting for the kick-off scene of Johnny Be Good.\n\nApart from this film, the Texas Stadium also appeared in numerous television series episodes, Walker, Texas Ranger (1993â2001), further cementing its place in pop culture history. However, it's important to note that the Texas Stadium is now permanently closed, and fans cannot visit the exact location.\n\nTo get to Irving from Dallas, you can take the I-35E and TX-183 W, a straightforward route that takes approximately 20 minutes, depending on traffic. While you won't be able to visit the Texas Stadium, you can still explore the city of Irving and imagine the iconic scenes filmed there.\n\nJohnny (Anthony Michael Hall), a student at the imaginary Ashcroft High School and the country's most sought-after high school quarterback, is at a significant turning point in his life. Many schools are hotly pursuing him, and his closest friend, Leo Wiggins (Robert Downey Jr.), suggests he hold out for the most appealing offer. In contrast, his girlfriend, Georgia (Uma Thurman), urges him to accompany her to State University, valuing a robust education over the glamor of football stardom.\n\nLike many others in the film, this pivotal scene occurs in the charming town of Georgetown, Texas. Known for its beautiful main street, diverse local shopping, and vibrant restaurants and bars, Georgetown is a delight for visitors. Located just under an hour from Austin, it is brimming with local charm and culture.\n\nThe Georgetown Square, often called \"The Most Beautiful Town Square in Texas,\" is a must-visit location. While the exact filming locations within Georgetown are not specified, Johnny Be Good fans can wander the streets, soak in the atmosphere, and imagine the spaces where their favorite scenes might have been filmed. A stop at the Georgetown Art Center, known for its rotating exhibitions, educational events, and artist studios, is also recommended.\n\nTo get to Georgetown from Austin, you can take the I-35 N, a straightforward route that takes approximately 30 minutes to an hour, depending on traffic. Once in Georgetown, the town square and the art center are easily accessible on foot, offering a delightful way to explore the town at your own pace.\n\nThere's a notable scene featuring a date night at a drive-in theater between main characters Johnny and Georgia after a school party. As they enjoy a romantic movie from a swing, they discuss their future plans. However, the coach interrupts their intimate moment and wants to discuss Johnny's potential selection at Piermont University.\n\nThis memorable scene was filmed in New Braunfels, at what was then known as Kenoâs Drive Inn grocery and bait store. Today, this site is recognized as the Stars & Stripes Drive-In Theatre. While the specific props and decorations from the film may no longer be present, the classic drive-in atmosphere remains intact.\n\nThe Stars & Stripes Drive-In Theatre showcases a mix of classic films and the latest Hollywood releases, making it an exciting destination for movie lovers. Fans of Johnny Be Good can visit the theater and experience the charm of the drive-in setting featured in the film. For information regarding the theater's operating hours, visit their official website.\n\nHead north on N Seguin Ave toward E San Antonio St to get to Stars & Stripes Drive-In Theatre from downtown New Braunfels. Then, continue onto TX-46 W. After a few minutes, turn right, and your destination will be on the right. Public transportation is currently unavailable.\n\nJohnny visits his first prospective university, Ol' Tex. The headmaster pulls out all the stops to entice Johnny, offering him attractive incentives like cars, cash, and free room and board. He even takes Johnny on a helicopter to the university in an extravagant gesture. The university, whose team is named the Horny Toads, goes as far as hosting a concert for Johnny and introducing him to other university stars.\n\nThis scene was filmed at the Bildarth Estate in Comfort, Texas, which was transformed into the fictional âOlde Tex Universityâ for the movie. Constructed in the early 1980s by H.W. \"Bill\" Worth Jr. and his spouse, Darolyn, the Bildarth Estate was deliberately fashioned to mirror the style of French mansions from the 19th century. One key architectural detail that sets this mansion apart is the array of 32 white columns that form a ring around the main house, situated atop Sky Line Drive.\n\nThe Bildarth Estate has since been recognized as a cultural landmark. Fans interested in visiting the location are advised to reach out to the site's administration or owners to inquire about possible visitation arrangements.\n\nTo reach the Bildarth Estate from downtown Comfort, you can follow the US-87 N and FM473 E routes. The journey is relatively short, lasting approximately 10 minutes, although this may vary due to traffic conditions. Regrettably, public transportation options are not accessible for this particular route.\n\nOn Signing Day, everyone's attention is fixed on Johnny's press conference. In a surprising twist, Coach Hisler invites four other top prospects from Johnny's high school team to join him and Johnny on stage. He then announced they would all attend Piermont the following school year, with Hisler as head coach and Johnny as quarterback.\n\nThis significant scene was filmed at Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio. This public high school, one of ten in the San Antonio Independent School District, was completed in 1932, making it the third high school built in the city. The school was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 and designated a Texas historic landmark.\n\nFans of the movie can also visit Alamo Heights High School, another filming location for the school scenes in Johnny Be Good. Located not far from Thomas Jefferson High School, Alamo Heights allows fans to see more locations familiar from the film.\n\nTo get to Thomas Jefferson High School from downtown San Antonio, you can take the US-281 N and I-10 W. It's a quick drive, roughly 15 minutes, depending on traffic. For Alamo Heights High School, take the US-281 N from downtown. The journey should take around 20 minutes."
