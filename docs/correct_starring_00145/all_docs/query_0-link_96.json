        "text": "Let’s face it. In the more recent years of Tim Burton’s career, a lot of film-lovers have counted him out of being able to make a great film. Announcements and releases of new projects are received with disappointing chatter rather than the excitement he used to drum up. Don’t get me wrong, there have been a few objectively bad films in there (Hello, Planet of the Apes!), but I don’t think the reason he’s fallen off has been because his films aren’t competent, but because once you’ve reached master status in filmmaking, it becomes more and more difficult to keep it consistent. Tim Burton is a true master of portraying the whimsical in film, and even after 30 years, we’re able to celebrate his genius with Edward Scissorhands.\n\nIt’s going to be tough not to completely sound like I’m gushing through this retro, because along with Batman Returns, this is my favorite Burton film. Growing up in a small town, the mentality that your business is everyone’s business resonates so hard with me, and the realness of it frustrates me to the point of truly understanding Peg’s (Dianne Wiest) struggles when trying to introduce an “outsider” to the town. That’s what Edward is in this film, an outsider who is expected to conform to the way things are done, and when he doesn’t, he’s vilified and chased away. It’s a unique situation that happens when you aren’t born in a small town, but move to one, and then you know you need to leave, or it will kill you. The introduction of something different to something that’s always been a certain way is seen as a threat in small towns, I’ve seen it firsthand, and Burton translated this to film spectacularly.\n\nRELATED: Tim Burton is Rebooting ‘The Addams Family’ for TV\n\nThe cast was perfectly constructed. Dianne Wiest embodied the caring mother role flawlessly. Winona Ryder, who already had rapport with Burton in Beetlejuice, did a fantastic job playing Kim and juggling the emotional need for a reliance on a friend with the fear of ruining her relationship with her incredibly jealous and unlikeable boyfriend (Anthony Michael Hall). Johnny Depp as Edward is a meek, shy, animal slowly coming out of his cave to experience the world he’s never known. We’re excited by everything that interests him, and we’re afraid of everything that scares him. We even seemingly got the perfect cherry on top, with Vincent Price’s last in-person feature role as The Inventor, Edward’s creator and father-figure. The story between the Inventor and Edward brings the heartbreak and sadness to the film that already covers all the other parts of the emotional spectrum.\n\nAs always, Burton’s character, costume, and set designs were all incredible. He used a level of flashiness that doesn’t scream “big-budget blockbuster,” but a tasteful gothic spectacle that has the audience searching every single inch of the screen to absorb more. The score for this film is my favorite Danny Elfman score, and in my opinion his strongest. Typically, Elfman is known for his main themes. You can probably hum the Batman or Beetlejuice themes right this second. Edward Scissorhands feels so different than those scores, because the pieces change so dramatically as the emotional direction in the film changes. If you’ve never listened “Ice Dance” from this score, do yourself a favor. It’s perfect for this time of year.\n\nRELATED: ‘Popeye’ Starring Robin Williams & Shelley Duvall Turns 40\n\nI wish I could put into words how this film makes me feel. I have trouble with it, because it makes me feel all the ways. As a kid, it scared me, but as the film went on, I felt bad for Edward and didn’t want him to leave to town. As a teenager, I related with Edward and I was infuriated with what he was going through, and the mob mentality of a small town. As an adult, I can look back and remember both of those stages, and then appreciate how intentional that was in the storytelling, while admiring what a gorgeous piece of art the film is. There are only a handful of films that have done that in my life. Films that I regard as masterpieces, and after 30 years, I can safely say that Edward Scissorhands is a film masterpiece, and Tim Burton is a film master.\n\nRELATED: ‘Gremlins 3’ Won’t Use CGI Creatures, Creator Says"
