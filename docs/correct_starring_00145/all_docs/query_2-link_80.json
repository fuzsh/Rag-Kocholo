        "text": "\"These are called 'school rules' - nobody cuts, nobody causes trouble...\" Brainstorm Media has revealed an official trailer for an indie comedy titled The Class, which is described as a \"modern re-imagining of The Breakfast Club.\" They didn't get the rights to remake it so they just made this rip-off of version instead. And it probably won't be anywhere near as good as the John Hughes original - this bad trailer guarantees that. A heartwarming coming-of-age drama, The Class follows a group of a high school seniors forced to spend Saturday completing a failed or missed final examâ€”and learning about the values, betrayals, and love within themselves and their classmates along the way. Starring Charlie Gillepsie, Lyric Ross, Hanna Kepple, Juliette Celozzi, with Debbie Gibson and Anthony Michael Hall. This looks like a TV remake for The CW, with barely an ounce of the same authenticity and honesty in the rather brilliant original film. That one is a timeless classic for a reason, it doesn't need a modern update like this to still be relevant to kids today.\n\nHere's the official trailer (+ poster) for Nicholas Celozzi's The Class, direct from YouTube:"
