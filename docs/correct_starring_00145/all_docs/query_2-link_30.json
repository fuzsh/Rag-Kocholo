        "text": "Now, the old friends are in development on a TV series that would mark Downey Jr.'s directorial debut.\n\n\"We wrote a TV series together, we're calling it 'Singularity,' and it's based on an idea Downey had,\" Hall told Business Insider.\n\nHall said the two have been developing it for years (it was first announced by The Wrap in 2016), and it took even longer to get off the ground once they realized what they wrote was similar to the hugely popular HBO series \"Succession.\"\n\n\"We had to change things because it wound up being too similar to 'Succession,'\" he said. \"What I mean by that is I would have played one of three sons, and the father was this tycoon industrialist. It's more of a comedic tone than 'Succession,' but it mirrored it too much, so we had to change things. Downey and I actually had a Zoom session the other day with a top producer who will hopefully come on board.\"\n\nHall also revealed that \"Singularity\" would mark Downey's directorial debut.\n\n\"He might direct the pilot and some other episodes along with being in it,\" Hall said of Downey Jr. \"He's committed to being a part of it.\"\n\nAfter four decades in the business on screen, Hall said he's focusing more on work behind the scenes. Along with developing \"Singularity,\" Hall also wrote a feature script that he plans to direct.\n\n\"It has been a passion and desire for me to do that for many years now,\" Hall said of trying his hand as a writer-director. \"It's the next evolution in my career, being behind the camera.\""
