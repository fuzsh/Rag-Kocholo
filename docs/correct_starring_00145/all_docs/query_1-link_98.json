        "text": "What if Freddy Kreuger was just a gentle soul who could make snow fall by carving ice sculptures? While not a suspenseful horror film, Edward Scissorhands (1990), starring Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder, is undoubtedly a fun pick for the Halloween season. The movie is a work of Tim Burton himself, a well-known director of many creepy delights such as Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas. If you enjoyed any of his other titles, you’ll find that Edward Scissorhands fits in perfectly with the rest of Burton’s iconic characters and their charming quirks.\n\nThe tale of Edward Scissorhands follows the titular protagonist, a mysterious man with scissors for hands. Unfortunately, these scissor-hands risk cutting everything they touch, including his own face. When Avon lady Peg Boggs discovers Edward inside a secluded castle on top of a steep hill, she takes pity on his predicament and brings him to her home in the colorful neighborhood below. It’s not long before Peg’s family, and most neighbors, take an interest in Edward, especially once they see his scissors’ artistic talent for trimming hedges and styling hair. After some hesitation, even Peg’s teenage daughter, Kim, begins warming up to him, knowing that Edward may be developing feelings for her too. However, Edward’s new life is far from perfect as he struggles to feel truly accepted by the people he works so hard to please.\n\nEdward Scissorhands is an eccentric yet touching film, being a classic that perfectly balances its hilarious and heartbreaking moments.\n\nIn one of his most famous roles, Johnny Depp puts on a stellar performance as Edward Scissorhands, while the role of Peg Boggs is excellently fulfilled by the stunning and beautiful Winona Ryder. They both play their parts with passion and emotion as their characters grow closer together as forces threaten to break them apart.\n\nFor such a silly sounding premise, Edward’s story is sure to surprise you and may even leave you in tears. By the end, the moving message of fitting in and accepting others, will guarantee you’ll be watching this special film again next year."
