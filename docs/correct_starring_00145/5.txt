Join us for an unforgettable evening with Anthony Michael Hall, featuring an exclusive screening of THE BREAKFAST CLUB complete with a special brunch menu and a Q&A with Hall after the film!

From the age of just seven years old, Anthony Michael Hall was a true pop culture icon of the 80's. In addition to his role in THE BREAKFAST CLUB, Hall starred in iconic films like NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION (Rusty Griswald), SIXTEEN CANDLES (The Geek), WEIRD SCIENCE (Gary Wallace). Following a one-year stint on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, Hall starred alongside Johnny Depp in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (Jim). Hall's most recent work has been focused on television, including an 81-episode run on Stephen King's THE DEAD ZONE, but has managed to take on film projects as well, including the role of Mike Engel in THE DARK KNIGHT.

In addition to acting, Hall has also pursued his musical talents, as songwriter and lead singer of his band, Hall of Mirrors, which was formed in 1998. Hall helps at-risk youth via the Anthony Michael Hall Literacy Club and lives in Los Angeles, California.
