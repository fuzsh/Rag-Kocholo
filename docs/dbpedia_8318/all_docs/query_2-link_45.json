But playing TWO leads on the same show is reserved only for Alexandra Chando. The Pennsylvania native plays identical twins Emma and Sutton on The Lying Game and couldn't be having a better time. Not only because the show was picked up for another season which starts in January, but because they get to film it in Austin, TX, one of our countries great emerging cities. Hook 'em horns!"
