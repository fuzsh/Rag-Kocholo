        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Ben Rappaport (Younger) and Alexandra Chando (The Lying Game) have been cast as the leads of NBC‘s untitled drama pilot based on the award-winning Dutch series Adam & Eva. The pilot is written by The Village creator Mike Daniels and will be directed by Stephanie Laing.\n\nThe project, described as a funny and heartfelt drama, chronicles the epic love and lives of two complete strangers, Adam (Rappaport) and Eva (Chando), whose multiple run-ins begin to defy coincidence, leading both to believe in fate. The show breaks the mold by pairing a serialized, stand-up-and-cheer romantic comedy with the wildly diverse and often unexpected human stories of anyone who finds themselves six degrees from Adam and Eva.\n\n2022 NBC Pilots & Series Orders\n\nRappaport’s Adam is a former high school teacher and romantic trying to find his footing in Brooklyn after a devastating breakup. Chando’s Eva is an aspiring artist and force of nature whose relationship and views on fate are put to the test when she meets Adam.\n\nThe Dutch series, which drew critical acclaim and ran from 2011-16, starred Teun Luijkx as Adam and Eva van de Wijdeven as Eva.\n\nThe adaptation is produced by Universal Television in association with 6107 Productions, David Janollari Entertainment and Willy Waltz International.\n\nDaniels, Laing, David Janollari, Rob Golenberg and Alon Aranya executive produce alongside Robert Alberdingk Thijm and Norbert ter Hall. Chris Markey serves as supervising producer.\n\nFor the People and Outsourced alum Rappaport has been recurring on NBC/Uni TV’s Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. His series credits also include Inventing Anna, Younger, Mr. Robot and The Good Wife. Rappaport currently stars onstage as Jack Paar opposite Sean Hayes in the world premiere of Good Night, Oscar at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago, which closes April 24. He is repped by Gersh, Invictus Entertainment and Goodman Genow Schenkman.\n\nChando received a Daytime Emmy nomination in 2007 for her role on As the World Turns.
