The young actress has also been hard at work bringing a rather different kind of fiction to life. She is part of the cast of the upcoming horror film, “County Road K.”\n\nThe independent film tells the tale of a mysterious stranger spending a night in a secluded home with a family who harbor a violent past and a deadly secret. It was written and directed by comic book author Philip Gelatt. Production began late last month in New Jersey. It should see a release late next year."
