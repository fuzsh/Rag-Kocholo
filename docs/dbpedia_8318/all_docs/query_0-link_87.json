        "text": "The new webseries Talent is our latest guilty pleasure. From the executive producers of Pretty Little Liars, the series follows two best friends, Harper and Danielle, as they try to survive and make it in L.A. Harper, played by singer/songwriter BC Jean, who also wrote Beyonce's smash hit \"If I Were A Boy,\" is a bonafide wild child rockstar...in her small town. So with the help of her business saavy best friend Danielle, played by the star of the upcoming ABC Family drama The Lying Game's Alexandra Chando, the two move out to L.A., ready to make Harper a star, but of course, trying to succeed in Hollywood is a lot tougher than it looks.\n\nWe recently sat down with BC Jean and Alexandra Chando, to talk about the show, what inspires them to keep singing and acting and how to make big in Hollywood!\n\nTM: What do you love about playing your characters?\n\nBC: Harper and I have a lot of similarities. It was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed the whole process. My hair is actually a lot shorter, so I got to put in some hair extensions, and I loved that. She reminds me a lot of myself when I first moved to L.A. I remember being 17 and moving out here and thinking that I was going to make it becasue I had all of this passion and talent but then you get a lot of road blocks and a lot of closed doors. A lot of things happen in this industry that people don't realize how ugly the business it. It's not all glitz and glam.\n\nAC: Danielle's a very smart, business saavy young lady. She's a very strong character. I like that she's strong and knows what she wants and isn't afraid to take chances. She doesn't have much exposure to the music industry, so she's going to fake it 'til she makes it! And I can definitely relate to that. You really need to be very ambitious and stick with it no matter what gets in your way.\n\nTM: How do you get past the negative comments, when you're going through the casting calls and auditions?\n\nBC: I grew up with a great family, and they have been with me from the very beginning. I give them complete credit for making me who I am and making me be stronger. My mom is also my manager. She's like my best friend, so we see each other every day. I also have a great group of friends. It's all about finding your own tribe out in L.A. It's taken me a few years, but I do have my tribe. They're wild.\n\nAC: You're constantly getting rejected in acting. You get rejected more than you get hired! There was a pilot season where I tested for three different pilots and I didn't book any of them. At that point, you get so frustrated and so tired, but you really just need to take a step back and remember why you're really doing it. There are moments like that all the time. All of the rejections just sort of roll off my back now. And you also want to have a really great support system around you.\n\nTM: What's your advice for girls who want to make it big in music or acting?\n\nBC: It sounds very cliche, but every no is one step closer to a yes. You can't just wait for things to happen. You have to keep moving forward, whether it's taking classes or writing more, you just have to do it and stay focussed on the goal.\n\nAC: The most important thing is to really have a passion for it because that's where it starts. If you go into these castings and you're constantly getting rejected and let down, it wears on you, so you really need to have a thick skin. In order to persevere you have to really want it.\n\nCheck out BC's single, \"I'll Survive You\" here, and tell us what you think in the comments!\n\n[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/v/tAuFATfKWuc?fs=1&hl=en_US[/youtube]"
