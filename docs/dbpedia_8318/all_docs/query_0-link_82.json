        "text": "Congratulations are in order for Alexandra Chando (ex-Maddie Coleman, As the World Turns), who is thrilled to have landed a lead role in a new NBC pilot.\n\nDescribed as a funny and heartfelt drama, the project chronicles the epic love and lives of two complete strangers, Adam (Ben Rappaport) and Eva (Chando), whose multiple run-ins begin to defy coincidence, leading both to believe in fate. Adam is a former high school teacher and romantic trying to find his footing in Brooklyn after a devastating breakup, while Eva is an aspiring artist and force of nature whose relationship and views on fate are put to the test when she meets Adam.\n\nAs reported by Deadline, the Mike Daniels project breaks the mold by pairing a serialized, stand-up-and-cheer romantic comedy with the wildly diverse and often unexpected human stories of anyone who finds themselves six degrees from Adam and Eva.\n\n\"Life is funnnnny. Just gotta hang in there,\" Chando shared on Instagram about landing such a spectacular role. \"Immensely excited and grateful to be a part of this incredible show.\"\n\nThe NBC pilot is based on the Dutch series A'dam - E.V.A. (meaning \"Amsterdam and many others\"), which drew critical acclaim during its 2011-16 run. The series starred Teun Luijkx as Adam and Eva van de Wijdeven as Eva.\n\nChando played the role of Maddie on As the World Turns from 2005 to 2010, earning a Daytime Emmy nomination for her work on the CBS soap in 2007. After leaving the world of daytime, she landed the lead role in the short-lived series The Lying Game, played a recurring role on Sneaky Pete, and has appeared in television series like Castle, The Vampire Diaries, and Hawaii Five-0."
