Ex:\n\nMaddie Coleman (Alexandra Chando, ATWT) is roommates with Marina Cooper (Mandy Bruno, GL) In real life.\n\nQuote Snow White:\n\nQuote cocobear:\n\nQuote Cori: Van Hansis (Luke) is Kim Zimmer's (Reva from GL) real life son\n\nReally? That would be cool, but I remember him doing an interview on soaptalk and it was never mentioned. How do you know this?\n\nI think her son played Luke before he was aged. Not the current Luke.\n\nHer son played Luke until she discovered the character was going to be written in as gay. She asked for his contract to be terminated at that point. It was then they began looking for a replacement and the gay aspect of the character’s life didn’t show up until the present actor took over.\n\noh, my bad. I read once on CBS’s website that her son was playing the role. I didnt realize it was after the actor change. I always asumed the difference in last name was because actors change their names sometimes.\n\nhey plot where have you been? good to see you on again\n\nMartha Byrne(Lily Snyder) was on an episode of i think it was Bringing Home Baby or maybe A Baby Story…when she had her second son"
