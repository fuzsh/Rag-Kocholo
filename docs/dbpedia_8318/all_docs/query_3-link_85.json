        "text": "To begin …\n\nROBERT WRIGHT AND HIS DESCENDANTS\n\n“HILLINGDON, a village, a parish, and a sub-district, in Uxbridge district, Middlesex. The village stands near the Uxbridge railway, the Grand Junction canal, the river Colne, and the boundary with Bucks, 1 mile SE of Uxbridge; was known, at Domesday, as Hillendone; and has a post office under Uxbridge, and a police station.\n\nThe parish contains also the town and township of Uxbridge, the villages of Yiewsley and Colham, and the hamlets of Gould-Green, Peel-Hatch, Colham Green, Long Atter, and Hockley Hole; and a detached part of it is encompassed by Ickenham parish. Acres, 4, 720. Real property, £32, 230; of which £200 are in the canal, and £250 in gas works. Pop. in 1851, 9, 588; in 1861, 10, 758. Houses, 2, 052. Pop., exclusive of Uxbridge, in 1851, 6, 352; in 1861, 7, 522. Houses, 1, 424. The increase of pop. arose partly from the erection of barracks.\n\nThe Uxbridge workhouse is in Colham Green; and, at the census of 1861, had 211 inmates. Moorcroft lunatic asylum is in Gould-Green; and, at the census, had 61 inmates. The manor belonged to Roger de Montgomery; passed to the Salisburys, the Lacies, the Stranges, and the Stanleys; and belongs now to the De Burghs. The old manor house has been demolished. An old rectory-house, now extinct, was used by the Bishops of Worcester, who had the rectorial titles. Hillingdon Park, or Little London, belonged to Count de Salis. Cedar House was the seat of Reynardson, the naturalist; and took its name from a cedar tree which, in 1779, measured from 12½ to nearly 16 feet in the girth of its stem, and from 89 to 96 feet in the diameter of its head.\n\nOther chief residences are Hillingdon House, H. Court, H. Place, H. Grove, Little H. and Dawley Court. Charles I. halted here, in 1646, on his way to the Scottish army. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of London. Value, £489.* Patron, the Bishop of London. The church is later English, in good condition; stands on a commanding eminence at the village; figures conspicuously over many miles; and contains a few brasses and two fine monuments. A chapel of ease, built in 1859, is in Yiewsley. A section of the parish, with a pop. of about 2, 500, was constituted a separate charge in 1865, a vicarage, with income of £230, * in the patronage of the Bishop of London. The church for it bears the name of St. Andrew’s; was built, in 1865, at a cost o £7, 700; is of yellow brick, with red brick in patterns; and consists of nave, aisles, and chancel, with tower and lofty shingle spire. The perpetual curacies of Uxbridge and Uxbridge-Moor also are separate benefices. There are national and British schools, and charities £878.-The sub-district includes also Cowley and West Drayton parishes, but excludes Uxbridge township. Acres, 5, 870. Pop., 8, 844. Houses, 1, 681.”\n\n(From John Marius Wilson, Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870-72))\n\n* * *\n\nMy great-great-great-grandfather Robert Wright (1777-1863) was born and baptised in Chalfont St. Giles, Buckinghamshire. He was ‘The son of ‘William and Ann Wright’. By about 1800, he had settled in Colham Green, near Hillingdon, Middlesex, with his wife Mary. They raised the usual large family for the period. Mary was born in about the same year. According to the 1841 census, she was ‘from Hayes’, Middlesex, though I have not as yet been able to find a definite record of either her baptism or her marriage. There was a strong Wright presence in north Buckinghamshire from the early 18th century, and familiar family names occur quite early on. A move southwards began in the middle years of the century. Robert’s parents, “William and Ann”, possibly married in 1759 in Wooburn (though these two may actually have been his grandparents.) There is also a marriage recorded between a ‘William and Ann Wright’ in Finchley, Middlesex, on the 8th August, 1774. This could be the union of Robert’s parents, given the fairly close proximity of Finchley to Chalfont.\n\n1710\n\n12th May: At the church of St John the Baptist, Hillingdon – a burial: “Mary, daughter of Tho: Wright from London”. Is there a connection ? The search continues …\n\n1759\n\nBUCKINGHAMSHIRE\n\nWOOBURN\n\n5th July: The marriage of a WILLIAM and ANN WRIGHT. Possibly Robert’s parents. (There are several Wrights to be found in Buckinghamshire throughout the available records.)\n\n1774\n\nMIDDLESEX\n\nFINCHLEY\n\n8th August: WILLIAM WRIGHT marries ANN BROWN. (Possible parents of Robert, of course, as discussed above.)\n\n1777\n\nBUCKINGHAMSHIRE\n\nCHALFONT ST. GILES\n\n5th June: “ROBERT, son of WILLIAM and ANN WRIGHT”, is baptised in the parish church. (Chalfont St Giles is within easy striking distance of the Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Middlesex borders. It is the village in which the blind John Milton completed his epic poem ‘Paradise Lost’ a century earlier as the Plague raged in London.)\n\n1820\n\nMIDDLESEX\n\nHILLINGDON\n\n18th June: THOMAS WRIGHT is baptised in the parish church of St John the Baptist. His father ROBERT is ‘a labourer’ and his mother is recorded simply as MARY. Robert and Mary’s other children have been baptised in the same church:\n\nJAMES (24th July, 1803);\n\nWILLIAM (2nd June, 1805);\n\nFRANCES (18th January, 1807);\n\nMARY (29th January, 1809);\n\nJOHN (11th March, 1811);\n\nANN (18th December, 1812; buried 17th February, 1814, aged 15 months);\n\nSARAH (18th December, 1814);\n\nGEORGE (28th June, 1818);\n\nTHOMAS (18th June, 1820);\n\nHARRIET (5th May, 1822).\n\nAll the children are baptised by the vicar, The Reverend T.Mills.\n\n2nd July: ESTHER WEATHERLY is baptised in the same church. She will marry THOMAS WRIGHT in 1843. Her name appears two entries below that of her future husband in the parish register. Her parents are GEORGE (b.1786) AND ELIZABETH (nee PAGE.) The Rev. Thomas Dawson Allen, curate, has misspelled their surname, ‘Weatherley’.\n\n1828\n\n11th October: MARY WRIGHT (b.1809) daughter of Robert and Mary, marries HENRY BAYLIS (b.1800) in the parish church of Hanwell, Middlesex. HENRY is the son of WILLIAM and MARY BAYLIS.\n\n1837\n\n7th May: Burial of ESTHER’s father, GEORGE WEATHERLY in the churchyard of St John the Baptist, Hillingdon. He is 51 years of age. The Reverend G.C.Hale, curate, officiates.\n\n1841\n\nCensus Records:\n\nThe Census was taken on the night of 6th June, 1841.\n\nCOLHAM GREEN, HILLINGDON, MIDDLESEX. (The Elthorne Hundred).\n\nROBERT WRIGHT is 65. He is a Hay Dealer. His wife MARY is the same age. In the household are their son THOMAS (b.1820) aged 21, daughters SARAH (aged 25) and HARRIET (aged 19), and a small boy, GEORGE, aged 2.\n\nThe census of 1841 doesn’t state family relationships. Little GEORGE is most likely a grandson to ROBERT and MARY – but whose child ? The baptism of a GEORGE SEATON WRIGHT on December 8th, 1839, gives a hint. The child is ‘illegitimate’, the mother’s name is SARAH – but there is no father. The child’s middle name may provide a clue.\n\nThe place they live in is changing. This part of Middlesex was mainly agricultural and market garden. Now there are brickfields for the building of London’s increasing urban sprawl.\n\nIn Hayes, ESTHER WEATHERLY is 21. She is a FEMALE SERVANT at the RECTORY HOUSE BOARDING SCHOOL for girls, which is presided over by The Rev. George Hale (see below). Her brother WILLIAM, aged 15, is recorded as a Male Servant. (There is also the VICARAGE HOUSE BOARDING SCHOOL which caters for boys. It is next door, and is presided over by the Rev. Billy Hodges, clergyman.) Esther’s widowed mother ELIZABETH is a laundress, aged 45.\n\n1843\n\nSeptember 11th: THOMAS WRIGHT (b.1820) marries ESTHER WEATHERLY (b.1820). They are married in St Mary’s, the Parish Church, Hayes, Middlesex, by the Rev. G.C. Hale, Curate. ROBERT WRIGHT, Thomas’s father, is described as a ‘Farmer’, and GEORGE WEATHERLY as a ‘Labourer’ (dead). THOMAS is also described as a ‘Farmer’. The register is witnessed by William J. Weatherly (Esther’s brother ?) and Mary Ann Weatherly. Their relationship to Esther is not specified.\n\nESTHER bears eight children:\n\nTHOMAS (baptised 21st June 1844),\n\nMARY (baptised 19th April 1846),\n\nROBERT (baptised 2nd April 1848),\n\nCHARLES (baptised 31st March 1850),\n\nESTHER (baptised 27th June 1852),\n\nFREDERICK (baptised 8th October 1854),\n\nHANNAH (baptised 20th February 1859), and\n\nARTHUR (baptised 24th March 1861).\n\n1844\n\n21st June: THOMAS WRIGHT, firstborn child of THOMAS and ESTHER WRIGHT is christened in the church of St. John the Baptist, Hillingdon.\n\n1846\n\n19th April: MARY WRIGHT, the fourth child of THOMAS and ESTHER, is baptised in the church of St John the Baptist, Hillingdon. She is named after her paternal grandmother.\n\n1848 2nd April: ROBERT WRIGHT, another child for THOMAS and ESTHER WRIGHT is christened in the church of St. Mary, Hayes, Middlesex. He is named after his paternal grandfather.\n\n1850\n\n31st March: CHARLES WRIGHT, third son of THOMAS and ESTHER, is christened in the church of St John the Baptist, Hillingdon.\n\n1851 Census Records:\n\nThe Census was taken on the night of 30th March, 1851.\n\nMIDDLESEX\n\nCOLHAM GREEN\n\nTHOMAS WRIGHT is a ‘labourer’ aged 30, married to ESTHER. To date, they have four children: THOMAS, a scholar (b.1844), MARY, a scholar (b. 1846), ROBERT (b.1848), CHARLES (b. 1850).\n\nROBERT & MARY WRIGHT are now – according to the census enumerator – 74 and 72, respectively. He is described as a ‘Hay & Straw Dealer’. In their household are also EMMA WRIGHT (b.1836), a granddaughter, aged 15, who is a dressmaker, born in the parish of St. Marylebone, and GEORGE WRIGHT (b.1840), a grandson, now aged 11.\n\n1852\n\n27th June: ESTHER WRIGHT, named after her mother, is christened in the church of St John the Baptist, Hillingdon.\n\n1855\n\n15th December: MARY WRIGHT (b.1777) “wife of Robert Wright, a chaff cutter” dies at home in Colham Green, Hillingdon. The cause of death is certified as ‘Old Age’. According to the death certificate, she is 78, which puts her year of birth at 1777, the same as her husband.\n\n21st December: Ann Broadway makes her mark and registers MARY WRIGHT’s death with the Registrar, Francis Stockwell.\n\n23rd December: MARY WRIGHT is buried in Hillingdon. The vicar, William Hodgson, officiates.\n\n1854\n\n8th October: FREDERICK WRIGHT, another son for THOMAS and ESTHER, is christened in the church of St John the Baptist, Hillingdon.\n\n1857\n\n11th January: THOMAS and ESTHER’s fifth son WALTER WRIGHT, is christened in the church of St John the Baptist, Hillingdon.\n\n1859\n\n20th February: HANNAH WRIGHT is christened in the church of St John the Baptist, Hillingdon.

The registrar is a Mr Francis Stockwell.)\n\n24th March: The christening of ARTHUR WRIGHT in the church of St John the Baptist, Hillingdon. The Rev. C.T. Weatherley, curate, performs the ceremony.\n\n1861 Census Records:\n\nThe Census was taken on the night of 7th April, 1861.\n\nIn Colham Green, Middlesex (Parish of Hillingdon), THOMAS and ESTHER are both 41. Thomas is described as a ‘Farmer – 5 acres – 2 boys’. The two boys are: THOMAS, now aged 17 (b.1844), and ROBERT, now aged 13 (b.1848). The family has grown.\n\nIn the household are the children: THOMAS (b.1844) aged 17, ROBERT (b.1848) aged 13, CHARLES (b.1850) aged 11, ESTHER (b.1852) aged 9, FREDERICK (b.1854) aged 7, WALTER (b.1857) aged 5, HANNAH (b.1859) aged 3, ARTHUR (b.1861), who is aged 2 months (see details above).\n\nROBERT WRIGHT, now 84, and ‘a retired farmer’, is living in the household of MARY BAYLIS – his daughter, born c.1809.

His occupation is given as a ‘chaff cutter’.\n\nPresent at his death is near neighbour Elizabeth Fisher, who signs the register when reporting his death on 4th December, 1863. Unable to write, she ‘makes her mark’ for the registrar, Francis Stockwell.\n\n6th December: ROBERT WRIGHT is buried in Hillingdon. The vicar, Richard Croft, officiates.\n\n1871\n\nCensus Records:\n\nThe Census was taken on the night of 2nd April, 1871.\n\nHillingdon. New Road, Hillingdon Heath. THOMAS and ESTHER are now 50. In their household are: THOMAS (b.1844) aged 27, CHARLES (b.1850) aged 21, WALTER (b.1857) aged 14, HANNAH (b.1859) aged 12, and ARTHUR (b.1861) aged 10. Young ESTHER is 19, and is employed as a nursemaid by The Rev. Arthur Hilton, vicar of Uxbridge Moor. She lives at the Vicarage, 12 St John’s Road, Hillingdon, Middlesex. CHARLES is a Carpenter.\n\nOXFORDSHIRE\n\nAt 25 Market Hill, Market End, Bicester, Oxfordshire: FREDERICK WRIGHT (b.1854) is now 17, from London, Middlesex, and to be found as an assistant to the head of the household: John Baker, 40, is a draper and clothier, born and bred in Bicester. (Frederick’s name has been copied as Fredk W. Right (sic.) and his age is recorded incorrectly as 15.)\n\nAt the same address are: Anna Baker (John’s wife) 43, originally from Weymouth in Dorset; Elizabeth Thomas (from Bicester) 25, niece to John Baker; Louisa Lett (assistant) 22, from Brackley, Northamptonshire; Eleanor George, (milliner) 23, from Farnham in Berkshire; S.E.Sinclair (assistant) 16, from Howden, Yorkshire; Charles Blackley (assistant) 23, from Grantham, Lincolnshire, and Ann Barratt, 21, a general servant from nearby Deddington, Oxfordshire.

Her notes – signed by W. Rayner, Sgn – describe her as being ‘In fair health. Body well nourished.

She spends the rest of her life in an institution.\n\n1877\n\n21st November: MARY BAYLIS (a daughter of ROBERT WRIGHT) is buried in Hillingdon. She is 66 years of age.\n\n1881 Census Records:\n\nThe Census was taken on the night of 3rd April, 1881.\n\nTHOMAS and ESTHER are both 60. THOMAS is working as a gardener, and living in lodgings in Uxbridge. WALTER WRIGHT (b.1857) is aged 24, and he and his brother FREDERICK WRIGHT (b.1855) are commercial travellers dealing in shirts. They have lodgings at 6 Smith Street, Clerkenwell, with their uncle Frederick Weatherley (sic.) and his wife Harriet.\n\nFrederick is ESTHER’s younger brother (b.1829). Frederick Weatherley is a Carpet Manufacturer, aged 52, from Hillingdon. His wife is 50, and hails from Mildenhall in Suffolk.

Her two children Catherine Elizabeth, 22, also a dressmaker, and Henry Samuel, 20, a clerk, are living with her.\n\n(Given how comparatively close this address is to where the Hebbs were living, it is easy to see how Arthur and Edith could have met.)\n\nESTHER WRIGHT is listed as a ‘Lunatic’ at Middlesex County Asylum.\n\n1885\n\n15th September: FREDERICK WRIGHT and his wife EMILY LOUISA celebrate the birth of a boy. MARTIN EDWARD WRIGHT is born at 6, Ivy Terrace, Etherly Road, Tottenham.

Robinson, officiates, and the wedding is witnessed by the bride’s father, Marmaduke Stephenson Hebb, her sister Ellen Mary Hebb, Walter Wright, the groom’s brother, and Harriet R.D. May. In the register, the address of the happy couple is given as 43, High Street, Shadwell. Arthur is a ‘Wholesale Clothier’.\n\nThere are two corrected errors: The groom’s father, Thomas, is a ‘Gentleman’ (an incorrect description ‘Chief Engineer’ has been crossed out) and Marmaduke Stephenson Hebb has also been elevated to the rank of a ‘Gentleman’ – the word ‘Carpenter’ having been neatly struck through.\n\n(Harriet R.D. May is – like the bride and groom – in the rag trade. A mantle maker, she is probably a friend of Edith’s. Born in Mile End in 1864, Harriet Rebecca Dodson May remains a spinster throughout her life, dying in 1944.)\n\n1887\n\nMIDDLESEX\n\nSTOKE NEWINGTON\n\n8th June: ARTHUR STEPHENSON WRIGHT is born at 144 Winston Road.\n\n1888\n\n8th January: ARTHUR STEPHENSON WRIGHT is baptised in the Church of All Saints, Stoke Newington, Middlesex.

THOMAS WRIGHT (b.1820) is with them, ‘living on his own means’. He does not live to see the new century.\n\nARTHUR STEPHENSON WRIGHT (b.1887) is 3 years old. There is no servant. (WALTER WRIGHT is a ‘linen draper’s agent’. He is 34, single, and living in lodgings at 41 Stroud Green Road, London N4 (Finsbury Park).\n\nESTHER WRIGHT is among the inmates at Surrey County Asylum (later known as Springfield Hospital).

Her father registers the birth on the 24th February with the Registrar, James G. Randall.\n\n24th April: EDITH MAVIS WRIGHT is baptised by the Reverend J.H. Greaves in the Parish Church of St. Paul, Haringey.\n\n1897\n\nFREDERICK WRIGHT & Co., Shirt Manufacturers. 11, Aldermanbury Avenue, London EC2\n\nThe family firm, which made shirts for the wholesale trade, is mentioned for the first time in Kelly’s Directory for London. The ancient area around Aldermanbury – near St Paul’s Cathedral and London Wall – was a centre for clothing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nThe Avenue itself came into being in the mid-1880s, and ran from 47 Aldermanbury, to Philip Lane. It was full of small factories and workshops, making mainly soft goods: clothing, accessories, umbrellas, and the like.\n\nSir John James Baddeley, Lord Mayor of London from 1921-22 described the area, thus: ALDERMANBURY AVENUE Running from Aldermanbury (forty-four yards from London Wall) to Philip Lane, this avenue was made in 1880, through property belonging to Sion College. It contains fourteen houses, seven on each side of the avenue, which is seventy yards in length and twenty-five feet in width. It first appears in the rate books in 1881, when the total assessment was £1,857. In 1890 the assessment had risen to nearly £4,000; six houses each being assessed just under £200, and the remainder between £200 and £300; in the directory of this year we find thirty-two firms carrying on business, all except three or four being engaged in the soft-goods trade. Two foreign names appear. In 1914 the number of the firms and the character of their businesses were much the same as in 1890, the rateable value being £4,500. (From ‘Cripplegate Ward’ by Sir John James Baddeley, Hodder & Stoughton, 1922.)\n\nOn the South Side were to be found:\n\n1a Farmer & Co.

He is born at home, at 22 Lothair Road, Hornsey. His father (a ‘manufacturing clothier’) registers the birth on the 23rd July, with James (Jas) G. Randall, the Registrar. 22nd August: THOMAS FREDERICK WRIGHT is baptised by the Rev. B.S. Lloyd in the Parish Church of St. Paul, Haringey. In the register, the child’s father is now, as above, a ‘Manufacturing Clothier’.\n\n1900\n\n4th May: ESTHER WRIGHT (b.1820) dies in Middlesex County Asylum, Wandsworth. The cause of death is ‘Senile decay, Bronchitis’ certified by H.G. Hill MRCS. She is 79 years of age, and her occupation: ‘Widow of Thomas Wright a Gardener of New Road, Hillingdon Heath, Hillingdon’.\n\nHer death is registered on the 17th May by Reginald Worth (Acting Superintendent of Middlesex County Asylum, Wandsworth). The registrar is F. Howick, Deputy Registrar. The records for 1900-1905 were destroyed in a fire.\n\n1901\n\nCensus Records: The Census was taken on the night of 31st March, 1901.\n\nARTHUR and EDITH WRIGHT are now living at 159 Nelson Road, Hornsey (Stoke Newington). ARTHUR is now 40, a ‘Wholesale Clothier’ – and an employer, part of his brother’s business FREDERICK WRIGHT & Co., Shirt Manufacturers. EDITH is 38, and ARTHUR STEPHENSON WRIGHT (b.1887) is 13.\n\nHis sister, EDITH MAVIS (b.1892) is aged 9, and his brother, THOMAS FREDERICK, (b.1897) is now aged 3. A 14-year-old servant, Daisy Agnes Hill, looks after them. EDITH MAVIS WRIGHT is mentioned in the will of her uncle, Marmaduke Arthur Hebb, Edith Hebb’s brother, who died in 1936. He leaves her the sum of £10.00. (She remains a spinster throughout her long life, dying at the age of 93 on the 3rd February, 1985, in Southend-on-Sea, Essex.)\n\nARTHUR STEPHENSON WRIGHT (b.1887) worked for the family firm, as did Frederick Wright’s son, Martin Edward Wright, a warehouse manager. (At some stage before 1911, the Wrights move to 46, Crouch Hall Road, Crouch End.)\n\nWALTER WRIGHT is 46 and ‘a cotton goods agent’. He is still unmarried and still living in lodgings, this time at 209 Isledon Road, Highbury, Islington, London. He is probably working for his brother Frederick.\n\n1911\n\nCensus Records: The Census was taken on the night of Sunday, April 2nd, 1911.\n\n46, Crouch Hall Road, Hornsey, N.\n\nARTHUR WRIGHT is 50. He is ‘a clothing manufacturer’ (see above). His wife, EDITH is 46. Their eldest son, ARTHUR STEPHENSON WRIGHT is 23, ‘a clothing agent’, his sister, EDITH MAVIS, ‘a spinster’, is 19, and his brother THOMAS FREDERICK, is a schoolboy, aged 13. The family has a ‘Domestic and general servant’, FLORENCE DOROTHY BETTERIDGE, aged 15.\n\n14th October: ARTHUR STEPHENSON WRIGHT marries ISABEL ADA GISBORNE (of 56 Berkeley Road, Crouch End) in Christ Church, Hornsey.\n\nThe wedding is witnessed by Isabel’s parents, Henry Beaumont Gisborne (a solicitor’s managing clerk) and Jessie (Janet) Weir Gisborne; Edith Wright (the groom’s mother, nee Hebb), and Arthur B. Hogben, probably best man and a friend of the groom.\n\nThe Vicar, the Rev.C.J. Sharp, officiates. He is a renowned collector of English porcelain teapots.\n\nArthur Bertram Hogben (1887-1915) I believe lived at 256 Ferme Park Road, Crouch End. In the First World War he served as a Lance Corporal in the 14th London Regiment, and died in France on 14th October, 1915.\n\nThe new Mr & Mrs Arthur Stephenson Wright live at 56 Stapleton Hall Road, Muswell Hill.\n\n1st December: The London Gazette announces that EDITH MAVIS WRIGHT is employed as a typist by the General Register Office (England).\n\n1914\n\n28th July: THE FIRST WORLD WAR BEGINS – exactly a month after Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria’s assassination in Sarajevo.\n\n4th August: Great Britain declares war on Germany.\n\n14th December: MARJORIE ISABEL JOAN WRIGHT (known always as Joan Wright) is born. She is the only child of ARTHUR STEPHENSON WRIGHT and ISABEL ADA WRIGHT (nee GISBORNE.)\n\n1916\n\nTHOMAS FREDERICK WRIGHT enlists in the army. He serves as a private soldier with A Company, 2nd/5th Battalion, London Regiment (London Rifle Brigade). His Regimental Number is 301491.\n\n1917\n\nARTHUR and EDITH WRIGHT are now living at 140, Stroud Green Road, Finsbury Park, London.\n\nIn January, THOMAS FREDERICK WRIGHT is sent to France.\n\n17th May: At the age of nineteen, THOMAS FREDERICK WRIGHT is awarded the Military Medal ‘for saving life at Bullecourt.’\n\n13th July: THOMAS FREDERICK WRIGHT, younger brother of ARTHUR STEPHENSON and EDITH MAVIS, is killed in action in France. He is 20 years old. The number of his grave is III.A.10 in the Fifteen Ravine British Cemetery, Villers-Plouich, France.\n\nThe inscription on his grave reads: 301491 RIFLEMAN T.F.WRIGHT MM LONDON RIFLE BRIGADE 13TH JULY 1917 AGE 20. At the base of the stone are the words: HIS COMRADES SAID HE WAS A GALLANT GENTLEMAN.\n\n“Fifteen Ravine” was the name given by the Army to the shallow ravine, once bordered by fifteen trees, which ran at right angles to the railway about 800 metres south of the village of Villers-Plouich, but the cemetery is in fact in “Farm Ravine,” on the east side of the railway line, nearer to the village. The cemetery, sometimes called Farm Ravine Cemetery, was begun by the 17th Welsh Regiment in April 1917, a few days after the capture of the ravine by the 12th South Wales Borderers. It continued in use during the Battle of Cambrai (November 1917) and until March 1918, when the ravine formed the boundary between the Third and Fifth Armies.\n\n(Description: The Commonwealth War Graves Commission.)

He is an ironworker.\n\nI do not know what made the Wrights leave London, but ARTHUR is no longer part of Frederick Wright & Co. Aged 34, he has a new job:\n\n‘Silk Headwear Warehouseman’ employed by clothiers Sambrook Witting Ltd., at 16 Jewin Crescent EC. Sambrook Witting still exists (2021). I believe he commuted daily into London to work.\n\n1922\n\nFrederick Wright & Co., Shirt Manufacturers, has now expanded to premises at 80, Woodstock Street, Canning Town, E.16.\n\nThe company is listed with both addresses in the Post Office Street Directory.\n\n26th November: MARTIN EDWARD WRIGHT dies at 8 Alexandra Road, Hackney.

The cause of death is ‘malnutrition’ and ‘carcinoma of the stomach’. This is certified by K.Brown MRCS.\n\nJoan Wright registers the death the following day. By this time, the family home is 128, Clive Road, West Dulwich, London SE21.\n\n1939\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, JOAN WRIGHT and her mother ISABEL ADA GISBORNE are sharing the house with a married couple:\n\nREGINALD JOHN HURSON is a ‘shipping manager, tea and cocoa’.

In the 1911 census, she can be found living a few doors away in Clive Road.\n\nJOAN WRIGHT is described in the 1939 Register as a ‘newspaper editorial secretary’ (working for ‘The Bicycle’.) Her mother is ‘widowed’ – employed doing ‘unpaid domestic duties’.\n\n1940\n\nLONDON\n\n29th December: The Blitz. Aldermanbury Avenue and the surrounding streets are virtually destroyed, as this account by a wartime firewatcher makes clear:\n\n“The block bounded by Brassishaw Hall, Fore Street, Aldermanbury, and Basinghall Street appeared to be one solid mass of flame. St Stephen’s, Coleman Street, was soon enveloped in flames, and we could see the steeple and weathercock fall. Fires were everywhere in the City area. From time to time, heavy high explosive bombs or land mines were dropped … There would be the sound of something rushing through the air – then a brilliant flash would light up the entire sky and horizon followed within two or three seconds by the most resounding explosion …”\n\n(R.C.M.Fitzhugh, quoted in ‘The City Ablaze’ by David Johnson.) A way of life and living has changed for ever.\n\n1942\n\nOnly the Canning Town address now remains in the directory, and Frederick Wright & Co.

There are a very few small snapshots found in a dark blue suitcase: Arthur Stephenson Wright smiling out with his briar pipe and plus fours, and Isabel Ada his wife looking coyly, almost coquettishly, at the camera, her arm linked with her husband’s. They look happy enough. They were not.\n\nAlthough he remained devoted to her, she was convinced that she had ‘married beneath her’ – and never let her husband forget it.\n\n* * *\n\nJoan Wright married my father Dr. Bedrich Belohlavek (1902–1991) in 1973.

Wright’s account book has her listed as the first of ‘Sitters at Derby’. He charged three guineas (£3/3s/0d) for his work. The portrait ended up with the Fooks family of Woodbridge in Suffolk, where it remained until it was sold at Phillips in 1985.The picture is handsomely illustrated and accounted for in the Tate Gallery’s exhibition catalogue ‘Wright of Derby’ (1990) by Judy Egerton.\n\n1758\n\n4th February: JOHN GISBORNE (b.1716) marries ANN BATEMAN (b.1732), in the Church of St Werburgh, Derby.

After the death of Sir John Chandos, the celebrated warrior, without male issue, in 1370, the Radborne estate passed to his representatives in the female line, and eventually to Sir Peter de la Pole, who married his niece, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Lawton. Sir Peter, who was one of the knights of the shire in 1400, is described as having been of Newborough in Staffordshire; but it appears that his ancestors had been, at an early period, of Hartington in this county. Ralph Pole, son of Peter before-mentioned, was one of the Justices of the King’s-Bench, in the reign of Henry VI. Radborne is now the property, and Radborne-hall the seat of his immediate descendant,Edward Sacheverell Chandos Pole, Esq. (See below, 1817.) The parish of Radborne contains 2,125 acres of land, of which more than 2000 belong to Mr. Pole, who is patron also of the rectory.\n\nIn the parish church are some monuments of the family of Pole, two ancient monuments already more particularly described ; a large marble monument, with a sarcophagus, for Sir German Pole, who was knighted for his good services in Ireland, under Lord Mountjoy in 1599, he died in 1634; German Pole, Esq., his son, who died in 1683, married Ann, daughter of Sir Richard Newdigate, but having no issue, bequeathed his estate to Samuel Pole, Esq., of Lees, descended from German, a younger son of Francis Pole, Esq., which German settled at Lees in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. There is a monument also for Mary, widow of George Parker, Esq., of Ratton in Sussex, and daughter of Sir Richard Newdigate, ob. 1708.\n\nGerman Pole, Esq., who died in 1683, founded a charity school at Radborne: the present value of its endowment is 15l. 10s. per annum, besides a moiety of the profits of a lime-kiln.”\n\n(From ‘Magna Britannia, Volume 5: Derbyshire’, by Daniel and Samuel Lysons, published 1817.)\n\n1779\n\n13th February: JOHN GISBORNE (b.1716, son of THOMAS and TEMPERANCE, father of JOHN (b.1770) and the Reverend Thomas, dies at Yoxall Lodge, aged 63.

A couple of romantic family legends suggest that his family may have fled the French Revolution, but it is more likely that he is part of the old Beaumont family of Barrow Hall, Barrow-Upon-Trent, Derbyshire. He signs the marriage register as William Beaumont, Gent. John Sacheverell’s father, Hartley Packer Gisborne, is described as a ‘Merchant’ – as is the groom.\n\nESTELLE is listed as a ‘minor’, although she is 19. The witnesses are her father, and a friend, Sophy Elizabeth Maunders. The Rector, Talbot Greaves, officiates.

Barton-Upon-Irwell is the site of James Brindley’s stone aqueduct that carried the Bridgewater Canal across the River Irwell. Between 1890 and 1894, the aqueduct will be replaced by Barton Swing Aqueduct, a feat of engineering which John Sacheverell Gisborne would have relished.\n\nESTELLE GISBORNE is in lodgings at Glin Villa, Clewer, Near Windsor, Berkshire.

Edmund Robinson of Thorp Green Hall, Little Ouseburn (near York). They were tutors to the five Robinson children. A scandal was only narrowly averted after Branwell (tutor to the Robinsons’ son, Edmund) became enfatuated with Mrs Robinson (nee Lydia Gisborne, daughter of the Rev. Thomas Gisborne.)\n\nShe was 43, he 25. Their affair lasted two and a half years. A huge scandal was averted in the nick of time when plans for elopement were scuppered, and Branwell was dismissed from the Robinson household. The story is well recounted in Juliet Barker’s magisterial work ‘The Brontes,’ but Gisborne relatives are not usually so aware of how clearly portrayed they are in the pages of Anne’s novel ‘Agnes Grey’. The Robinsons are the Murrays of Horton Lodge.

Many of the higher points command magnificent prospects – eastward of the German ocean, Flambrough Head and Lighthouse and the Priory Church of Bridlington; north-westward of the vale of York and York Minster; southward, of the flat expanse of Holderness, the majestic Humber, Beverley Minster and the churches of Hull and Hedon. The climate of the Wolds is severe; the winds, as they sweep over the plain and unbroken surface, being extremely violent and penetrating … Still the Wolds are healthy and the most grass is produced in the driest summers; but when the crops are exposed to the sea fogs they are usually small and the grass thick-skinned and coarse. The houses of this county (East Riding) are generally good, except upon the Wolds, where the materials are indifferent. The old buildings are composed of chalk stone, with mud instead of lime mortar, and covered with thatch … Many farms are found of £20 and £50 per annum, and a farm of £200 per annum is of a respectable size … The old-fashioned foot plough has continued too much in use, being a clumsy, heavy, ill-formed implement …” (From ‘CELEBRITIES OF THE YORKSHIRE WOLDS, by Frederick Ross, London Trubner & Co, 57 & 59 Ludgate Hill; Driffield: T.

His will is witnessed by two directors of Brook’s Wharf, Upper Thames Street, on the north side of the Thames, so it’s a safe assumption that this is where he worked. His son, also MARMADUKE ARTHUR HEBB, was born in Lambeth in 1899, and lived until 1980. In 1923, he married Rosie Woodfield in Wandsworth.\n\n* * *\n\nTHE BEAUMONTS\n\nGUILLAUME BEAUMONT (c.1785 – 1861) was born in France, a British subject, though where and precisely when remains a mystery for the present. According to a story handed down from his daughter Clara, he was the surviving son of the de Beaumont family: aristocrats sent to the guillotine during the French Revolution. Rescued from prison at the age of five by loyal servants, he was hauled through the bars of his cell window – injuring a finger which remained crooked all his life. He was then placed with a family on the Isle of Wight where his true identity remained a secret until more stable times.\n\n(This story comes courtesy of Charlene Davies, a descendant of Clara Beaumont. Ms Davies maintains that the family was also known as ‘de Beaumont’, although ESTELLE does not appear to have used the prefix.)\n\nIt is more likely that Guillaume Beaumont was a member of the Beaumont family of Barrow Hall, Barrow-Upon-Trent in Staffordshire. Their connections and lineage – including the Babingtons – would have suited the Gisbornes admirably.\n\nGLOUCESTERSHIRE\n\nBRISTOL\n\n1822\n\n22nd August: GUILLAUME BEAUMONT marries SARAH TURNBULL in the Temple Church. The original parish registers were destroyed by enemy action in World War Two, and only the bishops’ transcripts survive, so details are unfortunately minimal.\n\n1829\n\nBRISTOL\n\n25th October: WILLIAM BEAUMONT, eldest son of GUILLAUME and SARAH BEAUMONT, is baptised. PIGOT’S DIRECTORY OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE, 1830, finds William (Guillaume) Beaumont as a schoolmaster at the Free School, Pile Street, Bristol. (The school was founded at the beginning of the 18th century, for the clothing and educating of 40 boys.) Later in the century it took in girls as well, and became known as the Pile Street Mixed School.\n\n1836\n\n25th November: ESTELLE BEAUMONT is born in Queen’s Square, Bristol, Gloucestershire. She will marry JOHN SACHEVERELL GISBORNE.\n\n1837\n\n7th July: ESTELLE BEAUMONT is baptised in the church of St Stephen, Bristol, Gloucestershire. Her parents are ‘William Beaumont, a Schoolmaster, and Sarah’. The baby is baptised by the Rev. Charles Buck.\n\n1841\n\nCensus Records:\n\nLIVERPOOL The BEAUMONT family is living in Upper Beau Street, Everton. GUILLAUME BEAUMONT is 45, a linguist; his wife SARAH is 40; their eldest son HENRY is 15, ‘a librarian’. He will go into the church. Eldest daughter SARAH is 13, WILLIAM 11, CLARA 9, FLORENCE 8, ALFRED 6, and ESTELLE, 4. Not much of Upper Beau Street remains. (GUILLAUME BEAUMONT’s death certificate of 1861 records his age as 73. This places his date of birth at c.1788, rather earlier than the 1795 implied by the 1841 census.)\n\n1848\n\nHEATON MOUNT SCHOOL\n\n“… The Boarding Schools for young gentlemen in the town and neighbourhood are those of Mr Tryer (the late Mr Walker’s), Row-lane Academy; Mr Beaumont, Heaton Mount, Mr Gurney, West Hill; and Mr Bamford, Highton-street.” From ‘A Descriptive History of the Popular Watering-place of Southport, in the Parish of North Meols, on the Western Coast of Lancashire’ by Frank Robinson, published by Arthur Hall & Co., Paternoster-Row. 1848. Heaton Mount School stood in Manchester Road, North Meols. An advertisement appeared in the Leeds Mercury of 27th March, 1852:\n\n“HEALTH AND EDUCATION. The Principal of Heaton Mount Select School, Southport, Lancashire begs to direct the attention of parents to the singular purity and salubrity of the sea air of Southport, which is almost invariably the means of restoring health and strength to the delicate and weakly.

His two brothers are baptised in the chapel in the same year.\n\n(About the Aldermanbury Postern Chapel: The Reverend Edward West had been the rector of Little Whittenham in Berkshire, but by 1662 had been expelled from his living by the Church of England. In London, he formed his own church which met at his home near Moorfields, and was eventually licensed under the King’s Declaration of Indulgence in 1672, which allowed dissenters to construct their own places of worship. West and his followers built a small wooden meeting house in Ropemaker’s Alley, which was in use until 1765, when they moved to a new chapel at the Aldemanbury Postern, where the congregation remained until 1850.)\n\nSee note on Frederick Wright & Co., Shirt Manufacturers, 11 Aldermanbury Avenue.
