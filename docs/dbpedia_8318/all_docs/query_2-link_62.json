Marlowe tells TVLine that the actress will guest-star in this season’s 11th episode — the first outing after winter hiatus — as “a Lindsay Lohan/Miley Cyrus type who has had a big public meltdown. She’s somebody who has turned from America’s sweetheart into the kind of person who might twerk on MTV.\n\n“It’s a good, fun character,” Marlowe adds — and one who will trigger a bit of an epiphany for one of the show’s main players.\n\nRELATED | Castle‘s Nathan Fillion Proposes a Beach Wedding for Rick and Kate\n\nIn addition to her run as Lying Game twins Emma and Sutton, Chando’s TV credits include As the World Turns and The WB’s Rockville CA.\n\nWant more scoop on Castle, or for any other show?
