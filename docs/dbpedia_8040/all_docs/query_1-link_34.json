        "text": "Considered the greatest and best known French writer of all times, Victor-Marie Hugo was born in Besancon, eastern France, on February 26, 1802.\n\nFrom an early age, he showed a commitment to raising social justice issues and giving voice to the oppressed, as well as standing against capital punishment.\n\nHugo was born three years after Napoleon Bonaparte had seized power, and two years before he declared France an empire.\n\nHe studied law, though he never committed to legal practice. Encouraged by his family, he embarked on a career in literature.\n\nComing of age after Napoleon’s defeat, Hugo began his life as a poet and a writer and soon became a key figure in the development of French Romanticism.\n\nOne of his very famous works is the novel Les Miserables, which he began in 1845 but did not complete until 1862. It’s considered one of the greatest novels of the 19th century. For many, he captured the humanity of those who were condemned to marginality.\n\nOn June 30, a Google Doodle was created in his honour and featured across North and South America, Europe, parts of Asia and Australia.\n\nLes Miserables\n\nThrough Les Miserables, Hugo examined the history of France, delving into issues such as poverty, politics, moral philosophy, justice and religion.\n\nOn June 5, 1832, the death of General Lamarque sparked a rebellion against the monarchy which was quickly and brutally repressed.\n\nThis would provide the inspiration for the student revolt at the centre of Les Miserables. “We shall have a republic one day,” he argued, “and when it comes of its own free will, it will be good. But, let us not harvest in May fruit which will not be ripe until July; let us learn to wait … We cannot suffer boors to bespatter our flag with red.”\n\nPolitically influential\n\nAs a public figure, he was politically influential.\n\nHugo was elevated to the peerage by King Louis and entered the Higher Chamber as a pair de France, a designation of high distinction applied to a small number of the French nobility.\n\nHe spoke against the death penalty and social injustice. Hugo raised to political fame after the February revolution and was ultimately elected as a representative of Paris.\n\nWhen Napoleon III took complete power in 1851, Hugo openly declared him a traitor to France.\n\nHe moved to Brussels, then Jersey, from where he was expelled for supporting a newspaper that criticised Queen Victoria. He settled in Saint Peter Port, Guernsey, where he would live in exile from October 1855 until 1870.\n\nLasting impact\n\nWhile in exile, he published his political pamphlets against Napoleon III.\n\nThey were banned in France but they had a strong impact there.\n\nHis work also left a lasting impression on writers such as Charles Dickens, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Albert Camus.\n\nHe died in Paris in 1885, and he became the first person to be buried in the Pantheon, a former church designed by 18th-century architect Jacques-Germain Soufflot and often compared in style to St. Paul’s Cathedral in London or the US Capitol building in Washington.\n\nMore than two million people attended his funeral, one of the largest mass mobilisations ever seen in Paris, and more than the city’s total population at the time."
