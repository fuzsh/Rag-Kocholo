        "text": "First edition, first issue with no subsequent edition statement on the title page. Two volumes, exquisitely bound by Cuzin in mid-nineteenth century full green morocco with raised bands to the spine and geometric border design to covers and spine compartments. Titled in gilt, with gilt dentelles and edges and marbled endpapers. 212mm x 130mm (page size). Engraved title pages to both volumes, complete with half titles. A fine, tall set, barely trimmed with many leaves uncut, all beautifully clean with no chips or tears. Two inconspicuous book-labels to the front blank. The binding has been retained in sparklingly fine condition. A superb example of this rarity of Gothic literature in a fine Parisian binding. The author's first full length novel, that is now one of the key works of nineteenth century literature, and upon which much of the author's reputation rests. The first edition was published in an edition of 1100 copies which was subdivided into four issues with a different edition statement on the title page. Thus there are only 275 copies of the first issue. The book has subsequently been published in English under the title, \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\". Francisque Cuzin (1836-1890) was regarded as the finest bookbinder in the world at the time. \"If you want a volume bound in the highest style of art the man to go to is M. Cuzin of the Rue Séguier. who took early to bookbinding, and is now at the head of the handicraft in Paris, and perhaps the world.\" - The Pall Mall Gazette (December 1886). \"This first edition, in fine condition, is the rarest of all the works of Victor Hugo; it has had a resounding impact worldwide, and is one of the most difficult titles of the Romantic period to obtain\" (Translated from Carteret - Le Trésor du Bibliophile Romantique et Moderne) Carteret I 402.\n\nCondition: Near Fine. First Edition. First edition, first printing, first issue. [8], 404; [4], 536 pp. Bound in modern gilt armorial stamped morocco green leather bindings with marbled endpapers; wood-engraved title vignettes by Tony Johannot. Near Fine with light toning and minor patches of foxing throughout else fine. Victor Hugo's Gothic French masterpiece printed by Gosselin in a run of 1,100 copies on March 16, 1831; this first printing was distributed into four separate issues of 275 copies each, the subsequent three issues being designated as \"second edition,\" \"third edition,\" and \"fourth edition\" respectively on the title-pages. \"This first edition is the rarest of all the works of Victor Hugo; it has had a resounding impact worldwide, and is one of the most difficult titles of the Romantic period to obtain\" (Carteret).\n\nFirst edition, first printing of Hugo's masterpiece, one of only 1,100 examples. Octavo, 2 volumes, bound in half calf. The publisher Charles Gosselin published the novel on 16 March 1831 in an edition of 1,100 copies as was his usual practice. It was such a sensation that an additional three printings had to be published the same year. The first impression of 1100 copies was separated into four groups, each bearing a fictitious edition statement on the title-page, a scheme designed to make the public believe that the novel was selling rapidly. \"This first edition is the rarest of all the works of Victor Hugo; it has had a resounding impact worldwide, and is one of the most difficult titles of the Romantic period to obtain\" (Carteret). In near fine condition. Housed in a custom half morocco clamshell box. Rare and desirable. âThe Hunchback of Notre Dame was a revelation of what an historical novel could beâ (Reid, 296). First published in 1831 as Notre-Dame de Paris, Hugoâs book is âa stunning novelistic representation of late-medieval Paris and its central pointâ¦ [While it] firmly rejects the idealization of the Middle Ages frequent among Romantic apologists for the ancien rÃ gimeâ¦ Hugoâs novel was a hugely influential revelation of the descriptive intensity of Romantic proseâ (Hollier, 662). The book has seen numerous screen adaptations, including director William Dieterleâs 1939 version starring Charles Laughton and Maureen OâHara (the most expensive RKO production to that date) and the 1996 animated feature from Disney Studios.\n\nFirst edition, third issue. Johannot, Tony. First edition, third issue. Title vignettes by Tony Johannot. [viii], 404; [iv], 536 pp. 2 vols. 8vo. First edition, third issue, of Hugo's first great success as a novelist, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, in a fine retrospective binding by René Aussourd. Though styled the \"Troisème Édition\" on the title-page, this is in fact the third issue of the first edition. The entire edition consisted of four separate issues of 275 copies each, with each issue designated as a separate edition on the title-page. Notre-Dame de Paris is more commonly known in English as The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, the title under which the first English translation by Frederic Shoberl appeared in 1833. Set in 15th-century Paris, the novel introduces a memorable cast of Romantic characters; some, such as the hunchback Quasimodo and the gypsy girl Esmérald, have so permeated our culture that they've reached the status of archetypes. Hugo hoped that his novel would reverse the sad neglect of Gothic architecture in his country, much of which had fallen into ruin or been brutally altered. Indeed, Hugo created a depiction of Notre-Dame \"so erudite and familiar that it caused a revolution in architectural taste. The success of this darkly moving novel was immediate, establishing Hugo as the premier historical novelist of his time\" (Oxford Companion to Literature in French). In a fine retrospective French romantic binding by René Aussourd, recalling the work of Simier or Thouvenin. Aussourd studied under his uncle Charles Meunier and was first gilder at Chambolle-Duru before starting his own business in 1912 (Devauchelle III, p. 243). Carteret I, p. 402 Bound to style in the early 20th-century in red half morocco and embossed paper over boards, smooth spines stamped in gilt and blind to cathedral design, t.e.g., the rest uncut, by René Aussourd (signed in gilt at foot of spine and on front free endpaper). Slight rubbing to extremities, expert paper repair to lower outside corner of vol. I half-title, and repairs to a few other paper faults throughout. In a custom gilt-ruled full brown morocco slipcase and chemise by R. Patron Title vignettes by Tony Johannot. [viii], 404; [iv], 536 pp. 2 vols. 8vo.\n\nQuatrième édition. Paris: Charles Gosselin, Libraire, 1831. First edition, first printing, fourth issue (\"Quatrieme édition\"), of Hugo's gothic masterpiece. It is generally accepted that the publisher indiscriminately printed different editions on the title-page of all copies to make the book seem as if it was now in four editions, however the text is all identical. Two octavo volumes (8 1/2 x 5 3/8 inches; 214 x 135 mm.). [8], 404; [4], 536 pp. With half-titles in both volumes. Wood-engraved title vignettes after Tony Johannot. Contemporary quarter marbled sheep over marbled paper boards. Spines with three black morocco spine labels. Labels stamped and lettered in gilt. All edges uncut. Corners a bit bumped. Back board of volume II with minor abrasions. Previous owner's old ink signature on top margin of title-page in each volume. Some occasional spotting and thumb-soiling, but generally internally very clean. Overall, an excellent copy. \"This first edition, in fine condition, is the rarest of all the works of Victor Hugo; it has had a resounding impact worldwide, and is one of the most difficult titles of the Romantic period to obtain\" (Carteret). Gosselin brought out the novel on 16 March 1831 in an edition of 1,100 copies, as was his general practice. This first printing was distributed into four separate issues of 275 copies each, the subsequent three issues being designated as \"second edition,\" \"third edition,\" and \"fourth edition\" respectively on the title-pages. \"Johannot's title-page vignettes for the first edition of Notre-Dame de Paris show Quasimodo in the pillory receiving a drink from Esmeralda (Volume I) and Esmeralda escorted to the gallows (Volume II)\" (Ray).

The first illustrated edition, first issue, and the first edition complete in one volume.Inscribed note from Victor Hugo adhered before the half-title. 'A mon bien cher ami . Victor Hugo'.Very uncommon to find a copy of Notre-Dame dedicated or inscribed by Hugo.We believe this was dedicated at the time of publication.Illustrated with an engraved title, and ten plates.This is an early copy without the plate 'De l'utilité des fenêtres', as is common, as the plate was not yet ready when the work was published.In the original French.'Notre-Dame' is one of the most famous French novels written. It is a Gothic novel, set in Paris in 1482, surrounding the cathedral of Notre Dame. The story follows the gypsy Esmeralda, as she captures the heart of Quasimodo, the bellringer of Notre-Dame.Written by Victor Hugo, a Romantic novelist, best known for this work and for the epic 'Les Miserables'.Illustrated after Louis Boulanger, Alfred Johannot, Tony Johannot, Denis Auguste Marie Raffet, and Camille Rogier.Bookplate of Oliver Brett to the front paste down.

The first edition was published on 16 March 1831 in an edition of 1100 copies all from the same sheets, divided into four issues of 275 copies each and arbitrarily classified by the publisher '[first]', 'second', 'third', and 'fourth' editions on their respective title-pages in an attempt to convince the public of the novel's runaway success. Hugo had agreed to write Notre-Dame de Paris in 1828, but little progress had been made by the summer of 1830, by which time Gosselin had already granted the author two extensions. Faced with the termination of his contract or a fine of 1000 francs per week should he fail to complete the work by February 1831, Hugo worked on the novel ceaselessly, allegedly locking away all his clothes save for a large shawl in an attempt to resist the allure of the outside world. He finished the work on 15 January 1831, mere weeks before the deadline set by Gosselin.
