        "text": "Why the book was once on the ‘Index’\n\nIn 1834, three years after its publication, “Notre-Dame de Paris” was placed on the Catholic Church’s “Index of Prohibited Books”. It wasn’t removed from the index until 1959 — the index was later discontinued by Pope Paul VI in 1966. One source said the book was condemned with other books that were anti-clerical, blasphemous or heretical. Another source asserted that the book was placed on the index not for any theological reason — although the book undeniably has strong anti-clerical and anti-Catholic aspects we’ll look at later — but rather because the book was \"sensual, libidinous or lascivious.\"\n\nMost modern readers are blasé about the distinct raciness of the plot. Maybe that is because more people are familiar with the Disney animated version, which sanitizes many aspects of the story.\n\nIn Hugo’s novel, Esmeralda is a barely 16-year-old girl who is thought to be a gypsy because she was raised by gypsies. But she was actually born from an encounter between an unknown man and a poor French prostitute named Paquette from Reims, who had prayed to the Blessed Virgin for a child to love. It’s one of many examples in the novel in which superstitious self-seeking prayers are made by immoral characters — prayers that are left unanswered or answered in unexpectedly disappointing ways. Paquette had her baby girl baptized as Agnes.\n\nAt 1, Agnes is stolen by gypsies and replaced with a one-eyed, bow-legged, seemingly feral boy with a severely crooked back. He is about four years old, with a face neither his unknown mother nor Paquette could love. The changeling is exorcised by the local bishop and sent to Paris, to a foundling cradle in Notre Dame Cathedral, where unwanted children are dropped off in hopes someone will take them. A young priest at the cathedral, the fanatically studious Claude Frollo, fosters the child.\n\nEven though the Disney movie claims that Frollo gives Quasimodo a “mean name,” meaning half formed, Hugo left it to the reader to decide. He wrote that the priest found the child on Quasimodo Sunday and “called him Quasimodo; whether it was that he chose thereby to commemorate the day when he had found him, or that he meant to mark by that name how incomplete and imperfectly molded the poor little creature was.”\n\nQuasimodo Sunday is the Sunday following Easter. The name is taken from the first words of the traditional Latin entrance hymn of the day, “Quasi modo geniti infantes,” which reads in full, “Like newborn infants, desire the rational milk without guile, that thereby you may grow unto salvation: If so be you have tasted that the Lord is sweet.” Quasimodo does not mean half- or quasi-formed. It means something more like “as in the manner of.”\n\nWhen Quasimodo is 14, he becomes the bell ringer of the cathedral. When he loses his hearing from swinging among the bells, that loss reduces his connection with the world — which already ostracizes him — even further.\n\nAfter her child is stolen, Esmeralda’s mother, Paquette, eventually comes to live in a cramped and dank penitent’s cell that adjoins a Parisian square where criminals are executed. Not really “penitent,” she doesn’t bewail her own sins, but she endlessly bewails her loss and berates the gypsies, who she thinks ate her precious child in a satanic ritual. She curses at Esmeralda whenever the girl goes by because she believes the girl is one of the race of people who stole her child. It is not until almost the end of the novel when Esmeralda and her mother are briefly reunited and learn the truth about each other in a poignant scene. Soldiers who then come to drag Esmeralda away to execution for a trumped-up charge of witchcraft throw her mother aside from where she is clinging to her daughter, and Paquette dies from the impact of her head on stone stairs — which her daughter witnesses as a final horror just before she is put to death.\n\nThe distinct vein of raciness comes in because the plot of the novel is concentrated mostly on the passion of the main male characters for this barely 16-year-old girl. First among them is Claude Frollo, who is a priest, an archdeacon at Notre Dame and a crazed dabbler in black arts. There is also Pierre Gringoire, an addled philosophizing and penniless playwright whom Esmeralda “marries” for four years — having an ersatz wedding ceremony without consummation, only to save his life from hanging by the vagabonds of Paris. Phœbus de Châteaupers, a handsome, womanizing captain, is attracted to the girl in hopes of a casual fling. For Quasimodo, Esmeralda is precious, the unattainable love of his life.\n\nEsmeralda dances and sings among the crowds in Paris for money. “Her voice, like her dancing and her beauty, was indefinable, something pure, amorous, aerial, winged, as it were.” She does not dance provocatively, but she is casually aware of how men respond to her beauty, and she deftly deflects male advances with a dagger. She has been told that she will find her mother one day only if she keeps her virtue.\n\nBut then she falls so madly in love with the handsome cad Phoebus, she is about to give herself to him — even after he makes it clear to her that he has no intention of marrying her — when the obsessed Frollo leaps from where he has been spying on them and stabs the captain in a fit of jealousy. And there’s more. You’ve gotten the idea.\n\nAs I said, it’s all quite melodramatic besides being pretty racy stuff. With its plot elements of the gypsies as baby stealers and grown men obsessed with a teenage girl and its attribution of half-human status to the “hunchback” — not to mention its melodramatic plot line — it’s unlikely that the novel could be published these days.\n\nAnother characteristic that would make this novel unpublishable today is one that it shares with many other classic novels, such as “War and Peace” and “Moby Dick”. In these books, and many like them, you find huge chunks of authorial musings on subjects that have nothing to do with the plot.\n\nI remember during my last reading of “War and Peace” being struck by all the digressions into Tolstoy’s theory of human history and the “Russian soul” and his indictment of Napoleon for cowardice, among other things. And as one wag commented, reading “Moby Dick” prepares readers for the next time they need to cut up a whale. But somehow these books don’t sink with their heavy ballast of authorial opinionating; we skip over or forget the long digressions because the characters are so vividly realized and the stories are so riveting. The same applies to “Notre-Dame de Paris”.\n\nThe statue of the Virgin of Paris\n\nOur Lady is represented at least 37 times in the cathedral in the form of sculptures, paintings and stained glass. The statue called the Virgin of Paris is the most famous of them all.\n\nThis Virgin of Paris statue was carved in the middle of the 14th century for the Saint-Aignan Chapel in the former cloister of the Canons — priests who live together and pray the Divine Office — on the City Island. In 1818, the statue was transferred to Notre Dame to replace a 13th century statue of the virgin, which had stood in the pier of the portal of the virgin until it was destroyed in 1793, during the Reign of Terror.\n\nIn 1855, during the restoration of Viollet-le-Duc, the statue was moved again. Le-Duc had another statue carved and installed at the portal of the virgin, and the Virgin of Paris statue was moved to its current location — until the fire — to a spot where an altar to the virgin stood since the end of the 12th century. The statue stood in the sanctuary, on the southeast pillar of the transept. At that spot, a plaque attested — and may still attest — that the famous French author Paul Claudel was converted at Christmas Day Vespers in 1886.\n\nAfter the 2019 fire, the statue was removed from Notre Dame for safekeeping. A few days later, Cardinal Robert Sarah was photographed visiting the statue where it was being kept."
