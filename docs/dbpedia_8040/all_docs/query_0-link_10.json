Octavo, 30 volumes bound in three quarters morocco with gilt titles and tooling to the spine in three compartments within raised gilt bands, marbled endpapers, top edge gilt with others untrimmed, illustrated with tissue-guarded engravings including frontispieces to each volume, many in two states. One of 500 numbered sets, this is number 56. In fine condition. An exceptional set.\n\nVictor Marie Hugo was a French poet, novelist, and dramatist of the Romantic movement. He is considered one of the greatest and best known French writers. In France, Hugo's literary fame comes first from his poetry but also rests upon his novels and his dramatic achievements. Among many volumes of poetry, Les Contemplations and La Légende des siècles stand particularly high in critical esteem. Outside France, his best-known works are the acclaimed novels Les Misérables, 1862, and Notre-Dame de Paris, 1831."
