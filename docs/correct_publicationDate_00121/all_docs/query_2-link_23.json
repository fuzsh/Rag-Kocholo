        "text": "“All things make sense; you just have to fathom how they make sense.” — Piers Anthony\n\nA Superpower of Books Changes My World\n\nStories can turn around the attitude of even the staunchest of haters. I hated Florida.\n\nFlorida made my mind turn against itself. Aggravation from being there too long made me trip and fall on simple walks. Injuries piled up.\n\nSomething in the Floridian air gave my skin strange, never-ending issues. Its lack of winter stole Christmas. Madmen drivers fill the streets, and you can only navigate by U-turns. Etcetera, etcetera.\n\n“You should try Piers Anthony,” a friend told me. Why? Because in my troubles, I had turned back to fantasy reading.\n\nPiers Anthony is a prolific fantasy author. Yet I had never tried him! After browsing his titles, I picked up “A Spell for Chameleon.” It’s the first book in Anthony’s widely-beloved, 35-book-long Xanth series. (Fans sometimes affectionately call him “Pier Xanthony”)."
