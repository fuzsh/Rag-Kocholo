        "text": "Tough question, basically because in recent years, I've relegated the status of \"favorite author\" to living ones. I'll try anyway.\n\nFirst, to keep with your form, I cut my teeth on Oz books, Burgess Bedtime stories and The Wind in the Willows. Later, I would read 1001 Arabian Knights and the entirety of Dante's Divine Comedy (I read a bunch of Goosebumps as well, I wasn't a complete dork). I was introduced to Tolkien through the Rankin/Bass movies and had my first encounter with the books when my mom read the Silmarillion to me. I got my first copy of the Lord of the Rings in fifth grade and read it at about the same time as the Divine Comedy. I finally read the Hobbit in seventh grade.\n\nAround that time I got Robot Dreams by Isaac Asimov and got into that genre of science fiction. I read Dune, the Mithgar books, the Wheel of Time and the first Goodkind book.\n\nAround 11th grade I was introduced to Stephen R Donaldson with the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever. It ruined the fantasy genre for me (I liked it a lot) so from there, reading was classic science fiction, Stephen Crane and John Steinbeck.\n\nEventually I read Mervyn Peake and felt Titus Groan was the zenth of fantasy writing (in a way, I still do). This restored my faith in the fantasy genre and I started reading it again, realizing that what I liked to read was stylistic writing.\n\nI would read Mistborn when it was announced that Brandon would finish the Wheel of Time. I still intended to finish that series then (I never did). I enjoyed it as fun popcorn reading and that's why I read Cosmere books to this day. The result, though, is that if I rank favorite authors, he isn't ever on the list because, well, I adore stylistic prose and that's just not what he writes.\n\nSo, time for rankings:\n\n10) Ernest Hemingway\n\n9) John Steinbeck\n\n8) William Golding\n\n7) Stephen R Donaldson\n\n6) Salman Rushdie\n\n5) Zadie Smith\n\n4)Anthony Powell\n\n3)Mervyn Peake\n\n2)Catherynne M Valente\n\n1)John Crowley\n\nHonorable mentions to Steven Erickson, R Scott Bakker, Ford Maddox Ford for personal reading development reasons. There's also plenty of great authors not on this list like Jemisin, Chakraborty and Darcie Little Badger.\n\nBrandon Sanderson fills the role that used to belong to Michael Crichton and Tony Hillerman: an enjoyable author that put out books that were entertaining with some regularity and that were mainstream enough that when I told people I liked to read, I could mention their names along with a couple other authors so that the conversation wasn't shut down.\n\nIt's always fun to rank things, so here goes:\n\nTop Five Fantasy writers:\n\n5) Jonathan Bellairs (admittedly they are kids books, but the Johnny Dixon books are especially good. The Curse of the Blue Figurine, The Mummy, the Will, and the Crypt, The Eyes of the Killer Robot, The Spell of the Sorcerer's Skull, and The Chessmen of Doom are all delightful books.)\n\n4) Robert E. Howard (especially his Conan stories)\n\n3) Robert Jordan (though I do wish that the WOT was shorter by 3 or 4 volumes, with some editing out of the needless repetition that is an inadequate substitution for real characterization)\n\n2) Tad Williams (especially his Osten Ard books, no one describes setting as lyrically or as well as Tad)\n\n1) Steven Erickson (he does like his diatribes, but for the most part he's a keen observer and long form griping has never been written better or been dressed in better fantastical symbolism. Populating his book with villains that are incarnations of the worst attributes of humanity is nothing short of brilliant. Truly the Jonathan Swift of High Fantasy. It's always satisfying when these villains get their come-uppances.)\n\nTop 5 Science Fiction writers:\n\n5) Roger Zelazny (especially the first 5 books of the Chronicles of Amber, Jack of Shadows and Lord of Light is one of the best Sci-fi books ever written.)\n\n4)Robert A. Heinlein (especially his short stories and novellas, the short story They and novella The Strange Profession of Jonathan Hoag are some of the best short form fiction around)\n\n3) Jules Verne (sure it's laughable now to think that you could get humans to the moon using a giant cannon, but most of his work holds up remarkably well as plausible speculative fiction over 150 years after he wrote it, like Journey to the Center of the Earth, 20,000 Leagues under the sea and especially Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde)\n\n2) HG Wells (though his novels do have some skimmable parts, his prose is compact, his imagination vast, and his short stories are some of the best. His two volume Outline of History is fantastic as well, and it's commonly available at thrift stores.)\n\n1) Horse lover Fats, aka Philip K Dick (if you've ever had a desire to peel back the veil of mundane reality and see the schizophrenic steel and wire machinery that keeps the happy suburban simulacrum of normal life humming, then strap yourself in and go through The Martian Times slip with Phil as your guide, and thrill to the gubbish delight of time traveling precogs used for lucrative building speculation. Or maybe you too can experience the enlightenment of subconscious thought manipulation through orthogonal time achieved by the blast right between your eyes of an intergalactic pink space laser, or perhaps you just want to fend off the unraveling of reality with a can of aerosol propelled Ubik. I highly recommend, with my highest commendation, The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick. It's a vast and strange and strangely vast world my friends.)\n\nTop 10 Authors (a bunch of obscure ones here, I kid)\n\n10) Friedrich Nietzche (The Birth of Tragedy/The Geanology of Morals, Beyond Good and Evil, Ecce Homo, and Thus Spoke Zarathustra are the fun books in philosophy to read. His language is ultra romantic and so very good, his criticisms are always stinging, and his ideas are always interesting. Though his conclusions are often misguided, the journey up the mountain with him is always fun).\n\n9) Goethe (Faust parts 1 and 2)\n\n8) Samuel Taylor Coleridge (He's my favorite poet and The Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner and Khubla Khan are my two favorite poems)\n\n7) Gustave Flaubert (Salammbo is one of the 5 best books I've read. His three tales book, with the three long short stories (or short novellas if you prefer) A Simple Heart, St. Julian the Hospitaler, and Herodias, is one of my 10 favorite books of all times)\n\n6) Herman Hesse (Steppenwolf has its moments, but for my money his best books are Siddhartha and Demian)\n\n5) Haruki Murakami (this is definitely for the more mature readers, some very adult themes are dealt with, but the writing is superb, and there's just a tastefully modest dash of magical realism in his work. I highly recommend Hard Boiled Wonderland/End of the World, The Wind-up Bird Chronicle, and Kafka by the Shore)\n\n4) Philip K. Dick (the only author that makes two lists. His short stories are some of the very best, but most of his novels are exceptional as well. Do yourself a favor and read Flow My Tears the Policeman Said, Through a Scanner Darkly, Ubik, Martian Timeslip, the Valis trilogy, and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. You won't regret it, and if you crack under the psychic strain of realizing everything is gubbish, you'll still have lots to think about in your padded cell. I kid, it's really good stuff.)\n\n3) Plutarch (everyone should read his Lives of the Noble Grecians and Roman's. Since this is available for free on Project Gutenberg there's no reason not to. The 4 volume set translated by Aubrey Stewart and George Long is much clearer in it's exposition, but the single file Collection is the AC Clough edited version of the John Dryden translation, which if you can adjust to reading it's rather elliptical cadence, you will be rewarded with some profoundly beautiful passages.)\n\n2) Dostoevsky (Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but it's an undeniable fact that The Brothers Karamazov is the best book ever written. If you want to read a lesser known book by Fyodor, The Possessed is also amazingly good.)\n\n1) George Orwell (Everyone knows 1984 and Animal Farm, but Orwell's lesser know books are just as good. Down and Out in Paris and London, Burmese Days and especially Keep the Aspidistra Flying are just as good. There's a four volume set of his collected essays and letters that is without a doubt the best thing I've ever read.)\n\nSerious hats off for this! Goethe is great and I too love Faust, but part 2 is just too covoluted. Like a much longer version of the Walpurgisnacht in the first part and this one was largely just Goethe criticizing other autors of his time. And being written about 20 years after the first part it never really fit well for me.\n\nMy list is not that classy, just the authors I really enjoy for one reason or another:\n\n1. Sanderson - Probably more surprising to me than anyone else here. I really wouldn't have thought that an author I just recently discovered (last december) could move up that fast.\n\n2. Neil Gaiman - American Gods will always be one of my favorite books and most of his other works are superb. The Sandman is still one of the defining works for a whole genre and an absolute must read for any comic enthusiast.\n\n3. Terry Prattchett - I simply loves his Witches Series and I have yet to read a bad book by him. Extremely enjoyable and much deeper than anyone might expect.\n\n4. Alan Moore - I really should not have to write much more here. If you know Moores work, there is no explanation needed, if not, it might not be for you. The only reason he isn't higher on my list is that his stories are a bit too wierd. The first chapter of Voice of the Fire might be a good index for that.\n\n5. Simon Beckett - My favorite crime author. Nothing special, just simple murder mysteries with an emphasis on forensics.\n\n6. Garth Nix - His books are kinda hit or miss, but when they are hit, they REALLY are hit. The Old Kingdom Series is my favorite, followed by The Seventh Tower. I could never really get behind the Keys to the Kingdom, but I'd really love a follow-up to Frogkisser. That one was really amazing.\n\n7. Warren Ellis - Mostly for his work in comics and graphic novels, but I also really liked Crooked Little Vein. Gun Machine not so much though.\n\n8. David Edings - Would be much higher on my list except I just really love The Belgariad and The Malloreon. Other books from him just never clicked for me. But those 10 books are really burned into my mind. I know the characters and places better than the world arround me. Feel free to interpret that any way you like.\n\nNoteworthy, but not great authors, no ranking:\n\nTerry Goodkind - The Sword of Truth is actually quite excellent, but I have trouble recommending it to anyone because of the rape fantasies.\n\nJohn Connolly - Another crime author. Very enjoyable, but it drifts into the supernatural very fast after the initiall great Every Dead Thing. Still nice though.\n\nJ.K. Rowlings - I guess almost everybody likes Harry Potter, but I actually really like her works as Robert Galbraith. Of course, crime again, but excellent setting and characters!\n\nTimothy Zahn - If you're ever to read any Star Wars Novel, pick one of his.\n\nI probably forgot some, but that's it for now.\n\nI have LOVED reading through this topic. Probably more than anything else it's reminded me just how much fantasy is out there—which is awesome!\n\nI haven't read very much fantasy yet, even though it's a genre that's meant so much to me. I guess I've read deeply and not widely? Like The Lord of the Rings was never enough Tolkien for me. I had to read the Hobbit, Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, Beren and Luthien etc.\n\nBut even though I haven't yet read enough fantasy to fill a top 5 list of fantasy authors, I wanted to join in. So,\n\n1. Tolkien. This dear man (and also Peter Jackson in many ways) has been entertainer in chief for me through by teenage years. I will love him and his work forever.\n\n2. Brandon Sanderson. I'm just approaching the one-year anniversary of discovering him, and it's been a storming good year. I read The Final Empire first, and I fell in love with it. I still marvel at how vividly I saw the scenes from that book come alive in my imagination.\n\n3. C.S. Lewis. I remember saying to my parents one day, 'I'd really like to read Narnia'. And a few days later there was a shopping bag on my bed with the first two books in it. I was taken completely by surprise. What a wonderful gift! I've also enjoyed Lewis' science fiction. And I've loved his non-fiction even more than his fiction. This guy could THINK!\n\nThe only other fantasy I have read is Lord Foul's Bane by Stephen Donaldson. And I was really intrigued to hear other people's thoughts on it. I guess, as one person put it, I didn't have the right quantity of...angst... because I really, really, really didn't like it. For me, the character of Thomas Covenant was too unlikable. I found it impossible to care about him. I almost don't even like myself when I think about this sort of thing. Thomas Covenant could have fallen off a cliff, and I wouldn't even have shrugged. And I'm disgusted with myself for thinking that! Oh dear, no! Anyway...\n\nI'm glad I could take part. I've now got Lynch, Kuang, Jordan, Martin, Gaiman, and Rothfuss (and the kinda-fantasy-ish Murakami) on my shelf to get myself more and more fantasy-ified. And my big question now is who to start with. I think I'll go with Jordan.\n\nOh I still love the books its just that you can only read something so many times. Clive started as a horror author and when I was young I loved horror but Clive was different than other horror authors for me. There is a point in the middle of his career where he began shifting into fantasy but maintained a very vivid style from his horror days. Imajica is one of the finest books I've read. It is a huge puzzle box of a story that unfolds in a wonderful and inspiring way. It also combines his love of all things sexual and dark. Clive also wrote tons of gay characters at a time and in a genre where there was very few. As I grew older I moved away from things sexual and dark, but I'll still fight for Imajica.\n\nRobert Anton Wilson on the other hand is a guy I will go to bat for til I die. His musing on absurdness, society, science, secret societies and alternate ways of thinking is right up my alley. The Illuminatus Trilogy is the craziest book I've read. It jumps around in time and place for no reason and often mid sentence. The first quarter of that book melted my brain until I had no choice but to just go along with what was on the page. I would put it up with some of the great texts from thinkers like Max Stirner, its just wrapped up in 1970s pulp instead of 1800s philosophical struggle. Its like the Ararchist manifesto hidden within hundreds of pages of conspiracy pulp. The book itself was intended to bring every conspiracy theory at the time (1970s) into an entire story. Its dated, its corny and its also amazing. Its a book that could be entirely rewritten for the current times we are in."
