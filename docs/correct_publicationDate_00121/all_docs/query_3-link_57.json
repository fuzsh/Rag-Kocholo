        "text": "A Spell For Chameleon\n\nFor lack of a spell...\n\nXanth was the enchanted land where magic ruled - where every citizen had a special spell only he could cast. It was a land of centaurs and dragons and basilisks.\n\nFor Bink of the North Village however, Xanth was no fairy tale. He alone had no magic. And unless he got some - and got some fast! - he would be exiled. Forever!\n\nBut the Good Magician Humphrey was convinced that Bink did indeed have magic. In fact, both Beauregard the genie and the magic wall chart insisted that Bink had magic. Magic as powerful as any possessed by the King of by Good Magician Humphrey - or even by the Evil Magician Trent.\n\nBe that as it may, no one could fathom the nature of Bink's very special magic. Bink was in despair. This was even worse that having no magic at all...and he would still be exiled.\n\nThe Source of Magic\n\nThe Magic of Xanth\n\nAs a ruler of a country steeped in enchantment, King Trent was naturally curious about the source of its magic. It made sense to order Bink, the only one of his subjects immune to supernatural harm, to undertake a quest to discover the wellspring of Xanth's uniqueness.\n\nFrom the beginning, Bink and his companions, Chester the centaur and Crombie, the soldier transformed into a griffin, were harried by an unseen enemy determined to thwart them. Even the power of the Good Magician Humfrey, together with Bink's protective talent, scarcely saved their lives.\n\nThen when Humfrey and Crombie turned against him, all seemed lost. But Bink's ingenuity and luck prevailed and he reached his goal. The King's orders had been carried out...\n\nBut the King had not expected Bink's next act - to destroy utterly the magic of Xanth!\n\nCastle Roogna\n\nCentaur Aisle\n\nInto Darkest Mundania\n\nDor was having troubles growing up to be the next Magician King of the magic Land of Xanth. He wanted no part of running the Kingdom. But now Good King Trent was leaving on a trade missing to non-magical Mundania, home of such weird beasts as horses and bears, so Dor had to take over as King for a week.\n\nA week passes. No Trent. Then three weeks. King Trent still hadn't returned. Surely, something terrible had happened; he was apparently held captive in some foul dungeon, unable to escape. Dor was left with the burden of ruling - and with Irene, who was entirely too willing to be his Queen!\n\nHis only hope was to enter Mundania and free King Trent. But how could it be done without the powers of magic? Nevertheless, he started forth bravely - together with Irene, a golem, a centaur, and a young ogre - heading for the far south of Xanth.\n\nThe entrance to Mundania, of course, lay to the north.\n\nOgre, Ogre\n\nWhen Ogre-hood Was In Flower\n\nSmash knew all about ogres. After all, despite his having a human mother, Smash was an ogre himself. Ogres were not onl huge and horribly ugly, as Smash was; they were also so stupid they could hardly speak, and they spent most of their time fighting, destroying, and eating young girls.\n\nSo what was he doing here with seven assorted females looking to him to guide them and save them? Even in Xanth, where magic made anything possible, why should Tandy the Nymph trust him and seem fond of him? And how could all that high-flown conversation be coming out of his mouth?\n\nBut that, it seemed, was what he got for going to Good Magician Humfrey for an Answer - before he even knew what the Question was!\n\nNight Mare\n\n\"Beware The Horseman!\"\n\nThe Nextwave of barbarian warriors was invading Xanth from the north, ravaging and destroying as they advanced. But Mare Imbrium had her own problems. Ever since she had gained the half soul, the night mare had begun to mishandle her job of delivering bad dreams. Now the Night Stallion dismissed her, exiling her to the day world with a message for King Trent: \"Beware the Horseman!\"\n\nShe had not idea of what that meant. But that was the way with prophetic warnings - nobody could understand them until it was too late.\n\nThen she met the Horseman. And she discovered that one who would ride a night mare was a master of bit and spur, and not a man to surrender her.\n\nFor the night mare, it began to be all a horrible nightmare!\n\nDragon on a Pedestal\n\nThere was trouble in Xanth again - all kinds of trouble in fact.\n\nThe Gap Dragon had escaped from the Gap and was ravaging across the land. The forget-spell that had covered the Gap was breaking up into small forget-whorls that wandered about, giving amnesia to all they touched. Good Magician Humfrey might have had the Answer, but he had overdosed on water from the Fountain of Youth and was only a helpless baby.\n\nAnd Ivy, three-year-old daughter of King Dor and Queen Irene, was lost in the jungles south of the Gap. While Irene sought her without much hope, Ivy was wandering further into danger, her memories erased by a passing forget-whorl. Her path was leading her directly to where the Gap dragon was seeking dinner.\n\nCrewel Lye\n\nA knight of ghosts and shadows.\n\nJordan was a ghost in Castle Roogna now, spending his time with little five-year old Ivy and watching his own past unfold on the magic tapestry. But once he had been a valorous knight, riding his ghost horse Pook on a fabulous and dangerous mission.\n\nHe had been betrayed with a cruel lie by two wily magicians and the woman he loved. He had been killed at the end, and his bones had been scattered. Now he could not even remember where they had been buried.\n\nThis was important, because Jordan's talent had been to recover from almost any injury, provided enough of his body could be assembled to grow together again. But all that had been four hundred years before. Nobody who was alive today knew or cared where his bones might be.\n\nIt was hardly the proper ending for a gallant adventure!\n\nGolem in the Gears\n\nA golem to the rescue.\n\nGrundy Golem was the size of an inconsequence, and nobody had any respect for him - including Grundy! To prove himself, he volunteered to ride the Monster Under the Bed to the Ivory Tower to find little Ivy's long-lost dragon, Stanley Steamer.\n\nAfter many adventures, he reached the Tower, to learn that the Evil Sea Hag kept lovely Rapunzel imprisoned there, her body destined to be used to maintain the witch's immortality. Grundy managed to free the damsel, and they fled together.\n\nAs the descendant of Jordan the Barbarian and Bluebell Elf, Rapunzel could become any size, even that of any Golem's dreamgirl. But Grundy knew she was surely fated for someone better then he. Besides, the Sea Hag still pursued them to destroy him and get her back.\n\nAnd he still hadn't found Stanley Steamer.\n\nVale of the Vole\n\nDefenders of the Voles.\n\nFor young Esk, the ogre-nymph-human, what had begun as an escape from the clutches of a seductive demoness - and a pilgrimage to the Good Magician Humfrey - was now an errand of mercy. A running-river paradise and its harmless inhabitants were perishing in the wrathful wake of a greedy demon horde. And it was up to Esk and his new-found companions - a beautiful winged centaur and a brave burrower named Volney - to search Xanth's treacherous reaches, gathering together a mind-boggling company of creatures to defend the precious Vale of the Vole.\n\nHeaven Cent\n\nA boy's fabulous quest.\n\nTo Xanth's precocious shape-shifter Prince Dolph, searching for Humfrey, the missing sorcerer, is a perfect chance to see the world. Setting off with his faithful companion Marrow, an enchanted skeleton, he will penetrate an island of illusion...escape a goblin kingdom...outwit a husband-hungry mermaid...nest-sit for fiery dragons...and find romance with a slinky snake princess - all on his way to discovering a magic coin with the answers!\n\nMan From Mundania\n\nThe quest continues.\n\nThere's nothing more exciting than a Quest, especially for a young princess of Xanth who's bored with sitting around Castle Roogna. But when Ivy uses the Heaven Cent, it takes her not to the top of Mount Rushmost, where the winged monsters gather, not to the sea where the merfolk swim - but to Mundania, a boring world (much like our own), where she meets a young college student so dull that he doesn't even believe in magic, or princesses, or Xanth!\n\nDoes he ever have a lot to learn!\n\nIsle of View\n\nLovelorn loveworn love lost\n\nPerplexed Prince Dolph, Xanth's precocious shapeshifter, should be in love but isn't. Nonetheless, he must choose between two fiancees - Nada the uninterested and Electra the uninteresting - or all three of them will suffer the most dire consequences. Luckily a convenient catastrophe has popped up to distract Dolph from his dilema - the foal-napping of young Che Centaur by goblins. And the only one who knows where Che is is a nice but remarkably naive elflike girl named Jenny from the World of Two Moons. If anyone can save the missing centaur...she sure can't!\n\nQuestion Quest\n\nYouth is wasted on the young.\n\nBeing grown up is a drag...or so thinks Lacuna, one of the mischievous Castle Zombie twins. So she makes the Good Magician Grey an offer he can't refuse. Thirsty for a taste of the Elixir of Youth, she'll help him outwit the evil Com-Pewter if he'll send her to Hell (in a handbasket, no less) to find Humfrey, the missing sorcerer. And while there, she'll learn the True History of Xanth (simplified) and help rescue a blushing Rose from the demon X(A/N)th...with the help from a gorgon or two.\n\nThe Color of Her Panties\n\nWe see England, we see Xanth, we see Mela's underpanth.\n\nIn fact, Gwenny Goblin, Che Centaur and Jenny Elf are just about the only creatures on Xanth who have been spared the sight of Mela Merwoman's undergarments - preoccupied as they are with helping Gwenny beat out her awful half-brother Gobble for chiefship of the goblin horde. But first they must master space and thyme...and find the fabulous egg that sits between the Roc and teh hard place. While Mela - who would gladly relinquish her oft-viewed undies for a new husband - joins the Adult Conspiracy...and quickly discovers the power of a perfect pair of panties.\n\nDemons Don't Dream\n\nDemons Don't Dream begins a thrilling new Xanth sequence, as a pair of young adventurers play for the highest stakes of all: the future of Xanth - and of Earth as well!\n\nDrawn into Xanth by a harmless-looking computer game, two young people find themselves competing for a precious prize: Dug, who is beguiled by a beautiful serpent-princess, and Kim, who discovers her favorite fantasy realm has suddenly become frightenlingly real.\n\nIn a desperate race against time, Dug and Kim battle their way across the wonderous, perilous land of Xanth, testing their courage against dozens of fearsome obstacles (and their wits against a host of outrageous puns!). But when treachery, danger, and deceit place Xanth itself in peril, Dug and Kim learn that some things are more important than winning or losing.\n\nA breathtaking, madcap quest filled with fearsome monsters and far-fetched fun. Demons Don't Dream is vintage Xanth, an unforgettable escapade from fantasy's most imaginative story-teller.\n\nHarpy Thyme\n\nGloha is the only creature of her kind in all the world of Xanth, the beautiful offspring of a chance mating between a harpy and a goblin. As she grew to womanhood, she wondered where she would find the one true love with whom she could share life.\n\nSo naturally, she sets off to find the Good Magician Humphrey to ask him for an Answer to the riddle of her heart's desire. But Humphrey, for mysterious reasons of his own, propels her instead on a perilous quest in search of truth, friendship, and, just possibly, happiness.\n\nGeis of the Gargoyle\n\nSince Xanth began, the gargoyles of that magical place have been under a magical compulsion to protect the purity of the Swan Knee River which flows into Xanth from dreary Mundania. But recently the pollution from the outside world has grown ever greater, and young Gary Gar, latest in a long line of gargoyle guardians, is finding it ever more difficult to fulfill his responsibilities.\n\nSo Gary does what any sensible Xanth resident with a dire dilema would do. He goes to see the Good Magician Humfrey, who sends him on a peculiar quest - to transform himself into a human shape, tutor a precocious child with more than her share of wild magical talents, and find a philter which can restore the river to its previous pristine state.\n\nI started writing this review by giving a brief opinion on each of the books. Of course that's when I thought that there were about 17 books in the series. Well, many MANY more books later I realize that there are too many to cover in detail (as of December 2007 there are 29 and counting). So I will be general.\n\nGood Points:\n\nThere is a storyline weaving its way through all of the books. We start with one character, then we follow his children, sometimes branch off to a friend, and so forth. This makes the series addictive, you want to find out what happens next to your favorite character. Of course, it is also disappointing to know that some characters will fade out from the storyline as they age and you'll be lucky if they even get mentioned again. But I still consider that a good point. This also means the books should be read in order, as they do reference previous events, though some are more standalone than others.\n\nIf you are a fan of really obscur fantasy creatures, like manticores, hippogryphs, and even centaurs, here you will find them all. If you can imagine the creature, it will probably show up at some point. Unicorns fans however beware, there's only been one by the time I got to the ninth book. On the other hand, dragons, centaurs and zombies are extremely common.\n\nThe setting is amazing, most of the plotlines interesting, some of them downright suspenseful (Night Mare is highly recommended!) some of them basically pointless (Ogre, Ogre wasn't all that interesting).\n\nBad Points:\n\nPuns, sometimes really bad puns, sometimes pages upon pages just dedicated to puns. Puns in passing are ok, several pages in a row that have no other purpose than to please fans who send in their own puns, cramming them in, without any purpose to forward the plot, that's just too much. Anthony requested from his fans to stop sending them in, because the editor has started taking them out. Most books have a couple gratuitous pages of puns, but generally you can run through those. But if you hate puns, stay away, stay FAR away.\n\nJuvenile behaviour and speech. \"Snoot-nose!\" \"Horse-rear!\" Stuff like that, and usually a fair amount of that. But no truly bad language, I think I saw \"Hell!\" exclaimed once, and \"Damn!\" mentioned a few times, but not in the context you might expect. Also, many of the books have, well, damsels in distress. Which is ok, except when just about every female encountered is generally helpless, beautiful, and not much good for anything except getting in trouble and kicking her pretty little feet. Some female characters turn out stronger than others but by book 9, only two of them were main characters. One was a horse, the other a 3-year old child. Most of the males spend most of their time wondering what colour are the panties those helpless females are wearing, or in the case of centaurs who wear no panties? They admire the visible attributes quite a bit. I happen to be female, maybe men find the books equally sexist in the representation of the male characters, I don't know. At least they don't spend so much time naked, jiggling enticingly. And when they are naked, we get no details (so unfair!) So feminists, stay away, stay FAR away.\n\nNote that though many kids like these books, Anthony points out that they are written with adults in mind. As he muses, that's probably why the kids like them. Spell for Chameleon was on my high school summer reading list (that's how I got started on this series) so it seems that they are school approved at least for teenagers.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you can stomach the puns, the juvenile behaviour, and the sexism, then maybe you can enjoy the other fantasy aspects of these books. I find I don't generally like them, but I do find them addictive. Do I recommend them? Not really, you have to make the decision yourself. Some people will hate these books. Others, like me, will probably get attached to the characters and annoyed at all the silly stuff. And finally, there are true hardcore fans out there. Read the first couple, suffer throught the next few, and get to Night Mare. If you don't like that one, then its time to give up.\n\nSeptember 2010\n\nI hadn't read any Piers books for quite some time, so first thing I noted was that there are WAY too many characters. Even with little hints dropped here and there as to where we might have last met the character, I honestly couldn't remember a lot of them. I could recall with great clarity the storylines of about the first 8 books or so, but after that they all just mushed together. That's why I was so thrilled when Magician Trent appeared in Harpy Thyme, I really missed the older characters, and it was refreshing to have a non-teenage character to read about, he's actually one of the few characters I have a lot of respect for, perhaps because he was an adult from the very start. I'd had enough with figuring out the colour of women's panties or wondering what the Adult Conspiracy was all about! I suggest skipping The Colour of Her Panties, I've read better fanfic on the web. Demons Don't Dream had an interesting twist by mixing in a Mundane computer game with the fantasy world, especially as characters have become aware of the fact that their world is full of puns. Before the puns where just there, now they become a plot element in and of themselves. Makes them more tolerable. However, while Piers always states in the back of the books he had to hold back on some of the puns for the sake of the plot...um, yeah, not really. The puns overwhelm pretty much everything. Honestly, I don't know why I keep reading them, but I'm one of those people who if they start something, they will see it through.\n\nJune 2011\n\nAnd in Geis of the Gargoyle, Sorceress Iris makes a return, and it was suprisingly less driven by puns than it was by plot, a refreshing change! Yes the first two chapters is just one pun after another but once the story gets going it's actually rather interesting. Roc and a Hard Place was just an excuse to bring out all the old characters, to remind us of the large number of them (and introduce some new ones). I found it didn't really have much plot, Metria just runs around Xanth collecting about 30 characters. While it was nice to see the really old ones again, like Trent, Iris and Arnolde, I really had to work my brain to recall the some of the in-between ones. And yet, by the end of it, I was already wondering where I put the next book in the series. Maybe there is some addictive magic dust within the pages."
