        "text": "Piers Anthony's Novels There have been many notable figures in the field of writing. Most of those people are long dead, but there are a few that are pretty fresh on the scene. One such author is Piers Anthony. He has written many novels and long series, which have all done extremely well. Despite the major differences between Anthony's novels, he tends to use repeating themes throughout all of his books. Piers Anthony is currently living in a log cabin with his wife. He does not have any other job so she must pay the bills while he is between books. They own a small farm with some horses. He is an average man so this might be one of the reasons why he tends to have the most common people become the heroes in his books. In Anthony's most well known series, Xanth, he uses thinly disguised mature content and extremely fantastic creatures to attract audiences from all age ranges (Reviews-Zombie Lover 3). Anthony also uses puns, play on words (for example quicksand is sand that would make you go really fast), to make the reader laugh at how common things can turn out to have amazing properties (Anthony, Spell for Chameleon). Some of Anthony's more mature subjects are the Adult Conspiracy and summoning the stork. In his book the Adult Conspiracy is made up of every adult and they must keep kids from learning anything fun or mature. Children and nymphs cannot summon the stork. It is only mentioned as the way for two loving adults to send a message that says they want a kid, which is actually delivered by a stork. Magic abounds in this series and any person who does not have magic is shunned as an outcast (Bleiler 365). In each of this series' books he only has one main character. In Anthony's Apprentice Adept series he shows a brilliant blend between a fantasy world and a science fiction world. In one world Style, the main character, is a lowly serf being chased by one of the rulers and in the other he is the most powerful magician, being chased by his fellow magicians (Anthony, Split Infinity). While magic is not as dominant as in the Xanth series it still plays a major part. Mature content makes this book unsuitable for younger readers. This series eventually build to a stunning climax where the fantasy and science fiction worlds unite."
