Rosenberg did more than anyone else to make the reading we do for fun acceptable in libraries and to legitimize it as an area of study for librarians. I (and other readers of popular genre fiction) owe her a debt of gratitude for validating our love of purely fun reading matter and giving genre fiction the status it well deserves. I would like to thank Bonnie Kunzel, readers' advisor extraordinaire, for her assistance in finding wonderful new books to read. Thanks also go to Nathan Sundance Herald for assistance with this manuscript. Thanks to Joyce Saricks, Kristen Ramsdell, Tony Fonseca, June Michele Pulliam, and Michael Gannon for helping keep me on track and providing ideas for lots of new great stuff to read. Barbara Ittner provided invaluable insights and suggestions, as well as major hand-holding through the tough parts. The online catalogs of Rio Grande (NM) Library District, Los Angeles (CA) Public Library, Johnson County (KS) Public Library, San Antonio (TX) Public Library, and Arapahoe County (CO) Library District were essential in the preparation of this book. Acknowledgment must also be made of the vital online community of readers' advisors that meets daily on fiction_1, of Roberta Johnson for creating it in the first place, and of Natalya Fishman, who currently manages it. And last but not least, thanks to all the folks who recommend their favorite genre fiction to me wherever I go in my travels.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xi\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_ii\n\nintentionally left blank\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xiii\n\nnext page > Page xiii\n\nPreface to the Fifth Edition Rosenberg's first law of reading: ''Never apologize for your reading tastes.\" Genre fiction has been important to me my entire life. I started off conventionally enough with Nancy Drew and Tom Swift, rapidly moving on to Cherry Ames and Vicki Barr and then to the works of T. H. White, Zane Grey, Andre Norton, Anya Seton, and Frank Yerby before hitting my teens. I lived my life in genre fiction and fortunately moved often, finding new and exciting treasures in every new library about the time I would exhaust the resources of the old one. My book-a-day habit required that I read from several genres, which made me an omnivorous fan. For years I thought this propensity for compulsively losing myself in other worlds and other times was a defectbut then I came across the work of Betty Rosenberg, a pivotal point in my life. Betty's Genreflecting actually validated the type of reading I had been pursuing since primary school. When Ed Evans introduced Genreflecting to me in library school, I realized I was there for a purpose: to put people together with the books they wanted to read. This guide, then, is an attempt to help bring together readers and the books that will give them pleasure. Nothing else gives a readers' advisorwhether in the library, a bookstore, or in everyday lifethe satisfaction of successfully playing cupid between a reader and a book. Genre fiction is constantly evolving and changing, even though at its core it remains the same: a story in which something noticeable happens. Trends affect what is available in stores and libraries. Genres wax and wane. The current strength of mysteries makes it hard to believe that in the 1970s some experts were worrying about that genre's incipient demise. Westerns, once a genre section found in almost every public library, seem to be disappearing, as very few new titles are being published as Westerns. The major trend in the late 1990s was genre blending, a mixing of one genre with another. For example, Westerns, which at first glance seem to be fading, are turning up in romance, fantasy, and historical fiction. Romance now plays a greater role in science fiction and in fact in almost every genre. Strains of humor and detection are found in horror and science fiction. The combination of genres is endless. Genres, once so easy to codify that Jove published a series of generic genre fiction in the 1970s, are becoming increasingly difficult to pigeonhole. Where once the biggest decision was whether a specific work belonged in romantic suspense or suspenseful romance, now one may have to contend with a book that could fit into the genres of horror, romance, crime, and fantasy as well as being humorous.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xiii\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xiv\n\nnext page > Page xiv\n\nThe chapter on historical fiction (Chapter 1) is new to this volume. After debating whether to continue with the chapter on Westerns or integrate it into the historical chapter, it was decided to let it stand, at least for this edition. A few of the other changes include the addition of \"Biothrillers\" to \"Adventure\" (Chapter 4), \"Literary Fantasy\" to ''Fantasy\" (Chapter 7), \"Virtual Reality\" to \"Science Fiction\" (Chapter 6), and several more new subgenres. Of course, many new authors and titles have been added and those no longer in print or easily available in libraries have been deleted. To find information on older titles and reference works of historical interest, readers should consult previous editions of this book. The importance of genre fiction in the lives of readers has been made more evident by the plethora of tools now available to help genre readers find the books they want. Several new guides, listed in the \"Topics\" section of each chapter, have been published. Libraries Unlimited has embarked on a bold new series of advisory guides that covers several different genres and fiction types. NoveList, now marketed by EBSCO, assists patrons with readers' advisory queries through the automated catalogs of libraries, and book shoppers in bookstores that have Syndetic Solutions Fiction Profiles or Muze Books kiosks find genre access there. As far as training for librarians who want to help with the patron's search for the right book at the right time, some library schools have recently added readers' advisory classes, and libraries, consortiums, library systems, and library organizations across the country are making available workshops and programs on genre fiction and readers' advisory. The Internet has made available the readers' services desks of several public libraries providing lists of book groupings and readalikes. In addition to mailing list groups and news-groups for specific genres, a mailing group called fiction_1 now exists for librarians working with fiction questions. Here readers' advisors can get help, exchange information, answer difficult questions, and assemble read-alike lists. The professional review journals have been more accepting of genre fiction in recent years. One can only hope that in the coming years these trends will continue, because as our awareness grows and new readers' advisory tools appear, we, as librarians or book-sellers, can do our jobs more effectively. In the end, the satisfied reader is our greatest reward.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xiv\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xv\n\nnext page > Page xv\n\nIntroduction What is not found in lifesuccess, prestige, pleasureis sought in reading material. Richard Baumberger \"Promoting the Reading Habit,\" UNESCO Reports and Papers on Mass Communication 72 (1975) \"But as for me, I find escapist literature the very thing for my woes big and small, and always have done. I write it to escape, and read it for the same reason . . . Fiction tries to interpret . . . truth, and escapist fiction tries to do that, and give it the best ending it can while it's at it. That's why I love it. What's so bad about feeling good?\" Edith Layton in posting to RRA-L The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition (© 1996 by Houghton Mifflin Company) defines genre as \"a category of artistic composition, as in music or literature, marked by a distinctive style, form, or content.\" The term genre fiction is commonly used to discuss works of fiction that fall into the areas of mystery, suspense, thriller, adventure, romance, Western, science fiction, fantasy, and horror. The books usually described as genre fiction are books that have content that allows them to be easily categorized as belonging to a specific genre. Settings, whether the Old West, a distant planet in a distant time, a historical period on our planet, or a place where magic happens, are easily identifiable as one criterion for some types of genre fiction. Other times it is the plotboy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy and girl come back together and live happily ever after. Death happens under unusual circumstances and a detective follows clues until the mystery is solved. Literary, mainstream, or substantial fictionall terms used to define much of the fiction that is regarded as literatureis actually a genre of its own that is not ordinarily grouped with genre fiction. A full discussion of the literary genre can be found in Nancy Pearl's Now Read This: A Guide to Mainstream Fiction, 19781998 (Libraries Unlimited, 1999). It can be said that genre fiction, which tends to be the favorite form of fiction of the common reader, is the Rodney Dangerfield of literature. These books \"get no respect.\" While critics, scholars, and even some librarians hope to elevate the tastes of the reading public, readers continue to read what they like.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xv\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xvi\n\nnext page > Page xvi\n\nThe roots of genre fiction are in the distant past, when storytellers and bards held audiences enraptured by their tales and ballads of wondrous adventure, larger-than-life heroes and heroines, and magical beasts. While the literary quality may vary, the thrill of a strong plot, interesting dialog, and a satisfactory conclusion lead many individuals to read for pleasure. The Nature of Genre Fiction Genre fiction is constantly evolving, even though its essence remains the samea tale of heroism in which the characters surmount obstacles to triumph. The scale of the heroism can be as large as a galaxy or as small and intimate as a pair of struggling lovers, but in genre fiction a character or characters are faced with an obstacle that is overcome through some strength of character, intelligence, or physical attribute. Genre fiction is plot-driven, but can also have masterful characterization and graceful prose. In recent years genre fiction has undergone a metamorphosis that continues. Genreblending runs rampant. Genre fiction, once known for being formulaic, now stretches boundaries while trying to maintain its original appeal. Romance tales often include mysteries and murder that take place in futuristic societies. Faerie folk pop up in Westerns, while tales of horror and the occult go for the laughs. Any imaginable combination of genres has probably been attempted. This may be the most exciting era in history to be a reader of genre fiction or to be a librarian or bookseller helping readers to find suitable genre fiction. Authors of genre fiction tend to be prolific, with continuing characters playing a large role in most genres. Characters are so important that often books are referred to by the names of the characters rather than by the name of the author or the book's title. Some characters seem so real that biographies have been written about them. Two excellent resources exist for finding the order of books in the series listed in this guide. They are To Be Continued: An Annotated Guide to Sequels (Oryx Press, 1995), by Merle L. Jacob and Hope Apple, and Sequels: An Annotated Guide to Novels in Series (American Library Association, 1997), by Janet G. Husband and Jonathan F. Husband. If you need to answer questions about genre fiction that is out of print or no longer easily available, The Whole Story: 3000 Years of Sequels & Sequences (Thorpe, 1998), compiled by John E. Simkin, is a good resource. This book can also help identify authors or titles when only the character name is known. Who Is the Common Reader? In recent years librarians, enamored with the possibilities of technology and anxious to justify their budgets and services, have increasingly cast themselves in the role of information professionals. Public libraries filled with glowing computer terminals link patrons to data in their local collections and beyondto the global metadata available through the Internet. Indeed, the librarian as gatekeeper to the world of information is a position of power and importanceto governmental organizations and corporations, as well as to everyday citizens. From this lofty position it is sometimes\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xvi\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xvii\n\nnext page > Page xvii\n\ndifficult to consider the needs of the common reader who seeks the simple pleasure of books. As a gatekeeper, a librarian may question the value of dispensing the latest Stephen King horror novel or Catherine Coulter romance to eager patrons, or may wonder how to justify the expenditure of library funds on popular fiction. Yet it is in this capacity as a provider of genre fiction that librarians may be able to best serve their publics. Circulation figures consistently demonstrate that library users seek and use fiction collections as much or more than other parts of the library. At the North Carolina Central University Readers' Advisory Conference in 1999, it was noted that in North Carolina, two-thirds of public library circulation was fiction. It is clear that, to a large extent, our public is the common reader. But who are the common readers and what exactly do they want? Simply put, common readers are the people who read. Common readers borrow from the library, or buy or trade books. Common readers read because they enjoy reading, entering another world with more excitement than the mundane, everyday world. These people know the difference between reality and fantasy, but choose to enjoy the age-old tradition of storytelling. Common readers are of any intellectual level and work in all jobs, professions, and careers. They fall into all economic levels of society. Common readers are our public and our customers. Libraries and Genre Fiction Earlier editions of Genreflecting discussed the controversy over maintaining collections of genre fiction in libraries. Rosenberg cited many articles criticizing popular reading as well as many articles promoting the library as a community resource for popular fiction. Even now, nearly 20 years after publication of the first edition of Genreflecting, where Rosenberg introduced her first law of readingnever apologize for your reading tastesto the public, the controversy rages. The forum may have moved from library periodicals onto the Internet, but a lively exchange still ensued when a librarian asked a newsgroup for opinions regarding the purchase of a \"not so good book\" because a library user had made requests that it be purchased. Oh, the flames as accusations of censorship and wrong thinking were exchanged! In truth, while the American Library Association has recognized the value of a library's role as \"popular reading center,\" some librarians continue to sniff disdainfully at genre fiction. Fortunately for the millions of library users, more librarians see their community's need for popular reading materials. While popular fiction collections are not funded in a ratio equivalent to their usage, libraries in the 1990s are making an effort to improve access to popular fiction. Several library schools have added readers' advisory classes. In 1998 the Public Library Association conference offered an entire track of workshops on popular reading topics attended by standing-room-only audiences. Because of the popularity of the topic, PLA offered an additional symposium on this topic in 1999 and is offering the track again at its 2000 conference. Many libraries throughout the United States have staff training and in-service days devoted to learning more about genre fiction and how to help library patrons with their popular reading needs. To further help patrons find genre fiction, easily identifiable genre fiction is often shelved separately in libraries. Historically, Westerns, mysteries, and science fiction have had their own sections or shelves in libraries. Some consider this unfair segregation,\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xvii\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xviii\n\nnext page > Page xviii\n\nbut most common readers (who know what they like and don't care about others' opinions of their reading tastes) like the chance to browse a manageable segment of the collection and find a number of books from their favorite genre all in one place. In large collections, separate shelving provides access to genre collections and also helps avoid information overload. Sharon L. Baker, who has written about information overload and fiction classification, has suggested that physically separating genre books from the general collection helps users of large collections select books without becoming overwhelmed. In addition to giving browsers a smaller and less intimidating set of books to choose from, it allows them to select from particular genres of interest. Spine labeling by genre is another widely used method to help readers in their quest for books they want to read. Some libraries shelve paperbacks separately from hardcover books. One common practice is to shelve hardcover romance fiction with general fiction and to segregate the paperbacks of the genre in another area. This gives the impression that paperback romances are not \"quite as good\" as their hardcover counterparts. Avid readers of a particular genre want the story and are not particular about the format. In my experience as a librarian, most readers prefer that hardcover and paperback books be shelved together by genre. Paperbacks covered with self-adhesive plastic often hold up for more than 100 circulations at Mesa County (CO) Public Library. This defeats the argument that paperbacks cannot be treated like hardcover books because they physically do not last as long. Shelving books by genre does create problems, especially in this era of genreblending. Should a science fiction romance be shelved with science fiction or with romance? Challenges in classification and organization, however, have yet to deter any selfrespecting readers' advisory librarian from trying to organize the fiction collection in a manner that helps readers find the books they want. Another improvement is access to genre fiction through the catalog. The GASFD classifications give users points of access for fiction other than merely title and author. Unfortunately, many libraries fail to catalog paperback fiction, which leaves huge segments of the collection read by common readers inaccessible except by serendipity. This presents problems, especially when an author's first several titles are paperback originals followed by hardcover releases. The reader wants early books in the series, but even when the library owns the paperbacks, they can't always be easily found, and there is no way of placing a hold or reserve on them through the public access catalog. Readers' Advisory Service Putting people together with the books they want to read is the purpose of a readers' advisory service. Knowing the literature, knowing the reader, and facilitating the meeting of the two are the key to being an effective readers' advisor. Almost 20 years ago, John Naisbitt, in his best-selling book Megatrends, wrote about the importance of becoming \"high touch\" in a \"high tech\" world. As libraries become more and more high-tech, readers' advisory is one of the best ways for librarians to maintain a personal relationship with patrons. Readers' advisory may well be the library service that keeps libraries vital in the new century as current library users\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xviii\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xix\n\nnext page > Page xix\n\nbecome more sophisticated at using the electronic resources that are moving out of libraries and into homes via personal computers. A well-armed readers' advisor keeps an arsenal of resources at hand, including bibliographies and book lists in the form of bookmarks or pamphlets that many libraries provide. A helpful method, particularly for librarians who follow a reading plan, is to maintain a list of all titles read. Some librarians prefer to keep the list on index cards in a file, others use a database, and some keep a chronological list in their day planners. A short annotation and an indication of genre and type make the list extremely useful for readers' advisory service and also sharpen the librarian's writing skills. Many libraries maintain notebooks where staff reviews or annotations are on file, which gives greater access to the information. Even if one does not have the time to write annotations, however, it is very helpful to maintain at least an author/title listing of books read. Reading plans, scorned by some, are simply ways of mapping out in advance a plan to sample various genres. Several years ago in libraries with a dedication to readers' advisory services (and the staff to support it), novice readers' advisors were assigned a variety of novels to read to become conversant in the different genres. An example of such a reading plan might be to read one book from each genre, then go back through the genres again, this time reading a book by a different author in each genre. Some reading plans were very specific; for example, to read a novel by Dorothy Sayers, followed by a novel by Zane Grey, then one by Isaac Asimov, and finally one by Grace Livingston Hill. A second pass in such a specific plan might call for novels by Raymond Chandler, Max Brand, Robert Silverberg, and Danielle Steel. This ensured that the readers' advisors became familiar with a diversity of authors within each genre. For an advisor who does not read romance, it can be quite eye-opening to read a Bertrice Small novel and an Avalon romance to see the diversity within the genre. Guiding the Reader to the Next Book (Neal-Schuman, 1996), edited by Kenneth D. Shearer, features articles that not only provide a philosophical overview of readers' advisory but also includes articles on practical aspects of the art. Joyce G. Saricks and Nancy Brown have written an excellent guide, Readers' Advisory Service in the Public Library, second edition (American Library Association, 1997). It is a must-read for anyone striving to perform readers' advisory service with any degree of excellence. The authors detail ways to determine the appeal of a book so that similar books can be found. Discovering \"likes\" comes only from reading the books themselves, not from reading a reference book about genres. Just because two books are similar by virtue of belonging to the same genre does not mean that they have similar appeal. In her brief chapter \"Advising the Reader\" in Romance Fiction: A Guide to the Genre (Libraries Unlimited, 1999), Kristin Ramsdell shares some effective guidelines for advising readers in general. She notes that not all readers in need of assistance will ask for it, thus the need for passive readers' advisory. Passive readers' advisory includes shelving genre fiction separately, providing book lists and displays, and labeling spines. All these things, though not a substitute for an interview with a good readers' advisor, help readers to find books in the genres they like. Readers' advisory pages are springing up on the World Wide Web. Needle in a CyberStack lists several at http://members.home.net/albeej/pages/Advisory.html.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xix\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xx\n\nnext page > Page xx\n\nMost are published by libraries and include book reviews, lists, and links to helpful fiction-related sites. Morton Grove Public Library maintains one of the best readers' advisory sites on the Web at http://www.webrary.org/rs/rslinks.html. Roberta Johnston, the originator of fiction_1, has posted information from her workshop, Readers' Advisory on the Internet, at http://www.fictional.org/index.html. But perhaps the most important skills for readers' advisors are listening skills. Simply asking patrons about a book they enjoyed in the past reveals more about what they might enjoy in the future than all the reference books and reading lists put together. Publishing Genre Fiction Genre fiction is popular fiction that publishers continue to publish because it sells. At least half of the titles on the weekly bestseller lists (hardcover and paperback) are genre titles. Prolific and popular authors appear regularlyanything they publish, regardless of its quality, will sell. In the article \"The Red & the Black: Hardcover Best-sellers\" by Daisy Maryles in the March 29, 1999, issue of Publishers Weekly Online, she states that the books that were best sellers for the year were \"predictable,\" ''commercial,\" and had \"name-brand recognition.\" The Publishers Weekly number one best seller was a legal thriller by John Grisham, who has held the number one spot for four years. In second place was a Tom Clancy technothriller, and in third a Stephen King horror novel. Out of the top 15 bestsellers, there were five crime novels, three romance novels (if one includes womanly fiction by Danielle Steel in romance), two horror novels, and one adventure novel. Publishers Weekly does not separate fiction from non-fiction for its mass market best seller list, but all eight titles that sold in excess of 2 million copies in 1998 were genre fiction, and of the 26 titles that sold between 1 and 2 million copies, 20 were genre fiction (\"The Red & the Black: Paperback Bestsellers\" by Mark Rotella, Publishers Weekly Online, March 29, 1999). Even the bestseller lists from the New York Times Book Review, a bastion of literary fiction, reflect that genre fiction is what people want to read. The May 16, 1999, Best Sellers Plus list of 35 books featured nine romance, six crime, three adventure, three science fiction, two fantasy, and two horror titles. Genre fiction is published in all formats: hardcover, paperback, audiotape, compact disc, and over the Internet. The publishing industry has seen radical changes in the last couple of years. Giant publishing houses have merged, forming even larger houses. Bantam Doubleday Dell is now part of Random, Inc. Penguin and Putnam have become Penguin Putnam. As the giants battle it out for supremacy on the best-seller lists by giving staggeringly huge contracts to the top grossing writers, they seem to be publishing less and less midlist fiction, which, of course, is necessary for the voracious appetites of readers. At the same time, new technology gives small publishers and self-published authors opportunities never before seen. It is now possible for small publishing houses to make a go of it. Even self-published titles are garnering critical approval. These small presses are becoming a good resource for finding new authors. Write Way Publishing publishes approximately 10 original genre novels a year in hardcover. These\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xx\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xxi\n\nnext page > Page xxi\n\nare primarily mystery novels, but also include science fiction, fantasy, and horror. Intrigue Press, which specializes in mysteries, publishes seven to 10 original and reprint titles a year in both hardcover and paperback. Genesis Press began in 1993 by publishing African-American romances but now also publishes Latino, Asian, and interracial romances. Russell Like formed Brunswick Galaxy Publishing to publish his science fiction book After the Blue, which he bought back from a publisher who had placed it on a backburner. It has garnered critical praise as a highly entertaining book. Reprint editions are of particular importance in genre fiction because so many titles go out of print so quickly. Readers often discover a \"new\" author, often of a series, and find that reprint editions are the only source for finding earlier titles. The largeprint publishers have long been a great source for genre fiction reprints in both hardcover and trade paperback. Severn House publishes hardcover reprints of several genres. New on the scene is Five Star, which publishes both reprints and originals in Western and romance. Women and Genre Fiction Women have always written and been featured in genre fiction, but the 1980s saw a tremendous surge in the popularity of the woman's role. By the end of the decade, thrillers featuring women as private investigators or amateur investigators were appearing weekly. Who by now has not heard of V. I. Warshawski or Kinsey Millhone? The 1990s saw an explosion of secondary materials dealing with women in crime fiction, such as the titles Detecting Women and By a Woman's Hand. Women also gained recognition in science fiction and fantasy and no longer had to resort to male pseudonyms or only their initials. Many readers discovered for the first time that James Tiptree, Jr., Andre Norton, Julian May, and C. J. Cherryh were all women. It became more acceptable in those genres for authors to have first names like Margaret, Sherri, or Pamela. In the new millennium, genre fiction continues to grow and evolve, which makes it more difficult to define, but also builds excitement in the reading public. In this milieu, the role of the readers' advisor has expanded and become more complex. The core of our role, however, remains the same: as readers' advisors it is important first to read and enjoy, and second to share information. Purpose and Scope of This Guide The primary purpose of this guide is to put books and readers together by helping readers' advisors in libraries, bookstores, and academic institutions find the books their readers will enjoy reading. Offering a structured overview of genres, it can also be used as a textbook for courses in genre literature and readers' advisory to discuss popular genres of fiction. Organization Each chapter covers one of the popular genres. An overview of historical, Western, crime, adventure, romance, science fiction, fantasy, and horror is followed by\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xxi\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xxii\n\nnext page > Page xxii\n\ndescriptions of subgenres. Bibliographies for each subgenre list authors and titles important in the genre because of popularity or influence on the genre. Following the lists of authors and titles in each chapter, a topics section provides information on resources for more in-depth information on specific facets of the genre. The information varies by chapter depending on the specific character of the genre. Generally bibliographies, critical works, and organizations pertaining to the genre are included, but each chapter, like each genre, has unique characteristics. At the end of each chapter is a section called \"D's Picks,\" a personal recommendation by the author. Authors Included Most of the authors included are prolific. It is not uncommon for genre authors to write dozens or even hundreds of books. Some authors are actually house names used by publishers or book packagers to put all titles in a series or sequence under one author, while in other instances the author has actually written all those books. The most amazing recent trend has been for authors to continue publishing for years after death. An example is V. C. Andrews, who is still wildly prolific, publishing four books in 1999, a decade after her death. Of course, another author is writing the books published under her name. Some authors are included who have written only a few novels that have made a tremendous impact on their specific genre or who are relatively new authors who are popular or show marked promise. Titles Included Title listings are not intended to be all-inclusive, but rather exemplary of a writer's work in print near the end of the millennium or available in public library collections. Years Covered The intent of Genreflecting is to identify titles enjoyed by the common reader rather than to provide comprehensive lists of genre fiction published within a certain time frame. Therefore, no specific time range is covered. The focus is on works that are widely available in libraries. Most of the titles were published or reprinted in the 1990s. This edition of Genreflecting features many new authors and titles published since the last edition was released. Entries and Annotations Ideally every title would be annotated, but that would make this guide too large and cumbersome for readers and their advisors to take to the shelves or stacks in search of the next good read. Selected titles are annotated to illustrate the subgenre or type. Most entries list the author and titles that fit into the subgenre under which they are listed. In order to provide as much coverage as possible but still be concise, some entries (particularly in crime, where many of the entries list the author and the detective) list only the author when that author writes primarily within a specific subgenre.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xxii\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xxiii\n\nnext page > Page xxiii\n\nSuggestions for Use There are many different ways to access the information in Genreflecting. Readers' advisors (in libraries and in bookstores) should read through the text and familiarize themselves with the genres and subgenres as well as authors and titles within each. They can also use the book to fill patron requests for fiction read-alikes. Many readers will enjoy using this book on their own. To find specific authors and titles, users can refer to the index. When looking for books similar to a known author or title, the user can check the other listings in the specific subgenre section identified by using the index to find where the known author is listed. The table of contents and the subject index can be used to find information on the genres and subgenres. Scholarly materials and reference sources can be found by consulting the topics section of each chapter. Librarians have also used previous editions of Genreflecting to select titles for displays or for separating genre collections from large general fiction collections.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_xxiii\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_1\n\nnext page > Page 1\n\nChapter 1 Historical\n\n\"What is history but a fable agreed upon?\" Napoleon The allure of the past as it never was is fascinating enough to make even the most reticent individuals express opinions as to which other time period they would have liked to live in. Much historical fiction, and the kind preferred by those who read it as genre fiction, presents a somewhat romanticized, sanitized view of the past. Focusing on the delights of bygone eras, these books make the past seem all the more attractive when compared to the perceived horrors of today. In fact, some definitions of historical fiction require that the settings be in a time before the birth of the author. Other readers, particularly teens, consider anything that happened before they were old enough to remember it an appropriate setting for historical fiction. In this guide historical fiction is considered stories that begin prior to the middle of the twentieth century. Historical fiction offers much diversity, and not all of it will satisfy the common reader of popular fiction. Some is quite literary. Some is quite bleak. The historical fiction included in this guide concentrates on stories with strong plots in which the setting (time and place) also plays a prominent and integral role in the story rather than serving simply as a backdrop. Historical authenticity is not always the ultimate aim. Some works that fall into the genre of literary fiction are included in this chapter because they are titles that the historical genre reader may be familiar with and have an interest in. Popular historical fiction is peopled by romantic heroes and heroines who face adventure and emerge triumphant. It follows the same model of other genre fiction in that a character faces and overcomes adversity. At its best, historical fiction makes the past come to life. It spins intriguing stories around dry dates and facts and imprints them indelibly on the memory. This author managed to score 99 out of 100 on a high school history final exam solely by using the knowledge gained through reading historical fiction as a teen.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_1\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_2\n\nnext page > Page 2\n\nAdvising the Reader Readers of historical fiction often prefer to stay with a specific time period or geographical location. This guide is arranged more or less chronologically and geographically (by setting) to help guide readers to the books they will enjoy. As the popularity of historicals has increased, so has the number of resources related to the genre. Outstanding World Wide Web sites abound and some are listed in the \"Topics\" section of this chapter along with other resources for information about historical fiction. History has become a more important element in other genres; thus readers have turned to historical fiction as a genre in and of itself. It can easily be argued that Westerns, in particular the traditional Westerns that were set between 1865 and 1910, fall into the category of historical fiction, but they also make up a genre of their own. Readers who enjoy the American West as a setting may also want to consult Chapter 2. Historical settings abound in other genres, so they should be checked for the avid reader. Time travel takes readers of fantasy and science fiction into the past. Alternate history in science fiction shows a different view of how things might have been (see Chapter 6). Historical romances are included in the romance chapter (Chapter 5), historical nautical and military adventure are in the adventure chapter (Chapter 4), and the blending of mysteries and historical fiction will be found in the crime chapter (Chapter 3). In addition to consulting the following listings under geographical location, readers should see the sections in this chapter on sagas and epics. Finally, some readers of historical fiction also enjoy nonfiction books about the same events and time periods they enjoy in fiction. Why This Chapter? Previous editions of this guide did not treat historical fiction as a separate genre. However, readers who read historicals are looking for the same thrill, the same sense of the heroic that exists in other genres. Also, as stated above, historical fiction has been growing in popularity. Yes, there are literary historical fiction novels, but that isn't the focus here. This guide only touches on some of the most popular and identifiable areas of historical fiction as a genre. Because of this, some areas seem to be underrepresented. Unfortunately, the bulk of historical fiction read in the United States focuses on U.S. and British settings. It is to be hoped that more popular titles will be forthcoming that will be set in South America, Central America, eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. For most of this century the most visible historical novels were Westerns, which are treated in Chapter 2. Now that \"genre blending\" has become so prevalent, we see historical fiction popping up everywhere. Historical fiction is popular in romance and has established a firm following in science fiction and fantasy through time travel. Many of the titles in the adventure chapter, especially those that deal with daring on the high seas in the time of sail, are also historical fiction. And possibly the most popular kind of historical fiction, outside the romance, is historical mysteries, covered in the crime chapter (Chapter 3).\n\n< previous page\n\npage_2\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_3\n\nnext page > Page 3\n\nBecause the sheer number of historical fiction titles (which would fill several volumes) precludes comprehensive coverage, the titles selected for inclusion in this book are those that have been popular in libraries. Most of them are actual answers to real readers' advisory inquiries, gleaned from years of library information desk duty. Because of this, coverage is not balanced through the eras, although a smattering of different places and times can be found. This chapter is intended to provide a sampling of the historical genre that will be expanded upon in future editions. Themes and Types Historical settings are found in all genres of fiction, from romances, to historical mysteries, to medieval fantasy, to time travel science fiction. The titles in this chapter may have elements of those other genres but the focus is on the historical context. This is a rich and extensive category, and the titles listed are only the tip of the iceberg. The emphasis is on U.S. settings because they seem to be the most published in the United States, followed by British settings. Prehistoric Epics, Ancient Civilizations, and Precontact Native Americans The prehistoric epic has become very popular since the 1980 publication of Jean Auel's Clan of the Cave Bear, the first in her Earth's Children series. Readers want to know what life was like before our civilization and before there was a written record of how society lived. The dawn of humanity's tenure on this planet offers many venues for action-packed adventure and romantic encounters. The settings, drawn from archaeological and anthropological research, provide a distant and romantic arena for the action. Often, even though the settings, costumes, and tools are scientifically correct, the heroine or hero exhibits traits and follows social mores belonging more in the late twentieth century than in prehistoric times. Tales set in ancient civilizations provide a sense of lost wonders and settings that seem more exotic than those in eras with well-documented history. Allan, Margaret Spirits Walking Woman.

Frontiers, whether Australia or the American West or other locales, focus on the clash of \"civilization\" and the taming of the wilderness. The lure of a place far from crowds, jobs, and schools offers instead freedom, danger, and excitement. Readers who like frontier fiction also will often like sagas because many of them deal with families or individuals who move to a new land and how they establish themselves. Many of the books in the Western chapter (Chapter 2) will also be appealing. North America to 1800 Self-reliance and the strength to survive are some of the traits of the characters in this type of book. Man against nature, hewing out a home and livelihood from the wilderness while battling great odds just for survival, is typical. Often conflict arises from \"civilization\" trying to take over the wilderness and end the independence of early settlers. Bristow, Gwen Deep Summer. Celia Garth. South Carolina, American Revolution.

Sagas The saga series, spanning decades or centuries, have been around for a long time but they really took off when a book packager, the late Lyle Engel of Book Creations, started marketing several series that became immensely popular. Sagas and epics are generally lengthier and offer the reader an opportunity to know the families involved and to become immersed in their lives and times. Most involve a great deal of romance as well as adventure. Fans of sagas should also consult the saga sections in the romance and Western chapters (Chapters 5 and 2, respectively).\n\n< previous page\n\npage_17\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_18\n\nnext page > Page 18\n\nAnand, Valerie Bridges over Time.

While some have bemoaned the death of the genre, it is in actuality alive and well, although evolving and appearing under other names. Many publishers are now publishing what would have been called Westerns a decade ago as historical or frontier fiction. Unfortunately, even though many publishers still print classics such as those by Zane Grey or Louis L'Amour as Westerns, and the well-respected Forge imprint continues to label their Westerns as \"Western,\" the term has been more or less expropriated by marketers of softcore porn, who publish series like Lone Star and Long Arm. Betty Rosenberg, the originator of Genreflecting, was a devout fan of Westerns, as evidenced by the detailed coverage of them in earlier editions of this guide. Betty aptly summed up their appeal in the second edition of Genreflecting: The appeal of this genre is worldwide, based in a dream of freedom in a world of unspoiled nature, a world independent of the trammels of restraining society. The hero dominates the western: competent, self-reliant, and self-sufficient, whether in conflict with nature, with man, or with himself. This most enduring of genres appeals to readers of all cultures, even those far removed geographically from the West of the United States, even those to whom its history and life modes are alien. For example, there was a Wild West in Asia in the nineteenth century. Not content with translations of U.S. westerns, the Germans (Karl May in the nineteenth century), Scandinavians, and Britons write their own. Why this universal appeal?\n\n< previous page\n\npage_27\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_28\n\nnext page > Page 28\n\nThe simplest reason may be that it is just a good story, strong on adventure and thrilling action, having readily defined characters, supplying a satisfying resolution of conflicts in terms of simple blacks and whites (good and evil, right and wrongthe black and white Stetson hats of hero and villain), and even supplying a minor plot of romance. Add to this the characters and setting of the West. For example, the motion picture Star Wars, which has been labeled a horse opera in space; its saloon scene is immediately recognized as the classic western movie saloon. The Japanese motion picture The Seven Samurai appealed to fans of the western (not just because of the horses) and was later adapted by Hollywood as an American western. Many of the Westerns found on library and bookstore shelves are decades old, proving the lasting affection of the public for the genre. Because newer titles are seldom published as Westerns, they tend to disappear into the general fiction stacks. Several librarians in public libraries have stated that the population that made Westerns such a beloved genre is dying off. Indeed, that is true for the authors of the traditional type. Browsing the shelves, the reader will find few contemporary authors of traditional Westerns. (An attempt has been made to provide the birth years for authors listed in the \"Topics\" section at the end of this chapter.) Even though the number of authors has drastically declined, and the titles published under the \"Western\" designation have also decreased, novels dealing with the West continue to be published. In 1998 the most popular of the living authors were Larry McMurtry, whose titles are not published as Westerns; Elmer Kelton; and Terry C. Johnston. The Western best-seller lists are dominated by \"dead guys.\" Louis L'Amour titles account for fully 25 percent of Western best sellers on both the Barnes and Noble and Amazon.com best-seller lists. Trevanian, known for his bestselling thrillers still popular after many years, has turned his pen to creating a Western, which may indicate a resurgence in their popularity yet to come. One of the most active areas for publishing of new Westerns is in the young adult and juvenile categories. This may be a clever ploy on the part of Western writers. In an editorial in Roundup, Joan Lowery Nixon wrote of the resurgence of popularity in mysteries a few years after authors in that genre made a concerted effort to attract the young adult and juvenile market and suggested that the same could be done in the Western genre. Unfortunately, the adults who want to read Westerns are not readily finding them if they are shelved in the children's or YA sections of libraries and bookstores. University presses have become active in publishing Westerns, especially those set in their respective states. The evangelical publishers have found the West to be a fertile setting for their historicals, with Bethany House, Crossway, and Multnomah leading the pack. Advising the Reader Many readers of Westerns will find the elements that appeal to them in other works of historical fiction, particularly those with frontier settings. Many novels published for young adults will also appeal to those who like the traditional Westerns.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_28\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_29\n\nnext page > Page 29\n\nReaders who like contemporary Westerns will find some in the crime and romance chapters of this guide (Chapters 3 and 5). Some readers who enjoy the action in Westerns will also enjoy adventure novels (see Chapter 4). Themes and Types Native Americans The history of indigenous peoples has been full of trials and tribulations. The indigenous characters in books and film have historically been portrayed in stereotypical terms, whether the derogatory Tonto model or the \"noble savage.\" The best of the tales about Native peoples are those told with respect. Many deal with the depredations of the invading culture and the conflict between the two groups. Also included here are titles that deal with Indian captives. Some of the older titles unfortunately evidence the stereotypes found in the early days of the genre. Readers may also find many of the titles listed in the \"Prehistoric Epics, Ancient Civilizations, and Precontact Native Americans\" section of the historical fiction chapter (Chapter 1) of interest.
