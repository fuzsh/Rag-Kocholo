I only read a couple of them, but each person had a special talent that ranged from trivial like making firecracker sounds to incredible such as the ability to talk with inanimate objects. Both of these instances are in 'Castle Roogna'.\n\nBut as you mention above doing this is very much a plot tool. In the mentioned book though from the outset the protaganist is know to have this powerful ability and uses it to help advance the plot. I can't remember if it was THE deciding issue but I seem to think not, it just helped in certain difficult spots. I thought Anthony pulled it off ok, though others may disagree.\n\nI am a HUGE fan of Anthony's work, and I do heartily enjoy a witty Xanth novel (though personally I think his Incarnations of Immortality series is MUCH better).\n\nWhat I noticed with Anthony is that he relies on good old fashioned sound principles of story-telling to help him pull off this magic system without making it seem just \"too convenient\" to the plot.\n\n(Note: those who know the story, please do not spoil anything)\n\nWithout giving away too much; in the first Xanth book, \"A Spell for Chameleon\", the lead character Bink met most of the major players early, and readers quickly got familiarized with them. If Bink did not meet them directly, then Anthony utilized \"rumors/urban legends\" of sorts to inform readers of who these *potential* players were, and what they were capable of. So by the time we get to the point where these main/potential characters are forwarding the plot with their own powers, the readers are not surprised and it makes sense. There is never a moment where I stopped and thought \"well, gee, isn't THAT convenient?\"\n\nFurthermore, Anthony spiked the tension by showcasing a lead character with NO talent in a very dangerous magical land, and then showcases an exceptionally *TALENTED* magical character, but sticks him in \"Mundania\" where his magic powers means nothing. All of these devices serve the story (and even FUTURE stories) exceptionally well!\n\nBasically, I want to get everyone's thoughts on magic which, instead of every magic user having the same abilities, acts in a similar way to superpowers where each magic user is unique and possesses one \"main\" ability that others do not. I'm trying to think how this might work in a fantasy setting and how it might be balanced.

Whereas in most fantasy worlds, you just assume that if they're a wizard they can throw fireballs and shoot lightning from their eyes as that's part of what being a wizard is about.\n\nThanks all.\n\nGood discussion point.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I think it's probably important to make sure those abilities and characters are manifested before the struggle of the plot is revealed, especially if those abilities will directly affect that conflict.\n\nI actually really enjoy systems that have that sense of uniqueness. It's popular these days (thanks, Brandon Sanderson! ) as writers to feel like we have to lay out every law of magic, to create a system with rules and requirements, strengths and weaknesses, a defined, rigid order that magic cannot break.\n\nI don't see anything wrong with characters imbued with unique talents, that may be stronger or weaker than others. Not everyone has the same number of life points to assign to their desired features, like a mostly balanced RPG might have. The important part is that those talents aren't tailor-made for a plotline or conflict. Or if they are, there should be something to negate that talent.\n\nNot very good advice, probably. Especially considering that one of my stories, which I considered turning into a longer piece, is held up by that same issue and question.\n\nI've been watching the web series RWBY from RoosterTeeth--only Season 1 is out and all episodes can be found at both the link and on YouTube. American made cgi, heavily influenced by anime (but is it anime?? there seems to be a little question on that--but I'm not asking here!) about people fighting monsters with ridiculously large weapons. I generally don't like animes (or the like) that employ impossibly huge weapons, but I think they do very well with it because they don't take that part of it too seriously as I feel those others do that I don't like. Also very strong characters and storylines that focus on interpersonal relationships between the characters but NOT on romantic relationships. By which I mean it's not about a guy having a dozen girlfriends and trying to manage all of his romantic relationships.\n\nAnyways, it applies here because each character not only has a custom, self designed and created weapon; a general magic that anyone can use; but each also has their own individual power unique to them. So there's speed, control of fire, etc. If anything, it might be worth checking out just to see how they work all of that in and keep it from being completely ridiculous and confusing.\n\nBasically, I want to get everyone's thoughts on magic which, instead of every magic user having the same abilities, acts in a similar way to superpowers where each magic user is unique and possesses one \"main\" ability that others do not.

Whereas in most fantasy worlds, you just assume that if they're a wizard they can throw fireballs and shoot lightning from their eyes as that's part of what being a wizard is about.\n\nThanks all.\n\nWhat you are describing is a talent-based system of magic, which has been used frequently in fantasy fiction. The most popular talent-based systems usually have people divided into groups of talents, rather than lots and lots of different powers. The most popular of the groups ones is the elementals, where you have air powers or earth powers or fire powers or water powers. But you can also have emerging talents stories. That's popular in YA, of course, where somebody finds out what their power is when they hit thirteen, sixteen, eighteen -- and then there's usually one who seems to have not gotten a power but then it turns out the power is super-strong and just was hiding a bit. Witch family ones use this a fair amount.\n\nTalent-based systems of magic actually have more rules than many other systems because the magic users can only do certain things and not others. A version of the talent-based system is a racial system where you have talents based on what sort of creature or lineage you have and often they'll have that but also the exact nature of those talents within your creature/lineage area can vary. Usually the protagonist will have an unusual power not seen for an age.\n\nThere are also bestowed gift magic systems, where characters are given gifts of one power or another by some entity, force or authority, often with duties attached to it."
