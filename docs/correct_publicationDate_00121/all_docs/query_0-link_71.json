        "text": "Piers Anthony is an English-American author of science fiction and fantasy novels. He has written several series, including Xanth, Cluster, Apprentice Adept, Incarnations of Immortality and several others. Before he became an author, Piers spent two years serving in the U.S. Army, edited the battalion’s newspaper and then worked as a public school teacher. He wouldn’t stay teaching for long, though, as he made a deal with his wife to sell a piece within a year or he would give up his dream. Towards the end of the year, Piers was able to sell a short story. Piers lives with his wife on a tree farm in Florida.\n\nPiers Anthony made his debut as a novelist in 1967 with the novel Chthon, which was nominated for the Hugo and Nebula Awards.
