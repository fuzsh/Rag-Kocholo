That comes close to being a frequently asked question.\n\nIn some respects, my answers are going to be very similar to those that\n\nare typically given in response.\n\nPiers Anthony is a writer with a gimmick. Many gimmicks, in fact, and\n\neach book or series he writes is structured around a gimmick of some sort,\n\nmost often a game. The result is typically excellent mind candy, at least\n\nto start, often mixed in with non-trivial ethical or philosophical issues\n\nwhich can challenge the young readers who constitute his primary target\n\naudience. Anthony has the bad habit, unfortunately, of taking the contents\n\nof one excellent novel and stretching them over an entire series -- flogging\n\nthe gimmick-of-the-day until the last bit of life has gone out of it. This\n\nis why he aggravates people so: He hasn't the grace to be an untalented\n\nhack who can just be ignored *or* to write to his potential.\n\nIt's worth thinking of Anthony's career in two parts. Before he hit the\n\njackpot with his 'Xanth' series, he wrote mostly stand-alone novels. They\n\nranged from excellent to execrable. (The worst of the latter were\n\nunpublishable at the time, but have since been printed on the basis of\n\nAnthony's name. Those books often have forewords that say things like \"I\n\nwrote this in 1960 but couldn't sell it until 1990.\" Take those warnings\n\ngratefully to heart.) Since he became a reliable best-seller, stand-alone\n\nnovels have become the exception, and the series novels have become the\n\nrule. He hasn't stopped writing entertaining young-people's fiction: If\n\nyou pick up the first book of almost any of his series, it's likely to be\n\ngood. Trouble is, he then puts that book through more sequel-permutations\n\nthan the book was made to bear. So -- where to start?\n\n\"Macroscope\" (***+ on an uncalibrated four-point scale) is probably his\n\nbest book. The Macroscope itself is the ultimate 'eye', capable of\n\npicking up high-resolution observations from anywhere in the galaxy. A\n\nnumber of extraterrestrial civilizations are already under observation --\n\nand those near Earth's level of development show a distressing tendency to\n\nself-destruct. The Macroscope is also picking up a general broadcast, on\n\nthe band it uses, which appears to carry technical information -- including\n\nthe key to interstellar travel -- but that information is protected by a\n\n'destroyer' sequence which destroys the minds of those with high enough\n\nintelligence to comprehend the technical information. A small group, which\n\nincludes the one person capable of making limited use of the broadcast,\n\nembarks on a search for answers: What is the 'destroyer'? Why is it in\n\nplace? Can the information it shields save Earth from self-destruction?\n\nThe book bubbles with ideas. The *author* bubbles with ideas, and wants\n\nto share them with us, often at great length. Reading \"Macroscope\" is\n\nlike being shown through a child's collection of gems, bottle-tops, and\n\nother shiny objects found on the beach: Word puzzles, ecological collapse,\n\nmathematical games, racism, astrology, the nature of genius, and more --\n\nthe elements are interesting and thought-provoking, but it often feels as\n\nif Anthony included anything that happened to interest him that day. The\n\ncharacters are shallow and obsessive -- a problem Anthony's never licked\n\n-- and play idiotic games for absurdly high stakes. The story keeps\n\ntaking time out for little psychodramas, apparently for no better reason\n\nthan that the author likes writing them. And yet... and yet, there is\n\nsomething engaging about this book bubbling over with ideas faster than\n\nthe author can put them on paper.\n\nA relatively early work (1969) \"Macroscope\" hasn't aged as gracefully as\n\nit might have, but Anthony's strengths and weaknesses show clearly. At\n\nthe time, the book signalled great potential. An author who could build\n\non those strengths and overcome those weaknesses could produce wonderful\n\nbooks. Now, a quarter of a century later, little has changed. Replace\n\n\"Macroscope\" with another title and change the list of shiny objects, and the\n\npreceding paragraph can be applied to most anything Anthony's written since.\n\n\"A Spell for Chameleon\" (***) is the first book in the 'Xanth' series,\n\nthat made Anthony's fortune. If most of Anthony's books are mind candy,\n\nthe 'Xanth' novels are spun sugar -- light, airy, and almost content-free.\n\nXanth in a magical land. No, not in the sense that there's a lot of\n\nmagic, but in the sense that *everything* is magic. It's a land of dragons\n\nand harpies and giants and demons. It's a land where shoes grow on shoe\n\ntrees and butter comes from butterflies and everyone is born with a magic\n\npower. Everyone except Bink, that is, who's about to be exiled from Xanth\n\nas a result. Bink's search for magic takes him first to the castle of the\n\nGood Magician -- who is able to verify that he does have a powerful magic,\n\nbut one that is hidden -- and then into the path of an invading army led\n\nby a previously exiled Evil Magician.\n\n\"A Spell for Chameleon\" is cute, light-weight, and fun -- particularly if\n\nyou don't mind bad puns and characters who are seldom more than extensions\n\nof their talents. The series has run to many sequels. The first couple,\n\n\"The Source of Magic\" and \"Castle Roogna\" are better than the ones that\n\nfollow, as each book in the series seems to lean more heavily on bad puns\n\nthan the previous one. The most frequently asked question about Anthony's\n\nbooks is which Xanth novels to read, and the answer that is almost always\n\ngiven is to read until they stop being fun and then to stop -- because\n\nthey're not going to get better. (Anthony's series generally decline, but\n\nthe Xanth series has run long enough for the decline to be particularly\n\nvisible.) One other word of warning: Piers Anthony's handling of relations\n\nbetween the sexes generally puts me in mind of a twelve-year-old peeking up\n\ngirls' dresses, but nowhere is this more pronounced than in the Xanth novels.\n\nOther Major Series:\n\n\"On a Pale Horse\" (***) is the first book in the series \"Incarnations of\n\nImmortality.\" It's placed in an Earth much like our own, except that\n\nmagic coexists with science, and the Earth is a battleground between Heaven\n\nand Hell. Between God and the Devil are the five Incarnations -- once-human\n\nmanifestations of Death, Time, War, Fate, and Nature. Neutral in principle,\n\nthey often oppose the Devil in practice. When Zane's time comes to die,\n\nDeath comes for him -- and winds up taking the bullet meant for Zane. By\n\nthe 'rules', Zane gets the job and becomes the new Death -- and the Devil\n\ntakes advantage of his lack of experience to further a scheme meant to\n\ngive Hell control of the Earth. Each sequel tells the story of a different\n\nIncarnation. As is typical, the series goes downhill after a promising start.\n\n\"Split Infinity\" (***) is the first of three -- and ultimately seven --\n\nbooks in the \"Apprentice Adept\" sf/fantasy series. Proton is a fabulously\n\nrich planet whose Citizens are served by 'serfs' -- people from other worlds\n\nwho are happy to take long-term contracts as almost-property for extremely\n\nhigh pay. The chief recreation on Proton is \"the Game\" -- a complex\n\ncompetitive framework which supplies most of the digressions in the series.\n\nPhaze is a parallel world in which magic replaces science. The murder of\n\nthe Blue Adept, one of the most powerful mages of Phaze, enables Stile,\n\nhis Proton analogue and one of the foremost Game players, to enter Phaze\n\nand take his place. As an adept on Phaze and as a major Game competitor\n\non Proton, he battles what turn out to be related dangers.\n\n\"Sos the Rope\" (***) begins one of Anthony's earliest series, the \"Battle\n\nCircle\" trilogy. In a post-holocaust future, men wander around duelling\n\nwith primitive weapons, or settle into small tribes whose leadership is\n\ndetermined by this code duello. (Women function primarily as camp followers.)\n\nThis 'idyll' is shattered when Sol and Sos -- respectively an unbeatable\n\nwarrior and a thinker -- join forces and begin to create an empire.\n\n\"Refugee\" (**) begins the five-volume \"Bio of a Space Tyrant\" -- a novel\n\nof contemporary politics, artificially placed in a science-fictional setting.\n\nAnthony's political prescriptions follow the rather corrupt tradition of\n\n\"Here is what I would do if I were President *and* had dictatorial powers.\"\n\nThe \"Cluster\" series -- a trilogy beginning with \"Cluster\" (**) and two\n\nstand-alone novels -- is placed in a future in which interstellar travel\n\nis expensive, but it is practical to interact with other worlds by projecting\n\none's personality into a host -- if one has a strong enough Kirlian aura.\n\nEach book in the trilogy has a different character with an exceptionally\n\npowerful aura serving as a key player in an intergalactic struggle. A\n\nprequel -- the \"Tarot\" trilogy -- is probably better thought of.\n\nA number of Anthony's stand-alone novels are worth at least mentioning.\n\n\"Triple Detente\" (***) is structured around the question of how to make\n\ngood government and self-interest congruent -- and begins when Earth and\n\nanother world...conquer each other. \"Prostho Plus\" (***) is silly fun:\n\nA dentist (a prosthodontist, actually) is kidnapped by a space alien with\n\na toothache, and finds himself being passed from planet to planet in a\n\nnever-ending battle against interstellar tooth decay. Steppe (**+) is\n\nessentially a retelling of the history of Genghis Khan, within the context\n\nof a futuristic role-playing game.\n\nAnthony has also coauthored many novels, mostly with mediocre results.\n\nAmong these is his recent and unlikely collaboration with Mercedes Lackey,\n\ntitled \"If I Pay Thee Not in Gold\" (**). I came away from this book with\n\nthe impression that Lackey had done the word-smithing (which is better\n\nthan Anthony's usual) while adhering to a fairly generic Piers Anthony plot\n\noutline. The result is a book for Anthony fans, not for Lackey fans.\n\nComments and Recommendations: If you're looking for books that are\n\nthoughtful and thought-provoking, with plausible characters facing\n\nmeaningful challenges, don't waste your time with Piers Anthony. If\n\nyou're looking for trash, and aren't put off by a few stylistic quirks --\n\nincluding shallow characterization, a juvenile attitude towards women,\n\nobsessive patterning of the story, and a tendency for characters to\n\ndetermine the fate of the galaxy by challenging each other to a game of\n\nmonopoly or such like -- Anthony writes *good* trash. Bear in mind that\n\nthese books are written primarily for younger readers, and written down,\n\nat that: The ethical dimension of Anthony's writing is pronounced, but\n\nit's shallow and simplistic.\n\nNone of which means that you won't enjoy his books. Millions do. I do.\n\nSometimes. The important rule to remember is to start at the beginning of\n\na series, and not to expect a declining series to get better. I haven't\n\ntried to be exhaustive in listing Anthony's novels -- or even in listing\n\nhis series. It's more useful to think of Piers Anthony's books as a\n\ncommodity, in the sense that a Harlequin romance is a commodity: The\n\nquestion isn't \"which are the good ones?\" so much as \"do I feel like\n\nreading one?\" One of his books is about as good as another for answering\n\nthat question.\n\nDisclaimer: Don't think of this as a review series. It's just unnumbered\n\nto help me keep track.\n\n%A Anthony, Piers\n\n%T Macroscope\n\n%S The Xanth Series\n\n%S Incarnations of Immortality\n\n%S The Apprentice Adept\n\n%S Battle Circle\n\n%S Bio of a Space Tyrant\n\n%S Cluster\n\n%T Triple Detente\n\n%T Prostho Plus\n\n%T Steppe\n\n%T If I Pay Thee Not in Gold\n\n%O The last coauthored with Mercedes Lackey\n\n-----\n\nDani Zweig\n\nda...@netcom.com\n\nIf you're going to write, don't pretend to write down.
