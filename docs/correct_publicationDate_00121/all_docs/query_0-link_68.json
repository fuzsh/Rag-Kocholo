Rodriguez—This collaboration is a different one for Piers Anthony. He crafted an original short story based on the character Cartaphilus from the creator-owned Starkweather comic book series by David A. Rodriguez. This short story was then adapted into a comic book script and painted by fantasy artist Patrick McEvoy and published by Archaia Studios, making Starkweather: Immortal issue 0, Piers Anthony's first true comic book work.\n\nTortoise Reform[1] (2007)\n\nThe Sopaths (2011)\n\nEroma (2011)\n\nWriter's Retweet (2016) from Dreaming Big Publications\n\nCaptive (2016) from eXcessica Publishing\n\nJack and the Giants (2014) with J.
