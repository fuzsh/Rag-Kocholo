        "text": "G. Kevin Wilson \"Whizzard\"\n\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR From: \"Christopher E. Forman\" (ceforma@rs6000.cmp.ilstu.edu)\n\nDear SPAG, What follows is something I've been mulling over for several days now, something I think should be heard by everyone involved in playing and/or writing text adventures.\n\nThe I-F medium should serve to provide a two-way street for the facilitation of communication between players and authors. Players should feel free to discuss how they think I-F should be, authors need to be able to draw on that discussion when writing their own works, and players need to give feedback (both positive and -- pardon the gratuitous euphamism -- \"otherwise\") to those authors informing them of how closely their work exhibits the qualities players feel are inherent and necessary in I-F.\n\nUnfortunately, the last of these three basic needs appears, to myself anyway, to be largely unfulfilled. In short, I just haven't been receiving the quantity or quality of feedback I'd like to get regarding my work, and I suspect that many other authors have experienced the same problem. Oh, there's the occasional \"this is a really great game\" post on UseNet, but, aside from requests for hints, that's all I ever see. While such statements are nice to hear, they tend to lack specific details about just what it is that the player thinks is \"really great\".\n\nI bring this to the attention of players because about a week ago, I discovered in my e-mailbox a lengthy, extremely well-written evaluation of my work, revealing what one player found favorable about it, and, more importantly, a number of aspects he rather disliked. This was a revelation to me, as he'd made some excellent points I'd never considered when coding the game, and it gave me something to really think about. Although I did disagree with a few of his statements, and found some others too time- consuming to be implemented at the present, I most certainly plan to take everything he said into account to at least some degree over the course of future projects.\n\nThe point of all this is that, believe it or not, game authors will listen to your comments. They want to hear them. They need to hear them. Heck, they DESERVE to hear them. Writing a text game means setting aside a lot of time and taking a lot of effort to give computerists a little fun. So the next time you play through a game, if it made any sort of impression on you at all, take ten or fifteen minutes out of your own life to let the author know what you think of his/her creation. Anything -- positive, negative, or both -- on any topic -- writing, plot, puzzles, characters, etc. -- will be appreciated. If you don't tell us what pleases you and what doesn't, how can we be expected to find out? While we may not agree on everything (differences of opinion are inevitable within any entertainment medium), it's encouraging to see just what those differences are.\n\nAs a final note, don't let shareware games scare you away from such a practice. I suspect that many shareware authors suffer a lack of feedback because players don't want to feel obligated to register, and admitting that they've finished the game invites such feelings of duty. I'm of the belief that one should only pay the registration fees if one deems the game worthy of such a price (although my shameless UseNet promotions may seem to indicate otherwise B-). Most shareware authors are not going to pressure you into paying for their games just because you've admitted you've played them. While receiving a little extra cash from a game is nice, there's more to writing I-F than that.\n\nWith a little help, authors should be able to create games that not only merit but encourage intelligent discussion everywhere. SPAG and UseNet can help, but they can't do it alone. That little help also has to come through direct feedback from the playing public itself.\n\n-- C.E. Forman\n\nKEY TO SCORES AND REVIEWS Consider the following review header:\n\nNAME: Cutthroats PARSER: Infocom Standard AUTHOR: Infocom PLOT: Two Seperate Paths EMAIL: ??? ATMOSPHERE: Well Done AVAILABILITY: LTOI 2 WRITING: Good PUZZLES: Good SUPPORTS: Infocom Ports CHARACTERS: Not Bad DIFFICULTY: Medium\n\nFirst, you'll notice that the score has been removed, and replaced by one or two word ratings. These are pretty arbitrary, and should allow more freedom to the reviewers. The EMAIL section is for the e-mail address of the game author, not the reviewer. AVAILABILITY will usually have either Commercial ($price), Shareware ($price), or Freeware. If the commercial price varies in stores, then it will just say Commercial. If it has been released in the LTOI collection, this line should say so. Lastly, if it is available on ftp.gmd.de, the line should add GMD. (Demo) if it's a demo version. The body of the review hasn't changed.\n\nWhen submitting reviews: Try to fill in as much of this info as you can. Also, scores are still desired along with the reviews, so send those along. The scores will be used in the ratings section. Authors may not rate or review their own games.\n\nSPAG accepts reviews of any length, letters to the editor, the occasional interesting article on text adventures (no reprints please), and even just ratings for your favorite game, if you don't have the time to do a full review. Please though, at least send me info for each game you have rated equivalent to the review header for Cutthroats, above. All accepted materials will be headed by the submitter's name and e-mail address, unless you request that they be withheld, or do not supply them, in which case the header will read as \"Anonymous.\"\n\nNEW GAMES The only game out of the three that I mentioned in my editorial that could vaguely be referred to as new at this late date is _The Broken String_. I have seen the game, and in my opinion, the potential is there, but the authors did not go the extra mile. They needed more betatesting, a native english-speaking editor (The authors themselves are not.) and some careful polish. It is also a tad crude at the beginning. But hey, it's a punk adventure, so some crude is permissible there. I simply question the neccessity of it. I suggest waiting for a future release, but at last count, it was found at ftp.gmd.de:/if-archive/unprocessed/gamebs.zip. REVIEWS\n\nFrom \"Graeme Cree\" (72630.304@compuserve.com) NAME: Adventure GAMEPLAY: Two Word parser AUTHOR: Will Crowther PLOT: Good EMAIL: I wish I knew ATMOSPHERE: Tolkienic AVAILABILITY: GMD WRITING: Very Good PUZZLES: Many trial & error SUPPORTS: Practically all CHARACTERS: Few, but memorable DIFFICULTY: Average\n\nAdventure, aka Colossal Cave, is the oldest, most famous, most modified, most ported, and most pirated game in the history of Interactive Fiction. Written in the antiquity of the mid 70's, it was bootlegged to practically every university in the country on magnetic tape. It was commercially released by several companies (such as The Software Toolworks), and has been ported to AGT, TADS, Inform, and several others.\n\nIt has also been expanded several times. Many authors have taken the layout of the original game and simply added new rooms, items, and puzzles. For this reason, the game is usually referred to by the maximum number of points that can be scored. For instance Adventure 350 (the original version), Adventure 370, Adventure 550, Adventure 1000, and so on.\n\nAdventure could also be said to be indirectly responsible for the entire Infocom product line. The original mainframe Zork was begun when the authors played Adventure and believed that they could improve on it, especially vis a vis the parser. Zork, the product of their efforts, was the foundation of Infocom, and owes heavily to Adventure. The words \"xyzzy\" and \"plugh\" will draw a response, and the thief's maze is lifted directly from the game.\n\nAll in all, one might conclude from this that Adventure is the greatest Adventure game ever written, but this is not quite the case. It's continued popularity stems from a) it's hauntingly compelling atmosphere, b) it's colourful imagery, c) the fact that for many it was their first adventure game, and d) the fact that many people first played it 70's style.\n\nPlaying a game 70's style was very different from playing today. Since there were few personal computers, playing a game usually involved a trip to the local university computer room, generally after hours, with a bag lunch in tow (since the session would usually last quite a while). My own first experience with Adventure involved late-night trips to IBM with my programmer father. The long trek through dimly-lit windowless corridors to the terminal room was practically an adventure in itself, and since you couldn't just go and play whenever you wanted to, the game had plenty of opportunity to grow larger in the imagination in between sessions.\n\nAlso, a player is more likely to be forgiving of a first game than later ones. When you have never seen such a game before and are not quite sure what it can understand or do, you won't mind a simple two-word parser, such as Adventure has, unless it is positively user-unfriendly. Adventure's parser while simple, is adequate for the game, and produces a good effect by frequently addressing the user directly (\"You don't expect me to do a decent reincarnation without any orange smoke, do you?\").\n\nAdventure is loaded with memorable imagery (Witt's End, the maze of twisty little passages, the Pirate, the breath-taking view, \"xyzzy\", et cetera) that generally stays with a player long after the game is completed.\n\nThe atmosphere is wonderfully authentic. The game map was based on Bedquilt Cave in Kentucky, part of the Mammoth Cave labyrinth. While there are no dragons in Bedquilt, it is said that first-time visitors have been able to find their way around by virtue of having played the game. While Zork is simply a collection of interesting locales that just happen to be underground, Adventure resembles a real cavern much more, featuring dead ends, fissures, blocked passages, and passages in the floor. As in Tolkien, magic in Adventure is present, but tantalizingly remote; not coming out the wazoo, as it is in Zork and most other fantasy games.\n\nNevertheless Adventure is not without its problems. As mentioned previously, the parser is rather primitive, at least in the original version (the TADS and Inform ports have state-of-the-art parsers).\n\nAlso the puzzles are frequently meant to be solved by trial and error rather than deduction. How are you supposed to figure out what to do with the rod, or how to kill the dragon, or how to bring light to the Dark Room, or how to recover the Golden Eggs, or how to get that final point, anyway? By experimenting, that's how. Of course, in a first game players are often much more inclined to experiment with it to discover its capabilities.\n\nThat's not to say that there aren't some good puzzles as well. The object that you need to win at the end is very cleverly concealed, and only the keen-eyed will detect the subtle difference between the vending machine maze and the Pirate's maze that allows you to map the former without dropping objects (unfortunately, this feature is not present in the Inform version).\n\nThere are no save/restore puzzles as such. It is possible to win on the first playthrough, but not to achieve the maximum score. If you take too long (and you will), you will be forced to expend one of your treasures to recharge your lamp (thus lowering your score), but after you have solved the game, it will be a simple matter to optimize your time and win before this becomes necessary.\n\nAdventure is an adventure game that every text gamer should play some time in their lives; the only game that has a genre named after it. But it would be best to stick with Adventure 350 in either its original form, or the TADS or Inform ports. The add-ons of the larger versions simply make the game bulkier and clunkier without improving the gaming experience.\n\nFrom: \"Christopher E. Forman\" (ceforma@rs6000.cmp.ilstu.edu) NAME: The Awe-Chasm (a.k.a The Chasm of Awe, a.k.a. Snatch and Crunch II) PARSER: C Adventure Toolkit AUTHOR: Tony Stiles PLOT: Dungeon Quest EMAIL: ??? ATMOSPHERE: Very little AVAILABILITY: Freeware, GMD WRITING: Decidedly unfunny PUZZLES: Generic/pseudo-logical SUPPORTS: PCs, Atari STs CHARACTERS: Unresponsive DIFFICULTY: Painful to play\n\nStart with a rather straightforward late-1970s style dungeon quest/treasure hunt. Now add a remarkably crude and unpretentiously juvenile sense of humor. Stir in a frustrating parser and some poorly-implemented, at best semi-logical, puzzles. Blend into this a sloppy overall design, and, to give a slight flavor of anti-logic, top the whole thing off with a dash of sheer incomprehensibility. Following this recipe, the resulting mixture is a serious candidate for the very worst text adventure ever written.\n\nIn this case, author Tony Stiles has cooked up an unappetizing little dish titled \"The Awe-Chasm\", a.k.a \"The Chasm of Awe\", a.k.a. \"Snatch and Crunch II\". (Personally, I've never seen or heard of \"Snatch and Crunch I\", but it must have been good enough to justify the making of this sequel.)\n\nSnatch and Crunch, the two main characters in this game, are, in the author's own words, a \"pokey pervert\" and a \"monolithic mutant\", respectively. For reasons unknown (good old-fashioned greed perhaps?), they're out to explore the many caverns and passageways of the Awe-Chasm in search of treasure. During the course of the game, the I-Fer can type \"BECOME SNATCH\" or \"BECOME CRUNCH\" to switch control back and forth between Snatch and Crunch, using each one in tasks for which he is specifically suited -- some puzzles can only be solved using one of our two explorers. Snatch and Crunch can also work together, with Crunch picking up the smaller Snatch and carrying him along on his shoulders.\n\nWhile this may sound promising, the game doesn't really put forth the extra effort necessary to make it work. Neither Snatch nor Crunch seems to have much personality, so it's hard to figure out who can do what unless the game specifically tells you (which, in most cases, it doesn't). Perhaps the player is expected to bring this knowledge over from the first \"Snatch and Crunch\" game. Further, unless Snatch is being carried, the duo doesn't move around together -- the player must move Snatch and Crunch individually, and having to retrace your steps is tedious. It would have worked much better to have the pair stay together for the most part, providing a special \"SPLIT\" command for the few times when they need to go their separate ways.\n\nComplicating matters is the sloppy overall design of the game. It's very linear at the start, until the player figures out how to buy a lamp. This had me stuck until I stumbled across a walkthrough of the first few puzzles amongst the myriad seemingly useless files zipped in with the game executable. My problems were more due to parser quirks than anything else. Did I talk about the parser yet? Perhaps I should do that now.\n\nThe author wrote his own adventure design system, called the \"C Adventure Toolkit\" to create this game. While I must bow slightly to such an impressive feat, the sad truth of the matter is that the parser just isn't very good -- it's barely adequate for the game. There are very few synonyms for nouns -- you can't call a pond a \"lake\", for instance -- and some commands only work properly if prepositions are used -- \"GET EMILY\" fails; you must say \"GET EMILY FROM POND\". (Emily, in this case, happens to be a fish with whom Crunch, the \"monolithic mutant\" is infatuated, and...oh, just forget it.) For simple interactions (directional moves, two-word commands, etc.) the parser works okay. For longer, more complex sentences, though, it's not even up to the standards of AGT, let alone Inform and TADS. (It's dated 1989, BTW.)\n\nBut now back to the game, which becomes more frustrating once the player acquires a lamp and descends into the Awe-Chasm (\"a chasm of orgasmic proportions\", the game shamelessly announces). There are several levels to the chasm, some of which have openings leading to tunnels. What's particularly noteworthy here is that, when climbing between levels, there's a good chance you'll fall to the bottom of the chasm and have to climb back up several levels again. This happens far, FAR too often to even be called infuriating. After five or six times, you'll want to quit right then and there. (I didn't even get a quarter of the way through the 500-point game.)\n\nThe tunnel openings themselves are equally frustrating to navigate. They are listed in room descriptions as \"an opening\", but no compass directions for them are given or recognized. Players must type \"ENTER OPENING\" to go inside, and \"ENTER OPENING\" again to come back. Doors must be traversed in the same manner. What's so difficult about allowing directional commands?\n\n\"The Awe-Chasm\" showcases an astoundingly juvenile sense of humor. It almost seems as though the author is attempting to imitate the style used by Steve Meretzky in some of his racier titles. But Meretzky's writing exudes personality, and his characterization in \"LGOP\" and the \"SpellCasting\" series makes the \"naughty\" bits more charming than offensive. \"Awe-Chasm\"'s writing offers little characterization and little personality, and the overall result is decidedly distasteful.\n\nOn top of all this, the game just isn't very well planned out. The best dungeon adventures (by which I mean \"Colossal Cave\" and the \"Zork\" series) employ a degree of continuity between their locations, adding realism to the layout. In \"Awe-Chasm\", rooms are slapped together clumsily and objects are thrown about with no thought whatsoever. One tunnel, for instance, harbors a band of sex-starved nymphomaniacs to assault our heroes. Yet for some reason, they've never ventured into the throne room a few levels down to visit King Tony (another personal appearance by a game author degenerating into a very tired and unfunny inside joke). Other thrills and chills awaiting you include a slew of locked doors (at least three more than ANY adventure game needs), the \"magical mystery maze\" (three guesses as to what this is, and the first two don't count), and the \"Oh sh*t, all my treasures have been scattered\" room (crusaders for fairness in I-F need not apply).\n\nThe game is not without its cult value, however. Fans of truly abysmal I-F should get plenty of howls out of the flaws inherent in \"The Awe-Chasm\", but everyone else is better advised to leave the \"monolithic mutant\" and the \"pokey pervert\" to fend for themselves.\n\n(Both versions are packaged in the same .ZIP file, at /if-archive/games/pc/awechasm.zip)\n\nFrom \"Gareth Rees\" (Gareth.Rees@cl.cam.ac.uk) NAME: A Change in the Weather PARSER: Inform's usual AUTHOR: Andrew Plotkin PLOT: Highly branching EMAIL: erkyrath+@cmu.edu ATMOSPHERE: Good AVAILABILITY: Freeware, GMD WRITING: Excellent PUZZLES: Very neat, very clever SUPPORTS: Inform ports CHARACTERS: None DIFFICULTY: Hard\n\nMy second favourite of the competition games, after \"The One that Got Away\". This was a fun experiment and a deserved winner of the Inform category. I found it very challenging, but it wasn't outright impossible (unlike one or two of the other games in the competition), so I think the difficulty was well-judged. Three aspects of \"A Change in the Weather\" were excellent: the quality of the writing, the changing descriptions of the scenery, and the way the components of the puzzle interacted. I was reminded of my decision in \"Christminster\" to keep the player indoors from seven p.m. until ten so that I didn't have to write descriptions of the sun going down! Andrew Plotkin tackled this problem head on and the result was very impressive.\n\nWhat I didn't like was the very short time limit and the way it was incredibly easy to get stuck. To finish \"A Change in the Weather\" required an enormous amount of patience: going back to a saved game, trying something new, observing the consequences, going back again and trying something else, and on and on. The puzzles themselves were quite elegant, but I didn't appreciate them very much because I was a bit fatigued by the process of solving them. I also felt the game lacked for NPCs (the fox was better than nothing), and the dream was just willfully obscure.\n\nFrom \"Gareth Rees\" (Gareth.Rees@cl.cam.ac.uk) NAME: Detective PARSER: Inform usual AUTHOR: Christopher Forman PLOT: None EMAIL: ceforma@rs6000.cmp.ilstu.edu ATMOSPHERE: Unusual AVAILABILITY: Freeware, GMD WRITING: New material is good PUZZLES: None SUPPORTS: Inform ports CHARACTERS: Unoriginal, but good DIFFICULTY: Trivial\n\nI'm only aware of \"Mystery Science Theatre 3000\" through the genre of MST3k parodies on Usenet, so I have no idea how faithfully Christopher Forman reproduced the flavour of the television program. I thought that this game was interesting as an experiment, and I did find bits of it funny, but a lot of it was completely meaningless to me, especially the introduction and the endgame, and I probably wouldn't play another similar game.\n\nI'm not sure at all that text adventure games are suitable for this kind of parody by ridicule, and especially free or shareware games produced by amateurs. Bad films are interesting targets for ridicule because they are the result of the labours of intelligent adults who should have known better, and because millions of dollars were wasted on their production. On the other hand, \"Detective\" was probably the result of a couple of hours' work by a twelve-year-old kid, whose main mistake was to upload it to a bulletin board for the world to laugh at (although the adventure games I wrote when I was twelve were better than \"Detective\", I have more sense than to let anyone see them now!). Activision's expensive multimedia game \"Return to Zork\", with live actors pretending to be characters from an adventure game, would be a much more appropriate (though also much more challenging) target.\n\nI think that parody of adventure games is very tricky to do well, because most adventure games sit rather uneasily on the dividing line between seriousness and humour, and generally incorporate elements of self-parody already (think of the ongoing Flathead jokes in the \"Zork\" series, or the ridiculous names of the spells in \"Enchanter\" et al), whereas parody succeeds best when its target is relentlessly humourless (think of \"A Modest Proposal\" by Swift or \"The Pooh Perplex\" by F.C.Crews). There are some supposed parodies of Infocom games at the IF-archive (\"Pork\" and \"Disenchanted\"), but they end up being pastiche rather than parody or satire, and rather weak pastiches at that.\n\nFrom \"Graeme Cree\" (72630.304@compuserve.com) NAME: DETECTIVE: An Interactive MiSTing GAMEPLAY: Inform Parser AUTHOR: C. E. Forman PLOT: Trivial EMAIL: ceforma@rs6000.cmp.ilstu.edu ATMOSPHERE: Demented AVAILABILITY: GMD incoming WRITING: Pathetic PUZZLES: None SUPPORTS: All Inform Ports CHARACTERS: Cardboard DIFFICULTY: None at all\n\nNormally, looking at the above category descriptions (such as \"Trivial\", \"Demented\", and \"Pathetic\") one would expect a pretty bad game. Yet, such is not the case here. In the zany world of Mystery Science Theater 3000, (MST3K for short) where schlock is fun, and all involved want \"More cheese, please\", such descriptions denote an excellent game. Detective, the game least likely to be ported now exists (with enhancements) for Inform.\n\nA little background is in order to understand this game. SPAG #4 featured a review of an AGT game called Detective, which stated that the author had made every possible mistake, and that the game should be avoided. In SPAG #5 I wrote a second review in which I stated that the game, though awful, was in fact loaded with unintentional laughs and bizarre incongruities that were sure to entertain the player, and that the game would make an excellent episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.\n\nFor those who don't know, MST3K is a cable television show (soon to be a major motion picture) on Comedy Central, that involves a man shot into space by two mad scientists and forced to watch bad movies so that his reactions can be monitored. Throughout the movie we can see the silhouettes of Mike and his robot companions (whose outer casings are made out of things like a gumball machine, a bowling pin, and a lacrosse helmet) at the lower right-hand corner of the screen, and hear them deliver a barrage of sarcastic remarks, pop-culture references, and suggestive dialogue. For example in \"Godzilla vs. Megalon\", a close-up of Godzilla waving his arms and bellowing drew the response \"I am Kirok!!\", a reference to a classic bit of Shatner overacting in Star Trek's \"The Paradise Syndrome\" episode. In \"Marooned\", when three astronauts, stranded in space are arguing over who will leave the ship (there was only enough oxygen to sustain two until the rescue ship arrived) one of the robots observed \"they could toss a coin, but it would never come down.\"\n\nThe show is in its 7th season, and each episode is two hours long. Their bread-and-butter is schlocky sci-fi movies, but they have hit almost every genre, including the occasional biker movie. Before and after the show, as well as during intermissions, they do short amusing skits, often based on scenes from the movie.\n\nChris Forman has taken this format and adapted it into a text game, almost seamlessly. The original Detective game has been transferred verbatim to Inform, even retaining the AGT default responses, and snappy responses from Mike and the robots have been inserted everywhere; into room descriptions, item descriptions, response descriptions, et cetera. Repetition is avoided, enhancing believability. The first time you enter a room you get one set of responses. The second time you will get either a different set, or none at all. The jokes are generally top quality, turning an already (unintentionally) amusing game into a laugh riot. The level of imitation is flawless; if you have seen the show, you can almost hear the dialogue coming out of the actors' mouths.\n\nA typical MST3K episode features a short skit and an invention exchange with the mad scientists before the movie actually begins. Mr. Forman has represented this by including a special introductory text file that highlights the robots attempting to write their own text games, and Dr. Forrester's \"fictionary\", a device that inputs the vocabulary of a text game directly into the player's mind, with hilarious results.\n\nThe only thing that could put anyone off about this game might be found in Stefan Jokisch's original SPAG #4 review: \"we should not forget that Matt [the original author of Detective] wrote this game with good intentions and he offered it for free, so who are we to mock at his efforts?\" Matt Barringer's game is \"mocked\" here, but previous MST3K episodes have had movies featuring the likes of Gregory Peck, Gene Hackman, Linda Evans, Peter Graves, James Earl Jones, and Bela Lugosi, putting Mr. Barringer in very august company indeed.\n\nThis may not be my all-time favourite text adventure, but it is one of the few that I would recommend to absolutely everyone.\n\nFrom: \"Christopher E. Forman\" (ceforma@rs6000.cmp.ilstu.edu) NAME: Jigsaw PARSER: Expanded Inform AUTHOR: Graham Nelson PLOT: Complex and entertaining EMAIL: nelson@vax.ox.uk ATMOSPHERE: Excellent AVAILABILITY: Freeware, GMD WRITING: Stylish & imaginative (.Z5 and .Z8 versions) SUPPORTS: Infocom ports PUZZLES: Varying, clever & logical DIFFICULTY: Hard CHARACTERS: Accurate but primarily underdeveloped\n\nThe turn-of-the-millennium party at Century Park is something of a letdown, with little to do but run out the clock and, ultimately, let yourself succumb to the festive spirit that's already claimed all the other partygoers. Unless, of course, you found something else to take your attention away from it all. Something like a time machine, perhaps?\n\n\"Jigsaw,\" the latest wonder from Graham Nelson (\"Inform\" and \"Curses\", for those of you who've been in comas for the last three years) promises to be every bit as fascinating a diversion as his previous works. As players jump back and forth through twentieth-century history, they discover pieces to complete the aforementioned time machine, which is in actuality a large jigsaw board. In that respect, \"Jigsaw\" really _is_ a large puzzle to be solved by the player.\n\nEach of the sixteen timeplaces houses a critical event that needs to be resolved so that history as we know it can proceed. Solving an area means you must determine where you are, figure out the critical event that's about to take place, take action to ensure that it happens as history tells you it did, and escape back through time to the jigsaw board.\n\nComplicating matters is a mysterious stranger in black, whom you recognize from the party, alternately hindering and (sometimes seemingly inexplicably) helping you. As the game progresses, a relationship develops between yourself and \"Black,\" whose intentional lack of a specified gender sparked a brush-fire of discussion across r.g.i-f in the weeks following the release of \"Jigsaw.\"\n\nComparisons to Nelson's previous work is inevitable. \"Jigsaw\" stacks up very well to \"Curses,\" although IMHO, it's not quite as extravagant as the popular attic search. Perhaps this is because \"Curses\" was released during a severe I-F drought, and its superior parser and excellent gameplay immediately astounded players. There was nothing out there even remotely close to it at the time. Now that the shortage is comfortably over, \"Jigsaw\" suffers a little.\n\nDon't get me wrong, though. It's still one of the very best games out there, and it does manage to overcome the (few) problems \"Curses\" had. For instance, the jigsaw board gives the game's layout a more structured feel, whereas the whole of \"Curses\" always seemed slightly fractured and incoherent, with several seemingly unrelated puzzles simply thrown together (again, only my opinion). And whereas \"Curses\" took awhile for me to really get into, \"Jigsaw\" drew me in right away with the powerful first meeting between White (as the player is referred to) and Black, in Sarajevo.\n\nVirtually all of the timeplaces are self-contained and require no outside information to solve, but this doesn't make the game any less challenging. Some of the puzzles here are very, very hard -- the ghost plane, the moon, and the Enigma machine were particularly taxing. Everything has a satisfying, logical solution to it, and the clues aren't buried quite as deeply as in \"Curses,\" although you still need to examine everything.\n\nAnother game to compare \"Jigsaw\" to would be Legend Entertainment's cult classic \"TimeQuest,\" as both share a similar premise -- that of jumping back and forth between historical events to preserve the timestream's integrity. Personally, I found the historical figures in \"Jigsaw\" to be handled more realistically than those in \"TimeQuest.\" While the \"Jigsaw\" player gets to see many of them up close, direct interaction is usually minimized. \"TimeQuest\" required the player to speak and act around its historical personages to influence their actions, often in unrealistic, sometimes almost laughable, ways. The atmosphere in \"Jigsaw\" is better, giving its areas a dark, gritty edge that's necessary to make it convincingly realistic (in particular, the Berlin chapter is one of my favorites). Sadly, while the NPC's are very accurate (Graham Nelson did his research), aside from Black, they are not as interactive as I'd hoped. It would have been nice to be able to ask them about a larger number of things, for instance. \"TimeQuest\" offers a much wider variety of (amusing) queries.\n\nI found \"TimeQuest\" quite overwhelming at the start, though, with nearly eighty timeplaces open for exploration at the very beginning (although the game does make some effort to point you in the right direction). \"Jigsaw,\" by contrast, keeps just enough timeplaces open at once to give the player a variety of alternatives to choose from. This furthers the structured, episodic feel of the game: At the start, you have a small number of places to visit; in the middle-game, nearly half the board is unexplored; and as the endgame draws near, the number of unsolved pieces is again reduced.\n\nSpeaking of the endgame, I must confess that I felt it tended to drag on considerably, with nothing for the player to do but solve an extremely linear sequence of puzzles chasing after a single object. Saying more would necessitate spoilers, so I'll close by saying that the endgame in the Land is by far the weakest portion of \"Jigsaw.\" Once the player gets through it, though, a satisfying conclusion awaits.\n\n\"Jigsaw\" also sports a nifty performance of the Z-Machine assembler, in the appearance of the board and puzzle pieces. Graham Nelson again works wonders with his Inform compiler (but I noticed that \"Jigsaw\" uses version 6.0, currently unavailable to the rest of the I-F community).\n\nIf you haven't played \"Jigsaw\" yet, then by all means, do so. You won't regret it.\n\nFrom: \"Adam J. Thornton\" (adam@phoenix.Princeton.EDU)\n\n[Beware, Adam's review borders on a few spoilers near the end, though I edited out what I could. -GKW]\n\n_Jigsaw_ is the second full-size game from Graham Nelson, author of _Curses_ and the Inform compiler. As one would expect, then, it has been written in Inform, and is thus an Infocom-format story file. There are actually two separate versions of each release: one the familiar .z5 Version 5 story file, such as used in _Trinity_, in which the game and footnotes are separated into separate files, and one in the new Version 8 format. Infocom never wrote a .z8 story file; the format itself is new, and was developed by the author as a way to lift the restrictions of v5 analogously to the way v5 removed certain v3 limitations.\n\nThis, then, is the first Inform game that could not, in principle, have been an Infocom product. That is to say, the sheer quantity of this game places it outside the scope of even late-period textual Infocom. The game is certainly one of the biggest currently existing. For sheer amount of text, only _The Legend Lives_ and possibly _Avalon_ (of the games in my experience) come close; both of those are TADS games, and therefore have a different set of limitations and restrictions with which to cope.\n\nHowever, quantity does not, of course, imply quality. We need only to look at the sixteen (?) floppy diskettes of _Leather Goddesses of Phobos II_. _Jigsaw_ is big. Is it good?\n\nI'll cut the suspense short: yes, it's good. It's very, very good. It is clearly intended by Nelson as his _Trinity_. I consider this an awfully ambitious goal, as _Trinity_ is, in my opinion, Infocom's finest hour. No one else currently working in IF could, I think, write anything approaching another _Trinity_. This is not to disparage any of the fine works that have recently appeared or soon will be appearing. _Avalon_ is a fine game; it also involves a lot of time travel, modularized puzzles, and a plot of cosmic significance. But it doesn't try to be _Trinity_; _Legend_ has lots of travel--this time spatial rather than temporal--between worlds and a plot of cosmic significance, although its puzzles tend to be much less self-contained; however, it too does not attempt to be _Trinity_.\n\nThe structural similarities between _Jigsaw_ and _Trinity_ are striking. Both have a motif of a central place from which portals lead to other worlds; in _Jigsaw_ these worlds are found within the puzzle of the title; _Trinity's_ mushrooms provide its portals. In each, there is a specific problem in each world which must be fixed for the game to proceed. In each game, the fate of the world hangs in the balance, and devolves onto the player, initially just another IF protagonist--in _Jigsaw_, a millenarian partygoer, and in _Trinity_ a boorish American tourist. There are more subtle parallels as well: each game abounds in animals, and both are liberally sprinkled with quotations from external sources.\n\nRemember _Trinity's_ quotations? I do. \"Tomorrow never yet/ On any human being rose or set.\" \"Time isn't holding us/ Time isn't after us/ Same as it ever was/ Same as it ever was.\" \"Tempus edax rerum.\" It was the first time I realized that IF was heir to the same wealth of allusion that traditional fiction is; if you like, the first time it hit me that IF could be Art rather than mere recreation. Nelson has managed to find the same sensitivity in choosing appropriate quotations; like _Curses_, _Jigsaw_ bears the stamp of someone gifted not only with his own words, but with knowing when to use those of others.\n\n_Trinity's_ historical research was good, particularly in the painstakingly correct layout of Trinity Site. _Jigsaw_ has raised the stakes again. It is clear that a great deal of reading has gone into the recreation of its historical set-pieces: Kitty Hawk, the S.S. Titanic, Proust's apartment, and others. This, of course, suggests the other comparison between _Trinity_ and _Jigsaw_. Where do they differ? _Trinity_ has eight worlds; _Jigsaw_ sixteen. _Trinity_ has the lemmings, the bees, the magpie, the German shepherd, the lizard, the rattlesnake, and, of course, the roadrunner. There are sixteen sketchable animals in _Jigsaw_, and a host of others that make cameos.\n\n\"Sketchable?\" I hear you cry. Patience. All will be revealed. Up to now I have told you how _Jigsaw_ is and isn't _Trinity_, but very little as to what it is. One way of characterizing it might be: _Trinity_, but with a love story and a sketchbook.\n\nYou play White, the generic IF protagonist; you start at a quarter to midnight in Century Park, somewhere in London, on the evening of December 31, 1999. You have a party invitation; it instructs you to wear white--hence your character's appellation--and have seen a brief glimpse of an attractive stranger, dressed all in black. Shortly after, you come upon a giant jigsaw piece, and a very bizarre statue of a very bizarre man, one Grad Kaldecki, whose fault all this will turn out to have been. Then a monument to him. There's also a strange device, a rucksack that looks--and acts--surprisingly like the one in _Curses_, and a sketch book belonging to a girl named Emily, intended to hold drawings of animals. WIth luck, you can figure out what to do before the celebrations start and you are sucked into the merriment.\n\nWhat you find is a giant jigsaw puzzle; and you're already carrying a piece. Add to this a lovely Victorian clock, and you have the makings of an adventure, as, when a piece is correctly placed, it opens up a portal to another area of the game.\n\nThere are sixteen pieces. Each one is a self-contained puzzle; in no place do you need an object from any other, although a certain gadget found in one scene can be used in another, but is then lost--and therefore must be put to its intended use before being taken to that world, and one animal can only, I think, be sketched with the use of an object from another piece of the puzzle.\n\nThrough the course of the puzzles, there seem to be three ongoing goals: you need to collect the remaining pieces of the jigsaw, you ought to sketch the animals you find, and you get to know Black, the Mysterious Stranger, somewhat better. The motivation is admittedly weak here: putting together the puzzle and sketching the animals are both things done only because the materials to do so are at hand. While the rationale behind the puzzle pieces appears early on, until the epilogue is reached, there is no indication of the point of the sketchbook.\n\nGraham Nelson has done an amazing job with the White-Black romance. Black is never assigned a gender: she or he can be whatever you want him or her to be, as long as it's attractive. Black has stayed a caucasian female for me, though White's gender has fluctuated. Rec.games.int-fiction has had a long discussion on the technique used. It is, I think devastatingly effective. I have a theory that Black's gender may, in fact, be determined, but to give my speculation would give away a great deal of the game.\n\nBlack, it turns out, is trying to modify the course of the Twentieth Century to make it better, or at least, what Black feels to be better. After realizing that allowing Black to make his or her changes is fatal to the progress of the game, it becomes clear that your job, as White, is to keep history the way it was, or, at least within the context of the game, should have been. This means thwarting Black at (almost) every turn; the tension between preserving your future and courting Black is ridiculously persuasive, despite that fact that Black is no more interactive than your standard IF NPC and that the depth of your crush on Black, within the game, makes little sense. This is another of my criticisms of the game: for someone on whom you're so hung up, you can do curiously little to elicit responses from Black. And one feels that, given Black's behavior throughout the game, you may well be heartily sick of the poltroon by the end.\n\nThe endgame takes place in The Land; it includes knowing winks to _Colossal Cave_ and _Zork_, and is basically one long Rube Goldberg/Heath Robinson puzzle: what you have to do is obvious, but, as you try to do it, like the Babel Fish in _Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy_, obstacles keep interposing. It's charming, and reasonably climactic. And just when you think it's all over, there's an epilogue, which (finally) reveals the purpose of the sketchbook, brings closure to the tension with Black, and, like _Trinity_, drops you back into the circle of time.\n\nThe game fares well as narrative; but how is it as a game? In short, just fine. There a a few flaws: one has to \"look under\" too many things. The Barge scene needs a bit more of a clue; as it stands, it's a \"guess the author's intention\" puzzle. For someone so central to the game, one would hope that Black were more interactive, but he/she doesn't seem to ever want to talk to you. There is one puzzle of exhaustion: the Enigma machine. One feels that Nelson was so pleased with what a spectacular bit of programming modeling an Enigma Machine in Inform was that he forgot to ask whether it would be a good puzzle. If one more stecker were given, reducing the problem to brute-forcing one steckering and one wheel setting, it would be a less annoying puzzle. There is one maze, thankfully brief and not a standard drop-and-map maze. There is one egregious \"guess-the-verb\" puzzle.\n\nThere are also a few wonderful puzzles. The Ghost Bomber is one such; although I've seen complaints from the rgif readers about it, I found it logical, well-motivated, and well-executed. Berlin is small, but tightly constructed and entertaining. In fact, most of the worlds have tight and satisfying puzzles.\n\nAt the end of the day, _Jigsaw_ is a masterful game. It lacks the endearing silliness of _Curses_; it is a much more serious game. It could not have come from Infocom, and I suspect could never have been produced as a commercial venture: too much effort went into the research to have been commercially viable. It is arguably the finest piece of IF yet written. That includes _Trinity_. I have not yet decided whether I prefer _Jigsaw_ or _Trinity_; for once, trying to compare _Trinity_ to anything else is not comparing apples and oranges. However, _Jigsaw_ ranks, on my personal scale of games, comfortably within the top two, followed at some distance by _Spellbreaker_.\n\nI close with an observation and three questions: first, I would like to see a full bibliography rather than just the scattered notes at the end of each section's footnote. Since the v8 format is huge, and since the v5 footnote file is small, could we not also have a list of \"Have you tried...\" as we had in Curses? Second, shouldn't the bowl in Paris contain lime, rather than jasmine, tea? Finally, who is Emily?\n\n[By the way, before everyone starts asking if Avalon is done again, noticing Adam's comments in his reviews, I'd better head you off and say that no, it isn't, and Adam is one of my betatesters, hence he's actually seen the thing.]\n\nFrom: \"Christopher E. Forman\" (ceforma@rs6000.cmp.ilstu.edu) NAME: A Journey Into Xanth PARSER: AGT Standard AUTHOR: Neil Sorenson PLOT: Quite linear EMAIL: None Given ATMOSPHERE: Well-adapted AVAILABILITY: GMD WRITING: Prosaic, with good (:/incoming/if-archive/agt/xanth.zip) spelling but poor grammar PUZZLES: Easy, typical, but plot-related SUPPORTS: AGT Ports CHARACTERS: Nicely developed DIFFICULTY: Easy - Medium\n\nNo, this is not the graphical \"Companions of Xanth\" game released by Legend Entertainment a couple years ago. Rather, it's a text adventure, set in the magical land of Xanth, that I stumbled across on GMD (in rather an odd place, as the header shows).\n\nXanth (the world, not this game) is the creation of author Piers Anthony, and is explored in a couple dozen books comprising the popular series. Unlike our world, known in Xanth as \"Mundania\", everything about Xanth is magical, and puns are taken quite literally -- a \"card table\" is literally a table made out of a giant playing card! Each inhabitant of Xanth has a single magical talent, and no two talents are identical.\n\n\"A Journey Into Xanth\", a charming I-F adaption of Anthony's world, succeeds admirably in capturing the same whimsical appeal of the books. Author Neil Sorenson is obviously a dedicated fan -- his game is chock-full of places, plants, and personages from Xanthian lore, as well as truckloads of the really bad puns that Xanth is famous for. (You _will_ cringe. I guarantee it.)\n\nSorenson's \"Xanth\" puts the player in the role of Mim, a young Xanthian with the ability to summon a magical mirror, which he can use to communicate with anyone else in Xanth. A lengthy but well-written introduction sets up the plot. When the Sen-Trees (told you you'd cringe!) that guard Castle Roogna mysteriously wither and die, leaving the palace defenseless, King Trent sends for your friend Lief, the only one with the power to restore them. Because you have knowledge of swordsmanship, as well as the ability to communicate with the king via your magic mirror, you are chosen to go along as Lief's companion and guide.\n\nThe game handles better than most AGT packages I've had experience with. There are usually plenty of good synonyms, and some amusing responses (although there's no escaping some of those goofy-sounding AGT defaults)."
