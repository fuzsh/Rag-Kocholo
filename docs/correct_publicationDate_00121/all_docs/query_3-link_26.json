        "text": "November 3, 2017\n\nI was given this book as part of a \"Blind Date with a Book\" promotion at the library at the college where I work.\n\nIf this book had been a real blind date, I’m ashamed to say that in the middle of dinner I excused myself to the restroom then promptly climbed out the window and ran far, far away.\n\nI only made it through page 49.\n\nWhen I first unwrapped the book, I was happy to see it was a Piers Anthony novel, as I had enjoyed his Incarnations of Immortality and Bio of a Space Tyrant series when I was in high school.\n\nI had some misgivings when I discovered Zombie Lover is book #22 of the Xanth series, a series I had never tried before. My short time with this book gave me the impression that Xanth is an homage to L. Frank Baum’s Oz books – a nonsensical fantasy world full of magic and absurd plot twists. I’m not a fan of that sort of fiction.\n\nThe book’s sexism really bugged me too. The 15-year-old heroine is being romantically pursued by a twenty-something zombie who doesn’t take no for an answer. One female character alternates between two forms: she’s either really smart and ugly or really dumb and pretty. Maybe this makes sense in context of the previous 21 books, but it just comes off as awful here.\n\nWhat finally did me in was the parade of dozens of characters who I’m sure would be familiar and welcome to longtime readers but just left me bored with their labored quirkiness and long expository scenes about plot developments from the previous books.\n\nMay 18, 2009\n\nThis book is the point that I stopped reading Xanth. I never finished reading it, but I read enough to know that the draw of Xanth for me had come to end. It had become predictable, but still enjoyable several books back in the series. Xanth was one the first fantasy series I'd ever read, and to this day my Xanth collection is one my most beloved. Zombie Lover is the same story that many Xanth books follow, only not as well written. Mr. Anthony's series had become it's own worst enemy. Zombie Lover felt like a work of an author writing his own paycheck more than any other book I've read. It had everything a Xanth fan would want; puns, crazy creatures, humorous magic, characters from previous books...everything except a soul. It's been years since I tried to read Zombie Lover, and maybe sometime down the road I'll pick it up again and I'll enjoy it more after time has dulled my memory of the previous books in the series.\n\nJanuary 23, 2020\n\nI love the magical land of Xanth. Love the familiar, quirky characters and the impossible situations they navigate. I love that Bink gets \"youthenized\" so he can go on a zombie hunt adventure with his son and grandson.\n\nHowever, the typical Piers Anthony sexism is especially hard to swallow in this one. It's constant, unrelenting. Then comes low-key pedophilia. I had to stop reading when Bink's twin great-granddaughters are sexualized by none other than Bink himself, pg 89. Gross. I am disappointed in Piers Anthony. I hope he reads his past work and has a change in heart.\n\nNovember 25, 2015\n\nBook 22 of the Xanth series is one of my favorites in the series, and though I am happy to have been able to reread it again, I am sorry that it is done.\n\nThe book follows a young black wave girl by the name of Breanna as she is out exploring. Breanna is different from other Mundanes in Xanth because she was not born in Xanth yet she still has a magic talent - she is able to see perfectly in the darkness. When morning arrives, Breanna find that she is tired and settles down for a nap. Unfortunately she did not pay attention to where she was sleeping and was kissed awake by a king - a zombie king named Xeth to be precise. Not wanting to get married at the age of 15 to a zombie, she runs away. After some side journeys, she finally gets to the Good Magician's castle to ask how she can be rid of Xeth's advances.\n\nWhile this is going on, Castle Roogna, and it's main inhabitants, are getting ready for a grand and glorious wedding. The problem is that no one knows who is getting married. While preparations are being made, news comes that the zombies are restless. So King Dor, along with his son Prince Dolph and his youthened father Bink set out on a journey to figure out the cause of the zombie restlessness and stop it before the big wedding. Along the way, they visit a number of Ida's moons looking for the Zombie Master, forget where home is, meet up with Breanna and her companion, and end up on the Isle of Women, where the only way off is for these three married men to marry one of the inhabitants of the island.\n\nThis is a fun addition to the Xanth series. I like it because it brings back a couple of the original characters from the series, like Bink, Justin Tree, and Jonathan and Millie. It was a fast paced adventure that meshes Xanth characters with a mundane character without it taking away from the story. Any fan of the series will love this adventure, and I highly recommend it.\n\nMay 21, 2016\n\nMore Piers punnery and exiting Xanthy tomfoolery. I always enjoy reading a novel in this series, no matter what he writes. And, I love that he has written SO many! So, by the by, Breanna, a beautiful young girl fresh to Xanth's magical realm, deals with a dire & distressing dilemma. She falls asleep at a love pavilion, gets kissed awake by the King of the Zombies who then wants to marry her!!Really, and that's where the fun really begins! She's unknowingly allowed the Demon Xanth to share her dreams so he can learn how to dream himself. Adventures ensue!\n\n\"Her quest to preserve her innocence, and find her destiny, takes her on an exhilarating excursion packed with perils, puzzles, and piles of puns!\" Piles o' puns are the best part! Woo Hoo, book 22!!! Only a master gets a series up so high. We have visits from familiar characters; we see Justin Tree, Ida's moon Ptero, and Nimby as well. It's a four and a half star read, a solid and lush world.\n\nNovember 3, 2013\n\nThis book was very awful. The sexual innuendo that started to ramp up with Dawn and Eve in the previous book is full blown in this one. I don't understand why Anthony went in that direction. Xanth had no place for it in my opinion.\n\nIda's moons are back much to my dismay. The first visit there does nothing at all to advance the story. All it does is waste a few chapters on horrible reader submitted puns. The second visit was thankfully brief but still bad.\n\nThe kings spend half the book looking for home since they forgot where it was. They see a castle, know they are kings, but don't bother to even go ask anyone there. Then they meet Justin who ought to know where they live but he never says anything. Too many horrible plot holes just to keep the \"story\" going.\n\nMay 20, 2017\n\nThis was the first Xanth novel I ever read, but it was easy enough to get into. I wasn't too confused by reference to other Xanth novels as they were minimal and were not much focused on. Some of the jokes were rather funny, and the plot had enough humorous twists in it (and a couple of cool surprises!) to keep me well-entertained. It was a rather enjoyable book, though I definitely like Incarnations of Immortality better. overall 3.5/5 stars.\n\nNovember 4, 2021\n\nInventive and page-turning, but sometimes really tedious with the puns and repetitious, excessive dialogue. The childlike fairy-tale narration was fun - until every other page was women in different states of undress and men unable to stop staring at them. Very weird preoccupation with summoning the stork.\n\nRead\n\nMay 16, 2020\n\nPartire con il 22mo libro di una serie non aiuta.\n\nNon sono riuscita ad entrare nella storia e l'ho abbandonato dopo una ventina di pagine.\n\nSe dovessi incrociare la strada del primo volume della saga di Xanth potrei dargli una possibilità... ma non è detto.\n\nAugust 26, 2019\n\n4 Stars\n\nZombie Lover is the twenty-second book in the Xanth series by Piers Anthony. Breanna is new to Xanth, and now she's come to the attention of Zombie King, Xeth- who is determined to make her his Queen. What will she do?\n\nThe Xanth Series is quite a really long series that has spanned many decades. I remember reading the first few books back in the very early 1980’s and was totally captivated by the epic fantasy that unfolded before my eyes. I collected all the books as each new one was released and have revisited them a few times over the years. Recently I had been reorganising my bookshelves, because eight book cases have become insufficient to house all my books (#bookwhoredilemma)- and it came to the point where I was going to have to get rid of some of my older books/series in order to make way for new favourites. I looked at all the larger/longer series first and this is one of the larger series that I have, it came under scrutiny. I decided to reread all the books I was considering getting rid of first- before making a final decision. I can honestly say that although I these books didn’t blow me away as they once did- I still really enjoyed all the adventure, magic, swords & sorcery like epic fantasy that Mr. Anthony is renowned for. He has imbued his stories with plenty of humour, a playfulness, lots of fun, action, some history, conspiracies, secrets, surprising developments, and much, much more. We meet so many varied and original characters along the way- the books are full of wonderful fictional beasts and paranormal creatures/beasts. From centaurs, to demons, dragons, fauns, gargoyles, goblins, golems, harpies, merfolk, elves, nymphs, ogres, zombies, and curse fiends- and a few more I am sure I have missed.\n\nThe world of Xanth is wonderfully rich and vividly descriptive. It is really well written and is so easy to imagine, it came to life before my eyes. Each ‘person’ in Xanth is born with their own unique magical ability, which is called a ‘talent’. We follow along on many epic adventures and explore the world as the story unfolds.\n\nI have many fond memories of reading this book/series- and in the end I can’t cull any of my collection. So I decided to just purchase a couple of extra bookcases instead. #myprecious\n\nA series worth exploring- especially for any epic fantasy lover who loves some fun and humour served with their adventure.\n\nThank you, Mr. Anthony!\n\nNovember 23, 2020\n\nIt is nice to go back and read the tail end of this series (another like 15 to 19 books to go at this point), and you have to agree with the Author in his afterwords, that the critics no longer like these books because they pander way too much to the readers, who have more puns and ideas to give the author than the author’s willingness to make the books up to the standards of the first novels in this series. With all of that in mind, this book, along with many of the others I expect to read in the coming days, just do not make it to the average fantasy level anymore, and if they do, I will not that in future reports. It’s nice to revisit with Bink and several other characters. However, there is very little drama to keep the reader’s attention in this one and I found myself concentrating real hard at times to stay awake or even remember the roles of the various characters in this installment (and there weren’t that many to be honest). The ending was anticlimactic, very obvious, and I think that at this point that maybe these novels should wind up in the young adult section of your local library/bookstore rather than in an adult’s hands like mine.\n\nI picked up my first fantasy novel when I was 13 years old. Piers Anthony’s novel, A Spell for Chameleon was the first on the list so I tried it. I loved it so much that it has put me on the path to being an avid collector of fantasy novels and I will always remember Anthony as a pioneer in the genre. He has other great novels and other series, even some cool sci-fi stuff, but he will always be remembered for the Xanth series, no matter how watered down it gets. I have to put this here because I feel compelled to put it here, give him credit where credit is due before I go on and read this rest of this series and be forced to review each effort as objectively as I can.\n\nAugust 22, 2020\n\nWhat a zany story. This is my first adventure with Piers Anthony. The guy was brilliant and wrote well (not sure if he's still alive, he'd be in his eighties - i'll have to remember to Google this when I'm done writing this review.) But I'm not sure I'd read another one by Piers. It just might not be for me... The entire world he's created in this novel is play on words and relies on the English language. For instance: lip balm... in this world, there is such a thing as lip bomb. This is stuff you apply to your lips before giving someone a kiss, and it packs a wallop, creating a boom so surprising it knocks someone off their feet.\n\nThis book is full of it, I mean just loaded with these things that are a play on words. But at the same time, Piers avoids being too cheeky. It takes major talent to do what he does... but yeah, I just don't think it's for me.\n\nDecember 30, 2018\n\nI selected this book to re-read so that I could complete my A-Z Reading Challenge (I'm going my titles only). I had re-read another Xanth book recently, only to be disappointed. It didn't have the same fun and enjoyment that I had remembered from my childhood.\n\nHowever, this time around, I appreciated the clever puns and fun, fluffy adventure. Breanna, the main protagonist in this book, had a great story arc and had a lot of personal growth throughout the narrative. There were a lot of side plots and foreshadowing that wrapped up nicely in the end. There was a lot of older, beloved characters who made an appearance, so that long-time fans could have something to look forward to. That being said, even though this is the 22nd Xanth novel, it could easily be read as a standalone.\n\nMarch 1, 2022\n\nThese books are totally predictive but man are they great palette cleansers. I just read something that was dark and kind of heavy and I need something light to reset and refresh my joy. That's what these books are great for.\n\nNo heavy lifting required, just funny puns and cute characters to distract and entertain the mind on that simple level. I love the Xanth world from day one and I hate zombies like Breanna. I wanted to get this one out of the way because of my dislike of all zombie subjects. I guess I'm a bit prejudice too? LOL.\n\nFebruary 2, 2021\n\nI found the oeverabundance of puns rather annoying and almost didn't continue reading because of them. I'm glad I did though, because despite the punishment, it turned out to be a lovely story with a lot of heart. I really enjoyed the characters and the world of Xanth, which I had not previously entered. Rare for a series, I didn't feel lost even though this is book #22. It stands alone well. It has a lot of gentle moral themes good for (anybody, really) young teens.\n\nApril 27, 2022\n\nWas okay, not terrible but not great. I think sometimes these books are so fun for the puns, and this had some great ones. However, they didn't carry through the whole book. Some of these Xanth novels also have super cute characters-- I did like the human to tree, Jason, but the rest were mostly just rehashed characters from other books. The plot was only ok-- tried to be meaningful but was actually forced. Definitely earlier books in the series were more new and fresh.\n\nSeptember 27, 2018\n\nThis one hit me in the heart, because of me and my wife, its not every day you get to read a story that portrays a black woman falling in love with a white man, it was something of a shock to me when i read this book but the joy and the adventure was something that i just couldn't stop laughing especially with breanna don't mess with me personality to justin's calm and collective one\n\nJune 1, 2020\n\nThe Xanth books by Piers Anthony were one of the first SciFi/Fantasy series I ever read. I love puns so I have always enjoyed them. Upon re-reading them I can see that they have some weaknesses but overall they stand the test of time. They are a fun and fast read that keeps me amused without any deep thinking required.\n\nJuly 19, 2018\n\nI wish this site had a never wish I read function. The characters are cookie cutter. The dialogue is modern but set in a fairy tale. It’s ham handed and clunky. Neil gaiman need not worry about his job. Mr Anthony will not be taking it from him.\n\nSeptember 8, 2023\n\nNo timeline going to give it continuity and many uninteresting segments. But a few of the little chapters were interesting and gave some insight into his life. The last part of the book was very sad.\n\nSeptember 22, 2023\n\nI enjoyed reading this book more than the last couple of Xanth books. Though Piers Anthony seems to be putting more and more of now both mundania and princess Ida's moons into them. But maybe that's to keep them interesting.\n\nJune 27, 2020\n\nBreanna is one of the most interesting main characters in the Xanth novels.\n\nJuly 11, 2023\n\nThe story of Breanna of the Black Wave, and her adventure with Justin Tree . . .\n\nJanuary 11, 2010\n\nXanth #22: Zombie Lover, by Piers Anthony\n\nI think \"Zombie Lover\" was the first Xanth book I read, and it's a perfect book for getting into the series. Breanna, the main character, isn't a native of Xanth but instead migrated with the Black Wave; human migration into Xanth has always happened in waves of people. And so the readers see Xanth through Breanna's eyes, which is a great way to see it if you're new to the series.\n\nNot overfull of puns, as some of the later Xanth books are, \"Zombie Lover\" follows Breanna as she tries to escape marrying a zombie king. Anthony examines bigotry and racism through her attitude toward zombies, which mirrors the feelings some have toward Breanna herself as she is black.\n\nParallel to Breanna's story are the stories of Jenny, and of the kings of Xanth, who accidently drank Lethe water, causing them to forget where home was. Jenny, an elf and another non-native of Xanth, is writing invitations and planning a massive wedding, but no one knows who the bride is.\n\n\"Zombie Lover\" is a solid installment in the series, and is better than some of the recent Xanth books published.\n\n3/5.\n\nNovember 15, 2011\n\n\"Zombie Lover\" is another in the Xanth series, my favorite series of all time. Breanna of the black wave is the only one her age to have a magical talent, that of seeing in the darkness. That is because, unknown to her, she has allowed the Demon Xanth to share her dreams so he can learn how to dream himself (Demons don't dream after all) She falls asleep in a love pavillion and is kissed awake by the King of the Zombies who wants to marry her, and that's where the fun really begins!\n\nI love this novel, although there are parts I don't really enjoy reading. That is, I love the concept of Ida's moon, Ptero, but I don't particularly enjoy reading about each world.\n\nAs always, the ending is not what you expected it to be, and there is plenty of romance all round. I think the reason I always read this one after Yon Ill Wind, instead of in correct order, is that Nimby is in this one and he's my favorite character.\n\nI adore Xanth; there are no two ways about it. An excellent book in an excellent series by a masterful writer.\n\nNovember 26, 2013\n\nHave to say, I don't love the whole Ida's moons thread that seems to be taking over the series, it's an intriguing premise, but one book about it was enough, and this one just seemed to stretch it out too much! I'm also getting a little tired of the puns, which seem to not have any purpose any more, they are just there because it's expected of Xanth, and just seem randomly thrown in, instead of being cleverly placed!\n\nThat aside, I did enjoy the main characters in this, and their story, so wasn't all bad! I really liked Breanna and it's great to finally have Justin Tree getting a storyline, and look forward to hearing more of him, when he's returned to man form, youthened and become Zombie master!\n\nSeptember 11, 2023\n\n\"Some things you just have to learn for yourself.\"\n\nAt first glance, a typical Xanth novel, with Breanna of the Black Wave, having a pretty typical Xanth adventure. But as a non-native, she doesn't ask Good Magican Humphrey a question, but instead falls into her adventure after a zombie kissing her awake and falling in love with her.\n\nThere's a fantastic lesson in this book in Breana's character development. She understands racism, as an African American (Xanthian?), but at the beginning she still displays bigotry towards the zombies. Throughout the books, she overcomes these prejudices (after all: do unto others, right?)\n\nIt's a fun, light-hearted romp through the land of Xanth, being seen through fresh eyes. And during the adventure, we all learn valuable lessons.\n\nSeptember 4, 2008\n\nThis book is the height of awesome for me. I first read it about 8 years ago, and it has since been my favorite book EVER. Although it isn't as well written as some, this book has a certain excitement to it with an odd twist involving a tree who is tired of a boring life, a black wave girl who made a HUGE mistake, and yes, zombies. Although the title makes it sound like a bad horror story or softcore porn, it's actually a fantasy with a comedic twist. I sincerely applaud Piers Anthony for a book well done."
