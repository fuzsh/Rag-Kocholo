        "text": "Hi guys,\n\nThis is something I've been curious about: who is the most prolific fantasy author - either in terms of number of published books or in terms of number of published words (in cases where such a wordcount is available)?\n\nAlso, a related question: who is the fastest fantasy author (i.e. the author who has written the greatest number of works in the shortest period of time)?\n\nThanks in advance for your answers.\n\nJust trying to think of authors in the last 30 years or so who have published a ton of books, Terry Brooks, Raymond Feist and David Eddings come to mind, probably R.A. Salvatore too. Not the biggest books, nor the best, but alot of them.\n\nProbably a guy you never even heard of:\n\nLionel Fanthorpe.\n\nOr you could look here, too.\n\nLife is not complete till you've read one of his works, but you may not know when you have, as his list of pseudonyms is itself a marvel and a wonder.\n\nI've got to check one of Fanthorpe books. This is the first time I-ve heard of him.\n\nI tought Isaac Asimov has an impressive body of work, but in science fiction and popular science, not in fantasy.\n\nFor Fantasy I.m thinking Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E Howard [especially considering his short career) although Howard wrote mostly short stories, so in terms of word count he would not qualify.\n\nRecently I'm impressed by Harry Turtledove output. He also has special circumstances, as he doesn't spend much time on worldbuilding by using alternate Earth history [with the exception of Videssos] .\n\nI've got to check one of Fanthorpe books. This is the first time I-ve heard of him.\n\nIt's, erm, an experience. He's not very good, but he churned out metric tons and tons of books (fairly short ones) under numerous pseudonyms. Later on he became a priest. Critic David Langford is a fan (or 'appreciator') and you can find some of his articles on Fanthorpe on the Ansible website.\n\nIn terms of really good authors, front-runners would be Steven Erikson, Robert Jordan (his first seven, very large, books came out in less than six years) and Brandon Sanderson. Including SF, at one time Harry Turtledove was almost inarguably in the lead (producing three 600+ novels a year), but at the moment the front-runner is Dan Abnett, who produces 3-4 300+ page novels a year plus hundreds of pages of graphic novels and comics and other projects (including this year a movie screenplay).\n\nTerry Pratchett has Piers Anthony beat when it comes to one series. From 1983 until today (literally, Sept 2010) Pratchett has published 38 Discworld novels.\n\nMore recently, I think Elizabeth Bear has published quite a few novels and short stories and won numerous awards, numerous times for her works in just the last decade. I think we're going to see a lot from her before she's through.\n\nYou could look it up.\n\nIf you consider his entire body of work I would think H.P. Lovecraft beats most of the writers aforementioned... and he is certainly a writer of more substance then the likes of Terry Pratchett and Mercedes Lackey (blech!).\n\nI think you are very seriously under-rating Pratchett's work. Being comic does not mean lacking substance. There is a great deal more meat on the subject of the human condition in most Pratchett books than in any Lovecraft I ever heard tell of.\n\nLovecraft I've got collected in a couple of novels and 1 book of collected stories.\n\nThe many books you tend to speak of, Sparrow may be the same material recycled. Even if you took the volumes of letters and the poetry he had published after his death I would say a dozen or so books in total.\n\nMark\n\nI think you are very seriously under-rating Pratchett's work. Being comic does not mean lacking substance. There is a great deal more meat on the subject of the human condition in most Pratchett books than in any Lovecraft I ever heard tell of.\n\nSorry, he just doesn't do anything for me.\n\nSatire is fine for dessert, just don't make a meal of it.\n\nTerry Pratchett has Piers Anthony beat when it comes to one series. From 1983 until today (literally, Sept 2010) Pratchett has published 38 Discworld novels.\n\nTrue, but Anthony was cranking out other books during that period as well, about 60 all together.\n\nETA: Not to say that any of them are on par with Discworld, but we're talking quantity, not quality.\n\nTrue, but Anthony was cranking out other books during that period as well, about 60 all together.\n\nETA: Not to say that any of them are on par with Discworld, but we're talking quantity, not quality.\n\nVery true. Pratchett's only done Discworld (ok, and a handful of others) while Anthony has done a ton of different stuff.\n\nVery true. Pratchett's only done Discworld (ok, and a handful of others) while Anthony has done a ton of different stuff.\n\nPratchett has two trilogies and six stand-alone novels set outside the Discworld setting, including two of his finest works (Nation and Good Omens, cowritten with Gaiman), which can't be readily dismissed in quality.\n\nAnthony has almost twice as many books as Pratchett, which is impressive (and, although Anthony is fourteen years older, they published their first novels close together, Anthony in 1967 and Pratchett in 1971).\n\nThe most prolific author in history, officially, is Charles Hamilton, who wrote over 100 million words in his lifetime, the equivalent of 1,200 novels. No SFF author is really in this league, although Isaac Asimov would get to maybe the halfway mark if his non-fiction was included."
