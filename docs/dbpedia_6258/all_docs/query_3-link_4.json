The Sussex Skyhawks, the last time to call to the venue home, folded after the 2010 season.\n\n(Robert Sciarrino/The Star-Ledger)\n\nFRANKFORD â€” Four years after the Sussex Skyhawks folded, Skyland Park is getting a new baseball team, according to a published report.\n\nStadium owner Al Dorso Sr. told NJHerald.com the team will begin play in 2015 and play in the Canadian-American League. The league is independent, meaning its teams are not affiliated with Major League Baseball. An official announcement is expected within days.\n\nAbout 80 percent of a $2 million renovation of the 4,200-seat facility is finished. The team will play 56 regular-season games at the facility, the report said.\n\nDorso paid $850,000 for the stadium in late 2013.\n\nThe facility housed the New Jersey Cardinals, a Single-A New York-Penn League team, from 1994 to 2005.\n\nThe New Jersey Jackals, who play at Yogi Berra Stadium in Little Falls, are also members of the Can-Am League."
