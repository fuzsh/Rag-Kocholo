Fortunately for football players, Dr.Vitolo has the experience to help repair football injuries and offer the preventive techniques to ensure safety on the field.\n\nAmong the most common football injuries treated by the Advocare Orthopedic & Sports Medical Center team are sprains and strains, ligament injuries, shoulder separations and dislocations, stress fractures and more.

But even the best-conditioned athletes can suffer devastating injuries. Soccer injuries are some of the most frequent in sports, due largely to the number of participants. Over 477,500 soccer-related injuries are treated in healthcare facilities throughout the country. Common soccer injuries include torn ligaments, meniscal tears, strains and sprains, and stress fractures of the knees, feet, and ankles.\n\nBaseball/Softball\n\nOn the surface, the nation’s pastime may look like a sport in which it is difficult to suffer a serious injury, however, even the simple motion of swinging a bat calls upon hundreds of muscles and subjects the body to unnatural twists and turns. Pitchers are also at risk of serious injury due to the repetitive motion of throwing the ball at high speed. At Advocare Orthopedic Sports Medical Center, we treat all baseball injuries, including ankle sprains, rotator cuff tears, ligament injuries, and more.\n\nTo avoid becoming one of the nearly 500,000 sufferers of baseball injuries, call the Advocare Orthopedic & Sports Medical Center team today to learn injury prevention tips.

Basketball injuries in the U.S. exceed those of soccer and baseball combined, numbering well over 1.6 million per year.\n\nAdvocare Orthopedic & Sports Medical Center has treated nearly every imaginable basketball injury and has helped countless patients return to this demanding sport. Our treatment programs include strategies for the repair of torn ligaments, strains and sprains, meniscal injuries, shoulder pain, rotator cuff tears and many more.\n\nMore\n\nAdvocare Orthopedic & Sports Medical Center can help repair or prevent virtually any sports injury, including those from:\n\nVolleyball\n\nSkiing & Snowboarding\n\nCross Country\n\nCheerleading\n\nGolf\n\nGymnastics\n\nHockey\n\nEquestrian\n\nSwimming\n\nTennis\n\nWrestling\n\nField Hockey & Lacrosse\n\nThere is no need to avoid your favorite sport due to injury."
