        "text": "With Brockton Rox assistant Justine Siegal, the first female coach for a men’s professional baseball team, in the first-base coach’s box, there was a sense of history in the air at Campanelli Stadium Thursday night.\n\nUnfortunately for Rox manager Chris Carminucci and his club, once the middle innings of the night’s Can-Am League season opener with the defending champion Sussex Skyhawks rolled around, there was a sense of doom in the air at Campanelli as well.\n\n“It seemed they found every hole possible,” said Rox starter Wayne Lundgren, who absorbed the loss in Brockton’s 6-1 season-opening setback to the Skyhawks. “Every little bloop single found a hole, balls off broken bats dropped in. (There were) a couple or three hits down the line that were just fair.\n\n“I felt like I threw well, located well. It was just unfortunate. (It was) one of those nights, but that’s baseball. You’ve just got to tip your hat and get them next start.”\n\nThis one wasn’t good for starters.\n\n“Not the way you want to start,” Carminucci said after his managerial debut with Brockton had been spoiled with the decisive loss on a night when there was also a damp chill in the air. “They hit one ball hard and had a lot of balls fall in for them on a lousy night.\n\n“Tough night to hit, but you’ve got to fight through it. Our pitchers made some good pitches, but to their credit they hit them and got them to fall in.”\n\nScoring in the third through the sixth innings — twice each in the fourth and fifth — and driving Lundgren from the game in the process, the defending league champions put this one out of reach over the course of the middle innings.\n\n“It ended up being 6-0 early and that’s tough to come back from,” said Carminucci. “This team will come back from that eventually. We’ve got to get the bats rolling and we will.”\n\nAt the same time the Skyhawks were posting their six runs off Lundgren (five runs, three earned, over 41/3 innings) and reliever Freddy Flores (a solo home run by Ron Perodin in the sixth), Sussex ace Kyle Ruwe was settling into a rhythm.\n\nShaking off hits to two of the first four Rox batters he faced — a one-out single up the middle by Dominic Ramos in the first and a leadoff double up the right-center field gap by Palmer Karr in the second — Ruwe ruined Opening Night by setting down 13 Brockton hitters in order until Chris Valencia blooped a one-out single to left in the sixth.\n\nKarr (both doubles) and Valencia each had two hits for the Rox. Beyond that, the team was a collective 3-for-26 at the plate against Ruwe and relievers Jimmy Douglas and Matt Petrusek.\n\n“No matter how hard a guy throws, if he can throw three pitches for strikes, that’s tough to hit,” Karr said of Ruwe, a 12-game winner a year ago. “You can’t take one of those pitches because you’ve got to respect that he can throw three of them for strikes. He did a good job. He kept everyone off balance.”\n\nShortstop Ramos’ third-inning error on a squib off the bat of Ray Serrano led to the Skyhawks’ first run on Perodin’s ground-ball double down the line in left.\n\nA double by Matt Weston that landed just beyond the reach of a diving Karr in left-center field triggered a two-run fourth that saw Kyle Kmiecik (an infield single) and Ryan Crespi (a single to right) each drive in one.\n\nKarr’s drop of a blooper off the bat of Jorge Moreno played a major role in a two-run fifth in which Maikel Jova (single) and Jeremy Hunt (double) drove in runs. Perodin closed out the Sussex scoring with his blast to right in the sixth.\n\n“I dropped the ball in left field,” said Karr. “It cost us two runs. It doesn’t matter if you drive in two runs, if you cost your team two runs in the field you’re not worth anything. I’ve got to make plays in the outfield.”\n\nAfter Ruwe (five hits over six innings) departed, the Rox got to Douglas for a run in the eighth when Chris Grossman singled, Valencia doubled and Melvin Falu drove a sacrifice fly to Perodin in center, but that was it.\n\n“First-game jitters,” Karr said when it was over. “Get them out of the way and relax from now on. We’ll be fine.”"
