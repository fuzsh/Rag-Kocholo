        "text": "CenturyLink Field at Skylands Park is a baseball stadium located in Augusta, New Jersey. The official seating capacity of Skylands Park is 4,356. It was the home of the Sussex Skyhawks of the Can-Am League since the 2006 baseball season, until the team disbanded in January 2011. It is also the home of the Jersey Stags minor-league football team.\n\nIn May 2010, telecommunications company CenturyLink bought naming rights to Skylands Park.\n\nGround was broken in the fall of 1993 for a new park that would host the relocated Glens Falls, New York Redbirds. The winter of 1994 brought the worst weather in several years to North Jersey, but the new ballpark managed to open on time that June, although the luxury boxes were not completed until the following year.\n\nThe park is designed to look a little bit like a farm complex from the outside. Augusta has long been the home of dairy farms, and the Cardinals wanted to make their stadium blend in.\n\nIn 1999, the field hosted several games for the Newark Bears of the independent Atlantic League, prior to the completion of their new home, Bears and Eagles Riverfront Stadium. In addition, the Sussex County Colonels of the Atlantic Collegiate Baseball League, a summer league for college-eligible players, made Skylands Park their home for several seasons.\n\nThe stadium was the home field for the New Jersey Cardinals of the New York - Penn League from 1994 to 2005. Following the 2005 season, the Cardinals were sold and subsequently relocated to State College, Pennsylvania where they are now known as the State College Spikes.\n\nOn January 10, 2006, it was announced that Skylands Park would be the home to the newly named Sussex Skyhawks in the Can-Am League. On May 29, 2006, the Skyhawks played their first regular season game at Skylands Park, dropping an 18-11 decision to the North Shore Spirit. In early January of 2011, it was announced that the Sussex Skyhawks would not be returning for the 2011 season, and it is unsure as to whether any team will call Skylands Park home for the 2011 season, although there have been discussions.
