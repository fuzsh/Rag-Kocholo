        "text": "FRANKFORD — As one of the new owners of Skylands Park in Sussex County, Al Dorso Jr. knows he's going to need more than just baseball to keep the place afloat.\n\nWhile the 4,200-seat ballpark attracted big crowds when it first opened in 1994 as home of the New Jersey Cardinals, it has been mostly vacant since the Sussex County Skyhawks quietly left town after the 2010 season.\n\n“The bills come in monthly. We have to figure out how to get at least eight months out of the property,” said Dorso, of Pompton Plains, who was part of a group of investors that purchased the ballpark from a private entrepreneur in October for $850,000.\n\nAnd although baseball remains an integral part of the future — Skylands Park may host a developmental league for college-aged players starting in 2015 — the national pastime won’t be the only attraction there this spring.\n\n“We’re going to be doing a lot of different events geared toward families and young people. It’s going to be a multi-purpose entertainment facility,” said Ed Manetta of Fastlane Communications, a New York City marketing firm that is working with Skylands Stadium LLC to develop events that will be held at the ballpark.\n\n“We’re going to go beyond baseball.” with a strong emphasis on family entertainment, said Manetta, who recently met with Dorso at the ballpark’s offices to discuss future plans as workers were busy renovating the locker rooms. \"We're trying to figure out what would be a good fit.\"\n\nTammie Horsfield, president of the 700-member Sussex County Chamber of Commerce, said she believed the ballpark’s new ownership was on the right track.\n\n“We need more family entertainment. There’s never enough things to do in the evenings and on weekends,” she said.\n\nHorsfield also said a revitalized Skylands Park, located on 28 acres at the intersection of Routes 206 and 15 in Frankford adjacent to the proposed Sussex Commons shopping mall, could provide a much-needed boost to local vendors and suppliers. It could also provide jobs for students and those in need of a second income, she said.\n\n“It’s nice to see that corner moving ahead,” Horsfield said.\n\nWhile most of the plans are still on the drawing board, the ballpark will host a concert in late May, the first event under the auspices of the new ownership, Dorso said. While no bands have been officially booked yet, he said he expects the concert will feature a country, country rock or classical rock band.\n\nCollege- and high school-level baseball teams, including the Sussex County Community College Skylanders, are also expected to be playing on the spruced-up field starting this spring.\n\nPlans for other events, such as music festivals, a Christmas light show, a haunted house during the Halloween season, car shows, flea markets and trade shows, are still in the works, said Dorso, who is also the head of State Fair Meadowlands, a 17-day event held annually outside MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford.\n\nA basketball court or an indoor soccer field will replace the old batting cages, which were removed this winter.\n\nAsked what he hoped Skylands Park would become known for, he replied, “I’d like it to be known as a place for families and community, to be thought of as a positive. It should put a smile on people’s faces.”\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n• Skylands Park gets new owners with hopes of baseball returning in 2015\n\n• With deal closed, new Skylands Park owner exploring all possibilities\n\n• Dreams unfulfilled: Frankford's Skylands Park to remain vacant this summer\n\nFOLLOW THE STAR-LEDGER: TWITTER • FACEBOOK • GOOGLE+"
