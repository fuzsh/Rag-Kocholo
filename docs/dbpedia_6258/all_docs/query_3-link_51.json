        "text": "1:48 p.m., July 10, 2008--Fifteen former University of Delaware baseball standouts are currently in the professional ranks, including three at the highest level of minor league baseball.\n\nThe group is led by Kevin Mench, who has spent 24 games at the Major League level in 2008 with the Toronto Blue Jays. Currently in the Class AAA International League with the Syracuse Skychiefs, he has hit .270 with four home runs, 23 runs scored, and 24 RBI in his 41 games in the minors.\n\nTwo other Fightin' Blue Hens also find themselves in the top level of minor league baseball. Outfielder Reid Gorecki, who was hitting .319 with the Mississippi Braves of the Southern League, was recently called up to the Richmond Braves of the International League. In his first three games with Atlanta's top minor league team, he has hit .455 with five hits and two runs scored.\n\nOn the other side of the country, Mike Koplove has been a steady producer out of the Las Vegas 51s' bullpen. In 33 games this season, the side-wheeling right-hander has posted a 1-1 record with six saves and a 3.55 ERA for the Los Angeles Dodgers' AAA affiliate.\n\nFormer Delaware catcher Brian Valichka has spent seven games in the AA Eastern League with the Bowie Baysox of the Baltimore Orioles organization. Now in the single-A South Atlantic League, he is hitting .372 with one home run and seven RBI in 15 games as a member of the Delmarva Shorebirds.\n\nTodd Davison, Valichka's former teammate and Delaware's all-time Iron Man, is also in the Orioles organization. Playing for the Frederick Keys in the Carolina League, he has appeared in 56 games while manning third base. During the season, he has roped 42 hits, stolen four bases, and scored 26 runs.\n\nChad Kerfoot and Brandon Menchaca are also at the single-A level playing for teams in the Midwest League. Kerfoot has been a standout performer for the Kane County Cougars since joining the team in early May. During his 15 appearances with Oakland's affiliate, he has posted a 4-1 record, three saves, and a 2.75 ERA. In 36 innings, he has also struck out 33 and issued only six walks.\n\nMenchaca has played in 33 games for the Dayton Dragons of the Cincinnati Reds organization. Over that stretch, he has notched four home runs, 11 RBI, 14 runs scored, and four stolen bases.\n\nFour members of the 2008 Blue Hen team also have found a spot in the minor leagues. Pitchers Mike McGuire, Dan Richardson, and David Slovak all are in the short-season New York-Penn League, while former All-American infielder Alex Buchholz is in the Pioneer League.\n\nSlovak, the Hens' closer during the last two seasons, has been an excellent addition to the Vermont Lake Monsters' bullpen. Over eight appearances and 10.1 innings, he has posted a 1-0 record to go along with two saves and a 2.61 ERA. Since the Washington Nationals signed him as a free agent, he has struck out 11 and held opponents to a .231 batting average, including a .125 mark for left-handed hitters.\n\nMcGuire and Richardson have also worked primarily as relievers during the early part of their careers. McGuire, a captain on the 2008 squad, has made seven appearances for the Mahoning Valley Scrappers. During his time in the Indians organization, he has posted one win, a save, and eight strikeouts in nine innings of work.\n\nRichardson, a hard-throwing right-hander, has made six appearances and struck out five during his stint with the Batavia Muckdogs since being picked by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 38th round of the June Draft.\n\nOut west in the Pioneer League, Buchholz has made a quick transition to professional baseball with the Billings Mustangs. In his first 12 games, the 2007 Delaware MVP has hit .362 with seven RBI and 12 runs scored. A sixth-round pick of the Cincinnati Reds, he has also clubbed five doubles and a triple.\n\nBrent Gaphardt, a 2006 draft pick of the Seattle Mariners, has also recently kicked off his career in the Arizona League. Pitching for the AZL Mariners, he made his first appearance on July 8, striking out one during a perfect inning of work.\n\nAlong with the players currently suiting up for affiliated teams, three former Hens are also playing in Independent or International Leagues. Mark Michael, a fourth-round selection in 2003, has made four starts on the mound for the Sussex Skyhawks of the Can-Am League. During his outings, he has gone 2-2 with 13 strikeouts in 19.1 innings.\n\nIn the Atlantic League, Pete Maestrales has been a staple in the infield of the Long Island Ducks during the 2008 season. In 39 games, the third baseman has scored 15 runs and knocked in 19 others.\n\nAcross the Pacific Ocean, Cliff Brumbaugh has continued his outstanding career in the Korean Baseball League. Now with the Woori Heroes, he is hitting .290 with 12 home runs and 55 RBI in 77 games."
