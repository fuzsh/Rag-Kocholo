        "text": "BROCKTON â€” The Brockton Rox have released its 2009 schedule.\n\nThe Rox will host the reigning Can-Am League champion Sussex Skyhawks May 28 in the season opener. Game time at Campanelli Stadium is 7:05 p.m. and will include a special fireworks show.\n\nThe Rox will play 94 games, including 47 at home.\n\nStart times for Rox games will change slightly for the new season. All Monday, Tuesday and Saturday night games will begin at 6:05 p.m. Wednesday, Thursday and Friday night games will begin at the regular time of 7:05 p.m.. Sundays will also remain the same with May and June Sunday games beginning at 1:05 p.m. and July, August and September games scheduled to begin at 5:05 p.m.\n\nWhile most league teams remain the same for the upcoming season, the Rox will face a new league opponent located in Nashua, N.H. The American Defenders of New Hampshire have replaced the Nashua Pride. The league will also operate a yet-to-be-named team based in Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nAll Rox season ticket and mini-plan options are on sale with the opportunity to book luxury suites, picnics and groups for any date on the 2009 schedule.\n\nFor more information, call the Rox at 508-559-7000 or visit www.brocktonrox.com.\n\nHernandez gets call from Phillies:\n\nThe Rox also announced that the World Series champion Philadelphia Phillies have purchased the contract of righthanded pitcher Santo Hernandez. Hernandez was acquired by the Rox last August and made three starts with them.\n\nHernadez was the top pitcher for the Laredo Broncos in the United League in 2008 before coming to the Rox. He posted an 8-6 record with a league-best 3.55 ERA. He also topped all pitchers with 132 strikeouts.\n\nThe 24-year of native of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, was originally signed as a non-drafted free agent by the Colorado Rockies in 2000 and spent two seasons in the Rockies organization."
