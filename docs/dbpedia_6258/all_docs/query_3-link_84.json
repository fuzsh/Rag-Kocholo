        "text": "TROY, NY - On Wednesday, the Tri-City ValleyCats announced their full coaching staff for the 2023 season. As previously announced, Pete Incaviglia will return for his third season as Field Manager. Thomas Incaviglia will return for his third season as the ValleyCats’ Third Base and Bench Coach. Former New Jersey Jackals Field Manager Brooks Carey has signed on as the team’s Pitching Coach.\n\nIncaviglia, a native of Argyle, Texas returns to lead the ValleyCats for his third season. As the skipper of the ‘Cats over the last two seasons, Incaviglia has amassed a 102-86 record. In his second season at the helm of the ValleyCats, Incaviglia became the third manager in team history to eclipse the 100-win mark, joining Ed Romero and Gregg Langbehn. The infamous power hitter coached Tri-City hitters to a Frontier League-leading 162 home runs, and a .288 team batting average, the third best in the league in 2022.\n\nA 12-year MLB veteran with over 35 years of professional baseball experience, Pete Incaviglia enters his third season at the helm of the Tri-City ValleyCats. Since 2001, Incaviglia has held a variety of coaching and managing positions within professional baseball. This includes championships as a Field Manager in the Atlantic League (2018) and American Association (2015, 2011). His coaching experience also includes time in the Detroit Tigers farm system. Incaviglia’s most recent tenure was with the Sugar Land Skeeters, formerly of the Atlantic League. After serving as the team’s Field Manager since November of 2017, he became the Director of Baseball Operations for the Constellation League in Sugar Land, Texas.\n\nBrooks Carey joins the ValleyCats after spending the past 4 seasons as the New Jersey Jackals’ Field Manager. Over the course of his time at the helm of the Jackals, Carey captured a 2019 Can-Am League championship, and became the franchise’s second-winningest manager of all-time, with 182 wins. Prior to joining the Jackals, Carey was the skipper of the Normal CornBelters, a former member of the Frontier League. Carey led the franchise to their first-ever winning season, and in 4 seasons amassed a record of 248-230. Prior to his time as a manager, Carey served as the Pitching Coach for the Sussex Skyhawks (2008 & 2009), the Normal CornBelters (2010 & 2011), and the Evansville Otters (2012). Before pursuing coaching in the world of professional baseball, Carey led Key West High School, his alma mater, to a 1998 Florida state title. Carey, a starting pitcher drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 10th round of the 1978 MLB Draft out of Florida State University, reached Triple-A in both the Baltimore Orioles and Cincinnati Reds organizations. Over the course of his five-year professional playing career, Carey tallied a 3.75 ERA in 683.2 innings pitched.\n\nThe nephew of manager Pete Incaviglia, Thomas Incaviglia enters his third season as the Third Base and Bench Coach for the Tri-City ValleyCats. Incaviglia played professionally for the Grand Prairie AirHogs of the American Association for two seasons, and played collegiately at Oklahoma State, Texas, and Cal State Monterey Bay, winning an NCAA Division I National Championship with the Longhorns. Thomas has spent the offseason gaining managerial experience in the California Winter League, the Official Winter League of the Frontier League."
