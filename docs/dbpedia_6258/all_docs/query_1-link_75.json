He played in Indianapolis in 1954 and then in Detroit from 1955-58.\n\nSierra was then drafted into the U.S. Army and became a top pitcher for the Fort Hood Tankers. In the 1961 season, he had a no-hitter and 1.75 ERA, and led the team to the Army championship.\n\nAfter he left the Army, Sierra continued to play baseball, including stints with Minnesota Twins and Washington Senators farm teams and the Provincial League in Quebec.\n\nIn 1976, Sierra left baseball, enrolled in college and eventually got a job working with at-risk youths in Washington, D.C.\n\nHe has worked as a pitching coach since 2002, first with the Pennsylvania Roadwarriors, then with the LaNew Bears of the Chinese Professional Baseball League in Taiwan and the Sussex Skyhawks of the Can-Am League."
