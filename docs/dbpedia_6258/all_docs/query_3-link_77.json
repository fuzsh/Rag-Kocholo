The game begins at 7:05 vs. Quebec who sits atop the Can Am League only two games ahead of the Tornadoes entering the weekend.\n\nOn August 13th at 7:05, The Tornadoes again play host to Quebec and present the most anticipated promotional giveaway of the season; Peterman Bobbleheads, presented by St. Vincents Hospital.\n\nEach miniature bobbling Peterman stands at seven inches tall and will come with his signature microphone and rally jacket. Peterman (Dave) is the Vice President and Director of Sales for the Tornadoes and the popular voice of the Tornadoes.\n\nThe game on August 14 against the Sussex Skyhawks will begin at 7:05 and features the most individual promotions this summer during any single night.\n\nFor the Tornadoes younger fans, Charter Communications will be bringing Spongebob Squarepants to the ballpark, while our older fans, will meet award winning Boston Globe journalist and author Larry Tye, who will be at Hanover Insurance Park to talk about his new book Satchel: The Life and Times of an American Legend.\n\nLarry’s well-researched story covers one of Baseball’s legends, Satchel Paige, whose 40-year pitching career included over 2,000 Wins and 50 Shutouts.\n\nThe evening ends with another great Fireworks Friday presented by Price Chopper and Atlas Fireworks.\n\nThe Worcester Tornadoes’ Fifth Anniversary Season is currently underway and tens of thousands of fans have already enjoyed a game at Hanover Insurance Park at Fitton Field.\n\nWith the Worcester Tornadoes battling Quebec for first place in the Can-Am League, and lots of great promotions coming up, Tornadoes tickets are going faster than ever.
