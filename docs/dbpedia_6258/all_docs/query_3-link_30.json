        "text": "We have the official announcement of pro baseball returning to Skylands Stadium in Sussex County, N.J., as a new independent Can-Am League team will play 55 home games starting mid-May through Labor Day.\n\nThe new team gives the league six teams. Two new teams — Sussex County and the Ottawa Champions — will join the New Jersey Jackals, the Quebec Capitales, Rockland Boulders and the Aigles of Trois-Rivières. In a press release, new Sussex County team owners called the Can-Am League revitalized, and we’d agree: Six strong teams bode well for a good 2015.\n\n“With this new Can-Am team, we are dedicated to delivering a high caliber of baseball for the entire community to enjoy. At Skylands Stadium, fans can indulge in great baseball, food and drinks in major-league caliber facilities – all at minor league prices,” said Al Dorso Sr., president of Skylands Stadium. “Our field is in top condition, our concession stand is fully stocked and our comfort facilities are spotless. We look forward to welcoming fans, and sponsors, to our very own New Jersey field of dreams.”\n\nThe stadium is encouraging all members of the community to visit its Facebook page, to make suggestions for a team name and mascot, as well as for entertainment and attractions they would like to see at games. Tickets for the 2015 season will go on sale on Black Friday, Nov. 28, at SkylandsStadium.com, including season tickets and special family deals.\n\nBuilt in 1994, Skylands Stadium is located in the heart of rural Sussex County in Frankford Township, (Augusta) New Jersey. Skylands Stadium LLC Management purchased the stadium in 2013, including the 4,200-seat ballpark, a 16,000-square foot all-purpose building and the surrounding 28 acres. The ballpark has upgraded concessions, restroom facilities and seating areas, as well as the playing field, club house and locker rooms. A new 5,000-square foot pavilion has been erected down the first base line. A special box has been designated for members of the media.\n\nAn 18,000-square foot exhibit hall will be completed this winter, and an in-house catering facility will be open for business by spring 2015.\n\nPhoto by Mark Cryan."
