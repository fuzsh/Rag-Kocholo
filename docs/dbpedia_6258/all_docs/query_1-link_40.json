Jamie and Amy are quality people. They listened to our needs and created a lot of really great options to consider. We were under a tight time line and they were flexible enough to get the job done. I know that we will be able to use the logo family for many years to come.” Kelly Higgins, Commissioner, The ACAA Conference\n\nOn Work for the ACAA Conference, The American Collegiate Athletics Association \"We had a fantastic experience working with Jamie and Amy. From the first call to the finished product we were never treated like the smaller, upstart DIII conference that we are. We were under tight budget and time constraints and PDW was able to make it work. When I look at our finished product it looks like we are a top DI program. My only regret is the process was over so quickly, I want to work with Jamie and Amy again.\" Jon J. Martin, Associate Commissioner, American Collegiate Athletic Association\n\nOn Work for Adelphi University \"It is my sincere pleasure to submit this letter of reference for Phoenix Design Works. Adelphi University, a private university located in Garden City, New York, recently embarked upon the most ambitious construction project in the University’s history since moving to its present location in 1929. A cornerstone of this $113 million overall project, is a new 76,000 square-foot recreation and sports center that will become the new home for our intramural and intercollegiate athletics program, and presented the perfect occasion to embark upon a comprehensive branding and identify campaign for the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics. Understanding the importance and visibility of this project, as well as the need for an experienced team familiar with the diverse constituencies of athletics, we issued an RFP for identity concepts including a complete overhaul of the image of the Department, logos for our 20 teams, and an identity for the new sports center. Phoenix offered a compelling concept and approach right form the start. While their designs captured the imagination of the selection committee, it was their deep understanding about how to engage our student athletes, senior management, alumni, students, and faculty and staff in the redesign process to garner feedback, develop buy in, and create excitement and momentum that sealed the deal for us. Over the course of the project, PDW created a suite of assets that has allowed us to completely rebrand our athletics programs. (See attached samples of old and new logos.) Throughout the process, the Phoenix team was very responsive to our needs and delivered designs that exceeded our expectations on a schedule that was faster than we anticipated. We had a new identity for intercollegiate athletics in under 12 weeks. Beyond their extraordinary talent and passion, it is the depth of expertise that Phoenix brought to the table that allowed this project to have legs within our organization. Although undertaken initially as a logo redesign project, Phoenix has empowered our intercollegiate athletics staff to think bigger. Prior to engaging Phoenix, merchandising and licensing was an opportunity left our bookstore vendor. Empowered by the quality of the assets and the knowledge gleaned from the Adelphi/PDW partnership, our athletics department is embarking upon a new business model that has potential to generate revenue to support their efforts. This type of planning was not part of the department’s thinking prior to their work with Phoenix, and has potential to profoundly change their operations. Our athletics program faced an additional challenge that Phoenix helped us address. Media coverage for Division II programs in a competitive media market like New York is scarce. In order to raise the profile of our teams, the University is planning an advertising buy for our programs-the first paid marketing effort ever undertaken in the program’s history. Phoenix is working with us to build a true integrated marketing effort by developing ad concepts to support this media buy. The Phoenix partnership has been a powerful and exciting one for Adelphi University. Their creative talent, depth of expertise, and professionalism are exceptional in the creative marketplace. I would be happy to discuss our project further and recommend them without reservation.\" Lori Duggan Gold, Vice President for Communications, Adelphi University\n\nOn Work for Adelphi University \"Midnight Madness was a huge success. Thank you for all that you did. The students liked it and we look forward to next year's event. Thanks again for everything!\" Georgette D. Brown, M.A., Event Manager/Special Projects Assistant, Adelphi University Center for Recreation & Sports\n\nOn Work for the University of Alabama Crimson Tide Athletics \"Jamie and Phoenix created the first advertising campaign we've ever run for the Crimson Tide. The results were unbelievably successful and exceeded everyone's wildest expectations. Phoenix took us through the creative and exploratory process as a department, and then presented us with a strategic plan and executions to address our first, second, and third level goals and concerns. As I said to Jamie at the time, Phoenix completely knocked it out of the park at every turn of the project! We were concerned about ticket sales in the wake of a couple of losing seasons and 15,000 new seats coming online with our end zone development project, and we were concerned with paying for the campaign when we had no budget strictly allocated for funding, since we had never done a campaign before. The results of Phoenix's campaign for us was a our first sell-out ticket season in fourteen years, a 20,000 person wait list for season tickets, and half the people buying tickets had never bought a ticket for a university event before. Plus, Phoenix worked out merchandise platforms for turning the ads into merchandise that we could sell to pay for the placement of our advertising, making the campaign pay for itself! Phoenix was totally amazing for us, and we couldn't be happier with their performance - We love Phoenix and recommend them for branding and advertising to everyone without reservation - They're awesome!\" Johnny Williams, Associate Athletic Director, Crimson Tide Athletics, University of Alabama\n\nOn Work for the American Southwest Conference \"Phoenix Design Works took the lead in creating a look for the American Southwest Conference that incorporated key elements of the original logo into an updated and energized look for the conference, our championships and sports programs. The exchange of ideas back and forth made for a good working relationship in addition to a great branding campaign.\" Amy Carlton, Commissioner, American Southwest Conference\n\nOn Work for the American Southwest Conference \"It was a pleasure to work with Amy and the entire Phoenix Design Works staff. We couldn't be happier with out finished product and have heard nothing but positive feedback from those who have seen and used it. This was the first logo change in the American Southwest Conference's 15-year history so we wanted to make sure all the right elements were used in creating it. Phoenix Design Works nailed it. Not only that, but they were always there to talk on the phone or respond through e-mail when you needed them. Proofs were turned around in a very timely manner and they never got frustrated when we couldn't make up our minds on minor details. If you are looking to market your school, conference or business with a new logo, Phoenix Design Works is the way to go!\" Greg Weghorst, ASC Assistant Commissioner/Director of Media Relations, American Southwest Conference\n\nOn Work for the University of Arkansas \"Please accept this letter as a recommendation of Phoenix Design Works from the University of Arkansas. In 2001, the University of Arkansas contracted with Phoenix to update the Razorback logo, design a new Razorback logo and associated word marks. The results were top notch. The staff of Phoenix Design Works and Jamie Skiles, were very sensitive to the tradition of the Arkansas Razorback. They met all deadlines with ease and were very easy to work with in discussing design direction and ideas. We knew when we talked with Phoenix Design Works, we knew we were talking to the creative people, not some middle man. That aspect in itself made the logo design/redesign process much smoother. At the end of the process, the University of Arkansas got what it was looking for. We were extremely pleased with the working relationship with Phoenix Design Works. The final products from Phoenix also met the expectations and desires of the University of Arkansas. It is without hesitation we recommend Phoenix Design Works. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call.\" Matt Shanklin, Associate Athletic Director, Marketing and Licensing, University of Arkansas\n\nOn Work for the University of Arkansas \"On behalf of the University of Arkansas, I would like to express how much we have enjoyed our relationship with Phoenix Design Works.

The University of Arkansas has been very happy to have the opportunity to work with Phoenix Design Works.\" Matt Shanklin, Assistant Athletic Director, University of Arkansas\n\nOn Work for Arkansas State University “Phoenix did splendid work for us. At the final we rendered a mascot internally, but your excellent work throughout provided standards to narrow our selection to ”Red Wolves\" and your consultation helped us clarify the type of mark and marketing we desired. We were highly pleased with all of the services you rendered for us, and we commend you for a job well done. Thank you so much for your hard work and friendship.” Robert L. Potts, Chancellor, Arkansas State University\n\nOn Work for Assumption College “Thanks to Amy and everyone at Phoenix Design Works for all of their help with the redesign of our athletics logo and branding of Assumption College athletics. They listened to our needs and feedback and developed a comprehensive branding program that will help unify the look of our athletic programs through the use of this graphic identity program. Phoenix Design Works was a pleasure to work with and I highly recommend them to any college or university looking to go through a similar rebranding process.” Ken Johnson, Jr., Assistant Director of Athletics for Communications, Assumption College\n\nOn Work for the Atlanta Christian College \"We have had a wonderful experience working with Phoenix Design Works. They have handled our branding project quickly and professionally, and have been flexible in meeting our college's needs. The end results of our project are exactly what we wanted, and we are thrilled to be able to unveil such great design to our campus. I'm confident that the mascot and other marks Phoenix Design Works created for us will help create a strong athletic identity for Atlanta Christian College for years to come.\" Sarah Huxford, Director of Communications and Alumni Relations, Atlanta Christian College\n\nOn Work for the Atlantic Sun Conference “We’ve been very pleased with all the work Phoenix Design has done for us and we’ve continued to work with them ever since our initial name change project began in 2001. We get treated with customized programs and the support has always been there whenever we need it. Jamie Skiles treats all his customers the same, top personal priorities. There is no doubt that Phoenix has outstanding design talent and the technical capabilities to deliver whatever you could need, but the difference is the personal attention. We continue to work with them today and would encourage anyone who was looking for great results with a team that listens to the client to give Jamie a call.” Bill Bibb, Commissioner, Atlantic Sun Conference\n\nOn Work for the Atlantic Sun Conference \"Our friends at Phoenix took the time to learn what we needed and why and guided us through the entire design process. They really cared about us and our project and we were pleased with every aspect of the working relationship.\" Ted Gumbart, Assistant Commissioner, Atlantic Sun Conference On Work for the Atlantic Sun Conference “We have a number of initiatives moving forward on the marketing front and refreshing our championship marks makes perfect sense at this point. We’ve enjoyed a great partnership with Phoenix Design Works since the debut of the Atlantic Sun logo and we’re proud to introduce these new championship designs.” Ted Gumbart, Commissioner, Atlantic Sun Conference\n\nOn Work for the Atlantic 10 Conference “I would like to thank both Amy and Jamie Skiles over at Phoenix Design Works for all the work that they’ve done to date for the Atlantic 10 Conference. They are true professionals with a thorough understanding of the sports business and the needs of their clients. With their experience and understanding of the business I’ve found it extremely easy to convey my vision to them with very little explanation and received results that were well beyond expectations. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to re-brand their business or develop new marks. I look forward to working with the team at PDW on future projects.” Duane Bailey, Associate Commissioner/Chief Financial Officer, Atlantic 10 Conference\n\nOn Work for the Atlantic 10 Conference “You guys are too much!!

We have taken a HUGE step forward with our new slogan ‘Prey Together’ on a global scale, and the BC and BCU logos alike have both been instrumental in our efforts. Our new BC and BCU logos are now the standard for all Bethune-Cookman University Athletics, and Phoenix Design Works was at the core. Their work speaks for itself. We are truly glad to speak for them and say ‘They truly outdid themselves’, and we appreciate everything they did for us. We now have a brand, and we have a format, and we have a standard. No longer are we asked if we are Boston College. They now know OUR BC and BCU logos as Bethune-Cookman University.

Harvey, Assistant Athletic Director, Communications, Bethune-Cookman University\n\nOn Work for the Big West Conference \"We were very impressed with the quality of the work, particularly on such short notice.

We are thrilled with our new Bridgewater Eagle!” Abbie Parkhurst, Director of Marketing and Communications, Bridgewater College\n\nOn Work for Bridgewater State College “The process of creating a new mark for Bridgewater State Athletics and Recreation was an enjoyable partnership with Phoenix Designworks that actually took less time than I had anticipated.

We enjoyed working with Phoenix’ staff and are pleased with the final product.” John Harper, Athletic Director, Bridgewater State College\n\nOn Work for Bridgewater State College \"We fell upon Phoenix Design Works through their ad in Athletics Administration Magazine. It was the best thing we could have done in contacting their team. We never needed to look at any other companies after our first meeting.

We began this project because we wanted to better represent the university’s spirit and mission, and to establish a sense of distinctiveness. We wanted to offer a new and vibrant image for the campus, and to reinforce our identity.

Your creativity and professionalism has shined throughout the process. You provided great creative in a tight timeframe on budget. We are very pleased with the end result and believe that the design will be a showpiece for our branding campaign. Many thanks.” Scott Mitchell, Director of Marketing, UCLA\n\nOn Work for the University of California, Merced \"As a very young, three year old campus, we were not sure what we were getting into when we decided to enter the branding process for our soon to be athletic department. We were very fortunate to engage Phoenix Design Works for this project, and from that point forward we have had an amazing experience! The Phoenix team was phenomenal in the way that they captured the look, feel and attitude that we seeking to find for our Bobcat. What was even more impressive is how they captured this before their campus visit! Through a well-designed survey and many great phone conversations, their team was able to create an amazing array of options to choose from. It was as if Amy, Jamie and their team had visited our campus and spent hours talking with our students, faculty and staff to find out exactly who the Bobcats were. The experience with Phoenix goes beyond their creative talent. Amy and Jamie were very patient in guiding us through a completely new process for many members of our campus. From designing our primary mark, our visual mark, uniforms and court designs, their team was always available and willing to answer every question. I always felt that I was getting their unbiased opinion and that they were truly engaged in our process and that it was more than just another contract for them. Our students love our new Bobcat design-it captures the spirit of our students and it gives our student athletes a fierce mascot to rally around! Our department and campus could not be happier with the outcome of this process as it has added credibility and a sense of pride to our programs. It was a tremendous amount of fun to work with such a creative group of folks. We felt open to honestly sharing our thoughts and feelings throughout the process. I think that open communication was one of the keys to such a successful outcome. I highly recommend the Phoenix Design Works team to anyone that is looking to create a new image or just refine their current image. I would be happy to discuss my experience working with Amy and her team at any time.\" David Dunham, Director, Recreation & Athletics, UC Merced\n\nOn Work for the University of California, Santa Barbara \"We needed a branding system that would represent our blend of locale, unique mascot and success in the classroom and competition. Phoenix has a proven track record of taking branding marks from the smallest application to the fullest logo. We couldn't be more happy. Their idea of the Gaucho hat leading the way for our brand is both creative and exciting.\" Mark Massari, Director of Athletics, UCSB Gaucho Athletics\n\nOn Work for the University of California, Santa Barbara Please accept this as a letter of endorsement for Jamie and his crew at Phoenix Design. In 2010, we conducted a search for a creative agency to handle a re-design and re-branding of our primary and secondary marks. Ultimately, and to our benefit, we selected phoenix for the project. Jamie and his team quickly immersed themselves in our project, taking time and care to research the history of our campus, consider our previous marks, strengths and weaknesses, and understand the traits that make our campus unique. The end result has been incredibly positive and been received very well across our campus community and fan base. I am available to answer any questions in support of Phoenix. Tom Hastings, Deputy Director of Athletics, UCSB Gaucho Athletics\n\nOn Work for the Casper College Thunderbirds \"We're having great fun rolling out the new Thunderbirds marks created by Phoenix Design Works. They helped us secure a great outcome to the project. Their process to listen to our students, fans, faculty, staff and other community members minimized the inevitable grumbling. The WOW factor that Phoenix injected into our final design is making all the difference in getting everyone to embrace the new design. The only problem so far has been having to say no to all those who want to steal our athletic logo for the general college logo! I just got a call from the first vendor to receive the new logo. He made a special call, with a slightly freaked out demeanor, to say, 'Wow, that is a beautiful bird! That is going to look unbelievably good. Wow!' He had already sold us the job, so that wasn't the reason. Also, on K2 News, the two news anchors editorialized after the story to say, 'Wow, I LOVE that new logo. It is so cool.' That is the kind of effect that we were all hoping for.\" Rich Fujita, Director of College Relations, Casper College\n\nOn Work for Chicago State University “The lack of a word mark for the department was creating inconsistencies from team to team in how we represented ourselves. The crew at Phoenix Design Works helped us put together a comprehensive package of marks which we can use on uniforms, apparel, print materials and the web.\" Dan Schumacher, Athletic Director, Chicago State University\n\nOn Work for CUNY, City College of New York I am honored to write this letter for Phoenix Design Works. I had the privilege six years ago to be introduced to Amy and Jamie Skiles while working at CCNY, in New York City. They were extremely helpful in creating a package of logos for our program. Phoenix Design Works is without question one of the finest companies I have ever had the opportunity to work with. It is without reservation that I recommend Phoenix Design Works as possessing the qualities and competencies necessary to create a package that your institution will be happy with for year to come. Robert J. Coleman, Director of Athletics, CUNY, City College of New York\n\nOn Work for Clarkson University \"In a crowded marketplace where schools are competing to recruit athletes a polished image can give one school the advantage over another school with a comparable athletic program. This is an exciting time to be a Clarkson Golden Knight. Our new athletic marks and logos truly capture the tradition and excellence of Clarkson Athletics. The process to bring us to this point was a comprehensive one and I feel fortunate to have been involved with the final outcome. We as an Athletics Department could not have put together such a professional group of images without the support of our faculty, students, alumni, and staff. I want to give a special thanks to Phoenix Design Works for all of their hard work in making this happen. I look forward to seeing our new marks and logos represent our department and institution for many years to come.\" Sean Frazier, Athletic Director, Clarkson University\n\nOn Work for Coker College “Phoenix Design did an excellent job with the design of our new Cobra and branding program.

It was a long and sometimes exhausting process to make this selection, but I am confident that the entire Mount Saint Vincent community will be as excited as I am by this new Brand. Phoenix Design Works is renowned as the industry leader in the development of Athletics Brands and they really made our Dolphin come to life.

I was skeptical at first because no one had been able to achieve this seemingly simple task. In a very short time, I became a believer. Phoenix Design Works accomplished a miracle, and Fordham has its new ram! Throughout the process, Amy and Jamie Skiles have been wonderful. They listened carefully; asked insightful questions; and brought a wide variety of people to consensus. Their enthusiasm for the project was infectious, and time and time again they provided many more creative designs than we could have imagined.

Then they worked with us through a number of revisions until they presented the Highlander design and logo package we have today. We are pleased with the work they did and are excited about incorporating the new look into our marketing efforts. Houghton College has been wrestling with how to best present ourselves to our different constituencies and to the public in general. It was important, given the breadth of exposure we receive from our athletic teams, that we have a consistent way of presenting ourselves in that venue as well.
