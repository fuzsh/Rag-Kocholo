        "text": "It is fascinating this time of year to project which Independent Baseball graduates may get called up to the major leagues when rosters expand starting September 1. The nail-biting must be something for those players who have never gotten that rush before, and feel they are deserving.\n\nIt is not as simple for the major league decision-makers as merely adding another person to collect meal money and occupy an additional hotel room on the road. Making room on the 40-man roster is one primary issue since many of those who have just turned in a solid minor league season and seem deserving may not already have one of those spots. When to make the call is another issue since the playerâ€™s team may well be in its league playoffs. And, does the player really fit into the future plans or would the call-up be largely out of sentiment and for fill-in purposes.\n\nBut, it is fascinating. So why not go out on the limb and make our own selections.\n\nChris Jakubauskas would seem to be a natural with Seattle since he was there the entire seasonâ€”his rookie big league campaignâ€”until last weekend. That is unless his key right shoulder really is hurting, and this longtime Indy leaguer would be better off resting until next spring. Fans in Jakubauskasâ€™s Indy past, would be happy to see him return. This means Lincoln, NE of the American Association, Orange County (Fullerton, CA) of the Golden League and Frontier League teams in Florence, KY and Ohio Valley.\n\nMichel Hernandez (Somerset, NJ, Atlantic) would seem to be another highly probable candidate because he was with Tampa Bay all season until the Rays acquired the veteran Greg Zaun recently, and it would seem Joe Maddonâ€™s club could use a third catcher for its postseason drive. One would think reliever Josh Kinney (River City, Oâ€™Fallon, MO, Frontier League) would be another natural, especially since he has postseason experience with St. Louis and his last eight appearances at Triple-A (Memphis) have been scoreless.\n\nOf those we see as candidates, one popular choice would have to be lefty-hitting outfielder Jon Weber with Tampa Bay, and not just for the sentimental reason that the 31-year-old has never been in the majors except for extensive spring training at-bats. Weber, who prepped years ago at Fargo, ND (Northern League) and Canton, OH (Frontier), has collected 44 doubles for Durham, NC of the International League this season, a very attractive number when compared to that of American League leader Brian Roberts, who has an impressive 48. Weber is hitting .303 with 14 home runs and 65 RBI.\n\nEdwar Ramirez (Pensacola, FL, now an American Association city, and Edinburg, TX, United League) could return to the New York Yankeesâ€™ bullpen after continuing to rack up strikeouts (61 in 49.1 innings) at Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, PA. Philadelphia also could bring corner infielder-DH Mike Cervenak (Chillicothe, OH, Frontier) back like it did last season. He has hit .289 and driven in 70 runs at Lehigh Valley, PA and has only fanned 40 times in 415 at-bats. Atlanta might consider veteran southpaw John Halama as an extra starter. He has gone 4-6, 4.61 in Triple-A since leaving the Atlantic League earlier this season (Southern Maryland, Waldorf). He also has pitched for Long Island, NY in the same league. And, Oakland might want to look at reliever Scott Patterson (Lancaster, PA, Atlantic, and Gateway, Sauget, IL, Frontier) since he was just acquired from the San Diego organization.\n\nIt would make sense that Houston might want to give veteran closer Armando Benitez a look to see if his summerâ€™s work at Newark, NJ in the Atlantic League (1-0, 16 saves, 2.86 ERA, 43 strikeouts and only 21 hits in 34.2 innings) paid off, but the big guy got bombed for four home runs in a single inning in his debut at Triple-A Round Rock, TX earlier this week.\n\n* * * *\n\nSTILL LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT BASEBALL COVERAGE? VISIT OUR BLOG, www.IndyBaseballChatter.com\n\n* * * *\n\n34-Year-Old Rookie Up to the Task in York\n\nIt had to be an enjoyable night in York, PA Wednesday except for the Revolution dropping its Atlantic League game to the Newark (NJ) Bears, 7-6. The Revolution had been promoting the game because they had just signed a hurler they said was â€œwidely considered the greatest local pitcher of his generation.â€ Not a youngster, of course. Shawn Hedrick is 34 and is said to have won more than 150 games, most recently in the amateur Susquehanna League.\n\nHedrick did not disappoint. He had York even with Newark at 2-2 after six innings, and the â€œpinpointâ€ control he was said to exhibit held up. Hedrick did not walk anyone in his 6.1 innings as he came away without a decision.\n\nCan-Am League, Nashua Take a Hit\n\nThe Can-Am League, down to six teams this season, took another one on the chin when Nashua, NH town officials locked the gates on the American Defenders of New Hampshire, almost certainly ending their one-year stay as the latest occupant of Holman Stadium.\n\nSome $45,000 in back rent and pay for security brought an immediate end to the season in Nashua, and after one forfeit, the Defenders played a â€œhomeâ€ doubleheader in Brockton, MA and are scheduled to transfer their last four scheduled home games to Augusta, NJ, where the Sussex Skyhawks play. In analyzing the season, Nashua Telegraph writer Joe Marchilena said â€œtheir biggest mistake was assuming that this community would latch onto a team with a military theme.â€"
