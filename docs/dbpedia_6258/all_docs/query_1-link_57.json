In 2000, Lester struck a deal with the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, to work on a study on African-American baseball from the Civil War through the 1950s called “Out of the Shadows.” (Photo: Courtesy of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum) - President Obama met with Negro League baseball players.",
