        "text": "Hello,\n\nAfter living in Hackettstown for almost 5 years, we are moving to Frankford. Any secret gems or secrets about that area?\n\nAt least it's not too far from Hackettstown and I will still be browsing this site.\n\nA client of mine had a dream home there. Beautiful new construction hill top view, horses down at the end of the driveway, quiet and peaceful as it gets. But he said he needed a plow to get anywhere in winter, and absolutely everything was 10 miles away. I'd get to know Newton very very well.\n\nOuchie.\n\nWell Newton is very close and it offers everything that hackettstown does... Well except for the locally owned stores.\n\nDoes the city not plow?\n\nDa Stix. Beautiful country, but the country. Know someone near Layayette with a good chunk of land and he sells x-mas trees to keep the farm assessment. Kind of cool if you like playing with a John Deere tractor...\n\nNewton has a fair amount of locally owned stores on Spring Street. Newton has also been recognized nationally for really turning the town around and focusing on its history and bringing smaller stores in. It is always a work in progress. The \"large brand name stores\" are actually in Hampton. I grew up in Sussex County and it does have its positives and negatives, depending upon where you live.\n\nBranchville actually has a really good Mexican restaurant called Riviera Maya right on 206. Jumboland Diner is a well-known diner out there as well. Walpack Inn is out in Sandyston and has some decent food. The Chatterbox isn't too far away where Rt. 15 and 206 meet. You won't be too far from the Fairgrounds, the baseball stadium, Stokes State Park (camping/hiking). You could also always drive to Mt. Creek, the mines in Franklin and Hamburg, go to the Sussex Inn in Sussex. There isn't a lot right in Frankford, but the surrounding towns have little places to visit/eat at.\n\nPlowing depends strictly on each town. The last snowstorm, I drove from Sussex (all the way by Wantage/High Point), through Augusta, through Newton, Andover, and Green w/out a single issue and the roads perfectly salted. Then I crossed over into Warren County and the roads were horrible.\n\nNewton will end up being your big go-to place since there isn't a lot in general out there. Depending upon if you love shopping, expect going to the mall to take quite a bit more time.\n\nFujixt1 is it too late to change your mind? I am in the next town over (Sandyston) and it is horrible up here. I have been up here 10 years because my wife wanted to live near her parents. If I had to do it over again I would have never down it. I am counting down the days until 2027 when my daughter graduates high school so we can move down south.\n\nAre you retired or will you be commuting to work? There is not much in the way of work up this way so the roads are filled with pushy PA drivers everyday. My wife and I both worked in Morristown. On a good day we were 1.5 hours to work. Traffic gets backed up around Lafayette....then near Jefferson....then you got the whole route 80 mess. Then in the summertime Friday nights are traffic jams with all the people heading out to PA for the weekend. The population has been declining up this way. http://www.njherald.com/story/27371489/2014/11/12/tough-challenge-reverse-trend-of-declining-county-population\n\nThe taxes are a little cheaper up here but for what you get, but it doesn't seem to be a bargain. Everyone has wells, and septics. No city sewer and water (Branchville has been trying to get this for 20+ years I think). No natural gas so you are forced to use propane or oil. The roads however are never a problem in this area, the road departments are very good up this way. The one thing I would recommend if coming up this way is to purchase a generator. In the past 5 years we have had 3 power outages for 6+ days. Seems like electric companies focus where they can turn larger groups of people on at a time. Like previous posters stated Newton is where you would go to shop. Probably only a 15-20 minute drive from wherever you end up.\n\nAny other good things you'd like to hear about?\n\nM & K âœ‰\n\nDec '14\n\nWell I don't think I would want to live there if I knew I had to travel on 80 east in the mornings. You know there will be traffic.\n\nWhere I work and my wife, we will have no problem with commuting.\n\nSeptic or well doesn't bother me one bit... I hate oil but that's what I have now anyways. I called Elizabeth town gas and they are thinking of putting a line on my street.\n\nThe power could be a problem but I won't know until I live there. Different towns, different power grids... you never know.\n\nI love the outdoors and peacefulness. I want my toys too! (riding lawn mower!!)\n\nOur view is amazing and goes on for as long as the eye can see.\n\nI am super excited!\n\nBecause it's the country, a generator is another thing to make sure you get.\n\nAs for the plowing I mentioned, a good part of that is the 300 foot driveway that came with the house, and that the road it was on was by no means a major thruway. The horse farm across the street from him was pretty self sufficient so the town wouldn't plow until other places were done. But no town plowing is going to get you out when you've got 300 feet of your own to worry about. It's the nature of the country.\n\nThank you GC.\n\nI will get a generator for sure.\n\nWell the driveway is no bigger than your usual driveway. Also the road we are on is not a major road but I have seen school busses on it.\n\nI probably shouldn't have been so negative in my post. Most people up this way that have lived here their whole lives like it here. They don't feel the same way I do. I just hate it because I had to give up a career and the convenience of having things I need nearby just so we can live here. I couldn't deal with leaving for work at 5 in the morning and getting home at 7 at night.\n\nI wish you well with your move to the area and hope your experience is better than mine.\n\nM & K âœ‰\n\nDec '14\n\nHolland American Bakery on Rt 23 is lovely. Have been going there since I was a child with my Dutch grandparents. They would eat no other bread. We still go there now a couple times a year as a treat.\n\nI have lived in Lafayette for 22 years and commute to Hackettstown. Winters up here can be tough, especially if the power goes out. We do get a fair amount of snow, but they do a great job of clearing the roads. Stores are a schlep but after awhile you learn to combine trips (like stopping at Shop Rite and Home Depot on the way home from work). And yes, the commute to \"down below\" is a nightmare. My son worked in Newark for a few months and the traffic just wore him out. But for me, I wouldn't want to live anywhere else in NJ.\n\nCent Prof âœ‰\n\nDec '14\n\nThank you for the comments.\n\nWe would commute to Sparta and it takes about 20min to get to my work.\n\nIf you go back and forth to Sparta, check out the Jefferson Diner ... it is my favorite whenever I'm going that way.\n\nAndy Loigu âœ‰\n\nDec '14\n\nAndy my friend owns the Jefferson diner :)\n\nAnd if they are going from Branchville to Sparta I don't think they will be going past theJefferson Diner\n\nJohn C âœ‰\n\nDec '14\n\nGrowing up spent many a weekend in that area. Relatives still have a house in Crandon Lakes not too far away. Remember Jumboland in the 70's as a small takeout place before it was converted to a sitdown Diner. Jelly donuts from Worthington's Bakery... YUM!\n\nAlways loved rides up to Sunrise Mountain. Had my first legal drink in the early 90's at what is now Stokes Steakhouse and Pub.\n\nWe were looking for houses in that area about 5 years ago. Eventually decided against it as it was too far from Route 80 for my work commute. I remember some years ago there was talk of a large Mall going in around the Ross Corner area (Rt 15 & 206 near the Chatterbox). I remember many residents in the County thankfully were fighting it. Does anyone know what ever came of it?\n\nJust an update...\n\nMy wife and I moved to Branchville in January and... we love it. Our house is amazing and I have over 2 acres. Built a huge fenced in veggie garden. The roads were amazingly cleared during this past winter, not a single problem and no power outages.\n\nI have been to some of the resturants that have been mentioned before and hands down, Riviera Maya is one of the top Mexican places I have been too.\n\nNewton is only a 6-7min drive away and it overs everything we need. Costco and Rockaway mall is an easy drive.\n\nI have attached a morning photo from my back deck.\n\nBeautiful view! A lovely area.\n\nA good day\n\nJun '15\n\nGlad to hear you are doing well fuji!\n\nThey brought minor league baseball back to the ballpark this year, so it really is a ballpark again ... the league is players on their way down, not prospects, but most people don't care about that ... fireworks displays on summer nights are a blast.\n\nIn 2009 when the Skyhawks played there, I threw out a first pitch --- reached the catcher, too. I actually heard someone in the stands cheer!\n\nAndy Loigu âœ‰\n\nJun '15\n\nThere is a place to eat across from the ballpark, looks like a farm stand and I can't recall the name. Wonderful healthy food, either self grown or local- sandwiches, salad, quiche, baked goods. I always look forward to stopping there when up that way.\n\nGlad you're happy up there fujixt1 ! I'm envious of that photo you posted.\n\nMust have been your wife Andy. ;-)\n\nThanks everyone! I forgot to mention we do miss hackettstown. I feel like a trader going in this board and not living there. Haha.\n\nHktownie- I don't know what it's called but my wife loves it. The food is not bad at all but it is pricey.\n\nI can see the ball park lights from my place and also the fireworks they have. I'll have to go catch a game there soon.\n\nYetter's Diner is right around the corner from the ballpark.\n\nGood coffee for the ride home after the game. I was there the night OJ took his ride in the white Bronco ... I'm sure you all remember where you were, too, that night.\n\nAndy Loigu âœ‰\n\nJun '15\n\nIn the summer of 2009 I was co-hosting a show called Sports Buzz on WNTI.\n\nMaybe my wife was the only one listening, but I was asked if I was going to be like George W. Bush at Yankee Stadium and go out there and throw a perfect strike.\n\nI answered, \"It'll be more like an Obama pitch, a change-up you can believe in.\"\n\nAndy Loigu âœ‰\n\nJun '15\n\nCalico, it wasn't Andy's wife it was Alex Ochoa.\n\nHtownie, that place is called Roseline's and they have a nice little place there. Delicious homemade pies in the summer and right across the road is that amazing sunflower maze!\n\nhttp://www.roselinesbakery.com/\n\nRosalines makes a great smoothie too! We went and caught a Miners game Tuesday night. We had a great time there and the tickets are cheap. Every Saturday night home game has fireworks and every Friday night home game has a movie afterwards. I think last week they showed Field Of Dreams. I hope it lasts this time....the new owners are certainly working hard to make it work.\n\nM & K âœ‰\n\nJun '15\n\nWhat a great view! When can I move in?:) Good luck in your new home.\n\nAndy, are you interested in sports at all?.... teasing..LOL"
