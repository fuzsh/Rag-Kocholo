        "text": "The new owner of Skylands Park admits he knows little about the baseball business but is excited at the prospect of bringing America's favorite pastime back to Sussex County. And prospects appear to be good that fans will be able to return to the mid-county stadium next spring.\n\nMark Roscioli, who invests in distressed properties and wireless infrastructure, had closed on some acreage in Andover Borough last year when his Realtor mentioned that the for-sale ballpark also had wireless assets. Roscioli said the asking price was too high but authorized the Realtor to submit a low-ball offer. The rest is not yet history, but it is history in the making.\n\nThe purchase of the ballpark, which last fielded a team in 2010, was closed recently at less than half the listing price.\n\nRoscioli got his wireless assets that are mounted atop three infield lighting standards. The ballpark just happened to come with it.\n\nBut the 32-year-old self-made businessman is not relying on a \"Buy it and they will come\" strategy.\n\nHe has talked to potential teams and hopes to solidify plans for a team, and maybe even two teams, to be here next spring. If agreements can't be reached in the next three to four months, he will look at \"something else\" that will include concerts and other activities that can be featured on the 28-acre grounds. He has already been in touch with persons knowledgeable of concert bookings to explore those opportunities.\n\nThe ball teams that could call Skylands Park home next year typically do not draw huge crowds — perhaps a couple hundred for a collegiate competition to a couple thousand for an independent-league team. That's a far cry from the 4,000, on average, who attended in the first season of the New Jersey Cardinals, a farm team of the National League St. Louis Cardinals. Even toward the end of the Cardinals' tenure, the crowds, though significantly smaller, still numbered well above 3,000.\n\nThe Sussex Skyhawks, which succeeded the Cardinals at Skylands Park as members of the independent Canadian-American League, enjoyed limited success on the field for a brief period but suffered a steep decline in attendance and ultimately disbanded after the 2010 season.\n\nBut although Skylands Park is the first and maybe only baseball stadium he will ever own, Roscioli understands that, at least on this level, it is not as much about the caliber of the team on the field as the experience of being in the ballpark.\n\nIn talking about getting the facility back in shape, Roscioli said he would be shooting for a \"wow experience.\" At every turn, he said, he would like fans to see something special.\n\nSince its opening in 1994, Skylands Park has drawn fans — not necessarily fans of the team itself (though a \"W\" for the home team is more satisfying than an \"L\"), but rather fans of the experience. Evenings at the ballpark offered a sense of community. Parents could bring their kids where they could meet up with friends and enjoy themselves without a video game controller in their hands. Retirees could get together for some camaraderie and enjoy a reasonably priced hot dog and soda. It was good, wholesome, outdoor entertainment, and the crowd turned into a big community family.\n\nAs proof it wasn't all about the game, the biggest draws without exception were nights with fireworks displays. Spectators would fill the stands and stay through even the most poorly played or lopsidedly scored games to watch the very impressive pyrotechnic displays. A close double play or home run was easily trumped by the between-inning mattress baby crawl race. Kids would race the bases against the team mascot. Everyone would rise from their seats when the Rally Cow was paraded by.\n\nHokey? Without a doubt. Fun? You bet.\n\nOn it's way back? We hope."
