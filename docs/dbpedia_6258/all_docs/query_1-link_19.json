        "text": "Todd Gossage’s baseball career is on hold.\n\nGossage, Hall of Famer Rich “Goose” Gossage’s youngest son, was released last month by the Sussex Skyhawks of the Canadian American League because of a broken arm.\n\nGossage said the injury occurred when he was fielding groundballs and working on turning double plays when a line drive rocketed toward him during batting practice. He instinctively shielded himself with his left arm. The ball hit Gossage above the wrist.\n\nFirst-year manager Ed Ott was throwing batting practice when Gossage got hurt. Ott said Gossage had no strength when asked to squeeze Ott’s hand and was in a “tremendous amount of pain.”\n\nOn May 25, two days before the season opener, the Skyhawks announced Gossage’s release as one several roster moves in a press release.\n\n“As far as the team goes, they have to release me because I’m out for a good part of the season,” Gossage said. “I knew that’s what they had to do.”\n\nOtt added, “In our league, if we put him on the [disabled list], we have to claim him on our salary cap.”\n\nGossage is collecting workers’ compensation.\n\nThe 26-year-old Gossage broke a bone in his left arm. He had surgery and a plate was inserted. Gossage’s arm is currently in a cast and is immobilized for two more weeks. Gossage will begin his rehab once the bone heals.\n\nGossage could return as early as August. The Skyhawks’ regular season ends Sept. 6. However, Gossage said he’s “not sure about this season” but will definitely return next season.\n\nOtt, who’s known Gossage since he was a child and played with his father on the 1977 Pittsburgh Pirates, told Gossage he would like his starting third baseman back.\n\n“As soon as you’re ready, give me a call,” Ott told Gossage.\n\nIn four minor league seasons from 2006-09, Gossage hit .260 with 11 home runs and 112 runs batted in."
