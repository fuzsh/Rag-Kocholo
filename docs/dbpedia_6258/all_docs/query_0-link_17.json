        "text": "FRANKFORD\n\n— Skylands Park, a minor league ballpark in Sussex County that has been mostly vacant since 2010, was sold today to a group of investors that includes the organizer of the State Fair Meadowlands.\n\nWhile baseball is not expected to return to the 4,200-seat ballpark next year, its new owner, Al Dorso Jr. of Pompton Plains, said he hoped baseball would return in 2015.\n\n“I’d love to bring baseball back to the stadium, but it’s harder said than done. It’s not in the picture for 2014, but I’m sure by 2015 we’ll be ready,” said Dorso, CEO of Skylands Stadium LLC.\n\nThe $850,000 sale price price includes the ballpark, 28 surrounding acres and a liquor license. Mark Roscioli Jr., a 32-year-old Philadelphia-based entrepreneur, bought the property in March for $950,000.\n\nThe possible new baseball tenants include a team from the startup Diamond League of Professional Baseball, a proposed developmental league for college-aged players, said Dorso.\n\nThe new league, which expects to start play in 2015 with an eight-team, 84-game schedule, is being organized by Frank Boulton, founder of the independent Atlantic League. The Atlantic League includes the Somerset Patriots and the Camden Riversharks.\n\nThe Diamond League had expected to begin play this year, but its debut was delayed until 2015 due to the unavailability of suitable ballparks, Boulton has said.\n\nIn the meantime, in a interview from the State Fair Meadowlands offices in Belleville, Dorso said he expects to host of a variety of outdoor events, including musical festivals, trade shows, flea markets and trade shows, at Skylands Park starting this spring.\n\nWhile some minor improvements are already under way, additional renovations, including power washing, painting and upgrades to the concession stands, will begin in the coming months, he said.\n\nThere are no plans to build a skating rink at the ballpark, said Dorso, and the installation of artificial turf is being considered.\n\nNick Corrado of Hardyston, a member of the six-man investment group, said they plan to make the ballpark family-friendly, including possibly erecting a portable large screen on the field for low-cost family nights.\n\n\"We want to make everything affordable. We want to be good neighbors,\" said Corrado, who owns a strip mall on Route 15 in neighboring Lafayette.\n\nThe future success of the ballpark relies heavily on the cooperation of officials in Frankford, he said.\n\n\"You have to see what the town allows,\" said Corrado.\n\nMeanwhile, Roscioli, whose plans to bring back baseball back to Skylands Parks evaporated when the Diamond League announced it would not start until 2015, said he fully expects Dorso to be successful in his new venture.\n\n“He’s the guy. This is right in his wheelhouse,” said Roscioli, whose firm, 17 Mile LLC, specializes in wireless infrastructure and purchasing distressed real estate properties.\n\n“He was the perfect candidate, he was the right person,” said RosciolI, adding that he never marketed the property for sale, but was approached by several potential buyers after the deal with the Diamond League fell through.\n\nSkylands Park has been mostly vacant since the Sussex Skyhawks left following the 2010 season. The Skyhawks, a member of the Can-Am League, began playing at Skylands Park in 2006.\n\nThe Sussex County Community College baseball team, the Skylanders, resumed playing their home games there last year and Dorso said he expects them to continue next year.\n\n“”We’re very community-minded,” he said.\n\nThe original tenants, the MLB-affiliated New Jersey Cardinals, played at Skylands Park from 1994 to 2005.\n\nThe State Fair Meadowlands is an annual 17-day fair held outside MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford. It is not affiliated with the New Jersey State Fair/Sussex County Farm and Horse Show, which is held annually at the county fairgrounds, a couple of miles from Skylands Park.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n• With deal closed, new Skylands Park owner exploring all possibilities"
