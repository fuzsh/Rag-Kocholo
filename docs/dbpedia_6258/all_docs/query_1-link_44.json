It was introduced in 1956 and is one of the most popular aircraft in aviation history. Skyhawk is widely used for pilot training, tourist flights and observation tasks. Cessna is a high-wing aircraft with a metal structure and excellent flight characteristics. The plane is easy to fly and maintain. The Cessna 172 is still produced in many versions and widely used around the world in both the civilian and military sectors.\n\nWe designed the block model with attention to detail in a scale of 1:48 using 160 elements. Its size fits perfectly into the collection of our modern aircraft. The model has rotating wheels and a movable propeller. There are also prints on the blocks, no stickers here! Especially for this set we designed a new block shape - a vertical stabilizer - so that our model imitates its inspiration as realistically as possible. Building the set is simple and hassle-free thanks to the clear paper instructions and the block Cessna 172 Skyhawk is a must-have model for civil aviation enthusiasts. Take your passion home and build it!\n\n162 high-quality elements\n\nProduced in the EU by a company with over 20 years of tradition\n\nThe blocks meet the safety standards of products for children\n\nFully compatible with other brands of construction blocks\n\nBlocks with prints do not scratch or smear and do not fade during play or under the influence of temperature\n\nClear and intuitive instructions based on illustrations and step-by-step directions\n\nModeling scale 1:48\n\nModel dimensions (L x W x H): 17.5 cm (6.9\") x 23.5 cm (9.3\") x 6.5 cm (2.6\")"
