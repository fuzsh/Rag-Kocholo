        "text": "AUGUSTA – How many ballparks have you seen that have restroom attendants, their own superhero roaming the stands, and a mini-train for kids circling the stadium?\n\nWell, a recent visit to Skylands Park in Sussex County found all three, and more.\n\nBut there’s something other than unique offerings at the home of the Sussex County Miners, where I ventured on June 5 for their game against the visiting New York Boulders.\n\nFrom Toms River: Todd Frazier returning to NJ to play for Sussex County Miners in preparation for Olympics\n\nThe newest members of the Major League Baseball-affiliated Frontier League offer a brand of baseball, and fan support, unlike any other Garden State minor league outfit.\n\nFor one, the ballpark resembles a cross between a large barn and something out of Field of Dreams. Spruced with modern amenities and a plentiful menu of food stands, it also hints at an atmosphere of old-fashioned carnival vibe and even Little League camaraderie.\n\n“It goes to our customer services,” said Justin Ferrarella, general manager and nephew of the owner, Al Dorso, who also owns the New Jersey Jackals in Montclair. “With the staff, with the players. I will put them up against anyone.”\n\n'A real pipeline into the major leagues'\n\nBoth teams moved from the independent Can-Am League, which had no official MLB ties, to the Frontier League during an off-season merger. That gave the players an automatic boost for big league contention with more access to top scouts.\n\n“We had been a real developmental league,” said Ferrarella. “In the past, it was just independent ball. It is great for us and great for the players. This is a real pipeline into the major leagues.”\n\nAnd the team added high-tech baseball tools this season, utilizing Yakker Tech hitting and pitching tracker equipment to the dugouts along with the requisite radar guns and pitch counters.\n\nFans have known the ballpark to be something different for years, ever since the Miners started in 2015.\n\nFrom the first entry into the stadium, dozens of volunteers offer welcoming grins and lead cheers throughout the game. Chants of “Lets..Go&mldr;Mi-ners!” (clap, clap, clap-clap-clap) flood the stands and bring attendees to their feet.\n\nAt some point, you expect a handle-bar moustached barbershop quartet to start singing and a turn-of-the century team to take the field in cotton uniforms and throwback jerseys.\n\nAnd you’ll rarely see a fan on their cell phone texting or checking social media. These die-hards are into the game.\n\n“They do a great job here for all of us,” said longtime fan Mike Courtright, who attended with his daughter. A resident of nearby Vernon, Courtright offered a bit more support than most fans, with a tattoo on his ankle of the Miners’ logo: “I’ve had it since they started. I’m just a big fan and have been a huge baseball fan for years.”\n\nBut the biggest fan has to be Sean Sandage of Hopatcong, a.k.a. “Miner Man.”\n\nTarget employee by day, 'Miner Man' by night\n\nSporting his homemade superhero costume, complete with Batman-like cowl, the 49-year-old Sandage roams the stands leading cheers, posing for photos and revving up the crowd like an amped-up NFL lineman before the Super Bowl.\n\n“The reason I do this is because what the players do on the field is real, it is about getting to the majors,” said Sandage, a Target employee by day who plans to spend his upcoming 50th birthday at a Miners game.\n\nA married father of one, he’s been entertaining the fans, and perhaps scaring some, since the Miners first arrived six years ago: “What better place to be? The crowds are amazing.”\n\nPrior to the Miners arrival, the stadium had been dark for five seasons after the previous tenants, the Skyland Skyhawks of the Can-Am League, departed in 2010 following a five-year stay.\n\nThe space was used for other events such as carnivals and fairs, along with teams ranging from a semi-pro football club to college baseball during the lean years. A women’s professional baseball team even took up residency for a short stay.\n\nThe ballpark first opened in 1994 for the New Jersey Cardinals, a St. Louis Cardinals Single A affiliate where future Major League stars such as Matt Morris and Dan Haren, both MLB all-stars, started, along with Coco Crisp and Adam Kennedy, each of whom went on to World Series championships.\n\nBut after the 2005 season, the Cardinals were sold and moved to Pennsylvania. The Skyhawks came in a year later and called the park home until their 2010 departure.\n\nIn 2015, the stadium was reborn with the Miners after an investment group led by Dorso, who also operated the Meadowlands State Fair, bought the stadium and later launched the team as an expansion club.\n\nAnd success has followed, both for excited fans and the hopeful players. “We had nine players sign with MLB affiliate teams after the 2019 season, and 15 since 2018,” said Ferrarella.\n\nFor 2021: Schedule release reveals details on the Sussex County Miners' first Frontier League season\n\nTrey Hair, Miners’ second baseman since 2019, hopes to join that list. The Firth, Nebraska product was drafted by the Tampa Bay Rays in 2017 before being released in 2019.\n\nHaving bounced around five other minor league teams and two college clubs over seven years, Hair still believes he has a shot and praises the Miners approach.\n\n“I love the camaraderie,” said Hair, 26. “I want to keep playing as long as I can do it.”\n\nIn eight games this season, Hair is batting .259, with 5 home runs, 15 RBIs and just 6 strikeouts. He also has six stolen bases and eight walks.\n\n'You need to set a limit'\n\nBut not everyone is as optimistic.\n\nPitcher Mike Castellani, also 26, said this is his final year after a career that began as a four-year starting pitcher for Bucknell University and has include two previous minor league seasons for the independent Florence Freedom in Kentucky.\n\nHis last season in Kentucky in 2019 included a respectable 9-2 record with 72 strikeouts and a just 25 walks, along with a decent 2.66 ERA.\n\nBut after several years of trying, Castellani has decided it is time to pursue something else: “I plan to go to law school. Something could happen but it is always wise to plan for life beyond baseball. You could keep playing here forever but you need to set a limit.”\n\nThe June 5 game ended with a thrilling six-run rally in the final innings to give the Miners the win, 7-6. As of June 8, they lead the Northern Division of the Frontier League with a streaking 7-1 record.\n\nJoe Strupp is an award-winning journalist with 30 years’ experience who covers education and several communities for APP.com and the Asbury Park Press.
