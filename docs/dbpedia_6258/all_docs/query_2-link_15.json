        "text": "Skylands Stadium\n\nSkylands Stadium LLC Management purchased Skylands Park in 2013, including the 4,200-seat ballpark, a 16,000-square foot all-purpose building and the surrounding 28 acres. The Stadium has upgraded all concessions, restroom facilities and seating areas, as well as the playing field, clubhouse and locker rooms. A new 5,000-square foot pavilion has been erected down the first base line. An 18,000-square foot exhibit hall will be completed this winter, and an in-house catering facility will be open for business by Spring, 2015.\n\nThe Stadium will host a new professional baseball team, The Sussex County Miners, which will begin play on Memorial Day, May 25. Led by General Manager Dave Chase, a nationally known baseball executive who brings over thirty-five years of experience to the role, the Miners are members of the Can-Am Association of Professional Baseball. They will play fifty-five home games in Augusta this summer. You can view their schedule here.\n\nThis story was first published: Summer, 2010"
