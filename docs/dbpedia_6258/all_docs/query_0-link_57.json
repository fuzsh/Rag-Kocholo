Oh and then there's Goodwood Revival – celebrating all things vintage with a glamorous step back in time to the golden age of motor racing.\n\nIf you really feel like splashing out, there's always the option of soaring across the Sussex countryside in your own privately flown Skyhawk. Say hello to the Goodwood Estate, an English institution that ought to be on everyone’s bucket list. Along with Goodwood Revival, the estate is home to two other iconic events: the Festival of Speed, which attracts celebrities from both on and off the race track, and Glorious Goodwood, where dapper crowds gather to experience five days of fine dining, champagne, elaborate hats and of course, horse racing. Its the highlight of the sporting and social calendars don’t you know?\n\nIf you want to fully immerse yourself in Goodwood – and who wouldn’t? – book yourself into the estate’s four-star hotel with its 91 elegant bedrooms and luxurious spa. Intensive back massage anyone? Or what about a divine three-course meal in the Georgian-style private members restaurant? Don’t mind if I do!"
