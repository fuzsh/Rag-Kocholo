        "text": "A Father’s Day gift brought me back to the stadium that is the closest to my house (35 minutes) as the entire family joined on a great night for baseball. This would be my two-year old’s first ever game and she enjoyed climbing in and out of the seat after getting past the awe of a setting that was all so new to her. It was a wide range of the spectrum during firework time as she somehow fell asleep while my six-year old sat frightened by the loud noises. I know what we’re not doing this 4th of July.\n\nIt’s been 13 years since I’ve been to Skylands Stadium, a place that I thought was left for dead after the Skyhawks folded in 2010. However, the Miners debuted in 2015 and the ballpark has been busy once again as they’ve been successful in the Can-Am League (now absorbed into the Frontier League). Owners of the park have also got good use out of it as they run popular holiday events and festivals. The area really is a strange one to have a ballpark as Sussex County is not anchored by any city. This northwest corner of New Jersey is quite rural as woods, hills and occasional farmland dot the landscape. After passing through Newton, a town of less than 10,000, the stadium just pops up amongst an array of fields. The ballpark has a nice exterior design that makes it fit in with the surroundings as it clearly has the look of a barn structure. They also added a huge sculpture of the world that is actually a fire pit and it makes for a remarkable exit to the stadium as it is lit post-game. Inside, seats are blue, so you really have a contrast of colors between the red structure, blue seats and yellow/black team logo. Addressing that would go a long way. Those seats are bucket seats, not the most comfortable, but better than bleachers. It is a nice setting as sightlines to the field are pretty good and the outfield background is lined by trees."
