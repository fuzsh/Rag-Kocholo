        "text": "The New Britain Bees hosted the Vermont Lake Monsters in an FCBL game last week, and I had no problem spotting multiple Lake Monsters. Ironically, I’ll be visiting Loch Ness on a trip to Scotland next week, but not holding my breath that I’ll see a lake monster.\n\nA Vermont Lake Monster player at the plate at New Britain Stadium last week\n\nThere were 200+ people on hand for Game 1 of a pre-Independence Day double-header. I couldn’t help but think back to when the Double-A Eastern League Rock Cats were bringing a few thousand fans into New Britain Stadium.\n\nThe Bees used three D1 pitchers — Trey Deitalbaum (Bryant), TJ Winn (St. John’s last year and CCSU this coming year) and Andrew Cutler (George Washington) — to keep the Lake Monsters in check and earn a 4-2 win.\n\nI settled into a seat down the 3rd base line for the final inning…\n\n…and the home plate ump was nice enough to give me his lineup cards after the game.\n\nMy schedule has gotten infinitely more busy, and going to baseball games has taken a direct shot across the bow. However, I did manage to get to the first game of a Monday double-header between the New Britain Bees and Westfield Starfires of the Futures Collegiate Baseball League.\n\nThe game started at 10:30am and was one of those “school day” games with a lot of kids.\n\nThe host Bees spotted Westfield an early run, then answered with six straight en route to a 7-4 victory.\n\nOf course I chased lineup cards from the home plate umpire, and he recognized me from a couple games during the college season. I’m not sure if that is a good or bad thing, but he was happy to give me his cards, for which I am appreciative.\n\nThe FCBL batting order cards, particulary the top sheet that the umpire gets, are beyond cool with the watermark. I’d argue that they are as nice as any batting cards out there in amateur or pro ball right now, so kudos to the FCBL and PLC Sports, which makes the cards.\n\nAt some point, my schedule will ease up a bit so I can start getting to games more regularly, or so I hope…\n\nIt’s always great to break up a summer work day with some baseball.\n\nI was able to time my lunch break just right to make it to the final two innings of the Norwich Sea Unicorns playing at the New Britain Bees in an FCBL matchup Tuesday.\n\nAnd it ended up being worth the effort.\n\nYou wouldn’t necessarily know it from the picture, but there was a decent number of people at the game, mostly campers hanging out in the shaded seats.\n\nThe Bees, a game behind Norwich in the standings entering the day, were down 3-0 at one point, but I got there in time to see them tie it up with a run on the bottom of the 8th, then walk it off with a double, stolen base and single in the 9th for a 4-3 win.\n\nI asked the home plate umpire for his cards, and he delivered.\n\nIt’s the first card we’ve gotten from the Sea Unicorns.\n\nWe’re up to 45 cards on the year. The break down: MLB – 14; MiLB – 2; Indy – 1; college summer league – 5; college – 23.\n\nLast year, the Brockton Rox of the Futures Collegiate Baseball League (FCBL) had the sons of five former Major Leaguers on the team: Manny Ramirez Jr., Pedro Martinez Jr., D’Angelo Ortiz, Kade Foulke and Jaden Sheffield.\n\nIt would have been a cool lineup card to get, but I found out late and was not able to get to a Rox game.\n\nOnly Manny Ramirez Jr., son of former MLB star Manny Ramirez, is back this season.\n\nThere is one interesting addition to this year’s team, though: Marika Lyszczyk. Lyszczyk, who plays collegiately for Division 2 Sonoma State, is the first woman to play in the FCBL. She was originally a catcher, but now a relief pitcher.\n\nThe Rox were playing in New Britain last night. Ramirez Jr. started at DH, but Lyszczyk did not pitch.\n\nRamirez Jr. went 1-for-3 with a couple RBI in a 6-4 Rox win.\n\nManny Ramirez Jr. batting for the Brocton Rox on June 20, 2023\n\nAfter the game ended, I asked the home plate umpire for his batting order cards, and he obliged.\n\nI’ve gotten some 300 lineup cards after games, with a few thousand different players, but this was the first time I’ve gotten a lineup card with a female on it.\n\nI’m also a fan of the FCBL batting order card design, specifically the watermarks. One surprise is that the umpire didn’t mark down any changes on either card, and there were changes made during the game. It is possible, but would be unusual, that he wrote the changes down on a separate piece of paper.\n\nFor the year, I’m up to 37 lineup cards: 23 college; 3 college summer league; 8 MLB; and 3 Minor League.\n\nSome 72 hours after the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) All Star Game (ASG), I was back at it at the Futures Collegiate Baseball League (FCBL) ASG at nearby New Britain Stadium.\n\nThere was a Home Run Derby (HRD) followed by the ASG itself.\n\nSean joined me for the HRD, which was nowhere near as crowded as the CCBL HRD.\n\nI snagged six balls, including two on the fly. It made up for failing to catch any on the fly at the CCBL. Sean got three. We gave three balls to kids who had not gotten one.\n\nThe balls were the same logo/design as last year’s balls, with “2021” on them.\n\nI understood last year when “2020” balls were used due to COVID causing that year’s game to be canceled. I did not understand using “2021” balls this year.\n\nI kept thinking about it as Sean and I headed home for dinner. I wasn’t planning on going back for the game itself, but I started to wonder if maybe they’d use “2022” balls for the ASG itself? It was worth heading back to see if my hunch was right.\n\nBack at the stadium, I went to the souvenir shop. Sure enough, they were selling “2022” ASG balls.\n\nThere were kids chasing balls all over the inside and outside of the stadium. I got lucky to be outside by myself at one point when a foul ball came my way.\n\nNice. So I now had a “2021” and a “2022” ball.\n\nIt was a beautiful night for baseball in New Britain.\n\nI tried for lineup cards after the game, but was only able to get the batting order card for one of the teams.\n\nIt’s neat the the Nashua Silver Knights have their logo as a watermark on their batting order cards.\n\nI’m up to 22 baseball lineup cards on the season, plus two hockey cards.\n\nI had an itch to hit a game Thursday night, but didn’t want to make the 2.5-hour round-trip to Worcester, the closest professional team playing. Instead, I headed to New Britain to see the Bees of the Futures Collegiate Baseball League (FCBL) play. The FCBL is a college summer league.\n\nQuick history, New Britain Stadium used to be our go-to place for snagging lineup cards when it was home to the New Britain Rock Cats of the Double-A Eastern Lg, then the New Britain Bees of the Atlantic League.\n\nWe saw some up-and-comers play in New Britain, such as Eastern Leaguers Mike Yasztremski, Erik Fedde and Trevor Story, and some former MLB’ers on their way out of baseball in the Atlantic League, including Eric Gagne, Lou Ford and Sean Burroughs.\n\nBut now the Bees are an FCBL team, a mix of typically lower D1 players, along with D2 and D3.\n\nThe Bees were hosting the Westfield (MA) Starfires Thursday night with a decent crowd on a nice evening.\n\nIt is startling to see the difference in size, speed, etc. between MLB guys three days earlier and then college players, but it was a well-played game, won by the Starfires, 3-0.\n\nI stayed until the end and asked for the Westfield lineup card as I already have a New Britain card. The manager was nice enough to give it to me.\n\nFCBL teams use the same nice, full-size (17″ x 11″) lineup cards, just with the different team name and logo at the top. Maybe a couple of these players will eventually play professional baseball, and possibly one will end up in the Majors.\n\nThis card gets me to 20 on the season in 14 games, with one additional game where I didn’t get a card.\n\nConnecticut got hit pretty bad with the remnants of Hurricane Isaias on August 4, with some seriously high winds that caused a lot of damage. Personally, we lost electricity for about 13 hours, and cable/Internet for a week.\n\nNew Britain Stadium, home of the New Britain Bees of the Futures Collegiate Baseball Lg (FCBL), well it lost a significant section of its outfield wall.\n\nWalking out there, as best I could tell, the wall came down on its own versus getting it by a tree or something like that.\n\nHere’s a closer view from behind the former OF wall.\n\nThe remnants of what used to be about a 20-foot wall in left-center field\n\nAs you can see, they put up a temporary fence to be able to finish out the season.\n\nI went to a couple games after the wall damage. The first game, without Sean, I scored New Britain’s Official Batting Order card.\n\nThe second game, with Sean, we got nothing, no balls or lineup cards. But it was neat to be able to watch a few innings from behind the former outfield wall.\n\nIt’s weird how things sometimes work. Five years ago, we were going to MiLB Eastern Lg games at New Britain Stadium, before the Rock Cats changed their name to the Yard Goats and jumped ship to Hartford.\n\nThen we had the New Britain Bees of the Atlantic Lg, but they didn’t draw well and shut down after the 2019 season, ending New Britain’s professional baseball era.\n\nIf either of those teams were still playing in New Britain, we wouldn’t have had baseball this summer. But the FCBL managed to play, allowing for baseball at New Britain Stadium, and giving us a change to chase/snag a few 2020 FCBL baseballs.\n\n2020 has not been a good year, but Thursday evening provided some degree of summer normalcy.\n\nSean and I were able to do some ballhawking at New Britain Stadium.\n\nThe New Britain Bees, formerly a professional team playing in the Atlantic League, are now in the Futures Collegiate Baseball League (FCBL), a collegiate summer league.\n\nOld pic of New Britain Stadium, when the Bees were part of the Atlantic Lg\n\nWhile MiLB and some other college summer leagues called off the season due to Covid, the FCBL not only started its season last night, but did so in front of fans. One quarter of stadium capacity, 1,500 fans, were allowed into the stadium, and according to the Bees, that’s exactly how many showed up.\n\nI decided that we’d stay in the parking lot for the first game, thinking they’d get a good crowd, and if so, that ballhawking outside the stadium might be best.\n\nWe did well, snagging five gamers, giving one away.\n\nI was cautiously optimistic the FCBL would use a 10th anniversary baseball to celebrate it’s milestone season, so I was a little disappointed to see that wasn’t the case.\n\nThe ball does have “2020” on it, so that is cool.\n\nOne of the problems with ballhawking in the parking lot is that the balls will almost certainly hit the pavement and get scuffed up. The pic above was the best ball we got.\n\nBut it was good to have baseball back. I am cautiously optimistic we’ll get to a few or even several more games over the next couple months, and not just the FCBL, but also a couple other college summer leagues in the tri-state area, and possibly some independent league baseball.\n\nProfessional baseball in New Britain, Connecticut was officially declared dead today, October 28, 2019.\n\nIt’s not a surprise given events of the last three or so weeks, and to a lesser extent, the last five-plus years. I rhetorically asked in a blog 17 days ago if New Britain had seen its last professional baseball game: https://lineupcards.wordpress.com/2019/10/11/pro-baseball-in-new-britain-coming-to-an-end/.\n\nEven if it’s not a surprise, it is still sad. Pro ball had a 36-year run in New Britain, a small, blue collar-ish city in the Shadow of Hartford.\n\nAnd it was Hartford that inevitably put the stake through the heart of New Britain baseball five-plus years ago when it struck a deal with the owners of the then New Britain Rock Cats to lure the team to a soon-to-be-built stadium in the heart of Hartford, less than 20 minutes away from New Britain Stadium.\n\nThat announcement caught virtually everyone by surprise, including the city of New Britain. New Britain Stadium and the Rock Cats had done well together, but like any marriage, it wasn’t perfect. The stadium was nearly 20 years old at the time, and in need of a face lift. And there was concern that the field itself wasn’t as good as it could or should be.\n\nSo Hartford swooped in, offered to build a brand new stadium, and the Rock Cat management said yes. I’d imagine it’d be hard to turn down someone offering to build you a new stadium.\n\nNew Britain didn’t miss a beat in bringing the Bees in to replace the Rock Cats (now Hartford Yard Goats). The Bees replaced the Camden River Sharks of the Atlantic League, considered the best of the independent baseball leagues.\n\nLineup card and game ball from first-ever New Britain Bees victory in 2016\n\nBut baseball at New Britain Stadium was never the same. Save for the first Bees game ever and a few school day games when the stadium was full of kids, few people came to New Britain to watch the Bees play.\n\nI imagine it was a combination of things including the stigma regarding independent league baseball, some people migrating to Hartford to become Yard Goat fans (although they had to wait a year due to delays in building the stadium), and a generally poor job marketing the team to both fans.\n\nPicture from a 2016 game; not many fans on a beautiful September evening\n\nThe Atlantic League numbers said the Bees drew 2,000+ people a game over their four years, but rarely in the three dozen or so games that we attended did it look like there were more than a few hundred people in the stadium.\n\nA 2018 Bees game\n\nSo when word came out a few weeks ago that the Bees probably would not play in the Atlantic League in 2020, I wasn’t very surprised.\n\nMy hope was that they’d end up in the Can-Am League, another lower-class, less expensive to run independent league, but that went out the window a few days later when the Can-Am Lg was absorbed by the Frontier Lg, and it was made clear the Bees wouldn’t be part of that.\n\nOne of the last professional Bees games we went to, in 2019\n\nThe FCBL\n\nSo the Bees will play in the Futures Collegiate Baseball League (FCBL) going forward, which is what I guessed would happen, especially after the Can-Am/Frontier Lg possibility fell through.\n\nThe FCBL is a college summer baseball league. It is much cheaper to operate because 1) the players are amateurs/don’t get paid, and 2) FCBL teams play far fewer games than the Atlantic League.\n\nIt’s not the worst thing in the world, but it isn’t the best, either. The level of baseball is far, far below the Atlantic League. Not only are the players amateur college players, but for the most part, they are not the best college players. FCBL players typically come from lower-end Division 1, D2/D3 and even Junior Colleges.\n\nIt’s a relatively new league, started in 2010. I’m not sure how many FCBL players have made it to MLB, but I am only aware of two for certain. By comparison, the New England Collegiate Baseball League, which essentially operates alongside the FCBL in New England, had 100+ alumni playing/having played in MLB as of 2016.\n\nI’m also not certain how solid a foundation the FCBL is. The last two seasons, the league has only had seven teams, certainly not ideal.\n\nBut the fact that baseball will still be played in New Britain, even if not professional baseball, is better than nothing, and I wish both the Bees and FCBL well.\n\nSean/my last professional game in New Britain, August 2019\n\nThe Frontier League announced it is joining forces with the Can-Am League on October 16, although the reality is that the Frontier Lg is absorbing the Can-Am Lg and the Can-Am Lg is now defunct.\n\nAll but one of the current Can-Am Lg teams will play in the Frontier Lg. The Ottawa Champions will not field a team in the Frontier Lg in 2021, although the Frontier Lg did not rule out a Champions return in 2021.\n\nOf specific interest to me, the New Britain Bees will not be one of the teams in the 14-team Frontier Lg that will play in 2020. The Can-Am Lg was thought to be a possible destination for the Bees.\n\nThat leaves the Bees staying in the Atlantic Lg at least one more season, or becoming a collegiate summer league team in either the FCBL or NECBL. I guess it’s also possible that the Bees could join the Empire Professional Baseball Lg, but the Empire Lg is essentially the lowest run of pro ball, and I don’t see that being likely. Maybe there is some other possibility that I am not aware of? Probably not, but we’ll see.\n\nI’m sad to see the Can-Am League go. We’ve gone to 15-20 Can-Am Lg games over the years. My first-ever pro game foul ball snag was at a Sussex Skyhawks game about 15 years ago.\n\nWe scored dugout lineup cards from four of the Can-Am Lg teams, and an official batting order card from another.\n\nOttawa Champions lineup card from 2015; I like the watermark!\n\nWhile it is far more rare that Can-Am players made it to MLB compared to the Atlantic League, Stephen Cardullo of the Rockland Boulders, in the 3-spot in Rockland’s lineup above, played for the Rockies in 2016-2017.\n\nKate and I went to our one and only Frontier Lg game in 2017, scoring Frontier Lg 25th anniversary baseballs and lineup cards from the Florence Freedom and now-defunct Normal Cornbelters.\n\nIt’s nice that we’ll be able to chase more Frontier Lg lineup cards if we want. Three of the teams — Rockland, New Jersey and Sussex — are all about 2 hours from us.\n\nMeanwhile, we’ll continue to wait to see what happens with the Bees."
