        "text": "Chris Anderson is once again a professional baseball player. The Portsmouth native and former Minnesota Twins farmhand who signed recently with the Worcester Tornadoes of the independent Canadian-American League, made the team out of spring training.\n\nThe 10-day camp started May 18, and the season began last Thursday in Canada against the host Quebec Capitales. Today the Tornadoes begin a series in New Jersey against the Sussex Skyhawks, and while Anderson was, at press time, listed as a catcher on the Tornadoes Web site (not to mention a 2009 birth year), don't believe the hype. He is pitching, and while Worcester's pitching rotation is still a work in progress, the 23-year-old Anderson will have an opportunity to prove himself.\n\n\"I envision Chris will be a starter, but it's too early to say for sure,\" said Jorg Bassiacos, the team's executive vice president and general manager. \"He has great stuff, he's a strong kid and I hope he can eat up a lot of innings. But again, it's too soon to say for sure.\"\n\nAnderson returned calls for this column, but let's just say the mobile phone service in the area of Quebec he was in over the weekend was less than cooperative. But while he wasn't immediately available, his father, Chris Anderson Sr., the original recipe himself, was in cell range. Anderson the elder is optimistic that his son is getting his edge back on the mound following Tommy John surgery on his pitching elbow in 2006 and two releases by Minnesota, the team that drafted him in 2006.\n\n\"I haven't seen Chris like this since college,\" said Anderson Sr. of his son's stint pitching for Northern Essex Community College. \"He kind of made his own name being an [intimidator] on the mound, but after the operation he was never the same. He didn't have that same confidence.\"\n\nHe came on in relief in his Can-Am League debut last Thursday, striking out the only batter he faced in the Tornadoes' 3-1 loss to Quebec in the season-opener. Just one batter, but the confidence was there. Such wasn't necessary the case last season.\n\nA lack of confidence may have played into his 2008 performance, along with a lack of conditioning because he was coming off the surgery. In 18 games last season for the Single-A Beloit Snappers (Wisconsin) of the Midwest League, Anderson was 2-0 with a 6.84 ERA, recording 17 strikeouts and walking nine over 25 innings.\n\nThen, this spring, the Twins released him after only 1 1/3 innings of work. With the help of former Boston Red Sox hurler Bob Stanley, who works with Anderson at USA Training Centers in Newington, as well as old Anderson family friend and MLB hitting guru Walt Hriniak, Anderson is getting his groove back.\n\n\"He's excited about baseball again,\" Anderson Sr. said. \"In my opinion, he has a renewed love of the game.\"\n\nAnderson, at 5-foot-11 and a sturdy 205 pounds, has all the physical tools. He's already got a big-league-caliber fastball that he locates well. If he can, as Stanley recently said, find consistency with his curve and slider, perhaps that renewed love of the game will be the final ingredient for Anderson to continue his ascent through the minors.\n\n\"A lot of people make it a lot farther with a lot less talent,\" Anderson Sr. said.\n\nThe Tornadoes recognize the talent, and now they're hoping Anderson can put it all together.\n\nMike Sullivan is a Herald columnist.
