This expanded menu is just one of the many ways the Skyhawks are providing competitive baseball in a family-friendly environment for all of Sussex County to enjoy.â In an effort to make Skylands Park more family-friendly, the Skyhawks are implementing an expanded concessions menu utilizing new food preparation facilities installed by the organization during the offseason. In addition to fan-favorites like hot dogs and hamburgers, the team will now offer many specialty items such as Buffalo wings, popcorn chicken nuggets and fried shrimp. While offering this expanded new menu, the team has lowered the prices of all concessions; hot dogs that cost $3.50 at Skylands Park last year now cost $2. On July 23, in honor of the classic car show held at Skylands Park that day, the Skyhawks will be offering 50-cent hot dogs throughout the game.
