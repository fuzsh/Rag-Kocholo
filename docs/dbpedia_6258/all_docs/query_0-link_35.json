        "text": "Augusta - The Reverend Albert Nix, pastor of Blessed Kateri Parish in Sparta, is no stranger to raising his voice to the heavens, but this is the first time he will sing the national anthem before 4,000 Skyhawks fans as a brand new U.S. citizen. The pastor will step up to the plate at Skylands Park at 7:05 p.m. on Friday, July 21, as part of Blessed Kateriâs night at the ballpark. Nix, who hails from Meelick, County Clare, Ireland, and whose voice could well be mistaken for the better known âIrish tenors,â received U.S. citizenship on May 4. His public ministry in the Roman Catholic Church began in 1973 as a curate in Bruff, County Limerick. Four years later, his dedication to his faith led him to Chip, Nigeria, where he served as a pastor until 1981. He realized his dream of serving in the United States in 1993 and relocated to the Diocese of Paterson at St. Vincent De Paul Churc in Stirling. He made Sussex County his home in 2003 when he was appointed pastor of Blessed Kateri Parish in Sparta. Music has always been a part of his life, and next month, Sussex Skyhawks fans will get a taste of what Blessed Kateri parishioners are treated to every Sunday. Father Tom Fallone, Parochial Vicar and Skipper of the BK Knights, will also be on hand to throw out a game ball."
