Larry Hall, president of the Sussex Skyhawks (independent; Can-Am Association), unveiled the logo for the new Sussex baseball team. The logo, which incorporates a deep, rich sky blue called Pantone 300, prominently features a hawk striking down, grasping a baseball in its powerful talons. The Skyhawks home season begins with Opening Day festivities on May 29 at Skylands Park in Augusta, NJ, and will culminate with a fireworks display that will light up the Sussex night sky.
