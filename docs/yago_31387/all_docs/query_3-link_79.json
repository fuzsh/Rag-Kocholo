She was the daughter of Irivabedanga Satyasraya (Emperor in 997-1008).\n\nAround 1000 Reigning Abbess Godilde of Bourbourg, Lady of Oxelaere, Noordpeene, Faumont and Coutiches (France)\n\nSister of Lambert, Abbeot of Saint -Bertin. As Abbess she held semi-epicopal powers.\n\n1001-42 Politically Influential and Partner in Power Queen Emma de Normandie of England (United Kingdom)\n\n1040 Regent in Wessex\n\nAlso known as Alfgifu, and is thought to have been sharing the royal lordship with her husband, King Æthelred II of England, who died 1116, but her power seems to have been limited by the fact that she was his second or third wife. In the years 1013-16 England was conquered by King Knud of Denmark, 1014-15 she and her husband sought refuge by her relatives in Normandy. Knud defeated her stepson and claimed the throne. Her marriage to him was both a sign of reconciliation and a demonstration of his power with her as the symbol of both the English defeat and continuity. And it became the culmination of her power and she became the most visible Queen so far. During Knud’s frequent visits to Denmark, where he had become king in 1019, her role was close to that of a regent. When Knud died, his son from an earlier marriage, Harald Harefod, claimed the throne and she had to fight to secure the interests of her own son. She maintained the control of the treasury and tax collection from her Dowry in the City of Winchester. When Harald’s grip on England strengthened, she was send in exile to Flanders, but when he died in 1040, she returned to England with her son, Hardeknud, and during his two years on the throne, she again shared the power, but when her oldest son, Edward succeeded to the throne he confiscated her estates and treasures and she withdrew permanently to Winchester. She was daughter of Duke Richard I of Normandy and Gunnor, and lived (980’s-1052).\n\n1001-39 Reigning Abbess Sophie von Sachsen of Gandersheim, Abbess of Essen and Vreden (Germany)\n\nThe daughter of Otto II, she joined the Chapter of Gandersheim at the age of four, and aided her brother, Otto III in the politics of the Holy Roman Empire, 994 she took part in the Reichstag of Sohlingen, and went with him to Rome in 996, and she actually functioned as the First Lady at Court, as “Consors Imperii” 996-1001. After Otto’s death she and her sister, Abbess Adelheid of Quedlinburg participated in the “Assembly of the Great of Sachsen” in the Pfalz Werla, which chose their cousin, Heinrich IV of Bayern as the new king under the name of Heinrich II, and they both took part in his coronation. She had been elected Abbess in 1001 but was in dispute with the Bishop of Hillesheim. Also Heinrich’s successor, Konrad, made contact with the two Princesses after his election because of their high rank and stature in the Empire. Sophie was also Abbess of Essen and Vreden. She lived (975-1039).\n\n1002-24 Consors Regnii Empress Kunigunde von Bayern of Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\n\n1012, 1016 etc. Regent\n\n1021 Presiding over the Hearings in the Royal Court in Regsnburg\n\n1024 Co-Regent Dowager Empress\n\nJoint ruler and the closest advisor of her husband, Heinrich II, and joint ruler.

After her Husband’s death, she held the royal insignia July till September, and was regent together with her brother’s, Bishop Dietrich von Metz and Heinrich until a successor was elected. She then handed over the insignia to emperor Konrad II. She withdrew to a convent that she founded herself and later became a saint. She lived (circa 980-1033).\n\n1003-07 Regent Dowager Countess Godila von Rothenburg of Rothenburg and Guardian of Nordmark (Germany)\n\nRelated to Bishop Wigfried von Verdun (959-83) who secured the paternal fief for her sons, after the death of her first husband Lothar III, Count von Walbeck. Her oldest son, Werner, born in 990 when she was 13 years old. She had two more sons and a daughter in the first marriage, and two children with her second husband, Hermann II, counts von Werl (circa 980-after 1024), whom she married in 1007. She lived (Circa 977-1015).\n\n1003-11 Countess Regnant Toda Mumadona of Ribagorza (Spain)\n\nSucceeded her brother, Isarno, and was succeeded by her niece, Munia Mayor of Castilla, the daughter of her sister, Ava.

She gave the\n\nmonks in the neighbouring St. Emmeram the task of making an expensive Evangelista, altar-book, which still exists. During her reign the Convent was placed directly under the protection of the king of Germany.\n\n1004-circa 07 Member of the Regency Council Dowager Queen Jimena Fernández of Navarra (Spain)\n\nWhen her husband García Sánchez I, she asumed the regency for her son, Sancho III together with her mother-in-law, Urraca Fernandez, who had been regent of Aragón from 994, and the local bishops.

After the death of her husband, Giovanni III (984–1008) she was regent for her son Giovanni IV and after his death for grandson Giovanni V (1012–1032). Initially she was opposed by her husband’s nephew, Leo I, but her supporters expelled him. But then she had to deal with the opposition of her own son, Leo II, who expected to be accorded the regency. The two disputed the regency and co-undersigned charters until January 1025, when Leo last appears in the Codex Caietanus. Emilia was the sole regent in a February charter. She supported the Pope and the Lombards against the Byzantine Empire. In 1027, when Duke Sergius IV was forced to flee Napoli, she gave him refuge and he conceded to the Gaetans certain rights in travelling in Neapolitan land. An accord was signed between the rulers in February 1029. It is not known when her regency ended. She (d. 1036).\n\n1010-? Sovereign Countess Melisende of Dunois (France)\n\nDaughter of Geoffoi II and married to Warin de Domfront of Alençon.\n\n1016-22 Regent of Ifriqiya/Ifriqiyah (Libya, Tunesia and Algeria)\n\nIn the first year as regent for her nephew, Muizz ibn Badis Al-Muizz (1016-62) there was a bloody revolt in Ifriqiya in which the Fatimid residence Al-Mansuriya was completely destroyed and 20.000 Shiites were massacred. The unrest forced a ceasefire in the conflict with the Hammadids of Algeria, and their independence was finally recognised in 1018. She was deposed by Muizz. She was the daughter of al-Mansûr ibn Buluggin who ruled 984-995) and sister of Badis ibn Mansur who ruled in 995-1016.\n\n1017-.. Regent Dowager Countess Urraca Gómez of Castilla (Spain)\n\nAfter the death of Sancho García of Castilla in 1017 she became regent for her son, García Sánchez, who was murdered in 1029, and was succeeded by her daughter, Mayor.\n\n1029 Sovereign Countess Mayor of Castilla (Spain)\n\nAlso kown as Muniadomna, she was daughter of García I of Castilla and married Count Sancho III of Navarra (999-1035). As “Domna major regina” she confirmed a charter of “Sancius Hispaniarum rex” dated 26 Jun 1033 which related to concessions to the monastery of Oriense. She succeeded to the County when her brother, García Sánches was murdered in 1029. As “Sancius…rex…cum coniuge mea regina domina Maiora”, she donated the monastery of San Sebastian to the monastery of Leire by charter. She became a nun after her husband died. The testament of “Maior regina Christi ancilla”, by which she founded the monastery of San Martín de Fromista 13 Jul 1066, names her father but not her husband. She lived (circa 994/96-after 1066).\n\n1013-85 Sovereign Countess Irmgardis of Aspel (Germany)\n\nAlso known as Saint Irmgardis von Köln, the sources show her as Reigning Countess, and after her parents died, she distributed her wealth among hospitals, churches and social institutions. She lived a simple life in solitude and went on three pilgrimages to Rome. She spent her last years in Köln, where she supported Chapters and Convents. She lived (1000-65/82/89).\n\n1013-16 Supreme Commander of the Palace Shao-shi in China\n\nAn official in the palace service organization, she appears to have earned all her promotions through meritorious service. She had served in the palace of Taizong (r.976-997) when he was a feudal prince. When Taizong became emperor, she was made siyi (Director of Clothing) then promoted to shanggong (Chief-of-services) responsible for the Women’s Service Organization within the palace. In 997, Zhenzong (r.998-1022) named her qun furen (Commandery Mistress) and in 1013, the emperor created a new title of gong siling (Supreme Commander of the Palace) in her honor. In 1033, Renzong (r.1023-1064) posthumously promoted her to minor wife status by naming her taiyi (One of Supreme Deportment) and in 1044 to xienfei (Worthy Consort).

She later married Konrad II, and she was crowned Queen of Germany, and Holy Roman Empress. The sources indicates that she was a vivid participant in the affairs of the realm and took part in the Imperial Councils and acted as joint regent of her husband, and it was trough her intervention that her relative, Rudolf III of Burgundy transferred the succession to his realm to her husband. She was also interested in the affairs of the church and intervened in the appointments of Bishops and Princely Abbots and participated in various synods. She was not at good terms with her son, Heinrich III, and therefore she was less influential after Konrad’s death. She lived (989-1043).\n\nAround 1015-42 Governor Princess Akkadevi of a Province in Karnataka (India)\n\nSister of the Calukya king Jayasinha II. She fought battles and superintended sieges.\n\nUntil 1016 Queen Sri Ajnadevi of Bali (Indonesia)\n\nNot much is known of Bali during the period when Indian traders brought Hinduism to the Indonesian Archipelago. The earliest records found in Bali, stone inscriptions, date from around the 9th century AD and by that time Bali had already developed many similarities to the island you find today. Rice was grown with the help of a complex irrigation system probably very like that employed now.\n\n1017-27 Joint Regent Abbess Urraca Garciez de Covarrubias of Castilla (Spain)\n\nThe Abbess of Covarrubias, she ruled jointly with bishop Pedro of Burgos during the minority of her nephew, Count Garcia II (1110-17-29), after her brother, Sancho had been killed.

She had his son al-Zahir proclaimed Imam and Caliph and she became regent. She appointed competent ministers, managed to bring the economy in order and brought peace to the country. (d. 1024).\n\n1020…. Princess-Abbess Kunigunde of Göss bei Leoben/Nonnenberg (Austria)\n\nHer grandchild, Aribo III handed it over to the protection of Emperor Heinrich II, who granted it immunity and raised it to the status of an Imperial Immediacy (reichsunmittelbaren Abtei) – the only one in Austria – and removed the Chapter from the influence of the Metropolits of Salzburg. She was sister of Aribos, and was the first abbess with the title of a Princess of the Realm (geistlichen Reichsfürstin). The Abbess became a Prelate of the Realm in 1242. So far she is the only Abbess known to me. The chapter was secularised in 1803.\n\nCirca 1020-40 Dame Abbesse Berscinda of Remiremont (France)\n\nDaughter of Gerard/Gerhard II von Metz, Count of Elsass and Eva von Luxemburg.

He refused his mother’s rights to the county, and she asked her brother, Geoffroy Martel for help. He defeated Foulgues and became count himself in 1032. She was the widow of Bodon, comte de Vendôme (1017-23) and daughter of Foulque III Nerra, comte d’Anjou and Elisabeth de Vendôme, the daughter of Bouchard I and (d. 1031).\n\n1021-33 (†) Regent Dowager Empress Liu Zhangxian Mingxiao of China\n\nWhen her husband, Emperor Heng (998-1022), who was also known as Sung Chen Tsung or Tseng Tsung, became insane in 1021, she assumed power, unofficially, in the de facto administration of the empire, but someone else was appointed as the official regent, and efforts were made to keep her from the regency for her stepson, Emperor Zhao Zhen (1010-22-63), two years later. As regent she was able to consolidate her power and govern as de facto sovereign. She held court, with the young emperor, behind the lowered screen. She alone made the final decisions on state policies and delegation of power. Liu left a will stipulating that another palace woman; Yang (c.1033) should succeed her as regent even though Renzong was already 23 years old. Her wishes were not honored as neither the emperor nor his ministers were willing to tolerate another regency. Also known as Chengtian, she lived (969-1033).\n\n1023-59 Politically Influential Supreme Consort Yang Zhanghui of China\n\nThe regent, Dowager Empress Liu created a special post for her as huang taifei (Supreme Consort) and left a will stipulating that Yang was to succeed her as regent to Emperor Zhao Zhen (1010-22-63), who was 23 at the time and did not want a regent. She was able to obtain numerous favors and offices for the next three generations of her paternal family. Zhao Zhen continued to listen to her advice and after the early deaths of his three sons the question of succession became a great concern and in 1059, she persuaded him to adopt the son of a cousin who became Emperor Yingzong (1064-1067). She lived (983-?)\n\nCirca 1024-circa 1035 Queen Iztacxilotzin of Quauhtitlan (Mexico)\n\nRuler of the Aztec State on the boarder between Mexico and Guatemala.\n\n1024-68 Governor Princess Akkadevi of Kisukadu Seventy in Karnataka (India)\n\nSister of the Calukya king Jayasinha II (1015-1042). In the course of her rule, additional divisions comprising sixty villages of Toragale, a hundred and forty villages of Masiyavadi and seventy villages of Bagadage were added to her province in Karnataka. She encouraged education by giving liberal grants to brahmapuris and agraharas (both settlements of Brahmins, where education was imparted), of Perur that accommodated five hundred students. She was known as ‘Joy of the student community. She was besides, an excellent warrior and fought and won a war against a rebel chief of Gokage. She had a secular outlook and had given grants to Jaina basadis and Hindu temples. She undertook pilgrimage to Varanasi. Like Ajjarasa, who had defeated many kings, a large number of soldiers and chiefs were proud to acknowledge Akkadevi as their ruler, capable and efficient. It is probable that Mayurasarman, ruler of Banawasi twelve thousand Province and Panungal one thousand, was here husband.\n\n1025-51 Reigning Abbess Heilka I von Rothenburg of Niedermünster in Regensburg (Germany)\n\nDuring the reign of her predecessor the Ladies Chapter for Noble Ladies was placed directly as a fief under the king of Germany.\n\n1027-37 Regent Dowager Queen Miriam Artsruni of United Georgia\n\nAfter the death of her husband, Giorgi I (1014-27), she shared the regency with the grandees, particularly with the dukes Liparit and Ivane. In 1031/2, she paid a visit to Romanos III Argyros’s court at Constantinople on behalf of her son, and returned with a peace treaty, the dignity of curopalates and the Byzantine bride Helena (daughter of Romanos III’s brother Basil) for her son. She continued to play a prominent role in Georgia’s politics even after Bagrat assumed full reigning powers. The Georgian chronicles speak of the Armenians being her subjects because of her parentage, a possible reference to a three-month long Georgian control of Ani before the city was finally annexed by the Byzantines in 1045, and report a disagreement between her and her son regarding the future of her step-son, Demetre, who defected to the Byzantines in 1033 handing over the fortress of Anacopia. She advocated the reconciliation between the brothers and made a futile attempt at bringing the rebellious Demetre back to loyalty. During Bagrat’s enforced exile at the Byzantine court in the 1050s, She accompanied her son and spent three years with him in residence at Constantinople during the reign of Constantine IX Monomachos. According to the Life of George the Hagiorite, after the marriage of her granddaughter Martha-Maria to Michael VII Ducas in 1065, she traveled to Antioch with the intention to make a further pilgrimage to Jerusalem, carrying with her an imperial order for the governor and patriarch of Antioch.

The marriage lasted barely six years before she poisoned him, and married the epileptic weakling Michael IV Paphiagonian, who had her cloistered in 1041. This enforced confinement was short-lived as the Byzantine nobles rebelled against Michael. She was released from her confinement, and Michael was himself cloistered in a monastery by the nobles. She now ruled jointly with her older sister Theodora in 1042, and married again, this time to Constantine IX Monomachus aged 42, and both reigned till her death.

But he was not able to completely remove her power as her relatives held important offices so he tried reconciliation in 1037 by visiting her regularly to pay his respects. In 1039 she was permitted to return to the capital where she underwent the rebirth ceremony to re-establish her position in the eyes of the Khitan nobility.
