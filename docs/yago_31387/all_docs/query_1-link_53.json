        "text": "Pilgrimages of princes from the Piast dynasty in the Middle Ages (summary) The aim of the article is to discuss various aspects and types of pilgrimages of kings and princes from the Piast dynasty in the Middle Ages. The analysis embraces penitentiary pilgrimages, pilgrimages “ad Sanctos”, “ad locam sanctam”, peregrinations to the Holy Land, the participation of Polish monarchs in Teutonic crusades to Lithuania and Samogitia. The article also addresses the effects of the participation of the Piasts in pilgrimages such as foundations for various church institutions.\n\nThe Chronica Polonorum, written by Bishop Vincentius of Cracow (c.1150–1223), influenced the way Polish history was written by presenting a specific memory of the participation of the Piast dynasty in wars against the Prussians. This article presents the three major references to these wars against heathen tribes of the North in 1147, 1166 and 1192. Vincentius' account gave meaning to the Piast expeditions as holy wars and influenced court tradition by establishing the image of individual Piasts as well as their dynasty as a whole. These accounts shaped how their participants were remembered in specific historical contexts and influenced the future participation of the Poles in crusading. The article reveals the use of the term ‘Saladinistas’, not found anywhere else in the surviving twelfth-century sources. The memory created by Vincentius became inseparable from the cultural heritage of the nation for whom he was the first native historian.\n\nThe article discusses the conflict of succession in Poland after the death of Mieszko I between his widow Oda and his oldest son Boleslaw Chrobry. It argues that Oda appealed to German King Otto III and Pope John XV in defense of the rights to inheritance of her oldest son. This view is based on a new interpretation of the document know in historiography as Dagome iudex. The authors suggests that the original lost document, the summarized contents of which had been known as Dagome iudex, was not issued by Mieszko I but by his widow Oda Haldensleben. Dagome was Oda's representative, and not her husband, as is commonly assumed. Dagome may have been a monk from the St Emmeram monastery at Regensburg who later became archbishop of Magdeburg. The document referred to the oldest son of Mieszko I and Oda who used two names Mieszko-Lambert, and not to two sons named Mieszko and Lambert"
