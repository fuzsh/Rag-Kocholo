        "text": "Prince Coloman, second son of King Andrew II (1205–1235), younger brother of King Béla IV (1235–1270) is probably not among the best-known members of the Árpádian dynasty (1000–1301), or the medieval Hungarian rulers, yet, his life was quite extraordinary. He was the second member in his dynasty with this given name after King Coloman the Learned (1095–1116). The later King of Galicia and Duke of Slavonia was born in 1208 as the fourth child of Andrew II and Queen Gertrud of Andechs, therefore, he was a prince of the ruling dynasty. He was barely six years old when he was engaged to Salomea, the daughter of Leszek the White (Biały), Duke of Cracow as a result of the agreement between their fathers in the Spiš in 1214. Not long after he was crowned king of a principality of the Kievan Rus’, Galicia (Halych). He received the necessary approval and a crown from Pope Innocent III (1198–1216) on that occasion. Coloman was in a minor age whilst his rule in Galicia, therefore he was in no position to shape the course of events there. He was the sufferer of his father’s will and the circumstances. The cooperation of the Hungarian king and Prince Leszek of Cracow was not without problems, in fact, it was full of conflicts despite the agreement of Spiš (1214). Therefore, we cannot speak of a continuous Polish–Hungarian coalition, it was rather a rivalry. The competing rulers came to agreements several times, with various terms and outcomes, meanwhile Leszek the White supported the claims of one or another princes of the Rus’ (e.g. Vladimir, Roman Igorevich and Daniel Romanovich). Andrew II, on the contrary, had a sole goal, the security of the Hungarian supremacy, regardless the fact which of his sons could represent it: either Coloman as king, or the youngest sibling, Andrew as prince. The disaffection of a certain part of the Hungarian elite forced the king to allow for the coronation of his eldest son, Béla in 1214: their intention was to divide the power in the realm. Nevertheless, the lack of territorial power prevented the fragmentation in Andrew II’s realm despite the enthronement of Béla, even though a new court was established around the crown-prince in which new positions opened up for the members of the kingdom’s elite: they got new tracks to increase their influence. The events in Galicia had quite similar effects, the Hungarian elite was willing to make practical use of the Hungarian expansion there. This situation did not change radically after the end of Coloman’s kingdom, and the establishment of Prince Andrew’s territorial rule and court in 1227 even created a new centre and presented further possibilities for the elite to gain offices and donations. The Hungarian princes had their fair share in King Andrew II’s expansion, which was combined with the Christian mission to the vicinal territories. Béla supported the conversion of the Cumans, Coloman was interested in the fight against the Bosnian heresy, whereas Andrew’s reign probably was meant to prepare the union of the local orthodox church with Rome, yet, the lack of support in his environment made this endeavour impossible, if there were any attempts at all. In our opinion, Coloman’s Galician kingdom established a precedent in the north-eastern vicinity of the Hungarian Kingdom. A few decades later and under different circumstances, Prince Daniel was also crowned with a diadem sent from the papal Curia in 1253. The two cases, even though they are not identical, bear common features, since Daniel was raised in Hungary between 1206–13 and he was probably aware of the meaning of the act of the coronation; therefore, it was probably not a coincidence that he sought alliance in the West after the Mongol invasion in 1241. To favour this quest he accepted the crown offered by Pope Innocent IV as well as the requirement of the ecclesiastical union bound to it. Daniel’s desire for the royal title is probably one of the many effects of the Hungarian rule on the Principality of Galicia. The young king and his wife, Salomea were forced to leave Galicia around 1221, and they moved to Hungary and settled down in the Spiš, whilst he kept his royal title. At first Coloman had no share in the government of the realm (no measures of his concerning the territory have come down to us from this period), his charters which handled affairs of the Spiš region were all issued at later dates. His seclusion ended in 1226 when his father placed him on the top of the provinces of Dalmatia, Croatia and Slavonia, which previously had been controlled by his brother, Prince Béla. Coloman travelled already in 1226 to the coastal towns, where he presented himself as the new duke through several solemn entries. Yet, the sources offer a detailed picture of his rule in the territory of the so-called whole Slavonia only from 1229 on. Coloman handled a wide spectrum of cases. For instance, he privileged hospes-communities (among others in Dubica, Samobor or Varaždin) on several occasions and favoured Bishop Stephen of Zagreb in his endeavours, such as the case of the planned union of his bishopric with the archbishopric of Split. Coloman also supported his brother in the revision of the former royal donations before and after 1235, i.e. the death of their father, Andrew II. The duke of Slavonia took part alongside his family in the campaign against the Babenberg dynasty’s Austrian provinces, whereas Pope Gregory IX (1227-1241) two times entrusted him as lay protector of widowed Polish duchesses.Coloman occupied himself not only in the affairs of his duchy and his family, but also acted as a warlord; the duke probably invaded Bosnia and attacked its ruler (ban), who was accused of heresy, Matej Ninoslav. Nevertheless, his assumable conquest did not last long, as Béla IV had to lead a campaign to Bosnia as early as 1247. The duke’s martial skills are, however, undoubted: he showed a great deal of valiance in the battle of Muhi in 1241, where he managed to resist the Mongol offensive, yet, a few weeks later he died in Slavonia of the wounds he suffered in this combat. Coloman’s reign had an impact, among other things, on the establishment of the concept of the so-called whole Slavonia and the urbanization of the area through the help provided for foreign settlers under his rule. His relationship to his elder brother also has to be emphasized: it was a unique phenomenon in the Árpádian dynasty since even Béla’s accession to throne did not cast a shadow on it. Coloman, second son to Andrew II, brother of Béla IV may not be the most famous member of the Árpáds, the first Hungarian dynasty, still, he deserves our closer attention. His life is relevant because of great many things; its various episodes are interesting not only for Hungarian, but also for Ukrainian, Polish, Slovak, Croatian and Bosnian historiography and, last but not least, the wider public. Nevertheless, previously the diversity of Coloman’s life led to contradictory statements, and this is one of the reasons why the authors of this book decided to take a closer look at the question. One has to examine the remaining sources carefully to be able to trace down the events so that the details of the life of such an extraordinary man could get the attention it deserves."
