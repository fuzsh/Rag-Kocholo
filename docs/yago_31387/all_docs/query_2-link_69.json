This is a history of Europe, but the continent is interpreted widely to include the Near East and North Africa as well. The volume is divided into two Parts of which this, the second, deals with the course of events, ecclesiastical and secular, and major developments in an age marked by the transformation of the position of the papacy in a process fuelled by a radical reformation of the church, the decline of the western and eastern empires, the rise of western kingdoms and Italian elites, and the development of governmental structures, the beginnings of the recovery of Spain from the Moors and the establishment of western settlements in the eastern Mediterranean region in the wake of the crusades.

No collaborative venture is free of collective risk, and volume iv of The New Cambridge Medieval History - the largest volume in the series - has been no exception: more than ten years have passed in its compilation. In Part i, of those scholars originally planning to contribute, five were unable to deliver. We are exceptionally grateful to the distinguished historians who stepped forward and wrote chapters for us in their place. In Part 2 the fluctuations and the obstacles which we encountered were more problematic. Of those scholars originally planning to contribute three died before beginning to write, and five others were unable to deliver. We are similarly and exceptionally grateful to the distinguished historians who also stepped forward and wrote chapters for us in their place and at short notice. We have also to express our regrets at the more recent deaths of Giovanni Tabacco and of Tom Keefe who wrote his contribution while terminally ill. D.E.L. J.R.-S. XV Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We have many debts to acknowledge with gratitude in the course of the prepa- ration of this volume. Expertise has been generously provided by copy-editors, translators, secretaries, cartographers, illustrationists, typesetters and others.

The Balkans and the Levant were in no state to take advantage of beneficial economic forces which were just as much at work in them as in western Europe. The Byzantine empire had been gravely damaged by the occupation of most of Asia Minor by nomadic Turks, although, in a situation reminiscent of the barbarian incursions of the third century, rebellious ‘Roman’ generals had to a large extent brought this on themselves by inviting the Turks in as mercenaries. The empire had no more than a shadow of a presence in central Greece and the Balkans and it suffered from the fact that it had never had great trading or industrial sectors which could have helped to compensate for its territorial losses: Constantinople had been at best a great consumer city. Profitable commercial centres needed to be on trade routes rather than at the end of them and when he encouraged Venetian and Pisan merchants to come to Constantinople the emperor Alexios I may have been trying to create the vital extra overseas leg that an international market of this kind would need. Syria and Palestine had been devastated in the wars between the Shi'ite Fatimids in Cairo and the Sunni Seljuq Turks ruling on behalf of the ‘Abbasid caliphate in Baghdad. The Muslim Near East had fallen into even deeper disarray just before the arrival of the First Crusade. In 1092 the greatest figure in Seljuq history, the vizier Nizam al-Mulk, the power behind the sultans for over thirty years, was murdered. A month later the sultan, Malikshah, died in suspicious circumstances, as did his wife, his grandson and other powerful figures. The ‘Abbasid caliph, al-Muqtadi, himself expired in 1094. The Seljuq sultanate disintegrated into localities in which pretenders and members of the family fought each other for power. In 1094 the Fatimid caliph, al-Mustansir, who had ruled in Cairo for fifty-eight years and had fiercely resisted the Seljuqs, 1 Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 2 JONATHAN RILEY-SMITH AND DAVID LUSCOMBE also died; so did his vizier, Badr al-Jamali. The First Crusade swept, therefore, into a region in which there was a vacuum of power. Western Europe may not have been a cosy place in which to live, but conditions there were infinitely better. With no significant outside threat the developments in education and administration described in the first part of this volume could proceed apace. The engine for change was provided by the Latin church, the only institution with a truly transcontinental role. Its trans- formation into an advanced governmental machine was partly a consequence of initiatives taken by the centre in a climate of opinion, secular as well as religious, which was in its favour. They proved to be astonishingly ambitious, although they did not at first comprise a detailed programme, since none of the main actors had a clear idea where they were going. These men wanted simply to restore the whole church to what they believed had been its pristine purity and were determined to use the central organs of ecclesiastical government to bring this about. Over the course of the next three centuries, in one of the most revolutionary periods in the history of the church, the papacy, insisting on its independent authoritative voice and reinforcing this with institutional controls, was able to loosen the framework of pre-existing doctrinal authority, provided above all by the decisions of the first seven (or eight) general councils. It would be going too far to assert that it was now free-wheeling - indeed it always assured anyone who would listen of its devotion to precedent, previous councils and scripture - but its pre-eminence and the respect with which its voice was generally heard meant that it could oversee doctrinal adaptation and development. Between 1123 and 1312 it summoned no less than seven new gen- eral councils while the judgements streaming from the papal curia meant that the standard codification of canon law, Gratian’s Decretum, had to be regularly updated with supplementary works. Authority for Latins, therefore, came to be not static, but continually developing, and Catholic doctrine came to be characterized by a succession of pronouncements on faith and morals, each claiming, of course, to be only expressing what had been in the mind of the church from the start. Ambition alone would not have been enough, of course, to transform the role of the popes from a relatively passive to a consistently proactive one. It cannot be said often enough that advances in government depend as much on the governed as the governors. Few rulers have proved themselves to be so foolish as to establish elaborate machinery with nothing to do; central offices have emerged in response to the creation of business. In the middle ages this was on the whole generated from below as subjects sought arbitration or judge- ment, but nobody would seek a judicial decision from a court impractically distant from his or her home or from one whose procedures were perceived to be uncertain. The church already had an apparatus of public courts, each Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 Introduction 3 within a reasonable distance of every baptized Christian. These were the courts of the bishops, which is one of the reasons why control over the episcopate became such an issue in the eleventh century. The papacy’s encouragement of the scholarship needed if the law - canon law - applicable everywhere by these courts was to be clarified and systematized created the conditions for ordinary Christians to seek judgement in them. The process of change began with the arrival in Rome after the election of Pope Leo IX in 1049 of a group of radical reformers, under the influence of a movement which had been growing in monastic circles for half a century. The papacy, powered by an intense moral seriousness, placed itself in the forefront of change for almost the only time in its history, risking its own prestige in the process. Its radicalism was of a historical kind, based in its eyes on prece- dent and past authority, and it seems to have been barely conscious of the consequences of some of its initiatives, but no one can question the energy and intransigence with which it pursued its goals: it challenged the Byzantine empire and the patriarchate of Constantinople; it tried to establish free pa- pal elections; it revived ancient half-forgotten legislation on clerical celibacy, episcopal schools and legations; it claimed lordship over important regions of western Europe; it developed the unprecedented notion of penitential warfare and invented crusading; and it set out to submit all episcopal hierarchies, in- cluding those in the eastern patriarchates, to the see of Peter. In a remarkably short time the sacramental and penitential theology of the Latin church was transformed, much of it in ways that directly affected ordinary Christians such as the geographical location of purgatory and the establishment of universal rules for canonization and for the verification of relics. The way that the reformers’ trains of thought could lead them in directions far from that originally intended is illustrated by the election decree of 1059. This established that thenceforward papal elections were to be free. The cardinal bishops should first confer about the candidate and then summon the cardinal clergy. The remaining Roman clergy and people should assent to the choice. The king of Germany, the heir to the empire, was to have ‘due honour’. In effect the papacy was renouncing its traditional protector, in the name of the freedom, to which it was so committed, of the church from lay patronage. The reformers were inclined to ignore the many benefits that customary lay patronage had brought - not least the reform of their own institution by the emperor - but it would be wrong to suppose that they rejected protection in principle. On the contrary, they ardently desired it, since they knew that the church could not fulfil its functions efficiently without a strong secular arm assuring the order and security which was needed. That was why the elec- tion decree was ambiguously worded, why the policy enunciated in it was not consistently applied and why even two centuries later there remained an Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 4 JONATHAN RILEY-SMITH AND DAVID LUSCOMBE ambivalence in the relationship between church and state. But while to the eleventh-century reformers the prime justification of rulership and the chief duty given it by God was the protection of the church, a protector should know his place and should never try to interfere or control. They were convinced that lay patronage had got out of hand, to the point at which it was, in their eyes, wrong in itself. Their boldness can only be appreciated in the context of the uneasy rela- tionship between Rome and its own bishops which had been a constant in papal history. The city was now barely recognizable as a former imperial cap- ital. Fields and marshes took up much of the space within the ancient walls. Scattered among them were the tower-houses of the Roman nobles, whom the popes feared most of all, because it was in the nature of things that these men would try to dominate their local bishopric. Everyone knew, or thought they knew, that periods of papal degradation had coincided with those times when the nobles had had the upper hand. That is why the popes had sought assistance from Byzantine, Carolingian, Ottonian and Salian emperors. By renouncing imperial protection, which is what the reformers in Rome were effectively doing, they were exposing the papacy to real danger. A century and a half later Pope Innocent III, who was himself a member of a Roman noble family, thought he had found a solution in the exploitation of the papal patri- mony - so that as a powerful prince himself the pope could dominate the local magnates - but in the interim popes were often exiled from their see and forced to look for defenders who had the advantage, in their eyes, of being too weak to threaten them: south Italian Normans, fideles beati Petri and so on. Nothing demonstrates the force of the papacy’s commitment to its reform programme so much as its option for insecurity, but the extent of its achievement can be measured by comparing what was at the disposal of Innocent III around 1200 with the shadowy rights of his predecessors two centuries before. The energy of the reformers can easily be demonstrated by taking a half- hour’s drive through the countryside of western Europe today and counting the sites where a church was built in the central middle ages. The resources committed to the construction of major stone edifices in almost every village - if that is what a miserable collection of huts could be called - almost passes comprehension. There had been no building programme on this scale since the Roman empire, but to a society which appreciated display it demonstrated the standing of the church and its influence. This was coming to be felt everywhere, even in warfare, that most political of all activities, which was not only sacralized in the crusades, but also ritualized at every level. In the heartlands of Latin Europe, where the concern was, often against the odds, for a more efficient government, the church provided at the same time a model and a hindrance in that its insistence on the management of its own affairs limited the influence Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 Introduction 5 that kings and magnates could have over an important institution on which they had relied in their administration. A theme of the period is the forms of resistance rulers employed, from waging war in late eleventh-century Italy to fomenting schism or demanding a redrawing of the boundaries between secular and ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the twelfth century. Wherever in western Europe an apparatus of courts was still recognizably under a ruler’s control and was staffed by officials answerable in some degree to him centralization was possible. In England the Normans took care not to dismantle the system they found there, although, as elsewhere, it coexisted with local jurisdictions and with courts Christian. King Henry II’s introduction of the possessory assizes is an example of the importance of having accessible courts and easily understandable procedures working in tandem; the result, in the aftermath of a period of disorder, was a stream of cases flowing into royal courts and a consequent growth in royal authority. Historians of medieval England take pride in what they consider to be a precociously advanced system of government with a wealth of records, but England was not unique. The Norman kingdom of Sicily, divided between the island, which following its conquest in the eleventh century was firmly in the hands of its ruler, and the mainland, where a number of individual principalities had grown up, was an example of experimentation in government every bit as impressive as that in England. In both cases, however, rulership worked well because the country concerned was relatively small geographically. Size was always an important factor. The western empire, which in the year iooo had looked somewhat similar to England in governmental terms, had begun to disintegrate by noo. In Germany this was to lead to the rise of the principalities and in northern Italy to the communes. The empire suffered from a succession of civil wars, but it is arguable that it was simply too big to be effectively administered as a whole once the expectations of its subjects had grown beyond a certain level. It is noticeable that none of its constituent parts challenged the theory of its existence; all of them found a way of man- aging their own affairs within a framework which they nevertheless succeeded in emasculating. France, another country too large for effective centralized control, had already fragmented and in the early eleventh century this led to intolerable levels of internal disorder. The situation had improved by noo, but for almost a century thereafter parts of the kingdom suffered intermittently from internal warfare, often because the princes were trying to reduce their own territories to order. The steps taken around 1200 by King Philip II to raise his profile by advancing royal authority into lordships which had already been reconsolidated were, however, made harder than they need have been, because one magnate, the king of England, had accumulated far more land than was healthy for the kingdom as a whole. Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 6 JONATHAN RILEY-SMITH AND DAVID LUSCOMBE Centralization is not everything and where an apparatus of jurisdiction had fragmented or decayed it was not possible to rebuild it, which is why the em- pire under Frederick Barbarossa and the crown of France under a succession of Capetian kings had to make use of other means to enlarge the scope of royal authority. In both Germany and France the rulers exploited feudal rela- tionships, since these at least provided them with services of various kinds and a legal framework for loyalty and obedience, but over time the consequences were to be completely different, because in Germany the fragmentation came to be reinforced, whereas in France the crown was eventually going to triumph. Before 1200 these processes were only in their early stages and, without agreeing entirely with the communitarian theories which have been argued recently, it is certainly the case that feudal lordship was not yet the force it was to be by the end of the thirteenth century. Indeed if there was one issue that was at the forefront of the minds of landowners in the late eleventh and twelfth centuries it was not lordship and the possession of tenancies, which are characteristic of feudal holdings, but family. Blood relationships, which endured, of course, as a major political fac- tor into modern times, provided western Europe with another kind of internal unity. The most significant difference between them and association by lord- ship was that whereas lordship tended to operate in the localities they were cosmopolitan, as families searched further afield for suitable spouses, partly in response to the very strict rules of consanguinity which the church was trying to impose. Rotrou of Perche, the count of Mortagne on the frontiers of Nor- mandy around 1100, for example, was related to the kings of Aragon through his aunt and to the viscount of Turenne in Limousin through the marriage of his sister. At about the same time the daughters of Count William Tete Hardi of Burgundy were married to the duke of Burgundy and the counts of Flanders, Savoy and Bar-le-Duc. And one of William’s sons was married to the heiress of Castile. International bonds of kinship straggled, like Cistercian filiations, from Britain and Scandinavia to the Levant, binding westerners together culturally. Dynastic relationships had strong effects on the periphery. Recent research on the settlers in Syria and Palestine has shown how closely they were in touch with their relations in the west. The families thrown into prominence there were often not of the highest rank. The Montlherys, the first clan to exploit the crusading movement, must have been predisposed in some way to respond to the earliest calls to crusade since so many members took part. Two Montlherys were among the first settlers in the Levant, and one of them was independently related to the greatest figures there and was talented enough to be rewarded by them with lordship. He in turn patronized other relations, including new arrivals. Members of the family were, therefore, well placed when they were provided with an opportunity to seize the crown in 1118. And the characteristic Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 Introduction 7 way that the instinct for cooperation and mutual assistance would bring a whole kindred-group, or a substantial part of it, into line behind an initiative is demonstrated by the attempts by relations, in the west as well as in the east, to respond to needs of their colonial cousins through visits to Palestine, through the use of whatever influence they had at home or through settlement themselves. The path taken by the Montlherys was to be followed a few decades later by the Lusignans and in the thirteenth century by the Briennes. Crusading was so dependent on the reactions of committed European kin-groups that it could be manipulated by them relatively easily. Western government was marked everywhere by experimentation and inno- vation. This was particularly the case in the new settlements in which character- istic features of frontier administration, marcher lordships, gave their holders freedom to experiment. In Spain and in the Levant western conquerors were faced by the absorption of large numbers of indigenous of other religions and evolved measures to cope with them, most being variations on existing Muslim dhimmi regulations for subject peoples. But a feature before 1200 was that on many frontiers the papacy had much less influence than in the heartlands, in spite of the facts that the Levantine colonies had been created out of the papal crusading movement, Spain was a region on which it had concentrated much of its effort in the eleventh century and the king of Sicily was a papal vassal. The nature of the conquest, the accession of rulers who had not been in the forefront of reform and the poor quality of the clergy who had accompanied the First Crusade were responsible for a patriarchate of Jerusalem which com- prised possibly the most backward and unreformed collection of provinces in Latin Christendom. In Spain and Sicily the church fell into the pockets of the kings. The reason for its relative weakness seems to have been that it had not yet evolved instruments to cope with the imposition of Latin Christianity in regions which had not known it. So on the frontiers, at a time when it was trumpeting its freedom from lay influence, it was still as dependent on secular power as it had been in the days of Charlemagne and the Ottonian emperors. Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 CHAPTER 2 THE PAPACY, 1024-1122 Uta-Renate Blumenthal INTRODUCTION General The author of a chapter on the history of the papacy from 1024 to 1122 confronts the unusual task of giving in a few pages an account of both the Adelspapsttum and of the popes of the Gregorian reform period. No greater contrast could be imagined, one might think. After the clean-sweep of Sutri and Rome in 1046, when ecclesiastical councils under the guidance of Emperor Henry III cleared the way for the first of the northern newcomers, Pope Clement II (1046-7), a fundamentally altered papacy is supposed to have arisen from the ashes of a papacy dominated by the corrupt local Roman nobility. And, indeed, profound changes occurred in the second half of the eleventh century, although with regard less to the papacy itself as an institution than to its relationship with the churches of the empire (Germany, Italy and, at times, Burgundy), the Normans of Italy, the principalities and kingdom of France and the Byzantine patriarchate. Because of the Conquest and the special relationship between the papacy and the English kings from William I to Henry I, England stood somewhat apart in this reordering, as did Spain on account of the Reconquista. 1 It involved the successful realization of the papal primacy. This was not limited to the secular realm, but also deeply affected relationships within the church. The history of these changes can be found in an earlier chapter as well as in many handbooks and will only be sketched very briefly here. 2 The present chapter will emphasize the administrative underpinning that allowed a strengthened papacy to emerge at the end of the twelfth century under Innocent III (1198- 1216) as the single most influential political and spiritual institution of Latin Christendom. It will cover the initial stages of this development, since they 1 Cowdrey (1972) and (1989); Fornasari (1989); Garcia y Garcia (1989); Erdmann (1935). 2 NCMH, iv, Part 1, ch. 9. 8 Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 The papacy, 1024— 1122 9 unfolded precisely in the period from c. 1012 to 1123 and form a continuous theme. The tenth-century background The popes of the tenth and early eleventh centuries never renounced the proud papal traditions represented in the more recent past by Nicholas I (858-67) and John VIII (872-82). But because the ties between the pope and the Frankish rulers, which had helped to shift the focus of the papacy from Byzantium to northern Europe in the eighth century, had weakened considerably during the break-up of the Carolingian empire and the effectiveness of the popes had declined, the papacy of the tenth century came to depend increasingly on local Roman and Italian factions. Near-anarchy north and south of the Alps greatly constricted the papal vision as well as the papal sphere of action. Not even the revival of the western imperial tradition by the Ottonian rulers in 962 could break the vicious cycle which threatened to make the papacy permanently a merely local force. The affair of Pope Formosus (891-6) shows vividly that it was even an advantage for the church, when with Sergius III (904-11) one of the several rival factions in Rome gained the definite ascendancy over the others. Formosus had been bishop before his election, and canon law forbade the translation of bishops to other sees, since they were considered married to their churches of ordination. The opponents of Formosus, therefore, possessed an excellent weapon. At the infamous synod of 896/7, Pope Stephen VII had the decaying corpse of Formosus dressed in papal regalia, deprived him of his rank and finally had the mutilated corpse cast into the Tiber. For almost two decades afterwards it was hotly debated whether or not Formosus had been pope legally and whether or not, therefore, his ordinations had been and remained valid. Writings supporting Formosus are vivid illustrations of the confusion and violence reigning in Rome at the time, and incidentally provided some of the most potent arguments in the eleventh-century quarrel over the validity of simoniacal ordination between Peter Damian and Humbert of Silva Candida. The success of Sergius III, since 897 the anti-Formosan candidate for the papacy, was primarily due to the support of his cause by Theophylact. Theo- phylact and his direct heirs dominated Rome until 963, when the Crescentians and eventually the Tusculans succeeded to his role. Under the princeps Alberic II (932-955), grandson of Theophylact, Rome enjoyed the greatest degree of se- curity and tranquillity in the entire century. Alberic completely dominated the papacy, but his rule also brought monastic reforms to Rome. They were in- spired and personally guided by Abbot Odo of Cluny. Alberic’s son, Octavian, not only continued to rule temporal Rome, but also became pope under the name of John XII (955-64). Not until 1012 was Crescentian control over the Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 IO UTA-RENATE BLUMENTHAL papacy to be broken. The Tusculan party succeeded in replacing the Roman branch of the Crescentians in May of that year, when within a week both Pope Sergius IV (1009-12) and the patrician John had died. Gregory, elevated to the papacy by the Crescentian party, was defeated and replaced by the Tusculan Theophylact as Benedict VIII. The Tusculan popes Benedict VIII (1012-24) In contrast to the Crescentians, who had largely relied on the entrenchment of their own dynasty and their supporters in the duchy of Rome as secular magnates and landowners - often at the expense of the temporal property of the Roman church - the Tusculans used their secular power and successes to shore up the standing of the papacy among the Roman nobility. The position of patrician, so important to Crescentian rule, remained vacant. Benedict VIII, in particular, fought successfully to restore to the Roman church some of the properties that had been alienated through long-term emphyteusis to lay magnates. At the same time the pontiff also lent his support to monasteries such as Farfa south of Rome in reclaiming alienated property. The synod of Pavia of 1022, celebrated jointly by Benedict and Emperor Henry II, betrays the same spirit, although an element of moral reform of the clergy was also present and should not be underestimated. 3 Successful restitutions of rights and property to the apostolic see were none the less negligible, if the abject poverty of the papacy in the mid-eleventh century provides an acceptable measure. In the long run, therefore, other aspects of Benedict’s reign were better suited to shore up and preserve traditional papal rights as they had evolved in the Carolingian period. Benedict’s cooperation with the emperor and his need for a military alliance brought about a visit to Henry II at Bamberg in 1020. On this occasion the pope received an imperial privilege which repeated with a few additions the Ottonianum, which had confirmed the papal lands granted in earlier Frankish donations. The document, known as the Henricianum, played a subsidiary but nevertheless important role in conjunction with the Donation of Constantine in documenting papal sovereignty and the geographical extent of the papal states for centuries to come. The cooperation between pope and emperor also shaped other aspects of papal policy far beyond the reigns of the Tusculan popes themselves. Among them are administrative changes with regard to the chancery, as well as the seemingly innocuous introduction of the filioque clause. A synod gathered 3 MGH Constitutiones, i, no. 34, pp. 70-7; cf. Capitani (1966), Pavia 1046. The fight for the restitution of ecclesiastical property might itself constitute reform, cf. Garcia y Garcia (1989), p. 246. Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 The papacy, 1024— 1122 11 in Rome on the occasion of Henry’s imperial coronation in 1014 agreed to follow in future the Frankish custom of including the Nicene creed among the prayers of the mass on Sundays and holidays. The venerable creed was now to contain the filioque whose Frankish origin was quickly forgotten. It was accepted as so typically Roman that Byzantine objections to the filioque became a fundamental issue in the break between Rome and Constantinople in 1054. More important still was the fact that since the time of Charlemagne it had become customary for new archdioceses to be established only through the pa- pacy. The pontiff would determine the geographical extent of an ecclesiastical province as well as the seat of the new archbishop. An archbishop, furthermore, could only assume his duties after he had obtained the pallium, once it had been consecrated by the pope over the tomb of St Peter in Rome. Eventually, in the late eleventh century, the conferring of the pallium made the archbishop seem more like the popes deputy with a delegated share in the universal pri- macy. It is true, of course, that rulers who were powerful enough to establish new archbishoprics like Otto I (Magdeburg 963) or Henry II (Bamberg 1020) also were strong enough to influence the papacy, but formally at least papal control determined the shape of the church in the particular kingdoms. When political circumstances permitted, the papacy could translate such control into real terms, or try to do so. Gregory IV (827-44), for example, intervened in the revolt of 830 against Louis the Pious on the side of Lothar I and his bishops. The pope was unsuccessful on this occasion, because most of the Frankish episcopate supported Louis, but in the course of the negotiations Gregory IV had reinter- preted instructions of Pope Leo I (440-61), stating that the pope alone possessed the fullness of power {plenitudo potestatis ) whereas the bishops were entrusted only with partial responsibility ( pars sollicitudinis). By the end of the eleventh century this declaration was frequently used to justify papal supremacy. By then it encountered little opposition among the episcopate which thus abandoned the old collegial understanding of the church at least in practice. With an attri- bution to Pope Vigilius, the text found its place in the Pseudo-Isidorian Decre- tals, thus becoming part of this sophisticated corpus of Frankish forgeries from the mid-ninth century, which also included the Donation of Constantine. 4 Monastic privileges In addition to the use of legates, who continued to represent the papacy on solemn occasions, especially councils, throughout the seculum ohscurum, the influence of the papacy and veneration for St Peter is also evident in the growing 4 Decretales Pseudo-Isidorianae-, Fuhrmann (197-4). Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 12 UTA-RENATE BLUMENTHAL appeals to Rome for papal protection or even exemption of monasteries and, eventually, bishoprics. Papal protection, well into the eleventh century usually side by side with royal or imperial protection, meant that a particular abbey was protected by St Peter; an attack on such an abbey was at the same time an attack on St Peter. Frequently such a privilege included the right to the free election of the abbot or abbess. Expanded protection brought with it the exemption of an abbey from episcopal supervision at least in part. The extent of the exemption varied and was never absolute. The history of the Burgundian abbey of Cluny, founded by the duke of Aquitaine in 909, is an example of the various stages of protection/exemption. The foundation charter immediately provided for full independence from secular authority, free abbatial elections and papal protection ( tuitio and defensio). The monastery was given to St Peter and St Paul. Every five years Cluny was to pay a census of ten solidi in recognition of this protection. The right of free abbatial elections, interpreted as the right to the designation of a worthy successor, contributed at first far more to Cluny’s development than did papal protection. The abbots were thus able to prevent any decline in reforming zeal or the strictness of life and morals. It was only the later protection of Cluny by kings and popes that eventually led to Cluny’s exemption from diocesan authority through the papacy. The final step in a complex process was the privilege of 1024 bestowed by Pope John XIX on Cluny to terminate all the bitter disputes and struggles between the abbey and the bishops of Macon, who had lost large portions of diocesan income because of Cluny’s partial exemption. 5 Given the fame and influence of Cluny it is easy to understand how the abbey’s links to St Peter strengthened not only the monastery but also the prestige and influence of St Peter’s earthly successor, the pope. In general it must be said, however, that the two successors of Benedict VIII, John XIX (1024-32) and Benedict IX (1032-44; 1045-6; 1047-8), were less successful than their predecessor. The regnal years of Benedict IX’s pontificate with their frequent interruptions are a tell-tale sign. His pontificate was interrupted by first a resignation, secondly a deposition and thirdly a defeat. 6 Legacy Nevertheless, veneration for the successor of St Peter was kept alive in many ways: by the many pilgrims; probably hardly less so by the export of Italian relics; the papal right to the imperial coronation; and the first instances of the canonization of saints through popes. Up to the end of the tenth century, the cult of a saint had evolved spontaneously and locally, but in 993 John XV 5 Cowdrey (1970). 6 Kempf (1969), pp. 247—57; Herrmann (1973); Schimmelpfennig (1984), ch. 5, pp. inff. Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 The papacy, 1024— 1122 13 became the first pope to proclaim a saint officially at the request of the German ruler. The cult of Bishop Ulrich of Augsburg prescribed for the universal church by John, of five Polish martyrs by John XVIII and of the Armenian hermit Symeon by Benedict VIII were the first steps in a process that was to lead under Pope Innocent III to the exclusive papal prerogative of canonization. The role of the imperial coronation in the history of the papacy has been evaluated in an earlier chapter. 7 Here a reminder suffices that no king who hoped to be emperor, or needed the title to maintain his sovereignty, could afford to forget his dependence on papal support. Whatever the strengths and weaknesses of an individual who occupied the throne of St Peter, therefore, the papacy as an institution was well prepared for the universal role it was to assume under the popes of the reform period. The foundations on which they could build were laid firmly, not least in the canon- ical collections of the time. In practical terms the successes of a great pontiff like Nicholas I were ephemeral, 8 but they were invaluable in legal and theo- retical terms. The increasing separation between the eastern and the western halves of the church in intellectual and political terms brought a decisive turn in the development of the Roman primacy. Without the patriarchate of Con- stantinople as a constant, practical reminder of the division of the patriarchal authority among five sees, the Roman patriarchal role was readily superseded by that of the universal primacy which had been attributed to the bishop of Rome as successor of St Peter for centuries in the Latin west. In 1054 two legates of Leo IX, the cardinals Frederick of Lorraine and Humbert of Silva Candida, excommunicated the patriarch of Constantinople, Michael Keroularios, as well as Emperor Constantine IX, an important step towards the permanent schism between the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches but also towards the universal papal primacy. The papacy during the reform period Simony and nicolaitism From the days of the synods of Sutri and Rome in 1046 to the Lateran council of 1123, where the compromise regarding royal investitures of bishops and abbots concluded at Worms between Henry V and legates of Pope Calixtus II was reluctantly ratified, the papacy developed into an international institution of the first rank. The aim in 1046 had simply been the reform of the church in Rome. Conditions there had become urgent concerns of ecclesiastical re- formers, among them monks, regular canons, bishops, princes, nobles and the laity in general. The twin evils corrupting the church and blemishing the 7 NCMH, iv. Part i, ch. 9. 8 NCMH, 11, ch. 21, pp. 563-86. Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 14 UTA-RENATE BLUMENTHAL image of the pure bride of Christ were simony and nicolaitism, that is clerical marriage. Simony took its name from Simon Magus (Acts 8:18-24) and was understood as the buying or selling of spiritual goods and offices as defined by Gregory the Great. Gregory distinguished three forms of simony: the munus a manu (money or gift), munus ab obsequio (services, favours) and munus a lin- gua (intercession) and reinforced the older notion that whoever sinned against the Holy Spirit by committing simony was a heretic. By the eleventh century, when the concept of the proprietary church had penetrated the church, simony appeared in numerous guises, especially that of different types of fees, for in- stance those required by monasteries for admissions. Investiture, a ceremony for the handing over of the symbols of office (crosier and ring for a bishop), was often also seen as linked to simony. Simony, therefore, was a complex problem and extremely difficult to pursue. The fight for celibacy among the clergy was much more clear-cut, but it also required much persistence on the part of the papacy, which had taken over the leadership of church reform since the days of Leo IX. On both issues much headway was made, as described in an earlier chapter, 9 although neither sin could be extirpated entirely. Simony and nico- laitism had troubled the church for centuries and continued to do so in future, albeit less blatantly. But it is clear that the pertinent ecclesiastical legislation laid down standards that were now accepted throughout Latin Christendom as a measure of commitment to the clerical life, giving rise to the criticism of the clergy among the laity which is so pronounced a factor in the later middle ages. Nevertheless, historians who emphasize ecclesiastical reforms as the chief characteristics of the papacy of the eleventh century are hard pressed to explain differences between this and other periods of reformation and renewal in the church. It is increasingly recognized that the crucial difference is the interpre- tation of the old concept of the papal primacy by the reformers. The two issues, primacy and reform, interacted, but constitute separate strands none the less. The papal primacy Even in the tenth century, when the popes were not particularly respected, no- body ever doubted the primacy of Rome, notwithstanding the quarrel over the archbishopric of Rheims which came to a head at the synod of Chelles. But Yves Congar put it well when he pointed out that on the whole in the pre-reform period the primacy of Rome was seen as an office or ministry distinguished by wisdom and moral authority within a church that was led by bishops and reg- ulated through councils. 10 Since the mid-eleventh century a forceful emphasis on canonical traditions, as handed down in the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals and 9 NCMH, iv, Part i, ch. 9. 10 Congar (1961), p. 196; Klinkenberg (1955). Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 The papacy, 1024— 1122 15 especially the Decretum of Burchard of Worms (d. 1025), 11 gradually enriched the concept of primacy until the Petrine texts (Matthew 16:18-19; Luke 22:32; John 21:15-17) were related exclusively to the Roman church and thus turned into a dogmatic truth. 12 Obedience to the pope became an aspect of faith; disobedience now was idolatry and therefore heresy. Disobedience is the fun- damental reason given for the excommunication of Henry IV by Gregory VTI 13 and that of Henry V by Urban II and by Paschal II in 1102. 14 The occasion was the Lateran council of that year. It also introduced as a new requirement a written profession of obedience to the pontiff from the participants of the council and from those being granted the pallium. 15 The roots of this eleventh-century transformation of the concept of pa- pal primacy were many; they can be found throughout the Latin church. Northern polemics apparently stressed the old rule that the pope could not be judged by anyone, especially not a layman like Emperor Henry III, who moreover had no rights with regard to the election of any cleric. The views of the Italian reformer Peter Damian had developed long before Leo IX and his Lotharingian/Burgundian companions brought reforms to Rome. Like many of his contemporaries throughout Latin Christendom, Damian literally regarded the authentic decrees of the fathers as sacri canones, as the sacred pronouncements of popes, councils and church fathers inspired by the Holy Spirit. Canons were equated with the divine law, and Peter Damian like others was convinced that it was impossible for the laws of God to contradict each other. Harmonization of seemingly contradictory passages was one of his main concerns. Of these there were many, since for Damian all councils, even if not papal or legatine, and all papal decretals - because the pope is the successor of St Peter - represented legal sources of universal validity. There was one excep- tion. Damian declared that a canon was no longer valid when it contradicted authentic papal decretals (‘si decretis Romanorum pontificum non concor- dat’). This straightforward principle served Damian as the touchstone for the authenticity of any canon, whatever its origin. 16 Differing from Cardinals Atto and Humbert of Silva Candida, Damian thus did not presuppose positive pa- pal confirmation of a canon. Instead, he was in agreement with the Decretum of Burchard of Worms, a canonical collection he frequently used. Reasoning from the principle of concordance just mentioned, Damian came to declare anyone a heretic who did not agree with the Roman church (‘haereticus esse 11 Fuhrmann (1972-4), 11, pp. 442-85. 12 Congar (1961). 13 Gregory VII, Register 111, 10a: ‘Et quia sicut christianus contempsit oboedire . . . meaque monita . . . spernendo . . . vinculo eum anathematis vice tua alligo’; ibid., vn, 14a: ‘Heinricus . . . non timens periculum inoboedientie, quod est scelus idolatrie . . . excommunicationem incurrit.’ 14 Blumenthal (1978), p. 21. 15 Ibid., pp. 21 ff; Gottlob (1936), pp. 8-10 and 49ff. 16 Ryan (1956), pp. 137# Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 I 6 UTA-RENATE BLUMENTHAL constat, qui Romanae ecclesiae non concordat’) • Slightly altered, this sentence is frequently attributed to Ambrose of Milan and is found in a very similar form in the dictatus papae of Gregory VII. 17 Many though not all of the reformers (Cardinal Deusdedit is one exception) implicitly and even explicitly equated the Apostle Peter, the pope and the Roman church. Thus obedience owed to the pontiff became absolute. This conviction, displayed so prominently in the dictatus papae of Gregory vii but shared equally by his immediate predecessors and successors, carried over into the secular sphere, as we would say today. It was expressed strikingly in the day-to-day activities of the papacy. The crusades, envisioned under papal leadership by Gregory VII and initiated by Urban II at the council of Clermont in 1095; the deposition of the French king and of the emperors Henry IV and Henry V; the policies towards Byzantium and last but not least towards the Normans in southern Italy: everywhere to some extent at least the principle of the papal primacy is at play, albeit indirectly. The Latin church, by now understood as the universal church, was directly under the control of the pope. The pontiff possessed the plenitudo potestatis and could not be judged or deposed. By the second half of the twelfth century at the latest the right to issue new legislation had become his alone; papal decretals became the most significant influence on the jurisprudence arising particularly at the universities in southern France and Italy. The popes alone could issue dispensations, make monasteries and collegiate churches exempt, create new dioceses or divide or relocate old bishoprics. The relative autonomy of the archbishops in particular was considerably weakened. The most important aids in the execution of papal policies were the new organization of the papal bureaucracy, the rise of the college of cardinals and the systematic use of legates. In addition to stressing the papal primacy within the church, Gregory VII and his successors also inverted the customary relationship between the monar- chies and the papacy. The Gelasian concept of the priestly and the secular power side by side within the one church whose head was Christ had been typical for the Carolingian world of the ninth century. This image dominated thought well into the later eleventh century. Gregory’s deposition of Henry IV and his claims to soverignty in Italy, Spain, the Mediterranean islands, Scandinavia, Poland, Bohemia, Hungary and last but not least England created conditions not at all unlike those envisioned in the forged Donation of Constantine. 18 By the early twelfth century the papacy was well on the way towards what has been described as the papal monarchy. 17 Gregory VII, Register 11, 55a, c. 26: ‘Quod catholicus non habeatur, qui non concordat Romane ecclesie.’ 18 Robinson (1990), pp. 17-27. Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 The papacy, 1024— 1122 17 THE PAPAL ADMINISTRATION From the Lateran palace to the curia The Lateran palace, for much of the period under consideration the papal residence, also served as administrative centre of the Roman church as well as of her temporal properties: the duchy of Rome and the patrimonies (landed estates) of the see of St Peter. Known simply as the episcopium in the time of Gregory the Great, the Lateran soon thereafter also was called patriarchium Lateranense in analogy to the eastern patriarchates. Finally, by the tenth century, sacrum palatium Lateranense became the standard expression, a designation that had appeared in the Donation of Constantine, most likely an eighth-century Roman forgery. Best known among early papal officials are the seven deacons of Rome, an influential oligarchy from whose ranks many of the early popes, including Gregory I, were elected. By the mid-tenth century, however, the lead- ing officials were the ‘judges’, a term then meaning dignitary rather than judge. The title might be replaced by ‘duke’, ‘consul romanorum’, prince and even ‘sentatrix’ in the case of the Roman lay magnates, who as iudices de militia were closely associated with the papacy. 19 This is also true for the prefect whose an- cient office was specifically linked with criminal and civic jurisdiction in the city of Rome. It was still significant under the popes of the reform period, gaining yet new lustre during the twelfth-century communal movement. 20 The office of vestararius should perhaps be thought of at times as even more influential. 21 Side by side and intermingled with the lay ‘judges’ were the iudices de clero, the chief papal administrators. They, too, were members of the Roman nobility and usu- ally married, for despite their misleading name they were only in minor orders. The group included the primicerius of the defensors and the primicerius and secundicerius of the notaries (organized like other groups into scholae ), the ar- carius and sacellarius responsible since the seventh century for finances, and the nomenculator in charge of alms; in the ninth century the protoscrinarius was also numbered among the ‘judges’. The offices of these seven ‘judges’ are described in two documents, known as the older and younger (1002-49, before 1032?) list of judges, respectively. 22 Whether the younger list reflects the influence of the imperial sacrum palatium at Pavia or not, it is certainly one of the traces 19 Regesta pontificum Romanorum: Italia pontificia, i, p. 185, no. 1.

Another is evidence which seems to imply that members of the Roman clergy were now more closely associated with the pope as palace clergy, including by 1018 acolytes and subdeacons (JL 4024) and by 1049 at the latest deacons (JL 4067 and JL 4163). 23 The link between the popes and cardinal priests and cardinal bishops, still predominantly liturgical, was reemphasized, for the later tenth- and early eleventh-century papal ceremonial in the Lateran palace as well as papal pro- cessions and station liturgies in the city of Rome were further elaborated, as witnessed by the younger list of judges. 24 Pope John XIX not only requested the bishop of Silva Candida to restore the liturgy at St Peters basilica in 1026 (JL 4076), but also invited Guido of Arezzo to come to Rome in order to reform church music. 25 Benedict VIII as well as John XIX, moreover, paid particular attention to the suburbicarian sees, like Porto, Silva Candida and Tivoli. 26 The chancery Tentative reform efforts - and perhaps it is only to us that they appear so tentative - extended beyond the papal ceremonial and the cardinal-bishoprics, however. By the later tenth century practical reforms must have been urgent, if the deterioration in the Roman curia! script of the few extant original docu- ments is any guide. The studies of Rabikauskas support the suggestions of Elze that many of the papal scribes, whether designated as notaries or scriniarii, were identical with Roman urban notaries, the tabelliones. This can only mean that the papal writing office had become so insignificant that it no longer needed permanent officials of its own. 27 The renewal of the imperial dignity in 962 and new links with the imperial Ottoman/ Saxon court influenced this later tenth- and early eleventh-century reorganization of the Lateran bureaucracy. The office of chancellor is the most important example. Under John XVIII (1004-9) the cancellarius sacri palatii Lateranensis became a constant designa- tion for the papal chancellor who functioned next to the bibliothecarius as a second official in charge of correspondence and privileges. 28 By 1023, when 23 Elze (1952), pp. 40-6. 24 Elze (1952), pp. 5off, with references to the Ordo of Benedict.

Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 The papacy, 1024— 1122 19 Pope Benedict VIII named Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne bibliothecarius, the chancellor evidently had assumed the functions of the librarian entirely. 29 Both offices were combined in 1037 by Pope Benedict IX in the person of Peter of Silva Candida (JL 4110). 30 Peter continued to hold these offices to his death in 1050, notwithstanding the extraordinary and fateful changes touching the papacy upon the intervention of Emperor Henry III at the synods of Sutri and Rome in 1046. Benedict IX had granted the offices to the bishops of Silva Candida in perpetuity, but only Humbert, one of the ecclesiastics who had accompanied Pope Leo IX to Rome, and his successor Mainard could secure the office of librarian/chancellor in the years 1057-63, when they were cardinal bishops of Silva Candida. 31 In general, it was preferred to entrust the office of chancellor to a lower-ranking cleric who would be able to devote himself exclusively to his secretarial duties. From 1063 the acolyte Peter occupied the position until 1084, when he deserted the cause of Pope Gregory VII and went over to Antipope Clement III. Famous is the long tenure of the chancellor John of Gaeta who took over in 1088 and remained until 1118, when he was elected pope as Gelasius II. John of Gaeta had been a monk at Monte Cassino where he had studied under the rhetorician Alberic. It was he who introduced the cursus into papal documents, used a new period for the calculation of the indiction and a new date for the beginning of the year. 32 However, despite the continuity of leadership in the papal chancery, lo- cated in the Lateran palace, the church reform of the eleventh century meant numerous changes in its personnel and, most visibly, in its products, primar- ily papal letters and privileges, although the chancery also maintained official registers. The antique custom of keeping official registers was revived at the latest under Pope Alexander II (1061-73), although from this period only the original manuscript of the register of Gregory VII (1073-85) has survived in the Archivio Segreto of the Vatican. 33 The papal archives seem to have been kept in part at the Lateran palace and in part at a tower near the arch of Constantine. 34 Only Roman scribes were trained in the traditional curial script, but they rarely 29 Bresslau (1912), pp. 2i9ff. 30 Herrmann (1973), p. 24, inappropriately describes the new office as a Superministerium.

The popes, therefore, had to rely on local assistants or members of their entourage, who usually were obliged to substitute Carolingian minuscule for the curial script. Moreover, it was necessary to use parchment instead of papyrus, which was becoming rare at this time and could not be obtained north of the Alps. The replacement of the curial script, however, was certainly not intentional, for under Stephen IX and his successors to Pope Calixtus II (1119-24) it reap- peared and was used side by side with the minuscule until it disappeared for good after 1123. Of greater interest are textual and formulaic changes in the privileges, which were introduced most likely through papal initiatives. Some of them clearly reflect imperial usages. Certain historians suggest a linkage with the lively interest in the Donation of Constantine displayed by the popes since Leo IX, but the evidence is too ambiguous to be certain. 35 Leo IX and his advisers, including Humbert of Silva Candida, introduced the rota into the eschatocol, the last lines of a privilege following upon the body of the text. The rota, a double circle surrounding a cross and with an inscription specific to each pope, replaced a simple cross. One other notable change is the transformation of the old Bene valete of the popes into a monogram. 36 The gradual, overall evolution of the chancery brought with it, intentionally or not, a differentiation and separation from local Roman institutions. Thus it fits in well with the evolution of the papacy from a locally dominated institution to an international one. The chancellor, dating back to the early eleventh century at least, thus finds his place with ease in the papal curia developing since the pontificate of Urban II (1088- 99), like the camera and the capella papalis in analogy to the courts of the European monarchies. 37 The financial administration and the lands of St Peter Particularly significant for the history of the papacy was the creation of the camera under Pope Urban II. Apart from the cardinal bishops, many members of the Roman clergy (the old ‘iudici de clero’) had deserted the cause of Gregory VII in 1084 and transferred their allegiance to the antipope Clement III and Emperor Henry IV. Both the chancellor and the archidiaconus had been among 35 This is often assumed, but such assumptions are contradicted by the fact that the German imperial chancery influenced the papal chancery certainly from the pontificate of John XIII (965-72) and into the reign of Pope Stephen IX. By the end of the eleventh century, by contrast, the influence was flowing in the opposite direction. See Bresslau (1918), especially pp. 27-37. 36 Santifaller (1973), pp. 29-38. Frenz (1986), pp. 15-22, provides an excellent recent description for the evolution of letters, simple and solemn privileges in this period and includes a bibliography.

Urban, therefore, could begin with a clean slate and transfer the camera, the financial institution which had proven its value at the Burgundian abbey of Cluny, to Rome without being hamstrung by ancient traditions there or consideration of the claims of the old bureaucracy. Indeed, other monasteries north of the Alps also used a camera to keep their financial affairs in order, 38 but it can hardly be doubted that Urban, formerly prior at Cluny, was influenced by the very institution which he had come to know and appreciate as a monk, especially since his first treasurer, the camerarius Peter, was also a monk from Cluny. Moreover, Cluny itself directly assisted the papacy with financial trans- actions in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, so much so that the Historia Compostellana referred to Cluny as camera et asseda of the pope at the time of Calixtus II. 39 Peter continued as treasurer under Paschal II (1099-1118). Calixtus II, the former Archbishop Guy of Vienne, once again installed a monk from Cluny, Stephen of Besangon, as camerarius. Only after his pontificate did the financial ties between the papacy and Cluny begin to weaken. Records for the activities of the camera in the beginning of its history are very scanty. The financial situation of the papacy in this period was very precarious, as the many papal appeals for assistance to English, French and German ec- clesiastics demonstrate. Ordinarily, the chief expenses of the pontiffs were the presbyteria, gifts to the Romans due on many different ceremonial occasions, and the maintenance and embellishment of the churches and monasteries of Rome, including the Lateran palace and St Peter’s basilica. The clergy of Rome, particularly if they were foreigners or members of the bureaucracy, also depended to some extent on the papacy for financial support. The reform papacy, however, was in addition not only involved in a struggle, armed or otherwise, with the Roman noble opposition but was also trying to reconquer the papal states, having to fend off the Normans in the process. Expenses cer- tainly rose, therefore. The papal income was originally derived primarily from the ‘lands of St Peter’, the huge estates, villages and towns of the patrimony found throughout the western half of the former Roman empire, but especially in southern Italy and Africa. Once, at the end of the sixth century, this income readily sufficed to provide for the entire city of Rome. By the eleventh century, when the camera was created, matters had changed dramatically. Again and again the popes had tried to prevent the appropriation of church lands by the great Roman families, but to no avail. The nobles took advantage of long-term leases, customarily granted for the term of three lives, which they exacted from popes, bishops or abbots in return for a small recognition fee, the pensio or census. At the synod of 877 at Ravenna Pope John VIII jointly with Emperor Charles the Bald (840-77) very tellingly prohibited not only alienations by 38 Sydow (1954/5), p. 43 n. 161. 39 Ibid ., p. 57 n. 249. Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 22 UTA-RENATE BLUMENTHAL the papacy but also requests for the alienation of the patrimony or of any of the fiscal rights of the Roman church. Such income was to go directly to the Lateran palace, nor were any monasteries, manors or estates to be given out as benefices. Both of these conciliar canons contained significant exceptions: familiars of the popes and persons to whom such grants were owed for their special service to holy Roman church. 40 The arenga of the privilege of Otto III (983-1002) of 1001 granting Pope Sylvester II (999-1003) eight counties in the Pentapolis, severely criticized the territorial policies of the papacy: ‘we are wit- ness to the fact that the Roman church is the mother of all churches, but the carelessness and ignorance of the popes has long obscured the monuments of her greatness. For not only did they sell and alienate . . . things outside the City, but also . . . what they held in this our royal City.’ The arenga eventually lists the Donation of Constantine as one of the fabrications of the papacy under the name of the great Constantine in order to make up for losses by appropri- ating what belonged to the emperor. 41 In the rest of Italy similar conditions prevailed; Otto III decreed in 998 that leases were to be valid only during the lifetime of the lessor, since the ecclesiastical institutions should not be made to suffer through alienations based on greed and personal ties. 42 Such and sim- ilar leases together with outright grants transformed, for instance, the Sabina north of Rome into a Crescentian power base. 43 Improvements were very slow to come, the great Donation of Emperor Henry II to the Roman church of 1020 notwithstanding. 44 Two privileges of Nicholas II (1059-61) for Rocca An- tica and Montasola, established collective communities under the protection of the pope in return for a yearly census, provisions ( fodrum ), and subjection to papal jurisdiction. The inhabitants of Rocca Antica were also obliged to rebuild the fort ( castellum ). 45 Documents from the reign of Paschal II, which were excerpted in the camera around the middle of the twelfth century from his register, and eventually made their way into the Liber Censuum, show similar features in grants in the patrimony. 46 With the aid of the Normans Paschal 40 Mansi 17, pp. 335ff, cc. 15 and 17; Jordan (1932), p. 31. 41 Otto III, Die Urkunden, no. 389, pp. 818—20, at p. 820: ‘Romanam ecclesiam matrem omnium ecclesiarum esse testamur, sed incuria et inscientia pontificum longe sue claritatis titulos obfuscasse.

Its inhabitants had to swear fealty to St Peter and the Lord Pope Paschal as well as to his rightful successors; they had to render military service, owed suit at the papal court, and aid {servitutem) . What is new is the reliance on feudal ties with what has been described as collective seigneuries as a means to maintain papal sovereignty. The slender evidence for Nicholas and his successors shows how slowly papal authority expanded again. The pontiffs apparently governed the patrimony di- rectly from the Lateran without the old rectors as intermediaries. The evidence for the evolution of the camera is so fragmentary that definite conclusions are hard to reach, but perhaps it can be said that the early twelfth century showed clearly a turning away from the old models for the government of papal states which still dominated under Alexander II and Gregory VII (1073-85). When Count Raymond William of Urgel had granted St Peter two forts ( castelli ) in the time of Alexander II, taking them back for himself and for his heirs in return for an annual census payment ipensio), the census was to be collected by Abbot Frotard of St-Pons-de-Thomieres, who is described as actionarius, the old title of the collectors of rents and other payments in the Patrimony. 47 At the time of Paschal II the old titles have almost entirely disappeared, and new ones linked to the chamber are bewildering in their variety, from a serviens domni Petri camerarii to dapifer (steward), familiaris and thesaurarius A 8 The variations are a typical sign of evolution and growth and just what one would expect. Under Adrian IV (1154-9) the camerarius Boso was exclusively responsible for the Patrimony of St Peter. By then the papal treasury had evolved into a much better defined institution, despite ups and downs such as papal schism and the Roman revolt of the 1140s. But even then its activities left much to be desired, at least in the eyes of Cencius Savelli, treasurer and later pope as Honorius III. He compiled the Liber Censuum, as he explained in the preface, to make sure that the financial rights of the papacy throughout western Christendom would be adequately recorded and preserved forever. Besides income from counties, principalities and kingdoms that were under the protection and/or lordship of St Peter as fiefs, or from customary gifts such as Peter s Pence from England, the Liber Censuum noted the names of numerous monasteries and churches which owed an annual census. For the late twelfth century it has been calculated that the income from secular sources amounted to four times as much as the income from protected or exempt churches. 49 The collection of these fees was one of the primary duties of the treasury, the other being the administration of the Patrimony. No wonder, then, that its agents were intensely disliked as far back 47 Deusdedit, Kanonessammlung, m. 271. 48 Sydow (1954/5), p. 56. 49 Robinson (1990), pp. 281-3; Pfaff (1953), p. 114.

The first satire on papal greed and Roman avarice, the Tractatus Garsiae Tholetani canonici de Albino et Rufino, was composed during the pontificate of Urban II. 50 LEGATES AND COUNCILS Legates From a very early period the popes were more than just bishops of Rome. Their position of leadership in the rest of Christendom, with regard to jurisdiction going back to the council of Sardica (343) which allowed deposed bishops and other clergy to appeal to the Roman see, 51 brought with it the frequent use of emissaries or legates as papal representatives, for instance at ecumenical councils. They were also used for political negotiations as in the case of the Lombard or Frankish kings. The sources usually describe them as missi or missi apostolicae sedis, but also as legati. The last term is the usual one used in the register of Gregory VII. During the reform period missions of legates intensified greatly. For the Iberian peninsula, for example, practically all of the papal business was entrusted to emissaries who enjoyed papal confidence. With the important exception of Archbishop Diego Gelmirez of Santiago de Compostela, all of them came either from Rome or from southern France, not excluding Archbishop Bernard of Toledo, the former abbot of St Victor of Marseilles. The local councils held by these legates in ‘Spain’ were essential to the reform and constitute the primary measure for papal influence in peninsula affairs. 52 By the time of Gregory VII, who was a legate to France and Germany himself on several occasions before his election to the papacy, what might be called a regular system of representatives and legates to enforce papal decrees and claims functioned relatively smoothly. In an interesting letter of April 1075 to King Sven of Denmark Gregory contrasted the conditions of the early church with the present. The pope explained that it had been the custom among his predecessors to teach all nations through legates, to correct all kings and princes and to invite all to eternal life, for, Gregory wrote, the law of the earth used to be in the hands of the popes rather than of the emperors. Now, however, the kings and magnates ( presides ) of the land had become so contemptuous of the ecclesiastical laws that hardly any legates were being sent out, because they achieved no results; papal words were now only directed in prayer to the Lord of kings and the God of punishment. But because he, Gregory, knew the 50 MGH Libelli, n, pp. 423-35; Robinson (1990), pp. 244-91. 51 Hess (1958), pp. i2iff for canons 4 and 7; see pp. i26ff for the appeals of presbyters or deacons. 52 Garcia y Garcia (1989), pp. 251-3. Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008 The papacy, 1024— 1122 ^5 king from the time of his archdiaconate and was aware of his reverence for the mother of all churches, he was none the less sending this letter through legates (; nuntios ), expecting a royal reply and Danish nuntios in return. 53 Gregory must have tried to flatter the Danish king, for legates were his favoured way of communication and often highly esteemed collaborators. Several months earlier the pope had confirmed in a letter the interdict which his legate, Bishop Gerald of Ostia, had pronounced upon Bishop Isembert of Poitiers. 54 Other legates adjudicated ecclesiastical cases, including disputed elections. 55 They might supervise new elections, 56 hold councils in the name of the pope 57 and excommunicate kings. 58 One of the clauses of the dictatus papae (c. 4) stipulates that papal legates, even if of inferior rank, would preside over bishops at councils and could depose them, clearly transferring papal prerogatives to the legate. 59 A letter of accreditation for the legates Gepizo and Maurus of January 1075 further details the authority Gregory vested in his representatives who were sent, Gregory explained, because it was impossible for him to be personally present as would be necessary if the church were to be reformed; 60 the same letter requested in addition to obedience and moral support the maintenance of the legates. This right to hospitality, later known as procuratio, was also included in the new oath of obedience demanded of archbishops and gave rise to complaints almost immediately. Bishop Ivo of Chartres implied in a letter to Paschal II that the pontiff even used legations as a pretext to provide for his clergy. 61 In 1179 the Third Lateran Council saw itself obliged to declare that the entourage of a visiting cardinal was not to exceed twenty-five persons at most. 62 Gregory VII himself, however, strictly supervised the legates through detailed instructions and, if necessary, by means of additional legates, making sure they returned in timely fashion to give account of their doings. 63 There never was any question about their subordination to the pope. On at least three occasions Gregory VII quashed major legatine decisions. In addition to these legates, some dispatched from Rome, others dignitaries from the regions concerned, Gregory VII also used permanent papal represen- tatives, the so-called standing legates.

An exceptional case was Sicily. Under Urban II Roger of Sicily and his heir obtained a privilege permitting them to control the access and activ- ities of papal legates, even to exercise legatine powers in accordance with the instructions of papal vicars sent from Rome. 4 Papal control over the church was immensely strengthened by all of these steps. The pope in fact was able to act as the universal ordinary of the church. 65 A similar intention to centralize the control of the church probably lies behind measures to restore, as Gregory and Urban believed, the ancient primatial-patriarchal dignity as described by Pseudo-Isidore. In 1079 Gregory granted the rank of primate to Archbishop Gebuin of Lyons, the prima sedes of the ancient province Lugdunensis I. The archbishops of Rouen, Tours and Sens were subjected to him. 66 Under Urban II the archbishops of Narbonne, Bourges and Toledo were confirmed in this supposedly ancient dignity and under Calixtus II the archbishop of Vienne. If the new, quasi-patriarchal rank in the ecclesiastical hierarchy had been bet- ter defined in the canonical source, it could have aided centralization under the pope even further, especially in connection with the office of legate, as witnessed by the career of Hugh of Lyons, Gebuin’s successor. Councils In the eleventh century, next to the systematic use of different types of legates, papal councils or synods were probably the most important instrument for the centralized governing of Latin Christendom 67 It even has been argued that under Pope Leo IX crucial innovations created ‘an assembly attended by bishops from outside the Roman ecclesiastical province and from outside the imperial territories, an assembly under the sole presidency of the pope, the decrees of which were regarded as binding on the whole of Latin Christendom’. 68 But is it correct to speak of innovations rather than transformation of the customary papal synods in the course of the reform? It is difficult to speak of radical departures when there is so much continuity. Leo certainly never intended to innovate, either at the synod of Mainz which he celebrated in October 1049 jointly with Emperor Henry III or at the synod of Rheims, held 64 The clearest formulation of the Sicilian privilege is that of Paschal II, JL 6562. 65 Ryan (1966). 66 The sees were the capitals of the old provinces Lugdunensis II, III and IV. 67 Contemporary sources use concilium and synodus as synonyms, a practice followed here; Somerville (1989), p. 34 n. 2.

In a later letter (JL 4185) to all French Christians, bishops and laymen alike ( fratribus et filiis catholicis per universum regnum Francorum ), the pontiff declared that the canons from Rheims, which he had ordered to be phrased as canons and which he had confirmed at his other councils, should be kept in the same manner as those of the ancient ecumenical councils to which they were appended. 9 The near-contemporary Vita Leonis tells us that Leo had insisted all along that the ‘catholic law’ should be observed. At his very first council (Rome, April 1049) the pontiff confirmed aloud the statutes of the first four ecumenical councils and the decrees of all his predecessors. 70 This declaration is reminiscent of the Liber diurnus formula for the profession of faith at a papal consecration, 71 and Leo had just been consecrated in February, but the profession also recalls age-old procedures at ecclesiastical councils. One very visible focus at many a working session was a canonical collection, solemnly displayed in the midst of the assembly. This was also the procedure at Rheims as the ‘Historia dedicationis’ confirms. 72 Nobody has ever argued that the pope could celebrate councils only in Rome or only in the empire. 73 The apparent innovation at the council of Rheims was due to force of circumstance: the French king and his advisers were unwilling to have French clergy subjected to the kind of papal reform legislation which already had created havoc in April 1049 at Rome 74 and refused to collaborate. Leo decided to proceed on his own, thus revealing the increased self-confidence of the foreign successors of the Tusculan popes as well as their urgent concern for the reform of clerical morals. A comparison of the thematically connected synods of Pavia of August 1022, held jointly by Pope Benedict VTII and Emperor Henry II, and of Leo’s three councils of 1049 reflects continuity of papal synodal traditions as well as change. The overriding concern at both was simony and married clergy, accompanied at Pavia by a theme familiar from the tenth century - lamen- tations over the poverty of the once richly endowed church - and at Rheims 69 PL 143, cols. 616 ff; ‘[at Rheims] plurima ad utilitatem Christianae religionis necessaria . . . statuendo confirmavimus: quae omni capitulis digesta inter canones haberi praecepimus, et . . . in omnibus synodis quas habuimus, idipsum confirmare curavimus’. 70 For the Vita Leonis see BHL no. 481.

At Pavia the pope declared the decrees of the synod universally valid and confirmed them forever as applying to all of the earth. 75 Henry II, a ruler anointed and crowned by the pope, also confirmed and approved the decisions as a loyal son, declaring them immutable public law ( publica iurd) 7 6 Several canons in both the papal and the royal version concerned indices and tabelliones . 77 At least in theory, therefore, the imperial confirmation should have had a practical effect. But neither papal nor imperial confirmation seem to have been effective, as Leo’s legislation of 1049 goes to show. The lack of approval by the French king Henry I at Rheims, therefore, cannot have distressed Leo to any notable extent, especially given the division of the secular sovereignty between king and princes in France. The princes were not powerful enough to maintain their customary rights over and against the reformed papacy and King Henry could decide upon neutrality quite readily, since only theoretical rights were threatened. 78 Pope Leo IX, as we have seen, did not hesitate to order the addition of his synodal decrees to the canons of the old ecumenical councils in terms recalling thematically the announcement of Benedict VIII at Pavia. 79 He had arrived at Rheims fresh from the council of Mainz which he had celebrated jointly with Emperor Henry III. As in Italy and at Mainz, so at Rheims he obliged bishops who were accused of simony or nicolaitism to clear themselves by oath. Throughout his reign (1049-54), he travelled from synod to synod, consecrated churches and altars and protected abbeys and monasteries through papal privileges. The response was overwhelming. Abbot John of Fecamp praised Leo IX in the most extravagant terms, singling out for special mention the synods held north of the Alps: For who has not wondered and erupted into jubilant applause seeing the care of this pastor, unheard of in our times? He who was not content to advise the one people of his own see of the city of Rome, or only to irrigate the Italian soil with heavenly words, but who in addition perambulated and nourished the transalpine churches with synodal examination, and who . . . quickly emended and corrected . . . through ecclesiastical censure and rule. Ave, Pater papa mirabilis . . . . 8o The general enthusiasm for reform measures promulgated by the popes be- gining with Leo IX on occasions such as synods is one of the distinguishing characteristics of the papal councils of the second half of the eleventh century. 75 MGH Constitutiones, i, no. 34, pp. 70-7, at p. 75: ‘Et ut f"
