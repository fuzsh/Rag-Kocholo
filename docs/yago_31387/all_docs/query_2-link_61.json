[Ancestral Roots]\n\n---------------------\n\nAncestral Roots claims that Eustachie is an illegitimate daughter of Eustace de Boulogne. But the following post to SGM, 28 Aug 1998, by Todd A. Farmerie discounts that in favor of another line for Eustachie. I am sticking with AR until some decisive evidence arises.\n\nFrom: Todd A. Farmerie ([email protected])\n\nSubject: Re: John I of Ponthieu\n\nNewsgroups: soc.genealogy.medieval\n\nDate: 2002-06-09 12:59:30 PST\n\nTodd A. Farmerie wrote:\n\n> Beatrice of St. Pol, daughter of Anselme, Count of St. Pol, by Eustachie.\n\nAs has been pointed out, Eustachie was suggested by Charles Evans to be illegitimate daughter of Eustace, son of King Stephen. This conclusion was based on onomastics and kinship. Eustachie is specifically stated to have been a kinswoman of King Henry II, and is found in several modern sources as Eustachie of Champagne. Eustachie being the female form of Eustace, Evans argued that the only time that Eustace/Eustachie was associated with Champagne was following the marriage of King Stephen to Matilda of Boulogne, daughter of Eustace III of Boulogne. He then chose Eustace, Stephen's son (and Henry II's second cousin) to be father of Eustachie. (It is unclear why Eustace was preferable to Evans over his brother William.) That, anyway, is Evans' suggestion.\n\nThe problem with this is that I have traced back her being called Eustachie \"of Champagne\", and cannot find anything contemporary that calls her this. Where does it come from, then? (One possibility is that this somehow derived from a misunderstanding regarding the nickname of her husband, Anselme 'Campdaveine'.) If \"de Champagne\" is non-contemporary, then the primary reason for attaching her to the Champagne/Boulogne family disappears.\n\nIt is in this context that we can view the suggestion of Kathleen Thompson, (apparently again based on onomastics and kinship), that Eustachie was daughter of William Gouet (III) by his wife Mabel. This would make her, on her father's side, granddaughter of Eustachie, wife of William Gouet (II), explaining her given name, and on her mother's side, granddaughter, through an illegitimate daughter Mabel, of King Henry I, making her (half-)first cousin of King Henry II. Thus this solution accounts for both the kinship and onomastics.\n\nThe take-home message here is that Evans based his conclusion on scant evidence, at least some of which appears to have been flawed. There is an alternative that explains the existing material at least as well, and doesn't require the invention of an illegitimate child of Eustace IV of Boulogne, otherwise thought to have d.s.p.\n\ntaf\n\nEustachie married Geoffrey De MANDEVILLE 2nd Earl Of Essex,1302,3309 son of Unknown and Unknown, in 1st Husband (Divorced) 1302.,3309 Geoffrey was born in 1134 in Great Waltham, Essex, England and died on 21 October 1166 in Chester, Cheshire, England (Dsp) at age 32.\n\nEustachie next married Anselme Candavaine Comte De ST.

Another name for Alfonso was Alfonso VII \"Emperor\" King Of LEON & Castile.\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nALPHONSO VII, \"The Emperor\" (1126-1157), is a dignified and somewhat enigmatical figure. A vague tradition had always assigned the title of emperor to the soverign who held Leon as the most direct representative of the Visigothic kings, who were themselves the representatives of the Roman empire. But though given in charters, and claimed by Alphonso VI and the Battler (Alphonso I, King of Aragon), the title had been little more than a flourish of rhetoric. Alphonso VII was crowned emperor in 1135, after the death of the Battler. The weakness of Aragon enabled him to make his superiority effective. He appears to have striven for the formation of a national unity, which Spain had never possessed since the fall of the Visigoth kingdom. The elements he had to deal with could not be welded together. Alphonso was at once a patron of the Church and a protector if not a favourer of the Mohammedans, who formed a part of his subjects. His reign ended in an unsuccessful campaign against the rising power of the Almohades. Though he was not actually defeated, his death in the Pass of Muradel in the Sierra Morena, while on his way back to Toledo, occurred in circumstances which showed that no man could be what he claimed to be---\"king of the men of the two religions.\" His personal character does not stand out with the emphasis of those of Alphonso VI or the Battler. Yet he was a great king, the type and, to some extent, the victim of the confusions of his age---Christian in creed and ambition, but more than half oriental in his household.

[The Story of England]\n\nAt the time of his reign the Northmen were settled on the coast of Ireland and the coast of Gaul; they were masters of the sea; and from west and east alike they closed upon Britain. While one host from Ireland fell on the Scot kingdom north of the Firth of Forth, another from Scandinavia landed in 866 on the coast of East Anglia under Hubba and marched the next year upon York. Mercia was saved from the Norsemen by King Ethelred when he marched to Nottingham in 868, but it was only a brief respite. The Norsemen soon resumed their attacks. Ethelred was killed fighting the Norsemen who invaded the tongue of land between the Kennet and the Thames. [WBH - England]\n\nAfter the death of Ethelbald, if he were childless, the succession of Wessex was left to Ethelred, 3rd son, and to Alfred. In little more than 2 years after the decease of his father, King Ethelbald dies. Alfred is now 12 years old. The two younger brothers assert no claim to the separate sovereignty, and Ethelbert of Kent is king also of the other dominions. There is no doubt that Alfred lived with his reigning brother, as documents exist bearing both their signatures. He, as well as Ethelred, had given up the patrimonial inheritance to him who was to maintain the dignity of the family and the safety of the kingdom. Some say he died \"worn down with numberless labours\" after fighting numerous battles with the invading Danes; some say it was from a fatal wound in the battle of Merton.

Their ancestry is taken mostly from 12th century writers and old Sagas passed down through the centuries. The sagas, which probably contain some \"truths\", also contain a lot of fabulous stories about the lives of the early rulers. As the people of the period did not have writing, it is difficult to \"prove\" anything.\n\nOn the other hand, after just a few years of medieval genealogy, I can probably name all of the kings of England, from memory, starting with Edward the Confessor, which is almost a thousand year period; and that is without any concerted effort to memorize them; I could probably go back further if I tried. There is no reason to assume that the people of the 12th century were any less inaccurate in their oral tradition of keeping track of such things as the ancestry of the Scandinavian ruling families.\n\nThus I don't believe in throwing such people on the trash heap because, by circumstance, they had nothing written about them by themselves or by their contemporaries. I think that such people should be included, but with an understanding that their information is, by necessity, obtained in a different and less precise manner than other people in one's family pedigree.\n\nBy that token, you can divide them into \"historical\" figures proven by something written during their lifetime or soon after, and \"legendary\" figures, who I think probably did exist, but are only proven by sagas and oral traditions written down in the 12th century.\n\n---------------------\n\nEarl of More [Ref: Wurts p421]\n\nJarl of Hademerken [Ref: Moriarty Plantagenet p170]\n\nEynstein the Eloquent, or Noisy [Ref: Watney #740]\n\nResearch note: Eysteinn Glumra (of dubious historicity).

Louis II \"The Stammerer\" King Of FRANKS,415,1109,1444,1601,1746,3081 son of Charles II \"The Bald\" HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE and Queen Of The West Franks Ermentrude D' ORLEANS, was born on 1 November 846 in France 3081,3082 and died on 10 April 879 in Compiegne, Oise, Ile-DE-France, France 3081,3082,3083 at age 32. Another name for Louis was Louis II Le Bègue Carolingien, Roi D' AQUITAINE.\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nThere is a lot of confusion as to the order of Louis' wives; whether they were legitimate marriages; and which was the mother of his various children. For example Ancestral Roots, in line 143-16 states that Adelaide of Paris is the 3rd wife, while in line 148-16, AR states that Adelaide was the 2nd wife. I am following line 143 (3rd wife), which makes her the last wife, and obviously mother of Charles III, since he was born posthumously.\n\n(Andre Roux: Scrolls, 191.)\n\n(Stuart, Royalty for Commoners, Page 130, Line 171-38.)\n\n(Paul, Nouveau Larousse Universel.)\n\n(Rosamond, Frankish kingdom under Carolingians, Page 258.)\n\n(Andre Castelot, Histoire de La France, Tome 1, Page 387).\n\nLouis II, King de France (the Stammerer) AKA: Louis II, King d'Aquitaine. Also Known As: Louis \"Le Begue\".\n\nBorn: in Nov 846 in Compiegne, Oise, Ile-de-France, France, son of Charles II, King de France and Ermentrude d'Orleans . Married in 862: Ansgarde de Bourgogne , daughter of Hardouin, Count de Bourgogne; She was given in marriage to Louis by her brother, Odon, often confused with Odon, Count of Troyes, an older man and one of Louis' detractors (Rosamond, Frankish kingdom under Carolingians, Page 185). Note - between 867 and 879: Louis II was the King of Aquitaine from 867 to 879 and became King of France in 877, crowned at Compiegne by Hincmar, Archbishop of Rheims on 8 October. If the children and grandchildren of Charlemagne had an easy time ascending to the throne by virtue of their parentage, the same is not true for Louis. Louis had to be elected by the Greats - the nobles whose power had been growing steadily - and they conceded only after having received countships and additional powers. Moreover, Louis had to accept the tutelage of his maternal uncle, Hughes, Marquis of Neustria who also received the countship of Tours. He died 16 months later while making preparations to reprimand Bernard, Duke of Septimanie. Upon his death, nobles, looking to enhance their own power saw the kingdom partitioned between Louis III and Carloman, who were both crowned and anointed at Ferrieres in September 879 by Ansegis, Archbishop of Sens. Louis III's portion comprised Francia and Neustria, and Carloman ruled Burgundy, Aquitaine and Gothia.\n\nMarried between 868 and 869: Adelaide=Adelheid de Paris, daughter of Adalhard, Count de Paris. [Note: I have differenty ancestry for Adelaide, see notes under Adelaide]\n\nDied: on 11 Apr 879 in France at age 32 Louis II died sooner than expected after having divided his kingdom between his two sons, Louis III and Carloman. To the older son went Francia and Neustria; and to the younger went Bourgogne, Aquitaine and the Marche of Spain. This creation of two kingdoms is highly disputed because the two sons are not viewed by some as legitimate because Charles le Chauve had not officially recognized Louis marriage to Ansgarde. Louis was not favored, and on 15 October 879, Provence and Bourgogne recognize Richilde's (Charles le Chauve's widow) brother, Bozon. Moreover, Louis, son of Louis le Germanique, also lays claim to the throne of France. Thus, to make matters rather complicated there exists three kings of France at this time.\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n Ruled: 877-879.\n\nLouis married Luitgarde Of SAXONY, daughter of Ludolph Duke Of SAXONY and Oda Billung Of THURINGIA, in 1st Wife.

Leon VI \"The Wise\" Mamikonid, Emperor Of BYZANTIUM,415,505,1444,3320 son of Basileos I The Macedonian, Emperor Of BYZANTIUM and Ingerina Of CONSTANTINOPLE, was born on 1 September 866 in Constantinople, Byzantine Empire 1447,3320,3321 and died on 12 May 912 in Constantinople, Byzantine Empire 1447,3320,3321 at age 45. Another name for Leon was Leo VI The Philosopher.\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nThe question of whether Leo's father was Basil I or Michael III is, according to Todd Farmerie, unresolvable, despite what any author's give as proof, and despite who the people at the time might have thought was the father. They wouldn't have known for sure then, and we couldn't now. So, take your pick? See Todd's post to SGM, 29 May 1998, below:\n\nFrom: Todd A. Farmerie ([email protected])\n\nSubject: Re: Father of Leo VI Philosophus\n\nNewsgroups: soc.genealogy.medieval\n\nDate: 1998/05/29\n\n[email protected] wrote:\n\nThis is from Sir Ian Moncreiffe, Royal Highness, p. 59. He says that Leo VI was almost certainly NOT the child of Basil I and was much more likely the child of Michael III, the Drunkard. Odd as it may seem, I've seen that same kind of description in three other places. I've never seen a complete argument as to why that would be so, but the modern authors are all dumping Basil I in favor of Michael III. I think we have to send it back to Michael III as father of Leo VI. JAMS, Vol. VI, #77, table 12 agrees with Moncreiffe.\n\nMarlyn Lewis\n\nDoes anyone know how to resolve this dilemma?\n\nThe question can be summed up real simply. A year or so before Leo came to be, Michael married his mistress (Leo's mother) to Basil. Short of a time machine and a DNA test we will not be able to resolve the question. Whatever he might have suspected (and it has been argued that he mistreated Leo because he suspected that Leo really wasn't his son) I doubt Basil knew, (same for Michael) and perhaps even the mother didn't.

AKA: Charles II, King de Bourgogne. AKA: Charles II, King of Italy. Also Known As: Charles \"Le Chauve\".\n\nBorn: on 13 Jun 823 in Francfort-sur-le-Main, Germany, son of Louis I, King de France and Judith de Baviere , Some sources assert King Charles II was born in the year 829.\n\nNote - between 824 and 875 in France: The birth of Charles II in 823 did not at first excite jealousy or rivalry among his brothers. In 829, Charles was granted the region of Alemannia, Rhaetia and part of Burgundy. In 837, his Father Louis I \"Le Debonnaire\", by arrangement with Louis the German and Pepin gave Charles the land West of the Meuse, Burgundy, Chartres and Paris together with all the bishops, abbots and counts who held benefices in these territories. A portion of Neustria was added in 838, and upon Pepin's death, Louis Le Pieux made Charles King of Aquitaine. On 24 July 840, the new Emperor, Lothar, in Strasburg, refuses to support the land claims of Charles (from the agreement of Worms on 30 May 839). The two brothers, Louis and Charles, unite against Lothar and the War of the Three Brothers begins. Meanwhile, on 12 May 841, the Normands ravage Rouen and all the localities along the Seine, increasing their wealth considerably. At Fontenoy-en-Puisaye (24 June 841), Charles defeats his brothers Lothar (in spite of the arrival of the Army of Aquitaine in the Imperial ranks -- and at a total loss of 40,000 lives at the battle) and Louis Le Germanique. Charles and Louis signed an alliance on 14 February 842 at Strasbourg. Leaving Strasbourg, the two brothers defeat the imperial army of Lothar just West of Comblence. Lothar leaves Aix-le-Chapelle precipitously, pursued by the two brothers. In Mellecey, not far from Chalon-sur-Saone, Lothar proposes a plan to establish perpetual peace which is acceptable to both Louis and Charles. On 15 June, they sign the preliminary peace document. On 1 October 842, each of them sends 40 commissioners to Metz to forge the official document. Prudence, the Bishop of Troyes, notes that Louis regained Germania in the East, Lothar gets the middle part of the Franc Kingdom, including Italy, and Charles obtains the Western lands (West of the Rhone, including Soissons). After that Charles goes to the Palace in Quierzy, where he marries Ermentrude.\n\nCharles signed the Treaty of Verdun (843) which split the Kingdom of Charlemagne. By the Treaty, the destiny of Occidental Europe would be heavily influenced to this day. Louis obtains all lands East of the Rhine, including the cities of Spire, Worms, Mayence. Lothar gets all the lands extending between the Rhine and the Escaut, the Cambresis, the Hainaut, the country of Mezieres, and all the countships neighboring the Meuse, through the Saone and the Rhone, the Artois and Italy. Charles got all the lands East all the way to Spain. The Kingdom of Charlemagne thus was split forever, with the most serious rift between the germanic lands of Louis, and the French lands of Charles. The intervening lands extending from Frisia to Rome, from the North Sea to the Mediterranean including what would become Holland, Belgium, Lorraine and Switzerland would become a sore point of contention between these two peoples. The only thing that mattered to Lothar was the fact that both capitals (Aix and Rome) were located within his territory, thus legitimizing the title of Emperor.\n\nMeanwhile, the Normands pillage Nantes and lower Aquitaine. Charles laid siege to Toulouse in vain (May to July 844). The Normands led by Ragnar Lodbrog arrive in Paris and must be heavily bribed to leave. Other Normand armies ravage Toulouse and Bordeaux (burned to the ground in 848). On 6 May 848, Duke Nomenoe proclaims the indepence of the Church of Bretagne and the following year proclaims himself King of Bretagne. Charles fought Brittany (Bretagne) in 845-851 and was victorious. Not liking Pepin II, the people of Aquitaine request Charles' help, and he obliges by accepting the Crown, and on 6 June 848 is consecrated King of Aquitaine, though he could not defend his kingdom against the Normands. He had Charles of Aquitaine jailed (849 in Corbie). In 850 Charles attacks Bretagne and leaves a garrison in Rennes. No sooner does he leave, that Nomenoe takes the city and then takes Nantes as well. The next year, Nomenoe ravages Maine, but, fortunately for Charles, the King of Bretagne dies suddenly on 7 March in Vendome. Charles has Pepin II locked in the Monastery of Saint-Medard de Soissons in 852. The Normands under Godfrid pillage Tours and Angers and penetrate via the Valley of Escaut all the way to the Seine. The loyalty of Aquitaine shifts in 853, and Louis the German is called upon to help against Charles le Chauve. He in turn defeats Louis and offers Aquitaine his son by Ermentrude, Charles, who would be crowned sovereign in Limoges in October 855. Both Pepin II and Charles d'Aquitaine escape raise armies against Charles le Chauve. Charles fought against Louis for Lorraine (859, 870 [Treaty of Mersen] and 875).\n\nWhen Louis le Germanique becomes ill in 869 near Rastisbonne, shortly after his nephew Lothar II died, Charles see the opportunity to claim his heritage as Uncle of the deceased. He has himself annointed King of Lorraine in Metz on 9 September, by the Bishop Hincmar. In March, 867, Charles d'Aquitaine dies, and his father Charles le Chauve is recognized as King by the Assembly in Pouilly-sur-Loire. Upon the death of his nephew, Lothar II on 8 August 869, Charles sped to Lotharingia and had himself crowned King of Lotharingia annointed on 9 September in the cathedral at Metz by Bishop Adventius of Metz and Archbishop Hincmar of Rheims. In 9 August 870, through the Treaty of Meerseen, Louis \"Le Germanique\" and Charles \"Le Chauve\" reach an agreeable compromise whereby they divide the lands of Lothar II between themselves, leaving Louis II no part of the inheritance. As soon as Louis II died on 12 August 875, Charles rushed to Italy and received the imperial crown and is annointed by Pope John VIII on 25 December 875. In Pavia on 5 January 876, by acclamation of the counts and nobles of Italy, Charles becomes King of Italy. On 31 January 876, the Archbishop of Milan proclaims Charles as Emperor. The French ecclesiasticals and nobles, having some misgivings about Charles' ability to take care of his Kingdom meet in Ponthion. Charles joins them dressed in the attire of the Frankish King. As soon as they declare him elected and recognize his imperial authority, Charles donned the Byzantine crown, and purple vestment of emperor. When Louis le Germanique dies on 28 August 876, Charles claims Lorraine as his own. While on an expedition in Italy against the Sarrasins, through the specific request of Pope Jean VIII, Charles le Chauve dies at the foot of Mount Cenis.\n\nMarried on 13 Dec 842 in Quierzy-sur-Oise, Aisne, Ile-de-France, France: Ermentrude d'Orleans , daughter of Odon=Eudes, Count d'Orleans and Ingeltrude de Paris; Ermentrude was crowned Queen of France in 866, having already produced a number of children including 6 sons but none of them was satisfactory as far as Charles Le Chauve was concerned. By September 866, four of them were dead.\n\nMarried on 25 Nov 869 in Aix-la-Chapelle, France: Richilde de Bourgogne, daughter of Beuve=Bouin, Comte de Bourgogne and Richilde d'Arles; The honeymoon is short-lived, as Louis le Germanique demands, as part of his heritage from the death of his nephew Lothar II, a part of Lorraine. Died: on 6 Oct 877 in Avrieux, Dauphine, France, at age 54 Charles II is buried at Saint Denis although originally he was buried in Nantua. Before expiring, he named his son, Louis Le Begue as his successor, and the Empress Richilde, crowned by Pope Jean VIII earlier that year, is charged with taking the royal garbs and sword to her step-son.\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n Ruled: 875-877.\n\nCharles married Queen Of The West Franks Ermentrude D' ORLEANS 1601,1784,2112,3231 on 14 December 842 in Crecy, France 3135.,3231 Ermentrude was born on 27 September 830 in Orleans, Loiret, Orleanais/Centre, France,2147,3133 died on 6 October 869 in St Denis, Paris, Ile-DE-France, France 3133,3231 at age 39, and was buried in St Denis, Aude, France.

Louis I \"The Pious\" Emperor HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE Calolingian,415,505,1444,1601,1746,1784,3119,3120,3121,3122,3123,3124 son of King Of The Franks Charlemagne Emperor Of The HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE and Countess Of Vinzgau Hildegard Empress Of The HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE, was born in August 778 in Chasseneuil, Lot-Et-Garonne Near Poitiers, Aquitaine, France,1436,3120,3124 died on 20 June 840 in Petersaue, Ingelheim Am Rhein, Rhineland Palatinate, Germany 2323,3120,3124,3125 at age 61, and was buried in Aachen Cathedral, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany.3126 Other names for Louis were Louis I The Fair, Ludwig Den Fromme, Louis I De FRANCE,3120 Louis I King Of FRANCE, Louis I The Pious Of Aquitaine, King Of FRANCE,1436 Louis I, King Of The LOMBARDS, Louis I Le Pieux Carolingien, and Em;Ereur D' OCCIDENT.\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nCalled The Pious (778-840), Holy Roman emperor (814-40), king of France (814-40), king of Germany (814-40), and king of Aquitaine (781-840). He was the son of Charlemagne, king of the Franks. In 817 Louis made plans providing for the posthumous division of the Carolingian Empire among his three surviving sons, Lothair I, Holy Roman emperor, Louis II, king of Germany, and Charles II, Holy Roman emperor. His reign, however, was troubled by quarrels with his sons, who were dissatisfied with his arrangements for the succession. Louis was physically strong but was easily influenced and was unequal to administering the large empire that he inherited from his father.\n\nIn 781, at age 2, Louis I, \"Le Pieux\", was crowned and anointed King of Aquitaine by Pope Hadrian I, at the same time as his older brother Pepin was made King of Italy. Louis, whose twin brother had died at birth, was the third of Charlemagne's sons by his wife Hildegard. The Diviso Regni of 806indicates that Louis was to have Aquitaine as an independent kingdom upon his father's death. Aquitaine was in effect a March; for much of Louis' reign as sub-king he and his officials were occupied in quelling Gascon revolts and launching offensives into Spain. Unrest had never completely died out in the Pyrenees since the annexation of Aquitaine in 768, and more especially after the disastrous ambush of the Frankish vanguard in Roncesvalles in 778. In about 788, Chorso, Duke of Toulouse was captured by a Gascon named Adelric, and then released after being forced to swear an oath of allegiance to the Gascon or Basque leader. In 793, the Sarracens invaded Septimania, burned the suburbs of Narbonne and marched on Carcassonne, but in 795 Bahlul-ben-Machluc sued with Louis for peace. In 800, he successfully laid siege to Barcelona and subsequently captured Tortosa, Huesca and Pamplona and formed links with the Kingdom of the Asturias. Baptized: on 15 Apr 781; On 15 April 781, Louis was baptized by Pope Hadrian I in Rome. The next day, Easter Sunday, he was confirmed in his title of King of Aquitaine. Married in 794: Ermengarde d'Esbay, daughter of Engueran=Ingram, Count d'Esbay.\n\nNote - between 800 and 837: Louis I established monasteries in Nouaille (a cell of St. Hilaire of Poitiers), Gellone and St. Martin-de-Tours.\n\nAfter the death of his brothers Pepin and Charles in 810 and 811 respectively, Louis was crowned at Aachen on 13 September 813, Emperor and heir to all of Charlemagne's lands, by Charlemagne himself without any assistance nor even the presence of the Pope. All sources, Frankish as well as papal, refer to Louis as emperor from then on. Charlemagne died 5 months later. All of Louis' sisters were required to quit the palace and retire to their own estates. His cousins, the offsprings of Bernard (Pepin III's half brother) were exhiled: Louis forced Count Wala to become a monk at Corbie; Adalhard was exhiled to Noirmoutier to be held there in custody by the Abbot; Bernhard returned to Lerin and Gundrada had to retreat to St. Radegund's convent of Sainte Croix in Poitiers. Only Theodrada was left unmolested as abbess of Notre Dame at Soissons. Louis I was also known as Louis, \"Le Pieux\". On 27 February 814, upon learning of the death of his father, and at the age of 36 years, he left Doue-la-Fontaine, in Anjou, to go to Aix-la-Chapelle.\n\nThis new emperor, enterred this capital, and poised himself in front of the tomb of Charlemagne. So oversome with grief, his forehead touched the stone floor of the church. Hence the name \"Le Pieux\". Since he was kind, relative to his times, he was also known as \"Le Debonnaire\". For himself, he preferred to adopt the title \"by divine Providence, Emperor Augustus\". When Pope Leo died in May of 816, Stephen IV was elected Pope, and crowned Louis the Emperor on Sunday 5 October by placing a crown on his head during mass at Rheims. He also secured the release of some Roman exhiles in Francia. This crowning was among the first attempts to integrate the Papacy into the institutional framework of the Empire. Louis, 'lest he be led astray in satisfying the natural desires of the body' married Ermengarde, daughter of Count Ingramn. Charlemagne established Doue-la-Fontaine, Chasseneuil (Louis' birthplace), Angeac and Ebreuil as royal residences to maintain Louis and his household. At an assembly in Aachen in July 817, Louis made provisions for his sons' inheritance through the \"Ordinatio Imperii\". In his preface he states that the unity of the empire preserved for Louis by God should not be destroyed by men. Lothar was given the title of emperor, and as co-ruler with his father at once made heir to the empire, and appointed King of Italy in the event of his father's death. Bernard, then King of Italy was not mentioned, but the implication is that Bernard would be subordinate to Lothar should Louis die. Pepin was made King of Aquitaine (plus Gascony, Toulouse, Carcassonne, Autun, Avallon and Nevers) and Louis, The German, was made King of Bavaria (plus Carinthia, Bohemia, the lands of the Avars and Slavs and the royal manors of Lauterhofen and Ingolstadt). Pepin and Louis were to meet on an annual basis with Lothar to consult and together find \"measures to take in the interest of perpetual peace\". They could neither start a war nor marry without the approval of their elder brother. Lothar even had the right to de-throne them after three warnings. That same year, 817, Stephen IV obtains his political independence, thus severing the tie between Rome and the Frank Empire as conceived by Charlemagne. The arrangement was neat and all contingencies covered except for the one which took place. After his first wife's (Ermengarde) death, Louis, in 819, married the beautiful Bavarian Judith, daughter of Comte Welf of Bavaria. On 13 June 823 she gave birth to a son. He was called Charles. In September, 824, forgetting his nickname \"Le Debonnaire\", Louis totally ravages the Bretagne which was rebelling. In 829, at the General Assembly convoked in Worms (Wurm), Louis announces that he is forging a Duchy for his son, Charles, and gives him Alamania, Alsace, Rhetia, and part of Burgundy. The Co-Emperor Lothar, disagrees and has his name removed from imperial decrees and diplomas. Toward the end of 829, the political scene gets very complicated with allegations that Judith had intimate rapports with Bernard, Count of Barcelone, and ultimately desiring the death of the three sons of Hirmingarde. In Mai of 830, in Compiegne, Lothar and Pepin of Aquitaine lead a revolt. Louis is forced to cede on every point of contention. The apanage of the young Charles is eliminated, Judith is locked up in Poitiers at the Monastery of Sainte-Radegonde. In 831, the bishops would note how she had a talent for converting men's hearts and souls, and would allow her to rejoin her husband. In 832, Pepin and Louis revolt against their father. On 24 June 833, the Army of Louis Le Pieux faces those of the rebels. The field of battle in Rothfeld would be named the Field of the Lie (Lugenfeld). The Emperor and his sons begin negotiations. The night of 29 to 30 June, it is clear that the supporters of Louis would be influenced by his three sons. On the morning of 30 June, Louis would have to surrender. It would not be until 1 October that Louis would be deposed by the Assembly led by Agobard, Archbishop of Lyon and Eblon, Archbishop of Reims. On 7 October, Judith is sent to the Monastery of Tortone, Bernard to Prum, and Louis to the Monastery of Saint-Medard-de-Soissons, where in public ceremony, he is forced to lay down his sword, stripped of royal vestments, he is made to don the coarse cloth of a penitent. In 834, Louis and Pepin, tired of being under the control of their brother Lothar, decide to free their father. On 28 February, they succeed in freeing their father and in August in Blois, Lothar swears to Louis Le Pieux, that he would never leave Italy except by his direct command. Throughout 834, the Normands -- Danes, Swedes and Norwegians -- resume their raids. On 28 February 835, the General Assembly proclaims that Louis was innocent of all previous accusations thus clearing the way for him to be re-established as Emperor on the Throne at Saint-Stephen of Metz.\n\nIn 837, thanks to the intercessions of Judith, Charles \"Le Chauve\", receives a Kingdom composed of Frisia, between the Seine, the Meuse and the sea and in September 838, he receives the crown at Quierzy-sur-Oise. In 838, Marseille is devastated by the Sarrasins. On 30 May 839, the Empire is divided in half, with Lothar taking the East, and Charles' lands extend through Provence, Lyon, Toul and Geneva and all the lands of the West. Louis \"the German\", gets to keep only Bavaria. Married in 819: Judith de Baviere (3628), daughter of Welf II, Count de Baviere and Egilwich=Heilwig, Abbess de Challes ; Louis married Judith upon the death of his first wife, Ermengarde. She bore him a son named Charles in 823. It is clear that Louis was as fond of Charles as Jacob was of his Benjamin. Died: on 22 Jun 840 in Ingelheim, Germany, at age 61 In 840, while attempting to keep Louis \"the German\" in line, Louis \"Le Pieux\" is taken ill in Salz. Feeling near death, he sends Lothar his sword and the crown on the condition that he would be loyal to Judith and abide by the lands division agreed to in Worms in 839. He died on an island, near Ingelheim on 22 June. 309.
