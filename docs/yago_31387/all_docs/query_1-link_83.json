Son.\n\n34) Karl Von Habsburg (born 1961) Son.\n\nOf course this lineage does end up a little differently than is usually given.\n\nThis is the more usual version:\n\n1) Emperor Frederick II (1194-1250) King of Sicily, King of Jerusalem.\n\n(Henry VII, (1211-1242) King of the Romans, deposed for rebellion in 1235)\n\n(Frederick (died 1251) younger son of Henry VII, would have been heir except for his father's deposition.

Younger brother of King John I. No surviving descendants.\n\nThen the Aragonese chose the second son of Dona Leonor of Aragon, the youngest sister of John I and Martin I.\n\n(Infanta Leonor of Aragon (1358-1382). Youngest Sister of John I and Martin I. Married King John I of Castile.)\n\n12) King Henry III (1379-1406) of Castile, etc. Oldest Son.\n\n13) King John II (1405-1454) of Castile, etc. Son.\n\n14) King Henry IV (1425-1475) of Castile, etc. Older Son.\n\n15) Juana la Beltraneja (1452-1530) Only child.

King Ferrante I of Sicily 1412.\n\n13) King Alfonso V (1394-1458) of Aragon, etc. King of Sicily and Naples. Son. No legitimate children.\n\n14) King John (1396-1479) of Aragon, etc. & Sicily.

Childless.\n\nAfter which the succession becomes disputed with many possible present day claimants.\n\nIf I remember correctly, the possible heirs of King Charles II and thus of Manfred are:\n\n1) Infanta Alica (born 1917) of Spain, Princess of Bourbon-Parma, Dowger Duchess of Calabria.\n\n2) Louis Alphonse, (born 1974) Duke of Anjou.

Hermann may have married the daughter of Gerhard of Mullenark and became knon as Count Hermann of Mullenark.\n\nLOWER RHINE NOBILITY\n\nAnd he seems identical with the next heir in Regnal Chronologies:\n\nHermann III (Count of Müllenark)..............1158-1172\n\nPretenders\n\n5) Hermann was succeeded by his brother Adolf of Saffenberg (died after 1176). Adolf had no known children.\n\nLOWER RHINE NOBILITY\n\nThis Adolf of Saffenberg may be identical with the next heir in Regnal Chronologies:\n\nAdolf IV......................................1172-1186\n\nPretenders\n\nThe next heir in the Regnal chronologies list is:\n\nAdalbert II...................................1186-1211\n\nfollowed by:\n\nHermann IV....................................1211-1248\n\nAnd by:\n\nAdelheid II (fem.).............................1248-1267\n\nPretenders\n\nThe Adelbert II in this list might be identical with Count Adalbert III of Norvenich (died 1177) in Medieval Lands.\n\nLOWER RHINE NOBILITY\n\nThis Adalbert's wife was Adelheid von Vianden, and their daughter was Alveradis (died 1216/45) who married first Count Wilhelm II \"the Great\" of Julich and second Otto II Lord of Wickrath and had several gnerations of descendants and might possibly be the Adelheid II of the Regnal Chronologies list.\n\nLOWER RHINE NOBILITY\n\nNumber 4 and number 5, the brothers Hermann and Adolf of Saffenberg, had a sister Matilde von Saffenberg (died 1145/46) who married in 1145 Henry Count of Limburg.\n\nLOWER RHINE NOBILITY\n\nHenry Count of Limburg was Henry II, Duke of Limburg (died 1167).\n\nLIMBURG\n\nHis son was Henry III, Duke of Limburg (died 1221).\n\nLIMBURG\n\nThe oldest son of Duke Henry III was Henry of Limburg, died 1214. married but apparently childless.\n\nDuke Henry III was succeeded by his next oldest son, Duke Waleran III of Limburg.\n\nLIMBURG\n\nDuke Waleran III of Limburg (died 1226) married as his second wife Ermensende of Namur, Countess of Luxemburg, The older son of this marriage became Count of Luxemburg.\n\nLIMBURG\n\nCount Henry V \"The Blond\" of Luxemburg (1216/17-1281), was the son of Duke Waleran III of Limburg (died 1226).\n\nHis older son was Count Henry VI of Luxemburg (1250?-1288).\n\nLUXEMBOURG\n\nCount Henry VI of Luxemburg's oldest son was Count Henry VII, King of the Romans Henry IX. and Emperor Henry VII 1274-1313).\n\nLUXEMBOURG\n\nAnd the descent of the Hohenzollerns from Emperors Henry VII, Charles IV, and Sigismund through various marriages is well established. As is the curious fact that for almost five hundred years there was no moment when the Hohenzollern heir by male preference primogeniture - the inheritance method by which the Hohenzollerns became the heirs of the Luxemburg Emperors - was a different person from the heir by male only or agnatic primogeniture, the usual inheritance method in German dynasties.\n\nCrown Prince Wilhelm (1882-1951), son of Kaiser Wilhelm II, died in 1951 and was succeeded as pretender or claimant to the Prussian and German thrones by his oldest surviving son, Louis Ferdinand (1907-1994) whose two older sons renounced their rights of succession after making unequal marriages.
