        "text": "E\n\nâEâÂ Â Â Â see Â Â Â Â Fullerton, Mary Eliza\n\nEadburga (Eadburh) â (c770 â c830)Â\n\nAnglo-Saxon queen\n\nEadburga was the eldest daughter of Offa II, King of Mercia, and his wife Cynethryth, and was married (787) to King Beorhtric of Wessex, who had sent an embassy to her fatherâs court to solicit her hand. The marriage remained childless. Queen Eadburgaâs unsavoury career was recorded by Asser, Bishop of Sherborne, in his Life of Alfred whom the writer stated told him the story himself. An entirely unscrupulous woman, King Beorhtric allowed Eadburga to exercise too much power. Jealous of his favoured friends, she falsley accused them that the king might have them put to death. If her accusations were disregarded, Eadburga removed them with poison. Furious at Beorhtricâs attachment to a young earldorman named Worr, the queen poisoned him but accidentally poisoned her husband as well (802).\n\nWith Beorhtricâs death, his nobles rose against Eadburga, who gathered her treasure, and fled to the court of Charlemagne. Offerred the choice of marriage with the emperor or his son Charles (772 â 811), Eadburga tactlessly chose the younger on the grounds of his youth. Affronted, the emperor denied her a royal husband, but appointed the queen to rule over the convent of Ober Altaich in Bavaria where she became a nun taking the name of Salome. However, her behaviour there proved so disgraceful that Eadburga was ejected from the convent, and forced to travel with only one maid-servant to Pavia, in Italy, where she was seen begging for food in the streets before her death.\n\nEadburga of Repton â (c660 â after 714)\n\nAnglo-Saxon virgin saint\n\nEadburga was the eldest daughter of Aldwulf, King of East-Anglia (664 â 713), and sister to King Alfwold (713 â 749) and to Ethelburga of Hackness. Eadburga was appointed as abbess of Repton in Derbyshire, and was venerated as a saint. Eadburga was mentioned in On the Resting Places of the Saints (1889) as being interred at Southwell-on-Trent. She is the same as the abbess of Repton mentioned by Felix in his Vitae of St Guthlac, who sent the saint a leaded coffin and a shroud when he was close to death (714). Her feast date is now lost.\n\nEadburhÂ Â Â Â see alsoÂ Â Â Â EadburgaÂ orÂ Â Edburga\n\nEadburh of Mercia (Eadburga) â (c830 â c890)\n\nAnglo-Saxon princess\n\nPrincess Eadburh was perhaps the daughter of King Wigmund and his wife Aelfflaed, the daughter of Coelwulf I, though King Coenwulf has also been suggested. A surviving charter concerning her son Aethelwulf and the Abbey of Winchcombe which described Eadburh as de regali genere Merciorum Regis indicates a close relationship with the family of King Coenwulf and his brother King Ceolwulf of Mercia, who had owned the abbey which was protected by papal privilege.\n\nEadburh was married to the powerful nobleman, Aethelred Mucil, ealrdorman of the Gainas, and their children included Aethelwulf (c848 â 901), Earl and governor of Mercia and Eahlswith, the wife of King Alfred of Wessex. Eadburh is the link between the British royal house and the ancient kingdom of the Mercians. Queen Ecgwynn, the first wife of Edward the Elder (899 â 924) and mother of King Athelstan (924 â 939), was probably her granddaughter.\n\nWith the death of her husband (873) and the subsequent invasion of the kingdom by the Danes, the princess fled with her household for protection at the court of her son-in-law in Wessex, where she resided until her death some years afterwards, and assisted with the education of her grandchildren. Alfredâs mentor, the historian Asser the famous Bishop of Sherborne, recorded that the king admired his mother-in-law, whom Asser had met at the West-Saxon court, describing her as âa notable woman, who remained for many years after the death of her husband a chaste widow, until her deathâ and this brief mention would seem to indicate her as a lady of some considerable character.\n\nEaden, Robin â (1943 â 2001)Â\n\nAnglo-Australian editor\n\nPhilippa Robin Eaden was born in Driffield, Yorkshire, and emigrated to Australia withn her family (1947). Educated at the Walford Anglican School for Girls in South Australia, she graduated with honours from Adelaide University (1965) and became a teacher in Paris (1968). Robin co-edited several books including The Annotated Such is Life and Warrabarna Kaurna: Reclaiming an Australian Language shortly before her death. An artist of some note, she specialized in landscapes. Robin Eaden died in a car crash with her partner, at Port Vincent, South Australia.\n\nEadflaedÂ Â Â Â seeÂ Â Â Edfleda\n\nEadgifu (Edgiva) â (c899 â 968)\n\nAnglo-Saxon queen consort\n\nEadgifu was the daughter of Sighelm, Earl of Kent who died at the battle of Holme (905), though her motherâs identity remains unrecorded. Eadgifu became the third wife (916) of King Edward the Elder (871 â 924) to whom she bore two sons, Edmund I (921 â 946) who succeeded his elder half-brother Athelstan as king (939), and Edred (923 â 955) who succeeded his brother due to the infancy of his nephews. Her daughters included Edburga (918 â 960) the Abbess of Winchester, and Elgiva (920 â 963) who became the the first wife of Conrad I (926 â 993), King of Burgundy (937 â 993) and took the German name of Adelaide at the time of her marriage.\n\nThe youthful Queen Dowager Eadgifu appears to have remarried several years after King Edwardâs death perhaps (c927). The identity of this nobleman remains unknown, but Eadgifu bore this man five children, four sons and a daughter including Aelfhere (c928 â 983) the Duke of Mercians (956), father of Aelfric (c953 â 1016) Earl of Mercia, and Aelfheah (c930 â 972) who was created Earl of Hampshire (957) and left descendants.\n\nA firm supporter of the monastic reform instigated by Archbishop Dunstan of Canterbury, during the reign of her two sons, Queen Eadgifu became a woman of great power and was one of the most closely consulted of royal counsellors. It was due to her influence that her son Edred perusaded Ethelwold to remain in England and appointed him as abbot of Abingdon. However, with the accession of her elder grandson Edwy (955 â 959) Queen Eadgifu fell from power and was banished from the court, her estates being confiscated.\n\nWith the accession of her grandson Edgar I the queen dowager was reinstated at court and her estates returned, though she never recovered her former political pre-eminence. Prior to her death she retired from court to reside in a convent, though she was present at court to attend the celebrations surrounding the birth of her great-grandson Edmund of Romsey (966). Queen Eadgifu died (Aug 25, 968) and was interred in Canterbury Cathedral in Kent.\n\nEadgifu of EnglandÂ Â Â Â seeÂ Â Ogiva of England\n\nEadgyth Â Â Â Â see alsoÂ Â Â Edith\n\nEadhildÂ Â Â seeÂ Â Â Edhilda\n\nEadwara â (fl. c700)\n\nAnglo-Saxon virgin saint\n\nEadwara was born at Exeter, in Devonshire, and was sister to Paul, Bishop of Leon in Brittany. She became a nun or religious recluse in England and was sister to three other female saints, Juthwara, Sidwell, and Wulvella (Wilgith).\n\nEady, Dorothy â (1904 â 1981)\n\nBritish Egyptologist\n\nEady was born in London. After a childhood accident sufferred at an early age (1907) she mystically identified herself with ancient Egypt and its culture, and firmly believed that the city of Abydos had been her home in previous incarnation, where she believed that she had been a minor royal. She has been recorded as one of the most believable examples of reincarnation known in the modern era. Eady travelled to Egypt in 1935 where she married an Egyptian and took the name of Omm Sety. After her marriage ended in divorce, she joined the Department of Antiquities in Cairo, as a draftsperson. She worked alongside Selim Hassan, the noted archaeologist, for whom Eady created indexes and provided drawings for three volumes of work concerning his excavations at Giza. She then worked with Ahmed Fakhry as his assistant at Dashur, and worked in tomb restoration. Dorothy Eady began a study of Egyptian hieroglyphics at the Temple of Isis, becoming a respected international specialist on the subject. Settling permanently in Cairo, she was officially appointed Keeper of the Temple by the Egyptian government (1956).\n\nEady, Jane Sarah â (1847 â 1938)\n\nAustralian civic leader\n\nBorn Jane Williams in Tasmania, she trained as a maker of Honiton lace and became the wife of George Eady. She was mother to the famous Liberal politician, lawyer, and sportsman, Charles John Eady (1870 â 1945). Mrs Eady was a prominent activist for the war effort during WW I, and assisted with the establishment of the Royal Hobart Hospital Womenâs Auxiliary. She was also active with the Hobart Relief Centre, the Benevolent Society and with the care and education of poor children. Jane Eady died in Hobart, aged ninety (March 29, 1938).\n\nEafa â (fl. c670 â c675)\n\nAnglo-Saxon queen\n\nEafa was the daughter of Eanfrith, King of the Hwicce tribe in Mercia, and the niece of King Eanhere. Her father and uncle were probably dependent rulers under the overlordship of Wulfhere, King of Mercia. Her marriage with Ethelweah, King of the South Saxons (Sussex), was probably celebrated at the Mercian court (c673). At the same time Ethelwealh also received Christian baptism in the prescence of King Wulfhere and his court, this being presumably a condition of the marriage, which had been negotiated for important political and dynastic reasons. Oshere, who is recorded as king of the Hwicce (693) was related to Queen Eafa, though he was probably not her son.\n\nEafa of Kent (Ermenburga) â (c644 â c693)\n\nAnglo-Saxon queen\n\nSometimes called Domna or Aebbe, she was the daughter of Eormenraed, King of Kent (640 â c656) and his wife Oslafa, the daughter of Anna, King of East-Anglia. She was married to Merewald (c634 â c680), king of the Magonsaete tribe, in Herefordshire, a younger son of Penda, king of Mercia, to whom she bore a son, Merefin, who died young, and three daughters.\n\nEafaâs two brothers, Aethelbrith and Aethelred were murdered at Eastry in Northumbria, during a dynastic struggle in Kent (670). The crime had been committed by the kingâs counsellor Thunor. As a means of healing this quarrel, King Egbert (670 â 673) acknowledged his guilt publicly, ordered the princes to be royally interred in the church of Wakering, and made further amends by granting as a wergild (blood-price) to Queen Eafa a large tract of land on the island of Thanet in Kent, where she founded the abbey of Minster dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\n\nEafa later retired there and became a nun herself. Living in 691, she had died by 694, and was venerated as a saint (Nov 19). Her three daughters all became nuns, Mildrith, Abbess of Minster-in-Thanet, Mildburga, Abbess of Wenlock, and Mildgyth, who lived as a religious recluse.\n\nEagar, Margaretta Alexandra â (1863 â 1936)\n\nIrish royal governess\n\nMargaretta Eagar was born (Aug 12, 1863) in Limerick into a Protestant family. She was trained as a nurse in Belfast and later worked as the matron of an orphanage. She was appointed to serve as governess (1898 â 1904) to the four daughters of the Russian Tsar Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, from whom they learned to speak English with a distinct Irish accent which later had to be corrected by their tutor Sydney Gibbs. Margaretta left the Imperial service in 1904 and received an Imperial pension. She published the memoir Six Years at the Russian Court (1906) and continued to work as a governess. She later ran a boarding house and died in penury.\n\nEagels, Jeanne â (1894 â 1929)\n\nAmerican stage and film actress\n\nJeanne Eagels became one of the most famous leading ladies of the 1920âs flapper era. She was born Amelia Jeannine Eagles (June 26, 1894) in Kansas City, Missouri, and made her stage debut at the age of seven. She grew into a celebrated blonde beauty, making a name for herself on the Broadway stage in the role of Sadie Thompson in, Rain, the play written by John Colton, being adapted from a short story by W. Somerset Maugham, and which role she played for two years (1922 â 1924). By this time she had adopted the âEagelsâ spelling of her name, reputedly because she thought it looked better in lights.\n\nEagels was married firstly to Morris Dubinsky, head of a travelling theatre show, to whom she bore a son, and secondly (1925 â 1928) to Ted Coy, a noted university football star, from whom she was later divorced. They had no children. Her private life was surrounded by intense publicity and media coverage. Jeanne Eagels died aged thirty-six (Oct 3, 1929), from an overdose of heroin. Eagels was rather negatively portrayed by Kim Novak in, Jeanne Eagels (1957), which screenplay had been based on the scandalous book by Eddie Doherty, The Rain Girl: The tragic story of Jeanne Eagels (1930). Her movie credits numbered in the handful and included, The World and the Woman (1916), Fires of Youth (1917), Under False Colors (1917), The Cross Bearer (1918), Daddies (1918), Man, Woman and Sin (1927), The Letter (1929) and, Jealousy (1929).\n\nEager, Mary Jane â (1859 â 1944)\n\nAmerican novelist\n\nMary Jane Whitfield was born (Aug 30, 1859) in Aberdeen, Mississippi, the daughter of Robert Whitfield. She was educated in local secondary schools and then at Washington University in St Louis. She was married (1883) to Patrick Eager. Mrs Eager had trained as a teacher and received considerable musical instruction, so that whilst her husband was appointed as head of the Brownsville Female Academy in Tennessee, she served as director of music there. She published works under the pseudonym âDavid Patrick MacMillanâ such as, Keep My Money (1914), and, That Little Pongee Gown (1913). She died (June 18, 1944) at Clinton, Mississippi, aged eighty-four.\n\nEagle, Mary Kavanagh Oldham â (1854 â 1903)\n\nAmerican suffrage campaigner, civil leader, and writer\n\nMary Kavanagh Oldham was born (Feb 4, 1854) in Kentucky and was raised there. She was trained as a schoolteacher and was employed as such prior to her marriage with James Philip Eagle, later the governor of Eagle Rock, Arkansas (1889 â 1893). The marriage remained childless. Mary Eagle founded the Womenâs Cooperative Association and was a prominent figure amongst the Arkansas Federation of Womenâs Clubs. She was the author of, The Congress of Women: Held in the Womanâs Building, Worldâs Columbian Exposition, Chicago, USA, 1893 (1894). Mary Eagle died (Feb 15, 1903) in Little Rock, Arkansas, aged forty-nine.\n\nEahlswith of Flanders (Ealswid) â (fl. c900 â c930)\n\nFrench noblewoman\n\nEahlswith was the elder daughter of Baldwin II, Count of Flanders (879 â 918) and his wife Elfrida of Wessex, the daughter of Alfred the Great of England and his wife Eahlswith of Gainas, for whom she named. She was sister to Count Arnulf I the Old of Flanders (918 â 964) and to Count Adalulf of Boulogne. Eahlswith and her younger sister Ermentrude were named in the Chronicle of Ethelweard as the daughters of Count Baldwin II. The name of her husband has never been identified, as neither has that of her sister. Either Ealhswith of Ermentrude was the mother of Hildebrand (died after 961) who was appointed as Abbot of St Bertin. The Cartulaire de Saint-Bertin recorded that Count Arnulf was the avunculus (maternal uncle) to Hildebrand but did not specify which sister was his mother.\n\nEahlswith of Gainas (Ealswide, Elswitha) â (c853 â 902)\n\nAnglo-Saxon queen (871 â 899)\n\nEahlswith was the daughter of Aethelred Mucel, earl of Gainas and his wife Eadburga, who was a Mercian princess. She was married (868) to Alfred the Great, who succeeded his brother Aethelred I as king of Wessex (871). Her marriage was an attempt to unite the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and thus protect them from Viking incursions. Eahlswith was the mother of King Edward the Elder (871 â 924) and of Aethelflaed, the famous âLady of Merciansâ. Her husband presented her with the palace of Wantage, in Berkshire, his own birthplace, as her dower estate. The queen founded the convent of St Mary at Winchester, commonly known as âNunnaminster,â where she took the veil after her husbandâs death. Queen Eahlswith died (Dec 5, 902) and was regarded as a saint by the church. Her remains were later removed from Nunnaminster and reinterred within Winchester Cathedral.\n\nEakins, Aimee â (1890 â 1966)\n\nAustralian nurse\n\nEakins was born in New Zealand and did her nursing training at Bendigo, in Victoria, graduating in 1914. With the outbreak of World War I she joined the AANS (Australian Army Nursing Service), serving at Salonika in Greece. She later joined the staff at the Royal Perth Hospital in Western Australia (1927), and established the almonerâs department in that hospital. She remained unmarried. Aimee Eakins died (Feb 7, 1966) in Perth, aged seventy-five.\n\nEalawyn â (c823 â after 850)\n\nAnglo-Saxon princess\n\nEalawyn was the elder daughter of the aetheling Ealhere, governor of Kent (c841 â 853), and niece to king Aethelwulf of Wessex (839 â 856), and was granddaughter to King Egbert. Ealawyn was married to a nobleman named Osbert, who was living in 855. The couple had two children, both living in 859, Eadwald, who held estates at Brabourne and Chart, and Ealburga, the wife of Ealdred, who held estates at Bourne and Brabourne.\n\nEalda â (c919 â c950)\n\nAnglo-Saxon aristocrat and courtier\n\nEalda was perhaps the daughter of Eadric, Earl of Wessex, and sister to Ethelwerd I the Historian (c924 â c998), they being descendants of King Aethelred I (866 â 871), the brother of Alfred the Great. Ealda was married to Ordmaer, earldorman of Wiltshire, whom she predeceased. Her daughter Aethelflaed was the second wife of King Edgar I (959 â 975) and Ealda was the maternal grandmother of King Edward the Martyr (975 â 978).\n\nEaldgythÂ Â Â Â see alsoÂ Â Â Aldgyth\n\nEaldgyth of Northumbria (Aldgyth) â (c1010 â before 1066)\n\nAnglo-Scottish royal heiress\n\nEaldgyth was the daughter of Uchtred, earl of Northumbria, and his third wife Aelfgifu (Elgiva), the daughter of Aethelred II âthe Redeless,â King of England. She was married (c0125) to Prince Maldred, Lord of Allerdale (c1003 â 1045), the younger brother of Duncan I, King of Scotland (1034 â 1040), and grandson of Malcolm II, as his second wife. Ealdgyth survived her husband, but died sometime before the Norman Conquest (1066). She was the mother of Gospatric (c1030 â c1073), earl of Northumbria and, who was deprived of Northumbria (1072) and was created earl of Dunbar instead, and of Maldred (c1035 â after 1084), both of whom left descendants. Through her younger son, Ealdgyth was ancestress of the important English feudal border clan, the Nevills, and also of George Washington, first President of the USA (1789 â 1797).\n\nEaldgyth of Sweden (Eadgyth, Edith) â (c995 â c1028)\n\nAnglo-Saxon queen (1016)\n\nEaldgyth was the daughter of Olaf III Skotkonnung, King of Sweden and the captive Slav princess, Edla. Thus she was half-sister to King Anund Jacob (1022 â 1051) and to Ingegarde, the wife of Jaroslav I, Grand Prince of Kiev. She was married firstly (c1010) to Sighere, the Danish jarl (earl) of Northumbria, who was killed in battle, and secondly (1015), at Malmesbury in Wiltshire, to King Edmund II Ironside (1016) to whom she bore two sons, Edmund, and Edward (he was probably born posthumously).\n\nWith the death of her husband (Nov 30, 1016) and the accession of Canute, Ealdgythâs sons were in great personal danger, as heirs to the throne. Eventually they were sent to exile in Scandinavia to save their own lives. Their ultimate journey into Hungary (c1028), where her younger son would remain for another three decades, probably coincided with her own death. Her younger son Edward (1017 â 1057), surnamed the Exile, was the father of Edgar II Aetheling and St Margaret, queen of Scotland.\n\nEaldgyth Swan-Neck (Eddiva the Fair, Edeva, Edith) â (c1025 â after 1086)\n\nAnglo-Saxon beauty and figure of romantic legend\n\nEaldgyth was of noble ancestry, being probably the granddaughter of King Aethelred II the Redeless, perhaps being the daughter of the Danish earl Thorkell Havi, and his wife Eadgyth, the daughter of King Aethelred, and widow of Eadric Streona, earl of Mercia. Â Probably through her royal mother, Ealdgyth was the heiress of vast estates in East Anglia and was married (c1040) according to Danish âhandfastâ custom and bore him many children. Though the church did not really sanction this custom, there is no indication that the children of Harold and Ealdgyth were not considered royal after their father became king (1066). It was in the interests of the Norman chroniclers of William the Conqueror to denigrate the Anglo-Saxon royal house in favour of the new dynasty. It is this which led to the modern idea that Ealdgyth was only Haroldâs concubine instead of his actual legal wife.\n\nPolitical reasons later caused Harold to repudiate Ealdgyth, and to make a more politically favourable dynastic marriage (1064) with Aldgyth of Mercia, the widow of Gruffyd, king of Wales. This undoubtedly legal marriage also pleased the church. Despite this seperation, the fact of the coupleâs devotion was recorded by the fact that after Haroldâs death in battle at Hastings, it was Ealdgyth who searched through the dead for his mutilated body, being able to identify the king by a private mark known only to her. She organized for his remains to be buried secretly at Waltham. The legend of her search for her former husband was the subject of the famous poem, The Battlefield of Hastings (1855) written by Heinrich Heine.\n\nEaldgyth was still living in 1086, when she was recorded at the owner of considerable property in the Domesday Book. She then held estates in Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, and Suffolk and it names many of her vassals, including four women, which seems to indicate that King William did not confiscate all her estates. She died sometime after this date. Her children were,\n\nGodwin Haroldsson (died after 1072).\n\nEdmund Haroldsson (died after 1069).\n\nMagnus Haroldsson (died after 1068).\n\nUlf Haraldsdotter (died after 1087).\n\nGytha Haroldsdotter (c1053 â 1107). She became the first wife of Vladimir II Monomachus (1053 â 1125), Grand Prince of Kiev (1113 â 1125). She was the ancestress of Philippa of Hainault, the wife of Edward III of England (1327 â 1377) and was the ancestress of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nGunhilda Haraldsdotter (c1061 â after 1095). She became a nun, but left her convent to live with the count of Brittany as his mistress. She later returned to the Abbey of Wilton in Wiltshire, where she died.\n\nEalswideÂ Â seeÂ Â Eahlswith of Gainas\n\nEames, Elizabeth Sara â (1918 â 2008)\n\nBritish archaeologist and scholar of mediaeval tiles\n\nElizabeth Sara Graham was born (June 24, 1918) in Northampton, the daughter of a chemist. She attended school at Rugby, before studying at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she studied archaeology and anthropology. During WW II she was attached to the ATS (Auxiliary Territorial Service), and then went to Denmark in order to study the history of Viking women at the University of Oslo. Eames painstakingly catalogued the large collection of mediaeval floor tiles, most of which were dated between the Norman Conquest (1066) and the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII (1509 â 1547), and which were housed in the British Museum in London. This collection had been purchased from the ninth Duke of Rutland (1947). She directed various archaeological digs, including those at Ramsey Abbey, Cambridgeshire (1967 â 1968) and at Haverholme Priory in Lincolnshire (1970). Elizabeth Eames died (Sept 20, 2008) aged ninety.\n\nEames, Emma Hayden â (1865 â 1952)\n\nAmerican soprano\n\nEames was born in Shanghai, China, the daughter of an international lawyer, and was taught singing from her earliest years. At the age of five (1870), Eames travelled with her mother to Bath, Maine, amd to Boston, where she received further vocal instruction. Receiving further training under Mathilde Marchesi, the teacher of Nellie Melba in Paris (1886 â 1888), she also undertook acting training at the Pluque there. Engaged by the Opera Comique (1888), Eames achieved great success in the role of Juliette in Theodore Gounodâs, Romeo et Juliette (1889), and created the role of Colombe in Camille St-Saensâs, Ascanio. She also appeared in performances of Gounodâs, Faust at Covent Garden in London, but her most famous role was that of Siegelinde. Eames married the painter Julian Story (1891) and appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in New York until 1909, when she retired from the stage. Eames later remarried to the baritone Emilio de Gogorza (1911) with whom she toured in concert, and resided in Paris for some years. Eames later returned to reside in the USA (1936). Emma Eames died (June 13, 1952) in New York aged eighty-six.\n\nEames, Marion â (1921 â 2007)\n\nWelsh novelist and political activist\n\nEames as born in Merseyside, England, and was raised at Dolgellau. She attended the Guildhall College in London, and was employed as a librarian at the Aberystwyth University, before working as a radio producer with the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) in Cardiff. Marion Eamesâs best known published work as, Y Stafell Ddirgel (The Secret Room) (1969). Actively involved in Welsh nationalism and politics, Eames worked as a regional organizer for Plaid Cymru, the political party which worked towards establishing an independent Welsh state within the European Union. Marion Eames died (April 3, 2007) aged eighty-five.\n\nEames, Ray â (1912 â 1988)\n\nAmerican architect\n\nBorn Ray Bernice Alexandra Kaiser in Sacramento, California, she went to New York to study abstract painting with Hans Hofmann, and then attended the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan (1940). There she met the architect Charles Eames (1907 â 1978) whom she married (1941). Together the couple established an outstanding career for themselves as an architectural design team, and they used their own home in Santa Monica (1949) as a showcase of their style of design, as well as establishing a highly popular range of furniture (1946). Also involved with graphics, exhibition design, and film making, they were jointly awarded the Gold Medal by the RIBA (Royal Institute of British Architects. It was the first time this award had been won by a woman, and by a couple (posthumously, for Charles had died the preceeding year). Ray Eames died (Aug 21, 1988) in Los Angeles, California, aged seventy-five.\n\nEames, Rebecca â (1640 â 1721)\n\nAmerican witchtrial victim\n\nRebecca was born in Gloucester, Massachusetts (Feb, 1640) and became the wife of Robert Eames (1661), an immigrant from Bristol in England, to whom she bore eight children, including Nathaniel Eames (1685 â 1765), of Boxford, Essex, Massachusetts.During the notorious Salem witchtrials (1692), Eames was accused of witchcraft, and imprisoned in Salem until her trial, though she was ultimately released. The stress of these events killed her husband (1693). Eames is believed to have saved her life through passing information against other victims. Rebecca Eames survived the Salem trials by thirty years, and died at Boxford, Essex, aged eighty-one (May 8, 1721).\n\nEames, Samantha â (1969 â 2003)\n\nAustralian archaeologist and author\n\nEames attended university rose to become a specialist concerning the the history and artifacts of the Bronze Middle Age Period. She travelled and worked on archaelogical sites throughout the Middle East region, including important expeditions at Tell Brak in north eastern Syria and at Tell Beth Shean at Pella in Jordan. Eames wrote the valuable archaelogical treatise â Between the Desert and the Sown : The Hauran as a Frontier Zone in the Bronze Middle Age,â which was printed in the Palestine Exploration Quarterly (2003). Samantha Eames died young (March 31, 2004) from a tumour of the brain, in Queensland, aged only thirty-three.\n\nEanflaed â (626 - c704)\n\nAnglo-Saxon queen and abbess\n\nPrincess Eanflaed was born (April 17, 626) the eldest daughter of Edwin of Deira, King of Northumbria, and his second wife Aethelburh, the daughter of Aethelbert I, king of Kent, and was baptised a Christian when only a few weeks old (June 5), being the first Northumbrian to receive Christian baptism. With the death of her father (634), she resided in Kent with her family.\n\nAfter her return to the Northumbrian court, she was married (643) to Oswiu (Oswy), King of Northumbria, the marriage designed to unite the two sections of Northumbria into one coherent kingdom. Oswiu granted Enflaed the estate of Gilling, near Richmond, as part of a dynastic reparation (651), where she built a monastery.\n\nBecause of her efforts to instill the Roman ritual at the court, Pope Vitalian sent the queen a cross of gold, with a key, made from links that were believed to have formed part of the chains of St Peter and St Paul. With her husbandâs death in battle (670), she became a nun at the abbey of Whitby, with her daughter Aelfflaed under the presidence of Abbess Hilda. There she later became abbess, though she may have shared that office jointly with her daughter. Her daughter Osthryth became the ill-fated wife of Aethelred, King of Mercia.\n\nQueen Eanflaed took a prominent interest in ecclesiastical affairs, and was patron of Bishop Wilfred of York, whom she encouraged to become a monk, and whom she assisted so that he might make a pirlgrimage to Rome. The church regarded Eanflaed as a saint (Nov 24), but the later destruction of Whitby by the Danes has removed all trace of an early lirutgical cult of Eanflaed, though Glastonbury Abbey claimed to have her relics. The late Welsh tradition that Eanflaed and Edwin were baptized by a certain Rum map Urbgen can be dismissed as fable.\n\nEangyth â (c660 â after 718)\n\nAnglo-Saxon nun\n\nEangyth was of noble birth and during her youth the mistress of Centwine, King of Wessex (676 â 685) to whom she bore a natural daughter Edburga (Bucge) (c680). Eangyth took holy orders and was placed as abbess of the convent at Minster on the island of Sheppey in Kent, where she raised their daughter. Mother and daughter were on friendly terms with St Boniface, with whom they corresponded. A surviving letter (dated c716 â 718) is written by Eangyth and her daughter jointly, and in it they apologise for writing âin rustic style and unpolished language.â The abbess also speaks of problems facing the religious community, and mentions the desire of both ladies to make a pilgrimage to Rome. Eangyth died before this could be accomplished, though her daughter later travelled there.\n\nEanswyth (Eanswida) â (c619 â 640)\n\nAnglo-Saxon saint\n\nPrincess Eanswyth was the daughter of Eadbald, King of Kent (616 â 640), and his third wife, the Merovingian princess, Emma of Austrasia. She was full-sister to kings, Earconbert (640 â 664) and Eormenraed (640 â c656). Eanswyth steadfastly refused to consider a marriage arranged for her by her father with a Northumbrian prince, and she fled his court. Eventually he consented to her building a monastery at Folkestone (after 630), where she was veiled as a nun and spent the remainder of her short life. It is recorded that her abbey lacked a supply of fresh water, which she is miraculously supposed to have recitified by producing a condhuit a mile long by striking the ground with her crozier. Eanswyth died (Aug 31, 640), aged barely twenty. Regarded a saint, her feast was observed annually (Sept 12).\n\nEanswythâs convent was later destroyed by the Danes, though the church was refounded by King Athelstan (924 â 939). The convent was later refounded for Black Benedictine monks on the same site (1095). Part of it was swallowed up by the encroaching sea, and the house was removed to Folkestone. Its successor is the parish church of St Mary and St Eanswida, built in the twelfth century. A Saxon coffin discovered in the north wall (1885) containing the bones of a young woman, are thought to be her relics.\n\nEarcongota (Eorcungoda, Erkengota) â (c643 â 660)\n\nAnglo-Saxon saint\n\nPrincess Earcongota was the daughter of Earconbert, king of Kent (640 â 664) and his wife Sexburga, the daughter of Anna, King of East-Anglia. She was sister to the Kentish rulers Egbert I (664 â 673) and Lothair (673 â 685). Earcongota accompanied her two aunts, Saelfryd and Ethelburga, to the abbey of Faremoutier, in Brie, France, where she was trained for life as a nun. She was said to have been forewarned of her death by a visitation from angels, so that she made a farewell visit to each of the sisters of the abbey, recommending themselves to their prayers, and died the same night in great peace, aged only about seventeen. Her body was enshrined in the church of St Stephen, where her grave exuded a balsamic scent several days later, which was believed to attest to her great sanctity. Later canonized, Earcongotaâs feast was kept at Faremoutier and at Ely in Kent (Feb 21). At Meaux in France her feast was observed five days later (Feb 26). She was never an abbess as is sometimes maintained, and the alternate veneration date (July 7), whilst commonly given, is incorrect.\n\nEardley, Joan Kathleen Harding â (1921 â 1963)\n\nBritish painter\n\nEardley was born (May 21, 1921) in Warnham, Sussex, the daughter of William Edward Eardley, an army officer, and was raised in Horsham, Sussex, and later in London, studying at the Goldsmithâs College of Art in London (1938) and at the Glasgow School of Art (1940 â 1943). She travelled to France and Italy after World War II, but then returned to Glasgow and taught evening classes. Eardley was best known for her simple portrayals of daily scenes and people, some from the tenements of the city, her own style being influenced by Vincent Van Gogh. For some years she worked at Catterline, near Aberdeen, which was the inspiration behind her most beautiful seascapes and landscapes, and she was elected to the Royal Scottish Academy just prior to her death (1963). Examples of her work are preserved in the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, the Birmingham City Art Gallery, the Huddersfield Gallery, and the South London Art Gallery, amongst others. Joan Eardley died aged only forty-two (Aug 16, 1963).\n\nEardley-Wilmot, May â (1883 â 1970)\n\nBritish lyricist\n\nEardley-Wilmot was the elder daughter of Rear Admiral Sir Sydney Marow Eardley-Wilmot, and his wife Grace Maud Hoare. She was educated privately at home, and then abroad at Heidelberg, in Germany. With the completion of her education and her return to England she became closely involved with the Performing Right Society, establishing a reputation for herself as a popular lyricist, and was a devoted leader of community singing. Eardley-Wilmot wrote the lyrics for several popular songs including, âLittle Grey Home in the Westâ âRose of My Heart,â âComing Home,â âThe Road of Looking Forward,â and, âWhat a Wonderful World it Would be.â She also wrote a volume of poems, published under the title, Voice from Dunkirk. May Eardley-Wilmot died unmarried (June 3, 1970) at Bromley, Kent, aged eighty-six.\n\nEarhart, Amelia Mary â (1898 â 1937)Â\n\nAmerican aviatrix\n\nEarhart was born in Atchison, Kansas, the daughter of a lawyer, and trained to become a qualified nurse and social worker in Toronto, Canada, during World War I. She married George Palmer Putnam (1931) but retained her own surname. She first attracted public attention when she became the first female passenger and log-keeper to fly the Atlantic Ocean, the flight leaving Newfoundland and arriving safely at Burry Point, in Wales, Britain (June 17, 1928). Gaining her flying license after lessons from aviatrix Neta Snook, Earhart became the first woman to successfully cross the Atlantic alone (May 20 â 21, 1932). She made highly publicized and successful flights from Hawaii to California (1935) and Mexico City to Newark, New Jersey (1935). Earhart founded an American womenâs flying the group, the Ninety-Nines, and was appointed as an officer of the Luddington Line, the first airline service to provide regular passenger service between Washington, D.C. and New York.\n\nAmelia Earhartâs plane disappeared over the Pacific Ocean during an attempt to fly around the world (July, 1937). Her body and that of her navigator, Fred Noonan were never recovered, and there has always remained much mystery and speculation, some reasonable, some completely outlandish, as to the manner of their deaths. Her autobiography Last Flight (1938), was edited posthumously by her husband.\n\nEarle, Alice Morse â (1853 â 1911)\n\nAmerican historian, antiquarian and author\n\nEarle was born (April 27, 1853) in Worcester, Massachussetts. She wrote concerning a variety of colonial subjects such as domestic life, the upbringing of children and the problems entailed, stage-coaches, and gardening.

A noted society horticulturalist, Earle wrote several gardening works such as the best-seller, Pot-Pourri from a Surry Garden (1897), which ran into eleven reprints during the first years, and which was followed by, More Pot-Pourri, A Third Pot-Pourri (1908), and, Gardening for the Ignorant (1912). Her last publication, Pot-Pourri Mixed by Two, was co-written with Ethel Case. Mrs Earle also wrote, Letters to Young and Old (1906) and a volume of reminiscences, Memoirs and Memories (1911). Maria Theresa Earle died at Cobham, Surrey, aged eighty-eight (Feb 27, 1925).\n\nEarle, Merie â (1889 â 1984)\n\nAmerican character actress\n\nEarle only began her film career in her seventh decade, and then embarked on a career in television at the age of eighty-two.

Several of her later movie credits were produced when she was over ninety, such as, Fatso (1980) and, Going Ape! (1981). Earle also made several appearances on the television in, The Jerry Reed When youâre Hot Youâre Hot Hour (1972), and in, The Waltons (1973 â 1979).\n\nEarly, Eleanor â (1891 â 1969)\n\nAmerican newspaper correspondent, journalist and author\n\nEarly was born in Newton, Massachusetts.

She married (1893) George Frederick Earp, the brother of Australian consul Charles A. Earp (1877 â 1933). Residing in Newcastle, New South Wales, from 1893, Earp established herself as a vocalist and artist of some considerable talent, and was president of the Queen Victoria Club (1912). Greatly interested in the field of domestic health care, Earp established first-aid and knitting classes in her own home at Point Piper, as well as providing basic instructions and lectures concerning home nursing. A board member of the Crown Street Womenâs Hospital, she was a member of the National Council of Women, and strongly advocated protection for the indigenous aborigines. Gertrude Earp died in Sydney, aged seventy-five (Sept 5, 1946).\n\nEarp, Josephine â (1861 â 1944)\n\nAmerican actress and lawmanâs wife\n\nBorn Josephine Marcus in New York, she was raised in San Francisco in California. She joined Paulina Markhamâs travelling theatre company as a dancer (1879). Though technically an actress, she ahd resorted to prostitution to survive, and it was whilst on the way to Prescott in Arizona that she met up with Johnny Behan, sheriff of Yavapai County, who asked to marry her.\n\nJosephine at first refused, but changed her mind and lived with Behan at Tombstone in Arizona. When he became involved with another woman, Josephine left him for the famous lawman Wyatt Earp (1881). This was the main reason behind the famous gunfight at the O.K. Corral in that year. Adopting Earpâs name she accompanied him around America, panning for gold and racing horses in San Diego, and exchanged her jewellery with the millionaire Lucky Baldwin, in exchange for gambling credits. Widowed in 1930, she fought to have Earpâs name removed from the film which was eventually titled Frontier Marshal (1939), and released by 20th Century Fox Studios, even though she benefitted financially from the movie. Josephine Earp died (Dec 20, 1944) in Los Angeles, aged eighty-three.\n\nEason, Ruth Paul â (1898 â 1976)\n\nAmerican educator and author\n\nRuth Paul was the daughter of David Philo Paul, of Portsmouth, and his wife Annie Gertrude Bright.

She wrote several novels such as, Broken Lights: A Novel (1929), Gifts from God: Two Stories (1953), The Southern Moon (1938), and, A Strange Way Home (1952), which concentrated on unlikely exotic themes and were not particularly well written. She sometimes assumed the pseudonym âRenee Easterling.â Narena Easterling died (Sept 26, 1957) aged sixty-six.\n\nEastern Jewel â (1907 â 1948)\n\nMongolian spy and traitor\n\nBorn Princess Hsien-hsi (Chun Chu Kung Chu) in Inner Mongolia, she was the daughter of Prince Shan-chi (1863 â 1922) and his concubine Tong Chen, and was related to the last Chinese emperor Pu-Yi.

She was married instead (1927) to Kanjurjab, a Mongolian prince, son of the mongol general Babojab, but deserted him four months later. The couple were later divorced (1931). Beautiful and engaging, she wore Western male attire, and attracted hordes of lovers, including Ryukichi Tanaka, the head of the Japanese Intelligence Service in Shanghai.\n\nFrom 1931 she worked with Tanaka to provoke the Chinese against Japanese business, in order to give a pretext for Japanese agression.Eastern Jewelâs influence was all pervading, she instigated riots, intrigued and committed treason against her own people, and plotted the downfall and deaths of high-ranking officials, whilst simultaneously being involved with a treasonous liasion with Tanaka. She was seen to publicly rejoice over the bombing of Shanghai (1932) and wore Japanese military uniform and held the rank of a commander. Sadistic and syphilitic, she was later arrested, tried and found guilty of treason. Such was the abhorrence of her crimes that she was refused a military execution and was beheaded (March 25, 1948) in Peking (Beijing).\n\nEastlake, Caroline â (fl. 1868 â 1873)\n\nBritish painter\n\nCaroline Eastlake was a native of Plymouth, and specialised in the painting of British wild flowers.

Mrs Eastmanâs first published work, Dahcotah; or, Life and Legends of the Sioux Around Fort Snelling (1849), is believed to have inspired Henry Wadsworth Longfellow to write his famous poem, The Song of Hiawatha (1855). Her second novel, Aunt Phillisâs Cabin; or, Southern Life As It Is (1852) was written as the Southern answer to Harriet Beecher Stoweâs controversial, Unce Tomâs Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly (1851).
