Octavian divorced his first wife Scribonia and forced Livia to divorce Tiberius so they could marry in 38 BCE. It was a political marriage in the tradition of the Republic, intended to bring together the wealth and might of the gens claudia and the gens julia, the Julian family, into which Octavian had been adopted by Julius Cæsar. The marriage thus formed an important part of Octavian’s strategy in the intense power struggles of the late Republic. The dynasty they founded is known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Though their union was political in nature, there were warm feelings between the two, at the very least a profound sense of mutual loyalty. Their marriage lasted 52 years, until the death of Augustus in 14 CE. Livia never bore him any children, but Augustus Adopted Tiberius after a number of other possible heirs all died. Livia’s son Drusus died in an accident in 9 CE. Livia was quite influential, through her personal wealth, through her intelligence and political sense, and through her marriage. She played a central role in the establishment of the Principate, along with Augustus and M. Agrippa. Livia’s influence continued when her son Tiberius became emperor, until her death in 29 CE at the age of 85.

In 48, she asked for and received Roman help in fighting the rebellion. Cartimandua’s consort, Venutius attempted to have her overthrown but he was unsuccessful after the Romans came to her aid. For a while Cartimandua ruled jointly with Venutius, but when he made another attempt to overthrow her, she took Vellocatus, a royal armor-bearer, as her consort. She sent Vellocatus to fight Venutius and, again, asked for Roman help. Circa 69, Cartimandua “retired” and in 71, Rome annexed Brigantia after they easily defeated Venutius, Vellocatus and the Brigantes in battle.\n\n45/6–68/9 Joint Ruler Queen Eunike of the Bosporanian Realm\n\nReigned together with Kotys I.

Agrippina acted as his regent and was a powerful controlling influence on him even after he came of age. After about a year, Nero moved her out of the imperial palace. She began to denounce her son more and more in public. After the tension between mother and son grew to a critical level, Nero determined to be rid of her, and had her killed.

They were client monarch of Rome, (1st cent. BCE-1st cent. A.D). Women played a significant role in Nabatean society.\n\n88-97 Regent Dowager Empress Tou Hsien of China\n\nAlso known was Dou, she took over the regency for Liv Chao (Hedi) (79-88-106). She led the court audiences (linchao), and her brother Dou Xian took over the governmental affairs. An eunuch of Emperor Hedi called Zheng Zhong finally destroyed the power of the Dou clan and grasped the power himself. They belonged to the Later Hou and Eastern Han Dynasty, which was able to keep China united for about 200 years.\n\n105-106 Regent The Dowager Empress of China\n\nAfter the death of Emperor He, she announced that he had left two young sons who had been brought up outside the palace, but that the elder brother, Liu Sheng, was suffering from an incurable illness and was unfit to rule. She therefore placed the younger, Liu Long, upon the throne, and even when he died a few months later, aged just over a year old, she again passed over Liu Sheng in favour of Liu You, a nephew of Emperor He, later known as Emperor An (reigned 106-125). Inevitably, much of the information formed an intimate secret of the state, and all the decisions and announcements were made on the authority of the Dowager alone.\n\n105-21 Regent Dowager Empress Deng Sui of China\n\nHer son, Aiu Long (Aidi) (105-06) was only 13 at his throne accession, and together with her brother Deng Zhi, she controlled him, who was nominal ruler during the Han-Dynasty period. Later she placed her grandson, Shang, on the throne when he was barely 100 days old, despite having two older brothers who were born from a consort. She also raised Liu Hu, the twelve-year old cousin of Shangdi and future Emperor Han Aidi, in the palace as the successor to the throne as insurance against the baby emperor’s death. Liu Hu ascended to the throne when Shang passed away in 106; however, she still remained as the regent. A decree by her during this reign shed light on bureaucratic inefficiency. Also influential during the reign of her grandson. When she died her most prominent relatives chose suicide. She lived (80-121).\n\n112-? Regent Dowager Queen Gespaepyris of Pontus (Turkey)\n\nGespaepyris was born as Princess of Thrace and ruled on behalf of her son Mithridates VI. in the kingdom in Asia Minor.\n\n114 Queen Regnant Yasovati of Kashmir (India)\n\nThe contemporary sources says abut her; “The ruins of Martanda and other old temples are even now called ‘Pandawa Houses’ and Kalhana says it was at Lord Krishna’s advice that Yasovati was made Queen regent of Kashmir after Krishna had defeated King Damodara, Yasovati’s husband”.\n\n120-25 Politically Influential Empress Yan of China\n\nAfter Dowager Empress Deng’s death, she dominated the court together with the eunuchs Li Run and Jiang Jing, and her brother Yan Xian.\n\n130-?

In these circumstances an empress-dowager of Han acquired even greater power, for she had undisputed authority to choose the next emperor from any of the male members of the imperial family. The precedent for this dated back to Former Han, but had been decisively confirmed by the Dowager Deng in 105 and 106. Three weeks later she choose the 8-year-old Liu Zuan, a great-great grandson of Emperor Zhang, who also died after one year on the throne and Liu Zhi was placed upon the throne. For the next few years she held formal control of the government in association with her brother Liang Ji. The historians praised her for her devotion to duty in the difficult times, which followed the second great rebellion of the Qiang people in the northwest and a series of frontier disturbances with the Xiongnu of the north. Inside China, reflecting these troubles, there were frequent small-scale rebellions, increased feuding amongst local gentry and a gradual alienation from the imperial regime. Apparently she appointed good officials, sent out troops to deal with disorder, and all the empire was settled by her efforts. Emperor Huan came of age in 148, but she maintained her regency, on the grounds of the disturbances in the empire. She formally relinquished her office in the first month of 150, and she died a few weeks later. She lived (116-150).\n\nAround 150 Joint Queen Regnant Ulfan of Elymias (Iraq)\n\nReigned together with Orodes IV of the Helleno-Iranian kingdom located in what are now southeastern Iraq and the Zagros Mountains of Iran. Its name is a Hellenization of “Elam”, an ancient state in roughly the same region. Its capital was Susa, the centre of the Achaemenid Persian kings.\n\n168-72 Regent Princess Dou Shi of China\n\nRuled in the name of her son Liu Hong (168-89). During the end of the Han Dynasty, the rulers became more and more dissolute. But more importantly, they were unable to deal with two factors: a population shift from the Yellow River in the north to the Yangzi in the south; and they simply could not control barbarian tribal raiders from the north, which were one reason why people were moving to the south. Eventually, in 220, the centre had lost so much control to the provinces that it collapsed (a small rebellion in the north helped), plunging China into 350 years of chaos and disunity.\n\n180-90 Queen Regnant Somâ of Fu-Nan (Cambodia and Vietnam)\n\nSoma succeeded her father, and ruled over a kingdom which extending over much of present-day Cambodia and southern Vietnam from the 1st to the 6th centuries. It owed its prosperity to its position on the great trade route between India and China and subsequent Khmer dynasties viewed Funan as the state from which they were descended. The name is a transliteration of the ancient Khmer form of the word phnom (= hill).\n\nCirca 188-248 Queen Himiko of Yamataikoku (Japan)\n\n卑弥呼 is also referred to as Pimiko, she was ruler of an ancient state-like formation thought to have been located either in the Yamato region or in northern Kyushu of present-day Japan. Few records are available and little is known about her, and the location of Yamataikoku is the subject of a great, often emotionally charged, debate that has been raging since the late Edo period. According to an ancient Chinese history book, Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms she was a shaman who controlled people through her paranormal abilities. The Nihonshoki, an old Japanese history book, notes that Himiko was actually Empress Jingū Kogo, the mother of Emperor Ōjin, but historians disagree. Some speculate that she is conflated with Amaterasu, the Japanese sun goddess. The Chinese chronicles book from 297 refers to the inhabitants of the Japanese islands simply as the Wa, literally, “The Little People”, and dscribes a fragmented political structure of more than a hundred or more separate tribes, nominally ruled by a female shaman. According to an ancient Korean history book, Samguk Sagi, she sent an embassy to King Adalla of Silla in May 172. However, Chinese history books record Silla as having been established on 356, which casts doubt on this claim. Himiko never married and it is recorded that her younger brother assisted her as a political advisor. She is said to have had one thousand female servants and to have never appeared in public. There are indications that a tribal king, posthumously now known as Emperor Shujin, raised military host against her or her successor – reportedly another shamaness, her niece or other relative, ultimately conquering their position and establishing male rule with headquarters in central Japan. Himiko may have been a Chinese corruption of Himemiko, princess-priestess, or lady shaman. The name is said to mean “Sun Daughter” and there are also assessments that she is the real person upon whom the myth of sun goddess Amaterasu is built. Also Known as Yamatohime no Mikoto (d. 248)\n\n189 Politically Influential Empress Dowager He Mou of Han China\n\nChief consort of Emperor Ling of Han Dynasty China.

Throughout much of the year, she acted as balancing force between the eunuch faction, led by Jian Shuo and Zhang Rang, and the official faction, led by He Jin and Yuan Shao. The climax of the struggles came in September, when He Jin was assassinated by the eunuchs at the imperial palace. In the chaotic fighting which followed, she lost all the members of her clan of political importance, including her brother He Miao and mother, the Lady of Wuyang. Her son was deposed in favour of his younger half-brother Liu Xie. Empress Dowager He was accused of the murder of Empress Dowager Dong and ordered to move to the Yongle Palace, outside the main palace complex.

Caracalla had murdered his brother Geta in her private apartments even as the younger son sought protection in her arms. After Macrinus had murdered Caracalla and seized the throne in 217, he sent her away from Antiochia after it was reported that Julia was inciting troops to rebel against him. At this time, she was believed to be about fifty years old and was suffering from a painful illness, probably cancer of the breast.

As the emperor’s mother, with the title Iulia Soaemias Augusta, she played a great role in government and administration and was in fact the de facto ruler of Rome, since her son was concerned mainly with religious matters. Their rule was not popular and soon discontent arose. The Praetorian Guard killed Julia Soaemias and Heliogabalus in 222, and she was declared public enemy and her name erased from all records.

She lived (441-90).\n\n474-84 Politically Influential Empress Verina of The Roman Empire and Byzantine (Italy etc, Greece and Turkey)\n\nHer husband, Leo I was succeeded by their grandson Leo II (seven years old), who appointed his father Zeno as Co-Emperor with her support, but after Leo’s death in November 474 she fought for power with Zeno. In January 475 he was overthrown by her and her allies. She wanted to make her brother Bazyliskos, and Patrikios, Emperors. She planned to marry Patrikios. She personally crowned her brother, but he killed Patrikios, and she again entered into an alliance with Zeno, who regained the throne in 476. Afterwards Veria became one of the most influential and powerful persons on the court and later fought for power with Illus. In 477-78 she organized two unsuccessfully coup d’etats against Illus, who took her hostage. In 481 her daughter, Empress Ariane, organized an unsuccessful coup d’etat against Illus to free her, the same year the emperor forced Illus to leave for Constantinople, where he announced a patrician Leoncius as the real emperor. Veria joined to him, and at 19th July 484 she personally crowned Leoncius. She published a document for the administrators of provinces and for the citizens of Antiochia, where she wrote, that the imperial power belonged to her. She had, after her husband’s death, chosen Zeno as Emperor, but she had not know, that Zeno was so greedy, and therefore she now wanted to a pious and just Christian as Emperor, who would repair the state and bring peace. This is seen as an example of the fact that public and political personal power could pass down trough the female line in The Byzantine Empire. The Augusta could legitimize the rule of their husband’s or others. But all power was vested in the Emperor, and everybody else – including officials at court – depended on his will. One of her three daughters, Ariane was married to Emperor Zeno. She died in 484.\n\n478-79 Rebellion Leader Princess Leontia of the Byzantine Empire (Covering what is now Greece and Turkey)\n\nShe was the youngest daughter of Emperor Leo I and Empress Aelia Verina. Her older sister was Empress Ariadne. Leontia was first married to Patricius, a son of Aspar. Their marriage was probably annulled when Aspar and another of his sons, Ardabur, were assassinated in 471. Leontia then married Marcian, a son of Anthemius and Marcia Euphemia. The couple led a failed revolt against Zeno in 478-479. They were exiled to Isauria following their defeat.\n\n484-85 Princess Regent Iitoyo Ao no Kōjo of Yamato (Japan)\n\nAs Emperor Seinei (reigned 479-484) lay dying without having named a successor, serious conflict between the various factions at court seemed inevitable. To avoid this, the nobles chose her, the highest ranking shamaness as a consensus sovereign. A daughter of the 16th Emperor Richu and with a lineage that could be traced back to Õjin, she lived within Takaki (Tall Stockade) tending to the spiritual needs of the Yamato people. She declined to assume the title of tennõ but ruled until the children of her late brother could be brought back from exile. She lived (440-485).\n\nCirca 490 Queen Regnant Lobamba of Kuba (Congo-Brazzaville)\n\nDaughter of Loko Yima and succeeded by Woto. The state developed east of the confluence of the Sankuru and Kasai rivers, before the Kubans migrated to its present habitat in the Kuba area.\n\n491 Regent Dowager Empress Ariane of The Byzantine Empire (Covering what is now Greece and Turkey)\n\nAlso known as Aelia Ariadane, she was the daughter of Leo I (447-74). She\n\nwas married to Tarasicodissa, who became Emperor Zeno, and after his death in 491 the Senate officially requested her to choose another candidate to rule and she married Anastasios I, who became emperor.\n\nCirca 480 Queen and Admiral Artemisia I of Caria-Harlikarnassos and Kos (Turkey)\n\nAs a vassal of Persia, Artemisia was obliged to recruit her own small force when Xerxes invaded Greece – in fact, Artemisia commanded five ships in her own right. Artemisia alone of his commanders advised Xerxes against a naval battle with the Greeks but Xerxes, however, chose to follow the advice of his male advisors, and met the Greeks on the sea in the channel of Salamis on 20th September 480 BCE. Artemisia was aboard one of her ships, commanding their movements. After the initial confusion, the Persians took the offensive. Though she only had one ship left, Artemisia herself disabled the ship of King Damasithymus of Calynda. At a council, Artmesia spoke her mind – she had opposed the war from the beginning and opposed its continuation. She advised Xerxes to leave his trusted commander Mardonus to pursue the Greeks whilst Xerxes himself return home, and would still maintained his dignity whether in victory or defeat. For her wisdom, Xerxes entrusted Artemisia with the care on his sons, and returned home to a kingdom racked by rebellion and conspiracy, to which he ultimately became a victim. Her kingdom prospering from her good relations with Persia.\n\n465-circa 440 Politically Influential Queen Amestris of Persia (Iran)\n\nThe Greek historian, Therodotus, describes her as a cruel despot. Herodotus reported that she sacrificed children of Persians to the Gods. After the death of her husband, Xerxes I, she was politically influential during reign her son, Artaxerxes I Makrocheir. During the reign of her son Artaxerxes I (465-424), another son, Achaemenes, was killed by Egyptian rebels. The general Megabyzus, who offered terms to the rebels to shorten the war, defeated them and their Athenian allies. According to the historian Ctesias, Amestris was enraged because Megabyzus had not punished the murderers of her son. Initially, Artaxerxes did not allow her revenge, but after five years (around 449), he permitted her to crucify the Egyptian leader, Inarus, and kill several captives. She lived (before 486-circa 440).\n\nBefore 440-429 Politically Influential Aspasia of Milos in Athens (Greece)\n\nBorn in the Ionian Greek colony of Miletus (in what is now Turkey), but at some point travelled to Athens, where she\n\nbecame a hetaira – a high-class entertainer (or courtesan), which meant that she was highly educated, independent and paid paying taxes.

Their house became an intellectual centre in Athens, attracting the most prominent writers and thinkers, including the philosopher Socrates. She was known not only to beautiful, but intelligent and skilled in writing and speech; moreover, she was believed to have great political influence. She was openly credited by writers such as Plato with making a significant contribution to Pericles’ oratory, especially his famous funeral oration. Her political influence also brought her unpopularity; she was said, for example, to be responsible for the Samian revolt of 440, and for the Peloponnesian War with Sparta (431-404). She was not only attacked by the comic playwrights, but was actually accused of impiety by Hermippus, a comic poet, though Pericles was able successfully to defend her. Plato was so impressed by her intelligence and wit that he is thought to have based his character Diotima on her. After Pericles’ death in 429 BCE, Aspasia married the democrat Lysides, with whom she had another son. She lived (circa 469–circa 406).\n\n424-405 Joint-Ruler Queen Parysatis of Persia (Iran)\n\nDaughter of Xerxes I (486-66), who was murdered by his chamberlain and succeeded by her brother, Xerxes II, who was assassinated after only 45 days by his half brother, Secydianus, but Parysatis and her husband and brother Darius II conspired against him and had him deposed after only 6 months. She was co-ruler during her husband’s reign, and among other things secured the appointment of her son, Cyrus as Satrap of Lydia, Cappadocia and Phrygia (all in western Turkey) in 408 or 408. At the same time, he was appointed as commander in chief of Asia Minor, when he was only 15-17 years old. He succeeded to the throne in 404.\n\nAround 401 Joint Ruler Queen Epyaxa of Cilicia (Turkey)\n\nKnown from references to her in Xenophon’s Persian Expedition, where she gives considerable aid to the rebel Cyrus.

They were among the first people to completely master the art of horsemanship, and their ferocity and mobility became legendary because of it. Superb mounted archers, they also maintained a brilliant and artistically gifted culture whose artefacts can be appreciated in museums around the world.

The presiding kentakes, known in history as “Black Queen Candace of Nubia”, designed a battle plan to counter Alexander’s advance. She placed her armies and waited on a war elephant for the Macedonian conqueror to appear for battle. Alexander approached the field from a low ridge, but when he saw the Black Queen’s army displayed in a brilliant military formation before him, he stopped. After studying the array of warriors waiting with such deadly precision and realizing that to challenge the kentakes could quite possibly be fatal, he turned his armies away from Nubia toward a successful campaign in Egypt.\n\n344-30 Regent Queen Cleopatra of Macedonia of Epirus (Greece)\n\nSister of Alexander the Great, Married to Alexander of Epirus.

His daughter, Ada II, married a persian nobleman, Orontobates, who became satrap of Caria. Even after the death of Pixodarus, her son-in-law kept her a prisoner in Alinda. Seizing the opportunity afforded by Alexander’s invasion, Ada I opened negotiations with him offering the surrender of all of Caria if she were placed upon her rightful throne. She further offered to adopt him as her son making him at once the legal heir to the throne of Caria by Carian law. Alexander turned inland to face the armies of Orontobates and Memnon who stood ready to defend Halicarnassus. The siege was a short one as Alexander’s army was joined by the Carian forces loyal to their Queen and with Ada at the head of her armies given the honour of taking the acropolis. Though Orontobates and Memnon escaped by sea, Ada sat again on the throne of Halicarnassus and stayed there until her death sometime after the death of Alexander.\n\n334-circa 323 Regent Princess Barsine of Persia of Pergamon (Turkey)\n\nRuled in the name of her and Alexander the Great’s son Herakles.

Her son, Antiochiaus VIII Grypus (121-96) was co-ruler only in name. But in 121 Cleopatra offers a cup of wine to Antiochiaus when he has returned from the hunt. He insisted that she drank the wine herself, which she did – and died.\n\n141-135 Regent Dowager Empress Dou of China\n\nReigned in the name of her grandson, Emperor Wu Di, who struggled to build a coalition of support to challenge her influence. Imperial patronage swung back and forth like a pendulum depending on who momentarily enjoyed the upper hand.

He was brought back to Alexandria to co-rule and Cleopatra’s favourite, Alexander was sent to Cyprus. Lathyros was married to his sister, Cleopatra IV but their mother repudiated the marriage and replaced her with another sister, Cleopatra Selene. Cleopatra IV went to Cyprus where she tried to raise an army and to marry Ptolemy Alexander. She failed and moved on to Syria where she used her army as a dowry and married Antiochiaus IX Cyzicenus who was son of Antiochiaus Sidetes and Cleopatra Thea. Cleopatra III finally succeeded in driving out Lathyros in 107 BCE when she accused him of trying to murder her. He left behind his wife and his two sons. His brother returned from Cyprus and assumed the throne. After the death of Alexander in a naval battle, Lathyros, who was now in his mid-fifties, was brought back to Alexandria to try to put back together the Ptolemaic empire. He died at the age of 62 and left no legitimate heir to the throne, as both of his sons by Cleopatra Selene appear to have died at a young age.

Feng Liao was to remain in the western regions for over 50 years. Acting as the Princess’s envoy, she did much to promote unity and friendship between the Hans and the various minority nationalities in the Western Regions. Touring the tribes south of the Tianshan Mountains in the Western Regions, she succeeded in establishing friendly relations with them all. Feng Liao was a student of history, and she avidly studied the policies of the Han court, as well as the customs of people living in the Western Regions. Her political insight, manners and generosity won her the honorable title, “Madame Feng”. Another outstanding contribution, that Feng Liao made, was to settle a struggle over power among the Wusun tribal chiefs. Those in power in the Wusun tribe were then splitting into two fiercely contending factions: one being pro-Xiongnu, and the other pro-Han. When the old chieftain died, the Han Princess married his successor Wongguimi, who also had a Xiongnu wife. Wongguimi also died not long after, leaving his son Nimi, born of his Xiongnu wife, in power.\n\nCirca 102-circa 90 Joint Queen Regnant Anzaza of Elymias (Iraq)\n\nRuled together with Kamnaskares III (circa 120-circa 77) of the Helleno-Iranian kingdom located in what are now southeastern Iraq and the Zagros Mountains of Iran.

Even if Caere did not have kings and Queens at this time (as did Rome, or as Caere certainly did in the 5th century), it is clear that society had become sharply differentiated, not only in regard to wealth but also in division of labour. Many scholars hypothesize the existence of a powerful aristocratic class, and craftsmen, merchants, and seamen would have formed a middle class; it was probably at this time that the Etruscans began to maintain the elegant slaves for which they were famous.\n\nAround 100 Ruler Aba of Olbe (Turkey)\n\nThe daughter of Zenofantes, tyrant of Cilicia, and Olbe was a city in this principality.\n\nCirca 82-65 Joint Ruler Queen Anzaze of the Arskadies and Sasanides (or Elymasis) (Persia)\n\nReigned together with King Kamnaskires II.\n\n80-57 Co-Regent Queen Cleopatra VI Tryphæna of Egypt\n\n57-56 Reigning Queen\n\nDaughter of Cleopatra V and sister of Cleopatra VII and Berenike IV.

This led to discontent and finally to civil war, partly instigated by Tigran, whom Phraates, King of Parthia, was secretly backing. Augustus sent his godson, Caius Caesar, to bring about an appeasement, but before his arrival, Tigran IV was killed in a riot, while she took to flight. The revolt was suppressed, and in the year 1 CE, the Armenian throne was bestowed upon Ariobarzan, a Mede by origin, who was accepted because of his eminent qualities. But he very shortly was killed by accident, and Augustus nominated Artavazd, his son, as his successor. But the opposition to foreign rule soon found expression in the assassination of the King. Augustus thereupon abandoned his ill-conceived policy and sent Tigran V, a descendant of the national dynasty, to occupy the throne.

With all rivals out of the way, she and her son poisoned the king and assumed the throne in 2 BC. They appear together on their coins, and were apparently co-rulers.
