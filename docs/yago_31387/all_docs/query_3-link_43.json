        "text": "Published 2021 This book provides the first detailed overview of research on rulership in theory and practice, with a particular emphasis on the monarchies of Bohemia, Hungary and Poland in the High and Late Middle Ages. The contributions examine the legitimation of rule of the first local dynasties, the ritual practice of power, the ruling strategies and practices of power in the established monarchies, and the manifold influences on the rulership in East Central Europe from outside the region (such as from Byzantium, and the Holy Roman Empire). The collection shows that these ideas and practices enabled the new polities to become legitimate members of Latin Christendom.\n\nN.B. the offprint is a pre-corrected copy. Please get in touch if you would like a 'clean' copy. In this chapter, I complicate the image of women religious as either authoritative and agentive or submissive and oppressed, with reference to the relationships between royal women, the papacy, and the Franciscan order in Bohemia and the Polish duchies. Using the thirteenth- and early fourteenth-century evidence for these relationships, I argue that situating discussion of women’s spiritual authority within the confessor-penitent dynamic and increased role of the papacy in the lives of women religious post Lateran IV allows us to see women exercise spiritual authority even as they perform submission to male superiors. In doing so, I also begin to draw out where the women under examination may have unconsciously reinforced mechanisms for their own oppression through participating in performances of submission that were central to their own spiritual vocation. Finally, in the context of histories of the Franciscan order(s), I use this discussion to query the entrenched myth of defiance of papal authority as a quality inherent to an ‘authentic’ Franciscan identity.\n\nThis paper proposes a new line of analysis of the rich body of medieval Serbian royal hagiography. It suggests that this hagiographical tradition is not so much a strategy of rationalizing the Serbian past, particularly the history of the Nemanjići dynasty (in power from the third quarter of the twelfth century to the third quarter of the fourteenth), and the creation of a primarily intellectual ideological framework for the sake of the dynasty’s legitimacy, as it is the textual reflection of the real practice of royal power in the medieval heartland of Serbia. The sanctification of the lineage, the commemoration of the royal dead, and the foundation of numerous pious institutions in the mountainous region immediately to the north and west of the old Christian center of Ras (present-day Novi Pazar) in fact constructed the space of Nemanjić Serbia, and provided it with a nucleus where the overlapping of their private patrimony and the public authority they held did not allow competition. This nucleus would remain the backbone of the dynasty well after the expansion of the kingdom towards the plains of the northeast, the Adriatic coast to the west and the Byzantine and Bulgarian dominions to the south and southeast. Piety and property were intrinsically associated and offered the basis for power.\n\nThe time frame of the paper is the period approximately from the tenth to the twelfth century and it focuses on the Baltic Slavic principality centred on Rügen Island. Particularly on the development of a peculiar political system there. On one hand, the people of Rügen, called the Ranove retained an old institution of a tribal assembly, called in Slavic veche, despite emerging local elites and upper class. A common development among many mediaeval Slavic principalities. On the other, however, the most unique characteristics of their political system was the very prominent role of the pagan priesthood , revolving around a pagan deity known as Sventovit. The paper demonstrates that the Rügen Island the pagan priests were clearly a dominant political force, and in fact they were the real rulers of the principality. Therefore prior to the Danish conquest in 1168 the system can be described as a theocracy. This finding challenges the commonly accepted notion that Rugian priesthood played a much less prominent role and was the same footing the tribal assembly and local elite or \" princes \". Introduction In the year 1168 Danish forces led by king Waldemar I and bishop Absalon ransacked a stronghold of Arkona on Rügen Island, destroyed a pagan centre there, and subjugated the island's Slavic population, known as the Ranove. This event marked the end of the independent existence of pagan Slavic polities between the Oder and Elbe-Saale rivers. This paper explores the political development among the Ranove, between the tenth and twelfth centuries, focusing on the period prior to their foreign subjugation in 1168 and their subsequent Christianisation. In this period, the major political players in the principality appeared to be the pagan priesthood; the tribal assembly – veche; and the emerging tribal aristocracy and local \" princely \" family. This article aims to demonstrate that the dominant decision making force in Rugian politics was a pagan priesthood and in fact the political system of principality was theocracy-like. The paper is based mainly upon written sources with other material such as archaeological finds serving a supportive or explanatory role."
