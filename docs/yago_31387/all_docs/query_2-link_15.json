Just a little bibliographical correction: it's \"Cheynet\"\n\nand not \"Cheynette\". And Andronikos Palaiologos given (correctly) as a son\n\nin law of Alexios (son of Geôrgios the megas hetaireiarches) is not the same\n\nwith Andronikos \"gambros\" of Isaak II: the first one was barrely born when\n\nthe second one died. Also, J.-F. Vannier want back on the question of Aspaè\n\nin an article (\"Notes généalogiques byzantino-géorgiennes\") published in\n\n\"Eupsychia [This word in Greek fonts]. Mélanges offerts à Hélène\n\nAhrweiller\", II, Paris 1998.\n\nHis hypothesis is very convincing of course, but that is not for that that\n\nGeôrgios Palaiologos had only one wife. So, I think it is more prudent to\n\nconsider that Geôrgios Palaiologos' children are from an unknown mother.\n\nNow to the question of Andronikos the \"gambros\": my basic reason to think he\n\nwas married to a relative of Isaak II, and not the reverse, is the son I\n\ngive to him. I think that, if he was a son of Geôrgios the megas\n\nhetaireiarches, and since his (supposed) brother had probably no son, then\n\nfor anthroponimical reasons he must be the father of an other Geôrgios,\n\nattested in the last years of the 12th century.\n\nThen, this Geôrgios took part in the plot against Isaak II: speaking of the\n\nconspirators, among which this Geôrgios, Nikètas Choniatès says that they\n\nwere all \"related by blood to the emperor\" (\"kata genos tô basilei\n\nsunaptomenoi\"). I am not a scholar in Choniatès, but I would be surprise if\n\nhe considered as a parentage \"kata genos\", \"by the race\", the fact to be the\n\nson of the brother of a previous wife. On the other hand, if Andronikos was\n\nmarried to a relative of Isaak II (probably a cousin), and if, as I suspect,\n\nGeôrgios was the son of this marriage, to describe him as a relative \"kata\n\ngenos\" suits better. And so, Hiestand notwithstanding, I don't think Isaak\n\nII was never married with a Palaiologina. But perhaps I am wrong and \"kata\n\ngenos\" can have a broder meaning in Choniatès and can refer to a parentage\n\nwhich is not really by blood: only a specialist of Choniatès vocabulary can\n\nanswer this question.\n\nI would be happy to have your opinion on my opinion.\n\nPierre\n\n\"George Tsambourakis\" <eac...@ozemail.com.au> a écrit dans le message de\n\nnews: 37x8a.51$PO6....@nnrp1.ozemail.com.au...\n\n> > > Since \"gambros\" can perfectly specify a by-marriage relationship\n\nmore\n\n> > > distant than \"brother-in-law\" or \"son-in-law\".\n\n>\n\n> It is always amusing to read French Interpretations of the Greek Language.\n\n> It appears that nobody asks Greeks what they mean when they use words\n\n> like Gambros.\n\n> Nobody asked me, but I am going to tell you anyway,\n\n> with the hope somebody may actually listen.\n\n>\n\n> For the family of the BRIDE, GAMBROS is the new Husband.\n\n> That means the NEW HUSBAND is GAMBROS to FATHER, MOTHER, BROTHERS and\n\n> SISTERS\n\nSo, in other words, it can mean \"son-in-law\" or \"brother-in-law\", which is\n\nwhat we already knew.

Again, I will lost my time to answer you.\n\nThe question is not what are the words used today in Greek, but what were\n\nthe words used in the Byzantine time, and the sense the words had at that\n\ntime, which is not necessarily the same sense that the same words can have\n\ntoday.\n\nFor what is of \"gambros\", it was not limited in that time to the son-in-law\n\nor the brother-in-law. To quote a famous example (between many others),\n\nAndronikos III called Iôannčs Kantakouzčnos (later emperor John VI) his\n\n\"gambros\" because Kantakouzčnos was married to Eirčnč Palaiologina Asanina,\n\nwhose father was a cousin of Andronikos' father, so a rather distant\n\nrelationship. Of course, Kantakouzčnos was not the emperor's son-in-law or\n\nbrother-in-law (but perhaps Dr Tsambourakis will argue the contrary...). The\n\nword was sufficiently ambiguous to be sometimes completed: for example, I\n\nrecord a reference to Michačl Taronitčs, brother-in-law of Alexios I, as\n\ngambros \"ep' adelphč\" (\"by the sister\"), which makes the word more explicit.\n\nOther words are simply no more in use. For example, you don't use today\n\n\"gunaichomaimos\" to say brother-in-law (or to say anything other in fact),\n\nand nevertheless I quote above a passage of Choniatčs, an authentic\n\nGreek-speaker of the 12th century who used this word in that sense. On the\n\nother hand, the words \"kouniados\", which you mentioned and which means today\n\nbrother-in-law, and \"kouniada\" (sister-in-law) are simply not Greek words:\n\nthese are Italian words (\"cognato\", \"cognata\"), adopted in modern times by\n\nthe Greek language (which, according to you, never changed since the time of\n\nChrist). As such, they were obviously not used in the time of Nikčtas\n\nChoniatčs (probably, he would have been desperate to know that some day the\n\nGreeks would adopt such Barbarian words to express their familial\n\nrelationships).\n\nPierre\n\n\"Igor Sklar\" <skla...@yandex.ru> a écrit dans le message de news:\n\n5a635d65.03030...@posting.google.com...\n\n> \"Pierre Aronax\" <pierre...@hotmail.com> wrote in message\n\nnews:<3e627336$0$3824$79c1...@nan-newsreader-02.noos.net>...\n\n>\n\n> > Could you indicate the identity of the Russian prince who is supposed to\n\n> > have wedded in the Palaiogos family (if of course it was more than a\n\n> > rhetorical way to speak)?

John VIII Palaiologos married with\n\na daughter of a great prince of Moscow, so he was certainly not considered\n\n\"unequall\", and the Rurikids would have been very happy to have obtained an\n\nimperial princess for their wife.

As for logic - there is logic\n\nhere, but you should look at exact circumstanses of these specific\n\nmarriages, not engage in generalizations.\n\nStart with Vsevolod. Note that he married BEFORE murder of Andrey. By that\n\ntime he was more or less a nobody - a very minor princeling without his own\n\ndomain and almost without any prospects of advancement. Why would King of\n\nOsetia want to marry off his daughter to such a minor figure is sich faraway\n\nland ? Was there a shortage of nobodies in Osetia ? Well, I won't claim that\n\nthis is absolutely impossible, if we knew that this indeed happened some\n\nexplanation could be found. But we know only that Vsevolod's wife was of\n\nOsetian nationality, and I see no reason to suggest that she must be king's\n\ndaughter.\n\nNow about Yaroslav and Mstislav. In both cases chronists stress that their\n\nwife was \"svest\" (sister-in-law) of Vsevolod. So the relationship of these\n\ngirls to Vsevolod made them desirable brides, not their ancestry. Yaroslav\n\n(himself a nobody) based his entire political career on this relationship,\n\nand marriage of Mstislav was part of a peace settlement between his father\n\nand Vsevolod. At that time (late 1170s - early 1180s) Vsevolod had no\n\ndaughters, sisters or nieces of marriageable age, so he had no choice but\n\nto use his wife's relatives on marriage market. Again, the motives of\n\nYaroslav and Mstislav are clear, the motives of Vsevolod are clear, but\n\nwhat interest King of Osetia (assuming that these girls were his daughters)\n\ncould have in these marriages ? Why did he send two more daughters to Russia\n\nand allowed Vsevolod to use them for his (Vsevolod's) advantage ? The story\n\nmakes much more sence if they belonged to a minor family, who unexpectedly\n\nwon a million in marriage lottery and now tried to get out of this relationship\n\nas much as possible.\n\n> > and suggest a Bagratid origin for them is IMHO completely unsupported leap\n\n> > of faith.\n\n>\n\n> What a pity Rafal Prinke is not around!

What they wanted was simply a\n\nprincess of the imperial family. All we can say is that they expected her to\n\nbe a daughter of one of the reigning emperors. This was not an absurd\n\nproject: Basil II had no daughter of course, but his brother had: Zoe was\n\naround ten years old at that time, and Eudokia was older, so perfectly\n\nconvenient for Robert. So your declaration that Hugh ask for his son\n\n\"permission\" to marry \"Anna Porphyrogeneta\" is without any basis.

The\n\ncomplete list of the children of the emperor is known, and there was no\n\nBarbara among them: he had four sons and five daughters (Anna, Maria,\n\nEudokia, Theodôra and Zoč).

I assume that if a\n\nman has only one wife and produces legitimate posterity, this\n\nposterity must issue from this marriage. It could be otherwise in\n\nfact, but until nothing to the contrary is known, we should uphold\n\nthis position. Otherwise it would be impossible to establish any\n\ndescent from Komnenoi of Trapezunt (or any other ancient Eastern\n\ndynasty) at all.\n\nSecondly, there is chronology. If the wife of Mamia was David's\n\nsister, there's all the more reason to believe she was the mother of\n\nKahabar. She was born before 1420 (when Theodora Kantakuzene was not\n\nyet too old to bear children), married Mamia before 1440... and yet\n\nshe was still alive in 1460s. Anyone who has the slightest knowledge\n\nof Georgian history and traditions will agree that a new marriage\n\nsevers all ties with a former wife's family. I don't think it likely\n\nthat Mamia would help relatives of his 1st wife in case he was married\n\nfor the 2nd time (or had not adult posterity by his 1st wife).\n\nConsidering the chronology of previous Gurieli rulers, it's highly\n\nunlikely that Mamia had enough time to produce heir either before the\n\nmarriage with Komnene (he should have been born about 1415) or after\n\nit (he died in 1469). From what we know the most plausible scenario\n\n(by far) is that Kahabar was born soon after the marriage (say before\n\n1445), suceeded his father in 1469, and died in 1483.\n\nThirdly, there is such a thing as family tradition. The Guriely family\n\nhas maintained for a long time that they descend from the Komennoi of\n\nTrapezunt. The Andronikashvili family also for centuries has claimed\n\ndescent from the lateral branch of the imperial Komnenoi, and now we\n\ndo have sources corroborating that some children of Andronikos I (the\n\nDuplo-Komnenoi, so to speak :) spent most of their life in Georgia and\n\nhad posterity there.\n\nFourthly, you admitted today that later kings of Georgia descend from\n\nMega Komnenoi in a female line. Even if Gurian link is insecure, there\n\nare other links that sustain overall validity of this route.\n\nBTW, I'd like to know your opinion concerning the marriage of Emperor\n\nLouis III and Anna of Byzantium. It is said by some to have taken\n\nplace in 905, when Anna was only 7, and yet we know they had a child\n\nsoon after the marriage (Anna died in 16). What is more interesting,\n\npurported granddaughter of Anna (Constance, wife of Boso II) was born\n\nin 920, i.e. when her father (Charles de Vienne) was no more than 15.\n\nYou told me recently that having children at the age of 13 is\n\nsomething extraordinary. It seems like we have several extraordinary\n\nevents piled on top of each other here.\n\nIs a descent from this marriage is more plausible than that from the\n\nGurian one? Are there any proven lines from Makedonioi to modern\n\nEurope at all?\n\nRegards, Igor\n\nskla...@yandex.ru (Igor Sklar) wrote in message news:<5a635d65.03031...@posting.google.com>...\n\n> kalinki...@mail.ru (Andrew S.

No\n\nevidence about any connection between her and Dobronega exists. Only\n\nif 1) Dobronega was daughter of Vladimir and 2) Vladimir's last wife\n\nwas daughter of Kuno, then we can reasonably suggest that Dobronega\n\nwas Kuno's granddaughter. If any of the above fails, forget about it.\n\nBTW we know (from Nestor's \"Chtenie\") that Boris/Roman WAS married.

The real oddity is Yaroslav's choice of names for\n\nhis children: only Greek names for his daughters and only Slavic names\n\nfor his sons. Doesn't it imply that Yaroslav's mother was a Greek and\n\nhis father was a Slav?\n\nThe principal point of this message is to expose double standarts of\n\nsome scholars.\n\nThey tell us with a triumphant look that Anna of Byzantium was married\n\n(or just engaged?) to a Frankish prince, a cousin of Berthe of\n\nTuscany, and this prince must have been (for some obscure reason) her\n\n2nd (!) cousin Louis III. Very well, we also know FOR SURE that\n\nanother Anna of Byzantium was married to Vladimir I.\n\nThey tell us then that Louis III lived with Anna for a year or two\n\n(while we have no record that she ever left Constantinople). Very\n\nwell, we know FOR SURE that Anna Porphyrogeneta lived with Vladimir in\n\nKiev for 23 years.\n\nAs if there was not enough guesswork already, they tell us that Anna\n\n(aged 12 or so) and Louis III had a son, called Charles Constantine,\n\nand his name somehow proves his Byzantine imperial descent. OK, but we\n\nknow FOR SURE that Vladimir's granddaughter was called Anna, obviously\n\njust like her grandmother.\n\nComparing these facts, any sane person would conclude that Yaroslav's\n\ndescent from Anna Porphyrogeneta is more plausible than Charles'\n\ndescent from Anna of Byzantium. And yet every reference accepts\n\nCharles' descent from Leo VI as genuine, and not a single reference\n\nadmits that Yaroslav could be a grandson of Romanos II.\n\nBut we have some other facts. We know FOR SURE that Nestor's\n\nchronology of Yaroslav's life is wrong, because he places Yaroslav's\n\nbirth at 978, and Vladimir's marriage with his mother at 980. We also\n\nknow that Yaroslav gave to his eldest son the Slavic name of Vladimir\n\n(to honour his father), and he gave the Greek name of Anna to his\n\neldest daughter (to honour his mother). Olegs, Igors, Svyatoslavs,\n\nYaroslavs, Igors, Annas are common name for Rurikid princes of\n\nsubsequent generations, but do you know any Rogneda?\n\nThere are several other questions: why Nestor made Yaroslav 10 years\n\nolder than he actually was (this is proven by modern research)? and\n\nwhy he made Rogneda his mother? Answer: because he wrote his work in\n\n1113 for Svyatopolk II and his pro-Scandinavian party as opposed to\n\nthe pro-Byzantine party of Vladimir Monomachos. He knew that Rogneda\n\nwas a Scandinavian, possibly of Yngling descent, so he decided that\n\nYaroslav should be regarded as her son, half-Scandinavian himself. He\n\ndid not mention a Byzantine marriage of Vsevolod I, because this\n\nconnection did not seem illustrious for him; he told us so much about\n\nRogneda's marriage to Vladimir and made her a mother of Yaroslav,\n\nbecause he regarded an Yngling descent of his patron prince as a\n\npinnacle of prestige.\n\nIn other words, Nestor ignored the existence of Anna for the same\n\nreason why he ignored Russian defeats at Constantinople, why he\n\nmanipulated dates of military campaigns, why he tried to represent\n\nRussians as vanquishers of Greeks, etc. Perhaps nobody would deny that\n\nNestor was severely biased: he tried to augment Russian connections\n\nwith Scandinavia and to diminish/conceal all facts of cooperation with\n\nByzantium. Noone believes Nestor's account of Russian campaign of 1043\n\nanymore, and yet everyone thinks his account of Yaroslav's origin is\n\nright. We have a remarkable lack of logic here.\n\nRegards, Igor\n\n> > > Surprisingly all\n\n> > > contemporary and near contemporary sources are completely silent about so\n\n> > > illustrious connection.\n\n> >\n\n> > There are also surprisingly silent about another illustrious\n\n> > connection, that of Leo VI with Louis III, and this connection is\n\n> > generally accepted today as genuine!\n\n>\n\n> Charles Constantine was a very obscure figure and not much is known about\n\n> him at all.

I think you're perfectly aware that\n\nevery Russian in the 11th cent. received a Christian name at baptism,\n\nwhich was a pure formality, important only for ecclesiastic purposes.\n\nNeither Vladimir nor Izyaslav nor Svyatoslav nor Vsevolod nor\n\nVyacheslav nor Igor used their Christian names in everyday life. On\n\nthe other hand, children of Yaroslav's brothers are known by their\n\nChristian names only: Mstislav had a son Eustaphy, and Svyatoslav had\n\na son Ioann. Grandsons of Yaroslav also had merely Christian names,\n\nwith no Slavic equivalent: Roman Svyatoslavich, Davyd Svyatoslavich,\n\nDavyd Igorevich, etc.\n\nAs for Yaroslav's daughters, only Greek names (Anastasia, Anna,\n\nElisaveta) are recorded for them. It suggests that they had no\n\noriginal Slavic names at all. We know much less about daughters of\n\nVladimir, but nevertheless Slavic names were recorded for all of them:\n\nPredslava, Premyslava, Dobronega... We may analize names of Yaroslav's\n\ngranddaughters and great granddaughers too. In the family of Izyaslav,\n\nwith its Polish connections, they were called Slavic names:\n\nVysheslava, Predslava, Sbyslava.

Of course, this explanation can be other than CC\n\nhaving a Byzantine mother, but since we know his father married a Byzantine\n\nprincess (which is not the case for the Scottish kings named case of Charles\n\nConstantine's maternal ascendancy, I have no religion on that and am\n\nConstantine), this is a reasonable explanation. That being said, I never\n\nexamined myself the perfectly ready to consider it as unproven. But there is\n\nat least some anthroponomical oddities which invite to consider this\n\npossibility (even if, after consideration, it happens to be impossible). For\n\nwhat I have understand (since I don't have any knowledge on the subject),\n\nfor Yaroslav's maternal ascendancy, , we have a mother given to him by an\n\nauthorized source (since, even if Nestor made an error, he is more likely to\n\nhave made it on Yaroslav's age than on his mother's identity), and we have\n\nno particularly disturbing anthroponomical elements to make it suspect\n\n(since the Greek names of his daughters seems perfectly explicable for\n\nreligious motives).\n\nPierre\n\n> > Charles Constantine was a very obscure figure and not much is known about\n\n> > him at all.

But even if Nestor's evaluation\n\nof Yaroslav's age is wrong (I have no problem with it), it is a huge and\n\ncompletely unsupported leap to jump from \"somewhat younger\" to \"at least 10\n\nyears or more younger\".\n\n> > > In this case he could\n\n> > > be the 1st child of Vladimir and Anna.\n\n> >\n\n> > As all existing sources explicitely call him a son by Rogneda, this\n\n> > remains a pure demagogy.\n\n>\n\n> I don't know what you call 'all sources', but it seems like these\n\n> sources were heavily dependant from Nestor.\n\nSimple.

On the other hand, Anna was at least 25.\n\nOf course, finally Robert married little time later a woman who was some 15\n\nyears older than him, so much more than Anna, but this was for imperative\n\nstrategic reasons. As I said, I don't know and I'm not sure King Hugh had\n\nany particular daughter in mind when he wrote his letter, but what is sure\n\nis that what he asked for was a daughter of one of the reigning emperors, a\n\n\"filia sancti imperii\" (\"a daughter of the holy empire\", the Byzantine\n\nemperors calling themselves in their acts \"My Empire\", \"hè Basileia mou\",\n\nsomething like \"Our Majesty\"). Precisely, we know the older daughter of\n\nConstantine was only four years younger than Robert, perhaps less, when her\n\naunt was 15 years older than him, perhaps more: so, who was the most\n\nsuitable wife for the young King? I think that, if the imperial court had\n\nsuggested a marriage with Anna, the Frankish court will have politely\n\ndismissed it: why bother to accept a wife with a so great difference of age,\n\nwhen there was no political gain to hope? The only purpose of this projected\n\nunion was to find for Robert a wife with suitable ancestry to give him\n\nchildren.\n\nAnyway, it seems Hugh didn't even wait an answer from Constantinople before\n\nbeing compeled by his fragile position to marry his son with a much more\n\nolder wife, but with an immediate political advantage: control over the\n\ncounty of Flanders. The purpose of this marriage was to strengthen the\n\nsituation of the dynasty, and not, as the planned Byzantine marriage, to\n\ngive a posterity to Robert: so, some three years latter, Robert repudiated\n\nhis wife \"because she was too old\", as wrote Richer.\n\nPierre\n\nkalinki...@mail.ru (Andrew S.

You know that Vladimir and Yaroslav did\n\nthat, and for the same reason too: because they had no rights to\n\nsuccession. Otherwise I can't see any reason in killing Boris and Gleb\n\n(if Yaroslav was not a homicidal maniac, of course).\n\n> > The first child of Vladimir and Rogneda was Izyaslav.

Having decided to kill Vladimir, Rogneda asked\n\nIzyaslav to take an axe and expect his appearance near the door, etc.\n\nThe story is a fable. But archaelogists tell us that the fort of\n\nIzyaslavl (Zaslavl) was founded at the end of the 10th cent., that\n\nPolotsk was really burnt down at that time, and had to be renovated on\n\nother spot, etc.\n\nThe date of Rogneda's divorce is accepted by most scholars, but I\n\ndon't know what is the evidence behind it. One thing I'm sure of, is\n\nthat Rogneda couldn't be the mother of Yaroslav. In 988, when Rus was\n\nchristened and Yaroslav was born, she had been living with her eldest\n\nson in Izyaslavl for several years. I'm not sure who Yaroslav's mother\n\nwas, but definitely not Rogneda: this is impossible chronologically.\n\n> > When Izyaslav died in\n\n> > 1001, he left several heirs; Yaroslav had not been even married by\n\n> > that time.\n\n>\n\n> And now you know the date of Yaroslav's marriage.

The 1st wife of Yaroslav (presumably named\n\nAnna) died in 1018/19. (She is last mentioned by Titmar under\n\n14-August-1018, when she was imprisoned by Boleslaw; a year later\n\nYaroslav married Ingigerd.) The analysis of Anna's bones testified\n\nthat they belong to a woman of 30-35 years, i.e. she was born about\n\n988. I think that marriage before the age of 13 is quite implausible\n\n(though not out of question), that's why Yaroslav was not married in\n\n1001.\n\n> > Mstislav was also elder than Yaroslav.\n\n>\n\n> And he said to Yaroslav: \"You are the elder brother\".

Though we can make no solid conclusions by chronology in\n\nthis case, it's quite suggestive that Mstislav predeceased Yaroslav by\n\n18 years, and he had an adult son who was elder than Yaroslav's\n\nchildren (died in 1032). Otherwise, why did he send murderers to a\n\nyounger brother who couldn't be a potential claimant to the throne?\n\n> > The latter tried hard to dispose of him, but\n\n> > was unsuccessful.

And where exactly you saw this statement?\n\nWhat about the word 'Novegorode'? With it this has totally different\n\nmeaning - Yaroslav was in Novgorod for 28 years. Then it say nothing\n\nabout his age at all.\n\nAnd to make things worse, there are variants with the numbers 18 or 38,\n\ninstead of 28.\n\n> > But even if this was true, he won't be son of Anne anyway.\n\n>\n\n> I'd be grateful for any arguments to support this statement (if it's\n\n> not a pure demagogy of course).\n\nThis is simple. To be born in 988, Yaroslav should be conceived in 987\n\n(or in the very first months of 988 at the latest).

The story says that divorced Rogneda built a fort\n\ncalled Izyaslavl (Polotsk was still in ruins) to live here with her\n\nson. Archaeologists confirm that Izyaslavl (i.e., city of Izyaslav)\n\nwas founded at that time.

There\n\nis such minor detail that his work didn't survive. Of course this won't\n\nstop you, but alas, everyone else can read only much later chronicles\n\n(Laurentian, Ipatievan, Radziwill etc.) that incorporate the text of\n\nNestor's work, and even this not in original form, but from one of the\n\ntwo revisions compiled during Monomakh's reign.\n\n> > What about the word 'Novegorode'?\n\n>\n\n> The last letter added by scribes who could not understand Nestor's\n\n> meaning when he gives 3 different dates of Yaroslav's birth.\n\nHow simple.

A prince of Novgorod?\n\nFirst, if we ignore any evidence that doesn't fit, as you do, we can easily\n\nmake a scenario where this will be correct. In fact we will even need to\n\ntwist much less facts than in your scenario, because we don't know neither\n\ndate of Vysheslav's date, nor exact foundation date of Yaroslavl.\n\nSecond, even if this particular statement is erroneous (it probably is),\n\nthis doesn't prove that Nestor didn't write it.\n\n> > And to make things worse, there are variants with the numbers 18 or 38,\n\n> > instead of 28.\n\n>\n\n> Never heard about it.

Svyatoslav first didn't want ot send anyone to Novgorod at all.\n\nWhen Novgorodians pressed the case, he send them the son about whom he\n\ncared very little. Vladimir first gave Novgorod to Vysheslav, his eldest\n\nson, but after his death - to Yaroslav, who certainly wasn't the eldest\n\n(and according to your fantasies was one of the youngest, but somehow you\n\ndon't see the contradiction between your statements).

Svyatoslav was succeded by his all\n\nthree sons, who were totally independent in their domains and fought\n\neach other until Vladimir gained victory and got all. Vladimir again\n\nwas \"succeeded\" by all his sons who were alive and had some reasonable\n\nforce at their disposal (Boris, Svyatopolk"
