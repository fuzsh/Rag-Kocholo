My response at the time was to wonder if I had anything new to say, so I told her I’d be happy to speak, but that I hoped she wasn’t planning a publication. Well, not only was she able to convince me to push my research further (and to write the chapter included here), she was also able to convince me to join her as co-editor of the volume. Indeed, it was the unique, persuasive powers and diligence of Marianne that brought this volume into being. As the other contributors will attest, none of us was able to say no when confronted by her infectious enthusiasm. Alas, Marianne did not live to see Piroska and the Pantokrator in print, and one of her final requests of her friends was to see the volume through publication when she was no longer able to do so herself. It is thus our hope that this collection of essays will stand as a lasting tribute to our colleague and friend, Marianne Sághy. It was an honor and a pleasure to collaborate with her on this, her final scholarly project. May her memory endure.\n\nPiroska 00 book.indb 11\n\nRobert G.

The nine-hundred-yearold building—the second largest Byzantine religious edifice after Hagia Sophia still standing in Istanbul—represents the most remarkable architectural and the most ambitious social project of the Komnenian dynasty. Scholarship on the Pantokrator is vast. This volume—as its title and cover picture show—, approaches the Pantokrator from a special vantage point focusing on its co-founder, Empress Piroska-Eirene of Hungary. This particular perspective enables its authors to explore not only the architecture, the monastic and medical functions of the complex, but also Hungarian-Byzantine relations, the cultural and religious history of early medieval Hungary, imperial representation, personal faith and dynastic holiness. When I first visited Istanbul in 2014, I was thrilled not only by the artistic brilliance of the Komnenos mosaic panel and its prominent position in Hagia Sophia, but also by the fact that I stood face to face with a compatriot—the only Hungarian woman from the Middle Ages whose features are known from a portrait made during her life. Despite its idealized character, it is a life-like representation of a flesh-and-blood woman, a fertile wife, a loving mother, a faithful devotee of the Holy Mother of God, a charitable and ambitious founder. Standing before the sole Byzantine empress sailing from Hungary, I had the feeling that I could speak to her and she would respond to me. I sadly noticed, however, that Piroska-Eirene was hardly more in the Hagia Sophia than a museum-shop ad for visitors, unaware of her life and ignorant of her celebrated foundation, the Pantokrator Monastery just a couple of miles away. The situation cried for remedy. Without further ado, I set upon organizing an international colloquy at the Central European University in Budapest in June 2015 with\n\nPiroska 00 book.indb 1\n\n2019.09.04. 15:22\n\n2\n\nMarianne Sághy\n\na packed program thanks to the scholars and institutions who responded to the call. At our meeting, we discussed Piroska’s life, achievements and memory in early Árpádian Hungary and Komnenian Byzantium in the context of women and power, monastic foundations, architectural innovations, and spiritual models. This volume represents the rich crop of the Budapest conference, complemented with the papers of those scholars who were unable to attend. The first scholarly work on the Pantokrator Monastery was inspired by motives not entirely unlike mine. Hungarian Byzantinist Gyula Moravcsik’s interest in writing his Saint Ladislas’s daughter and the Pantokrator Monastery in Byzantium in the early 1920’s1 was kindled by the idea to collect source evidence relevant to Hungarian history in Constantinople.2 Prisoner of war on the Russian front in 1918, Moravcsik could not assume his fellowship at the Hungarian Research Institute in Constantinople, soon to be swept away in the whirlwind of the collapse of empires. Thus, Moravcsik had not yet visited Constantinople and Piroska at the time of his writing the first systematic collection of Byzantine, Latin and Ottoman evidence about the Pantokrator complex. Although the Hungarian Research Institute in Constantinople ceased to exist in 1918, its series continued to be published for a few years in Budapest. The next volume scheduled by the editors after Moravcsik’s work was the architectural description of the Pantokrator/Zeyrek Camii by Moravcsik, Szent László leánya és a bizánci Pantokrator-monostor. Die Tochter Ladislaus des Heiligen und das Pantokrator-Kloster in Konstantinopel.

Only two years after the Compromise with the Hungarians in 1967, the emperor offered the codices to the National Széchényi Library of Hungary. In 1877, Sultan Abdul Hamid gave back 35 codices to Hungary, among them 14 Corvinas, taken from Hungary during the Ottoman conquest: see Béla Erődi, Csok jasa!

Between 1877–1918, Hungarian historians sought to recover documents and objects of Hungarian provenience—codices from the royal library of Buda, decorative elements, such as the two Renaissance bronze candlesticks from the Assumption of the Holy Virgin parish church of Buda now in the Hagia Sophia, records and of archbishoprics and bishoprics—in the Ottoman Empire, particularly in the archives of Topkapı Sarayı, along with the memory of famous Hungarian immigrants in the Ottoman Empire from Imre Thököly, Ilona Zrínyi and Ferenc II Rákóczi prince of Transylvania to Lajos Kossuth. After WWI, research expanded to the common Turkic heritage of Turks and Hungarians, hallmarked by Béla Bartók’s collection of folk music in Anatolia: see János Sipos, In the Wake of Bartók in Anatolia.

Unfortunately, Luttor’s work has never seen the light.4 In 2013, Géza Nagymihályi, Greek-Catholic priest and art historian, published a life of Saint Piroska written for a wide audience, aiming to promote her cult as well as the knowledge of Byzantine spirituality and culture in Hungary.5 International scholarly interest in the Pantokrator was triggered by Paul Gautier’s critical edition of its Typikon,6 and even more urgently, by the restoration work carried out in the building in Istanbul’s Fatih district. Chapters in Nevra Necipoğlu’s Byzantine Constantinople address the architecture and the restoration of the Pantokrator,7 while the volume edited by Sofia Kotzabassi on the Pantokrator demonstrates the key role of the complex throughout the Byzantine centuries8 and publishes, among other important texts, a critical edition of the two versions of the synaxarion,9 along with its English translation by Paul Magdalino,10 as well as Luttor, A római Via Nomentana-i Szent Ágnes Egyház.

Pastor in Balatonfüred between 1918–1929, where he built a large church in Neo-Romanesque style, Luttor worked as a canon law expert at the Embassy of Hungary to the Holy See between 1929–1944. In 1948, at the time of the Communist takeover in Hungary, he emigrated to Argentina and died in Plátanos in 1953.

Our volume expands the horizon of research on the Pantokrator by including new issues into the discussion, such as Piroska’s Hungarian cultural and spiritual inheritance, Hungarian–Byzantine relations, the power of empresses, imperial monastic foundations in Constantinople, the joining of secular and spiritual power, the construction of dynastic holiness. The purpose of the book is not to enhance Empress Piroska-Eirene’s Hungarian origins, but rather to contextualize her within the international perspectives of the Árpád dynasty in the eleventh–twelfth century in which the union of the Greek and Latin empires and Greek and Latin churches was regarded as a feasible political option. The very dedication of the Pantokrator Monastery with its allusion to Christ “the Ruler of All,” evokes the notion of “universal domination,” one of the key terms of the restoration of the Roman Empire (renovatio imperii). Through her father and mother, Piroska united in her person the powers of the West—in the words of Theodoros Prodromos, she ruled all nations and was feared by Germans, Dalmatians, Lombards, Genoans, Africans, Huns and Pannonians. “Ruling over the nations” was an idea endorsed by King Stephen of Hungary, who advocated the advantages of multiethnic societies: the Kingdom of Hungary was not for Magyars alone, but operated as a transnational state, adopting an ideology cherished by steppe nomads and empires alike. Piroska’s wedding with John Komnenos came to be perceived as a union of East and West, with cosmic connotations: for Prodromos, it was the marriage of the Sun and the Moon.12 Apart from political traditions in connection with the restoration of the Roman Empire, Piroska also brought with herself a heritage of dynastic holiness through elevations on the altar “within the family,” a trademark of the House of Árpád, as well as a spiritual legacy of religious foundations and religious munificence. The cult of the Mother of God was second only to Byzantium in Hungary, where the Virgin Mary guaranteed the political independence of the kingdom between two empires. Piroska is an excellent “trigger” for re-thinking hypotheses not only about early medieval Hungary, where historical documents are notoriously scarce or incomplete, but also about Komnenian Byzantium, with important, but 11 Ioannis\n\nVassis, “Das Pantokratorkloster von Konstantinopel in der Byzantinischen Dichtung.” In: op. cit., 203–250. 12 Patrologia Graeca 133, 1340–1342.

Thus, for example, it is possible to revise the paradigm that opposes East and West in the twelfth century and argue that Hungary was not a country “in between” East and West, but sought to unite East and West—at least within the confines of the country. Our volume contextualizes Empress Eirene within Byzantine society as well. How did she fit into the highly competitive Komnenian court? How did she exploit traditions of pious giving, a domain reserved for, and appropriated by, Byzantine empresses? How did her image and perception change in the court over her reign? The authors of our volume present significant paradigm shifts concerning the power of Byzantine empresses in general and the representation of Piroska-Eirene in particular. Equal partner in the design of an innovative structure of spirituality and healing, her great foundation, the Pantokrator Monastery became, after Eirene’s canonization in 1166, a shrine of the “sainted ruler,” a new concept in political theology. If Piroska-Eirene’s image changed, so did the plan of the Pantokrator Monastery. Our collection presents the transformation of the building, during the lifetime of its founders, from its religious core into a monument of Komnenian piety and victory, from a monastery into a multifunctional medical and social complex. The papers examine the Pantokrator in comparison not only with other imperial monastic foundations, but also with the mausolea of the very founders of Constantinople, Emperors Constantine and Justinian that the heroon of the Komnenoi consciously sought to echo not only in its denomination, but also visually on the city skyline. Yet the Christ Pantokrator and the Theotokos Eleousa churches were not meant only to resurrect or resonate the past, their beautiful icons, refulgent treasures, and dazzling decoration started a new phase of artistic brilliance and exercised a huge impact on the art in Byzantium and beyond. The chapters of the volume are richly illustrated with photographs not only of the Pantokrator Monastery/Zeyrek Camii, but also of the icons, charters, books, seals, gospel books and mosaic portraits relevant to the architecture of early Árpádian Hungary and the representation of Empress Eirene. The collection starts with three contributions addressing the problem of Byzantine culture in Hungary and Byzantine–Hungarian relations. My paper on Greek Monasteries in Early Árpádian Hungary aims to reconstruct the cultural and spiritual background of young Piroska in Hungary. Focusing on what we know of the Greek monasteries in eleventh–twelfth-century Hungary, particularly on the Veszprémvölgy Greek nunnery, I summarize a century of scholarship and debate about Byzantine monastic and ecclesiastical structures in the Árpádian kingdom. I aim to show that the princess grew up in a kingdom that benefited from, and continued to promote the idea of the restoration of the Roman Empire and where an unprecedented spiritual aggiornamento and a remarkable cultural boom took place\n\nPiroska 00 book.indb 5\n\n2019.09.04. 15:22\n\n6\n\nMarianne Sághy\n\nthat combined the best of Byzantine and Latin spirituality. No “country bumpkin” from the margins of Byzantium, no foreigner to Greek culture, Piroska carried an impressive cultural baggage upon her arrival in Constantinople—not least with regard to monastic spirituality and dynastic holiness. It was her ward, King Coloman the Learned who promoted the cult of King Stephen by commissioning Bishop Hartvic to write a new Life of Saint Stephen that enhanced Stephen’s role as apostle of Hungary, as a munificent benefactor and founder of churches and monasteries at home and hospices in the three holy cities of Christendom, Jerusalem, Rome and Constantinople. Béla Zsolt Szakács’s contribution entitled What did Piroska see at home? New Trends in Art and Architecture in the Kingdom of Hungary around 1100 presents the extraordinary flourish of the arts under the reign of King Coloman at the turn of eleventh–twelfth century. Cathedrals and monastic churches were rebuilt, the new Romanesque style was adapted in architecture, sculpture and the decorative arts, innovative fresco cycles were painted on church walls, and new royal insignia were created—Szakács thus argues for the early twelfth-century creation of the Holy Crown of Hungary. Even if we cannot tell of what Piroska noticed of the artistic boom, it is unlikely that Coloman’s vast Christian culture, European perspective, and his running monumental projects did not have an influence on the young princess’s mind. Szakács discusses archaic and new Byzantinizing stylistic elements that permeated visual culture, but suggests that they reached Hungary from Italy rather than from Constantinople. Attila Bárány revisits Diplomatic relations between Hungary and Byzantium in the Eleventh–Twelfth Century and takes issue with earlier scholarship that interpreted King Coloman’s marriage to Felicia, the daughter of Count Roger of Sicily in 1097 as an anti-Byzantine move. Emphasizing the importance of the Hungarian alliance to Byzantium at the time of the Norman invasion led by Bohemond of Taranto, Bárány substantiates Coloman’s continuing support of Byzantium with the Hungarian signatories to the peace of Devol. Bárány remains cautious in accepting at face value chroniclers’ references to a Hungarian foray into Apulia, even if it seems certain that Hungarians did participate in an attack on Bohemond with the help of Venetian ships. Michael Jeffreys’s essay surveys the satisfactions and the anxiety of Komnenian dynasty-making from male and female viewpoints. Thanks to three consecutive fecund imperial women who produced families with eight or more children, the Komnenoi bred a new ruling class for the Empire. Fecundity, however, run out in the third generation: a curse placed on Empress Bertha-Eirene’s womb by an angry deposed patriarch increased dynastic anxiety for Emperor Manuel who had to wait twenty-three years for a male heir. In the meantime, Manuel found a bridegroom for\n\nPiroska 00 book.indb 6\n\n2019.09.04. 15:22\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nhis daughter from the Árpád dynasty, Béla-Alexios, whom he raised as a prospective heir. Piroska-Eirene was a model dynasty-maker and her marriage a diplomatic success that lasted up to his son’s reign. Jeffreys assesses Byzantine expectations about Princess Piroska—her role as an empress; her public persona in the city; the political importance of her marriage to Hungary and Byzantium; her role in the foundation of the Pantokrator—, and highlights the mutual affection that bound the imperial couple. Roberta Franchi’s Komnenian Empresses: From Powerful to Pious Mothers presents the transformation of female power during the Komnenian century. In the late eleventh century, ambitious mothers acted as kingmakers, founders of monastic institutions, and literary patronesses. Female influence behind the throne, however, was short-lived. Franchi argues that the coming of foreign brides reflects the conspicuous transformation of the empress’s role in Byzantium from powerful mother to pious wife. In his paper on Piroska-Eirene, the First Byzantine Empress from the West: Power and Perception Maximilian Lau follows up Piroska’s progress in the perception and ideology of the Komnenian court, her changing image from a marginal entity to the “Lady of all the West.” The first Westerner to become a Byzantine empress, the Hungarian princess was welcomed in Constantinople with calculated, cold silence: neither court records, nor Anna Komnene mention her marriage, and the only poem that refers to her suggests that she should fast “forget her kin.” In contrast, upon her death, Empress Eirene is extolled for her “blessed forefathers,” starting with Julius Caesar. The empress’s ancestry meant to bolster the imperial rhetoric of John’s regime, showing that John and Eirene unite the Eastern and Western Empires. Far from her ancestry being an embarrassment to be forgotten, subsumed by a superior, Roman, identity, Lau argues that it became a significant contribution to portrayal of the legitimacy and universality of Komnenian rule. The paradigm shift, along with her role strongly emphasized in the foundation of the Pantokrator Monastery makes a convincing case that Eirene cannot be dismissed as simply devoting herself to philanthropy and raising children. Christopher Mielke’s The Many Faces of Piroska-Eirene in Visual and Material Culture inquires about the extent to which Empress Eirene was able to control and define her image in Byzantium. He discusses seals, coins, a mosaic, an enamel plaque, and images in illuminated manuscripts connected to Empress Eirene in the past. Mielke assesses which connections can be valid, and which pieces can tell us about the empress’s own agency in the construction of her visual program. Elif Demirtiken’s paper on Imperial Women and Religious Foundations in Constantinople focuses on imperial women’s monumental patronage. Empresses—be they married, unmarried or dowager; Constantinopolitan, provincial or foreign— had an urge to build in the capital to show their power, to construct their repre-\n\nPiroska 00 book.indb 7\n\n2019.09.04. 15:22\n\n8\n\nMarianne Sághy\n\nsentation, and also to build a place for themselves where to retire in times of hardship. Demirtiken shows that over the five hundred years over the five-hundred years of the Middle Byzantine period, the object of imperial philanthropy shifted from churches to monasteries, possibly because of the latter’s multifunctional character. Not only was a monastery capable of accommodating a variety of functions—residence, commemoration, burial—but all these revolved around the concept of the family, echoing the Komnenian take on dynasty and kinship networks. Eirene was the only foreign-born empress with an outstanding family record of impressive religious patronage: King Stephen of Hungary, whose munificence embraced Constantinople as well, might also have been a model for her. The Pantokrator was seen by Byzantine contemporaries not only as a celebration of piety, but also of victory, a cross between manly virtue and feminine piety. Robert Ousterhout analyzes the “stereo effect” of the female and male references in the textual and material sources and in the symbolic conception of the structure. Surveying the architectural evidence from the South to the North Church, from floor to dome, he argues that the real significance of the Pantokrator consisted in its complexity. Over the eighteen years of its construction, the project was transformed from a single monumental block to a sprawling irregular complex, from a monastic katholikon to a multi-functional church cluster. Changes in the design parallel with construction work demonstrate that the imperial couple experimented with something new, determined to create an innovative structure formally, functionally, and symbolically. Despite the ongoing changes, the building preserved its stylistic unity. The first monastery to include a separate mausoleum, the Pantokrator’s heroon consciously harked back to the mausolea of Constantine and Justinian at the nearby Basilica of the Holy Apostles. If Emperor John II intended it as a victory monument, however, over time, the piety of the empress, the concept of the sainted ruler, and the cult of Saint Eirene prevailed in the Pantokrator. The Life of Saint Eirene highlights that “[Piroska-Eirene] erected the beautiful churches that can be seen there now, hostels and old-age homes, all of which in beauty, situ­ation and construction technique take first place among all previous buildings, both old and recent.” Analysing the Medical and Charitable Institutions in the Pantokrator Monastery, Tyler Wolford enhances the uniqueness of the medical and social care in the complex closely linked to the uniqueness of the source of all knowledge about the hospital, namely the typikon of the Pantokrator. As evidence about the actual functioning of the medical institutions is lacking, the scholarly interpretation of the typikon oscillates between “never realized ideal” to “the pinnacle of medieval medicine.” Piroska-Eirene’s hospital was an elite institution, only imaginable in Constantinople. Its functioning is attested for less than sixty-eight years between 1136–1204. Its demise was due to its far too expensive maintenance\n\nPiroska 00 book.indb 8\n\n2019.09.04. 15:22\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nas well as to the inability of Manuel Komnenos to repair the aqueduct systems of the capital, as healing was closely connected with water in Constantinople. Etele Kiss’s paper on Piroska-Eirene and the Holy Theotokos suggests that Piroska-Eirene studiously kept her life private because it was a life lived in imitation of the Virgin Mary. Presenting the intensely emotional Marian devotion in twelfth-century Christianity and the extraordinary political theology centered on the Mother of God in Hungary and Byzantium, the two countries enjoying her special protection, the author argues that Piroska’s Marian spirituality shaped her vocation, drive and personality. Kiss links extant, dispersed, or lost artworks to the empress’s spirituality, showing that Christian ideals formed not only Piroska’s identity, but also Eirene’s imperial image in Constantinople, where she associated herself with the Theotokos and had herself represented as re-enacting the virtues of the Mother of God. Roman Shlyakhtin compares Nicholas Kallikles’s and Theodore Prodromos’s epitaphs on Empress Eirene. Both emphasize the empress’s impressive combination of earthly power with Christian virtue, yet the end result is very different. Drawing on the Song of Songs, Kallikles paints an intimate portrait of Eirene, the loving mother, while Prodromos celebrates the empress as the equal partner of her husband and partaker in his victories. For Shlyakhtin, the two epitaphs should not be read as competitive, but as complementary images of Eirene, reflecting the new “aesthetics of plurality” of which the Komnenian Renaissance is justly famous. Foteini Spingou’s Ritual and Politics in the Pantokrator: A Lament in Two Acts for Eirene’s Son presents two ways of commemorating Eirene’s second son, the sebastokrator Andronikos during his burial in the Pantokrator Monastery. Theodore Prodromos composed a three hundred-ninety-three-verse monody, that an anonymous author resumed as an epitaph. Spingou discovers the agency of Andronikos’s wife, the sebastokratorissa Eirene behind these texts. The widow created a personalized ritual lament in a code appropriate for Komnenian culture: a monody recited at the funeral, and an epitaph that reminded forever the reader not only of Andronikos, but also of the sebastokratorissa—even if the latter failed to secure a tomb for herself next to her husband in the dynastic heroon. The essays collected in this volume present fresh scholarship on Piroska and the Pantokrator, approaching the founder and her foundation from multidisciplinary viewpoints and methodologies. We hope that this book will boost further research on the illustrious synktetor and her great project. Work on the Pantokrator has just started. The next in line is an international workshop in Istanbul organized for the 900th anniversary of the Pantokrator Monastery’s foundation. At the end of a long editorial process, it is our pleasure to express our gratitude to the persons and institutions who made the conference and the publication of its proceedings possible. In the organization of the colloquy, I enjoyed the unfailing\n\nPiroska 00 book.indb 9\n\n2019.09.04. 15:22\n\n10\n\nMarianne Sághy\n\nsupport of the late József Kalota, patriarchal vicar of the Greek Orthodox Church in Hungary, who did not live to see the publication of this book now dedicated to his memory. The conference was opened by His Eminence Arsenios Kardamakis, Metropolitan of Austria and Exarch of Hungary, Pál Fodor, director general of the Research Centre for the Humanities of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and Attila Fülöp, Vice-Secretary of State for ecclesiastical affairs, ethnic minorities, and NGOs in the Ministry of Human Capacities, in the presence of His Excellency Dimitri Yannakakis, Ambassador of the Republic of Greece to Hungary. Unfortunately, His Excellency the Ambassador of Turkey was unable to attend. I thank Etele Kiss of the Hungarian National Museum whose generously shared knowledge was enormously helpful in the organization of the conference. The presence of Judith Herrin and Niels Gaul at the colloquy was much appreciated. The support of Daniel Ziemann, head of the Medieval Studies Department at CEU was invaluable and PhD student Ágnes Drosztmér’s coordination of the event highly professional. We thank CEU’s Academic Cooperation and Research Support Office (ACRO) for its conference grant, CEU’s Medieval Studies Department and Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies (CEMS), the University of Pennsylvania, the Humanities Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the “Lendület Research Group” entitled “Hungary in Medieval Europe” at the History Department of Debrecen University, the Hungarian National Museum, the Research Centre for the Humanities of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Budapest’s Fifth District, the City Council of Belváros-Lipótváros, who offered the conference dinner. I am grateful to David Hendrix who made me discover Late Antique and medieval Constantinople and proofread the papers, as well as to my colleague Cristian-Nicolae Gaşpar, lecturer in Classical and Medieval Latin at CEU’s Medieval Studies Department and Senior Fellow at the Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies for translating Nicholas Kallikles’s poem On the tomb of the Despina into English. The Image Collections and Fieldwork Archives of the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library, the Bibliotheca Apostolica Vaticana, the Hungarian National Archives, Zoltán Kárpáti and Károly Szelényi generously provided the illustrations.

Due to the complete lack of information about King Ladis­ laus’s daughter in the eleventh–twelfth century historical record in Hungary,2 the question cannot be answered with any certainty. It is not unreasonable to surmise, 1 Special\n\nthanks to Etele Kiss and Jonathan Shepard for their helpful comments on this paper. name of the daughter of King Ladislaus and Adelaide of Rheinfelden is not known from eleventh–twelfth century sources, as medieval chroniclers tend to omit queens’ and princesses’ names. The name “Pyrisk” for Ladislaus’s daughter first appears in the fourteenth-century Illuminated Chronicle (Chronicum Pictum, chapter 156), incorporated into Johannes de Thurócz’s Chronicle of the Hungarians, chapter LXIII): “Imperatrix Constantinopolitana filia regis Ladizlai nomine Pyrisk.” In: Emericus Szentpétery (ed.), Scriptores rerum Hungaricarum, vol. I. Budapest: Magyar Tudományos Akadémia, 1937. The first syllable of the name Pyrisk, just like another Old Hungarian name, Pyrit (from the verb pirít, “to roast”), may derive from Greek pyr (fire.) The modern reconstruction of the name, “Piroska” echoes the Hungarian adjective piros (red), usually explained as a reference to the girl’s red hair. Hungarian has two words for “red” (piros, vörös), of which “­piros” is only used for complexion, never for hair: ginger hair is “vörös.” Would the royal couple have named their baby daughter after her healthy complexion? Pre-Christian names are not infrequent among the Árpáds, hence names reflecting character or looks cannot be excluded. From the assumption, however, that the baby must have had a Christian name, stems another theory linking Piroska to the Roman child martyr Saint Prisca, or Priscilla/Prisca, who hosted Saint Paul the Apostle in Rome, a name that would well reflect the Roman ambitions of the girl’s grandfather, the anti-emperor Rudolph the Swabian. Piroska/Prisca, however, are not attested as female names or names of saints in Hungarian sources before the fifteenth century: Mór Wertner, Névmagyarázatok II. Régi magyar női nevek.

In the toponymy, Pyros appears in a charter of 1237 as a village’s name in Southern Hungary (Hungarian Piros, Serbian Руменка/Rumenka, German Piross, today in Voyvodina, Serbia). Legend has it that the village was the dowry of Princess Piroska, who stopped at Piros on her way to Constantinople.\n\n2 The\n\nPiroska 00 book.indb 11\n\n2019.09.04. 15:22\n\n12\n\nMarianne Sághy\n\nhowever, that the orphaned princess, apart from a courtly upbringing in Esztergom and/or in Székesfehérvár, was also given a religious education in a cloister. Among the monasteries in eleventh-century Hungary, the Greek Nunnery in Veszprémvölgy near Veszprém, the Hungarian queens’ residential and burial town, is considered to have functioned as an educational center for royal princesses. This paper explores the key role of this and other Greek monasteries in the study of the religion and culture of early Árpádian Hungary. While Piroska’s formation in the Veszprémvölgy community must remain hypothetical, a survey of what is known of Eastern asceticism in the realm under the reigns of King Stephen I (997–1038), King Andrew I (1046–1060), King Ladislaus I (1077–1095) and King Coloman I (1095–1116) offers a possibility to review sophisticated theories and debates that the presence of orthodox cenobitism and eremitism fuels in Hungarian historiography. To summarize the history of Byzantine monasticism in Hungary is to risk telling in one’s own words a story that has often been excellently told before by scholars such as Gyula Moravcsik3 and Endre von Ivánka.4 Recent research, however, regards the eleventh century as a unique momentum in the history of Christian asceticism that led to sui generis forms of cross-pollination of Greek, Slav, and Latin monasticism.5 The paradigm shift affects the study of Eastern monasticism in Hungary.6 The remarkable 3 Gyula\n\nMoravcsik, “Görögnyelvű monostorok Szent István korában.” [Greek-Language Monasteries in the Age of Saint Stephen.] In: Emlékkönyv Szent István halálának kilencszázadik évfordulóján [The Commemoration of the 900th Anniversary of the Death of King Saint Stephen.] Jusztinián Serédi (ed.)

It proved to be stronger than linguistic, ritual and cultic differences that slowly started driving a wedge among Greek and Latin Christians. This places young Piroska against the background of the unprecedented spi­ri­tual aggiornamento and a remarkable cultural boom taking place in eleventhto–twelfth century Hungary. The princess sailed from a royal court with imperial ambitions at the height of its expansionist might. Determined to catch up with neighboring Christian empires—a process that involved rapid and spontaneous appropriation of sophisticated political ideas as well as refined spiritual and cultural goods—the Árpádian kings not only benefited from, but also promoted the idea of the reunification of the Roman Empire (renovatio imperii), even by vindicating its leadership. No country “bumpkin” from the margins of Byzantium, no foreigner to Greek culture, Princess Piroska carried an impressive cultural baggage upon her arrival in Constantinople—not least with regard to monastic spirituality. The Veszprémvölgy Charter The oldest charter preserved in Hungary is King Stephen’s Greek foundation roll of the Veszprémvölgy Nunnery.

This is what King Coloman did in 1109 by issuing a renovatio that carefully copied the original Greek text, provided a Latin translation to it and corroborated its dispositions. In the original roll, King Stephen declares that he dedicated, fully furnished, and endowed a monastery near Veszprém to the Mother of God for the salvation of his wife, children, himself, and the entire population of Pannonia. Listing the possessions and privileges bestowed upon the religious community dependent from the metropolitan, the king affirms that God will punish those who violate this grant. The Greek text is undated. When did the foundation of the Veszprémvölgy monastery take place, who was its founder, and what necessitated its foundation? Several hypotheses have been put forward to answer these questions. Some suggest that the Greek religious community of women was established by Stephen’s father, Prince Géza (also baptized Stephen), and thus the foundation dates before 997.11 If Christianity made much progress among the Hungarian tribes under Prince Géza’s rule,12 this theory is contradicted by the issuer’s title, who calls himself “king” 10 The\n\ncharter survived in an authentic copy (the original bilingual copy of Coloman the Learned of 1109, charter A) and a fake copy (the thirteenth-century copy of Coloman’s charter, charter B) in Veszprémvölgy monastery (taken over by Cistercian nuns in the thirteenth century) until the Ottoman invasion of Hungary in the mid-sixteenth century. After the fall of Székesfehérvár to the Turks in 1543, the Cistercian nuns fled from Veszprémvölgy to Körmend in Western Hungary. In 1627, Cistercian female orders were dissolved and the properties of the nuns, along with their charters, were transmitted to the Jesuits of Győr. Following the dissolution of the Jesuits in 1773, the two charters were kept in the Archives of the Hungarian Chamber until the twentieth century, when both were deposited in the Hungarian National Archives (DL 11/1 and DL 11/2.)

This cannot fit King Stephen—but could it eventually be an allusion to the religion of his mother, Sarolt? A reference to the Byzantine bride of Prince Emeric, King Stephen’s son in the thirteenth-century Legend of Saint Margaret (daughter of King Béla IV, who lived in Veszprémvölgy’s new Dominican cloister near the Greek monastery) led Gyula Moravcsik to suggest that the Byzantine emperor might have been “the Greek-language founder” of the nunnery.19 The great Hungarian Byzantinist conjectured that King Stephen “was not the founder of the nunnery, merely sancMelich, A honfoglaláskori Magyarország [Hungary in the Age of the Magyar Conquest.] Budapest: Akadémiai, 1925, 29, 39. 14 Gyula Moravcsik, “The Role of the Byzantine Church in Medieval Hungary.” American Slavic and East European Review 6 (1947): 143. 15 László Holler, “Géza vagy István idejében alapították-e a veszprémvölgyi monostort?” [Was the Monastery of Veszprémvölgy founded under the reign of Géza or István?] Magyar Nyelv 107 (2011): 257–279; idem, “A veszprémi görög rítusú monostor alapító- és adománylevelének datálásáról és további kérdéseiről.” [On the Date and Other Issues of the Foundation and Donation Charter of the Greek Rite Monastery in Veszprémvölgy].

Where did Greeks come from to Hungary? Not necessarily from the East; they could just as well have arrived from the West. In the tenth and eleventh centuries, the sphere of Byzantine spirituality and culture covered a vast horizon that included North-Eastern Italy and Sicily. Scholars have long brought attention to the fact that Greek influences in Hungary appear not only as a direct result of Greek presence and Byzantine missionary activity in the area, but also thanks to Italian and Germano-Byzantine culture carriers. In 1097, King Coloman married a Norman princess from Sicily, whose retinue included Greek speakers. This led Gyula Czebe, the first editor of the Greek text of the Veszprémvölgy charter to suggest that the original text might have been copied and revised by a Sicilian Greek scribe in King Coloman’s court.24 This hypothesis, however, was rejected: comparative reading of the charter shows that it uses a terminology typical to eleventh-century Byzantine diplomacy25 and thus opens a window onto the vivid Byzantine culture of King Stephen’s court, where a Greek priest worked as a scribe and drafted the document.26 20\n\nGyula Moravcsik, “The Role of the Byzantine Church,” art. cit. 143.\n\n21 Ibid. 22 Géza\n\nÉrszegi, “Szent István görögnyelvű okleveléről.” [On Saint Stephen’s Greek Charter.] Levéltári Szemle 38 (1988): 239–249. 23 Rudolf Szentgyörgyi, “The auctor monasterii of the Byzantine Monastery of Veszprém Valley 2.” In: Egedi-Kovács, Emese (ed.)

King Stephen’s foreigner-friendly policy was part of the conception to assure his sovereignty and exclude the superpowers to dominate in Hungary by establishing a “balance of power” between the German and Greek commonwealths. Favoring both Latin and Greek forms of Christianity was more than good politics in the case of Stephen, himself raised in the Greek rite practiced by his mother. For Stephen, Latin and Greek, Slavic or Hungarian were as many idioms and expressions of a single, indivisible Christianity.28 The king of Hungary regarded Constantinople and Rome “the two eyes of Christendom” and gave lavish donations to build pilgrim houses in both cities, as well as in Jerusalem, the birthplace of Christianity.29 The Hungarian hospice butt­ressed Saint Peter’s Basilica in Rome,30 but the exact location of Stephen’s foundation in Constantinople is not known. To the Árpádian kings, rulers of a multiethnic country, the terms ‘East and West,’ ‘Roman Catholicism and Greek Orthodoxy,’ ‘Byzantium and the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation’ used by modern historiography for a compartmentalization of historical reality, would have simply made no sense. Kings and Greek Nuns, Queens and Slav Hermits Apart from its rite and language, the location of the Veszprémvölgy Monastery is also remarkable.

Who were the nuns in Veszprémvölgy? The convent functioned as a spiritual and educational center for royal princesses of Hungary whose prospective husbands included the rulers of Kievan Rus, Bulgaria, Serbia, or Byzantium. Apart from the princesses, daughters of the courtly élite following the Greek rite, Queen Gisela’s retinue, and members of the “diplomatic corps” in Hungary were likely to patronize the monastery. Not only did Veszprém boast with a Greek nunnery outside of the town, her patron saints were warrior saints popular in Byzantium: the bishopric of Veszprém was dedicated to Saint Michael, and its first ecclesiastical building, a rotunda, to Saint George.33 While the choice of Saint Michael, heavenly leader of the New Israel, may owe less to Byzantine spirituality than to the city’s standing on a cliff, the Chapel of Saint George did have direct links to Byzantium: it was built to house the relics of the saint, a gift from Emperor Basil II to his ally King Stephen, acquired during the war against the Bulgars between 1016 and 1018 in Ohrid. Eastern spirituality permeated yet another monastery, the Benedictine Abbey of Saint Maurice of Bél founded by King Stephen in 1018, at only thirtyfour kilometers from Veszprém. The Bél (Bakonybél) monastery stemmed from the Gutheil, Az Árpád-koriVeszprém.

Converted at the age of fifty to the ascetic life—a cause célèbre at the time—Günther made a pilgrimage to Rome and entered the Abbey of Niederaltaich in Bavaria in 1006, where Abbot Godehard gave him permission before long to leave the premises of the monastery and establish himself a hermitage. Günther’s intense asceticism drew heavily on the inspiration of Eastern masters of spirituality, such as the Desert Fathers—he even learned Greek for their sake—and cherished a special veneration for Saint John the Baptist, the Prodromos. His sermons on his patron saint moved audiences to tears. “A mobile hermit with a large radius of movement”34 who linked Bavaria with Bohemia and Hungary, Günther was an indefatigable founder of Eastern lavra-type eremitic communities. The success of his mission was not only due to his smattering of Slavic languages, but (primarily) to his unrivaled contacts with the rulers of Bohemia and Hungary. He often dropped by at King Stephen’s court in Székesfehérvár: “the blessed Günther, who, drawn by the generosity of the charitable prince, used to visit him often from the land of the Czechs. For whenever he illuminated Stephen’s court by the brightness of his arrival, the treasury of the king, placed at his disposal, was emptied in a short time of the things that it contained through their distribution to pilgrims, the poor, the needy, widows and orphans, monasteries and churches.”35 No similar charitable activities are connected to the nunnery of Veszprémvölgy. Nothing is known about the everyday life and work of the nuns. Luxury needlework, however, is often attributed to the monastery. The golden chasuble offered by the royal couple as a gift to the Provostry Church of the Virgin Mary at Székesfehérvár in 103136 is thought to have been embroidered by Queen Gisela and the nuns in Veszprémvölgy.37Made of the finest Byzantine silk, the rosette-patterned, bell-shaped chasuble is entirely embroidered in gold thread and was decorated with pearls and gemstones.

The Assumption of the Virgin Mary—the feast of the Székesfehérvár Provostry—is shown at the neck of the chasuble. At the foot of Christ’s Cross, King Stephen and Queen Gisela are represented in medallions. The king wears a circlet crown with gemstones, a winged lance in his right hand and an orb in his left. Gisela wears the same crown and holds a tower reliquary in her hand. Between them, the half-length portrait of a young man in a circular frame is probably their son, Prince Emeric, who died in a hunting accident in the very year of 1031. The chasuble’s inscriptions contain the names of the figures and Latin hexameters. The execution of the chasuble cannot be linked with any certainty to the monastery of Veszprémvölgy. It might just as well have been produced in an Esztergom or Székesfehérvár royal workshop. Another precious textile, the purple purse of Saint Stephen of Hungary decorated with Old Church Slavonic religious inscriptions in gold thread is also attributed to the Veszprémvölgy nunnery, again without hard proof.38 The Monastery of the Holy Mother of God in Veszprémvölgy was but one of several Greek monastic communities in eleventh-century Hungary. Greek monasticism and Eastern eremitism seem to have been the dominant forms of spiritual life in the country at the time. As late as 1204, Pope Innocent III wrote to King Emeric I: “In your realm, there exists only one Latin cenobite monastery, but many Greek.”39 Surviving historical record about the Greek monasteries is uneven, due to the withering away of the Greek cloisters in subsequent centuries and to the rise of Roman Catholic forms of monastic life: as against twenty-seven Benedictine abbeys, only eight Greek monasteries are known in the eleventh–thirteenth centuries:40 the Monastery of Saint George at Oroszlános (today Banatsko Aranđelovo in Serbia) on River Maros in South-Eastern Hungary, Tihany-Óvár cave monastery at Lake Balaton near Veszprém, the Monastery of Saint Andrew in Visegrád with its dependent cave cells in Zebegény in the Danube Bend near Esztergom, the Monastery of Saint Hyppolitus on Mount Zobor in Nyitra (today Nitra in Slovakia), the Monastery of Saint Panteleimon in Pentele on the River Danube, and the Monastery of Saint Demetrius in Szávaszentdemeter (today Sremska Mitrovica in Serbia) on the River Sava in Southern Hungary.

In 1028, Ajtony challenged King Stephen and obstructed the transport of salt from Transylvania to Hungary on the River Maros. The king’s army led by Csanád defeated Ajtony in the battle at Oroszlános and conquered his lands. Stephen established the bishopric of Csanád in 1030 and appointed Gerard, a Benedictine monk from Venice, as its bishop. Upon his arrival to his see, Gerard transferred the Greek monks of Marosvár to Oroszlános, in a new monastery dedicated to Saint George.41In the library of Marosvár Monastery, Gerard found Greek codices that inspired his exegesis of the biblical story of the three youths in the furnace that he possibly composed in the Benedictine Abbey of Saint Maurice in Bakonybél. 42 In 1055, King Andrew (1046–1060), who had lived as an exile in Kiev and married Anastasia, the daughter of Jaroslav of Kiev, founded a Benedictine abbey dedicated to Saint Anianus of Orléans in Tihany on Lake Balaton43 and a Greek monastery in Visegrád in honor of his patron saint, Andrew.44 The Tihany foundation replaced an earlier Greek monastery possibly dedicated to Saint Tychon, whose name survived as the name of the peninsula.45 Both foundations had clusters of caves nearby for hermits, who lived in individual cells, but constituted an eremitic group (lavra).46 Even Oroszkő—the name of the hermits’ caves in Tihany-Óvár— preserves the memory of the Greek monks: even though it means ‘Russian Stone’, it possibly derives from the Greek oros (hill) and thus refers to Tihany as a sacred mount, similarly to Mount Athos (Hagios Oros),47 rather than to the recently arrived Gerardi Maior” 14, Scriptores Rerum Hungaricarum 2, 495; Zoltán J.

The Visegrád Greek monastery had eremitic cells on the opposite bank of the Danube in Zebegény.48 In 1056, exiles of the Benedictine Monastery of Sázava in Bohemia arrived in Hungary and established themselves near the Monastery of Saint Andrew.49 In Tihany and Visegrád, Greek and Latin monks and hermits settled in the vicinity of each other. They did not cohabit, but their physical closeness assured that they could draw inspiration from each other. King Andrew’s foundation of Benedictine and Orthodox monastic houses and the coexistence of Latin, Greek and Russian monks continue earlier royal models and demonstrate the strength of the conviction of the unity of Christianity in eleventh-century Hungary. The monks regarded Hungary as the “wild East,” where, as it was shown by the martyrdom of Gerard of Csanád, it was still possible, as late as in 1046, to die as a martyr, or to live in imitation of the Desert Fathers on sacred mounts, impenetrable forests, and unapproachable cliffs hanging over vast waters. The appearance of cave heremitism in Hungary is more than a direct echo of the great tradition of monastic lavra in Greek and Slav Christianity: it is a sign of the appeal of the Desert Fathers. The attraction of cave eremitism reached as far as Northern Hungary: in the Monastery of Saint Hyppolitus on Mount Zobor in Nyitra (today Nitra in Slovakia), a Polish ascetic, Zoerard-Andrew lived a life modeled on that of the Desert Fathers, especially that of Zosimas, the sixth-century Palestinian monk and confessor of Mary of Egypt. Inspired by his readings, Zoerard used three particular devices of mortification typical of early Christian asceticism: a sleeping stool and a wooden crown with stones hanging on four sides that turned nocturnal repose to torment and affliction, and a metal chain tied around the waist that made everyday existence a constant torture.50 Zoerard’s community also combined Latin Benedictine and Greek Slavonic rites.51 The origins of the monasteries in Pentele and Szávaszentdemeter—both localities named after their patron saints, Saint Pantaleimon and Saint Demetrius respectively—are obscure and the presence of Greek monks is only known from 48 János Karácsonyi, “Hogyan jöttek a görög szerzetesek Visegrádra?” [How did Greek Monks Come\n\nto Visegrád?] Katholikus Szemle 41 (1927). 16–21. Saint Margaret, Queen of the Scots: A Life in Perspective, op. cit., 20–21. 50 Miladinov, Margins of Solitude 120–123. Eastern asceticism was an inspiration for hermits all over Europe in the eleventh century. Thus, for example, the hermit Godfric in East Anglia designed a specially uncomfortable chair with curving back of shoulder height, so that he could spend all night in prayer, see Andrew Jotischky, “Monastic reform and the geography of Christendom: experience, observation and influence,” Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 6th Series 22 (2012), 57–74.

A charter of Palatine János Drugeth from 1329 refers in an idiosyncratic way—“begine sine moniales Grecales”—to the Greek monastery in Pentele. As its patron saint indicates, the monastery of Pentele must have been a Greek male community from the eleventh to the thirteenth century. The charter’s wording reflects the blending of the memory of Greek monks and the Saint Catherine begina-community who took over the abandoned cloister after the Mongol invasion of 1241–42.52 A letter of Pope Honorius III dated 29 January 1218 mentions the Monastery of Saint Demetrius near the River Száva belonging to the Churches of Saint Theodore of Laberra.53 In a letter of 1344, Pope Clement VI asks the bishop of Nyitra to settle Benedictine monks in the ancient Monastery of Szávaszentdemeter. The pope explains that Greek, Hungarian and Slav monks had lived here together, yet separately, its abbot depending directly from the patriarch of Constantinople. Since the death of the last Greek abbot some ten years earlier, the monastery stood empty.54 György Györffy dates the foundation of Szávaszentdemeter Monastery to 1071–1072 and highlights that it was connected to Constantinople, rather than to a Bulgarian bishopric.55 Interaction between Latins and Greeks The heyday of Eastern asceticism in early Árpádian Hungary was a unique moment of the permeability and interaction of Latin and Greek monasticism. The eleventh-century eremitic revival meant the discovery and absorption of Greek and Egyptian monastic models by Latin Christianity: monks flocked to Hungary to re-live the desert experience.

The decline of Eastern monasticism in Hungary starts in the twelfth century with the implementation of Gregorian reforms by King Coloman and continues in the thirteenth: a letter of Honorius III written on 20 April 1221 to the archbishop of Esztergom and the abbot of Pilis rules that King Andrew II people the Monastery of Visegrád with Latin monks, because the community, abandoned by the Greeks, decayed in spirit and in resources.61 The survival of Eastern cenobitism was sealed by the Mongol invasion of Hungary in 1242: during the reign of Béla IV (1235–1270) Benedictines and Cistercians took over the abandoned Greek-rite monasteries, while new mendicant orders settled in towns. Byzantine Christianity in Hungary was missionary in the tenth century,62 and monastic in the eleventh.

Greek and Slav ceno­bite and eremitic communities depended from the Greek metropolitan and mushroomed in the vicinity of royal centers, such as Esztergom, Marosvár, Nyitra and Veszprém. Eastern ascetics were contemplative: no mention of their charitable, social or missionary activity survives. However, as the example of Günther of Niederaltaich shows, even the most contemplative of hermits was capable of showing great social sensibility and practical charity. Serving the spiritual needs of kings and queens, high-brow intellectuals, men and women attracted by the spirituality of the Desert Fathers, the fusion of Greek and Latin spirituality was, just like in Italy, promoted by the political and monastic leadership. As Jean-Marie Sansterre observes, “pour l’élite monastique, le sentiment d’unité transcendait les differences.” 63 Eastern monasticism was no “hothouse flower” in Hungary.64 The spiritual, visual and material legacy of the Greek monasteries, even in its fragmented form, suggests that they responded to the needs of wider social circles and took deeper roots in society than hitherto imagined. The laws of King Ladislaus at the Council of Szabolcs in 1092, in the thick of the Gregorian conflict demonstrate the extent to which Byzantine piety permeated religious life in Hungary: priests were allowed to marry, fasting and the sanctification of water followed Greek traditions.65 The ecclesiastical legislation of Piroska’s father evidences the impact of Byzantine monasticism on Christian piety in Hungary. The legacy of open-minded spiritual interaction between Greeks and Latins was not lost on Princess Piroska. She might have heard edifying stories about King Stephen’s Marian piety, his charity towards the poor, and his generous endowments of monasteries, as her ward, King Coloman promoted with brio the cult of the first Christian king in Hungary,66 commissioning Bishop Hartvic to compose a new Life\n\n63 Jean-Marie\n\nSansterre, “Saint Nil de Rossano et le monachisme latin.” In: A.
