        "text": "Citation preview\n\nBYZANTIUM IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY\n\nThe eleventh century in Byzantium is all about being in between, whether this is between Basil II and Alexios Komnenos, between the forces of the Normans, the Pechenegs and the Turks, or between different social groupings, cultural identities and religious persuasions. It is a period of fundamental changes and transformations, both internal and external, but also a period rife with clichés and dominated by the towering presence of Michael Psellos whose usually self-contradictory accounts continue to loom large in the field of Byzantine studies. The essays collected here, which were delivered at the 45th Spring Symposium of Byzantine Studies, explore new avenues of research and offer new perspectives on this transitional period. The book is divided into four thematic clusters: ‘The age of Psellos’ studies this crucial figure and seeks to situate him in his time; ‘Social structures’ is concerned with the ways in which the deep structures of Byzantine society and economy responded to change; ‘State and Church’ offers a set of studies of various political developments in eleventh-century Byzantium; and ‘The age of spirituality’ offers the voices of those for whom Psellos had little time and little use: monks, religious thinkers and pious laymen. Marc D. Lauxtermann is Bywater and Sotheby Professor of Byzantine and Modern Greek Language and Literature and Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford University. He hails from Amsterdam. He has written extensively on Byzantine poetry and metre, and is the co-editor of a recent book on the letters of Psellos. Further research interests include translations of oriental tales in Byzantium, the earliest grammars and dictionaries of vernacular Greek, and the development of the Greek language in the eighteenth century. Mark Whittow is the University Lecturer in Byzantine Studies at the University of Oxford. Recent or forthcoming publications include ‘Byzantium’s Eurasian Policy in the Age of the Türk Empire’, in Maas and Di Cosmo’s Entangled Empires: Rome, Iran, China, and the Eurasian Steppe in Late Antiquity (2017); ‘Byzantium and the Feudal Revolution’ in HowardJohnston and Whittow’s The Transformation of Byzantium (2017); and ‘The End of Antiquity in the Lykos Valley’ in S¸ims¸ek’s The Lykos Valley and Neighbourhood in Late Antiquity (2016).\n\nSOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF BYZANTINE STUDIES Publications 19\n\nThis series publishes a selection of papers delivered at the annual British Spring Symposium of Byzantine Studies, now held under the auspices of the Society for the Promotion of Byzantine Studies.

Reason enough, one would say, to enjoy the lovely weather and the idyllic surroundings of Oxford. And yet they came in droves, from nearby and further afield, ostensibly to listen to talks on Byzantium in the eleventh century, but also, even though they may not have realized it, to explore in-betweenness (it’s a word, look it up). There was a record number of 52 speakers (23 lectures and 29 short communications) and 150 participants, for which we are immensely grateful. All this would not have been possible without the kind and generous support of the A.G. Leventis Foundation, the Oxford Centre for Byzantine Research, the Interfaculty Committee for Late Antique and Byzantine Studies, the Faculty of Medieval and Modern Languages and the History Faculty.

Lauxtermann\n\nThere are moments in history when time suddenly seems to accelerate and speed on, leaving behind a trail of bewildered and confused spectators: such is the case with the eleventh century in Byzantium. In poem 66, John Mauropous expresses his surprise at seeing how promptly officials are raised through all the ranks of the imperial administration: the traditional cursus honorum has become a dizzying experience in his time (probably the reign of Monomachos, but perhaps later), and he writes: ἀπῆλθεν ἡ χθές, ἡ δ᾽ ἐνεστῶσα τρέχει, / καὶ τὴν παροῦσαν αὔριον χθές τις φράσει, ‘yesterday is gone, and the present is speeding by: as some may say, today will be yesterday tomorrow’. This is the historical sense of in-betweenness, of being caught up by momentous events and then left behind wondering what has just happened. Is the eleventh century a short Hobsbawmian one (say, 1025 to 1071, from grandeur to misery), a long interval between the Macedonian and Comnenian heydays (say, late tenth to early twelfth centuries), or a blitz moment of Psellian bliss (roughly 1042–75)? In-betweenness is a state of mind. In postcolonial studies it indicates the being in between cultures, the fate of second- or third-generation immigrants in Europe. In postmodern urban development studies it indicates the being in between places, the fate of commuters travelling from A to B: the London Tube, for example, is a ‘heterotopy’ (to use the term of Foucault), a place of difference and abandonment, a unique non-place in between conflicting identities (say, loyal employee and loving husband). In our field of studies the concept of in-betweenness seems an apt description of the eleventh century as a transitional period, an in-between area, a state of ambivalence that avoids easy categorization and challenges us to rethink our ideas of Byzantium. In poem 46, Christopher Mitylenaios tells us that the beginning and the end of the book of Job are a story of bliss; it is the middle part, the in-between, that is agonizingly painful: τὰ δ᾽ αὖ μέσα φεῦ ὀδυνηρά, ‘but it’s the things in the middle that sadly hurt’. The eleventh century is all about being in between, whether this is between the anvil and the hammer, between Basil II and Alexios Komnenos, between the forces of the Normans, the Pechenegs and the Turks, or between different social xv\n\nMARC D. LAUXTERMANN\n\ngroupings, cultural identities and religious persuasions. And there is no reason to doubt that this in-betweenness must have been a distinctly unpleasant experience for many Byzantines. It is because of Psellos’ rhetorical forcefulness that we tend to see the eleventh century as a triumph of ‘humanism’ and enlightened ‘Hellenism’, but it is also, and perhaps primarily, a period of religious uncertainty, spiritual anguish and pious regrets. To quote the always quotable Lemerle, ‘La caractéristique du temps, c’est plutôt qu’on parle beaucoup du savoir et de la culture’: it is indeed much cry and little wool. The eleventh century significantly begins with the mystical effusions of Symeon the New Theologian and ends with the Dioptra of Philip Monotropos, a huge compendium of religious and ethical teachings. There is little ‘Hellenism’ there and much spiritual anxiety. In general, the problem with the eleventh century is that there is too much Psellos and a lack of everything else. Few would doubt that it is a period of fundamental changes and transformations, both internal and external (just compare the later part of Basil II’s reign with the early years of Alexios Komnenos, and it is not difficult to spot the differences). But it is also a period rife with clichés and dominated by the towering presence of Michael Psellos whose usually self-contradictory accounts continue to loom large in the field of Byzantine studies. How do we move forward from there? And to what extent do other old explanatory models (all of them owing some sort of debt to Psellos) have any relevance now? The last sustained effort to look at the eleventh century from multiple perspectives came in the 1970s, shaped strongly by work on a series of key texts, such as the lists of precedence, the will of Boilas, the diataxis of Attaleiates, the typikon of Pakourianos, the archival materials of Athos, the letters of Psellos, and so on. This led to a number of extremely important publications by Lemerle, Lefort, Gautier and others; the special issue of Travaux et Mémoires 6 (1976) is significant in this respect. Since that time there has been a great deal of work in a variety of disciplines and on a variety of materials which were not privileged in the 1970s, especially sigillography, numismatics, epigraphy, historiography, poetry, epistolography, religious polemic, monastic life and popular religious culture; there has also been a greater appreciation of the need to look at material culture across middle Byzantine history, even if that archaeological material is still relatively unexplored. See, for example, the various papers in V. Vlyssidou (ed.), The Empire in Crisis (?): Byzantium in the Eleventh Century, or the numerous highly important articles by Jean-Claude Cheynet and his colleagues in Paris. Much remains to be done. The most pressing issue at hand is the need to have reliable editions and translations of key texts. Stratis Papaioannou is preparing an edition of Psellos’ letters and Michael Jeffreys will publish English summaries of these letters in a volume he and I are co-editing. James Howard-Johnston is preparing a translation of the Peira with commentary. xvi\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nEirini Afendoulidou is about to publish the first scholarly edition of Philip Monotropos’ Dioptra. Christian Hannick has recently published the Taktikon of Nikon of the Black Mountain, including his extremely important correspondence – in this time of growing Greeklessness, Nikon’s writings urgently need to be translated. Then there are texts that have been published, but are strangely overlooked by all and sundry: for example, the homilies John Mauropous wrote when he was metropolitan of Euchaita – a rich source of information on the eastern provinces shortly before Manzikert, but foolishly ignored. There is the mass of archaeological data, scattered around in various publications: these need to be assembled and put into perspective; the same goes for numismatic, epigraphic and sigillographic evidence – there is a lot of it, but we need an overview of, and some kind of perspective on, the available material. As noted above, the second task – after making the primary sources available to the scholarly world – is to rethink the eleventh century. Some years ago fellow Oxonians and I initiated a research project on legal, intellectual and social change in eleventh-century Byzantium, called ‘Transformation of Byzantium’, leading to three workshops, dedicated to the Peira of Eustathios Romaios and legal culture in the eleventh culture, the letters of Michael Psellos and his social networks, and social change in town and country and the feudal revolution. The present volume is the natural outcome of this research interest in the eleventh century, and I hope it may further our understanding of this fascinating period, though I must admit it is a bit of a prothysteron to do the rethinking before the sources are all available. In a sense, the study of the eleventh century is as in-between as the period itself: the old certainties are gone, but no new ones have taken their place. And prothysteron sums this up admirably – we are advancing in reverse. The volume is divided into four themes. As noted above, Psellos remains the key figure in our understanding of the eleventh century, and the only way to out-Psellos the Psellian paradigm, is to face him head-on – and this is done in the first thematic cluster, ‘The age of Psellos’. Magdalino discusses the transition from Constantine VII’s ‘encyclopaedism’ to the age of Psellos; Jeffreys offers an overview of Psellian studies now; Bernard analyses the social network of Psellos and his fellow λόγιοι, with reference to schools and literary production; and Cheynet studies Psellos as a civil servant writing to other civil servants, with particular interest in the workings of the imperial administration. The second thematic cluster, ‘Social structures’, looks at the gradual, almost imperceptible changes in Byzantine society: the ways in which the deep structures of society and economy respond to change. HowardJohnston examines the Peira and the workings of the judicial system in the eleventh century; Sarris views the rural landscape in eleventh-century Byzantium as both stable in terms of traditional agriculture and unstable xvii\n\nMARC D. LAUXTERMANN\n\nin terms of temporary ownership; and Greenwood discusses urban patterns in Armenia and the eastern provinces of the Byzantine empire. The third theme is that of ‘State and Church’. In contrast to the slow societal developments discussed in the previous thematic cluster, here the emphasis is on political change – and it is not the deep structures but the rippling, rapidly changing surface patterns that attract our attention. Whittow argues that the crises of the late eleventh and the late fourth and fifth centuries present two comparable falls of Rome; Shepard offers a detailed analysis of the growing tensions between east and west in the runup to the schism of 1054; Krallis discusses the civil versus military elites and offers a ‘republican’ reading of Attaleiates; Ryder discusses the ecclesiastical conflict between Alexios I and Leo of Chalcedon; and Frankopan examines the make-up of the imperial administration, before and after 1094. The fourth thematic cluster, ‘The age of spirituality’, offers the voices of those for whom Psellos had little time and little use: monks, religious thinkers and pious laymen. It consists of three chapters: Krausmüller argues that monastic conformity becomes the rule in the eleventh century; Crostini analyses the social and pictorial image of the monk in eleventh-century sources; and Parpulov offers a fascinating insight into spiritual practices as reflected in Byzantine art of the period. Not only does this volume have no pretensions to completeness, it also does not claim to present a comprehensive and rounded assessment of the issues at stake. Indeed, there is a fair amount of disagreement among the authors, which is only to be welcomed because scholarship thrives on argument and contention. There are differences of opinion on the concept of the eleventh century (long, short, extremely short); transformation and change versus the longue durée; internal reform versus external pressure; turmoil and upheaval versus ‘crisis? what crisis?’. There is also still a lot of Michael Psellos, even among those who wish to move forward and abandon the old Psellian paradigm. It is not only the eleventh century that is somehow somewhat in between; it is also current scholarship that, in its understanding of the period, sometimes wavers between opposite views. The optimist will say that we are on the brink of a paradigm shift; the pessimist that we are stuck in the past. I would say that we are somewhere in between.\n\nxviii\n\nSection I THE AGE OF PSELLOS\n\n1 FROM ‘ENCYCLOPAEDISM’ TO ‘HUMANISM’ The turning point of Basil II and the millennium Paul Magdalino\n\nSince the 1970s, the eleventh century has been central to the critique of the concept of an unchanging Byzantium, a critique that has become almost as much of a cliché as the dead horse that it continues to flog. The 45th Spring Symposium did not buck the trend; in its introductory blurb, and in placing Michael Psellos at the top of its agenda, it clearly signalled change, rather than continuity, as the salient characteristic of the period. Nor does the present chapter go against the flow; on the contrary, I wish to strengthen and clarify the paradigm that we owe to Lemerle and Kazhdan of the eleventh century as a period of change in Byzantine culture.1 It is a paradigm to which I subscribed twenty years ago in my work on twelfth-century Byzantium,2 and I returned to it recently, in a symposium on Byzantine poetry in the eleventh century. There I argued that poetry was a primary symptom and even a vehicle of cultural change.3 Here I would like to go deeper and look at the dynamics of the process. I would like to suggest that the eleventh century was not just a period during which changes occurred, but that it began with a significant transition, a flip of the switch that differentiated the Byzantium that went before from the Byzantium that came after. Crudely speaking, Byzantine elite culture passed from an age of classicism and encyclopaedism to an age of humanism and Hellenism, from which it never looked back. This moment of cultural change is easy to miss, or to dismiss, because it occurred within a framework of strong institutional and ideological continuity. A particularly eloquent example from our period is the monastery of Stoudios.4 As re-founded by Theodore the Studite, this had been the great powerhouse of coenobitic monasticism in the ninth century, second only to the patriarchal Church in consolidating the Triumph of Orthodoxy after iconoclasm – and particularly successful in promoting its image through 3\n\nPA U L M A G D A L I N O\n\nhagiography.5 Its presence and influence were as visible as ever in the decades around the year 1000. The extended version of its typikon, composed in the late tenth century, served as the template for many new monastic foundations in Constantinople and beyond.6 A Studite monk was sent to regulate the affairs of Mount Athos in 972.7 Shortly afterwards, another Studite, Anthony, became Patriarch Anthony III,8 and in 1025 two successive abbots of Stoudios were appointed to the sees of Antioch and Constantinople respectively.9 The patriarch of Constantinople in question, Alexios, not only founded a monastery whose typikon, based on the Studite rule, was translated into Slavonic,10 but also did much to sharpen the intolerance of heresy that resulted in the schism of 1054.11 We may recall that the monk who debated with Cardinal Humbert in 1054 was another Studite, Niketas Stethatos. So too was his spiritual father, Symeon the New Theologian, whose hagiography he wrote and whose voluminous writings he published. Part of his agenda in writing Symeon’s Life was to defend Symeon’s action in creating a cult of his own spiritual father, Symeon Eulabes. This elder Symeon, although a solitary urban ascetic and possibly a holy fool, had himself belonged to the Studite community.12 All these ‘graduates’ of the Stoudios were, in their different ways, exponents of Orthodoxy, and Orthodoxy, or more precisely the culture of Orthodoxy, was the main thing they had in common with the rest of the educated elite who staffed the institutions of church and state – past, present and future. In my work on the twelfth century, I entitled my chapter on intellectual culture ‘the guardians of Orthodoxy’,13 and revisiting the question today I see no reason to discard the formula. Orthodoxy was the single most distinctive badge of identity displayed by the Byzantine ‘intelligentsia’ from the ninth to the fifteenth century, whatever their other identities and interests. Their ultimate justification for their education in the ‘outer learning’ of classical paideia was its usefulness as an adjunct to expounding the word of God, and, by extension, the writ of the ‘holy emperor’ who ruled in God’s image. If we look at the written profile of the leading intellectuals in each century from 843 to 1453, we can see that each of them proclaimed a commitment to Orthodoxy and a readiness to jump to its defence: Photios in the ninth, Arethas and Niketas the Paphlagonian in the tenth, even Psellos in the eleventh, Prodromos and Eustathios in the twelfth, Blemmydes in the thirteenth, Gregoras in the fourteenth, and even Plethon in the fifteenth.14 The culture of Orthodoxy was a continuum that spanned the centuries from the end of iconoclasm to the end of Byzantium. But if the culture of Orthodoxy – the imperative of right thinking, the importance of being Orthodox – did not waver, becoming, if anything, more rigid with time, the Orthodoxy of culture – the definition and content of right thinking – became increasingly flexible, diverse and inclusive of contradictions.15 Orthodoxy remained a sanctum to which the Byzantine intelligentsia rallied when it was perceived to be under threat, or when they 4\n\nF R O M ‘ E N C Y C L O PA E D I S M ’ T O ‘ H U M A N I S M ’\n\nwere accused of straying too far outside. At the same time, they readily moved from the core area of political and religious correctness into the surrounding grey area of the peripheral zone, which it was their duty, as guardians of Orthodoxy, to patrol. In their own terms, they blurred the boundaries separating the inner from the outer wisdom. Put differently, they found more time for the medium than the message, and what ultimately interested them was their control of and access to the media: their mastery of logos, techne, and episteme. Peer recognition of skills came to matter as much as dedication to a master or a cause; the first duty of a logios was to his techne and episteme. This was the balance that tipped between the age of Constantine Porphyrogenitus and the age of Michael Psellos. The shift can be measured in terms of many differences: the end of encyclopaedism, the re-engagement with philosophy,16 the rehabilitation of Hellenism,17 the rise of literary self-assertiveness and the authorial ego.18 Instead of returning to these developments, which have been well studied and are well known, I would like to pick out one smaller thread that perfectly illustrates the widening gap between the culture of Orthodoxy and the Orthodoxy of culture. This is the changing emphasis in the image of St Gregory of Nazianzos, surnamed the Theologian, who was the Orthodox Church Father par excellence.19 Leading writers of the tenth century, Niketas the Paphlagonian, Theodore Daphnopates, and Constantine Porphyrogenitus wrote encomia of the saint that were highly polished but conventionally hagiographical celebrations of Gregory as bishop, ascetic, and defender of Orthodoxy.20 A century later, Psellos wrote a piece that was entirely devoted to praising Gregory as a master of rhetorical style, who surpassed all the rhetors and philosophers of antiquity through his gift for harmonizing words and expressing complex ideas in clear, elegant prose.21 Niketas the Paphlagonian had likened Gregory to a host of Old Testament worthies – for example, he had been like Gideon in his smiting of Julian the Apostate. Psellos compared Gregory with Plato, Plutarch, Demosthenes, Herodotos, Thucydides, and other classical authors. Psellos admires Gregory for what he says, but even more for the way he says it. ‘Whenever I encounter him, I engage with him at once, at first for philosophical instruction, and then for recreation. I am filled with inexpressible delight and gratification. I often forget what I am trying to read, and straying from the theological ideas I am lost in the rose garden of the words and my senses are captivated’.22 Psellos comes close to hagiography when he writes that Gregory derived his eloquence, like his ideas, not from the imitation of classical models, but from a heavenly source, that he was his own archetype.23 But this is reminiscent of what Psellos writes in the Chronographia about himself and his own ‘lonely mission’ to reopen the springs of learning.24 He also credits Gregory with another of his own preoccupations: the relationship between rhetoric and philosophy, and the importance of expressing the difficult ideas of the latter with the rosy grace of the former.25 So Psellos effectively 5\n\nPA U L M A G D A L I N O\n\nconstructs the Theologian as a role model and a justification for his own intellectual priorities. Yet Psellos was not the only or the first Byzantine intellectual to adopt the Theologian as an exemplar of qualities other than his Orthodox theology. Psellos’ contemporary John Mauropous was clearly inspired by Gregory’s example in writing autobiographical poetry, and in justifying his resignation from his bishopric.26 As an autobiographical poet with a big debt to the Theologian, Mauropous had been anticipated by John Geometres, who also anticipated Psellos in comparing Gregory with ancient non-Christian writers.27 Moreover, the idea that the Theologian was a better model of Attic eloquence than any classical rhetorician had already been stated, in the generation between Geometres and Psellos, by the teacher of rhetoric John Sikeliotes, who in his lectures on Hermogenes systematically promoted Gregory at the expense of Demosthenes as a model of rhetorical eloquence.28 As we shall see, Sikeliotes used the example of Gregory of Nazianzos to formulate an ideology of politikos logos, thus inaugurating the revival of the Second Sophistic that culminated in what has recently been characterized as the ‘civic humanism’ of the late Byzantine city.29 But first we must look at the rest of the evidence for the turning point that he reflects. There are other signs of a growing sophistication, self-confidence and professionalism on the part of Byzantine intellectuals in the decades around the year 1000. The history of Leo the Deacon marks a significant step away from the wooden moralizing that characterizes both the biography and the chronography of the mid-tenth century towards the more graphic and nuanced modes of depiction and portrayal that distinguish the best of Byzantine historiography of the following centuries.30 Leo the Deacon also displays a remarkable sense of professional ethics when he criticizes two eminent intellectuals at the court of John I Tzimiskes for interpreting the comet of 975 in a way that flattered the emperor and not as their techne required.31 The letters that Leo, bishop of Synada, wrote during his diplomatic mission to Rome are remarkable for the deadpan irony with which the author reports on his success in installing the emperor’s candidate for the papacy, the despicable Philagathos, at the expense of the worthy and rightful incumbent.32 Many of the poems of John Geometres anticipate the intimate humanism that makes the poetry of Christopher Mitylenaios and John Mauropous so appealing to the modern reader.33 The poems in which he argues that the pursuit of arms and learning should go together are eloquent pieces of thinking, or at least talking, outside the box.34 We should also note that he wrote several short poems in praise of the ancient philosophers,35 and his epigrams declaring that Constantinople has replaced Athens effectively add a new dimension to the capital city’s virtual identity as New Rome and New Jerusalem.36 Justinian and Romanos the Melodist would not have approved. These new expressions of creative and critical thinking in classical mode coincide with the end of the so-called encyclopaedism of the tenth century, 6\n\nF R O M ‘ E N C Y C L O PA E D I S M ’ T O ‘ H U M A N I S M ’\n\nwhose final projects date from the last quarter of the century and the very first years of the eleventh: the Metaphrastic Menologion,37 the Souda,38 the Patria39 and the Praecepta militaria of Nikephoros Ouranos. I do not think that the coincidence is accidental, and I would suggest that it represents the mode and the moment of significant transition in Byzantine intellectual culture. I have argued elsewhere that the encyclopaedism of the long tenth century, which begins with Photius, was a sustained, top-down, comprehensive programme aimed at consolidating the Triumph of Orthodoxy by the imposition of a national, Orthodox culture assembled from the legacy of late antiquity.40 In terms of the distinction that I proposed earlier, it was driven by the culture of Orthodoxy and its objective was to establish Orthodoxy of culture. The revival and promotion of classical paideia were an integral part of this programme, and its ideological purpose is clearly evident from Theophanes Continuatus’ account of the new academy established by Constantine VII: the emperor wanted to revive education because he knew that the praxis cultivated by rhetoric and the theoria cultivated by philosophy endear us to God; he looked after the students in his household; when they graduated, he appointed them to important administrative positions as judges and bishops, ‘and he adorned and enriched the Roman state with sophia’.41 In other words, classical education, just like the classicizing style in the arts of the ‘Macedonian Renaissance’, and the collections of ancient sculptures used to decorate palace buildings and gardens, was meant to give the apparatus of the Christian empire a traditional décor, to authenticate its return to the state of grace from which it had fallen in the troubled centuries of the Arab conquests and iconoclasm. In terms of the other keywords of Byzantine state ideology, the outer learning had an important if peripheral role in promoting the taxis and eutaxia that kept the πιστὸς ἐν Χριστῷ βασιλεὺς and his subjects in harmony with the Kingdom of Heaven and prepared them to ‘receive the King of all, invisibly escorted by the angelic hosts’ (ὡς τὸν βασιλέα τῶν ὅλων ὑποδεξόμενοι, ταῖς ἀγγελικαῖς τάξεσι ἀοράτως δορυφορούμενος).42 It is clear that during the age of encyclopaedism, Byzantine graduates were fully committed to working for the ideology of the imperial theocracy, whether in serving as bishops and civil servants, or in delivering occasional rhetoric, or in contributing to one encyclopaedic project or another. But it is also clear that as encyclopaedism petered out in the late tenth century, while they continued to write for the institutions that employed them, they increasingly set their own intellectual agenda, and used their intellectual skills not just to Atticize the image of the emperor and the saints, but also to entertain each other and establish a climate of complicity as well as competition with their peers. The medium was becoming the message. We can see this happening in the writings of Leo the Deacon, Leo of Synada, John Geometres and John Sikeliotes. The question is now, why did it happen when it did? 7\n\nPA U L M A G D A L I N O\n\nPart of the answer is implicit in the process of cultural evolution defined by Kazhdan43: this was the point when the revival of learning came of age; when the copying and imitation of ancient models gave way to a more mature and creative of use ancient idiom; in short, when the investment in learning began to pay dividends. In particular, the late tenth century was the time when the graduates of Constantine VII’s palace academy were rising through the system and would have been forming networks of sophisticated complicity.44 But palace schools had existed before, and had come and gone without any measurable effect. In addition to the process of natural evolution, we should pay attention to important events that occurred around the turn of the millennium. One, which was as important as its effects are intangible, was the millennium itself: the arrival of the significant anniversaries of Christ’s Incarnation and Ascension, which in the Byzantine calendar fell in 992 and 1026 respectively.45 There is plenty of evidence that the Byzantines expected these dates with apprehension. Their likely impact on the Byzantine collective mentality, and on Byzantine intellectual culture is very hard to assess. It was not the first time that the end of the world was awaited, and eventually failed to materialize. However, it is not unlikely that the unprecedented flurry of astrological activity visible under Basil II reflects increased attention to the movements of the heavens and to the incidence of planetary conjunctions that might be associated with cosmic convulsion.46 This is all the more likely in view of the fact that Basil’s reign was a lean time for other types of culture. I would re-float the idea that the ‘Macedonian Renaissance’ was itself a prophylactic strategy of putting the empire in order as a preparation for the end of the world in the year 1000 – or rather, as a means of averting, or postponing the end of the world. Given that according to all Bible-based apocalyptic prophecies, the Reign of Antichrist and the Second Coming of Christ could not occur during the lifetime of the Roman empire, as the last foreordained world power, the Byzantine leadership had a double incentive, during the run-up to the millennium, to demonstrate that the empire was alive and well, united, authentic and Orthodox. Alternatively and additionally, there was another narrative to adopt: the idea, which had circulated since at least the sixth century, that the Christian Roman empire was a different kind of beast from its pagan predecessor; rather than being the fourth and last of the transitory world powers, it was the one that would replace them all and last for ever, the Kingdom of Christ and the saints. All members of the Byzantine establishment had some kind of vested interest in subscribing to these pious hopes, which were implicit in the cultural investment of the ‘Macedonian Renaissance’. The existence of the pious hopes is not disproved by the appearance, in three works datable to the tenth century, of statements that contradict them. In his commentary on the Old Testament prophets, Basil of Neopatras repeats the assertion that the Roman empire is the Kingdom 8\n\nF R O M ‘ E N C Y C L O PA E D I S M ’ T O ‘ H U M A N I S M ’\n\nof the Saints in Daniel’s prophecy,47 but nevertheless insists that the reign of Antichrist will occur and must be at hand since the millennium is approaching, and the world is full of chaos.48 In the Life of Andreas Salos, which was published (or possibly re-issued) in an expensive new edition around the 960s, the saint affirms that Constantinople will endure until the end of time, under the special protection of the Mother of God, but at the end it will be hurled like a millstone into the depths of the sea.49 Andreas further dashes the pious hope, expressed in a question put to him by the narrator, that Hagia Sophia and the other churches will be spared: only the column of Constantine will remain above water.50 In the context of the ‘Macedonian Renaissance’, this response effectively negated any idea that cultural investment in tradition and taxis could be an antidote or a prophylactic against apocalyptic destruction, that the church buildings and relics of Constantinople made it the New Jerusalem rather than Babylon the Great. The ultimate (and perhaps imminent) destruction of Constantinople was certainly self-evident to the author of the Patria, one of the last tenth-century ‘encyclopaedias’, writing in 995. He even implies that it was programmed by Constantine, in the prophecies encoded in the sculptures of the Forum, the Hippodrome and the Philadelphion. 51 Here we are reminded of the invention, by another contemporary author, of the horoscope of Constantinople, forecasting for the city a life of 696 years.52 It is significant that all these anticipations of doomsday are expressed in texts without any pretensions to classical knowledge or eloquence. This does not mean that learned men were oblivious to doomsday. The preface of Leo the Deacon’s history proves otherwise, but it also shows that Attic discourse was not the right medium for writing about the end of the world. According to Leo, writing around the year 1000, it seemed to many of his contemporaries that the extraordinary upheavals of his lifetime – frightful portents in the heaven, unbelievable earthquakes, thunderbolts, torrential rains, wars, troop movements, mass migrations – were signs that the Second Coming was at hand.53 He decided to write about them so that they would not be forgotten in case Providence had decreed otherwise. So classicizing historiography was the medium for writing about events that did not prove to be the end of the world. It was the medium by which learned men distanced themselves from the mood of ‘apocalypse now’, and from both the fears and the pious hopes that it engendered. Leo the Deacon wrote his history for posterity, and also, no doubt, to be read by specific friends and colleagues. He did not write it for the reigning emperor, Basil II. In fact, very few people did write for Basil II, apparently because Basil II did not encourage it. This brings us to the other main factor that affected Byzantine intellectual life around the turn of the millennium: the lack of patronage. The encyclopaedic projects of the tenth century had been directed by two principal figures, the emperor Constantine VII and the quasi-imperial eunuch minister Basil the parakoimomenos, who 9\n\nPA U L M A G D A L I N O\n\nhad acquired wealth and dispensed patronage on an imperial scale from before 959 until 985, when Basil II sacked him.54 The void caused by the parakoimomenos’ fall from power is palpable in the literature of the next fifteen years: in the poems of John Geometres, in the vagaries of the Metaphrastic Menologion, in the Patria, and in the history of Leo the Deacon. John Geometres lost his job, and his Maecenas who rewarded him for writing encomia.55 The hagiographical project of Symeon Metaphrastes, having been commissioned by the parakoimomenos, was brutally terminated by Basil II.56 The author of the Patria pays discreet tribute to the parakoimomenos by mentioning that he had occupied the house originally owned by the fifth-century general Aspar – also a victim of an emperor’s purge brought on by resentment at his position as a power behind the throne.57 Basil’s house is again mentioned by Leo the Deacon in a clear expression of regret for the passing of the parakoimomenos. Writing about the shooting star that appeared during Basil II’s disastrous campaign against the Bulgarians in 986, Leo gives examples from history to show that such phenomena heralded the ‘total destruction of what lay below’. And he adds, ‘And we ourselves saw such a star descending upon the house of the proedros Basil, and, after only a short time passed, he departed this life and his property was plundered and looted’.58 Interesting here is not only the implicit identification of Basil’s fall as a national disaster, comparable to the rout of the imperial army, but also the implicit association between the fall of the parakoimomenos in 985 and the death of Constantine VII in 959, with which Leo the Deacon opens his narrative, noting that it had been marked, like his birth, by the appearance of a comet.59 The consequences of Basil’s departure from the cultural scene are nicely summed up by Psellos in his famous description of the situation during the thirty years of Basil II’s personal reign: Neither did he pay attention to learned men, but he held this sector of society, I mean the intelligentsia, in complete contempt. So I find it amazing that while the emperor had so little regard for the study of letters, there was no little flourishing of philosophers and rhetoricians during these years. I can think of only one solution to this puzzle that causes me such amazement, but the explanation, if I may say so, is most exact and true. This is that the men of that time engaged in learning for its own sake and for no other purpose. However, most people do not approach education in this way, but they regard literary culture first and foremost as a source of income, and study letters to this end; and if the end is not immediately forthcoming, they give up from the start.60 Some Byzantinists have wondered about the reliability and the exact significance of these statements. However, the idea that Basil II was indifferent, 10\n\nF R O M ‘ E N C Y C L O PA E D I S M ’ T O ‘ H U M A N I S M ’\n\nif not downright inimical, to literary men is supported by John Geometres’ bitter comments about the wicked Pharaoh who has condemned him to a cruel old age, and who, like the shameless citizens (of Constantinople), hates virtue, learning and success.61 To these allusions, which were pointed out by Marc Lauxtermann, we may add the testimony of the rhetorician John Sikeliotes, who flourished sometime between Geometres and Psellos.62 In his lectures, on the Περὶ ἰδεῶν of Hermogenes, Sikeliotes explains why he has not written a commentary on the rhetorical technique of Gregory of Nazianzos: it is not worth his while, and no one in power would appreciate it. I am not one of the well-off, but one of those who hardly survive on the basic necessities. I shirk the task. For suppose I were to analyse even just one of the most important orations according to the principles recommended by the marvellous Hermogenes, ‘Where is the wise man, where is the debater?’, as the sacred word says,63 where is there an emperor Marcus or Antoninus, or Hadrian, or a patriarch, or anyone who excels in deeds rather than words, to provide an incentive? But all [now], so to speak, are devourers of the people, who reduce their subjects to the same level of ignorance, as if they are afraid and ashamed of ruling people who are better than them.64 It cannot be proved that the regime in question was that of Basil II, but this seems likely in view of the fact that Sikeliotes criticized the work of John Geometres, and was himself criticized for this by Psellos, who refers to both in a way suggestive of familiar figures who were not his own exact contemporaries65; this would place Sikeliotes’ activity in the period 1000–30. Indeed, since Psellos had read both authors, we may reasonably conclude that they were among the sources for his remarks on the literary patronage of Basil II. Why did Basil II have such an aversion to classical paideia, which was not typical of Byzantine emperors, and especially not his own dynasty? It surely had something to do with his vindictive determination to erase the legacy of Basil the parakoimomenos.66 I would also connect it to the other singular idiosyncrasy of Basil II: his abstinence from marriage, and I would interpret both denials as the deliberate adoption of a puritan style of asceticism designed to make the emperor, and the empire, pleasing to God, at a highly apocalyptic moment. In this way, the millennium factor and the patronage factor may have been connected. Basil II does not come across, from Psellos and Skylitzes, as the sort of emperor who would have suffered from apocalyptic angst, but there are indications that the historians under-represent the conventional piety that went with the tough military image.67 11\n\nPA U L M A G D A L I N O\n\nWhat then do we make of the second part of Psellos’ statement, his explanation of the ‘paradox’ of Basil II’s reign? Did rhetoric and philosophy flourish in spite of the lack of patronage because the learned men were interested in learning for its own sake? Or was this just Psellos’ idealized view of the situation, a complement to his back-handed idealization of the tight ship of state run by Basil II? Again, some confirmation can be found in the work of John Sikeliotes, in the second personal digression that he allows himself in his lecture on the all-important Hermogenic ideal of versatility (δεινότης). Sikeliotes cites his own example to convince his students of the need to work hard to cultivate this ideal. We must learn by reading books, and train and exercise ourselves in writing declamations, and with great diligence research and think about how something is said, conceived, and phrased by an ancient author, and for what reason it is here like this, and elsewhere like that. We must do this even if the gain to be got from it is not obvious. For not to be sluggish, and not to bury the cognitive faculty of the soul in idleness and carelessness, is of great worth and befitting to a real man. Besides, if we are faced with a sudden need that requires us to write a speech addressing someone, whether in jest, or teasing, or for a serious purpose, we should not be at a loss and ashamed, neither should we bring shame on the reputation that we bear from being called rhetors or philosophers. For this is a great source of honour and pleasure, as well as renown. Sensible soldiers in time of war do not spend their days in dissolute relaxation and neglect their arms and drill, but they practise and exercise in warfare before the battle, so to speak, that they may be properly prepared in an emergency. So it was when I visited one of the leading senators. I thought myself unworthy to bear the name and fame of philosophy,68 since I was not being despised on account of my poverty and inglorious status, if I was considered to have nothing but the empty reputation. Thus I declaimed impromptu the discourse on the horse, and to another [senator] the discourse against the Saracens, not having prepared or planned anything in advance, but automatically, as if stripping off for a game. In the same way I demolished the myth of Prometheus with a wealth of philosophical and allegorical explanations of every kind. I might recall also my second imperial oration,69 which I was bidden to deliver at ta Pikridiou,70 and which began thus, ‘Speeches of address, O emperor, avoid lengthy subjects’. Yet I gained no advantage from this in life, struggling as I do with extreme and unremitting destitution, both I and my colleagues. I have related all this, not to promote myself, as the saying goes, ‘like Astydamas, woman, you praise yourself’,71 because there will never be anyone more undistinguished than me 12\n\nF R O M ‘ E N C Y C L O PA E D I S M ’ T O ‘ H U M A N I S M ’\n\n(anyway, I have spent most of my life in captivity and sickness), but in order to show that it is necessary to endure the labour of science and learning without payment, even if nothing profitable seems likely to come of it, so that we may study, read attentively and write accordingly, receiving the glory that derives from this as a sufficient reward.72 This is effectively a manifesto for the pursuit of learning for its own sake, which tends to confirm Psellos’ explanation for the paradox of rhetoric and philosophy flourishing under Basil II. Moreover, Sikeliotes himself evokes the paradox, in that he presents the rhetoric he teaches as being intrinsically worth far more than the material recognition it receives. He describes this rhetoric as politikos logos, and the social and intellectual claims he makes for it are not modest.73 He compares the parts of speech to the parts of the human body,74 and likens the skilful rhetor to a master architect or a great general: like they say Cyrus was, or Hannibal, or the ancient Romans along with the great Belisarios, so a rhetor if he is versatile – that is learned, wise, expert, faultless, a scientist and an artist, who uses the matters of rhetoric and their components to proper effect. The matters of rhetoric are those that maintain human life, body and soul, in war and peace.75 Yet politikos logos does not just regulate the material affairs of men, but elevates them to a higher, spiritual plane. ‘This is the real politikos logos, that which bestows legal equality on the forces of human souls, the intellectual cities’.76 Thus politikos logos in its highest form is politike episteme,77 and its highest exponents are politikoi philosophoi: after Themistokles and Demosthenes, the great teachers of the Church, Basil, Chrysostom, and, above all Gregory of Nazianzos.78 Sikeliotes quotes the Theologian on almost every page, and in more than one passage he explains why Gregory is the greatest – why Demosthenes, the model of politikos logos constantly cited by Hermogenes, had to be dethroned. Gregory was more appropriate to a society ruled by an emperor rather than a democracy.79 He had developed politikos logos into something new and sublime, because he had spoken about more sublime subject matter, and he had to win over a more varied, daunting and demanding audience. ‘[He was speaking] not to 1500 councillors, but to a whole imperial city that was like a second world; to consuls and top-ranking officials who were the masters of learning’.80 It is hard to escape the suspicion that John Sikeliotes’ sustained manifesto for the political importance of rhetoric was the fruit of his bitter experience of the dearth of cultural patronage under Basil II; that it was itself a 13\n\nPA U L M A G D A L I N O\n\nrhetorical construction formulated in response to the undervaluation of public oratory by the political authorities at the beginning of the eleventh century. Three things in this manifesto were significant for the future of Byzantine literary culture. The first is the elision of rhetoric and philosophy, techne and episteme, which puts the sophist on a par with the philosopher, and thus refutes Plato’s dismissal of rhetoric as an inferior, ‘shadowy’ business. Second, the art of oratory is advocated not as an adjunct to Orthodox preaching and doctrine, but as a civic, secular institution that deserves the patronage of emperors such as Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius – in other words, it is put forward as a continuation or revival of the Second Sophistic. Third, the supreme exponents of this ‘Third Sophistic’ are the Fathers of the Church, and above all St Gregory of Nazianzos, the Theologian. In celebrating Gregory of Nazianzos as the ultimate sophist, Sikeliotes was in one sense completing the Christianization of Hellenic paideia that the Fathers had begun, putting in place the final stone in the edifice erected by the culture of Orthodoxy after iconoclasm. In another sense, however, he was Hellenizing the Theologian by delineating Gregory as the culmination of ancient paideia, who realized more perfectly than the ancients the virtues and techniques prescribed by ancient theorists. There is no suggestion that Gregory had rendered those techniques redundant by his achievement as a bishop, a dogmatist and a saint; in fact, these roles are incidental to his professionalism. Or rather, they make his professionalism ideologically correct, and justify the inclusion of the ‘outer wisdom’, in which he excelled, within the Orthodoxy of culture. It was but a short step from there to arguing, as Mauropous would do in the next generation, that noble Hellenes, like Plato and Plutarch, should be spared the fire of eternal damnation.81 The way was also open for another man of the next generation, who had certainly read Sikeliotes, if he had not been taught by him, to aspire to achieve the intellectual excellence and influence of Gregory of Nazianzos without the episcopal career and without the sainthood. This was the not quite so lonely mission of Michael Psellos.\n\nNotes 1\n\n2 3\n\nP. Lemerle, Cinq études sur le XIe siècle byzantin (Paris, 1977).

It is presumably a reading of βασίλειον as a proper name that lies behind the general assumption that the emperor praised in the oration was Basil II: Conley, ‘Demosthenes Dethroned’, 146; Lauxtermann, ‘Byzantine Poetry’, 214. The probability that Basil was the emperor in question rests on the chronology of Sikeliotes relative to Geometres and Psellos.

He has left more than a thousand written treatises, large and small, in different genres, and more than 500 letters;2 but though many of these writings have autobiographical content, no even half-satisfactory biography has been written. His dominance is most complete in an active sense of the word history – the written transmission to posterity of the political and cultural history of his day, defining culture very widely. He wrote the most attractive political history of the eleventh century, the Chronographia, which today in translation is one of the most widely read Byzantine books. But he has also transmitted eleventh-century thought and experience in the following special areas: philosophy and its history, the occult (alchemy, witches, demons and astrology), precious stones, systems of belief (including Christianity), monasticism, literary criticism, grammar, rhetoric, education, medicine, law, music, mathematics and astronomy. The list is not exhaustive. The pretentious title of this chapter is intended to emphasize other features of the domination described. The first is its pervasiveness: Psellos did not win the 1962 Nobel Prize for Medicine, but he has an influence over the molecular structure of modern histories of his time that is more complete than that of any other historical politician and writer I can think of. What is more, twists and anomalies in the publication of his work affect every part of the subject of the present volume. Psellos’ reception has been distorted by two chronological abnormalities, similar but with significant differences, which have not only affected the way in which he and his work have been understood, but have left on the historiography of the period a deep imprint which will not be fully erased for many decades. 19\n\nMICHAEL JEFFREYS\n\nAs well as comprehensive breadth, his history also has depth. For example, the Chronographia is increasingly mistrusted as a factual record of events. Two or three other Byzantine histories are available as partial correctives for its defects in this respect. But different genres of Psellos’ own writing are at least as useful for the purpose. In his many encomia of major personalities, rhetorical distortion is more predictable and easily remedied than in the Chronographia. His letters all retain his restricted knowledge and point of view at the moments when he wrote them, and the attitudes they show are much more convincingly historical than parts of the Chronographia. Details of Psellos’ version of eleventh-century history are being replaced – but often by more Psellos. As I said, the laying down of these major strata of historical infrastructure has been disrupted in two important ways. Psellos’ history of the eleventh century influenced later Byzantine historians, particularly Zonaras, who incorporated bland summaries of events from the Chronographia in his own history, which was printed more than two centuries before the Chronographia itself. Skylitzes and Attaleiates both show reactions against Psellos. The Chronographia therefore, when it at last appeared in 1876, was greeted with disappointment, as it provided few facts or even opinions that were new. Crucially, since the story was familiar, the unconventional nature of its narrative passed unnoticed. Only recently have students of the Chronographia begun to question its purposes, leading to deconstruction of some of its narratives by careful comparison with other texts and the techniques of postmodernist criticism. This must apply also to the material which Zonaras took from the Chronographia, which is embedded still more deeply in the Byzantine historical tradition. Many other facets of eleventh-century mentalités covered by Psellos have been subject to a different distortion. Psellos was the favourite Byzantine author among the early printers, since his wide reading in ancient texts provided convenient access, sometimes the only access, to ancient wisdom on many subjects. Some eighty publications and Latin translations of his texts, large and small, were printed before 1700,3 a number which no other Byzantine writer can even approach. Renaissance commentators had to decide whether to treat Psellos as the last of the ancients or the first of their interpreters for the modern world. Writers of the Renaissance used classical antiquity to break down medieval rigidities and make better sense of their world, via earlier frameworks of thought which now seemed very new. Psellos, who had begun to make similar experiments in the eleventh century, provided useful materials for the Renaissance project, and even some hints how to use them. But his role usually remained a name, a shadowy link without historical contextualization. As European civilization moved from the Renaissance towards the Enlightenment, many works of Psellos were superseded by modern scientific thought and forgotten. The longest-lasting were those dealing with the 20\n\nM I C H A E L P S E L L O S A N D T H E E L E V E N T H C E N T U RY\n\noccult, where he retained credibility for a time. Byzantine studies then turned from what might be directly and practically useful to modern readers towards the political history of Byzantium itself, where Psellos’ contribution was made, as we have seen, first through Zonaras and others, and only later confirmed by the Chronographia. In the last century the singular project of Byzantine political history has become plural, as many human endeavours like philosophy, science and medicine have developed independent historical frameworks. Here Psellos has reappeared as a significant figure. But too often that figure is the Renaissance construct of an ahistorical link back to the ancient world. The Psellos of such histories badly needs to be grounded in the Byzantine eleventh century – a task made more problematic and difficult by the absence of any satisfactory biography to link different facets of his personality and work.\n\nThe Chronographia: delayed publication The Journal des Savants for 1874–6 contained four book reviews by the distinguished academician Emmanuel Miller, welcoming five volumes being published in Venice and Paris by a young Greek philologist, Constantine Sathas, entitled Μεσαιωνική βιβλιοθήκη (Medieval Library).4 The material of volumes I–III was of variable importance. But Miller stressed that IV and V contained major unpublished works of the great Byzantine writer Michael Psellos. Volume IV in particular published Psellos’ Chronographia, which had long been awaited. Miller summarized Sathas’ 119-page introduction to the volume, written in learned Modern Greek. I shall take from it what we need for this chapter. Sathas begins by listing first editions of Byzantine historians. We may pick out three: the huge compilation of Zonaras, published by Hieronymus Wolf in Basel, for the first time naming the eastern Roman empire as ‘Byzantium’;5 Kedrenos (nearly identical for this period to Skylitzes), published by Wilhelm Holzmann also in Basel;6 and Attaleiates, put out by Immanuel Bekker in Bonn.7 The political history of the eleventh century, before publication of Psellos’ Chronographia, was based on Zonaras and Kedrenos–Skylitzes, with additions made much later from Attaleiates. Sathas then gives a biography of Psellos, finally banishing a mistake that long confused Psellos studies. As well as the eleventh-century Psellos, a false earlier Psellos was created by misreading a manuscript note: he was apparently a monk on Andros who taught a wise man named Leo, either Leo the Mathematician, the ninth-century archbishop of Thessaloniki, or the emperor Leo VI the Wise (886–912). Both false Pselloi were made authors of some of his work. These mistakes were broadly accepted, and only corrected by years of effort. Sathas’ biography stressed the unity of Psellos’ life and work, and is still useful in other details, for it was Sathas who first published many of his texts. As we have seen, there is still no 21\n\nMICHAEL JEFFREYS\n\nmodern biography of Psellos, though the worst mistakes remaining in Sathas’ work have been corrected. The end of Sathas’ introduction lists attempts to publish the Chronographia. An edition was first promised by Combefis in 1672, but he died before it was finished. This sequence of promise and disappointment was repeated several times in the next 200 years. Two kinds of difficulty, as we shall see, have delayed its publication: the intellectual challenge of the work, and the unusually disturbed text in the manuscript which is the unique source for most of the text. Other publications of his works have been delayed by investigation of their very wide manuscript attestation: for example, it was only in the 1990s that a satisfactory canon of his letters was completed. Many works have only appeared in critical editions in an American project started in the 1980s by Leendert Westerink, linked to the Teubner publishing house.8 Other important works from volumes IV and V of the Medieval Library still await new editions, especially his letters and the long funerary biographies of the patriarchs Michael Keroularios, Constantine Leichoudes and Ioannes Xiphilinos. The first volume of the latter project is now complete, as is a major new edition of the Chronographia.9 The edition of the letters is well advanced.10 I have recently summarized Psellos’ letters, which are badly understudied, so I speak from experience of his difficult Greek. The letters are learned, but quite informal. His vocabulary is often straightforward, but one must watch out for technical philosophical and rhetorical terms, not all of which are immediately obvious. There are few elaborate periods; he strings simple clauses together with participles, but with minimal guides to the syntax connecting them. He makes readers collaborate with him to make meaning, solving syntactical dilemmas. Does a participial clause have temporal, causal or concessive force? There are often no markers. He frequently uses unusual word order to emphasize something, but what? Some statements are outrageous, or self-contradictory: do we need a question mark? Is there irony? Is he quoting a letter just received, or another text he has read and we cannot, because it is obscure, unpublished or lost? Is pointing in the manuscript any help? He compliments his readers by assuming they are as clever and widely read as he is. Most modern readers, especially myself, do not deserve the compliment, even when studying slowly with all the apparatus of modern scholarship. Usually we gradually solve the problems, and read highly intelligent and entertaining letters. Often we do not fully succeed, but still sense excitement from which we are excluded. Much the same was once true of the Chronographia. Now that it has been edited, re-edited and translated into most scholarly languages, its riddles are becoming fewer. In 1876 it was published by Sathas in Greek, with a Greek introduction but no translation. Thus the first impact of one of the best and most popular works of Byzantine history was disappointing. 22\n\nM I C H A E L P S E L L O S A N D T H E E L E V E N T H C E N T U RY\n\nThe text itself was part of the problem. The late twelfth-century manuscript Parisinus graecus 1712 is our almost exclusive textual source.11 The scribe’s hand is fairly clear, but his text suffers from all regular orthographic errors dependent on developing medieval Greek phonology (replacement of vowels, diphthongs and consonants by others now sounded in a similar way). He also makes many errors which look, bizarrely, like the result of dictation to a scribe who is hard of hearing. He often substitutes words which have a similar sound to what Psellos wrote, or words from the same root which are a different part of speech or in a different person or case, with a different termination. Often the error is a genuine Greek form, but it does not fit the sentence. Sathas’ job was thus very difficult: Miller described it as mucking out a new Augean stables,12 and Sathas did not do it conscientiously. He also used an informal way of reporting manuscript readings, not the formal apparatus criticus of a proper edition. Early reviews complained that Sathas was unprofessional and too hasty in publishing, appending long lists of uncorrected errors.13 Twenty years later Sathas published a second edition in the London series of J.B. Bury, improving the apparatus criticus more than the text.14 Thirty years after that, Émile Renauld published in Paris a new, two-volume edition with the Chronographia’s first translation into a modern language, French. His supercilious introduction again complained of Sathas’ methods, calling his edition ‘vulgarisation pur et simple’, mere popularization.15 Sathas might have replied (posthumously) that he had at least published a text, two centuries after Combefis and fifty years before Renauld. Renauld’s work was probably over-scrupulous in reporting every tiny variation of spelling. Reviewers still criticized his edition and especially his translation, so that disinfection of the Chronographia’s text has continued, and has now reached another climax with Dieter Reinsch. Thus one reason why reaction to the Chronographia was muted was a sense it was not properly published. A difficult text was edited informally and rather carelessly. Another reason, as we have seen, was its content. J.B. Bury, in an essay foreshadowing Sathas’ second edition, makes a complaint echoed by several later reviewers that ‘This history was so diligently utilized by Zonaras that the original does not supply us with any new facts of any importance. But nevertheless it is invaluable for many interesting details, not to mention that the work of a contemporary has always a flavour that no compilation can have’.16 The ‘contemporary flavour’ Bury mentioned has now been reinterpreted in postmodern terms. ‘Vulgarisation pur et simple’ has appeared again in the bibliography on Psellos. The most popular translation is that into English of E.R.S. Sewter.17 This is not a professional scholarly version, as Cyril Mango pointed out in a dismissive review of a revised edition (1966). He concludes ‘It is a pity that one of the most difficult of Byzantine authors should have fallen into the hands of a translator who is clearly an amateur.’18 Mango was right, 23\n\nMICHAEL JEFFREYS\n\nas may be seen from the translator’s preface, as well as errors of methodology and detail in the English version itself. But that amateur, by boldly translating Psellos and Anna Komnene, and having them incorporated into the Penguin Classics series, has sold far more books than any professional, and brought Byzantine words before far more eyes than read professional books. I am not sure what conclusion to draw.\n\nPsellos, rhetoric and literature At VI, 61 (Sewter, 185), Psellos makes the best-known learned reference in Byzantine literature. As Maria Skleraina, Constantine IX’s mistress, was out walking, one educated courtier whispered to another only two words from a line of Homer, spoken by a Trojan noble about the beauty of Helen, who was brought to Troy by Paris – effective though indirect praise of Maria’s beauty. To ensure that his readers got the point, Psellos gave Maria acute hearing and memory; she repeated the words exactly and later asked their meaning. Soon after, at VI, 65–8 (Sewter, 187–9), he uses a narrative technique that deserves to be just as famous. He is describing the imperial apartments, a curious ménage à trois in which Maria had first claim on visits to the emperor’s room, and Zoe never entered it unless she was sure Maria was not there. Because Maria is visiting Constantine as Psellos is conducting a literary tour for his readers, he pauses his description and is forced to spend time speaking of Zoe’s eccentricities. Later he loses patience and rouses the emperor and his mistress so that he and the readers can complete the tour. Warned by this radical device, we may look for larger complexities. As another example, Psellos seems obsessed by the problem of objectivity in treating Constantine IX, the emperor responsible for his own high position at court. He returns to the issue more than once in weighing up the emperor’s good and bad qualities. Efthymia Braounou-Pietsch,19 using postmodern critical methods, has shown that his concern was basically bogus, and that the text deconstructs into criticism of Constantine. Psellos introduced the problem with a wordy introduction (VI, 22–35; Sewter, 165–73).20 Later he ridiculed many of Constantine’s links with worthless courtiers, but in his final judgements (VI, 161–91; Sewter, 240–54) he placed many of Constantine’s silliest attitudes and actions on the positive side of his character, disorienting the reader and leaving a very poor impression of the emperor’s judgement. Similar methods appear outside the Chronographia. Psellos’ entry to a monastery was delayed by concern for his adopted daughter Euphemia. He chose her a noble husband, Elpidios Kenchres, enriched him and made a formal betrothal. But Elpidios proved ineducable, persisted in bad habits and loathed his fiancée. To break the betrothal, Psellos arranged a court case which he technically lost and paid a fine. In fact it enabled him to 24\n\nM I C H A E L P S E L L O S A N D T H E E L E V E N T H C E N T U RY\n\nremove from Elpidios the status given him, free Euphemia and keep a high dignity for another potential husband. All this is reported in an authenticlooking court document, formally composed, written by Psellos himself. Commentators have puzzled how a principal in the trial could prepare its official summary. It has recently been proposed – surely correctly – that this legal oxymoron marks the document as bogus, a one-sided statement of Psellos’ own case made more effective by its unexpected frame, but revealing its status to anybody who knew the rules.21 Stratis Papaioannou places great emphasis on another variation of Psellos’ narrative, his explicit modification of the narrative voice, particularly with regard to gender.22 Building on flexibility which is a traditional part of Greek rhetoric, Psellos repeatedly links himself to the feminine end of the continuum of gender, that which feels and shows emotion rather than the self-control and rationality characteristic (traditionally) of the male. Even the adoption of gender as a continuum rather than as bipolar absolutes shows originality. He speaks of some feelings – for example, his affection for young children – as deriving from his feminine nature, while in his philosophical work he feels more masculine. This leads him to regular complication of his rhetorical first person, a kind of ‘rhetorical transvestism’,23 which allows him scope for introducing much greater suppleness and enjoyment into the narrative process. This is one of the traits that make his writing seem much more modern than that of his contemporaries. It is largely a matter of degree: traditional Byzantine rhetoric allowed exceptional use of feminine pathos at given moments, while Psellos felt able to switch to his less masculine and less traditional side whenever the fancy took him. This flexibility has another side which becomes painfully obvious to anyone trying to translate or summarize his letters for a modern audience. They are dominated by the doctrine of philia, epistolary affection between males. It is extremely difficult to render Psellos’ work into a modern language without giving an impression that this relationship was homoerotic. Yet homosexuality was anathema to the Orthodox Church, and if Psellos’ letters had given evidence to convict him of such practices, his clerical critics would have seized the opportunity. There is no such criticism; in fact, he was satirized for failing to stay in the monastery through lack of female company.24 Philia has probably been documented and analysed more than any other Byzantine literary convention, especially using techniques derived from network analysis.25 The cultural dynamics of its sexual dimension have recently been splendidly defined by Stratis Papaioannou.26 Eroticism in much of middle Byzantine literature can be seen metaphorically as a series of performances of a conversation scripted between two loving friends, Gregory of Nazianzus and Basil the Great, hallowed by the sanctity of the two speakers. Psellos chooses vocabulary and patterns of thought to locate his philia safely within that conversation, though he characteristically challenges the genre by adding other words to stress the physical end of 25\n\nMICHAEL JEFFREYS\n\nthe continuum of affection, as against the spiritual. It is particularly hard to translate striking homoerotic imagery used as a metaphor for intense asexual philia, a not uncommon feature of past literary traditions. Unfortunately for the translator, such metaphors are now virtually inaccessible, at least in English, since homosexual images automatically enrol a text either in a discourse of condemnation, or proud identification. The pushing of such flexibility to its limits in every area of life is characteristic of Psellos. Papaioannou’s conclusion catches the essence: ‘What sets Psellos apart and is a consistent feature of his writing is his willingness to cross discursive boundaries and maximize the potential of rhetoric and his agility in activating a variety of beliefs and ethical patterns – often latent in the multifaceted discursive world in which he belonged’.27 This is an important, maybe decisive, stage in the creation of fiction, especially in Greek, marking a key step on the journey from the medieval to the modern conception of literature.\n\nThe occult Recent study of the occult in Byzantium has countered any assumption of its marginal status by stressing the high social and intellectual level of practitioners whose names have survived.28 Psellos is probably the most prominent and has the widest range. In some cases his role was vital in the preservation and continued discussion of crucial texts: Single-handedly, Psellos was responsible for bringing back, almost from the dead, an entire group of occult authors and books. Between the time of Photios in the ninth and Psellos in the eleventh century, one would be hard put to it to find in extant Byzantine sources any references to Hermes Trismegistus and the Hermetica, to Julius Africanus and the Kestoi, to Proclus’ De arte hieratica, or the Chaldaean Oracles, that is the classics in the field of mysticism and magic. And this was not mere name-dropping: A glance at the introductions [to modern editions] of any of the four works mentioned will reveal that Psellos was one of its few readers in the Greek-speaking middle ages or even an important source for the text itself.29 But wider influence was exercised by the De daemonibus, the Latin translation (by Marsilio Ficino) of Psellos’ Περὶ ἐνεργείας δαιμόνων διάλογος published in the Aldine incunabulum which is the first of the eighty early printings of his texts to which we have referred.30 It is a broad and accessible 26\n\nM I C H A E L P S E L L O S A N D T H E E L E V E N T H C E N T U RY\n\nsummary of Greek writing on the subject. As with many of Psellos’ works, its attribution is contested, but recent studies have tended to restore it to Psellian authorship, and the western writers who used it often quoted his name. The De daemonibus will serve here as an example to illustrate the importance of Psellos in the western Renaissance and early modern Europe, in the area of study where his influence lasted longest. This is the phase of his reception when readers were looking for practical help in comprehending their world. There is a wide-ranging analysis by Darin Hayton31 of western reception of the work. Hayton shows that this summary of ancient and Byzantine lore on demons and witches, in its Latin translation, was a staple of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century European debate, and sparked publication of the Greek original and extensive discussions of its accuracy and that of the translation. Verbal echoes appear in many literary works, including Ronsard in French, and in English writers as varied as Ben Jonson, Milton and Robert Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy. More general influence is still more widespread. Psellos thus (largely via Ficino) provided much of the vocabulary and conceptual framework for discussions of demons and witchcraft for both the Protestant Reformation and Catholic CounterReformation. This is an extreme example of the dynamic reception of Psellos’ work, but other facets of his authorship could bring interesting, though less extensive results.\n\nThe future of Psellos studies This chapter has pictured the development of Psellos studies in ways that include some obvious lines of development for the future. The evidence that Psellos provides for every side of the mind-set of the eleventh century will continue to be explored. The many variations of focus and even fact between his different works, written with different conventions, techniques and purposes at different times in his life will continue to be studied.32 The subtlety of the variations will be scrutinized and his multi-faceted authorial personality established with ever-increasing precision – or ever-increasing appreciation of its flexibility. Research will range over every subject that appears in his texts and all the centuries of late Byzantium and the Renaissance to show his influence in both synchronic and diachronic ways. But these studies at present have a seriously inadequate centre. It is not uncommon in medieval studies for important cultural figures to lack a biography. But the difference with Psellos is that there survive thousands of pieces of tantalizing biographical detail which obstinately refuse to cohere in any useful way. Psellos in a sense has many conflicting shadowy biographies. If one restricts examination to religious issues, he has been interpreted by the same scholar as a crypto-pagan writing to undermine the Christian assumptions of Byzantine society and as the major source of lectures for 27\n\nMICHAEL JEFFREYS\n\nthe training of learned Byzantine priests.33 Reconciliation of the two roles is not impossible, but troubling. Psellos has been portrayed as a devoted opponent of monasticism, yet his mother, his father, his wife (probably) and his closest friend and teacher all entered monastic institutions. He himself spent almost a year in a monastery on Mt Olympos, choosing it voluntarily as a place of asylum in political uncertainty: his persecution by the Church largely followed his exit from Olympos. He later was careful to regulate his conduct as a monk in the world. He ensured much more contact with monasteries throughout his life by investing most of his money in them by the charistike system. On a broader level, he made himself the central character of the Chronographia, giving the impression that he was constantly at the elbow of each ruling emperor between his first arrival in the palace and his death. But others of his own texts often show him far from the seat of power. The reasons that led him to write like this about himself are far from clear. Were they, for example, psychological, political or literary? Was he satisfying his ego, defending his record, or giving his readers a first-hand, close-up view of events? Or perhaps all three? The problem with Psellos’ biography is not its absence but its prominent, fragmented and disorienting presence. The authorial personality at the centre of his work is, as we have seen, frequently and consciously varied in a very modern way. But the specific historical context within which each piece of literary experimentation takes place may often only be worked out – if at all – by subtle and indirect arguments based on several different texts.
