The maturation of the work led to a book which deals with the development of the concept of holy war in the Piast realm. In this book, I trace the evolution of the idea of holy war from Poland’s beginning as a Christian realm in 966. I specifically focus on the period from 1100 to the settlement of the Teutonic Order in 1226 in the borderlands of Poland and Prussia. During this period, the development of the ideology of holy war into crusading breached the divide between pacifist Christian theology and the often violent reality of human existence. Medieval understanding of holy war rested on contemporary acceptance that the use of force was not inherently evil and in some cases, was in fact ordained by God. This reconceptualization of sacred warfare, the legitimacy of which was distinguished by the intention of those who engaged in it, facilitated the emergence of the idea of crusade and its institutionalized form of crusade.2 Before the thirteenth century, the difference between holy war and crusade is often blurred; it is certain, however, that whilst all crusades were holy wars, not all holy wars were crusades. How the idea of holy war took hold in Poland, how it conditioned the Polish response to crusading, and how the Polish approach to holy war evolved during the twelfth century are the subjects of this book. To help illuminate the 1 When referring to ‘Poland’ and ‘Polish’ I mean the region of Europe inhabited by a Slavic population known to others and themselves as Polanie and ruled by the Piast dynasty. 2 Riley-Smith, What Were the Crusades? (4th edn), p. 7.\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nevolution of holy war and the emergence of crusading on the southern shores of the Baltic Sea I will explore Polish history with particular focus on the Piast dynasty, their knighthood, and the Church. The diffusion of the idea of holy war formed a part of the transformation of Christian pacifist ethics into the adoption of violence in defence of the faith. The development of Christian ethics and doctrine took place over centuries and culminated in Pope Urban II’s proclamation of the First Crusade in 1095. Understanding how holy wars waged by the Piasts became crusades offers a contribution to the ongoing discussion about the specifics and validity of definitions of crusade, especially for the period before the thirteenth century. The Piasts, who accepted baptism as a pragmatic political concession, adopted the idea of holy war in the two centuries that followed and adapted it for their own needs over the course of the Christianization of their realm. Within a decade of the First Crusade, the Piasts embarked upon the Christianization of neighbouring pagan Pomerania, a war which lasted from around 1102 to 1128. In general, the idea of holy war influenced the expansionary policies of the Piasts which coincided with the proselytizing objectives of the Church as the conquest of Pomerania was recognized and actively supported by the Holy See. The Pomeranian campaigns also established the dynastic tradition of Piast engagement in holy war. By the time of the Second Crusade the Piasts had embraced holy war as a means of territorial gain, of eradicating the pagan threat on their northern borders, and as a way of gaining the acceptance and respect of Latin Christendom. They contributed armies to the three theatres of conflict during the Second Crusade: against the Wends, against the Prussians, and against the Muslims in the Holy Land. The Polish dynasty also responded to subsequent Prussian apostasy with punitive expeditions. Before the arrival of the Teutonic knights in the borderlands of Prussia, the elites of the Piast monarchy also supported missionary activity. It was undertaken in the 1190s by Cistercians from Poland and resulted in the Christianization of some of the Prussian tribes. The transmission of the idea of holy war and the emergence of the crusading movement was part of the wider paradigm for the transmission of institutional and cultural models throughout Latin Christendom. For Poland, this process commenced with the ruler’s conversion to Christianity in 966 and coincided with (and enhanced) state formation processes under the ascendant Piast dynasty. During the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Christendom witnessed accelerated economic development and cultural evolution, coupled with the growth of sophisticated ecclesiastical and political institutions. This period of\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nEuropean history is described by Marc Bloch as the ‘the second feudal age’,3 the ‘age of the cathedrals’ by Georges Duby,4 and the high point of ‘the civilization of the Medieval West’ by Jacques Le Goff.5 The period has been characterized more recently by Robert Bartlett as the ‘making’ and the ‘Europeanization’ of Europe,6 and by Robert Moore as the ‘first European revolution’.7 Polish scholars such as Marian Plezia describe Christian Europe in this period as ‘one body animated by a single soul’; Jerzy Kłoczowski describes it as ‘the younger Europe’; and Mikołaj Gładysz, as resonating with ‘the message of Clermont’.8 The transmission of the idea of holy war to Poland during the eleventh and twelfth centuries was largely facilitated by western European individuals who migrated to Poland, and by bilateral relations between the Polish court and its western European counterparts. Examination of the sources that record these events provides a fragmentary but coherent picture of contemporaries’ understanding of the idea of holy war, and the means by which the idea of holy war was transmitted to Poland. The sources also provide insights into the reception of crusading in Poland and its experience there. My conceptualization of the transmission of the idea of holy war is influenced by the paradigm through which Robert Bartlett explained the Europeanization of the newest regions of Christendom (the periphery) via their interaction with the established centres of power (the core). In examining the transmission of the idea of holy war and its agents, I discuss a process whereby the key agents of change (the clergy, nobility, and scribes) transplanted, recreated, or remodelled the institutions (conceived in the core) with which they were familiar at the periphery, where they had settled, in effect expanding the cultural frontier of Latin Christendom.9 Latin Christendom brought writing in the service of the Church, to Poland. This, amongst other reasons, is why there is significantly more evidence pertaining to the clergy and its activities than any other section of society. 3\n\nBloch, Feudal Society, trans. by Manyon.

This position was, I believe, influenced by Poland’s deteriorating relationship with the military religious order of the Teutonic knights following the Order’s settlement in Prussia from 1226.11 The impact of the idea of holy war on the Polish participants of the crusades has subsequently been under-researched. I have since come more into agreement with Smolka than originally. The Polish elites of the twelfth century were influenced by the idea of holy war and were active participants in holy wars in the region. The Polish elites were enthusiastic, if selective, supporters of the idea of holy war, and responded to, or made use of, its propaganda and ideology. Polish involvement in holy war followed patterns similar to those of the wider crusading movement.12 The motives of Polish participants were a mélange of deep religious fervour, the need for conquest, and intricate political manoeuvring. Yet crusading was never a popular movement transcending the ‘class divide’ in Poland and remained the exclusive pursuit of the ruling dynasty and the knighthood. An analysis of the experience of holy war in Poland is not possible without consideration of research conducted in disciplines other than history. I draw upon the results of interdisciplinary research (archaeology, theology, sociology and anthropology, and genealogy). Archaeological evidence and interpretations are important sources and are used here for an understanding of the pagan societies of the Prussians and Pomeranians.13 Theology has supported an examination of the way that Christianity accepted the use of sacred violence. Sociology and its theories of cultural diffusion are important for an understanding of the transmission of the idea of holy war from Christendom to Poland, and the adaptation of other elements of Christian culture from Latin 10 Smolka, Mieszko Stary i jego wiek, p. 65. Smolka’s opinions were echoed in the Afterword to the Polish edition of Runciman, A History of the Crusades. Zientara, ‘Posłowie’, p. 459. 11 For a detailed discussion of this doctrine see Belch, Paulus Vladimiri. Cf. Grodecki, ‘Polska wobec idei wypraw krzyżowych’. 12 Riley-Smith, ‘The Motives of the Earliest Crusaders’, p. 721. 13 Cf. Buko, ‘Unknown Revolution’; Urbańczyk, ‘The Role of Archaeology in Research’. For a discussion of one of the earliest references to Prussia found in the ninth century, Descriptio civitatum et regionum ad septentrionalem plagam Danubii by so-called Geographus Bavarus (where the Prussians are referred to as Bruzi), see Łowmiański, ‘O pochodzeniu Geografa Bawarskiego’, p. 10; Łowmiański, ‘O identyfikacji nazw Geografa Bawarskiego’.\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nChristendom in Poland.14 The influence of family traditions and the relationships between Poland and the leading dynasties of Christendom are themes central to this work, for which genealogy provides important sources.15 The available evidence is fragmentary and equivocal. Its analysis needs to be placed within the context of other sources, mainly non-Polish, which enable the dating of events and the identification of participants. This process allows for a reconstruction of the military expeditions which formed a part of holy wars waged by the Piast rulers of Poland. It also provides a view of the circumstances surrounding and directly influencing them. The borders of the Piast realm, the regnum Poloniae, shifted significantly between the beginning of the eleventh and the end of the thirteenth centuries. For the purposes of this book, the concept of ‘Polish territory’ is restricted to the area of the archdiocese of Gniezno and the diocese of Kamień, which was subordinated to Gniezno until the end of the eleventh century.16 This approach enables the investigation of the Polish territories as a whole despite the change of sovereignty of some of the Polish provinces (for example Silesia, and Pomerania).17 The first two hundred years of Piast rule saw the transition of the realm into a monarchy and the Christianization of its inhabitants (despite a major pagan reaction): the resistance of tribal elites to the consolidation of power in the ruler; and the opportunism of invading neighbours. The process was greatly aided by the Church, which provided models for and assisted with the establishment of permanent institutions of state.18 The transition from tribal society 14\n\nFor a detailed examination of the process known as diffusion see Friedl, Cultural Anthropology, pp. 374–75; Hiebert, Cultural Anthropology, pp. 416–17. The concept of diffusion also explains why geographically isolated societies change more slowly than other societies. See Nanda, Cultural Anthropology, p. 82; Murphy, Cultural and Social Anthropology, p. 223. As a result of Poland’s radical change in culture, its population came under the influence of a more dominant Christian culture. Cf. the explanation of such a process in Hoebel, Anthropology: The Study of Man, p. 660. 15 The most significant research concerning the genealogy of the Piasts was undertaken by Oswald Balzer and later by Kazimierz Jasiński. See for example, Balzer, Genealogia Piastów; Jasiński, Rodowód pierwszych Piastów. For a comprehensive overview of the state of research of the genealogy of the Piasts see the most recent edition of Balzer’s work, Balzer, Genealogia Piastów, pp. 1–28. 16 For a discussion of the conflicting territorial claims of the archbishops of Gniezno see Walicki, Przynależność metropolitalna, pp. 79–90. 17 For a similar view see Starnawska, Między Jerozolimą a Łukowem, p. 14. 18 ‘The Church under Rome was […] an institutionalised cultural unity, intimately integra­ ted into the power structures of the medieval west’. France, The Crusades and the Expansion, p. 5.\n\nIntroduction\n\n6\n\nto monarchy was achieved, I argue, by the end of Bolesław III’s reign in 1138.19 During this period the Poles began employing arms to support the propagation of the faith amongst their pagan neighbours (Pomeranians, Prussians, and Sudovians) and participated in crusades in Europe and in the Holy Land. The Poles and their pagan neighbours shared traditions which celebrated warfare and warriors. The spread of Christianity introduced the Latin language, writing, scholarship, and literature to the elites of Poland.20 These gradually transformed attitudes and norms of behaviour, and led to the eventual settlement of disputes by the Church through diplomacy and/or mediation. Wars fought by Christians against Christians were condemned by the Church because, according to its teachings, Christians should strive to secure peace with God’s grace. Wars against pagans were perceived as just because pagans disturbed the pax omnium rerum. Being part of Christendom contributed directly to economic development through the expansion of trade and the introduction of new military technology and techniques, and to political development through new forms of ecclesiastical and royal bureaucracy. Polish society became more stratified, and the regional magnate class grew in number, significance, and influence by replicating the behaviour of members of the dynasty. Poland’s development following Christianization led to the formation of structures comparable to the older regions of Latin Christendom. By the twelfth century, Poland had started the process of transition to an economy based on trade and maximization of the profits of agriculture, in stark contrast to its pagan neighbours, Pomerania and Prussia, whose economies were sustained by plunder and military gains. Polish rulers were unfalteringly independent, particularly with respect to the Holy Roman Empire, but they valued institutions successfully operating in Latin Christendom as prestigious and useful, and tended to adopt and adapt them (for example, the structure and etiquette of the court, state administration, and means of taxation).21 Their motivation was pragmatic and reflected a calculated, selective adaptation of institutions in political, administrative, and cultural fields. 22 19\n\nDeptuła, ‘Biskup i władca’; Zoll-Adamikowa, ‘Zum Beginn’, p. 233. Mews has noted the importance of literacy in the expansion of Latin culture within Central and Eastern Europe in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Mews, ‘Manuscripts in Polish Libraries’, p. 81. For a discussion of Latin literacy and its introduction into Poland see Dowiat, ‘Środki przekazywania myśli’. 21 Bartlett, The Making of Europe, p. 21. 22 Elements of culture are more likely to be adopted when the culture they come from is considered to be prestigious; see Murphy, Cultural and Social Anthropology, p. 225. 20\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nThrough adapting these institutions and associated practices, the Piast dynasty strengthened its position with traditional government structures of assemblies convened by tribal elders. The position of one singular ruler supplanted both the authority of the elders and the principle of rule by consensus.23 The example set by the ruling elites and the emergent apparatus of state became the catalyst by which the cultural elements of Latin Christendom were imposed on other strata of society. The adoption of Latin and the introduction of written records opened new communication channels between the Polish elites and the elites of Christendom, introducing the ideology of holy war. The time-frame for this book is between 1100 and 1230. It encompasses the reign of Bolesław III Krzywousty (the Wrymouth) (1102–38) and the period before the involvement of the Teutonic Order in the conquest of Prussia. The beginning of the period under consideration coincides with the First Crusade and the early activities of the crusading movement, and is the period during which the first references to holy war and crusading appear in Polish sources. The choice of the time-frame is influenced by a number of considerations. The period represents what I believe was the establishment of the Piast dynastic tradition of active participation in Christian holy war. It was heralded by successful subjugation and Christianization of Pomerania, and provided a model for future Piast conquests. I see this period of Polish history as a time when the idea of holy war provided the spiritual and ideological basis for the actions of the Piasts as these aligned with their territorial ambitions and corresponded to the objectives of the Church. During the twelfth century, Polish involvement in crusading underwent a transformation from the embrace of holy war against the Prussians, to crusades proper. The period also witnessed missionary activity by the Cistercians and Dominicans in Prussia under direct instruction from the Polish dynasts and the papacy. The period under study is bounded by the death of Kazimierz II Sprawiedliwy (the Just) in 1194, when the system of government established by Bolesław III in effect disintegrated and enabled the later ascendancy of the Teutonic Order. The Teutonic Order settled in Prussia in 1226 on the initiative of Kazimierz II’s son, Conrad of Mazovia. After that date, the Teutonic Order quickly dominated crusading in north central Europe24 and dramatically changed the scope and nature of Polish involvement in crusading.25 23\n\nKnoll, ‘Economic and Political Institutions’, p. 153. I follow a tradition which developed from naming crusading in the Baltic as the ‘Northern Crusades’. In this book I use the term ‘north central Europe’ rather than the term ‘east central Europe’ preferred by Polish historians. See for example Kłoczowski, East Central Europe, trans. by Garbowski. 25 From the thirteenth century onwards, Poland was absorbed by its struggle against the 24\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nSources In this book, I rely primarily on the textual evidence offered by two of the earliest Piast dynastic histories, the Gesta principum Polonorum and the Chronica Polonorum by Bishop Vincentius of Kraków. These Polish narrative sources are crucial to understanding the effect of the idea of holy war and crusade on Poland. They are richer than annals in information and supplement other sources by offering the details of events and consequences as seen through the eyes of their authors. The oldest is the Gesta. Composed between 1112 and 1118, its value to research into Polish history is comparable to that of the Gesta Normannorum ducum for the history of Normandy and England.26 The Gesta, written within twenty years of the First Crusade, is a fundamental narrative source and provides a chronology of Polish history focused on the lives of the rulers of the realm, although no precise dates are preserved in the text. As the oldest narrative source to relate the sequence of events of early Polish history, the Gesta became the source for later authors and historians such as Bishop Vincentius of Kraków (c. 1150–1223) and Jan Długosz (1415–80).27 The Gesta is an eyewitness account of the early reign of Bolesław III, a period which saw the consolidation of cultural practices introduced under the influence of Latin Christendom in Poland. It presents the dynastic programme of the Piasts, which incorporated state formation, geographical expansion of territory, and the conversion of neighbouring pagans. The Gesta’s third book focuses on Bolesław III’s military campaigns against the Pomeranians and Prussians. I will argue later that the Gesta reflects the ideology of the leading families of Poland who adapted the idea of holy war for their own purposes.28 I will also examine the text of the Gesta for textual references and allusions to elements of holy war and Augustinian principles of just war, the conceptualization of the pagans, and territorial aspirations of the Teutonic Order.

In the references to the Gesta, Roman numerals are used for book, followed by Arabic numerals for chapter, followed by page number. For discussion of the date of the Gesta’s composition see pp. ix–x. 27 The historiography of the Gesta is extensive. See for example Plezia, Kronika Galla na tle historiografii; Breeze, ‘The Crowland’; Kürbis, ‘Polskie Laudes Regiae’. 28 Grabski, ‘Polska wobec idei wypraw krzyżowych’, pp. 62–63; Adamus, Ideologia feudalna, p. 135, n. 92.\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\ncomparisons with works of historians of the First Crusade. It is highly likely that the author of the Gesta was a Benedictine monk who shared many aspects of his scholarship and literary tradition with the historians of the First Crusade, such as Baldric of Dol, Robert the Monk, and Guibert of Nogent.29 The second narrative source used in this book is the Chronica Polonorum by Bishop Vincentius of Kraków, first native chronicler of Poland. The Chronica Polonorum is the second oldest extant narrative source and follows the chronology established by the Gesta. Although the Chronica Polonorum places notably less emphasis on the ideology of holy war than the Gesta, Polish expeditions against the pagans (by Bolesław III in 1109 against the Pomeranians, Bolesław IV to Prussia in 1147 and 1166, and Kazimierz II in 1192 against the Pollexians) are related and described (in contrast to other military conflicts) as a mixture of punitive expeditions against apostates, missionary wars, and crusading engagements.30 The Chronica Polonorum relates the history of Poland until the decade following the death of Vincentius’s patron, Kazimierz II, and provides material with which to examine the extent to which the Piasts were engaged in crusading prior to 1194. In addition, the Chronica Polonorum provides insights into the culture of the Piasts’ courts, the Church, and society in general. Another key, albeit later source is the Annales seu cronici incliti regni Poloniae by Jan Długosz, the chronicler generally referred to as the first historian of Poland. The monumental Annales cover about five hundred years of Polish history, concluding just prior to Długosz’s death in 1480.31 Comparisons have been made between Długosz’s work and the Chronicles of Jean Froissart and the Mémoires of Philippe de Commynes. The Annales of Długosz are based upon earlier sources but provide a fifteenth-century Polish perspective on the events they relate. They cannot be relied upon uncritically and a measure of caution needs to be taken with their commentary on twelfth-century events. The Annales are nonetheless a valuable source and in particular provide infor29\n\nCf. Riley-Smith, The First Crusade, p. 138. Chronica Polonorum, iii:14, p. 99.

As in the case of the Gesta, historiography concerning Vincentius is extensive; see for example Grodecki, ‘Mistrz Wincenty, Biskup Krakowski’; Balzer, ‘Studyum o Kadłubku: I’; Balzer, ‘Studyum o Kadłubku: II’. 31 Długosz, Annales, ed. by Kozłowska-Budkowa and others. 30\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nmation about the dynastic traditions of the Polish monarchy, the experience of holy war in Poland, including details of expeditions to the Holy Land and to Prussia, and the plans of Bernard of Clairvaux to travel to Poland to preach the Second Crusade.32 Evidence relating to this period is also preserved in Polish archives and consists of annals which in most instances originated from within the court circle or the Church hierarchy. There are also charters and papal bulls that contain information about Poland and its culture which were written by outsiders. The predominance of a tradition of oral history, the introduction of writing in the later tenth century, and the destruction of these sources over the centuries, including periods of war and occupation, has had a significant impact on the availability of written sources. 33 My survey of primary sources such as annals, charters, and papal bulls, reveals that references to Polish participation in the crusades are found rarely, and they are usually brief.34 For example, a journey by Henry of Sandomierz to Jerusalem is reported in the Annals of Lubiń very briefly as, ‘Henry Duke of Sandomierz went to Jerusalem’;35 the participation of Polish troops in the Wendish Crusade under the command of Mieszko III is hardly mentioned by Polish sources but is related in the Annales Magdeburgenses.36 Other European sources which substantiate the extent of contact between the Polish elites and Provence (a contemporary crusading centre), are the necrology of the abbey of Saint Gilles in Provence 37 and the 32 According to Długosz, Bernard of Clairvaux was to visit the abbey in Jędrzejów after preaching in Speyer in December 1146 and January 1147.

These tables were introduced into Poland from the monastery of Fulda founded in 744 by Saint Sturm.

They are useful for cross-referencing the information from narrative sources such as the Gesta and the Chronica Polonorum of Bishop Vincentius of Kraków. One of the earliest sources, which contains information about the introduction of Christianity to Poland, is the chronicle of Thietmar of Merseburg (975–1018). Written in the first decades of the eleventh century, it provides a unique outsider’s perspective of the Piast dynasty.40 I have used the following sources to illustrate and complement my examination of the Gesta and its vision of the Christianization of Pomerania. They include, the Chronicle by Adam of Bremen, written in the 1070s, and the Chronicle by Helmold of Bosau (c. 1120–after 1177), which drew heavily on Adam of Bremen (before 1050–81/85) and describes missionary activity amongst the Wends.41 The same value can be ascribed to the Chronicle of the Slavs by Arnold of Lübeck (d. 1211/14), which was intended to complete Helmold’s Chronicle. 42 Similarly, the Chronicle of Saxo Grammaticus’s (c. 1160–after 1208), whilst a history of the Danes, also contains numerous references to the Wends and the Pomeranians.43 Another important set of sources which relate the successful missions to the Pomeranians are three variants of the Life of Bishop Otto of Bamberg. These sources provided me with background information which linked Otto to the Piasts. In my conceptualization of the conquest of Pomerania, the relationship between Otto and the Piasts is significant as he was a Polish court chaplain and is likely to have supervised the education\n\n38\n\nMiracula sancti Egidii, ed. by Pertz.

It was probably composed in the early 1140s only a few years after Otto’s death. It is generally known as the Vita Prieflingensis. A second Life was composed in the 1150s by Ebo, a monk of the monastery of Saint Michael at Bamberg, where Otto was buried. Both the Prüfening Life and Ebo’s are based on the information of eyewitnesses. The third Life, composed by Herbord, also a monk of the monastery of Saint Michael, was written in 1158–59. Herbord’s work is far more literary than the other two Lives and with its many rhetorical devices presents problems of interpretation.45 Among authors at the time of the Second Crusade, was Bishop Otto of Freising the brother-in-law of Władysław II Wygnaniec (the Exile) who included some information about the Piasts and Poland in his Deeds of Frederick Barbarossa and A Chronicle of Universal History. Again, these two sources provide valuable reference points for contemporary Polish sources.46 In addition to narrative and hagiographical sources, and correspondence addressed to the papal court by the local episcopate, papal bulls contain a wealth of information about the planned preaching of the crusade across Polish ecclesiastical provinces. Evidence also suggests that local rulers and the church hierarchy initiated their own crusading enterprises. A difficulty with the ecclesiastical sources is that, although the bulls and briefs refer to various mooted actions, there is no complementary evidence that they took place. Correspondence between the Polish courts and the Holy See, however, confirms beyond doubt that the idea of crusade was espoused by the ruling elites in Poland, and was present in communications between the papacy and the Piasts.47\n\n44 I use the edition prepared by Jan Wikarjak and Kazimierz Liman: Herbordi dialogus, ed. by Wikarjak and Liman; Ebonis vita sancti Ottonis, ed. by Wikarjak and Liman; Sancti Ottonis episcopi Babenbergensis, ed. by Wikarjak and Liman.

Its nature changed, albeit at a much slower pace, in a process analogous to the development of crusading across other regions of Latin Christendom. At the beginning of the period under examination, the warfare initiated by the Piasts exhibited the characteristics of holy war. Fifty years later the Piasts joined the theatres of the Second Crusade as fully fledged crusaders in the Holy Land but remained reluctant in seeking papal authorization for their holy war against the Prussians. In my conceptualization of holy war I follow Jonathan Riley-Smith in defining holy war as warfare ‘approved of and even directly commanded by God, who could intervene physically on behalf of his chosen instruments of force’.48 Christian holy war drew on Old Testament accounts of the victories of the Jews, recalled in the Church’s liturgy. The holy wars were waged at (what was believed to be) the direct command of God against his enemies and in the course of the twelfth century influenced the emergent idea of crusade. An early example of holy war waged by the Piasts against the pagans is, as I will argue, the Polish conquest of Pomerania (c. 1102–28). The Polish experience of holy war only subsequently developed into crusading ideology. It evolved under the leadership of the papacy at the time of the Second Crusade.49 A key concept which emerged on the basis of holy war was the idea of crusade. The idea of crusade can be characterized as the set of preconditions which provided the spiritual and ideological foundations for the later institution of crusade.50 The genesis of the idea of crusade is seen in the amalgamation of various influences, which are expressed chiefly in the evolution of the Church’s approach to war.51 The idea of crusade emerged as the result of the reconciliation of the pacifist roots of Christianity with contradictory pronouncements of the Bible about war, and the acceptance of a Christian secular militarism. It received endorsement with Urban II’s call at Clermont, yet its actual form took 48\n\nRiley-Smith, The First Crusade, p. 6.

The leadership of the Church could legitimately authorize military action when its premise complied with the set of Augustinian qualifications for just war: legitimate authority, right intention, and just cause.53 In the Polish context, I agree with Andrzej F. Grabski who argued that the conquest of Pomerania by the Piasts was motivated by the same reasons as the wars referred to by Paul Rousset as précroisade, a holy war but not yet a crusade.54 According to Grabski, as earlier for Rousset, précroisade or proto-crusading was a concept antecedent to crusading proper. It was a manifestation of holy war characterized by wars being conducted against enemies of the faith without either the explicit authorization of the pope or the granting of indulgences.55 The new phenomenon of crusade which began to emerge in the late eleventh century encompassed and combined the characteristics of holy war, pilgrimage, and indulgences. The act of crusading was known variously to its contemporaries as peregrinatio, pilgrimage, via, way, and iter, journey.56 Other terms were also used in various vernaculars. Participants in the pilgrimage were customarily marked with the sign of the cross and were referred to as crucesig­ nati.57 The distinct term crusade appeared only at about the beginning of the thirteenth century.58 In historiography, the late development of the term has contributed to a lack of agreement on a strict definition of the phenomenon known as crusade.59 52\n\nSee similar view in Mastnak, Crusading Peace, p. 50.

Riley-Smith offers a ‘pluralist’ definition, embracing a broader outlook in which many of the expeditions organized against heretics, pagans, or for other political reasons, were also crusades, because they were authorized by the pope on God’s behalf.61 Riley-Smith argues that contemporaries recognized a crusade by the requirement for participants to take a vow and to wear a cross, by the fact that the call for the campaign was made by the pope, and by the granting to the participants of certain privileges, including a special crusade indulgence. These elements, according to RileySmith, were essential to contemporaneous understanding of what constituted a crusade. Notwithstanding the differences in the approach to their definitions of crusade, both Mayer and Riley-Smith agree that a crusade was a manifestation of ‘a holy war, fought against those perceived to be the external or internal foes of Christendom for the recovery of Christian property or in defence of the Church or Christian people’.62 Jonathan Riley-Smith, in a number of studies, highlights the importance of crusading idealism. Riley-Smith argues that the crusaders’ idealism bridged the gap between spiritual renewal, postulated by the eleventh-century reform movement, and the theological justification for war. He explains how medieval piety and devotion defined crusading as an act of selfless Christian love, which directly obeyed the commands of Jesus Christ.63 Whether this popular view was a manifestation of a deep devotion, or a response invoked by those who preached the crusade is open to debate.64 I accept that there was a variety of 60\n\nBoth authors consider at lengths, arguments about the defining characteristic of crusade.

See also, Housley, The Later Crusades, pp. 2–6. 63 Riley-Smith, ‘The Crusading Movement and Historians’, pp. 1–14; Riley-Smith, The First Crusaders. 64 Focus shifted away from crusaders’ economic motives to the personal motives of\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\npersonal motives which led to participation in the crusades. I believe, however, that crusading occurred primarily as a result of the acceptance of violence by the Church, a consequence of the concept of holy war and its ideology.65 Augustine of Hippo (354–430) is credited with the formulation of the revised Christian response to war.66 Although the early Church denounced the bearing of arms by Christians, Augustine accepted the inevitability of war and stipulated three principles under which war could be legitimately conducted. Firstly, war must have been declared by a legitimate authority; secondly, it must be waged with the right intention (the intention to restore justice); and thirdly, it must be fought for a just cause (to remedy wrongdoing). The ideas of Augustine were later refined by canonists such as the Anselm of Lucca (1036–86), Ivo of Chartres (1040–1116), and Bonizo of Sutri (c. 1045–90). The collections of canon law compiled by these scholars, closely associated with the eleventh-century reform movement, provided further backing for the concept of just war and ultimate legitimacy for the concept of crusade (copies of these collections were made in Poland as early as 1103).67 The most significant study on the genesis of crusade was undertaken by Carl Erdmann. Many studies have reached broadly similar conclusions since the publication of Erdmann’s work on the idea of crusade, which shifted the focus of the debate from political and diplomatic factors towards an examination of the behaviour of an individual crusader, in particular his or her religious attitudes.68 Erdmann concludes that the idea of crusade was deeply rooted in the concept of Christian holy war. He points out that the phenomenon known today as the ‘crusade’ was in practice shaped not by the designs of\n\nparticipants, and the desire to take part in the spiritual benefits promised to all crusaders.

The issue is comprehensively covered in Russell, The Just War in the Middle Ages, pp. 16–39; Stevenson, Christian Love and Just War, pp. 1–11. Cf.

Gilchrist argues that Erdmann overstated the influence of the canonical collection of Anselm of Lucca on the events which culminated in the First Crusade, and argued that there was no change in the Church’s attitude towards holy war in the latter half of the eleventh century.71 Notwithstanding this criticism, scholars such as Ernst-Dieter Hehl, Grabski, Riley-Smith, and Janusz Trupinda adopted the Erdmann theses, and argued that the Church’s attitude to violence in the twelfth century was shaped by Christian theology, conclusions accepted here.72 An influential interpretation of the ideals, state of mind, and reality of the crusaders is provided by Riley-Smith. Significantly, he asserts that the message of Clermont was not far removed from the postulates of the eleventh-century reformers who wanted to ‘infuse secular life with monastic values’.73 RileySmith also observes that crusading was likely to have been less of a mass movement and more of an expression of religious, social, and political behaviour on the part of some interrelated families;74 my analysis of the sources to a degree confirms such a pattern of behaviour in the Polish context.\n\n69\n\nThe dynamics of the evolution of the idea of crusade were revealed by Blake who argued that the idea was ultimately shaped by the experiences of crusader pilgrims and the events which followed, and that of subsequent crusading expeditions altered the notions of crusade significantly on each occasion.

There also seem to be many apparently unpronounceable personal and geographic names. Careful attention needs to be given to the context in which works by Poles were written. Polish historians who published during the century-long partition period (1795–1918) wrote under Austrian, Prussian, or Russian regimes and may have consciously or unconsciously adapted themselves to the censorship requirements of the partitioning power. During 1918–39, when Poland re-emerged as a sovereign state, Polish historiography was characterized by nationalism and a desire to justify, promote, and support the independent existence of a Polish state. These tendencies can be found in contemporary approaches to medieval history, including crusading. After the Second World War, communist ideology underpinned the totalitarian regime of the Polish Peoples’ Republic and influenced all facets of society. Its impact on academia created an imbalance towards the priorities dictated by Marxism. This was coupled with a preoccupation akin to nationalism to validate the acquisition of former German lands. The post-1945 amalgamation of the ‘Recovered Territories’ into new Poland was often justified on the basis of early Polish ‘Piast history’. Since the fall of communism in Poland in 1989, there has been active reassessment of earlier works and perspectives and scholars now operate in a climate of academic freedom. Research into Polish participation in the crusading movement dates back to the mid-nineteenth century with the research of Mathias Bersohn and Stanisław Smolka.75 In particular, Stanisław Smolka has influenced generations of historians with his conclusion that Poles were reluctant to take part in crusades in the Holy Land. His research has provided a long-lasting interpretation of the Wendish Crusade and the Piast expeditions against the Prussians. Smolka examined extant twelfth-century evidence and persuasively placed Mieszko III Stary (the Old) among the participants of the 1147 Wendish Crusade as the leader of the Polish contingent. According to Smolka, the Polish knighthood took part in the Wendish Crusade on a wave of universal enthusiasm for crusading in the wake of the Second Crusade.76 He also argued that the motives of 75\n\nBersohn, ‘Kilka słów o polskich’; Smolka, Mieszko Stary i jego wiek. Smolka, Mieszko Stary i jego wiek, p. 253. A similar position pointing to the reception of the idea of crusade through preaching was expressed in Bernhardi, Konrad III, pp. 563–64. 76\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nthe Piasts were largely political.77 Among other episodes of Polish involvement in holy war Smolka identified the 1147 expedition of Bolesław IV Kędzierzawy (the Curly) against the Prussians as a crusade. Smolka’s arguments were to a degree supported by Stanisław Zakrzewski who has suggested that the Piasts ‘got away with nonparticipation in the Levantine crusades because the Poles invented their own Saracens in the neighbouring Wends and Prussians’.78 The conclusions of this book to a large extent confirm this observation. In the first years after Poland regained its independence Roman Grodecki claimed that the Polish knighthood possessed ‘an aversion to the use of force in the matters of faith’. Grodecki idealized the motives of Poles, and argued that Poles did not use crusading as a means of territorial expansion. In the spirit of his time, Grodecki’s stance conveniently reinforced Polish nationalist ideals, yet thirty years later Jerzy Dowiat categorized as a historiographical myth the position that ‘the Poles conducted only defensive wars because of their love of freedom, and that throughout their history any thought of military aggression was foreign to them’.79 The findings of my research to a great degree reflect Dowiat’s conclusions and also dispel this myth. In this book I build on and extend the research of Andrzej F. Grabski who analysed the idea of crusade and examined the presence of crusading ideology in the oldest extant work of Polish medieval historiography, the Gesta.80 In his detailed examination of the concept of the idea of crusade, Grabski followed Erdmann, Paul Rousset, and Michel Villey and concluded that the crusading ideology of the Gesta reflected the ideology of the court of Bolesław III. Thus, the magnates and the prelates, as the ruling elites of Poland, adapted for their own purposes the idea of crusade as manifested through the crusades against the Pomeranians, Prussians, and Sudovians. Grabski observed that the idea of crusade was not commonly known at all levels of Polish society, and that not all soldiers of Bolesław III’s holy wars would have identified with it. Grabski’s contribution to the debate is important because he drew attention to the impor77\n\nBogusławski accepted this hypothesis, commenting that the Piasts became a tool in the hands of the Saxon rulers. Bogusławski, Dzieje Słowiańszczyzny, iii, p. 572. Also, Grodecki accepted that the political support of the Saxon margraves for the Piast Juniors was crucial to them at this time.

Grabski’s analysis is taken further in this book and comparisons are made between the Gesta and the works of historians of the First Crusade. A popular theme of Communist historiography was the Germanization of the ‘Recovered Territories’ in the Middle Ages. A historian who cautiously warned against the oversimplifications of such a perspective was Benedykt Zientara. 81 Zientara’s study of the life of a Piast ruler of Silesia, Bolesław Wysoki (the Tall), examines Bolesław’s relationships with European dynasties, Bolesław’s exposure to the idea of crusade, and his role in the economic, legal, and societal changes of his principality. Zientara attempted to shift the focus of the research of Silesia away from presenting the Silesian Piasts as enablers of Germanization, and underlined the interrelationships between the Poles and the Germans during the twelfth century, and the position occupied by the Piasts as rulers supporting economic expansion modelled on European examples.82 The scholar who positioned Piast Poland as an integral part of Latin Christendom is Jerzy Kłoczowski. I am convinced by his argument that Piast Poland experienced a radical cultural change after its population came under the influence of Christian culture. Kłoczowski’s conclusions are vital to understanding the transmission of the idea of holy war to Poland and its reception there. One of the main arguments of Kłoczowski is that the idea of holy war and crusade was inherent in the acceptance of Christian religion in Poland.83 Through the acceptance of Christianity and exposure to the Latin clergy who ministered the faith, the Piasts and their knighthood were exposed to ideas from Latin Christendom. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, historians such as Mikołaj Gładysz, Marek Smoliński, and Maria Starnawska contributed to the discussion on the participation by the Poles in the crusades, and the settlement of military religious orders in Poland.84 Gładysz’s analysis is the most extensive both in the terms of the timeframe and the scope of activities covered. He examines the involvement of Poles in the crusades in the Holy Land, Pomerania, Prussia, and Sudovia 81\n\nZientara, ‘Bolesław Wysoki’. Zientara, ‘Bolesław Wysoki’, pp. 367–71.

His work is important as he considers the Polish crusading movement within the wider schema of European crusading, papal policy, and Piast foreign policy. Gładysz provides numerous hypotheses, one of which is, for example, in respect of the timing and circumstances of the pilgrimage of Jaxa of Miechów and the crusading activities of Henry of Sandomierz. Despite fragmentary evidence, often Gładysz’s enthusiasm for the subject matter renders the hypotheses risky as they are impossible to be substantiated. Gładysz also provides little comment on the transmission of the idea of crusade and the development of the ideology of holy war in Poland;85 the issue I consider vital for positioning the Piast realm firmly within the influence of Latin Christendom. The historian who has placed Piast participation in crusading within a wide social and political European context is Marek Smoliński. He presented the relationship between the Hospitallers, who settled in Poland and Pomerania, and their benefactors who were mainly Piast dynasts. Smoliński concentrated on the period between 1150 and 1315 and attempted to explain the reasons for the foundation of individual commanderies in Poland within the context of the foundation processes of the Hospitaller commanderies in Germany, Bohemia, and Moravia. Smoliński’s contribution is important as it reveals the involvement of the Hospitallers in Poland and in the politics of the dynasties ruling the region.86 Maria Starnawska pioneering research concentrated on the military religious orders in Poland and their importance to the crusading movement in the Middle Ages.87 Significantly for future studies, Starnawska analyses the inception of the orders’ engagements in Poland, the endowments of commanderies, and their location. She explores the orders’ engagement in the community through the network of preceptories which supported local parishes, maintained hospices and hospitals, managed landed estates, and took part in local politics. In this book, I agree with Starnawska’s argument that all of the military religious orders, despite their individual characteristics and particular aims, 85\n\nGładysz, ‘W sprawie udziału polskiego księcia’; Gładysz, ‘O zapomnianych polskich krzyżowcach’; Gładysz, ‘Udział Polski’.

Starnawska observed that ‘the propaganda of crusade conducted by the crusading orders reached the princes and ruling elites in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries’ as evidenced by the charters and foundations of churches. She concluded that ‘the reception of this propaganda by other strata of society cannot be traced in any sources’.88 My research confirms Starnawska’s assertions that the extant sources primarily recount events related to the socio-political elites. The actions and preferences of these elites were not automatically transmitted to other strata of society. For this reason, an examination of the actions of Polish rulers and the knighthood are central to our understanding of the reception of the idea of crusade. The conclusions of Starnawska’s research are extended here. I propose that the impact of the idea of crusade in Poland can be estimated by the number and size of the endowments of the military religious orders by Polish magnates. The identification of individual crusade participants is an important part of the historiography of crusades and crusading.89 In the 1920s, Michał Mendys investigated and explored issues relating to the identity of anonymous Polish princes who took the cross during the Second and the Fifth Crusade.90 Mendys has postulated that Władysław II, deposed suzerain of Poland, was the ‘King of the Poles’ who took a large contingent of Polish knights on the Second Crusade joining the German and Czech forces. The strength of Mendys’s work is his use of Polish, German, and Czech sources. By highlighting the identity, cultural values, politics, and background of the Polish dynasts, and their international connections and intermarriages, Mendys has provided some precision about the extent and nature of the involvement of individual members of the Piast dynasty in crusading. The Wendish Crusade is directly connected to the Polish crusading effort surrounding the Second Crusade.91 Its events have received, in varying degrees of detail, the attention of authors such as Giles Constable, Helmut Beumann, 88\n\nStarnawska, Między Jerozolimą a Łukowem, pp. 160–61. Riley-Smith, ‘Family Traditions and Participation’, pp. 101–08; Riley-Smith, The First Crusaders. 90 Mendys portrayed crusading as a cynical enterprise conducted for political reasons. See Mendys, ‘Udział Władysława II w krucjacie r. 1147’, pp. 399–434. 91 I refer to the Slavic tribes inhabiting the lands east of the Elbe and west of the Oder as Wends rather than as the Polabian Slavs. Cf. Helmold of Bosau, Chronicle of the Slavs, trans. by Tschan, p. 5, n. 6. 89\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\nHans-Dietrich Kahl, Manfred Unger, and Friedrich Lotter.92 These authors have touched very broadly on ideological issues, mainly with reference to Bernard of Clairvaux and the reception of his ideas, and have also examined the motivations of some of those who took the cross against the Wends. According to Stanisław Smolka, the Polish knighthood took part in the Wendish Crusade on a wave of general enthusiasm for crusading in the wake of the Second Crusade.93 Smolka did not analyse how and by what means the idea of crusade had become known to the Poles. He suggested that the motives of the Piasts were largely diplomatic, prompted by a desire for good relations with Saxony.94 Whilst Smolka did not place the Poles within the wider perspective of the preaching of the crusade, his study brought to light numerous episodes of Polish involvement, and is referred to extensively by Polish historians. Another theory was proposed by Zakrzewski who argued that by being involved in the Wendish Crusade the Piasts sought to prevent the possible secession of Pomerania from their suzerainty.95 Similarly, Marian Gumowski argued that Polish involvement in the expedition against the Wends was a calculated demonstration of power aimed at securing Polish rights to Brandenburg.96 Kazimierz Myśliński proposed that Poles participated in the Wendish Crusade only to support their Slav neighbours; the focus of Myśliński’s study centred on political aspects and diplomatic manoeuvring only.97 I propose, however, that the Piast Juniors participated in the Wendish Crusade to legitimize their victory in the civil war 92 Constable, ‘The Second Crusade’; Beumann, ‘Kreuzzugsgedanke’; Kahl, ‘Wie kam es 1147 zum “Wendenkreuzzug”’; Kahl, ‘Compellere intrare’; Kahl, ‘Zum Geist der deutschen Slawen­m ission’; Unger, ‘Bernhard von Clairvaux und der Slawenkreuzzug’; Lotter, ‘The Crusading Idea’; Lotter, Die Konzeption des Wendenkreuzzugs. 93 Smolka, Mieszko Stary i jego wiek, p. 253. A similar position pointing to the reception of the idea of crusade through preaching was expressed in Bernhardi, Konrad III, pp. 563–64. 94 Bogusławski agreed with this hypothesis, but argued that the Piasts became subservient to the Saxon rulers. Bogusławski, Dzieje Słowiańszczyzny, p. 572. For Grodecki the political support of the Saxon margraves for the Piast Juniors was crucial to their overall strategy at this time. Grodecki, ‘Dzieje Polski do roku 1194’, pp. 168–70. 95 Zakrzewski, Historya polityczna Polski, pp. 109–10.

The ‘Northern Crusades’ (in Pomerania and Prussia along the Baltic littoral) are explored by a number of historians such as Iben FonnesbergSchmidt, Hans-Dietrich Kahl, Janus Møller Jensen, Kurt Villads Jensen, Edgar Johnson, John Lind, William Urban, Tore Nyberg, and Eric Christiansen. 99 Most of these studies treat crusading by the Poles before 1200, peripherally. An exception is Lind who discusses Polish crusading in the context of crusading on the Baltic rim.100 There is no work published in English which explores the nature of the wars between the Poles and their northern neighbours before the arrival of the Teutonic Order. * * * My views on the evolution of the idea of holy war in the twelfth-century Poland have evolved over a period of research on the medieval realm of the Piasts. I argue in this book and in my other publications that the Polish elites were fervent supporters of Christian holy war and later on participants in the crusades. However, readers will need to decide for themselves if the wars conducted by the members of the Piast dynasty against the Pomeranians, Prussians, and Wends were manifestations of Christian holy war or wars of expansion. My interpretation of the evidence has convinced me that these wars were genuine holy wars even though the Piasts used the idea of holy war to further their own policy agenda. 98\n\nFor Józef Mitkowski, it was the importance of securing Polish interests in the region.

There is also important research by Włodarski which revealed that the Poles were involved in numerous expeditions which also aimed at Christianizing the Sudovians. Sudovia’s location between Prussia, Poland, and Lithuania, made it a target for conquest by all its neighbours.

In 1099, the realm of the Piasts, had been nominally Christian for only one hundred and thirty years. It is fair to assume that the Piasts’ subjects were not yet fully Christianized. The examples of individuals taking the cross were exceptional and restricted to the elites and the members of the ruling house.\n\nThe Present Study This book is divided into seven chapters which present the argument and evidence to support the study. Chapters 1 and 2 present the early history of Poland and explain the growth of power of the Piast dynasty and the expansion of their realm. I concentrate on the period between the baptism of Mieszko I in 966 to the death of Władysław I Herman in 1102. In explaining the long process of the Christianization of Poland, I present the background and the reasons for the involvement of the Piasts in Christian holy war and crusading. These two chapters set the scene for an examination of the evolution of the ideology of holy war, through examination of the processes which facilitated the reception of the idea of holy war in Poland. These two chapters also discuss the introduction of Christianity into Poland, and its profound influence on the Piast realm and its culture. I examine how the reception of Latin Christianity exposed Polish elites to its ideas and culture and helped transmit the idea of holy war and its ideology. The Christianization of Poland had a close connection to state formation and the strengthening of nationhood, and was closely linked with the growth of ecclesiastical organization. I argue in these two chapters, that a reciprocal relationship developed between the Piast dynasty and the Church at the end of the eleventh and the beginning of the twelfth century, which directly contributed to the vigour with which holy war was pursued by Polish rulers. In Chapter 3, I examine the adaptation of the idea of holy war. This chapter traces the dissemination of the idea of holy war within Polish elites of the early twelfth century and examines ‘the right and just’ wars waged by Bolesław III against the Pomeranians as examples of holy wars and at the same time examples of proto-crusades. Through examination of the Gesta, I focus on Bolesław III. I argue that this Piast largely instigated the acceptance of the idea of holy war in Poland, inspired its emulation amongst elites, and established the tradition which was enshrined by Gallus in his Gesta, an ‘instruction manual’ for knightly classes to follow. Bolesław III’s actions and reputation were crucial to the proliferation of the idea of holy war. They led to the establishment of a Piast family tradition of expanding the frontiers of Latin Christendom.\n\n26\n\nIntroduction\n\nChapter 4 outlines the events of the civil war between Władysław II and his younger half-brothers in the lead up to the Wendish Crusade and analyses the circumstances of Polish involvement. It presents Piast involvement in the Wendish Crusade as a consequence of first — a Piast family tradition of active participation in the holy war established by Bolesław III, and second — as an outcome of the political isolation of the Piast Juniors. The Piast Juniors sought to legitimize and consolidate their usurpation of power in Poland in the aftermath of the coup of 1146 which deposed Władysław II. The participation of Mieszko III as a leader of the Polish contingent on the Wendish Crusade was the result of an alliance between the Piast Juniors and the Saxon dynasts, and was intended to be a show of Polish strength. Chapter 5 examines the evidence that the Poles were not only involved in the Second Crusade, but also contributed at least one significant crusading army to it. It examines the reference by John Kinnamos to the ‘King of the Poles’ as the leader of an army during the Second Crusade. I present my hypothesis which links this reference to Henry of Sandomierz, a devout crusader knight from Poland who later personally established commanderies of the military religious orders in his dominion. This chapter hypothesizes the extent to which Poles participated in the crusades through the study of the lives of Polish dynasts and their interaction with the leading figures of the European crusading movement. It also explores and evaluates the similarities and differences between the experience of crusading in Poland and Western Europe. Chapter 6 continues to explore Polish participation in Christian holy war and unearths the expedition led by Bolesław IV in the autumn of 1147 into the lands of the Prussians — a military operation unreported in English-language historiography. I argue that the expedition was part of the Polish response to the preaching of the Second Crusade. It is likely that the indulgences granted by the papacy for crusading against the Wends and other pagans inhabiting the north were understood by Polish contemporaries to include crusading against the Prussians in 1147. In this chapter, I introduce the hitherto unreported Polish expedition of 1166 against the Prussians and a subsequent holy war in 1192 against the Prussian tribe of Pollexians. Chapter 7 outlines the attempts by the Cistercian Order to achieve the conversion of Prussia through missionary activity against the backdrop of the political fragmentation of the Piast patrimony. The resulting lack of unity between the Piast princes and lack of co-ordination in conducting holy war against the Prussians brings about a change in strategy. The chapter analyses the events leading up to 1230 and the advent of the crusades against the Prussians.\n\nIntroduction\n\n27\n\nThese were initially conducted by the Piasts, and later by the Danes, and finally by the Teutonic Order. This chapter also examines the settlement of military religious orders in Poland, their activities, and their participation in the wider crusading movement. Some additional information is presented in the appendices.\n\nNames and Conventions Used in this Book There is no uniform translation of Polish names of the provinces into English and indeed it can be questioned why such a translation needs to be made. In this book, I decided to use English terms for Polish historical provinces. I use the terms Greater Poland rather than Great Poland (Polish: Wielkopolska, Latin: Polonia Maior), Lesser Poland rather than Little Poland (Polish: Małopolska, Latin: Polonia Minor), Sandomierz (Latin: Sandomiria, German: Sandomir), Pomerelia (German: Pommerellen, Polish: Pomorze Gdańskie or Pomorze Wschodnie), Pomerania (Polish: Pomorze, German: Pommern, Latin: Pomerania or Pomorania), and Prussia (German: Prußen, Latin: Borussia, Prutenia, Polish: Prusy). For the Polish rulers, I provide their full Polish name together with their nickname in Polish which is then translated, but on subsequent use I only use their translated nickname. Thus on the first use ‘Bolesław I Chrobry (the Brave)’ and subsequently ‘Bolesław I the Brave’ or ‘Bolesław I’. The only exception is Henryk Sandomierski who in this book is consequently referred to as ‘Henry of Sandomierz’. There are two conventions of Polish historiography which I also need to explain here. The author of the Gesta principum Polonorum is almost always referred to by Polish authors as Gall Anonim (Gallus Anonymous). This is simply a matter of convention as the author cannot be identified. I decided to follow this established convention and refer to him as Gallus. Similarly, the author of the Chronica Polonorum is referred to in Polish historiography as Mistrz Wincenty zwany Kadłubkiem (Master Vincentius called Kadłubek) or Mistrz Wincenty Kadłubek (Master Vincentius Kadłubek). I prefer to refer to this historian and chronicler as ‘Bishop Vincentius of Kraków’ as he was elected bishop of Kraków. The use of the highly dubious patronymic Kadłubek only complicates the issue of the author’s identity.\n\nIntroduction\n\n28\n\nPolish Language Polish names and words may appear difficult but their pronunciation is consistent. All vowels are simple and of even length, as in Italian, and their sound is best rendered by the English words ‘sum’ (a), ‘ten’ (e), ‘ease’ (i), ‘lot’ (o), ‘book’ (u), ‘sit’ (y). Most of the consonants behave the same way as in English, except for ‘c’ (which is pronounced ‘ts’), ‘j’ (which is soft as in ‘yes’), and ‘w’ (which is equivalent to the English ‘v’). As in German, some consonants are softened when they fall at the end of a word and ‘b’, ‘d’, ‘f ’, ‘w’, ‘z’ became ‘p’, ‘t’, ‘k’, ‘f ’, ‘s’ respectively. There are also a number of accented letters and combinations peculiar to Polish of which the following is a rough list:\n\nó u, hence Kraków is pronounced ‘krakooff ’.\n\ną nasal a, hence sąd is pronounced ‘sont’.\n\nę nasal e, as ‘in’ in French ‘enfin’, hence Łęczyca is pronounced ‘winchytsa’.\n\nć ch as in ‘cheese’.\n\ncz ch as in ‘catch’.\n\nch guttural h as in ‘loch’.\n\nł English w, hence Bolesław becomes ‘Boleswaf ’, Władysław ‘Vwadiswaf ’.\n\nń soft n as in Spanish ‘mañana’.\n\nrz French j as in ‘je’.\n\nś sh as in ‘sheer’.\n\nsz sh as in ‘bush’.\n\nż as rz\n\nź a similar sound to ż, but sharper, as in French ‘gigot’\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Expansion of the Piast Realm, 960–1100\n\nB\n\nefore the middle of the tenth century a West Slav tribe of Polanie established their realm in the basin of the Oder River. Under the leadership of a succession of warlords from whom the ruling dynasty of Poland later claimed descent, the Polanie successfully conquered the lands of neighbouring tribes in an aggressive territorial expansion. In 966, the ruler of the Polanie Mieszko I converted to Christianity. At a stroke, the ruling Piast dynasty removed itself as a target for forceful conversion by its Christian neighbours, was granted the patronage and protection of the pope, and brought Poland into the sphere of the civilization of Latin Christendom. The motives for and methods by which Christianity came to Poland are significant: conversion was an act of expediency in the face of expansionist Latin Christendom and was orchestrated via the dynastic instrument of marriage in order to seal an alliance with others recently converted to Christianity, the Přemyslid dynasty of Bohemia.1 The Piasts’ subsequent policies and actions reveal a fundamental shift towards the religious, administrative, and political models offered by Latin Christendom. Furthermore, they attest to the continued importance of family relationships and tradition in matters of faith and state, and demonstrate how the assimilation of the idea of holy war was intrinsic to the acceptance of Christianity in Poland. * * * 1\n\nThietmari Merseburgensis, ed. by Jedlicki, iv:56, pp. 221–23.

It explains the growth of the power of the Piast dynasty and the territorial expansion of their realm. It concentrates on the period between the baptism of Mieszko I in 966 and the death of Władysław I Herman in 1102. It presents the complicated process of the Christianization of Poland as a backdrop to the involvement of the Piasts in Christian holy war and crusading. An examination of the early history of the Piasts sets the scene for an examination of the evolution of the ideology of holy war. * * *\n\nThe Expansion of the Piast Realm, 960–1100\n\n31\n\nMuch of what is known about the Slavic tribes ruled by Mieszko I and the growth of the early Piast state is based upon archaeological evidence. 2 The realm first appears in written sources shortly before Mieszko’s baptism. The lands controlled by the Piast ruler were located far from the major European trading routes and the centres of early medieval Europe. Mieszko (d. 992) was the head of the Piast dynasty, whose name is derived from the family’s mythical founder, a ploughman named Piast. The origins of the dynasty’s name Piast has been a subject of much speculation. Whilst most historians accept that it represents the Old Polish word meaning ‘to nourish’ or ‘to hold’ the description of the Polish dynasty as the ‘house of Piast’ does not appear in other medieval sources and it seems to have been coined in the sixteenth century, apparently by Bishop Marcin Kromer (1512–89).3 Under the leadership of the Piasts the Polanie, whose tribal name literally means ‘people of the plains’, emerged as the most powerful of the numerous West Slav tribes settled on the plains between the Oder and Vistula Rivers.4 Before the 960s, the Piasts had united the kin-based tribal societies of the region including the Vistulans who had been Christianized earlier, probably by Saint Methodius. By the end of his reign, Mieszko’s realm encompassed Greater Poland, Lesser Poland, Mazovia, Silesia, and Pomerania with the fortified stronghold of Gniezno at its centre.5 The expansionary policy of the early Piast rulers such as Mieszko I was based on a strong and well organized military. The warriors were recruited from the Piasts’ free subjects and were paid for their service. The military contingents were stationed across Piast controlled territories and archaeological evidence suggests that the Piasts built strongholds across the new territories to accommodate the growing military force. These strongholds would have been both a visible symbol of the Piasts’ territorial conquest as well as a safeguard for their acquisitions. 2\n\nSee in general, Buko, The Archaeology of Early Medieval Poland, pp. 55–106.

See for example, Sancti Adalberti Pragensis episcopi et martyris vita altera auctore, ed. by Karwasińska, x, p. 8; xxx, p. 35; Thietmari Merseburgensis, ed. by Jedlicki, v:23, p. 283; v:34, p. 299; vi:10, p. 329; viii:31, p. 621. 5 Kurnatowska, ‘Proces formowania’; Wasilewski, ‘Poland’s Administrative Structure’. 3\n\nChapter 1\n\n32\n\nArchaeological evidence suggests that the Piast forces included mercenaries or allies and significant numbers of Viking warriors, as Viking relics have been found across Pomerania and Greater Poland. Close family relationships between the Piasts and the rulers of Scandinavia may explain the Viking presence in the military forces of Mieszko I. Mieszko’s daughter Świętosława (Sigríð) (d. after 1014) was the wife of the ruler of Sweden, Eric the Victorious (d. c. 995), and later married Sweyn I Forkbeard of Denmark (d. 1014), and was the mother of Canute the Great (c. 985/95–1035).6 There are few written sources which can shed light on the early period of the rule of the Piast dynasty, particularly prior to the accession of Mieszko I.7 One account is by Ibrahim Ibn Jakub, a merchant who travelled through central Europe in 961–62.8 According to Ibn Jakub, Mieszko’s land was: The most expansive of the [Slavs’] lands and it has an abundance of food, meat, honey, and arable land. Mieszko’s taxes […] go for the pay of his warriors. Every month every one of them receives a fixed sum. He has three thousand armoured warriors divided into units and every hundred of them is equal to ten hundred others, and Mieszko gives these men their clothes, horses, armour, and everything they need. If to one of them a child is born, he orders that it be paid a [warriors’] pay from the moment it was born, whether the child is of male or female sex. When the child grows up, then, if it is a man, he will marry him off and will pay a dowry for him to the [bride’s] father. If it is a girl, then he will give her in marriage and will pay a dowry for her to the [groom’s] father. […] If some man has two or three daughters, then this is the cause of his wealth. If he has two sons, then this is the cause of his poverty.9\n\nIbrahim Ibn Jakub’s description of the lands ruled by the ‘king of the north’ concentrates on Mieszko’s warriors, highlighting the martial reputation of the leader of the Poles. Such a characterization of the Piasts suggests, somewhat, the reasons why they were successful in establishing a powerful state with the support of a well organized warrior caste. The reference to Mieszko as the ‘king 6\n\nThietmari Merseburgensis, ed. by Jedlicki, vii:39, p. 523; Cnutonis Regis Gesta, ed. by Peitz, ii:2, p. 515. 7 Kóčka-Krenz, ‘Piast State Formation’; Buko, ‘From Great Poland to Little Poland’. 8 This passage is the first reliable description of Mieszko’s realm.

The lack of written sources for the early history of the Piast realm was possibly a source of concern to the elites of the Piast realm, who by the end of the twelfth century are likely to have recognized that this set them apart from their western European counterparts. In the early twelfth century an anonymous monk in the service of the Piast court, conventionally known as Gallus, was commissioned to write the Gesta. His Gesta records the valiant deeds of his patron and descendant of Mieszko I, Bolesław III the Wrymouth. In his work Gallus explains that his lack of information about the origins of the Piast dynasty is due to there being no one alive to remember them, pointing to the dynasty’s reliance on the preservation of oral traditions. The monk began his Gesta with the earliest of the Piasts, but devotes more attention to Mieszko I,\n\nChapter 1\n\n34\n\nbecause he says information on this ruler was still alive in the memory of his informers. The circumstances surrounding Mieszko’s conversion to Latin Christianity are hotly debated. There are significant problems with accounts in Polish annals and their chronology, and the supporting evidence raises more questions. Yet, whatever Mieszko’s motives, his decision to convert to Christianity was an astute political act which cemented an important alliance with the ruler of Bohemia and simultaneously provided Mieszko with laudable justification to subjugate his pagan neighbours. That Mieszko chose baptism from a Bohemian missionary, may indicate that he sought to limit the political influence of the expanding, mission-focused German Church. Likewise Mieszko’s choice ensured that the first Polish bishopric, founded in 968 in Poznań, was subordinated directly to the conveniently distant, but undeniably supreme authority of Rome.10 The earliest sources highlight the significance of Mieszko I’s Christian wife, Dobrava, daughter of Boleslav I of Bohemia. 11 The Chronicle written by Thietmar of Merseburg between 1012 and 1018 presents a contemporary account of the event: Upon the incessant pleadings of his beloved wife, [Mieszko] spewed out the poison of paganism into which he was born and cleansed the stigma of the original sin in holy baptism, and immediately the previously infirm members of the populace followed their chief and beloved ruler and, clad in nuptial garments, were counted among the children of Christ.12\n\nMieszko’s wife Dobrava of Bohemia is credited with being the catalyst for the conversion which hints at the influence and potential political power of women within the dynasty. This idealistic account which conveys Thietmar’s vision of the baptism of Poland includes the allegorical simultaneous conversion of the whole popula10\n\nSee in general Piskorski, Civitas Schinesghe. ‘Dubrouka venit ad Miskonem’, ‘Mysko dux baptizatur.’ Rocznik dawny, ed. by KozłowskaBudkowa, pp. 4–5. ‘Dubrouka ad Meskonem venit’, ‘Mesco dux Polonie baptizatur.’ Annales Cracovienses priores, ed. by Kozłowska-Budkowa, p. 43.

But when his seventh birthday came around […] it became clear that the blind boy had recovered his sight […] The older and wiser among [said that] the explanation was that as he had once been blind, so too had Poland, as it were, been blind before. But in time to come, they prophesied, Poland would be illuminated by Mieszko and exalted over all the neighbouring nations […] For Poland was indeed blind before, for she knew neither the worship of the true God nor the teachings of the Faith; but when Mieszko was enlightened Poland was enlightened too, because when he came to believe, the people of Poland were saved from the death of unbelief.15\n\nThe introduction of Christianity to Poland led to fundamental changes to the governance of the Slavic tribes ruled by Mieszko I and a cultural shift similar to that experienced by other converted territories across the European continent. Christendom provided previously disparate tribal groups with a common identity, and ultimately paved the way for Mieszko’s realm to be recognized as a state, with its internal structures comparable to the rest of Europe.16 References to Mieszko I and his realm begin to enter Christian written sources after his baptism. In 967, German annals mention the ruler of the Poles as amicus imperatoris, and ten years later, the land of the Slavs is depicted in a dedicatory miniature in a gospel book made for the Emperor Otto III.17 This late tenth-century miniature depicts Otto III enthroned and flanked by clergy and magnates. The Emperor receives homage from four female figures who are the crowned personifications of the four constituent parts of Christian Europe: Roma, Gallia, Germania, and Sclavinia — the land of the Slavs.18 This representation of a new, enlarged Europe, suggests that Poland played a significant part\n\n13\n\nCf.

In 991, Mieszko placed his realm, the civitas Schinesghe cum pertinentibus, under the protection of the Holy See, a fact which is known from an extract of a charter known as the Dagome Iudex.20 19\n\nKlaniczay, ‘The Birth of a New Europe’, p. 100.
