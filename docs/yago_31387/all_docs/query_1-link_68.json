Challenged by his cousin Sviatopolk I Grand Prince of Kiev, following the latter's accession in Kiev, he defeated Sviatopolk at Liubech [1016] and forced him to flee to Poland, succeeding as IAROSLAV I \"Mudriy/the Wise\" Grand Prince of Kiev.\n\nSviatopolk returned in Jul 1018 with an army led by his father-in-law, Boleslaw I King of Poland, and defeated Iaroslav at the Western Bug and forced him to retire to Novgorod. Sviatopolk entered Kiev again 14 Aug 1018 and resumed his rule. After King Boleslaw returned to Poland, Iaroslav advanced once more on Kiev. Sviatopolk fled south to raise another force with the Pechenegs but was finally defeated by the river Alta in 1019, when Iaroslav resumed power in Kiev[140].\n\nIn 1024, his half-brother Mstislav Prince of Tmutorokan moved his headquarters north to Chernigov to challenge Iaroslav, whom he defeated at Listven. The half-brothers agreed a division of territories, Iaroslav taking the land on the western bank of the Dnieper including Kiev and Novgorod. While Iaroslav was absent in Novgorod, the Pechenegs laid siege to Kiev, but were defeated after Iaroslav returned with a formidable army to relieve the siege[141]. He succeeded in the territories of his half-brother Mstislav on the latter's death in 1036, becoming sole ruler or \"Autocrat of the land of the Rus\"[142].\n\nHis greatest project was the conquest of Constantinople but his armies were defeated in decisive battles in 1043[143].\n\nHe supervised the rapid expansion of the city of Kiev, modelled on Constantinople. His law code Rus'ka Pravda also contributed to the development and consolidation of his administration especially in the area around Kiev, although it appears to have had little impact in the north[144].\n\nThe Primary Chronicle records the death of Iaroslav 19 Feb 1054 at Vyshgorod aged 76 and his burial place[145]. He left a testament dividing his territories between his sons, the substance of which is recorded in the Primary Chronicle[146] although no original text has survived.\n\n[m firstly ---. The fact of Iaroslav´s first marriage is indicated by the chronology of his oldest son, although as noted below no primary source has yet been identified which refers to this oldest son. Nevertheless, Iaroslav´s birth date, if accurate as shown above, does suggest that an earlier marriage is likely.]\n\nm [secondly] (1019) INGIGERD Olafsdottir of Sweden, daughter of OLOF \"Skotkonung\" King of Sweden & his wife Estrid of the Obotriten ([1000/03]-10 Feb 1050).\n\nAdam of Bremen names \"filius Iacobus et filia Ingrad\" as the children of \"Olaph rex Sueonum\" & his wife Estred, specifying that Ingrad married \"rex sanctus Gerzlef de Ruzzia\"[147]. Her birth date range is estimated based on the birth of her oldest child in 1020, and her youngest known child in [1036]. Morkinskinna names Queen Ingigerdr the daughter of King Óláfr the Swede as wife of King Yaroslav [of] Russia[148]. Snorre records the betrothal of \"Ingegerd the king's daughter\" and \"King Jarisleif from Russia\"[149].\n\nHer birth date range is estimated based on the birth of her oldest child in 1020, and her youngest known child in [1036]. The Historia Norwegie records the marriage of \"sororem Olaui Sueonensis Margaretam\" and \"rex Iarezlafus de Ruscia\" at her brother's instigation, after her betrothal to Olav of Norway was terminated[150]. It is more probable that she was the daughter rather than sister of King Olof if it is correct that she had ten children by her husband.\n\nShe is referred to as IRINA in Russian sources[151].\n\nThe Primary Chronicle records the death of \"the Princess wife of Yaroslav\" 10 Feb [1048/50][152].\n\nGrand Prince Iaroslav & his first wife had one child:\n\n1.

VLADIMIR Iaroslavich (1020-Novgorod 1052, bur Novgorod Church of St Sophia).\n\nThe Primary Chronicle records the birth of Vladimir son of Iaroslav in 1020[154]. Snorre names \"Valdemar, Vissivald and Holte the Bold\" as the children of \"King Jarisleif\" & his wife[155].\n\nHis father installed him in 1043 as Prince of Novgorod. He subjugated the Finnic tribe of Yam to secure Novgorod's control over the Gulf of Finland[156].\n\nPsellos records that Vladimir led an attack on Constantinople in [1045], apparently in revenge for the death of some Scythian noble in a brawl, but was defeated and forced to retreat[157].\n\nThe Primary Chronicle records the death of Vladimir \"Yaroslav's eldest son\" at Novgorod in 1052 and his place of burial[158]. As he predeceased his father, his descendants were ignored in the latter's testament and were subsequently considered ineligible to succeed as Grand Princes of Kiev.\n\nm --- ([1022]-1066). The name of Vladimir´s wife is not known. Baumgarten identifies the wife of Vladimir as Oda, daughter of Luitpold Graf von Stade & his wife Ida von Elstorf [Brunswick][159]. This is based partially on the Annales Stadenses which name \"Odam sanctimonialem de Rinthelen\" as daughter of \"Lippoldo filio domiine Glismodis\" and \"Ida [de Elsthorpe]\", specifying that she married \"regi Ruzie\" by whom she had a son \"Warteslaw\", returned to Saxony with her son after her husband died[160].\n\nVladimir & his wife had one child, Rostislav, Prince of Rostov, Novgorod, and Volynia (1056-1064), Prince of Tmutorokan (1064-1065).\n\n3. ANASTASIA Iaroslavna ([1023]-[1074/1096], bur Admont Abbey).\n\nBaumgarten names the second wife of King András and gives her origin but only cites one secondary source in support[163]. The primary source which confirms her parentage and marriage has not yet been identified.\n\nAfter her husband's death in 1060, she and her sons took refuge at the court of Heinrich IV King of Germany but, leaving her elder son there, she and her younger son went to Austria[164]. The Annals of Lambert record that \"regina Ungariorum, mater Salomonis regis\" presented the sword of \"rex Hunnorum Attila\" to \"duci Baioriorum Ottoni\" after her son was restored as king of Hungary[165].\n\nShe became a nun at Admont in 1074 as AGMUNDA.\n\nm ([1039]) as his second wife, ANDRÁS of Hungary, son of VÁSZOLY [Vazúl] Prince of Hungary Duke between March and Gran & --- of the Bulgarians ([1014]-Zirc autumn 1060, bur Tihany, Abbey of St Anian).

IZIASLAV Iaroslavich (1024-killed in battle Nezhatinaia Niva 3 Oct 1078 bur Kiev).\n\nThe Primary Chronicle records the birth of Izyaslav \"a second son\" to Vladimir in 1024[166].\n\nHe succeeded in 1054 as IZIASLAV I Grand Prince of Kiev.\n\n---\n\n5. IELIZAVETA Iaroslavna (-after 25 Sep 1066).\n\nSnorre records the marriage of King Harald and Elisabeth \"called by the Northmen Ellisif\" daughter of \"King Jarisleif\", specifying in a later passage that \"the Swedish king Olaf was brother of [her] mother\"[167]. Morkinskinna records the marriage of Haraldr Sigurdarson and King Yaroslav and Queen Ingigerdr daughter Elisabeth, the Norsemen call her Ellisif[168]. Snorre records that \"Queen Ellisif came from the West with her stepson Olaf and her daughter Ingegerd\" after her husband was killed[169].\n\nm (1044) HARALD Sigurdson, son of SIGURD Syr King of Ringeringe & his wife Asta Gudbrandsdatter (1015-killed in battle Stamfordbridge 25 Sep 1066). He succeeded in 1047 as HARALD III \"Hardråde\" King of Norway.\n\n6. SVIATOSLAV Iaroslavich (1027-27 Dec 1076, bur Chernigov, Church of the Saviour).\n\nThe Primary Chronicle records the birth of Svyatoslav \"a third son\" to Vladimir in 1027[170]. He succeeded in 1054 as Prince of Chernigov, and in 1073 as SVIATOSLAV II Grand Prince of Kiev.\n\n7. VSEVOLOD Iaroslavich (1030-13 Apr 1093, bur Kiev St Sofia).\n\nThe Primary Chronicle records the birth of Vsevolod \"a fourth son\" to Vladimir in 1030[171]. Snorre names \"Valdemar, Vissivald and Holte the Bold\" as the children of \"King Jarisleif\" & his wife[172].\n\nHe succeeded in 1054 as Prince of Pereyaslavl, and in 1076 as VSEVOLOD I Grand Prince of Kiev.\n\n8.

ANNA Iaroslavna (1036-5 Sep ([1075/78], bur Abbaye Villiers near La-Ferté-Alais).\n\nThe Liber Modernorum Regum Francorum records the marriage of \"filiam regis Russorum Annam\" with King Henri[176]. The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names \"Anna filia Georgii regis Sclavonum\" as wife of King Henri[177].\n\nShe was consecrated Queen Consort at Reims on her wedding day.\n\nQueen Anna caused a scandal in France by her second marriage and was forced to leave the court, although she returned after his death in 1074[178]. The Liber Modernorum Regum Francorum records the marriage of \"Anna, Henrici relicta\" and \"Rodulfo comitis\"[179]. \"Rodulphus Ambianensis comes\" donated property to Sainte-Marie d'Amiens, with the consent of \"Simon filius meus et Gualterus, Gualteri Tyrelli natus\", by charter dated 1069, subscribed by \"Anna uxor eius\"[180].\n\nm firstly (Reims 19 May 1051) as his second wife, HENRI I King of France, son of ROBERT II \"le Pieux\" King of France & his third wife Constance d'Arles [Provence] ([end 1009/May 1010]-Palais de Vitry-aux-Loges, forêt dOrléans, Loiret 4 Aug 1060, bur église de l'Abbaye royale de Saint-Denis).\n\nm secondly ([1061]) as his third wife, RAOUL III le Grand Comte de Valois, son of RAOUL II Comte de Valois & his wife Aliénor de Champagne (-Péronne 23 Feb or 8 Sep 1074, bur Montdidier, later transferred to Crépy-en-Valois, église collégiale Saint-Arnoul).\n\n10.

GRAND PRINCES of KIEV, descendants of IZIASLAV I Grand Prince of Kiev (third son of IAROSLAV I)\n\nAlthough Iziaslav was his father's oldest surviving son, and succeeded as Grand Prince of Kiev in 1054 in accordance with his father's testament, only one of his sons, Sviatopolk II, succeeding as Grand Prince and none of his grandsons. In accordance with the family tradition, all later descendants were thereby effectively excluded from the succession.\n\nIZIASLAV I 1054-1078\n\nIZIASLAV Iaroslavich, son of IAROSLAV I \"Mudriy/the Wise\" Grand Prince of Kiev & his [second] wife Ingigerd Olafsdottir of Sweden (1024-killed in battle Nezhatinaia Niva 3 Oct 1078, bur Kiev Church of the Holy Virgin).\n\nThe Primary Chronicle records the birth of Izyaslav \"a second son\" to Vladimir in 1024[192].\n\nPrince of Turov.\n\nHe succeeded on the death of his older brother in 1052 as Prince of Novgorod. In accordance with the terms of his father's testament, he succeeded in 1054 as IZIASLAV I Grand Prince of Kiev. It is also likely that his territories included Novgorod and Pskov[193].\n\nHe was deposed in Kiev by a mob which, dissatisfied with his refusal to attack the Kuman [Cumans], released Vseslav Prince of Polotsk from prison and proclaimed him Grand Prince of Kiev in Sep 1068, forcing Iziaslav to flee to Poland[194].\n\nIziaslav I was restored in 1069 with the help of Boleslaw II King of Poland[195].\n\nHe was deposed again in Kiev in 1073 by his younger brother Sviatoslav, restored again in 1077 after Sviatoslav died.\n\nHe answered the call from his brother Prince Vsevolod for military support against their nephew Oleg Sviatoslavich, whom they defeated 3 Oct 1078 at Nezhatin Meadow near Chernigov.

His body was brought to Kiev and laid to rest in the Tithe Church [35].\n\nIzyaslav was the first of Yaroslavs descendants to die in battle and whose body was brought from the field for burial in a church. In retrieving his brothers body Vsevolod adopted the practice initiated with the burials of SS. Boris and Gleb whose bodies had also been collected from the spots where they had been murdered.\n\nIzyaslav was not entombed in the Cathedral of St. Sophia that his father Yaroslav had built. As we shall see, Vsevolod, who succeeded Izyaslav to the throne of Kiev and was responsible for his burial, was probably reserving that honour for himself.\n\nEven more surprisingly, however, Vsevolod did not inter Izyaslav in the Church of St. Dmitry, in the monastery that he had founded in his district of Kiev [36]. It has been suggested that Izyaslavs Church of St. Dmitry was built of wood [37]. If this was the case it may explain why Vsevolod did not bury him there but in the Tithe Church which, being built of stone, was a more lasting structure. What is more, since it contained the remains of their grandfather Vladimir the Christianizer of Rus, it was also the more prestigious edifice.\n\nReferences:\n\n35 PSRL 1: 201202; PSRL 2: 193.\n\n36 See under the year 1051, PSRL 1: 159; PSRL 2: 147. Karger points out that the Monastery of St. Dmitry was built by 1062 when Izyaslav appointed Abbot Varlaam to the institution (Karger, Drevniy Kiev, 2, 262). Concerning the location of the monastery, see Tolochko, Kiev i Kievskaya zemlya, 5455, nr. 23.\n\n37 Aseev, Arkhitektura drevnego Kieva, 9394.\n\nFrom the Russian Wikipedia page (English below):\n\nhttp://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%98%D0%B7%D1%8F%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2_%D0%AF%D1%80%D0%BE% D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87\n\n---\n\nIn English:\n\nIziyaslav Yaroslavich (baptized as Dimitry, born in Novgorod in 1025, died October 3, 1078 in Nezhatina Niwa, near Chernihiv, Ukraine), was Grand Prince of Kiev 1054-1068, 1069-1073, and in 1077; and Prince of Novgorod in 1052-1054.\n\nSon of Yaroslav\n\nIziyaslav was born in 1025 in Novgorod, where at the time his father was Prince Yaroslav the Wise and his mother was Irinia (Swedish princess Ingegerd). He was their second son, after Vladimir.\n\nHe received from his father a lordship in Turov (southern Belarus). After the death of his brother, Prince Vladimir of Novgorod in 1052, he succeeded him, and by dynastic rules, became heir to the throne of Kiev (even though Vladimir left behind a son) on February 20, 1054. After the death of his father, he was Grand Prince of Kiev, and he left as Prince of Novgorod his son Mstislav.\n\nThe Yaroslavich Triumvirate\n\nMost of the reign of Iziyaslav was characterized by equal participation in the governance of the Grand Principality alongside his younger brothers - Prince of Chernigov Svyatoslav and Prince of Pereyaslav Vsevolod. The brothers together revised the legal code \"Russkaya Pravda\" (renaming it the \"Yaroslavichskaya Pravda\"), which required the brothers to jointly fill princely seats and set up separate Metropolitans in their principalities.\n\nHistorians call this the Yaroslavich Triumvirate. Together, they marched on the Torks after they raided Peryaslavl in 1055. The Torks were defeated, but the clash marked for the first time that the Rus confronted to Polovtsy Khan Bolusha - they forced him to sign a peace treaty to keep him outside of the borders, installing a 50 kilometer wide no-man's land between the neutral Rus and the Polovtsians.\n\nIn 1057, the Rus provided Byzantium with military assistance to protect Armenia from the Turkish Seljuks.\n\nIn 1058, Iziyaslav conquered the Baltic tribe of the Golyad on the Protva River.\n\nIn 1060, they marched against the Torks, and against the wizard Vseslav, Prince of Polotsk, in 1067.\n\nThe first overthrow\n\nIn 1068, Iziyaslav along with his brothers suffered a defeat in the Alta region, and were overthrown in a rebellion that probably started in a popular uprising in Kiev. Insurgent leaders were freed from dungeons (a cell built around the prisoner without a door), who were arrested earlier by Prince Iziyaslav. Vseslav of Polotsk was elevated to the throne of Kiev. Iziyaslav fled to Poland to the safety of his nephew Prince Boleslaw II. With the assistance of Polish troops, he returned in 1069. He sent ahead of him his son Mstislav, who brutally suppressed the instigators of the uprising, and had those who sent Iziyaslav into exile executed or blinded.\n\nThe Second Exile: Wandering through Europe\n\nBy 1073 (most likely somewhat earlier), the Yaroslavich Triumvirate disintegrated, as Iziyaslav's younger brothers Svyatoslav and Vsevelod conspired against him after reconciling with Vseslav of Polotsk.\n\nIn 1073, Svyatoslav of Chernigov captured Kiev, and Iziyaslav again fled to Poland where this time he was expelled by Polish authorities (who concluded an alliance with Svyatoslav and Vsevolod).\n\nIn exile, Iziyaslav went to Germany to the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and asked for help to fight against his brothers, along with a large amount of money. The Emperor, however, was facing internal struggles on his own, and could not help.\n\nIn 1075, Iziyaslav sent his son, Duke Yaropolk of Volhynia, to Rome where he visited Pope Gregory VII, an antagonist of Emperor Henry IV. The Pope limited himself to general exhortations addressed against the Russian princes.\n\nReturn and death\n\nIziyaslav's wanderings came to an end with the sudden death of Svyatoslav on December 27, 1076, leaving behind Vsevolod as sole successor. The new Grand Prince reconciled with his older brother and gave him back the Kiev principality, while he himself went to Chernigov.\n\nIn the next year, however, a civil war started. The son of Prince Svyatoslav, Oleg of Chernigov (claiming the Chernigov throne) and exiled Prince Borish Vyacheslavich, rose up against their uncles. In the battle of Nezhatina Niwa near Chernigov on October 3, 1078,, the Yaroslavich coalition won - Oleg was forced to flee and Boris was killed. However, before the end of the battle, Iziyaslavich also died when an enemy rider hit him with a spear on his shoulder.\n\nIziyaslav Yaroslavich was buried in the Sophia Cathedral in Kiev.\n\nMarriage and children\n\nIt is known that Iziyaslav was married to Gertrude, daughter of Polish King Mieszko II Lambert.\n\nChildren:\n\n1. Yaropolk, Prince of Volyn and Turovsky. It is known that Gertrude called Yaropolk in his prayer book (the so-called Code Gertrude) as his \"only son.\" Nazarenko assumes that from him came the Vsevolodkovich rulers of the Principality of Hrodno.\n\nPerhaps from another unknown mistress, perhaps wife, Iziyaslav had two more famous sons:\n\n1. Svyatopolk II Iziyaslavich (1050-1113), Prince of Polotsk (1069-1071), Prince of Novgorod (1078-1088), Prince of Turov (1088-1093), and Grand Prince of Kiev (1093-1113). His descendants in the 12th and 13th centuries continued to reign in Turov.\n\n2.

Grand Prince Izyaslav Yaroslavich died in that battle.\n\nIn 1078, the sons of Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince of Kiev Izyaslav and Prince of Chernigov Vsevolod, faced a rebellion by their nephews, Oleg Svyatoslavovich and Boris Vyacheslavich. The nephews first captured Chernigov from Vsevolod, who fled to Kiev.\n\nVsevolod turned to his brother for help. Four princes - Izyaslav, his son Yaropolk, Vsevolod, and his son Vladimir - collected an army and laid siege to Chernigov. Oleg and Boris were not in the city, but nonetheless, the city resisted capture. Vladimir invested the city.\n\nUpon learning that his nephew Oleg was marching upon Chernigov, Izyaslav set out to meet him. Oleg did not expect to win against the army of the four princes, and advised his brother to join in peace talks. Boris replied: \"Stay calm and watch me fight them.\" Boris was killed.\n\nIzyaslav stood amongst his infantry as it was attacked, and an enemy rider hit him with a spear in the shoulder, inflicting a mortal wound on the Grand Prince. Oleg fled with a small number of men to Tmutarakan.\n\nThe battle was described in \"Words about Igor's Campaign\" (\"????? ? ????? ???????\").\n\nExternal links:\n\nArticle in the encyclopedia \"Words about Igor's Campaign\" on the FEB (Fundamental Electronic Library) server:\n\nhttp://feb-web.ru/feb/slovenc/es/es3/es3-3091.htm\n\n\"Nezhatina Niva\" in the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Brockhaus and Efron:\n\nhttp://be.sci-lib.com/article071085.html\n\nFrom the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Brockhaus and Efron:\n\nhttp://be.sci-lib.com/article071085.html\n\nNizhatina Niva:\n\nKnown as the site of a battle between the Russian Princes and the Polovtsy in 1078, during which fell Grand Prince Izyaslav Yaroslavich. It was probably on the Left Bank of the Dnieper River near Gorodets, a port from which the dead Grand Prince was brought back to Kiev by boat.\n\nThe city of Nezhatina was supposed to have been standing in the 12th century. The assumption that Nezhatina Neva was on the site of the present city of Nezhyn is not probable.\n\n(No sources cited)\n\nFrom the entry on \"Words about Igor's Campaign\" on the FEB (Fundamental Electronic Library) server:\n\nhttp://feb-web.ru/feb/slovenc/es/es3/es3-3091.htm\n\nIn English:\n\nNezhatina Niva (Fields of Nezhatin) - located in the vicinity of Chernigov. In 1078, there was a battle there between an army under Oleg Svyatoslavich and Boris Vyacheslavich on one side, and a coalition of princes into which entered Izyaslav Yaroslavich Grand Prince of Kiev, his son Yaropolk, Vsevolod Yaroslavich, and lastly Vladimir Monomakh.\n\n\"And the opposing sides met on a field at a village near Nezhatin, and both sides inflicted great harm on the other\" - informs the PVL (Primary Chronicle, C. 133). In this fight was lost Izyaslav Yaroslavich and Borish Vyacheslavich: \"The first to die was Boris, son of Vyacheslav. Izyaslav stood his ground without waivering, and took a spear in his shoulder. Thus died Izyaslav, son of Yaroslavl\" (at the same location).\n\nContinuing to fight were significant forces, in the opinion of some researchers, basic participants of which included: Oleg Svyatoslavich, Boris Vyacheslavich, Vsevolod Yaroslavich, and Vladimir Monomakh, and the unnamed person who killed Izyaslav, whose body, according to texts that contradict the annals, was not carried to Kiev by Yaropolk and others, but rather by Svyatopolk Izyaslavich, his son. (Text in Slavonic or Old Russian follows.)\n\nResearchers have tried to define the location of the fight. There were attempts to correlate this with the modern location of Nezhin (Gerbel), but already Maximovich has refuted this assumption because of the distance from Chernigov and the reference to Nezhin by an earlier name of Unezh.\n\nIn order to define the location of N.N., it helps to understand the C. and the lavr. let. before 1152 river Kanin (see Kanin), which flows near Chernigov. Kudryashov places it between Svinya and Chernigov, 2 kilometers east of Chernigov where the small river Desna runs. He considers that this geographical position is closely related to the Kanin annals: \"By Nezhin, determined to be to the south of Chernigov over the Desna on a road to Nezhin, it is possible to imagine that the Nezhatin field was located between Nezhin and Kanin. (From Igor Seversky C. 55).\n\n(Ben M. Angel notes: A close inspection by Google Earth shows none of these locations as I've translated them. Nizhyn/Nezhin is located 65 kilometers southeast of Chernihiv/Chernigov. The Desna flows about 2-3 kilometers from Chernihiv town center - it acts as a city border for part of its stretch. The closest towns east of Chernihiv are Enkiv, Anysiv, and Pidhirne, all located about 5-8 kilometers away.)\n\n???./Sources:\n\nMaximovich M. A.

Grand prince of Kyiv intermittently from 1054 to 1078; the eldest son of Yaroslav the Wise.\n\nBefore inheriting the throne of Kyiv from his father, Iziaslav Yaroslavych ruled Turiv. In the 1060s he brought most of the Rus territories west of the Dnieper River under his control.\n\nFor refusing them arms to fight invading Cumans, the inhabitants of Kyiv revolted in 1068 (see Kyiv Uprising of 10689). He fled to Poland and with the aid of his brother-in-law and cousin, Boleslaw II the Bold, took Kyiv a year later from Vseslav Briachislavich of Polatsk.\n\nWhen his brothers Sviatoslav II Yaroslavych and Vsevolod Yaroslavych of Chernihiv marched on Kyiv in 1073, its inhabitants refused to support Iziaslav Yaroslavych and he was forced to flee abroad. He sought help in 1075 from Emperor Henry IV of Germany and Pope Gregory VII, but his efforts were in vain.\n\nIn 1077, after Sviatoslav II Yaroslavych, who ruled Kyiv, died and was succeeded by Vsevolod Yaroslavych, Iziaslav Yaroslavych marched on Kyiv with Polish troops. Vsevolod Yaroslavych renounced his throne and retired to Chernihiv. Iziaslav Yaroslavych died in battle helping Vsevolod Yaroslavych recapture Chernihiv from Sviatoslav II Yaroslavych's son Oleh (Mykhail) Sviatoslavych and his Cuman allies.\n\n(No sources cited.)\n\nFrom the Encyclopedia of Ukraine (by the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies):\n\nhttp://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\\K\\Y\\KyivUprisingof1068hD79.htm\n\nKyiv Uprising of 10689.

The incensed populace turned against Kyiv's patricians, freed the inmates of Kyiv's prisons, including Prince Vseslav Briacheslavych of Polatsk, whom Iziaslav Yaroslavych had imprisoned in 1067, and elected Vseslav as their ruler. Iziaslav Yaroslavych's palace was plundered and he was forced to flee to Poland.\n\nIn April 1069 he returned with the forces of his nephew Prince Boleslaw II the Bold of Cracow. Vseslav fled to Polatsk, and Iziaslav Yaroslavych and his son Mstyslav Iziaslavych brutally suppressed their opponents.\n\n(No sources cited.)\n\nFrom the Encyclopedia of Ukraine (by the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies), Volume 5 (1993) page on Vsevolod:\n\nhttp://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\\V\\S\\VsevolodYaroslavych.htm\n\nFighting between the princes started in 1073, when Vsevolod rose up against Iziaslav at Sviatoslavs bidding. Iziaslav then fled abroad, Sviatoslav emerged as the grand prince of Kyiv, and Vsevolod took the throne of Chernihiv.\n\nUpon Sviatoslav's death in 1077, Iziaslav returned to Kyiv, but he died the following year while helping Vsevolod to defend Chernihiv from their nephew, Oleh (Mykhail) Sviatoslavych. Vsevolod Yaroslavych then ascended the Kyivan throne (1078) and placed his own son, Volodymyr Monomakh, in Chernihiv.\n\n(No sources cited.)\n\nFrom the Encyclopedia of Ukraine (by the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies):\n\nhttp://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\\O\\L\\OlehMykhailSviatoslavych.htm\n\nOleh (Mykhail) Sviatoslavych [Svjatoslavyc], b ca 1050 [in Chernihiv?], d 6 or 24 August 1115 in Novhorod-Siverskyi.

Instead Oleh ruled Volodymyr-Volynskyi, but he was driven out in 1078 by Iziaslav and sought refuge with his brother, Roman (d 1079), in Tmutorokan.\n\nIn 1078 Oleh and his cousin Borys Viacheslavych tried, with Cuman help, to regain his patrimony in Chernihiv, but they were defeated by Iziaslav and Vsevolod's army at Nezhatyna Nyva. Oleh returned to Tmutorokan, where he was captured by the Khazars in 1079 and handed over to the Byzantines.

Iziaslav was one of the authors of \"Pravda Yaroslavichiv\" - a part of the first legal code of Rus, called Ruska Pravda.\n\nHe is also credited with the foundation of the Kiev Pechersk Monastery. Prince Iziaslav I of Kiev ceded the whole mountain to Antonite monks who founded a monastery built by architects from Constantinople.\n\nAccording to the Primary Chronicle, in the early 11th century, Antony, a Greek Orthodox monk from Esphigmenon monastery on Mount Athos, originally from Liubech of the Principality of Chernigov, returned to Rus' and settled in Kiev as a missionary of the monastic tradition to Kievan Rus'. He chose a cave at the Berestov Mount that overlooked the Dnieper River and a community of disciples soon grew.\n\nIn 1043 his father Veliki Kniaz (Grand Prince) Yaroslav made an agreement with King Casimir I of Poland that recognized Cherven as part of Kiev. The agreement was sealed with a double marriageCasimir to Dobronega, Yaroslav's sister; and Iziaslav to Gertrude, Casimir's sister. From this marriage were born three children: Iziaslav's son Yaropolk, Mstislav and Sviatopolk.\n\nAs a result of the popular uprising in 1068, Iziaslav was deposed and fled to Poland. In 1069 he retook Kiev with the help of the Polish army; however, he was ousted again by his brothers in 1073. Iziaslav turned to the German emperor, the Polish king and the Pope for help on several occasions.\n\nIn 1076 he succeeded in retaking Kiev once again, but soon died in an internecine war against Princes Oleg Sviatoslavich and Boris Vyacheslavich.\n\nSources\n\nMartin, Janet.

Also called Anthony of the Caves (Russian: ??????? ?????????, Ukrainian: ??????? ??????????) he, together with Theodosius of Kiev, co-founded Kiev Pechersk Lavra (Kiev Monastery of the Caves).\n\nSt. Anthony is venerated as a saint and the founder of monasticism in Rus. His feast day falls on July 10. Since the Russian Orthodox Church follows the Julian Calendar, the day on which his feast is celebrated is currently July 23 on the modern Gregorian Calendar. His relics have never been found.\n\nEarly life\n\nHe was born in Lyubech in Chernigov Principality and was baptized with the name \"Antipas\". He was drawn to the spiritual life from an early age and, when he was of age, left for the Greek Orthodox Esphigmenou Monastery on Mount Athos to live as a hermit. He lived in a secluded cave there overlooking the sea, which is still shown to visitors. In circa 1011, the abbot gave Anthony the job of expanding monasticism in his native Kiev, which had only recently begun its conversion to Christianity.\n\nReturn to Kiev\n\nAnthony returned to Kiev, and founded several monasteries on the Greek model on the order of local princes. These monasteries were not as austere as Anthony was used to from his time on Mount Athos. He instead chose to live in a small four-yard cave which had been dug by the presbyter Hilarion.\n\nIn 1015, his peaceful austerity was interrupted by the death of Vladimir I of Kiev, and the subsequent fratricidal war for the throne between Vladimir's sons Yaroslav and Sviatopolk, and Anthony returned to Mount Athos. When the conflict ended, the abbot sent Anthony back to Kiev, prophesying that many monks would join him on his return.\n\nEstablishment of Kiev Pechersk Lavra\n\nOn his return, Anthony found a small 4-yard cave which Hilarion had dug before his elevation as the first native Metropolitan of Kiev. Anthony became well known in the area for his strict asceticism. He ate rye bread every other day and drank only a little water. His fame soon spread beyond Kiev, and several people began to ask for his spiritual guidance or blessing. Soon, some people even offered to join him. Eventually, Anthony accepted the company of a few of them. The first was a priest named Nikon. The second was Theodosius of Kiev.\n\nThe new monastery enjoyed royal favor almost from the beginning, although there were occasional problems. When Iziaslav I of Kiev demanded that the son of a wealthy boyar and one of his own retainers be told to leave the monastery, Nikon said he could not take soldiers away from the King of Heaven. This did nothing to placate Iziaslav's anger, and Anthony decided that it might be expedient for him to leave. Anthony returned after Iziaslav's wife requested his return.\n\nShortly thereafter Anthony had gained twelve disciples. Anthony, devoted to the model of the solitary hermit set by his namesake Anthony the Great, left his cave for a nearby mountain so he could continue to live the solitary life. There he dug another cave for himself and lived in seclusion there. This cave became the first of what would later be known as the Far Caves.\n\nIn time, the first official abbot of the monastery, Barlaam of Kiev, was called by Iziaslav to head a new monastery, St. Demetrios, which had been built at the gates of the city. The monks requested Anthony to name the replacement, and he named Theodosius.\n\nAs the number of monks grew and crowding became a problem, Anthony requested that Iziaslav give them the hill in which the caves were located. He did so, and the monks built a wooden church and some cells there, encircling the area with a wooden fence. Theodosius continued to consult Anthony in the guidance of the community and, as the monastery grew, so did Anthony's reputation.\n\n[edit]Exile and return\n\nWhen Iziaslav and his brothers were facing a popular uprising involving the Cumans, they came to Anthony for his blessing. They did not get it. Anthony foretold that because of their sins they would be defeated, and that the brothers would be buried in a church they would build. Shortly thereafter Iziaslav left because of the rebellion. He suspected Anthony of sympathizing with the opposition and arranged to banish Anthony upon his return. Before he could do so, Iziaslav's brother, Sviatoslav, arranged for Anthony to be secretly taken to Chernigov. Anthony dug himself a cave there. The Eletsky Monastery there is said by some to be built on the site of Anthony's cave. Eventually Iziaslav was again reconciled to Anthony and asked that he return to Kiev.\n\nOn his return, Anthony and Theodosius decided to build a larger stone church to accommodate the ever increasing number of monks. Anthony himself did not live to see the church completed. He died in 1073, shortly after blessing the foundation of the new church, at 90 years old. Shortly before his death he called the monks together and consoled them about his coming death. He also asked them that his remains be hidden away forever. The monks carried out his request. He was reportedly buried in his cave, but no relics have ever been found. Many however have subsequently come to the cave to pray and many of them have reported being healed there.\n\nReferences\n\nAttwater, Donald and Catherine Rachel John.

He was taken away by Sviatoslav Yaroslavich.\n\nFeodosij likewise did not remain passive, although his attitude towards Izyaslav Yaroslavich was different. He recognized Izyaslav, but he was uneasy about Izyaslav's attraction to Catholicism and Poland.\n\nFeodosij was a very staunch defender of Izyaslav's rights to the Kiev throne when it was occupied by his brother Sviatoslav. Relations between Feodosij and the court were almost severed.\n\nSviatoslav was on the point of imprisoning Feodosij. Feodosij was saved by the intervention of the notables and the brethren. Feodosij made his peace with Sviatoslav and allowed him to be mentioned in the church services, but only after Izyaslav.\n\n12th Century: The death of Gleb Vseslavich's widow was marked, the chronicle reveals, by an enormous contribution of land and money to Pechera Monastery. Her father, Yaropolk Izyaslavich, who died in 1087, gave the monastery the volosts of Nebl, Derevskaya and Lutsk, and those \"near Kiev.\"\n\n--------------------------\n\nUnsure why this is included, but in case it is the result of a mistaken merge, the material is saved (Izyaslav is not Vladislav i Herman):\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wladyslaw_I_Herman\n\nFödd omkring 1043.

However, because of the flight from Poland of his older brother Boleslaw II the Bold in 1079, he was elevated to the rank of Duke of Poland.\n\nOpinions vary on whether Wladyslaw played an active role in the plot to depose his brother or whether he was handed the authority simply because he was the most proper person, being the next in line in the absence of the king and his son Mieszko Boleslawowic.\n\n...\n\nMarriages and Issue\n\nBefore Wladyslaw took the title of Duke of Poland, probably during the 1070s, he had a relationship with certain Przeclawa, whose exact origins are unknown, although some sources stated that she belonged to the Prawdzic clan.[6] Her status is also a matter of dispute among the historians: some believed that she only was Wladyslaw's mistress and others asserted that she was his wife, but this union was performed under pagan rituals and in consequence not recognized by the Church as a valid marriage.\n\nBy 1080, one year after Wladyslaw ascended to the Polish throne, Przeclawa either died or was sent away; it's believed by some sources that after she was dismissed by the Duke, Przeclawa took the veil under the name of Christina (Polish: Krystyna) and died around 1092.[7] This union produced a son, Zbigniew (b. ca. 1070/73 - d. ca. 1112/14), who was considered illegitimate.\n\nIn 1080 Wladyslaw married firstly with Judith (b. ca. 1056 - d. 25 December 1086), daughter of Duke (and since 1085 King) Vratislaus II of Bohemia. They had one son:\n\n-1. Boleslaw III Wrymouth (b. 20 August 1086  d. 28 October 1138).\n\nIn 1089 Wladyslaw married secondly with Judith (b. ca. 1054 - d. 14 March ca. 1105), daughter of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor and widow of King Solomon of Hungary. They had four daughters:\n\n-1. Sophia (b. ca. 1089 - d. bef. 12 May 1112), married bef. 1108 to Yaroslav I, Prince of Vladimir-Volynia.\n\n-2. Agnes (b. ca. 1090 - d. 29 December 1127), Abbess of Quedlinburg (1110) and Gandersheim (1111).\n\n-3.
