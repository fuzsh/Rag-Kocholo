        "text": "Distant Populations, the fourth studio album from New York City post-hardcore band Quicksand is out digitally now via Epitaph Records. Vinyl offerings will be out September 24. For vinyl pre-order information, visit https://quicksand.ffm.to/distantpopulations.\n\nRecorded at Studio 4 Recording in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, Distant Populations was produced and engineered by Will Yip (The Menzingers, Code Orange, Defeater), and mixed by Josh Wilbur (Lamb of God, Megadeth, Avenged Sevenfold). The album is the follow-up to the critically lauded 2017 release Interiors. Sonically it has a punchier, more up-tempo sound than its predecessor, with its 11 songs being concise, carved sonic jewels boasting not a single wasted note. Its gripping lyricism and raw power leap out from the very first listening.\n\nThroughout the album’s 11 tracks, Quicksand explores the duality of our simultaneous existence in individual relationships and as part of a mass society, while also examining the alienation and loneliness of it all. “Everyone is on the one hand so connected with each other, and on the other hand, is so far apart.” says frontman Walter Schreifels.“We’re checking out each other’s social media and we know what everybody’s doing. But when we’re sitting in the same room together, we’re looking at our phones,” he adds point out the sad irony of it all.\n\nToday, the band share a live performance video of their new track \"Colossus,” directed by A.F. Cortes (Metz, Daughters, Uniform).\n\nIn support of Distant Populations, Quicksand will be hitting the road this fall. The headlining run will begin September 28 in Boston and wrap on October 31 in Philly. Tickets are on sale now.
