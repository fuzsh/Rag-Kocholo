        "text": "SYNOPSIS\n\nCecilia and Albert are going to start living differently. With Albert's young-onset dementia becoming more complicated to manage, Cecilia is forced to make the difficult decision of seeking professional help. As Albert's mind locks him into a childhood memory, Cecilia strains to ground him in the present. Quicksand explores the unique complexity of rebuilding a relationship daily at the hands of dementia.\n\nImage\n\nImage\n\nImage\n\nWHAT MAKES THIS A DIFFERENT DEMENTIA FILM?\n\nThere are a plethora of dementia and Alzheimer’s-related films but Quicksand specifically sheds light on the act of seeking and introducing professional help.\n\nOne of the most significant aims of the film is to recognise the role of carers. Cecilia’s response to Albert’s condition occupies considerable space in the film to highlight the impact of caring for someone you love.\n\nWe want to reduce stigma by showing a reality that is about finding a new way of life together. Quicksand is realistic about the hardships of being a carer but most importantly it is a story of hope.\n\nImage\n\nImage\n\nFILM REFERENCES\n\nAbout Time (Richard Curtis, 2013).\n\nOne Fine Morning (Mia Hansen-Løve, 2022).\n\nThe Eternal Memory (Maite Alberdi, 2023).\n\nLittle Fish (Chad Hartigan, 2020).\n\nThe Father (Florian Zeller, 2020).\n\nStill Alice (Richard Glatzer, Wash Westmoreland, 2014).\n\nSupernova (Harry Macqueen, 2020).\n\nLe Week-End (Roger Mitchell, 2013).\n\nPoetry (Lee Chang-dong, 2010).\n\nImage\n\nImage\n\nMOODBOARDS\n\nImage\n\nImage\n\nWHAT WILL YOUR MONEY GO TOWARDS?\n\nBy donating even £1 you will become part of the Quicksand team and for that we want to say the biggest thank you.
