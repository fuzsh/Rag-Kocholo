        "text": "FX/SFX: Same as its film counterpart.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Same as its film counterpart. On the VHS releases of Stickin' Around: Volumes 2 and 3.as well as possibly other Canadian releases from that time period, it uses the music from the Avalanche Home Entertainment logo.\n\nAvailability: Uncommon. Appears on mainly Canadian DVD releases (and later US releases) of Lionsgate material (This does appear on VHS releases too) such as Strictly Ballroom and Breakin' the Law. Makes a strange appearance on the 2001 Platinum Disc DVDs of American Eagle and Merchants of War. All DIC Entertainment DVD releases distributed by the company use this logo, with the VHS versions using the 3rd logo.\n\n2nd Logo\n\n(2001-2004?)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"186\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/71d567b23f01d40f14c2c7bf98af3355a2e44d56\" width=\"329\"></iframe>\n\nNickname: \"The Constellation II\"\n\nLogo: Same as the 1997 movie logo, except \"FILMS\" is replaced by \"HOME ENTERTAINMENT\" and \"PRESENTS\" is replaced by \"A LIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY\". Another difference is that all the text fades in at the same time.\n\nFX/SFX: Same as the 1997 movie logo.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Same as the first logo.\n\nAvailability: Extremely rare. Only known to appear on the 2 Sabrina: The Animated Series VHS's - Sabrina in Love and Salem's World (the Sabrina's World DVD uses the previous logo) as well as Mummies Alive! (The DVD version also uses the previous logo) which both came out on the same day. It also appeared on the 2004 DVD releases of the horror movie Cement and Quicksand (even though the packaging for that release has Artisan Entertainment logos). It also appears after the DVD menu on the 2001 DVD of Bruiser (the previous logo appears before the menu).\n\n3rd Logo\n\n(2001-2006)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"195\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/3dd499aad6c8d0c4d798bb0a7abfcc7d9b29d850\" width=\"250\"></iframe>\n\nNickname: \"The Constellation III\"\n\nLogo: On a black background, the words \"LIONS GATE HOME ENTERTAINMENT\" fly in one by one away from the viewer, with stars moving into place while a lion fades in. After that the byline \"A LIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY\" fades in below and the logo shines.\n\nFX/SFX: Words and stars moving into place, fading, and shining.\n\nVariants:\n\nA widescreen version exists. This can be seen on the DVD releases of Godsend and the Uncut Edition of Saw.\n\nAn in-credit still version was seen on Care Bears: Big Wish Movie."
