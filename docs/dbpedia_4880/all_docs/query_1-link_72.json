        "text": "Some things bond you for life, and apparently, saving someone who is drowning in quicksand is one of them. While appearing on The Jennifer Hudson Show, Emilio Estevez recalled the time when Laurence Fishburne saved him from drowning in quicksand in the Philippines.\n\nEmilio Estevez and Laurence Fishburne were both 14 when they met for the first time in the Philippines. Emilio’s father, Martin Sheen, was filming Apocalypse Now at the time, which also featured Fishburne in a supporting role. The pair had only known each other for a few days when they came across a small boat. “[Fishburne] says, ‘Hey there’s this little boat, let’s go out on it.’ I said, ‘Sure.’ We were both 14 at the time,” Estevez said. “So we were out on this boat together, and we started getting too close to the shore and I said, ‘Well, let me jump out, I’ll push us offshore. I jumped out, and it was like quicksand mud.” Estevez continued, “I was sinking, and I just saw Fishburne just looking at me going, ‘Grab my hand!’ and he pulled me back onto the boat. We were bonded ever since.“\n\nRelated\n\nMaximum Overdrive: Giancarlo Esposito thought Stephen King did a brilliant job directing\n\nEmilio Estevez and Laurence Fishburne naturally didn’t tell Martin Sheen about their close call in the quicksand (they were 14, after all). Sheen didn’t learn about the incident until decades later when he read about it in the father-son memoir they wrote together, Along the Way: The Journey of a Father and Son. Sheen said that he then “called Mr. Fishburne to thank him for saving my son’s life.“"
