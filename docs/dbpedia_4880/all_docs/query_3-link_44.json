        "text": "Alright, 24 hours remain until voting starts. Until then, time for a little sub review! I may jsut ask questions to get your thoughts rolling and clarify on some things the voters would be able to use in favor of or against this mod. Not going to be reviewing my own subs but if anyone has anything to add, wants to review mine, or has any repsonses to any questions, feel free to post. I won't be giving any ideas for replacement names for types I don't think fit because of how much I have to cover but someone else is more than welcome to do that as well, or ask me afterwards in the Roulettemons Discord.\n\nFirst off, I want to say that I think it's best if a type chart makes full sense, or at least makes as much sense as possible. This mod is already going to be by far the most difficult to get into; in order to even look at the spreadsheet to see what a Pokemon can do, you'll need to know what at least 17 moves do or may end up absolutely screwing yourself in a given match. Every time you calc something, there might be some huge boosting item or ability, and you'll want to know of both of those as well. The type chart is probably going to be the most complex part of this mod to learn, and making things as easy as possible for the players would be fantastic. I could see someone disagreeing and saying that a fully random or out-of-wack type chart would fit the nature of this mod, and that by joining people should understand that this mod will not be very easy to learn, but I just disagree.\n\nalso side note but i forgot you can rename sleep and i also forgot that trapping immunity was a thing so will probably just leave it with no immunities although would be open to randomly giving it to one of the ten types\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Types\n\nRed -> Mario\n\nOrange -> Metroid\n\nYellow -> Pokemon\n\nGreen -> Yoshi\n\nBlue -> StarFox\n\nPurple -> DK\n\nPink -> Kirby\n\nBlack -> Mother\n\nWhite -> Zelda\n\nGray -> F-Zero\n\nTotally non-sensical, but I feel like it's kind of the point with a 'roulette' meta (fun fact: I actually RNGed the order of these to get with the roulette idea).\n\nThis isn't a cohesive type chart as opposed to just being a random one, so I won't say anything about the matchups themselves. I'm allowing you to make more type charts so if you want to keep this one, I'd like you to consider making a cohesive one as well, since it seems just about universally agreed upon that having cohesion is the way to go and it may not do well in voting by default. As for questions if you want to stick with this idea, how would you think Pokemon would look with this? Would they be based on the enemies or characters of their respective games, or do you have something different in mind? How would you determine the names of moves in a way that would be related to the series, if they were to have any correlation at all?\n\nTypes:\n\nRed = Arid\n\nOrange = Acid\n\nYellow = Liquid\n\nGreen = Cold\n\nBlue = Heat\n\nPurple = Moist\n\nPink = Treatment\n\nBlack = Wind\n\nWhite = Natural\n\nGray = Solid\n\nStatuses:\n\nThey all just fit themselves already.\n\nI feel as though Solid, Acid, and Heat could be replaced with better things. Wind beating Solid doesn't make sense for me no matter which meaning you use. Solids are the densest state and would be the furthest to blow away with wind because of that, and tougher objects like what Scoop did for his type chart would probably make less sense for those. I personally would think Liquid would lose to Acid, but could see someone explaining why I'm wrong here. When I think of those two things, I think of the ocean being acidified by human activity, although that clearly has shown the ocean's resilience to it. I also don't really see how it interacts with Moist. Heat losing to Cold doesn't make sense to me, since the cold is just an absence of heat. I also have no idea how it beats Treatment, and I don't really see how it's immune to Wind since the wind has a pretty clear effect on the heat.\n\nEverything else makes sense but some pretty substantial changes may be needed here.\n\nView attachment 329463\n\n[/hide]\n\nRed -> Envy\n\nOrange -> Pride\n\nYellow -> Wrath\n\nGreen -> Greed\n\nBlue -> Gluttony\n\nPurple -> Lust\n\nPink -> Purity\n\nWhite -> Sloth\n\nBlack -> Might\n\nGray -> Divine\n\nPoison -> Anger (Wrath, Purity)\n\nToxic -> Rage (Wrath, Purity)\n\nBurn -> Hunger (Gluttony)\n\nParalysis -> Attraction (Lust)\n\nFreeze -> Debt (Greed)\n\nDivine: Pokemon that are seen as mythical (not necessarily legendary) and have special qualities that put them above other pokemon.

Wrath is already angry, and Pure pokemon cannot be moved by anger.\n\nHunger: The pokemon becomes hungry, causing them to starve and become weak over time. Gluttonous pokemon are already hungry.\n\nAttraction: Big boba causes pokemon to become frozen in awe.\n\nDebt: The pokemon is stuck in debt, and wants to get free.\n\nThe only explanations I am missing are\n\nWrath SE on Pride\n\nGluttony SE on Purity\n\nPretty good, well thought out type chart here, so I'm going to nitpick some. Might being weak to Envy feels like it should be the other way around given your explanation, since in those supervillain plotlines, the hero almost always ends up winning. I also don't really understand Gluttony vs Lust. Some of these may be difficult to come up for move names for, although I'm sure you'd be able to explain some possible ideas. As for your two missing explanations, maybe the idea of Gluttony could tarnish one's Purity, and maybe someone being overly Prideful could piss someone off for Wrath? I dunno, just throwing out ideas.\n\nRed = Heat\n\nOrange = Abyss\n\nYellow = Nature\n\nGreen = Shine\n\nBlue = Magic\n\nPurple = Gloom\n\nPink = Wind\n\nBlack = Artificial\n\nWhite = Mineral\n\nGray = Beast\n\nPoison, Toxic Poison, and Sleep stay the same\n\nBurn = Hex\n\nParalysis = Exhaust\n\nFreeze = Blind\n\nGloom is like if you combined the vibes of ghost and bug, sort of a \"subterranean creatures\" type.\n\nThere's no explanations here although we might have talked about this on Discord, so I may have just forgotten a lot of them. As it stands though, I don't really understand what an Abyss type means, so I can't touch on how it would interact with the other types. What kind of Pokemon would make it up? Are there any examples you have of existing ones, and if not, could you explain some designs as examples? This might also be a point against the type's name and might imply that it could be better changed. Also, is there an explanation yet for Shine being strong against Magic? I don't really have much else to say otherwise though, not bad.\n\nRed -> Citizens\n\nOrange -> Clergy\n\nYellow -> Occult\n\nGreen -> Merchants\n\nBlue -> Royals\n\nPurple -> Peasants\n\nPink -> Knights\n\nBlack -> Criminals\n\nWhite -> Artists\n\nGray -> Travellers\n\nPoison -> Curse (Occult & Knights are immune)\n\nToxic -> Hex (Occult & Knights are immune)\n\nBurn -> Hunger (Royals are immune)\n\nParalysis -> Wound (Knights are immune)\n\nFreeze -> Debt (Merchants are immune)\n\nSleep -> Illness\n\nPowder moves are now \"miracles\" I guess\n\nMy types are based of hierarchic roles during the late middle-ages/early renaissance. I started by putting \"Royal\" on blue and everything just kinda happened to fit from there. If think most of the weaknesses make sense, the only logical problems i see are typings that should interact but don't really, but tbh I think its fine as is rn.\n\nI like the idea for this a lot even beyond the concept, all of these mesh really well together while also being distinct from one another from a unique place. A few matchups I don't understand are Peasants beating Clergy, Merchants beating Royal, and Artists against either of their matchups honestly.\n\nMy biggest question, though - how do we design Pokemon for this? Like, what would define a Pokemon as a certain type? Things like Royal, Knight, and Clergy are somewhat obvious, but a lot of these aren't really for me. This isn't an issue so much as something that just needs answered since we would likely have the \"display types on switchin\" code. Also, to be certain, I don't think these would be humans as opposed to Pokemon with these properties, right? Because if they'd be human then that'd honestly kill the idea for me; I really want to explore what a meta of Pokemon of different types would look like visually.\n\nOtherwise, though, a really cool and unique idea for a type chart. I dig this.\n\nRed -> Vampire\n\nOrange -> Solar\n\nYellow -> Shade\n\nGreen ->Fungi\n\nBlue -> Mineral\n\nPurple -> Cave\n\nPink -> Arid\n\nBlack -> Mirror\n\nWhite -> Wood\n\nGray -> Magic\n\nPoison -> Wither (new name, should be related to Shade and Arid)\n\nToxic -> Decay (new name, should be related to Shade and Arid)\n\nBurn -> Crystalize (new name, should be related to Mineral)\n\nParalysis -> Fatigue (new name, should be related to Cave and Arid)\n\nFreeze -> Infected (new name, should be related to Fungi)\n\nSleep -> Sleep (old name)\n\nPowder -> Thermal (new name, should be related to Solar)\n\nVampire\n\nVampire is weak to Solar for Vampires burning in the sun, and weak to Wood for Vampires being defeated by wooden stakes. It is strong against Mirror because they don't have reflections and strong against Cave because they can turn into bats. Vampire Types could be designed afetr blood-sucking animals and actual vampires\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nSolar\n\nSolar is weak to Shade because the sun cannot touch shadows, and weak to Cave because the sun does not reach caves. It is strong against Vampire for burning them, Wood for burning them and Arid for deteriorating the soil. Solar Types could be designed after incarnations of the Sun, heat and creatures who otherwise are sun-related, such as basking lizards and some plants.\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nView attachment 329551View attachment 329550\n\nShade\n\nShade is weak to Mirror because shadows can be reflected, and weak to itself because combining two shadows will only make it stronger. It is strong against Solar because the Sun cannot touch shadows. Shade Types could be designed after cursed shadows.\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nView attachment 329555View attachment 329554\n\nFungi\n\nFungi is weak to Arid because they need humid environments to thrive. It is strong against Caves because caves are usually humid and dark, giving the perfect conditions for them to live in, and strong against Mineral because they can deteriorate the minerals. Fungi Types could be mostly based on Mushrooms and Moss.\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nView attachment 329556\n\nMineral\n\nMineral is weak to Fungi because fungus can deteriorate minerals. They are strong against Cave because they are usually located inside caves, and against Arid because mineral salt can be used to help treat the soil. They are immune to Mirror because Minerals are typically already reflective. Mineral Types could vary from non-mechanic metallic beings to crystal creatures.\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nView attachment 329564View attachment 329565View attachment 329566\n\nCave\n\nCave is weak to Fungi because caves give them perfect conditions to spread, to Vampire because they can turn into Bats, and to Mineral because they're where minerals are most usually formed. It is strong against Solar because the sun cannot reach caves. Cave Types could be designed after cave dwellers, both real and mythological\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nView attachment 329568\n\nArid\n\nArid is weak to Solar because the scorching sun deteriorates the soil futher, and to Mineral because Saltes can help to get rid of arid soil. It is strong against Fungi because Fungi cannot grow in places with low humidity. Arid Types could be based on the cracked soil and on desert creatures.\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nView attachment 329551\n\nMirror\n\nMirror is weak to Vampires because they don't have reflections, and has no effect on Mineral because they're often already reflective. Mirror is super-effective against Shade because shadows can be reflected, and to Magic becauseof the popular trope of magic being reflected back at the user. Mirror Types would be pokémon who represent the concept of Reflection or Imitation in some way.\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nView attachment 329555\n\nWood\n\nWood is weak to Solar because wood burns with too much heat, and strong against Vampire because of wooden stakes. Wood Types would be mostly made of trees, as well as beings who are either made of wood or use wooden tools.\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nMagic\n\nMagic is weak against Mirror because of the trope ofmagic being reflected back at the attacker, and neutral against everything else because of Magic being very versatile on its spells. Magic Types would either be creatures who do magic or who are in some way related to magic.\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nView attachment 329574View attachment 329575View attachment 329576\n\nWither and Decay end this destiny\n\nSimillar to poison, only with the idea that Arid mons would be more resilient due to their harsher living conditions and Shade because you can't decay a shade.\n\nCrystalize\n\nThe idea is that the Pokémon's body would be either start being covered in crystals or being turned into crystals itself. It halves Attack for the lack of control over a sudden unusual body change, and Mineral is immune to it because they are already Crystals.\n\nFatigue\n\nRelated to the idea that Cavernous places and Deserts are harder to live on and tire you out faster if you are not prepared, leading to lower negery (Speed) and exaustion (Skips a turn).\n\nInfected\n\nRelated to the idea of a fungus infecting a body and rendering it unable to fight.\n\nThermal\n\nThe Sun would overpower whatever is trying to change the temperature.\n\nLike I said to you before, this is a very easy to understand and well-explained type chart. The one thing that may not be the most obvious to a newcomer is the distinction between Cave and Mineral, but I think Cave being based around cave dwellers makes enough sense. My one question is this - how do we plan on making Mirror-type moves? I have no other questions or complaints otherwise; this would likely be my personal #1 vote as it currently stands, although that might change as things get explained further.\n\nRed -> Flow\n\nOrange ->Patch\n\nYellow ->Break\n\nGreen -> Shock\n\nBlue -> Relief\n\nPurple -> Pressure\n\nPink -> Stress\n\nBlack -> Improvement\n\nWhite -> Drain\n\nGray -> Sameness\n\nPoison -> Stress (Break and Stress are immune)\n\nToxic -> Dire Stress (Break and Stress are immune)\n\nBurn -> Pacify (Relief is immune)\n\nParalysis -> trapped (Pressure is immune)\n\nFreeze -> Shocked (Shock is immune)\n\nSleep -> Dozing\n\nOkay so this is all very weird and abstract. I feel as though there needs to be a better explanation to all of this so uhh I can try.\n\nFlow in this case refers to more of a steady flow, that can't really be changed. On top of that going with the flow can alleviate pressure from someone. However you patch the flow in, it can't really go anywhere. You drain a flow and well it gets drained.\n\nAs stated before if you patch a flow it can't really go anywhere. However if you break off the patch then it becomes useless. Put to much pressure on a patch and it'll become useless.\n\nBreak in this case refers to breaking something. If you break is strong against itself because if you keep breaking something that is broken you just break it even more and leave it in a worse state. Improvement is strong against break because if you improve something to be better prepared against a break, then the break will do less damage. An improvement can stop breaks. Anyway why is Break immune to the Stress status conditions? The answer is that breaking things can help people relieve stress by allowing them to express that stress in a violent manner.\n\nShock is not referring to electricity in this case but more of the emotion of being shocked. Shock can cause pressure or break someone out of it, and likewise a great enough shock can disturb the relief of anyone.\n\nRelief is strong against pressure and stress for the same reason really. With enough relief you stop being stressed and the pressure upon you is reduced. Likewise relief is strong against itself because if you become more relieved you're still relieved. Nothing really changes that much.\n\nPressure is a fun one because it can refer to the pressure placed upon a person or the physical pressure gravity brings. Also I've already explained it through the other types.\n\nStress is very similar to pressure in concept, however you might wonder why it resists itself. It's like this, if one thing is making you stressed and other thing is making you stressed the two things aren't in competition. It's not a matter of, \"This is stressing me out more than the other thing\" and more of a matter of \"Holy shit both of these things are stressing me the fuck out! Christ on a bike this is awful!\". Thus in my mind I view stress being resistant against itself rather than strong against itself. As for why it's strong against shock, stress can often be the source of shock. If someone who's stressed takes expresses their emotions in a nontraditional manner it will often illicit shock. If someone dies from stress the news of the death can cause shock to various people.\n\nImprovement is one of the weirdest typings. Already explained the relationship it has with break, and improvement vs sameness is pretty obvious, but what about Improvement Vs Relief. Well my justification is that as life improves, as we improve, in theory relief would become something that is more attainable and when you're relieved you don't feel the need to improve. That's my idea behind it anyway.\n\nDrain's main match ups are against patch and flow. Drain a flow and it gets redirected, put a patch over a drain and it becomes useless. Pretty simple.\n\nSameness: Improvement beats it for obvious reasons and it's neutral against everything else because it really isn't effecting anything. It's leaving things as they are.\n\nThis one stands out a lot to me for its concept, and I can definitely see abstract concepts working. The entire type chart made a lot of sense to me even at a glance. My big issue arises with how difficult it may be to make these into Pokemon. I can see how you can do double meanings like using water for Flow for example, but I don't understand how you'd make Pokemon for Improvement, Drain, Stress, or Patch. This is a pretty cool one though, I'd like this one a lot if not for that issue.\n\nRed -> Priest\n\nOrange -> Noble\n\nYellow -> Mage\n\nGreen -> Entertainer\n\nBlue -> Soldier\n\nPurple -> Artisen\n\nPink -> Diplomat\n\nBlack -> Rogue\n\nWhite -> Herald\n\nGray -> Peasant\n\nPoison -> Unchanged (Rogue is immune)\n\nToxic -> Unchanged (Rogue is immune)\n\nBurn -> Unchanged (Artisen is immune)\n\nParalysis -> Unchanged (Herald is immune)\n\nFreeze -> Transformed (Mage is immune)\n\nSleep -> Unchanged (Priest is immune)\n\nPrankster (assuming we keep at least some old abilities) -> Unchanged (Entertainer is immune)\n\nPowder moves -> Unchanged (Peasant is immune)\n\nTrapped -> Unchanged (Noble is immune)\n\nThis is based on Dungeons and Dragons, the Fate franchise and mediaeval fantasy in general.\n\nExample Pokemon:\n\nPriest: Blissey, Comfey, Medicham\n\nNoble: Nidoking, Nidoqueen, Seaking, Kingler, Slowing, Tsareena, Kingdra, Salazzle\n\nMage: Delphox, Alakazam, Hatterene, Hypno\n\nEntertainer: Mr. Mime, Smeargle, Exploud, Noivern, Meloetta, Oricolco, Bellosom, Bellsprout, Lilligant, Chatot\n\nSoldier: Most fighting types, Bisharp, Golurk, Aegislash\n\nArtisen: Conkeldor, Smeargle, Regigigas\n\nDiplomat: Stoutland, Guardevoir, Blissey, Luvdisc\n\nRogue: Most dark types\n\nHerald: Unown, Smeargle, Noivern, Chatot, the Lake Trio, Unfeazant\n\nPeasant: Most normal types\n\nInteractions:\n\nRogue and Peasant: Thugs and criminals prey on ordinary and vulnerable people.\n\nPeasant and powder: Peasants are used to dust.\n\nRogue and Soldier: Thugs can't beat real warriors and warriors often join the watch to police crime.\n\nRogue and Mage: To beat a wizard, catch them by surprise. Assassins and thieves are good at that.\n\nMage and Mage: \"Magic must defeat magic!\" - Uncle, Jackie Chan Adventures\n\nSoldier and Soldier: Soldiers are trained to protect themselves from other soldiers.\n\nMage and Noble: It takes something out of the ordinary to topple a government.\n\nNoble and Priest: The government can pressure the church to declare their divine right to rule.\n\nPriest and Rogue: Priests can convert criminals to a better life of repentance.\n\nPriest and sleep: Priests can continue to commune with their god in their dreams.\n\nRogue and Poison/Toxic: They are too used to dealing with poison in their assassinations.\n\nMage and Transformed: If turned into something immobile, they can magically turn themselves back again.\n\nNoble and Herald: The government can force the media to print propoganda.\n\nHerald and Priest: Propaganda can really hurt churches who depend on the support of the citizens.\n\nNoble and Diplomat: Diplomats cannot afford to offend governments.\n\nDiplomat and Soldier: A diplomat who makes a mistake trying to avert a war is defenceless against an angry general.\n\nDiplomat and Entertainer: Diplomats are experts at manipulating the way they want things portrayed by the entertainment industry.\n\nEntertainer and Soldier: The pen is mightier than the sword. Calm the violent heart with a song. Use patriotic war songs to get warriors on your side.\n\nEntertainer and Artisen: Entertainers inspire artisens to build what they want them to build.\n\nEntertainer and Prankster: They already know all the pranks.\n\nHerald and Paralysis: You don't need to move to shout out the news.\n\nArtisen and Noble: Kingdoms are toppled by the craftsman's siege engines.\n\nArtisen and Burn: They are used to the fire of the forge.\n\nNoble and Trapped: Nobles can rule without leaving their castles. They even enter their castles for safety, as seen in Chess\n\nEdit: Added trapped.\n\nKinda similar to Gravity Monkey's, although his is more medival themed as opposed to yours being more fantasy world. There's a lot of explanations here that make sense but do need some explanation, which could be a point against it but is fine by me; Pokemon itself does this quite a bit. Don't really have much to say, pretty good.\n\nAlthough one thing - I thought the spelling was \"Artisan.\" Is this a regional thing? If not then that will probably need changed.\n\nRed -> Time\n\nOrange -> Abstract\n\nYellow -> Culture\n\nGreen -> Shadow\n\nBlue -> Soul\n\nPurple -> Mind\n\nPink -> Light\n\nBlack -> Tech\n\nWhite -> Solid\n\nGray -> Wild\n\nWild - Related to nature and animals - wild pokemon would be based on animals or possibly plants\n\nView attachment 329968\n\nTech - Related to machines - tech pokemon are mechanical or robotic\n\nView attachment 329969\n\nCulture - Related to civilization - culture pokemon would look like clothing, art, or other cultural artifacts\n\nView attachment 329970\n\nAbstract - Related to math, geometry, and logic - abstract pokemon would be heavily geometric, or symbolic\n\nView attachment 329971\n\nSolid - Related to hard, durable substances - solid pokemon are made of stone, metal, or similar materials\n\nView attachment 329972\n\nTime - Related to the passage of time - time pokemon might look like timekeeping devices, relate to temporal cycles of nature (day/night, seasons), or relate to mortality\n\nLight - Related to physical light - Light pokemon would either generate light or manipulate it in some way (i.e. reflective, iridescent)\n\nView attachment 329973\n\nMind - Related to intelligence and thinking - Mind pokemon would likely have the third eye motif, be more humanoid in appearance, or have massive crania\n\nView attachment 329974\n\nShadow - Related to actual shadows as well as stealth and secrecy - shadow pokemon would be dark in color and represent things that are sneaky\n\nView attachment 329975\n\nSoul - Related to non-physical essence of living things - soul pokemon would be ethereal ghosts and spirits\n\nView attachment 329976\n\nTech >>> Wild - Technology conquers nature\n\nTech >>> Culture - Technology often forces culture to change\n\nCulture >>> Abstract - Laws, customs, and values are all abstract\n\nCulture >><< Culture - Cultures coming into contact with each other invariably causes big changes to both\n\nAbstract >>> Time - Abstract concepts are timeless\n\nAbstract >>> Solid - Things that are physically grounded have trouble hurting things that are abstract\n\nAbstract >>> Light - Light is a fundamental physical constant, so same idea as above\n\nSolid >>> Time - Stone and some metals can last thousands of years without changing too much\n\nSolid <<>> Solid - Solid objects are resilient to bludgeoning from other solid objects\n\nTime >>> Tech - Machines break down, technology becomes obsolete\n\nTIme >>> MInd - Similarly, minds become tired, and require sleep.

I really don't know how I feel about Abstract as a type, given how it's not really easy for me to visualize moves for it and I don't think I've yet wrapped my head around why it interacts with most of the other types the way it does. It might be done perfect, it might not make sense in reality, but even with the explanations I personally am finding it hard to tell. Might just be me though, I'm open to hearing what others think. I also feel like Solid could be given a better name because when I first saw it I thought of the state of matter given some of the other types here. Maybe something like Rough, Dense, or Tough? I dunno.\n\nThat's about it! This post took me an hour to make and I'm sure there are some things that others don't agree with me on or would want to add. Feel free to make\n\nWhat turned into what I hoped would be a small delay turned into a few hours because I fell asleep when I got home. Voting has begun and will last 48 hours! Be sure to check the sub compilation, as well as some of the posts at and below this one in case some people left type matchup reasonings here and didn't update their first post.\n\nVote for the three you like the most, first to third. You can only vote for your own option in the third slot, but voting gives your sub an additional point, so (vote), (vote2), (selfvote) gives (vote) 3 points, (vote2) 2 points, and (selfvote) 2 points.\n\nWith that, here's my submission. I'd like for you to use the template, although using an image like this isn't required.\n\nRed -> Blade\n\nOrange -> Stone\n\nYellow -> Brawn\n\nGreen -> Heat\n\nBlue -> Plastic\n\nPurple -> Paper\n\nPink -> Ceramic\n\nWhite -> Crystal\n\nBlack -> Sweet\n\nGray -> Bone\n\nPoison -> Poison\n\nToxic -> Toxic\n\nBurn -> Polluted\n\nParalysis -> Quicksand\n\nFreeze -> Overheated\n\nSleep -> Sleep\n\n- Rock, Paper, Scissors was the main type chart I'd center this around. Earl suggested I use blade instead and I feel it works best, it's the most broad and can encompass swords and knives while not even implying either. Stone is a stand-in for Rock, and Blade doesn't have to be related to metal.\n\n- Crystals are prone to shattering more than slashing, and you could also make some magic crystal implication to maybe have secondary reason to be strong against Blade. This type would also include things like glass and ice.\n\n- Stones shatter Glass, Glass is resistant to Heat, Heat ignites Paper, but Scoopapa had mentioned that Glass and Crystal could make complications with sprites and a Ceramic-type wouldn't. They have the same properties so good idea, except Ceramic would also include Pokemon centered around the clays and loams that make it.\n\n- Plastic can be used to make mallets that shatter Glass and melt under Heat. Don't remember why exactly it beats Paper, though.\n\n- Sweets are foods that Blades would cut, and are also packaged in Plastic.\n\n- Brawn is a stand-in for Fighting. Fighting beating Rock would translate here, but bodybuilders have to keep in good shape, and they can't eat Sweets.\n\n- Lastly, the sugar in Sweets corrode away teeth, which don't really have many obvious matchups here otherwise. RoDG suggested I change this to Bone to make it less specific, but Pokemon related around teeth can still be involved.\n\n- Plastic is the easiest thing to associate with Polluting, so it's going to take place of Burn's name. I imagine inhaling something noxious or getting some plastic stuck around some part of your body would make it harder to attack stuff, too.\n\n- Quicksand is made from similar stuff that makes Ceramic, and could make it tougher to move.\n\n- Something that's Overheated could be exhausted and incapacitated much like Freezing.\n\nNow for examples of some existing Pokemon that fit each type...\n\nBlade - Bisharp, Gallade, Scyther etc.\n\nStone - Gigalith, Golem, Archeops etc.\n\nBrawn - Machamp, Conkeldurr, Lucario etc.\n\nHeat - Talonflame, Typhlosion, Groudon etc.\n\nPlastic - Garbodor, Porygon, can’t think of much else as of now\n\nPaper - Kartana, can’t think of much else as of now\n\nCeramic - Sandaconda, Polteageist, Claydol etc.\n\nCrystal - Sableye, Diancie, Regice etc.\n\nSweet - Slurpuff, Appletun, Vanilluxe etc.\n\nBone - Lucario, Seviper, Eternatus etc.\n\nSuper Smash Bros.

They do not really affect or are affected by the other types, except for Might.\n\nWeak to Might: Classic trope of a strong/strong willed individual challenging divine beings\n\nMight: Pokemon that are strong, whether in physical strength (most common), mental fortitude, or in willpower.\n\nSE on Divine: see Divine\n\nSE on Wrath: The mighty warrior can take down a rampaging beast\n\nDNE Gluttony: Even the strongest warrior cannot budge a gluttonous creature due to their weight (kind of a stretch)\n\nWeak to Envy: Basic supervillain plotline, weak character is envious of the superhero's strength so they devise a scheme to defeat them\n\nWrath: Pokemon that are angry, destructive, uncontrollable, etc.\n\nSE on Pride: The pride of others make people angry\n\nWeak to Might: see Might\n\nSelf Weak: Two angry creatures will fight each other\n\nPride: Pokemon that are prideful, leaders, overconfident, etc.\n\nSE on Envy: Pride overshadows Envy\n\nSE on Sloth: Prideful people will control the lazy people, force them to act\n\nSE on Purity: Prideful people will manipulate the pure hearted\n\nWeak to Wrath: see Wrath\n\nWeak to Lust: big boba\n\nSloth: Pokemon that are slow, lazy, sleepy, etc.\n\nSE on Envy: Lazy people have nothing to be envious of\n\nSelf Resist: Two lazy opponents wont do anything to each other\n\nWeak to Pride: see Pride\n\nEnvy: Pokemon that are jealous, use trickery, etc.\n\nSE on Might: see Might\n\nSE on Lust: envious of big boba\n\nWeak to Pride: see Pride\n\nWeak to Sloth: see Sloth\n\nLust: Pokemon that are attractive, romantic, etc. (note: this fits better than the original meaning)\n\nSE on Pride: see Pride\n\nWeak to Envy: see Envy\n\nWeak to Greed: money provides big boba\n\nWeak to Gluttony: no big boba, only food\n\nGluttony: Pokemon that are hungry, eat food, food based, etc.\n\nSE on Lust: see Lust\n\nSE on Purity: Being a Glutton tarnishes Purity\n\nSelf Resist: Gluttony is already hungry, would not have much effect\n\nImmune to Might: see Might\n\nWeak to Greed: Money provides food\n\nGreed: Pokemon that are greedy, based on money, etc.\n\nSE on Lust: see Lust\n\nSE on Gluttony: see Gluttony\n\nWeak to Purity: Robin Hood\n\nPurity: Pokemon that are pure hearted, kind, innocent, etc.\n\nSE on Greed: see Greed\n\nSelf Resist: Pure pokemon would not want to harm another\n\nWeak to Pride: see Pride\n\nWeak to Gluttony: see Gluttony\n\nStatuses\n\nAnger and Rage: The pokemon becomes angry, causing them to lose themselves over time.

Light hurts the eyes of cavedwellers, and smoke + enclosed spaces = lung cancer.\n\nHeat beats Artificial because metal can melt.\n\nMinerals also are just really resistant to heat.\n\nNature beats Deep because deep ocean weirdos cant breathe on land (also because nature and Deep were originally grass and water stand-ins).\n\nGloom beats Deep because underground weirdos are wackier than deep sea weirdos.\n\nDeep beats Wind because the wind has no effect on the deep sea.\n\nDeep beats Mineral because water can erode the minerals.\n\nNature beats itself because of survival of the fittest.\n\nArtificial beats Nature because manmade stuff is destroying the environment.\n\nShine beats Magic because it's really hard to concentrate on magic when someone's shining a bright light in your eyes, and because magical curses often end at dawn.\n\nShine beats Gloom for pretty much the same reason that Heat beats gloom, bright lights blind the underground critters.\n\nWind beats Shine because things that can fly are in the sky all the time, and they dont go blind.\n\nMagic resists Magic because magic users know each others' tricks.\n\nMagic beats Gloom because magic is highly effective against spooky things such as ghosts or monsters.\n\nMagic beats Wind because wizards can control the wind with their magic. (yes i know that applies to other things too, be quiet)\n\nMagic beats Artificial because telekinesis exists and can break the machines.\n\nWind just doesnt do much against Wind.\n\nArtificial doesn't effect Magic because magic users can just yeet the machines away from them.\n\nArtificial beats Beast because manmade things are destroying the environment.\n\nMineral self-resists because 2 immovable objects arent gonna do shit to each other.\n\nI quickly lost my sanity trying to write these, can you tell?\n\nRed -> Citizens\n\nOrange -> Clergy\n\nYellow -> Occult\n\nGreen -> Merchants\n\nBlue -> Royals\n\nPurple -> Peasants\n\nPink -> Knights\n\nBlack -> Criminals\n\nWhite -> Artists\n\nGray -> Travellers\n\nPoison -> Curse (Occult & Knights are immune)\n\nToxic -> Hex (Occult & Knights are immune)\n\nBurn -> Hunger (Royals are immune)\n\nParalysis -> Wound (Knights are immune)\n\nFreeze -> Debt (Merchants are immune)\n\nSleep -> Illness\n\nPowder moves are now \"miracles\" I guess\n\nMy types are based of hierarchic roles during the late middle-ages/early renaissance.

It is strong against Mirror because they don't have reflections and strong against Cave because they can turn into bats. Vampire Types could be designed afetr blood-sucking animals and actual vampires\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nSolar\n\nSolar is weak to Shade because the sun cannot touch shadows, and weak to Cave because the sun does not reach caves. It is strong against Vampire for burning them, Wood for burning them and Arid for deteriorating the soil. Solar Types could be designed after incarnations of the Sun, heat and creatures who otherwise are sun-related, such as basking lizards and some plants.\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nView attachment 329551View attachment 329550\n\nShade\n\nShade is weak to Mirror because shadows can be reflected, and weak to itself because combining two shadows will only make it stronger. It is strong against Solar because the Sun cannot touch shadows. Shade Types could be designed after cursed shadows.\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nView attachment 329555View attachment 329554\n\nFungi\n\nFungi is weak to Arid because they need humid environments to thrive. It is strong against Caves because caves are usually humid and dark, giving the perfect conditions for them to live in, and strong against Mineral because they can deteriorate the minerals. Fungi Types could be mostly based on Mushrooms and Moss.\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nView attachment 329556\n\nMineral\n\nMineral is weak to Fungi because fungus can deteriorate minerals. They are strong against Cave because they are usually located inside caves, and against Arid because mineral salt can be used to help treat the soil. They are immune to Mirror because Minerals are typically already reflective. Mineral Types could vary from non-mechanic metallic beings to crystal creatures.\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nView attachment 329564View attachment 329565View attachment 329566\n\nCave\n\nCave is weak to Fungi because caves give them perfect conditions to spread, to Vampire because they can turn into Bats, and to Mineral because they're where minerals are most usually formed. It is strong against Solar because the sun cannot reach caves. Cave Types could be designed after cave dwellers, both real and mythological\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nView attachment 329568\n\nArid\n\nArid is weak to Solar because the scorching sun deteriorates the soil futher, and to Mineral because Saltes can help to get rid of arid soil. It is strong against Fungi because Fungi cannot grow in places with low humidity. Arid Types could be based on the cracked soil and on desert creatures.\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nView attachment 329551\n\nMirror\n\nMirror is weak to Vampires because they don't have reflections, and has no effect on Mineral because they're often already reflective. Mirror is super-effective against Shade because shadows can be reflected, and to Magic becauseof the popular trope of magic being reflected back at the user. Mirror Types would be pokémon who represent the concept of Reflection or Imitation in some way.\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nView attachment 329555\n\nWood\n\nWood is weak to Solar because wood burns with too much heat, and strong against Vampire because of wooden stakes. Wood Types would be mostly made of trees, as well as beings who are either made of wood or use wooden tools.\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nMagic\n\nMagic is weak against Mirror because of the trope ofmagic being reflected back at the attacker, and neutral against everything else because of Magic being very versatile on its spells. Magic Types would either be creatures who do magic or who are in some way related to magic.\n\nVanilla Examples of pokémon who fit the type:\n\nView attachment 329574View attachment 329575View attachment 329576\n\nWither and Decay end this destiny\n\nSimillar to poison, only with the idea that Arid mons would be more resilient due to their harsher living conditions and Shade because you can't decay a shade.\n\nCrystalize\n\nThe idea is that the Pokémon's body would be either start being covered in crystals or being turned into crystals itself. It halves Attack for the lack of control over a sudden unusual body change, and Mineral is immune to it because they are already Crystals.\n\nFatigue\n\nRelated to the idea that Cavernous places and Deserts are harder to live on and tire you out faster if you are not prepared, leading to lower negery (Speed) and exaustion (Skips a turn).\n\nInfected\n\nRelated to the idea of a fungus infecting a body and rendering it unable to fight.\n\nThermal\n\nThe Sun would overpower whatever is trying to change the temperature.\n\nRed -> Flow\n\nOrange ->Patch\n\nYellow ->Break\n\nGreen -> Shock\n\nBlue -> Relief\n\nPurple -> Pressure\n\nPink -> Stress\n\nBlack -> Improvement\n\nWhite -> Drain\n\nGray -> Sameness\n\nPoison -> Stress (Break and Stress are immune)\n\nToxic -> Dire Stress (Break and Stress are immune)\n\nBurn -> Pacify (Relief is immune)\n\nParalysis -> trapped (Pressure is immune)\n\nFreeze -> Shocked (Shock is immune)\n\nSleep -> Dozing\n\nOkay so this is all very weird and abstract. I feel as though there needs to be a better explanation to all of this so uhh I can try.\n\nFlow in this case refers to more of a steady flow, that can't really be changed. On top of that going with the flow can alleviate pressure from someone. However you patch the flow in, it can't really go anywhere. You drain a flow and well it gets drained.\n\nAs stated before if you patch a flow it can't really go anywhere. However if you break off the patch then it becomes useless. Put to much pressure on a patch and it'll become useless.\n\nBreak in this case refers to breaking something. If you break is strong against itself because if you keep breaking something that is broken you just break it even more and leave it in a worse state. Improvement is strong against break because if you improve something to be better prepared against a break, then the break will do less damage. An improvement can stop breaks. Anyway why is Break immune to the Stress status conditions? The answer is that breaking things can help people relieve stress by allowing them to express that stress in a violent manner.\n\nShock is not referring to electricity in this case but more of the emotion of being shocked. Shock can cause pressure or break someone out of it, and likewise a great enough shock can disturb the relief of anyone.\n\nRelief is strong against pressure and stress for the same reason really. With enough relief you stop being stressed and the pressure upon you is reduced. Likewise relief is strong against itself because if you become more relieved you're still relieved. Nothing really changes that much.\n\nPressure is a fun one because it can refer to the pressure placed upon a person or the physical pressure gravity brings. Also I've already explained it through the other types.\n\nStress is very similar to pressure in concept, however you might wonder why it resists itself. It's like this, if one thing is making you stressed and other thing is making you stressed the two things aren't in competition. It's not a matter of, \"This is stressing me out more than the other thing\" and more of a matter of \"Holy shit both of these things are stressing me the fuck out! Christ on a bike this is awful!\". Thus in my mind I view stress being resistant against itself rather than strong against itself. As for why it's strong against shock, stress can often be the source of shock. If someone who's stressed takes expresses their emotions in a nontraditional manner it will often illicit shock. If someone dies from stress the news of the death can cause shock to various people.\n\nImprovement is one of the weirdest typings. Already explained the relationship it has with break, and improvement vs sameness is pretty obvious, but what about Improvement Vs Relief. Well my justification is that as life improves, as we improve, in theory relief would become something that is more attainable and when you're relieved you don't feel the need to improve. That's my idea behind it anyway.\n\nDrain's main match ups are against patch and flow. Drain a flow and it gets redirected, put a patch over a drain and it becomes useless. Pretty simple.\n\nSameness: Improvement beats it for obvious reasons and it's neutral against everything else because it really isn't effecting anything. It's leaving things as they are.\n\nRed -> Priest\n\nOrange -> Noble\n\nYellow -> Mage\n\nGreen -> Entertainer\n\nBlue -> Soldier\n\nPurple -> Artisan\n\nPink -> Diplomat\n\nBlack -> Rogue\n\nWhite -> Herald\n\nGray -> Peasant\n\nPoison -> Unchanged (Rogue is immune)\n\nToxic -> Unchanged (Rogue is immune)\n\nBurn -> Unchanged (Artisan is immune)\n\nParalysis -> Unchanged (Herald is immune)\n\nFreeze -> Transformed (Mage is immune)\n\nSleep -> Unchanged (Priest is immune)\n\nPrankster (assuming we keep at least some old abilities) -> Unchanged (Entertainer is immune)\n\nPowder moves -> Unchanged (Peasant is immune)\n\nTrapped -> Unchanged (Noble is immune)\n\nThis is based on Dungeons and Dragons, the Fate franchise and mediaeval fantasy in general.\n\nExample Pokemon:\n\nPriest: Blissey, Comfey, Medicham, Bronzong, Arceus\n\nBasically any Pokemon associated with healing, divinity, worship, temples etc.\n\nMoves include Wish and Judgement\n\nNoble: Nidoking, Nidoqueen, Seaking, Kingler, Slowking, Tsareena, Kingdra, Salazzle, Durant, Vespiqueen, Beedrill\n\nBasically any Pokemon associated with rulership, royalty, government, land ownership, beurocracy etc.\n\nMoves would include Ally Swap, Follow Me and Heavy Slam\n\nMage: Delphox, Alakazam, Hatterene, Hypno, Shiftree, Mismagius\n\nBasically any Pokemon associated with magic\n\nMoves would include Hypnosis, Trick and Mystical Fire\n\nEntertainer: Mr. Mime, Smeargle, Exploud, Noivern, Meloetta, Oricolco, Bellosom, Bellsprout, Lilligant, Chatot, Bronzong, Chimecho, Primariana\n\nBasically any Pokemon associated with performance art, dancing, music, comedy etc.\n\nMoves would include Sing, Role Play, Dragon Dance and Double Slap\n\nSoldier: Most fighting types, Bisharp, Golurk, Aegislash, Samurott, Decidueye\n\nBasically any Pokemon based on martial arts, warriors, weapons etc.\n\nMoves would like include Power-Up Punch, No Retreat, Bulk Up and Jump Kick\n\nArtisan: Conkeldor, Smeargle, Regigigas, Ariados, Galvantula, Leavanny, Wormadam, Nincada\n\nBasically any Pokemon associated with building, visual art, creation, tools etc.\n\nMoves would include Decorate, Sketch, Wood Hammer and Poltergeist\n\nDiplomat: Stoutland, Guardevoir, Blissey, Luvdisc, Plusle, Minun, Wishiwashi\n\nBasically any Pokemon associated with happiness, community, helping others, relationships etc.\n\nMoves would include Helping Hand, Attract, Charm and Draining Kiss\n\nRogue: Most dark types, Decidueye, Gengar, Mismagius, Drifblim, Banette, Dusknoir, Chandelure, Trapinch, Dugtrio, Exeggcute, Amoongus, Geodude, Electrode\n\nBasically any Pokemon associated with stealth, surprise, crime, dirty tactics etc.\n\nMost dark moves would fit.\n\nHerald: Unown, Smeargle, Noivern, Chatot, the Lake Trio, Unfeazant, the Regis, Stonejourner, Porygon-Z, Ditto\n\nBasically any Pokemon associated with copying, messages, language, writing, sound, information, teaching etc.\n\nMoves would include Mimic, Instruct and Boomburst\n\nPeasant: Most normal types, Pawniard\n\nBasically any Pokemon associated with ordinary life, the common folk, poverty, mundanity, dirt etc.\n\nMoves include Tackle and Growl\n\nInteractions:\n\nRogue and Peasant: Thugs and criminals prey on ordinary and vulnerable people.\n\nPeasant and powder: Peasants are used to dust.\n\nRogue and Soldier: Thugs can't beat real warriors and warriors often join the watch to police crime.\n\nRogue and Mage: To beat a wizard, catch them by surprise.

Think of it like the Rock and Ground separation.\n\nElectron -> Electron (self resist): Electrons repel each other\n\nElectron -> Matter: Electricity and electrons can corrode matter (Galvanic Corrosion, Reduction-Oxidation reactions)\n\nEnergy -> Energy (self resist): Energy doesn't do much when there's already energy\n\nEnergy -> Inertia: Energy makes things stop being inert\n\nGravity -> Energy: Gravity makes it harder for energy to be used and things to move\n\nGravity -> Gravity (self resist): The gravity of two objects attracting each other have opposite forces\n\nGravity -> Motion: Gravity makes it harder to move\n\nInertia -> Gravity: Inertia makes it hard for even gravity to affect objects\n\nInertia -> Motion: Inertia makes it hard to move\n\nMatter -> Motion: Motion abruptly stops if when it hits something with lots of matter.\n\nMatter -> Vacuum: Vacuum is absence of matter. Matter \"ends\" vacuum.\n\nMotion -> Wave: Stationary waves can go on for a long time (like a pendulum), but traveling waves are short lived (like a loud bang).\n\nParticle -> Particle (self weakness): Two of the four fundamental interactions are the weak and strong particles interactions. (Strong nuclear force and Weak nuclear force)\n\nParticle -> Wave: Outside of the quantum scale, waves act as particles. (Wave-particle duality)\n\nVacuum -> Aether: People believed Aether was what space was made out of, until they figured out it was vacuum.\n\nVacuum -> Gravity: Vacuum has no effect on Gravity, planets affect each other with nothing between them\n\nVacuum -> Particle: A few particles aren't enough to make vacuum stop being vacuum. Vacuum just rips particles apart.\n\nWave -> Electron: Electrons move like waves and can get wave interference.\n\nWave -> Energy: Waves emit and \"waste\" energy (Thermal radiation)\n\nWave -> Matter: Waves are dynamic disturbances that can go through matter (like sound waves or waves going through the ocean)\n\nIn bold are stuff you can google if you're not familiar with the physics I'm talking about.\n\nNuclear Decay and Nuclear Fission (Particle and Energy are immune): Particles and energy are the two things emitted by Nuclear Decay/Fission.\n\nBurn -> Weight (Gravity is immune): Every other Pokemon type would not be used to heavy weight, except the Gravity one.\n\nParalysis -> Enthalpy (Energy is immune): If there's enough energy, things will happen (chemical reactions, particle emissions, movements, etc). If there's not enough energy, things won't happen. That's a rough explanation of entalphy.\n\nFreeze -> Stillness (Inertia is immune): Every other Pokemon type would not be used to stillness, except the Inertia one.\n\nSleep -> Timestop (nothing in physics is immune to timestop)\n\nRed -> Artificial\n\nOrange -> Ghoul\n\nYellow -> Piscine\n\nGreen -> Reptile\n\nBlue -> Slime\n\nPurple -> Mineral\n\nPink -> Beast\n\nGray -> Arthropod\n\nBlack -> Avian\n\nWhite -> Plant\n\nBurn -> Acid\n\nPoison -> Bleed\n\nToxic -> Severe Bleeding\n\nParalyze -> Chilled\n\nFreeze -> Hunger\n\nPowder -> Dust\n\nTrap and Sleep are not renamed\n\nExplanations (Designs and Aesthetics):\n\nArtificial - Related to machines, technologies, electronic devices, buildings, and other types of man-made objects.\n\nGhoul - Related to ghosts, goblins, witches, fairies, and other fairy tale monsters.\n\nPiscine - Related to fish and other aquatic animals.\n\nReptile - Related to reptiles, amphibians, and animals with reptilian characteristics.\n\nSlime - Related to sticky substances, slimes, and diseases.\n\nMineral - Related to rocks, gems, and metal ores.\n\nBeast - Related to mammals and animals with mammalian characteristics.\n\nArthropod - Related to insects, arachnids, and crustaceans.\n\nAvian - Related to birds and other flying/gliding animals.\n\nPlant - Related to plants and fungi.\n\nExplanations (Type Matchups and Immunities):\n\nArtificial -> Avian: Birds sometimes crash into buildings, windows, and other structures.\n\nArtificial -> Mineral: Machines are used to destroy rocks and dig up minerals and ores.\n\nGhoul -> Plant: Some ghouls can be considered monstrous entities that harm nature.\n\nGhoul -> Artificial: Ghouls and spiritual entities are infamous for tampering with technological devices and machines.\n\nGhoul -> Beast: Ghouls are typically smarter than beasts and as such they would be able to outsmart or tame beasts.\n\nPiscine -> Piscine (self weak): Many aquatic animals eat other aquatic animals.\n\nPiscine -> Ghoul: Fish meat smells bad and I'm pretty sure spiritual entities, much like everyone else, do not like horrible smells.\n\nReptile -> Mineral: In some stories, reptiles (especially dragons) are known to steal and horde gems and crystals.\n\nReptile -> Slime: Many reptiles have strong immune systems that would allow them to overcome diseased or sticky entities.\n\nSlime -> Slime (self resist): I imagine that slimy substances would mix together rather than having one substance overcome and completely dissolve the other.\n\nSlime -> Beast: Sticky substances can easily get caught in the fur of mammals and weigh them down.\n\nSlime -> Mineral: Acids and bases can be used to dissolve rocks and minerals.\n\nMineral -> Ghoul: Crystals and gems are thought to ward off evil spirits.\n\nBeast -> Beast (self resist): Many mammals have loose skin so they have less of a chance of being injured from scratches and bites.\n\nBeast -> Reptile: After the extinction of the dinosaurs, mammals took the title of the dominant animal group from the reptiles.\n\nAvian -> Arthropod: Many flying animals such as birds and bats love to eat bugs and spiders.\n\nAvian -> Slime (no effect): Sticky substances can easily get caught between feathers and prevent birds from flying. This would make avian Pokemon hesitant to attack slime Pokemon.\n\nAvian -> Piscine: Many birds eat fish. It would be hard for an aquatic animal to attack an airborne animal.\n\nPlant -> Plant (self resist): Many plants live in close proximity with each other and as such they must be able to survive the negative effects of neighboring plants.\n\nPlant -> Artificial: This is the most interesting matchup since most people would say that Artificial beats Plants, but I wanted to try something different. It is true that human technologies can destroy and harm plants and nature itself, but plants and nature can overcome human technologies and machines. They can survive and even thrive in man-made environments (examples include vines that cling to the sides of buildings and weeds that grow in between the cracks in driveways). When plants and machines are left to their own devices, the plants take over and grow all over the machines (just look at pictures of cars that are left in the woods). After there is a natural disaster, nature recovers way faster than we can and even takes over abandoned towns and cities. In the short term machines beat plants, but in the long term plants beat machines.\n\nExplanations (Statuses and Immunities):\n\nAcid - Acids can resemble flames because they both have the ability to burn things. Slime Pokemon would be immune to this because many Slime Pokemon would already be considered acidic.\n\nBleed - Much like poison, this would drain a Pokemon of their energy and make them lose health. Beast Pokemon would be immune to this because mammals have loose skin that helps lessen the chances of receiving nasty wounds. Piscine Pokemon would be immune because water can help with blood clotting and all fish have a slimy coat that helps in the process of blood clotting.\n\nSevere Bleeding - Kind of like bleeding, but much more severe.\n\nChilled - It is hard to move when you are cold. Beasts are immune to this because mammals are warm-blooded animals and as such they can survive in cold temperatures (I would've loved it if black/avian was immune to this because birds are also warm-blooded animals, but that decision is completely out of my control).\n\nHunger - Sometimes you are so hungry that you barely have the strength to move (or is that just a trope?). Reptile Pokemon are immune to this because many reptiles have a slow metabolism. Having a slow metabolism means you do not have to eat often. Some reptiles can go months without eating.\n\nDust - Dust is not much different from powder. Many ghouls tend to be in dusty places such as abandoned buildings, so they must be able to tolerate the dust particles.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk.\n\nRed -> Honor\n\nOrange -> Nature\n\nYellow -> Decay\n\nGreen -> Crash\n\nBlue -> Business\n\nPurple -> Primal\n\nPink -> Resource\n\nWhite -> Prank\n\nBlack -> Evil\n\nGray -> Peace\n\nBurn -> Fired\n\nParalysis -> Hunger\n\nPoison/Bad Poison -> Decay/Rapid Decay\n\nFreeze -> Halt\n\nOther status ailments have the same names\n\nHonor type is essentially an orderly, just type, one whose mons are willing to follow a code of ethics of some kind. This includes chivalrous beings, but also those who follow rules of a certain fighting style. Honor beats Primal, since its presence tames the more rowdy Primal beings, and it beats Evil due to the same heroic reasoning that Fighting beats out Dark with.\n\nNature type is representative of the natural world. Forests, waterfalls, mountains, clouds, and even things like volcanoes and tornadoes. Nature beats Honor, as Nature is highly unpredictable, not really following any sort of code. It beats Resource, since Nature is the source of pretty much all Resources. It also beats Prank, since the natural order of things is not disturbed by simple Pranking. It's also immune to Powder, since Nature is the source of natural powders\n\nDecay type is a type that represents things that break down other things via their toxicity. Dangerous chemicals, pollution, toxic smoke, venom, and radiation. It beats the Nature type, since things like pollution and radiation are serious problems that disrupt the ecosystem, while it beats itself due to its inherent instability. However, it's immune to the status effects of Decay and Rapid Decay, since that's sort of the state those beings are in naturally.\n\nCrash type is a type that represents crashing. From literal crashes and impacts (car crashes, meteoric impacts) to more figurative crashes (party crashing, market crashing). It beats Business, since market crashes can be devastating to the economy and thus businesses, while it beats Primal because of the popular theory that a giant meteor wiped out the dinosaurs. It is immune to Halt, since crashing requires there to be momentum, which makes it tough to stop them.\n\nBusiness type is full of those beings that want to make a deal. They represent the business process, businessmen, and money/moneymaking. It resists itself, since businessmen can usually recognize and resist a sales pitch if they need to. It beats Primal, since like Honor, it basically civilizes the more Primal societies. It beats Resource since Business usually controls the flow of resources. And finally, it beats and is immune to Evil type since money is the root of all evil. Business is immune to the Fired status, since the businesses are the ones doing the firing.\n\nPrimal type is essentially full of primal and prehistoric beasts and beings, including dinosaurs, mammoths, sabertooth tigers, neanderthals, crocs and sharks, and more. It beats Nature type, since Primal beings live off the fat of the land.\n\nResource is meant to represent common resources. Food, shelter, and clothing are pretty obvious, but other things like information and even Internet access are resources, and there are likely more that could be used here. Resource beats Crash, since an abundance of Resources is generally the best way to recover from both literal and figurative crashes. It's also immune to Decay/Rapid Decay, since an abundance of resources helps to offset the decay of them, while it's immune to Hunger since having food as a resource staves it off.\n\nEvil type is basically just Dark without the elemental pretext. Hooligans, rapscallions, villains, whatever you want to call them, they're twiddling their mustaches and plotting their next evil scheme. Evil beats Decay, since Evil people would be the type to cause them to decay further, which is just dastardly. Evil type also beats Peace, due to the whole idea of Evil acts being considered \"disturbing the peace\".\n\nPrank type is full of jokesters and tricksters. Not malevolent, per se, they just get a kick out of surprising other people. They beat the Honor type, since Pranks can often betray Honor (I considered having a link to Never Gonna Give You Up here, but I think just mentioning it proves my point).\n\nPeace type is simple, peaceful. It has no explicitly winning matchups, since it simply is full of those that fit the status quo.\n\nRed becomes Order, the alignment and organization of things. Order is the pursuit of making things the way they should be- the process of taking disarray and returning it into a more stable state. Pokemon that fit this typing are those that build things, such as and , as well as pokemon that stand for justice and fight evil, such as and .\n\nOrange becomes Shock, the typing associated with violent change, explosions, and electric shock. Shock is a sudden shake-up of one's current reality. Many electric type pokemon fit this typing such as and , as well as pokemon that use the element of surprise, or quick movements, such as and .\n\nYellow becomes Time, the unwavering passage of events. Time, being a fundamental reality of the universe, is admittedly not the easiest typing to fit onto pokemon. However, Pokemon such as and who control time certainly match this typing, as well as pokemon who are strongly affected by time or are quite ancient creatures, such as , , and .\n\nGreen becomes Primal, the earliest state of matter. Primal is the beginning of all things. Rock and fire pokemon fit this typing, as well as pokemon older than time. Pokemon such as , , , , , and would be considered Primal Pokemon.\n\nBlue becomes Death, The end of corporeal being and life itself. Ghost pokemon fit this typing, as well as any pokemon associated with death, such as , , , and .\n\nPurple becomes Nature, Symbolising the natural balance of the world, as well as flora, fauna, and the world that supports such beings. Grass and ground type pokemon fit this typing, as well as pokemon directly connected to nature, such as , , , and .\n\nPink becomes Life, the type representing creating life, as well as all living things. Many normal types fit this typing. Pokemon such as , , , , and fit this typing.\n\nBlack becomes Chaos, representing entropy and disorder. Dark type pokemon fit this typing well, as well as mischevious, evil, or dangerous pokemon. Pokemon such as , , , , and would be considered Chaos type.\n\nWhite becomes Conflict, representing fighting, disagreement, and clashing ideas. Many fighting-type pokemon, as well as rabble-rousers and those associated with disruption would be conflict types. , , , and fit the Conflict type.\n\nGray becomes Creation, specifically pokemon that were created and given life. This type is associated with technology, and digital pokemon such as , , , and .\n\nPowder is renamed to Ritual, as in moves that are themselves rituals, or take a moment to use. Shock pokemon move too fast and strike too quickly to be targeted by a thought-out attack.\n\nPoison is renamed to Despair. Toxic Poison is renamed to Hopelessness. Time heals all wounds, and Life always finds a way to overcome.\n\nFreeze is renamed to Change. Only Primal is immune to change, as it's defined by being at the beginning of everything.\n\nBurn is renamed to Decay. Death is immune to decay, as it has already died.\n\nParalysis is renamed to Logic. Only Life has the ability to behave illogically, and is instead guided by will and emotion.\n\nOrder is strong against and resists Chaos. Order is the process of undoing chaos. Order needs chaos to exist, there is no order without Chaos.\n\nOrder is strong against and resists Nature. Order takes what is natural and restores it, or puts it into further arrangement.\n\nShock is strong against Order. A sharp shock is needed to set order out of alignment, and disrupt the process of order.\n\nShock is strong against and resists Life. A violent action is needed to end life, and life can be ended in a moment.\n\nShock is strong against and resists Conflict. A sharp change in state can begin or end a conflict- shock precedes conflict. Conflict can only feed the sharp change of shock.\n\nTime is strong against and resists Shock. A brief shock is nothing to the passage of time.\n\nTime is strong against Time. Time cannot be defeated, only waited out.\n\nPrimal is strong against and resists Death. Death returns a being to their primal state. Primal existed before death and will exist after the last being has passed.\n\nPrimal is strong against and resists Nature. Nature is born from Primal, thus Primal precedes nature and is the underlying form of matter.\n\nDeath is strong against and resists Nature. Death puts a stop to natural beings.\n\nDeath is strong against and resists Life. All living things must die.\n\nDeath is strong against and is IMMUNE to Chaos. The only way to avoid entropy is to cease existence. Chaos cannot touch what is already gone.\n\nDeath resists Death. What is already dead cannot die.\n\nNature is strong against and resists Shock. Nature cares not for brief changes, and continues on unchanged.\n\nLife is strong against and resists Primal. Life has the ability to transform the primal and move beyond what primal provides. Life is the culmination of the primal, the final product. Without life, Primal is meaningless.\n\nLife resists Life. Even in death, life creates further life. It's the circle of liiiiife!\n\nChaos is strong against and resists Time. Chaos feeds on time, warping the world further with each passing moment.\n\nChaos is strong against and resists Creation. Everything created is eventually destroyed.\n\nConflict is strong against Order. Order requires unity and peace to progress. Conflict always begins the undoing of order.\n\nConflict resists Conflict. Conflict to conflict only creates more conflict.\n\nAlso, 48 hour warning for signing up to help make moves, abilities, and items!
