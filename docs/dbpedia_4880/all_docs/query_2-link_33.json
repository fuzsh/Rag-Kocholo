        "text": "BjörkWriter(s) Björk\n\nSpacesProducer(s) BjörkLength 3:45\n\nVulnicura track listing\n\n\"Quicksand\" is a song by Björk from her ninth studio album, Vulnicura.\n\nBackground[]\n\n\"Quicksand\" is the oldest song on Vulnicura, written in 2011 after Björk's mother suffered a heart attack that left her in a coma for a week.[1] It's one of two songs on the album (along with Mouth Mantra) that is not about Björk's breakup.\n\nBjörk told Irish Times that she sampled a song by Spaces on \"Quicksand\":[2]\n\n\"I’d been trying to put some beats to Quicksand and nothing worked,” Björk says. “It’s a song about my mother who had a heart attack and she was in a coma for six days – she’s much better now – so it’s in a different category to all my other songs because I’d never written a song about my mother before.\n\n\"I heard John’s [Spaces] beat online and I knew immediately that it would fit exactly with the song. I contacted him and it was very awkward because I had never worked like this before. I said to him, ‘it seems like I’ve made a mash-up of your song and my song and this is what we got. Are you okay with this, can I release it, how do you feel about this?’ John said yes and we put it on the album. I was really lucky that he was up for it.\"\n\nVR[]\n\nBjörk Digital ran from 29 June to 18 July 2016 in Tokyo, Japan at Miraikan, where Björk made history by featuring in the world's first ever virtual reality live stream, broadcast on YouTube.[3] She gave a live performance of \"Quicksand\", and the footage was later incorporated into the \"Quicksand\" VR experience which debuted months later.\n\nLyrics[]"
