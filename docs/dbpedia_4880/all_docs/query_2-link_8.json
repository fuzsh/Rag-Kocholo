I am not a game second try absolutes hey look who’s talking?! the one last seen looking good hold the line would it hurt to look out for each-other? no divide i can’t help it i have a very fatalistic mind never mind identity it bounces off you and sticks to me hey! feeling good hold the line we’ve got to look out for each other no divide i can’t help it i have a very fatalistic mind\n\n3.\n\nWarm And Low 03:48\n\nwarm and low, stole from thieves confusion so down with these selected friends sworn enemies tell me what you need breathless second sight in an abstract mode see how it reads more high than it shows exorcise and better clothes tell me what you know sunlight ready keep me warm and low an invisible thing to contemplate pushed us too far behind the gates with too much love to ever recreate sunlight ready keep me warm and low out of sight\n\n4.\n\n> 00:47\n\n5.\n\nCosmonauts 04:08\n\ndraw the line in a spiral it won't be long before you call to go through these lack of certainties still acting like you know something that you don't in the light where you are it's alright where you are compromising to follow to it’s natural end still close enough to feel the blame how long can I stay? before we disintegrate in the light where you are it’s alright where you are\n\n6.\n\nInteriors 04:58\n\nturn it around, unfix the fix you’ve already made too many promises to keep on like this everyday you’re shot like a stranger to the earth the big secret of dealing with people that you’re just sick of refrain, reframe\n\n7.\n\nHyperion 04:34\n\nall your tears have fallen down by love exploding jealousy’s erupted you won’t drown I know it it’s like woe, cold betrayal makes me feel so unstable hard to read encrypted carry on unscripted flown away like sunshine shot through a hurricane all your tears have fallen carry on unbroken jealousy as you wanted to hold on to someone else flown away\n\n8.\n\nFire This Time 03:22\n\nits a lie kept inside It’s a chance we take going clear in the now and the here, ready? see how you feel in the morning overslept, what’d you expect? it came without a warning it’s a ride, it’s arrived fire this time do what you like all day petrified, catch your flight before it flies away why so tense up on the fence shock your heart back in it it’s a ride, it’s on fire there’s no other way to spin it it’s alright, look inside fire this time\n\n9.\n\nwatching now i see more frequent warning signs everybody's talking about the end paranoid self-employed working man blood moon is closing in fast and it feels like a weight has been lifted oh what are the odds? with your head in the clouds loves lost, misplaced and loves found oh great, move on to business what you say? new phone, who is this? and it feels like a weight has been lifted\n\n10.\n\n>> 01:36\n\n11.\n\nSick Mind 03:13\n\nallied in your lie for the last time i am a light in your life when you fall again for betraying your friends you’ll say it was all out of my hands but that was always your plan sick mind disastrous kind you’re gonna need help to fix your treacherous self both loved and despised you got a sick mind\n\n12.\n\nNormal Love 04:16"
