        "text": "“On my second Quicksand tour I brought out my video camera, and put together a home made 90-minute tour documentary, called “Quicksand The Movie.” Quicksand was touring on “Slip,” and we had just come off the Anthrax/White Zombie tour. I was the “drum tech,” but was only really part of the Quicksand crew because they wanted their bros to share in the fun.\n\nThe tour was with our friends Rage Against The Machine, who had just released their first CD, and for a month in the fall of 1993 we toured the U.S. together in the 1500 – 3500 capacity club circuit. It was a wild, exciting time for all of us. We all felt like the kids who got handed the keys to the candy store. All of us, Zack De La Rocha from Rage included, still felt totally out of place, and way more aligned to our hardcore roots then the rock circuit world we were now in.\n\nKeep in mind we were a bunch of kids in their early twenties, who for the past 5 years had toured only in vans, slept in squats or some kid’s house. We were dudes who more or less had been blowing around the country and Europe much like a tumbleweed, no real direction, nor purpose, but just a belief that as long as you kept on perpetually moving you would one day get some place, eventually…well MAYBE."
