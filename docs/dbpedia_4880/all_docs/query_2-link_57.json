        "text": "Recorded and mixed by Graeme Gibson at the band's own Clava Studio in Chicago with additional recording by Mikael Jorgensen and Joe Ferguson. Recorded on 16-track 2\" 3M, M79 with an Amek Big28 console, and mixed into Pro Tools - it sounds really natural, fuzzy and good. A great-sounding room and Coles 4038 ribbon mics don't hurt. Sounds weave in and out of the songs, drums get a bit of real room on them, vocals get some grit occasionally. Really nice on headphones. (www.thrilljockey.com)"
