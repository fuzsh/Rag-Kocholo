        "text": "If just watching the trailer for The Lodge had you on the edge of your seat, I can understand why maybe you're not ready to watch the whole film, especially in a dark theater. The psychological thriller, from the directors of Goodnight Mommy Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala, stars Riley Keough as Grace, the young soon-to-be-stepmom and former member of a cult run by her dad. The movie starts with one hell of a gruesome scene and only gets better from there. So if you're not willing to check out the whole creepy film, keep reading to see all the details you're going to miss.\n\nThe story starts with Laura (Alicia Silverstone) taking her kids (Jaeden Martell and Lia McHugh) to their dad's (Richard Armitage) house. Upon arriving, Richard tells Laura that it's time to finalize their divorce because he wants to marry Grace (Keough), and Laura can't handle it.\n\nWhen Debbie Reynolds died on Wednesday at the age of 84, she had been famous for more than 65 years. A multi-talented star who fixed her place in the Hollywood firmaments when she was just 19 years old (the same age that her daughter, the late Carrie Fisher, was introduced to the world as Princess Leia), Reynolds’ life was the stuff of Tinseltown legend, and she never seemed to grow tired of the spotlight. On the contrary, she was a force of nature until the bitter end, brightening almost every corner of showbiz at one point or another during her decades on stage and screen.\n\nRead More: Debbie Reynolds’ Co-Stars and More Celebrities Mourn Her Passing on Twitter\n\nA hit recording artist, an Oscar (and Tony)-nominated leading lady, a Las Vegas lounge sensation, and a dedicated collector of movie memorabilia (some of her most heroic efforts were dedicated to the preservation of...\n\nAnother release of the Kramer-Foreman-Zinnemann classic gives Savant another chance to make his argument that this supposedly 'liberal' movie is too confused to be anything but political quicksand -- if anything, its statement is bitterly hawkish.

The Charles Brackett Diaries: Gay Rumors quashed, troubled Billy Wilder partnership discussed in Q&A with Anthony Slide See previous post: “Charles Brackett Diaries: Politics and Gossip During the Studio Era.” First of all, how did you become involved in this Charles Brackett project? And what did your editorial job entail? I discovered the diaries about six years ago when I was asked by Brackett's grandson, Jim Moore, to place a financial value on them during the process of his donating them to the Margaret Herrick Library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. It was clear to me that these diaries had not only considerable financial worth, but also, and perhaps more importantly, they were primary resources in the study of Hollywood history. Happily, Charles Brackett's family (who own the copyright) gave permission for me to edit the diaries,...\n\nBilly Wilder directed Sunset Blvd. with Gloria Swanson and William Holden. Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett movies Below is a list of movies on which Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder worked together as screenwriters, including efforts for which they did not receive screen credit. The Wilder-Brackett screenwriting partnership lasted from 1938 to 1949. During that time, they shared two Academy Awards for their work on The Lost Weekend (1945) and, with D.M. Marshman Jr., Sunset Blvd. (1950). More detailed information further below. Post-split years Billy Wilder would later join forces with screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond in movies such as the classic comedy Some Like It Hot (1959), the Best Picture Oscar winner The Apartment (1960), and One Two Three (1961), notable as James Cagney's last film (until a brief comeback in Milos Forman's Ragtime two decades later). Although some of these movies were quite well received, Wilder's later efforts – which also included The Seven Year Itch...\n\nMurder mysteries are so commonplace on TV that each week offers seemingly dozens of them on police procedural series and detective shows. But in the movies, whodunits are surprisingly rare, and really good ones rarer still. There's really only a handful of movies that excel in offering the viewer the pleasure of solving the crime along with a charismatic sleuth, often with an all-star cast of suspects hamming it up as they try not to appear guilty.\n\nOne of the best was \"Murder on the Orient Express,\" released 40 years ago this week, on November 24, 1974. Like many films adapted from Agatha Christie novels, this one featured an eccentric but meticulous investigator (in this case, Albert Finney as Belgian epicure Hercule Poirot), a glamorous and claustrophobic setting (here, the famous luxury train from Istanbul to Paris), and a tricky murder plot with an outrageous solution. The film won an Oscar for passenger...\n\nBlu-ray & DVD Release Date: May 28, 2013\n\nPrice: DVD $24.95, Blu-ray $29.95\n\nStudio: Olive Films\n\nBarbara Stanwyck and Wendell Corey get deceptive in The File on Thelma Jordon.\n\nThe 1950 film noir drama The File on Thelma Jordon is directed by noir veteran Robert Siodmak (The Dark Mirror).\n\nIn the film, Barbara Stanwyck (1953′s Titanic) is the titular Thelma Jordon, a woman who seduces the married Assistant District Attorney (Wendell Corey, Hell’s Half Acre) and pulls him into a web of theft and murder. When her aunt’s mansion is burglarized and the woman is murdered, Thelma calls the Assistant Da to help her cover up evidence that may incriminate her.

Friday (July 15), he'll introduce several films made by Western star Tex Ritter -- father of John, grandfather of Jason -- and the next night, he'll present Clark Gable movies (\"Mogambo,\" \"Band of Angels\").\n\n\"They are absolutely first-rate, top-of-the-line people,\" Wagner tells Zap2it of the TCM staff. \"They run that organization so well, and they create such a tremendous atmosphere. They're wonderful, and so is Bob [Osborne]. We've been friends for years. We were both under contract to the Fox studio, so I go back a long time with him, and he's just one of the nicest people I've ever known. When they called me about this,...\n\nA classy dame. A dynamite broad. A tough cookie. The language is definitely un-pc…and yet, it seems not only proper but singularly apt when talking about Barbara Stanwyck. It was the language of the day when her star soared off into the ascent, and it would remain so her over the course of a 60-year career on stage, film, and TV, it would be criminal to clean it up for politeness’ sake. It was the kind of language she unabashedly used herself in her later years, describing herself frankly, bluntly, and with characteristic modesty – as was her wont – as “…a tough old broad from Brooklyn.”\n\nAnd, kiddo (as she’d probably say), she was.

Mankiewicz’s All About Eve is, without a doubt, one of the top films in history. The laurels and praise it’s received over the years are too many to list, but here are just a few amazing marks of recognition: It was nominated for a record-smashing 14 Academy Awards, the most ever (tied with Titanic, but Eve beat the boat by 47 years). It won 6 of ‘em, including Best Pic. It was the only film to receive four female acting nominations (Bette Davis and Anne Baxter as Best Actress, Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter as Best Supporting Actress). It was inducted into the National Film Registry the second year of the Registry’s existence, signaling its high priority as one of our nation’s most treasured motion pictures. It was the major inspiration behind Showgirls,..."
