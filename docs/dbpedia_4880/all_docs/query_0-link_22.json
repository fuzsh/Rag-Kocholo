        "text": "This glossary contains a number of recurrent terms found on the present site which may not be clear to all readers, especially when employed within the context of an art historical discussion. Some terms, signaled by an icon of the Vermeer's monogram, are examined as they relate specifically to Vermeer's art. Each of the four sections of the glossary can be accessed from the menu top located on the top of the page.\n\nThe terms in this glossary are cross-linked or externally linked only the first time they appear in the same entry.\n\nRaking Light\n\nRaking light is the illumination of objects from a light source at a strongly oblique angle almost parallel to the object's surface (between 5º and 30º with respect to the examined surface). Under raking light, tool marks, paint handling, canvas weave, surface imperfections and restorations can be visualized better than with light coming from different angles. In some instances raking light may help reveal pentimenti or changes in an artist's intention. In the case of wall paintings, raking light helps show preparatory techniques such as incisions in the plaster support.\n\nThe term \"raking light\" may also be used to describe a strongly angled light represented in illusionist painting, although not strictly between 5º and 30º. Raking light gives volume to objects and accentuates texture. It is best used to create dramatic or moody images.\n\nPainters instinctively avoid the lowest angles of raking light because they divided solid objects into two essentially equal parts: a face would be half in light and half in shadow, which tends to have a flattening effect. Moreover, raking light create cast shadows that run parallel to the picture plane, so they do not suggest spatial recession as well as shadows that are cast backward by light originating from a higher angle. Since it is easier to evaluate an object's form, color and texture when it is illuminated rather than when it is in shadow, a wider angle of light is generally preferable. Often, painters use three-quarters lighting which reveals the great part of an object's surface but creates at the same time a strong sense of volume.\n\nRapen\n\nRapen, which means \"stealing\" or \"borrowing,\" is a Dutch term widely used in the seventeenth century when discussing artistic competition and emulation. Rapen was approved by art Dutch theorists of borrowings provided that they were integrated into painting and might appear unrecognizable. Using a play on words—in Dutch rapen is the plural of raap, or \"turnip\"—the Dutch painter and art writer Arnold Houbraken (1660–1719) recommended that \"stolen\" fragments should be \"welded, molded in the mind as though it were stewed in a pot, and prepared and served with the sauce of ingenuity if it is to prove flavorful.\"\n\nRas schilderen\n\nRas schilderen is the Dutch term for alla prima painting.\n\nReddering\n\nReddering was a critical term which the Dutch art writer Willem Goeree first used in his Inleyding tot de algemeene teyken-konst in 1668, reflecting his knowledge of Leonardo da Vinci's Traitté de la peinture de Léonard da Vinci (Paris, 1651). Reddering indicates the distribution or arrangement of alternating areas of light and dark in the foreground and background in order to intesify the illusion spatial recession, three-dimensionality as well as to unify composition. Goeree and Gérard de Lairesse (1641–1711) agreed that reddering could be found in nature.\n\nRealism\n\nA type of representational art in which the artist depicts as closely as possible what the eye sees. Realism attempts to represent people, objects, or places in a realistic manner as opposed to an idealized way; also, a later nineteenth century art movement in France which objected to the idealized style of Romanticism by creating works that depicted a more faithful view of everyday life.\n\nWithout underestimating the efforts of (Dutch) interior painters to make their works seem realistic, it is important to be aware up to what point we are dealing with modified reality.\n\nMany mid-seventeenth century Dutch genre paintings, including those of Vermeer, depicted elegant interiors of the upper middle-class. These pictures reflect concepts that were important in Dutch culture such as the family, privacy and intimacy. However, it is likely that the world of exquisite refinery of Vermeer's compositions did not accurately portray the world he actually observed.\n\nC. Willemijn Fock, a historian of the decorative arts, has demonstrated that floors paved with marble tiles, one of the most ubiquitous features of Dutch interior paintings, were extremely rare in the Dutch seventeenth-century houses. Only in the houses of the very wealthy were floors of this type were occasionally found, although they were usually confined to smaller spaces such as voorhuis (the entrance or corridor) where they would be most likely to be admired by incoming guests. Fock reasons that the abundant representations of these floors in Dutch genre painting may be explained by the fact that \"artists were attracted by the challenge involved in representing the difficult perspective of receding multicolored marble tiling.\"\n\nVermeer should not be considered a realist painter in the strictest sense of the word. He frequently modified the scale, the shape of objects and even the fall of shadows for compositional or thematic reasons. His scenes, moreover, appear highly staged. One of the most striking examples of this modified reality is a so-called picture-within-a-picture, The Finding of Moses, which appears on the back wall of two of his compositions. In The Astronomer it appears as a small cabinet size picture whereas in the later Lady Writing with her Maid it appears as an enormous, ebony-framed picture. Which one, if either, was true?\n\nRelining/Lining of Paintings\n\nfrom Wikipedia:\n\nThe relining, or lining as it is also called, of a painting is a process of restoration used to strengthen, flatten or consolidate oil or tempera paintings on canvas by attaching a new canvas to the back of the existing one. In cases of extreme decay, the original canvas may be completely removed and replaced. Lining has been very widely practiced, and during the nineteenth century, some painters had their works lined immediately after, or sometimes even before, completion. There have been some doubts concerning its benefits more recently, especially since the Greenwich Comparative Lining Conference of 1974.\n\nThe procedure as carried out in the nineteenth century is described by Theodore Henry Fielding in his Knowledge and Restoration of Old Paintings (1847). The picture was removed from the stretcher and laid on a flat surface. The edges of the canvas were trimmed, leaving the original support smaller than the new lining. A sheet of paper covered in thin paste was laid on the surface of the painting, which was then placed face-down on a board or table. The back of the picture was then coated with paste, copal varnish, or a glue made from cheese. The new lining canvas was pressed down onto the back of the picture by hand; then the outer edges of the lining cloth were fastened to the table by means of a large number of tacks, and a piece of wood with a rounded edge was passed over the back of the cloth, to ensure perfect adhesion. When the glue had dried sufficiently, the lining was smoothed with a moderately hot iron. Fielding cautions that \"the greatest care must be taken that the hand does not stop for an instant, or the mark of the iron will be so impressed on the painting, that nothing can obliterate it.\" The picture was then nailed to a new stretcher, and the paper was washed off with a sponge and cold water.\n\nFielding also describes the process for the complete removal and replacement of the canvas. In this, the picture was covered with paper, as if for lining, then fastened to a board or table, after which the old cloth was rubbed away with a small rasp with very fine teeth; when the restorer had gone \"as far as may be prudent,\" the remainder of the cloth could be taken off with a pumice stone, until the ground on which the picture was painted became visible. It was then ready to receive its new cloth, which had previously been covered with copal varnish, glue, or paste. In this procedure, the hot iron was not used.\n\nThe use of hand-ironing is liable to produce a flattening of impasto. This problem was mitigated by the introduction in the 1950s of vacuum hot-table processes, designed for use with wax-resin adhesives, which exerted a more even pressure on the paint surface; however the longer periods of heating and high temperatures involved often led to other types of textural alteration.\n\nWax-based adhesives seem to have been in use for lining from the eighteenth century, although the earliest well-documented case of their employment is in the lining of Rembrandt's Night Watch in 1851. Although, initially, pure beeswax was used, mixtures incorporating resins such as dammar and mastic, or balsams such as Venice turpentine, were soon found preferable. During the twentieth century, it came to be realized that the impregnation of the paint layer with wax could have deleterious effects, including darkening of the picture, especially where canvas or ground were exposed.\n\nAlthough experiments with synthetic fabrics were carried out during the 1960s and 1970s, traditional linen cloths are still usually used for lining. However polyester canvas is often used for strip-lining, where only the edges of the painting are backed, and for loose-lining, in which no adhesive is used. This latter technique helps protect the painting from atmospheric pollution, but does not flatten or consolidate the paint surface.\n\nAll of Vermeer's canvases, except for The Guitar Player, have been relined, and one, The Lacemaker, mounted on panel. Not only has The Guitar Player never been relined, it is still mounted on its original wood stretcher with wooden pegs, making it an extraordinary rarity among paintings of the age.\n\nRenaissance\n\nA French label given to an Italian cultural movement and to its repercussions elsewhere. For Italy the period is popularly accepted as running from the second generation of the fourteenth century to the second or third generation of the sixteenth century.\n\nCharacteristic of the Renaissance is the steady rise of painting and of the other visual arts that began in Italy with Cimabue (c. 1240–1302), and Giotto (1266–1337) and reached its climax in the sixteenth century. An early expression of the increasing prestige of the visual arts is found on the Campanie of Florence, where painting, sculpture and architecture appear as a separate group between the liberal and the mechanical arts. What characterizes the period is not only the quality of the works of art but also the close links that were established between the visual arts, the sciences and literature.\n\nThe period of the Renaissance brought with it many important changes in the social and cultural position of the artist. Over the course of the period there is a steady rise in the status of the painter, sculptor and architect and a growing sympathy expressed for the visual arts. Painters and sculptors made a concerted effort to extricate themselves from their medieval heritage and to distinguish themselves from mere craftsmen. At the beginning of the Renaissance, painters and sculptors were still regarded as members of the artisan class, and occupied a low rung on the social ladder. A shift begins to occur in the fourteenth century when painting, sculpture and architecture began to form a group separate from the mechanical arts. In the fifteenth century, the training of a painter was expected to include knowledge of mathematical perspective, optics, geometry and anatomy.\n\nAlthough the influence of the Italian Renaissance was felt throughout Europe and in the Netherlands as well, it is interesting to note that none of the great masters of Dutch painting felt the necessity to go to Italy to adsorb its lessons first hand. Jacob van Ruisdael (c. 1629–1682), Frans Hals (c. 1582–1666), Vermeer and Rembrandt (1606–1669) all stayed in the Holland, close to their own culture.\n\nRender\n\nRendering in visual art and technical drawing means the process of formulating, adding color, shading and texturing of an image. It can also be used to describe the quality of execution of that process. When used as a means of expression, it is synonymous with illustrating. The alternative method to rendering an image is capturing an image such as photography or image scanning. Both rendered and captured images can be mixed, edited, or both.\n\nRepoussoir\n\nFrom the French verb meaning to \"push back.\" Repoussoir is one of the pictorial means of achieving perspective or spatial contrasts by the use of illusionistic devices such as the placement of a large figure or object in the immediate foreground of a painting to increase the illusion of depth in the rest of the picture. Caravaggio (1571–1610) had become famous for his paintings of ordinary people or even religious subjects in compositions. Repoussoir figures appear frequently in Dutch figure painting where they function as a major force in establishing the spatial depth that is characteristic of painting of the seventeenth century. Landscapists too learned to exploit the dramatic effect of repoussoir to enliven their depictions of the flat uneventful Dutch countryside. Repoussoir formulae is still used in landscape painting and is influential in photography as well.\n\nVermeer adapted various examples of repoussoir to his own compositions that he had derived from other Dutch paintings. The looming figure of the officer in The Officer and Laughing Girl is very similar in color and shape to the repoussoir figure in The Procuress by Gerrit Van Honthorst (1592–1656).\n\nThe most spectacular example of repoussoir in Vermeer's oeuvre may be found in The Art of Painting. The large foreground curtain on the left-hand side of the painting seems to have been just drawn back to let the viewer enter the pictorial space. Both the curtain's warm tone and the heavy impasto paint application makes it appear even nearer to the viewer.\n\nThis kind of repoussoir was generally placed on the left-hand side of the composition because we tend to rapidly scan images darting from the left to the right as when reading. By consequence, Vermeer's repoussoir is suited to be looked at by the reading eye, which, after a brief moment's delay at the repoussoir, is directed toward the key moment of the representation of the painter and his model and explores the rest of the painting thereafter.\n\nReserve\n\nA reserve is a temporarily unfinished or blank area of a painting which is surrounded by painted areas that re either partially or fully completed. A reserve generally corresponds to the area within the outer-most contour of a single object such as a figure, a tree or an architectural feature. Once painters of the Renaissance and Baroque had established the composition through a thin outline drawing on a monochrome ground, it was then underpainted with a dull monochrome tint. Successively, each area of the composition was worked up in a piecemeal fashion with full color, creating reserves of unpainted objects.\n\nPeriod art manuals recommended that the background areas, usually the least important from a thematic point of view, be painted first, leaving reserves for the important foreground elements. This sequential system would allow to the painter to softly blend the outer contours of the foreground figures into the colors of the background, slightly overlapping them and creating a more convincing sensation of roundness. However, this system was not applied dogmatically and one can find examples of unfinished paintings which show the figures worked up in color with the background left relatively unfinished. Portrait painters routinely completed the face before working up the background or the figure's body.\n\nResin\n\nA resin is a solid or highly viscous substance of plant or synthetic origin. Many plants, particularly woody plants, produce resin in response to injury. Resin acts as a bandage protecting the plant from invading insects and pathogens. Plant resins are valued for the production of varnishes, adhesives and food glazing and paint mediums. The hard transparent resins, such as the copals, dammars, mastic and sandarac, are principally used for varnishes and adhesives, while the softer odoriferous oleo-resins (frankincense, elemi, turpentine, copaiba), and gum resins are more used for therapeutic purposes and incense.\n\nResins are used to increase the gloss of oil paint, reduce the color and drying time of a medium, and add body to drying oils. The most commonly used is a natural resin known as Dammar, which should be mixed with turpentine as it will not thoroughly dissolve when mixed with mineral spirits. Dammar can also be used as a varnish. Exudations from conifer resins used in painting are Strasbourg turpentine, Venice turpentine, sandarac and various kinds of copals.\n\nRetouching\n\nRetouching describes the work done by a restorer to replace areas of loss or damage in a painting. Retouchings are done in a soluble medium that differs from the original so that they can be removed easily. Retouching is usually intended to be invisible to the naked eye, but there may be reasons for it to be distinguishable when the painting is viewed at close range.\n\nOver the period of 250 years after Vermeer's paintings left the artist's studio, a number have been retouched, some only to repair paint damage or fading, while at least one, features a compositional addition that does not reflect the artist's original intentions. On the background wall of Girl Interrupted in her Music a small birdcage, a common prop in Dutch interior painting, was added by a later hand. A violin once hung on the background of same picture, most likely itself another later addition.\n\nRough & Smooth Styles\n\nYears before Frans Hals (c. 1582–1666) developed his characteristic free handling of paint, Gerrit Dou (1613–1675) specialized incredibly meticulous brushwork, Dutch artists and art lovers already distinguished between two main painting styles: ruwe or rauw, (\"rough\") and nette, fijn, or gladde (\"clean,\" \"fine\" or \"smooth\"). The rough style was also associated with the loss'e style (\"loose\").\n\nDou, Rembrandt's first pupil, developed, or rather, brought the fine style to full fruition in the 1630s. Smooth painters went to incredible lengths to achieve the perfect, polished illusion of reality. The time Dou spent on his minutely detailed works is legendary: according to some of his contemporaries it took him days to paint a tiny broom the size of a fingernail. It is said that by sitting down quietly in his studio an hour before he began to paint, Dou was able to defeat one of the mortal natural enemies of the smooth style; dust.\n\nFine painting, which gave rise to the modern term fijnschilder (Dutch: fine painter) was a practiced in Leiden. In their own time, however, a fijnschilder, or \"fine painter,\" was simply someone who could make a living through art and was distinguished from a kladscilder (\"house painter\"), both of whom were enrolled in the Saint Luke Guild. Today, art historians adopt the term fijnschilder to define a group of painters who worked in Leiden: Gerrit Dou, Gabriel Metsu (1629–1667), Pieter Cornelisz. van Slingelandt (1640–1691), Frans van Mieris (1635–1681) and Adriaen van der Werff (1659–722). However, the school only came into its own after Gabriel Metsu's (1629–1667), one of the best practitioners of the smooth style, had moved. It is most likely that fijnschilders worked at least partially naer het leven (from life).\n\nIn 1604, Karel van Mander (1548–1606), the Dutch painter and art theoretician who first codified the rough and smooth manners, advised artists always to start by learning the smooth manner, which was considered easier, and only subsequently choose between smooth and rough painting. A later Dutch art theoretician, Gérard de Lairesse (1641–1711) wrote:\n\n…he who practices the former [smooth] manner, has this advantage above the other, that being accustomed to neatness, he can easily execute the bold and light manner, it being the other way difficult to bring the hand to neat painting; the reason of which is, that, not being used to consider and imitate the details of small objects, he must therefore be a stranger to it; besides, it is more easy to leave out some things which we are masters of than to add others which we have not studied, and therefore it must be the artist's care to learn to finish his work as much as possible.\n\n\"The smooth manner of painting had been associated with descriptive tasks, for example flower painting or animal painting, well before the successes of the Leiden school, and in many parts of Europe. But the Dutch had made a specialty of it. Karl van Mander… linked the modern smooth manner of the legendary mysteries of Jan van Eyck's (before c. 1390–1441) technique. Even Van Eyck's underpainting was 'cleaner and sharper' [suyverder en scherper] than the finished work of other painters.'\"Christopher S. Wood, \"'Curious Pictures' and the art of description,\" Word & Image 11, no. 4 (1995): 332.\n\nThe question remains whether the smooth manner is truly more suited to evoke the illusion of reality than the rough manner is difficult to answer. While it is true that the smooth manner captures texture, form and detail with incredible efficacy, the rough manner, practiced by great artists like Diego Velázquez (1599–1660), Rembrandt (1606–1669) or Titian (c. 1488/1490–1576), is capable of evoking a sense of lifelikeness and naturalness that makes even the reality represented in the best smooth painting look frozen and artificial. To best appreciate the two styles, it was recommended that art lovers adjust their viewing distance: farther away for a roughly painted work, close up for a finely executed one.\n\nIt is believed that the rough manner stimulates the activity of the eye far more powerfully than painting with a smooth surface. The unequivocally completed, clear and polished work of art tends to exclude the spectator from participating in the picture. The roughly finished painting demands an intellectual response from the beholder because the painter of the rough manner deliberately exposes the working processes to the spectator making him party to the artifice by which the illusion is achieved. The smooth painter, instead, deliberately conceals his manner and isolates the viewer from the picture making process, which may, is some subjects give rise to a sensation of deception. The rough painter, instead, hides nothing, and is registered as more sincere, or at least to modern sensibilities.\n\nBoth of these great artists \"were working against the prevailing norms of smooth or fine painting, and, for both, the example of late Titian was cited as authorization of their increasingly broken and irregular handling of paint. In a remarkable trajectory that echoed Titian's, Rembrandt moved through his career from being a founding father of the Leiden fijnschilders...—those painters who, with invisible brushstrokes and 'the patience of saints and the industry of ants' (as one contemporary author described it), took the illusionistic depiction of objects to a new level—to his culmination as the undisputed extreme exponent of the rough manner. In his late works, the paint surfaces have the density of rock faces. It is thought that Rembrandt's rough manner may have been a factor contributing to his personal financial troubles in later life.\n\n\"The rough manner in Dutch painting was a conscious aesthetic choice and was described in Rembrandt's day as lossigheydt, 'looseness'—the equivalent of the sprezzatura of the Italian writer Baldesar Castiglione (1478–1529), who drew parallels between the effortless nonchalance of courtly behavior and the loose, seemingly careless touches that the artist applied with his brush. The epitome of lossigheydt or sprezzatura in Rembrandt's art is his masterpiece, the Portrait of Jan Six , in which the paint seems to have massed spontaneously into the gorgeous fabric of the sitter's clothes and the powerful passages of his face and hands. Seventeenth-century Spanish art theory, similarly, had terminology for loose, expressive brushstrokes: they were referred to as borrones or manchas, words loaded with the same significance as 'sprezzatura.'\"David Bomford, \"Rough Manners: Reflections on Courbet and Seventeenth-Century Painting,\" in papers from the Symposium Looking at the Landscapes: Courbet and Modernism, J. Paul Getty Museum, March 18, 2006, 10, https://www.getty.edu/publications/resources/virtuallibrary/0892369272.pdf.\n\n\"Seventeenth-century painters and art lovers had terms to describe the notable changes in painterly technique and compositional method that accompanied the 'gentrification' of Vermeer's work in the 1660s. Whereas the relatively grainy texture of bread, carpets and bricks in the early words would have been seen as rouw or rough, the even, polished facture of the Girl with a Wine Glass or Woman Holding a Balance was explicitly net, neat or smooth. By his increasing commitment to the smooth style, Vermeer essentially sided with the manner that was gaining market and connoisseur favor after mid-century. However different his paintings look from the miniaturist neatness of Dou, Frans van Mieris (1635–1681), and Gerrit ter Borch (1617–1681), they, too, must have been admired especially in the decade that saw a lesser interest in the rough painting associated with Rembrandt and his students and followers. The smooth manner typically went along with more genteel and elegant themes. The rough brothel scenes of the 1620s and 1630s, so often painted with Caravaggesque uncouthness, now became sublimated in more slyly humorous paintings in the neat style.\"MariÃ«t Westermann, \"Vermeer and the Interior Imagination,\" in Vermeer and the Dutch Interior, ed. Alejandro Vergara (Madrid: Museo Nacional de Prado, 2003), 231.\n\nRounding/Relief\n\nRounding is the creation of relief of solid, opaque and convex objects. Rounding was one of the cardinal concerns of renaissance and baroque easel painting. Rounding was not only achieved by the use of light and shade, or more crudely in former times, by shading, but by the proper management of contour. Paramount was to make the edges of objects appear to gradually wrap around to their backside rather than terminate abruptly. Painters were advised to soften their contours of solid objects so they might subtly \"melt\" into the background, avoid placing the highest light outer edges of the illuminated sides of objects and to avoid outlining the outer edges with sharp black lines. Many painters introduced lines aound objects to accentuate certain of their qualities but they were generally variable in application, colored and never too hard.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) was the first to codify the depiction of edges writing \"the true outlines of opaque objects are never seen with great precision.\" Another method for producing rounding was to introduce light (i.e., a reflection) along the inner edges of an object's outermost shadowed edge. If the large mass shadow of an objects is dark along its edges as it is the innermost parts, the mass shadow will appear flat.\n\nSatin\n\nPainting satin is a challenging task even for the most talented and experienced painter. It requires not only exacting manipulative skill and a thorough knowledge of the artist's materials, but a comprehension of its peculiar optical and physical properties. Unlike common fabrics, satin does not absorb and diffuse light rays in a more or less predictable manner, because more like a mirror it reflects the great part of the light which strikes its surface. The difficulty of painting satin was vastly exacerbated when rendering the restless patterns of light and dark created by the elaborate cut of contemporary fashion, which behave more like pieces fractured glass rather than a flat mirror.\n\nIt is not known exactly how satin was painted, although the relatively uniform success of its rendering among a significant number of Dutch painters suggests that there must have existed a common procedure. A few Dutch interior paintings with satin garments seem to indicate that the highlights were worked up with wet paint over a dark brown underpainting (see the barely finished background figure of Two Men playing Tric-trac, with a Woman by William Duyster (1599–1635) or over a barely modeled layer of dark paint tinted roughly with the color of the garment, with the untouched base tone functioning as the garment's deepest shadows (see the ochre gown of the left-hand figure of The Card Party (c. 1665) by Caspar Netscher (1639–1684). When the light-colored paint of the highlight is feathered into the surround dark to represents the gradual falloff of light this technique automatically produces the cool, shimmering halftones (via the turbid medium effect this) typical of satin. The lighter shadows and their inner reflections would have been successively rendered with medium tones of paint, somewhere in between the deepest shadows and the highlights. Strongly colored satin was probably worked up in monochrome or lightly colored shades of paint and then glazed with more richly colored paint producing an attractive gem-like quality.\n\nIn general, the maximum lights of light-colored satin must be rendered with very light tones of thick paint while the darks must be rendered translucently with somewhat lighter tones than those used for similarly colored but non-reflective fabrics. The deepest shadows are full of complicated reflections, especially when the fabric is tightly bunched. These reflections sometimes take on shades of the color of nearby objects. The half-tones of satin—half-tones are those crucial transitional tones that lie between the illuminated and shadowed sides of opaque, illuminated objects—must be drastically minimized; otherwise the fabric will not glimmer. The depiction of satin is further complicated by the fact that its stiffness makes folds break at more or less sharp angles instead of bending predictably like more pliable fabrics. These angular folds of satin were much appreciated by Vermeer (see The Concert) in his years of maturity and were exaggerated to almost exasperated level in the gowns of the late Love Letter and The Guitar Player. Owing to its capricious behavior, the slightest wrinkles and creases on its surface sends off glitters of light that, if rendered convincingly, charm even the most jaded art-goer, making the painter appear more like a sorcerer than a craftsman. Given the difficulties of representing the unique actions of satin, art historians have assumed that garments made with this fabric were depicted from life.\n\nThe satin gowns of Vermeer's mature works are immediately distinguishable from those of his contemporaries for their crisp, angular folds that convey strength and structure, while theirs abound with rhythmically swerving curves and finicky detail. The gown of A Lady Standing at a Virginal appears as a perfect luminous bell while in The Love Letter it is transformed into a cube-like box with flaring sides. In the latter picture the long, unbroken fold that plunges from the figure's left-hand knee to the floor appears wonderfully, but perhaps impossibly, straight.\n\nThe \"in-your-face\" silver gown of The Guitar Player is one of the most criticized and praised motifs—at least by painters—in the artist's oeuvre. Its folds and creases are not inventoried literally but imaginatively reconstituted into abstract shapes of differently toned patches gray paint. Surprisingly, although pattern is largely victorious over chiaroscural modeling, neither the feel of the fabric nor the underlying anatomical forms which determine the its outer appearance are lost. To the left, an oval-shaped plane of light gray, from which spider-like tendrils spread out in all directions, clearly informs us of the musician's propped up knee. To the right, a large, flat shape of light gray adjacent to the strip of fur trim signals the location of the knee of the extended leg.\n\nSaturation\n\nSaturation refers to the purity of color and measures the amount of gray in a particular color. A color with more gray is considered less saturated, while a bright color, one with very little gray in it, is considered highly saturated. The amount of saturation does not affect the basic hue of a color but it does alter the color's intensity. Saturated colors are considered bolder and tied to emotions, while unsaturated ones are softer and less striking. Vermeer carefully balanced a few areas of strongly saturated colors with larger areas of soft grays and browns.\n\nScale\n\nRelative size, proportion; the determination of measurements of dimensions within a design or artwork.\n\nSchema/Schemata\n\nSee, pictorial convention.\n\nSchilderachtig\n\nIn 1604, the term schilderachtig, which corresponds approximately to \"painterly\" or \"picture worthy,\" was used first in the Schilder-boeck by Karel van Mander (1548–1606). However, schilderachtig refers to two separate qualities: on one hand the image that best demonstrates an artist's painterly ability and at the other hand to describe those subjects fit for an artist, allowing for free imagination and invention. Schilderachtig implied values close to the Dutch such as rustic simplicity, naturalness and a love for the unadorned. The idyllic world of the past as well as curious unusual or even ugly had become worthy of the painter's attention. Rembrandt (1606–1669) could find an audience for the old run-down farm houses outside of Amsterdam and Vermeer an old house along a secluded Delft canal. However, \"whether or not the painterly was used to describe an artist's activities or his pictures, it was always used as a concept in connection with the artistic ambition to take one's point of departure in reality, or at least portray the motif as it could appear in nature. 'I have followed the schilderachtig saying (a saying common among painters) that 'the best painters are those who get closest to reality' wrote the painter and poet Gerbrand Bredero (1585–1618) wrote in 1618.\"David Burmeister Kaaring, \"Reality as IconâThe cottage motif in Dutch landscape painting 1600â1650,\" SMK Art Journal (2007): 99. After the middle of the seventeenth century the term shifted in meaning and was used to denote painting of buildings, cottages and people marked by aging and weathering, subjects that did not fit in well with the tenets of the upcoming classicist painting.\n\nAround the end of the seventeenth century, the painter and art theorist Gérard de Lairesse (1641–1711) made a passionate plea that art lovers stop applying this word to pictures of old people with very wrinkled faces or dilapidated and overgrown cottages, and reserve it for well-proportioned young people and idealized landscapes.\n\nSchool (of painting)\n\nIn reference to painting the word \"school\" is used with various meanings. In its widest sense a school may include the painters of a single country, regardless of date such as \"the Dutch School.\" In its narrowest sense, it denotes a group of painters who worked under the influence of a single artist as in, the \"School of Raphael.\" In a third sense, it applies to the painters of one city or province who worked under some common 'local influence, and with some general similarity of design, color, or technique, such as the \"Florentine School.\"\n\nPainters of a specific geographical area were once bound together more closely than in modern times. In order to sign and sell their works, they were required to belong to the Guild of Saint Luke, the corporation of artists and artisans which regulated the local art commerce and assisted painters in illness and old age. Each guild had a clearly defined set of rules, traditions and a system of apprenticeship that compelled young painters to work for a term of four to six years with a recognized guild master. Thus, an important master might stamp his manner of working on a large number of pupils, some of whom would be more than willing to acquiesce to the tastes of local collectors who had guaranteed their master's prosperity.\n\nThe \"School of Delft,\" or the \"Delft School,\" belongs to the third type of school, although its \"members\" would probably not have been aware that they belonged to any school at all. They were, however, bound by their obligatory guild membership and could not have avoided contact with each other is such a small town as Delft. For further information on the School of Delft, click here.\n\nSchuilkerken\n\nAlthough the founding father of the United Provinces, William the Silent, had championed religious and cultural tolerance, in practice, Calvinists were openly hostile towards people of different faith and attitude. Only foreigners, like Jews emigrated from other countries, were able to practice their religion freely, without significant restrictions. But Catholics, Remonstrants and Mennonites were explicitly forbidden to practice their faith in the public. They were violently deprived of their churches, cloisters, grounds and were forced to take refuge within domestic walls, warehouses, cellars, attics and even barns. These environments were then rebuilt and decorated for the purposes of celebrating the Holy Masses and holding other religious meetings evolving into so-called schuilkerken (hidden churches). In the rural areas they were called schuilkerken (Dutch schuur = barn) since barns were frequently used for the purpose. Initially, Calvinistic authorities reacted harshly against these hidden churches. In Zwolle, for instance, Catholic families were forbidden to live in houses side by side in order to impede them from tearing down the walls to create a room large enough for a church.\n\nBut in the course of the time, the schuilkerken gradually became tolerated by officials. However, it was strictly prohibited that their entrances could be accessed directly from the street and no sign (crucifixes or other Christian symbols) could be placed above the entrances. Even bell towers were banned because they could have pointed to the existence of a building of religious use other than the Reformed one. Bell-ringing was completely forbidden. Furthermore, no congregational singing was permitted to be heard from outside. Nevertheless, hidden churches quickly spread all over the country, particularly in the protestant Seven United Provinces.\n\nThe Jesuits, who had established their first Dutch mission in 1592, moved to a permanent location in Delft in 1612. In 1650, Catholic inhabitants of Delft had the \"choice\" between three schuilkerken: two (dated from 1630–1650) in the Bagijnhof at the Oude Delft canal, dedicated to Saint Hippolytus and Saint Ursula and attended by secular priests, and the third one, established 1617 in an old warehouse at Oude Langendijk, dedicated to Saint Josef and supervised by the Jesuits.\n\nScumble/Scumbling\n\nIn a certain sense, scumbling is the opposite of glazing. The term scumbling refers to the use of opaque paint thinly applied over a dried layer of different colored paint. Glazes are also applied thinly but only inherently transparent pigments are employed for the purpose. Another difference between the two techniques is that glazes are applied over lighter-toned paint layers while scumbles are generally applied over darker ones. The difference produces two completely different optical effects. Scumbles produce pearly opalescence or a soft smoky effect while glazing creates a deep jewel-like one. Scumbles tend to appear cooler (bluer) in hue, especially when applied over warm dark browns of the underpainting. Scumbles seem to advance towards the surface of the canvas while glazes create depth. By manipulating the optical effects of these two valuable techniques in tandem, the painter may enhance depth and atmosphere of his work.\n\nScumbling can also be used to create smooth transitions from light to dark or to subtly alter the tone or hue of the underlying paint layer. In order to scumble, the artist first picks up a bit of paint with his brush and then wipes away surplus paint with a cloth. In a sense, the paint is then \"scrubbed\" or \"rubbed\" over an underlying dry paint layer. Little or no medium is required since it would make the paint flow. If applied lightly, scumbles remain attached to the highest relief of the paint surface but if they are rubbed with vigor they will penetrate into the interstices of the canvas grain. Fingertips and the ball of the hand are very good tools for fine scumbling.\n\nIt is sometimes said that Titian (c. 1488/1490–1576) discovered that a light, opaque tone could be rendered semitransparent by the addition of a bit more oil and/or simply by scrubbing it on thinly with a stiff brush. A scumble over a flesh tone would produce an analogous effect as powder on a woman's face; that is, it makes its texture appear softer. This is a useful device when painting women and young people of both sexes. Scumbling may be used to modify the color of a given area after that area is dry. Such an application tends to soften transitions of tone from the previous sitting that were done too harshly. If used properly, it confers a higher degree of refinement to the image.\n\nSeascape\n\nHolland is more intimately linked to the sea that any other nation on the earth. It is not surprising, therefore, that a number of Dutch artists devoted their careers to seascapes. \"The sea was significant in a variety of ways to the Dutch. They were constantly warring with it in the struggle to increase and retain their land. On the other hand, the sea was the source of their wealth and their economic stability. The United Provinces was a great maritime trading nation; this was the backbone of its economy. The Dutch relied on the sea for a crucial part of their food supply. The herring, so often represented in still life paintings, was indeed a national treasure. Salted, it remained edible and provided sustenance during the long sea voyages that promoted Dutch prosperity, and it also enriched the economy as a major item for export. The sea was also the scene of their military successes. Dutch national heroes were admirals rather than generals; the great tomb sculptures in Dutch churches are tombs of admirals. Paintings of seascapes reflected the specific maritime interests of the Dutch people, and there seems to have been a large market for them in the seventeenth century.\n\n\"A number of Dutch artists whose work consisted mainly of other kinds of subjects painted seascapes as well. Jan van Goyen (1596–1656), for example, painted numerous coastal scenes and purely marine subjects. Jacob van Ruisdael (c. 1629–1682) and Aelbert Jacobsz Cuyp 1620–1691) also painted seascapes. Some artists, however, specialized in seascapes. Most marine painters were experts on ships.\"Madlyn Millner Kahr, Dutch Painting in the Seventeenth-Century (New York: Routledge, 1978), 232â133.\n\nVermeer is not know to have ever painted a seascape. However, the maps which hang on the background walls of his compositions often remind the viewer of the fundamental role that the sea played in the lives of many Dutchmen. In the late Love Letter, an ebony framed seascape hangs directly behind the maid and mistress who has presumably just received a letter from her loved one. This picture-with-a-picture mostly likely was intended to clarify the meaning of the composition as it refers to the loved one of mistress' who is not present. Ships at stormy seas often were connected to the idea of uncontrollable the passions of the lover's heart. But the seascape in Vermeer's composition seems to be relatively calm. In Dutch emblematic traditions a calm sea represents a good omen for love.\n\nSelf Portrait\n\nSelf Portrait\n\nJean Fouquet\n\n1452–1455\n\nGold cameo and black email on copper\n\nLouvre, Paris\n\nA self-portrait is a representation of an artist, drawn, painted, photographed, or sculpted by the artist. Although self portraits have been made by artists since the earliest times, it is not until the Early Renaissance in the mid-fifteenth century that artists can be frequently identified depicting themselves as either the main subject, or as important characters in their work. With better and cheaper mirrors, and the advent of the panel portrait, many painters, sculptors and printmakers tried some form of self-portraiture.\n\n\"Jean Fouquet's self portrait (c. 1450), a small picture created in gold on black enamel, is seen as the earliest clearly identified self portrait that is a separate painting, not an incidental part of a larger work. However, self-portraits are known to go back as far as the Amarna Period (c. 1365 B.C.) of Ancient Egypt. Pharaoh Akhenaten's chief sculptor Bak carved a portrait of himself and his wife Taheri out of stone. This is significant because Bak and Taheri were not like the rich and powerful who could afford the privilege of a portrait therefore the artist must have had another reason for creating this work of art. Sean Kelly points out in his book The Self-Portrait, A Modern View, while we know a number of self-portraits from the ancient world, we also know very little about the psychological motivations which inspired them.\n\n\"Though Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) is credited for being the first artist to consistently create self-portraits, Rembrandt (1606–1669) is given credit for being the first artist to intensely study of the self through art.\"\"Self-Portraits as a Self-Study,\" http://www.research.umbc.edu/~ivy/selfportrait/study.html.\n\nIt wasn't until the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when scholars studied Rembrandt's oeuvre as a whole, that it was discovered how very many times the artist had portrayed himself. The number is still a matter of contention, but it seems he depicted himself in approximately forty to fifty extant paintings, about thirty-two etchings, and seven drawings. It is an output unique in history; most artists produce only a handful of self portraits, if that. And why Rembrandt did this is one of the great mysteries of art history.\n\nMost scholars up till about twenty years ago interpreted Rembrandt's remarkable series of self portraits as a sort of visual diary, a forty-year exercise in self-examination. In a 1961 book, art historian Manuel Gasser wrote, \"Over the years, Rembrandt's self portraits increasingly became a means for gaining self-knowledge, and in the end took the form of an interior dialogue: a lonely old man communicating with himself while he painted.\n\nArt historian Ernst van de Wetering sets forth a view that has gained a number of adherents over the past few decades. The \"self portraits\" (there was no such term in the seventeenth century) could not have been made for the purpose of self-analysis, he claims, because the idea of self as \"an independent I who lives and creates solely from within\" is one that arose only in the Romantic era, after 1800. In the literature of Rembrandt's day, he contends, personality was seen primarily as being bound to certain immutable types discussed in classical sources. Van de Wetering basically sees that Rembrandt's \"programme\" in these self portraits was to make paintings for which there was a ready market. He points out that a detailed inventory of Rembrandt's possessions made in 1656, when he faced bankruptcy, included no portrayals of the artist by himself.) In self portraits, artists in Rembrandt's day and previous eras sometimes included a painting in the genre for which they were best known, as an example of their style. In the case of Rembrandt, he was most noted for his eccentricity of technique and for his tronien and depictions of one or a few figures. So, in making his self-portraits, which Van de Wetering contends were probably all seen as tronien in their day, Rembrandt was making the kind of images art buyers expected of him, which had the added attraction of being depictions of their maker and exemplars of his unusual technique.\n\nfrom:\n\nSusan Fegley Osmond, \"Rembrandt's Self-Portraits,\" THE ARTS, January, 2000.\n\nAccording to a succinct description in an auction catalogue of 1696 (the Dissius estate sale in Amsterdam) which featured twenty-one Vermeer paintings, the artist had at one time or another depicted a \"portrait of Vermeer in a room with various accessories uncommonly beautifully painted by him.\" Unfortunately, this \"uncommonly beautiful\" work is currently missing or has not survived. But over the years various works have been candidated as Vermeer self portraits including The Art of Painting even though the artist who is depicted at work in this masterpiece has turned his back to the viewer.\n\nWhile the Dissius self-portrait has disappeared, the pose, the glance, the fancy costume and the lateral position of the figure on the left of the composition of Vermeer's The Procuress (1656) all suggest it a self-portrait by Vermeer. This grinning figure, who clutches a cittern in his right hand and seemingly cheers to both the viewer and his companions with a glass of beer, is a typical Caravaggesque merry drinker popular pictured frequently brothel scenes of the Utrecht Caravaggists. The semi-comical figure serves as a kind of third-person \"fictional narrator,\" within yet partially extraneous to the scene which unfolds. He wears a fanciful black doublet with broad slashes on the sleeves and so-called shoulder-wings. A similar figure appears out a work by Gerrit Dou (1613–1675). At the time of The Procuress was painted the painter was nearly twenty-four.\n\nSfumato\n\nA technique, theorized and developed by Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), in which the transitions from light to dark are so gradual they are almost imperceptible; sfumato softens lines and creates a very natural soft-focus effect. This slight blurring of contours was associated with the realization that air has a mellowing effect comparable of smoke or vapor. \"Fumo\" in Italian means smoke. Leonardo advised that \"the painter, depicting figures and objects distant from the eyes, should put in only blots, not detailed but with distinct outlines.\"\n\nVermeer, in his individual way of rendering sfumato, let areas of paint slightly overlap at the transition areas along contours in order to create a special luminous effect around his pictorial motifs. The result of this technique can be seen, for example, around the skirt of The Milkmaid and the Young Woman with a Water Pitcher, but also between the floor tiles in The Music Lesson.\n\nAnother extraordinary use of sfumato in Vermeer's oeuvre can be seen in the late Guitar Player. The strings of the guitar are blurred and appear that they had been just plucked. Curiously, the Spanish master Diego Velázquez (1599–1660), with whom Vermeer's painting have been compared even thought there are no historically proven ties between the two masters, also experimented with blurred contours to convey the sense of movement in the spinning wheel of the Las Hilanderas (The Spinners) c. 1657.\n\nShading\n\nShading, which aims at creating a sense of volume of solid objects through the manipulation of gradients rather than registering of the effects of natural light, generally issues from the contour and gives way gradually to lighter values toward the center. Shading can be achieved even by non-painters while the creation of a convincing feel of natural light and shadow requires training. Since shading is in not accordance with the rules of illumination, an object shaded by gradients alone implies no fixed source of light. Creating form with shading can be done without actually seeing an object so it is essentially a conceptual exercise, and it is immediately distinguishable with respect to true chiaroscural modeling.\n\nShadow(s)\n\nIn painting, there are two kinds of shadows that occur when light shines upon an object, cast shadows and a form, or attached shadows.\n\nCast Shadows\n\nIn the simplest terms, a cast shadow is a shadow that is projected on a form nearby by an object which occludes the light which emanate from the principal light source (multiple cast shadows are caused by multiple light sources, usually avoided in painting). Each object which blocks light has a cast shadow associated with it. The shape of the cast shadow, which appears to be separated from the object which casts the shadow, is determined not only by shape and dimensions of the object that blocks the light, but by the surface form on which the cast shadow falls as well as the direction, origin and intensity of the light—and, crucial for the painter, the point from which the shadows are observed. An example of a cast shadow is a shadow of a tree that falls on the ground below, or the shadow cast upon the tabletop from an apple sitting on it. The farther a cast shadow is from the object the lighter and softer are its edges. A general rule for painters is that cast shadows are darker than any part of an objects attached shadow.\n\n\"Attached shadow (chiaroscuro) is not universally used in depiction, but even where it is mastered skillfully, it is not generally accompanied by the use, let alone the mastery, of cast shadows—as shadows are rare until the European Renaissance. After the Renaissance, shadows in European painting were canonized and shadow painting was the subject matter of a number of painting treatises. During a circumscribed period in history, the depiction of cast shadows has been the object of a representational struggle. Painters of the early Renaissance appear to have been fascinated by shadows, and to have learnt over about one century how to depict them in a geometrically and perceptually adequate or satisfactory way.\" Roberto Casati, \"Methodological Issues in the Study of the Depiction of Cast Shadows: A Case Study in the Relationships between Art and Cognition,\" The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 62, no. 2 (2004): 165.\n\nAttached Shadows\n\nAn attached shadow is an area of an object which does not receive light directly from the light source but is not blocked (cast) by another object. In real life situations, attached shadows are less defined that than a cast shadow and are more difficult to paint.\n\nIt is not enough to darken the local color(s) of the object with black or brown paint as amateur painters usually do. When painting attached shadows, the painter must take into consideration many variables: the intensity of the light, the overall chiaroscural scheme, the color and texture of the object whose shadow it belongs to. And, shadows are generally much more true to nature if they are painted thinly.\n\nThe adequate depiction of cast and attached shadows is essential for creating the illusion of volume, mass and depth. Without shadows, objects have no substance do not seem real. Understanding the subtle variations of attached and cast shadows requires careful observation: squinting at the subject to see tends to simplify the relationships between lit and unlit areas of the scene and make figure-ground making value relationships clearer. In the eighteenth century, the so-called Claude glass was considered an indispensable tool for an amateur landscape artist. Named for French seventeenth-century painter Claude Lorrain (1600–1682), the Claude glass is a black mirror, slightly convex, that serves to concentrate and frame scenery, as well as simplifying the color and tonal range. This created an image with the qualities of a painting by Claude and made drawing scenery much simpler.\n\nPainters typically represent less detail in the shadowed areas rather than the illuminated areas. Detail in shadow subtract from sensation of natural light and the painting surface overworked. By rendering shadows flat and relatively devoid of detail, the painter enhances through his medium the unsubstantial nature of the shadow itself.\n\nSeventeenth-century artist were keenly aware of the proper rendering of shadows. The painter and art theoretician Samuel van Hoogstraten (1627–1678) , warned against overworking shadows lest they become hard:\n\nBut whether you begin or end with the shadows, you should split them up in your mind into lesser and greater, and depict each in a flat manner, according to its darkness; for by working them too much, and melting them in, all your work would turn to copper; and you would even lose the capacity to judge it. Don't allow yourself to be bothered by small modulations [kantigheden] in a soft shadow, nor by the fact that, when viewed from close by, a darker one can be seen in the middle of it; because the force will be all the greater if you hold it at arm's length…\n\nFrom inspecting his theory and his practice, it would seem that what Van Hoogstraten wanted was a drawing built out of crisp contrasts, in which light and shade were clearly articulated, both between and within themselves.Paul Taylor, \"Flatness in Dutch Art: Theory and Practice,\" Oud Holland Jaargang 121, no. 2/3 (2008): 161.\n\nVermeer himself greatly minimized detail of his shadows, especially the mass shadows. For example, the mass shadow of the blue attire of the blue morning jacket of the Woman in Blue Reading a Letter is rendered almost entirely with a single tone of unmodulated dark blue (natural ultramarine). This pictorial strategy not only enhances the sensation of natural light but simplifies the planimetric composition of the painting into large masses of dark and light which can be more comfortably assimilated by the observer. However, the drastic simplification of Vermeer's shadows may not only owe to Dutch practice recommenced by Van Hoogstraten but to the peculiar image produced by the camera obscura (known to have been employed by Vermeer) which, in situations of all but exceptionally strong illumination, does not evidence tonal variations in shadowed areas of objects.\n\nShape\n\nA shape of an object or its external boundary, outline, or external surface, as opposed to other properties such as color, texture or material composition. Some simple shapes can be put into broad categories. For instance, polygons are classified according to their number of edges as triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, etc. Each of these is divided into smaller categories; triangles can be equilateral, isosceles, obtuse, acute, scalene, etc. while quadrilaterals can be rectangles, rhombi, trapezoids, squares, etc. In the visual arts Shape is a flat, enclosed area of an artwork created through lines, textures, colors or an area enclosed by other shapes such as triangles, circles and squares. Likewise, a form can refer to a three-dimensional composition or object within a three-dimensional composition. Shapes are limited to two dimensions: length and width.\n\nGeometric shapes are precise edged and mathematically consistent curves, they are pure forms and so consist of circles, squares, spirals, triangles, while geometric forms are simple volumes, such as cubes, cylinders and pyramids. They generally dominate architecture, technology, industry and crystalline structures.\n\nIn contrast, organic shapes are free-form, unpredictable and flowing in appearance. These shapes, as well as organic forms, visually suggest the natural world of animals, plants, sky, sea, etc... The addition of organic shapes to a composition dominated by geometric structures can add unpredictable energy.\n\nArtists must pay attention not only the surface qualities and underlying form of the objects he depicts but the shape these objects describe on the picture plane.\n\nSight-Sizing\n\nfrom:\n\nnotes for The Sight-Size Portrait Tradition, Nicholas Beer (2009)\n\nSince the very earliest commentaries on painting, it has been acknowledged that to ascertain unity of effect the artist should stand back and view the picture at a distance (commonly called sight-sizing). In Della Pittura of 1436, Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) suggests that if it is possible to think of a painting as a vertical plane which intersects the field of vision, then there is an optimal position from which it should be viewed: \"Each painter, endowed with his natural instinct, demonstrates this when, in painting this plane, he places himself at a distance as if searching the point and angle of the pyramid from which point he understands the thing painted is best seen.\"\n\nA generation later, in a passage from his Tratatto della Pittura, Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) states: \"It is also advisable to go some distance away, because then the work appears smaller, and more of it is taken in at a glance, and lack of harmony and proportion in the various parts and in the colors of the objects is more readily seen.\"\n\nSignature\n\nA signature is a handwritten depiction of someone's name, or, in some cases, even a simple \"X\" if he is not able to write, or other mark that a person writes on documents as a proof of identity and intent. Analogous to a handwritten signature, a \"signature work\" describes the work readily identifying its creator. A signature may be confused with an autograph, which, instead, is chiefly an artistic signature. The act of signing a painting can be very meaningful: by applying words onto an image, intentionally or not, the artist reminds the viewer that they are looking at a flat surface purposefully created by a real person.\n\nAlthough the great majority of extant artworks from Greek antiquity lack signatures, the Greek artist nonetheless signed his products far more than any other artist of the time. Artist signatures first became prevalent during the early Renaissance, which saw art production shift from co-operative guild systems to a celebration of individual creativity. Between the fourteenth and fifteenth century the artist's signature was conventional and straightforward. The signature included the artist's name, a date, usually assumed to be the date of completion, and occasionally, information about the person who commissioned the work and the site where the work was completed. Signatures were usually placed on the frame or along the bottom edge of the painting. Latin was preferred with numbers in Roman Numerals. After the mid-1400s Gothic fonts were replaced with Roman letters and the signatures were sometimes placed in more conspicuous places so as to add to its meaning. Additional phrases were adjoined to the signature telling the viewer how the artist felt about his work or what he wanted them to feel about it. Duccio Bouninsegna (c. 1255–1260–c. 1318–1319) of Siena inscribed on the base of a sculpture of the high alter of the Siena Cathedral \"Holy Mother of God, be peace for Siena's sake, be life for Duccio who painted you thus.\" Michelangelo left only one of his works signed (The Pieta'), which has given rise to much scholarly speculation. One of the most prolific and sought after paintings of the Baroque, Pieter Paul Rubens, rarely signed his work. Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) placed his famed monogram on everything from printed masterpieces to hurried sketches.\n\nThe manner in which painters have affixed their signatures varies enormously. Some painters signed with their initials, some with their whole names and some with Latinized names. Some used only a monogram, and some adopted their own handwriting style while still others in elegantly formed calligraphy, and a few a style midway between the later two. Particularly popular was the use of Roman lettering. Some signatures are incorporated within the image itself, and some appear to belong to the object over which they are superimposed. For example, a painter may place his signature on a piece of marble or stone rendering it with shadowed and illuminated sides as if the letters were carved into the marble itself. Some signatures were affixed on a small tromp-l'oeil paper called a cartellino. In any case, signatures were always applied with a brush, usually over a layer of dry, rather than wet paint. Occasionally, signatures took unusual forms such as secret codes, hidden signs and bizarre imagery. Lucas Cranach the Elder's (c. 1472–1553) signed his Adam and Eve (1526), on Tree of Life in the form of a winged snake-like creature wearing a crown and carrying a ring in its mouth.\n\nOwing to the close operative relationship between the master, assistants and apprentices of a botegga or workshop, signatures may have been less meaningful than today. Authenticity was not of overriding importance so a signature did not necessarily bear evidence that the work had been done entirely by the hand of the master, although some sources suggest that contemporaries were interested in knowing by whom a work had been made. Early paintings could be marked by the personal mark or stamp of the artisan or of his workshop as well as the hallmark of the guild or city council, in order to guarantee a certain level or quality. By the second half of the sixteenth century artists began to sign their works with signatures that resembled their written signatures, but monograms remained in usage. Still, not all painters signed their works. Before the 1600s, Italian painters often signed their works in full followed by a \"P\" or \"pinxit\" (Latin for painted) while in the Netherlands painters used \"pingebat,\" although the term \"fecit\" (Latin for made) was increasingly used. Seventeenth-century Dutch paintings with signatures were almost always followed by \"f[ecit].\" The great part of Dutch paintings are not signed except those by the most ambitious painters in order to distinguish their works from those of their less illustrious colleagues. Rembrandt seems to have signed almost all of his works. Some Dutch painters hid their signatures while some placed them so that they could not be overlooked. Many painters had variant signatures. The earliest documentation of falsely applied signatures can be pin-pointed to the last quarter of the seventeenth century.\n\nHowever, even when signatures are present caution must be exercised when examining it. Signatures were routinely added to works—without malign intentions, but simply to authenticate a well-known fact.\n\nAfter an analysis oif hundreds of artists' signatures the professor Yi Zhou of Florida State University holds that the size of an artist's signature may be closely linked to self-regard and that artists with bigger-than-average signatures, possess bigger egos and get greater-than-average attention. Zhou's paper argues: \"A one standard deviation increase in narcissism increases the market price by 16% and both the highest and lowest auction-house estimates by about 19%.\"\n\nFor a complete analysis of Vermeer's signatures, click here.\n\nSinking In\n\nfrom:\n\nGeorge O'Hanlon, \"Paint Glossary,\" Natural Pigments website, 2011. https://www.naturalpigments.com/artist-materials/paint-glossary-terminology\n\nIn the technique of applying successive coats of color to a picture, the oil in each superimposed coat can sink into the previous one (especially if the latter is not perfectly dry), resulting in color that appears dull. Before applying fresh paint, therefore, the artist may spread a thin coat of oil or medium over the colors already laid, in order to match the tone and hue of the fresh color, uniting the new layer with the previous. This is called \"oiling out,\" and the thin glaze of medium is called a \"couch.\" Sinking-in of the vehicle should be distinguished from that of the pigment: in the former, the surface becomes dull, in the latter it becomes shining from the supernatant oil. Sinking-in is also the result of a ground that is too absorbent or unevenly absorbent, draining the paint layer of its vehicle. Using too much thinner with paint, weakening the binder's capacity to form a film and exposing pigment particles to the air, can also counter-sinking.\n\nSitter/Model\n\nA person who poses for the figure(s) to be represented in an artist's work\n\nWomen are seem to be the central focal point of many of Vermeer's paintings. \"Vermeer painted about 49 figures of women, but only 12 men, and no children (despite having an extremely large family himself). This emphasis on women is logical in the work of an artist who was entirely devoted to the painting of interiors, as the domestic space was the realm which society had assigned to women. Nonetheless, while for Pieter de Hooch (1629–1684) and Nicolaes Maes (1634–1693) the home was a setting for maternity and domestic tasks, Vermeer was alert to the appearance of a new type of woman, better educated than her predecessors and more absorbed in her interior life. It is not my chance that among the innovations of interior paintings we find a sensibility towards the intimate psychology of individuals, given the concept of an interior life was developing at just this time. Street life and family life became more separated in houses at this period and more private spaces and areas for withdrawing begun to appear.\" Alejandro Vergara, ed., Vermeer and the Dutch Interior (Madrid: Museo Nacional del Prado, 2003), 20.\n\nOddly enough, the only historically documented sitter in Vermeer's oeuvre was Vermeer himself who posed for a now lost self-portrait cited in the 1696 Dissius auction of 21 Vermeer paintings. The remaining women and men who populate the artist's extant interiors remain anonymous. Perhaps this fact has encouraged much speculation by scholars and public alike as to just who they may have been.\n\nDue to the intimate nature of Vermeer's art, there has been a certain inclination to link Vermeer's own family members to the sitters of his paintings, some of which seemed to have posed more than once. The economic advantage of employing sitters from the artist's family willing to pose long hours without pay would be obvious. This fact would not be without precedent. Gerrit ter Borch (1617–1681) , a fellow Dutch artist whose discreet genre interiors probably inspired some of Vermeer's own compositions, frequently used members of his own family as models, in particular his step-sister Gesina. The tenderness with which Ter Borch portrays this woman on numerous occasions indicates his fondness for her.\n\nSize\n\nMaterial applied to a surface as a penetrating sealer, to alter or lessen its absorbency and isolate it from subsequent coatings. Traditional sizes for paintings may have been rabbit skin or fish glue. Parchment was also used. Size also serves to protect the canvas, as oil paint in direct contact with the canvas will cause it to become weak and brittle.\n\nTraditional size for oil was a solution of rabbit skin collagin heated with water. Although this has been used for hundreds of years it is know known by conservators to cause more problems than it solves. Since the size continuously absorbs moisture from the atmosphere, causing it to continuously swell and shrink, over time, this constant flexing causes the oil paint on top, which is quite brittle, to crack. It is now believed to be the main cause of cracking in old oil paintings.\n\nSketch\n\nA sketch is a rapidly executed depiction of a subject or complete composition, which is usually produced in preparation for a more detailed and completed work. \"Despite the interest in the outdoors, the Dutch landscape painters rarely painted their. His usual practice was to make sketches of scenes that caught his eye; then, returning to his studio, he would begin to paint, using his drawings for reference. And since he might use as many as a dozen drawings from different locations in a single painting, the final scene was often entirely the product of his imagination.\"Hans Koningsburger, The World of Vermeer 1632â1675 (New York: Tine-Life Books, 1968), 109.\n\nMany Dutch painters also sketched their initial idea directly on the canvas (see in-depth investigation of Rembrandt's (1606–1669) drawing techniques in Ernst van de Wetering (Rembrandt: Artist at Work). Although a great number of sketches on paper by Rembrandt have survived, very few of them were intended as preparatory works for his painting compositions.\n\nAlthough no preparatory or final drawings of Vermeer remain, this does not necessarily mean that he had not at some time or the other produced them. Drawings, although collected by some connoisseurs at the time, did not have the same value as they do today and considering that Vermeer's preparatory drawings might have been done in a more schematic rather than expressive style, it is not unreasonable that they were not deemed of great value. A single \"folio\" such as the ones listed in the artist's death inventory may have contained his precious drawings which could have been lost or destroyed.\n\nAs odd as it may seem, it is possible that Vermeer was able to transfer the final image of his composition without having ever realized any kind of material sketch or drawing. Philip Steadman, in his study of Vermeer's use of the camera obscura (a sort of precursor of the modern photographic camera widely known by painters in Vermeer's time), conjectures that the artist may have actually traced the image projected by the camera obscura directly on the canvas. The camera obscura, which certainly served Vermeer as a compositional aid, would have rendered preparatory drawing superfluous. Although some scholars still strongly dissent with Steadman's arguments, a growing number have begun to concede they have a strong rational base and moreover are in conformity with Vermeer's pictorial and expressive objectives. (For detailed information on the subject, read Steadman's Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth behind the Masterpieces, or visit his web site at: http://www.vermeerscamera.co.uk/home.htm.)\n\nSkill\n\nA skill is the ability to carry out a task with pre-determined results often within a given amount of time, energy or both. Skill is acquired through deliberate, systematic and sustained effort to smoothly and adaptively carryout complex activities or job functions involving ideas, things and/or people.\n\nAll of the arts have traditionally demanded great levels of skill. Until the 1850s, the greatest artists we were also the most skillful. Today, skill is no longer a requirement for visual artists longer or a meter for judging artworks; conceptual artist views skill as largely irrelevant, or \"busy work.\" They are happy to hire highly skilled artisans to create their physical work.\n\nThe two components underlying the creation of a painting or sculpture, conception and execution, were characterized around 1400 by Cennino Cennini (c. 1370–c. 1440) as fantasia (imagination) and operazione di mano (handiwork), and by Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) in 1568 as il mio pensiero (my considered judgment) and le mie mani (my hands). Renaissance society focused on the second component, the arte or, in Latin, ars, that signified the skill of hand or mastery of illusionism required to execute the work, a skill that could be mastered by practice. The artists themselves, on the other hand, emphasized the ingegno or ingenium, the inborn talent or creative power needed to conceive the work in the first place, that could not be learned. For Vasari, a key element in the intellectual component of art lay in disegno (planning/drawing) which underlay the three \"arts of design\" (painting, sculpture, architecture). These principles were incorporated into the Florentine Academy of Design (founded 1563) which, although it did not replace the apprenticeship system, did much to elevate the status of artists.\n\nIn the time of Vermeer there existed a level of skill among artists that is now scarcely imaginable. As Ernst van der Wetering pointed out, \"if we wish to get an idea of the discipline and skill of a painter like Rembrandt (1606–1669) today, we would do better not to look at the great majority of our contemporary painters, but at the performing musician or ballet dancer. In these arts, it is still understood that professional skill can only be built up through endless practice from an early age on...and the same pertained just as much in Rembrandt's day to the art of drawing and painting. But it should be added that whoever inquires more than superficially into the careers of those dancers and musicians of our own time who have practiced all their lives, will realize that only a few arc able to command that unique set of qualities and talents that are necessary in order to develop into major artists. Without that basis of skills, there is, however, no way that this can happen.\"\n\nBasic artistic skills were taught through the tried-and-proven master/apprentice relationship in which the young painter acquired hands-on experience regarding every facet of painting technique. The apprentice's skills were developed gradually through unremitting practice and as his skills improved, he was allowed to work on his master's work, filling in anonymous backgrounds or tedious vegetation, while attending to his chores such as cleaning brushes, setting out the daily palette, stretching canvases, processing and grinding pigments and running errands. Some of the most important skills were drawing from previous works of arts (copying), drawing from life, foreshortening, perspective, composition and chiaroscural modeling.\n\nSolvent\n\nA solvent is a substance that dissolves a soluble material (or solute). For example, varnish is insoluble in water but might dissolve in propanone or acetone. The solubility of a substance depends on many factors, but a solute will dissolve in a solvent that has a similar polarity.\n\nSolvents such as turpentine, mineral spirits, and odorless mineral spirits are the most commonly found in the artist's studio. Turpentine, is the strong smell that is associated with an oil painter's studio but turpentine many causes health problems for some people including irritation of the skin, eyes, mucous membranes and upper respiratory tract.\n\nSpatial Depth\n\nSee also, overlap.\n\nThe creation of a convincing illusion of three-dimensional depth, or spatial depth, in artworks is considered a major achievement of the Renaissance although various techniques had been employed to achieve depth from Antiquity onwards. Color was no longer primarily symbolic and the relative scale of various figures was determined by their religious significance, as was the case in medieval Last Judgment paintings and frescos. Renaissance painters realized that objects appear to get smaller as their distance from the observer increases and that color, the manipulation of detail and chiaroscural values could all enhance the sense of depth. Willem Seitz, a painter and art historian, maintains that \"through one pictorial device or another the greatest percentage of the world's paintings has dealt with the representation of space.\"William C. Seitz, Monet (New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1960), 40.\n\nSpatial depth can be achieved by a number of methods. Since depth is not really present in painting (except for slight relief of the canvas tooth, paint thickness and the discreet overlapping of different paint layers) its sensation must be communicated by exploring a series of so-called visual depth cues. Depth cues can be applied singularly in different parts of the painting (e.g., overlap) or over the whole design (e.g. perspective) but are most effective when used systematically in unison. Each cue communicates different visual information.\n\nThe cues used in painting to achieve the illusion of depth are called monocular cues. Monocular cues can be perceived with just one eye or both eyes. On the other hand, binocular cues are based on information gathered from both eyes.\n\nThe principal means of creating the illusion of three-dimensional depth on a flat surface are overlapping, changing size and placement, linear perspective, and relative hue and value. For the oil painter the illusion of spatial depth may also be also enhanced by exploiting the inherent physical and optical properties of paint itself.\n\nOverlap, or occlusion, is the strongest cue for depth and overrides all other cues when a conflict seems to be present. When one object occludes part of another object there must be space between them although simple overlap by itself does not furnish clues at what distance they are from one another. Objects that occlude seem nearer while objects that are occluded seem further away. The viewer must be able to recognize the partially overlapped object otherwise the two objects might appear to be sitting side by side.\n\nSize and scale - Larger objects tend appear closer and smaller objects appear further away.\n\nLinear perspective is a technique which allows artists to simulate or construct the appearance of three dimensional space on a two dimensional surface in a rational manner. The property of parallel lines converging in the distance, at infinity, allows us to reconstruct the relative distance of two parts of an object, or of landscape features. An example would be standing on a straight road, looking down the road, and noticing the road narrows as it goes off in the distance. It is one of the major innovations of European art, with an extraordinary impact on western visual culture from the fifteenth to the nineteenth centuries.\n\nRelative hue, value, focus, texture and detail provide various clues of visual depth such as:\n\nThings with more detail, sharper or larger textures are seen as closer\n\nThings with few detail, sharper or larger textures are seen as far away.\n\nThings with darker colors look closer.\n\nThings with lighter colors look further away.\n\nThings with sharp silhouettes seem to advance.\n\nThings with blurry outlines seem to recede.\n\nObjects with colors that are close in value seem close to each other in space.\n\nStrongly contrasting colors appear to separate in space.\n\nComparable sized objects that are placed lower in the image as closer to us, and objects that are placed higher as being further away.\n\nWarm colors (red orange, yellow) seem to advance towards to the viewer.\n\nCool colors (blue and bluish green and purple) seem to recede from the viewer.\n\nObjects with saturated colors seem to advance.\n\nObjects with low saturated colors seem to recede.\n\nThe manner in which light falls on an object and reflects off its surface are effective cues for the brain to determine the shape of objects and their position in space. The shape and direction of cast shadows also provide depth cues\n\nThe sensation of spatial depth can also be greatly enhanced by exploiting paints inherent physical and optical properties.\n\nObjects painted with thick, textured paint and visible brushstrokes seem to advance.\n\nObjects painted with thin or transparent paint seem to recede.\n\nPhysical overlap of paint layers tends to enhance overlap cues.\n\nIn The Girl with a wine Glass, the most ambitious and carefully contrived of Vermeer's three early interiors, the artist employed various tactic to reinforce the sense of spatial recession: overlapping, geometrical perspective, sharp and blurred contours, and variations in color saturation (brighter colors which seem nearer to the viewer's eye are reserved for the foreground figures while the background figures are depicted with drab greens and mute browns). The disorderly recession of the small ochre and blue ceramic tiles in proximity to the background walls of both pictures reveals a less than complete mastery of perspective.\n\nSprezzatura\n\nSee also, je ne sais quoi.\n\nSprezzatura is a term coined by Italian statesman Baldesar Castiglione in his Il libro del cortegiano (1528) to describe an ideal of courtly behavior. Castiglione defined sprezzatura as a style of behavior in which every action \"conceals art, and presents what is done and said as if it was done without effort and virtually without thought\" (Book 1, Chapter 26). Sprezzatura is usually translated as \"nonchalance.\" The Italian author was likely elaborating upon \"an ancient Roman notion of seeming negligence that was already expressed by Ovid and Virgil. According to Castiglione, sprezzatura had to be found primarily in the courtier's speech and in the gracefulness of his movements while exercising, giving the example of a horseman who does not sit stiffly in the saddle, but seems to ride without any effort with an ease and confidence as if he were on foot.\"Harry Berger Jr., The Absence of Grace: Sprezzatura and Suspicion in Two Renaissance Courtesy Books (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2000), 296.\n\nSprezzatura is a contradictory concept because it demands \"the ability to show that one is not showing all the effort one obviously put into learning how to show that one is not showing effort.\"Harry Berger Jr., The Absence of Grace: Sprezzatura and Suspicion in Two Renaissance Courtesy Books (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2000), 296. Castiglione resolved this paradox of contrived spontaneity by contrasting sprezzatura with affettazione (affectation), which \"exceeds certain boundaries of moderation\" and must be avoided \"in every way possible as though it were some very rough and dangerous reef..\" Affectation draws attention to the effort the courtier makes in maintaining the appearance of taking \"no thought in what he is about.\" Castiglione illustrated the difference between affectation and sprezzatura by contrasting the ungraceful rider who tries \"to sit stiff in his saddle (in the Venetian style, as we are wont to say\" with \"one who sits his horse as free and easy as if he were on foot.\"\n\nIt has been hypothesized that the rough manner in Dutch painting, practiced by Frans Hals (c. 1582–1666) and Rembrandt (1606–1669), was a conscious aesthetic choice and is tied to the concept of lossigheydt, \"looseness.\" Castiglione, in effect, had already equivalent of the sprezzatura of the Italian writer Baldassare had already drawn parallels between the effortless nonchalance of courtly behavior and the loose, seemingly careless touches that the artist applied with his brush. He explicitly drew the parallel between the manner of the courtier and the artist's ability to draw a seemingly effortless line: \"Often too in painting, a single line not labored, a single brushstroke easily drawn, so that it seems as if the hand moves unbidden to its aim according to the painter's wish, without being guided by care or any skill, clearly reveals the excellence of the craftsman, which every man appreciates according to his capacity for judging.\"\n\nStaffage\n\nHuman figures or animals added into a painting, especially in a landscape. Some painters had other artist add these elements to their works if they felt that they were not as adept at painting the figures. It was standard practice with many architectural painters (and landscape painters) that figures were added by collaborators, often from different cities. Staffage figures were always added once the underlying architecture or landscape was dry.\n\nStelsel\n\nThe Dutch word stelsel, from stellen (to place), is similar to ordineren (to arrange). Both terms were used to describe the organization of the composition. Stesel refers to generalized sketch in any material, used as a guide to the composition.\n\nStand Oil\n\nStand oil is nothing more than linseed oil that has been heated to about 525–573º F under conditions that exclude oxygen for a number of hours. This process changes the oil's mechanical and physical properties. The change is a molecular one called polymerization; nothing is added to the oil and nothing is lost. Stand oil forms a tough strong film for paint and its working qualities differ so much from the drying oils listed above that it is hard to believe that it has been obtained only by heat.\n\nAlthough stand oil appears darker than oil in its pure from, if diluted with turpentine to obtain good working consistency, it is actually paler than straight linseed oil. It turns much less yellow with age than raw oils do and when it is diluted or mixed with other ingredients to a usable consistency, the resulting medium is practically non-yellowing. Only very little quantity of stand oil is necessary to appreciable alter a paint's characteristics.\n\nThe value of stand oil for fine painting has long been recognized and it seems that it was commonly employed by Dutch and Flemish painters.\n\nEven a small amount of stand oil imparts to paint an enamel-like smoothness and tends to make the paint fuse and blend. The paint layer, even if applied thickly, levels out to a smooth, enamel-like surface. Being so heavy, it supplies the paint with a \"drag\" that permits the painter to manipulate the brush with the greatest deliberation obtaining the most precise control imaginable. Contours can be subtly fused with the background and one can easily manage thick layers of opaque paint without digging up the underlying paint with the brush. It is particularly useful for achieving thick, perfectly homogeneous layers of opaque paint and lends pure white pigments an extraordinary luminosity. It also stays fluid for a length of time sufficient for elaborate modeling.\n\nWhen used properly, it produces a satin-like surface that recalls the finer works of Vermeer's mid career. Stand oil is also frequently used as a component for glazing mediums as well.\n\nNo trace of stand oil have been found in the works of Vermeer but this is probably due to the fact that specific tests must be performed to detect it and the great parts of Vermeer's canvases have not been examined in depth.\n\nStill Life\n\nA painting in which the subject matter is an arrangement of objects—fruit, flowers, tableware, pottery and so forth—brought together for their pleasing contrasts of shape, color and texture. Dutch still life painters delighted in the play and contrast of transparent and reflective surfaces: the finely wrought metal of the ewer, the representation of smooth glass, the weave of the linen drapery, the dry crumbly texture of the bread, and the wet, shiny insides of the open pomegranate. At first glance, this still life implies an absence of human presence. But a closer look reveals just the opposite. The torn bread, half empty glass of wine, sliced fruit, and overturned glass allude to human intervention, as if these lavish delicacies were abruptly left on the table.\n\nThe term derives from the Dutch stilleven, which became current from about 1650 as a collective name for this type of subject matter. Still life painting flourished in Holland in the 1600s. A great interest in botany arose toward the end of the 1500s, when collectors of herbs and plants were spending fortunes on their gardens; their desire for portraits of their prized possessions fueled the popularity of flower painting. Later on, Dutch still-lives were eagerly taken up by French painters and collectors and came to decorate the most fashionable French salons. Among the most famous Dutch and Flemish painters who specialized in still life subjects were Willem Heda (1593/1594–c. 1680/1682), Willem Kalf (1619–1693), Jan Fyt (1611–1661), Frans Snyders (1579–1657), Jan Weenix (1640/1649–1719), Melchior d'Hondecoeter (c. 1636–1695), Jan van Huysum (1682–1749), and the de Heem family.\n\n\"In seventeenth-century Holland the pressures of art theory were less heavy and real, and it was here that landscape and still life, as an autonomous categories of painting, began to occupy major place in art production. Even so, there was no serious theoretical discussion of them; Dutch theorists tended to regard the practitioners of still life in particular as something of a joke. Samuel van Hoogstraten (1627–1678), just after the middle of the seventeenth century, called them 'common footmen of the Army of Art. '\"R. H. Fuchs, Dutch Painting (London: Thames & Hudson, 1976), 42.\n\n\"Though it started in the kitchen, still life painting soon branched out to include a whole catalogue of decorative and useful items which Dutch burgers surrounded themselves: silver tankards, half-filled wine glasses, tobacco pipes, musical instruments, parchment and globes, along with the usual fruit, vegetables and game. As the century wore on, still life reflected the increasing of middle-class luxury; the late 1660s simple white tablecloths had given way to ornate Persian rugs and china was often fine Ming. Such glorification of the Good Life matched the mood of the prosperous art buyer. The paintings obviously fit nicely over his dining table, and the artists who made them were assured of a steady demand.\"Hans Koningsburger, The World of Vermeer 1632â1675 (New York: Tine-Life Books, 1968), 101.\n\nBy far the most common generic name for what are today called still lifes is \"bancquet\" (diminutive \"bancquettien\"); the abstract designations are \"vanitas\" and \"memento mori\"; the specific may be any title from a \"roemer with oysters\" to a \"skull.\" The words ontbift/ ontbijtken (breakfast) and stil leven may also be construed as generic terms. The word stil leven first appears in Delft in the inventory of Gertruy van Mierevelt who died on 30 October, 1639, and again in an Amsterdam inventory of 1647.\n\nA bancquet could equally well denote a seated meal (as in \"banquet of the gods\") or a still life (as in \"a little banquet of oysters\"). These are quite different sorts of paintings-the former coming closer to genre or \"history\" than to still life-and it may have caused confusion in identifying paintings in inventories.John Michael Montias, \"How Notaries and Other Scribes Recorded Works of Art in Seventeenth-Century Sales and Inventories,\" Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art 30, no. 3/4 (2003): 225.\n\nCompetition in the Dutch art market was fierce and consequentially, prices were generally low. In order to survive each painter had to secure himself a particular style to differentiate his work from others already available. Many painters depended on secondary sources of income to survive. Since it took a very long time to become proficient in any one category of painting such as landscape, still life, or portraiture, painters usually worked in one area only.\n\nWithin this context Vermeer, like Rembrandt (1606–1669), was a part of a minority of more talented Dutch painters who were able to work in different categories. However, neither Rembrandt nor Vermeer are known to have painted independent still lifes.\n\nStretcher & Strainer\n\nA wooden chassis for textile supports that has expandable corners. Even though canvas is generally attached to a stretcher or a strainer, it may remain unsupported, or be stuck onto some sort of rigid support such as panel. Stretchers and strainers are generally made of wood (most commonly pine or ash) and usually with tongue and groove joins, mitred at the corners and beveled away from the canvas toward the inside. The terms stretcher and strainer are often used interchangeably, but should differentiate between a framework which has no method of opening out the joins to tighten the canvas (strainer), and one which does by means of wedges or keys (stretcher). Recently new methods of creating a more even tensioning have been developed using metal inserts in the wood which enlarge the joint evenly through each member of the stretcher. Large paintings require the stretcher itself to be further supported. This is provided by cross members or cross bars. Today's familiar expandable stretchers which take up the lost tension by means of wedges inserted in the corners became common only in the 1750s.\n\nThe profiles on the stretcher bar should be slightly rounded. This has two advantages: It allows the framer to see and obtain clear edges on images that have precise borders; it also allows the canvas weave to \"roll over\" the profile rather than snap over a sharp edge which is a major cause of canvas cracking.\n\nThere are many different stretcher bar profiles, and many different styles of cutting of the wood. So it is impossible to say anything is \"standard.\" There are also many big regional difference in the style and cutting of the wood, due to the historical reasons. For the same reasons, the wood used for making stretcher bars differs a lot from country to country depending on the forest that is present. But most stretchers, to avoid warping is made in well dried Nordic pinewood sourced from Scandinavia, Russia and Canada.\n\nAnother way in which stretcher bars can be strengthened is by having a cross brace inserted. It is advised that lengths over 40 cm. or 1 meter be fitted with a cross brace. By doing this it ensures the wood will not warp and will hang flat.\n\nIn sevententh-century Netherlands, cloth was measured by el, a measurement that varied from town to town. It generally ranged from 68â70 cm. Dutch paintings, which have often been studied, approximate this standard size. In a study of Vermeer's paintings, observations reveal different formats used for different subjects. These could be distinguished by the differences in height-to-width ratios. Prepared artists' materials existed in the Netherlands and standard sizes occurred, but, again not with the standardization of the French charts or numbers to identify one size from another. By the 19th century, French color merchants had such influence on the market that in Holland, as in many other places, the French system was followed.\n\nVermeer's late Guitar Player is a rarity of seventeenth-century paintings in as much as it is one of the few canvases of seventeenth century that is still is on its original stretcher complete with the original wooden pegs once used fasten the canvas to its stretcher.\n\nStofuitdrukking\n\nThe term stofuitdrukking, exclusive to the Dutch language, describes the way the painter conveys the look and feel of materials, especially fabric. In addition to a composition or narrative, the expression of virtuoso rendering of various substances was one of the prime goals of the Dutch painter. Dust, gloss, rough and smooth textures were side by side in order to heighten their reciprocal effects. Many still lifes were composed expressly to show as many different surface textures as possible. Recurring motifs were glasses, often partially filled with wine and a plethora of metal objects: a rusty knife, a tin can, and silver, pewter or gold objects, or a dusty lute. Other favorite stofuitdrukking motifs were foods with a different surface qualities such as grapes, crustaceans, lemons, bread and fruits. One of the most accomplished practitioners of this type of painting was Willem Heda (1593/1594–c. 1680/1682) who often represented two different tablecloths in his still lifes.\n\nStrong Colors\n\nThe bright colors of the seventeenth-century palette were known as the \"strong colors.\" Compared to those available at a reasonably supplied art shop of today, the seventeenth-century painter had to do with a paltry few bright and stable colors, the most widespread being: ultramarine blue, azurite, lead-tin yellow, vermilion, verdigris, orpiment and red madder. Various yellow and red lakes were available but produce a bright hue only when the are used as a glaze. Strong light tends to destroy the local color, just as a strong colors partially or totally destroy the effect of light. Strong colors confined to one object have a hard, cut-out effect. Strong colors seem to advance toward the eye. They were general reserved for brightly colored drapery, skies, fruit, flowers and vegetation.\n\nSeventeenth-century artist lacked strong oranges and purples. Moreover, the strong colors that were available were not always mutually compatible and even if two strong colors are mixed to produce a new tint (e.g., blue and yellow to create green) the intensity of the new color is always less intense that either of the original colors. Strong colors were generally used in their purest state possible, to preserve their intensity and minimize adverse behavioral properties.\n\nStudio/W0rkshop\n\nSee also, atelier and botegga.\n\nA studio is an artist's or worker's place of work. This can be for the purpose of actin or producing architecture, painting, pottery (ceramics), sculpture, woodwork, photography, graphic design, music and other artistic activities.\n\n"
