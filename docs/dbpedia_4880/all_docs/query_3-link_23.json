        "text": "Happy Summer! At a recent community event we had some requests for music nights. Good news, folks – our first one is here! Also thank you to the tireless work of our Lead Librarian Lisa and Trustee Theresa for their hard work getting all the grants to support these events. Here are our upcoming events for this July:\n\nStorytime with Amy Huntington\n\nSaturday, July 13th, 10 am to 12 pm\n\nJoin local author Amy Huntington for a storytime followed by outdoor water play. Bring bathing suits and towels!\n\nThank you to CLIF for sponsoring this event.\n\nTrustee Meeting\n\nTue, July 16th, 6:30pm – 8:00pm\n\nOur monthly board meeting that gathers the trustees and librarians. The public is invited to attend.\n\nMonkton Music Night\n\nThurs, July 18th, 5:30 – 8:30\n\nJoin us for a magical night of music and entertainment with local band Edna. We’ll also have a local food truck serving tacos, a bunch of kids activities, and visiting artisan Woolf Den Homestead teaching crystal bracelet making.\n\nThank you to the 5 Town Friends of the Arts for funding this evening.\n\nStitch and Spin\n\nSun, July 21st, 10am – 1pm\n\nJoin us for a monthly spin and stitch-in! All fiber crafts welcome.\n\nAnd don’t forget our Toddler Tuesdays (3-6 pm)! This is a WEEKLY event going on in the library itself. No pressure, just stop in if you’re interested in hanging out.\n\nKat Recommends: Under the Whispering Door by T.J. Klune\n\nWhen a reaper comes to collect Wallace Price from his own funeral, Wallace suspects he really might be dead.\n\nInstead of leading him directly to the afterlife, the reaper takes him to a small village. On the outskirts, off the path through the woods, tucked between mountains, is a particular tea shop, run by a man named Hugo. Hugo is the tea shop’s owner to locals and the ferryman to souls who need to cross over.\n\nBut Wallace isn’t ready to abandon the life he barely lived. With Hugo’s help, he finally starts to learn about all the things he missed in life.\n\nI’ve only read two of T.J. Klune’s books, but I love them both dearly despite of the romances depicted in each. (Nothing against romance, it’s just not my cup of tea.) But Whispering Door is the most heartwarming tale of a miserable lawyer going from pretty much Disney villain to actual, complex human being I’ve ever seen. There’s intrigue, a couple of mysteries woven skillfully throughout, and some supernatural elements, yet each character is so lovingly rendered and believable. This should, by all accounts, be the sort of Hallmark Channel Original that I find frustratingly dull, and yet I loved every minute of it. I laughed, I cried, and I thought about the book for weeks after I put it down.\n\nI recommend this for anyone who likes character work, who enjoys friendly ghost tales, and who wants proof that you can have a romance without the classical tropes detracting from the genuine feel of these characters.\n\nAvailable at in hardcopy and as an audiobook and ebook.\n\nDid you notice the new green stickers on the spines of some of our books? These mean that the people who wrote these books claim Vermont as their home state! In marking these books we found some authors who aren’t as famous as Archer Mayor or Chris Bohjalian, but that might be interesting to you anyway.\n\nOn Brassard’s Farm by Daniel Hecht\n\nIn a radical departure from her urban life, Ann Turner buys a piece of remote Vermont land and sets up a tent home in deep forest. She’s trying to escape an unending string of personal disasters in Boston; more, she desperately wants to leave behind a world she sees as increasingly defined by consumerism, hypocrisy, and division.\n\nAs she writes in her journal, “There’s got to be a more honest, less divided way to live.”\n\nShe soon learns she was mistaken in thinking a kindly Mother Earth would grant her wisdom and serenity in her new home. The forest confronts her with unanticipated dangers, aching loneliness, harsh weather, instinctive fears, and unsettling encounters with wild animals. It’s beautiful, yes, but life in the woods is never easy. When necessity requires her to start work as a farmhand, she quickly realizes that she held similarly childish illusions about small farms. Under the stern tutelage of Diz Brassard, the farm’s sixty-year-old matriarch, and the gentler guidance of Earnest Kelley, an Oneida Indian friend of the Brassards, she discovers what hard work really means. Ann faces her predicament with determination, but there’s a lot to learn—about the Brassard family, about dairy farming, and about herself. If she is to succeed in her new life, she must become as tough and resilient as the rural community she lives in. She must also learn to accept love—even if it arrives in the most unexpected forms.\n\nI Am Not Who you Think I Am by Eric Rickstad\n\nWayland Maynard is just eight years old when he sees his father kill himself, finds a note that reads I am not who you think I am, and is left reeling with grief and shock. Who was his father if not the loving man Wayland knew? Terrified, Wayland keeps the note a secret, but his reasons for being afraid are just beginning.\n\nEight years later, Wayland makes a shocking discovery and becomes certain the note is the key to unlocking a past his mother and others in his town want to keep buried.\n\nWith the help of two friends, Wayland searches for the truth. Together they uncover strange messages scribbled in his father’s old books, a sinister history behind the town’s most powerful family, and a bizarre tragedy possibly linked to Wayland’s birth. Each revelation raises more questions and deepens Wayland’s suspicions of everyone around him. Soon, he’ll regret he ever found the note, trusted his friends, or believed in such a thing as the truth.\n\nThe Round Barn by Suzi Wizowaty\n\nTuesday Bailey and his cousin Mary witness with mixed emotions the helicopter removal of a silo, the core of a round barn, from its Vermont hillside to a nearby folk museum. Tuesday, chief of buildings and grounds at the museum, is pleased that it goes smoothly and that he’s able to spend time with Mary, for whom he’s carried a torch since they were teenagers growing up together; Mary, meanwhile, a dowser happily married to the owner of the town’s general store, is disturbed without knowing why—but then learns she has inoperable cancer, which is spreading fast. Meanwhile, the museum’s p.r. director, Didi, her partner away for the summer at an artists’ colony, finds herself attracted to a local reporter (male) covering the barn story. She also has as a houseguest her 18-year-old nephew David, a proto-architect and maker of unique birdhouses, who’s gay and also fascinated by the barn—especially after he finds brooding, brilliant Dean Allen, the museum’s most mysterious employee, lurking there. Then there’s the museum’s newest board member, wealthy art-collector and widow Frieda, in Vermont for the summer with her difficult daughter, who starts a fling with the museum’s patrician director. Tuesday yearns to be with Mary, Mary is dying to hear “the voice of God in her bones,” Didi dithers with the reporter, David laps up the knowledge that Dean spews forth, Dean has an unhealthy fixation with fire, and Frieda ultimately decides to return to New York. As for the ghost—well, his tale is tangled too.\n\nThe Inquest by Jeffrey D. Marshall\n\nIn 1830, Experience “Speedy” Goodrich died after undergoing an abortion in Burlington, Vermont. This tragedy and the resulting inquiry provide the foundation for Jeffrey D. Marshall’s meticulously researched first novel. From the vibrant intellectual life of the University of Vermont to the public outcry over grave-robbing medical students in search of subjects for dissection, and from the progressive social movements of the day to the commercial bustle of a thriving inland port, Marshall offers a compelling portrait of the city and the era. Speedy’s death and the subsequent inquest are described by three narrators: Charles Daggett, a student at the UVM medical school who is accused of procuring – and some say actually performing – the abortion; Stephen Decatur Parker, an undergraduate who is drafted to serve as scribe for the inquest into Goodrich’s death; and Nancy Goodrich Proctor, the sister of the deceased. Daggett and Proctor were real, while Parker is entirely fictional. Marshall gives them distinct and compelling voices as they recount the events of the tragedy and its personal consequences for each of them. The 1830s were a time of great social, political, and religious upheaval. As in our own time, abortion, religious fundamentalism, and civil liberties were topics of heated debate. Marshall places Speedy Goodrich’s story in the context of these enduring controversies in a work of fiction that is both dramatic and historically plausible.\n\nThe Invited by Jennifer McMahon\n\nIn a quest for a simpler life, Helen and Nate have abandoned the comforts of suburbia to take up residence on forty-four acres of rural land where they will begin the ultimate, aspirational do-it-yourself project – building the house of their dreams. When they discover that this beautiful property has a dark and violent past, Helen, a former history teacher, becomes consumed by the local legend of Hattie Breckenridge, a woman who lived and died there a century ago. With her passion for artifacts, Helen finds special materials to incorporate into the house – a beam from an old schoolroom, bricks from a mill, a mantel from a farmhouse – objects that draw her deeper into the story of Hattie and her descendants, three generations of Breckenridge women, each of whom died suspiciously. As the building project progresses, the house will become a place of menace and unfinished business: a new home, now haunted, that beckons its owners and their neighbors toward unimaginable danger\n\nThe eclipse may have passed, but the books on it are still here! Want to learn more about that amazing afternoon? Here are some non-fiction books we have specifically for this topic:\n\nAmerica’s First Eclipse Chasers:\n\nStories of Science, Planet Vulcan, Quicksand, and the Railroad Boom\n\nby Thomas Hockey\n\nOur tale follows the chaotic journeys of scientists and amateur astronomers as they trekked across the western United States to view the rare phenomenon of a total solar eclipse. The fascinating story centers on the expeditions of the 1869 total eclipse, which took place during the turbulent age of the chimerical Planet Vulcan and Civil War Reconstruction.\n\nThe protagonists—a motley crew featuring astronomical giants like Simon Newcomb and pioneering female astronomers like Maria Mitchell—were met with unanticipated dangers, mission-threatening accidents, and eccentric characters only the West could produce. Theirs is a story of astronomical proportions. Along theway, we will make several stops across the booming US railroad network, traveling from viewing sites as familiar as Des Moines, Iowa, to ones as distant and strange as newly acquired Alaska.\n\nFrom equipment failures and botched preparations to quicksand and apocalyptic ‘comets’, welcome to the wild, western world of solar eclipses.\n\nTotality: The Great North American Eclipse of 2024\n\nby Mark Littmann & Fred Espenak\n\nTotality: The Great North American Eclipse of 2024 is the most comprehensive source of information, photographs, and illustrations to help readers understand and safely enjoy all aspects of solar eclipses. It includes information on how best to photograph and video record an eclipse, as well as abundant maps, diagrams, and charts, as well as covering the science, history, mythology, and folklore of eclipses.\n\nThis new edition focuses especially on the eclipse of April 8, 2024 that passes across Mexico, the United States, and Canada, including detailed maps, precise locations, and weather prospects.\n\nAmerican Eclipse: a nation’s epic race to catch the shadow of the moon\n\nand win the glory of the world\n\nby David Baron\n\nAMERICAN ECLIPSE tells the story of these pioneering scientists—planet hunter James Craig Watson, astronomer Maria Mitchell, and inventor Thomas Edison—who gathered in the West with an extraordinary cast of supporting characters on a day when the sun hid and far more was revealed. An untold tale of ambition, failure, and eventual triumph, the book brings to life the intellectual and technological flowering of late-nineteenth-century America, a period that laid the foundation for the country’s eventual rise to scientific greatness.\n\nEclipse: our sky’s most dazzling phenomenon\n\nby Kelsey Oseid\n\nIn Eclipse, celebrated artist and author Kelsey Oseid explores the science and mystique of lunar and solar eclipses, from the myths of our ancestors to today. Did you know that in Chinese legends, solar eclipses were caused by dragons eating the sun? Or that the Norse people believed that a sky wolf chased away the moon? Oseid presents these rich historical stories alongside informative, accessible science to enrich your understanding: a solar eclipse only occurs during a new moon; a selenelion is when you can see the lunar eclipse in front of you and the sunset behind you; and the Mars Rovers have even taken photographs of eclipses from Mars."
