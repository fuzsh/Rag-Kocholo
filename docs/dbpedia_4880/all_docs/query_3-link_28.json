        "text": "Boy oh boy .. it sure seems that if it’s not one thing it’s another … two weeks ago I was in New Jersey and couldn’t post up … last Wednesday we lost power for 24 hours and I could not produce a new show … so we ran a repeat (S10 EP08).\n\nSpring is special for music. I don’t know what it is, and I never have, but it sure seems that folks get the bug to go out roundabout March every year … I’ve seen it for over 20 years now. March & April … come June? Yeah, not so much for the summer – that’s outdoor season. But for now I’m enjoying seeing the rooms full of live music fans at Oskar Blues in Longmont and Lyons where I do sound on Friday and Saturday nights.\n\nEvery year I’m asked by about a half dozen entities (cities, venues, festivals) for my take on who’s who and who should be considered for booking … of course it’s a challenging task. More so now. The shear volume of skilled, talented and adequately rehearsed acts increases every year. The number one concern among buyers is, “what’s the draw?”\n\nFor national acts the answers can easily be researched via publications like Pollstar. Locally we don’t have any reliable way of tracking tickets sold, or seats occupied – we have to rely on our eyes, the buzz generated on the street and online.\n\nSeeing packed rooms sure does make my life, and that of my colleagues, a whole lot easier. Support … Represent … Enjoy … Repeat.\n\nListen for new music in EP10 … coming your way April 2-9.\n\nThe Colorado Playlist is supported by Colorado Hemp CO — Presenting the 3rd Annual NoCO HEMP EXPO April 1 & 2 at the Ranch Events Complex in First National Bank Building 5280 Arena Circle, Loveland, CO.\n\n100+ Vendors and Exhibitors, 50+ Speakers, Panelists and Industry Experts\n\nHemp Investor Summit\n\nElected State and National Representatives\n\nThousands of Hemp Advocates and Enthusiasts\n\nB2B Day for Hemp Industry\n\nExpo Day for the Entire Family\n\nMedia Spotlight on the Hemp Industry\n\nHemp Fashion Feature\n\nLive Entertainment\n\nBusiness networking Event\n\nSpecialty Workshops including: Building with Hemp, Cooking with Hemp, Brewing Beer with Hemp, Painting with Hemp, Artisan Crafting with Hemp\n\nThe Historic Mishawaks Amphitheatre — Celebrating 100yrs in the Poudre Canyon.\n\nPresenting:\n\n100th Anniversary Art Release AT THE DOWNTOWN ARTERY Friday, March 25, 2016 6:00 pm\n\nDowntown Artery Fort Collins, CO\n\nMish 100 Sleep-Out Friday, March 25th @ The Mish …\n\nThe Velvet Rope Dance Party March 25th\n\nPLAYLIST S10 EP09\n\nHOUR 1\n\nChuck Pyle “Step by Step” from Step By Step (1990)\n\nRebecca Folsom “Slice of Heaven” from Extraordinary Days (2016)\n\nLeftover Salmon “Sing Up to the Moon” from Aquatic Hitchhiker (2012)\n\nAndy Monley “Kites” from Triplight (2006)\n\nGlowing House “Loud and Clear” from Loud and Clear EP (2015)\n\nJay Munly “Amen Corner” from Munly & the Lee Lewis Harlots (2004)\n\nOption4 and Rose Quartz “Love is lonely” [single] (2016)\n\nInstant Empire “Zoo Lions” from Lamplight Lost (2015)\n\nAndy Thomas’ Dust Heart “Your Blood Moon” from Reckless Abandonment (2015)\n\nEverything Absent or Distorted (a love story) “Houses” from The Great Collapse (2009)\n\nDragondeer “Don’t That Feel Good” from Don’t That Feel Good (2014)\n\nChip Stephens Trio “Cookin’ at the Continental” from Hold On to What Counts (2007)\n\nHOUR 2"
