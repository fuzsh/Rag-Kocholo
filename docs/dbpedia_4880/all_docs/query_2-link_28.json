        "text": "Real quicksand, the kind that is almost impossible to extricate yourself from, is not just water and sand. Salt and clay are also major ingredients in this B-movie plot device, scientists report in the current issue of Nature.\n\nTheir study began when Dr. Daniel Bonn, a professor of physics at the University of Amsterdam, was in Iran a few years ago and saw signs warning of quicksand. Naturally, the warning prompted him to collect samples and he sank in to his ankles.\n\nHe quickly escaped, but even shallow quicksand can be hard to step out of. Back home, Dr. Bonn and his colleagues found out why. Sand grains in quicksand are usually loosely packed, with the clay acting as a fragile gel holding the grains together.\n\nHit with sudden force from, say, a hapless victim, the quicksand gel turns to liquid. Then salt causes clay particles to stick to one another instead of the sand grains, with the result that a victim ends up surrounded by densely packed sand."
