        "text": "Quicksand's \"Inversion\" is no longer a standalone track as the New York-based band have revealed details for their fourth studio album, Distant Populations, and served up a second single titled \"Missile Command.\"\n\nThe new track gives listeners a chance to get lost in the song, opening with a hypnotically fuzzed out low end groove before the song explodes into a heavier chorus. Walter Schreifels says of the song, “It really kind of focuses on Sergio’s (Vega) whole motif in a very simple way. He and Alan (Cage) just have this really kind of trademark groove, and I think that really sings on this one to me. I just felt like it's a kind of song that is very us, but we hadn't written it yet.” Check out the lyrics for \"Missile Command\" below and listen to the track in the player at the bottom of this post.\n\nQuicksand, \"Missile Command\" Lyrics\n\nThere is no reason for this collision\n\nApologies rain all season, forever\n\nI love you now more than I ever did\n\nWhen it rains I can’t change your mind\n\nTrue worlds bring\n\nAs lights fill up the sky\n\nYou better get used to it\n\nWishing you were here for this decision\n\nI don’t want to be wrong\n\nI don’t want to mislead\n\nStations of our present\n\nYou’re more than I’ll ever need\n\nCan’t explain why you change your mind\n\nAnd it rains\n\nTrue worlds bring\n\nAs lights fill up the sky\n\nYou better get used to it\n\nIt takes its own shape\n\n\"Missile Command\" is set to follow \"Inversion\" off of the upcoming Distant Populations album, which is due digitally on Aug. 13 with a vinyl release following on Sept. 25. See about picking up the album here.\n\nSpeaking about the record's duality, examining our simultaneous existence in individual relationships and as part of a mass society, Schreifels adds, “Everyone is on the one hand so connected with each other, and on the other hand, is so far apart. We’re checking out each other’s social media and we know what everybody’s doing. But when we’re sitting in the same room together, we’re looking at our phones.”\n\nYou can check out the Distant Populations track listing and artwork below. And look for Quicksand returning to the road this fall with their newly announced tour dates listed below. Tickets go on sale Friday (June 25) and can be purchased here.\n\nQuicksand, \"Missile Command\"\n\nQuicksand, Distant Populations Artwork + Track Listing\n\n1. Inversion\n\n2. Lightning Field\n\n3.
