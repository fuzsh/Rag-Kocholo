        "text": "Amber Sweeney is an accomplished singer/songwriter, Grammy Member, and transplant from the fast-paced world of Southern California to the serene and inspiring Battle Ground, Washington. Many fans and friends compare Amber’s voice as a blend of Sheryl Crow, Adele, & India Arie. In 2013, Amber released two EPs - The Starting Line (April 16) and Christmas Time (November 28). Both were released worldwide through CD Baby and are available on iTunes, Amazon, CD Baby, Spotify, and more. Amber was also selected to be one of three independent artists featured on a new television series, Indie Backroads, produced by Kevin Hayes of 371 Films. She has also been featured on Kink FM’s Homegrown Spotlight & KUMZ FM’s Local Roots radio. 2014 has kicked off strong with The Starting Line now on Pandora Radio. Amber has been in numerous bands throughout her childhood and adult life, including one of Battle Ground, Washington's resident rock bands, Enation (as the original bass player). She is also one half of a duo that was known as Everly. Everly had success with five of their original songs (Flying Machine, Girl In The Moon, Quicksand, Maybe, Stars) featured on the CW network's hit television series, One Tree Hill, as well as another CW show titled Life Unexpected. Amber has appeared in two episodes of One Tree Hill as part of her former bandmate's (Bethany Joy Lenz) back-up band. Amber started playing the guitar at age 6, and has picked up a variety of instruments since then. She penned her first song at age 14, and experienced her first job as a recording artist at age 15 with a Christian ska band known as No Supastar, of which she was the bass player and back-up singer. One of her original songs was featured on the band's only album titled, 180. With No Supastar, Amber found herself playing at large churches, festivals, clubs, and opened for acts such as POD, Jars of Clay, Jennifer Knapp, and more all before she was 18 years old. By age 18, Amber had recorded her first independent solo album titled, Today or Yesterday, with all original material. In 2006 she released an acoustic EP titled Somethin' Special. She has had a variety of jobs as a recording artist from singing on demo recordings for Grammy nominated producer, Ron Aniello, to co-producing & co-writing songs that have reached the top ten spot on iTunes charts. Amber has also performed her original material live at Tin Pan South in Nashville, and has played at infamous clubs throughout the US and internationally. Amber can also be heard on One From Many’s (O.F.M) latest album The Alleged Album, as back-up on Tears We Cry Alone (which is to be featured in an upcoming Independent Film titled Lies That I Told My Little Sister) and Shape Of Your Heart. Along with recording and performing, Amber has also launched a production company called In The Rounds Productions, and is a member of ASCAP, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and is a voting member of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, better known as the Grammy Foundation. - See more at: http://www.theambersweeney.com/bio/#sthash.m9K4iCta.dpuf"
