        "text": "1909\n\nIMP (International Motion Picture Company) founded by Carl Laemmle.\n\n1912\n\nThe Universal Film Manufacturing Company formed.\n\nAugust: Universal takes control of the Nestor Studio Operations in Hollywood. The Nestor ranch or Providencia ranch in the San Fernando Valley was called the “Oak Crest Ranch” in the film trade publications. Movie production begins.\n\nDecember 3: The Oak Crest Studio grounds were open to the Public. The location of Bison 101 brand of western movies.\n\n1913\n\nJuly 10: With an eye to publicity opportunities, a second official opening is held of the Oak Crest ranch, as it is formally named ‘Universal City’.\n\nAugust 13: Fifty Chimallo Indians from the Isleta reservation near Albuquerque, N. Mexico, are moved permanently to Oak Crest and installed in their new quarters, along with 100 head of horses recently purchased in New Mexico.\n\nSeptember: Universal City (Oak Crest Ranch) Tour began bus excursions from downtown Los Angeles\n\nFrom Moving Picture World around 1913:\n\nPlans for the biggest outdoor motion picture studio in the world have been completed by the Universal Company and will be carried out within the next year. The Universal Company has just purchased 12,000 acres of land in the San Fernando valley near the railroad station of Lankershim and about eight miles from Los Angeles.\n\nSurveyors are now laying it out and preliminary construction work is in progress. The property, which has been named “Oak Crest,” takes in among other natural objects, a mountain range, a river and a grove of timber. Leasing arrangements have also been made whereby the Universal Company will have the exclusive use of 8,000 acres of land adjoining its new property, with the privilege of purchase.\n\nThose who have time and inclination may figure out for themselves that a tract of land eight miles long and four miles wide contains, in round figures, 20,000 acres, and this will give some idea of the magnitude of the Universal’s new plant.\n\nThere are to be six mammoth stages capable of accommodating the biggest productions, and two of them will be of solid concrete so that horses and heavy wagons may be used on them, and fires built if necessary. The stages are now being built.\n\nAt one place the river is to be dammed and an artificial lake constructed. A few buildings are now under way and others are to be erected without delay. The initial outlay will amount to about $60,000, but the plans call for the expenditure of more than $1,000,000 in the next five years.\n\nIt is the intention of the company to make the new plant merely an addition to its present holdings in this locality. In all probability the Western headquarters of the Universal Company will remain at the old Nestor plant, Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street, Hollywood. A large part of the Western output of the company is now being made at this studio, although the cameras will be sent out to the new place within a week.\n\nOn August 13 fifty Chimallo Indians from the Isleta reservation near Albuquerque, N. Mex., were moved to Oak Crest and installed in their new quarters. With them went 100 head of horses recently purchased in New Mexico. Accommodations for 300 people, in addition to the Indians, are being built and Mr. Gilmore, the Western general manager, says that the payroll will exceed $250,000 a year.\n\n[The Moving Picture World, from Jerry’s Movie Locations]\n\n1914\n\nMarch: Carl Laemmle’s representative bought four tracts of land (Taylor, Boag, Davis and Hershey ranches) for $165,000. The 230 acre Taylor Ranch was to become the new Universal City Studio plant and the other three ranches the Back ranch.\n\nOak Crest Ranch / Universal operations began the move to the Lankershim, Universal City property.\n\nOct. 14. Universal City’s third grand opening; this event was for the Universal employees. At this time Carl Laemmle announced the official public opening was planned for February 2, 1915. All of Universal’s west coast operations had now moved to the Lankershim (Universal City) property.\n\nDamon and Pythius was the first film wholly completed on the site in 1914.\n\nFrom The Moving Picture World (October 3, 1914)\n\nBuilding Universal City\n\nGreat Enterprise of the Universal Film Manufacturing Company in California Rapidly Taking Form.\n\nThe Universal’s long heralded city, the aim for two years of Carl Laemmle and his associates, is rapidly becoming a concrete reality. In the new site in the San Bernardino Valley [sic] there is rapidly rising a city capable of accommodating 15,000 souls, built for the express purpose of making motion pictures, the first city of its kind ever constructed by the hand of man.\n\nThis city has one peculiarity which marks it out from every other municipality. It is a chameleon, or a changeable city. When the plans for it were made the architects, landscape artists, engineers and directors were told to keep this one idea uppermost: the greatest usefulness with the least amount of construction. For that reason every building which has been put up or which is planned is designed to have a four or five fold usefulness. Every facade of every building is of a different type of architecture and usually represents a different kind of usefulness. For instance, a building designed primarily for a saddlery shop and a blacksmithy has one front elevation which looks like this kind of a building. From the other three angles it has the appearance of a Gothic hunting lodge, military barracks and a Wild West ranch. In addition to this any one of these front elevations can be changed in thirty-six hours to represent an entirely different kind and character of building.\n\nThis idea has been carried out throughout the entire city and landscapes have been treated in the same way–that is, viewed from one side they present a certain aspect; from the opposite direction the character, climatic or sectional, is of an entirely different sort. This will enable a director who under ordinary circumstances would have a certain number of good locations in such an extremely favored site as Universal City to construct from ten to twenty more scenes with the same locations, which can be changed under the skillful guidance of the general manager.\n\nThere is work and work galore in Universal City before it will begin to represent the elaborate and crafty plans of Mr. Laemmle and his lieutenants. In the first place after the plans of the city had been made the different streets had to be paved, and it was all done with asphalt and macadam. Every stream and gully had to be spanned by a bridge or viaduct and here comes the first intimation of how changeable the complexion of the city can be. Every bridge is so constructed that it can take on the aspect of a Japanese arch bridge, a Roman stone paved bridge or a steel cantilever bridge, or in fact any other kind of a bridge for which a director has need in the production of a scenario.\n\nAll of the streets had to be scientifically paved and piped for gas, electricity and sewer mains. The main boulevard of the city is six miles long and this taken in conjunction with other main streets and cross streets will give the reader an idea of the amount of work which the Street Department alone had to do. The piping for water alone was an important item, for every building is so equipped, and the city itself is probably supplied with the best water which can be obtained in California. Its reservoir is fed by seven artesian wells which give water 99 per cent. pure at the rate of 300,000 gallons per day. The roadways of the city are peculiar in that they are made in different widths and the styles of top dressing so that there will be as great a variety in this respect for the director to choose from as possible.\n\nThe zoo, which will be housed in especially constructed buildings and cages, has been taken intact from the ranch and with the additions which have since been made to it it is now the largest and finest privately owned menagery in the world today.\n\nThe administration building will cost $30,000 and its four facades are all different, representing different styles of architecture and apparently different exteriors. The laboratory which is being built has also the same peculiarity of exterior appearance and will cost $25,000. An exhibition theater which takes on either the appearance of a city or a country theater at the behest of a director will cost the company just exactly $8,000. There are barracks for the housing of the Universal’s troop of expert cavalryment and a bunk house for the cowboys. All of these are modern, clean, sanitary and wholesome and beside this they can be used for many other things from the moving picture standpoint.\n\nOne of the most picturesque spots in the city is the Indian village, which is the largest in America and is inhabited by a tribe of redmen who are encouraged to pursue their life and adorn themselves as grotesquely as possible.\n\nThe wonderful revolving stage is one of the most up-to-date features of this city. The location of the stage has been chosen with a view to vistas which can be seen through the windows.\n\nThe wardrobe department is a building standing alone and occupies a floor space of 50 x 100 feet. It contains a wardrobe of every conceivable sort which is valued in the rough at about $35,000. In addition to this the costume shops which are nearby are so arranged that they [can work] to turn out the designs which are required by every [period] dress from the era of palm leaf girdles to the present [?]. [The] costume shops contain twenty electrically operated weaving machines and the work is supervised by one of the best known costume designers obtainable, who is able to outfit a picture in the proper costumes demanded by any age.\n\nThere are two hospitals and infirmaries thoroughly equipped with every medical equipment for surgical and pathological remedy and these are under the direction of the two Universal physicians, Doctors Lloyd Mace and F. Lamberson, assisted by a corps of trained nurses. Treatment in these hospitals is also defrayed by the Universal.\n\nThe first notable incident of the mobility of the new city was shown in the preparation of a thrilling scene for “Trey of Hearts.” The director knew of just the proper location for a fire and for a daring rescue by means of a rope acting as a pendulum, but sad to relate this scene is in Jersey City, N. J., and that was three thousand miles away. It was out of the question to take a company that distance in order to stage this one scene, and even then the city fathers of the city on the heights would not have consented to the total destruction of one of their office buildings even for the edification of ten million moving picture fans, who are following the destinies of this stirring serial drama. The only thing to do was to reconstruct the scene from buildings already standing and this was done in three days, and the result was so perfect that New Yorkers who gazed upon it in wonder were compelled to pinch themselves before they could realize that they were in California and not New Jersey, but the scene was speedily burnt to the ground and this newest of cities, the Chamelon, once more resumed its work-a-day color.\n\n[From Jerry’s Movie Locations]\n\nFrom The Moving Picture World (date unknown)\n\nImprovements at the monster motion picture plant of the Universal company at Oak Crest in the San Fernando valley are going forward rapidly. There are now four big stages completed besides a Western town which has been built for the double purposes of backgrounds and utilitarian use. The fixed population at Oak Crest, including the Indians now numbers about 300. The company has about 20,000 acres of land with a sure enough mountain range on the ranch and by the first of the year will have the largest motion picture plant in the world.\n\n[The Moving Picture World, from Jerry’s Movie Locations]\n\nFrom The Moving Picture World (date unknown)\n\nUNIVERSAL CITY MOVES.\n\nBig Undertaking Conducted Rapidly by Large Force of Employees\n\nMany Improvements in Big Plant.\n\nThe work of removing Universal City from its temporary location a few miles outside of Hollywood, California, [Providencia Ranch] to its permanent site on the new ranch, purchased by the company for that purpose is going forward with a rush. Under the direction of Wallace Kerrigan, buildings that have long seen service in the production of the famous Universal dramas and western comedies, are being razed to the ground, loaded upon big auto trucks and flat-topped wagons and hauled over two miles of mountain roads to the new ranch.\n\nThe first part of the original city to be moved to the new site was the Zoo, and the day of its removal was one of intense excitement to everyone about the ranch, particularly to Mr. Kerrigan and to James Barnes, the head animal trainer for the Universal Company. Lions and tigers, leopards and coyotes, bears and wolves, together with the hundred odd animals that go to make up the menagerie were loaded cages and all, upon the trucks and driven growling and roaring along the canyon road to the New City. The roads are rough and rutted and for the most part built “on end,” and a dozen times as the wagons lurched and twisted this way and that, the danger of overturning the wagons or of tipping off the cages was imminent.\n\nAs for the construction of the New City, itself, only by actual observation can any time be gained as to the speed with which it is going up. Already the new cages and pens for the animals have been partitioned off for the thoroughbred English saddle-stock, corrals strung for the heavier draft animals and hay barns stand finished and partly filled with bales. The foundations for fully one-half of the buildings have been started and the frameworks for the greater part of these are already being raised, while several of the buildings stand completed and ready for occupancy. William Horsley has charge of this work.\n\nAmong these is the quarters for the Universal crack cavalry troop. It consists of a long, well-lighted living room and equally large, light bunk room, concrete floored baths and lavatories and everything that Manager Bernstein of the Hollywood Studios, could think of to add to their comfort. Electricity is used for lighting, and running water has been piped in from a clear, cold spring in a neighboring canyon. Needless to say the boys are overjoyed and are waiting anxiously for the orders to move in.\n\nA quarter of a mile of concrete side walks has been laid and many times that amount soon will be in. A temporary cook house has been erected to serve until the permanent dining room has been completed.\n\nThe old original Universal City will soon be a thing of the past, but, like the Phoenix of old, up from the ashes is arising the head of a newer and better Universal city, destined to be the western home of the leader of film manufacturing companies. [The Moving Picture World]\n\n1915\n\nWhen Laemmle learned the new facilities would not be ready by February, the official opening date was moved to March 15,1915. The delay allowed the two public relations events, the Great Train Ride from the east coast and a Beauty Contest Parade entering the main gates on March 15, 1915.\n\nThe Oak Crest Ranch became known as the “Universal Ranch” until it was leased as the Lasky Ranch in 1916, the site today is Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)\n\nUniversal City had an official opening event on March 15 1915\n\nCarl Laemmle invited members of the public to watch films being made (in exchange for a 25 cents admission fee). A chicken lunch box was also available for a nickel; the first step towards the Universal Studios theme park we know today!\n\n1922\n\nExtensive outdoor construction on the backlot for Von Stroheim’s ‘Foolish Wives’\n\n1924\n\nMCA (Music Corporation of America) is formed, as a booking agency for bands. Founder Dr Jules Stein and President Lew Wasserman would have a large part to play in the future of Universal in the 1950s.\n\nJuly – Construction starts on Stage 28 for The Phantom of the Opera\n\n1928\n\nStage 12 is constructed, for the innovative musical “Broadway” – brand new methods were created for moving the heavy early cameras, and this was the first movie to be lit entirely with tungsten lamps, allowing a lot more control and more subtle lighting.\n\n1930\n\nFollowing the advent of “talkies” around 1930 the studio had reluctantly to close the doors to paying visitors as the stages were not sufficiently soundproofed.\n\n1935\n\nAs studio earnings were lower than expected, Carl Laemmle had to take out a loan of $750,000 to keep the studio afloat as Showboat (1936) was due to start production shortly. He agreed to a gamble – if he didn’t repay the loan on time, the investment company Standard Capital could buy Universal for a flat $5.5m. Unfortunately, he lost the gamble.\n\n1936\n\nUniversal Pictures bought by Standard Capital. The studio is renamed ‘New Universal Studios’.\n\nShowboat is released less than 2 months after Standard Capital takes control, and is a big box-office success. The Laemmle family can only watch from the sidelines.\n\n1939\n\nCarl Laemmle dies on 24 September, age 72, having lost the studio he built from scratch.\n\n1946\n\nUniversal merges with International Pictures to become Universal International\n\n1952\n\nDecca Records becomes the new owner of Universal.\n\n1956\n\nGray Line Bus Tours have Universal International Studios part of their Hollywood tour, along with movie star homes and other Hollywood landmarks such as Will Rogers home and Disney Studios. The bus travelled around the backlot, seeing Colonial Street, Courthouse Square, the Tower of London set, western streets, and learning about the use of facades etc. Although there were no ‘attractions’ on the tour, visitors appreciated the variety of different locations that had been built on the backlot.\n\n1957\n\n$500,000 fire destroys the New York Street backlot sets.\n\n1959\n\nMCA buys the Universal lot, mainly to enable them to make TV programmes using the backlot and studio facilities.\n\nConstruction starts on Stage 1.\n\n1960\n\nSpartacus, directed by Stanley Kubrick, makes extensive use of the backlot and studio facilities.\n\n1961\n\nStart of Tram Tours. The studio commissary (staff restaurant) was in need of a business boost. Albert Dorskind (1922-2004) was the president of MCA at the time, and realised he could increase studio income by inviting tour buses to drive through the lot and stop off at the commissary during quiet periods. His first contract was with Gray Line Tour buses, but it soon became clear that the most lucrative move would be to run the tours themselves.\n\nThe Jack Benny Show moved into the newly opened Stage 1.\n\n1962\n\n1962 to 1964: Revue Studios Tour – conducted by Tanner Gray Line Motor Tours, “Dine with the stars” and a bus excursions on the backlot.\n\nMCA acquires Decca and also Universal Pictures and leaves the talent agency business behind.\n\nTo Kill A Mockingbird is released, having shot entirely on the backlot.\n\nUniversal City Plaza Project – this large building project around the front lot consists of the MCA Tower (see below), the Commissary, a bank, a post office and production offices.\n\n1963\n\nJuly 9: The MCA Tower (“Black Tower”) on the Front Lot is dedicated. The ceremony is commemorated by the production of “Golden Rivets”.\n\n1964\n\nFebruary 4 1964\n\nA program to build additional stages and to upgrade electrical equipment is launched.\n\nFrom the Valley Times February 4 1964\n\nSet for immediate construction are four new sound stages; a new transportation center; a new industrial crafts center; new editorial, wardrobe, make-up and hairdressing buildings and an electrical conversion plant.\n\nCompletion of the four stages, which will be ready for use by August, will give Universal a total of 36 stages, thus making it the largest studio in the world, not only in area – 408 acres – but also in the number and size of its’ sound stages.\n\nThe present 32 stages range in size from 149 x 200 feet to 60 x 70 feet. The new stages will be 100 x 140 feet in area.\n\nThe new stages will be constructed on a site adjacent to the sites’ oldest stage, known as the Phantom Stage because it was built for Lon Chaney’s “Phantom of the Opera” in 1924.\n\nThe studio’s electrical conversion plant has been redesigned and work will begin shortly on the installation of new equipment that will give the studio an output of 3,000 kilowatts, or 3,000,000 watts.\n\nOn the drawing boards are plans for a second power plant that will eventually give the studio a power output of 40,000 kilowatts, enough to completely service a town of 10,000 population.\n\nThis new building activity is in addition to the current ahead of schedule work now being done on Universal City Plaza, a five building complex.\n\nOf these, the commissary and bank and production building will be completed by June; the U.S. Post Office shortly thereafter, and the 14-story tower will be ready for October occupancy.\n\nUniversal Studios Hollywood officially created. Albert Dorskind (see above) persuades MCA Chairman Lew Wasserman to invest $4 million in designing trams and building food courts, parking lots and restrooms.\n\nFrom LA Times July 19 1964\n\nIn operation since July 15 are the first two trams, each of which cost Universal $30,000. There is a full-time staff of 20 – plus, of course, the incidental personnel of the studio. The present tour – conducted, naturally, at a financial loss – is considered a dry run, although refreshments are available along the route. ) The expectation for 1965 is of a dozen trams departing profitably at three- or five-minute intervals with as many as 500,000 passengers a year.\n\nJuly 15 1964, the Universal Studios Tour begins featuring newly created pink and white-striped GlamorTrams. Along with the studio commissary, there was also the following on the menu (served from the commissary basement)\n\nAn exhibition of designs by celebrated movie costume designer Edith Head.\n\nA brief make-up demonstration (show production by Bud Westmore)\n\nA push-button monster\n\nA walk through Doris Day’s dressing room (not in the commissary basement!)\n\nA Western shootout performance by two stunt men (this wasn’t in the commissary basement either).\n\nThe total staff dedicated to this part of the studio operation was one ticket seller, two guides and two tram drivers. Admission was $2.50 for adults and $1.50 for children.\n\nFrom this point, the evolution was gradual, but steady.\n\n1965\n\nMarch 28: Universal City Schoolhouse on the Universal frontlot is demolished. Young stars such as Ann Blyth, Donald O’Connor, Deanna Dean had classes there.\n\nVisitor’s Entertainment Center built at a cost of $5 million “where special effects are illustrated along the movie streets of the world”.\n\nThe visitor entrance to the Universal Studios Tour was moved from Lankershim to the upper lot. Various photo opportunities were added to the tour.\n\nThe Stunt Show is performed in the Action Arena.\n\n1967\n\nMay 15: $1million fire destroys a large portion of the backlot sets.\n\nThe Universal Tour Entertainment Center (Upper Lot) is opened for the start of the Studio Tram Tour, with the Stunt Show now sharing the Action Arena with an early incarnation of the Animal Actors show.\n\nMa and Pa Kettle Farm is opened to show off animal actors (date is approximate)\n\n1968\n\nFlash Flood set added to the Studio Tour.\n\n1969\n\nThe Sheraton Universal Hotel opened to accommodate guests in Universal City.\n\nUniversal Amphitheater under construction.\n\n1970\n\nAnimal Actors Training Stage appears on the Upper Lot.\n\nAdam 12 ‘Stage 70’ attraction opens and the stunt show moves to the newly constructed Universal Amphitheater.\n\n1971\n\nTorpedo Attack / Submarine set added to the Studio Tour.\n\nDirty Harry shot on New York Street\n\n1972\n\nThe outdoor Universal Amphitheater becomes a rock concert venue as the park expands across the hills overlooking the backlot. The Amphitheater is the venue for the Stunt Show during the day, and on summer evenings it’s a high-specification concert venue.\n\n1973\n\nThe parting of the Red Sea becomes a feature of the Universal Studios Tour.\n\nThe Burning House sets the Studio Tour “aflame” for the first time.\n\nThe Universal Amphitheater expands to 5200 seats to accommodate rapidly rising concert attendances.\n\n1974\n\nRockslide added to the Studio Tour, on the hillside currently supporting the rear of the Simpsons Ride building.\n\nCollapsing Bridge added to the Studio Tour.\n\nEarthquake shot on soundstages and New York Street sets\n\n1975\n\nAugust: The “Land of 1000 Faces Make-Up Show” is premiered in an open-air auditorium on the future site of the Castle Theatre.\n\nTreacherous Quicksand Pit becomes a feature of the Stunt Show.\n\nThe Runaway Train becomes a feature of the Universal Studios Tour.\n\nThe Ice Tunnel added to the Studio Tour, inspired by the Clint Eastwood movie The Eiger Sanction.
