        "text": "The Reporter-Herald is running a three-part series on the homeless situation in Loveland around the King’s Crossing Natural Area. All three stories will be posted at reporterherald.com and will appear in print May 13-15. Friday: Part 1 looks at the people living in encampments. Saturday: Part 2 looks at the effects on the surrounding neighborhoods and businesses. Sunday: Part 3 looks at the situation from the city of Loveland’s perspective.\n\nLiving on quicksand. This is how Melody Cacho, one of the many homeless people who has found residence at King’s Crossing in Loveland, describes what it is like to be without a home, having to constantly pick up and move your living space.\n\n“It’s hard to build a foundation on quicksand,” she said.\n\nAn increased population of people camping at the King’s Crossing Natural Area in south-central Loveland has caused many in the community — from residents to business owners and even city councilors — to call for their removal in some way, ultimately launching a wider discussion on homelessness throughout the city. According to a presentation given at Loveland City Council May 3, there are 26 camps at King’s Crossing with another 15 recorded on other public lands.\n\nBut for those camping at King’s Crossing, the anger and resentment they feel directed at them is just adding to a list of past traumas that they have endured.\n\nAt the same time, those who support homeless residents say the problem is deeper and more complex than just throwing people out of town.\n\nAlison Hade, Loveland’s community partnership administrator, said she believes the number of homeless people that are being noticed is due both in part to an increase of people moving to Loveland as well as a heightened visibility for those who were already living here.\n\n“As the community grows so will the population of people who lose their housing,” she said. “In any city in the United States as the population grows so will the people who are unhoused. And Loveland is growing.”\n\nShe added that many also find Loveland a safer place to stay as the city lacks an outdoor camping ban despite talks by City Council to enact one; Fort Collins, for example, has it written in municipal code that camping on public property within the city without a permit is unlawful.\n\nWhile Hade acknowledged that there are some in the homeless community who landed there because of criminal activity that they still continue, there are many that have landed on the streets because of a number of traumatic life events, ranging from child abuse and child sexual assault, physical or mental illness, loss of family and more. She added there are even those who do have a criminal past who have pulled themselves away from it.\n\nThoughts and experiences from King’s Crossing homeless residents\n\nPauly Chavez has been living at King’s Crossing for the last seven months. He said that following a car accident in which he broke his ankle and hyperextended his leg, he lost everything, going from living in a house with a job and a car to sleeping in a tent. Even all these months after the incident, Chavez said he is working his hardest to get a job and a place to live.\n\n“When I come out I (will) come out with a vengeance,” he said, a large smile painted across his face.\n\nYet, while living at King’s Crossing, he said, many people driving by along Lincoln Avenue have screamed hateful words at him.\n\n“They’re treating us like we are bottom of the barrel scum,” he said.\n\nHe added that while he was depressed when he first landed in King’s Crossing, the people around him in the area have helped lift him up, even giving him the nickname Smiley.\n\nCacho said that prior to becoming homeless, she raised a family that has now made her a grandma. She said after packing her stuff up in a bag and moving back to Oregon many years ago, she eventually bounced around to different states for a while. She said she ended up in Loveland to be close to her new grandson, who has since moved to North Dakota.\n\nNow, she said, she is homeless by choice.\n\nShe said while there are people in the encampment that have caused trouble both for those staying there and for surrounding businesses, that does not mean they are all problematic.\n\n“The businesses complain they get stuff stolen, we get stuff stolen,” she said. “Our hands are tied just like theirs are.”\n\nShe added that there are so many people living out there, like herself, suffering from past trauma that most people couldn’t even imagine; this is exacerbated, she said, when the community treats them so poorly. She said that, while she was homeless, she was once strangled and had to be revived by paramedics.\n\n“It’s really hard to get up and motivate yourself when you feel like a whipped dog,” Cacho said.\n\nHow to address the needs and wants of those experiencing homelessness\n\nWhile many have loudly called for the removal of homeless people camping in the King’s Crossing area, those leading support systems have said that the problem is more complex than just making people leave and will require working to implement the systems and solutions to help those in need transition out of homelessness.\n\nHade said the conversations that the city has had over the years when it comes to homelessness makes it seem as if there is an abundance of services for those experiencing homelessness.\n\n“The truth is we don’t,” she said. “We don’t have robust services; in fact we barely have services.”\n\nThe city does not have an overnight shelter, except during extremely cold weather. And while 137 Connection offers the homeless a place to shower, get mail and more, Hade said the day center has historically been open only 20 hours a week or by appointment.\n\n“This is a byproduct of us not having a system in place to address this,” said Sandra Wright, Loveland’s homeless systems project manager for Homeward Alliance.\n\nTo help transition people out of homelessness, Hade said, Loveland needs both a dedicated overnight shelter as well as a larger day center that is open longer, allowing those who are homeless to shower, receive mail and connect with jobs.\n\nWright added that shelter is expected to be a short-term solution, and the community also needs a system to offer supports to make being homeless short-lived and non-recurring; part of this, she said, includes case management to work specifically with the needs of individuals.\n\nThe next vital piece of the puzzle, Hade said, is a well-developed street outreach program to help get in contact with people who are experiencing homelessness and get them in touch with ways to get out of it, be that job resources, shelter, food and more.\n\nBev Arellano, shelter resource navigator with Homeward Alliance is one of the people currently performing outreach for Loveland’s homeless. During a trip out to King’s Crossing on Wednesday afternoon, she said a lot of the work she has done has been to help people in the area with a number of different things, including ensuring they have identification documents, connecting them with needed resources and just gaining their trust.\n\nShe said this work can have a deep impact in really helping people transition out of homelessness, as it builds that trust which can be transferred to others and, hopefully, bring people to needed services.\n\n“It’s great,” Arellano said. “We get to give them things they need.”\n\n“That is the service that connects people who are living in tents to what I consider mainstream services to get them on the path to developing a trusting relationship that is necessary to make a transition into housing,” Hade said of street outreach.\n\nWright said that those experiencing homelessness are already in our community, and if systems and solutions are not addressed the situation will continue.\n\nWhere we go from here\n\nDespite the anger from many in the community towards the encampment, Hade and Wright said it is important for the public to remember that those experiencing homelessness are people.\n\n“What is missing from the conversation is information about what was it that happened to someone that led them to homelessness,” she said. “Instead it has been replaced with people are unwilling to be housed.”\n\nWright said it is unfair to generalize all people in any group, including those experiencing homelessness. She said that to help those out of homelessness, solutions and systems need to be put in place to truly assist them.\n\nChavez said, for those like himself who are trying hard to transition out of homelessness, the best way to help is by having the city work with the homeless community to meet their specific needs.\n\n“Figure out ways to help us,” he said.\n\nChavez added he is also deeply appreciative for all the people who have offered food and help.\n\n“It’s beautiful because that means people have heart,” he said.\n\nCacho said for people like her who want to keep living outdoors, she thinks there should be some sort of compromise to allow for people to live outside in a designated area if they so choose.\n\nShe added there are many in the King’s Crossing area who are talented in one field or another, and she hopes there can someday be a way for those people to be recognized.\n\n“Let us do something with our lives,” she said. “It may be unconventional but we are self-sufficient.”\n\nAs the city and the community search for a solution, Wright said doing nothing without consideration for human beings is not an option.\n\n“We are talking about human life,” she said. “If you say you respect human life you have to respect all of it. Those that are experiencing homelessness deserve the same compassion and dignity that we all expect for ourselves.”\n\nAnd despite frustrations from the community and uncertainty about how the encampment will be impacted by any city decisions, Cacho said the people living in King’s Crossing are going to keep doing what they have been doing: take care of each other and hold onto the bonds of friendship they have made.\n\n“We are family,” she said. “We are part of the Loveland community.”"
