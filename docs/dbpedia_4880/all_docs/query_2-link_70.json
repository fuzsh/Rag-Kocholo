        "text": "Exciting opportunity to design and implement innovations within the public health system in India working closely with the Government. Quicksand is looking for consultants with the following expertise over the next 3-4 months (starting now until May 2023): - Project Management to steer a suite of interventions working closely with the Ministry, local health facilities and diverse set of partners & collaborators - Product Management to architect a digital intervention - Brand Strategist to conceptualise a communications campaign - Visual communications agency to handle a variety of design outputs including identity, print & film That almost sounds like starting a small design studio :) But the mandate is big and we need immediate help. You will be supporting a team at Quicksand that is anchoring all of the above. DM me if you are interested and up for a challenge! Only people willing to commit time and take responsibility to see this through the finish line over the next 3-4 months may apply. Travel to Delhi would be frequent. #behavioraldesign #humancentereddesign #publichealth\n\nSchools in India have been closed for almost 18 months now. More than 100 Million children attending government schools have had little to no learning. Motivated by our Theme of the Year \"Rebuild Together\", we developed a virtual program - using Football, Music and Lego!! - and worked with more than 5,000 kids to instill a sense of positivity and hope, and the resilience to come out of this stronger an determined to become the Leaders of Tomorrow! This video is a great testament to the commitment of our teachers, the children, their parents and the communities around them! #leaders #learning #schools #teachers #football #music\n\nI had no intention of doing this over here. But Uber has forced me to come here with zero response. I have been chasing their so-called third party insurance company Paramount Health Services(TPA) Pvt. Ltd., for the last three months for my insurance claim. Kavita Shetty Paresh PathareRoshni Ganjawala Background: My uber met with an accident on 12th August 2021 at 6:05 am in Bandra, Mumbai. 𝐌𝐲 𝐝𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐬𝐥𝐞𝐩𝐭 𝐨𝐟𝐟 𝐰𝐡𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐝𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐚𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐚 𝐛𝐫𝐢𝐝𝐠𝐞. My jaw is still recovering, and my neck sustained a nasty jerk which now gives me trouble while working long hours, which was never the case. Uber called the next day, saying we would take care of everything. Would you please send us your bills and original scan report? I did that, after which I received claim number 𝟐𝟔𝟒𝟐𝟖𝟎𝟒, and there has been zero response since then. Every time I call, the person tells me he will call me back. I tweeted about it quite a few times but got the same response in the attached images from uber too. My colleagues and my friends even supported me, but Uber chose to remain quiet. I would have let this pass, honestly, if the hospital bills were not huge. Unfortunately, I am not like Uber Ceo Dara Khosrowshahi."
