        "text": "This past week I’ve been listening to a lot of different bands and what better place to share some of my favorite songs and or albums I’ve been blasting all week! Some you might have heard before and some might be brand new but, the best thing about this is that there is something for everyone here! As always, I’m interested in what you dig out of these, so let me know!\n\n01) Botch: Ever since it was announced that Botch had reunited for a secret show as well as a few Seattle area shows and now a tour, you bet your ass I’ve been on a Botch tear. So here you have both of their studio albums, American Nervoso and We Are The Romans plus their new song, One Twenty Two, that is undeniably BOTCH! So Stoked that Botch are back! They are seriously one of the pioneers of this genre and are coming back at one hell of a much needed time! Welcome back gents!!\n\nBotch- One Twenty Two:\n\nBotch- American Nervoso:\n\nBotch- We Are The Romans:\n\n02) Alphamega- A World Afraid Of Tomorrow: This is a new track from Alphamega. I dig on this band. I love their melodic sense into the heavy. Their sound is a combination of early 00’s metalcore and swedish melodeath (early In Flames/Soilwork). This song shows even more growth of the band as songwriters and singer Adam Ryan shines pretty damn bright on this one! Alphamega is playing THIS SUNDAY at The Whisky with Centershift, Daybreak Ends, Stronger Than Machines and Our Dying World!\n\n03) Depeche Mode- Ghosts Again: I love Depeche Mode! And this new song off their upcoming album Memento Mori, is very classic sounding (Black Celebration vibes I’m getting). This is the bands last album to feature the late Andy Fletcher. The video for the song was directed by long time collaborator Anton Corbijn and it definitely strikes a chord with the song. Looking forward to their upcoming tour as well!!\n\n04) Common Wounds- Phantom Limb: I was recently introduced to the band Common Wounds and the moment I heard this track, I knew it was right up my alley. This band is part post-hardcore, part noise-rock and full on crushing. Their self titled EP comes out March 10th and it’s awesome (I might have already heard it and have blasted the ever living shit out of it… I DID)! Shout out to the drummer for the Ghost Idols shirt too! Really digging on this band and if you are into this genre of music, you will be too!\n\n05) The Smile- A Light For Attracting Attention: This band is made up of Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead as well as drummer Tom Skinner. As much as I want a new Radiohead album, this will keep me occupied for some time. This album is really quite cool. It’s jazzy with interesting synth parts and a really cool mix of all the 90’s alternative rock that I love. It’s also one of those albums that is great for a relaxing evening or just hanging out with people. It’s not a “rock record” instead it’s more of a “vibe album” that the more you listen to it, the more you find different nuances and things to enjoy. Looking up live performances of The Smile is a treat too as they definitely take the songs to another level live! Hope they make the rounds again soon, as I am really wanting to see them live!\n\n06) Thrice- The Artist In The Ambulance (REVISITED): I still remember when this album first came out and how much I was into it. It was one of those albums that I didn’t put away for a long long time. Now, 20 years later, Thrice took a chance and revisited this gem of an album and the end result is pretty damn fantastic. The album sounds a little more mature in a good way and feels like it revitalized the band a bit too. With minimal structure changes and a few special guests, this album sounds bigger and at times depending on the song, more impactful. Personally, I’d love to see more bands take on a challenge like this as I suggested in a recent article about Incubus revisiting SCIENCE. Way to go Thrice! This is superb!\n\n07) Quicksand- Slip: The landmark and highly influential album just turned 30 years old! And to this day it still sounds fresh and amazing. Not only is this a classic and has given birth to so many bands but, Quicksand is still out there killing it. Their most recent album, Distant Populations is one of the best album in the last few years. Slip is one of those albums though that when you put it on, you don’t want it to end. It’s full of banger song after banger song! If you’ve never heard this album, now is your chance! And when you do, make sure you play it LOUD!\n\n08) How To Destroy Angels- Welcome Oblivion: My daughter is in love with this album and I couldn’t be more happy about it. She also loves Nine Inch Nails (which she had no choice but to love- if you know me, you know this would be inevitable). When I first heard How To Destroy Angels it took me a minute to get used to not hearing Trent Reznor singing but, I had seen West Indian Girl live before and was familiar with Mariqueen’s voice and it didn’t take me long to love it too. The more I listen to this album with my kid now, the more I love what it is and about. There’s a bit of a dynamic shift to the structure of songs and I’d even say there’s a bit of a psychedelic vibe to some of it which gives the eerie and haunting sounds more attitude. The live shows for How To Destroy Angels were on a whole other visual and sonic level. I highly recommend taking some time to watch some of those!\n\n09) Full Of Hell & Primitive Man- Tunnels To God: One of my favorite things that I’ve mentioned a zillion times before is when I get emails about new music and I click on it and it absolutely kicks ass. The other day, I clicked on this song at the sight of who it was and when it kicked in, HOLY SHIT! It’s brutal yet ambient and will get under your skin and crawl giving you chills. It’s also epic in length which makes those chills last even longer!\n\n10) The Cult- Under The Midnight Sun: The Cult need no introduction. They have been gems in the rock world for well over 40 years. Their catalog speaks for itself and the fact that they keep putting out quality albums makes it even better. Their most recent album, Under The Midnight Sun is one hell of an album. It’s got parts of all eras of the band to give it a different kind of light. At one moment you are listening to a part that you might have heard during Love and then the next you are listening to something that could have been off Choice Of Weapon. The album is diverse and a great listen. I love putting this album on at the end of a long day/night or a drive home and just let it take me places. Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy are two of the most underrated songwriters out there! This is another example of how great they are together!\n\nA couple weeks back I made a very bold statement that, “2021 is the year of Quicksand” and last night cemented that for me. I’ve long wanted to see Quicksand live since I first heard Slip way back when and now, that wish came true. Seeing Walter Schreifels, Sergio Vega, Alan Cage rock out was superb and the icing on the cake of them having Cave In/Mutoid Man/etc guitarist/vocalist Stephen Brodsky as their second guitarist just made it all something spectacular.\n\nThe moment the lights went down and the projections on the backdrop started, the frenzy of the crowd began to rev up and the second the first note of “Inversion” from their new and absolutely killer album, Distant Populations started, everyone knew, it was ON!!!. Plowing down the audience with the four songs off their new album immediately was tremendous. Just when you thought they were going to play the whole album (which they did) they burst into “Fazer” and there was no looking back. The setlist for the night was so good. Playing all of Distant Populations along with choice cuts from Slip, Manic Compression and Interiors, Quicksand could do no wrong. They even did a wonderful job covering My Bloody Valentine’s “Don’t Ask Why” and now I want to just listen to their version from now on. Hearing songs like the ones above along with “Colossus,” “Thorn In My Side,” “Dine Alone,” “Brown Gargantuan,” “Phase 90,” “Unfulfilled” and so many more was like being on cloud 9. There was no chance I could stand still. It’s a good thing I haven’t cut my hair in a while so I could head bang along like a crazy person. Watching Quicksand live is something everyone in a band should do. They had so much energy emitting from the stage it was contagious. You could tell these guys really enjoy playing. The chemistry of the four guys on stage was astounding. You can tell that Walter, Sergio and Alan are a tight unit. They play off each other so well. Adding Stephen Brodsky to the touring lineup was a perfect idea. His playing style and abilities really fit great in Quicksand. His mannerisms on stage too are so good. I really wish he could be a permanent member of Quicksand. I can only imagine how awesome the next album would be if he were a part of it.\n\nAlso playing this evening was Narrow Head and Creeps. Both bands had a very 90’s driven style with the latter sounding a bit more like Brand New. Both bands had solidly good sets and brought a lot of energy. The audience showed up early and that seemed to have a feeling that harked back to the days when people would show up to support all the bands on the bill. It’s always a nice thing to see bands like Quicksand bring out younger/up and coming bands on tour. It’s great to give them the opportunity to get their music out to as many people as possible.\n\nQuicksand is the type of band that influences and inspires anyone that listens. Personally, I couldn’t even wind down when I got home from the show. That’s how good it was. Quicksand is a band that is essential listening and should be in your collection. I can’t wait for the next time Quicksand comes through Los Angeles. What a great show.\n\nQuicksand Set List:\n\n01) Inversion\n\n02) Lightning Field\n\n03) Colossus\n\n04) Missle Command\n\n05) Fazer\n\n06) Thorn In My Side\n\n07) Phase 90\n\n08) Head To Wall\n\n09) Don’t Ask Why (My Bloody Valentine Cover)\n\n10) Under The Screw\n\n11) Unfulfilled\n\n12) Too Official\n\n13) Illuminant\n\n14) Warm And Low\n\n15) The Philosopher\n\n16) Compacted Infinity\n\n17) Rodan\n\n18) Omission\n\n19) Brown Gargantuan\n\n20) Katakana\n\n21) Delusional\n\n22) Dine Alone\n\n23) Brushed\n\nReview By: Brian Lacy\n\nQuicksand- Distant Populations:\n\nQuicksand have been one of the most underrated bands out there for so many years. Their 90’s output of the albums Slip and Manic Compression have become staples for bands and their inspiration/influences. The sound and style that Quicksand created has been often copied as well. A couple years back, Quicksand released their first new album in many years with Interiors. That album was an interesting look into where the band was at that point after being away for some time. Now though, Quicksand is roaring back with their new album, Distant Populations. This might very well be the best Quicksand has ever sounded too.\n\nThe moment the album starts you are totally pulled in. There isn’t a song on this album that feels out of place. The flow of the songs on the album is perfect. The moment the album ends, you immediately want to start it over. That’s how good this is. There isn’t a song on here that you will skip. Songs like “Inversion,” “Colossus,” “Phase 90,” “Missle Command,” and “The Philosopher” have been my favorite tracks so far. This album packs some of the best songs Quicksand have ever written. Sonically, dynamically, lyrically, Distant Populations is a beast of an album. This album is 11 songs of unrelenting pounding rock music. The production by Will Yip (Nothing, Circa Survive) is top notch. He really nailed the classic tones and gives it enough of an added oomph to really bring these new songs to life. The mix by Josh Wilbur absolutely bangs! This album too, I have to say, is the follow up to Manic Compression we’ve been waiting for.\n\nLike a fine wine or scotch, Quicksand only gets better with age. The songs from their past are gems and the songs they have released now are just as good. There is also a maturity to this album that shines bright. The songs on this, like the others are deeply introspective and current. The lyrics on the album as explained by frontman Walter Schreifels said, “Everyone is, on the one hand, so connected with each other, and on the other hand, is so far apart. We’re checking out each other’s social media and we know what everybody’s doing. But when we’re sitting in the same room together, we’re looking at our phones.” The societal impact of how we live our lives topped off with the pandemic sure made for some great material. Quicksand have made an impact over the years but, with Distant Populations, they have truly cemented their place!\n\nOverall Rating: A\n\nQuicksand- Distant Populations:"
