        "text": "Today we are featuring Grant Aleksander, a US actor whose brimming talent has led to nominations for three Daytime Emmy Awards and seven Soap Opera Digest Awards, one of which he won in 1999.\n\nGrant has garnered critical acclaim, especially for his leading role as Phillip Spaulding for three decades in the daytime television drama “Guiding Light.” The well-known series is credited by the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest running soap opera in television history.\n\nIn addition to being among the finest actors, Grant is also a spiritual person who cherishes the lives of all beings.\n\nGrant Aleksander was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1959. Throughout his illustrious career spanning three decades, he has acted in such diverse productions as “The Crucible” and “The Glass Menagerie,” as well as in title roles for both “Manson” and “Hamlet.” He has been seen on stage in Baltimore for “The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie” and “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.” While in Los Angeles, Grant has had guest roles on several primetime television series, including “Hardcastle and McCormick,” “Who’s the Boss?” and “The Fall Guy.”\n\n“For me, it always came down to if I had the choice to kill an animal for food or eat something else instead, I would always eat something else instead. My wish isn’t so much for the four-legged animals, it is more for the two-legged animals – that we find a way to look at ourselves as human beings, as a part of something. Animals have that ability to just love freely and openly, asking nothing in return.”\n\nI’ve spent most of my time as a professional actor working in soap operas or daytime dramas, the longest period on one show, called “Guiding Light” which has recently gone off the air, but was on for spanning six decades. And I worked on another show, “All My Children,” for about three years. If you have a really good story that you tell over a long period of time, that’s usually what hooks people.\n\nAnd “Guiding Light” always had very good actors. They told stories that connected with basic people at very fundamental levels. They told stories that engaged people. We told these stories in real time with very, very well developed characters. And I think that’s why people liked them.\n\nThe versatile actor has also been in a number of films such as the comedy “The Big Bad Swim,” and “Tough Guys” with legendary Hollywood icons Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas.\n\nMaking movies is vastly different from doing most television work. Doing nighttime television is similar to, is shot in the style as film and there’s more time. When you work sort of in the trenches of TV, particularly if you’re doing three-camera video, there’s no time. You get a script in your hand and you learn it overnight and you generally only get one or maybe two takes to get it out. So you have to really make your choices quickly, you have to have a good memory.\n\nWhen you work in TV, you are geared to do your best work right away. Making movies is wonderful from the standpoint that you’ve got this script that someone took a lot of time to craft. So a lot of problems that you’ll find in working in TV at all its levels, you don’t find working on a film.\n\nDespite his successful and busy career, Grant decided to return to school to complete his Masters of Fine Arts. This was motivated by his desire to fulfill a promise to his parents and to be able to teach young actors in the future.\n\nI was at NYU (New York University) and I dropped out because I got an agent and I was starting to get work. I was very, very lucky that whenever I was looking for work, I found work. But my parents were very unhappy that I dropped out in my junior year. I promised them that I would eventually do it, and after our show went off the air, I had the time to be able to get back to it.\n\nSome of my most favorite times working on the soap [operas] were when you would have the newest group of young kids that would come on and you’d stand back and watch them start trying to figure out what was happening. And then you’d blink and all of a sudden they were incredible. And you know, somewhere along that line, you would see them making these little discoveries. And there was just nothing that was more satisfying to me then to be able to pass on something that somebody gave to me when I was a young actor."
