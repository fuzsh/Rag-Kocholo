        "text": "Guiding Light‘s Grant Aleksander, who played the complicated Phillip Spaulding on and off for 25 years, will play another deeply conflicted, complex character, “Adam Clark,” in the upcoming series, Tainted Dreams.\n\nAccording to Sonia Blangiardo, creator of New York Brand Productions first dramedy, Tainted Dreams, “In a bit of art imitating life, Grant has been focusing behind the scenes honing his directing skills, and we are thrilled he has agreed to step back in front of the camera to play the executive producer of Tainted Dreams fictionalized soap ‘Painted Dreams.'”\n\nOn taking on the role of “Adam Clark” in Tainted Dreams, Grant Aleksander chuckled, “With more than 30 years in daytime both in front of and behind the camera, I have experienced many executive producers, and now it will be fun to actually play one.”\n\nTainted Dreams is the brainchild of two-time Emmy-winning producer/director Sonia Blangiardo who is currently serving as Supervising Producer of Prospect Park’s reboot of Agnes Nixon’s iconic soap All My Children. Blangiardo believes, “Sometimes what happens behind the scenes is juicier, funnier and more dramatic than anything on the screen. Tainted Dreams provides a rare look, warts and all, at the realistic interaction of the executives, cast and crew involved in producing a daily scripted drama.”\n\nWhile Grant Aleksander is best known as The Guiding Light’s “Phillip Spaulding,” he also directed episodes of As the World Turns, and in the mid-1990’s he created the memorable role of “Alec McIntyre” on All My Children. Aleksander played the bartender at “Mickey’s Bar” in the 1986 movie Tough Guys, starring Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. In 2006, he appeared in two motion pictures, The Big Bad Swim and the American Civil War film Fields of Freedom. Aleksander was also featured on a variety of episodic television series and made-for-TV movies.\n\nTainted Dreams boasts a unique combination of high profile soap stars, reality stars, sports figures, singers and theater actors. To date, casting announcements for Tainted Dreams include Dina Manzo (Dina’s Party and Real Housewives of New Jersey), Alicia Minshew (All My Children), Kelley Menighan Hensley (As the World Turns), Walt Willey ( All My Children), Marnie Schulenburg (As the World Turns), Michael Lowry (All My Children), Austin Peck (Days of our Lives), Colleen Zenk (As the World Turns), Anthony Wilkinson (My Big Gay Italian Wedding and the new My Big Gay Italian Funeral), Lisa Marie Varon (IMPACT WRESTLING) and Mr. PEC-Tacular Jessie Godderz (IMPACT WRESTLING and Big Brother). Tainted Dreams begins filming in late July.\n\nAre you happy to see Grant return to a new role in front of the camera? Are you looking forward to Tainted Dreams?

From the list of primetime shows or performer categories who are you rooting for to take home the gold in September? Let us know in the the comment section.\n\nDuring the June 10th edition of the Hollywood Reporter Awards Chatter Podcast, former Guiding Light star, Matt Bomer (ex-Ben Reade) revealed the role that got away, and how his exit from the CBS soap opera was precipitated to accommodate his burgeoning movie career, only to have his sexuality wind up costing him the part.\n\nBomer was seemingly set to play the Man of Steel, Superman, in a motion picture version in the early 2000’s, and as he tells it to Scott Feinberg during the podcast, things went awry.\n\n“I went in on a cattle call for Superman, and then it turned into a month-long audition experience where I was auditioning again and again and again, and flying out to New York and doing chemistry reads, an flying out to LA doing chemistry reads, flying back to New York, flying back to LA to do a screen-test,” recalled Bomer. “And it looked like I was the director’s choice for the role. This is a very early iteration of Superman, written by JJ Abrams called Superman Flyby and it never came to light.”\n\nWhile Matt was going through the Superman audition process he was still under contract at Guiding Light. Bomer described how he was let go from the soap: “Concurrently on Guiding Light, there was a killer in town, and so I think they needed somebody to pin it all on someone. So, I think the executive producer very kindly wanted to free me up just in case this job came through and said, ‘Hey, you’re gonna be the killer. We’re writing you off the show. Go with my blessing.’ I guess, I basically got fired, but in a generous way.”\n\nBomer had good reason to believe he was on his way, and the role of Superman was his after he had signed a three picture deal with Warner Brothers. As to why the part of Superman never came to pass, Bomer believes it was due to his sexuality (Later, Matt would come out publicly in 2012).\n\nDuring the podcast, Matt explained, “Yeah, that’s my understanding That was a time in the industry when something like that could still really be weaponized against you. How and why and who I don’t know. But yeah, that’s my understanding.”\n\nWhile Matt has not yet played Superman, he has done stellar work in major projects including: Fellow Travelers, Magic Mike, White Collar, In Time, The Normal Heart to name but a few.\n\nWhat do you think of Guiding Light making Ben that killer in order to free up Bomer to leave the CBS soap to go and become a star in Hollywood and potentially play Superman, only for his sexuality to take the role away from him by the powers-that-be? Comment below.\n\nLast night the stars of daytime came together for a one-of-a-kind three hour-plus virtual event Daytime Stands Up – A Benefit For Stand Up To Cancer – We All Have a Story.\n\nTowards the top of the show Daytime Stands Up co-hosts Michael Fairman and Alan Locher welcomed former Guiding Light stars, Kim Zimmer (ex-Reva) and Tina Sloan (ex-Lillian).\n\nDuring their segment both actresses initially discussed playing breast cancer storylines for their character on the beloved soap opera and the impact it made on them and the viewers at the time. However, later in the conversation, Kim made a heartfelt admission that she is currently battling breast cancer in real life.\n\nKim expressed, “I was diagnosed with breast cancer on November 6th. And if it wasn’t for a wonderful circle of friends that I have, and not to mention my husband AC Weary, and my family Rachel Max and Jake, who call me every day, I would’ve fallen apart. But because of my circle that I had, including fabulous doctors, early detection (was possible).\n\n“I did have a mastectomy and I have my last infusion on Tuesday,” Zimmer added. “I would say to anyone that may get a diagnosis like I got. It’s so important that you find a support system.”\n\nOn how she is coping with her battle, Kim shared, “I’m a tough broad. But again, if I didn’t have the friends that I have, the support system that I have, the fabulous doctors, a fantastic plastic surgeon, I would’ve fallen apart. And I’m here to say early detection. Early detection. Early detection. Get your mammograms, get them soon.”\n\nEarlier in the segment, when Kim talked about Reva’s breast cancer battle and how her character would not tell the love her life, Josh Lewis (Robert Newman), which maddened fans of the GL. Kim related, “The fans were like, ‘Why are you not telling Josh?” It made for great drama, though, It bonded Billy and Reva again in life. We brought in the wonderful character of Colin, who was Reva’s by the book, cancer Doctor.”\n\n“There were a lot of wonderful things that came out of the storyline,” recalled the four-time Daytime Emmy-winner. “I actually went back and watched the (standalone show) that they did on Reva finding out she had breast cancer. And I was like, ‘Wow. I can’t imagine not fighting that story today. But it ended up being written beautifully.”\n\nShare your well-wishes to Kim on her recent medical battle with breast cancer below and check out the livestream below of Daytime Stands Up – A Benefit for Stand Up to Cancer."
