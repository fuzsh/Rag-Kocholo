        "text": "Grant Aleksander BIO\n\nThe bulk of Aleksander's TV work has been in daytime dramas (soap operas).\n\nAleksander is perhaps best known for his portrayal of Phillip Spaulding on the daytime drama Guiding Light. Aleksander played Phillip in several stints over a span of almost 30 years. His initial run was from 1982 to 1984. When Aleksander left the role, it was recast with actor John Bolger. Aleksander returned to Guiding Light in late 1986, leaving again in 1991, citing exhaustion from being front-burner five days a week for five years, as well as the loss of both of his parents in the early 1990s. Aleksander again returned to the show in April 1996, and Phillip was once again involved in front-burner story with ex-wife Beth, as well as new love interests Harley Cooper and Olivia Spencer.\n\nThe announcement in 2004 that Aleksander was let go by the show came as a shock; media reports speculated on a number of possible reasons, including Aleksander's high salary, and allegations that Aleksander was temperamental or had been feuding with the actress who portrayed his love interest.\n\nIn terms of story, the character of Phillip appeared to be murdered on-screen, but a subsequent story the next year revealed that the character was alive.\n\nIn late 2008, it was announced by the official Guiding Light website that he would be reprising his role as Phillip Spaulding. Aleksander resumed the role on February 9, 2009, and played Phillip until the show ended in September 2009.\n\nAleksander also had a brief stint on Capitol for the 1986 season as dastardly DJ Phillips, and played Alec McIntyre on All My Children from 1993 to 1996.\n\nAleksander played the bartender at \"Mickey's Bar\" in the 1986 movie Tough Guys, starring Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. In 2006, he appeared in two motion pictures, The Big Bad Swim and the American Civil War film Fields of Freedom.\n\nHe was also featured on several episodic television series, mostly in the 1980s and 1990s. His first appearance was in the ABC Afterschool Special, \"A Very Delicate Matter\". His guest starring roles include Who's the Boss? and The Fall Guy. Aleksander also played Nicholas Drake in the 1986 made-for-TV movie Dark Mansions.\n\nAleksander returned to Washington and Lee as a Guest Artist in the first \"Dick Sessoms Honorary Production\" of Shaw's \"Mrs. Warren's Profession.\" He played Sir George Crofts, with Rob Mish directing.\n\nGrant Aleksander News\n\nGUIDING LIGHT Stars Join Cast Of PERFECT CRIME To Celebrate Its 33rd Year\n\nExecutive-Producer Armand Hyatt today announced that two Emmy-nominated and beloved soap stars are joining the cast of Off-Broadway's longest running play, PERFECT CRIME this month, celebrating the record-breaking murder mystery as it enters its historic 33rd year of performances.
