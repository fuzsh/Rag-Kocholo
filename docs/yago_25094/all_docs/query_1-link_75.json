        "text": "The Park\n\nPulling up to the park, Shayne parked the car near the sidewalk as he got out and went to the other side of the car, opening the door before he reached in to unbuckle Henry's seatbelt. Watching Henry get out of the car, Shayne closes the door behind him as he takes his son's hand before going to the park. Today they, well mostly Shayne, were going to meet with Laura so the two can speak and come to a conclusion of what to do moving forward. What Shayne wants is simple, for the two of them to co-parent for Henry's sake, but does Laura want the same thing? Of course she does, as the moment she turned up at Lewis Energies and saw her son for the first time, Laura looked like she wanted to just hold Henry to kiss him on the forehead, hearing the word 'Momma'. But Laura couldn't go that far, Marina was in the room and the last thing Shayne wanted was a fight. For today, since Marina is working at Company, Shayne was going to meet with Laura alone. As they reached the play section of the park, Shayne noticed Jonathan and Sarah on the swings together.\n\nShayne - \"Hey Jonathan, looks like you and Sarah are having fun on the swings together\"\n\nGetting off of the swing, Jonathan laughed and smiled before hugging his brother. Hugging Henry as well, he kissed his nephew on the forehead while Sarah kept riding on the swing, waving at his uncle.\n\nJonathan - \"Yeah, you can say that Shayne. Were just getting out last set of fun in before the school semester starts for Sarah\"\n\nShyane - \"Ah I see, can't say that I blame her. Henry and I are here to meet up with a special someone today\"\n\nJonathan - \"Oh...is it a special someone that I know of?\"\n\nShayne - \"Kind of...but it's more of someone I met...someone i've known for a long long time\"\n\nDeciding that it would be too awkward for Henry to hear this, he gets down on one knee to speak to his son. For adult issues and matters that has to be settled, the children didn't need to see what was going to happen later on.\n\nShayne - \"Hey Henry, how about you go play over there on the swing set with Sarah? I think she'll be excited to see you and play at the same time\"\n\nHenry eagerly nodded before running up to an empty swing and got on. When he was comfortable, Henry started to push himself a little bit before he pushed himself fully, going up and down along with his cousin Sarah.\n\nShayne - \"They're great kids aren't they? Our pride and joy\"\n\nJonathan - \"Yes, they are...but you didn't answer my question. Who is this special someone?\"\n\nShayne - \"It's complicated but....it's Laura, Laura Pizano. You remember I told you about her right?\"\n\nJonathan - \"Wait...the one who died in Bosnia when you were with her? She's back? How did that happen? Hold up....is that Burke dude a part of it?\"\n\nShayne - \"I would say yes but she never said anything. She blew right into the office at Lewis Energies and disturbed a family outing between my wife and Henry. All she wanted I believe was to be there for Shayne...but you know Marina when it comes to our son\"\n\nJonathan - *Chuckles* \"Oh yeah Shayne, Marina is someone you don't mess around with when it comes to Henry. Piss her off and your'e a dead man\"\n\nShayne - \"It's also a good thing she is not here. I am going to meet up with Laura so the two of us can sit down and just talk...see where all of this goes. Any advice?\"\n\nJonathan - \"To be honest...just listen and try to come up with a compromise, it's all about what's best for little Henry. But at the same time...she may have some kind of agenda\"\n\nShayne - \"Really? Jonathan...I have known this woman for a long time when we were in Bosnia, she would never do anything to hurt Henry\"\n\nJonathan - \"Hold up Shayne....I never said she would hurt the son you and her brought into this world. I would just watch out for anything suspicious...where was she for the past ten years or before that for Henry? You and Marina have done a hell of a job raising the kid, if anything happens to him because of Laura or outside forces...you guys are going to have to take action\"\n\nShayne - *Groans* \"I wish you didn't say that Jonathan, but you might make a good point. I'll just keep my eyes on her after we're done talking. Contacting Springfield's Angel's would be good to look into her background, see what she's been up to\"\n\nLaura - \"Hi Shayne\"\n\nTurning around, both Shayne and Jonathan see Laura Pizano, who stood there with her purse over her shoulder, dressed in a light purple sundress. She had her makeup on and sunglasses that covered those eyes that drew Shayne to her in the first place. Shayne smiled a little bit with his hands in his pockets while Jonathan looked at her, eyed up from top to bottom and smiled, impressed with the lady that Shayne used to be with back in the day, the same woman Shayne thought died in one of the mines. For a woman that was thought to be dead, Jonathan's mind wondered what it's like to get to know her but felt a nudge to his waist from Shayne. Shayne looked at him and shook his head, basically giving Jonathan a look of not to go there. Jonathan didn't even meet Laura for all of his life despite him growing up in an adoptive home. Laura wasn't the man's type anyway, as Laura looked at Jonathan and just showed a friendly smile. She wasn't interested in him or Shayne at the moment but there was someone else who caught her attention on the other side of the park. A handsome stranger learning back against his truck, just watching her and she didn't know who he was.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Bauer Residence\n\nIn the backyard, Robert and Hope were playing around while the adults in the house, Rick, Michelle, and Danny were in the main living room. They were all waiting for Ed and Holly to come in so the two could talk to them, but what was so important for them to all come here? Ed told both of his children that this was urgent, so they could at least discuss what's really going on. Rick and Michelle were both coming off of their shifts for the hospital, though Rick had to go back when this was done as Cedar needed him. The two of them thought their father was in some kind of trouble and that he needed to go away or something, but that wasn't it. For Danny, he would be on Michelle's side with whatever she wants to do regarding Ed and Holly telling them everything. When Holly opened the door for three including the two kids earlier, she allowed them to come inside but they noticed Holly was concerned, so was Ed. The good thing for them is that the kids wouldn't be in the room to know what's going on, as Ed and Holly come into the room hand in hand.\n\nEd - \"Hey everybody, I apologize for holding you all up. Actually, we both apologize\"\n\nHolly - \"We just needed to talk of how were going to do this\"\n\nRick - \"Is everything okay dad and Holly? It sounded pretty urgent when you spoke to me on the phone\"\n\nMichelle - \"Same here, you guys are not in trouble with anything else right? The law and all of that?\"\n\nEd - \"No sweetheart, were not in any trouble....someone we know is on the run from the law unfortunately\"\n\nDanny - \"Who? Wait a minute? Don't tell me it's someone that we know of in the past\"\n\nHolly - \"Sebastian...Sebastian Houlce\"\n\nRick, Michelle, and Danny were dismayed to hear of that man's name. Sebastian commit ed a lot of crimes against not just them but others in this town, especially for Danny who wanted to kill Sebastian back in the day when that bastard hurt the woman he loved. Michelle didn't deserve to have the wrath of Sebastian Houlce on her along with everyone else including Ed and Holly all over again.\n\nDanny - *Glares* \"That son of a bitch is on his way here in Springfield? You gotta be kidding me, is this some kind of a sick joke?\"\n\nRick - \"Nope, dad's pretty serious about this Danny\"\n\nEd - \"Now Danny, he may go somewhere else but I think it's obvious of where he's headed to or hide in a place that we've never heard of before\"\n\nMichelle - \"And here we thought we never had to hear or possibly see him again. If that happens, I am fine with it\"\n\nRick - \"What happened exactly? What was he in prison for?\"\n\nHolly - \"Arms dealing. When he was caught the man, Sebastian went to prison in San Domingo for a long time until now\"\n\nEd - \"Someone, one of his guys that he is associated with, broke him out. An FBI agent told us this earlier on, so now you all know\"\n\nMichelle - \"And so he's on the run like you said? He could be anywhere at any time \"\n\nHolly - \"Unfortunately yes. The Springfield PD is on alert and so is the FBI, but at least everyone in Springfield will be on the alert\"\n\nRick - \"If anything dad and Holly, Sebastian Houlce deserves the actual death penalty for hurting those we love so much\"\n\nDanny - \"Funny how you say that Rick, because if it was up to me...I would kill him outright and make sure he suffers, the hell with the law. It's not going to stop Sebastian \"\n\nMichelle cringed from hearing that but she couldn't blame him. Danny would do anything to protect their family\n\nMichelle - \"Danny...I can tell you're upset but please don't go after him and try to look for Sebastian. The kids need you...I need you...who's going to protect us if you are not around\"\n\nDanny - \"I...I know Michelle. Just what that animal did to not just us but others in this town makes me sick. *Looks over at Holly* \"And I am sorry you have to deal with this too Holly\"\n\nHolly - \"It's alright Danny, I should have seen this coming, that Sebastian was going to come back to our lives. But who knows? There's no way to predict if Sebastian is coming alone unless he is not coming to Springfield\"\n\nRoss - \"Who's coming? Did I interrupt something between all of you?\"\n\nEd, Holly, Danny, Michelle and even Rick who still couldn't believe that Ross was still alive, saw the man come into the room. For most people in the room , they were glad to see him since the incident with Jason, except for Rick who wasn't angry or upset with Ross. The older man didn't have his memories so he didn't know everything about his life including the plane crash. Holly and Ed,from what his dad told him a couple of times during their phone conversations, were telling him everything about his life slowly but they haven't told Ross about the incident. It was up to Rick to be honest with Ross for his part, something he wished he could forget but Rick couldn't put it off anymore. Rick wasn't going to tell him now but seeing Ross reminded him to not sugarcoat or beat around the bush anymore. Rick wasn't sure if Philip had even seen Ross or asked Ed and Holly about his uncle but he felt Phillip was going to tell him at some point. Michelle and Danny heard of Ross' return but they haven't seen him yet despite them knowing that he was staying there when Ed spoke to his daughter.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nCompany\n\nTaking a sip of his Sprite, Phillip looked over the same text he received at the hospital after Beth was released. Just looking at it made him cringe as the man realized that whoever he spoke too at the hospital was going to strike again, this time against his family. That's why he was waiting to meet with one of Springfield Angels in Cyrus Foley, so that he'll allow him to look into who's responsible. He just hoped that the meeting with Cyrus wouldn't last long since Harley, Zach, Daisy and James were going to be here later on. While Phillip was glad to hang out with his sons, the mother of Zach and Jame's wife in Daisy, the one person he was nervous to bond with was Zach. Phillip at times visited his son in Greece but every time he visited him, Zach would be sometimes distant with him or even when they talk, Zach has a hard time opening up. So hopefully today Zach can open up some more and tell his father what he plans to do since Harley was staying in town for the long haul.\n\nCyrus - \"Phillip?\"\n\nPhillip looks up and sees Cyrus approaching him after coming in before Cyrus pulled out the chair for himself. The man takes a seat without wasting any kind of time since the man is working on a case for himself that's personal.\n\nPhillip - \"Hey Cyrus, thanks for coming. This won't take long but I need you to look into something for me\"\n\nCyrus - \"Okay, shoot, go ahead Phillip. I'm also sorry to hear what happened at the art gallery, how is Beth?\"\n\nPhillip - \"She's doing well and working at home for the time being. I'm just glad that she isn't here for this\"\n\nCyrus - \"Why do you say that?\"\n\nPhillip shows Cyrus the text that he received the other day on his cell phone as Cyrus looks at it. He arched his eyebrow and saw how strange, even how creepy the text sounded from the way Cyrus reads it.\n\nCyrus - \"What's this? Who is this I should ask?\"\n\nPhillip looked around and noticed the others in the Company who were having a good time with their loved ones, chatting with their friends, weren't listening. Phillip lowered his voice before he spoke to Cyrus, no one in the hospital had to know of this, but he couldn't take a chance. Let's say that there is someone in Company who is working with the person who did this, he may tip the guy off and Phillip would never know who it is.\n\nPhillip - \"I think..I think it's the masked man who burned half of the gallery. When Remy question Beth and I, he called me later on in the day and said the culprit has a masked covering his face...it has to be him\"\n\nCyrus - \"What? Wait a minute....you think it's the man who went after your gallery? Why the hell are you telling me? Call the Springfield PD for crying out loud\"\n\nPhillip - \"I can't Cyrus, because as much as I want to, the identity of the perp is someone I need to know who it is before going further. That's where you come in\"\n\nCyrus - \"Let me guess...find the identity of this person and bring him to you?\"\n\nPhillip - \"No...just find out who it is and i'll double the pay you work for at Springfield Angels\"\n\nCyrus nods and thinks of the intriguing offer made to him by Phillip Spaulding since he is hiring him. Lately Cyrus has been working on another case at the moment that's personal to him but maybe working on this new case if you want to call it that can make him work even harder. In the end he can get two cases done and a big pay day as well, for the agency too.\n\nCyrus -*Grins* \"You got yourself yourself a deal Spaulding\"\n\nPhillip - *Smiles a bit* \"Thank you Cyrus, I can tell you got alot on your plate so I won't take up much of your time\"\n\nCyrus - \"That I do Phillip. I'm looking into Grady's disappearance at the moment but i'll make sure to work on this new case too\"\n\nCyrus and Phillip shake hands as the two men start to stand up. But Phillip inside was shocked and curious as to why he was looking for Grady. It was a good thing that Grady took that fall off of the cliff or he would have hurt more people. Phillip wasn't going to get involved but he felt that Cyrus is not going to find Grady. Suddenly Harley, Zach, Daisy and James came inside the Company to which Phillip immediately noticed. Daisy even saw her father in law talking to her PI partner and that was odd.\n\nPhillip - \"You have my phone number Cyrus, if anything happens call me\"\n\nCyrus - \"Will do Phillip, see you later\" *Turning around he sees Harley and those with her before he smiles* \"Hey Harley, Daisy, Zach, and James\"\n\nHarley - \"Hey Cyrus, what are you doing here? *Hugs Cyrus*\n\nCyrus - \"Just on business but I was talking to Phillip about something else. Gotta run Harley, see you later\"\n\nHugging Harley back, Cyrus leaves Company as Daisy watches him leave, wondering what that was all about with Phillip. Cyrus was a grown man who could do whatever he wanted and he had his own cases, but usually if something was up they always gave each other advice or if there's a part of the case that's missing. She knew he was investigating Grady's disappearance when they spoke about it the day after the Bauer BBQ. And Grady...that's someone she rather not think about or remember since he broke her heart those years ago. Everyone told her how bad he was for Daisy but she didn't listen and in result she paid the price. While she felt for Cyrus and wasn't going to get into his investigation of finding Grady, she wondered where her ex-boyfriend went. At least she has a good man, a good husband in James as they both sit down at the table with Harley, Zach and Phillip. After he gave his dad a hug before sitting down, Zach had something on his mind he wanted to tell his parents, James and Daisy but he would tell them later on.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Park\n\nLaura watches the two men before she briefly looks over at Henry on the swings with his cousin Sarah. She smiled in relief of how her son was alive and still healthy but Lauren didn't like that she was gone for all this time, missing out on so many moments with her son. If she was pregnant with her son when the incident happened then losing her son, Lauren would have lost it and closed off everything in the world, including Shyane for the time being. But she wasn't going to think like that, her son is alive and now she can be in her life...unless Shayne was going to suck up to Marina and go the route of keeping Henry from Lauren. If that goes down, Aspen was going to come swinging for sure so that her son isn't kept away from her. What no one else knew was that she had help from someone that Shayne, Marina, the Lewis and the Coopers would never see coming. She told this person to stay far away unless Shayne and Marina played hardball with Aspen, but for now he wasn't needed.\n\nShayne - \"Hey Laura, I am so glad you made it today\"\n\nLaura - \"Hello Shayne, it's good to see you as well. Who's the guy standing next to you?\"\n\nJonathan grins and walks up to her before introducing himself to the lovely brunette. He puts his hand out to shake as he was not going to leave Laura hanging by just standing there.\n\nJonathan - \"Hello miss, I am Jonathan Randall, Shayne's cousin. The little girl over there is my daughter Sarah, nice to meet you\"\n\nLaura smiled and shook Jonathan's hand at the same time before he leaned down to kiss the knuckles of their hand. Laura almost blushed while Shayne rolled his eyes with his brother being the charming one. But inside it made he want to laugh, Tammy would of gotten a kick out of what Jonathan was trying to do.\n\nLaura - \"Oooh, I take it you are the perfect gentlemen aren't you?\"\n\nJonathan - \"No one is perfect in this world but for you, I wish you the best Laura. Sarah and I need to leave anyway but it was nice meeting you...Sarah! It's time to go home!\"\n\nSarah immediately gets off the swing and runs up to his father before he immediately hugs her, then picks up her, kissing Sarah on the forehead. Jonathan loved this little girl so much and besides the differences he had with Lizzie in the past, the two of them get along. They weren't enemies before thanks to Alan always sticking his nose where it didn't belong. But with Alan out of the picture and gone for good, there was no need to worry about him anymore.\n\nJonathan - \"Hey sweetie, did you have fun today? I want you to meet someone, this is Laura. Laura, this is Sarah\"\n\nSarah - \"Hello\"\n\nLaura - \"Hi Sarah, I bet you had a lot of fun today with Henry\"\n\nSarah - \"I sure did...now we gotta go home\"\n\nJonathan - \"Yes we do, so if you excuse us we'll be heading out. See you later\"\n\nSarah - \"Bye Laura, by Uncle Shayne, by Henry! By Laura!\"\n\nJonathan and Sarah leave the park as it was just Shayne and Laura. Henry, who saw Jonathan and Sarah leave, waved goodbye but was confused about seeing the woman next to her father. Shayne and Laura sit down on a bench as they both watched Henry continue to ride on the swings.\n\nShayne - \"So...here we are...just you and me\"\n\nLaura - \"Yeah...so...where should I start? Oh yeah...where have I been as of late?\"\n\nShayne - \"Let me go first. Laura....you died, the day I heard you die on that day from a friend of mind., it made me wish I could have done more to save you. You didn't deserve to die that day...I wish it was me instead of you Laura?\n\nLaura - \"I know Shayne, I know. After the explosion and giving birth to our son, I 'died', but that's not all that happened. What you don't know, is that my body was taken somewhere once yours truly was buried six feet into the ground\"\n\nShayne - \"Where exactly?\"\n\nLaura - \"It was a clinic outside of Bosnia but I can't remember the location. It took me a while to wake up...almost ten years to be exact until late spring. As much as I was tried and nearly weak I had to get out of the clinic and run until I found a cabin to stay in for the time being\"\n\nShayne - \"Was anyone there with you in the clinic Laura? Was Michael Burke one of them?\"\n\nLaura - \"Only a doctor and a nurse. And no, I don't even know who that is Shayne? Is he a doctor? A scientist?\"\n\nShayne - \"To put in better words, a nut job of a doctor, that's all I am going to say about that. I'm just glad that you're back Laura and now that you're back, you can be there for Henry\"\n\nLaura - \"Yeah...about that...\"\n\nShayne noticed how she left off the rest of what she wasn't saying. It was clear Laura was holding back but Shayne had a feeling where the conversation was heading towards.\n\nShayne - \"Something wrong?\"\n\nLaura - \"It's....that other woman who you're with, I have never seen her before in my life but I don't know how I feel about her\"\n\nShayne - \"Marina? She's my wife and the daughter of one of our Chief Of Police Frank Cooper. Marina was also a cop a long time ago before she retired, even running Company, the restaurant her grandfather ran himself...and Marina as a mom? She loves that boy just like you do, she's no threat.\n\nLaura - \"Maybe your right Shayne...I just don't want Henry taken from me. For over ten plus years I was gone and you thought I died, Henry had no mother, no parent at first, but you two have stepped up. Looking at him now, he's healthy and active from what I can see\"\n\nShayne nodded, remembering the time Henry was sick and it was up to his father to save him. He sacrificed a lot to make sure his son would not only stay alive but not go to another family. Heck, Dinah even encouraged him to man up and take the right responsibility, because he would have blown it if Henry went to another family. He didn't know if Laura would ever forgive him if that happened, to where Henry would never come back to Laura, Marina and Shayne.\n\nShayne - \"So, what are you planning on doing since you're staying in Springfield? Before you died, you never got the chance to pursue your dreams\"\n\nLaura - \"True but i'll put that on hold for a little bit. Right now my focus is on Henry\"\n\nShayne nodded and smiled as the two parents of Henry watch their son who immediately gets off the swing before he runs up to them. Showing them his finger which had a cut on it, Shayne immediately gets out oil tree and a band aid. Laura takes the two from him and starts to treat Henry which caught Shyane off guard. Laura though was treating the cut on Henry's finger pretty well and even introducing herself. Henry didn't know who this was but at least he smiled and said hello to Laura who said hello back to him. It's better that Shayne and Laura don't tell Henry that Laura was his mother. That would cause more confusion as the little boy would be scared that Marinas being taken away from him. Marina was the only mom that he knew growing up, but it's obvious as Shayne and Laura watch their son leave to go back on the swings, more work had to be done. But Laura still saw the handsome stranger who was watching her this entire time give her a beautiful smile before getting into his truck and leaving the park.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Bauer Residence\n\nRoss could feel something was up that Holly, Ed and the others, they weren't telling him what's going on. And why was this one guy in Rick Bauer looking at him strange? That must be one of Ed's children that Ed showed him the pictures when he first arrived at their house to stay in. The man has beautiful children and children who looked intelligent and smart, so Ross didn't feel the need to be threatened or afraid, they were good children. Ed on the other hand along with Danny, Michelle and Holy notice Rick was feeling a little nervous of seeing Ross after all that took place in the past. Ross didn't have the memories in his mind back yet but he was starting to know who the kids and the family were, so that was good news for Rick. It was better though to inform Ross about the situation instead of keeping it from him since he's living in the house with Ed and Holly. Ross back in the day was always sharp and prepared, especially for all of his cases in court so this was no different.\n\nRoss - \"Well, are all of you going to just stare and look at me or say something?\"\n\nEd - \"Sorry about that Ross. First, let me introduce you to my children and son in law, this is Rick, that's Michelle and her husband Danny Santos. Their grandchildren Robbi and Hope are outside in the backyard playing\"\n\nRoss - \"Nice to meet both of you\"\n\nRoss shakes Danny and Michelle's hand. Shaking Rick's hand, Rick nervously shakes it before smiling weakly at the older man. Why did this have to happen now of all times? Rick wasn't against Ross but he started to get those old memories of what he did back then briefly.\n\nHolly - \"Ross, someone that Ed and I know just broke out of prison. He's also on the run which makes matters worse\"\n\nRoss - \"Great scott, who in the world would be after the two of you?\"\n\nDanny - *Mutters and clenches his teeth* \"Sebastian Houlce\"\n\nRoss - \"Who?\"\n\nMichelle - \"His name is Sebastian Houlce. He's the son of Roger Thorpe and he's' a very complex person who's committed many crimes\"\n\nDanny - \"You mean more like a psychopath? Someone who should be thrown under the prison with all of the sicko's?\"\n\nRoss - \"Is he that bad to the bone?\"\n\nEd - \"Yes, that bad and maybe a little worse than his old man. He is someone who has a strong reputation that's so bad, he can't get out of it\"\n\nHolly - \"The point is Ross, he's a criminal who's on the run right now. He's a threat, a danger to everyone in this town\"\n\nRoss - \"Alright, then what's going to be done about it?\"\n\nEd - \"I spoke to Frank earlier and he'll send some cops to park near our residence, just in case keep an eye out for anything suspicious\"\n\nRoss - \"Something tells me you'll need all the man power you'll need from how this man sounds. If you need anything, let me know\"\n\nHolly - \"I think it's better if we let the Springfield PD. The FBI is in on this one too so it looks as if all the man power is needed for this case surprisingly\"\n\nRoss - \"The FBI? Sounds like this man is a force to be reckoned with but still, if you need anything, a restraining order or something to get this man off of your back , let me know\"\n\nRick - \"And on that note, I need to get back to the hospital, they need me dad and Holly. I'll give Leah your love and tell her you said hi\"\n\nEd - \"Of course son. Michelle, Danny, are you two heading home now?\"\n\nMichelle - \"Yes dad but thanks for the heads up, we'll be going now. Ross, it was nice to meet you\"\n\nRoss - \"Likewise, I hope all of us protect ourselves and be very careful of what happens next\"\n\nDanny, Michelle and Rick got up as they hugged Ed and Holly. Shaking Ross's hand in a quick way, Rick immediately left the living room and the entire house in a hurry. When he was outside their home and approaching his car, he got in, taking a sigh of relief. Rick couldn't take being in the same room with Ross and the guilt was almost starting to eat him alive, ALMOST but he starts up the car and leaves the home. Danny and Michelle gather the kids so they can leave, saying goodbye to their grandfather and step grandmother including Ross, who by the way wondered what was wrong with that Rick guy. Ross didn't know a lot of people in Springfield yet and he was getting to know them but Ross was going to have to look into Rick Bauer's history. Just by looking at him, there is no doubt Rick was almost a fishy guy but Ross can't judge the man, though he will be keeping his eyes on him. Ross and Ed sit down in the living room to watch TV as Holly goes to the kitchen to make dinner.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nCompany\n\nPhillip, Zach, Harley, James and Daisy finished ordering what they wanted to eat for lunch as the waiter took the menus away from them. Earlier they ordered their drinks as all of them take their sips. Phillip was glad to have his children, daughter in law and friend here with him to give Phillip a sense of purpose and to relax. Coming home the other day with Beth when they left Cedars Hospital was a relief but they were worried that the masked man was going to make his presence at some point. So Phillip before he left today hired security guards to keep an eye out and make sure the grounds of the mansion were guarded strongly. Beth, Peyton, Alexandra, Fletcher, etc were safe as Phillip even offered guards at Lillian and Buzz's house. But Buzz and probably Lillian would kindly reject the offer, since Buzz was in the Vietnam war fighting for our country, the man can protect himself. As far as the others goes, Zach had something on his mind he wanted to get off his chest. Earlier when he came in with his mom, brother and sister, Zach didn't want to say anything right off the bat but now was the perfect time.\n\nZach - \"So dad, mom...I wanted to tell you guys something that's been on my mind lately?\"\n\nPhillip - \"And what's that?\"\n\nHarley - \"Wait...do you have a girlfriend?\"\n\nZach - *Sighs and rolls his eyes* \"Mom, no I don't have a girlfriend since we returned, this has nothing to do with that\"\n\nPhillip - \"Okay...so what's on your mind?\"\n\nZach - \"I want to be a part of Spaulding/Lewis Enterprises and work my way to the top\"\n\nJames choked on his drink he was sipping on after hearing what his brother said. He looked at his brother in disbelief that Zach wants to work at the company. Phillip, Harley and Daisy were all but surprised to hear this from him.\n\nPhillip - \"Really? What made you decide that? You're still attending Springfield University right?\"\n\nZach - \"I'm glad you asked that dad. But yes, I am attending Springfield University still, I just want to do more than attend classes since I am focusing on my business degrees. Being a part of the Spaulding/Lewis company makes more sense, and I want to learn more of the workplace\"\n\nHarley - \"Are you sure this is what you want though? I mean there's other opportunities out there Zach you would absolutely love\"\n\nZach - \"Yeah but working at the company mom is going to challenge me to step up and be more responsible. I mean, let's be honest and this is no insult to grandpa Buzz or Marina, but do you really see me working here at Company's for the rest of my life? No, all I want to do is get the experience out of the way so if I start my own company...I know I can be successful\"\n\nHarley - \"Well Zach...if that is what you want to do..then go for it honey. Just make sure you are focused and ready\"\n\nPhillip - \"What she said son, just make sure to also focus on your studies and don't let yourself be distracted\"\n\nDaisy - \"Your dad's right. But you know something Zach? If that's what you want to do, then who's to stop you? You have my support little brother, I got your back....right James?\"\n\nJames, who was sipping on his drink felt a nudge from his wife, and from the look on his face, he was almost annoyed. James wasn't even paying attention to most of the conversation since the guy was starting to dislike that Zach was going to work at Spaulding/Lewis.\n\nJames - \"Huh? Oh yeah, of course Zach, I don't think that will be a problem. I'll speak to Lizzie tonight about it but I am sure she wouldn't mind it too. Just remember....everything isn't given to you on a silver platter..I had to work hard to be where I am at today\"\n\nZach - \"Of course James and who knows? Maybe one day i'll be like you, an executive and a big time shot caller for the company\"\n\nJames - *Chuckles and shakes his head* \"We'll see about that\"\n\nPhillip - \"Also, remember and this goes for BOTH of you, Zach and James. When you become a part of the business, don't ever let it consume you or take control. Your uncle Alan-Michael and I, our relationship as brothers was never the same...so please both of you...get along and work together\"\n\nJames - \"Dad...no worries...Lizzie and I will make sure to look out for Zach. I promise\"\n\nDaisy - \"I'm gonna go to the bathroom, i'll be right back guys\"\n\nZach - \"I'll be at the arcade games section, would you like to join me James?\"\n\nJames - \"Sure...as long as I beat your ass like Cherokee drum when it comes to arcade games..let's go\"\n\nPhillip and Harley chuckled as the three stood up and went to where they were going. The conversation between them all that was started thanks to Zach went well and didn't go extremely bad.\n\nPhillip - \"At least the conversation didn't explode like a powder keg. James wasn't happy, well almost like he couldn't stand it that our son is going to be a part of Spaulding/Lewis. I just don't want them to fight like Alan-Michael and I did Harley. They're brothers and they deserve to be there for one another. So hopefully James can guide Zach, to be someone he can look up too\"\n\nHarley - \"I think he'll be okay....I hope. Have you seen Alan-Michael yet?\"\n\nPhillip shakes his head before taking a sip of his drink and sighed. That brother of his was starting to get out of control from what he heard from Lizzie and the others.\n\nPhillip - \"No I haven't Harley but if was here right now, a part of me wants to slap him in the face. He's acting like dad and our grandfather Brandon, that's not good on what he wants to do. He thinks taking over Spaulding/Lewis will make up for everything he suffered under the thumb of our father...but it's not\"\n\nHarley - \"What's his end game?\"\n\nPhillip - \"Take control of the company and I hope this doesn't happen but clean house, firing those he feels like is useless, keeping those who are important to him and give the Lewis family back their rights of the company. And prove to me that Alan-Michael is the bigger, better and badder brother than me...he has no idea what he's doing. My brother is in over his freaking mind Harley\"\n\nHarley - \"I'm sorry to hear of that, hopefully you and Alan-Michael can make up. Have the two of you spoken to each other yet?\"\n\nPhillip - \"Nope, I want to speak to him...if he could answer the freaking voicemails I send to his cell phone but he's probably TOO focused on his little hostile take over\"\n\nHarley - \"Give it time, Phillip, you two will come around. How's Beth?\"\n\nPhillip - *Smiles* \"Beth is okay but I could tell when the two of us go to bed, she's almost tussling around and having nightmares of the incident at the gallery. Even if she was trying to move forward it's still in the back of her mind. I wish I could do more to help her\"\n\nHarley - \"At least you're there for her still Phillip, that's what counts. And from the look of it with Cyrus....you are about to get even more help...if you know what I mean\"\n\nPhillip saw the look on her face of wanting to know more of him and Cyrus. She was just sitting there with her hand propping her head as Phillip wasn't surprised she caught on when coming into the restaurant of Company. He made sure to keep the sound of his voice a little lower so others here won't notice.\n\nPhillip - \"Alright alright...you got me...what do you want to know?\"\n\nHarley - \"I didn't ask Phillip...I was just observing\"\n\nPhillip - \"Observing?\"\n\nHarley - \"More like observing my ass right?\"\n\nPhillip - \"Harley look, whatever you're thinking, I am not going after the person who is responsible for this\"\n\nHarley - \"But you are right? Once Cyrus has all the information of what you need, you'll go after the guy, but what about after that? What are going to do?\"\n\nPhillip - \"Harley, I am not going to do anything but confront the man and then call the police, that's it\"\n\nHarley - \"I hope so, the last thing our son and your children need, what I don't want to see, is you behind bars. You're better than all of that, you've come too far just to throw it all away\"\n\nPhillip - \"And I am not going to do that. Thank you for looking out for me though Harley\"\n\nHarley - *Smiles* \"Anytime Phillip, anytime\"\n\nThe waiter comes back with their orders just in time when James, Zach, and Daisy come back from where each of them were before. As they sit down, all of them at the table start eating before Phillip's phone notifies him of a text on his phone. Taking out his cell phone, it was the same caller ID that called him and even texted him when Phillip left the hospital with Beth. This irked Phillip to no end that this guy wasn't going to get up but he didn't forget of what Harley told him. The kids needed the man, they need their father, and Peyton needed her big brother as she had no father figure in her life, Alan was gone. And as much as Alan-Michael and Phillip may not admit it, they're brothers, they NEED one another. Beth is the love of his life, his own wife, and the woman he loves the most needed him too as her husband. Turning his phone off then putting it away, the man continues having lunch with his sons, daughter in law and Harley, focusing on his family.\n\nEND OF EPISODE 12"
