I have tried to include important\n\nmilestones, such as arrivals, marriages, births, divorces & deaths.\n\nThe rest is based on my memory & files and the memories & files & old\n\nmagazines of lots of other GL fans on RATS/RATSC and the GL discussion\n\nlist (especially Wendy, Dave D., Sheila, Shelby, Ella, Joan, Diane W.,\n\nDale & Anja).\n\nIf you see anything out of order, or you know a more exact date than the\n\none given in the timeline, please let me know. Also, if you know the date\n\nof a significant event not included in this timeline, please let me know\n\nso I can add it. Please state your source (e.g., old updates, old tapes,\n\nmagazine article, \"it happened at the same time as/right before/right\n\nafter ___\"). I'll update the timeline accordingly & post a new version\n\nafter I've incorporated all the replies.\n\nAlso, if you know when any of the following characters or actors were\n\nintroduced, please let me know:\n\n- Trish Lewis\n\n- Josh Lewis\n\n- Billy Lewis (was it before or at same time as Mindy?)\n\n- HB Lewis\n\n- Jennifer & Morgan Richards\n\n- Kelly Nelson\n\n- Reardon family (Bea, Nola, Tony)\n\n- Maureen Reardon (Ellen Dolan)\n\n- Ellen Dolan replaced by Ellen Parker\n\n- Vanessa & Henry Chamberlain\n\n- Lillian Raines (was it same time as Beth or before?)\n\n- Sherry Stringfield replaced by Liz Keifer\n\nPlease send replies by personal e-mail, as I do not always get to read\n\nthe newsgroup and I would rather not flood the discussion list.
