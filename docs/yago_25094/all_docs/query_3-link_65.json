        "text": "I knew Bridget through a mutual friend, and her husband Jerry (nobody called him Jerome). Bridget was a very talented lady...as both a writer and a painter...but she was a very difficult person at times. Jerry was much easier to get along with, everyone liked him. However, Jerry did not always have the best instincts as a writer, he was better at handling the business aspects. It was Bridget's skill as a writer that made their characters and stories so good.\n\nBridget had a lot of personal issues with her father, Frank Hursley, when he was alive. And she used a lot of the drama from her own family as the basis for some of her most potent soap storylines. In addition to drawing from her own life, she had a knack for studying social issues and doing extensive research before writing some of her most important stories.\n\nWhen you watched Bridget's characters and stories on a daytime serial, you knew they came from a real place. It wasn't just TV fiction.\n\nI am still thinking about which writers I most admire in the daytime soap genre.\n\nI will post a proper list soon. Not all mine will be headwriters, since I think there have been some very good dialogue writers and outline writers who never got a shot at the top job.\n\nIncidentally, the British soaps are written by committee. There is no head writer. The executive producer decides what the storylines will be...most of the story strands are developed in connection with specific charities or medical organizations. Like for example, Coronation Street is currently doing a story about a kid who has Lyme's disease. About a year ago Emmerdale did a story about a couple over 40 who learned a baby was on the way and that it would be born with Down's Sydrome and they aborted it. That story was developed by interviewing real-life couples who had terminated Down's pregnancies.\n\nAnyway, once the exec producer decides the stories for the next 6 to 12 months, then these plots are gone over with the writing team and the actors who will perform the material. There are storyliners who figure out what happens in each month (similar to the outline writers for U.S. soaps) then the scripts are assigned in much the same way U.S. soaps do it. But the key difference is that British soaps do not have a headwriter. The exec producer is in complete control of the content.\n\nOkay, here's a list of writers, with brief descriptions of why I like them...\n\nDoug Marland...combined community issues with larger social issues. Stellar work for The Doctors, Guiding Light, Loving and As the World Turns.\n\nPam Long...sentimental favorite. Loved her writing on Texas, Guiding Light, Search for Tomorrow and One Life to Live. Nobody else wrote strong women like she did, especially business women. But her characters had heart, and were faced with gut-wrenching tragedies. That's my kind of soap.\n\nBarbara Esensten & James Harmon Brown. Find them very versatile. Intriguing work at the end of Loving, their three year stint with traditional storytelling at Guiding Light from 1997 to 2000 was a renaissance period for the show; and they did quirky/innovative stuff at The City and Port Charles.\n\nEileen & Robert Mason Pollock...responsible for a high point in storytelling for The Doctors from 1970 to 1975. They reused a lot of their ideas for the first few seasons of Dynasty a decade later.\n\nBill Bell, in a class by himself. But I think his wife Lee Phillip Bell made him great. She developed stories with him that came from topics she had covered on her Chicago-based talk show.\n\nBridget Dobson...we've already discussed her. Favorite stories were all at Guiding Light: Evie's blindness, Rita's inability to have an orgasm with Ed, the creation of the Phillip-Alan-Justin-Jackie-Elizabeth story; and Holly's rape/shooting Roger, which is my most favorite storyline of all time.\n\nJean Rouverol...outline writer and script writer at various soaps, spent many years working under the Dobsons.\n\nMillee Taggart...former actress on Search for Tomorrow who became a headwriter for Loving and Guiding Light. I think she went deeper with the characters than other writers and understood the importance of long storylines. She was like Pam Long in that regard, who had also started as a soap actress. Personally, I think writers who started as actors know how to craft material that can give other performers gold to play on screen.\n\nJean Passanante...I liked her work at As the World Turns & The Young and the Restless, and later at General Hospital. She wasn't brilliant but she was consistently good.\n\nRobert Guza...people on this board didn't like him. But I found his mob stories on GH a guilty pleasure. High point was the virus story where Alan Quartermaine died.\n\nSimon Ashdown...my favorite British script writer. All his scripts for EastEnders are brilliant. He writes very dark stuff, often puts the characters on the brink of disaster. Never less than powerful melodrama from him.\n\nDaran Little...another good British script writer. He did work on The Young and the Restless for awhile. He lives in West Hollywood, actually. But he currently writes for EastEnders. His material for LGBTQ characters is exceptional and he finds humor in places where it is needed in the middle of heavy stories.\n\nJeanne Glynn...loved all her stuff on Search for Tomorrow in the mid-80s. She wrote dark storylines, which I found compelling and heartbreaking. She gave Sherry Mathis (incomparable as heroine Liza Sentell) the best material to play.\n\nHogan Sheffer...really liked his writing at As the World Turns from 2000 to 2005. He didn't fare well at Days of Our Lives in the late 2000s. His work at Y&R, which came afterward, was average.\n\nMaria Bell...Bill Bell's daughter-in-law, who wrote Y&R from 2008 to 2012. Not everything worked, but she loved writing for Jeanne Cooper, and all of that did work very well. She respected the show's history/roots.\n\nJames C. Reilly...controversial writer at Days of Our Lives and Passions. Had previously written for Guiding Light. I find his stuff influential, even if some of it was quite outlandish. He knew how to make people talk about the characters, by giving them memorable things to do.\n\nAnn Marcus...a legendary scribe for primetime soaps and daytime soaps. I'd say her best work was at Days of Our Lives and Falcon Crest. She knew how to capture unique moments for female characters.\n\nJames Lipton...loved all the dark stuff he wrote at Capitol from 1986 to 1987. Absolutely brilliant, way ahead of its time.\n\nHenry Slesar...wrote Edge of Night from 1968 to 1983...so many memorable storylines. He did some excellent stuff at Capitol from 1985 to 1986...he gave Constance Towers a very good storyline at Capitol.\n\nLorraine Broderick...many good years at All My Children. I liked her short period in the late 90s at As the World Turns. She knew how to write strong material for Eileen Fulton.\n\nI received a letter from Pam Long once, when she was headwriter at Santa Barbara. It would have been sometime in mid-1991 or late 1991. I had gone to high school in Colorado with a Korean girl who knew I liked soap operas and that I was a fan of Pam Long's writing on Guiding Light. This girl from school, was two years older..she was a senior when I was a sophomore, and we weren't even very close friends...but we had some of the same classes together, since I was advanced and taking upper level courses when i was only in 10th grade. Anyway, this girl, whose name was Sandy, graduated and she went east. Nobody heard from her again.\n\nThen one day in my senior year, I get a letter from Sandy...she was living in Ridgefield Connecticut and working as a nanny for some rich woman. The woman turned out to be Pam Long. And Sandy, my ex-classmate was nanny to both of Pam's young sons. She told Pam about me, said 'there's some guy back in Colorado who's a huge fan of your writing.' etc.\n\nAnyway, after receiving the letter from Sandy, I graduated from high school and went to university in Los Angeles to study writing and try to break into movies/television. And that is when I received a letter from Pam Long, because of Sandy. It was such a great letter. Pam encouraged me to stay in college and make sure I earned my degree. I think Sandy had told her I was considering dropping out of college to pursue a career full time in television. Anyway, it was just the right sort of \"pep talk\" I needed.\n\nI never forgot it. Pam gave me advice that my own mother would not have given me. My mother had never gone to college and didn't see the value in spending all that time and money for a degree that I may never be able to use in show biz. But Pam Long, she saw the value in it. It's funny how life works sometimes. I was just some teenaged kid going to high school in a remote oil town in Colorado, watching soaps I had recorded on the VCR. Little did I know then that some of the connections you make, because of television, can change the course of your life."
