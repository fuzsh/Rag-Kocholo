        "text": "How do Buzz Cooper, the son of poor Greek immigrants, and his children justify looking down their noses at the aristocratic Spaulding family? Why are they so judgmental of the Spauldings? Is it because the Spauldings are often viewed as being rather dysfunctional? Are the Coopers really any less dysfunctional than the Spauldings?\n\nBuzz abandoned his first wife Nadine and their young children, letting them believe he was dead for many years. Nadine also abandoned their children a few years later to pursue her dream of becoming a famous movie star. A young Frank and Harley still had their elderly grandfather to look after them. But that didn’t prevent Frank from operating and illegal “chop shop” or Harley from becoming an unwed teen mother by a young man who ended up in jail for armed robbery.\n\nBut let’s be fair to poor old Buzz. He did stick around to help raise Lucy, you know the daughter he kept secret from the rest of the family. He did tell Nadine about the girl. Although he claimed Lucy wasn’t really his, eventually he came clean to his ex-wife. But Nadine really didn’t seem to mind. Between trying to blackmail Alan Spaulding into marrying her, hiding a pregnant Bridget Reardon in her attic, faking her own pregnancy in order to hang onto wealthy husband Billy Lewis, trying to pawn Bridget’s baby off as her own, and making everyone believe Buzz was her cousin instead of her long lost husband, Nadine was pretty busy.\n\nHow did a family like that become the moral compass for all of Springfield? Was it through their old-fashioned blue-collar work ethic? Buzz must’ve worked hard to own such a nice restaurant as Company, right? Actually Buzz purchased the business with the money he inherited from his second wife Jenna, a well-known jewel thief. Or was Jenna his third wife? I’ve lost count.\n\nWhy is it so important for Harley to fix the Spauldings, a family she professes to despise? Why did she treat Gus, the man she claims to love, so harshly for wanting to protect his family? Is Gus’s attempt to protect his Aunt Alexandra in order to keep her out of jail any different than Harley’s attempt to cover up a crime she thought her father had committed in order to keep him out of jail?\n\nHarley must be a hard worker though. She did work her way up to the lofty position of CEO of international conglomerate Spaulding Enterprises, didn’t she? Actually she was appointed by a board of directors that consisted of the bitter and vengeful ex-wives of Phillip Spaulding as well as Phillip’s rebellious young daughter, all eager to hurt the Spaulding family any way that they could.\n\nSurely Harley must’ve been qualified for the job. Actually Harley was a college dropout whose claim on the company seems to be based on her ability to marry her way through the Spaulding men. First it was a teenaged Alan-Michael for half his trust fund. Then it was the recently divorced Phillip, heir to the Spaulding throne. And now it is illegitimate black sheep Gus Aitoro.\n\nHarley had previous experience in the company, didn’t she? Yes Harley was employed as Phillip’s secretary for a short time. Although she committed fraud in order to secure that job. Not only did she disguise her appearance, but she also used a phony name and we can only assume a phony social security number as well. And she did it all, not because she needed a job, but rather in an attempt to undermine her ex-husband within his family’s business.\n\nIsn’t that a tad bit unethical for someone as self righteous as Harley, not to mention illegal. Now you’d think Harley would’ve been prosecuted for her crimes. She must’ve known her actions were wrong. She was a police officer at one time. But this is Springfield. The Coopers seldom pay for any of their crimes. I guess it helps to have an older brother who is the Chief of Police.\n\nJust how did Frank become the Chief of Police? Wasn’t he a known criminal with his “chop shop” for cars he knew were stolen? The authorities never uncovered his illegal activities. I wonder if he ever attempted to make restitution to all those innocent victims. I suppose not. It would only cut into his temperance lectures on the evils of the Spaulding family.\n\nThe Spauldings are known for their lack of fair play when it comes to business. A Cooper would never be unfair to anyone, would they? Buzz did sell Company to Phillip Spaulding. And when Phillip left the restaurant to his daughter Lizzie, Buzz’s other son Coop set out to seduce Lizzie into giving the restaurant back to Buzz. And eventually she did give the restaurant to Buzz because of her feelings for Coop. She didn’t sell it back to him, she gave it back. For a man who freely condemns the Spaulding way of life, Buzz certainly made a very Spaulding-like profit on that business deal.\n\nAnd what about Coop? He vandalized Spaulding property, and the Spauldings were treated like criminals for insisting that he take responsibility for his crime and work off the damages. How interesting that Coop would choose to use the last name Bradshaw, the last name of his mother the jewel thief, rather than the almost sacred name of Cooper. Perhaps he sees the hypocrisy of being a Cooper."
