        "text": "It really is good that this really wasn’t Phillip’s true funeral. The character deserved better than this. Frankly he deserved better than all of this storyline . The original intent of the TPTB was to help boost ratings and improve their bottom line was to follow up on Phillip going crazy by killing him off.\n\nLater they planned to have Phillip return from the dead. But according to reports at the time, they actually fired Grant Aleksander, the VERY talented actor who played Phillip. They just assumed he’d come back to the show when they called. Reports at the time lead me to speculate that perhaps they hoped to pay him less or move him to recurring status. Whatever their plan Aleksander wasn’t having it and instead started focusing on work behind the camera that he’d long been interested in. After his departure from the show, TPTB did use part of a previously shot but not used fantasy sequence where Phillip was in a mental hospital to have him in one more episode. The fantasy sequence was re-edited to become reality as it was revealed to the audience that Alan had shot Phillip in order to stop him from hurting others, especially his children, and get him in private mental care, leaving the rest of the people of Springfield with a puzzle that they will not really unravel until Aleksander and Phillip returned in 2009.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xvJeh-lGq0\n\nI don’t have the entire funeral. What I found is from November 18, 2004, I’ll keeping looking for more. It’s rather ironic that Harley and Olivia are the ones shown to speak in this clip. Harley married Phillip knowing he still had deep feelings for Beth (Harley actually thought Phillip was going to tell her he was going to ask Beth when he proposed) and when he acted on them in a life and death situation, he lied knowing Harley was only interested in her ideal vision of him, not the real him, so it’s only one REALLY big mistake and Harley decides Phillip is unredeemingly evil and that’s that. Her determination to keep her sons away from Phillip and to expose them to Gus who Phillip had legitimate reason to distrust was part of the reason Phillip went nuts. I will give her that at least she says here that they should have gotten Phillip real help sooner instead of just blaming him which is certainly true.\n\nThe other speaker is Olivia who triggered all this with her lie that Emma had died at birth. This pushed Phillip over the edge, but instead of being sorry for what she’d done and maybe telling him the truth, she uses Phillip’s instability to try to gain control of the company for herself. So she has no right to criticize Phillip, but it is usually the first one to do so.\n\nThis funeral is WAY too small. Most obviously Phillip’s children besides Lizzie should be there. He was always regretful he didn’t go to Jackie’s so I can’t believe Rick wouldn’t have made sure the kids were there. Then his family Alexandra, Alan-Michael, Nick, Sam, should all have returned. Plus Michelle would definitely have been there, not just for herself, but to support Rick. It’s ridiculous. I am glad they at least focused a small bit on Beth and Rick who should be front and center and Ross since he always was so supportive of Phillip even though in another terrible story the soap was forced into telling do to poor administrative choices Ross trying to help Phillip led to his death.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.
