        "text": "Three days ago, on April’s fool day – not a reliable date – I was told by one of my voice over colleagues in Milan that Guiding Light – the series I’ve been dubbing for 15 years – is going to END forever, as CBS has apparently decided to cut all its soaps.\n\nI was – and still am – in total shock. GL isn’t something that can end. GL is eternal and recurrent like Christmas, sunrise and chocolate ice cream. Guiding Light started on the radio in the USA 72 YEARS AGO. It has survived World War 2, the cold war, various recessions and George Bush. GL is part of our collective identity whether we like it or not, because it created a genre – the soap opera – that went on to conquer TV networks all over the world.\n\nIn Italy, GL, under the (terrible) name of “Sentieri”, has touched at least 3 generations. I remember my latin teacher at high school rushing home after her last lesson at 12.30 to watch what had happened to Beth and Phillip (who were teenagers back then). I was personally hooked by the Roger and Holly story way before beginning to “dub” the soap.\n\nGL DESERVES to be saved, because it makes no sense to keep other soaps alive (horrible stuff such as the Bold and the Beautiful for instance) while killing their “mother”. We either decide to abolish all soaps or we keep GL!\n\nAnd then, I wonder, how are the producers thinking of “ending” the stories of characters that have been alive for decades?\n\nIt’s impossible to end GL because GL is like the world. Since it began in 1937 we’ve seen characters being born, growing up, getting married, giving birth to new charcaters who have married other characters creating a second generation, then athird, then a fourth… The families in fictional SPRINGFIELD have multiplied, it’s not only the Bauers anymore, it’s the Lewis and the Spauldings, and the Santos, and the Coopers, and the Marlers and many many others…\n\n…It’s humanly impossible to come up with an end for all those stories because GL simply deals with life and you can’t put an end to Life, unless you have a cosmic catastrophy sweeping away the whole human race. This is really the only end for GL, an asteroid falling onto the city of Springfield, delating all its inhabitants and every trace of their existance. In that case Reva, and Harley and Lizzie and Phillip and Rick will suddenly disappear like the dynosaurs.\n\nI do hope Procter and Gamble, who have been producing GL since 1937, will find a different collocation for the show and therefore save Springfield from extinction. If they don’t, I can imagine myself, a few years from now, wondering how my friend Lizzie Spaulding is doing – because nobody knows what happens to characters once writers stop telling their stories and actors stop embodying their lives.\n\nWhere do they go? Where would the thousands and thousands of people who have been passing through “Springfield” end up now that CBS is going to take away their right to exist?\n\nIf Pirandello was alive, he might try to write a play about it. “2500 characters in search of a channel”.\n\nPerhaps he would end up writing a soap.\n\nTO HELP SAVING GL PLEASE GO TO:\n\nhttp://www.thepetitionsite.com/petition/585207060\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zQeGZjMfz0&feature=related\n\n…I can’t remember whether it’s a film or a play… But here’s the story: An actress goes for an audition. She is asked by the director to simply describe the contents of her bag. She opens it and starts going through the little objects that had been hidden there for ages: an old purse, a little mirror, a photograph. Each object is linked to a memory, a moment, a place. Each object tells something about her personality, her past, her character. Some memories are funny, some moving and the director is really touched. So touched, he’s determined to give her the part. The actress is about to leave the theatre, when the director calls her back: “hey, wait, you’ve forgotten your bag!” he yells. The actress smiles. “Oh no, it’s not mine. I hate carrying bags. I’ve borrowed it from one of the girls waiting outside…”\n\nI always liked that story. One can feel cheated – the actress fools everyone into believing every single word about the bag is true, and nobody likes to be teased – but, after all, isn’t she there exactly for that reason? To prove her acting ability, her talent for creating illusions? I also like the idea that so much can be implied and imagined just by looking at a bag and its contents… I don’t know about you but sometimes I carry the same bag for weeks and after a while things start “sedimenting” on its bottom (and I don’t mean necessarily organic leftovers!), small items end up in the seams, each pocket seems to contain some unexpected surprise, things I’ve been looking for for days… After a month, my bag could be “analysed” like a rock, layer by layer, each part telling a different story…\n\nAll this to introduce a photo. You might wonder why I havent written for quite a while and the reason is that I kind of set up a theatre company, LegalAliens, and produced a rehearsed reading of a new play, here in London… But I’ll tell you about that in a later post. During rehearsals, a photographer came. First she took very professional and serious pictures of us rehearsing. Then she probably got bored out of her mind, and she began to look around. Click click… Among her random clicks, she shots this:\n\nIt’s my bag. My notorious, apple green bag that has been punctually appearing every summer for the past 5 years (it’s too bright for winter…) It’s huge. It’s like Mary Poppins’ bag, I could probably fit a lamp and a wardrobe in, if I tried hard. It’s fake leather and it’s peeling off. I don’t care. I’m not discarding it, not until I find an alternative, big, bright bag to take its place. I need big bags because I’m often out and about for the whole day and I need to make sure I’m prepared for every occasion life can throw at me – rain, cold, sunshine, the idea for a new novel, hunger, the man of my life, two hours on the Northern Line stuck at Camden Town for signal problems… I need money, food, water, clothes, pens (I have at least 6 or 7 in each bag), paper, travelcards, credit cards, maps, reading material, music, make up, laptop, USB key with all my recordings, USB key with all my writing, USB key with all my photos (I need a USB key with bigger memory to save them all in one, I know…), hair clips, hair bands, curls activator (hair plays a major part in my life). Basically I need to know that if a nuclear war starts, if an earthquake destroys London, or if a thief breaks into my flat and takes everything away, I’ll still be fine, because all I care about is with me. Be prepared. “Alertness is all”, Peter Brook says…\n\nOn that particular day, as you can see, my bag contained:\n\n– a denim jacket – This jacket, like the bag, has also been making a punctual appearance every summer for AGES. All my friends remember it. I’ve tried other things: cotton jackets, jumpers, cardigans… But nothing is as good. First of all denim goes with everything. It’s not too warm nor too light. And it’s faded, a bit torn, it has personality… I like clothes with personality, with a “life”…\n\nHere’s a picture of my jacket, my bag and myself (to prove I’m actually telling the truth, no actress making up lies here). It was taken in Scotland two years ‘ago:\n\n– Next item: a necklace. Green, like the bag. I bought it at Stansted airport a few months ‘ago. I couldn’t resist. I’m such a sucker when it comes to shopping. And I do tend to shop at airports… Problem is, I spend so much time in airports, traveling up and down between ITaly and the UK, I need to kill time while there… It’s stupid. I wake up at impossibly early hours in the morning in order to fly cheap, then I arrive at the airport and all I’ve managed to save on the flight goes into face creams, make up, underwear… Necklaces! The problem is, since they introduced rules restricting handluggage, you can only travel with one ridiculously small suitacase. Thanks to my small size, I manage to fit all sorts of stuff in my little bag, but I always forget something. On that occasion, fun jewlery. Can I possibly survive 4 days in Milan with no bright necklaces? No way. I bought one.\n\n– a banana. In LOndon, no actors travels without bananas in their bags. And water, of course, but water is more internationally spread. Bananas are more specific to British actors. Even Shakespeare is believed to have carried bananas with him. No, this isn’t true. Anyway, in Italy there’s such a variety of cheap and quite healthy snacks, no actors need to carry bananas. You carry crackers, pavesini, or seasonal fruit. In autumn, apples or pears. In winter, oranges. In summer, peaches or apricots. In the UK they don’t grow much fruit, so you’ll find the same tasteless apples all year round. Peaches are soft and messy or hard and bitter. Plums are expensive. Bananas are the best choice. Easy to carry, they don’t smell (unless they’re off) and are energetic and filling. They dont make you feel guilty like chocolate bars, and they don’t make you look fanatic like energy bars. They keep you going, when your director decides the scene you’re rehearsing looks crap and “we’re going to work through lunch to improve it, is everybody fine with it?” Sure, of course we’re fine… By the end of the scene you’re so hungry you’re prepared to stick a kebab through the director’s ass and eat him alive… But at least, if you’d managed to quickly have a banana beforehand, you’re not going to faint. Some actresses I know (unfortunately it’s always women who come up with pseudo-healthy stuff), convinced sugar and wheat are really bad for you, have started carrying rice cakes instead. “Oh, they’re soooo nice, do you want to try one?” Sure, very nice, if you like the taste of polythene… Usually, the same actresses, after 6 hours rehearsals, throw themselves onto chocolate cookies and Jaffa cakes, swallowing twentyfive of them in a row wihout even chewing.\n\n– Book. This was a really “great touch”. What a coincidence that on the day the photographer decided to take the picture of “an actress’ bag”, I had Katharine Hepburn’s biography with me…\n\nI very rarely read bios. I prefer novels. And I usually choose writers’ bios – as I explained in a previous post I have the tendency to get obsessed with an author and want to discover everything about her/him. But a few months ‘ago, while browsing on Ebay, I saw a Hepburn and Tracy film collection on sale for about five pounds. Four movies, including Adam’s rib and State of the Union… I bought it. I always loved old Hollywood movies, they’re so classy and Hepburn and Tracy were absolutely amazing. It’s so strange that for all the talking about their incredible screen chemistry, in all those films they actually never kiss once. It’s all implied. I also realised she portrayed women incredibly modern for those times. Independent, free, women who wanted a career and who didn’t depend on men for their happiness. Wow. And she wasn’t even that beautiful, I mean, she was very interesting but quite tomboy-like, skinny and flat chested, definetly not the kind of curvy type that was so popular back then.\n\nI went back on Ebay to see if I could find Philadelphia Story (I never actually saw it, shame on me). Instead, I found a biography. It’s great fun. She was so clever. She used the press and the star system to her own advantage, creating an image for herself that the masses would adore, an “icon” that bore not that much resemblance to her real self. I find this quite fascinating. She managed to become a Hollywood star – and Hollywood was a terribly conservative and old fashioned community back then – despite being quite openly bisexual. How about that? And the New York Village back then was such a vibrant place, full of artists, writers, musicians, new ideas. A bit like Paris at the turn of the 19th century. Such places can be so nurturing. I wonder whether it can still be possible, in our society, to have places – cities, neighbourhoods – where artists and intellectual gather to try and create new things. Or whether now anything new is bound to happen online, virtually, in cyberspace. How sad. And one can’t really wear nice clothes and bohemian hats in cyberspace.. I still havent reached the point when Katherine starts her affair with Spencer Tracy (while still seeing a woman, apparently), but I’m sure it’ll be fun… She was so strong willed, which is something I always admired, maybe because I’m such a softie, I’m so bad at concentrating my energies on one thing only, even when I want it really badly… I’m so easily distracted. But the more I go on, the more I’m convinced people who make it are the ones who manage to keep their attention focussed on their goal. One thing at the time to walk your way to the top. I’ll never manage…\n\nTalking of which, I’d better stop because I have mountains of other things to do, including going out to by a new vacuum cleaner. Of course I doubt Katharine Hepburn had ever had to deal with such trivial stuff, first of all vacuum cleaners didnt exist in the 30s… Or did they? Anyway, what’s in your bag? It’d be interesting to find out! I’ll leave you with a selection of Katharine Hepburn’s quotations I found. Enjoy!\n\nSelected Katharine Hepburn Quotations\n\n• I never realized until lately that women were supposed to be the inferior sex.\n\n* WORK HAS NEVER HURT ANYONE. IT’S THE LACK OF IT HAT DESTROYS PEOPLE (one of my favourites)\n\n* You’re expected to do your own work, take matters into your own hands and use plain old common sense as your guide\n\n• Life is to be lived. If you have to support yourself, you had bloody well better find some way that is going to be interesting. And you don’t do that by sitting around wondering about yourself.\n\n• Acting is the most minor of gifts and not a very high-class way to earn a living.. After all, Shirley Temple could do it at the age of four.\n\nAnd she ends the beautiful autobiographical documentary “ALL ABOUT ME” with this simple one: LISTEN TO THE SONG OF LIFE\n\nRight, I’ve been dubbing the same soap opera for about 15 years. It’s called Guiding Light, in Italian, SENTIERI. I think it’s high time I paid respect to the only source of regular income I’ve ever had.\n\nI haven’t always dubbed the same character in the soap. My first “taster”, back in the early 90s was Lacey. I can’t remember her surname but she did gymnastics and I think was somehow related to the Coopers… A cousin perhaps? She didn’t last long.\n\nThen along came Samantha Marler.\n\nSam I remember very well, and not only because she was the split image of Ugly Betty (without braces). I feel bad saying it because I’ve seen recent photos of the actress who used to play her, Suzy Cote, and she’s so pretty now! But back then the GL stylists really must have conjured up to make her look like a total nerd, awkward, clumsy, always wearing pink ribbons and huge glasses… Poor thing! I loved her, the way you love a slightly retarded friend. Samantha was lawyer Ross Marler’s niece – I’m prepared on this – and also the daughter of Justin Marler, who is actually Phillip Spaulding’s REAL father. Ahaaaah… Phillip Spaulding is the (adopted? fake?) son of Alan Spaulding, the richest man in Springfield (which is where the story takes place). But we’ll come back to the Spauldings later.\n\nSamantha at first fancies Frank – lost cause – but eventually falls in love with Dylan, a sort of Bon Jovi “dei poveri” without the sex appeal. Sam’s family is against Dylan, who’s already got Harley Cooper pregnant and who is poor, ignorant and unemployed (even though he’s later discovered to be Reva’s son, one of thousands. When a young guy in Springfield is an orphan, sooner or later it’ll appear he’s Reva’s child, she’s forgetful like that).\n\nAnyway, Dylan takes Sam’s virginity and runs away with her – who in the meantime has been restyled and de-glassified – in a car. Pity they have an accident and Sam is left paralyzed. And this – please forgive me – is when the funny bit began because Sam had the most ridiculous wheelchair EVER. Basically it wasn’t a wheelchair. Sam was strapped on a wheeled platform, STANDING, and would move everywhere, quite fast, commanding this thing with a sort of joystick. Hilarious. The sound engineers in the recording studios used to call her ROBOCOP. The gruesomest thing of all was when Dylan tried to make love to her while she was paralyzed in bed. Yuk!\n\nSam wasn’t a very popular character on the show. At some point she started walking again (miracle!) and fell in love with her doctor, Daniel St John, who of course couldn’t care less about her because was in love with Holly. Now, no man in his right mind back in 1992 would EVER consider leaving Holly for Sam, as Holly was the sexiest, funniest and most intelligent character ever appeared in the soap (why is she not there anymore? BRING HOLLY BACK!!!).Maureen Garrett, who played her for over 20 years, is the best actress that’s ever appeared on American daytime TV, an incredibly intelligent woman and even if she must be approaching 60, I could consider becoming a lesbian to be with her (which apparently she’d appreciate as she’s said to be gay. Maureen, call me, my luck with men has run out ages ‘ago).\n\nAfter a few months poor Sam disappeared without warning, she went to college, they said, without even saying goodbye, and since then NOBODY has EVER mentioned her Name.\n\nThen it was Lucy’s time. Lucy was fun! Pretty, cool, loud…\n\nShe was a Cooper, and a total nutter, and how could it be otherwise when your dad is called “Buzz” and your sister HARLEY DAVIDSON? The Coopers are Greek and run a diner, called “Company”. The moment she arrives in Springfield she’s into trouble, so I truly enjoyed dubbing her, this until she met Alan Michael Spaulding (REAL son of Alan). The problem with Alan Michael wasn’t just that all romances in soaps are a bit… well… soapy… But that I started a sort of romance myself with the actor who dubbed him, which was a HUGE mistake because he was a NIGHTMARE. And can you imagine dubbing bed scenes moaning next to somebody you’ve planned to dump? No good. At some point Lucy meets a stalker. He rapes her and gives her HIV. Terrible stuff. But then, instead of running away, the perv starts dressing up as a woman – looking basically like Tootsie – and is hired by Lucy’s father in law as his receptionist… How come nobody noticed he was a tranvestite, God only knows. I think he eventually dies.\n\nThe scene of the rape was horrible, the first time I dubbed it I got really emotional and produced a very effective scream, but the director stopped me: “too short” she yelled through the interphone, “you’ve left her with her mouth open and no sound coming out, do it again.” I had to do it five times and by the fifth time not only I had lost my larynx but I couldnt care less about Lucy being raped, I just wanted to break for lunch.\n\nLucy and Alan Michael got married and left town. For Europe, which is the GL code for “nevercomeback land”.\n\nI thought my life in GL was over when I was asked if I could still dub children. You must know that I began my career dubbing only characters not older than 8 years. It took me a while to be considered for voices old enough to buy a drink. Anyway, it turned out there was this little girl to dub, about 7 or 8, not a big character, Phillip Spaulding’s daughter…\n\nLIZZIE SPAULDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nMy dear Lizzie, I love you. Yes, Lizzie Spaulding saved my (financial) life. I’ve been her Italian voice for 10 years now. When she arrived she was played by Hadyen Panettiere (now starring in Heros), who was so weird people in the studio called her “the dwarf”.\n\nBasically, imagine her the way she is today =>\n\nNow cut off her head and place it on the body of a 7 years old. That was little Lizzie: a totally grown up woman with a child’s body. And not only because her face and hair were always made up and styled. The way she spoke and acted weren’t child-like. She was so good she was spooky. Her being so talented was a blessing, because the writers gave her an enourmous part.\n\nBut lets talk about Lizzie’s story: She was born in Arizona, the daughter of Phillip Spaulding and his long time sweet heart Beth. The Spauldings are notorious for only caring about money and having such low moral standards the Borgias in comparison were boyscouts.\n\nAged 4, Lizzie’s parents get divorced, ok, it happens. Aged 5, she kills her mother’s lover, Karl. Nice. When she moves back to Springfield she gets leukemia. She is undoubtly a lucky girl. She almost dies but then doesn’t. Her parents go back together, then split up again. Then get back together then split up again, producing in the process several other kids whose name I cant remember, but I think there’s a James somwhere. There’s also another complicated storyline involving two princes, Edgar and Edmund (wasn’t that King Lear???) and a weird country you’ll never find on a map, called Saint Cristobal. At some point Lizzie’s mother, Beth, disappears, has amneasia, and becomes a prostitute named Lorelei, as one does. Lorelei writes a diary – intellectual prostitute, ha – that gets promptly published and circulated as soon as Beth regains her personality. And I thought MY family was weird…\n\nLizzie gets sent to college, disappears for a few months, comes back aged 16, played by Crystal Hunt, who’s my favourite Lizzie. At first I thought she was too chubby and Barbie-like, but she grew on me. And I’m so sorry she’s going to leave soon and being replaced by a new Lizzie… You get so attached to the actors you dub, it’s sad when they go. You identify with them, they become a part fo you. Luckily I’m too young to dub Maureen Garrett because I could have had a lesbian romance with myself and it woud have been weird (in fact, wouldn’t that be masturbation?)\n\nThis is Lizzie/Crystal by the way. Ciao!!!\n\nBack to the story… Lizzie’s father and her grandfather have been sleeping with the same woman, Olivia, who’s now pregnant. Lizzie doesn’t appreciate that. She sets her school on fire. I mean, you can’t deny she has got some good reasons to be pissed off but doing drugs would have been less dangerous.\n\nOnce back at the Spaulding’s mansion, Lizzie tries to kill Olivia pushing her down a staircase, fails, tries to kidnap Olivia’s baby, fails, tries to sabotage her best friend’s school play, fails, tries to steal her best friend’s boyfriend Joy Lupo (THE UGLIEST actor on daytime TV), fails, tries to “rape” Joy Lupo by drugging him, fails, tries to run her best friend over with a car, fails…\n\nPoor Lizzie, let her at least commit ONE succesful crime!\n\nOf course all this doesn’t make Lizzie very popular in town, so she’s sad because she’s so rich and lonely and everybody hates her. She sees a therapist. When she’s about to recover a bit, her father, Phillip, is sectioned in a psychiatric ward because he’s crazy. Really? The whole family is not really “there” if you ask me, they could have offered them an “en suite” at the clinic. As soon as Phillip’s released, he gets killed.\n\nChe sfiga!\n\nLizzie is desperate.\n\nPhillip had been involved in a long legal nasty fight with the Coopers, and had managed to expropriate their diner. Lizzie, looking for sympathy, decides to appoint herself owner and manager of the diner, fires the Coopers and paints the place pink. She’s crazy like a horse. But we love bitches, especially screwed up bitches with a heart. Because Lizzie does have a heart, not only she loves her dead daddy but she’s also in love with Coop, one of the Coopers (great fantasy with the names here!)\n\nCoop is CUTE and FIT, I just want Lizzie to get laid but she doesn’t, silly cow. As I don’t seem very succesful in finding a British man I should probably go to NY and check Coop out, even though I suspect he’s 10 years younger than me. Hold on, didn’t Coop have a British accent at some point, being Jenna’s son? (Jenna was English). Oh well, if Coop is British I’ll call Maureen Garrett.\n\nAnyway, that’s where we are with the story in Italy. In the US Lizzie has already forgotten Coop and got pregnant with Jonathan, who is a Lewis, a family that had never got anything to do with me, so I’m a bit shocked. The good news is, in the US they’re 2 years ahead of us, so I’m going to have at the very least two more years of Lizzie.\n\nMy mortgage officially thanks Procter and Gamble and all the Guiding Light Production Team and Writers. Thanks.\n\nAnd now, if music is the food of love, play on… But the ITALIAN way…\n\nMy dearest Bob,\n\nI decided to dedicate this post to you because it’s high time you took responsibility and acted accordingly. I know this will be tough to read but sometimes a man must be man… You’re a lion, not a lamb, so I’m sure you’ll be able to understand.\n\nPeople ask me why I’m single. Why no man seems to be good enough for me. What is it that I’m looking for. Why I never seem to like anybody enough. For years I’ve mumbled more or less acceptable excuses: I don’t do sex without love; I can’t fall in love with men without a great personality, even greater ideals and amazing looks; in my job I meet mostly women and gay guys; I don’t go out enough; I’m damn unlucky; I’m the re-incarnation of a nun who died in 1456; I’m getting older and men don’t want women whose biological clock is ticking…\n\nI’ve been psycho-analyzed by shrinks who begged me to stop looking for a man like my dad.\n\nI’ve had to endure blind dates organized by keen friends convinced I’d better drop my standards and get real.\n\nI’ve spent a fortune in internet dating, trying to persuade myself I could actually have an interest in the slightly overweight man with glasses who talked about his plans for retirement…\n\nEnough.\n\nNow the moment has come to spit out the truth: my singleness is YOUR FAULT, Bob. Yours and nobody else’s.\n\nI was just an ordinary teenager up to the age of 16. I mean, yes, I had a slight tendency to depression, I didn’t have a boyfriend, my idol was Emily Dickinson and I spent time talking to myself imagining I was somebody else. But other than that, I was a regular Italian adolescent with crush on Eros Ramazzotti (a pop singer you might not know – don’t bother looking for his CDs), Sting from the Police and a blond guy in the class above mine named Bruno who wasn’t even aware of my existence. I dressed my hair like Madonna and wore fake Nike trainers (sneakers, in your language).\n\nThis until one day I went to the cinema with my classmates Patty and Isa and watched…\n\nYou blew me away. I was overwhelmed by your beauty, charisma, character, by your eyes and your infectuous smile\n\nDennis Finch-Hutton – your character in the movie – was the man I wanted to marry. He was beautiful, warm, witty, tender and a free spirit who didn’t want to tie his woman with marriage.\n\nHe was amazing, you were amazing. Of course Dennis died at the end of the movie and I cried all my tears. But you were alive. Somewhere in the world you existed, in all your God-like beauty.\n\nExactly like Bruno from the class above, you weren’t aware of my existence. But I knew a love as big as mine wouldn’t go unnoticed. Sooner or later it’ll be returned.\n\nFrom that moment I started watching all your films. Most of your characters were like Dennis. Men with courage, strength, heart…\n\nIt could have been just a teenage crush, bound to pass with the years. But it didn’t. Quite the opposite, my adoration kept growing with time. Because it wasn’t just your characters I was in love with. It was YOU. I had bought a book about you and I used to read during my maths classes. I kept it open inside a geometry book, pretending to be looking at pictures of triangles. The book said you were very much like your characters. I had no doubts it was true. I knew it.\n\nBy 1987 I had decided I would only be happy with you, Bob, at my side. You and nobody else.\n\nEvery time I watched one of your films – Barefoot in the Park, All the President’s men,\n\nJeremiah Jones, The Candidate, The Great Gatsby, Sundance and Billy the kid, the Sting, The way we were (oh, I adore that film!) – that luckily were repeated quite regularly on Italian TV, my heart beat. Your smile made me happy. Your eyes, your profile.\n\nMy aunt kept repeating you looked like my dad but of course it’s not true, you’re blond and nobody in my family is blond.\n\nYou see, my darling, if I had chosen another idol, everything in my sentimental life would have been different and easier. Imagine I’d fallen for Tom Cruise, who was just coming to notoriety at the time: arrogant, fake smile, a penchant for science-fiction-like religion… Men like that are easy to find and even easier to get bored with. I would have got over you in a month. Harrison Ford was another of my friends’ favourite but he was also quite a common type, a hyperactive action hero with a penchant for jokes… How banal.. But you, Bob, you were unique. You didn’t run like crazy from beginning to end of a movie. Even when you did action, you took your time to think. You didn’t pilot war planes or looked for treasures in Egypt, no, you uncovered political plots. You crossed the west in the snow without talking for 45 minutes. Even when you were a maverick, you were the most delightful bastard in the whole galaxy. You were one to love forever.\n\nBut finding a man like you has proved virtually impossible. Somebody who prefers ideals to fame, peace marches to red carptes, dreams to cinism…\n\nYou settled down not in Hollywood but in Utah, using your notoriety to make a difference in the world… Now, lets be realistic here, once a woman’s standards have been set so high, there’s virtually no chance for her to ever find a regular guy and be happy. It’s the end.\n\nYou’ll say, “oh please, I’m just a regular guy…”, I bet you’ll say that, but you know it’s a lie, so don’t even try and use that cheap excuse.\n\nBob, you know I’ve been a faithful and adoring lover. Okay, with the only exception of one notorious Jamaican man, I confess, but we all make mistakes in life and I sincerely apologize – one can’t swap you with Denzel Washington, I should have known better…\n\nI’ve been discrete, reserved and dignified. I never waited for you outside a hotel, hoping for an autograph. I never screamed your name loud. It wouldn’t have suited you, you’re not some Brad Pitt…\n\nI’ve been loyal to you even when, in the mid 90s, your face began to fall apart.\n\nOther Hollywood actors had plastic surgery but not you. And I loved you even more for that. While your colleagues wasted money in villas and cosmetic treatments you set up the Sundance Festival to help young talents in the film industry. My adoration was unspeakable. I sang your praises like evangelical converts sing hymns. My friends teased me, saying you looked older than my granddad but I covered my ears. When Indecent proposal came out I thought it was a joke. A million dollars to sleep with Robert Redford? And where exactly was the problem???\n\nSince then I’ve watched you capturing terrorists, ploughing fields, horse whispering… In the meantime I’ve passed 35 and I’m still single. My friends change boyfriends more often than underwear and I’m totally unable to find a man to fall for.\n\nLast summer I even came to Utah, to Sundance, looking for you in vain but you didn’t even put a sign outside your house. Sundance is a mountain, a wood, a place covered in trees where I only managed to have pic-nic surrounded by mormons looking at me through a pair of binoculars… I’ve become an actress just to have the chance to be near you but no American director seems to notice me. I know this is quite normal considered I’ve never worked in the USA but I saw you in a picture with Monica Bellucci and my heart sank, she’s just a beauty from Perugia who in 1986 was probably a fan of Duran Duran. She didn’t deserve your attention!\n\nNo man is like you, Bob, none. Please, help me. I’m desperate. I know you’re far too old for dating me, but at least be my friend, drop me a line, give me a shoulder to cry, tell me what to do. You owe it to me. And don’t say you had no idea of my suffering because ignorance is not excuse, as you know very well.\n\nAnother year is about to end and I’m here on my own. Do something, please. Take responsibility. You care about Iraq, Afghanistan, global warming and arts…. Can’t you care a little bit about me?\n\nYour sincerely – for ever"
