        "text": "Date Owner Product Name(s) Comment 1989 SDP AMC*Designor 2.0 The first commercial is release in France by SDP (Suresne), under the name: AMC*Designor 2. The “OR” stands for Oracle, the first database targeted by SDP. 1992 SDP S-Designor 3.0 SDP expands their business abroad and publish a first version dedicated to the US market called S-Designor 3. The main reason for a different version is that the most popular analysis methodology in France at that time (MERISE) was not used in the US, hence a different set of models and features for both products. 1995 PowerSoft PowerDesigner PowerSoft acquires SDP in 1995 and renames S-Designor to PowerDesigner, for a matter of consistency with the brands PowerBuilder and Powersoft.
