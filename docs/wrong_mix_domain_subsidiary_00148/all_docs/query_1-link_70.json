(NYSE: SY), an industry leader in enterprise and mobile software and Wipro Infotech, the India and Middle East IT Business of Wipro Ltd and a leading provider of IT and business transformation services, today announced a partnership to extend SAP applications to a variety of mobile device types. With these solutions, SAP customers will be able to securely access their business-critical enterprise applications while on the move.\n\nSybase and SAP are jointly delivering co-developed solutions for extending SAP CRM and SAP Business Suite to mobile devices. SAP customers will now be able to leverage Wipro’s SAP implementation skills to customize these Sybase® Mobile Solutions for SAP, in addition to developing custom mobile applications for other SAP modules such as SRM SCM, PLM, etc. that will be directed towards areas like mobile services, mobile sales, time and travel approvals, workflows, warehouse management, asset management, etc. Wipro’s solutions will be based on Sybase® Unwired Platform (SUP), a mobile enterprise application platform that provides systems integrators, independent software vendors, and enterprise developers with the ability to easily develop, deploy and manage mobile applications. This comprehensive, yet flexible mobility infrastructure will enable enterprises to implement, manage and expand their mobile computing initiatives in a coherent, streamlined and cost-effective manner. Mobile solutions created using the Unwired Platform enable mobile workers to access business critical data anytime, from anywhere, leading to a positive impact on productivity and revenue.\n\nMr. Sunil Jose, Managing Director, India & Sub-continent, Sybase Software (India) Pvt. Ltd. said, “The Sybase & Wipro partnership will offer Wipro’s SAP customers', applications on the go. SUP supports a wide variety of popular mobile platforms. This enables true mobility for a large section of employees and not just top or middle management. Through this, SAP’s customers' will be able to create an information edge by optimizing and enhancing the infrastructure they already own, linking valuable data resources in place, and securely delivering information anytime, anywhere.”\n\nCommenting on the partnership, Sairaman Jagannathan, Vice President, Business Solutions Division, Wipro said, \"Building on our SAP partnership, this partnership with Sybase demonstrates a strong synergy between our companies as we share a common goal of providing businesses easy access to valuable information contained within enterprise applications. As Sybase's implementation partner, we will bring in tight integration with a wide range of mobile environments to ensure secure and real-time access to information. Wipro chose Sybase as a strategic partner based on the strength of its mobile enterprise application platform, rich expertise and proven leadership in the enterprise mobility space.\"\n\nAs part of this joint initiative, Wipro will set up a Center of Excellence at its research Center, Sangam, in Bangalore, where customers will be able to experience the various mobile applications developed by Wipro to mobilize SAP. This Centre of Excellence will also be used to develop newer industry frameworks that can be used across different customer verticals.\n\nMr. Sunil Jose further added, “Sybase is in the best position to support the movement away from siloed mobile applications to the mass adoption of mobility across the entire enterprise. With the growing number of end users and device types to the demand for real time access to information, our enterprise mobility platform is unrivaled in the industry. We believe our position in Gartner’s leader quadrant is a further validation of the significant advancements made to our Sybase® Unwired Platform and success in building out our partnership ecosystem”.\n\nRecently, Gartner, Inc. positioned Sybase in the Leaders quadrant in its Magic Quadrant for Mobile Enterprise Application Platforms (MEAP) report, authored by William Clark and Michael King (December 2009). “We believe that more than 95% of organizations will be choosing MEAP or packaged mobile application vendors as their primary mobile development platforms through 2012,” states the Gartner report. “From 2010 through 2013, the number of enterprises choosing multichannel MEAP vendors will rise 10% annually.”\n\nIn Related News\n\nSAP AG and Sybase today announced today announced two new solutions for mobile workers to carry out key business and customer relationship management (CRM) processes via iPhone and Windows Mobile. Built on the industry-leading Sybase® Unwired Platform, the mobile solutions extend the capabilities of SAP® Business Suite applications, including SAP® Customer Relationship Management (SAP CRM), and also can be customized to tap into a variety of back-end data sources, including databases, Web services, files and any enterprise application that leverages service-oriented architecture (SOA). The announcement was made at the CeBIT trade fair, being held in Hannover, Germany, March 2-6.\n\nSybase Unwired Platform\n\nSybase Unwired Platform leverages the vast experience Sybase has in delivering mobility to hundreds of thousands of customers and users over the last 20 years. The Unwired Platform addresses the challenge of creating and managing multiple mobile applications that securely connect a variety of heterogeneous back-end data sources to all major device types. As the enterprise landscape becomes increasingly complex, Sybase Unwired Platform enables enterprises to embrace mobility across the entire organization through the use of a consistent, but highly adaptable, development platform.\n\nAbout the Magic Quadrant\n\nThe Gartner Magic Quadrant is copyrighted 2009 by Gartner, Inc., and is reused with permission.
