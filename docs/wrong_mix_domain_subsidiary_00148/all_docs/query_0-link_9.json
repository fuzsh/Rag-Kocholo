        "text": "Sybase, Inc. announced it has signed an agreement to acquire the assets of privately held Dejima, a provider of mobile access solutions using natural language interface technology. Sybase intends to integrate the assets of Dejima into its iAnywhere Solutions subsidiary, and expects to complete the cash transaction in the second quarter of 2004. The Dejima product uses natural language processing and adaptive agent technologies to allow end users to interact with information sources using common, colloquial language. Inquiries can be made using nearly any communications method (email, SMS, voice, instant messaging, etc.) or device (landline or mobile phone, PDA, laptop, PC, etc.). Sybase plans to leverage the Dejima technology to add natural spoken and text access through common messaging interfaces to backend systems such as databases and enterprise applications. www.dejima.com, www.sybase.com\n\nInxight Software, Inc. announced Inxight TimeWall, a visual timeline analysis tool. TimeWall provides users with the ability to see the bigger picture of the information at hand and allows them to focus on and interact with specific, important data points. TimeWall displays data on an interactive, three-dimensional “wall”, that allows analysts and other decision-makers to view huge data sets on one screen, at the same time giving them the ability to focus on specific areas of interest. This ability ensures that the context of the entire data set is not lost. When the user spots a cluster of activity, a simple click moves that period of time into focus, allowing the user to see the specifics of the events what happened in what order and includes links to the original information source. Users can also filter views to show only the data that is of specific interest to them. TimeWall will be available as a component of Inxight VizServer. Inxight TimeWall is available immediately. www.inxight.com\n\nXpriori announced the expansion of its operation and the availability of Xpriori’s NeoCore XMS version 3.0.
