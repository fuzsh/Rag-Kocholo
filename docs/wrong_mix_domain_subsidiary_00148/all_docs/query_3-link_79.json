        "text": "All you need to do is develop an app one time (and we use a lot of the old PowerSoft technology). You develop the app one time and deploy, because we will write the device-specific code. You could deploy it on a Blackberry as easy as you could deploy it on an iPhone.\n\nThat’s where our technology called the Sybase Unwired Platform comes in, which is both development and deployment. We take the traditional database customer and go in and say: “I’ll sell you analytics, because you’ve got all this data and you need to analyze it.” Okay, good, that’s obvious. “By the way, if you ever use devices, I will sell you the server to manage all these devices.”\n\nTo the telco people that are using messaging, I say, “Well, I’m going to sell you analytics, also. But this time, I’m going to sell you analytics to analyze your traffic. Don’t you want to know where your traffic comes from? By the way, why am I uniquely qualified? I do one 1.2 billion SMSs a day.” Sybase has four NOCs [network operation centers] around the world. We’re the largest non-operators in terms of managing messaging traffic. So I have all the data.\n\nSo if you’re Verizon, you say: “Hey, you know, I’m paying an awful lot of termination fees. Where the hell is the data coming in from Europe? Is it from Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom? What is it? Is it from Greek Telecom? Where shall I provision my systems? Where is the highest margin traffic that I want?”\n\nI am providing that right now. I am doing as much cross-selling as I can. We were successful in doing that in a number of places. But I was able to sell infrastructure software to Verizon by saying, “Hey, I’ve got this layer called device management in the server. So Verizon, how about you build a [device management] business for small-to-medium enterprises, and do it hosting on my software?”\n\nNext page: The future of mobile\n\nThe future of mobile\n\nGallant: John, since you see the direction for this mobile market, talk about what you think enterprises aren’t thinking about today that they ought to be thinking about. If you’re leading IT, and you see all this coming down the road, what should they be doing that they’re not doing today regarding mobility?\n\nChen: Today their [concept of] mobility is still by and large an information delivery mechanism. E-mail is a perfect thing. But you know, it’s not really an action-based platform.\n\nSo what does that mean? Well, taking a cell phone and paying for something is action-based. I don’t think there’s a serious push yet into payment, remittance — that whole area of the mobile commerce world.\n\nWe will have to clear a couple of hurdles to get there. Government regulations are a huge hurdle, but it will be fixed, because otherwise Western Union couldn’t have been in business for 150 years. It will be fixed. And there’s a big fight between the telephone company and the banks — who owns the wallet. Now that fight is somewhat political; different countries have different regulatory environments. It will be interesting.\n\nWe provide mobile unwired technology to Celcom in Malaysia, for example. In Malaysia you can trade minutes with 13 different telecoms in Southeast Asian countries using our technology. You can buy things. You can give people money or something of monetary worth, like minutes.\n\nSo that whole area – the machine-to-machine, point-to point-of-action space – is still in a very, very early stage of life. Partly because the high-end PDAs – about 13% of all the devices out there – are still relatively expensive. I could use my Web-based phone (which you could probably buy for 15 bucks) for SMSs and all that. I could use it to tell a bank to deposit something. I could do that, but I can’t really do a hell of a lot more than that. And so these high-end devices need to become cheaper. It’s a matter of time. Very shortly in the near future you’ll be able to buy PDAs very cheap.\n\nKnorr: I wanted to ask you about your messaging technology. You’re seeing a growing amount of revenue from enterprises using that. What are they using it for?\n\nChen: Okay. Some good examples come from a big name: Proctor and Gamble. They commissioned us for a number of their brands in a number of countries — it started with Philippines — to do a customer loyalty program.\n\nLet’s just start with diaper business. You’re a mom. So Proctor and Gamble gets you to register as a user, and then you enter your kid’s name, birth date, blah, blah, blah. You know, all this pertinent information.\n\nIn return, they will send you more than information about the products, they will send information about how to raise a kid. Not just a coupon, although a coupon is part of that. So you get an electronic coupon from your mobile phone. You could actually walk into a store and redeem that, and now they know, they are now tracking your needs, because your kids are growing up, right?\n\nGallant: So they don’t even have to rely on the retailer because they’re getting that information directly from the consumer.\n\nChen: These are all carried by the SMS technologies. Now, when location-dependent code is on, then they actually know where you are.\n\nGallant: That’s a little scary.\n\nChen: Well, you have to be allowed. I mean this is an opt-in thing. And then, if you walk by a store, they will send you an SMS and say — oh, by the way, if you turn left and you turn right and walk three steps, you have a new product for today. For the next hour, you get it for half price.\n\nGallant: That’s great.\n\nChen: And you have the ID on the mobile phone. Now, when this becomes a wallet — not there yet — you could just scan that and then the whole electronic coupon would go through.\n\nGallant: So are they working with a service provider on that or do they work directly with you to handle that?\n\nChen: It’s a three-party thing. Their marketing organization comes up with the algorithm. A service they work with provides a lot of these outreach and signing-up people. And then they work with us as a transport. So they basically say: “Here’s a bunch of IP numbers or phone numbers and here’s the message I want to send them. ” And, we go send them.\n\nGallant: Are there any other examples that you can cite, because I think this will be very interesting to people.\n\nChen: Every time you buy a Nokia phone, you have to initiate the phone using SMS. And they will download all kinds of stuff. Do you want music on it? Do you want stock quotes? All kinds of services. That’s how you configure of a new phone.\n\nI could give you literally tons and tons of examples. CitiGroup uses it for fraud detection on credit cards. You’re sitting here; your card is being used in Brazil buying washers and dryers. If you opt in, they know exactly what’s going on. You can’t possibly be doing that.\n\nNext page: Analytics gains respect\n\nAnalytics gains respect\n\nGallant: I want to spend a little bit of time looking at the different markets you’re in and what the differentiators are. If you take the analytics market, how would you define Sybase’s key differentiator? What makes you different from SAS, Oracle, IBM, any of these players that are in the analytics BI market?\n\nChen: Price-performance. And the reason it is price performance is because of a patented technology. This again is one thing that I cannot claim credit for. When I started, we had already bought a company called Expressway two years before I came. They have a column-based architecture. What a column-based architecture is good for is to be able to sort out…massive amounts of data and to look for certain relationships without having to create a lot of temporary disk storage.\n\nNow, for many, many years – until the last three years – people have been fixated on generating records. Analyzing the relationships between records has not been top of mind. The people who really need that are the Toys’R’Us and Walmarts of the world. They’re doing pricing models and SKU tracking and all that. They buy big from Teradata.\n\nBut that’s very bleeding edge. We have a departmental solution that is much, much cheaper and much, much, much faster than anybody else. Slowly but surely, we have, like, 2,000 customers around the world.\n\nThe first breakthrough was actually the Patriot Act. That brought awareness to the banks. They said, “I’ve got to find a way to do this more real-time. I can’t run it as a batch every day at 4:14. This has got to be done in about ten minutes or so.” And so, that brings the first wave on.\n\nThen, gradually, as the market gets more sophisticated, it gets into all kinds of things, like pricing. People who want to sort large amount of data. Billing, for example. Our architecture is good for it. It requires less storage it’s much faster – near real-time.\n\nKnorr: Do you think there’s a revolution going on now in the analytics market with columnar and NoSQL databases – particularly putting that stuff on the cloud, with all that extensibility and scalability?\n\nChen: I don’t know whether I would use the word “revolutionary.” I think it’s finally gained respect.\n\nKnorr: Do you think there’ll be a broader range of applications now? Because it’s a relatively small market right now, right?\n\nChen: Yes. Absolutely.\n\nKnorr: It’s very also very specialized, because only a limited number of people really know how to use analytics to its advantage. Do you think there’ll be broader user interfaces that are more suitable to business analysts, that kind of stuff?\n\nChen: Absolutely. Here’s the reason why: What drove our success in the last couple of years, after all this compliance reporting and stuff, was risk management. Enterprise risk management is in the board room of every company right now. In fact, I think the new SEC rules require the board to be aware of enterprise risk.\n\nColumn-based architectures are extremely well suited for these kinds of applications. So in the last two years, we came up with something called the Risk Analytics Platform. We brought a bunch of traders in who understand how it works, and they helped us design this on top of our analytics engine.\n\nAnd then, most recently, you probably have seen that we invested in something called complex event processing. That’s to graph data, structured and unstructured, to bounce against these templates and the backend trading data, the account data, to create a risk profile on a near-real-time basis. So if your users had deployed that three years ago you could probably have avoided the counterparty risk issue that the market has seen.\n\nSo the answer to your question is: Yes, it gets into mainstream apps now because this fundamental architecture allows these large amounts of data to be analyzed, and analyzed at high speed. This is a new requirement: real-time analytics and real-time needs.\n\nI was with some customers on Wall Street last weekend. It’s very easy; everybody does risk management. I mean risk profiling has been done since the mainframe existed. So what’s the big deal? I mean we all of a sudden sound so intelligent because there was a crisis and the blow-up and all that.\n\nThat’s not it. There are two things that have changed. Number one, the priority of risk management has gone to the boardroom from the analytics department buried under the CFO. Number two, the real-time requirement and the reporting requirement [to send risk information to] the government is new – and rightfully so. We now realize how esoteric the instruments are in the financial world.\n\nSo you could take that example, and you could put it in health care, you could put it in securities, in businesses, in government. It could be in energy trading. It could be in grid distributions. We sold a lot of analytics servers to the China National Grid. And they use that to manage the grid. They don’t have enough power, period. So somebody needed to manage the provisioning of that, and all this data that’s coming in rapidly.\n\nNext page: Is BI BS?\n\nIs BI BS?\n\nGallant: Why do you think when you talk to customers there’s this lingering perception that analytics and BI haven’t lived up to the promise? It’s as if this stuff is always on the verge of really transforming business, but we never really quite get there. Why is that?\n\nChen: Number one, it’s the culture of IT customers. They want things to be very easy and turnkey, but anything easy and turnkey is basically reporting. So they figure that — why am I spending all these hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not a million dollars, for a better graphical pie chart? I mean, that’s wonderful, but Excel could do that too.\n\nSo I think their view of analytics is that it does not live up to expectation to get the meaty, substantive stuff. But in order to get the meaty, substantive stuff, you have to invest heavily in the algorithm you’re going to use.\n\nNow some of the industry loves that. It relies on that. Who are they? Insurance people. If they don’t have analytics, they die. I mean, that’s how they decide how to price things, in what segment of the market, what demographics, how old you are, East coast, West coast. I mean, there’s no point in offering jet skiing insurance to people in the middle of Alaska. I mean, they live on those models.\n\nMost other people haven’t got that sophistication. All they get is — they buy from a BI company and say — oh boy, let’s see what I can do. Let’s say I buy Informatica, tie it to a database, and then somehow it generates a bunch of data. And then it gets displayed using Hyperion, Business Objects, Cognos, whatever, and it looks great on the screen. The cost is too high for that functionality. It doesn’t really tell me a whole lot. And that’s the problem.\n\nI think the BI market and the analytics market are attempting to become a quick-deployment proposition. So they made it too simple, they made it too template-driven, they made it too model-driven. Now, the truth of the matter is, people like SPSS, because customers really believe there’s a secret sauce. And SAS is not bad; SAS is a great company. So the culture of the market is now maturing. This is not about a spreadsheet displaying on the screen so I can show my boss all the good stuff. This is really about: What is the intelligence on what customers are telling us? What is the market telling us?\n\nGallant: Is part of that answer that there may be a fair number of companies out there whose business just doesn’t really require analytics like an insurance company’s business requires it?\n\nChen: There is some level of that, but I think I could make an argument that every business, because it’s competitive, requires analytics. Just know about your customer and know about your market and know more about who will buy what. And that isn’t limited to insurance companies.\n\nNext page: Telcos in the cloud\n\nTelcos in the cloud\n\nKnorr: We recently interviewed John Chambers at Cisco. It’s very clear he’s making a big bet on the cloud. It’s also very clear that Chambers has telcos top of mind as important partners. So you’re in with the telcos. Tell us what you think the role of the telcos is in cloud computing.\n\nChen: Every telco is talking about the cloud. I don’t think I met a telco executive who didn’t use that word in the first five sentences. And I’ve been on record saying that this is about the only area in which Larry Ellison and I are kind of aligned. My team always advises me not to say that. [laughter]\n\nThe majority of my customers have already been using a local cloud, a proprietary private cloud environment. All my trading systems around the world are clouds. You need to get to the definition of — what does the company do? You need a definition of the cloud.\n\nI have no idea why you guys are so excited about it. Isn’t everybody’s using it and doing it? The answer is yes. Because every time you have backup data centers, and you don’t care where your application runs, and the application has no idea where it’s getting the data and which processors are being initiated, that’s a cloud.\n\nKnorr: That’s the private cloud.\n\nChen: That’s the private cloud. The second level of cloud is the hosting cloud. I have a cloud computing environment by allowing you to send me your SMS messages and route them through my network, and you don’t where the hell that is. Because my network actually grows with the telco; because a lot of times I use the telco platforms. So I don’t actually have all the servers. I have a lot of the servers to stage the traffic, but I don’t have all the servers. Sometimes I give it to Vodafone and Vodafone will deliver it to Deutsche Telekom. Sometimes I give it to Sprint and Sprint will give it to AT&T. And sometimes I give it to China Mobile and they will give it to Telstra in Australia.\n\nSo that’s a real cloud. And arguably, that’s what Salesforce.com does, and that’s a cloud. And in my mind, that probably is the most real definition of the cloud, because you can see what the customer gets from it and you can see who makes the money. If you can identify those two — why people use it and who makes the money out of it — at least you have sustainability. So we have that cloud. Our messaging network’s our cloud. And we’re going to put more and more…we’re going to put analytics on the cloud, we’re going to put…\n\nGallant: Well, let’s talk about that. So how does the product strategy evolve to embrace cloud?\n\nChen: There are some basic technology requirements in every piece of software that goes on a network of computers — you may or may not know where it is and you don’t really care. Multi-tenancy is a clear one. And it’s a simple idea, right? Then there’s the ability to do tracking and billables. You have to be able to bill. So those are all common functionalities in what we have done. We are committed as a company. Every piece of our software, database, analytics, mobile server, will all be cloudable, will all be cloud compliant. So you have all the multi-tenanted functions.\n\nThe final cloud is the EC2 type cloud, in which basically you say: I’m going to rent computing time. Telcos love to do that. You’re renting; that’s the data version of the voice we all grew up with. You could pick up the phone and keep calling; they just count how far and how long you call. And that’s what telco wants.\n\nWhen a telco wants to be in cloud computing. That’s what it means. They don’t care what application it is. Now, they may offer some of their own. Verizon wants to do it; AT&T is doing it with Symphony. All those guys are doing it. So that’s why Chambers is very focused on that, because that’s the only environment where you could see who’s going to make money and how the audience or the user benefits from it.\n\nThen there’s Amazon.com. Amazon — I don’t want to piss them off publicly, right? But it’s hard to see how they’re going to make money in the long-term with that model. And the reason is that — how many real serious enterprise compute entities will use a public cloud for their day-to-day operations? I find that a little hard to correlate.\n\nGallant: Do you think enterprises will do analytics in the cloud?\n\nChen: Yes, I think they should.\n\nGallant: If they’re concerned about security, why would they?\n\nChen: Well, I think analytics in the cloud is not going to be — you’re not going to get the true copy of all data at the same time.\n\nGallant: I’m not sure I understand what that means.\n\nChen: That means analytics can function very well working on a representative set of data and some of the changes to that data. They don’t need all the accurate pieces of data and they don’t need all of the data. So there is a limited exposure — other than the privacy issue. If they put your bank account on it, that’s a privacy issue. But I would argue that when you have a sensitive security issue like that, then people won’t put in on the public cloud. And that further enhances my argument that it’s difficult to see how the public cloud could be prosperous.\n\nGallant: Not even when you use the cloud to open up analytics to the whole mid market or small business, where today most of those customers can’t afford it?\n\nChen: We are doing that. We are trying to rent analytics on our own network. So people would basically dial in and pay us and we’ll host the apps. And then people will pay us for what they use.\n\nKnorr: Are you working towards a seamless extension of your licensed products, so you have them running locally, and then you could extend into the cloud if you need additional capacity or functionality?\n\nChen: Not yet. I hear what you’re saying. Not yet. The answer is: We need to. Today you have our license and we’re going to have to work with you to see how you could extend it into a cloud environment. And the reason that is — and it’s a selfish reason — the industry hasn’t sorted itself out on how much you charge for that.\n\nIt’s not zero. Because if it’s zero, I have a business problem. You cannot buy one copy, put it in a cloud, and have two million people using it. Now, conversely, the old days of selling you two million copies are gone, too. I’m not stupid enough to think that if I stuck my head in the sand that somehow, somewhere, the good old days are going to return. I’m realistic enough. So I said “not yet,” because you basically hit the very reason why: An established software company can’t afford to give it away.\n\nNow, do we have to deal with it? Absolutely. Why? Because if we don’t deal with it, somebody will deal with it, and we’re going to be left out in the cold. And we don’t want that. So it’s a challenging topic. We know we have to do something.\n\nThe way I position this is that Sybase has a pay-as-you-go model and a buy-and-own-it model. I say it that way because that kind of defines the way I do business. I have not allowed the two to cross yet, which is your question. I will have to, and we’re working on it, because we have no choice. I mean the customers will demand it and eventually it will happen.\n\nKnorr: Not there yet.\n\nChen: We’re not there. And the industry is not there. By the way, if you guys know any clever idea, please do call me and let me know. And I’ll be very, very grateful, because nobody has figured this out yet.\n\nGallant: Microsoft is working on it. Sort of Office here/Office there kind of licensing.\n\nChen: Yes. Microsoft has a little different scenario than we do. But you’re right. Partly because if they don’t do it, the Google/OpenOffice stuff will hit them anyway. Arguably I could get a Google e-mail address and I could just use OpenOffice software – and I could use it collaboratively, too. I mean that’s the beautiful thing about the Google thing, because you and I could be working on the same thing together.\n\nNext page: Parting words\n\nParting words\n\nGallant: So John, a one-sentence answer. What should people expect from Sybase in 2010? What should customers expect? What’s the message for the year?\n\nChen: I guess the answer is they expect too much. [laughter]\n\nI’ll give you a little bit. I mean they really expect us to deliver on our vision. They are looking to us as a leader, especially in mobile enterprise computing. And we are a leader today. Ten years ago when I first did this, it was so easy. I tried to explain to people and nobody cares, nobody listens to me. They thought I was crazy. Some people who are friends of mine even told me, “Hey, John, you’re taking your eye off the ball; you’re going to drive this company to the ground.”\n\nNow I knew that if I continued with being the fourth or fifth player in the market, eventually this thing would run out of steam. Life should be more interesting than that. So I said — we’ve got to win on something.\n\nNow today, things are so positive, everybody is expecting a lot. But I think people need to understand that trends need to develop and it’s not a one-party thing. If it’s a big enough trend, there’ll be a lot of parties involved. And that’s going to be hard to navigate, but it’s a huge reward at the end. So there needs to be a certain level of patience.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean that we don’t make progress. We’ve been making progress for three record years in a row. We’re going to continue to make progress. I think, to be honest, I think people respect us having a record year. I mean a record year in a lot of things, not only financially, but in technologies and breakthroughs and all that. You talked to Cisco; you know a lot of the things that I talk about, they talk about. They may be coming at it from the point of telecom, in a network-centric way. I come at it from the software, infrastructure, server way. But we’re both going after unified communications. That’s the new world.\n\nGallant: That’s absolutely true.\n\nChen: We’re both going after that. I mean they even talked to me about it. Everybody’s going after that.\n\nGallant: Well you should talk to him, because he’s losing all his other partners really fast. And he might want to work with you more closely."
