Consistent with software industry practice, we do not\n\nsell or transfer title to our software products to our customers. Instead,\n\ncustomers generally purchase non-exclusive, nontransferable perpetual licenses\n\nin exchange for a fee that varies depending on the mix of products and services,\n\nthe number and type of users, the number of servers, and the type of operating\n\nsystem. License fees range from several hundred dollars for single user desktop\n\nproducts to several million dollars for solutions that can support hundreds or\n\nthousands of users. We also license many of our products for use in connection\n\nwith customer applications on the Internet. Our products and services are\n\noffered in a wide variety of configurations depending on each customer's needs\n\nand hardware environment.\n\nDistribution Method. All Sybase products and services generally are sold\n\nthrough direct sales organizations and indirect sales channels. \"Indirect\n\nchannels\" include VARs, SIs, OEMs, international distributors and other\n\nresellers.\n\nInternational Business. In 2001, forty-two percent (42%) of the Company's\n\ntotal revenues were from international operations, with European operations\n\naccounting for 27% of total revenues, and intercontinental operations\n\n(principally Asia Pacific (including Japan) and South America) accounting for\n\n15% of total revenues. Most of our international sales are made by foreign\n\nsubsidiaries. However, certain sales are made in international markets from the\n\nUnited States. We also license our products through distributors in those\n\nregions. A summary of our geographical revenues is set forth in \"Management's\n\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n(MD&A) -- Geographical Revenues\", Part II, Item 7, and Note Ten to the\n\nConsolidated Financial Statements, Part II, Item 8, incorporated here by\n\nreference. For a discussion of the risks associated with our foreign operations,\n\nsee \"MD&A -- Future Operating Results -- International Operations,\" Part II,\n\nItem 7, incorporated here by reference.\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\nWe rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, patent and trademark\n\nlaws, as well as contractual terms, to protect our intellectual property rights.\n\nAs of March 22, 2002, we had 57 issued patents that expire in approximately 17\n\nyears from the date they are issued. These patents cover various aspects of our\n\ntechnology.\n\n5\n\nWe believe that our patents and other intellectual property rights have value,\n\nbut no single patent is essential to Sybase as a whole. Additionally, any of our\n\nproprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or may not\n\nprovide significant competitive advantage. For a discussion of additional risks\n\nassociated with our intellectual property, see \"MD&A -- Future Operating\n\nResults -- Intellectual Property,\" Part II, Item 7, incorporated here by\n\nreference.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nSince inception, we have made substantial investments in research and\n\nproduct development. We believe that timely development of new products and\n\nenhancements to our existing products is essential to maintaining a strong\n\nposition in our market. During 2001, we invested $125.4 million, or 14% of our\n\ntotal revenue in research and development. We intend to continue to invest\n\nheavily in these areas. However, future operations could be affected if we fail\n\nto timely enhance existing products or introduce new products to meet customer\n\ndemands. For a further discussion of the risks associated with product\n\ndevelopment, see \"MD&A -- Future Operating Results -- Product Development,\" Part\n\nII, Item 7, incorporated here by reference. As is common in the software\n\nindustry, our backlog is typically small and is not material to an understanding\n\nof our business.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe market for our products and services is fast-paced, extremely\n\ncompetitive, and is marked by dynamic customer demands, short product life\n\ncycles, and the rapid emergence of the Internet marketplace. For a discussion of\n\nthe risks associated with competition, see \"MD&A -- Future Operating\n\nResults -- Competition,\" Part II, Item 7, incorporated here by reference.\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nAs of March 22, 2002, Sybase and its subsidiaries had 4,639 employees.\n\nInformation regarding our executive officers is included in \"Executive\n\nOfficers of the Registrant,\" at the end of Part I of this Report.\n\nITEM 2.

During\n\n2001, we leased approximately 446,000 square feet in Emeryville. The leases for\n\nour Dublin facilities are due to expire in 2017 and have two five-year renewal\n\noptions under the lease, generally at the fair market value. For a further\n\ndiscussion regarding the Dublin lease, see Note Six to the Consolidated\n\nFinancial Statements, Part II, Item 8, incorporated here by reference.\n\nWe continue to maintain an engineering center in Milpitas, California,\n\nwhere we lease approximately 10,350 square feet of office space through 2003.

During that year, we also completed a\n\nsale/leaseback transaction and executed a five-year lease extension on two other\n\nbuildings in Concord. The leases for all three buildings expire in June 2006. In\n\n1999, we sold a building consisting of approximately 10,500 square feet located\n\nin Maidenhead, England.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\n\nOF OPERATIONS\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWe reported net loss of ($25.5) million for 2001, compared to net income of\n\n$72.1 million for 2000. Our decrease in profitability primarily resulted from a\n\n$34.4 million (4%) decrease in revenues; an increase of $33.6 million in\n\namortization and in-process research and development primarily from our 2001\n\nacquisition of New Era of Networks (NEN); and a $49.5 million increase in\n\nrestructuring costs offset by a $9.0 million decrease in the provision for\n\nincome taxes. The affect of these changes was partially offset by a decrease in\n\ncertain operating expenses as a result of a company-wide restructuring program\n\ninitiated in April 2001 in connection with our acquisition of NEN and after\n\nannouncement that our first quarter and 2001 revenues would be below\n\nexpectations (2001 Plan). The 2001 Plan, which was aimed at eliminating certain\n\npersonnel, assets and facilities, aligning resources and streamlining Company\n\ncosts, resulted in the elimination of approximately $115 million from our\n\nongoing yearly cost structure. See Note Thirteen to the Consolidated Financial\n\nStatements, Part II, Item 8, incorporated here by reference.\n\nDespite the decline in profitability in 2001, our financial position\n\nremains strong. As of December 31, 2001, we had $343.2 million in cash, cash\n\nequivalents and cash investments, and stockholders' equity of $716.5 million.\n\nDays sales outstanding in accounts receivable was 71 days for the quarter ended\n\nDecember 31, 2001.\n\nWe are organized into five separate business segments, two of which are\n\nmajority owned subsidiaries, each focused on one of five key market segments --\n\nEnterprise Solutions Division (ESD), e-Business Division (eBD), Business\n\nIntelligence Division (BID), iAnywhere Solutions, Inc. (iAS), formerly our\n\nMobile and Embedded Computing division and Financial Fusion, Inc. (FFI). For a\n\ndiscussion of each of these segments, see \"Business,\" Part I, Item I, and Note\n\nTen to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Part II, Item 8, incorporated here\n\nby reference. We periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to\n\nthe allowance for doubtful accounts, capitalized software, investments,\n\nintangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, litigation and other\n\ncontingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other\n\nassumptions that we believed to be reasonable based on the specific\n\ncircumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about\n\nthe carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily\n\napparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally\n\naccepted accounting principles. These accounting principals require management\n\nto make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\n\nliabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date\n\nof the financial statements. Our management is also required to make certain\n\njudgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the\n\nreporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates including those\n\nrelating to revenue recognition, the allowance for doubtful accounts,\n\ncapitalized software, investments, intangible assets, income taxes,\n\nrestructuring, litigation and other contingencies. We base our estimates on\n\nhistorical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be\n\nreasonable based on the specific circumstances, the results of which form the\n\nbasis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and\n\nliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results\n\ncould differ from these estimates.\n\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies impact the most\n\nsignificant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated\n\nfinancial statements:\n\n- Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex. We\n\nfollow very specific and detailed guidance in measuring revenue. Certain\n\njudgments, however, affect the application of our revenue policy.\n\n11\n\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2,\n\n\"Software Revenue Recognition,\" as amended by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9, and\n\nin certain instances in accordance with SOP 81-1, \"Accounting for\n\nPerformance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts.\"\n\nWe license software under non-cancelable license agreements. License fees\n\nrevenues are recognized when a non-cancelable license agreement is in\n\nforce, the product has been shipped, the license fee is fixed or\n\ndeterminable, and collection is reasonably assured. If the fee is not\n\nfixed or determinable, revenue is recognized as payments become due from\n\nthe customer. In software arrangements that include rights to multiple\n\nsoftware products and/or services, we allocate the total arrangement fee\n\namong each of the deliverables using the \"residual\" method, under which\n\nrevenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on vendor-specific\n\nobjective evidence of fair value of such undelivered elements, and the\n\nresidual revenue is allocated to delivered elements.\n\nFees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally\n\nrecognized upon shipment, provided the above criteria are met, payment of\n\nthe license fees are not dependent upon the performance of the services,\n\nand the consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the\n\nlicensed software. If the services are essential to the functionality of\n\nthe software, or payment of license fees is dependent on performance of\n\nservices, both the software license and consulting fees are recognized\n\nunder the \"percentage of completion\" method of contract accounting. Under\n\nthis method, management is required to estimate the number of hours needed\n\nto complete a particular project, and revenues and profits are recognized\n\nas the contract progresses to completion.\n\nWe recognize sublicense fees as reported to us by our licensees. License\n\nfees revenue for certain application development and data access tools are\n\nrecognized upon direct shipment to the end user or direct shipment to the\n\nreseller for the end user. If collection is not reasonably assured,\n\nrevenue is recognized only when the fee is collected.\n\nMaintenance and support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of\n\nthe related agreements, which in most cases is one year. Revenues from\n\nconsulting services under time and materials contracts and for training\n\nare recognized as services are performed. Revenues from other contract\n\nservices are generally recognized under the \"percentage of completion\"\n\nmethod of contract accounting described above. In order to apply the\n\npercentage of completion of method, management is required to estimate the\n\nnumber of hours needed to complete a particular project. As a result,\n\nrecognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions as the contract\n\nprogresses to completion.\n\n- Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets, which have generally resulted from our\n\nbusiness combinations accounted for as purchases, are recorded at\n\namortized cost. We periodically review the carrying amounts of these\n\nintangible assets for indications of impairment based on the operational\n\nperformance of the acquired businesses and market conditions. If\n\nindications of impairment are present, we assess the value of the\n\nintangible assets using estimates of future undiscounted cash flows.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2001, various restructuring activities as\n\nwell as the overall economic conditions signaled an indication of\n\nimpairment. We then analyzed the value of our various intangibles by\n\ncomparing the carrying value of these assets to the undiscounted cash\n\nflows estimated to be generated by these assets. Based on this analysis\n\nthere was no impairment during 2001. Future events could cause us to\n\nconclude that impairment indicators exist and that intangible assets\n\nassociated with acquired businesses are impaired. Beginning in 2002, the\n\nmethod for assessing potential impairments of intangibles will change\n\nbased on new accounting rules issued by the Financial Accounting Standards\n\nBoard (FASB), and related implementation guidance. We estimate that these\n\nnew rules will result in an impairment loss of approximately $150 million\n\nin the first quarter of 2002. This loss will be recognized as a cumulative\n\neffect of an accounting change.\n\n12\n\n- Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected\n\nnon-collection of accounts receivable based on past collection history and\n\nspecific risks identified in our portfolio of receivables. If the\n\nfinancial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an\n\nimpairment of their ability to make payments, or if payments from\n\ncustomers are significantly delayed, additional allowances might be\n\nrequired.\n\n- Capitalized Software\n\nWe capitalize certain software development costs after establishment of a\n\nproduct's technological feasibility. Such costs are then amortized over\n\nthe estimated life of the related product. Periodically, we compare a\n\nproduct's unamortized capitalized cost to the product's net realizable\n\nvalue. To the extent unamortized capitalized cost exceeds net realizable\n\nvalue based on the product's estimated future gross revenues, reduced by\n\nthe estimated future costs of completing and disposing of the product, the\n\nexcess is written off. This analysis requires us to estimate future gross\n\nrevenues associated with certain products, and the future costs of\n\ncompleting and disposing of certain products. If these estimates change,\n\nwrite-offs of capitalized software costs could result.\n\n- Income Taxes\n\nWe use the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes. This\n\nmethodology recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the\n\nexpected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the\n\ncarrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities. We then\n\nrecord a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount\n\nthat likely will be realized. We consider future taxable income and\n\nongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need\n\nfor the valuation allowance. If we determined during any period that we\n\ncould realize a larger net deferred tax asset than the recorded amount, we\n\nwould adjust the deferred tax asset to increase income for the period.\n\nConversely, if we determine that we would be unable to realize a portion\n\nof our recorded deferred tax asset, we would adjust the deferred tax asset\n\nto record a charge to income for the period.\n\n- Restructuring\n\nDuring 2001, we recorded significant accruals in connection with our\n\nrestructuring program. These accruals included estimated costs to settle\n\ncertain lease obligations, and were generally based on the analysis of\n\nindependent real estate consultants. While we do not anticipate\n\nsignificant changes to these estimates, the actual costs may differ from\n\nthe estimates. If we are unable to negotiate affordable termination fees\n\nor if rental rates continue to decrease in the markets where the\n\nproperties are located, or it takes us longer then expected to find\n\nsuitable sublease tenants, the actual costs could exceed our estimates.\n\n- Contingencies and Litigation\n\nWe are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits and claims relating to\n\nproduct, technology, labor, shareholder and other matters. We are required\n\nto assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range\n\nof probable losses in these matters. The amount of loss accrual, if any,\n\nis determined after careful analysis of each matter, and is subject to\n\nadjustment if warranted by new developments or revised strategies.\n\n13\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nREVENUES\n\n2001 CHANGE 2000 CHANGE 1999\n\n------ ------ ------ ------ ------\n\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\n\nLicense fees....................................... $389.0 (17%) $468.5 11% $421.6\n\nPercentage of total revenues..................... 42% 49% 48%\n\nServices........................................... $537.1 9% $492.0 9% $450.0\n\nPercentage of total revenues..................... 58% 51% 52%\n\nTotal revenues..................................... $926.1 (4%) $960.5 10% $871.6\n\nTotal revenues for 2001 decreased 4 percent from total revenues in 2000\n\n(which had increased 10 percent over 1999). The decrease in 2001 from 2000 was\n\nprimarily due to a decline in license fees revenues as a result of a weaker\n\neconomy, and partially offset by an increase in our technical support services\n\nrevenues resulting from an overall increase in our installed base. This increase\n\nwas partially attributable to our 2001 acquisition of NEN and its customer base.\n\nThe increase in 2000 from 1999 was due to growth in both our license revenue and\n\ntechnical support revenue.\n\nLicense fees revenues in 2001 decreased 17 percent over 2000 license fees\n\nrevenues (which had increased 11 percent over 1999). The decrease in 2001 was\n\nlargely due to decreased sales of our enterprise database and enterprise\n\napplication products. This resulted from a weakened economy in which customers\n\ndelayed or canceled many infrastructure investments requiring significant\n\ndollars and resources. Existing Sybase products and products acquired through\n\nthe acquisition of NEN were equally affected by this phenomenon. From a segment\n\nstandpoint, enterprise database revenues were primarily captured by ESD, while\n\nenterprise application revenues were primarily captured by eBD. The increase in\n\nlicense fees revenues in 2000 was primarily due to increased sales of our ESD\n\nenterprise database, eBD enterprise application products, and iAS mobile\n\ndatabase products.\n\nServices revenues (derived from technical support, education and\n\nprofessional services) grew 9 percent in 2001 over 2000 (which had increased 9\n\npercent over 1999). The increase in 2001 was primarily due to a 19 percent\n\nincrease in technical support revenues. Partially offsetting this increase was a\n\n5 percent decrease in education and professional services revenues for 2001\n\ncompared to 2000. The decrease was partially due to the economic factors\n\ndiscussed above, and partly due to our 2001 Plan, which reduced professional\n\nservices headcount to de-emphasize building future capacity, and to focus\n\ninstead on current profitable engagements.\n\nThe increase in services revenues during 2000 was attributable to a 10\n\npercent increase in revenues from technical support and an 8 percent increase in\n\nprofessional services revenues. The increase in technical support revenues was\n\nprimarily due to an increase in our installed base, and the increase in\n\nprofessional services which primarily resulted from our 2000 acquisition of HFN\n\n(now FFI).\n\nFor a discussion of our services, see \"Business -- Worldwide Services,\"\n\nPart I, Item 1, incorporated here by reference. As a percentage of total\n\nrevenues, our services revenues increased to 58 percent in 2001 from 51 percent\n\nin 2000 and 52 percent in 1999.\n\n14\n\nGEOGRAPHICAL REVENUES\n\n2001 CHANGE 2000 CHANGE 1999\n\n------ ------ ------ ------ ------\n\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\n\nNorth America...................................... $537.5 (8)% $586.7 10% $531.5\n\nPercentage of total revenues..................... 58% 61% 61%\n\nInternational:\n\nEurope........................................... $251.6 2% $247.8 7% $231.9\n\nPercentage of total revenues.................. 27% 26% 27%\n\nIntercontinental................................... $137.0 9% $126.0 16% $108.2\n\nPercentage of total revenues.................. 15% 13% 12%\n\nTotal International................................ $388.6 4% $373.8 10% $340.1\n\nPercentage of total revenues..................... 42% 39% 39%\n\nTotal revenues..................................... $926.1 (4)% $960.5 10% $871.6\n\nNorth America revenues (United States, Canada and Mexico) decreased 8\n\npercent in 2001 from 2000 (which had increased 10 percent over 1999), primarily\n\ndue to a 26 percent decline in license fees revenues and a 13 percent decline in\n\nprofessional services revenue. The decrease was partially offset by a 21 percent\n\nincrease in technical support revenues. The decrease in North America revenues\n\nwas largely the result of the economic factors discussed under \"Revenues\" above.\n\nThe increase in North America revenues in 2000 was due primarily to an increase\n\nin license fees revenues from our enterprise database, enterprise application\n\nand mobile database products, and an overall increase in our professional\n\nservices revenues (see discussion above).\n\nTotal international revenues increased 4 percent in 2001 over 2000 (which\n\nhad increased 10 percent over 1999), primarily due to a 17 percent increase in\n\ntechnical support revenues which more than offset a 4 percent decrease in\n\nlicense fees revenues. European revenues increased 2 percent in 2001 (which had\n\nincreased 7 percent in 2000) primarily due to an 18 percent increase in\n\ntechnical services revenues which more than offset a 10 percent decrease in\n\nlicense fees revenues primarily attributable to decreased revenues from our\n\nenterprise database and mobile database products. The decrease in European\n\nlicense fees revenues was largely the result of the economic factors discussed\n\nunder \"Revenues,\" above.\n\nIntercontinental revenues (principally Asia Pacific and South America)\n\nincreased 9 percent in 2001 due to a 6 percent increase in license fees\n\nrevenues, primarily associated with our enterprise application and mobile\n\ndatabase products, and a combined increase of 13 percent in services revenues.\n\nIn 2000, Intercontinental revenues increased 16 percent due to an 18 percent\n\nincrease in license fees revenues primarily from enterprise database, enterprise\n\napplication and mobile database products. A 14 percent increase in\n\nIntercontinental services revenues was attributable to an increase in technical\n\nsupport revenues. In general, the economic conditions within the\n\nIntercontinental region have been significantly less robust than those in Europe\n\nand North America due to the severe recessionary conditions faced by many of the\n\ncountries in the region which began in 1999. Our business in the region has seen\n\nsteady growth since 1999 across virtually all product offerings and services.\n\nIn Europe and the Intercontinental region, most revenues and expenses are\n\ndenominated in local currencies. The effect of foreign currency exchange rate\n\nchanges on revenues was not material in 2001, 2000, or 1999.\n\nAlthough we take into account changes in exchange rates over time in our\n\npricing strategy, our business and results of operations could be materially and\n\nadversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes\n\nin foreign currency exchange rates, the strength of local economies, and the\n\ngeneral volatility of software markets may result in a higher or lower\n\nproportion of international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in the\n\nfuture.

The cost of license fees\n\nexpense increased 1 percent in 2001 over 2000. In 2000, these costs decreased 2\n\npercent from 1999. The 2001 increase was primarily due to the amortization of\n\npurchased technology acquired in the NEN transaction, partially offset by\n\ndecreases in amortization of capitalized software costs and third party\n\nroyalties. The 2000 decrease in cost of license fees was primarily due to\n\ndecreased third party royalties which were partially offset by increases in\n\namortization of capitalized software costs and the amortization of purchased\n\ntechnology acquired in the HFN transaction. Cost of license fees were 12 percent\n\nof license fees revenues in 2001, 10 percent in 2000, and 11 percent in 1999.\n\nAmortization of capitalized software costs was $17.8 million in 2001, $22.4\n\nmillion in 2000, and $20.0 million in 1999. In 2001, the decrease in\n\namortization of capitalized software costs was primarily due to certain eBD and\n\nESD products that became fully amortized at the end of 2000. In 2000, the\n\nincrease in amortization of capitalized software costs was primarily related to\n\nAdaptive Server Enterprise 12.0, PowerBuilder 7.0, Jaguar CTS(R) 3.0 and 3.5,\n\nand Sybase Enterprise Portal 1.0. Amortization of purchased technology acquired\n\nwas $12.1 million in 2001, $4.4 million in 2000 and $1.6 million in 1999.\n\nCost of Services\n\nCost of services consists primarily of the cost to provide technical\n\nsupport, consulting and education services and, to a lesser degree,\n\nservices-related product costs (media and documentation). These costs decreased\n\n3 percent in 2001 compared to 2000, and increased 13 percent in 2000 compared to\n\n1999. These costs decreased as a percentage of services revenues to 44 percent\n\nin 2001, compared to 50 percent in 2000, and were 48 percent of services\n\nrevenues in 1999. The decrease, in absolute dollars and as a percentage of\n\nservices revenues in 2001 over 2000, was primarily due to a reduction in\n\nconsulting personnel in the 2001 Plan. This decrease was partially offset by an\n\nincrease in the costs associated with third party consultants, and\n\n16\n\nconsultants acquired in the NEN transaction. The increase in cost of services in\n\nabsolute dollars and as a percentage of services revenues in 2000 over 1999 was\n\nprimarily due to an increase in the number of consulting personnel located in\n\nNorth America (partially attributable to the acquisition of HFN), and market\n\ndriven increases in the labor costs associated with consulting personnel.\n\nSales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing expense decreased 4 percent during 2001 compared to\n\n2000 (which had increased 11 percent over 1999). Sales and marketing expenses\n\nremained consistent at 36 percent of total revenues in 2001, 2000, and 1999.\n\nHowever, the decrease in absolute dollars from 2000 to 2001 was primarily due to\n\na decrease in sales commissions (due to lower license fees revenues and\n\nreductions in sales and marketing personnel in the 2001 Plan), and a decrease in\n\ncertain allocated common costs. Partially offsetting these decreases were sales\n\nand marketing expenses associated with NEN. The increase in sales and marketing\n\nexpenses in absolute dollars in 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily due to sales\n\nexpenses associated with increased revenues including the addition of HFN, and\n\ncertain marketing programs undertaken during the year. The increase in sales and\n\nmarketing expense was partially offset by a decrease in allocated common costs.\n\nWe allocate various common costs including certain legal expenses, accounting,\n\nhuman resources, external consulting, employee benefits, and facilities costs to\n\nsales and marketing, product development and engineering, and general and\n\nadministrative expenses. The common costs in 2001 were lower than those in 2000\n\nprimarily due to a cut back in discretionary spending in response to weaker\n\neconomic conditions, and the 2001 Plan. The common costs in 1999 were higher\n\nthan those in 2000 due to certain litigation costs during 1999, the costs\n\nassociated with internal Y2K compliance, and the streamlining of certain\n\nback-office functions during 2000.\n\nProduct Development and Engineering\n\nProduct development and engineering expenses (net of capitalized software\n\ndevelopment costs) decreased 1 percent in 2001 from 2000 (which had decreased 7\n\npercent from 1999). These expenses increased as a percentage of total revenues\n\nto 14 percent in 2001 compared to 13 percent in 2000, and were 16 percent of\n\ntotal revenues in 1999. The decrease in absolute dollars in 2001 as compared to\n\n2000 was primarily due to an increase in capitalized software development costs,\n\na decrease in certain research and development expenses due to a greater\n\npercentage of R&D personnel employed in lower cost facilities, and a decrease in\n\nallocated common costs, partially offset by costs attributable to NEN's product\n\ndevelopment and engineering efforts. The decrease in absolute dollars in 2000 as\n\ncompared to 1999 was primarily due to a decrease in personnel expenses and\n\nallocated common costs.\n\nWe capitalize product development and engineering costs during the period\n\nbetween achievement of technological feasibility and general availability of the\n\nproduct. Capitalized amounts totaled approximately $35.8 million in 2001, $20.2\n\nmillion in 2000, and $18.7 million in 1999. The significant increase in amounts\n\ncapitalized in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily attributable to capitalized\n\ncosts associated with the development of products acquired in the NEN\n\ntransaction, and other products captured within eBD.\n\nIn 2001, capitalized software costs included costs incurred for the\n\ndevelopment of the Enterprise Portal 3.0, Adaptive Server Enterprise 12.5 and\n\n14.0, Adaptive Server IQ 12.4.3, PowerBuilder 8.0, DirectConnect 12.5 and 14.0,\n\nMainframeConnect(TM) 12.5 and 14.0, Replication Server 12.5, certain NEN\n\nadapters, and SQL Anywhere 8.0. In 2000, capitalized software costs included\n\ncosts incurred for the development of the Sybase Enterprise Portal 1.0, Sybase\n\nEnterprise Portal 2.0, Adaptive Server Enterprise 12.5, Adaptive Server IQ\n\n12.4.2 and 12.5, DirectConnect 12.0 and 12.5, Enterprise Application Server, and\n\nMainframeConnect 12.0 and 12.5. In 1999, capitalized software costs included\n\ncosts incurred for the development of Adaptive Server Enterprise 12.0,\n\nEnterprise Event Broker, Sybase Financial Server 1.0, Enterprise Application\n\nStudio(TM) 3.5, PowerJ(R) 3.0, Replication Server 12.0, and PowerDesigner 7.0.\n\n17\n\nWe believe that product development and engineering expenditures are\n\nessential to technology and product leadership and expect product development\n\nand engineering expenditures to continue to be significant, both in absolute\n\ndollars and as a percentage of total revenues.\n\nGeneral and Administrative\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased 14 percent in 2001 compared\n\nto 2000 (which decreased 2 percent from 1999). General and administrative\n\nexpenses represented 8 percent of total revenues in 2001 compared to 7 percent\n\n2000, and 8 percent in 1999. The increase in absolute dollars and as a\n\npercentage of total revenues in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to the\n\nadded costs associated with the acquisition of NEN. The decrease in absolute\n\ndollars and as a percentage of total revenues in 2000 compared to 1999 was\n\nprimarily due to a decrease in allocated common costs which were partially\n\noffset by the added costs associated with the acquisition of HFN.\n\nAmortization of Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangibles\n\nAmortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles increased 71\n\npercent during 2001 compared to 2000 (which increased 135 percent over 1999).\n\nThese costs were 6 percent of total revenues in 2001 compared to 3 percent in\n\n2000, and 2 percent in 1999. The increase in absolute dollars and as a\n\npercentage of total revenues in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to the\n\namortization of goodwill and other acquired intangibles arising from the NEN\n\nacquisition. The increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total\n\nrevenues in 2000 compared to 1999 was attributable to amortization of goodwill\n\nand the established customer list associated with the HFN acquisition.\n\nWe will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible\n\nassets beginning in the first quarter of 2002. Application of the\n\nnon-amortization provisions of SFAS 142 is expected to result in an increase in\n\npre-tax net income of approximately $61 million in 2002, $59 million in 2003,\n\nand $59 million in 2004.\n\nIn-process research and development\n\nNEN\n\nIn connection with our acquisition of NEN, we allocated $18.5 million of\n\nthe $339.3 million purchase price to in-process research and development. These\n\namounts were written off during the quarter ended June 30, 2001. In analyzing\n\nthis acquisition, the decision was made to acquire technology, including\n\nin-process technology, rather than to develop it internally. This decision was\n\nbased on factors such as the amount of internal expertise, time and cost it\n\nwould take to bring the technology to market.\n\nNEN technologies enable e-Business and operational applications to share\n\ncritical information. NEN's software solutions support integration of Internet\n\nand core business packaged applications, application server platforms, industry\n\nstandard protocols, and proprietary systems. As of February 20, 2001 (the\n\nacquisition date) NEN was undergoing development efforts to release the next\n\nversion of e-Biz Integrator, Process Server(TM), adapters, and emerging products\n\n(such as Open Business Interchange(SM)). These development efforts were all\n\nproprietary, internal projects. At the acquisition date, the in-process research\n\nand development projects had not yet reached technological feasibility, and had\n\nno alternative future uses.\n\nIn assessing the qualification of NEN's various ongoing research and\n\ndevelopment projects, each project was examined to determine whether\n\ntechnological feasibility had been established as of the acquisition date. Our\n\nassessment was based on extensive interviews and a detailed analysis of research\n\nand development plans. If the project required additional planning, designing,\n\ncoding or testing activities to determine whether the associated product could\n\nbe produced to meet its design specifications, we determined that technological\n\nfeasibility had not been reached with respect to this project.\n\nDue to the complexity and specialized features of the acquired research and\n\ndevelopment, the technologies under development could only be economically used\n\nfor their specific and intended purposes in the e-Business integration industry.\n\nThe features and functions of the products were being developed for\n\n18\n\nspecific purposes, and if NEN failed in its efforts, no alternative economic\n\nvalue would result from these efforts. Accordingly, the value allocated to\n\nprojects that had not reached technology feasibility was immediately expensed at\n\nthe acquisition date.\n\nWe estimated the fair value of in-process research and development using an\n\nincome approach. This involved estimating the fair value of the in-process\n\nresearch and development using risk-adjusted discount rates. The selection of\n\nthe discount rate was based on a weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to\n\nreflect risks associated with the useful life of each technology, profitability\n\nlevels of each technology, the uncertainty of technology advances known at the\n\ntime, and each technologies' degree of completion. Projected future net cash\n\nflow attributable to NEN's in-process research and development, assuming\n\nsuccessful development, were discounted to net present value using a discount\n\nrate of 25 percent. We believe that the estimated in-process research and\n\ndevelopment amount so determined represents fair value and does not exceed the\n\namount another third party would pay for the projects.\n\nRevenue estimates in this context were based on relevant market size and\n\ngrowth factors, expected industry trends, individual product sales cycles and\n\nthe estimated life of each product's underlying technology. This analysis\n\nincluded the revenues projected to result from the expected evolution of the\n\ntechnology over time.\n\nOperating expenses used in our analysis included selling, general and\n\nadministrative and research and development. These expenses were based on an\n\noverall analysis of the business enterprise. Total research and development was\n\ndivided into the costs to complete the in-process research and development\n\nprojects and costs for developed products that had already been introduced to\n\nthe market. The allocation was based on an analysis of resources relating to the\n\ndevelopment of research and development.\n\nCosts to complete in-process projects were estimated by management. These\n\ncosts were allocated based on an analysis of completion efforts and expected\n\ncompletion dates. Costs to complete were further allocated between in-process\n\nand future revenues based on an analysis of the evolution of the respective\n\ntechnologies.\n\nNEN expected to achieve a target margin of approximately 37 percent from\n\nits in-process products. Profitability was expected to be significantly lower in\n\nthe first years of the products' lifecycle compared to the later years due to\n\nhigher level of sales and marketing expense in the earlier years as a percentage\n\nof revenue. The financial forecasts included only results that were expected to\n\nbe generated by NEN on a standalone basis, and did not take into consideration\n\nsynergies resulting from our acquisition.\n\nTo properly analyze the research and development efforts that had been\n\naccomplished as of the acquisition date, and to exclude the completion of\n\ndevelopment efforts underway, it was necessary to adjust the overall forecasts\n\nassociated with the research and development projects to reflect only those\n\naccomplishments completed as of the acquisition date. The relative contribution\n\nmade by the completed research and development efforts was assessed based on a\n\nvariety of factors including absolute development time, costs incurred to date,\n\nmanagement estimates, a detailed analysis of each of the primary tasks completed\n\ncompared to the tasks required to complete the efforts, and the associated\n\nrisks. NEN's in-process research and development projects were estimated to be\n\nbetween 30 percent and 55 percent complete as of the acquisition date.\n\nDevelopment of the majority of the in-process technologies began in early\n\n2000 and was substantially completed in the fall of 2001. At the acquisition\n\ndate, approximately 278 engineers were engaged in the development of NEN's\n\nin-process technologies. Completion of these projects is expected to require\n\nsignificant efforts involving continued software development as well as the\n\ntesting and re-qualification efforts required to turn the technologies into a\n\nset of bug-free, commercial-ready products. These remaining tasks involved\n\nsubstantial risk due to the complex nature of the activities involved. Actual\n\nresults of our research and development efforts to date have been consistent in\n\nall material respects with our assumptions at the time of the acquisition.\n\n19\n\nHFN\n\nIn connection with the acquisition of HFN in the quarter ended March 31,\n\n2000, we allocated $8.0 million of the $167.6 million purchase price to\n\nin-process research and development. As part of the process of analyzing this\n\nacquisition, the decision was made to buy technology that had not yet been\n\ncommercialized rather than to develop the technology internally. This decision\n\nwas based on factors such as the amount of time and costs it would take to bring\n\nthe technology to market.\n\nHFN had been involved in the development of technologies that enable\n\nfinancial institutions to deliver their services to customers via the Internet.\n\nOn the date we acquired HFN (January 20, 2000), HFN was conducting development\n\nand qualification activities related to a suite of products encompassing bill\n\npresentment, small business functions, alternate service delivery methods and\n\nrelated underlying software technology. At that time, the in-process research\n\nand development projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had\n\nno alternative future uses. Accordingly, the value allocated to these projects\n\nwas immediately expensed at the date of acquisition.\n\nWe estimated the fair value of in-process research and development using an\n\nincome approach. This involved estimating the fair value of the in-process\n\nresearch and development by determining the present value of the estimated\n\nafter-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased in-process\n\nresearch and development, using risk adjusted discount rates. The selection of\n\nthe discount rate was based on a weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to\n\nreflect risks associated with the useful life of each technology, profitability\n\nlevels of each technology, the uncertainty of technology advances known at the\n\ntime, and each technologies' degree of completion. Projected future net cash\n\nflows attributable to HFN's in-process research and development, assuming\n\nsuccessful development, were discounted to net present value using a discount\n\nrate of 20 percent. We believe that the estimated in-process research and\n\ndevelopment amount so determined represents fair value and does not exceed the\n\namount another third party would pay for the projects.\n\nRevenue estimates were based on relevant market size and growth factors,\n\nexpected industry trends, individual product sales cycles and the estimated life\n\nof each product's underlying technology. The analysis of the in-process\n\ntechnology was determined by incorporating the revenue related to the expected\n\nevolution of the technology over time. Once developed, the estimated lifecycle\n\nof the product suite was estimated to be approximately 5 to 7 years. As a whole,\n\nHFN was expected to exhibit compound annual growth of approximately 38 percent\n\nin the period from 2000 through 2007.\n\nIt was projected that the suite of products resulting from the in-process\n\nresearch and development efforts would begin generating revenue in 2000 and\n\npositive cash flow in 2001. Operating expenses included selling, general and\n\nadministrative expenses, and research and development expenses. Total research\n\nand development was divided into: (i) the costs to complete the in-process\n\nresearch and development projects and (ii) costs for developed products that had\n\nalready been introduced to the market, including product maintenance. Costs to\n\ncomplete in-process projects were estimated by management. These costs were\n\nallocated based on an analysis of expected project completion dates.\n\nThe resultant target margin that HFN expected to achieve from the\n\nin-process products was approximately 37 percent. Profitability was expected to\n\nbe significantly lower in the first several years of the product suite's\n\nlifecycle compared to the latter years due to a higher level of sales and\n\nmarketing expenses as a percentage of revenue in the earlier years. The\n\nfinancial forecasts only included results we expected HFN to generate on a\n\nstandalone basis, and did not take into consideration synergies resulting from\n\nour acquisition.\n\nTo properly analyze the research and development efforts that had been\n\naccomplished to date and exclude the effort to be completed on the development\n\nefforts underway, it was necessary to adjust the overall forecasts associated\n\nwith the research and development projects to reflect only the accomplishments\n\nmade as of the date of the acquisition towards the ultimate completion of the\n\nin-process R&D projects. The relative contribution made on the research and\n\ndevelopment efforts was assessed based on a variety of factors including\n\nabsolute development time (costs) incurred to date, management estimates, and a\n\ndetailed analysis of each of the primary tasks completed compared to the tasks\n\nrequired to complete the efforts and the associated risks. Overall, HFN's\n\nin-process research and development projects were estimated to be approximately\n\n75 percent\n\n20\n\ncomplete. HFN estimated that the projects would be completed in March 2000,\n\nafter which time it expected to begin generating economic benefits from the\n\ncompleted projects. As of the valuation date, approximately 86 man months\n\ntotaling $650,000 had been expended on the in-process research and development\n\nprojects. In total, costs to complete HFN's in-process research and development\n\nwere expected to be approximately $150,000 and require 23 man months of work.\n\nCompletion of these projects was expected to require significant efforts\n\ninvolving continued software development as well as the testing and\n\nre-qualification efforts required to turn a \"new-to-the-world\" software suite\n\ninto a set of bug-free, commercial-ready products. These remaining tasks\n\ninvolved substantial risk due to the complex nature of the activities involved.\n\nHistorically, many of HFN's in-process research and development projects have\n\nrequired rework and additional expenditures in comparable stages of development.\n\nThe research and development efforts described above are substantially\n\ncomplete and actual results of our research and development efforts to date have\n\nbeen consistent, in all material respects, with our assumptions at the time of\n\nthe HFN acquisition.\n\nStock Compensation Expense\n\nStock compensation expense reflects non-cash compensation expense\n\nassociated with restricted stock granted to certain individuals in the three\n\nmonths ended June 30, 2001, and the amortization of the value assigned to\n\ncertain unvested stock options assumed in the acquisition of NEN.\n\nCost (Reversal) of Restructuring\n\nThe Company's 2001 Plan included restructuring charges of $25.2 million\n\nduring the quarter ended June 30, 2001, restructuring charges of $10.3 million\n\nduring the quarter ended September 30, 2001, and restructuring charges of $13.3\n\nmillion during the quarter ended December 31, 2001. The goal of the 2001 Plan\n\nwas to align our cost structure with anticipated revenues. We terminated a total\n\nof 880 employees, closed or consolidated more than 30 facilities worldwide,\n\nwrote down certain assets no longer needed for future business operations, and\n\nincurred various other exit activity expenses directly related to the 2001 Plan.\n\nThe amounts included in the 2001 Plan were as follows:\n\nCASH/ Q2 Q3 Q4\n\nNON CASH 2001 2001 2001 TOTAL\n\n-------- ----- ----- ----- -----\n\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\n\nTermination payments to employees and other related\n\ncosts.............................................

During the third quarter of 2001, the\n\nCompany incurred a restructuring charge of approximately $5.1 million for\n\nseverance payments and other termination benefits provided to approximately 280\n\nemployees. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company incurred a\n\nrestructuring charge of approximately $5.7 million for severance payments and\n\nother termination benefits provided to approximately 200 employees. Severance\n\npayments and termination benefits were accrued and charged to restructuring\n\ncosts in the period that amounts were determined and communicated to the\n\naffected employees.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company evaluated the costs associated with\n\nproviding medical coverage and other benefits to certain employees terminated in\n\nthe second and third quarters. As a result of the\n\n21\n\nCompany's experience through the end of the fourth quarter, the amount of the\n\nseverance accrual relating to medical coverage and other benefits was reduced by\n\napproximately $1.0 million. In addition, there was a reversal in the fourth\n\nquarter to the severance accrual for approximately $0.7 million associated with\n\na number of individuals who were either not terminated after they were asked to\n\nstay to fill positions voluntarily vacated by employees not included in the\n\nrestructuring plan, or were foreign employees paid less then the amount\n\noriginally provided after a legal proceeding to determine the severance amount\n\nas required under local law. The above reversal was recorded by a corresponding\n\ncredit to restructuring expense.\n\nLEASE CANCELLATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2001, Sybase incurred restructuring charges of\n\n$13.5 million for facilities consolidated or closed in Boulder, Colorado;\n\nEmeryville, California; Hartford, Connecticut; Englewood, Colorado; Milpitas,\n\nCalifornia; New York, New York; Southfield, Michigan; Watertown, Massachusetts;\n\nWestport, Connecticut; and Orem, Utah. The Company also incurred restructuring\n\ncharges of $0.7 million for facilities consolidated or closed in Canada, the\n\nUnited Kingdom, Belgium, Spain and Sweden. During the third quarter of 2001,\n\nSybase incurred restructuring charges of $4.1 million for facilities\n\nconsolidated or closed in Boston, Massachusetts, and in the United Kingdom.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company incurred restructuring charges of\n\n$4.4 million for facilities consolidated or closed in California, Colorado,\n\nFlorida, Virginia, Mexico, Argentina, Puerto Rico, Japan, France and\n\nSwitzerland. In addition, based on the analysis of independent real estate\n\nconsultants, and reflecting changes in the economic conditions since the\n\noriginal accruals were established, the Company recorded additional\n\nrestructuring charges of $4.0 million during the fourth quarter to provide for\n\nthe current estimated cost to consolidate or close facilities in California,\n\nColorado, Georgia, Michigan, Utah, Massachusetts, New York and the UK.\n\nThe offices included above were primarily used for the sale of Sybase\n\nsoftware products, professional services and customer support, and in certain\n\ninstances research and development. These restructuring charges reflect the\n\nremaining contractual obligations under the facility leases and certain costs\n\nassociated with the expected sublease of the facilities, net of anticipated\n\nsublease income from the date of abandonment to the end of the lease term.\n\nCertain facilities described above continued in use during the completion of the\n\nrestructuring. The Company continued to record monthly rent expense on these\n\nfacilities as an operating expense until the facilities were abandoned.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2001, approximately $0.6 million was reversed\n\nby a corresponding credit to restructuring expense, a second quarter accrual\n\nestablished to terminate a lease on a building which was later destroyed during\n\nthe terrorist attacks of September 11th. During the fourth quarter the Company\n\nwas notified that no additional payments would be required under the lease on\n\nthe facility, and as a result the associated restructuring accrual was reversed.\n\nWRITE-DOWNS OF PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND FURNITURE\n\nIn the second and third quarters of 2001, Sybase incurred restructuring\n\ncharges of $0.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, which were primarily\n\nrelated to the impairment of the carrying values of leaseholds and certain\n\nfurniture attributable to facilities closed in connection with the\n\nrestructuring. The assets were all taken out of service and held for disposal at\n\nthe date the associated facility was closed. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the\n\nCompany incurred a restructuring charge of $1.4 million, which was related to\n\nthe impairment of the carrying value of certain computer equipment and software\n\nassociated with individuals terminated during the year for which there was no\n\nintended alternative use, and leaseholds and certain furniture attributable to\n\nfacilities closed in connection with the restructuring.\n\nOTHER\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2001, the Company incurred a restructuring\n\ncharge of $0.4 million associated with certain other restructuring related exit\n\nexpenses, including legal costs associated with the severance of employees,\n\ntravel and security costs associated with the termination of employees, and fees\n\nassociated with the cancellation of certain obligations, and relocation expenses\n\nfor certain terminated\n\n22\n\nexpatriates. During the third and fourth quarters of 2001, the Company incurred\n\nrestructuring charges of $0.1 million for professional fees associated with the\n\nrestructuring.\n\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to the restructuring:\n\nACCRUED\n\nLIABILITIES\n\nTOTAL AMOUNTS AMOUNTS AMOUNTS AT\n\nCHARGES PAID WRITTEN-OFF REVERSED 12/31/01\n\n------- ------- ----------- -------- -----------\n\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\n\nTermination payments to employees and other\n\nrelated costs.............................. $20.9 $13.5 -- $1.7 $ 5.7\n\nLease cancellations and commitments.......... 26.7 3.1 -- 0.9 22.7\n\nCosts related to the write-down of assets.... 3.2 -- $3.2 -- --\n\nOther........................................ 0.6 0.4 -- -- 0.2\n\n----- ----- ---- ---- -----\n\n$51.4 $17.0 $3.2 $2.6 $28.6\n\n===== ===== ==== ==== =====\n\nIt is estimated that the remaining accruals relating to termination\n\nbenefits and other restructuring relating activities will be paid by the second\n\nquarter of 2002. The payments of accruals related to lease cancellations and\n\ncommitments which are dependent upon market conditions and our ability to\n\nnegotiate acceptable lease buy-out outs or locate suitable subleases, will be\n\npaid over a period not to exceed nine years.\n\nAs of December 31, 2001, we had completed substantially all of the employee\n\nterminations identified during the second and third quarters. Approximately 100\n\nof the 200 employees identified in the fourth quarter were notified of their\n\ntermination benefits, but had not received their severance payments at December\n\n31, 2001.\n\nOPERATING INCOME/LOSS\n\n2001 CHANGE 2000 CHANGE 1999\n\n------ ------ ----- ------ -----\n\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\n\nOperating income/(loss)...................... $(16.5) (118)% $90.5 4% $87.0\n\nPercentage of total revenues............... (2)% 9% 10%\n\nOperating income in 2001 decreased 118 percent over 2000 (which had\n\nincreased 4 percent over 1999). The 2001 operating loss includes $48.8 million\n\nin 2001 Plan restructuring charges. In 2000 and 1999, operating income included\n\na reversal to restructuring charges of $0.8 million and $8.5 million,\n\nrespectively.\n\nIn 2001, the decrease in operating income was primarily due to the decrease\n\nin license fees revenues and the increase in operating expenses including\n\nexpenses associated with the amortization of goodwill and other purchased\n\nintangibles, the $18.5 million write-off of in-process research and development\n\nrelating to the acquisition of NEN and 2001 Plan restructuring charges. These\n\ndecreases were partially offset by the increase in services revenues. The\n\nincrease in operating income in 2000, compared to 1999, is primarily due to an\n\nincrease in total revenues and the continued benefit from the restructure\n\nactions taken in 1998 that kept 2000 sales and marketing, product development\n\nand engineering, and general and administrative expenses equal to or lower than\n\nthe levels obtained 1999, as a percentage of revenue. The increase was partially\n\noffset by an increase in cost of services and expenses associated with the\n\namortization of goodwill and established customer lists, the write-off of\n\nin-process research and development and the amortization of purchased technology\n\nrelating to the acquisition of HFN.\n\n23\n\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET\n\n2001 CHANGE 2000 CHANGE 1999\n\n----- ------ ----- ------ -----\n\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\n\nInterest income............................... $16.9 (6)% $17.9 32% $13.6\n\nPercentage of total revenues................ 2% 2% 2%\n\nInterest expense and other, net............... $ 0.6 * $(0.8) * $ 0.2\n\nPercentage of total revenues................ * * *\n\nMinority interest............................. * * $ 0.1 * --\n\nPercentage of total revenues................ * ** --\n\n- ---------------\n\n* Not meaningful\n\nIn 2001, interest income decreased 6 percent from 2000 (which had increased\n\n32 percent over 1999). Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on\n\ninvestments. The decrease in interest income in 2001 as compared to 2000 was\n\nprimarily due to the decrease in the interest rate yields of the cash balances\n\ninvested. The increase between 2000 and 1999 was attributable to larger\n\naverage-invested cash balances, and an increase in the interest rate yields of\n\nthe cash balances invested.\n\nInterest expense and other, net was $0.6 million in 2001, $(0.8) million in\n\n2000, and $0.2 million in 1999. Interest expense and other, net includes\n\ninterest expense from capital lease obligations incurred in prior years; gains\n\nfrom the disposition of certain real estate and investments; bank fees;\n\nexpenses, net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions and\n\nthe related hedging activities; and the cost of hedging foreign currency\n\nexposures. In 2001, the increase in interest expense and other, net as compared\n\nto 2000 was primarily due to the hedging activities that mitigated the losses\n\nresulting from foreign currency transactions. The decrease in interest expense\n\nand other, net during 2000 compared to 1999, was due to the 1999 sale of certain\n\nEuropean real estate.\n\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\n\n2001 CHANGE 2000 CHANGE 1999\n\n----- ------ ----- ------ -----\n\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\n\nProvision for income taxes.................... $26.5 (25)% $35.5 (7)% $38.3\n\nIn 2001 income taxes of $26.5 million were recorded on pre-tax book income\n\nof $1.0 million. The income tax expense primarily results for taxes on earnings\n\ngenerated in certain international jurisdictions. Overall, we had significant\n\npre-tax earnings in foreign jurisdictions and a significant pre-tax loss in the\n\nU.S. The U.S. loss primarily resulted from the amortization or write-off of\n\nintangibles acquired in various acquisitions accounted for as purchases, and the\n\n2001 Plan.\n\nA significant increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes,\n\nprimarily the amortization or write-off of intangibles acquired in the NEN\n\nacquisition, made the tax rate as a percentage of 2001's pre-tax income of $1.0\n\nmillion, meaningless when compared to 2000 and 1999. In 2000, taxes were\n\nrecorded at a rate of 33 percent on pre-tax income, while taxes in 1999 were\n\nrecorded at a 38 percent rate.\n\nThe 2000 and 1999 tax provisions were the result of taxable earnings\n\ngenerated from operations in both the US and certain international\n\njurisdictions. The 2000 provision benefited from a $9.7 million reversal of a\n\npreviously recorded valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset. The valuation\n\nallowance reversed related to certain research and development tax credits that\n\nwe believe will generate a tax benefit in future periods given their\n\ncarryforward periods. The reversal of the valuation allowance is a non-recurring\n\nbenefit, and will not impact our provision for income taxes in future years. The\n\nbenefit of the valuation allowance reversal was offset somewhat in 2000 by an\n\nincrease in expenses that were not deductible for tax purposes. These expenses\n\nwere primarily the amortization of goodwill and established customer lists, the\n\nwrite-off of in-process research and development and the amortization of\n\npurchased technology relating to the acquisition of HFN.\n\n24\n\nWe had a net deferred tax asset of $42.0 million at December 31, 2001. This\n\ndeferred tax asset included a valuation allowance of $54.4 million. As of\n\nDecember 31, 2001, the gross deferred tax asset included research and\n\ndevelopment tax credits of $19.6 million, foreign tax credits of $9.7 million\n\nand an asset for certain net operating losses of $45.9 million. The research and\n\ndevelopment tax credits expire in years from 2005 through 2021, the foreign tax\n\ncredits expire in years from 2002 through 2005 and the net operating losses\n\nexpire in years from 2006 and 2021. In order to realize the net deferred tax\n\nassets we must generate sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate\n\ntax jurisdictions so that we can obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary\n\ndifferences and from tax credit carryforwards. The amount of the deferred tax\n\nassets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if\n\nestimates of future taxable income are reduced. Any such adjustments to the\n\ndeferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such adjustment was\n\nmade. See Note Eight to Consolidated Financial Statements, Part II, Item 8,\n\nincorporated here by reference.\n\nThe valuation allowance increased by $38.9 million in 2001. This movement\n\nwas primarily the valuation allowance attached to deferred tax assets acquired\n\nduring the year which are associated with the net operating losses of NEN.\n\nNET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE\n\n2001 CHANGE 2000 CHANGE 1999\n\n------ ------ ----- ------ -----\n\n(DOLLARS AND SHARES IN MILLIONS)\n\nNet income (loss)............................ $(25.5) (135)% $72.1 15% $62.5\n\nPercentage of total revenues...............

The reasons for\n\nthis decrease have been discussed in the preceding paragraphs. The basic and\n\ndiluted net loss per share was $0.27 in 2001. The basic and diluted net income\n\nper share in 2000 was $0.82 and $0.78 per share, respectively. The basic and\n\ndiluted net income per share in 1999 was $0.76 and $0.74 per share,\n\nrespectively. Shares used in computing basic net income (loss) per share\n\nincreased 8 percent in 2001 primarily due to the shares issued in 2001 in\n\nconnection with the acquisition of NEN, partially offset by shares repurchased\n\nunder our share repurchase plan. Shares used in computing basic net income\n\n(loss) per share increased 7 percent in 2000 primarily due to the shares issued\n\nin 2000 in connection with the acquisition of HFN. Shares used in computing\n\ndiluted net income (loss) per share increased 3 percent in 2001 primarily due to\n\nthe shares issued in connection with the acquisition of NEN. Shares used in\n\ncomputing diluted net income (loss) per share increased 10 percent in 2000\n\nprimarily due to the shares issued in connection with the acquisition of HFN.\n\nSee Note One to Consolidated Financial Statements, Part II, Item 8, incorporated\n\nhere by reference.\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n2001 CHANGE 2000 CHANGE 1999\n\n------ ------ ------ ------ ------\n\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\n\nWorking capital............................ $108.6 (31)% $157.5 24% $127.2\n\nCash, cash equivalents and cash\n\nInvestments.............................. $343.2 (3)% $354.6 0% $352.9\n\nNet cash provided by operating\n\nactivities............................... $ 93.1 (46)% $171.1 (4)% $178.7\n\nNet cash used for investing activities..... $ 22.9 (81)% $123.0 4% $118.0\n\nNet cash used for financing activities..... $ 75.4 32% $ 57.1 90% $ 30.1\n\n25\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased 46 percent between 2000\n\nand 2001 and 4 percent between 1999 and 2000. Net cash provided by operating\n\nactivities during 2001 reflects net loss of $25.5 million compared to net income\n\nof $72.1 million in 2000 and $62.5 million in 1999. The decrease in net cash\n\nprovided by operating activities between 2001 and 2000 is primarily due to a\n\ndecrease in net income, deferred revenue and accrued liabilities partially\n\noffset a reduction in accounts receivable and an increase in non-cash expenses\n\nrelating to amortization, depreciation and the write-off of in-process research\n\nand development.
