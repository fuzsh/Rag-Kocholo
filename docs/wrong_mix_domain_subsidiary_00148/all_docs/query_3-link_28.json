        "text": "Many organizations draw attention to their library of connectors. After all, data connectivity is a core capability needed for applications to maximize their business value. However, it is essential to understand exactly what you are getting when evaluating connectivity. Some vendors are happy to offer connectors that implement basic proof-of-concept level connectivity. These connectors may highlight the possibilities of working with Sybase IQ, but often only provide a fraction of capability. Finding real value from these connectors usually requires additional IT or development resources.\n\nUnlike these POC-quality connectors, every CData Sybase IQ driver offers full-featured Sybase IQ data connectivity. The CData Sybase IQ drivers support extensive Sybase IQ integration, providing access to all of the Sybase IQ data and meta-data needed by enterprise integration or analytics projects. Each driver contains a powerful embedded SQL engine that offers applications easy and high-performance access to all Sybase IQ data. In addition, our drivers offer robust authentication and security capabilities, allowing users to connect securely across a wide range of enterprise configurations. Compare drivers and connectors to read more about some of the benefits of CData's driver connectivity.\n\nUsing the CData Sybase IQ drivers and connectors, Sybase IQ can be easily integrated with almost any application. Any software or technology that can integrate with a database or connect with standards-based drivers like ODBC, JDBC, ADO.NET, etc., can use our drivers for live Sybase IQ data connectivity. Explore some of the more popular Sybase IQ data integrations online.\n\nSybase IQ data integration is typically enabled with CData Sync, a robust any-to-any data pipeline solution that is easy to set up, runs everywhere, and offers comprehensive enterprise-class features for data engineering. CData Sync makes it easy to replicate Sybase IQ data any database or data warehouse, and maintain parity between systems with automated incremental Sybase IQ replication. In addition, our Sybase IQ drivers and connectors can be easily embedded into a wide range of data integration tools to augment existing solutions."
