        "text": "Solix Technologies’ comprehensive Data Management Platform used in conjunction with Sybase IQ will help customers enforce data governance across active and legacy applications in a consistent fashion to drive application portfolio management with reduced costs, data security, and compliance.\n\nSep 13, 2011 | Santa Clara, CA: Solix Technologies, the market leader in Information Lifecycle, test data management and data security solutions, has begun to use Sybase IQ, to offer an integrated and unified solution to manage and secure data that is coming from applications that are being retired or de-commissioned.\n\nAccording to a recent Gartner report “The decommissioning of existing systems-of-record applications will be very significant — we believe that between 2010 and 2020 more than half of all data center applications in use in 2010 will be retired. This mass retirement will bring the problem of orphaned data to the front and center of issues the IT organization will be expected to mediate and resolve”. (Managing orphaned data will require a multidisciplinary approach, March 2011)\n\nSolix EDMS Application Retirement is now integrated and certified with Sybase IQ. This integration allows customers use the industry’s leading application retirement software – Solix EDMS along with Sybase IQ as a long term archive so that customers can get an end-2-end application retirement solution which would provide data classification, migration, validation, preservation of application context, along with deep compression to reduce storage requirements and role-based data access to the data stored in Sybase IQ.\n\nSolix also announced a newer configuration of the industry’s first application retirement appliance – Solix ExAPPS which embeds Sybase IQ delivering a pre-configured, pre-tested, and certified appliance for application retirement so that customers can get a jump start with application portfolio management projects.\n\n“With large number of enterprises looking to cut down IT maintenance costs by embarking on application retirement projects, enterprises are looking for end-2-end solutions that are simple to use and get started, which show quick ROI, and have a lowest TCO for managing the data from legacy applications with seamless access along with data retention.” says Raghu Kodali, Vice President of Product Management & Strategy at Solix Technologies. “The combination of Solix EDMS, Sybase IQ products that are pre-integrated and optimized along with a purpose-built appliance Solix ExAPPS will provide the application retirement that enterprises are looking to deploy immediately”.\n\nTogether, Solix ExAPPS and Sybase IQ will provide a comprehensive solution for application portfolio management and managing the data retention based on corporate policies with lowest TCO.\n\n“By leveraging patented compression technology in Sybase IQ, the most widely deployed columnar database in the market today, Solix ExAPPS is able to drive down overall TCO of application retirement projects”, noted David Jonker, Director, Analytics Product Marketing at Sybase, an SAP Company. “As data volumes from diverse sources continue to grow reduction in storage foot print and sound Information Lifecycle Management plans become essential.”\n\nAbout Solix Technologies\n\nSolix Technologies, Inc., a leader in empowering data-driven enterprises, helps businesses organize their Enterprise Information with optimized infrastructure, data security and advanced analytics by achieving Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) goals.
