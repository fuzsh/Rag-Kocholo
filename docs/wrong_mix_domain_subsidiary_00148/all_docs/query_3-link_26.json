        "text": "DUBLIN, Calif., April 27, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Sybase, Inc., an SAP company (NYSE: SAP) and industry leader in enterprise and mobile software, today announced that Sybase, based on evaluation of SybaseÂ® Afaria, has been positioned by Gartner, Inc. in the Leaders quadrant in its Magic Quadrant for Mobile Device Management (MDM) Software report, authored by Phillip Redman, John Girard and Leif-Olof Wallin (April 2011).(1)\n\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20101203/MM12180LOGO)\n\nThe Gartner report points out that, \"by 3Q10, there were more than 30 global smartphone vendors and more than 10 mobile operating-system platforms, although the top four (Apple, Android, RIM and Symbian) control 89% of the total market. Most adopting companies that had previously standardized on a mobile platform (for example, BlackBerry in North America and Symbian in Western Europe) now need to support multiple operating systems, and Apple and Android have become more popular. However, most organizations don't have anyone responsible for managing mobile devices.\"\n\n\"Today's Mobile Device Management has become much more complex and savvy companies must include application management, asset control and device security for their mixed environment of task and information workers,\" said Joe Owen, vice president of engineering for Afaria. \"These requirements are even more urgent with emerging platforms such as Android where MDM capabilities are slowly evolving but enterprises need to provide IT services to these devices in the near term. Sybase and SAP are leading the way to provide a comprehensive solution that meets the complex business mobility needs faced by today's IT managers and allows users to enjoy the benefits of mobile devices in a secure and seamless environment.\"\n\nSybase Afaria is relied upon by enterprises and managed mobility partners around the world to empower the mobile workforce and support IT departments. Sybase Afaria enables enterprise IT to fully manage and secure a wide range of personal and corporate smartphones and tablets including Android, iOS, Windows Mobile, Symbian and more, in both hosted and behind the firewall environments. Additionally, Sybase Afaria's seamless over-the-air (OTA) delivery of in-house and publicly available apps, combined with on-device enterprise portal technology ensures that only approved mobile users are granted access to internal applications and data.\n\nAccording to the Gartner report, \"The MDM market is quickly evolving. The requirements and definitions are changing rapidly, and vendor offerings will evolve quickly and be even more capable and mature by next year. High demand is creating a frenzy of development, as well as hope. Although many of the successful MDM providers have focused almost exclusively on mobility, during the next few years, those managing PCs will also be investing and looking for opportunities in the MDM space. Most vendors now offer on-premises or software-as-a-service (SaaS)-based tools, and more-mature managed service offerings will emerge during the next three years to drive growth in the industry.\"\n\n\"The IT services required in today's enterprises have moved far beyond mobilizing email and with the pervasiveness of today's devices, enterprises are recognizing the importance of controlling and securing applications as part of their overall mobile device management strategy,\" said Oliver Bussman, CIO of SAP. \"Whether considering a SaaS or in-house approach, a comprehensive security strategy is critical to effectively manage mobile data, applications and devices. SAP and Sybase encourage enterprises to address Mobile Device Management within the larger context of their overall mobile application strategy and not as a standalone decision.\"\n\nTo learn more about the 2011 Gartner Mobile Device Management Software Magic Quadrant, Gartner clients may access the report on www.gartner.com.
