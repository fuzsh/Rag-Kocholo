        "text": "The policy covers both Quest and One Identity and is effective for all sites, portals or properties owned or managed by either Quest or One Identity or associated with Products designated with either a “powered by Quest” or “powered by One Identity” logo. References to Quest in this policy document should be read to include One Identity unless the context requires otherwise.\n\nThis privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is applicable to the quest.com and oneidentity.com websites and any other websites owned and operated by Quest Software Inc. (“Quest”), 20 Enterprise, Suite 100, Aliso Viejo, CA 92656 , US, and its subsidiaries or affiliates (referred to as “this Website,” “We”, “our” or “us”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to the websites of our customers or Business Partners or to the websites of any other third parties, even if we have links to their websites on our website.\n\nIf you would like to view this Privacy Policy by country, please click here.\n\nThis Privacy Policy governs information we collect from you when you use any of our products or this Website. This Policy also outlines our specific practices related to collection, use, processing, transfer and/or storage of Personal Data (as defined below) in connection with your purchase, access and use of our SaaS software applications.\n\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, \"Business Partners\" are subcontractors, vendors distributors, resellers and other entities with whom we have ongoing business relationships to provide products, services and information to our customers. “Affiliates” are legal entities that are owned by or under direct common ownership with Quest. \"Personal Data\" means information that can directly or indirectly identify you as an individual, such as your name, telephone number, address, billing information and email address or other similar information.\n\nWhen you use our Website, we may seek your explicit consent to process Personal Data we collect or that you voluntarily provide. In case you do not grant the requested consent for the processing of your Personal Data or if you later inform Quest (in accordance with the “Contact Us” section below) that you do not want Quest to further process your Personal Data, any further use of certain offerings or services of Quest may be either prevented or limited in scope.\n\nWhen do we collect Personal Data?\n\nWe may ask you to provide your Personal Data when you:\n\nUse This Website;\n\nRegister for an account on This Website;\n\nPurchase a SaaS product or Service from This Website;\n\nUse one or more of our SaaS (software-as-a-service) offerings;\n\nRegister products you have purchased from us;\n\nObtain a software trial or update;\n\nContact us, including for sales, professional services or technical support;\n\nParticipate in a call using Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or other teleconference solution;\n\nParticipate in a marketing/sales promotion or an online survey;\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters, promotional emails or other materials;\n\nRequest information about our products, quotes, downloads or white papers;\n\nApply for credit or financing;\n\nRegister for a webinar or to view a webinar recording;\n\nApply for a job, or otherwise enter our recruitment and hiring process\n\nPersonal Data We Collect\n\nQuest collects and processes Personal Data in multiple ways from visitors to this Website whether or not they subscribe to our products. For example, when someone subscribes to an online product or service, we collect that person’s (“Subscriber’s”) first and last name as well as their company’s name, email, and phone number. Once registration is complete, we collect similar information from the person designated by the Subscriber as the designated administrator for the subscription. That administrator may share additional end user information to enable Subscriber’s end users to use the subscribed service. In all of this, however, it is the Subscriber who is responsible for notifying their end users that their information may be collected and shared with Quest as part of their use of the Service.\n\nWhen you visit this Website Quest uses session “cookies” – a piece of information stored on your computer – to allow the Website to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to enable Quest to process your online transactions. Please see the “Use of Cookies” section for further information.\n\nMobile: When you download and use Quest services (including SaaS services) we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, the frequency of usage, application version, operating system version, the time it been used, and the device location.\n\nRecruiting and hiring: We process your Personal Data, such as contact, job applicant data and biographical data, to assess your application and to evaluate and improve our recruitment system, our application tracking and our recruitment activities. You may also provide us with sensitive information like your Social Security Number or government identifier and other Personal Data in connection with your job application. We may use your Personal Data to communicate with you regarding your application for employment in connection with opportunities at Quest that appear over time that we believe may be of interest to you. We also use your Personal Data to send you new hire and employee experience information. We may verify your information, including through reference checks and, where allowed, background checks. Quest and our third-party utility-tracking partners gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.\n\nHow We Use Personal Data\n\nWe use your Personal Data to:\n\nDeliver the products and support or carry out the transactions you have requested;\n\nEstablish a unique account for you to access our SaaS software;\n\nAddress accounting and billing questions and activities;\n\nFor the purposes of identification and authentication for visitors;\n\nSend communications to you, such as:\n\nto contact you about your use of the service,\n\nyour transaction status (for example, order confirmations),\n\ninformation about products and services available from our portfolio and from our affiliated and subsidiary companies,\n\nfor research purposes and to generally improve the content, functionality, and security of the Website and related services,\n\nevent announcements,\n\nimportant product notices including those announcing changes to our terms or policies,\n\ninformation about particular programs in which you have chosen to participate, and\n\nsurveys, promotional offers, periodic newsletters and other related communications.\n\nExecute other actions or processes that may be necessary or useful in order for us to provide the services you have purchased;\n\nAdvertise and market our software product lines by delivering targeted advertisements on This Website and other sites;\n\nAdminister, customize, personalize, analyze and improve our products, services (including the content and advertisements on this Website), technologies, communications and relationship with you;\n\nEnforce our conditions of sale, website terms and/or separate contracts (if applicable) with you;\n\nIf your call is recorded, it may be reviewed for immediate employee training and monitoring purposes;\n\nPrevent fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities;\n\nProtect the security or integrity of this Website, our business, or our products or services; or\n\nTake such other actions or perform such other activities as disclosed to you at the point of collection or as required or permitted by law.\n\nQuest uses Google Analytics and services like AdRoll to advertise online.

We may transmit Personal Data to third party vendors and hosting partners that provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other technology and maintenance services required to operate and maintain this Website and any services, including SaaS that we provide. Transfers to any third parties are covered under the provisions in this Policy and the service agreements with our clients.\n\nWe may also share Personal Data with Business Partners that help us customize, analyze and/or improve our communications or business relationship with you. These communications may include requests relating to our products or services, including SaaS services. As an example, we may share Personal Data to a payment processor who will bill you for services or an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf. In these (and other similar) instances, we will only share Personal Data with Business Partners who share our commitment of protecting your Personal Data and who have agreed in writing to provide protection to your Personal Data that is both in compliance with legal requirements and commensurate with the protections we ourselves provide.

In certain situations, we may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.\n\nBusiness Transitions: If Quest is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, or a corporate reorganization or any other action or transfer between Quest entities, your information may be shared with the new successor entity for continuation of service, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Data.\n\nStatistical analysis: Quest may provide summary or group statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Website information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no Personal Data.\n\nLinks to other sites: This Website contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Quest.
