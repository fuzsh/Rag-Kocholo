You said you downloaded Sybase, and that you wanted to benchmark and confirm some declarations that I made, while re-framing it as \"claims\". I said I encourage any academic moving from their isolated tiled room, into the real world. I gave some cautions, I offered assistance, in that regard. That is to get you merrily on your way, on your stated task.\n\nMy invitation should be not be construed as \"feel free to ask me questions about anything you want\"\n\nFurther, you have to do some work and climb the learning curve yourself.\n\n> What page size (2/4/8/16 KB) and what type of workload (Mixed/OLTP)\n\n> do you configure?\n\nYou have found the manuals. You need to find the SAP Developers Forum or network. Questions of this type, which have many considerations, are discussed and answered there. There are a few SAP/Sybase engineers there, who answer questions.\n\nSG was a Sybase Partner for 17 years, right up to the acquisition by SAP. I was active in the previous Sybase technical forum, and there are many posts (with full discussion) on this and related subjects. You could have just googled the subject plus my name, and you would get your answer. That was 20 years ago. Truth does not change, the answers are still valid.\n\nAfter SAP, that forum has been removed from the internet, it is now archived, in the new SAP developer forum (you can no longer google for the subject matter). Please go there (use the search facility) and read the discussion for considerations, and choose from the answers. Ask away.\n\nSorry, I do not have the time to post duplicate info, or to get into yet another open discussion, about closed subjects.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have a specific question re your stated project, I would be happy to help. No discussion, just the answer.\n\n> What are the strictly technical reasons to prefer ASE over SQL Server?\n\n> Or SQL Server over ASE?\n\nDitto.\n\n> How about this historical assessment:\n\n>\n\n> https://dbdb.io/db/adaptive-server-enterprise\n\nThese days, anyone with a keyboard; two fingers and a bit of tissue connecting those two fingers, can post articles on the internet. They do not have to have any grey cells in that connective tissue, or any actual experience about the subject. Then there is a host of academics, who post negative articles against anything they do not understand, which as you have seen in the last ten years, is an awful lot, due to their proud isolation from reality. Such people, both ordinary idiots, and academically qualified idiots, are unskilled, and worse, unaware that they are unskilled. They think themselves skilled.\n\nThere are a good few scientific papers on the subject (as distinct from the filth that academics in this field produce). This is required reading for anyone who takes my courses. It defines the state of academics in this field, as evidenced in our threads.\n\n__ Unskilled and Unaware 1999, Krüger & Dunning\n\n____ https://www.softwaregems.com.au/Documents/Reference/Unskilled%20%26%20Unaware%201999.pdf\n\n__ Unskilled and Unaware 2008, follow-up, responding to the attacks\n\n____ https://www.softwaregems.com.au/Documents/Reference/Unskilled%20%26%20Unaware%202008.pdf\n\nHence the internet is a cesspool, and as a number of people have stated, it is rare to find a genuine authority on a subject, where answers are direct and permanent, instead of endless discussion without resolution.\n\nChoose what you read carefully.\n\n> Buggy release, mismanagement… Doesn't sound like a product to go after ;-)\n\nYou are right. Drop it. Go back to your freeware herd, the hundreds of programs that pretend to be a server, that pervert SQL, that re-define concepts in order for their broken implementation to appear compliant. Given your recent questions, and your difficulty installing and running commercial products, you will be so much happier there. No need to obtain actual experience in the real world, just rail against it from the safety of the tiled cell.\n\nCheers\n\nDerek\n\nDerek Ignatius Asirvadem\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nNicola\n\n> On Sunday, 29 August 2021 at 04:46:23 UTC+10, Nicola wrote:\n\n> Derek,\n\n> I've gone full speed with some benchmark scripts up and running\n\nExcellent.\n\n> against\n\n> a pretty default ASE installation.\n\nBad idea. The one (benchmark) contradicts the other (simple default db).\n\nYou will be better off:\n\n1. getting a default db geared up to a real db\n\n__ non-default; proper distribution of tables across devices;\n\n2. tranlog set up for purpose; etc);\n\n__ depending on db being (a) Development (no recovery) to ...

(not scientific, but ok)\n\nb. the tranlog needs to be dumped regularly, based on what/how/where you wish to obtain recovery. It is not a simple or binary decision.\n\nc. for a benchmark or production you need an purpose-written sp (because it uses site-specific resources and setting)\n\nd. I have high-activity Production dbs with 500gb data and 100mb tran-log. Ie. the tran-log size is dependent on (i) activity, and (ii) max tran size [which should be small], and (iii) how it gets dumped, which is that sp.\n\nEg. mine are set up for transfer to an DisasterRecovery db (for cut-over if DR ever happens), so the tranlog gets dumped far more frequently than necessary per activity.\n\nFor plain per-activity dumping, for a benchmark, which means somewhat geared up, but not full Production, use a tranlog size of 100mb or 200mb. And deal with i the issues, and get it bedded down, so that the benchmark simulates a real world scenario. (That is what I do for a true benchmark.)\n\n> After several runs of my scripts,\n\n> I have started to get this error:\n\n>\n\n> The transaction log in database scratch is almost full. Your transaction\n\n> is being suspended until space is made available in the log.\n\nBut that is reporting the tran-log in db_name “scratch” not “userdbdev” is full.\n\nThat is correct operation, but you are missing the set-up, and of course understanding.\n\nYou need to read:\n\n_ minimum: Commands manual for DUMP DB and DUMP TRAN, there are good sections for understanding\n\n_ better: System Admin Guide 1, complete manual\n\n_ minimum: System Admin Guide 1, ch 3 (1p4): READ THIS RIGHT NOW\n\n_ minimum: System Admin Guide 1, ch 8 (10p): READ THIS RIGHT NOW\n\nIn Unix, everything is case-sensitive.\n\nSQL is case-insensitive, except for object names. The convention is to use uppercase for commands.\n\n> 1. How do I flush the transaction log?\n\nAfter ANY db is set up, the first thing is, you need a DB-DUMP, to recover the whole DB if necessary.\n\nYou must ensure that the logsegment is actually on the log-device, and not on the data-devices.\n\n> “flush”\n\nIt depends on exactly what you want ...\n\n1> -- [A] Proper manual DB-DUMP, file_path needs to have space-used-in-db\n\n2> DUMP DATABASE <db_name> to <db_file_path>\n\n3> GO\n\n1> -- [B] Proper manual TRAN-DUMP (very first step for understanding):\n\n2> -- file_path needs to have space-used-in-tran-log\n\n3> DUMP TRAN <db_name> to <log_file_path>\n\n3> GO\n\nBut you are much better off defining DUMP-DEVICES.\n\n1> -- [C] When you get 1105 or “log suspended”, it is usually too late, so you need:\n\n2> DUMP TRAN <db_name> WITH TRUNCATE_ONLY\n\n3> -- or worse:\n\n4> DUMP TRAN <db_name> WITH NO_LOG\n\n3> GO\n\nWhich clears the 1105 or “log suspend”, but now recovery on that db is from a DB-dump-file only. So you must DUMP DATABASE to produce a fresh one.\n\n1> -- [D] Development db: set db_name to TRUNCATE tranlog automatically\n\n2> -- tranlog can be very small\n\n1> USE userdbdev\n\n2> GO\n\n1> master..sp_dboption userdbdev, \"trunc log on chkpt\", true\n\n2> GO\n\n1> CHECKPOINT\n\n2> GO\n\n==[E] Set up any db (C) to be automatically tran-log dumped when “full”. That means thresholds on the logsegment, and a threshold stored proc to be executed when the threshold is reached. There can be more than 1 threshold, more than one escape determination. Eg. for tempdb, I TRUNCATE; for production I DUMP, for emergency in tempdb, I kill tasks (which clears their data usage).\n\nTruncate means truncate, not dump. Therefore TRANSACTION recovery is no longer possible. Which means only DATABASE recovery possible (LOAD DATABASE <db_name> FROM <db_file_path>).\n\nIf all goes well, even reasonably, you will never have to LOAD TRAN FROM <log_file_path>. It will be DUMPED or TRUNCATED as planned, and they will be in a planned location if need be, but never get used.\n\nMostly, you will be doing things in a DB, and then DUMP DATABASE at the close of the DDL set up, before the activity (such as a benchmark).\n\nWhen you have the benchmark tables full (eg. some set up as planned), you might DUMP DB before hammering it with UPDATE Xacts.\n\n> 2. How do I monitor the size of the transaction log?\n\n1> USE <db_name>\n\n2> GO\n\n1> sp_helpdb <db_name>\n\n2> GO\n\n(The nuance between USE vs <db_name>..sp_something will be understood later.)\n\n3> sp_helplog\n\n3> sp_helpsegment -- without parms\n\n3> sp_helpsegment logsegment\n\n3> sp_helpthreshold -- without parms\n\n3> sp_helpthreshold logsegment\n\n> 3. How do I avoid the above message in the first place?\n\n(Sorry, I have the details in the reverse order. See above.)\n\nYou can’t work from the err msg backwards.\n\nSybase is not a toy database server (PoopGres is a toy non-server). It takes database recovery seriously. Eg. you might have just LOADed a production database, into a disaster recovery or UAT database container, and have started using it, and your log is not set up (accident). So that tran-log is actually required for recovery, and must not be lost. Hence it is operating correctly.\n\nYou have to take responsibility as a Sybase DBA (welcome to the club).\n\nAny and all config and settings re recovery must be made explicitly.\n\nThe first elemental thing a Sybase DBA has to do, is manage the tran-logs of ALL dbs. (For context, the second elemental thing is to manage tempdb usage.) Sybase provides various options, and methods. The problems can be eliminated/reduced by Standards; good practice; etc. And that too, depends on (a) proper education, (b) extent of need per database, and (c) your ability to code auto-administration scripts and stored procs. Which avoids manual commands upon problem situations arising. Starting with the notion that you can just install Sybase and code a benchmark will be a disaster, I expected that you would read at leaset the SAGs, and get to know what a real server does, how to administer it.\n\nOtherwise the problems will be exposed via err msgs, and then you are reacting, and reacting without set up or knowledge. And this media is not the way to help you reasonably.\n\nGenerally, you have to set up, in this order:\n\n1. think about how you want your DATA vs LOG distributed.\n\n2. think about how you want your RECOVERY to be done (Dev vs Benchmark vs Production).\n\n3. set up DEVICES accordingly\n\n__ I recommend (instead of your 100gb), which must be RAW PARTITIONS (not filesystem-files):\n\n____ 8 x 128MB for DATA (for parallelism)\n\n____ 1 x 128MB for Non-Clustered Indices\n\n____ 1 x 128MB for TRAN-LOG for EACH database SEPARATELY\n\n4. set up your DATABASES accordingly, ala sp_dboption\n\n5. either\n\n__ (D) no recovery (Dev: TRUNC-LOG-ON-CHKPT) or\n\n__ (A) reasonable recovery (Benchmark) or\n\n__ (B) minimum-production-recovery (Production)\n\n6. for (A)(B), set up a threshold at least on the logsegment, to automatically DUMP TRAN\n\n----\n\n> a pretty default ASE installation.\n\nBad idea, if it is intended for a benchmark. Fine, if it is intended for dev; learning. Then you must read the SAGs, get some experience, including handling situations such as this, and then sp_configure each and every config parm that is deemed relevant to a reasonable benchmark config.\n\nSame as setting up your DEVICES correctly. If you don’t, the benchmark will be meaningless.\n\n----\n\nGeneral\n\n1. For admin tasks, most people use a 3rd party DBA Admin tool, such as DBArtisan.\n\nSybase does have a free DB Admin tool, free with a licence for ASE, a very nice GUI (not as amazing as DBArtisan which I have), but I don’t know if it is included in teh dev version (“express edition”). It is called something like “enterprise manager”, look for it.\n\nIf you don’t, you are operating 35 years behind other Sybase DBAs, at isql + scripts level.\n\n2. For SQL coding, most people use an IDE, such as SQLProgrammer. There are many.\n\nWhen I go on short assignments, if the cust does not have [1][2], I download and use Komodo.\n\n3. You have to learn and understand DEVICES and DATA STRUCTURES. Otherwise the benchmark would be nonsense.\n\nFirst, the SAGs.\n\nSecond, a logical overview:\n\n__ https://www.softwaregems.com.au/Documents/Article/Sybase%20Data%20Storage/1%20Data%20Storage%20Unit.html\n\nCheers\n\nDerek"
