Sybase Confidential 2 Agenda • Technology Background • Analytic Model • Architecture • Main Features • Demo\n\n3. Sybase Confidential 3 Background - Overview • Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) • Complex Event Processing / Event Stream Processing • Two approach of CEP/ESP • Real Time Business Intelligence • Two approach of RTBI\n\n4. Sybase Confidential 4 Background - BAM \"Business activity monitoring\" (BAM) is Gartner's term defining how we can provide real-time access to critical business performance indicators to improve the speed and effectiveness of business operations. Unlike traditional real-time monitoring, BAM draws its information from multiple application systems and other internal and external sources, enabling a broader and richer view of business activities.\n\n5. Sybase Confidential 5 Background – ESP/CEP “Event Stream Processing” (ESP) is software technology that allows applications to monitor streams of event data, analyze those events, and act upon opportunities and threats in real time. ESP systems often utilize, or include, event databases and event visualization tools, event-driven middleware, and event processing languages “Complex Event Processing” (CEP) is a key element of ESP that provides language elements that allows applications to express the complex patterns among events it's looking for. CEP provides constructs that include event correlation, event abstraction, event hierarchies, and the ability to express relationships between events such as causality, membership, and timing.\n\n6. Sybase Confidential 6 Two approach of CEP/ESP – SQL Based Approach I Some people coming from RDBMS development have extended SQL to provide CEP/ESP. • The SQL processing in traditional RDBMS is “data is static and query is dynamic”. • The SQL processing in CEP/ESP is “data is dynamic and query is static”. • Because the event data may be overflow, it is necessary to introduce “time window” to SQL\n\n7. Sybase Confidential 7 Two approach of CEP/ESP – SQL Based Approach II SELECT I1.SourceIP As SourceIP, I1.AttackKind As AttackKind, V1.Virus As Virus FROM InIDSAlerts As I1 KEEP 30 SECONDS, InVirusAlerts As V1 KEEP 30 SECONDS WHERE I1.SourceIP=V1.SourceIP Join Projection . . . . . . Scan Scan . . . I1 KEEP 30 SEC I2 KEEP 30 SEC I1 I2\n\n8. Sybase Confidential 8 Two approach of CEP/ESP – Rule Based Approach I Some people come from integration development have extend rule engine to provide CEP/ESP. Sybase BAM chooses this approach. The key of this approach is to add complex state management and corresponding operator to the traditional rule engine that can support complex event pattern and event correlation.\n\n9. Sybase Confidential 9 Two approach of CEP/ESP – Rule Based Approach II Rules States Event Actions\n\n10. Sybase Confidential 10 Background – RT BI “Real time business intelligence” (RT BI) is the process of delivering information about business operations without any latency. While traditional business intelligence presents historical information to users for analysis, real time business intelligence compares current business events with historical patterns to detect problems or opportunities automatically.\n\n11. Sybase Confidential 11 Two approach of RT BI • Event driven, Real time Business Intelligence Real time Business Intelligence systems are event driven, and use ESP/CEP techniques to enable events to be analyzed without being first transformed and stored in a date warehouse. This approach is better for BAM. • Real time Data warehouse An alternative approach to event driven architectures is to increase the refresh cycle of an existing data warehouse to update the data more frequently. These real time data warehouse systems can achieve near real time update of data, where the data latency typically is in the rage from minutes to hours out of date. This approach is better for ETL.\n\n12. Sybase Confidential 12 Analytic Model - Overview Fields: Abstract states definition. Key, Unbound, Bound, Aggregation Rules: Intelligence If condition Then action Actions: Behavior Update, Aggregation, Alert, Timer, SQL, Java Script, Purge Timers: Scheduler If timer arrive Then action Binder: Concrete states storage BAMDB, UserDB, RefAM\n\n13. Sybase Confidential 13 Analytic Model – Processing Fields Key Bound Bound Bound Aggregate Unbound Rules Actions • Update • Aggregate • SQL • Alert • Java Script • Timer control • Purge if… if… 1. Keys, (some) other field passed into Analytic Model 2. Historical values found based on keys 3. Rules applied to data 4. Actions performed, update data 5. Repeat 3, 4 as needed 6. New values stored\n\n14. Sybase Confidential 14 Analytic Model – in SOA Input Fields ----- ----- ----- ----- Output Fields ----- ----- Monitor Service Fields • Key • Unbound • Bound • Aggregate Rules / Actions • Update • Aggregate • Send Alert • SQL • Java Script • Timer Control • Purge Analytic Models / Analytic Objects Fields Rules / Actions Fields Rules / Actions\n\n15. Sybase Confidential 15 Analytic Model - Functionality • Monitor services interact with multiple Analytic Models, setting key fields to define specific object instance. • Within Analytic Object, multiple rule calls trigger actions that further update object and perform other activities. • Any field set in one Analytic Object is then available to subsequent objects, as determined by the Monitor Service. • If there is implicate or explicate key fields setting between different Analytic Objects, record the cross correlation of Analytic Objects. • Service output fields may be return result of any field from any Analytic Object.\n\n16.
