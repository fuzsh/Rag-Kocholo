        "text": "Hopkinton, - January 12, 1998 -\n\nEMC Corporation, the world?s leading provider of intelligent enterprise storage solutions, today announced that Sybase, Inc., has chosen EMC?s Symmetrix Enterprise Storage system as a core storage platform. EMC also announced that its EMC Symmetrix Remote Data Facility (SRDF) and EMC TimeFinder software now provide support for Sybase Adaptive Server databases. SRDF enables users to remotely mirror critical business information, while TimeFinder provides multiple copies of production data for use in application testing.\n\nAs a core storage platform, Sybase developers will utilize a Symmetrix Enterprise Storage system, concurrently connected to several different UNIX and Windows NT servers, to develop versions of Adaptive Server Enterprise. Adaptive Server Enterprise, Sybase?s flagship database product, provides predictable high performance to support the evolving nature of transaction processing in unpredictable environments.\n\nUsers of Adaptive Server Enterprise 11.5 will also be able to utilize EMC?s unique business continuance software. Through SRDF and EMC TimeFinder, residing on Symmetrix, users create real-time, host-independent, mirrored volumes of production-site information at a physically separate site. With TimeFinder, users can create business continuance volumes in background mode of active production volumes for use in application testing, loading data warehouses, running batch jobs and other tasks without disruption to normal business. A single Symmetrix system is capable of simultaneously supporting up to 32 heterogeneous servers, including mainframes, with up to three terabytes of capacity and provides a variety of software-based information sharing, information management and information protection capabilities.\n\n?Sybase selected Symmetrix for core development because of the scalability and flexibility that enable it to provide high performance, high availability storage for every server platform Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise runs on,? said Mike Regan, Vice President and General Manager, Server Products Group, Sybase, Inc. ?By standardizing our development on Symmetrix Enterprise Storage, we?ve created a reliable, fast and consistent storage environment that allows our developers to optimize the performance and features of Adaptive Server Enterprise and other Sybase products on specific servers and operating systems.?\n\nDavid Donatelli, EMC?s Vice President of Enterprise Alliances, said, ?Through innovative products such as SRDF and TimeFinder and our involvement in core development, EMC is demonstrating the value of true enterprise storage. Customers using EMC Symmetrix with TimeFinder and Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise 11.5 are able to gain competitive advantage by quickly and efficiently utilizing their information in data warehouses, data marts and other open systems and NT-based applications.?\n\nThe relationship between EMC and Sybase extends nearly three years to EMC?s entry into the open systems storage market. The two companies have hundreds of joint customers, with many in the transaction-intensive financial services market. During the record levels of trading activity on worldwide financial markets in recent months, EMC and Sybase systems efficiently handled unprecedented transaction demands.
