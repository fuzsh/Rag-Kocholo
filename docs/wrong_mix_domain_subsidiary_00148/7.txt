Customer Success

SAP Sybase IQ AND INFORMATION PROVIDERS Aggregating data and delivering timely answers to complex queries Timely, accurate and detailed information provided by Nielsen Media Research governs the $65 billion TV advertising industry in USA. Data is its lifeblood. Most important to Nielsen Media Research's clients is SAP Sybase IQ's ability to deliver answers to even the most complex queries 10 to 100 times faster than traditional data warehouse technologies. This enables them to sort through enormous volumes of data (the warehouse currently contains 20 terabytes of data and is growing rapidly) to get the intelligence they need to make the most effective and profitable business decisions. ”I would venture to say SAP Sybase IQ is the fastest in the industry.” —Craig Silver, senior database architect of the data technology group at Nielsen

SAP Sybase IQ IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS Reliable operational data store for demanding operators Reducing the complexity of the legacy systems in one of Europe’slargest Telco operator — integrate 11 disparate and independent operating systems and handle rapid increase in data volume totaling more than70 TB and 15000 queries per day from more than 1000 active users. “The model saved between four and six times storage volume required compared to others in the market, with attendant reduction in hardware, support, administration”. —Pedro Romera, Systems Engineering Manager, Telefonica, Spain

SAP Sybase IQ IN BANKING Powering robust enterprise wide analytics ICICI Bank — India's largest private sector bank with presence in 19 countries faced dramatic growth in its users, amount of data, and source stations. The increasing cost of scaling, maintenance, and mounting system unavailability posed difficulties for the bank. To resolve these recurring problems, the bank undertook a migration of the enterprise data warehouse from Teradata to SAP Sybase IQ. The success of this project provides the bank with an always available system, visibly increased query performance, and lower TCO among a host of many other benefits. “Our business requirements were addressed well with minimum infrastructure. SAP Sybase IQ is an excellent product.” —PravirVohra, Group Chief Technology Officer, ICICI Bank

Architecture Details

SAP Sybase IQ Key building blocks SAP Sybase IQ 15 Engine Web Enabled Analytics Communications & Security LoadingEngine Query Engine Admin & Monitoring Framework Multiplex Grid Architecture Information Lifecycle Management Text Search In-Database Analytics Column Indexing Sub-system Industry leading scale & performance Column StorageProcessor Storage Area Network

COLUMN STORE PROCESSOR Introduction • Key characteristics • Data is stored vertically — Each column is stored separately • The data is the index • Large page sizes (128K — 512K) • Persistent row identifiers • Bitmap driven Key Benefits • Unsurpassed concurrent, mixed workload performance, storage efficiencies • Allows queries and updates to only access referenced columns and pages • Single data type and domain per page greatly enhances the effectiveness of dictionary-based compression • Large page size makes better use of modern disk and I/O subsystems • Allows queries to evaluate multiple predicates on the same table using index-based access methods • Allows rows to be uniquely identified without dragging all primary keys (e.g. for DELETES) • Bitmaps enable significant efficiencies — compact representation, easy to horizontally partition, intermediate results, allows perfect prefetch of rows avoiding cache misses and LRUs

COLUMN STORE PROCESSOR Leading data compression technology Page level compression LZW compression with implicit dictionary Enumerated fast projection indexes Distinct values stored in vector Column stores vector ordinals Bitmaps ROWIDs stored in multiple formats Format based on locality of ROWIDs Column 2 1 Ordinal Value 1 1 “Wide Data” 2 2 “Wider Data” 1 1 1, {3-99}, {200-999}, {1295: 10001110101} Single Ranges Bit vector

COLUMN INDEXING SUB-SYSTEM Powerful performance booster Key characteristics • Most columns will have at least one index • Index selection decisions based on column cardinality (number of unique values) • Indexes and columns are stored separately • Multiple indexes used to resolve a query • Indexes are self maintaining • No optimizer statistics to update • Indexes are compressed • Index advisor demystifies index selection

COLUMN INDEXING SUB-SYSTEM Optimized Fast Projection (FP) indexes is the column store itself Unique values for a column stored in a lookup table and optimized FP requires 1, 2, or 3 bytes based on cardinality Optimized FP indexes covers a broad spectrum of data (> 3 bytes data) FP(1) = 2^8 = 256 unique values FP(2) = 2^16 = 65,536 unique values FP(3) = 2^24 = 16,777,216 unique values Reduced storage for columns with cardinality between 65,536 and 16,777,216 Reduced I/O Writes during data loading Reads during query processing Improved query processing Reduced memory in query execution as the expansion of FP’s is delayed More vector processing FP(3) More complete optimizer statistics on column data distributions and counts Fast project indexes

COLUMN INDEXING SUB-SYSTEM Low fast indexes Low Fast (LF) indexes filters low cardinality fields with bitmaps Sample query:select count(*) from customers where state = ‘NY’ and class = ‘A’ • Filter low cardinality fields with bitmaps • Bit position correspond to fixed row ID • Bitmaps further reduce the amount of data read • Small number of bits rather than entire field • Bit algebra — ANDing and ORing bitmaps is very efficient with today’s processors • Note that even vertically stored data is not read

COLUMN INDEXING SUB-SYSTEM High Group (HG) Indexes help with high cardinality data sets HG index characteristics Useful for high cardinality (> 1000 unique values) Ideal for GROUP BY, COUNT (DISTINCT), SELECT DISTINCT Frequently used as primary key and in multiple columns Examples: Zip codes, customer ids HG index structure B-tree structure High group index points to an array of record ids High group indexes

COLUMN INDEXING SUB-SYSTEM High Non-Group (HNG) Indexes is ideal for data with large number of values stored in binary form Data sliced vertically so each bit position can be manipulated separately Many bit positions are either all on or all off so no storage space is required System only needs to store mixed bitmaps (1s and 0s) Typical storage is 10-20% of size of raw data High non-group indexes

COLUMN INDEXING SUB-SYSTEM Word index The like query operator will call the Word Index as in the predicate below where company_namelike ‘% Sybase %’ Text index The contains query operator will call the Text Index as in the predicate below where contains (TextCol, ‘a AND NOT b’) Compare index is an index on relationship b/w two columns Stores comparison bitmap of (<, >, or =) of its two columns Date / Time / DateTime indexes Range searches Datepart searches Other indexing techniques

COLUMN INDEXING SUB-SYSTEM Multiple indexes in query processing Example select sum(sales) from customers where state = ‘NY’ and class = ‘A’ SAP Sybase IQ will use the LF indexes to filter rows and then apply to HNG to compute the sum Minimal amount of data is read to resolve the query Using multiple indexes • Index advisor: • Run sample queries and index advisor provides index building advice • Index building is a relatively simple exercise
