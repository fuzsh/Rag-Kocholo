        "text": "Pablo Neruda (1904 – 1973) was a poet, activist, and politician. He was the author of more than fifty books, many of them books of poetry such as his famous Veinte poemas de amor y una cancion desesperada (1924) and Canto General (1950). In 2016, the first complete English translation of Neruda’s Fin del Mundo (World’s End) (1969) was translated by William O’Daly and published by Copper Canyon Press. Neruda received numerous awards, including the National Prize for Literature of Chile, the Stalin Peace Prize, and the 1971 Nobel Prize for Literature."
