        "text": "Synopsis\n\nAn appeals court in Chile has decided to reopen the case of Pablo Neruda's death, a Nobel Prize-winning poet, citing insufficient investigation. The court's ruling follows claims by Neruda's nephew, Rodolfo Reyes, who suggested that Neruda may have been poisoned. This decision revives a long-standing debate over the cause of Neruda's death, officially attributed to cancer. The court has ordered further procedures, including analyzing the death certificate and forensic test results.\n\nIn a recent development, an appeals court in Santiago, Chile, has ruled to reopen the case regarding the death of renowned poet and Nobel Prize winner Pablo Neruda. The decision comes after Neruda's nephew, Rodolfo Reyes, raised concerns about the official cause of death listed as cancer. Reyes, supported by forensic experts from Canada, Denmark, and Chile, presented evidence suggesting that Neruda may have died of poisoning more than 50 years ago.\n\nThe court's decision overturns a previous ruling that rejected Reyes' request to reopen the case. The new investigation aims to clarify the circumstances surrounding Neruda's death, which occurred just 12 days after the 1973 military coup in Chile that brought General Augusto Pinochet to power. Neruda was set to leave Chile for exile in Mexico but died before he could depart.\n\nDespite official assertions that Neruda died of complications from prostate cancer, his driver has long maintained that the poet was poisoned. Previous forensic tests in 2013 on Neruda's exhumed body did not find any toxic agents or poisons, but the recent evidence presented by Reyes has prompted the appeals court to order further procedures.\n\nThese procedures include a calligraphic analysis of Neruda's death certificate, a meta-analysis of the forensic test results, and subpoenas for statements from experts on Clostridium botulinum, a bacterium linked to the alleged poisoning. The court's decision reflects a renewed effort to investigate Neruda's death and address long-standing suspicions of foul play.\n\nPablo Neruda, known for his passionate love poems and his affiliation with the Communist Party, was a close friend of President Salvador Allende, who died during the military coup. Neruda's death has remained a topic of debate and speculation, with many questioning the circumstances surrounding his untimely demise.\n\nThe court's decision to reopen the investigation into Neruda's death underscores the ongoing interest in uncovering the truth behind this significant event in Chilean history.\n\n(With inputs from AP)\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n4 reasons why MFs are stocking up on CreditAccess Grameen and other microfinance lenders\n\nOnce declared dead, Nifty Next 50 is up 70%.
