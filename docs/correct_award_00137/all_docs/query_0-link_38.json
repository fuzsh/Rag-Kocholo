There's such a sensuous, tactile quality to his poetry that makes you think he just might have been one hell of a lover. And mixed in with this earthy prose is an appreciation for the subtle, fleeting moments that last only in quick impressions and memories of wanting and desire. In one moment he tells us of the heavy weight and feel as he cups the rounded breasts of his mistress and the next he sighs his longing for the ability to devour the parts of her that linger in his memory whole. Truly the love poet for the modern age :\n\nI crave your mouth, your voice, your hair.\n\nSilent, starving I prowl through the streets.\n\nBread does not nourish me, dawn disquiets me,\n\nI search the liquid sound of your steps all day.\n\nI hunger for your sleek laugh,\n\nFor your hands the color of the wild grain,\n\nI hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails,\n\nI want to eat your skin like a whole almond.\n\nI want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your loveliness,\n\nThe nose, sovereign of your arrogant face,\n\nI want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes,\n\nAnd I walk hungry, smelling the twilight\n\nLooking for you, for your hot heart,\n\nLike a puma in the barren wilderness.\n\nOne thing I will say about this particular copy though is that while it is certainly the most comprehensive edition available to English speakers, it is not, perhaps, the best translated. Kudos to the editors for managing to put it all together though - and I do believe credit is due for not sticking to one translator for the whole thing. However when comparing certain works against others it becomes apparent that not all translators do their transcribing equally. Oh well, I suppose you have to go with what's available to you at the time. Obviously not all my favorites have done every single poem and I do appreciate the effort to use the superior translation when available.\n\nAugust 20, 2022\n\nMy soul is empty carousel at sunset.\n\n*\n\nI copy out mountains, rivers, clouds.\n\nI take my pen from my pocket. I note down\n\na bird in its rising\n\nor a spider in its little silkworks.\n\nNothing else crosses my mind. I am air,\n\nclear air, where the wheat is waving,\n\nwhere a bird’s flight moves me, the uncertain\n\nfall of a leaf, the globular\n\neye of a fish unmoving in the lake,\n\nthe statues sailing in the clouds,\n\nthe intricate variations of the rain.\n\nNothing else crosses my mind except\n\nthe transparency of summer. I sing only of the wind,\n\nand history passes in its carriage,\n\ncollecting its shrouds and medals,\n\nand passes, and all I feel is rivers.\n\nI stay alone with the spring.\n\nFebruary 16, 2020\n\nRomance and War\n\nI walked into Coalesce Bookstore in the quaint town of Morro Bay, CA and ended up in their poetry section. I saw Pablo Neruda’s name written on a book and pulled it off the shelf and began reading his poems on war, on politics. I put the book back on the shelf and began to walk out of the store. When I got to the door, I stopped, turned around and went back to read some more of his poems. I put it back on the shelf and began to walk away again. I stopped, grabbed the book and bought it. It was my introduction to Pablo Neruda, who won the Noble Prize for poetry.\n\nOver the years I have picked up this book to read a few poems, but I never really read them all. I did it now, but I am finding that they were more meaningful when I read only a few at a time.\n\nI began at the beginning of the book this time, with his love poems. It appeared to me that his love poems are as passionate as those of his on war and death. Either he is bursting with passionate love or in the deep despair of war. The love poems are filled with a touch of erotica. I felt that this man was more interested in making love to a woman than in knowing her soul. Perhaps, I should not judge, but at least I saw the beauty in each poem. I had never read them before, because I was only interested in his politics.\n\nAs to his poems on war, they were depressing to me as I kept reading one after another. He must have written about every invasion in the in South America and in Spain.\n\nI wish to share one with you that contains both love and war:\n\n“…I have not left you when I go away.\n\nNow I am going to tell you:\n\nMy land will be yours,\n\nI am going to conquer it,\n\nNot just to give it to you,\n\nBut for everyone,\n\nfor my people…\n\nYou will come with me to fight\n\nface to face\n\nbecause your kisses live\n\nlike red banners,\n\nand if I fall, not only\n\nWill earth cover me\n\nbut also this great love\n\nthat you brought me\n\nand that lived circulating\n\nin my blood.\n\nYou will come with me,\n\nat that hour I wait for you,\n\nat that hour and at every hour\n\nI wait for you…\n\nbecause I am a soldier…\n\nMy love, I wait for you in the\n\nharshest desert\n\nand next to the flowing\n\nlemon tree,\n\nin every place where\n\nthere is life,\n\nwhere spring is being born…”\n\nAugust 4, 2007\n\nbreathtaking, heart wrenching, soul awakening -- Neruda is love ...\n\n\"I do not love you as if you were salt-rose, or topaz,\n\nor the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off.\n\nI love you as certain dark things are to be loved,\n\nin secret, between the shadow and the soul.\n\nI love you as the plant that never blooms\n\nbut carries in itself the light of hidden flowers;\n\nthanks to your love a certain solid fragrance,\n\nrisen from the earth, lives darkly in my body.\n\nI love you without knowing how, or when, or from where.\n\nI love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride;\n\nso I love you because I know no other way\n\nthan this: where I does not exist, nor you,\n\nso close that your hand on my chest is my hand,\n\nso close that your eyes close as I fall asleep.\"\n\nJuly 10, 2009\n\nLOVE HIM...an excerpt from my favorite poem...\n\nI no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.\n\nMy voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.\n\nAnother's. She will be another's. Like my kisses before.\n\nHer voice. Her bright body. Her inifinite eyes.\n\nI no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.\n\nLove is so short, forgetting is so long.\n\nBecause through nights like this one I held her in my arms\n\nmy soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.\n\nDecember 22, 2021\n\nNeruda. The name could be synonymous with soul. Don’t think he’s just great at love poems. He is, but give him any subject and he’ll treat it like a tender lover. I adore him, and reading this every day for two months, learned that there is no such thing as too much Neruda.\n\nThis volume incorporates multiple translators, sometimes giving two translations of the same poem, and I found it fascinating how different the result could be. Of course I liked some more than others. But every one of these, amazingly, had something to say to me.\n\nA much more in-depth biography than I expected appears at the end, arranged into sections by Neruda’s poetry collections. It illuminates what was going on in his life during the writings, and makes me want to start over at the beginning and read the biography and the poetry together. That will be the plan for my next of many re-reads.\n\nI’ve quoted enough while I was reading in my updates, but I can’t resist just a few more.\n\nI think my favorite, one of the most powerful poems ever written, was \"The Earth’s Name is Juan,\" which begins:\n\n“Juan followed upon the liberators\n\nworking, fishing and fighting,\n\nin his carpentry work or in his damp mine.\n\nHis hands have plowed the earth and measured the roads.\n\nHis bones are everywhere.\n\nBut he’s alive. He returned from the earth. He was born.\n\nHe was born again like an eternal plant.\n\nAll the impure night tried to submerge him\n\nand today he affirms his indomitable lips in the dawn.\n\nThey bound him, and he’s now a determined soldier.\n\nThey wounded him, and he’s still hearty as an apple.\n\nThey cut off his hands and today he pounds with them.\n\nThey buried him, and he sings along with us.”\n\nNo wait. That’s the most powerful, but I think my favorite is \"My Dog Has Died,\" because these lines!\n\n“He already left with his coat,\n\nhis bad manners, his cold nose.\n\nAnd I, a materialist who does not believe\n\nin the starry heaven promised\n\nto a human being\n\nfor this dog and for every dog\n\nI believe in heaven, yes, I believe in a heaven\n\nthat I will never enter, but he waits for me\n\nWagging his big fan of a tail\n\nso I, soon to arrive, will feel welcomed.”\n\nThis is how it went for me, poem after poem, “This one! No, this one!” as he pummeled my heart to little pieces and then swept up the bits to make another beautiful creation.\n\nFinally, this, from “I Ask for Silence”\n\n“I have lived so much that someday\n\nthey will have to forget me forcibly,\n\nrubbing me off the blackboard\n\nMy heart was inexhaustible.”\n\nTruer words ...\n\nAugust 26, 2010\n\nI have loved Pablo Neruda since I was fifteen years old and have fell in love with his beautiful expressions countless times. I believe his raw passion speaks to all of us on a universal level. It's so human and bare, it is his monument left to us. This is an amazing collection which begins with his early work to his retrospective years, it shows you this amazing evolution of his writing and how powerful it becomes.\n\nAugust 15, 2016\n\nI Liked Pablo Neruda's writing, I believe his raw passion speaks to all of us on a universal level. It's so human and bare, it is his monument left to us. This is an amazing collection which begins with his early work to his retrospective years, it shows you this amazing evolution of his writing and how powerful it becomes. Some poems really hit home where some of them really confused me. These poems really made this book a quite interesting read for me.\n\nAnd I in these lines say:\n\nLike this I want you, love,\n\nlove, Like this I love you,\n\nas you dress\n\nand how your hair lifts up\n\nand how your mouth smiles,\n\nlight as the water\n\nof the spring upon the pure stones,\n\nLike this I love you, beloved...\"\n\n-Pablo Neruda\n\nI no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.\n\nMy voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.\n\nAnother's. She will be another's. Like my kisses before.\n\nHer voice. Her bright body. Her inifinite eyes.\n\nI no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.\n\nLove is so short, forgetting is so long.\n\nBecause through nights like this one I held her in my arms\n\nmy soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.\n\n\"I will bring you happy flowers from the mountains, bluebells, dark hazels, and rustic baskets of kisses.\n\nI want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees.\"\n\nYou discovered\n\nHis thoughts,\n\nHis words, his love,\n\nHis passionate\n\nIntensity\n\nIn a tiny book\n\nThat's now\n\nWell-fingered.\n\nThen you added your own\n\nUnique voice, your arms\n\nYour legs, your body\n\nAnd your love,\n\nSo that in turn\n\nYou might be loved\n\nAnd you were\n\nAnd still, my heart,\n\nAgain, you are.\n\nThis is definitely my first book of Pablo's but not the last. I am looking forward to his writing. Highly Recommended to poetry & Classic Lovers.\n\nMarch 31, 2013\n\n\"The sad wind goes on slaughtering butterflies...\" The word \"butterfly\" is such a beautiful word in almost all the languages I know. In Spanish \"mariposa\", French \"papillon\", Danish \"sommerfugl\" and Swedish \"fjäril\". Only in Germany could they call it Schmetterling and then on top of it give the name to a fighter plane...\n\nFebruary 29, 2008\n\nI'm not big on poetry. I've read the classics - Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Donne, etc. I've read the epic poems - Iliad, Odyssey, Gilgamesh. But modern era poetry usually leaves me cold--too much angst and unrequited love. However, I am always left floored by Neruda. Ode to Common Things got me into Neruda and remains one of my all time favorites. He is mostly famous for his love poems; and, while they are extraordinary, they are not IMHO his best. Neruda sees the epic and timeless connections in...well...in everything. Spoons and salt shakers are the common man's connection with history and heaven. Love and life and death are found in unexpected places. I just received this volume of his poetry which covers most of his work, some of which I've read and some which I will certainly read over and over again. I wish I was fluent in Spanish so I could read this in the original as I have no doubt something is lost in the translation. Buty what is not lost is priceless.\n\nMay 2, 2019\n\nاحساس می کنم سیروس شاملو برای شعریت بخشیدن به ترجمه خودش از اشعار نرودا\n\nاونها را شهید کرده\n\nواقعاً نمی تونستم بپذیرم نرودا اونهمه شهرتش را به خاطر سرودن چنین شعرهایی به دست آورده باشه\n\nو به این نتیجه رسیدم که مترجم کارش یه جاهایی لنگ می زنه\n\nAugust 4, 2007\n\nThis book is the quintessential poetry book. Neruda is untouchable and this compilation is the best. If my house was burning and I could only run out with one book it would be a close call between this and Lorca's compilation. You could be stranded on a desert island with this book for the rest of your life and you would have a smile on your face. Y ahora, pido silencio.\n\nJanuary 2, 2015\n\nO Grande Oceano\n\nSe os teus dons e das tuas destruições,\n\nOceano, as minhas mãos\n\npudesse destinar uma medida, uma fruta, um fermento,\n\nescolheria o teu repouso distante, as linhas do teu aço,\n\na tua extensão vigiada pelo ar e pela noite,\n\ne a energia do teu idioma branco\n\nque destroça e derruba as suas colunas\n\nna sua própria pureza demolida.\n\nNão é a última onda com o seu salgado peso\n\na que tritura costas e produz\n\na paz de areia que rodeia o mundo:\n\né o central volume da força,\n\na potência estendida das águas,\n\na imóvel solidão cheia de vidas.\n\nTempo, talvez, ou taça acumulada\n\nde todo movimento, unidade pura\n\nque não selou a morte,verde víscera\n\nda totalidade abrasadora.\n\nDo braço submerso que levanta uma gota\n\nnão fica senão um beijo do sal.Dos corpos\n\ndo homem nas tuas margens uma húmida fragrância\n\nde flor molhada permanece.

Breathtaking stuff.\n\nSeptember 6, 2009\n\nAn anthology of Pablo Neruda's poems translated into English.\n\nWith over 600 poems, this is a large and fairly representative collection covering sonnets, odes, cantos and free verse drawn from across the poet's entire career. I have been reading it on and off for a fairly long time but I still have not finished reading all of it, having skimmed through some parts and skipped others altogether primarily for two reasons: the difficulty, sometimes, in establishing the context, and the problems associated with the language barrier.\n\nThere's always this thing about poetry and the milieu in which it is written- some poems draw only on shared human experience and so need little by way of a background- as with a great deal of love poetry, while for others, the entire meaning can hinge on the reader's awareness or ignorance of its context; the former therefore tends to be more durable and has broader appeal. Neruda's love poetry is no exception - it is exquisite and extremely accessible; but I struggled with his epic poetry for I do not know enough of the context or the details of the provenance for quite a bit of it.\n\nThe problem is persistent; even for a poem that purely describes nature, when we read '..and it is here that the world ends.' we can infer from the context that it is a place that is being spoken of and not a moment in time; but we do not know what place that is. Pedantic as it may seem, it matters whether the place the poet had in mind was off Cape Horn or the middle of the Atacama desert, especially because the verse is rooted so deeply in the land, its people and their traditions- often, both history and geography are intertwined to inform the narrative, so this isn't poetry that describes a continent as much as defines it:\n\nThe poisonous skin of the copper, the nitrate salt spread out\n\nlike a statue, crumbled and snowy: they're mine, but not\n\nonly them: also the vineyards, the cherries the spring rewards,\n\nthey are mine too, and I belong to them, like a black atom\n\nin the arid land, in the autumn light on the grapes,\n\nin this metallic homeland lifted by towers of snow.\n\nBards of course, are the bearers of literary ambrosia, but it is not merely when they concern themselves with the heroic canon that poets have the power to grant immortality; they can take everyday experiences and imbue them with deep significance, distill the wistful and extract the poignant, transform the merely special to the truly magical and in so doing make our ordinary lives a little less so.\n\nIt is said of Neruda that he caresses words, and that there is great beauty in his use of the language; and doubtless this must be true, but though the original poem in Spanish often appears along with the English translation here, for those of us who do not understand both languages, there is no way to really appreciate it. And not knowing just how much the spirit of the original is captured in the translation can be frustrating too; but this is not to take away from the quality of the translations - even in the English versions there is no denying the moments when the breath comes unstitched and the heart misses a beat.\n\nThe oeuvre of the poet who was the 'voice of the voiceless' is immensely prolific, yet incredibly versatile and so defies easy analysis. It goes through the entire spectrum- passionate, sad, tender, political, ornate, erotic, whimsical - witness the 'Ode to the Artichoke'- and at times dull and prosaic, but it is always original, and there are gems to be found even in his lesser known works. There is something charming about his politically motivated poetry too; quaint the anti-capitalistic tirades, Nixon-bashing and the Marxist espousal may seem now, but there is no mistaking the emotional intensity, the earnestness of feeling, the conviction of belief and the love of the utopian ideal that underlies it.\n\nThis is a good book to pick up on a lazy afternoon and dip into at random, and I intend to revisit it again -and often, in the future; yo volveré - as the poet says.\n\nOctober 11, 2014\n\nFour and a half stars. I’m not sure how I managed to get through life to this point with only having read a couple of Pablo Neruda’s poems, so it was with great delight at a recent Lifeline book fair I picked up this single volume of his works, around 600 poems. Since I don’t read Spanish, I am reading them translated. But some also have the Spanish originals alongside them, which is interesting.\n\nAs with any collection some poems appealed to me more than others. I’m not going to name them because I suspect that next time I pick up this book and dip into the poems those favourites, like the tide, may have changed. And this is one book of poems that I have no doubt I will return to again and again.\n\nOver all, I found the lucid writing, imagery and passion (and not just sexual passion) but passion for the land and for justice among other things drew me in. I would highly recommend this collection to anyone who does not read poetry normally as Neruda is largely an accessible poet with an eye for detail. Those who do read poetry will appreciate the skill involved in creating these poems.\n\nRead\n\nNovember 1, 2021\n\nToday I learnt that romantic poetry was not for me. I think I'll probably like it more if I'm in a certain sort of situation that would make me resonate with the author, so maybe I'll pick this up again if I fall in love with a white woman sometime in the future. I don't know how to critique poetic writing because I think it's so subjective and varies according to a person's taste, but he does use beautiful words and nice descriptions? (Nice as in that's a critically good move but not something that I feel so strongly about).\n\nP.S. I did only read around 5 poems before realising that I feel nothing about all of them and dnfed so maybe I made a rash decision and it's not so bad!! But for me if I don't vibe with poetry I don't want to push it, it's quite different from novels! Besides, it's 1040 pages long (rip). Sure, it's poetry!! But the page count is daunting nevertheless :(\n\nOctober 18, 2010\n\nBeautiful, hits me in places where few poets have managed to reach.\n\nMay 9, 2022\n\na 1000 pager. Took me a year of it sitting bedside.\n\nJune 10, 2022\n\nI wish this book could be my new favourite but SADLY it wasnt. The writing style just wasnt for me. I loved some of his later work but the first few poems made no sense to me at all\n\nNovember 21, 2018\n\nNeruda's poetry is absolutely EXQUISITE. As this was the first ever poetry book I picked up, I wasn't sure how to go through the comprehensive collection, so I hopscotched and finished Residence, Canto General and Isla Negra in the end as these looked more serious or long sections. (And my mind always like it easy and short).\n\nThe following lines from \"Ode to The Book I\" strikes a chord in my heart and I believe Neruda lived what he wrote and he sure did love well.\n\nI’ve learned to take life from life,\n\nto love after a single kiss,\n\nand I didn’t teach anything\n\nto anyone except what I myself lived...\n\nOne suggestion to anyone, new to poetry like me, is to first read the notes glossed by Stavans about each book before you read the poems. I realized it later, but it is useful to know about the undercurrent of each book. The editor has done a fantastic job and I would like to trust that nothing got lost in translation. Stavans has selected poems from 33 of Neruda's books (listed below). The books include poems on the common themes of love, sensuality, expressions on the art of loving and longing, despair, then, moves on to feelings of solitude and remoteness. The collection then takes us through some compelling, social and politically conscious poetry - and it's quite evident how Neruda was the poet of exile, the voice of displacement, the rebel poet. The book has memoirs of sorrowful and painful events - betrayal and bloodshed. In various poems, Neruda recalls the children being bit, burnt, chained etc and there have been expressions to suggest that ultimately, brutality extricates the sufferers from their body. Truly gut wrenching! Neruda is obviously filled with sadness and nostalgia in these poems where he talks about the war, racial conflicts and it's aftermath. Nevertheless, he goes on to create a sense of justice and beauty. In the subsequent books, the reader sees a return or restoration to his former self, and the poetry becomes more and more personal on the themes of lasting love, house, nature, birds, a healthy solitude, and looking at death with a kind of peace. It is completely enthralling to read how Neruda has embraced in his poetry, the myriad of materials of this universe - sand, salts, stones, waves, wasps etc. Love, beauty and empathy, however remains the leitmotifs of his poetry. (He even wrote poems titled \"To a Poor Dead Man,\" and 'The Dog Dies.' Deep and moving! In reading this book, one realizes they are not just reading poetry - but the poet's odyssey and of all those known to him- and each poem had a tale to tell which completely stirs you.\n\nHere's the list of books and some of my favorite poems from them- (I don't know how the reviews must be written, but a thing is the same kind of beautiful just once, so I thought it was imperative of me to put my impressions on this collection out there. In future, I will come back to it, with more layers to his poems unraveled)\n\n1. Book of Twilight - The starting poem itself blew me away, the lover is an adult and child all at once!\n\n2. Twenty Love Poems And A Song of Despair\n\nXX.\n\n\"I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.\n\nLove is so short, forgetting is so long.\"\n\n3. Residence on Earth I AND II, Third Residence\n\nThis selection wasn't overall as per my taste but I did like it in parts. The poems are quite lyrical, written on the theme of solitude and remoteness.\n\n\"Tyranny\" was a favorite from Residence I -\n\nA time complete as an ocean,\n\na wound confused as a new being\n\nencompass the stubborn root of my soul\n\nbiting the center of my security.\"\n\n\"Only Death\" from Residence II\n\nBut death also goes through the world dressed as a broom,\n\nshe licks the ground looking for corpses,\n\ndeath is in the broom,\n\nit is death's tongue looking for dead bodies,\n\nit is death's needle looking for thread.\n\n4. Canto General\n\nAh! This collection was difficult to read, and more serious poetry, with some chilling account of suffering of children, chained and burned. This one line from \"The Liberators\" struck with me : \"Your lips sealed by death are the purest entombed silence.\"\n\n5. The Captain's Verses\n\nThe most beautiful collection where he sees the earth in his lover, calls her a queen, sees her as clay for his potter hands. The poems are a dedication of his blazing love and passion for Matilde Urrutia. Neruda first published this collection in anonymity because he didn't want to hurt Urrutia's predecessor, Delia del Carril, who he admitted (in Memoirs) was his perfect mate for 18 years.\n\n- \"September 8\" is a favorite because it talks about \"The Third Body/Thing\" which poets like Donald Hall have talked as an 'essence' being shared between him and his wife, Jane Kenyon and, Robert Bly speaks of it in \"A Man And A Woman Sit Near Each Other.\"\n\n- \"The Son\" is the most heart warming read on the birth of a son, but it goes beyond the phenomenon of birth itself. Go read!\n\n- \"Your Laughter\" is a poem loved by all. (...but do not take from me your laughter. Ah!)\n\n6. Elemental Odes\n\nA stunning collection - one will be astonished at the number of common things Neruda was capable of writing odes to.\n\n7. Extravagaria\n\nFavorites from this collection were \"THE UNHAPPY WOMAN (which really overwhelmed me) and \"Autumn Testament.\"\n\n8. Voyages and Homecomings.\n\n9. One Hundred Love Sonnets -My favorite was XC in Night.\n\n10. Song of Protest - The only poem I grasped well was \"So Is My Life\"\n\n11. The Stones of Chile-\n\nFrom 'To the Traveler'\n\n\"I know this at great cost,\n\nthat all life is not outward,\n\nnor all death within\"\n\n12. Ceremonial Songs. - The selection has poems on the theme of torture, bloodshed and death. Women are the subject of those poems.\n\n13. Fully Empowered - Most delightful read \"To Wash A Child\"\n\n14. Isla Negra - About the many things that makes the Island beautiful, including his house. I loved Terusa I and II.\n\n15. Art of Birds - (Mockingbirds, Albatross, Pelicans, Pigeons) - Neruda has learnt from all.\n\n16. A House in the Sand - About his house on the Isla Negra, marked by his lover Urrutia's presence in the poem 'Love for this Book.'\n\n17. La Barcarola - The Watersong Ends is a telling of his story to Matilde, about his travels through the jungles, in solitude, and awakening to a divinity and connectedness among all men. It is also reflective of a hope for utopianism.\n\n\"we go on loving love\n\nand in our blunt way\n\nwe bury the liars and live among the truth-tellers.\n\n18. The Hands of Day - Guilty\n\n19. World's End - The Seeker\n\n20. Seaquake\n\n21. Still Another Day - on the theme of solitude.\n\n22. The Flaming Sword - XVIII 'Someone' about the first encounter of man and woman.\n\nHe was so afraid, he found a woman.\n\nShe was like a hedgehog,\n\nlike a chestnut.\n\nShe was an edible being,\n\nbut man needed her.\n\nThe two were unique,\n\nreborn from the earth\n\nand fated for love or destruction.\n\n23. Stones From The Sky : Neruda writes about silence is intensified into a stone. He not only makes your thoughts revel about exquisite stones like the Ethiopian basalt, the emerald of Colombia or the quartz, but even the mundane dusty stones of the road. (Ah, I'm in awe of how he looked at the world, like nothing should be left out).\n\n24. Barren Terrain\n\n25. The Separate Rose\n\nFrom Men II : \"We all arrive by different streets,\n\nby unequal languages, at Silence.\"\n\n26. A Call For The Destruction of Nixon and Praise for the Chilean Revolution : The Judgment was a short yet a soul stirring poem.\n\n27. The Sea and the Bells\n\n28. 2000 : Celebration of mankind's struggle to survive.\n\n29. Elegy\n\n30. The Yellow Heart\n\n31. Winter Garden : A Dog Has Died\n\n32. The Book of Questions\n\n33. Selected Failings : Sad Song To Bore Everyone\n\nThe last section is called \"Homage: Fourteen Other Ways of Looking at Pablo Neruda\" where several translators have picked their favorite poems of Neruda.\n\n(25, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33) were published posthumously.\n\nJanuary 22, 2019\n\n“I love things with a wild passion, extravagantly.”\n\n--Pablo Neruda\n\nPablo Neruda declared love with an inebriated tongue of flaming gold. The poet came from the people, and for them he sang. The poet molded ingots of song from mud, ash, and leaf-- into which he then sprinkled crushed emerald and lapis lazuli for ornament and for color. The mortar he mixed with sweat, blood, and uric acid.\n\nPablo Neruda (1904-1973)-- the Chilean poet, exile, politician, and winner of the 1971 Nobel Prize-- loved with a reckless abandon, and it spilled over into words—hundreds of thousands of glittering and loamy words. Four themes dominate his thousands of poems: love; nature; politics; and Neruda himself. But love is the leitmotif that links all themes as one.\n\n1) Love\n\nMost people will be attracted to Neruda’s love poems and songs of despair. Neruda was a lover of women, three of whom especially inflame his poetry. Much of the love poetry is tangled, moist, rich and earthy. This sonnet is one of my favorites:\n\nI do not love you as if you were salt-rose, or topaz,\n\nor the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off.\n\nI love you as certain dark things are to be loved,\n\nin secret, between the shadow and the soul.\n\nI love you as the plant that never blooms\n\nbut carries in itself the light of hidden flowers;\n\nthanks to your love a certain solid fragrance,\n\nrisen from the earth, lives darkly in my body.\n\nI love you without knowing how, or when, or from where.\n\nI love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride;\n\nso I love you because I know no other way\n\nthan this: where I do not exist, nor you,\n\nso close that your hand on my chest is my hand,\n\nso close that your eyes close as I fall asleep.\n\nSome of his love poems are explicitly sexual, and you will find many metaphors related to the secret organs of the earth: raucous roots piercing pungent soil; ships (vaginas), and swords, and sea foam.\n\nBody of woman, white hills, white thighs,\n\nYou look like the world in your posture of surrender.\n\nMy savage peasant body digs through you\n\nAnd makes the son leap from the depth of the earth.\n\nBut Neruda’s love poetry is tinged with sadness and despair:\n\nTo feel you in my veins like God in the rivers and adore you in the sorrowful bones of dust and lime.\n\nYour breasts smell of honeysuckle while the sad wind goes slaughtering butterflies.\n\n2) Nature\n\nLet Neruda be your effusive tour guide into the heart of South American mountains, pampas, jungles, and tundra. He wrote odes celebrating all of his continent's biodiversity and terrain and some were very long, Whitmanesque catalogs of flora and fauna. The biophilist in me responded to his many individual odes celebrating the earth and its land features and forms; its rocks and minerals; flora and fauna. Neruda transports you to the bird nests in the rainforest or along the Chilean coast. Listen to the shrieks of birds and dodge droppings as you read scores of odes devoted to different species: albatross; toucan; kestrel; seagull; cormorant; parakeet; gull; woodpecker; lapwing; mockingbird, and dodo bird. Likewise, Neruda loved rocks. He starts with an ode to the atom and proceeds to describe, in separate poems, the dozens of rocks and minerals unique to South America.\n\nThere is something dense, united, seated in the depths,\n\nRepeating its number, its identical sign.\n\nHow clear it is that the stones have touched time,\n\nIn their fine substance there is a smell of age\n\nAnd the water that the sea brings from salt and sleep.”(32)\n\n3) Politics\n\nNeruda was a fearless political poet who endured years of exile because he would not shut up. Some readers expressly dislike his political poems, but he casts his lot with the oppressed and for him, silence was complicity with the oppressors. I encourage conservative readers to be patient and try to understand why Neruda was outraged at imperialism and colonialism-- at “the blood thirsty flies” who plundered Latin America's natural resources, exterminated indigenous culture, and supported kleptocratic capitalist dictators.\n\nAdmittedly, I cringe when I see his handful of naive odes celebrating Stalin, Mao, and Castro—each of whom he later renounced when he learned of their butchery. But on the whole, I think his political poems are another form of the love poetry-but, instead of erotic love for a woman, he proclaims love for the people and for social justice:\n\nLet it be known that nobody crossed my path without sharing my being.\n\nI plunged up to the neck in adversities that were not mine,\n\nInto all the sufferings of others. (680)\n\nAh great love, small beloved!\n\nI did not stop in the struggle.\n\nI did not stop marching toward life,\n\nToward peace, toward bread for all.\n\nFor my life, give me\n\nAll lives,\n\nGive me all the sorrow\n\nOf all the world\n\nAnd I will transform it\n\nInto hope. (364)\n\nHe was a prophets of justice like Neruda-- artists who venture outside self-absorption to take on the burdens of others and who risk disdain by proclaiming affiliations that will immediately alienate many readers. THey are political love poems to the people whom he saw as oppressed.\n\n4) Personal\n\nNeruda’s father was a provincial rail worker, and his mother died a few months after his birth. I see him as the Hispanic Walt Whitman. “I begin by evoking Whitman,” Neruda declares :\n\nBecause I love my country\n\nI claim you, essential brother,\n\nold Walt Whitman with your old gray hands. (825)\n\nI touched a hand that day,\n\nand it was Walt Whitman’s hand.\n\nThroughout my entire childhood,\n\nmy companion was that hand with dew on it.\n\nAnd Walt did not disdain\n\nAll the gifts of the earth\n\nbut raised my eyes\n\nto the treasure we find\n\nInside a kernel of wheat. (425)\n\nNeruda’s poems, like Whitman’s, are often catalogs of the various places he lived, the people he met, the flora and fauna that intrigued him, and the martyrs and poets who made him weep.\n\nThis Collection\n\nPresented here are 600 poems, approximately a quarter of what Neruda wrote and which are ordered chronologically and organized by collection. The editor sprinkled in some untranslated Spanish poems; and occasionally gives alternate English translations of the same poem, which may surprise you at the tremendous difference a translator makes. Sometimes a poem that meant little to me in one translation leapt to life in another. I can honestly say, I loved nearly every single poem in this collection. I highlighted something on almost every page, and I place this book on my altar bookcase, so that I may continually re-read Neruda with Whitman, Shakespeare and Montaigne for the rest of my life.\n\nMy Conclusion\n\nThis is my first review of poetry. A poet communicates experience in condensed and concentrated language. Neruda sings of multiplicity and of common things. In the words of the editor, Neruda “works from the bottom up.”\n\nI kneel with Neruda in the search for epiphany. I stand with him in rebellion against abstract, abstruse, evasive poetry. Irony and experimentalism have their place in poetry, but I prefer my poets-- passionate, simple, understandable, and honest. In Neruda’s heart there were furies and sorrows that he unleashes. He speaks for us that we might better speak for ourselves."
