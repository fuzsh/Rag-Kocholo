On December 10, 1945, the Vicu√±a-born poet and educator became the first Latin American to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature from the Swedish Academy of Language.

In 1901, the Swedish Academy of Language began the tradition of awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature. Since then, only six Latin American writers have received this prestigious award. And of that select number, two are Chilean: Gabriela Mistral and Pablo Neruda.

On December 10, 1945, the poet Gabriela Mistral became the first Latin American to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature. She is also one of only 17 women who have been awarded this prize, while 98 have been awarded to men.

It took 26 years for the Nobel Prize in Literature to return to the hands of a Chilean. In 1971, the poet Pablo Neruda received the highest award in the literary world.

The poetry of Gabriela Mistral and Pablo Neruda has traveled the planet, has been translated into multiple languages and reached an audience of thousands of people. For this reason, in Imagen de Chile we launched this year the campaign "Chile, creativity that inspires the world", where we seek to promote the cultural heritage of Chile through the works of recognized talents from the world of culture and the arts.

Three professional tattoo artists from Spain created a design inspired by the works of Gabriela Mistral, Pablo Neruda and Nicanor Parra, which they printed on the skin of three young Spaniards. In this way, geographical and generational borders were crossed, bringing these talents of Chilean literature to the new generations in Spain.
