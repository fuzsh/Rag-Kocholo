Every so often you stumble upon an album you can tell the band had a lot of fun writing and recording it. The Deluxtone Rockets self-titled debut is one such album. Only around for a few years, this Tooth & Nail alumni has been defunct since 2001 (though in 2008 there was rumored to be some new material) and sadly never received much exposure. The sound here is a fusion of swing revival (think The W's) with some rockabilly, which is accomplished with big band drums, ska guitars, blaring horns, and a groovy bass. It takes all of fifteen seconds into "Tijuana Jumping Bean" to get your feet tapping and your head bobbing along to this record. John Brown's gruff vocals may be an acquired taste for some, but the energy and passion he displays--as well as his versatility in switching between his normal and rockabilly style of vocals--is undeniable. "Rumble With The Devil" became the band's best known song, and for good reason--it's a catchy tune that makes it sound fun to fight off the devil and his schemes to get us to sin. Many songs here feel like organized jam sessions, especially "Green-Eyed Cat," which only adds to the lively nature of the album. Other highlights include "You Get Burned" which speaks on the dangers of sin and the opening track "Tijuana Jumping Bean" which sets the dancing tone for the album. Not every track is great, however, with "Be Bop A Go Go" sounding more like filler and "Kitten" closing out the record on a less memorable note. Does this release sound dated? Absolutely. But the playful tone and the solid production quality makes this easy to overlook. It may not be for everyone, but if you find this style of music to be your cup of tea, you will thoroughly enjoy it.
