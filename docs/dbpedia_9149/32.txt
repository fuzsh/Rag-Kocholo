Hey, the Stray Cats put out a new album a couple of years ago. It isn't Christian, but it is out there.

I might have to check out some of Denver's stuff as I am gaining an appreciation for the Brian Setzer Orchestra.

Some of the rockabilly samples in that previous thread don't really do it for me. They are just TOO country sounding for me. I think for me that rockabilly has to have a bit more grit and swagger. The Deluxetone Rockets have a definite punk vibe going on with theirs and get points for that swagger. The W's seem to have that same feel. Some of the others like The Found Cats and The Altar Billies just leave me feeling kind of flat.

I'm with you some alldat. I enjoy what I've heard of the Deluxtone Rockets. But sometimes I just want that slapback sound - and The Found Cats do that.

It's funny - I mentioned to someone the other day at work that I was getting to where I really enjoy rockabilly. They looked at me and said "Of course you do. It's the punk rock of the fifties." *mic drop*

Problem with Deluxetone Rockets is that they only have one album in that style. They changed their sound after that one. Unless I missed something else by them but that was the only one that was in that style. I don't think they are around anymore.

Ever heard of Southern Culture On The Skids? They kinda fit that style but they are not a Christian band. But they are interesting, I have one of their CD's that was sent to a radio station I worked at and I ended up keeping it because I liked the style when I was in the mood for it.

So if anyone likes the Pioneers samples in the other thread (I do!), i found some cool info on them.

They're the worship band for the Hot Rod Church for Sinners - http://www.hotrodchurch.com/

I think it's in Ohio but I'm not sure...

Anyway, if anyone is interested, they have a section for the Pioneers. You can buy CD's, listen to some songs and - get this - download three albums worth of mp3's!

Check out Denver and the Mile High Orchestra. They're the only band I can think of in that genre that's still around. If you don't mind defunct bands, I'd also recommend The W's.

I decided to take a chance and grab those albums by The W's.

I scored an old-skool Rockabilly double album from our local thrift store a while back... it's actually pretty cool.

Has some I recognize like The Everly Brothers, Rick Nelson, and Mickey Gilley. But most I've never heard of: The Collins Kids, Sid King and the Five Strings, Link Wray, Sleepy LaBeef, and others.

Some good songs on it, not totally my thing though... not sure if I'm gonna hang onto it. Might see what I can get from ebayers.

I am now an official fan of The W's!
