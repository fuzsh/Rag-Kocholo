Biography

The Deluxtone Rockets were a band from Muskegon, Michigan. They began as a punk band, but by the time of their signing to Tooth & Nail Records they had evolved into a swing revival outfit. Their first album, which was self titled, was produced by Gene Eugene and Dennis Danell. They wrote their own songs. Their musical style and lyrics were often compared to The W's, but John Brown's lead vocals were likened to The Mighty Mighty Bosstones' Dicky Barrett or The Reverend Horton Heat.
