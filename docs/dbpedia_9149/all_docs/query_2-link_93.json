        "text": "Story by Sarah Spohn\n\n388 performances by 197 bands at 122 shows in the same venue. It’s the Lansing Underground, in the basement of the Christ Lutheran Church in downtown Lansing. It’s a venue, full of stories from hundreds of locals during their formative years – and a story that is now forever commemorated.\n\nSaint Johns native Alex Delavan was so deeply impacted by the Lansing Underground, he decided to draft an entire book dedicated to these special shows, their DIY flyers, and the countless memories from that community.\n\nTo say Delavan spent a lot of time going to concerts at the Lansing Underground is an understatement. From 1996 to 2003, Lansing Underground featured metal, hardcore, punk, emo, rock and a few rap all-ages shows.\n\nAfter receiving a folder full of flyers from the Lansing Underground shows from Founder Richard Mittwede, Delavan knew he wanted a copy for himself. At first, he thought he’d post pictures of them onto Facebook, or maybe he’d save them as a PDF. No, he should print a tangible copy. Then he thought his friends would want them too. Lastly, he decided a book was the idea that made the most sense.\n\n84 days later, eight different test prints, and hundreds of revisions later, an entire book complete with flyers, captioned facts, tour info, and inside jokes was no longer an idea — but a finished product. After 150 hours of research, the music lover can now add historian, curator, archivist, and author to his resume.\n\nDuring his formative years, Delavan and hundreds of other teenagers spent their time at the Lansing Underground, a place Delavan said welcomed everyone.\n\n“These were the kids that didn’t feel like they fit in anywhere else,” he said. “We were the misfits of society — but here, we were all included because we were so used to being outcast. That’s what drew us together.”\n\nSometimes, Delavan would attend 2-3 shows per night, many of them before he could even drive. His parents would often wait in the parking lot for him.\n\nIt was where he wanted to be — and Lansing Underground Founder Richard Mittwede knew it. Every night before each of the 122 shows, Richard addressed the kids in the crowd. “You could have been anywhere tonight. You chose to be here. We appreciate that,” he said.\n\nRightfully so, that’s the same opening line of Delavan’s book, “Scene and Unseen: The Flyer Art of Lansing Underground.” The time capsule takes readers back to their youth, some even their first-ever show. Bands like P.O.D., Underoath, Living Sacrifice, Copeland, Grouplove, The Deluxtone Rockets, Johnny Respect, Still Remains, and Anathallo played on the venue’s tiny two-foot stage.\n\nIn November 2017, there was an official reunion, which the book release coincided with. Being back in that same space 14 years, 6 months, and 16 days after the final show was an emotional experience for ‘those outcast kids’ who grew up to be adults with responsibilities, kids, and mortgages.\n\n“I cannot tell you how many people came up to me that night, and said everything looks the same. It all feels so normal, and natural,” Delavan said.\n\nPeople traveled from all over the country to spend another night in a place that had shaped not only their youth, but their entire lives.\n\n“It was the book that gave us a reason to get back together,” he said. Delavan doesn’t care if he ever ‘breaks even’ with the book – he considers it a labor of love. “No one will ever see the 300 hours I put into it, but the response from the people that matter the most to me is really what’s important.”\n\nTo be able to relive those memories is worth it. In today’s world, Delavan said it’s more important than ever, to take a moment away from the media, and society, and remember a simpler time.\n\n“We’re constantly having us vs. them conversations, feeling the world is the weight on your shoulders. You have to worry about what’s trendy, what’s not, what’s the concern of the day, what’s the offensive thing of the day. This gives them a chance to just stop, think, and relive some of those days.”\n\nBut after the book release at the reunion show, the walk down memory lane didn’t stop there. Delavan also hosted pop-up booths selling his book at various festivals across the state, and even a flyer art show in Ohio. The long-lost art of flyers is quickly being replaced, due to the internet.\n\n“I love the art form,” he said. “It’s something that’s going away, because we have the internet; we have Facebook banners. You don’t have the legwork that used to be there — of going to shows because you found a flyer. Things are a lot more disposable now — figuratively, and literally.”\n\nDelavan’s next book, “Punk, The Way I Remember It: Flyer Art of Ripped Heart Productions,” is coming out May 4. History dates back to April 18, 1988 with this project, all the way through the last show to take place on May 2, 2019. After the release at the final show, a retail version will be on Amazon and other retailers."
