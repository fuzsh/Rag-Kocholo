Delivery for most orders is only $3.99.\n\n” Area selections include everything from fast food to bar food to home-style dinners. Never again will you have to settle,” says Hockman. “We’ll even deliver from multiple restaurants if your family is indecisive like mine.”\n\n“We have an extra large delivery area of up to 10 miles from each restaurant, much further than traditional pizza delivery,” he adds.\n\nAccording to Hockman, the new service uses state-of-the-art industry-leading technology to communicate with drivers and customers. Drivers are dispatched on deliveries via a smartphone app. They use insulated hotbags and coolers to keep orders fresh and GPS navigation to find addresses quickly and safely. Customers can even track their delivery progress right on their computer, tablet or phone after placing their order.\n\n“We are currently looking for more driver-partners that live in the area,” Hockman says. “This is a perfect second job for people that are underemployed or anyone who could use extra money. Drivers choose their own shifts based on their availability.” Anyone interested should email their contact information to\n\njhockm01@aol.com.\n\nRestaurant delivery has existed in larger cities for years.

The Mid-Michigan District Health Department, which serves Clinton, Gratiot and Montcalm counties, is reporting three confirmed cases of hepatitis A in its district—two in Clinton County and one in Gratiot County.\n\nHepatitis A is a serious and highly contagious liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus. It is often transmitted through the consumption of food or water contaminated with infected feces or by oral contact with contaminated objects.

Illness generally occurs two to six weeks after exposure to the hepatitis A virus. Symptoms of hepatitis A include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, fever, loss of appetite, fatigue, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes), dark urine, pale stool and diarrhea. Not everyone with hepatitis A will have symptoms, but most do.\n\nHepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable illness, and while the vaccine is recommended as a part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule, most adults have not been vaccinated. That is why it’s so important for those at-risk of contracting the disease to get vaccinated right away.\n\nIn addition to getting vaccinated, people can help protect themselves by washing their hands with soap and warm water after using the bathroom or changing diapers and before eating and preparing food.\n\nThis outbreak has had a high hospitalization rate. According to Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, of the 736 cases reported since August 2016, a total of 596 have been hospitalized. A total of 24 deaths have been reported.\n\nPeople who believe they may have been exposed to hepatitis A or who have symptoms should contact their doctor immediately. Those who would like to be vaccinated should contact their doctor or the Mid-Michigan District Health Department at 989-224-2195 in Clinton County, 989-875-3681 in Gratiot County or 989-831-5237 in Montcalm County.\n\nAll local health departments involved in the outbreak are receiving financial assistance from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to help combat the disease. The Mid-Michigan District Health Department will use the funds to conduct extra immunization clinics to try to reach those at high risk for the disease.\n\nIf your organization is interested in hosting a vaccination clinic, contact the health department at 989-227-3109. Please visit www.mi.gov/hepatitisAoutbreak for additional information. To see an up-to-date vaccination clinic schedule, visit Mid-Michigan District Health Department’s website at www.mmdhd.org.\n\nIt’s K of C Fish Fry time again\n\nBeginning on Friday, February 16, the Knights of Columbus will be hosting their traditional Fish Fries at their hall located at 1108 N.

The book also has garnered great reviews from Publisher’s Weekly, The School Library Journal and Booklist.\n\nMidnight Teacher is the little-known true story of an enslaved woman who for many years ran a secret school in Mississippi in the mid 1800s. She conducted her school in a hidden cabin from midnight until two in the morning. Both she and her students risked being whipped since it was illegal to teach the enslaved to read and write.\n\nKirkus Reviews called the book “An excellent homage to an African-American woman who taught ahead of her time.”\n\nThe picture book, illustrated by London Ladd, will be released February 13 from Lee & Low Books. Halfmann has written more than forty books for children. She writes about nature, animals, and little-known people of achievement.\n\nHalfmann’s signed books are available locally at Becker’s Furniture on Main Street in Fowler and the Clinton County Art Gallery in downtown St. Johns. Her new book will be available in these locations near the end of February. Her books also are available at online booksellers and can be ordered through local bookstores.\n\nHalfmann grew up on a farm in the Fowler/St. Johns area and graduated from Michigan State University.

She has these words of advice for new Nurses: “Have a good heart, show great compassion, and let your Patients know you are here to help them through a difficult time in their lives.”\n\nSimon, who continued to wear her Nursing cap at work, has been instrumental in celebrating Daisy awardees by creating beautiful, hand-painted cards for each recipient. Simon recently retired from Nursing to pursue her art “hobby” as a second career. So, fellow Nurses created a special card based on her designs and had it framed for her.\n\nNurse nominees Karen McCloskey, RN; Adriann Sanders, RN; Chibwe Powell, RN; Mary Rathbun, RN; Kara George, RN; Teresa Miller, RN; Sarah Veith, RN; Regina Buhr, RN; and Amber Piper, RN, also were recognized. Each received a DAISY pin and flowers.\n\nCRV visits MSU Cyclotron\n\nCommunity Resource Volunteers traveled to MSU to visit the MSU Cyclotron on January 14.\n\nThe students participated in hands-on activities with a model “nucleus” that they were able to accelerate and smash to make isotopes that do not exist on Earth, but might be made in stars. The students also were able to try several demonstrations that simulated the research done in MSU’s National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory and explore MSU Cyclotron’s world-class rare isotope laboratory where nuclei are smashed into a target at half the speed of light. The also tour included demonstrations, an introduction to the goals and methods of nuclear science, and a walk behind the scenes where nuclei are accelerated, filtered and/or studied.\n\nThe Cyclotron trip experience continues on Saturday, January 27th. Zack Contan will visit to explore what we know about the nucleus factories called “stars” through a series of hands-on activities and games. The event will be at the CRV office, located at 304 Brush St. St. Johns from 1-4 pm. The cost is $5 per student and is limited to 30 students.

People are talking about it and doctor’s offices are filling up with patients complaining about it. The “it” is the flu and it’s spreading rapidly across the country, including here at home.\n\nWe all know that the flu can cause high fever, chills, headache, extreme tiredness, dry cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose and muscle aches. And we know it can make you quite miserable and put you out of commission for up to a week. But this year’s flu virus seems especially aggressive, which is why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Mid-Michigan District Health Department (MMDHD) are urging everyone over six months of age to get vaccinated.\n\nVaccination is especially important for those at high-risk for developing serious flu complications. Those most at-risk include young children, pregnant women, people with chronic health conditions like asthma, diabetes or heart and lung disease and people 65 years and older.\n\nWhile the flu vaccine isn’t 100% effective, it remains our best defense. And when you get vaccinated, you are not just protecting yourself, but these high-risk groups as well.\n\nSome people think it’s too late to get vaccinated, but that’s not the case. The vaccine is effective throughout the entire flu season, which can last as late as May. But it does take up to two weeks for the body to build up defenses against the virus after being vaccinated, so it’s best not to wait.\n\nSome people think they’ll get the flu if they get vaccinated. This is also not true. While some people do experience nasal congestion and a runny nose after getting vaccinated, the symptoms are mild and go away quickly.\n\nGetting the flu vaccine has never been more convenient. The vaccine is available at a variety of places, including your doctor’s office, many pharmacies, or the health department.\n\nMid-Michigan District Health Department offers the standard flu shot, the high-dose flu shot for those 65 and older, and preservative-free options. The health department participates with the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. It can also can bill many types of insurance, including Medicare Part B, which will cover the entire cost for seniors.\n\nTo schedule an appointment at the health department, or to find out if we participate with your insurance, call 989-224-2195 in Clinton County, 989-875-3681 in Gratiot County and 989-831-5237 in Montcalm County.\n\nIn addition to getting vaccinated, there are many other ways you can protect yourself and your family from getting sick. First, wash your hands often with soap and water or use hand sanitizer. Make sure to clean common surfaces and objects often that may be contaminated with germs. You should also try to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. If you know someone who is sick, avoid close contact with them. If you are sick, cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, and be sure to stay home so you don’t infect others.\n\nIf you do get the flu, call your doctor if your symptoms get worse or if you have shortness of breath or worsening cough or congestion.\n\nChocolate Fantasy is February 1\n\nAre you in search of an interesting Valentine’s gift? Tickets are now on sale for the sweetest night in town.\n\nThe Clinton County Senior Center is hosting a Chocolate fantasy on February 1st from 6 – 8 p.m. Plan to experience more than 25 chocolate items from your community.\n\nTickets are $10.00 each and benefit the Senior Center.

However, at CRV, they do not look at volunteers as just what they can do for them, but what the organization can do for the volunteers.\n\nJust like the participants they serve, CRV looks at volunteers as participants also. This means that volunteers are not just put in a position and they server. CRV is striving to provide volunteers opportunities to share and grow. It does not matter whether the volunteer wants to use their career knowledge to share, explore a hobby area, or learn a new one, CRV works with everyone to help find a place for them and help them grow.\n\nIt does not stop there. As volunteers, they are encouraged to look at opportunities and positions to see if they might have an interest, and then try it out. Volunteers are actually encouraged to try different areas. If a volunteer thinks they might be interested in say a science area, they can work on a project or program. If they like it, they can continue, or stop and try something else. No questions asked.\n\nThis flexibility and focus on volunteer needs continues even to the hours and times they work. At CRV, they want the volunteers to choose everything. CRV uses an online portal system for volunteers use to see what opportunities are available. They decide if they are interested in helping. By filling out their personal profile, they can choose areas of interest, number of hour per day, week and month they are willing to volunteer. From this information, their system and project leaders can help match volunteers to opportunities. However, the volunteer decides if they want to participate.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about what CRV does and how you might help them out, please contact them by calling (517) 672-4226, stopping by the office at 304 N. Brush Street, or email the coordinator at volcoordinator@crvonline.org.\n\nTouch a Truck coming up in May\n\nMark your calendar.

The program runs 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and admission is free for the day.\n\nVisitors will have an opportunity to observe and participate in historic craft and trade demonstrations including butter making.\n\nStatehood Day commemorates the events of January 26, 1837, when, more than a year after Michigan adopted its first constitution and elected its first governor, President Andrew Jackson signed the bill making Michigan the nation’s 26th state. The delay was caused by a disagreement and subsequent “war” with Ohio over the port town Toledo. The resulting compromise gave Toledo to Ohio, and Michigan the western two-thirds of the Upper Peninsula. By the mid-19th century, the discovery of copper and iron in the Upper Peninsula more than made up for the loss of Toledo.\n\nLearn more at www.michigan.gov/mhc."
