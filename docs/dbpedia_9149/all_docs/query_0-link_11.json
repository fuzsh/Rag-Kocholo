        "text": "The temperature's rising. It's not just the mercury we're talking here, but the live music and event scene — things in summer 2000 look to be as hot as they've ever been, from dinosaurs to dramatics, Sting to Santana, Kids Fest to Riverfest.\n\nTo help you plan each and every day, we've picked a Hot Ticket for every date of the Summer of Double Oh. We've also nominated a Hot Spot for each day, which are typically free or near free (hence, no ticket).\n\nRather than taking up the space to repeat the address and phone number for Riverbend and the other venues, we've included vital data for each in the accompanying list of \"Major Summer Venues & Attractions\".\n\nThursday, June 1\n\nHot Ticket: Coney Island amusement park begins yet another summer, but with a new (well, not so much new as a comeback of sorts) attraction, the Dodgem bumper car ride.\n\nHot Spot: Before the summer gets too hot, plan a trip up to the Carew Tower Observation Deck. Downtown's tallest skyscraper includes a panoramic viewing perch, so take along a pair of binoculars and see if you can spot workers erecting the fiberglas pigs that are part of the Big Pig Gig.\n\nFriday, June 2\n\nHot Ticket: Just about your last chance to catch the Playhouse in the Park's Spunk, three tales by Harlem Renaissance author Zora Neale Hurston. It closes Sunday night.\n\nHot Spot: Summerbration dominates the action this weekend in Blue Ash, with free shows by Sister Sledge, Air Supply and Rick Springfield.\n\nWant to take a drive? What's billed as Southwest Ohio's largest food festival, Troy's Strawberry Festival, attracts 200,000 people annually.\n\nSaturday, June 3\n\nHot Ticket: The art's always the thing at Summerfair, the cultural extravaganza that imports hundreds of fine artists, artisans and craftmakers from around the country to Coney Island each year. Art works on sale at this weekend's 33rd annual edition range from ceramics and jewelry to photography and painting. Beyond art, there are food booths as well as strolling entertainers. Kenny G appears next door at Riverbend Music Center, so if you choose to stroll the art booths in the evening, you'll be treated to mellow music in the air.\n\nHot Spot: The WGRR Oldiesfest stars Dion, Davy Jones of The Monkees, Gary Puckett of Union Gap, Lou Christie, The Chiffons, Gene Hughes and the Casinos. It all happens at the Butler County Fairgrounds in Hamilton. (Call WGRR for free ticket pickup locations or pay $5 at the door.)\n\nSunday, June 4\n\nHot Ticket: \"Dinosaurs! A Prehistoric Journey\" takes kids on an interactive Dinamation odyssey, as 13 dinosaurs visit Paramount's Kings Island's Nickelodeon SplatCity, all housed inside a giant 7,000-square-foot tent.\n\nHot Spot: This weekend features one of the nation's largest free festivals for children, Bigg's Kids Fest, at Sawyer Point on the riverfront.\n\nMonday, June 5\n\nHot Ticket: The Reds host one of the American League's big surprises so far in 2000, the Chicago White Sox. See the Big Hurt, Frank Thomas, try to reach the red seats. Taunt the southsiders with shouts of, \"Yeah, our new stadium design sucks, but at least it's better than Comiskey Field!\"\n\nHot Spot: The Public Library Used Book Sale begins on Fountain Square and continues through Friday.\n\nTuesday, June 6\n\nHot Ticket: Carol Burnett speaks at the Aronoff Center for the Arts Downtown.\n\nHot Spot: Ready to Rumba? Restaurateur Jeff Ruby's newest endeavor is this retro nightclub in Covington, with a bamboo dance floor, zebra-striped barstools and lots of leopard skin. The bar is topped off with a sheet of ice, so when you set your drink down, it cools off.\n\nWednesday, June 7\n\nHot Ticket: Want to meet one truly nasty S.O.B.? Son of Beast, Paramount's Kings Island's newest rollercoaster, should be at the top of your list for summer fun. At 218 feet, the ride sets four world records: Tallest wooden roller coaster on the planet, the world's only looping wooden coaster, tallest wooden coaster drop (214 feet) and fastest wooden coaster (78 mph). Add the world record for number of barf bags handed out on a single ride, and S.O.B. easily sails into the Guinness books.\n\nHot Spot: WGUC's Fountain Square Concert Series presents the Westwood Woodwind Quintet. LaRosa's Party in the Park at Yeatman's Cove features Fool Proof.\n\nThursday, June 8\n\nHot Ticket: Riverbend Music Center hosts Country legends Charlie Daniels and Hank Williams Jr.\n\nHot Spot: The Newport Italian Festival begins at the Newport Shopping Center. Jazz on the Square features the Sound Body Jazz Orchestra.\n\nFriday, June 9\n\nHot Ticket: The Cincinnati Shakespeare Festival concludes its season this weekend with Coriolanus.

Tomorrow is the last chance to see, for free, Ansel Adams: A Legacy, an exhibit of 116 photographs of national parks, vistas and documentary images at the Cincinnati Art Museum.

Then watch them disinfect after falling in several times.\n\nTuesday, June 13\n\nHot Ticket: The brand-new \"Vanishing Giants\" elephant and giraffe exhibit livens up a visit to the Cincinnati Zoo this summer. The state-of-the-art facility features a new elephant performance area with shaded seating for 420 visitors. The 3.5-acre complex also includes a 38,000-gallon pool for the big guys, lots of roaming space, a 9,000-square-foot giraffe habitat and lots of viewing opportunities across hidden moats. While you're at the zoo, be sure to check out another brand-new animal exhibit, the \"Wonders From Down Under\" Australian habitat featuring koalas, kookaburras and walking sticks.\n\nHot Spot: Ever see those signs for the Queen City Tour?

The Beach Boys play Kettering's Fraze Pavilion.\n\nHot Spot: If Paramount's Kings Island seems particularly crazy or open at all odd hours this weekend, it's because American Coaster Enthusiasts are holding their national convention here.
