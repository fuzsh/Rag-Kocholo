I do this instead.\n\nThese are unchanged from when they were written, although a few are noticeably different (or not) from when they were originally published, a result of my disagreeing with editorial license (which was usually more an issue of available space than anything else). If you've got a serious problem with it, you've probably read The Rice Thresher a lot more closely than I ever did. In any event, I've only cleaned up obvious typos, leaving things like misinformation, hasty and/or dumb pronouncements, poor analogical judgement and just plain boneheadedness in plain sight for everybody to see in perpetuity. I've also left well enough alone, with one minor stylistic explanation and one major exception which I really needed to explain and apologize for. I'll leave it for you to ferret them out.\n\nAnd yes, I occasionally recycle myself when I recap for the year-end stuff. So don't bother telling me.\n\nAlso check out:\n\nMid-1995 CD Roundup\n\nTen Great Albums You've Never Heard\n\nTop Five Guilty Pleasure Songs\n\n...not to mention this guy , who would like to offer a well-taken rebuttal.\n\nA\n\na-ha - Scoundrel Days (1986)\n\nAlastor - Javelin Catcher (1998)\n\nAK-MOMO - Return To N.Y.

They've been getting increasingly involved as the years go on and I find myself more and more opinionated.\n\nA note about missing years: if you've made it this far, you'll see that there's nothing before 1992 and 1994 and 1995 have gone missing. The fact is, I didn't start this nonsense until 1991, but that list is lost to the mists of USENET, as I was young and foolish enough not to make my own copy (my pick for top album that year was Julian Cope's Peggy Suicide ). My 1995 list was, similarly, emailed to one person and one person only, and if he still has it, he ain't talking (best album: Evil Stig's Evil Stig ). 1994 is more complicated but can be boiled down, essentially, to my being out of the country (the U.S., that is) and therefore I: a) wasn't really in the same musical universe as everybody else and b) not really paying attention to my obsessive listing at the time. So get over it.\n\n2007 Retrospectrometer\n\n2006 Retrospectacular\n\n2005 Retrospectrola\n\n2004 Retrospectravision\n\n2003 Retrospeculator\n\n2002 Retrospectrum\n\n2001 Retrospectacle\n\n2000 Retrospectator\n\n1999 Retrospectual\n\n1998 Retrospectionary\n\n1997 Restrospecticon\n\n1996 Retrospecticus\n\n1993 Best\n\n1992 Best"
