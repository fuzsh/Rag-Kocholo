        "text": "The Deluxtone Rockets\n\nDemo\n\n1998 (no label)\n\nMuskegon, Michigan, USA\n\nJohn Brown – Lead Vocals, Guitar\n\nChad Harjer – Rhythm guitar\n\nJimmy Van Boxel – Upright Bass, BGV’s\n\nJason Sorn – Drums\n\nJoel Montavani – Sax\n\nTim Harvell “Timmy Tahoe” – Trumpet, BGV’s\n\nSide 1:\n\nGod’s Cadillac\n\nTijuana Jumpin Bean\n\nLong Road Home\n\nSide 2:\n\nIn Your World\n\nBe Bop a Go Go\n\nMexican Stratocaster\n\nThis is another demo that was uploaded to YouTube. The Deluxetone Rockets signed to Tooth & Nail Records and released their label debut in 1999. At some point before this demo they are said to have been a punk band, as well as going under the name of Between Thieves at some point (not to be confused by the Texas band formerly known as Judah that signed to Tattoo Records). But at the time of this demo they were fully into their swing revival / rockabilly sound. All of the songs here were re-recorded on their self-titled debut except for “In Your World” and “Mexican Stratocaster.” The embed of the playlist is below, but be warned it is pretty distorted."
