        "text": "American band\n\nMusical artist\n\nThe Deluxtone Rockets is an American band from Muskegon, Michigan.[4] It began as a punk band, but by the time of signing to Tooth & Nail Records it had evolved into a swing revival outfit.[3]\n\nTheir first album, which was self-titled, was produced by Gene Eugene and Dennis Danell of Social Distortion. They wrote their own songs, and their musical style and lyrics were often compared to The W's,[5] but John Brown's lead vocals were likened to The Mighty Mighty Bosstones' Dicky Barrett or The Reverend Horton Heat.[4]\n\nIn their second album, Green Room Blues, the group dropped the horn section entirely and shifted to a rockabilly sound. The album's title reflects the fact that both Eugene and Danell died in early 2000, during production of the album.[4] Though Danell had not been involved in the production, Eugene had been, and was replaced by Chris Colbert. The album has a darker mood than their debut effort, though its lyrics still reflect the faith of John Brown.[6] The album also contained a cover of The Cure's \"Lovesong\".\n\n2000 was generally reported as a bad year for the band; they were unable to play shows regularly because in addition to recording difficulties, their drummer left, after wanting to move to a different style musically. They were able to get Rodney from the Calicoes to fill in occasionally, and thus played at Cornerstone and other festivals.[7] Also, one night their van caught fire and was totaled, though they still managed to play that night.[7]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\n1999 The Deluxtone Rockets\n\n1999 Happy Christmas Volume 2 (Compilation, BEC)\n\n2001 Green Room Blues\n\n2009 New Material Demo\n\nBand members\n\n[edit]\n\n1999\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn Brown - Lead Vocals, Guitar\n\nJimmy Van Boxel - Upright Bass, BGV's\n\nJacob Dykema - Tenor Sax, Vocals\n\nRichard Mittwede - Trombone, BGV's\n\nJason Sorn - Drums\n\nTim Harvell - Trumpet, BGV's\n\n2001\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn Brown\n\nJimmy Van Boxel\n\nLonnie Pease - guitar\n\nJason Feltman\n\n2008\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn Brown - Lead Vocals, Guitar\n\nJason Sorn - Drums\n\nHarley Obzut - Bass\n\nDusty Bottoms - Guitar\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
