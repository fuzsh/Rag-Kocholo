        "text": "I am due with our second baby girl in a month and we still don’t have a middle name picked out. Our first daughter is named Bexley Grace. We chose Bexley from a list of British surnames we saw. I like British, preppy sounding names that are not common but still sound like a name. We have chosen the name Palmer for this baby girl. Because we choose uncommon first names I think I’d like to stick with common middle names but not set on that. Names we have considered are Palmer Kate, Palmer Joy, and Palmer Faith. I don’t love any of those. Joy and Faith are only there bc our first daughters middle name is Grace. Other first names we love and considered were Emerson and Sloan. Sloan is too popular and my husband changed his mind on Emerson so that was a no go (still my number one choice though). But it doesn’t flow with Palmer as a middle name I don’t think. I also love the name Elle but our last name is Ellis so that’s a no go. I also love names like Isabella and Sophia but they don’t really fit with what we’ve got going so far I don’t think. Emma is another favorite. We also considered Hadley for our first daughter but don’t love that one this time.\n\nI think it needs to either be 1 or 3 syllables in order to flow well.\n\nMy name is Ashley and my husbands name is John. I don’t care if the names flow with ours though. Any ideas on a good middle name for Palmer???\n\nThanks!"
