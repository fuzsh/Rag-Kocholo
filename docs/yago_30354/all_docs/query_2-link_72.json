        "text": "Born. To Donald O’Connor, 32, cinema song-and-dance man (Call Me Madam), and sometime TV Starlet Gloria Noble O’Connor, 24: a daughter, their first child (his second); in Santa Monica, Calif. Name: Alicia. Weight: 7 Ibs. 10 oz.\n\nMarried. Lilli Palmer, 43, German-born actress of stage (Bell, Book & Candle) and screen (Body and Soul, Notorious Gentleman); and Carlos Thompson, 34, Argentine-bred cinemactor (Flame and the Flesh); she for the second time (her first: Actor Rex Harrison), he for the first; in Küsnacht, Switzerland.\n\nDied. Merrill Moore, 54, psychiatrist, neurologist, longtime Harvard Medical School teacher (1930-42), compulsive “champion sonneteer” (he reputedly wrote some 100,000), whose published works (Verse Diary of a Psychiatrist, Illegitimate Sonnets, The Dance of Death) “don’t represent one percent of my output”; of cancer; in Squantum, Mass.\n\nDied. Bertha Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, 71, granddaughter of Munitions King Alfred (“Alfred the Great”) Krupp, and herself fourth-generation ruler of the Krupp empire, mother of the current (since 1943) Steel Kingpin Alfried Krupp (TIME, Aug. 19), who gave her name to the famed Big Bertha, the 42-centimeter mortar that smashed World War I forts and cleared the way for the German advance into Belgium and France; of a heart ailment; in Essen, Germany.\n\nDied. Soemu Toyoda, 72, fat, chauvinistic wartime Japanese admiral, chief of the Naval General Staff when Japan surrendered, onetime (1943) commandant of Japan’s Yokosuka naval base; of a heart attack; in Tokyo.\n\nDied. Montague H. Roberts, 74, mechanical engineer, pioneer automobile buff, who taught Franklin D. Roosevelt how to drive; in Newark, N.J. On Feb. 12, 1908, while thousands of waving spectators roared hoarsely, Roberts climbed into a Thomas Flyer, yanked down his goggles and dusted out of Times Square, pitted against five other massive autos in the first New York-to-Paris-via-the-West auto race. Surviving mud burials in Iowa, sandstorms in Montana, Roberts left his car mates in San Francisco, and they brought the battered Thomas—”the best car in the world in 1908″—into Paris on July 30, 26 days ahead of its nearest competitor (three of the six made the finish).\n\nDied. Oliver St. John Gogarty, 79, irreverent, witty Irish literateur, the “stately, plump Buck Mulligan” of James Joyce’s Ulysses, proclaimed (by Irish critics and himself) the world’s greatest conversationalist, playwright (The Enchanted Trousers), poet (Wild Apples, Selected Poems), author (as I Was Going Down Sackville Street, Going Native), surgeon (eye, ear, nose, throat), sometime athlete (bicycle sprints), who was dubbed by William Butler Yeats “one of the great lyric poets of our age”; in Manhattan. A onetime senator of the Irish Free State (1922-36), he loved to badger Republicans (“Whenever De Valera contradicts himself, he’s right”). Characterizing an Irishman as one “who believes best what he knows to be untrue,” Gogarty often colored his tall tales with even taller reminiscences.\n\nDied. Christian Frederik Carl George Valdemar Axel, King Haakon VII, 85, Norway’s only ruler since the country became independent in 1905, and the world’s oldest reigning monarch; of a respiratory ailment; in Oslo (see FOREIGN NEWS).\n\nDied. Jean Sibelius, 91, world-famed Finnish composer; of a cerebral hemorrhage; near Helsinki (see Music).\n\nDied. Ch’ih Pai-shih, 97, China’s best-known contemporary painter, who took up art as a hobby while working as a carpenter, gained worldwide fame in the ’20s, sold his work on commission and by the square foot (price range: 50¢-$2), and often signed his paintings with odd names: The Old Vagabond, The Disciple of Lu Pan (god of carpenters), The Old Man of the Apricot Orchard; in Peking. Living with 30 relatives (he supported about 50) in a rambling house, Ch’ih painted chicks, crickets, shrimp and crabs, occasionally a landscape (“Only the rich have known landscapes, but every ricksha boy knows a shrimp or a crab”) in the Sung Dynasty tradition."
