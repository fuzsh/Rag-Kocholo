        "text": "Portavogie Harbor before 1940 Palmer's houses on Springfield Road, Portavogie\n\nPalmer is a very common surname in the Ards peninsula of County Down, though not so common elsewhere in Northern Ireland. There is a particularly heavy concentration in the seaport town of Portavogie near the southern end of the peninsula. Our ancestor, Eliza Palmer, belonged to this extended family which we have been able to describe below thanks to the research of Lindsay Young of Troon, Scotland, and Lena McVea of Portavogie. Eliza is included at the appropriate point in the extensive genealogy given below.\n\nOne family legend tells that the first Palmers, two brothers, came from Reading, England, with Cromwell's army. One was given land at the spa in Ballynahinch and the other land in Portavogie. Another legend has it that the first Palmer ancestor in County Down came from England in the year of the ``reformation'', probably the year of the restoration, 1660, when nonconformists would have been inclined to leave England. It is also said that this first Palmer in Ulster married a woman by the name of Kidd. The earliest gravestone record is on a headstone in the old Ballyhalbert graveyard that reads: ``Palmer. Here lyeth the body of Adam Palmer late of Portavogie who died July 8, 1754, age 92yrs also wife Jean McCredey died Nov.26, 1737, age 61. Here lies the body of John Palmer late of Baellyessborough died Mar. 22, 1798 age 51 also wife Bell Palmer died Nov.2, 1826, age 65.'' Adam Palmer was therefore born in 1662 and his wife Jean in 1676. It seems possible that Adam and Jean were the parents of our first known ancestor, James Palmer who is also buried in Ballyhalbert graveyard. Another gravestone reads: ``Palmer. John Palmer died Jul.4, 1764, age 52 also Robert Palmer son of James Palmer died Jul.4, 1764, age 10.'' It may be that this John Palmer, born in 1712, was another son of Adam and Jean.\n\nThis chapter tells the story of our Palmer ancestors, beginning with the earliest known, James Palmer (1707-1758) and proceeding through his son, James Palmer (1737-1807), through his son James Palmer (1775-1807), through his son John Palmer (1793-1850), through his son James Palmer (18??-18??) to Eliza Palmer (1842-1904) who married Robert Gibson ( -1906):\n\nJames Palmer of Portavogie was born about 1707. He married Ann Bingham born about 1718. He died on Jul.26, 1758, she on Apr.8, 1798, and both are buried in Ballyhalbert old graveyard. Their children:\n\nJames Palmer was born about 1737 in Ballynahinch and moved to Portavogie. He first married a woman named Miller and she is reputed to have had a son, John Palmer. This first wife died young and James married her sister, Mary Miller, born about 1750. This second marriage produced two children, James and Bernette Palmer, also listed below. Mary died on Oct.23, 1796 and James on May 7, 1807; both are buried in Ballyhalbert graveyard where their gravestone reads: ``PALMER. Here lieth the body of Mary Palmer alias Miller, wife to James Palmer of Portavogie who departed this life Oct.23, 1796, aged 46 years. Also James Palmer, he died the 7th May 1807 aged 70 years. Also his son James Palmer of Portavogie who died the 13th of May 1857 aged 82 years. Also his grandson James Palmer of Portavogie who died the 25th of July 1857 aged 58 years. Also Sarah Palmer, wife of the last said James Palmer, who died the 21st of January 1867 aged 68 years.'' The children of James (1737) are listed later.\n\nAdam Palmer born about 1740. He died on Mar.26, 1812, and is buried in Ballyhalbert graveyard.\n\nMary Palmer born about 1746. She died on Jun.12, 1809, and is buried in Ballyhalbert graveyard.\n\nRobert Palmer born about 1754. He died on Jul.4, 1764, and is buried in Ballyhalbert graveyard.\n\nCHILDREN OF JAMES PALMER (1737):\n\nBernette Palmer was the daughter of James Palmer (1737) and his second wife, Mary Miller.\n\nJames Palmer (1775) of Portavogie, the son of James (1737) and his second wife, was born about 1775. On Mar.17, 1818 in Greyabbey, James registered a freehold in Portavogie worth more than 40 shillings. The landlord was David Boyd and the tenure given as the lives of the Prince of Wales, the Duke of York and James Palmer. James died on May 13, 1857, at the age of 82 as the earlier quoted gravestone inscription attests.\n\nCHILDREN OF JAMES PALMER (1775):\n\nJohn Palmer (1793), known as Jack, was born about 1793. He married a woman from the Isle of Man called Nancy Campbell (or Camel), reputedly the sister of a poet. When his father died, John inherited half of the Portavogie farm, the other half going to his brother, James. John died on Nov.10, 1850, aged 57 and Nancy on Apr.10, 1871, aged 64. They are buried in Glastry Presbyterian Graveyard where their gravestone reads: \"PALMER. Erected by Nancy Palmer in memory of her husband John Palmer of Portavogie who departed this life 10th November 1850 aged 57 years. Also the above named Nancy Palmer who departed this life on the 10th April 1871 aged 64 years. Also her grandson James Palmer, died 1st Feb. 1869 aged 5 years. Her son Adam Palmer died 27th Oct. 1905 aged 72 years\". As this attests John died on Nov.10, 1850, and Nancy on Apr.10, 1871. John and Nancy's children:\n\nJames Palmer of Ballymullen married Mary Jane McWatters in Kircubbin Presbyterian Church on May 4, 1839. James had been trained for a life at sea but became a farmer. He is remembered as the finder of a baby by the side of the road at Rubane on the way to Glastry church. James took the child home, named him Laughlin McVea after a character in a novel he was reading and raised the boy as his own son. His three children:\n\nJohn Palmer of Ballyfrench was born about 1843. He married three times. First, on Jan.9, 1877, in Ballyhalbert Parish Church he married Agnes (Nancy) Piper born about 1844. They had two sons James and Samuel (below). Agnes died on Nov.18, 1886, as the following gravestone in Balleasborough graveyard attests: ``PALMER. Erected by John Palmer of Ballyfrench for wife Agnes died Nov.18, 1886, age 42. Also his wife Mary Jane died May 1, 1889, age 38. Also son John died Oct.1, 1894, age 2. Also said John died in USA 1910 age 67. Also son Robert died Oct.12, 1917. Also Margaret wife of above John Palmer died Feb.24, 1929, age 73.'' John then married Agnes' sister, Mary Jane Piper. As the above gravestone states, Mary Jane died on May 1, 1889, age 38. John's third wife was a widow, Margaret Bickett (born about 1858, maiden name Porter). She and John had three or more children listed below. In the registration of his eldest son, John is listed as a farmer in Ballygrainey, Greyabbey; in that of his second son he is listed as resident in Portavogie. In the 1901 Census, 53-year-old farmer John Palmer is listed as living in Portavogie with his 43-year-old wife Maggie and their three children as listed below. At some point John sold the farm in Ballyfrench, lived in Newtonards for a while and then emigrated to the United States. He died there in 1910 as the above gravestone states. In the 1911 Census, 53-year-old Margaret Palmer is listed as a widow living in East Street, Newtownards, with 3 children listed below. Margaret Palmer died on Feb.24, 1929, aged 73 as the gravestone attests. John's children:\n\nJames Palmer, son of James and Nancy, is probably the child registered as being born on Oct.20, 1877. After his mother's death in 1886, James went to live with his uncle, John Piper; in the 1911 Census, 33-year-old labourer James Palmer is listed as living in Portavogie with his widowed uncle John Piper, a farmer, and two other uncles, James and David Piper. James was later committed to an asylum.\n\nSamuel Palmer, son of James and Nancy, was born on Aug.11, 1879, in Portavogie. After his mother's death in 1886, Samuel went to live with his uncle, John Piper. This may well be the Samuel Palmer who as a 19-year-old single man from Newtownards arrived in New York on Apr.14, 1898, aboard the ``Majestic'' from Liverpool. He was bound for his uncle, Sam Piper, at 850 Orval Avenue, Kansas City.; In the 1911 Census, 31-year-old fisherman Samuel Palmer is listed as living in Portavogie with his widowed uncle John Piper, a farmer, and two other uncles, James and David Piper.

Robert joined the New Zealand army as a rifleman and was killed in action on Oct.12, 1917, at the battle of Paschendale during WWI. He is buried in Tyne Cot Cemetery at Zonnebeke, Belgium.\n\nJohn Palmer, son of James and his third wife, died on Oct.1, 1894, age 2.\n\nAgnes Palmer, daughter of James and his third wife, was born about 1896.

In the 1901 Census 3-year-old John Alexander Palmer is listed as living in Portavogie with his parents. In the 1911 Census, 13-year-old John is listed as a schoolboy living with his mother in East Street, Newtownards.\n\nSamuel Palmer was married on Oct.26, 1882, in Portaferry Presbyterian Church to Ann Jane Finlay from Innishargie, daughter of farmer John Finlay. Samuel is given as a full-age farmer of Portavogie. Samuel owned a farm in Portavogie which he sold to buy a farm on Pipers Hill in Ballyeasborough, now a ruin. Unknown to him the new farm had a mortgage on it for which he became responsible. Because of this, he lost the farm and the family went to live in Newtownards. This caused marital problems. Samuel left his wife and family and moved to the seaport town of Troon, Ayrshire in Scotland where he lodged with the family of Hugh and Ellen (McCappin) Young on Harbour Row. The Youngs were originally from Cloughey in County Down. The Palmer family further split when three of the children, Samuel, Robert and Mary Jane left their mother in Newtownards to join their father in Troon.

The eight children of Samuel and Ann Jane Palmer:\n\nAnna Bella Palmer is buried in Movilla Cemetery, Newtownards.\n\nJames Palmer went blind and was a cricket fan. He was given a radio by the Blind Institute. He listened to it all the time and became very knowledgeable on cricket matters.

Robert died in Buffalo, New York, on Oct.3, 1942.\n\nSamuel Palmer left his mother to join his father in Troon, Scotland. Later he emigrated to the USA.\n\nMary Jane Palmer, born in Newtonards on Oct.2, 1898, left her mother to join her father in Troon, Scotland, staying with the Young family. There she met Robert Young, the son of Hugh and Ellen, who was in the Merchant Navy. They were married in 1920 and lived out their lives in Troon. Robert died in 1971 and Mary Jane in 1980. Their children:\n\nEllen McCappin Young died as an infant.\n\nRobert Young\n\nHugh Young\n\nSamuel Palmer Young was born in Troon in 1927. Married, he moved to Oxford, England, but returned to Scotland in his retirement. His son, Ralph Lindsay Young, who was born in Cowley, Oxford in about 1956, provided most of the information on the Palmer family in this chapter. Lindsay, as he is known, worked in Leicester but also returned to Scotland where he lives in Falkirk with his wife Pam, daughter Leigh Young and son Neale Young.\n\nMoira Irene Palmer Young\n\nMargaret Palmer, born in 1903, died in 1924 and is buried in Movilla Cemetery, Newtownards.\n\nSamuel Palmer (left) and Mary Jane Palmer (right) Mary (Mahood) and Robert Palmer\n\n(courtesy of Lindsay Young)\n\n(Courtesy of Lena McVea)\n\nEliza Palmer (1842-1904) of Portavogie, our ancestor, married Robert Gibson in the Glastry Meetinghouse on Feb.26, 1878. The wedding was witnessed by James Pippers and Mary McWatters, probably her mother. Eliza is listed as a spinster of full age. Robert and his father Alexander are listed as farmers.

On Oct.27, 1899, Mary Palmer was married to Robert Coffey, son of Thomas Coffey and Sarah Cully in Ballyblack Presbyterian Church.\n\nAdam Palmer, born about 1833, is mentioned on the above gravestone and is therefore probably a son of John and Nancy Palmer. On Jan.9, 1861, in Annalong Meetinghouse, Adam Palmer, a farmer from Portavogie whose father was farmer John Palmer, was married to Annie Gordon from Annalong whose father, James Gordon, was a sea captain. Annie was also called Agnes or Nancy. She and Adam had at least four children listed below. In the 1901 Census they are listed as a 68-year-old farmer and his 65-year-old wife living in Portavogie with their son John and daughter Nancy. Adam died on Oct.27, 1905; in his will he left \"all his farm to his son John who was in Downpatrick Lunatic Asylum until he was able to cope\". He also left ten pounds to daughter Elizabeth Palmer and 50 pounds to his daughter Agnes Maxwell. His executors were John Palmer, Portavogie, farmer and brother John Palmer, Portavogie, carpenter. In the 1911 Census 78-year-old widowed Nancy (Gordon) Palmer is listed as living in Portavogie with her 37-year-old married daughter, Agnes Maxwell, and Agnes's family.

This is the James Palmer of Glastry who, on Feb.27, 1822, was married to Sarah Craig of Kircubbin in Kircubbin Presbyterian Church. William Coffey and Elizabeth Filson were the witnesses. When his father died, James inherited half of the Portavogie farm. The children of James and Sarah Palmer are not easy to identify; among other things there were two James Palmers in Portavogie having children at about the same time. One seems to have been a labourer (farmer?) and the other a fisherman. Indeed two of their children married each other as seen below under James Palmer. We have listed below possible children of James and Sarah, including all those who list their father as a farmer or labourer on their marriage certificates. On Mar.17, 1818 in Greyabbey, James Palmer, Jr., registered a freehold in Portavogie worth more than 40 shillings. The landlord was David Boyd and the tenure given as the lives of Pat Nugent, esq., John Palmer and Hugh McKelvey. James died on Jul.25, 1857, at the age of 58 and Sarah on Jan.21, 1867; they are both buried in Ballyhalbert graveyard as the above gravestone inscription attests. With some speculation James and Sarah had the following children:\n\nAlexander Palmer was baptized in Kircubbin Presbyterian Church on Dec.7, 1823. On Nov.18, 1848, Alexander Palmer, a 21-year-old sailor from Portavogie and the son of farmer James Palmer was married in Glastry Meetinghouse to Nancy (or Agnes?) Mahood, 21, of Portavogie, the daughter of labourer Samuel Mahood. Adam Palmer was a witness.

They are remembered as Ballyhalbert Palmers and as carpenters and boat builders. Nancy died on Mar.30, 1883, and is memorialized on a gravestone in Ballyhalbert graveyard that reads: ``PALMER. Erected by Samuel Palmer, Ballyhalbert, in memory of his mother Agnes Palmer who died 30th March 1883 aged 52 years. Also his father Alexr. Palmer who died 15th May 1887 aged 65 years.'' Shortly after Nancy's death Alexander was married for the second time to Mary Anne McClement (born about 1863) in the Presbyterian Church, Regent Street, Newtownards, on Oct.27, 1884. Alexander died on May 15, 1887 and is memorialized on the above gravestone.

In Chicago he met Sarah Tibbs, one of 11 children of Thomas Tibbs and Jane Rainey from Kircubbin and the sister of Elizabeth Tibbs who married Samuel Palmer of Portavogie (the son of Robert Palmer and Mary Mahood). Sarah (Sally) was born on Jun.16, 1887, and had emigrated seperately in 1914. They must have returned for a visit to Ireland for they arrived back in New York aboard the Lusitania from Liverpool on Feb.7, 1914, bound for A. McMaster, 5624 Ada Street, Chicago. At the time of the 1920 census they were renting and residing with Andrew McMaster, 54 years old, who had also emigrated from Ireland in 1886 (information from Brian Kirkham, at bkirkham@sympatico.ca).

He married a woman named (Elizabeth?) King. It seems possible that this gravestone inscription in the old Ballyhalbert graveyard refers to this family: ``PALMER. Erected by James Palmer for daughter Lizzie died Jun.8, 1891, age 6 also above James Palmer died Dec.20, 1923, age 69 also his wife Elizabeth Palmer died Jan.11, 1925, age 78.''\n\nAgnes Palmer was born in Ballyfrench on Mar.8, 1864, and was christened in Glastry Meetinghouse.

If so then they are the parents of Thomas Palmer Clegg born in 1895 and listed in Nancy's parents 1901 census return. Grandchildren may be Nancy Clegg who was a deaconess and married ? McCord, John Clegg who married Jean Coffey in 1954 (their daughter Jennifer Clegg is presently (2005) a deaconess in Glastry Presbyterian Church) and Nicholas Clegg.\n\nThomas Palmer was born in Portavogie on Nov.27, 1870, with Jane Palmer present.\n\nRobert Palmer, born about 1843, was the son of James Palmer.

On his children's birth registrations John is listed as a fisherman in Portavogie. The Palmers built a small Gospel Hall on the shore side of the road between Portavogie and Ballyhalbert, at a place known as as ``Butterlump'' because of the large rock sitting on its own on the beach. In their religion, they were very strict and tended to marry others in the same sect; hence the multitude of marriages of distant cousins. Later, when others bought the Gospel Hall property, the ``date stone'' was moved to Ebineasor Hall in Portavogie. John and Esther lived at a big house named ``Beachmount'' at ``Stable Hole'', Portavogie about a half mile from Butterlump at the north end of Portavogie.

In 1913, James bought a fishing boat called the ``White Heather'' that is now a yacht; the story of the \"White Heather\" is told in a webpage at http://www.white-heather-nobby.com/story.htm.

They had nine children:\n\nWilliam Palmer was born in 1888 and married Margaret Isabella Close. He was a tall, thin and fair-haired man.
