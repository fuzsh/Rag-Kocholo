        "text": "A recent TikTok has stirred up relationship rumors between Lilly Palmer and Don Diablo.\n\nLilly Palmer’s recent TikTok shows off her and Don Diablo posing extra cozy for the carpet although she is happily married. Bringing relationship rumors to a halt, Lilly responds to comment, “mom & dad” with a happy tongue-out emoji and red heart.\n\nTechno titan Lilly Palmer and her husband Egbert Van Der Gugten, who is also a heavy-hitter influence in the techno scene, have been posting each other on their socials as early as 2017 and tied the knot in July 2023. These powerhouses share a mutual respect for the dance floor and continue to surpass expectations.\n\nLilly Palmer has been exploring the depths of the underground since 2015, stating “Music is Freedom” and claiming EDM has been her passion ever since. Releasing music on famous record labels such as Drumcode, Armada Music, and Kontor, and even launched her own label Spannung Records in 2019.\n\nEgbert Van Der Gugten, professionally known as Egbert, is a Dutch DJ/producer and has been dabbling in EDM as early as 8 years old, resources say. His career took off with the help of Secret Cinema’s discovery of him – the legend that is also responsible for lifting the careers of Enrico Sangiuliano and Reinier Zonneveld.\n\nOn the other hand, Don Diablo has been taking the world by storm with his electrifying future house and is the proud owner of his very own Hexagon imprint. Now that fans are aware he’s not dating Lilly Palmer following a recent TikTok, who is Don Diablo dating?\n\nWell, the Netherlands-based artist seems to currently be on the dating market and totally up for grabs. Despite being single, the artist is continuing to keep himself busy by focusing on his one true love: music. Through his innovative music releases and performances, he continues to keep Hexagonians (what he calls his fans) on their toes and begging for more.\n\nWith both electronic dance music artists being so prominent within the scene, there’s no doubt the pair ended up crossing paths and becoming extremely fond of each other – in a friendly manner of course. Lilly Palmer and Don Diablo have performed at some of the largest, well-known festivals like EDC Las Vegas and Tomorrowland and are both currently on their ongoing tours.\n\nThese house and techno legends continue to knock down barriers and shine in the limelight with their unparalleled talents. Although they’re not dating, it’s clear that the two musicians share a deep love and respect for each other.\n\nFeatured Image Facebook / Lilly Palmer\n\nAbout The Author"
