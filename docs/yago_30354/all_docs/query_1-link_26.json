        "text": "Lilly Palmer has been a powerhouse in the techno scene but many do not know much about her significant other, Egbert Van Der Gugten.\n\nLilly Palmer, the enigmatic and talented DJ and producer, has been a significant figure in the electronic dance music scene for years. Recently, her personal life has become an intriguing topic among fans, particularly after her appearance on the red carpet with Don Diablo. Although there have been rumors suggesting a possible romance between Lilly and Don, the truth is that Lilly Palmer is happily married to Egbert Van Der Gugten, who is also a prominent figure in the techno music world.\n\nEgbert Van Der Gugten, professionally known as Egbert, is a renowned Dutch DJ and producer whose influence in the techno scene is indisputable. He was born in 1988 and has been passionate about music from a young age, starting his production journey at the tender age of eight. Over the years, he has developed a distinct sound characterized by deep, driving beats and hypnotic rhythms.\n\nEgbert’s career took off in 2007 when he was discovered by Secret Cinema. This was a pivotal moment that catapulted him into the international techno circuit. Egbert has an impressive discography, with releases on respected labels such as Drumcode, Cocoon, and Bedrock. His debut album “Warm” was released in 2013 on GEM Records, and he has put out singles and EPs on various labels.\n\nEgbert has also remixed tracks for underground artists and collaborated with Secret Cinema on a release supported by Sven Väth. His recent singles on Mindshake Records have been favorites among underground enthusiasts. Additionally, he released his latest track ‘NRG’ on Spannung Records, which happens to be owned by his lovely wife, Lilly Palmer.\n\nEgbert’s career continues to thrive, much like his wife Lilly. Lilly Palmer and Egbert Van Der Gugten form a dynamic duo in the techno world. Their mutual passion for music and their successes have made them a formidable pair, respected and admired by fans and peers alike. Maybe a future back-to-back performance is in the works for this beautiful couple!\n\nFeature Image Credit: Instagram/egbertlive\n\nAbout The Author"
