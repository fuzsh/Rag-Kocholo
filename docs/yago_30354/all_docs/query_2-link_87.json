        "text": "Thompson named Top Cop\n\nPublished 3:48 pm Wednesday, May 7, 2008\n\nBy Staff\n\nspecial to the standard\n\nA Mobile County Sheriff's deputy, with ties to Brewton, will be honored in Washington D.C., May 12, and given the Top Cop Award for his actions in January of 2007.\n\nLieutenant Carlos Thompson, who is married to a Brewton native, was selected from hundreds of nominations for the Police Organization's National Cop Award.\n\nHe will be honored in a ceremony at the beginning of Police Week. He was selected for the award for his actions during a confrontation with an armed suspect.\n\nWhile on duty, Lieutenant Thompson attempted to perform a traffic stop after spotting a car matching a description of a suspect vehicle involved in an armed robbery. The driver of the car failed to heed the police car lights and in fact, fled the scene. Thompson pursued the suspect and was fired upon by an assault rifle. He was struck in the lower leg and hip, seriously injuring him.\n\nThompson returned fire with his pistol and was shot in the elbow, which was shattered by the high speed of the assault rifle.\n\nHe was able to use one hand to reload his weapon and continued to return fire until he saw the suspect fall to the ground.\n\nThe Top Cop Award pays tribute to the men and women in law enforcement who go beyond the call of duty.\n\nThompson is married to Vivian Motton, daughter of Celesta Motton of Brewton."
