        "text": "GLENDALE, Calif. -- Actress Lilli Palmer was buried at Forest Lawn Mortuary with neither friends or family present, a mortuary spokesman said.\n\n'The family didn't want any notice to go out,' spokesman Dick Fisher said Thursday.\n\n'Personnel at Forest Lawn witnessed her interment Wednesday morning, but there was no service. There was no one present at all besides Forest Lawn personnel.'\n\nPalmer, 71, died of a heart attack Monday. An acclaimed actress and author, she is to be seen Sunday night in her final role in the television miniseries, 'Peter The Great.'\n\nIt was not known if a memorial service was being planned for Palmer. Fisher said Forest Lawn had no such plans.\n\nPalmer began her wide-ranging career on the London stage in the 1930s and married actor Rex Harrison in 1939. They had one son. She was later remarried to Argentine writer-actor Carlos Thompson.\n\nPalmer moved to the New York stage in the 1940s and on to Hollywood, appearing in such films as 'Cloak and Dagger' with Gary Cooper in 1945, 'Body and Soul,' with John Garfield in 1948, and later, 'The Boys From Brazil' with Gregory Peck in 1978.\n\nIn the four-part NBC miniseries, 'Peter The Great,' Palmer plays Natalya, the mother of Peter. A network spokesman said her performance is 'beautiful and regal.'\n\nPalmer's autobiography, 'Change Lobsters and Dance,' was applauded by critics and readers alike, selling more than a million copies. Harrison was outraged at the book's accounts of the couple's stormy marriage."
