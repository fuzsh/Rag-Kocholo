        "text": "Born Vera Jayne Palmer on April 19, 1933, in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, married at 16 to high school sweetheart Paul Mansfield and becoming a mother at 17 (to Jayne Marie Mansfield, born in 1950), she started out as a physics major but then switched to drama at the University of Texas and later at UCLA. In the early hours of June 29, 1967, Mansfield, along with her 20-year-old driver and her boyfriend, Sam Brody, were killed when the driver plowed the 1966 Buick Electra in which they were riding into the back of a large truck outside of Biloxi MS. Three of her children were in the backseat but escaped with minor injuries. Mansfield was the daughter of a lawyer who died when Mansfield was six, at which time her mother moved the family from Pennsylvania to Dallas. While attending Southern Methodist University, the 16-year-old Palmer married student Paul James Mansfield. Lacking the funds for day-care service, Jayne attended acting classes in Los Angeles with her infant daughter strapped on her back like a papoose. OR From her childhood as Vera Jayne Palmer in the early thirties in Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania\n\nShe was the only child of Herbert and Vera Palmer and grew up in a pampered household. Herbert was a very successful lawyer, who had political aspirations. Herbert died of a fatal heart attack when Jayne was only three. Her mother met and married a man by the name of Harry Peers within a year of Herbert's death, and they moved from Phillipsburg, NJ to Harry's home in Dallas.\n\nHer early years were fondly remembered as her family being fairly well off, having what normal kids have while growing up. Until she discovered movie fan magazines. From then on she wanted to become an actress. Her mother, while supportive of Jayne, had no idea how ferocious Jayne's aspirations were.\n\nOn May 6, 1950 at the age of seventeen, Jayne married Paul Mansfield after learning she was pregnant. She referred to Paul as being the most handsome boy in her crowd at school, and having the most gorgeous eyes. She graduated from high school and gave birth to Jayne Marie Mansfield on November 8, 1950.\n\nOne of Mansfield's daughter with Mickey Hargitay is Mariska Hargitay.\n\nPalmer was born on September 10, 1929, in Latrobe, a small industrial town in Western Pennsylvania at the foothills of the Allegheny Mountains some 50 miles east of Pittsburgh. He still spends the warm months of the year there, but makes his winter home in the Orlando area. He has numerous active and honorary memberships in clubs throughout the world, including famed St. Andrews in Scotland and prominent Oakmont in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe golfing great has been the recipient of countless honors, the symbolic plaques, trophies and citations scattered throughout his personal, club and business worlds. He has received virtually every national award in golf and after his great 1960 season both the Hickok Athlete of the Year and Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year trophies. He is a charter member of the World Golf Hall of Fame and a member of the American Golf Hall of Fame at Foxburg, PA, and the PGA Hall of Fame in Florida. He is chairman of the USGA Members Program and served as Honorary National Chairman of the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation for 20 years. He played a major role in the fund-raising drive that led to the creation of the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children and Women in Orlando in the 1980s. A long-time member of the Board of Directors of Latrobe Area Hospital, he established a major annual fund-raising golf event for that institution in 1992.\n\nThe saga of Arnold Palmer began when he was four years old, swinging his first set of golf clubs, cut down by his father, Milfred J. (Deacon) Palmer, who worked at Latrobe Country Club from 1921 until his death in 1976, much of that time as both golf professional and course superintendent. Before long, Arnie was playing well enough to beat the older caddies at the club. He began caddying himself when he was 11 and worked at virtually every job at the club in the ensuing years.\n\nThe strongly-built young man concentrated on golf in high school and soon was dominating the game in Western Pennsylvania. He won his first of five West Penn Amateur Championships when he was 17, competed successfully in national junior events and went to Wake Forest University (then College), where he became No. 1 man on the golf team and one of the leading collegiate players of that time. Deeply affected by the death in an auto accident of his close friend and classmate, Bud Worsham, younger brother of 1947 U.S. Open Champion Lew Worsham, Arnold withdrew from college during his senior year and began a three-year hitch in the Coast Guard. His interest in golf rekindled while he was stationed in Cleveland. He was working there as a salesman and playing amateur golf after his discharge from the service and brief return to Wake Forest when he won the U.S. Amateur in 1954 following his second straight victory in the Ohio Amateur earlier that summer. It was during this period that he met Winifred Walzer at a tournament in Eastern Pennsylvania. They were married shortly after he turned professional in the fall of 1954 and Winnie traveled with him when he joined the pro tour in early 1955. The Palmers have two daughters - Peggy Palmer Wears, of Durham, NC, and Amy Palmer Saunders, of Windermere, FL; four granddaughters, Emily (1127/81), Katherine Anne (912182), Anne Palmer (9/14184) Saunders and Nicola Wears and a grandson, Samuel Palmer Saunders (7130187). Arnold's brother, Jerry, who succeeded their father as course superintendent at Latrobe CC, and sisters, Mrs. Lois Jean Tilley and Sandra Sarady, live in the Latrobe area. Jerry is now general manager of Latrobe CC and all Palmer properties there. Their mother, Dons, passed away in 1979 after a long, brave battle against crippling arthritis."
