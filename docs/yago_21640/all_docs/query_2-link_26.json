        "text": "Bud Elliott graduated from Florida State University in 2007 and then proceeded to law school at the University of Alabama, graduating in 2010. After that, Elliott quickly took a career turn into sports, launching an independent Florida State site that quickly joined the SB Nation network. His time running Tomahawk Nation led him into the world of college football recruiting â€” acting as SB Nation's recruiting analyst until his eventual departure in 2020. Elliott moved to 247Sports Network in 2020, and he's worked with the national recruiting staff and created content for 247's college football coverage. Elliott is part of the CBS Sports' Cover 3 Podcast panel, one of the top college sports podcasts in the nation.\n\n***\n\nTim Fitzgerald is a sports journalist who writes, does TV, radio, daily YouTube videos, and is a long-time podcaster. He has served as publisher of GoPowercat.com, a website that focuses on Kansas State sports, for more than 25 years. Fitz also has metastatic Stage Four prostate cancer, so during the initial stages of the pandemic, his doctors advised him to stay home and lay low. Now, after a brief period of remission, Fitz is back in the fight for his life, but this podcast lives on.
