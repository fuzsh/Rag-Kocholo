Once the inquiry form is sent, Joey will respond within 48 hours. If Joey is available, he'll discuss details via email. Once everything is confirmed you'll be sent a signed agreement in which you'll be asked to read over and sign. If Joey is unavailable, he'll respond with a list of highly recommended musicians in the area.\n\nâ€‹\n\nQ: Do you require a deposit?\n\nA: Yes, typically we require a deposit of half the total compensation.\n\nQ: Do you provide all your own sound equipment?\n\nA: Yes, we provide all of our own equipment including a state-of-the-art sound system that can accommodate up to 500 guests.\n\nâ€‹\n\nQ: Do you have any special provisions?\n\nA: We ask to be as close to an outlet as possible.

We typically arrive 2 hours early for weddings, 1 1/2 hours early for corporate events, and 1 hour early for private parties and restaurants.\n\nâ€‹\n\nQ: Do you carry liability insurance?\n\nA: Yes, we carry liability insurance up to $1,000,000â€‹ general aggregate.\n\nâ€‹\n\nQ: Do you play music during your breaks?\n\nA: We shuffle pre-cued music playlists during our breaks (genre depending on the event). If you'd like to shuffle your own playlist during our breaks, please forward it to Joey no less than 2 weeks before our performance.\n\nQ: How will you be dressed?\n\nA: You choose the attire between tropical, formal, business-casual, and all black-professional.\n\nQ: Do you provide lighting?\n\nA: Yes, we can provide band uplighting (upon request) for no additional charge.\n\nâ€‹\n\nQ: Can we request a song for you to learn?â€‹\n\nA: We can learn a requested song(s) for $100 for acoustic performances and $200 for band performances. Please let us know at least a month in advance.\n\nâ€‹\n\nQ: Can we pick which songs you play?â€‹\n\nA: Yes, you may customize the setlist for your event by making a list of songs that you do/do not want to hear. Check out the song list page on our website.\n\nâ€‹\n\nQ: Can you perform with a female singer?â€‹\n\nA: Yes, we are available to perform alongside a female singer (upon availability).\n\nQ: Are you able to provide additional speakers so we can hear you in multiple rooms?\n\nA: Yes, we have a wireless speaker that can be placed up to 50ft away from our gear (+ $200 fee).\n\nâ€‹\n\nQ: Do you provide a stage or tent?\n\nA: We do NOT provide a stage or tent but would be happy to use them, if provided by the venue.
