Be sure to include the date, time, location, and act you're inquiring about (solo, duo, 5-piece band, etc.). We can also provide a quote with some multiple options. Once the inquiry form is sent, Joey will respond within 48 hours. If Joey is available, he'll discuss details via email. Once everything is confirmed you'll be sent a signed agreement in which you'll be asked to read over and sign. If Joey is unavailable, he'll respond with a list of highly recommended musicians in the area.\n\n​\n\nQ: Do you require a deposit?\n\nA: Yes, typically we require a deposit of half the total compensation.\n\nQ: Do you provide all your own sound equipment?\n\nA: Yes, we provide all of our own equipment including a state-of-the-art sound system that can accommodate up to 500 guests.\n\n​\n\nQ: Do you have any special provisions?\n\nA: We ask to be as close to an outlet as possible.

We typically arrive 2 hours early for weddings, 1 1/2 hours early for corporate events, and 1 hour early for private parties and restaurants.\n\n​\n\nQ: Do you carry liability insurance?\n\nA: Yes, we carry liability insurance up to $1,000,000​ general aggregate.\n\n​\n\nQ: Do you play music during your breaks?\n\nA: We shuffle pre-cued music playlists during our breaks (genre depending on the event). If you'd like to shuffle your own playlist during our breaks, please forward it to Joey no less than 2 weeks before our performance.\n\nQ: How will you be dressed?\n\nA: You choose the attire between tropical, formal, business-casual, and all black-professional.\n\nQ: Do you provide lighting?\n\nA: Yes, we can provide band uplighting (upon request) for no additional charge.\n\n​\n\nQ: Can we request a song for you to learn?​\n\nA: We can learn a requested song(s) for $100 for acoustic performances and $200 for band performances. Please let us know at least a month in advance.\n\n​\n\nQ: Can we pick which songs you play?​\n\nA: Yes, you may customize the setlist for your event by making a list of songs that you do/do not want to hear. Check out the song list page on our website.\n\n​\n\nQ: Can you perform with a female singer?​\n\nA: Yes, we are available to perform alongside a female singer (upon availability).\n\nQ: Are you able to provide additional speakers so we can hear you in multiple rooms?\n\nA: Yes, we have a wireless speaker that can be placed up to 50ft away from our gear (+ $200 fee).\n\n​\n\nQ: Do you provide a stage or tent?\n\nA: We do NOT provide a stage or tent but would be happy to use them, if provided by the venue.
