Here are a few of the rumors that I recall and I often get asked from recruits about the recruiting process, BUD/S itself, as well as life as a SEAL. My rule of thumb is if you hear something about SEAL training from someone who has NEVER been a SEAL, then chances are it is wrong. Here is a list of some serious misinformation about SEAL Training:\n\nRUMOR CONTROL - You have to learn to how to hold your breath for 4-5 minutes at BUDS. FALSE\n\nNO - you do not have to hold your breath for long periods of time. During the 50m swim, if you can learn how to swim efficiently, you will find that your breath hold time is under a minute for that distance. Even the drown-proofing, underwater knot tying, and Pool Competency in 2nd phase is limited to maybe one minute of holding your breath. The key is relaxing when underwater when performing work / tasks. There is not need to try to hold your breath for long periods of time. People die each year practicing for these events so do not do them. The Navy will teach you how to do these skills when you get there. For now learn how to swim efficiently and get from one of the pool to the other in as few strokes as possible. See videos of swimming tests\n\nRUMOR CONTROL - Since they got rid of Mini-BUD/S, the Navy wants SEAL recruits to go to SEAL Training camps before they go to Boot Camp. FALSE\n\nMini-BUD/S was an officer course that pre-trained about 100 officer candidates from ROTC and USNA each year. They attended three weeks of the training in the summer at BUD/S. I did this training in 1990. Due to the needs of the Navy to produce more SEALs, BUD/S has not been able to do this summer training since after 2003. I have heard in the past few months that some Navy SEAL recruits think that it is mandatory to attend a Navy SEAL style training camp complete with 24 hour Hell week simulation. As a guest instructor at a few of these camps, I can say that the Navy does NOT make these events a mandatory part of your pre-training. In fact, the Navy does not want to see a recruit get injured prior to enlisting. However, the training does offer the candidate a taste of SEAL training and the pre-training will either 100% motivate or 100% de-motivate the person toward / away from the SEAL program. In my opinion, the Navy has gone out of its way to make the pre-training cycle better for recruits - with the addition of Navy SEAL / EOD mentors in each recruiting district and the pre-BUDS training after boot camp in Great Lakes to help prepare the students physically for the training. As far as paying for a training program, if you want to kick yourself in the nuts and see how you do - that is your business, the Navy does not recommend it.\n\nNo more Mini-BUDS - it is now called SOAS - SEAL Officer Assessment and Selection. It is a selection course that all officers candidates attend for three weeks from all assession groups - USNA, ROTC, and OCS. See more on this program and how they select officers now.\n\nRUMOR CONTROL - You should enlist in the Army or USMC to get some experience first in combat arms before enlisting into SEALs. FALSE\n\nYou can do what is called an inter-service transfer from the Army or USMC and become a Navy Sailor but they are very difficult to do. The Army / USMC will keep who they have until the enlistment is done. Now after you have served your contract in the Army / USMC, you can join the Navy and go to SEAL training. But the ONLY way to get to BUDS is by being in the Navy. Well - there is one way - see next RUMOR CONTROL\n\nRUMOR CONTROL - You can be in the Coast Guard and go to BUDS. WAS TRUE...now FALSE\n\nRUMOR CONTROL - I heard I have to have a suicide pill with me on missions in case I get captured. FALSE"
