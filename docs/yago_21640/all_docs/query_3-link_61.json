        "text": "\"With Bud, you need to do less admin. It gives you assurance that you’ve dotted the i’s and crossed the t’s and everything is right before you press the button. From day one, you know that you’re compliant. It’s been an investment in our future.\"\n\n\"Every time the inspectors asked a question, I wasn’t going away to ask my admin or compliance teams to find information, or asking employers or learners to go and do anything. It was all in front of the inspectors. Literally, with the click of a button.\"\n\n\"I knew it was going to improve our delivery, but I didn’t recognise the extent to which using systems that weren’t fit for purpose were impacting our operations. I never imagined the kind of ROI that we have realised.\"\n\n\"What we really liked about Bud is that it has been designed with apprenticeship standards in mind, allowing us to outline our unique curriculum, which we fully map to the Knowledge, Skills, Behaviours and additional qualifications prior to enrolment.\"\n\n“The fact that the Bud platform was the most ‘joined-up’ of all the solutions was a key factor in our decision making. Bud’s workflows, which are designed to drive compliance, were really important to us and the ILR pulling through is extraordinary.”\n\n\"We are now 6 months into using Bud and WOW! The engagement of our learners is off the charts and the progress they are making academically is phenomenal. From enrolment to learner/trainer communication, it has really improved the efficiency of our delivery!\""
