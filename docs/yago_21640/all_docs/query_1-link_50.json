Schools like Ohio State, Florida, LSU, and Alabama are heavily mentioned.\n\nPosition U: Defensive line | Edge | Linebacker | Defensive back\n\nPosition U is one of the great bragging rights debates in college athletics. Which program produces the most NFL talent for any given position? It’s a living debate, it’s historical and, in many cases, it’s irrelevant. This week the recruiting team at 247Sports is breaking it down, position by position, and Barton and Bud hop on the pod to dig even deeper into the results."
