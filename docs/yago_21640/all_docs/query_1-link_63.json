Fostering a diverse workforce benefits both employees and patients by offering an inclusive place to provide and receive care. Men and women from different backgrounds serve in a number of roles in our organization. While we may come from different experiences, we all share the same goal of providing high quality patient care.\n\nProviding Culturally Competent Care\n\nOur employees receive annual training designed to support and encourage an inclusive environment for healthcare delivery and customer service. Additional resources are available to assist with the delivery of healthcare, such as translation and technology services and responding to cultural issues for patients and families of different backgrounds.\n\nRecruiting and Retaining Diverse Talent\n\nAs an Equal Opportunity Employer, we are committed to recruiting talented employees with valuable expertise from different races, religions, genders, sexual orientations and other protected classes. We participate in local career fairs and business expos, work with recruiting sources to actively seek diverse applicants, and partner with colleges and schools with significant minority enrollment to identify highly qualified applicants."
