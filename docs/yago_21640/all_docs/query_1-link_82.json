        "text": "Hong Kong Customs seizes suspected cannabis buds worth about $23 million (with photo)\n\nHong Kong Customs seized about 100 kilograms of suspected cannabis buds with an estimated market value of about $23 million at the Kwai Chung Customhouse Cargo Examination Compound on April 5.\n\nThrough risk assessment, Hong Kong Customs on that day inspected a seaborne consolidated consignment, declared as carrying auto parts, arriving in Hong Kong from the United States, at the Kwai Chung Customhouse Cargo Examination Compound. Upon inspection, Customs officers seized the batch of suspected cannabis buds from 18 vehicle wheels inside the consignment. Upon a follow-up investigation, Customs officers conducted controlled delivery operations and arrested a 36-year-old male consignee, who claimed to be a driver, in Kwai Chung on April 8.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing and the arrested man has been released on bail pending further investigation.\n\nUnder the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.\n\nMembers of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 2545 6182 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/).\n\nEnds/Saturday, April 20, 2024\n\nPress Release"
