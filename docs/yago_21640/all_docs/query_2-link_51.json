        "text": "These days, studios have been getting old superhero actors to come back and reprise their original roles. It’s especially true of Marvel, both because of its Multiverse Saga and the sweet, sweet nostalgia power. Since Daredevil and Kingpin can be in new MCU shows and played by their Netflix actors, that means anyone could come back, right? That’s exactly what Finn Jones is hoping for when it comes to his character, Iron Fist.\n\nIf Jones had his way, he’d be donning Danny Rand’s yellow cowl once more. Talking to Dutch outlet The Nerd Shepard at Heroes Dutch Comic-Con, he talked about how he’s at a point in his career where he’d “like to continue to grow with Iron Fist.” But instead of asking for a third season of Iron Fist, he’d rather do the dynamic duo thing with Mike Colter’s Luke Cage. The two had a solid enough rapport in Defenders that Danny popped in as a guest star for Luke’s second season. To Jones, teaming with Colter to reunite their characters in a Heroes for Hire show and be the best buds they are in the comics is the smart play.\n\n“I’d love to see the chemistry between me and Mike again,” he continued. “I think there’s a lot of great stories that could be told with those characters, and if they brought me and Mike back to do a Heroes for Hire TV series, I think it would be the way to go.” Unlike Charlie Cox, it doesn’t seem like Jones is being evasive or leaving hints for a potential appearance in an upcoming project: he told Nerd Outlet he had “no expectations” from the entertainment industry in general. Between COVID and the Hollywood strikes, he believes “to have expectations in this industry is just impossible.”\n\nBit of a problem, though: in the comics, the current Iron Fist is a teenager named Lin Lie who’s had the mantle since 2022. Lin’s popped up over the past few years in miniseries and events, and his entire existence feels like a soft launch before he eventually shows up in live-action. He and Danny aren’t in each other’s orbit like that, and while that can always change, it may be a while before Marvel puts Iron Fist in the forefront, especially when Shang-Chi is right there with bigger franchise potential.\n\nDo Jones and Danny Rand have a place in the MCU like Daredevil and Punisher? Let us know what you think in the comments below.\n\n[via IGN]"
