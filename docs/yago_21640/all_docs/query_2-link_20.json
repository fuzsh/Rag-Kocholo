        "text": "Your power is your capacity to be embodied in your own body, heart and soul. To really BE YOU! As an Artist, your genius lies in your capacity to be yourself and be with that freedom, truth and instinct. Right now, you are showing up in your career from a conditioned and powerless place. That is not you. The work to do is to reset your instrument and undo that conditioning so you can go back to your power and into who you really are. Then you will be able to show up completely truthful, free and unique in your reels, headshots, networking, auditions and content. Then people will be able to see and experience YOU. That's how you have power over your career. Your career is only going to be the result of you being able to show up 100% YOU. #acting #actors #actingquote #actingcoach #actor\n\nLooking to connect with international actors based in India, you can be any ethnicity. Whether you're someone looking to start an acting career, or already a working actor, you can be based in any part of India. Do connect on DM. This is for a something I am working on. And need some exchange of ideas and viewpoints on the same. #internationalactors #actors\n\nBassim, the star of the iconic \"Hands Up\" play I Can, is working on a brand new play in Khan Younis.

Also, please share his workâ€”we want him to be heard and seen. The link to his latest play is in the comments section.\n\nI am thankful that in this digital age more and more people are defying stereotypes and false beliefs used for binding people and preventing them to achieve their destiny. To more boldness, more transformations and destinies unleashed in 2024, for we all benefit from the shining lights!!! Save your place to join us for \"I Transform Me\", an extraordinary event about self-transformation for unleashing your potential and becoming who you want to become in 2024 and beyond.

Whoâ€™s interested in going?? Two years ago, when AILA annual was in NYC, I organized (pretty last minute) a standup comedy show at the iconic Carolines comedy club in Times Square. (Check out the link for an edited version of the show - itâ€™s hilarious if you want a 15 minute comedy break: https://lnkd.in/d4aEfQSx) All the comics were immigrants, and most touched on aspects of their immigration story in their comedy. It was so crazy to put together last minute, but it turned out better than I could have ever imagined: over 200 people showed up, we had sponsors, people ate, drank, and laughedâ€¦ a LOT! This year I want to do something similar, and with more advanced planning ðŸ˜… And since the conference is in Chicago, which is one of the biggest improv comedy cities in the world, I want to bring improv to AILA, and AILA to improv! So, Whoâ€™s going to AILA annual conference this year and would be interested in attending an improv comedy night?! Please let me know in the comments! Iâ€™m already super excited for itâ€¦ And seriously, watch the video below - itâ€™s so funny, the comics killed it! #immigration #immigrationlaw #h1bvisa #globalmobility #immigrationlawyer"
