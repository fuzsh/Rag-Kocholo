A two-reeler, it's a propaganda comedy involving a little boy who can't wait to go fight against the Kaiser, and who sets an unrelentingly patriotic (and militaristic) example for his draft-age, feminized brother and peace-lovin' mother.",

        "text": "I'm pretty sure there was no way King Vidor could have explicitly challenged the jingo patriotism that accompanied the war effort, but it sure is easy to read this bad boy against the grain; the throwing of shade begins in the very first scene, conflating a recruitment drive with a gaggle of boys playing make-believe bootcamp and going through the motions of pretend drills and storybook manouevres, all leading up to an attack on a strawman labelled THE KAISUR.\n\nLater there's pacifists and debate and nuance... and a restored-to-normativity ending with the wussyboy enlisting after all.\n\nWar as a kind of boy’s sport - the rivalry between two brothers, one an ardent teenage patriot too young to fight and the other a smug pacifist, with slapstick comedy abounding around kids play acting at war or pacifists getting into fights at their clubs. As a lightly comic short this early Vidor is delightful, clearly delineating its cast (to the point the distinctive eyeglasses and moustache of one character are so specifically identifiable as to be akin to a disguise) and with a keen eye towards that sort of naive boyish fantasy of war, imprinted on with patriotic images and waving flags. But of course this does feel all very much like an overlong advertisement to enlist; especially…"
