        "text": "Among the issues listed in the report is that Navy leadership was aware of the substance use, but did not test recruits to prevent it, and failed to provide medical supervision to curb the \"increased intensity\" of training that left some SEAL candidates hospitalized or dead.\n\nA total of 11 SEAL candidates have died during training over the years, according to Navy report\n\nThe training to become a Navy SEAL includes 24-week program known as Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL or BUD/S. Recruits are required to complete grueling tests of physical and mental fortitude such as \"Hell Week\" a six-day period of more than 200 miles of running, nearly constant exposure to freezing cold, damp environments, and severe sleep deprivation.\n\nThe new Navy report, released May 25, is the result of recent scrutiny of the infamously grueling training program for candidates hoping to join the ranks of the elite special operators known as SEALs.\n\nIn February 2022, one such candidate, Seaman Kyle Mullen, died during the program's most notorious period of physical and mental challenge known as \"Hell Week.\" Mullen suffered from pneumonia and was coughing up blood for days, but an officer told his fellow recruits not to call 911 because it could interfere with training, the Times reported.\n\nThrough the program's 70-year history, 10 other candidates have died and many have been seriously injured, according to the Times.\n\nRelated stories\n\nNavy SEAL candidates reportedly use PEDs like testosterone, growth hormone, and Viagra to get through training\n\nAfter Mullen's death, a subsequent Navy investigation found performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) in his car, including testosterone and human growth hormone. Several other SEAL candidates were removed from the program for drug use following the investigation.\n\nThe Times also previously reported that Mullen and other SEAL candidate used Viagra, against medical advice, to offset health issues from training like fluid build up in the lungs from cold water swimming.\n\nThe report detailed that substance use has been a pervasive problem among SEAL recruits for more than a decade, and while the Navy is aware of the problem, leadership has never implemented a system of testing to detect or enforce drug violations, according to the Times.\n\nSome Navy leaders blamed recruits' lack of \"mental toughness\"\n\nIn addition to the safety concerns, graduate rates for the already-exclusive SEAL program have plummeted in recent years, dropping from 30% to less than 10% in some classes, the Times reported.\n\nIn response to concerns about the low graduation rate, and potentially dangerous surge in dropouts, a commander in charge at the time suggested that new recruits were too soft to complete the program.\n\nThe commander, Capt. Bradley Geary \"believed the primary reason for attrition issue was the current generation had less mental toughness,\" according to the report."
