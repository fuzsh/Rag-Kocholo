        "text": "IF he were a batter, he would be hitting .050. If he were a pitcher, his record would be 1-10. If he were a manager, his team would be adrift in last place.\n\nIn any of those baseball jobs, he would be out. Waived. Released. Fired.\n\nAfter four years in his job as baseball's acting commissioner without any appreciable progress in its lingering labor dispute, Allan (Bud) Selig deserves to be out. Let him just be what he has been for nearly three decades, the Milwaukee Brewers' president.\n\nIdeally, the club owners need to hire a real commissioner with real authority, not another acting commissioner who seems afraid to act, afraid to jeopardize his $1.25 million salary.\n\nIf the club owners don't want to commit to a real commissioner with real authority, at least they should hire somebody with a temporary title who would be willing to act on behalf of the fans in leading the owners out of their labor wilderness."
