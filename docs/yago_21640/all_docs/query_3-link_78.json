        "text": "When Bud Schultz came to Bates he was already an accomplished athlete, with high school letters in basketball, soccer and of course tennis. At Bates, Bud was a three-time All-American in tennis. He was a starter for three years on the basketball team and was an All-New England Division III selection his senior year. After he graduated from Bates in 1981, he completed a year in graduate school at Boston University, and started his professional tennis career in 1982. Over seven years as a professional tennis player, Bud played in the French Open, Wimbledon, and the U.S. and Australian Opens. He defeated more than five top-10 players and had a career-high world ranking of No. 39. He says he had “the privilege of losing” to Hall of Famers John McEnroe, Ivan Lendl, Jimmy Connors, Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, Mats Wilander, and Yannick Noah. He retired at the age of 29 to take the position of Director of Tennis and Head Pro at the historical Longwood Cricket Club in Brookline, Mass. Bud continued his association with professional tennis by coaching such players as Ivan Lendl, Pam Shriver, and Greg Rusedski, all ranked top five in the world. He completed a master’s degree in sports management at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. As a player, Bud competed nationally in the 35's age division, winning two national titles in singles and one in doubles. In 2003 he was inducted into the New England Tennis Hall of Fame. Bud is married to Elaine Cosseboom and has three children. Bud and Elaine own and manage the Cohasset Tennis Club in Cohasset, Mass. Bud’s work embodies the marriage of sports and social service. In 1998, while on the Board of the Boston Tennis Council, an umbrella organization of small inner-city tennis programs, Bud his friend Ned Eames created Tenacity — a citywide tennis, academic and life skills development program that now provides tennis and academic support to over 3,500 children in the city of Boston. In just three years, Tennis Week magazine voted TENACITY the fourth-best urban tennis organization in the country. Now in its eighth year, the United States Tennis Association is using Tenacity as a model for urban tennis programs nationwide. Carl Straub, who was Dean of the Faculty when Bud was a student, had this to say about his friend: “I am not surprised to learn about Bud Schultz's journey of caring about others and their welfare. Such personal strength was evident in everything he did while an undergraduate. His fierce sense of integrity was always joined by a gentle and giving spirit; his obvious competitive successes on the tennis courts were always held in check by a deeper appreciation of what binds us all together. I continue to remember him celebrating the many goodnesses of life.”\n\nWith Dana Mulholland looking on, Bud Schultz accepts congratulations from Vice President for External Affairs William Hiss."
