        "text": "Referenced in[]\n\nL.A. Confidential\n\nHistory[]\n\nWendell A. “Bud” White was born in Los Angles, California in 1919. Bud’s father is described as physically abusive to both him and his mother. At sixteen, Bud warned his father that he would kill him if his mother faced further abuse, leading to an incident in which his father restrained Bud and beat his mother to death with a tire iron. Bud was left in the room with his mother’s corpse for a week, becoming delirious from lack of food or water until eventually being found and freed by truancy officer. The trial, a diminished capacity defense, a plea bargain down to Manslaughter Two. Life imprisonment, the old man paroled in twelve years. His son—Officer Wendell White, LAPD—decided to kill him. The old man was nowhere. He’d jumped parole; prowling his L.A. haunts turned up nothing. Bud kept looking, kept waking to the sound of women screaming. The old man was nowhere. He made the Bureau, partnered up with Dick Stens. Dick showed him the ropes, heard out his story, told him to pick his shots to get even. Pops would stay nowhere, but thumping wife beaters might drive the nightmares out of his system. Bud picked a great first shot: a domestic squawk, the complainant a longtime punching bag, the arrestee a three-time loser. He detoured on the way to the station, asked the guy if he’d like to tango with a man for a change: no cuffs, a walk on the charge if he won. The guy agreed; Bud broke his nose, his jaw, ruptured his spleen with a dropkick. Dick was right: his bad dreams stopped. His rep as the toughest man in the LAPD grew. He kept it up; he followed up: intimidation calls if the fuckers got acquitted, welcome home strongarms if they did time and got parole. He forced himself not to take gratitude lays and found women elsewhere. He kept a list of court and parole dates and sent the fuckers postcards at the honor farm; he got hit with excessive-force complaints and toughed them out. Dick Stens made him a decent detective; now he played nursemaid to his teacher: keeping him half sober on duty, holding him back when he got a hard-on to shoot for kicks.\n\nL.A. Confidential[]\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1951 Bud waits for his partner, Dick Stensland, when Johnny Stompanato comes gets in his car, hoping for some cash since being out of work due to Mickey Cohen being in prison. Since he knows Bud hates wife beaters with a passion and gets money in return. Going after the guy he finally arrests him, but not before giving him a beating. Next him and Stens finally meet up and make an arrest of a call they got.\n\nGoing to the party he goes out to get some fresh air but when it's heard that they captured two more individuals who attacked some cops a fight breaks out between the prisoners and cops, and when Bud enters he beats up one of them.
