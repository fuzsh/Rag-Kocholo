        "text": "NEW YORK, NY â October 17, 2023 â With a century-long commitment to supporting the military and honoring those who serve our country, Anheuser-Busch is proud to expand upon its support of Folds of Honor - the organizationâs longest standing partner â as Bud Light launches an initiative to help Folds of Honor deliver $3M in educational scholarships to the families of first responders. Throughout the 2023-2024 NFL season, Bud Light will be joined by the brandâs NFL team partners across the league in honoring the families who sacrificed so much for the country and our communities.\n\nâAnheuser-Busch is incredibly proud to be a founding partner of Folds of Honor, as we continue our 13-year mission to make a powerful impact on the lives of the families of military veterans and first responders,â said Brendan Whitworth, CEO, Anheuser-Busch. âTogether with the NFL, we stand firm in our commitment to supporting our local communities and serving those who serve.â\n\nâEvery second around the country, first responders perform selfless acts of heroism with unwavering commitment to their community and country,â said Todd Allen, VP of Marketing for Bud Light. âThatâs why Bud Light is proud to come together with the NFL, and its network of teams and communities nationwide, to support Folds of Honor by recognizing the first responders behind these acts and assisting their families who sacrifice so much.â\n\nToday through November 26, Bud Light and Folds of Honor have opened a dedicated scholarship application window available exclusively for families of fallen or disabled first responders. To generate awareness of this important cause, Bud Light also released âFirst Responders Fund,â a :60 second film that tells the real stories of the lives impacted by Folds of Honor scholarships. Families of fallen or disabled first responders can find more information at budlight.com/foldsofhonor.\n\nThroughout the 2023-2024 NFL season, Bud Light and its partner teams across the NFL will be recognizing first responders with scholarship presentations, digital signage takeovers and local activations.\n\nâThe NFL proudly supports the dedication and sacrifice of first responders. These heroes are the backbone of our communities, ensuring our safety, health, and well-being every day. We extend our sincere appreciation to all first responders for their selfless service. We are proud of the commitment from our clubs and excited to collaborate with Bud Light and Folds of Honor to raise awareness on valuable resources available for first responders and their families,â said an NFL spokesperson.\n\nOver the last 13 years, founding partner Anheuser-Busch, its brands, and wholesaler partners have donated $21.7 million, which has contributed to Folds of Honorâs delivery of over 51,000 scholarships since the non-profitâs founding. These educational scholarships benefit the spouses and children of military members who have fallen or been disabled while serving in the United States Armed Forces and have recently expanded to support first responders' spouses and children.\n\nâWe are so proud to continue our work with Anheuser-Busch, Bud Light, and now the NFL to further expand our mission and support of those who serve us every day,â said Lt Col Dan Rooney, founder and CEO of Folds of Honor. âAnheuser-Buschâs generous scholarship commitment and partnership with the NFL allows us to reach new scholars as we look to make a significant impact in the lives of the first respondersâ families through critical educational scholarship support.â\n\nTo learn more about Bud Lightâs partnership with Folds of Honor, visit budlight.com/foldsofhonor or follow Bud Light on Facebook at Facebook.com/BudLight, on Twitter at @BudLight, and on Instagram at @BudLight.\n\n###\n\nAbout Bud Light\n\nThe Bud Light brand name represents a family of products including Bud Light, Bud Light Seltzer, Bud Light Chelada, Bud Light NEXT, Bud Light Peels, Bud Light Platinum and Bud Light Platinum Seltzer.
