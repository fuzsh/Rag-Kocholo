        "text": "New York, NY â May 16, 2023 â This summer, Anheuser-Busch and its wholesaler partners are once again joining forces with Folds of Honor to release limited-edition Budweiser and Bud Light packaging that provides life-changing scholarships to the spouses and children of fallen or disabled U.S. service members and first responders.\n\nWith a century-long commitment to supporting the military and honoring those who serve our country, Anheuser-Busch is proud to continue its support of Folds of Honor as the organizationâs longest standing partner. Over the last 13 years, Anheuser-Busch, its brands, and wholesaler partners have donated $21.7 million which has contributed to Folds of Honorâs delivery of 44,000 scholarships since the non-profitâs founding.\n\nFor over a decade, Anheuser-Busch has released annual patriotic-themed packaging to support Folds of Honor and, this year, Budweiser and Bud Light will be releasing limited-edition Folds of Honor aluminum bottles, available beginning on Memorial Day. Budweiser and Bud Lightâs limited-edition aluminum bottles will feature monochromatic-camo designs in iconic Budweiser red and Bud Light blue, with an interactive QR code so consumers can learn more about the work Folds of Honor is doing. The limited-edition aluminum bottles will be available wherever Budweiser and Bud Light are sold, while supplies last.\n\nIn celebration of the work Folds of Honor has achieved to date and to mark its 13-year partnership, Folds of Honor and Budweiser are releasing a co-branded film featuring the impact Folds of Honor scholarships has had on scholarship recipients and their families. You can watch the film HERE.\n\nThe limited-edition bottles are the first phase of a yearlong program from Anheuser-Busch and Folds of Honor that will extend into the fall.\n\nABOUT ANHEUSER-BUSCH\n\nAt Anheuser-Busch, our purpose is to create a future with more cheers.
