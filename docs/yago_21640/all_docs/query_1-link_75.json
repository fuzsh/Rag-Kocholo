        "text": "During vesicular trafficking and release of enveloped viruses, the budding and fission processes dynamically remodel the donor cell membrane in a protein-or a lipid-mediated manner. In all cases, in addition to the generation or relief of the curvature stress, the buds recruit specific lipids and proteins from the donor membrane through restricted diffusion for the development of a ring-type raft domain of closed topology. Here, by reconstituting the bud topography in a model membrane, we demonstrate the preferential localization of cholesterol-and sphingomyelin-enriched microdomains in the collar band of the bud-neck interfaced with the donor membrane. The geometrical approach to the recapitulation of the dynamic membrane reorganization, resulting from the local radii of curvatures from nanometre-to-micrometre scales, offers important clues for understanding the active roles of the bud topography in the sorting and migration machinery of key signalling proteins involved in membrane budding.\n\nTY - JOUR\n\nT1 - Reconstituting ring-rafts in bud-mimicking topography of model membranes\n\nAU - Ryu, Yong Sang\n\nAU - Lee, In Ho\n\nAU - Suh, Jeng Hun\n\nAU - Park, Seung Chul\n\nAU - Oh, Soojung\n\nAU - Jordan, Luke R.\n\nAU - Wittenberg, Nathan J.\n\nAU - Oh, Sang Hyun\n\nAU - Jeon, Noo Li\n\nAU - Lee, Byoungho\n\nAU - Parikh, Atul N.\n\nAU - Lee, Sin Doo\n\nN1 - Funding Information: This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the government of Korea (MSIP; No. 2007-0054847).
