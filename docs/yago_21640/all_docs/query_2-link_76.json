        "text": "Dylan Mulvaney doesn‚Äôt want your pity. She wants solutions.\n\nThe trans actor and social media influencer posted a TikTok Thursday expressing her thoughts on the Bud Light fallout and how the company never reached out afterward.\n\n‚ÄúI took a brand deal with a company that I loved, and I posted a sponsored video to my page,‚Äù Mulvaney said, adding that the video resulted in intense bullying and transphobia. ‚ÄúAnd I was scared and I was scared of more backlash and I felt personally guilty for what transpired so I patiently waited for things to get better, but surprise, they haven‚Äôt really. And I was waiting for the brand to reach out to me, but they never did.‚Äù\n\nWhile Mulvaney kept her trademark cheerful, mild persona during the video, her words were blunt.\n\n@dylanmulvaney\n\nTrans people like beer too. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüçª\n\n‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Dylan Mulvaney\n\n‚ÄúFor a company to hire a trans person and then not publicly stand by them is worse in my opinion than not hiring a trans person at all,‚Äù Mulvaney said. ‚ÄúBecause it gives customers permission to be as transphobic and hateful as they want. And the hate doesn‚Äôt end with me it has serious and grave consequences for the rest of our community and, and you know, we‚Äôre customers too.‚Äù\n\nWhy it matters:\n\nBud Light selected Mulvaney due to her large audience. They knew that she was trans before they hired her. However, when Bud Light was attacked for partnering with her, they left her all alone to deal with the frightening fallout. Bud Light left Mulvaney personally and professionally during a time of crisis. They might try to sweep this moment under the rug, but the public ‚Äî on either side ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt easily forget.\n\nThe moment to find out if an influencer partnership is worth it or not should be before the partnership happens ‚Äì not in the middle of it. And especially not when a crisis arises. Bud Light didn‚Äôt distance themselves from Mulvaney because of anything she said or did. They left her because some of their base disliked who she is as a person. This is not Mulvaney‚Äôs fault ‚Äî it‚Äôs Bud Light‚Äôs for not doing their research in the first place and having a firm grasp on their audience.\n\nMulvaney‚Äôs valid feelings of abandonment and lack of response from Bud Light serve as a warning of what not to do with influencers. When you decide to connect with an influencer, don‚Äôt leave them when the public opinion shifts for the bad. A brand should stick by them in the good times and bad. Also, if there is a directional shift and you decide to move away from an influencer, let them know. Keep the lines of communication open so no one is in the dark.\n\nEditor‚Äôs Daily Reads:\n\nThe Supreme Court rejected affirmative action in a 6-3 ruling. The conservative-backed decision could significantly impact college admissions policies around the nation. The Supreme Court ‚Äúeffectively overruled a landmark affirmative action precedent,‚Äù per The New York Times. Justice Clarence Thomas said Asian American students are negatively impacted by affirmative action. ‚ÄúRace-based discrimination against Asian American students compels me‚Äù to support the ruling, he said. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the decision was ‚Äúprofoundly wrong‚Äù and ignoring racial inequality will not make it disappear.‚Äù Communicating about these changes at the high school and collegiate level to concerned students and parents will take prep and clear-cut answers on any fallout from this.\n\nThe World Health Organization‚Äôs cancer research arm said that aspartame sweetener is possibly a carcinogen. An official declaration will be made next month. Impacted companies in the food and beverage industry will have to find out how to address this ‚Äî will they keep the sweetener in their products and appeal to consumers on its safety or swap it for another?\n\nThe popular, longstanding National Geographic magazine laid off its last set of staff writers. The magazine‚Äôs most recent layoff cycle cut 17 editorial spots ‚Äì ranging from staff writers, its podcast staff and editors ‚Äì and were part of parent company Disney‚Äôs cuts.\n\nSherri Kolade is a writer at Ragan Communications.
