In case you just moved here from some remote backwater and didn't know, the\n\nand our nickname is the \"Beaver State.\"\n\nBruno has made Bud an industrious, bubbly sort. So it's only natural that he should get a little extra screen time in Webisodes made for the \"Grimm\" Web site.\n\nwith\n\nand\n\nNow there's a new clip up on the site, titled \"Meltdown: Deep Freeze.\" Apparently, this is supposed to be happening while the Scooby Gang were in the shipyard, on the trail of zombies, at the end of last season. That particular adventure unfortunately culminated in Nick being turned into a zombie. Or so the promos for Season 3, which airs Oct. 25, on NBC (8), are making us believe.\n\nBud gets a knock on his office door. It's\n\nand Sgt. Franco (Portland actor Robert Blanche). Seems there's been some strange activity in the area, Wu deadpans. When isn't there strange activity in the \"Grimm\" vision of Portland? Has Bud heard anything about it, Wu wonders? Bud gets a little flustered -- as usual -- and says his wife's been calling him about dinner, but otherwise there's nothing going on.\n\nWu takes his \"Dragnet\"-style, just-the-facts-mister leave, followed by Franco. Inside his workplace, Bud discovers a real reason to get flustered -- a zombie-like creature is breaking in, and going after the fridge fixer.\n\nIn a panic, Bud locks himself into a hiding place. Is it a refrigerated compartment? Unfortunately, his keys and his cell phone are locked outside, where the zombie is, trying to break down the locked door.\n\nWhich is where we leave our friendly neighborhood Eisbiber. How is he going to get out of this? Since the \"Grimm\" site has a headline over a photo of Bruno that reads,\n\n\"Wu vs. the Zombies,\"\n\nI have a feeling we'll be seeing the good Sergeant coming back for some zombie-fu action.\n\n-- Kristi Turnquist"
