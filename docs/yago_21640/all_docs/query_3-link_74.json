Will line up primarily at the Y-receiver spot, where he'll enter spring drills holding down the top line on the depth chart.\n\n2013 SEASON\n\nA main contributor at wide receiver for the Tigers with nine starts in 14 games ... Ended with career highs in receptions (26) and yards (361) ... Had 3 or more catches in five games, and closed with 3-catch outings against Auburn and Oklahoma State ... had two catches for 72 yards at No. 24 Ole Miss (Nov. 23), including a 60-yard reception ... tallied three catches for 43 yards in the 48-17 win at Kentucky (Nov. 9) ... made on eof the plays of the season when he took a lateral from QB Maty Mauk in the 4th quarter at Georgia, and threw a 40-yard TD pass to L'Damian Washington that keyed Mizzou's first road win over a top-10 ranked opponent since 1982 ... came away with one catch in the win vs. No. 22 Florida (Oct. 19), but was good enough for the opening touchdown in the game, a 20-yard strike from Maty Mauk ... ended up with a career-high four catches in the win vs. Murray State (Aug. 31).\n\n2012 SEASON\n\nSaw action in all 12 games, starting the final six contests of the year, and ended up with 10 catches for 231 yards and a touchdown ... his 23.1 yard per catch average was best among Tiger receivers ... caught multiple passes in games against Tennessee (two catches, 61 yards), Florida (2-26) and Georgia (2-17) ... had the extremely rare stat line against Vanderbilt of one reception for 101 yards and one touchdown ... his TD in that game came on an 85-yard bomb down the right sideline in the fourth quarter from QB Corbin Berkstresser, and earlier in the game, he picked up a fumble on a pass caught by a teammate, and he advanced that 16 yards forward past the point of the fumble, giving him 16 more receiving yards without an added reception.\n\n2011 SEASON\n\nSaw action in nine games on the season ... caught three passes in all for a total of 16 yards ... First collegiate reception came in his first game action, when he grabbed a 4-yard reception in the opener against Miami (Ohio) ... Later had one catch each against Western Illinois and Iowa State, with each one going for six yards.\n\n2010 SEASON\n\nRedshirt season at Mizzou.\n\nHIGH SCHOOL\n\nESPN.com ranked him as the nation's No. 63 wide receiver prospect ... ranked by Rivals.com as the nation's No. 67 wide receiver prospect, and by the same outlet as the No. 71 talent at any position out of the state of Texas ... was a prolific wide receiver playing in a spread-style offense, and helped lead his team to the state playoff quarterfinals in 2009 and a final record of 12-2 ... was an honorable mention All-State performer as a senior, when he caught 71 passes for 1,157 yards and 23 touchdowns in 2009 ... enjoyed an equally productive junior season in 2008, as he made 64 catches for 1,250 yards and a school-record 24 touchdowns ... high school coach - Joey Florence.\n\nPERSONAL\n\nParents - Larry Sasser & Jackie Cox-Spence ... chose Mizzou over Nebraska, Texas Tech, Arizona, Arizona State and Kansas, among others ... credits the family atmosphere at Mizzou as a major selling point, as well as the fact that he never felt pressured during the recruiting process.\n\nSASSER'S CAREER STATS"
