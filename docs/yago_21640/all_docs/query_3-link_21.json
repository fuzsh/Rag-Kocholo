        "text": "Maryland was early in getting in on local running back and outfielder Bud Coombs, and that held plenty of meaning as the Hyattsville (Md.) DeMatha standout narrowed down his school choices and ultimately made a decision.\n\nThe Terps offered nearly two years ago, and even though a position coaching change kept the 5-foot-10, 185-pound Coombs high on their board and stayed in contact.\n\nIt paid off Wednesday when Coombs announced his commitment to Maryland. He is the sixth member of the class.\n\nCoombs, who is also a standout outfielder and was offered by several schools, including Maryland, to play baseball, is coming off a big junior season in which he ran for more than 1,000 yards in helping DeMatha get to the WCAC title game.\n\nOne of his top performances was a 227-yard, three-touchdown performance in the WCAC semifinal win against Washington (D.C.) Gonzaga.\n\nHis sister, Melody, plays softball at Penn State.\n\nHere's everything you need to know:\n\nWHAT BUD COOMBS SAYS\n\n\"I'm going to Maryland,\" he said. \"I love the coaching staff for both sports and can tell they are invested in me. It feels like home. I grew up here my whole life and I'm comfortable here. They are building something special for both sports and I want to be a part of it.\"\n\nWHO ELSE WAS IN THE MIX?\n\nCoombs listed Texas A&M, Maryland, Alabama (baseball offer), Michigan and Indiana as his finalists, and baseball was part of his recruitment. He made a January visit to Alabama to check out both programs, and spent considerable time with the baseball coaching staff. However, when it came down to a decision, Maryland separated itself and had no equal in the process.\n\nWHERE BUD COOMBS RANKS AS A RECRUIT\n\nCoombs has a 247Sports grade of 87, which makes him the No. 17 player in Maryland and No. 56 running back in the nation. The industry-generated 247Sports Composite has Wilson as the No. 732 player in the class of 2025.\n\nHOW BUD COOMBS FITS WITH MARYLAND\n\nThe Terps did go far to land Coombs, who goes to school three miles from Maryland's football facility. He is the first running back in the class and he joins Bel Air (Md.) High's Julien Horton as in-state commits in the class. He is the sixth member of the class, and moves Maryland up 10 slots to No. 37 in the nation. The Terps are No. 10 in the Big Ten.\n\nWHAT WE THINK ABOUT BUD COOMBS\n\nCoombs is a multi-sport athlete with athleticism and vision, according to 247Sports scouting analyst Gabe Brooks.\n\n\"Urgent runner with naturally low center of gravity and instinctive style that finds holes and maximizes runs,\" Brooks said. \"Effective cutback threat who can stack cuts with second-level creativity. Knows how to shrink his target without sacrificing power. While capable of playing at a high pace, understands block-pressing and speed-changing nuances as methods to extend runs.\n\n\"Quick-footed in the hole with linear juice and jump-cutting athleticism. Recorded strong sophomore combine testing numbers that reflect in functional athleticism on the field. Also plays baseball. Still can squeeze a bit more out of the top gear. Displays encouraging contact balance but gets out over his feet occasionally.\""
