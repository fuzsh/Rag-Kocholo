        "text": "Hyattsville (Md.) DeMatha Catholic product Bud Coombs is an On300 recruit and the No. 23 running back in the 2025 cycle. He’s also one of the top baseball prospects in his class.\n\nCoombs has attracted the attention of baseball and football suitors, with Boston College, Duke, Maryland, and Virginia Tech offering him in both sports.\n\nAlabama is currently pursuing him just as a baseball prospect, and welcomed Coombs on campus back in January.\n\n“It was good,” Coombs told BamaOnLine of his Jan. 20 visit. “It was very beautiful up there and nice. I had a great time. Coaches showed me around everywhere. It was really nice. I liked it.”\n\nThe connection between Coombs and the staff goes back to when head coach Robert Vaughn was at Maryland. Coombs, the No. 9 junior in the state of Maryland, has developed a strong relationship with the coaches.\n\n“Great, great. I talk with them all the time,” Coombs said. “I love them, man. They’re cool. They’re from Maryland just like me, so we have a good bond with them. They’ve been recruiting me for a while. When they went to Bama, they were still recruiting me.”\n\nCoombs, who was accompanied by his parents on the visit, is being recruited by the Tide as a center fielder. The 5-foot-9, 170-pound prospect outlined the message that he and his family received last month.\n\n“We love you. They want me here,” Coombs said of Alabama’s message. “I can feel that they want me. Just that they’re making it seem like this is the place I’ve got to be. It’s a great place, and they’re doing a good job.”\n\nAlabama made a great impression on Coombs and his family, and is a legitimate contender in his recruitment.\n\n“My interest level is very high,” Coombs said. “I love the competition, of course. The SEC is the best you can get. I love that so much. I just love how they carry themselves up there.”\n\nAs of right now, Coombs does not possess an offer from Bama’s football program. He’s received mail from them and some interaction on social media, but not an offer to this point.\n\nIf Kalen DeBoer and his staff dipped into his recruitment, would there be reciprocated interest?\n\n“Definitely. I definitely could see myself there,” Coombs replied. “There’s a lot to love. I love how they win. I love how they’re coached. It seems like they’re very passionate about what they do.”\n\nLooking ahead, Coombs is hoping to make his decision sometime in the spring. Ideally, after taking some visits, Coombs will be committed within the next three months.\n\nHe made it clear that he would like the opportunity to play both in the diamond and on the gridiron at the next level.\n\n“I would go with the interest in both,” Coombs said. “They’ve got to like me for both sports. No half in, half out. Just 100 percent in both sports they have to like me.”\n\nCoombs also discussed the factors he’s considering the most ahead of his decision.\n\n“Mostly, the interest level in me. How bad do they want me?” Coombs said. “I want to feel like I’m a big priority for them and that they need me, you know what I mean? Not one of the guys they have. I want them to treat me like their guy.”\n\nA return visit to Alabama in the spring is on the table for Coombs.\n\nNot a member, Alabama fans? Join BOL today!"
