        "text": "Navy SEAL Training Stages.\n\nBefore becoming Navy SEALs, candidates are put through some of the most mentally challenging and physically demanding training in the world. Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training, or BUD/S, is designed to find and develop men of the strongest character who give everything they have to accomplish their mission and support the men on their team.\n\nStage 1: : NAVAL SPECIAL WARFARE PREPARATORY SCHOOL A.K.A. BUD/S PREP\n\nThe training curriculum begins at Naval Special Warfare Preparatory School in Great Lakes, Illinois.\n\nThe two-month training period begins with a Physical Screening Test. The goal: Improve the candidates’ physical readiness for the rigorous activity they will face at Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL ( BUD/S ).\n\nThe Prep School ends with a modified Physical Screening Test ( PST ). The test is a 1000-meter swim, push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups and a four-mile run.\n\nThe minimum standards for this expanded test are as follows:\n\n1000-meter swim – with fins ( 20 minutes or under )\n\nPush-ups: at least 70 ( Two-minute time limit )\n\nPull-ups: at least 10 ( No time limit )\n\nSit-ups: at least 60 ( Two-minute time limit )\n\nFour-mile run – with shoes + pants ( 31 minutes or under )\n\nCandidates who don’t pass the longer, more intense test are removed from training and reclassified to other jobs in the Navy.\n\nUse the PST Calculator to enter your most recent ( PST ) scores. The PST Calculator will compare your scores to actual ( BUD/S ) entry level scores.\n\nThe Naval Special Warfare Preparatory School utilizes Recruit Training Command pools, indoor and outdoor tracks and other facilities in and around Naval Station Great Lakes. Its staff and curriculum are under the Naval Special Warfare Center.\n\nStage 2: Basic Orientation – An Introduction To BUD/S\n\n3 Weeks | San Diego, California\n\nBUD/S Orientation is a three-week course that introduces candidates to Coronado, the Naval Special Warfare Center and the BUD/S lifestyle. During Orientation, Navy SEAL instructors introduce candidates to BUD/S physical training, the obstacle course and other unique training aspects. This part of training is designed to prepare candidates for Day One of First Phase.\n\nStage 3: First Phase – Basic Conditioning\n\n7 Weeks | San Diego, California\n\nFirst Phase, the basic conditioning phase, is seven weeks long and develops the class in physical training, water competency and mental tenacity while continuing to build teamwork. Each week, the class is expected to do more running, swimming and calisthenics than the week before, and each man’s performance is measured by a four-mile timed run, a timed obstacle course, and a two-mile timed swim.\n\nIn addition to physical training, the class also learns how to conduct hydrographic survey operations.\n\nBecause of its particularly challenging requirements, many candidates begin questioning their decision to come to BUD/S during First Phase, with a significant number deciding to Drop on Request (DOR).\n\nHistorically, candidates who have composite PST scores below 800 are three times more likely to succeed than the average student. Most importantly, candidates who have made a full commitment to their goal of becoming a SEAL and those who decide ahead of time that quitting is not an option, regardless of how challenging the training becomes, dramatically increase their chances.\n\nThe fourth week of training is known as Hell Week. In this grueling five-and-a-half day stretch, each candidate sleeps only about four total hours but runs more than 200 miles and does physical training for more than 20 hours per day. Successful completion of Hell Week truly defines those candidates who have the commitment and dedication required of a SEAL. Hell Week is the ultimate test of a man’s will and the class’s teamwork.\n\nStage 4: Second Phase – Combat Diving\n\n7 Weeks | San Diego, California\n\nSecond Phase, the combat diving phase, lasts seven weeks. This phase introduces underwater skills that are unique to Navy SEALs.\n\nDuring this phase, candidates become basic combat swimmers and learn open and closed-circuit diving. Successful Second Phase candidates demonstrate a high level of comfort in the water and the ability to perform in stressful and often uncomfortable environments. candidates who are not completely comfortable in the water often struggle to succeed.\n\nStage 5: Third Phase – Land Warfare Training\n\n7 Weeks | San Diego, California\n\nThis phase is seven weeks long and involves basic weapons, demolitions, land navigation, patrolling, rappelling, marksmanship and small-unit tactics.\n\nThe second half of training is on San Clemente Island, about 60 miles from Coronado. On the island, the class practices the skills they learned in Third Phase.\n\nMen who make it to Third Phase have demonstrated extraordinary commitment to becoming SEALs. They graduate BUD/S as Special Warfare Operators but have a long way to go before pinning on a Trident and becoming a SEAL."
