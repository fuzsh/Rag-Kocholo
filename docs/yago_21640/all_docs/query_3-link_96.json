        "text": "Milkes made a statement to the players by hiring a no-nonsense manager in Dave Bristol, but at the same time made a statement to doubters.\n\n“I want to assure the baseball world and Pacific Northwest fans that this will be a stable organization and we can expect to see Major League Baseball here for many years to come,” Milkes told reporters at Bristol’s introductory press conference.\n\nAt the same time, an auto industry businessman in the Milwaukee area was sensing an opportunity. Allen H. “Bud” Selig, a child of Eastern European immigrants, was busy carving out a name for himself in baseball circles. He attended minor league Milwaukee Brewers games at Borchert Field while a youngster, his mother encouraging his interest in the sport. When the National League’s Braves abandoned Boston for a new stadium in Milwaukee, Selig went to work.\n\n“(When the Braves) went public in 1963, I was the largest public shareholder,” Selig recounted in a 2011 interview with the University of Wisconsin alumni magazine. “But I didn’t control the fate of the Braves. I certainly would have (kept them in Milwaukee) if I could.”\n\nThe Braves left for Atlanta following the 1965 season, and County Stadium would lose 81 home games per year. Selig did not wait for the team to split town to take action. He and other investors created an organization called Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club, Inc., which, that August, applied to National League president Warren Giles for an expansion franchise beginning in 1966. The application was rejected that winter, largely due to Wisconsin’s anti-trust lawsuit against the Braves and the National League, as well as the political atmosphere in Milwaukee.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chicago White Sox games had been successful. More than 240,000 paying customers had attended the games at County Stadium, and Selig was feted by fans before the August 26 game against Detroit. Former Braves star Eddie Mathews, playing with the eventual world champion Tigers in his final season, also was honored. The Allyns scheduled 11 regular season games in Milwaukee for 1969.\n\nPerhaps giving a dig to baseball’s senior circuit, Selig noted in January 1969 that “the American League came to us as friends when we needed friends.”\n\nMeanwhile, one of the American League’s new entries, the Seattle Pilots remained within striking distance of .500 in the early going in 1969. By the time Seattle visited Milwaukee to play Chicago on June 16, 1969, both clubs were neck-to-neck in the standings, the Pilots at 26-32 and the Sox at 24-32. Chicago jumped out to an 8-1 lead and Billy Wynne went the distance for his first career win, as the White Sox coasted to an 8-3 victory.\n\nWho knew that Milwaukee fans would be watching the ballclub which would play at County Stadium the following season?\n\nThe situation was not so rosy for the Pilots later in 1969. Frequent player moves and attendance regularly falling well short of Sick’s Stadium’s 19,800 capacity did not help the club’s ledgers. Losses on the field mounted as quickly as losses off the field. The team went 15-42 between July and August.\n\nOn Aug. 25, with the team on a 10-game skid, the tenure of Schultz was already questioned.\n\n“Some say a manager who is loved by players and fans alike should be retained,” Pilots GM Milkes told reporters. “Well, I’m not conducting a love-in – I’m running a major-league baseball team.”\n\nSchultz’s players snapped the losing streak the following day, edging the Orioles, but promptly lost their next six games.\n\nRumors circulating in late August were that the Pilots might fly to the Dallas-Fort Worth area for the 1970 season, but Texas millionaire and Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt, who had been seeking a major league team of his own, denied those reports.\n\nOn Friday, Sept. 5, 1969, the mayor of Seattle brought the hammer down on the Pilots, threatening to evict the team from Sick’s Stadium if it did not pay $600,000 in rent by Monday, Sept. 8. Mayor Floyd Miller, following a meeting with an American League lawyer, relented on Sunday, allowing the team two more weeks to come up with the rent and a $150,000 surety bond. Meanwhile, Pilots brass maintained that the city failed to live up to his end of the deal by not bringing Sick’s Stadium up to American League standards.\n\nBy late September, Hunt presented Daley, Pilots chairman of the board, with an offer to purchase the club. Yet Daley rejected the offer, maintaining that the franchise would remain in Seattle. After the season’s end, though, it was known that the Pilots were for sale and listening to all potential suitors. Seattle president Dewey Soriano acknowledged the team lost over $300,000 in its first season, and Daley gave the city and its fans another campaign to prove themselves.\n\nBut a new possibility was arising – a move to Milwaukee.\n\nOn Oct. 20, 1969, Chicago Daily News editor John P. Carmichael said the Pilots would move to Milwaukee for the 1970 season, play as the Milwaukee Brewers, and be owned by a Milwaukee-based group. He claimed that “Milwaukee has virtually sewed up the franchise.” The next day, Leonard Koppett of The New York Times said that owners meeting in Chicago would consider the “final steps” of moving the club to Milwaukee.\n\nAs the Pilots were making managerial changes in late November, the club hoped it found its new owner in a group led by local businessman Fred Danz, whose majority control would be decided upon by the American League owners in December. Not yet receiving approval, Danz met with new mayor Wes Uhlman and agreed to provide the city with a $600,000 letter of credit and $150,000 performance bond. There was a glitch, though: The money that Danz had hoped to receive to purchase the franchise was not forthcoming, and Daley and the Soriano brothers would remain in charge. Needing to raise $3.5 million to remain afloat, the team was given until Jan. 22, 1970, by the American League to make good on its finances. Missing the deadline, Mayor Uhlman threatened legal action if the Pilots left Seattle; Mayor Tommy Vandergriff of Arlington, Texas, offered to expand and upgrade minor league Turnpike Stadium to bring it up to major league specifications; and Hunt continued to seek the franchise.\n\nAll the while, Bud Selig and his Milwaukee investors remained in waiting, as the status of the Pilots was up in the air.\n\nIn February, as the Pilots players and baseball operations staff prepared to descend upon Tempe, Ariz., for Spring Training, the American League decided to keep the club under its current ownership and advanced it $650,000. Roy Hamey, former general manager of the Yankees, was selected by the American League to oversee the Pilots, though Milkes would remain in his role as general manager.\n\nSeattle’s ticket sales were not going as well as club officials hoped they would, yet Milkes said the notion of a potential Milwaukee move were “absolutely ridiculous.”\n\nTommy Harper, entering his ninth season in the majors and owner of a league-leading 73 stolen bases for the Pilots in 1969, said players do feel the effects of such uncertainty.\n\n“Certainly we’re aware of the financial problem,” he told the Chicago Defender. “It’s like an employer being in trouble, the employees have to be a little disturbed.”\n\nHarper also wished the team would get a bit of good news from the press.\n\n“Just because we’re a last place team, [the press doesn’t] come around,” he lamented. “We need the publicity. I mean good publicity, we’ve had enough of the other kind.”\n\nSome good news came the next week in the form that the Pilots owners reached an agreement where the Milwaukee group headed by Selig and Judge Robert Cannon would purchase Seattle for $9.5 million. The franchise would shift to Wisconsin for the 1970 season.\n\nThe state of Washington and the city of Seattle, however, dampened the enthusiasm by filing a temporary restraining order, preventing the sale and the move of the franchise. By mid-March, the team even lost the ability to use its training facility, having “failed to comply with the agreements for use of the facilities.” The facility’s owner ended up allowing day-to-day usage, even though the club was behind $500,000 to the facility.\n\nOn March 19, citing debts of $7.4 million, the Pilots’ owners requested the team be sold to Milwaukee under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. Six days later, a referee in a federal bankruptcy court set aside the restraining order filed in King County, Wash.\n\nAs Pilots players scrambled to make living arrangements in Milwaukee and the team’s equipment remained in limbo – it had been scheduled to go to Seattle, the matter remained the courts until the evening of March 31, when the bankruptcy court ruled that Daley and the Soriano brothers could sell their franchise to Selig’s Milwaukee group for $10.8 million. The purchase agreement signed by the Milwaukee investors on March 8 would have expired at 10 am on April 1.\n\nCiting the community’s response to the Brewers’ arrival as “absolutely staggering,” Selig felt the “feeling has been almost unbelievable. I truly believe the country will see something here that is very, very interesting to watch.”\n\nOpening Day, scheduled for April 7, would remain in place, just at County Stadium instead of Sick’s Stadium.\n\nFans lined up for season tickets – over 1,000 were sold on the first day of sales.\n\n“The response has not let up – and it’s even more today,” Selig said.\n\nSeveral members of the team’s front office personnel also made the move. Milkes remained in place as general manager through the 1970 season. Gabe Paul, Jr., also came from Seattle to handle stadium operations in Milwaukee. Bristol would continue as manager.\n\nEven Daley moved with the club. On April 5, the Brewers announced the names of the team’s seven new investors – and his name was among those on the list.\n\nHowever, Selig remained at the forefront and would continue to do so until 1998, when he sold his stakes in the club in order to become Commissioner of Baseball on a full-time basis.\n\nThe Brewers finished only one game better than the Pilots did in 1969, but it was good enough for fourth place instead of last. The team also drew over 150,000 more fans to County Stadium than the Pilots did to Sick’s Stadium. Three years later, they surpassed the one million mark.\n\nThanks to the efforts of Selig and later ownership groups, 47 years later and now playing at Miller Park, the Brewers remain a Milwaukee icon."
