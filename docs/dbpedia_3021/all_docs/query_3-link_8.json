        "text": "Amazon is listing releases of the Blue Seed and Elemental Gelade anime series from Discotek Media. Both standard edition Blu-ray Disc sets are listed for December 18.\n\nMedia OCD's Justin Sevakis confirmed that he is working on the Blue Seed release for Discotek. The release includes all 26 episodes of the original series, three original video anime episodes, the ADV English dub, omake shorts, and a behind-the-scenes special.\n\nADV Films described the story:\n\nThe countdown to extinction begins when the evil shape-shifting monsters known as the Aragami make their grand play to gain control of the Earth. Humanity's only chance for survival rests on the shoulders of Momiji, a young girl carrying an unborn Aragami in her chest, and Mamoru, a servant of the Aragami rebelling against his masters in order to ensure mankind's survival.\n\nThe anime, an adaptation of Yuzo Takada's manga of the same name, aired in Japan from 1994 to 1995. ADV Films released the series on VHS with an English dub, and later rereleased the series on DVD and subtitled VHS.\n\nAccording to Amazon's listing, Discotek's release of Elemental Gelade will include all 26 episodes of the series and both the Japanese and English dubs.\n\nGeneon Entertainment described the story:\n\nCou, the bumbling rookie of the \"Red Lynx\" sky pirates, wakes Ren from suspended animation and discovers the adventure of a lifetime! At first glance, Ren seems shy and defenseless, but she holds within her a power that many will kill to possess. Cou vows to protect Ren on her journey to the mythical paradise of Edel Garden, a journey which will reveal new friends and dangerous enemies.\n\nThe anime based on Mayumi Azuma's manga premiered in 2005, and Geneon Entertainment initially released the series in North America from 2006-2007. FUNimation Entertainment rereleased the series in 2008.\n\nSources: Amazon (link 2) via WTK"
