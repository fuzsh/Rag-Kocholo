This reliable old variety produces 15-30 lb. fruits on vigorous vines with sweet, bright orange and fine textured flesh.\n\nSquash Blue Hubbard\n\nSquash Blue Hubbard . One of the finest, most reliable and delicious storage winter squash varieties available. This reliable old variety produces 15-30 lb. fruits on vigorous vines with sweet, bright orange and fine textured flesh. The fruit has excellent storage qualities; flesh is best baked. Blue Hubbard Winter Squash can be stored for a long time. 110 days sowing to maturity.\n\nCultivation Advice Squash Blue Hubbard\n\nA sunny spot protected from strong winds is essential.\n\nThe soil must be well drained and rich in humus, the more the better.\n\nMany winter Squash / Pumpkins like to sprawl out and need plenty of space.\n\nVining Squash / Pumpkins require a larger area to run,\n\nwhilst semi-vining and bush varieties of winter squash / courgette can be well contained.\n\nFor an early start (Mid / Late Apr)\n\nplace a single seed edgeways 1/2inch deep in seed compost in a 3inch pot.\n\nThe critical part is temperature, these need at least 65F continuous soil temperature\n\n(preferably more to maximise germination rates) until germinated,\n\nso a propagator, well heated greenhouse or airing cupboard is ideal\n\nKeep the soil moist â€“ water copiously around the plants, not over them.\n\nKeep weed free to allow air circulation.\n\nOnce the fruits start to swell feed every 14 days with a tomato type fertilizer,\n\nthese are greedy plants.\n\nLimit larger fruiting varieties to 2-3 fruits."
