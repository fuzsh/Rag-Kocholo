        "text": "(9 Seed) UTEP To Battle (8 Seed) WKU Wednesday At 2023 C-USA Championships Presented By TotalCare\n\n3/6/2023 3:53:00 PM\n\nGame Notes In PDF Format\n\nOPENING TIP\n\nThe No. 9 seeded UTEP men's basketball team (14-17) will lock up against No. 8 seeded WKU (16-15) in the opening round of the 2023 Conference USA Championships presented by TotalCare on Court \"A\" at 4:30 p.m. MT/5:30 pm. CT at The Star in Frisco, Texas, on Wednesday. Mattress Firm is the Presenting Sponsor of UTEP Men's Basketball. The victor will advance to face top seed and 2023 C-USA regular-season champion (RV) Florida Atlantic on \"Court A\" at 4:30 p.m. MT/5:30 p.m. CT Thursday. The Miners enter on a positive note after knocking off fourth-place Middle Tennessee, 77-65, in their regular-season finale on \"Senior Day\" on March 4. It marked the fourth consecutive \"Senior Day\" win for the Orange and Blue. The Hilltoppers went 1-1 last week, slipping past UTEP at the Don Haskins Center, 73-68, on March 2 before being trounced, 67-33, at second-place North Texas on March 4. This is the third meeting on the season between the programs, with WKU also previously posting a five-point win at home (74-69) on Feb. 4. It is the first match-up between the Miners and Toppers at the C-USA Championships. UTEP is 1-2 all time as a No. 9 seed, with all three contests occurring when it was a member of the WAC (1996 & 2003). The Orange and Blue are 3-4 in the first round of league tournaments, including 1-0 under head coach Joe Golding. Last season, the (4W) Miners knocked off (5E) Old Dominion, 74-64, in the opening round before bowing out to (1E) Middle Tennessee in OT, 66-59, in the quarterfinals. The contest against WKU is the first on a neutral site this season for UTEP while the Toppers compiled a record of 2-1 in neutral-site tilts in 2022-23. Jon Teicher (42nd year) and Steve Yellen (20th year) will be on the call on \"The Home of UTEP Basketball\" 600 ESPN El Paso. It will also stream nationwide on ESPN+, with Ron Thulin (PXP) and Colin Boddicker (analyst) handling the broadcast.\n\nUTEP IN THE CONFERENCE TOURNAMENT\n\nUTEP is 41-31 all time in conference tournament play (includes a forfeit against Hawaii in the 1996 WAC Tournament. The Miners won the WAC Tournament in 1984, 1986, 1989, 1990 and 2005. They have 12 total appearances in the championship contest, including a pair (2010, 2011) since joining C-USA.\n\nUTEP IN THE C-USA TOURNAMENT\n\nUTEP is 14-16 in C-USA Tournament games, including going 1-1 last year to secure its first victory in the event since the 2017 tournament. It was also the initial triumph at the event since it moved to The Star in Frisco, Texas. The Miners advanced to the semifinals in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017 and the finals in 2010 and 2011. The Orange and Blue will be vying to post triumphs in consecutive years at the league's pinnacle event for the first time since an eight-year stretch (2010 through 2017).\n\nSERIES HISTORY: WKU LEADS, 8-1\n\nWKU leads the series, 8-1, and has won six straight contests against the Miners. The Toppers claimed both meetings this year, with each decided by five points. WKU held off UTEP, 74-69, in Bowling Green, Ky., on Feb. 4 while slipping past the Orange and Blue, 73-68, at the Haskins Center on March 2. Prior to this season, the two programs had not faced each other more than once in a campaign. The match-ups in 2022-23 were also the first between the foes in three years. UTEP's lone win in the series came in OT in front of a capacity crowd as part of the 50-year celebration of the Miners winning the 1966 NCAA Championship vs. Kentucky, 72-65.\n\nGET TO KNOW WKU\n\nWKU went 16-15 in the regular season, including 8-12 in league play, to garner the No. 8 seed in the 2023 Conference USA Championships presented by TotalCare. The Toppers had been predicted to finish in second place in the league's preseason poll and even received a first-place vote. Dayvion McKnight, Emmanuel Akot and Jamarion Sharp were all Preseason All C-USA team selections and should have a chance at garnering some 2023 C-USA Postseason accolades as well. The Hilltoppers were 2-4 over their final six games, but one of those wins came at the expense of the Miners, 73-68, at the Don Haskins Center on March 2. That allowed WKU to complete the season sweep with the Orange and Blue, with each contest decided by five points. WKU accounts for 72.0 points per game (sixth C-USA), which is helped by it committing only 11.6 turnovers per contest (second C-USA/81st NCAA). McKnight sets the tone from a scoring standpoint with 16.5 ppg (fifth C-USA). Akot (10.1 ppg) is also in double figures while four other active players contribute at least 7.0 ppg. The Toppers shoot the 3-point shot well (36.5-fourth C-USA/64th NCAA), in addition to dishing out 12.8 assists per game (fifth C-USA). They allow 70.6 ppg (seventh C-USA), but points in the paint are at a premium with the 7-5 Sharp leading the country in both total blocked shots (127) and blocks per game (4.23). That helps WKU sit atop C-USA and rank fifth nationally with 5.4 blocks per game. They are second-to-last in the league in rebounding margin (-1.9-280th NCAA) but won the battle of the boards in both tilts against the Miners this season. They are also 10th in C-USA at 3-point percentage defense (36.2-310th), something UTEP took advantage of in each of the games in the regular season by making 19 combined treys vs. the Toppers. Notable university alumni include Romeo Crennel (former head coach of the Cleveland Browns & KC Chiefs), the late Duncan Hines (pioneer of restaurant ratings for travelers) and the late Cordell Hull (Secretary of State under FDR\n\nLAST TIME OUT: at UTEP 77, MIDDLE TENNESSEE 65 (3/4/23)\n\nA season-high (vs. DI opponents) five different players posted double-digit scoring efforts on the way to UTEP knocking off fourth-place Middle Tennessee, 77-65, in front of 4,044 fans on \"Senior Day\" on March. 4 Fittingly senior Shamar Givance tied for the team lead with 14 points, with Calvin Solomon (14 points), Ze'Rik Onyema (13 points), Otis Frazier III (12 points) and Carlos Lemus (career-high 11 points) joining him in double figures UTEP led for nearly 34 minutes of action, including being up by as many as 17 (58-41) in the second half, and it exited the Don Haskins Center for the final time of the season to a standing ovation from the crowd.\n\nHOT SHOOTING DAY\n\nUTEP nailed 51.9 percent from the floor against MT on March 4, marking its fourth-best percentage on the season. The Miners also moved to 7-1 this year when making at least 49.0 percent from the floor.\n\nQUALITY SHOOTING IN ALL THREE FACETS\n\nUTEP finished better than 50 percent in both overall shooting (51.9, 27-52) and 3-point shooting (53.3, 8-15) while surpassing 80 percent (season-high 83.3 percent, 15-18) at the charity stripe. It marked the first time since the 2016-17 season that the Miners went better than 50/50/80 in those areas with at least 10 attempts in each category. That year UTEP was 67.3 percent overall (35-52), 63.6 percent on 3-pointers (7-11) and 86.7 (13-15) from the line in a 90-76 win at FIU on Feb. 25, 2017.\n\nBOMBS AWAY PAST TWO GAMES\n\nUTEP has nailed 18 total 3-pointers the past two games, going 10-20 (50.0 percent) vs. WKU (March 2) and 8-15 (53.3 percent) vs. MT (March 4.). It's the first time this season that UTEP has sunk at least eight 3-pointers in back-to-back contests. Last year, it did so in each contest of its six-game league winning streak.\n\nACCURATE FROM DISTANCE\n\nUTEP has made at least 50 percent of its 3-pointers in back-to-back games (min. 10 attempts) for the first time since a three-contest streak during the 2017-18 campaign. That year, UTEP was 63.2 percent (12-19) vs. Rice (Dec. 30, 2017), 11-20 (55.0) at Southern Miss (Jan. 4, 2018) and 63.6 (14-22) at LA Tech (Jan. 6, 2018).\n\nMORE FROM 3-POINT RANGE\n\nUTEP has hit at least eight 3-pointers in two straight and three of the past four contests. The Miners had three such games (vs. DI opponents) over the first 27 tilts of the campaign prior to the recent hot streak.\n\nPROGRESS ON D\n\nUTEP held MT to 42.9 percent from the floor, which was the lowest shooting percentage by a Miner opponent since keeping then No. 24 FAU to 42.6 percent on Jan. 21, 2023.\n\nCLOSING IN ON SINGLE-SEASON SCHOOL RECORD FOR STEALS\n\nUTEP enters the 2023 C-USA Tournament presented by TotalCare with 283 steals, aided by 11 last time out vs. MT on March 4. The school standard is 288 (2009-10) while the 1986-87 team holds second place at 284. The Miners are averaging 9.1 steals per game (first C-USA/ninth NCAA) and need five against WKU on Wednesday to tie the standard and six to set a program single-season record.\n\nTWO PLAYERS WITH 60+ STEALS IN SAME SEASON FOR SECOND TIME\n\nCalvin Solomon (63 steals) and Shamar Givance (62 steals) make this year's team the second in program history to have multiple players with 60+ thefts on a campaign. It also occurred in 1986-87 with Hall of Famer Tim Hardaway (68) and the late, great Jeep Jackson (63). Solomon is currently tied for sixth on UTEP's single-season school records for steals while Givance is alone in seventh. Randy Culpepper (67, 2008-09) is in fifth place.\n\nTALKING 2.0 STEALS PER GAME\n\nCalvin Solomon (2.03 steals per game) and Shamar Givance (2.0 steals per game) have a chance to become the third and fourth players, respectively, in program history to average at least 2.0 steals per contest in a season. If they can both finish above that figure, this year's team would be the first in school annals to boast multiple players at 2.0 spg or better. Naismith Hall of Famer Tim Hardaway accomplished the feat three times in his career (2.82, 1988-89, 2.41-1987-88 & 2.19-1986-87). Randy Culpepper (2.03-2010-11) is the only other player in program history to average at least 2.0 steals in a season.\n\nON CUSP OF TOP FIVE FOR TURNOVERS FORCED\n\nUTEP has forced 526 turnovers in 2022-23, putting it on the verge of cracking the school's single-season top-five list. Fifth place is currently held by the 2004-05 team (529). With four giveaways forced against WKU, the Miners will take over fifth place. Fourth place belongs to the 2008-09 squad (544) while the 1986-87 (551) unit occupies third on the list.\n\nPRACTICALLY EVEN\n\nUTEP has scored 2125 points this year while allowing 2119. The closest the Miners have come to being even on a season since 1947-48 was a two-point differential in 2011-12 (2021-2019).\n\nSOLOMON STREAKING\n\nCalvin Solomon has hit double figures in six straight contests. That is a campaign long for the Houston native. It is the second-longest streak of his career. He had an eight-tilt stretch while competing with SFA.\n\nGOOD ADJUSTMENT AT GUARDING THE 3\n\nUTEP has given up a total of 10 three pointers total the past two games, with WKU and MT combining to shoot 10-31 (32.2 percent) last week. The Miners had allowed 32 treys the four contests prior to the adjustments, with those four opponents nailing a combined 32-77 (41.6 percent) over the stretch.\n\nGOTTA REGROUP ON GIVEAWAYS\n\nFor the second time this season, the Orange and Blue have had at least 19 turnovers in consecutive contests. UTEP had 19 miscues against both WKU (March 2) and vs. MT (March 4). The Miners did, however, harass the Blue Raiders into 19 giveaways and the Toppers into 17.\n\nTHAT'S MORE LIKE IT\n\nUTEP was held to 33.3 percent shooting at (RV) FAU on Feb. 25, which was just the fifth time in (then) 29 contests that it failed to connect on at least 40 percent from the floor. The Miners have reverted to form the past two times out, including shooting their fourth-best percentage (51.9) in the win vs. MT on March 4. That was helped by going 8-15 (53.3) from distance.\n\nWIRE-TO-WIRE WIN\n\nThe Miners went wire-to-wire at FIU (Feb. 23), marking the second time they had done so in a four-game stretch. UTEP also never trailed in its 77-66 win at UTSA on Feb. 11. It now has four wire-to-wire victories on the season, previously accomplishing the feat vs. non-Division I opponents Northern New Mexico College (Dec. 3) and Sul Ross State (Nov. 15).\n\nIF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED, TRY AGAIN\n\nUTEP has won the second-chance points category in 14 of the past 16 contests, sporting a +91 differential (202-111) during the stretch.\n\nBREAK OUT THE BROOMS\n\nUTEP'S win at FIU on Feb. 23 completed a true season sweep (home and road) of the Panthers for the first time since the 2016-17 season, which was also their last victory in Miami. It marked the second sweep in league play for the Miners, who also won both match-ups against UTSA. It was the second straight season that UTEP had swept the Roadrunners, which is something that hadn't happened in the series since the 2013-14 and 2014-15 campaigns.\n\nGET IT TO Z\n\nZe'Rik Onyema has hit double figures in six of the past seven games, including tallying 13 points on a hot 6-7 shooting last time out against MT on March 4. He has enjoyed two separate surges of five straight efforts with 10+ points, doing so over the first five contests of the campaign and down the stretch in league action.\n\nCRASHING THE OFFENSIVE BOARDS\n\nUTEP has pulled down 10+ offensive rebounds in 18 of the past 21 games and 25 times total on the season. That's the most since racking up 30 such tilts (in 37 total contests) in 2008-09. There was a streak of seven straight, which was the longest such run since posting eight in a row (twice) in 2008-09. UTEP's 11.5 offensive rebounds per game are second in C-USA and 64th in the country. That figure moved to 12.1 orpg during the 20 league contests, which was also second in the league. Overall, Calvin Solomon is ninth in C-USA with 67 total offensive boards.\n\nPOUND THE PAINT\n\nUTEP compiled 42 points in the paint against UAB (Feb. 16), marking the seventh game this season with at least 40 down low (five with 45+). The Miners' high against a DI opponent this year was a 56-point effort at Rice on Jan. 14. UTEP was just shy of that figure (38) at FIU recently on Feb. 23.\n\nALL-AROUND EFFORTS\n\nCalvin Solomon paced UTEP in points (game-high 16), rebounding (six) and assists (three) against Charlotte on Feb. 9, making him the first Miner to lead the squad in the three major stat categories since Souley Boum at LA Tech on Feb. 17, 2022. Helping his scoring effort was going 8-9 at the charity stripe. That feat was duplicated recently by Shamar Givance, who racked up a season-high 22 points, eight rebounds and a career-high tying 10 assists at FIU on Feb. 23.\n\nGOTTA KEEP THEM BELOW 70\n\nUTEP is an impressive 13-5 on the year when holding the opposition to fewer than 70 points in a game. It is 1-12 when failing to do so, with the lone win on the campaign in the situation coming at FIU (87-82) on Feb. 23.\n\nMr. AND-1\n\nCalvin Solomon had an old-fashioned 3-point play at (RV) FAU on Feb. 25, elevating his total to a team-high eight on the season. Otis Frazier III (six), Tae Hardy (five) and Kevin Kalu (four) also have been active in the old-fashioned 3-point plays. Frazier III had a pair last time out against MT while Hardy also had one.\n\nA STRANGE TREND\n\nUTEP went 5-2 in nonconference play when tallying at least 70 points, but it was 4-4 in the situation during C-USA action. The Miners are, though, 3-1 in the scenario the past four times they've accomplished the feat.\n\nCOMEBACK KIDS\n\nUTEP has had to overcome big first-half deficits to pull out the win in two of its six league triumphs this year. The Miners dug themselves a 19-6 deficit eight minutes into the contest at Charlotte (Jan. 16). UTEP recovered and closed the half on a 27-8 surge to take a lead it would never relinquish to match the second-biggest comeback under head coach Joe Golding. That rally for the win came on the heels from fighting back from a 14-point deficit (19-5, 11:57 1H) against UTSA. Similar to the game at Charlotte, UTEP countered with a 25-6 surge to take the lead for good in the biggest comeback under Golding and largest in three years. In the 2019-20 campaign, the Miners overcame a 19-point differential to knock off Rice (68-62, Feb. 22, 2020).\n\nBEAT UP ON EACH OTHER\n\nConference USA team beat up on each other during the 2022-23 C-USA slate. Only (RV) FAU (18-2) and North Texas (16-4) finished with fewer than five losses and league action. UAB (14-6) and Middle Tennessee (11-9) were the lone others with winning marks in league play. The other seven teams finished below .500.\n\nSIMPLY THE BEST\n\nUTEP tops Conference USA in steals per game (9.1-ninth NCAA), turnovers forced per game (17.0-10th NCAA), average home attendance (4,552) and overall home attendance (81,941).\n\nGOING STREAKING\n\nShamar Givance (93) and Calvin Solomon (86) both have scoring streaks of at least 80 games. The next longest active streak for a Miner is Tae Hardy at 31.\n\nNO QUIT IN THIS GROUP\n\nUTEP has three wins on the season when trailing by at least eight points, including coming back from 13+ points in two of them. The Miners posted a 14-point come-from-behind win against UTSA (Jan. 11), their largest rally in three years. They fought back from down 13 in a triumph at Charlotte (Jan. 16) and overcame an eight-point differential in a win against NC A&T (Dec. 21). UTEP erased a 15-point deficit before succumbing in OT to Rice (Dec. 31), while twice fighting back from 10 down with under 10 minutes left in a 60-58 setback at LA Tech. It also wiped out a nine-point differential to lead by one with six seconds left before falling, 83-82, on a buzzer beater at Rice on Jan. 14. The Miners clawed back from down by nine at North Texas (Jan. 28) to get within one (35-34) with 10 minutes to play before eventually falling, 52-42. UTEP trailed by 11 late at Middle Tennessee and got within two before the Blue Raiders tallied the final 10 points for an 84-72 win on Feb. 2. In the tilt at WKU, UTEP fought back from 13 down to get within three only to have the home side ice the game with a pair of free throws on Feb. 4. In the loss against Charlotte, UTEP reduced an 18-point deficit with 13 minutes left to six points twice under four minutes before falling, 62-53, on Feb. 9. The the Orange and Blue worked an 11-point first-half deficit to one with 15 minutes left in regulation before UAB pulled away for the 79-66 triumph on Feb. 16. Last time out, UTEP overcame a nine-point first-half deficit against WKU on March 2 to pull ahead in the second stanza before ultimately falling, 73-68.\n\nGETTING AFTER IT ON THE GLASS\n\nUTEP has a +2.1 rebounding margin (34.8-32.7) this season, which is good enough for fifth in Conference USA. Aiding that figure was a seven-game streak in which the Miners were even or better on the glass, which was the longest surge since doing so in nine consecutive contests during the 2009-10 campaign.\n\nEBBS AND FLOWS OF DEFENSE\n\nAfter yielding 73+ points in seven of the past nine tilts, UTEP kept MT to 65 points in the 12-point win on March 4. With the recent run by the opposition, there have been 13 occasions total (1-12) where opponents have topped 70 points this year, with nine happening on the road. Four of the seven times this campaign that a foe has eclipsed 50 percent from the floor have happened away from home. Overall, UTEP's scoring defense sits at 68.4 points per game (fifth C-USA).\n\nRECORD-SETTING FIVE OT GAMES IN REGULAR SEASON\n\nUTEP's five overtime contests were the most in a regular season in program history. Both the 1994-95 and 2011-12 Miners played in four OT games during the regular season.\n\nTIED OVERALL OT RECORD\n\nThis year's team has matched the 1994-95 and 2011-12 teams for the single-season school record for overtime games at five. Both the '94-95 and '11-12 squads had four regular-season OT contests and one postseason OT tilt.\n\nBACK-TO-BACK OT\n\nThe Miners played back-to-back OT games at two different points this year, which is something that had never previously occurred at the school. Earlier this season, UTEP won consecutive OT games for the first time since the 2016-17 season (W, 88-87, FIU, 2OT, Jan. 14, 2017; W, 66-65, FAU, Jan. 16, 2017) with a double-overtime win against Alcorn State, (73-61, Nov. 22) and a 68-67 OT vanquishing of CSUB (Nov. 23). More recently the Orange and Blue dropped consecutive contests that both went to OT (L, 79-73, 2OT, at UAB, Dec. 23; L, 72-67, OT, Rice, Dec. 31).\n\nTALKING DOUBLE OVERTIME\n\nUTEP has had two games (1-1 record) go to double overtime this year, marking the first time in program history that the Miners have had multiple double-overtime games in the same season.\n\nLOTS OF OT UNDER GOLDING\n\nOverall, UTEP is now 69-50 all time in overtime contests, including 3-4 under head coach Joe Golding. The seven OT contests under Golding are the most during the first two seasons on the sideline for a Miner head coach.\n\nGUARDING THE THREE\n\nUTEP has kept 13 teams on the year to below 30 percent from the floor on 3-point attempts, including recently at FIU on Feb. 23 (2-12, 16.7 percent). The effort has helped the Miners sport a 3-point field-goal percentage defense of 33.2 to rate third in C-USA.\n\nTALKING INJURIES\n\nUTEP has battled through some injuries this season, with 33 man games across the board lost to injuries/illness. The breakdown is as follows: Malik Zachery (13 games), Jon Dos Anjos (12 games), Otis Frazier III (three games), Mario McKinney Jr. (three games) and Carlos Lemus (two games) have all missed time this year.\n\nFREE THROWS WIN BALL GAMES?\n\nThe old saying goes that free throws win ball games, but UTEP is 7-7 (had been 5-1) on the season when shooting 60 percent or less in a contest and 7-10 when eclipsing that figure. Included in the win count when falling short of 60 percent was a 40.5 percent (15-37) effort in a 60-55 triumph against LA Tech on Dec. 17. It marked the first time the Miners had won a game with 20+ misses at the charity stripe since topping UTSA, 81-74, on March 5, 2016 (20-40). It was the lowest FT% in a contest since making 14.3 percent (1-7) in a 58-45 setback to LA Tech on Jan. 18, 2015.\n\nKNOCKING DOWN SHOTS\n\nUTEP nailed at least 40.0 percent of its shots in 26 of 31 games on the campaign, including nine of the past 10 to put a two-contest streak below that figure in the rearview mirror. The 26 total efforts include surpassing 40 percent in the first 11 tilts of the year, the longest stretch to begin a season since the 2010-11 team did so over the initial 15 contests. The Miners have been particularly accurate with 2-point attempts, drilling 51.8 percent inside the arc.\n\nPACK THE DON\n\nUTEP led Conference USA in average attendance (4,552) in 2022-23 after rating second in the category last year. WKU took second place at 4,026. The Miners also paced the conference in overall home attendance (81,941), with the UAB (70,637) securing second\n\nWAS RARE AIR TO HOME START\n\nUTEP shot out to 8-0 at home, joining the 2019-20 team (9-0 start) and 2003-04 squad (8-0 start) as the only this century to win its first eight home contests. The Miners finished 11-7 in El Paso marking their fourth consecutive campaign with 10+ home triumphs. UTEP had a +6.2 (69.9-63.8 ppg) scoring differential in the Sun City. UTEP shot 45.6 percent compared to 41.9 by foes, had a +3.2 turnover margin (15.6-18.7), a +1.6 rebound margin (35.5-33.9) and took nearly 100 more free throws (414-319) in those 18 contests.\n\nTAKING DOWN 2022 POSTSEASON TEAMS\n\nFour of the Miners' 13 wins this year have come against teams that played postseason basketball a year ago, including two that went to the NCAA tournament. UTEP knocked off NM State (2022 NCAA second round) and Texas A&M-Corpus Christi (2022 NCAA first four), in addition to Alcorn State (2022 NIT) and Middle Tennessee (2022 CBI). All four of those teams won their conference (or division title). UTEP also has a victory against LA Tech, which was a stellar 24-10 last season.\n\nWIN CLOSE\n\nNearly half (six of 14) of the Miners' victories this year have been by five points or less, demonstrating their toughness and grit. UTEP toppled NM State by three (67-64, Nov. 12), CSU Bakersfield by one (68-67, OT, Nov. 23), Texas A&M-Corpus Christi by five (72-67, Nov. 25), LA Tech by five (60-55, Dec. 17), at Charlotte by two (60-58, Jan. 16) and at FIU by five (87-82, Feb. 23).\n\nLOCKED THEM DOWN AT THE DON\n\nUTEP had a scoring defense of 63.8 ppg at the Don Haskins Center this season, with opponents finishing at 41.9 percent overall and 31.5 percent from 3-point range. Only two teams (UAB, 79 points on Feb. 16 and WKU, 73 on March 2) out of 18 tallied more than 67 points (in regulation) in El Paso, with three held in the 50's and one in the 40's.\n\nFINISHING GAMES WITH THE LEAD\n\nEven though the Miners have had some close calls this year, they are 14-2 on the season when they have a lead with 5:00 to play in the contest. UTEP is also strong on the campaign (14-3) when up at the half.\n\nC-USA GOT IT DONE OUT OF CONFERENCE\n\nConference USA's 11 squads thrived out of conference, with a combined mark of 87-34 between the 11 programs. The league features three programs with top-60 NET rankings, in the form of (RV) FAU (15), North Texas (39) and UAB (57).\n\nGETTING TO THE LINE\n\nUTEP has been aggressive offensively, which has resulted in it going to the line often. The Miners are second in C-USA and 25th nationally with 22.2 free throw tosses per game, aiding by piling up 43 attempts against Alcorn State on Nov. 22. It marked the most free throw attempts by UTEP since taking 47 in a season-opening victory against Loyola on Nov. 14, 2016. UTEP's 14.1 free throws made per contest is third in the league and 93rd nationally.\n\nHARDY DOING IT ALL\n\nSouthern Miss transfer Tae Hardy is doing a little bit of everything this year, pacing the Miners in scoring (12.7 ppg-11th C-USA) and rating third in assists per game (1.8) and steals per game (1.2-15th C-USA). He's also shown endurance, placing second on squad at 32.2 minutes per game (ninth C-USA). He has started 30 of 31 games. Hardy has been a consistent scorer, tallying at least eight points in 26 of those contests. He has five 20+ point efforts, including a game-high 21 at Middle Tennessee on Feb. 2. He has led or shared the top spot on the team in scoring in 16 tilts, easily by far the most on the team. Hardy also has a team-high 19 double-digit scoring efforts. He has shown ice in his veins, nailing two free throws of the one-and-one variety with six seconds left to give UTEP a one-point lead at Rice (Jan. 14) before the Owls emerged victorious, 83-82, on a buzzer beater. He's been rolling lately, tallying double figures in scoring in seven of 10 and 11 of the past 16.\n\nGIVANCE THE LEADER\n\nEvansville transfer Shamar Givance, the only senior on the roster, has contributed in multiple ways this season while running the point for the Orange and Blue. He tops the team in assists per game (4.3-third C-USA), free-throw percentage-73.0 (min. 100 FTA) and playing time (33.3-fifth C-USA) while rating second in scoring (10.8 ppg) and steals per game (2.00-third C-USA/34th NCAA). He has surpassed double figures in scoring in 15 of the past 21 outings, including a season-high 22 points recently at FIU on Feb. 23. He has four double-doubles-all on assists and points-, doing so at UAB (17 points, 10 assists, Dec. 29), at Rice (16 points, 10 assists, Jan. 14), against FIU (15 points, 10 assists, Jan. 19) and at FIU (22 points, 10 assists, Feb. 23). That matches the most double-doubles of that variety in six years since Dominic Artis also had four during the 2016-17 season. Givance has shown the ability for clutch play, making two free throws with 3.0 seconds left to help lift UTEP to a 68-67 OT win against CSUB on Nov. 23. He also nailed a go-ahead 3-pointer with four seconds left in regulation at UAB (Dec. 29). before the Miners eventually fell in double overtime. Recently, he was 9-10 at the charity stripe in the final minute to ice the win at FIU on Feb. 23. He has also taken care of business of the court, being named to the Academic All-District Team on Feb. 21 while landing one of the coveted five spots on the C-USA All-Academic team on March 3.\n\nCALVIN'S CORNER\n\nStephen F. Austin transfer Calvin Solomon has been an impact, all-around player for UTEP in his first year with the Miners. He is the lone player on the roster to have started all 31 contests. Solomon leads the team in rebounding (5.9 rpg-11th C-USA), offensive rebounds (67 total, 2.1/game-ninth C-USA) and steals per game (2.03-second C-USA/32nd NCAA) while placing second in assists per game (2.06) and checking in third in scoring (9.4). He has been on a tear of late, having produced double figures in scoring in six straight and 12 of the past 15 games (two over the first 16 contests). He has at least one steal in all but two contests this year. Solomon boasts two double-doubles on the year, with 16 points and 10 boards vs. No. 24 Florida Atlantic (Jan. 21) and 16 points and 11 rebounds at UAB (Dec. 29).\n\nFRAZIER III'S IMPACT FELT\n\nGeorge Mason transfer Otis Frazier III has been a valuable piece for the Miners in 2022-23 despite having to battle through some injuries that cost him three games. He has started 25 of 28 games played, rating third in rebounding (3.9), fourth in offensive boards (41) and fifth in scoring (7.7 ppg). Frazier III is also connecting on 51.0 percent of his shots (second on team for players with 100+ FGA). His numbers are a stark improvement from his two years at George Mason, where he averaged 2.5 ppg and 1.7 rpg in 35 games played.\n\nONYEMA'S PROGRESS\n\nAfter failing to reach double figures in scoring over his first two seasons with the Orange and Blue, forward Ze'Rik Onyema has done so in 12 contests this year. That includes five straight to begin the season. He has regained that early-campaign form, having produced double figures in six of the past seven contests. He also recorded his first career double-double (10 points, career-high 10 rebounds) in the win vs. Alcorn State on Nov. 22 and then again recently at (RV) FAU with 11 points and a career-best 11 rebounds on Feb. 25. He paces the team (min 100 FGA) in field-goal percentage (56.3), is second in rebounding (4.3), third in offensive boards (44) and sixth for scoring (7.2 ppg). He put up 2.0 ppg and 1.6 rpg in 2021-22.\n\nKALU'S IMPROVEMENT\n\nKevin Kalu has done good work inside, nailing 56.2 percent of his shots (41-73). Overall, he is putting up 3.5 ppg (1.5 ppg as a freshman last year). He is second on the team in offensive boards (47) and is sixth in rebounding (3.5 rpg), which was aided by a career-high 10 boards at UAB (Dec. 29).\n\nMAKING THE MOST OF HIS MINUTES\n\nSophomore junior-college transfer Derek Hamilton has shown some potential in his 19 appearances off the bench this year. He is chipping in 2.7 points per game despite playing only 4.1 minutes per contest. Hamilton has been an accurate shooter, making 81.8 percent (9-11) at the free-throw line and 67.7 percent (21-31) from the floor.\n\nPOINTS ACROSS THE BOARD\n\nFive active players are scoring between 7.0 and 13.0 points per game. Tae Hardy (12.7 ppg-11th C-USA) and Shamar Givance (10.8 ppg) are in double figures to lead the way. Calvin Solomon (9.4 ppg), Otis Frazier III (7.7 ppg) and Ze'Rik Onyema (7.2 ppg) round out the group. There have been 11 players (out of 13) to register at least one double-digit scoring contests.\n\nTURNOVER MACHINES\n\nUTEP is forcing the opposition into 17.0 turnovers per game to lead Conference USA and place 10th nationally. The Miners harassed the first eight foes to commit at least 15 turnovers, the longest stretch to begin a season since the initial 12 opponents did so in 1974-75. Seven opponents have made at least 20 giveaways, including UAB (21) on Feb. 16. Sul Ross State (Nov. 15) had 32, which was the most in nine years by a UTEP opponent. All but four teams (Kent State-10, Dec. 22; at North Texas-seven, Jan. 28 at WKU-13, Feb. 4; and at (RV) FAU-12, Feb. 25) have committed at least 14 turnovers.\n\nGIVE ME THAT BALL\n\nUTEP's pressure defense has resulted in 9.1 steals per game to lead the league and rank ninth in the country. Aiding that figure was a school-record 24 steals in the victory against Sul Ross State on Nov. 15. Six different Miners had at least three steals in the contest to help them surge past the prior school standard of 21 which had stood since 1994 (against Cardinal Stich on Dec. 20, 1994). It also had 16 against UAB on Feb. 16, tying for 10th all time. The Orange and Blue (283 entering Wednesday) are third all time at UTEP for a single season, needing two steals to take over second and six to set the school standard (currently, 288, 2009-10). The charge has been led by Calvin Solomon (2.03 spg-second C-USA/32nd NCAA), Shamar Givance (2.00 spg-third C-USA/34th NCAA) and Tae Hardy (1.2 spg-15th C-USA), making the Miners the lone team in the league with three in the top 15 of the category.\n\nSTEALING THE SHOW\n\nShamar Givance piled up a career-high seven steals at UAB on Dec. 29, which tied as the most in program history against D1 opposition and rates tied for second overall at the school against opponents of all levels. His efforts helped the Miners post 12 steals. UTEP heads into Saturday's tilt with nine contests of 10+ steals on the season, with the last time it accomplished it coming at FIU on Feb. 23.\n\nTHE BENCH BUNCH\n\nThe Miners' bench has provided at least 15 points in 23 of 31 games this year (14 with 24+ points), including going off for a season-high 51 against Sul Ross State on Nov. 15. UTEP's campaign best vs. DI foes is 34, which happened both at DePaul (Dec. 10) and against NC A&T (Dec. 21).\n\nWHAT A CROWD\n\nUTEP played in front of an almost capacity crowd of 11,315 fans in the win against NM State on Nov. 12. It marked the largest home attendance for the Miners since an actual sellout (12,000) of the Don Haskins Center when they beat WKU, 93-89, in a game commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 1966 Texas Western NCAA Champions.\n\nTHERE WAS PLENTY OF PRODUCTION TO REPLACE\n\nBetween Jamari Sibley, Kevin Kalu and Ze'Rik Onyema, the Miners returned just 20.8 percent of their rebounding, 11.1 percent of their scoring and 9.0 percent of their assists from the 2021-22 squad. In total, the Miners lost four starters and 12 letter winners from last year's squad, including a pair of All-Conference USA performers in Souley Boum (second team) and Jamal Bieniemy (third team).\n\nNEW-LOOK TEAM\n\nUTEP lost four starters and 12 letter winners from last year's team, giving the Miners a new look in year two under head coach Joe Golding. UTEP brought in six Division I transfers (Otis Frazier III, George Mason, Shamar Givance, Evansville, Tae Hardy, Southern Miss, Garrett Levesque, Tarleton State, Mario McKinney Jr., NM State and Calvin Solomon, Stephen F. Austin) while adding four junior-college transfers (Jon Dos Anjos, Florida SouthWestern College, Derick Hamilton, Bossier Parish CC, Carlos Lemus, Chipola College and Malik Zachery, South Plains) and two true freshmen (Antwonne Holmes, Chapin HS, El Paso, Texas, and Jamal Sumlin, Rhodes HS, Cleveland, Ohio). It should be noted that Dos Anjos spent his freshman campaign at Loyola Marymount (Calif.) before going the junior-college route.\n\nEXPERIENCED D1 TRANSFERS\n\nThe Miners' six DI transfers combined to play in 379 contests, including making 165 starts, prior to their arrival in the Sun City. Shamar Givance (Evansville, 118 GP, 63 GS) and Calvin Solomon (Stephen F. Austin, 82 GP, 56 GS) are the most experienced of the bunch, but Otis Frazier III, George Mason, 35 GP), Mario McKinney Jr. (NM State, 38 GP, 5 GS) and Tae Hardy (Southern Miss, 30 GP, 26 GS) also have 30+ appearances.\n\nHOME COOKING\n\nUTEP got off to an 8-0 start at home, allowing it to join the 2019-20 team (9-0) and the 2003-04 unit (8-0) as the only this century to start at least 8-0. The Miners finished at 11-7 to mark the fourth straight season that the Orange and Blue have recorded at least 10 wins in the Sun City.\n\nLIFE ON THE ROAD\n\nUTEP started off 0-6 on the road, but it went 3-4 over the final seven games to finish at 3-10 away from home this year. It had some tough calls, dropping the first three C-USA road tilts by a combined nine points. The Miners either were leading/tied or within two points in the final minute of regulation in each of those tilts. The nine points was the smallest differential when starting 0-3 on the road in conference action in program history (happened 18 times previously).\n\nNATIONAL SPOTLIGHT\n\nThe Miners played 18 contests (5-13) broadcast/streamed on nationwide platforms during the regular season, with 13 on ESPN+ (5-9), and one each on ESPNU (0-1), FS1 (0-1), the Longhorn Network (0-1) and Stadium (0-1).\n\nA YEAR IN REVIEW\n\n- UTEP (20-14) posted its first 20+ win season since going 22-11 in 2014-15. It marked the 27th 20+ win campaign in program history.\n\n- The Miners notched their first postseason appearance since 2015 and first postseason win since 2009.\n\n- The Miners finished 11-7 in league play to secure their first winning conference record since forging a mark of 12-6 in 2016-17. That was aided by winning 10 of 14 down the stretch, including halting back-to-back C-USA West Division Champion North Texas' 15-game winning streak, 70-68, on \"Senior Day\" on March 5.\n\n- UTEP downed Old Dominion, 74-64, on March 9 for its first victory at the C-USA Championships in five years.\n\n- UTEP's seven road wins were the most since going 8-2 in 2013-14.\n\n- The Miners had their first winning road record (5-4) in league play since 2016-17.\n\n- UTEP's five league road wins surpassed its total (four) of such games from the prior three seasons combined.\n\n- UTEP had a six-game conference USA winning streak (Jan. 15 to Feb. 5), which was its longest since also posting six straight wins in 2016 (2/4-20/16). It marked the fifth winning streak of at least six C-USA games since the Miners joined the league in 2005-06.\n\nTHE BASIC FACTS ON UTEP\n\n- This is the 102nd season of UTEP men's basketball. The Miners made history by starting five African-Americans to defeat Kentucky, 72-65, and win the 1966 NCAA Championship on the way to inspiring the Disney hit movie Glory Road. Overall, UTEP has 17 NCAA Tournament appearances (last in 2010), 11 NIT bids (last in 2015), 12 conference championships (last in 2010) and 27 seasons with at least 20+ victories (last in 2022). The Miners have won five league tournaments (last in 2005).\n\n- The Miners have a strong presence in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame with Don Haskins, Nate Archibald, Nolan Richardson, the 1966 team and Tim Hardaway all representing UTEP.\n\n- UTEP finished 20-14 in 2021-22, which was its most wins since going 22-11 in 2014-15.\n\n- The Miners returned one starter (Jamari Sibley), and three letter winners overall. The two other returning letter winners are Kevin Kalu and Ze'Rik Onyema.\n\n- UTEP has 12 newcomers: Jon Dos Anjos, Otis Frazier III, Shamar Givance, Derick Hamilton, Tae Hardy, Antwonne Holmes, Carlos Lemus, Garrett Levesque, Mario McKinney Jr., Calvin Solomon, Jamal Sumlin and Malik Zachery.\n\nGET TO KNOW COACH GOLDING\n\nJoe Golding is in his second year at UTEP and is the 20th head coach in program history. He is the eighth head coach for the Miners since legendary Hall of Fame Coach Don Haskins retired following the 1998-99 season. Golding is 192-175 in his 12th season as a collegiate head coach, including 34-31 at UTEP. Last year he became the fourth head coach (20 total) in program history to have a winning season in their first year on the sideline. Don Haskins was the first when he directed the Miners to a mark of 18-6 in 1961-62. Doc Sadler (27-8, 2004-05) and Tim Floyd (25-10, 2010-11) also achieved the feat. Overall, the prior 19 head coaches combined to forge an average record of 9-13 in their first year with UTEP. Previously Golding spent 10 years at Abilene Christian (158-144), helping it transition from a Division II to a Division I program. Golding led the Wildcats to the 2019 and 2021 NCAA Tournaments, including a stunning upset as a 14-seed of third-seeded Texas in the first round of the 2021 Big Dance.\n\nHelp support UTEP student-athletes by making a gift to the Miner Athletic Club.\n\nVisit givingto.utep.edu/mac today!\n\nMattress Firm is the Presenting Sponsor of UTEP Men's Basketball.\n\nFor complete coverage of UTEP men's basketball, be sure to follow the Miners on social media at @UTEPMBB (Twitter), @utepmbb (Instagram) and on Facebook @UTEPMensBasketball or visit the official home of UTEP Athletics at www.UTEPMiners.com"
