        "text": "Daisy Edgar-Jones and Ben Seed were first rumored to be dating in early September 2023 after being spotted enjoying London together. Soon after, they made things official by attending the GQ Men of the Year Awards in November as one another’s date.\n\nThough they are open about their romance, they’re not particularly public about it. As Edgar-Jones goes through a whirlwind press tour for Twisters with co-star Glen Powell, she hasn’t shared too much about her private relationship.\n\nHere’s everything we do know about the Normal People star and her photographer boyfriend.\n\nWho is Ben Seed?\n\nOn his Instagram profile, Seed writes that he is a “photographer, director, and artist.” His posts show his work for huge fashion brands like Prada, Bulgari, and Dior. He’s also done portraits of stars like Andrew Scott, Paul Mescal, Priyanka Chopra, Nicola Coughlan, and, of course, Daisy Edgar-Jones.\n\nHow long have he and Edgar-Jones been together?\n\nThough they were rumored to be dating in September, Seed posted photographs of Edgar-Jones as far back as June 2023.\n\nBecause of his work and friendships, Seed could have met his current girlfriend way earlier. But when The Daily Mail’s photos of them came out in September, they appeared to have more than a friendly or just professional relationship. In the shots, she embraces him as he kisses her head.\n\nAround that time, a source told The Sun that Edgar-Jones was on “cloud nine” with Seed and implied they’d been dating for a bit.\n\n“They have both had some free time this summer and love hanging out in Broadway Market in East London, just going to bars and spending time together,” the insider claimed. “There’s a real spark there, and they are excited about finding each other. They’ve already met one another’s friends.”\n\nIn November, they attended the GQ Men of the Year Awards.\n\nIn February 2024, they attended the EE BAFTA Film Awards and then were seen at Netflix’s after-party at Chiltern Firehouse.\n\nBut it wasn’t until July 2024 that Edgar-Jones went “Instagram official,” sharing a gallery of pics from the Glastonbury Festival. She tagged a photo of her and Seed walking together with his handle.\n\nIn mid-July, Seed shared more pictures of Edgar-Jones and an adorable mirror selfie of her sitting on his back.He wrote about how “proud” he was of her work on the movie Twisters.\n\nWho else have they been romantically linked to?\n\nSeed reportedly dated Anya Taylor-Joy in 2020, according to The Daily Mail. He shared a number of photographs he took of the actress between 2019 and 2022, but they never confirmed their relationship. In 2021, they seemed to have split, and Taylor-Joy went on to date and ultimately marry Malcolm McRae.\n\nEdgar-Jones has been rumored to be dating her co-stars, including Glen Powell and Paul Mescal, but she has denied that fan speculation. It’s just good chemistry.\n\n“You watch with bemusement really, because it’s interesting to see what narratives people write in,” she told the Sunday Times about Mescal. “Usually they’re quite harmless and when I’m spotted it’s normally just a lot of, ‘Oh, that’s Whatsherface?’ And I say, ‘It is.’”\n\nShe and Mescal are close friends, and he was included in the gallery of photos from Glastonbury.\n\nShe was confirmed to date actor Tom Varey from 2018 and 2020 after they met on the set of Pond Life. In 2020, she said on Elizabeth Day’s podcast that Varey was supportive of her work on Normal People, which included some sex scenes.\n\n“My boyfriend, actually, he was amazing because what a tricky thing to watch,” she explained. “He loves the series, thank goodness, that’s something I’m very relieved about, but there was a moment in episode six where he was like, ‘This is a bit weird! Oh, this is weird!’ and we all had to acknowledge that it was a bit weird, and then it was fine.”"
