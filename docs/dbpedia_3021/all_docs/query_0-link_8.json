        "text": "Koume and Yaegashi dated during the two years but split up when Yaegashi wanted to take the next step and start a family. Aragami are appearing in Japan again and one attacks the TAC building with Kunikida inside. Momiji works with Matsudaira in the Research Department. Kusanagi has been distant lately to Momiji. After arriving at his apartment, they fall into a compromising position but... he backs out and Momiji runs off. While Kusanagi walks around belittling himself, he meets Valencia, who tells him she understands and is like him. An Aragami attacks Momiji and Sakura while they're in a pool. Koume arrives in a helicopter, then drives it into the main Aragami's mitama. Valencia joins the group in a TAC uniform and head to where the Aragami originated in San Francisco\n\nIf you haven't already guessed by now, this particular Omake is about Kusanagi's naughty hobby of spying on women; the women of the TAC in particular. Word gets around, and Mr. Kunikida comes begging for some pictures, which Kusanagi is more than willing to sell to him. Kunikida is overjoyed, but his sentiments are not shared by the women of the TAC. They have their own way of taking care of men behaving badly....\n\nThis Omake consists of several small acts: Act 1 Kunikida and Takeuchi beheading Momiji. Kunikida triumphantly declares, \"I did it!\" and then is nonplussed when Momiji sprouts spider legs (like an Aragami) and skitters away... Act 2 Momiji and Kusanagi under a cherry tree; it seems that Momiji is trying to tell him that she likes him, but all that seems to be coming out is the name of famous Sumo wrestlers... go figure... Act 3 Kusanagi in a desperate battle with an Aragami. He lunges, stretching his arm out to strike at the feroucious monster, when, lo and behold he misses and his arm doesn't retract. How embarrassing! Act 4: Kunikida's lethal joke. He lets Momiji read it. She dies laughing. He wants to test it on a guinea pig: enter Kusanagi. He dies reading it, and then you find out, it wasn't really necessary to test it, since all the Aragami were put to sleep when Momiji died reading his joke in the first place... Oh, the irony.\n\nThis Omake is like an episode of the Twilight Zone. Our host, Yoshiki Yaegashi, takes us on a virtual tour of what reality might have been like if Momiji had won the idol contest. But first we take a short detour as Yaegashi accidentally pulls up a computer simulation of Momiji showing off her underwear... The correct simulation takes us on a tour where we stop by and see the members of the TAC watching Momiji on the television at the idol competition. Momiji wins and we see her in various scenarios, but in the end, she gets a job at an anime production studio where she becomes, an anime idol, who looks horrifyingly familiarl!!!!\n\nThis Omake is like an episode of the Twilight Zone.

Momiji wins and we see her in various scenarios, but in the end, she gets a job at an anime production studio where she becomes, an anime idol, who looks horrifyingly familiarl!!!!\n\nThis particular Omake is about Momiji sitting in her room on a rainy day dreaming about Kusanagi. There is a lot of imagery using water: Momiji putting her hands in a sink full of water, Momiji drinking a glass of water, watching the water puddle on the ground. I am sure that there is some symbolism in this somewhere, but I'm not sure what... = ( We see Momiji sitting on the floor, on the bed, curled up in a ball and at the window, writing symbols on the fogged window pain. We see the renewal of all that's green from the rain: the flowers, the plant. We see the rain stop, and Momiji stare dreamily up at a miniature doll of Kusanagi hanging outside her window. So what is the significance of having the teruterubozu look like Kusanagi?? Well, I guess that is left for the viewers interpretation. But somehow, knowing how Momiji feels about Kusanagi, it doesn't surprise me that she would feel that he is her good luck charm. After all, she probably thinks that he hung the moon and the stars as well... Thanks again, Juliet!!!\n\nThis particular Omake, I have to say, is probably my favorite. In it, Murakumo and Kusanagi go head to head in a game of Mahjong. Murakumo assures Kusanagi that there is \"no way that an imperfect fool like you can beat someone as perfect as me.\" And later, as the game progresses, Murakumo accuses Kusanagi of cheating: \"WAIT! I heard a click just then!\" and Kusanagi's response: \"What!? I didn't hear a thing!!!\" Murakumo's comeback: \"The perfect ears of my perfect body made it perfectly clear!!!\" Kusanagi's rebuttal: \"It's perfectly clear that you're a jerk!\" = D Kusanagi then applies a little pressure to the other two participants of the game, asking if they heard a click. Murakumo, of course, is prepared. He whips out a Mahjong manual and hands it to Kusanagi, telling him he doesn't know how to play Mahjong. Kusanagi reads the manual and discovers that he DOESN'T know how to play mahjong. This angers him and he decides to beat up the poor bystanders, helped, of course, by Murakumo. Afterwards, Murakumo expresses the thought that he's feeling a little hungry and he offers to buy Kusanagi lunch.\n\nThis is an omake that is devoted entirely to Kome. It is a bittersweet look at her past as she finds an old composition that she wrote centering around a transfer student that comes to her school and whom she develops a crush on; but her feelings go unrequited. The message: The strength of loving someone can crush a rock... It can also crush someone else's love. After she finishes reading her composition and walking down memory lane, it's time to get ready for festival. She sees Yaegashi and Momiji. They are waiting for her, and she focuses for a moment on Yaegashi...\n\nThis omake involves entirely around Kunikida's daily ritual of a Japanese breakfast and then a nice soak in his tub... \"Oh, what happiness it is to be born Japanese!\" - Unless of course, a fly lands in your breakfast and Momiji leaves your tub only half full of hot water. Kunikida's dilemma: fitting his body into a couple of inches of water without freezing to death. -_-;; And of course, silliness ensues...\n\nAlthough this Omake is about Sugishita, itcenters around Ryoko for the most part, and her crush on Kunikida and is set to music. Through the course of the Omake we get a glimpse of Ryoko doing different things: firing her gun, cooking, shopping, and standing near Kunikida's desk with a Valentine's Day gift for her boss. She is being watched by Sugishita, and when he realizes she is hesitating, he goes up behind her and gives her a push, forcing her forward so that she has to give Kunikida the present. Sugishita turns away, a sad look on his face.... But it's really hard to feel sorry for him when he has a virtual harem of girls waiting for him in the lobby with Valentine's Day gifts for him.... For those of you who are wondering Valentine's Day in Japan is strictly a male holiday. Women present the men in their life with gifts (usually chocolate) - even their bosses. Women do not receive gifts on Valentine's Day. Their \"Valentine's Day\" comes in May (?) and is called White Day. This is when men present women with gifts.....\n\nThis particular Omake deals with man versus nature, or more specifically, god versus nature. We see Susano-oh battle against the sea, trying to gain supremacy over the creatures there by hurling first rocks and then a bomb at them. Also we see him sever the tail of a lizard, which he waters and then runs from when it grows into a huge lizard that decides he would make a good lunch. In this omake, we also see him scale a huge rock, to stand overlooking the valley. And while on top of that rock, an airplane comes along and runs over him... -_-;; hmmm.... It seems like he just can't win in this one. ^_^\n\nThis omake is quite amusing and runs along the lines of the first, centering on the perversion of Kusanagi and his fascination of for photographing women in various states of undress. But before we get to that part, we learn that Ms. Matsudaira is harboring under her own sort of fascination - the prospect of having Mr. Kusanagi as a specimen for... er... scientific research. Such thoughts leave her quite... emotional, to say the least ^_^. She begs Mr. Kunikida to go in search of Kusanagi for the express purpose of roping him into acting as field research. Mr. Kunikida complies, but for personal reasons of his own. It seems that Mr. Kunikida is quite anxious to get a good look at the pictures of Momiji that Kusanagi has taken!\n\nThings get even more confusing for poor Momiji when a man named Mamoru Kusanagi arrives, but when she learns that he is there to protect her from these strange monsters (Aragami), she feels safer. Little does she know Kusanagi hasn't decided to save her or sacrifice her. Meanwhile, the TAC rush to the scene with an experimental creation that may defeat the terrible Aragami.\n\nAfter being sent to Tokyo, the Aragami-target Momoji discovers that she is now under the care of the TAC. She knows these monsters are terrible, evil things, and really wants to help, but can't find out how to. The TAC soon discover that their base isn't as safe as they thought when an Aragami breaks in and attacks.\n\nTAC Member Yoshiki Yaegashi feels that the others seem to help out a lot more and that he is not needed, and when kind-hearted Momiji tries to help out, she discovers something about him that she could've lived without knowing. After trying to help Yaegashi restore his confidence, the two set out to track town an Aragami.\n\nDire Tokyo is being stalked by mutated dogs, but the TAC and their friend Kusanagi are doing nothing to defeat them. Soon the group discovers that they are being mysteriously killed, and to catch both the dogs and the killer, Kusanagi brings Momiji out on what he told her was a date, little does she know it's a plan to save Tokyo.\n\nAnother Aragami is again terrorizing Tokyo, and this time it's a fire-breathing frog who has his eyes on the subway system. When Momiji confronts the Aragami, she meets Muramuko, an evil man who almost brings her life to an end. Kusanagi arrives just in time to give her mouth-to-mouth, or what she considers 'a kiss', and faces off with Muramuko.\n\nPoor Momiji Fujiyama is having a terrible time trying to keep up in school AND work at the TAC, but when her wounded love arrives at her window needing treatment, she happily takes him into her home. Meanwhile, the TAC investigate a strange centipide that has a habit of wrapping itself around large skyscrapers and leaving it's (icky) skin all over the place.\n\nMomiji and the TAC take refuge in Sakura's apartment in order to avoid the goverment long enough to find a way to handle the Arigami. Sakura confirms Kunakida's suspicions--the US can't help until they are specifically asked for assistance by the Japanese government, due to the terms of the joint-treaty. The TAC hopes that the apartment is inconspicious enough that they will be able to continue their Arigami research without disturbance. Unfortunately, that isn't the case. Murakumo shows up. Yaegashi is wounded trying to protect Kome, and Momiji is carried off by Murakumo. Murakumo takes Momiji back to the place where Kaede and Susano-oh are residing. He hopes to use Momiji to get to Kaede, who he now wants to kill. His plans are interrupted by Kusanagi. A battle ensues. Kaede saves Momiji, whose mitama is lost (but retrieved by Kusanagi.) The giant mitama is Susano-oh's resting place begins to shake violently. Thanks to his new mitama, courtesy of Momiji, Kusanagi is able to fly them\n\nKusanagi pays the prime minister a visit and delivers a special package--a cell phone from Kunakida. With it, Kunakida tries to convince goverment officials that the TAC can eliminate the Arigami without sacrificing Momiji. He asks that they at least give the TAC a chance to save Momiji's life. The prime minister reveals that that Momiji's pictures were released to the press by an Arigami spy in the government, whom they have been unable to identify. Meanwhile, Japan is in an uproar. Volcanos are erupting everywhere and plants continue to grow at incredible rates. The people want the Momiji to be placed in custody, and they are angry with the goverment for being unable to do so. Progress continues on the Kushinada pulse, and the TAC discovers that the secret to the Kushinada's blood is somehow involved in the strange melody that both Momiji and Kaede resonate. Momiji remembers that Kaede spoke of the rite of matsuri, and asks to be taken to the place where the ceremony is held. Kunakid\n\nIt's dawn and the TAC is preparing for the final battle. The team prepares the Kushinada pulse amplifying machine while Momiji prepares herself for the Rite of Matsuri. With less than an hour until the solar eclipse, Kaede begins the ceremony by touching a sword to the field around Susano-oh. Susano-oh begins to mutate into a big, ugly nasty beastie. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being persuaded by his aide to lie to the people of Japan to keep them calm and under control. The Minister goes on television, but instead of lying to the people, he tells the truth. He informs them that the problems have been caused by an ancient race of monsters called the Arigami, and that the Kushinada is the only one with the power to stop them. Momiji comes onto television, requesting that the people of Japan give her a chance to live. She wants to try an alternate method to kill Susano-oh, but if her plan does not work, she will accept her fate and sacrifice herself. Momiji begins the rite of matsur\n\nThe giant Arigami buds are blooming, causing mitamas to fall to earth. The mitamas cause all whom they touch to turn to plants... Momiji screams in pain as the Kushinada pulse is turned on her. Kaede hears her screams, but says that it is \"\"too late.\"\" She melds herself into Susano-oh's mitama in order to protect him from Murakumo, who is still attacking. Murakumo suffers a few blows from Kusanagi before burying one of his heads into Susano-oh. Murakumo laughs, announcing that he has won, as he begins to drain Susano-oh's energy. Kaede only shakes her head and calls him a fool. Murakumo continues to feed off of Susano-oh's power until his mitama grow to be huge. Then suddenly, his mitama shatter. As Murakumo is left writhing in pain, Susano-oh finishes him with an energy bolt. The children of Japan can hear the Kushinada's pulse, Momiji's song, and are starting to sing along with it. Momiji has almost completed the matsuri. The members of the TAC note that they all feel warm and happy"
