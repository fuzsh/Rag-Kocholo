        "text": "Highly prized for their brilliant blue flowers, the soft, frilly double blossoms with fringed petals and delicate gray-green feather foliage, cornflowers are ideal in a vase along with zinnias, calendula and other brightly colored cutting garden blossoms. Two of the most common varieties of Bachelor Buttons grown by the cut flower industry are “Blue Boy” or “Blue Diadem”, along with “Black Ball” which is a dark burgundy cornflower, especially striking with ornamental grasses.\n\nLearn the best practices for wildflower planting with expert tips from the 'Seed Man'\n\nAll About Cornflower: Origins and Uses\n\nCornflowers are sometimes referred to by their nickname, \"bachelor's button\" due to an old practice when men wore a cornflower in a buttonhole of their suit, indicating they are in love or they were ready for courting. Cornflowers, or Bachelor Buttons, are also used as boutonnieres in weddings, often worn by the groom and his best man which is a more modern twist on this traditional symbol of love and devotion.\n\nCalled ‘Bluet’ in England and ‘Bluebonnet’ in Scotland, in North America Cornflowers are sometimes called Ragged Robin, or Ragged Sailor because of the shaggy petals. They are one of the few true blue flowers that are also edible, imparting a sweet cucumber like taste. In the garden, they are visually stunning planted with brightly colored Nasturtiums, Marigold and California Poppies. In a vase, they blend well with Snapdragons, Sweet William and Love-in-a-Mist (or Nigella)\n\nThe cornflower shape and brilliant blue color is similar to chicories, and has many associations throughout the world; it is the national flower of Estonia, representing the Estonian political party, and a symbol for social liberalism with the Swedish National Party. The blue cornflower also plays a role in German history, thanks to Queen Luis of Prussia who purportedly hid her children in a field of cornflowers when she fled Berlin.\n\nThe story is told that she kept them quiet by weaving wreaths made from the flowers. To honor her courage and resourcefulness, the Cornflower blue was adopted for the uniforms of the Prussian army. In France, the cornflower is a common symbol for veterans of World War to wear, as a reminder of the 1918 Armistice, similar to the remembrance of poppies worn in the UK and Canada.\n\nEasy to grow from seed, Cornflowers are highly successful when planted several times during the growing season. Start by sowing seeds indoors, then transplant seedlings after danger of frost is past. Sow a row or two directly in the garden in late spring, pressing in the seed about ½ inch, then rake over with fresh soil, press, and water lightly. Another planting can be done in mid-summer for a showy fall display. A variety of different colors of bachelor buttons create an effective visual.\n\nCornflowers prefer to grow in an open, sunny location and can tolerate poor soil, yet prefer rich loamy garden soil that has been enriched with phosphorus, which gives an extra boost to fruit and flowering plants. Dig a little fertilizer into the soil at the start of the growing season, and again mid-summer.\n\nWhen harvesting the blossoms, cut them just before the buds open for longer lasting display. With sharp scissors, harvest a full stem, which will encourage new growth to sprout from the base of the plant.\n\nCornflowers are relatively carefree, yet can be susceptible to stem rot and rust, if grown too tightly in a bed with not enough air in-between to circulate. Garden pests that can affect Cornflowers include aphids and leafhoppers, which will weaken the stems, causing the plant to expire."
