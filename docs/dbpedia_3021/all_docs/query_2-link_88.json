        "text": "Do you have our Bonsai Bonanza Starter Kit or our 8-variety Bonsai Seed set? If so, this is the article for you!\n\nIt would be nice if all the seeds in existence would make it easy on us, and have the same growing requirements. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case. Bonsai tree seeds come from all different locations, climates, and may have special stratification methods to ensure germination.\n\nGrowing a tree from seed requires patience and lots of TLC, keep in mind you are growing a tree! Bonsai tree care is essential for ensuring your tree thrives. There will always be trial and error, especially if you are just starting on your Bonsai growing adventure. Growing bonsai from seeds allows for better control over the growth and styling of your plants. This is your all-in-one, get down to the nitty-gritty, how-to-guide to best sow and care for your bonsai seeds!\n\n***Helpful Note: If the titles/names of the tree seeds are highlighted in green, click on it, and it will take you to a how-to video (thank you Nikki!) for that seed!***If the title/name is highlighted in blue, click on it and it will take you to the a more-in depth article on the topic, or a product page!\n\n**Give the seed packets a good read!**The back of the seed packets contains crucial information, specific to each seed. Pay attention to the germination days (how long it takes that seed variety to sprout on average), and the soil temperature required for that seeds. The seeds must be kept consistently kept at that temperature during the whole germination period, or they will struggle to pop up! A seed heating mat will be your best friend when it comes to keeping the soil warm.\n\nSeed Specific Sowing and Care Information Bonsai seeds will need to be “prepared” before sowing in the soil. Stratification is an important step! This is done by soaking the seeds in water, or placing them between layers of wet paper towel, and soaking them. Again, different seeds will have their own unique needs!\n\nFlame Tree (Delonix Regia)\n\nThese seeds have a SUPER hard shell casing. You can help the seed sprout easier by soaking them in warm water for 24-48 hours. Keeping water/seeds in an insulated mug while soaking will help this process. Once they are done soaking, don’t be surprised if they have a white membrane-like substance on the seed casing, this is normal!\n\nOnce they are done soaking, grab a sturdy pair of scissors or small pruners, and snip 1/8th of the pointy end of the seed off.\n\nNow you can plant the flame seeds in the soil! You’ll want to so them lengthwise/sideways in the soil at a shallow depth, about 1/4”-1/2” deep.\n\nYou want to keep the soil between 70-80F, 75F being the sweet spot. They can take up to a month to germinate.\n\nMake sure you keep the soil moist, not soaking wet, and don’t let it dry out! It’s helpful to give the flame tree’s soil a good misting every morning.\n\nBrazillian Rosewood (Jacaranda Mimosifolia)\n\nIt’s common for the paper-like part of the flat seed casing to arrive to you broken off, don’t worry! This is just the part of the seed that would normally help it travel in nature, which isn’t needed since we are planting them ourselves. So if your seeds look broken when they arrive, they are actually ok.\n\nThe best way to soak these fragile seeds is between sheets of wet paper towels. You can then place it in a shallow bowl with warm water, and soak them for 12-24 hours before planting.\n\nPlant them in at a shallow depth in the soil, no deeper than 1/4”! You can lay them on top of the soil, and sprinkle leftover soil over the top of them until they are just barely covered.\n\nTheir name hints, they like it hot! Anything less than 85F is going to produce poor results if any. And keep in mind it can take these seeds almost two months to germinate. A seed heating mat will help you and your seed a lot.\n\nOnce they are mature, Rosewood is hardy to only 55*F and needs winter protection, so use caution during the winter months.\n\nColorado Blue Spruce (Picea Pungens Glauca San Juan), Black Spruce(Picea Mariana), Japanese Black Pine(Pinus Thunbergii)\n\nStart by giving these seeds an 8-12-hour soak in cool water. Any longer can rot the seeds! The seeds are pretty small, so draining the water into a strainer or coffee filter, then using tweezers to grab the seeds can help.\n\nDon’t plant the seeds too deep in the soil, no deeper than 1/8th”. Make sure the soil is nice and loose before planting, and don’t pack the soil down after the seeds are sown.\n\nKeep the seeds in a cool location, away from hot sunshine and drafty windows and vents. They like their soil to stay at a cool 65F and can take a month to germinate.\n\nThe Spruces need to develop nice strong tap roots right away, so you will see only a couple inches of top growth during the first year.\n\nDawn Redwood(Metasequoia Glyptostroboides)\n\nThese seeds take a bit more preparation than the other seeds, but it must be done! Put a little bit of peat moss in a Ziploc bag then add the seeds. Place the bag in the crisper drawer in your refrigerator, and let them chill for a month.\n\nAfter their winter trip, place them on top of the prepared soil, and lightly sprinkle soil over the seeds. They should be at a depth of 1/8th”-1/4th” Don’t compress the soil too much!\n\nPut them in a bright, not hot location. They’ll need to be kept at 70F, and can take two months to sprout!\n\nBuddha Tree(Ficus Religiosa)\n\nSoak the seeds between wet paper towels for two days. Make sure you don’t let them dry out!\n\nAfter they are done soaking, take some sandpaper and rub each seed against it. You don’t absolutely need to do this, but it will help spend up the extra-lenghty germination time!\n\nNestle the seeds about 1/16” in the soil, you are barely even covering them! Mist the top of the soil when ever it drys out, and be carefull when deep-watering, you don’t want to drive the seeds too deep in the soil.\n\nThese seeds need to stay no cooler than 75F to germinate, and can take 90 days sprout, so have patience!\n\nIt can help to place keep a loose-fitting piece of saran wrap over the top of the soil to keep the humidity in. Take the plastic on and off on alternating days. This can be done for the Brazilian Rosewood and Flame Tree as well.\n\nSiberian Elm(Ulmus Pumila)\n\nSoak them in cold or warm water for a day.\n\nSow them in the soil no 1/4” or less. Very lightly compact the soil, just enough so they don’t move when you water them.\n\nThey need to be keep cool, 65F-70F. They won’t sprout if they get warmer than that. They can take about a month to germinate.\n\nSoilOnly use soil specifically for seed-starting when planting these seeds, and skip on using bonsai soil until they have matured and have a substantial root system. Using any other type of soil, other than seed starting soil, can result in poor germination.\n\nWateringMonitor the average hydration of the soil, and make sure it stays damp but not soaking. Soaking wet soil can lead to rotten seeds, mold, and other undesirable soil conditions. All soils are different, so never rely on watering every day or on certain days. The water requirements for sprouts can vary from day to day, depending on their growth rate! You typically will do a deep watering a couple times a week, and mist the top soil whenever it looks dry.\n\nYou can purchase a moisture meter or you can use a toothpick/wooden skewer. Carefully push the toothpick all the way into the soil. If it comes up wet/has soil stuck to it, you don’t need to water. If it comes up dry/no soil stuck to it, you need to water.\n\nLightAs soon as your seeds have sprouted, they will need lots of light to continue to grow past the cotyledon stage! If you’re using an LED grow light, you’ll need to make sure that it runs for at least 10 hours a day. If you’re using a conventional “bulb-type” grow light, you can run it from 8-10 hours. Failure to supply your sprouts with enough sunshine will deprive them of their primary source of energy. If you’re relying on the light of the sun to get your sprouts to thrive, be prepared for temperamental little plant babies on cloudy days. The cooler varieties( spruces, pine, elm, redwood) won’t like hot sunlight/grow lights, so may sure they get plenty of light, but stay nice and cool.\n\n*If you are using a windowsill/natural sunlight to grow your sprouts, rotate the pots daily to help them grow straight and not leaning to one side!\n\nPlant FoodOnce your sprouts have developed their second set of leaves, they’ll be getting hungry. It’s time for plant food! A water-based, low-dose organic plant food is the best route to go, as this will reach the roots the easiest. Make sure it low in nitrogen, and has lots of micro-nutrients.\n\n**Thinning out your sprouts:**For the strongest, healthiest sprouts, you’ll want just one seedling per pot or cell. Thinning is challenging for many gardeners; who wants to destroy sprouts you’ve worked so hard to grow?! But it has to be done. Select the strongest, healthiest seedling and use a pair of scissors to snip off the others at the soil line. You can try to transplant the extras into different pots, but you risk disturbing the roots too much and killing them all!\n\nChoosing the Right Bonsai Tree Seeds\n\nChoosing the right bonsai seeds is a crucial first step in your bonsai growing journey. Factors to consider include the climate compatibility of the tree species, the desired style of the bonsai, and the difficulty level of cultivation. For beginners, it is advisable to start with species that are easier to grow and maintain, such as Japanese Maple, Juniper, or Chinese Elm. These species are more forgiving and can tolerate common beginner mistakes. Sourcing seeds locally can provide better adaptation and growth in your local climate. You can collect seeds from various tree species in your surrounding area, which can lead to more viable and resilient bonsai trees. It’s also important to consider the final size and growth rate of the tree, as some bonsai varieties may take years to develop into the desired shape and form. Researching the specific care requirements of each species can help you make an informed decision and set realistic expectations for your bonsai’s growth and maintenance.\n\nTools and Supplies Needed\n\nTo successfully grow bonsai from seeds, having the right tools and supplies is essential. Basic items include seed trays or small pots, high-quality bonsai soil mix, a watering can with a fine nozzle, and grow lights for adequate lighting, especially if you’re growing indoors. Additional supplies like humidity trays can help maintain moisture levels, while a seed heating mat can ensure optimal soil temperature for germination. It’s also advisable to have sterilized tools, such as small pruners, tweezers, and a spray bottle for misting. Using clean and quality materials minimizes the risk of diseases and pests, promoting healthy seedling growth. For those serious about bonsai cultivation, investing in specialized bonsai tools, such as wire cutters, concave cutters, and root rakes, can be beneficial for future care and styling.\n\nBonsai tree pruning is crucial for achieving and maintaining the unique shape and compact size of bonsai trees. Essential tools for this include small pruners and concave cutters.\n\nCommon Problems and Solutions\n\nGrowing bonsai from seeds can come with its share of challenges for bonsai plants. Common issues include mold growth, slow germination, and seedling diseases. Monitoring a tree's growth and addressing issues promptly is crucial for the health of your bonsai. Mold often develops in overly moist environments, so it’s crucial to manage humidity levels and provide good air circulation. If you encounter mold, reduce watering and increase ventilation around the seedlings. Slow germination can result from inadequate temperature or old seeds. Using a seed heating mat and ensuring fresh, viable seeds can mitigate this problem. Seedling diseases, such as damping-off, can be prevented by using sterilized soil and tools, and avoiding overwatering. If seedlings start wilting or showing signs of disease, remove affected plants immediately and treat the soil with a mild fungicide. Monitoring your seedlings closely and addressing issues promptly can help ensure healthy growth.\n\nLong-Term Care and Styling\n\nAs your bonsai trees mature, transitioning to long-term care and styling becomes essential. This phase involves regular pruning, wiring, and shaping to develop the desired form and style of your bonsai. Starting from seeds allows you to avoid dealing with thick branches early in the process, making it easier to shape the tree. Pruning helps maintain the tree’s size and encourages ramification, while wiring allows for the bending and shaping of branches. It’s crucial to be gentle and mindful during these processes to avoid damaging the tree. Seasonal care is also important; for instance, repotting should be done in early spring before new growth begins, and fertilizing schedules should be adjusted according to the growing season. Additionally, protecting your bonsai from extreme weather conditions, pests, and diseases is vital for its health. Long-term care also includes aesthetic considerations, such as the placement of the tree in its pot and the overall balance and harmony of the composition.\n\nIndoor vs. Outdoor Bonsai\n\nUnderstanding the differences between indoor and outdoor bonsai plants is crucial for providing the appropriate care. Outdoor bonsai species, such as Junipers and Pines, require exposure to seasonal changes and natural sunlight. They should be kept outdoors year-round, with proper protection from extreme weather conditions. Indoor bonsai, like Ficus and Jade, are more suited to stable, indoor environments where temperature and humidity can be controlled. They require bright, indirect light and regular watering to mimic their native tropical climates. It’s important to note that not all bonsai can be kept indoors, as some species need cold dormancy periods to thrive. When choosing a bonsai species, consider your living conditions and the level of care you’re able to provide. Properly matching the species to its environment will ensure the health and longevity of your bonsai.\n\nBonsai Aesthetics and Philosophy\n\nBonsai is not just about growing a bonsai; it’s an art form deeply rooted in aesthetics and philosophy. The practice of bonsai embodies concepts like wabi-sabi, the beauty of imperfection and impermanence, and the balance and harmony between elements. The aesthetic principles in bonsai include asymmetry, proportion, and the natural appearance of the tree. The goal is to create a miniature representation of nature, capturing the essence of a full-sized tree in a small pot. Bonsai also involves a meditative aspect, as the care and styling of the tree require patience, attention to detail, and a deep connection with nature. Understanding the philosophy behind bonsai can enrich your experience and appreciation of this ancient art form. Whether you’re shaping the tree or simply observing its growth, bonsai offers a unique way to engage with nature and cultivate mindfulness.\n\nTransplanting (click for video)Although it can be super tempting, give your sprouts time to grow before putting them in a bonsai pot.
