        "text": "Please note that this is the Gundam Wiki's article on the television series; if you are looking for the article on the eponymous theory about human evolution from the series then you should head to SEED factor.\n\nMobile Suit Gundam SEED (機動戦士ガンダムSEED, Kidō Senshi Gandamu Shīdo?) is a 2002 anime television series created by Sunrise. It aired in Japan from October 5, 2002 to September 27, 2003 at 6:00 p.m. on the JNN TV stations (Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS TV), Mainichi Broadcasting System (MBS TV, producing TV station), etc.). The series had was remastered in High-Definition for its 10th year anniversary, omitting two recap phases. A new English dub was recorded for the western HD Remaster release in 2020. [1][2] It is available to be streamed on Crunchyroll and Funimation.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nIn the year 70 C.E., the war between PLANT and the Earth Alliance intensified when nuclear missiles were fired at the Junius Seven agricultural plant. The war, which was expected to end in victory for the Alliance, who had the advantage in terms of quantity, has been in a stalemate for 11 months.\n\nIn the year C.E. 71, Kira Yamato, a young Coordinator majoring in engineering, lives peacefully in the colony Heliopolis in the neutral nation of Orb. However, within the colony, the Alliance is secretly developing five MS and building a new battleship, and upon receiving this information, the ZAFT Le Creuset Team begins a unilateral operation to seize them. Kira's daily life changes drastically, and the colony is transformed into a battlefield. As Kira flees, he arrives at the MS factory and is confronted by a fierce firefight between Alliance and ZAFT soldiers. One of them was his childhood best friend, Athrun Zala.\n\nWith ZAFT having stolen four of the prototypes, Kira takes the GAT-X105 Strike Gundam and is forced to fight his old friend Athrun Zala. Little do they know that there are sinister forces at work that go far beyond their worst nightmares.\n\nCast[]\n\nAthrun Zala - Akira Ishida (Japanese), Samuel Vincent (English), Louie Paraboles (Tagalog)\n\nCagalli Yula Athha - Naomi Shindou (Japanese), Vanessa Morley (English)\n\nClotho Buer - Hiro Yuuki (Japanese), Andrew Toth (English)\n\nDearka Elsman - Akira Sasanuma (Japanese), Brad Swaile (English), Bernie Malejana (Tagalog)\n\nMartin DaCosta - Akira Sasanuma (Japanese), Brian Dobson (English)\n\nEzalia Joule - Kotono Mitsuishi (Japanese),\n\nHaro - Kotono Mitsuishi (Japanese), Tabitha St. Germain (English)\n\nMurrue Ramius - Kotono Mitsuishi (Japanese), Lisa Ann Beley (English)\n\nFlay Allster - Houko Kuwashima (Japanese), Tabitha St. Germain (English)\n\nNatarle Badgiruel - Houko Kuwashima (Japanese), Sarah Johns (English)\n\nKira Yamato - Souichirou Hoshi (Japanese), Matt Hill (English), Michael Punzalan (Tagalog)\n\nLacus Clyne - Rie Tanaka (Japanese), Chantal Strand (English)\n\nMiguel Aiman - Takanori Nishikawa (T.M.

Fukuda's previous directing work included Sunrise's car racing anime, Future GPX Cyber Formula. Despite Fukuda only being the director Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, a lot of frames of animation in the series are reminiscent of previous anime he had worked on; be it animator as with Brave, or director as with Future GPX Cyber Formula. This is because a usual colleague of Fukuda is animator Satoshi Shigeta, who, like Fukuda, worked with and learned from Obari. Satoshi is noted for the sparks and flame embers in beam saber clashes and beam rifle hits during Mobile Suits Battles, which he originally developed as erupting from engines when animating Future GPX Cyber Formula.[3]\n\nThe lead writer for the series is the late Chiaki Morosawa, Fukuda's wife who died in February 2016.\n\nThemes & Reactions[]\n\nThe series was widely acclaimed upon release,[4][5] and has left a great legacy upon the otaku community of Japan and abroad. Some of the major characters were Top 10 favorite character lists of Newtype magazine 12 years after the initial run,[6] and the merchandise sold in the millions.[7]\n\nThe series was intended to be the 21st Century Gundam[8] updated for a new generation of fans, with other elements from previous series added into the mix. The similarities between the original Mobile Suit Gundam and this series are by far the most numerous. To fit the tastes of 21st century viewers, themes based on the elements surrounding present day situations were incorporated namely the 9/11 attacks, Fukuda speaks of an unbroken cycle of hatred since Christ's death with justice on both sides (Muslim and non-Muslim).[9] The series primarily focused on the interpersonal relationships between the characters,[9][10] resulting in many layered romantic friendships. The series is guided by the traumatic friendship between pilots Kira Yamato and Athrun Zala.\n\nThe inclusion of issues such as racism, with desires of genocide, further updated the series and provided food for thought as well as social commentary. The genetically altered Coordinators provide a vision for the future in a world fraught with talk of GM food and cloning.\n\nRelease[]\n\nThe series is licensed by Bandai Entertainment, and was released on DVD in North America in uncut bilingual format. An edited version of the English dub premiered during the Toonami block at 10:30 p.m. on Saturday nights, it was pushed back to 1:00 am on Friday nights starting with Phase 27 due to below average ratings.[citation needed]\n\nThe majority of the series was aired with a TV-Y7, apparently, at the insistence of Bandai who were desperately trying to push the new Gundam SEED toy line. However, since most retailers had stopped carrying the Gundam line due to over-saturation from the G Gundam series, this soon became a lost cause. Only the final episode was given the TV-PG-SV rating rather than the usual TV-Y7 rating.\n\nThings that were edited out on Cartoon Network include mature content (ex. most references to the sexual relationship between Kira and Flay—though the initial scene presenting this was left partially intact); scenes of intense combat violence (ex. almost all shots of pilots, including main characters, in their cockpits before having their machines destroyed); cold-blooded or brutal murders that are non-mobile suit related (ex. Siegel Clyne getting shot by ZAFT soldiers loyal to Rau Le Creuset and Patrick Zala); all references to the fact that the Living CPUs need to take performance enhancing drugs; and most notoriously, handguns being sloppily and inconsistently transformed into neon-colored lasers, dubbed \"Disco Guns\" by fans, for the majority of the show's run. Also, there was little to no use of the words \"kill\" or \"die\" in the middle of the series airing. Since most of the series had been edited by Williams Street before broadcast, Cartoon Network changed very little in terms of content allowance. However, the airings of the final two episodes were left mostly unedited, with only a few elements being affected—namely the guns used by Azrael, Patrick Zala, and one of the ZAFT soldiers (which was given neon-colored lights in certain but not all of the image frames), airbrushing the naked Flay's body in the final episode to avoid showing her cleavage, reducing the amount of blood shown, editing the character's lines; to remove either inappropriate language or controversial lines, and the removal or altering of flashbacks of graphic assassinations. The Canadian version debuted on YTV's Bionix block in September 2004 at 9:30 p.m. where it got a better reception and aired comparatively uncut, with almost all of the material listed above intact.\n\nIn Japan, it occupied the Saturday 6 p.m. timeslot on MBS and TBS, widely considered a prime timeslot; the anime and its subsequent successor to the timeslot (Full Metal Alchemist) went on to do very well.\n\nIn the Philippines, the show was aired on ABS-CBN last December 20, 2004. First shown on the 6 pm primetime block on Weekdays (Mondays-Fridays), it was later moved to the 5:30 pm slot on the same day frame until it's End last March 4, 2005. Currently, it airs on ABS-CBN's Cable Anime Channel, Hero TV every Friday at 10:30 am, 5:30 pm and 11:30 pm, and in Cartoon Network Philippines every Saturday and Sunday at 10:30 pm (double episodes) (all times in Philippine Standard Time [GMT+8])\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the dub aired on the now defunct Anime Central satellite television channel.\n\nHD Remaster[]\n\nOn December 23, 2011, the HD Remaster premiered on Bandai Channel and began airing every Friday at 11:00 JST (02:00 GMT) and was simulcasted on the GundamInfo YouTube Channel with English, Korean, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese subtitles allowing foreign viewers to watch it for free, although the 1080p Full HD resolution was converted to 480p. In Japan it also premiered on on BS11: 1/1/2012 (airing on Sundays - 19:30) and Tokyo MX: 1/3/2012 (airing on Tuesdays - 22:29).[11] For the HD Remaster, a English dub was recorded at NYAV Post.[12]\n\nFree streaming on YouTube was made available again for a limited time from, April 4, 2017.[13] Crunchyroll has provided 1080p streaming of the HD Remaster since May 24, 2017.\n\nThe HD remaster has been since streamed indefinitely since 2022 on Youtube alongide the HD remaster of Gundam SEED Destiny after the GundamInfo channel reached 2 million subscribers, but the series got removed from the Gundam Info channel at the beginning of February 2024 for unknown reasons despite no longer being a limited time streaming with the HD Remaster of Gundam SEED Destiny remaining on the channel, but due to the fans uproar of the series removal, the series returned to Youtube on March 1st 2024.\n\nThe HD Remaster received additional changes with the Japanese Blu-ray release. Initially, Nozomi Entertainment were given the HDTV masters for their Blu-ray release, however, this will be corrected and those who purchased before the mistake was spotted will receive new discs. Similarly, when the English dub of the HD Remaster was made available on Funimation on November 25, 2020 it was also using the HDTV master not the Japanese Blu-ray master.\n\nAdaptations, Spin-offs & Sequels[]\n\nA three-part compilation of the TV series has been released as Gundam SEED: Special Edition. The English manga, authored by Masatsugu Iwase, is published in North America by Del Rey Manga and in Singapore by Chuang Yi, while Gundam SEED Astray, a spin-off of Gundam SEED, is published in North America by Tokyopop.\n\nAn adaptation of the TV series, authored by Mizuho Takayama, was originally as supplement of Comic BomBom. This version comes with folding color posters of the Mobile Suits, and a bonus Gundam SEED Destiny episode 0 comic. The stories were eventually published into 2 volumes by Kodansha. The 2-volume version is available in Chinese, published by Rightman Publishing Ltd. in Hong Kong.\n\nThe TV series was also turned into a series of novels by Riu Koto, published by Kadokawa Shoten.\n\nAlso running with the series was a series of manga called Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Astray that told a side-story to the anime series. This proved popular enough to generate two more side-stories: Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Astray R and Mobile Suit Gundam SEED X Astray.\n\nOn July 6, 2004 the sequel to Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, was announced after over a month of rumors. It started airing in Japan on October 2004 on the network Mainichi Broadcasting System and ran until October 1, 2005. A third Gundam SEED production, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED C.E. 73:STARGAZER, an ONA side-story to Destiny, is currently being streamed on Bandai Channel. The epilogue film Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Freedom was released on January 26th 2024.\n\nSEED was re-released during the HD remastering project for its 10th anniversary: While most scenes were reused for the Special Edition release, some scenes are redrawn, effects such as beam weapon shots were touched up for larger TV's (bars of solid color now have extra fine details and graduated color changes across the beam), some scenes are upscaled and cropped from the original 4:3 aspect ratio while others (like computer console displays of text or graphics) have extra detail added to the sides (such as the edges of the console itself) to make them into widescreen aspect without the console content loss which would occur from cropping. New mobile suits were also added such as the Perfect Strike.\n\nGallery[]\n\nNotes & Trivia[]\n\nIn the episode Burning Sandstorm, a scene showed Kira in his room putting on his uniform while Flay wakes up on the bed naked and watches him leave before laughing maniacally, implying that they had sex in the period between The Respective Solitudes and this episode. This scene gave parents in Japan a scare and caused a good deal of controversy at the time due to the time slot and age of the characters (being fifteen and fourteen, respectively), and the directors were reprimanded for this scene. For the Gundam SEED Special Edition, a decision was made to animate a new sequence showing Kira and Flay having sex together, inserted during the Strike’s fight in the desert. The scenes were included in the HD Remaster of the series.\n\nIn the episodes On a Calm Day, when Cagalli finished the flight simulator the screen read \"Lanking\" and \"Kagali\".\n\nIn the episode In the Promised Land, the investigation report Captain Sutherland holds in his hands at JOSH-A, Alaska shows Kira to hold the rank of Lieutenant, he actually holds the rank of Ensign. The discharge paper given to Kira, which he tears up, identifies his rank as \"Second Lieutenant\", which is equivalent to \"Ensign\".\n\nThe word 'Gundam' is only used by four characters over the course of the entire series: Kira Yamato, who just uses the acronym for Strike Gundam's OS, Kuzzey Buskirk shortly after Kira's initial sortie in the Strike, when he says \"This 'Gundam' thing is awesome\" Murrue Ramius and Lacus Clyne, the latter of whom only uses it twice: When Kira sees the Freedom, he mutters \"Gundam...\", in response to which Lacus explains that \"actually, it's the ZGMF-X10A Freedom. But I like the 'Gundam'. It sounds strong.\" and later she says it to Athrun when he receives the Justice. Mu La Flaga also used the word once, when asking Kojiro Murdoch why Kira called it that.\n\nMany Mobile Suits in the Cosmic Era timeline (especially Ace-Suits) have the small 'V' on their frame. Mobile Suits developed by the Earth Alliance have the 'V' in the same location as the RX-78-2 Gundam, the crotch, while ZAFT Mobile Suits tend to have it on the torso instead. The 'V' is a direct reference to the UC Timeline, where all Mobile Suits based on Gundam have the 'V'-shaped crest (up until Char's Counterattack, at least).\n\nAlong with its sequel, Gundam SEED Destiny, Gundam SEED is the Gundam series that scored the most brilliant achievements in Animage's Anime Grand Prix. It won the 1st place in 2002, 2004 and 2005, and selected as the runner up in 2003 and 2006. Other Gundam series that come up to Gundam SEED's achievements are the original Mobile Suit Gundam (won the 1st place twice), followed by Zeta Gundam, Gundam ZZ, Gundam Wing and Gundam 00 (each won the second place once).\n\nGundam SEED, as well as its sequel and expanded universe, shows many references and nods to another popular sci-fi series, Star Trek. The show itself can be compared to the classic Star Trek episode Space Seed, as well as its follow up movie Wrath of Khan. Both series' central themes revolve around the creation of a genetically altered and superior race of humans. This \"superiority\" of the new race of humans causes fear and misunderstanding amongst normal humans. In both series, this friction ends with the banishment of the new humans to outer space. Also, both the followers of Khan, and the Coordinator's ultimate weapon were called Genesis.\n\nThe relationship between Mu La Flaga, Murrue Ramius, and Natarle Badgiruel is much like the relationship of Star Trek's Power Trio of Captain Tiberius Kirk, Dr. Leonard McCoy, and Spock, respectively. Rau Le Crueset can also be compared to that of Khan.\n\nThere are also parallels to Star Wars, for example, protagonist Kira Yamato was raised by his aunt and uncle whereas his secret twin sister, Cagalli, was adopted by politicians and ends up falling in love with Kira's best friend, Athrun Zala who fills the role of Han Solo. The final battle involves them destroying a ZAFT superweapon similar to the Death Star (albeit on a smaller scale). In an interview in 2003, creator Fukuda revealed himself to be a fan of Star Wars,\n\nGundam SEED is actually quite infamous concerning its roles in the various Super Robot Wars games. Its first appearance, in Super Robot Wars Alpha 3, was known for the fact that it was forced to be put in by Bandai, apparently scuttling plans for Gundam Sentinel to be used.
