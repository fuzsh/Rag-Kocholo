        "text": "Hopi Blue Corn seeds produce stunningly colored corn that can grow over 5′ tall. Its ears are adorned in deep, dark purple, blue, and almost black kernels. Use it to make corn flour for remarkable blue tortillas, cornbread, and more! Hopi Blue Corn is beautiful when used for ornamental purposes too.\n\nPlanting by Zones\n\nZones 9-10\n\nCorn is a warm season crop that should be grown when soils have reached a minimum temperature of 65°F. This occurs in mid-May in Zones 9 and 10. It will not germinate well in cold soils.\n\nPlanting Hopi Blue Corn Seeds\n\nCorn seed is very easy to direct sow. For Zones 9 and 10, sow seeds in deeply irrigated soils to guarantee even and quick germination. Plant seeds every 3″, thinning later to 6″ apart.\n\nFertilize regularly with an organic liquid fertilizer once the seedlings have germinated and are about 4″ tall.\n\nIf transplanting out, plant in the garden when it is 6-7″ tall. Space at least 6″ apart. Plant in full sun.\n\nSuccession Planting Corn\n\nPlant every 10-days for a continuous crop to harvest.\n\nGrowing Corn\n\nFor healthy kernel development, you must ensure good pollination. Pollination happens when pollen from the tassels falls onto the silks. To ensure this, corn must be planted in blocks, and you must plant at least 10 plants to get a good yield. Plants can be grown very close together if you are planting in a small space.\n\nCorn requires adequate moisture and moderately fertile soil to produce a healthy crop. Side dress with a granular organic fertilizer if you believe your soil has low fertility.\n\nGrowing Corn in Containers\n\nDo not grow in a container unless you can fit a minimum of ten plants in the size of the container being used.\n\nHarvesting Corn\n\nCorn is harvested differently depending on the type you grow.\n\nSweet Corn is harvested when the peak sugar has condensed in each kernel—ears will feel firm and full. Other signs of maturity are dry silks and ears that are tilted from the stem. You can peel back the silk and squeeze a kernel. If the liquid that comes out is milky, it’s ready! Keep in mind the quality of sweet corn declines if you let it stay on the stalk too long. Sugar contents turn to starch, making the corn less appealing to eat fresh. If this happens to you, simply use the corn in cooking applications like corn chowder, corn cakes, or other recipes.\n\nPopcorn/Mill Corn and Dent Corn are left to mature on the cob. As they mature, the silks will dry out. These types can be stored dry until needed. Popcorn can be popped by placing the whole cob (husked) in the microwave in a brown paper bag.\n\nSouthern California Pro-tips\n\nIn areas of Zones 9 and 10, corn can be succession planted several times for a harvest that can be enjoyed all year long!\n\nAphids and ants are the most common corn issues in Southern California. Refer to UC IPM.\n\nCompanion Flowers/Crops\n\nCorn is a tall plant that is planted in blocks. For this reason, smaller bushy plants planted on the perimeter of your corn patch will bring beneficial insects and make your corn patch even more beautiful. Plant zinnias, sunflowers, and amaranth around your corn.\n\nAdditional Learning Resources"
