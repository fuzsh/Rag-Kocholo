        "text": "The beginning of 2009 brought no signs of relief as Oklahoma continued to be in a moderate drought from 2008. Impacts of the drought included wildfires and extremely low creek levels. Several streams across southern Oklahoma, such as Buffalo and Antelope Springs, were completely dry to start the year.\n\nBoth New Year's Day 2005 and 2006 set warm temperature records in Oklahoma City. On January 1, 2006, a record high of 77 degrees occurred. One year earlier, the temperature only fell to 56 degrees, which set a record for the warmest low.\n\nOn January 1st and 2nd of 1993, an intense storm system brought accumulations of sleet and freezing rain to much of the region. The icy weather caused numerous traffic accidents, including a 35-car pile-up in Oklahoma City shortly after midnight. The ice also caused havoc with area airport operations. Two passenger jets slid off icy runways at Will Rogers World Airport.\n\nJanuary 2, 2004, was a warm day across western north Texas as the mercury soared to 80 degrees at Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita Falls. This high temperature broke a 17-year record by 1 degree for the warmest temperature for that date.\n\nIn 1996, the new year was brought in on a snowy note. On the 1st and 2nd, a strong storm system dumped up to 6 inches of snow over a large part of southern, through northeast Oklahoma. The hardest hit areas extended from near Durant and Ada, northeast toward Tulsa. Over central Oklahoma, down into western north Texas, a glaze of ice was seen, with several accidents reported in the Oklahoma City area.\n\nThe coldest Oklahoma temperature of 2019 occurred on this day in the Oklahoma Panhandle near Guymon. The temperature bottomed out at minus 6 degrees Fahrenheit. With a gusty north wind, the wind chill dropped to minus 17.\n\nA series of storm systems brought heavy snow and bitterly cold arctic air to the southern plains during the week of January 4th through 11th, in 1988. A large portion of Oklahoma received at least 10 inches of snow, with North Texas receiving up to 3 inches. Some locations across western Oklahoma measured 16-to-18-inch total amounts over the period, with snow drifts reaching 4 feet. Oklahoma City totaled 12.1 inches of snow over a three-day period, from the 5th to the 7th, which is Oklahoma City's second highest storm total accumulation. Accompanying the heavy snow were record-breaking cold temperatures. The mercury dropped below the freezing mark on the 4th in Oklahoma City, and stayed there until the afternoon of the 11th. The lowest temperature in Oklahoma City during the period came on the morning of the 8th, when a low of 4 below zero was reached.\n\nOn January 7, 2008, a series of powerful storms tracked across the area during the late afternoon and evening hours. The storms were triggered by a powerful cold front ahead of an unseasonably moist and unstable airmass. Numerous hail reports occurred, with the largest being 1-inch in diameter. Storm wind gusts reached 70 mph and two F0 tornadoes were reported across eastern Oklahoma. Fortunately, no injuries or significant damages were reported.\n\nCold weather was seen on this day in 2017, with extremely cold temperatures and wind chills over the Oklahoma Panhandle. Early in the day, the temperature dropped to a frigid 19 degrees below zero at Kenton, which was the coldest temperature recorded in the state of Oklahoma that year. On the same day, winds created wind chill values of 28 degrees below zero in Hooker, just east of Kenton.\n\nJanuary 7th, 1944, marks the third-greatest calendar day snowfall at Oklahoma City. The 9 inches that accumulated are surpassed only by the 13.5 inches that occurred on December 24th of 2009, and 11.3 inches that occurred on March 19th of 1924.\n\nA strong cold front moved into the region on this date in 2017, dropping temperatures 20 to 30 degrees in a very short amount of time. In Arnett, just southwest of Woodward in northwest Oklahoma, the temperature fell from 67 degrees to 37 degrees in just one hour. With strong northerly winds to make the 37 degrees feel even colder, these events can go from a nice day to dangerous cold if you are not prepared.\n\nBack in 1963, bitter cold and high winds swept through Oklahoma and northern Texas on January 10th through 14th. Subzero temperatures would eventually cover the northwestern three-quarters of Oklahoma, with much of northern Texas only slightly above zero. In the Oklahoma Panhandle, Boise City plummeted to a low temperature of 17 below zero. Wind chill readings dropped to between twenty and forty degrees below zero.\n\nTwo consecutive days of very strong northerly winds were seen across the region on January 14th and 15th, 2021. Nearly persistent winds of 40 to 50 mph were seen for two days, with some areas of western Oklahoma experiencing occasional gusts around 60 mph. This resulted in areas of blowing dust and a few wildfires due to power line arcing. What was somewhat unusual for this event in January was that the winds were not associated with arctic air. While the north winds brought in colder air, the temperatures did not deviate far from average for the first part of January.\n\nOn this date in 1960, it seemed more like April than January, when an intense line of thunderstorms raced through the region. Winds up to 75 mph brought widespread damage to roofs and utilities. A funnel cloud was followed for 3.5 miles over the western edge of Oklahoma City, while a tornado damaged three farmsteads southeast of Fitzhugh, in Pontotoc County. The winds were not finished however, as an intense low-pressure system roared through later in the day. Again, winds of 75 mph blew out plate glass windows in Lawton, Purcell, Yukon, and Oklahoma City.\n\nOn January 16th through 18th back in 1987, a winter storm brought heavy snow to much of western and northwest Oklahoma. Accumulations as high as 14 inches were reported. Southwest Oklahoma and western north Texas experienced a significant ice storm, where as much as 2 inches of ice combined with several inches of snow to cause numerous traffic accidents and downed power lines.\n\nArctic air surged over the Southern Plains on the 16th and 17th of January 2018. Along with wind chill values below zero for much of the day on the 16th, low temperatures on the morning of the 17th also dipped below zero. The lowest temperature in Oklahoma was negative 7.6 degrees at Miami, in far northeast Oklahoma.\n\nThe coldest month on record in Oklahoma City, and much of Oklahoma for that matter, dates back to January, 1930. The month started fairly mild with highs in the 50s and 60s. Then, the bottom dropped out as an arctic front blasted through the area on the 6th. The bitterly cold air was then reinforced by even colder air several times throughout the month. In fact, the low temperatures in Oklahoma City would dip below zero five times over a two-week span during the middle of the month. The coldest temperatures over the area were seen on the mornings of the 17th and 18th, when the mercury in Oklahoma City plunged to 9 degrees below zero. This is warm compared to the incredibly cold readings in northeast Oklahoma, where Watts recorded a low of minus 27 degrees on the morning of the 18th.\n\nOn January 21, 2005, Oklahomans and North-Texans kept their coats in the closet, as an unseasonably warm airmass allowed afternoon temperatures to climb into the 70s. A 37-year-old record was broken at Oklahoma City, as the temperature soared to 77 degrees, breaking the 1967 record by 6 degrees.\n\nOn this date in 1966, much of southwest and south-central Oklahoma was hit with heavy snow for the second time in two days. Snowfall totals on this day were in the 4-to-6-inch range along the Red River, from near Hollis, to Altus, to Waurika. Similar totals occurred in these areas two days earlier, on the 19th. Snow totals for both storms included 11 inches at Waurika and 10.4 inches at Altus.\n\nWhile January 1930 was the coldest on record in Oklahoma City, the warmest January on record occurred in 1923. Every day in the month had above average temperatures. Overall, 16 of the 31 days had afternoon high temperatures at or above 60 degrees, with three days topping 70. The warmest temperature of the month came on the 13th, when the mercury soared to a balmy 72, after a morning low of 47. The coldest temperature all month was only 24 degrees.\n\nThe coldest month ever in Wichita Falls, and the fifth coldest January in Oklahoma City, was January 1978. An arctic front swept through Oklahoma and north Texas during the day on the 7th. Surges of even colder air would continue to plunge southward well into February. In fact, in Oklahoma City, the average daily temperatures would stay below average until the 24th of February, one of the longer such periods in Oklahoma City history.\n\nA severe dust storm swept across the southern High Plains into Oklahoma on this date in 1965. Visibility dropped to near zero in parts of west Texas and western Oklahoma. Winds gusted to 55 mph in Oklahoma City, and 75 mph in Lubbock. The blowing dust eventually spread as far east as Pennsylvania.\n\nA powerful winter storm struck Oklahoma and northern Texas on January 28th and 29th of 2010. Much of Oklahoma and western north Texas saw heavy amounts of snow, ice, sleet, or a combination of the three. Although snow totals of 6 inches to a foot were seen over the Oklahoma Panhandle and northern portions of Oklahoma, the greatest impact was the severe ice accumulations. The greatest amounts of ice were seen from the Red River Valley of southwest Oklahoma, up into central Oklahoma. This had significant impacts from Quanah and Altus, up through Lawton, Hobart, and Fort Cobb, where over an inch of ice accumulation was seen. In addition to widespread tree devastation, damage and recovery costs easily exceeded $15 million.\n\nIt was mild and dry across the region in January 2013. A reminder of the warm weather is the record temperatures at Wichita Falls on January 28th. Wichita Falls set a record warm-minimum temperature for the day at 58 degrees and a record maximum temperature of 81 degrees. The average low and high for Wichita Falls on January 28th are 30 degrees and 55 degrees, respectively.\n\nOne of the coldest Januarys on record in the southern plains came during the year 1977. In Oklahoma City, the temperature plunged to 9 degrees by midnight on the 9th, and was well on its way to a record 2 below zero later that morning. In fact, record low temperatures were set in both Wichita Falls and Oklahoma City on the mornings of the 9th and 10th. On the 10th, Oklahoma City bottomed out at minus 3. At Wichita Falls, the mercury dropped to 4 degrees on the 9th, and minus 1 on the 10th.\n\nA significant ice storm commenced on this date in 2002, resulting in over $300 million in damages, and widespread power outages. The hardest hit areas extended from near Ponca City, Perry, and Stillwater, south and west through Enid, Kingfisher, Guthrie, Binger, and Weatherford. Some of the smaller towns and rural residents were without power for weeks.\n\nFor all but far southwest Oklahoma and western north Texas, the month of January in 2019 was one of the wetter Januarys in recent memory. A majority of the precipitation fell in the first two weeks of the month, and mainly near and east of Interstate 35. While western Oklahoma and western north Texas saw precipitation amounts slightly below average, parts of northeast and central Oklahoma saw more than double the normal amount. A big snow storm on January 3rd blanketed much of the region with 2 to 4 inches of snow, with respectable rain amounts where snow did not occur.\n\nOn this date in 2014, which happened to be Groundhog's Day, a significant winter storm impacted parts of Oklahoma and northern Texas. Much of southwest Oklahoma and western north Texas picked up the greatest amounts of snow with totals averaging around 6 inches. Locations from around Crowell, Truscott, and Chillicothe, Texas, reported between 8 inches and a foot of snow. Locations farther north and east toward Clinton and the Oklahoma City metro generally saw 2 to 4 inches. Northern Oklahoma missed out on any snow accumulations. A glaze of ice fell over southeastern Oklahoma before sleet and snow began to fall, resulting in totals of a couple of inches. Significant icing was not reported.\n\nOn this date in 1985, residents of Wichita Falls experienced the second coldest day ever, and the coldest in the month of February. The mercury plunged to a frigid 8 degrees below zero during the early morning hours.\n\nWeather can change quickly in Oklahoma. On February 2, 2003, the city of Altus broke state records as the mercury soared to 87 degrees. Six days later, in Fort Supply, the mercury plunged to a reading of 6 degrees below zero.\n\nOn this date in 1982, an intense winter storm dropped heavy snow over portions of northwest Oklahoma. The heaviest accumulation was reported in Woods County, where the observer at Waynoka recorded 18 inches.\n\nAfter a strong winter storm affected southern Oklahoma and northern Texas with heavy snow just two days earlier, another storm followed on this date in 2014, bringing heavy snows to northern parts of Oklahoma. Although the heaviest snows were seen north of the Kansas-Oklahoma border, several places across northern and western Oklahoma reported up to 8 inches of snow. Farther south, less snow was reported with little to no snow accumulation south of Interstate-40. Once the storm system vacated the area, a bitterly cold airmass swept in, bringing record cold temperatures and wind chills well below zero to the region.\n\nA strong winter storm struck mainly northern parts of Oklahoma on this day in 2004. Snowfall totals reached six to seven inches over areas from Alva and Orienta, to Medford and Wakita. Other snow totals included five inches in Woodward and Waynoka, and four inches in Watonga, Cherokee, and Arapaho. Rain and sleet were the primary form of precipitation over central and southern parts of Oklahoma, but Oklahoma City, Duncan, Ardmore, and Ada were able to receive at least a trace of snow.\n\nA winter storm brought snow to much of Oklahoma on this date in 1983. The heaviest accumulations were in Sayre, where 6.5 inches fell, and in Ada, where 5 inches was reported. Snowfall amounts of 3 to 4 inches were reported as far east as Tulsa and McAlester, and as far south as Lawton and Sulphur.\n\nA quick moving winter storm brought a period of light to moderate snow to the northern half of Oklahoma during the morning of the 6th in 2003. Areas north of Interstate 40 received an average of 1 to 2 inches of snow. However, a narrow band of 4-to-6-inch accumulations affected northwest and west-central Oklahoma. Thomas, in Custer County, received 6 inches, while Fargo, in Ellis County, received 5.5 inches.\n\nOn this date in 2020, Oklahoma saw the coldest temperatures for that year. As arctic air spread over the region in the days prior, clear skies and light winds on the early morning hours of the 6th brought widespread single and teen readings. The coldest site was Tipton, in southwest Oklahoma, where the low temperatures fell to 1 degree above zero Fahrenheit.\n\nOn February 8th and 9th back in 1994, one of the more significant ice storms in recent memory struck Oklahoma. Freezing rain and sleet covered much of the eastern two-thirds of the state with a significant ice accumulation. The hardest hit areas were in south-central and southeast Oklahoma, where ice accumulations of nearly an inch were reported. The icy roads caused major traffic problems. In the Oklahoma City metro area alone, there were over 300 vehicle accidents.\n\nTornadoes can occur any time of the year, even in mid-winter. Duncan was hit by a tornado on this date in 1966. Two people were injured when a church wall collapsed at 14th and Main, crushing their car.\n\nFresh on the heels of a record-setting blizzard that occurred from January 31st to February 1st of the same year, another significant winter storm affected the Southern Plains on this date in 2011. Snowfall totals reached a foot or more over north-central and northeast Oklahoma, with widespread totals of 4 to 8 inches over at least the northern two-thirds of the state. Spavinaw, in far northeast Oklahoma, recorded an all-time greatest 24-hr snowfall total for the state of Oklahoma when they recorded 27 inches. Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City managed almost 6 inches of snow. Farther south, across the Red River Valley and northern Texas, snow totals of 1 to 4 inches were seen.\n\nThe lowest barometric pressure ever recorded in Oklahoma City occurred on February 9th, 1960. The sea level pressure dropped to an incredibly low 28.81 inches of mercury. Winds of 60 to 70 mph accompanied the deep low-pressure center, causing widespread damage across much of Oklahoma, and northern and western Texas. Blowing dust reduced visibilities to near zero in western Oklahoma.\n\nOn February 10th, 2009, a deadly tornado struck Jefferson, Love, and Carter Counties in southern Oklahoma. The tornado appeared to reach its maximum width and intensity as it approached and moved through the town of Lone Grove. Eight people were killed by this tornado, and 46 were injured. Six of the fatalities occurred in mobile homes; one occurred in a well-built home that sustained EF4 damage, and one person died in a vehicle. At least 114 homes were damaged or destroyed, with at least 3500 losing power in and around Carter County. Debris from this tornado was picked up as far away as Sulphur. The EF4 tornado went on record as the deadliest tornado in February for the state of Oklahoma and the deadliest day for the United States for 2009.\n\nA deep snow pack, combined with clear skies and light winds can lead to very cold overnight temperatures. Keeping with the theme of extremes during the 2011 winter, the low temperatures on the 10th were nothing short of frigid, with numerous low temperature records set, some of them all-time record lows. Before midnight on the 9th, some locations across far northern Oklahoma reported temperatures colder than minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit. By 7:30 AM on the 10th, a wide area of minus 10 to minus 15-degree temperatures were reported over the northern-third of Oklahoma. A few of those sites were colder than minus 20 degrees. Nowata broke the all-time low record for the state of Oklahoma, falling to minus 31 degrees. The second best was Pryor and Bartlesville, falling to minus 28 degrees. Blackwell and Medford were not far behind at minus 27 degrees. Oklahoma City saw the temperature fall to minus 5 degrees, breaking their daily record by 9 degrees. Wichita Falls, Texas reached their record low temperature, although they remained slightly above zero. The temperature of 3 degrees broke the previous record of 5 degrees.\n\nOn this date back in 1999, widespread dense fog, from western north Texas through central Oklahoma, resulted in numerous traffic accidents. With some visibilities down to just several feet, multiple car pile-ups occurred in the Wichita Falls and Lawton areas.\n\nThe first part of February 2017 was quite warm across Oklahoma and adjacent parts of Texas. On this date in 2017, widespread temperatures in the 70s and 80s were reported, with some 90s across southwest Oklahoma and western north Texas. The Oklahoma Mesonet observation site near Mangum, in southwest Oklahoma north of Altus, recorded a high temperature of 99 degrees. This tied for the highest wintertime temperature ever recorded in Oklahoma.\n\nAfter a relatively warm and dry January across Oklahoma and western north Texas, the first significant winter storm of 2013 began affecting the region on the evening of February 11. By sunrise on the 12th, moderate and heavy snow was falling across most of western Oklahoma. Most of the snow was seen near and west of Interstate-44 in Oklahoma, where snow totals were one inch or greater. Widespread amounts greater than four inches occurred across far western Oklahoma, with the highest totals near the Texas border west of Elk City and Mangum, where as much as nine inches were measured.\n\nWichita Falls, Texas eclipsed its all-time seasonal snowfall record on February 11, 2010 when 5.5 inches of snow was measured, bringing the 2009-2010 seasonal total to 14.8 inches. On average, Wichita Falls receives 5.5 inches of snow every winter.\n\nOn February 10th and 11th in the year 1972, a snowstorm blanketed much of Oklahoma with up to 6 inches of snow.\n\nOn this date in 1905, very cold temperatures were recorded over the state of Oklahoma. The low temperature at Vinita plummeted to 27 degrees below zero. This temperature would later be tied in the city of Watts in January, 1930, and at Blackwell and Medford in February, 2011. The negative 27-degree reading is low enough to be the 2nd lowest temperature on record in Oklahoma. The coldest is negative 31 degrees, recorded at Nowata on February 10th, 2011.\n\nOn this date in 2017, Mangum, Oklahoma reached a high of 99 degrees. This temperature tied the highest reading ever recorded during the month of February or winter in Oklahoma. It tied the 99-degree record that occurred at Arapaho way back on February 24, 1918.\n\nA bitterly cold arctic airmass moved over the region on February 8th, 2020 and colder air just kept flowing into the region over the next several days. In addition, storm systems passed through and blanketed much of the region with at least half a foot of snow. As skies began to clear and winds diminish, a very cold few days was forecast for the 14th and 15th. On the 15th that year, the overall statewide average temperature (all the highs and lows averaged together) fell down to -0.4 degrees Fahrenheit to beat the December 22nd, 1989 average of 1.9 degrees as the coldest day in state history. Even if you combine the 14th and 15th from 2020, you still get the second lowest two-day average temperature of 3.1 degrees Fahrenheit, just shy of the all-time coldest two-day average of 2.7 degrees set on December 22nd and 23rd in 1989.\n\nPeriods of freezing rain fell across much of southern and southwest Oklahoma from late evening of the 14th through mid-morning of the 16th in 2002, with many areas receiving one to two tenths of an inch of ice. As a result, a 30-car pileup occurred near the intersection of Interstate 40 and Interstate 44 in Oklahoma County, resulting in 2 fatalities. Numerous other accidents resulted in 3 additional fatalities across the area before the freezing rain ended.\n\nThe arctic intrusion during the middle portion of February 2021 broke numerous records, making it one of the coldest periods in Oklahoma and northern Texas history. On this date that year, numerous locations across the region broke record low temperatures, most below zero. At Lawton, the low temperature was minus12 degrees Fahrenheit, breaking the all-time record low temperature for that location. It broke the previous all-time record cold temperature of minus 11 degrees, set in 1930. At Oklahoma City, the temperature dropped to minus 14 degrees Fahrenheit, making it the second coldest temperature recorded for Oklahoma City. The official coldest temperature recorded for Oklahoma City is minus 17 degrees, set in 1899.\n\nFebruary of 1913 was the 6th snowiest month ever in Oklahoma City when a total of 12.9 inches of snow fell on the city. However, it is the 2nd snowiest February in Oklahoma City, behind 2011 when 18.9 inches of snow accumulated.\n\nOn this date in 2021, the high temperature at Oklahoma City official climbed above 20 degrees Fahrenheit, to reach 22 degrees, for the first time since the 8th of the month. The 8 consecutive days of temperatures at or below 20 degrees was a record stretch for Oklahoma City. It broke the record of 5 consecutive days back in December of 1983.\n\nOn this date in 2011, numerous record high temperatures were measured across the region. Oklahoma City made it up to 80 degrees, while Wichita Falls saw the mercury rise to 84 degrees. While these are definitely not the warmest temperatures we have seen ever seen in February, they were very different than the temperatures seen just a week earlier, when both locations set record low temperatures of minus 5 and 3 degrees, respectively. Nowata, Oklahoma reached 79 degrees, which was a 110-degree swing in temperature over record lows seen on the 10th.\n\nOn this date back in 2016, very warm temperatures, southwest winds of 30 to 40 mph, and very dry air fueled a large wildfire just northwest of Buffalo, in far northwest Oklahoma. The fire started just west of Buffalo near Doby Springs and spread quickly northeast. The wildfire burned approximately 17,280 acres in Oklahoma before moving into Kansas.\n\nFebruary 1905 in Wichita Falls marks one of the snowiest months ever for that city. The month began with a snowfall of 3 inches on the 1st. It was followed a week later with 8 inches on the 7th, then as much as 9 inches on the 18th. All three of these snow totals still stand as record daily snowfalls for Wichita Falls area, and the 9 inches on the 18th still stands as the all-time calendar day snowfall for the entire month of February.\n\nToday marks the anniversary of the beginning of one of the most significant winter storms in Oklahoma history. The blizzard of 1971 began on the evening of February 20th, over northwest Oklahoma, and would go on to produce a state-record storm total snowfall of 36 inches in Buffalo. Other storm totals for this extraordinary event, which left drifts up to 20 feet high, include 25 inches at Gage, 18 inches in Enid, 17 inches in Woodward, and 10 inches in Ponca City. The rest of Oklahoma fared much better, with only 4.9 inches in Oklahoma City, 2.7 inches in Tulsa, and 1 inch in McAlester. Even the western panhandle missed the brunt of this storm. Boise City picked up only a little over 3 inches, and Kenton only 2 inches.\n\nOn this date in 2012, severe thunderstorms moved over Oklahoma during the afternoon hours. Hail to the size of golf balls and damaging wind gusts affected areas from Enid down into the Oklahoma City metro. Several power and light poles were blown over in Edmond, and a construction crane was blown into the Devon Tower in Oklahoma City, damaging some of the glass panes. No injuries were reported with these storms. Unfortunately, as the storms built down into southern Oklahoma, an intense microburst occurred just east of Ada, destroying a mobile home and killing one of its occupants.\n\nOn February 20, 1987, a severe winter storm struck portions of North Texas. The worst of the storm was felt across Montague and Jack Counties, where up to 8 inches of snow was reported.\n\nFrom February 20th to 22nd of 1971, one of the worst snowstorms in Oklahoma history dumped up to 3 feet of snow on northwest Oklahoma. By the time the snow ended on the 22nd, the city of Buffalo had 36 inches of snow on the ground, setting the state record for storm-total snowfall. Winds of 30 to 50 mph caused snowdrifts up to 20 feet high. Many roads were closed, leaving travelers stranded for up to a day and a half. The Air National Guard airlifted 300 tons of hay to stranded cattle. Nevertheless, the loss of about 15,000 livestock accounted for much of the $2 million in damages.\n\nMultiple waves of snow, sleet, and rain affected Oklahoma and western north Texas from just after midnight on February 20th, through the 21st, back in 2013. Moderate and heavy snow affected the northern-half of Oklahoma, with mainly rain and sleet farther south. Although spotty totals of almost six inches were measured around Ponca City and just east of Norman, most of the snow accumulations outside of northwest Oklahoma averaged around two inches. The greatest snow totals were reported around Alva, where as much as 14 inches were measured.\n\nFor the third consecutive week, after winter weather events on the 12th and 21st of February 2013, another major winter storm affected the region the 24th through the 26th. By early afternoon on February 25th, moderate to heavy snow moved over most of western and northern Oklahoma. Very heavy snow bands and occasional thunder snow led to significant snow accumulations over a large part of northwest Oklahoma. Several areas saw snowfall in excess of 15 inches, and when combined with the snow that was already present from the winter storm a few days before, snow depths of up to 25 inches were reported near Woodward and Alva. Strong and gusty winds led to snow drifts up to eight feet in depth, shutting down many highways and secondary roads across western and northern Oklahoma. The heavy and wet nature of the snow caused some structural damage at Alva, Cherokee, and Woodward. Widespread power outages were reported due to snow-covered power lines and downed trees.\n\nOn this date in 1982, a winter storm dumped several inches of snow over portions of western and northern Texas. Snowfall totals of 3 to 4 inches were reported from just northwest of Abilene into the Wichita Falls area.\n\nFebruary of 2011, in Oklahoma City, had extremes of both cold and warm weather. With a snowy start to the month, 18.9 inches of snowfall was measured. This amount stands as the 2nd highest all-time monthly snowfall total for Oklahoma City.\n\nWith a multi-year drought continuing over much of the region, it was a dry start to 2014. Through the months of January and February, only 0.43 inches of moisture had been recorded at Will Rogers Airport in Oklahoma City. This made it the 4th driest two-month start to any year. It wasn't any better in Wichita Falls, where only 0.35 inches of moisture was measured, making it the 7th driest start.\n\nOn the heels of another surge of arctic air, which was a fairly common occurrence in the winter of 2013-2014, a strong upper-level storm approached the region. With temperatures primarily in the teens, a mixture of snow, sleet, and freezing rain spread over Oklahoma and northern Texas on this date in 2014. Because there was a layer of relatively warm and moist air just above the arctic air, scattered thunderstorms also developed. Although most of the storms produced moderate to heavy sleet, a few actually produced hail, with hail 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter observed just south and east of Norman. Thunderstorms are not that rare in early March, but having thunderstorms with surface temperatures in the teens is very rare. A majority of the sleet and freezing rain accumulations were on the light side but northern parts of Oklahoma received 3 to 5 inches of snow.\n\nAn upper-level storm system and associated cold front affected much of northwest Oklahoma on this day back in 2008. Several supercell thunderstorms developed along a dry line ahead of the cold front, while an additional line of storms developed along the cold front. One small tornado, rated F0, touched down in Blaine County and 4.25-inch hail was reported in the town of Buffalo, in Harper County.\n\nOn its second day to affect the region, a winter storm continued on this day in 2002. During the early morning hours, freezing rain turned to snow over a large part of Oklahoma. The highest amounts of snow were seen over northern Oklahoma, where the freezing rain changed to snow quicker. Up to 5 inches of snow was reported in the Enid area, with just a couple of inches reported over central Oklahoma, southward to the Red River Valley.\n\nA winter storm that started as sleet and freezing rain, and later changed to snow across western north Texas and southeast Oklahoma, occurred on March 4th and 5th, 1989. Near blizzard conditions occurred the morning of the 5th, when strong winds blew and drifted the already deep snow. The axis of heaviest snow extended from Healdton, in south-central Oklahoma, to Pauls Valley and Chandler. Sixteen inches of snow fell in Pauls Valley, and drifts of three to six feet were common. Over western north Texas, a band of snow 9 to 11 inches deep stretched from Coleman to Wichita Falls. The 9.7-inch snowfall on the 5th at Wichita Falls set their record for greatest snowfall for any one day in the month of March. This all occurred after the high temperature at Wichita Falls reached 83 just two days earlier.\n\nAn early season severe thunderstorm event occurred across Oklahoma and western north Texas on this date in 2010. Although there was some sporadic wind damage across Baylor and Wichita Counties in Texas, two tornadoes occurred over far west-central Oklahoma. These tornadoes tracked on the south side of Hammon, in Roger Mills County, and just north of Butler, in Custer County. One tornado destroyed a mobile home just south of Hammon. Two people inside the home escaped injury-free as they sought shelter in an underground storm cellar.\n\nA cold front initiated severe thunderstorms over much of northern Texas, and southern and central Oklahoma, on this date in 1992. Four minor tornadoes occurred, along with widespread large hail. Softball size hail fell just east of Ratliff City in Carter County. High winds and hail destroyed several buildings in the Ardmore area, and across western north Texas, three-inch diameter hail fell just south of Holliday, in Archer County.\n\nOn this day in 2019, an intense storm system moved out of the southern Rocky Mountains into the Central Plains, resulting in an extensive area of very strong winds. Damaging wind gusts occurred over eastern New Mexico and southeast Colorado, eastward across the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, into western Oklahoma and western Kansas. Across Oklahoma, all but far eastern parts of the state saw wind gusts over 50 mph. Wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph were recorded from Woodward and Gage, down to Clinton and Weatherford. The highest recorded wind gusts during the event were seen in the Texas Panhandle, with the top spot being Fritch, Texas, where a wind gust of 84 mph was measured at the West Texas Mesonet.\n\nTornado season started early in 1990. Sixty tornadoes occurred across the central and southern plains states on March 14th that year. Ten of the tornadoes were in Oklahoma, along with widespread large hail and high winds. One tornado touched down near Bradley, then struck the Noble area, just south of Norman. The stadiums press box at Noble High School was destroyed, as was the scoreboard. A second tornado overturned a five-ton crane near Ratliff City, in Carter County.\n\nHail and wind damage was extensive across parts of western north Texas, beginning just before midnight on March 13, 1982. Several million dollars in damage occurred from Electra to Burkburnett. Golf ball-size hail fell for 15 minutes in Electra, completely covering the ground.\n\nA powerful tornado struck Tinker Air Force Base on March 20, 1948. The storm destroyed 54 aircraft, including 17 transport planes valued at $500,000 apiece. Total damage amounted to more than $10 million, a record for the state that stood until the massive tornado outbreak of May 3, 1999. The tornado prompted the first attempt at tornado forecasting. Five days later, forecasters at Tinker believed conditions were again favorable for tornadoes, and issued the first recorded tornado forecast. A tornado did in fact strike the base later that day.\n\nA late winter storm tracked along the Red River on this date in 2010. Widespread snow fell, with the greatest accumulations across north-central into northeast Oklahoma, where four to seven inches accumulated. Farther south though the Oklahoma City metro and portions of south-central Oklahoma, most snow accumulation averages ranged from two to four slushy inches.\n\nA series of severe thunderstorms produced damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes across central and southern Oklahoma during the afternoon and evening hours of March 25, 2015 and early morning hours of March 26th. One supercell thunderstorm tracked through parts of Canadian, Oklahoma, and Cleveland Counties, producing a small, weak anticyclonic tornado near Yukon. The storm later produced an embedded, intermittent, and small EF2 tornado within a larger area of damaging winds that affected parts southwest Oklahoma City and Moore. Some of hail reported during this severe weather event reached baseball size. A wind gust of 73 mph occurred at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City.\n\nA late cold snap in March 2013 dropped temperatures 10 to 20 degrees below average for the middle part of the month. A low temperature record was broken at Wichita Falls, Texas when the March 25th morning low temperature dropped to 23 degrees.\n\nOn March 25, 1995, severe thunderstorms developed over western portions of Oklahoma during the morning hours. Hail, equal to or larger than golf balls, was reported from Laverne, down to near Altus.\n\nRecord setting snow accumulations were seen on this day in 2009 across parts of northwest Oklahoma as a late season snow storm hit. A powerful cold front swept through the area dropping temperatures in the 20s and 30s, with winds gusting over 40 mph. Snowfall rates were impressive, with areas across northwest Oklahoma receiving 2 inches of accumulating snow per hour. The snow ended on the 28th with a record 26 inches of snow in Woodward and Freedom, with a foot of snow more common. Roads were impassable and businesses were shut down as roofs collapsed from the weight of the snow.\n\nOn March 26, 2004, a widespread severe weather outbreak occurred across western and central Oklahoma. Baseball-size hail was reported on highway 183 near Clinton, and a few tornadoes occurred near Sharon, in Woodward County, where a car was blown off of the road and some livestock was killed. Several structures across the affected areas were damaged from severe hail and strong winds. When the event ended just before 10 PM, the Norman Forecast Office had issued a total of 66 severe weather warnings.\n\nOn March 27, 1971, the temperature climbed to 100 degrees at Wichita Falls. This set the records for earliest occurrence in the year of 100 degrees, and the warmest day ever in March.\n\nBack in 1991, the month of March was historic, with respect to tornadoes. Seventeen tornadoes occurred during the month, setting an all-time record. Oklahoma experiences about 4 tornadoes during an average month of March.\n\nThere were two rounds of severe thunderstorms that impacted the region over the weekend of the March 30th and 31st, 2013. The first round of severe weather developed in the evening of the 30th across southwest and central Oklahoma, with the strongest storms affecting the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge and western Lawton with very large hail. Hail sizes reached 2.3 inches in diameter at Cache. The second round of storms was focused primarily along a strong cold front that surged southward across Oklahoma and northern Texas early Sunday morning, the 31st. The storms formed over northwest Oklahoma and quickly intensified and moved toward central Oklahoma, arriving in the OKC metro around 3 AM. Winds along this line were estimated to be near 60 mph, with reports of quarter-sized hail in Oklahoma City. There were also numerous reports of golf ball-sized hail in Norman, and quarter-sized hail farther south through Sulphur, Ardmore, Roff, and Stringtown.\n\nThe winter and spring months of the year 2011 were very dry. In the midst of a historical drought, March 2011 ended up being the 2nd driest March in Oklahoma City history and the 4th driest at Wichita Falls, Texas.\n\nOn March 31, 2008, a powerful low-pressure system developed over northwest Oklahoma, with a dry line extending south from the low. As a result, numerous severe thunderstorms developed across western Oklahoma during the late afternoon hours and moved into central Oklahoma during the evening. Hail larger than the size of baseballs and winds gusting to 60 mph were frequently reported as the storms advanced eastward. A few tornadoes were also reported, one of which affected the Oklahoma City area, with several homes and businesses damaged.\n\nA round of severe storms on March 31, 1959, caused damage across much of Oklahoma. In Noble and Pawnee Counties, tornadoes caused damage to farms, while in Shawnee, a golf ball-sized hailstone knocked one person unconscious. Baseball-size hail fell in Thackerville, with some stones as large as 11 to 12 inches in circumference. This created holes in roofs, windshields, and even produced craters in the ground.\n\nA violent tornado struck Wichita Falls and Sheppard Air Force Base on the afternoon of April 3, 1964, killing 7 people and injuring over 100. Damage estimates exceeded $15 million. At least 225 homes were destroyed on the north side of town. This tornado is one of the first tornadoes ever to be shown on live television. Severe thunderstorms produced hail up to 3-inches in diameter and at least 8 other tornadoes across central and southern Oklahoma on this same day, including one that struck Catfish Bay Marina and Lake Texoma State Park during the early morning. Damage from this tornado approached $250,000.\n\nThe coldest April temperature ever recorded in Wichita Falls occurred on April 3, 1975. That morning, the temperature fell to a chilly 24 degrees.\n\nThe first week of April, way back in 1893, was one of the warmest weeks ever during April in Oklahoma City. From the 3rd through the 7th, the high temperature averaged an incredible 94 degrees. In fact, each of the daily high temperatures over that five-day period remains a record more than 100 years later. Despite the week of heat, April 1893 does not rank as one of the top ten warmest Aprils on record in Oklahoma City.\n\nOn April 4th and 5th back in 1921, heavy rains resulted in widespread flash flooding in the Clinton area. This resulted in the drowning of several hundred cattle.\n\nWith very strong winds and drought conditions in place, arcing power lines just north of Woodward started a wildfire that burned a large part of northern Woodward County on this date in 2016. The fire spread northward and narrowly missed Alabaster Caverns and the town of Freedom. Close to 60,000 acres burned.\n\nOn this date in 1978, three tornadoes touched down in southwest Oklahoma. The strongest began southwest of Pumpkin Center, and moved northeast for 10 miles, damaging or destroying 21 homes, five mobile homes, and 21 barns and outbuildings. The storm was accompanied by hail up to three inches in diameter. The only injury was to a boy, who was slightly injured, when a hailstone hit him on the head.\n\nOn this date in 2011, Wichita Falls set a record high of 100 degrees. Not only is this a record for the date, it is also the second earliest day of the year that Wichita Falls has reached the century mark. The earliest is March 27, back in 1971.\n\nIn addition to severe thunderstorms, an intense area of low pressure created very strong winds on this date back in 2001. Sustained winds of 35 to 45 mph, with some gusts to 60 mph, affected much of western Oklahoma and western north Texas.\n\nOn April 6th and 7th back in 1927, heavy rain added to already high stream flow, producing a devastating flood along the Arkansas River, below the mouth of the Neosho River. The flooding lasted through the 19th, inundating 165,000 acres of land, with losses totaling $4 million, in 1927 dollars.\n\nDamaging severe weather was seen across far northern Oklahoma on this date back in 2011. Numerous supercell thunderstorms produced hail the size of golf balls to baseballs from Cherokee, eastward toward Medford, Billings, Enid, and Ponca City. A particularly strong supercell produced a measured 94 mph wind gust at the Ponca City airport. This resulted in significant damage to numerous buildings on and near the airport grounds.\n\nIt began to snow over central Oklahoma during the evening of April 7, 1938, and continued to snow well into the following day. In Oklahoma City, several snowfall records for the month soon fell to the storm, including the record for most total snowfall during the month of April. The Oklahoma City snowfall totals of 0.8 inches on the 7th, and 3.3 inches on the 8th, remain daily records. In fact, the 3.3-inch snowfall on the 8th is the most ever to fall on any single April day. The 4.1-inch total for the month continues as the greatest April monthly snowfall total.\n\nTornadoes struck Archer City and Wichita Falls, Texas, on this date back in 1961. The Archer City tornado moved northeast through the center of town shortly after 3 PM, causing extensive damage to several homes and businesses. The Wichita Falls tornado began near Kamay, and moved northeast across Wichita Valley Airport and Sheppard Air Force Base, where wind gusts were estimated at 100 mph.\n\nDuring the evening of April 9, 1947, the deadliest tornado in Oklahoma history tore through the northwest part of the state. A vast majority of the destruction and loss of life was in Woodward, where 108 people perished, and more than 700 others were injured. Overall, in Oklahoma, the tornado killed 116 people and injured more than 1,400. The tornado first touched down near the community of White Deer, in the Texas Panhandle, crossed through the northwest Oklahoma Counties of Ellis, Woodward, and Woods, and finally dissipated near Saint Leo, Kansas. The tornado was up to one and one-half miles wide as it clipped along at more than 40 mph, and its path was 221 miles long through the three states.\n\nNumerous wildfires spread across central Oklahoma on this day in 2009. The event began as a fairly strong surface low-pressure system moved through northern Oklahoma, with an associated dry line positioned over central Oklahoma. Extremely dry air, combined with westerly winds gusting well over 50 mph, created conditions that allowed wildfires to grow out of control. Many homes and structures were burned, primarily in and near Midwest City. Luckily, no one was killed as a result of the fires.\n\nThe date of April 10, 1979, is fixed in the minds of many residents of Wichita Falls. On that date, one of the strongest tornadoes of recent memory ripped through the town, killing 45 people and injuring at least 1,700 in a matter of minutes. The worst tragedy was the fact that many deaths were easily preventable. Twenty-five people were killed when they got into their cars and tried to drive out of the tornado's path. Sixteen of the 25 left homes that were not even damaged. Besides the terrible human costs, 3,100 homes were destroyed, with an estimated 20,000 people were left homeless. The total damage in Wichita Falls was around $400 million. The Wichita Falls tornado was not the first massive tornado that day in the western parts of north Texas. An earlier tornado killed 10 people in Vernon and 1 in Lockett.\n\nFreezing rain events are not all that uncommon across Oklahoma and north Texas, especially during the late winter and early spring months. However, the late nature of an event on April 9th and 10th, 2013 stands out as one of the latest for Oklahoma. Looking at past events, the latest freezing rain event that resulted in ice accumulation in Oklahoma City occurred back on April 17th and 18th, 1953. Northwest Oklahoma, which tends to have a greater frequency of winter weather events, had its latest freezing rain event on April 29th, 1994 at Gage. As far as the 2013 freezing rain event, freezing rain began late on April 9th and continued through the afternoon of the 10th. Most of western Oklahoma and western north Texas saw at least some light ice accumulations. Fortunately, ground temperatures were relatively warm thanks to several days of temperatures in the 70s and 80s preceding this event, preventing ice from sticking to roadways. However, ice accumulations of one-quarter to one-half inch occurred on trees and power lines, resulting in sporadic power outages. Substantial tree damage also occurred, especially to soft wood trees with developed leaf canopies due to the recent warm temperatures.\n\nApril, 2018 was a busy fire weather month across the drought-stricken Southern Plains. Vegetation that had seen abundant growth during 2017 lay very dry and dormant in the early spring of 2018 due to a dry winter and early spring period. From April 12th through the 17th, very warm and dry air combined with the dormant fuels and strong winds to produce fire weather conditions labeled “historic”. Although there were many fires, the two largest began near each other in northwest Oklahoma. The Rhea Fire ignited southwest of Leedey in Dewey County and would go on to consume over 286,000 acres. The 34 Complex Fire began as three separate fires in Woodward and Harper Counties that merged into one, eventually burning over 60,000 acres north and east of Woodward. In all, nearly 400,000 acres burned across the state of Oklahoma, burning dozens of homes and causing tens of millions of dollars in damage. The small town of Martha in Jackson County lost at least 15 homes and over $20 million in cotton and cotton seed alone. Twenty fire-related injuries were reported by area hospitals, mostly due to smoke inhalation. The fires claimed two lives, a 61-year-old man died in Roger Mills County fighting a small fire that began near Leedey, and a woman died in her vehicle near Seiling.\n\nOn April 12, 1972, the temperature climbed to 100 degrees in Oklahoma City. That is the earliest date in the year that a temperature of at least 100 has ever occurred in the city. The 100-degree high also set a record as the warmest temperature ever observed in April for Oklahoma City. Meanwhile, Wichita Falls also set an April high temperature that day, with a reading of 102 degrees.\n\nThe 2nd latest winter-spring date OKC has experienced measurable snowfall is April 12. This occurred back in 1957 when seven tenths of an inch were recorded. The latest date is actually April 14, which was experienced in 1953 with eight tenths of an inch were recorded.\n\nAt least a dozen tornadoes affect southwest into central Oklahoma on this date in 2012. It was Friday the 13th when the first tornado of the day touched down just southwest of Norman at 3:59 PM. The tornado moved east-northeast through the heart of the city shortly after 4:00 PM. This tornado was eventually rated an EF1 as it damaged many businesses and homes, and took down numerous trees and power lines. No fatalities were reported with this rush hour tornado, but 20 injuries were reported. The same parent supercell thunderstorm that produced the Norman tornado also spawned a brief, weak tornado in Pottawatomie County 6 miles northwest of Shawnee.\n\nA two-day period of severe thunderstorms and heavy rain across Oklahoma ended on the early morning of April 13th, 1967. This allowed residents along Okmulgee Creek to return home after 4 to 8 inches of rain in east central Oklahoma forced the creek out of its banks. From the night of the 11th, through the morning of the 13th, tornadoes struck Geary and Walters, as well as in rural areas east of Ponca City, and over McCurtain County. Damage was minor, and only one injury was reported. Thunderstorm winds caused additional damage in a swath from Elk City and Sayre, northeast to Fairview, Helena, and Enid. Unlike many Southern Plains severe weather outbreaks, no hail was reported with any of these storms. All of the damage was due to winds or flooding.\n\nThe day after an EF1 tornado struck Norman, several tornadoes affected northwest Oklahoma on April 14th in 2012. Most of the tornadoes occurred from around 4 PM well through the evening around Waynoka, Alva, and Cherokee. The last in a series of tornadic supercells developed southwest of Woodward just before midnight and tracked toward Woodward. The Woodward tornado began around 11:50 PM 3 miles northeast of Arnett and moved into the southwest city limits of Woodward around 12:18 AM on Sunday, April 15th. The tornado finally exited the northwest side of Woodward around 12:23 AM. Sadly, 6 people were killed in and near Woodward with the EF3 tornado.\n\nOn this day back in 2011, several tornadic supercells developed over eastern and southeast Oklahoma during the afternoon and evening hours. Along with at least 5 tornadoes, at least one being rated as an EF3, very large and damaging hail occurred. Hail up to the size of baseballs and softballs were reported. The EF3 tornado, which struck Tushka in Atoka County, resulted in two fatalities.\n\nSevere weather and flash flooding affected a small part of western north Texas, into southwest and central Oklahoma on this date in 2013. At least five weak, short-lived tornadoes occurred from around Odell and Harrold, Texas, up toward Grandfield and Lawton, Oklahoma. Minor damage was reported with the tornadoes, but thankfully, no one was hurt. Numerous reports of damaging wind and hail, along with very heavy rain were also received across southwest and central Oklahoma. The largest hail and strongest winds were seen from Snyder and Cache, to Rush Springs and Chickasha. Significant flash flooding was also seen around Medicine Park, Meers, Chickasha, and Newcastle, where four to seven inches of rain fell in a short period of time.\n\nVery strong thunderstorm winds raked across Oklahoma and north Texas on April 16th and 17th, 1990. The Oklahoma City metro area took the brunt of the storms. Winds of 90 to 100 mph severely damaged roofs of several schools and apartment buildings. At the Oklahoma City Post Office, many Federal Income Tax returns, which were waiting to be loaded into a transport truck, were swept away by the winds.\n\nLate afternoon and evening severe weather, in the form of hail to the size of softballs and at least 5 tornadoes, affected southeast Oklahoma on this day in 2011. Stringtown, in Atoka County, received hail the size of softballs, while numerous tornadoes moved through the Kiamichi Mountains of far southeast Oklahoma. Thankfully, there were no reports of injuries.\n\nAfter three days of very heavy rain, from April 17th to 19th, 1970, areas around Medford, Jefferson, Lamont, and Blackwell were struck by extensive flooding. The town of Jefferson was completely inundated. Only nine homes escaped damage, with a few buildings reporting as much as two feet of water in them. In Blackwell, 40 city blocks and 200 homes were flooded when the Chikaskia River crested at six and one-half feet above flood stage.\n\nA severe hailstorm struck the Munday and Goree areas of Knox County, Texas, on this date in 1967. Damage was estimated at $1 million to property, and $500,000 to crops. Hailstones, some as large as golf balls, accumulated up to six inches deep. Some hail piles, drifted by the rain, were 2 to 3 feet deep. These same communities dodged a bullet the next day. A tornado touched down in open country 3 miles north of Munday, during the early afternoon, causing no damage.\n\nAt least seven tornadoes occurred across portions of south-central and southeast Oklahoma on this date in 2020. Tornadoes developed late in the afternoon and evening, from near Pauls Valley, down toward Springer, Madill and Durant. The strongest tornadoes, rated EF2, occurred northeast of Springer and in the southern part of Madill. Two fatalities occurred in Madill.\n\nSevere thunderstorms formed across southern, central, and eastern Oklahoma on this date in 2011. With a stalled frontal boundary near the I-44 corridor, storms producing hail to the size of baseballs moved across areas extending from Walters and Marlow, northeast through Sulphur, Wynnewood, and Tecumseh, up toward Tulsa and far northeast Oklahoma. There were also at least 8 tornadoes, none of which resulted in significant damage or injuries.\n\nA supercell thunderstorm left a 50-mile path of damage over a two-hour period across north-central Oklahoma on this date in 1964. At least three tornadoes occurred in the area, from near Garber, to Billings, to Tonkawa, to near Ponca City. Hail up to baseball-size accompanied the storm. Fortunately, there was only one injury reported.\n\nAn unusual tornado occurred on this day in 2006. In the town of El Reno, numerous storm spotters, including 3 media helicopters, spotted an anti-cyclonic tornado. It touched down 5 miles southwest of El Reno, while at the same time, a cyclonic tornado was moving across western El Reno. The anticyclonic tornado moved east southeast through the El Reno Regional Airport, causing extensive damage to the two large hanger buildings and ten aircraft. Five of the ten aircraft were claimed a total loss. Total damage to the airport was estimated at $1.5 million.\n\nThe month of April 2013, was a fairly chilly month for both Oklahoma City and Wichita Falls. It was the 4th coldest April on record for Oklahoma City, which interestingly, comes one year after the warmest April on record. For Wichita Falls, Texas, it was the 6th coolest April on record. On April 24th of 2013, Wichita Falls established its latest date in the spring with a freeze when the temperature dropped to 29 degrees.\n\nSevere weather struck parts of eastern Oklahoma during the afternoon and evening of April 24, 1993. On that day, severe thunderstorms produced eight tornadoes and dumped hail up to the size of baseballs. The worst tornado touched down in east Tulsa, and followed Interstate-44 into the community of Catoosa. Along with extensive damage to area homes and businesses, many cars and trucks were destroyed on the interstate and at nearby truck stops.\n\nThe first known official tornado outbreak in central Oklahoma came on April 25, 1893. On that day, at least five strong or violent tornadoes struck central Oklahoma. One twister moved through northern Cleveland County, destroying 30 homes. This tornado was more than one-mile wide at times.\n\nApril 2013 will down as one of the coldest Aprils in recent memory. At Wichita Falls, Texas, four low temperatures records were broken, one of them being the latest spring freeze on record, the 24th. Record lows were set on the 19th and the 23rd through the 25th, with the coldest being the 24th with 29 degrees. Oklahoma City also broke four low temperature records, with the lowest being on the 11th at 29 degrees.\n\nOne of the most significant tornado outbreaks over the Southern Plains in recent memory occurred on April 26, 1991. A total of 55 tornadoes, including ten in Oklahoma, ravaged the area. The most infamous of the storms struck the area around Andover and Wichita, Kansas. In Andover, 17 people were killed and more than 225 injured. The strongest storm in Oklahoma was the Red Rock tornado. This storm began just east of Garber, in Garfield County, and traveled 66 miles to just northwest of Pawhuska, in Osage County. Despite the violence of this intense tornado, it injured only six people.\n\nA tornado struck Sheppard Air Force Base, on the north side of Wichita Falls, on this date in 1962. The tornado blew out all but one of the 12, large windows, in the control tower. Tower personnel had been evacuated only four minutes earlier.\n\nOn this date in 2021, an isolated severe thunderstorm intensified just west of Norman in the Bridge Creek, Newcastle, and Blanchard areas. As the storm raced to the east into northern portions of Norman, it produced 60 mph to 70 mph winds with up to baseball sized hail. Extensive damage was done to houses and cars, breaking windows and damaging roofs. At least one injury from the hail was reported. Although the storm produced smaller hail farther east, it was still producing damaging winds over into Shawnee.\n\nApril 2015 was a wet month for much of the region. While in the midst of a long-term and exceptional drought across western Oklahoma, locations from around Taloga, to Cheyenne and Sayre received between 10 and 15 inches of rain during the month! This made April 2015 the second wettest month for west-central Oklahoma since records began in 1895.\n\nOn April 28 and 29, 1993, severe storms and flash flooding affected much of western and central Oklahoma, and even extended into the western parts of north Texas. Rainfall of five to eight inches caused extensive flooding in the Lake Carl Blackwell area. The hardest hit area was in parts of southwest Stillwater, where more than 100 people were forced to evacuate their homes, and several others had to be rescued from abandoned cars. In addition, the storms dropped up to golf ball size hail over the area.\n\nOn April 29, 1985, a tornado damaged parts of Ardmore, injuring one person. This tornado is unique in that it was the first tornado to be probed by a ground-based instrument package. A crew from the National Severe Storms Laboratory dropped the instrument package, appropriately called TOTO, for Totable Tornado Observatory, into the path of the storm to get accurate readings of conditions inside the tornado.\n\nWhile April does produce quite a few rainy days in Oklahoma City, it is not known for extremely heavy rainfall. The exception to this rule occurred back in 1947, when almost one foot of rain fell during the month. The 11.91-inch monthly total at Oklahoma City made April of 1947 the wettest April of record, but only the 8th heaviest monthly rainfall since accurate records began in 1891.\n\nMay of 2018 was the warmest May on record for the state of Oklahoma and the warmest May since 1962. This very warm May followed a stretch of several years when May in Oklahoma had been cooler than average. While there were no extended streaks of very hot or 100-degree temperatures during the month, high and low temperatures were consistently above average and there were no strong cold fronts, which we normally see. For individual locations, it was the warmest May on record at Lawton, the 2nd warmest at Oklahoma City, and the 5th warmest at Wichita Falls, Texas.\n\nMay of 2003 was an unusual year for tornadoes in the central United States, as most outbreaks occurred during the first two weeks of the month. A record-breaking 384 tornadoes occurred in 19 states during these first two weeks, which resulted in 42 fatalities. Included in these record-breaking events were the tornadoes which hit the Oklahoma City metropolitan area on May 8th and 9th.\n\nThe coldest May temperature ever recorded in Wichita Falls came on May 1, 1907. On that date the temperature fell to 36 degrees. The May record of 36 degrees was later tied on May 3, 1954, and on May 12, 1979.\n\nTo start the year 2018, no tornadoes were recorded in Oklahoma from January 1 through April 30, the first time with no tornadoes during this stretch since weather records began. A brief, weak tornado occurred on May 1 near the Kansas border north of Buffalo, bringing this record stretch to an end. On May 2, several tornadoes occurred from southwest Oklahoma, near Lone Wolf, into the southern part of the OKC metro. The metro tornado affected northeast sides of Norman with EF1 damage. No injuries were reported with any of the tornadoes.\n\nIt was a chilly start to May across Oklahoma and western north Texas in 2013. Record low temperatures were set on May 2, 2013 when Oklahoma City reported a low of 37 degrees and Wichita Falls 38 degrees. Both locations also set records for the coolest high temperatures for the date. Oklahoma City only reached 48 degrees while Wichita Falls made it to 53 degrees.\n\nSevere thunderstorms produced tornadoes and very large hail over northern Oklahoma on May 2nd and 3rd, back in 1979. One tornado, which formed near Cleo Springs, in Major County, damaged the southern and eastern parts of Tahoma. The storm killed one person and injured 25 others. A second tornado struck the Fairview area and flipped an airplane that was taxiing down a runway. The two occupants were not injured. Extremely large hail was also common. A huge chunk of hail, with an incredible circumference of 17 inches, fell in Woods County. Softball-size hail fell in Mulhall, and baseball-size hail fell in Enid.\n\nOn May 3, 1999, multiple supercell thunderstorms produced large and damaging tornadoes mainly over central Oklahoma during the late afternoon and evening hours. This tornado outbreak is arguably the most significant outbreak in Oklahoma recorded history. Although numerous towns were hit by more than 70 tornadoes across Oklahoma, the most violent tornadoes affected locations like Amber and Bridge Creek, Moore, Del City, Midwest City, Crescent, and Mulhall. The latest statistics show that 40 people died in Oklahoma as a direct result of the twisters, and 675 were injured. Numerous homes and businesses were destroyed with a total damage estimate of $1.2 billion.\n\nThe coldest May temperature ever observed in Oklahoma City occurred on May 3, 1954. That morning, the temperature fell to a chilly 32 degrees, which is also the latest spring freeze ever recorded in the city.\n\nAt least 10 tornadoes touched down in Oklahoma on this date back in 1961, including a large tornado near Cheyenne that was observed from many surrounding communities. One person was killed, and more than 20 farmsteads were severely damaged or destroyed by a tornado that tracked from just west of Geary, to south of Kingfisher. One farmstead was struck by two tornadoes within 5 minutes. This tornado outbreak occurred exactly one year after an outbreak that produced a dozen tornadoes across Oklahoma on May 4th, 1960.\n\nThe month of May in 2019 was exceptionally busy with tornadoes. 105 tornadoes were recorded that year, setting a record for the highest total for any month in Oklahoma. With several periods of severe weather through the summer and fall months, 2019 also saw the highest total for tornadoes in a year, 147. Despite the high number of tornadoes that year, no EF4 or EF5 tornadoes were recorded.\n\nSevere flash flooding hit parts of southwest Oklahoma and the western parts of North Texas on May 5, 1982. The hardest hit area was around Lawton, where four to five inches of rain fell in just 90 minutes. The weight of the heavy rain caused the roof of a shopping mall to collapse, killing one person and injuring two others. Flooding also occurred across North Texas, where several roads in Wichita, Clay, and Archer Counties were closed by high water that spilled over the banks of area creeks.\n\nNineteen tornadoes touched down on this date in 1961, leaving more than 30 people dead in eastern Oklahoma. Hardest hit was the town of Wilburton, where 13 people were killed, and over 800 homes and buildings were either damaged or destroyed.\n\nAt least 14 tornadoes touched down during the afternoon and evening of May 6th 2015. One tornado touched down near Archer City, Texas as well. A tornado that moved near Amber and Bridge Creek in Grady County was rated EF3, as was a tornado that struck parts of southeastern Oklahoma City that injured 12. Another tornado moved through the west side of Norman and was rated EF1. The tornado that occurred near Archer City in western north Texas was rated EF2. One flash flood fatality occurred during this severe weather event. A woman who had taken refuge from severe weather in her storm cellar in southeast Oklahoma City was drowned when flash flooding inundated her shelter and she was unable to get out. In addition, at least 150 high water rescues were conducted in the Oklahoma City metro area as a result of the heavy rainfall and flash flooding that occurred.\n\nSevere weather began on this day back in 2007, and continued until the early hours of the 7th. A surface low-pressure system in Colorado translated southeastward with thunderstorms developing in northwest Oklahoma early in the afternoon. A supercell that developed over central Oklahoma produced two small tornadoes in Seminole County. Minor damage was reported near State Highway 9, where a large tree fell onto a trailer and pushed it off its foundation.\n\nDuring the late evening of May 6, 1985, severe thunderstorms developed over parts of northwest Oklahoma. Hail up to baseball-size fell just northeast of Gage, and golf ball-size hail was common. A tornado was spotted near Tangier, in Woodward County. Flooding of many low-lying areas occurred after six inches of rain fell from the storms.\n\nThis date back in 2003 marked the first day of a three-day barrage of tornadic thunderstorms over Oklahoma. The first tornadoes occurred over southwest and south-central Oklahoma during the late evening of May 7th, into the overnight hours. The strongest tornadoes with this initial activity were rated as F2, and they occurred in the Cornish, Overbrook, and Antioch areas of extreme south-central Oklahoma. Although there was over $250,000 in damage, no injuries or fatalities were reported.\n\nSerious flooding occurred across central Oklahoma after torrential rain and hail fell on May 7th and 8th, back in 1993. Heavy rain, which fell on the 7th, left rainfall amounts up to an inch. Oklahoma City then recorded 6.64 inches of rain on the 8th, the sixth greatest daily rainfall amount ever observed in the city. Extensive flooding resulted, which killed four people in Oklahoma City, and the fire department had to rescue 183 others. More than 2,000 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed, and damages were estimated at $8 million.\n\nBack in 2003, this date was the second of 3 consecutive days with strong to violent tornadoes. Strong tornadoes occurred over extreme south-central Oklahoma during the early morning hours, from Cornish to near Antioch. Another round of tornado producing thunderstorms struck central Oklahoma later in the day, producing a violent tornado that affected Moore, Oklahoma City, Midwest City, and Choctaw. This F4 tornado took on a path very similar to the May 3, 1999 devastating tornado. This particular tornado back in 2003 affected areas from Newcastle and Moore, to Del City and Choctaw. Although over 130 people were injured, there were no fatalities.\n\nOn May 8, 1986, severe thunderstorms produced two damaging tornadoes in the Edmond area. The first tornado destroyed 39 homes and damaged 171 others, as it tore through the town. The second tornado destroyed or damaged 15 mobile homes. Despite the destruction, the storms caused only 15 injuries and no fatalities. The first tornado was rated an F3, making it the strongest tornado to strike the Oklahoma City metropolitan area between 1978 and 1999.\n\nThis day in 2003 marked the last day of a 3-day string of strong to violent tornadoes over Oklahoma. Like the day before, May 9, 2003 saw strong tornadoes plague central parts of the Sooner state. During the evening hours, tornadic storms ripped through areas from near Binger, in Caddo County, east and northeast through Union City, Bethany and Warr Acres, into Edmond, Wellston and Stroud. The strongest tornado produced F3 damage as it tore through the Edmond and Luther areas. Remarkably, there were only 10 injuries and no fatalities. The low numbers are attributed to the preparedness and actions taken by Oklahomans, emergency management, broadcast media, and the National Weather Service Forecast Office.\n\nOn this date in 2016, a wind gust measuring 88 mph was recorded at the Sulphur Mesonet site, 4 miles north-northeast of Sulphur. The Mesonet site was located immediately south of the damage path associated with a long track tornado. The storm that produced this measured wind gust also produced an EF4 tornado just south of Elmore City, killing one person.\n\nOn May 9, 1964, a supercell thunderstorm formed over eastern Greer County, in southwest Oklahoma. This storm then proceeded to drop hail larger than baseballs along its entire 135-mile path into the south-central parts of the state. An Air Force plane that flew into the storm near Cooperton, in Kiowa County, disintegrated and crashed due to the barrage of hail, killing six people. Large hail damaged every roof in the community of Fletcher, just northeast of Fort Sill.\n\nA significant outbreak of tornadoes occurred across Oklahoma on this date in 2010. Three people were killed and over 400 were injured after more than 35 tornadoes struck northern, central, and southern Oklahoma during the afternoon and early evening. This was the second largest documented tornado outbreak in Oklahoma history, second only to the May 3, 1999 outbreak.\n\nOne of the two deadliest tornadoes in Oklahoma before Oklahoma became a state occurred on May 10, 1905. On that day a monstrous supercell formed near the southwest corner of the Oklahoma Territory. The supercell spawned a deadly tornado that nearly destroyed the town of Snyder, and killed about 100 of its residents.\n\nThe longest continuous span of time with a thunderstorm in Oklahoma City occurred on this date back in 1950. Thunder was heard continuously for 18 hours and 21 minutes.\n\nScattered severe thunderstorms, which formed over northern Texas and moved northeast through southern and central Oklahoma, produced a fairly wide swath of strong and damaging winds on this day in 2011. Several locations near and east of Ardmore, Oklahoma City, and Newkirk saw thunderstorm associated wind gusts in excess of 60 mph.\n\nMay of 1982 was one of the worst months for severe weather in Oklahoma history. The second of three severe weather episodes came on May 11th and 12th. On the 11th, severe thunderstorms produced 18 tornadoes across the western part of the state. One tornado touched down southeast of Altus and moved across Altus Air Force Base. In Altus, almost every roof in town was damaged by large hail. At the base, 70 buildings were damaged or destroyed, 30 airplanes were damaged, and 6,000 vehicles suffered hail or tornado damage. Overall, two people were killed, 60 others injured, and the total damage from this particular storm was more than $200 million.\n\nWidespread severe weather tracked across the state on this day in 2009. Thunderstorms quickly developed along and ahead of a cold front during the afternoon and evening hours. Supercells across central Oklahoma produced hail to the size of baseballs, wind gusts over 60 mph, and four tornadoes. The most damaging tornado was rated as an EF2, which touched down southeast of Gracemont and moved south towards Anadarko, in Caddo County. Extensive damage to homes, businesses, trees, and a strip mall occurred. Luckily, no injuries were reported. Damage estimates were close to $50 million.\n\nWidespread severe weather occurred for two days across the state of Oklahoma on May 12th and 13th, back in 1985. The city of Moore reported baseball-size hail and winds of 70 to 80 mph. Even larger hail fell in south Oklahoma City, with some stones as large as grapefruits. Hail larger than baseballs fell as far southwest as Sterling, in Comanche County. Two weak tornadoes also occurred, but caused little damage.\n\nDuring the early morning hours on this date in 2020, several heat bursts occurred across southwest into central Oklahoma as a dissipating storm complex moved over the region. Numerous wind gusts of 50 mph or greater were recorded from Tipton and Mangum, to Fort Cobb and Chickasha, through much of the OKC metro, to Chandler. The wind gust at Chandler reached 65 mph, while a gust of 77 mph was recorded near Minco, just west of Oklahoma City. Along with the strong to damaging wind gusts, as the name implies, temperatures rose from the 60s well into to 80s in a very short amount of time. The strong wind gusts resulted in numerous power outages and damage to trees.\n\nOn this date back in 1991, baseball-size hail damaged cars, broke windows and skylights, and did extensive roof damage in Knox City, Texas. A tornado was sighted eight miles west of Knox City.\n\nA strong tornado touched down in western north Texas on May 14, 1986. The tornado formed just southeast of Archer City, and moved through the southern portions of Windthorst. The tornado caused four injuries at Windthorst, as several mobile homes were destroyed and several houses damaged.\n\nMay 15, 1991, was a very active day for tornadoes in Oklahoma, as at least five tornadoes struck the western and northwest parts of the state. The strongest tornado was sighted near Laverne, which was rated as an F3. The tornado was 800 to 900 yards wide, its path was 11.5 miles long, and it resulted in three injuries in the Laverne area. The parent storm also produced hail the size of grapefruits.\n\nWidespread severe weather, including six tornadoes, struck northern and central Oklahoma on May 15, 1990. The worst of the tornadoes developed just west of Stillwater, and then moved through northern parts of the city. The storm heavily damaged two apartment complexes, and severely damaged or destroyed 83 homes. One person died and 12 were injured.\n\nOn this date in 2017, a strong tornado struck southern parts of Elk City, Oklahoma, killing one person and injuring at least 10 others. The tornado developed 3 miles northwest of Carter, or just east of Sayre, and primarily damaged trees and power poles for the first few miles as it moved northeast approaching State Highway 34. The one fatality occurred on State Highway 34 south of State Highway 152 when a man was impacted by the tornado while in his pickup truck. About two miles southwest of Elk City Reservoir, damage intensity increased to EF2 strength as the tornado continued northeast over Elk City Reservoir and through a neighborhood on the south side of Elk City. Damage assessments found 66 homes destroyed , 62 in Elk City, and 140 homes damaged, 126 of which were in Elk City. In addition, 3 businesses were destroyed and 5 businesses were damaged by the tornado.\n\nA significant hail storm struck the Oklahoma City metro area on this date in 2010. This hail storm, which developed near Fairview and tracked just west of Kingfisher down through northern and eastern parts of the Oklahoma City metro area, will go down in history has one of the most damaging and costly hail storms in Oklahoma. Widespread hail ranging between the size of golf balls and baseballs, produced significant damage to automobiles, roofs, and vegetation. The hail was accompanied by winds in excess of 50 mph. Hail drifts several feet deep were reported, and some locations had hail still covering the ground 12 hours after it fell. Damage estimates exceeded $500 million.\n\nOn this date back in 1991, at least 6 tornadoes were produced across the northeast parts of Oklahoma. The strongest was rated as an F2, which struck Catoosa, causing an estimated $130,000 in damage, but no injuries.\n\nOn Sunday the 19th in 2013, significant supercell storms quickly developed along a dry line just west of the Oklahoma City metro area. Most of the storms became tornadic in nature and moved eastward, affecting several populated areas. Some of those impacted were Edmond, Luther, Carney, Lake Thunderbird and far east Norman, western Shawnee, and Prague. The most intense tornado occurred over far western Shawnee near the Shawnee Reservoir, where EF4 damage was found before the tornado traveled north and crossed Interstate-40. Two fatalities and numerous injuries were reported.\n\nIn what had already been a busy month of May in 2010, another tornado outbreak occurred on this date across western and central portions of Oklahoma. At least nine tornadoes occurred that day, with most of them confined to an area just north of Kingfisher, to Hennessey and Orlando, over to just north of Stillwater. Two tornadoes occurred near Wynnewood and Sulphur. Thankfully, there were only 3 minor injuries reported that day.\n\nA severe thunderstorm moved through Lawton on this day back in 1975, causing widespread damage to roofs, trees, and signs. A portion of the roof of a nursing home was removed by the winds, resulting in 9 minor injuries to the occupants.\n\nAn otherwise beautiful mid-May afternoon gave way to another devastating tornado to the cities of Newcastle and Moore on this day in 2013. This tornado came one day after tornadoes ravaged other portions of central Oklahoma. A supercell storm developed over the northern portions of Newcastle and quickly became tornadic. This storm produced damage on the north side of Newcastle, then intensified and moved eastward through the city of Moore. The tornado reached EF5 strength, destroying two occupied elementary schools and damaging or destroying more than 1500 homes and businesses. Twenty-four people lost their lives and more than 300 were injured. Property losses approaching $1.5 billion have been estimated for this tornado, making it the costliest tornado in Oklahoma history, surpassing the May 3, 1999 storm.\n\nVery large hail fell from severe thunderstorms over the Oklahoma City metropolitan area on May 20, 1990. The northern and western parts of the city were the hardest hit, as hail up to grapefruit-size pounded the area. The hail broke windows and damaged roofs, resulting in about $50 million in damage. Heavy rain made matters worse. Severe flash flooding hampered cleanup efforts after five to seven inches of rain fell.\n\nWidespread severe storms affected Oklahoma and northwest Texas on this date in 2019. Along with several tornadoes across the region, an observation site in Marshall, Oklahoma recorded a severe wind gust of 94 mph.\n\nThe largest hailstone ever recorded in Oklahoma fell on this date in 2011. The hailstone, six inches in diameter, fell 2 miles north of Gotebo. Damaging hail with a diameter of 2 to 3 inches was also seen farther east and north toward Carnegie, western parts of Oklahoma City, and Kingfisher.\n\nThe record for the hottest May temperature ever recorded in Wichita Falls came on two consecutive days, May 23rd and 24th back in the year 2000. The temperature rose to 110 degrees on both days.\n\nOne of the costliest Oklahoma City hail storms in history pummeled the city on May 23, 1968. Hail the size of baseballs fell over much of the city, resulting in more than 40,000 insurance claims over the 90,000 square mile path of the storm. The final cost was more than $20 million. The parent thunderstorm also caused flash flooding, that left two to four feet of water in some underpasses, and a lightning strike that started a fire which killed two people.\n\nOn this date in 2011, a significant tornado outbreak occurred across western and central Oklahoma, with 12 tornadoes resulting in 11 deaths and numerous injuries. One of the tornadoes was sampled by the Oklahoma Mesonet station located 5 miles west-northwest of El Reno. The station measured a wind gust of 151 mph and a 1-minute average wind speed of 115 mph. This was associated with one of the violent tornadoes that moved from near Binger, to Piedmont, and eventually Guthrie. This is the highest wind gust recorded by a Mesonet station, breaking the previous record of 113 mph set at the Lahoma site, in Major County, on August 17, 1994.\n\nOn May 24, 2004, severe weather occurred across southwest and central Oklahoma. Baseball-size hail fell at Chattanooga, in Comanche County, and tennis ball-size hail fell near Anadarko and just south of Altus. A brief tornado also touched down near Alfalfa, in Caddo County.\n\nSevere thunderstorms brought widespread large hail and damaging winds to southwest Oklahoma on May 24, 1962. Grapefruit-size hail fell near Duke, west of Altus, while 72 power poles were blown down north of Altus. The nearby Air Force Base was pelted by grapefruit-size hail driven by winds gusting to 85 mph, resulting in extensive damage. In the city of Altus, a radio station's tower was bent over by the high winds. Farmers in the area reported 100 percent crop losses. The storms even had a significant effect as far northeast as Oklahoma City, where outflow winds gusted to 99 mph.\n\nOne of the deadliest tornado outbreaks in Oklahoma history occurred on this date back in 1955. Several tornadoes occurred across western, central, and northern Oklahoma. The most devastating tornado formed just north of Oklahoma City, and moved northward, striking the town of Blackwell. Twenty people were killed and 280 were injured as the tornado destroyed eastern portions of the town. Another tornado formed just northeast of Blackwell and moved into Kansas, killing 80 people and injuring over 270 in and near the town of Udall.\n\nOn May 25, 1980, a severe thunderstorm crossed the southern part of Knox County, in northern Texas. The storm mainly affected the community of Munday, and to a lesser extent, Knox City. The storm produced hail up to softball-size and an incredible 4 to 10 inches of rain.\n\nMay 27, 2001 brought one of the most destructive and widespread windstorms to much of Oklahoma and north Texas in recent memory. Severe thunderstorms developed over southwest Kansas during the late afternoon, and rapidly merged into a large severe thunderstorm complex that moved rapidly southeast over the western-half of Oklahoma into northern Texas during the evening and overnight hours. This complex produced widespread and significant wind damage along its path, leaving 1 person dead, 4 injured, 160,000 people without power and over $350 million in damage in Oklahoma alone. Several non-tornadic wind reports in excess of 100 mph were recorded, and it took nearly a week to restore power to all of the affected areas.\n\nA strong spring storm system brought high winds to much of the area on May 27, 1973. Sustained winds reached near 50 mph and gusts approached 80 mph in many locations. Extensive roof, tree, and power line damage resulted across the body of Oklahoma. One person was killed when the strong winds caused them to lose control of their vehicle.\n\nThe months of May in 2013, 2015, and 2019 were relatively cool and wet for much of Oklahoma and western north Texas. For Oklahoma City, the temperature never reached 90 degrees during the month in those years, and OKC usually sees at least three 90-degree days in May. The top three wettest months of May in OKC are, in order, 2015, 2013, and 2019. Rainfall totals range from 19.48 inches to 12.49 inches. May 2015 is the wettest May on record for the state of Oklahoma. For Wichita Falls, Texas, these years have also been on the cool and wet side, especially in 2015, the wettest May on record with 17 inches of rain.\n\nThe temperature rose to a toasty 104 degrees in Oklahoma City late in the afternoon of May 30, 1985. This was the hottest May temperature ever recorded in the city.\n\nMay 2015 was the wettest month ever in Oklahoma City and Wichita Falls, and many locations across the region. Oklahoma City measured a record 19.48 inches for the month, while Wichita Falls recorded 17.00 inches. As far as the state of Oklahoma is concerned, it was also the wettest month ever for the Sooner State with a state-average 14.40 inches. This extremely wet month put an end to an extensive and prolonged severe drought over Oklahoma and northern portions of northern Texas that persisted since 2011.\n\nLess than two weeks after tornado outbreaks of May 19 and 20, another tornado event occurred over central Oklahoma on this date in 2013. An extremely large and violent tornado hit the outskirts of El Reno during the early evening hours. This tornado was rated as an EF5 and was 2.6 miles wide at one point of its life cycle, making it the widest tornado in recorded history. The tornado began just southwest of El Reno at 6:03 PM and moved just south of town and ended on the east side of El Reno at 6:43 PM. Eight people lost their lives in this tornado, all of them in vehicles on and near Interstate-40 and Highway 81. In addition to this tornado, at least a half dozen other tornadoes occurred across the Oklahoma City metro area, producing damage but causing no fatalities. Severe flash flooding was also seen across the metro area, resulting in the deaths of thirteen people.\n\nFor the first time since official weather records began, no tornadoes were reported anywhere in Oklahoma during May 2005. This was unusual because May typically marks the peak of tornado season for the state, with an average of 20 tornadoes in the month of May.\n\nMay of 1982 was a very wet month in Oklahoma City. More than 12 inches of rain fell during the month, making it the third greatest May rainfall in the city, and coming in eighth place for all months. For comparison, the driest May in Oklahoma City was in 1942, when only 0.43 inches of rain was measured.\n\nA severe storm damaging wind event affected many areas across Oklahoma on this day in 2007. A complex of severe storms moved into the state from southwest Kansas and combined with a line of storms already stretched across northern Oklahoma. The two storm complexes created a large and powerful bow echo that moved east and produced extensive wind damage in Enid. Fifty-foot pine trees were uprooted, windows at local businesses were blown out, and a radio station lost its roof and radio tower. A total of 100 homes sustained some type of wind damage. Damage estimates were in the $1 million to $2 million range.\n\nLarge hail pounded much of Oklahoma on June 1, 1981. The storms produced grapefruit-size hail in Edmond, and some hail fell for as long as 20 minutes. Total damage in the Edmond area was $7 to $10 million, as the hail destroyed the roofs and windows of many homes and totaled many autos. Softball-size hail fell in Kingfisher, Blaine, and Logan Counties, while hail reached baseball-size around Lake Lawtonka, in Comanche County.\n\nOn June 2, 2004, a severe weather outbreak occurred across western north Texas and the eastern two-thirds of Oklahoma. Across Oklahoma, it was mainly a wind event, with 60 mph or stronger winds measured at Norman, Enid, and Stillwater, where some structural damage was reported. In Texas, thunderstorms produced strong winds that caused major structural damage at the Vernon airport, along with baseball-size hail near Scotland, in Archer County.\n\nThe morning low temperature in Oklahoma City on June 2, 1917, was a chilly 46 degrees. That temperature is the coldest temperature ever recorded in the city during the month of June.\n\nOn this date back in 1985, large hail and a few weak tornadoes struck parts of western and southwest Oklahoma. Reports included five funnel clouds and three weak tornadoes. Hail up to baseball-size pelted the Thomas area, in Custer County, and the area just west of Gotebo, in Kiowa County.\n\nSeveral severe thunderstorms surged southward across western Oklahoma into western north Texas during the evening on this date in 2020. Widespread wind damage was reported from the Texas Panhandle border of western Oklahoma, eastward through Cheyenne, Elk City, Weatherford and El Reno, and southward through Hobart, Altus, and down toward Wichita Falls, Texas. Wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph were common, with a maximum measured gust of 80 mph near Cheyenne and Elk City. Once the storms dissipated, numerous heat bursts occurred across northern and central Oklahoma. Buffalo and Freedom saw the temperatures rise from the 70s back up into the 90s around midnight. Buffalo also saw a wind gust of 72 mph occur with their heat burst.\n\nThis day back in 1973 began with a tornado just south of Marietta around midnight. During the day, additional tornadoes developed south of Ponca City, northeast of Yukon, on the west side of Norman, east of Barnsdall, southeast of Meeker, and near Stratford. It ended much like it began, with a brief tornado in the Ardmore area around 11:30 PM. Only minor damage was reported from the various storms.\n\nDuring the very hot and very dry days of early June 2011, a weak cold front and dry line entered western portions of Oklahoma. On June 8th, 2011, severe thunderstorms developed in the very hot environment which resulted in widespread damaging wind gusts and even some large hail. The strongest and most persistent winds were seen just north and west of Altus, where winds measured 77 mph. The same front and additional outflow boundaries helped produced thunderstorms the following day across northwest Oklahoma, again, producing damaging wind gusts.\n\nA strong tornado struck the communities of Drumright and Olive on June 8, 1974, killing 13 people. The tornado developed just southwest of Drumright, then moved across the town, killing 12 people and damaging or destroying more than 100 homes. The storm killed another person when it reached Olive. Approximately 20 tornadoes struck central and eastern Oklahoma that day, including one that touched down near the National Weather Service Forecast Office, which at that time, was located at Will Rogers World Airport. This particular tornado injured 14 people, and damaged up to 700 homes as it passed across southwest parts of Oklahoma City.\n\nOn this afternoon back in 1918, Oklahomans who were in the right place at the right time were treated to a rare spectacle, a total eclipse of the sun. The narrow path of totality extended roughly from near Alva, to Enid, to Henryetta, to Poteau, with Oklahoma City and Tulsa being near the south and north edges of the path. Totality lasted about a minute in Oklahoma. Oklahomans who do not want to travel very far to see one, will have to wait until April 8, 2024, when is the next time totality will pass over southeast Oklahoma.\n\nSevere thunderstorms struck much of western north Texas on June 10, 1986. The Wichita Falls area was hardest hit, as winds greater than 80 mph combined with one-inch diameter hail and caused extensive damage in the city. Torrential rain, up to nearly 5 inches in some places, caused both Holliday and McGrath Creeks to flood.\n\nA tornado touched down in rural areas near Hammon, Oklahoma on this date in 1967. A woman and four children were killed on a farmstead several miles east of Hammon. The storm was accompanied by hail 3 to 4 inches in diameter. Total damage from the tornado and the hail was over a quarter million dollars. The tornado was one of at least a dozen that occurred across western and central Oklahoma that day.\n\nSevere thunderstorms, some producing tornadoes, raked across central and northern sections of Oklahoma on this day back in 1998. Most of the tornadic activity was confined to Canadian and Oklahoma Counties. The strongest tornadoes, which produced F2 damage, occurred during the late afternoon and early evening hours . Most notable, was the F2 tornado that tore through the northern portions of the Oklahoma City metro area, including the Frontier City amusement park. This tornado produced property damage in excess of $1 million. The tornadoes this day in 1998 resulted in 21 injuries, but thankfully, no deaths.\n\nA tornado caused extensive damage in Stillwater on June 13, 1975. The storm developed on the northwest side of town and moved southeast across the campus of Oklahoma State University. Extensive damage occurred on campus and downtown. The storm destroyed 20 mobile homes, and carried several large appliances, such as refrigerators and freezers, more than one-half mile.\n\nBetween 7:00 PM and 8:00 PM on this date in 2011, a wet downburst affected areas in and around Norman and southeast Oklahoma City. Intense rainfall was accompanied by hail up to golf-ball size and winds that were measured at over 80 mph. Damage was reported over much of the city of Norman, with the most extensive damage over the northern and northeast parts. Almost 33,000 residents were without power, some still without power over 24 hours later, due to the numerous power poles and lines that were snapped or blown down.\n\nWidespread heavy rain occurred across central and parts of southern Oklahoma on this day in 2010, resulting in widespread flash flooding. One person died in Lawton, and at least 136 were injured across the state. There was over $5 million in property damage in Oklahoma County alone. Although higher rain totals were observed over northern Oklahoma City, 7.62 inches of rain fell at Will Rogers World Airport, breaking the all-time record for precipitation for any calendar day at the airport.\n\nThe warmest June on record in Oklahoma City was June 1953. The main part of the heat wave extended from the 11th through the 21st, and seven of the daily high temperatures during that stretch remain records for their respective dates. June 14th was the hottest day, reaching a toasty 106 degrees. The other records ranged from 100 to 105. In addition, eight daily minimum temperatures from June 1953 are still record-warm daily minimum temperatures, ranging from 75 to 80 degrees.\n\nIt was a very hot and humid day across the region on this date in 2016. With high temperatures in the middle 90s to around 100 degrees, very high humidity created heat indices well over 100. The highest heat index was seen in Bixby, just south of Tulsa, when their heat index peaked at 118.\n\nSevere thunderstorms brought heavy rain and high winds to much of the western two-thirds of Oklahoma on June 15, 1968. Winds gusting more than 70 mph dislodged a home from its foundation in Lawton, while winds stronger than 100 mph did extensive damage in Chickasha. The exact wind speed in Chickasha was not determined, because the wind gauge could only measure winds up to 100 mph. Torrential rain amounted to seven inches in just a few hours near Loyal.\n\nThunderstorms moved off the higher terrain of southeast Colorado and northeast New Mexico on this date back in 2020 and moved into the Oklahoma Panhandle, producing damaging winds. The Mesonet observation site near Boise City recorded a wind gust of 98 MPH as storms rolled through. Needless to say, scattered wind damage was also reported in and around Kenton and Boise City.\n\nOf all the dangerous aspects of thunderstorms, lightning kills many people each year in the United States. Golf courses are a common site of lightning related injuries and deaths. This was the case on June 19, 1994, when lightning struck and killed two golfers, and injured another, at a golf course just north of Union City, in Canadian County.\n\nOn this date in 2011, scattered severe thunderstorms developed along a dry line that had pushed through southwest Oklahoma, while more widespread severe storms developed along a cold front over northern Oklahoma. Several storms produced golf-ball size hail and wind gusts as high as 70 mph. The hardest hit areas were around Medford and Lamont in northern Oklahoma, and down around Duncan and Walters in southern Oklahoma.\n\nOn this date, in 1935, a tornado occurred near Apperson, in Osage County. The tornado formed one mile northwest of town and moved southeast through town. On the tornado's 75-yard wide, two-and-a-half-mile long path, it destroyed eight homes and struck a herd of cattle, killing 186 animals. Property damage was estimated at $25,000 in 1935 dollars. One hour later, another tornado formed near Fairfax, again in Osage County, and struck the Burbank Oil Field and injured five people.\n\nJune 2011 was a very warm and dry month across Oklahoma and Texas, just one in a long streak of months that led to extreme drought conditions. The month of June 2011 was the warmest June on record at Wichita Falls and the 3rd driest. Wichita Falls also saw the greatest number of days with high temperatures of at least 100 degrees in June, with that number being 28. At Oklahoma City, it was the 2nd warmest June and a record was set for the greatest number of days in the month of June with a high temperature of at least 90 degrees, all 30 days.\n\nThe second wettest month in the history of Oklahoma City was June of 1989. June deluges have helped place four Junes into the top ten wettest months in the city's history. In June 1989, Oklahoma City recorded 14.66 inches of rain. Several other cities across the state also had record or near-record rainfall that month, including Clinton with 13.46 inches, Anadarko with 10.98 inches, Waurika with 10.77 inches, and Ada with 9.47 inches. A vast majority of the rain fell in a two-week period at the beginning of the month. On five separate days, the rainfall exceeded one inch, reaching a maximum of 4.56 inches on the 13th. Oklahoma City went on to have the wettest summer on record, months June through August, with a total more than 22 inches of rain.\n\nLarge hail and damaging winds accompanied severe thunderstorms across parts of central Oklahoma on July 2, 1972. Baseball-size hail fell in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area, and winds reached 75 to 100 mph. The wind took down power lines and damaged or destroyed at least 23 mobile homes. Winds gusted to 100 mph in Lindsay, and 80 mph in Norman. The wind in these ar"
