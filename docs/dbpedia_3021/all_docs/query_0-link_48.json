        "meta_description": "ESA status: threatened (January 2023) Whitebark pine can grow to 12–18 m tall (40–60 ft) and, rarely, up to 1.5 m (5 ft) in diameter. They are shorter, or even shrub-like at higher, windier elevations. The bark is thin, scaly, and grayish. Their needles are 4–10 cm long (1.5–3 in), in clumps of 5 at the ends of upswept branches. Being monoecious, both smaller male pollen cones (typically scarlet in full bloom) and larger female seed-bearing cones grow on the same tree. The purple to dark brown female cones grow 5–8 cm long (2–3 in) on the branch tips of the upper tree. Unlike other pines, the scales don’t open at maturity to release their seeds. Their closed, purplish cones and 5-needle bunches distinguish them from similar Pacific Northwest pines, like the western white pine (Pinus monticola), which has longer, pointier cones, and the lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), which has 2 needles in a bunch and smaller cones. Preferring full sunlight, whitebark pine commonly grow on ridges and just below tree line between 1300 and 3700 m (4300–12,100 ft), at higher elevations than most other pines. Their fast growing, deep roots and stout stems buffer them from strong and desiccating mountain winds. They range from southwest Canada south to the Sierra Nevada in California and east to northern Nevada and Wyoming. Whitebark pine rely heavily on the Clark’s nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) for reproduction. The nutcracker’s stout, straight beak can dig through the unopened scales of a mature pine cone for its seeds. The pea-sized seeds are roundish, wingless, and larger than other conifer seeds. Carrying the seeds in a pouch under its tongue, the bird buries them in shallow soil caches, sometimes up to 10 km away. Nutcrackers are known to cache up to 90,000+ seeds in a good seed crop year! The lucky seeds that escape the nutcracker’s sharp spatial memory for finding them again often sprout. Slow-growing, the whitebark pine takes 25 to 30 years to begin producing cones. The cones take 2 years to mature. Peak cone production begins at 60 to 80 years and continues for several hundred more. Some trees live over 1000 years! Ecology Other than birds, many animals feed on this tree’s high-calorie, nutritious seeds, which are 52% fat, 21% protein, and contain minerals like copper, zinc, iron, manganese, and calcium. Red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) collect the seeds in caches, which grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) raid. In fact, grizzly bear fecundity has been tied to the size of the whitebark pine cone crop. New grasses and herbs establish more easily under whitebark pine trees, promoting plant succession in the harsh subalpine. And the watershed benefits too. Snow piled up against and shaded by the trees melts more slowly, extending downstream water supplies. Fire has mixed effects on whitebark pine. It can kill mature trees, whose thin bark and relatively short stature make them vulnerable. But it leaves behind burned mineral soil in which the trees’ seeds sprout readily, often cached there by the nutcracker. Moreover, fire suppression in Western forests has boosted competing conifers, like the mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), which naturally succeed whitebark pine in the absence of disturbance, like fire. Conservation Whitebark pine are in steep decline throughout their range from a combination of factors. As a result, they have been a candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act since 2011. Warmer temperature trends have triggered epidemic outbreaks of the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and lowered the trees’ resistance to white pine blister rust, caused by a nonnative fungus (Cronartium ribicola), both of which have killed millions of trees. Historical fire suppression allowed the march of more shade-tolerant competitors into whitebark pine habitat, replacing this species through succession",

        "text": "There are four stages in the life cycle of the whitebark pine: seed, seedling, sapling and mature trees, also referred to as reproductive adults. Seeds are produced in female cones and once on the ground may take two years or more, up to 11 years in some cases, to germinate. Germinated seeds become seedlings that are between 3 to 4 inches tall (8 and 10 centimeters) with a taproot that can measure between 5 to 7 inches (13 to18 centimeters), with 7 to 9 cotyledons, also known as the embryonic first leaves, as documented by S.F. Arno and R.J. Hoff in 1990. Whitebark pine seedlings may persist for multiple years, depending on growing conditions, until reaching the sapling stage of the life cycle. Whitebark pine saplings persist for few to many years, depending on growing conditions, until they produce male and female cones. Mature reproductive whitebark pines contain both female and male cones, which is known as monoecious reproduction, and can survive on the landscape for hundreds of years.\n\nWhitebark pinemay occur as a climax species, or an early to seral mid-successional stage codominant associated with other tree species. Although it occasionally occurs in pure or nearly pure stands at high elevations, it more typically occurs in stands of mixed species in a variety of forest community types. Whitebark pineis typically 16 to 66 feet tall (5 to 20 meters) with a rounded or irregularly spreading crown shape. On higher density conifer sites, whitebark pinetends to grow as tall, single-stemmed trees. On open, more exposed sites, it tends to have multiple stems as documented by W.W. McCaughey and D.F. Tomback in 2001. Above tree line, it grows in a krummholz form, meaning stunted, shrub-like growth, as documented by S.F. Arno and R.J. Hoff in 1989. Production of male and female cones in mature trees will begin sometime from June to September depending on environment as documented by W.W. McCaughey and D.F. Tomback in 2001 and later by A. Sala and others in 2012. Female cones take 2 years to fully develop as documented by Weaver in 2001. Its characteristic dark brown to purple seed cones are 2 to 3 inches long (5 to 8 centimeters) and grow in clusters of 2 to 4 cones at the outer ends of upper branches as documented by R.C. Hosie in 1969.\n\nLike the other life stages, the mature tree life stage of whitebark pine is moderately shade-tolerant and therefore high-quality habitat is often characterized by a more open canopy as documented by P.E. Maloney in 2014, or lower competition with other overstory trees. Whitebark pineis a slow-growing, long-lived tree with a life span between 500 years and 1,000 years as documented by S.F. Arno and R.J. Hoff in 1989 and later by D.L. Perkins and T.W. Swetnam in 1996. This is provided it is located in an area with lower competition, such as a more open canopy with low litter depth and high rock cover, as noted by P.E. Maloney in 2014. Therefore, in addition to the four general needs for all life stages, mature whitebark pine trees require a more open canopy, dispersal of seeds by Clark’s nutcracker, two summers of suitable temperatures and precipitation for pollinated cones to mature, as well as levels of nitrogen and phosphorus that are adequate to restore values after being depleted in masting year.\n\nMature reproductive whitebark pines contain both female and male cones, known as monoecious reproduction. Production of male and female cones in mature trees will begin sometime from June to September depending on environment as documented by W.W. McCaughey and D.F. Tomback in 2001 and later by A. Sala and others in 2012. Female cones take 2 years to fully develop as documented by Weaver in 2001. Seeds are produced in female cones and once on the ground may take two years or more, and in some cases up to 11 years to germinate. While whitebark pineis almost exclusively dependent upon Clark’s nutcracker for seed dispersal, the reverse is not true as Clark’s nutcracker will forage on seeds from numerous species of trees. The frequency of nutcracker occurrence and probability of seed dispersal from a whitebark pineforest is strongly associated with the number of available cones. The number of cones produced is dependent on stand condition and tree abundance as documented by L.E. Barringer and others in 2012. A threshold of 1,000 cones per 2.47 acres (1 hectare) may be needed for a high likelihood of seed dispersal by nutcrackers. Additionally, this level of cone production occurs in forests with a live basal area, where the total stem cross-sectional area of square meters per area (hectare) is greater than 5 square meters per hectare as documented by W.T. McKinney and others in2009. For an adult Clark’s nutcracker to survive a subalpine winter, accounting for those seeds consumed by rodents and those fed to juvenile nutcrackers, it would need to cache seeds from between 767 to 2,130 cones as noted by W.T. McKinney and others in 2009. Clark’s nutcrackers are able to assess cone crops, and if there are insufficient seeds to cache, they will emigrate in order to survive as noted by W.T. McKinney and others in 2009. Other seed predators such as Steller’s jays, deer mice and chipmunks provide limited dispersal of whitebark pine seeds as documented by W.W. McCaughey and D.F. Tomback in 2001.\n\nIn general, the upper elevational limits of whitebark pinedecrease with increasing latitude throughout its range as documented by W.W. McCaughey and W.C. Schmidt in 2001. The elevational limit of the species ranges from approximately 2,950 feet (900 meters) at its northern limit in British Columbia, up to 12,000 feet (3,660 meters) in the Sierra Nevada as noted by W.W. McCaughey and W.C. Schmidt in 2001. Whitebark pineis typically found growing at subalpine treeline, or with other high-mountain conifers just below the treeline, and subalpine zone as noted by S.F. Arno and R.J. Hoff in 1990 and later by W.W. McCaughey and W.C. Schmidt in 2001. In the Rocky Mountains, common associated tree species include P. contorta var. latifolia (lodgepole pine), Picea engelmannii (Engelmann spruce), Abies lasiocarpa (subalpine fir) and Tsuga mertensiana (mountain hemlock). Common associated tree species are similar in the Sierra Nevada and Blue and Cascade Mountains,except lodgepole pine is present as P. contorta var. murrayana (Sierra-Cascade lodgepole pine), mountain hemlock is absent from the Blue Mountains as documented by S.F. Arno and R.J. Hoff in 1990 and later by W.W. McCaughey and W.C. Schmidt in 2001. Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir are absent in the Sierra Nevada."
