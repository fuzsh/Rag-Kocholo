        "text": "Description\n\nRussian Blue Potatoes are a late harvest, high yielding variety, with an attractive purple skin. They are excellent for baking and good for boiling, french frying and chipping.\n\n500\n\nAt Shelmerdine we offer the best selection of garden seeds and seed starting products for your garden! From growing microgreens to indoor sprouts and full scale vegetable gardening, we have everything you could possibly need to be successful! If you’re new to seeds and seed starting, visit our store! Our staff are experts at seed starting and at vegetable gardening and we love to share our passion and knowledge with you!\n\nGrowing plants from seed is a great way to start gardening earlier in the season. With the right light, soil and some simple equipment, it’s easy to grow from seed to harvest. All you need is a sunny window or some grow lights, a basic seed-starting mix, some trays or small pots, and a seedling heat mat if you want to accelerate growth.\n\nSEED STARTING IS FUN, EASY AND IS SO REWARDING!\n\nStarting your own seeds indoors expands the selection of crops that you can grow. This is especially relevant because we live in a cold climate with a relatively short growing season. We are located in climate zone 3, so slow maturing crops like peppers, onions, leeks, celery, and tomatoes have to be started before spring in order for them to reach maturity during the summer months. Visit our Seed Starting Calendar to learn more about when to start your seeds indoors and which seeds can be directly sown into the garden.\n\nOur friends at West Coast Seeds carry an incredible offering of Canadian-grown, organic seeds. Their website is also an incredible resource for seed and seed starting information – check them out! At Shelmerdine, we’re excited to be your experts for all things seeds!\n\nSHIPPING\n\nOrders placed before 2pm CST (Central Standard Time) Monday to Friday will be shipped out within 3 business days after we receive your payment. Orders placed on weekends or holidays will be processed out the next business day.\n\nConditions beyond our control may cause delays in delivery time (weather, strikes, etc.). Shipping time is thus not guaranteed. Should a significant delay occur, please contact us at shop@shelmerdine.com or by calling 1-888-895-0032. Any errors or incomplete addresses can cause additional delays.\n\nShould the delivery take longer than expected, we will notify you. Once the order has been shipped, the delivery time and the choice of carrier are based on the destination.\n\nIs it possible to have my order delivered to another address than my own?\n\nYes, you can choose a different shipping address than the one from the billing address. You may only ship to one address per order. If your order contains gifts or items that require shipping to multiple locations, you will need to place separate orders for each address.\n\nORDER TRACKING\n\nOnce an order has shipped, we’ll send you an e-mail with the tracking number. Just click on the link to take you to the carrier’s website to track the progress of your shipment. It may take 72 hours for your tracking number to be activated on our carrier’s site.\n\nWe do our best to ensure your items arrive in perfect condition. However, in the unlikely event that your box arrives in a damaged condition, please accept the delivery and contact us at shop@shelmerdine.com or by calling 1-888-895-0032 so that we can assist you.\n\nPlease note that if you refuse your order, or any part of it without our authorization, you will be responsible for all return shipping charges.\n\nRETURNS\n\nFor purchases made online, we must receive your returned item(s) within 30 days from the date of shipment to be eligible for a refund. To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging.\n\nYou can return your item(s) in one of two ways:\n\n1) Within 30 days, return your item(s) to our store location at 7800 Roblin Blvd, Headingley, Manitoba.
