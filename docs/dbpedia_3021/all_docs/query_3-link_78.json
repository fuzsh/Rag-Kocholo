        "text": "Ehmke Seed is a family-owned seed company with a long history on the High Plains. Our farm goes back to the pioneer days in 1885 when the Ehmkes emigrated from Germany in search of a brighter future in Lane County, Kansas.\n\nFour generations later in 1986, Vance Ehmke and his wife Louise saw an opportunity to grow their own certified seed wheat for themselves and local farmers. Wanting to try something different, Vance and Louise experimented with growing triticale seed and found it was a huge success with cattlemen and dairies across the High Plains. Now in the fifth generation, the tradition continues.\n\nEhmke Seed has grown to be one of the premier wheat, triticale and rye seed dealers in western Kansas. The focus at Ehmke Seed continues to be bringing high-quality seed and years of knowledge and expertise to our customers. That’s why nearly all of our seed is grown and sold right here on the Ehmke farm in west-central Kansas. Ehmke Seed grows top-performing wheat varieties for the central and southern plains, as well as world-class triticale and rye varieties for forage growers looking to get more out of their livestock investment."
