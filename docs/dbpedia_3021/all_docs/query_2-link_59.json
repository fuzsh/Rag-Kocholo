This means you pay retail pricing for our grass seed + exact shipping cost. Your exact shipping cost will be calculated at checkout. ALL of our grass seed will eventually switch to pay exact shipping. This is the most fair way for both you and GCI Turf.\n\n\"Blue Tag\" seed refers to a certification tag affixed to the seed bag, providing a guarantee to professionals or consumers that the variety stated is certified. Essentially, blue tag acts as an extra level of testing to ensure that you get precisely what you pay for.\n\nYou may be curious about what \"A List\" varieties are. In a nutshell, A List varieties are varieties of turf that are selected to be on the A List due to their performance. They “stand out” in the crowd, for lack of better words. Some would consider A List varieties to be the best of the best.\n\nBoth the GCI Turf Type Tall Fescue and the GCI Cool Blue are now classified as A List blue tagged seeds. In the Cool Blue blend, we have retained the Midnight KBG variety as well, although it is not an A List variety. Nevertheless, it does carry the blue tag to verify its authenticity as the renowned Midnight seed.\n\n85% Turf type tall fescue 15% Kentucky Bluegrass\n\nCool Blue prefers full sun but can tolerate some shade\n\nCool Bluegrass seed requires watering to germinate\n\nCool Blue. should be cut between 3\" and 4.5\" tall\n\nCool Blue does best in the transition zone and north of the transition zone\n\nCool Blue has the ability to spread and fill in some due to the KBG mixed in\n\nIf you plan to buy the GCI Turf Cool Bluegrass seed and the GCI Turf Cool Season Lawn Care Guide please buy the GCI Turf Cool Bluegrass seed first.

The coupon code is inside the \"user guide\" that comes with buying a bag of grass seed.\n\nA good starter fertilizer goes a long way when it comes to seeding. Read this STARTER FERTILIZER GUIDE.\n\nWhat's in the bag?\n\nGCI Turf Cool Blue is a 4-way mixture of high-quality Turf Type Tall Fescue and Kentucky Bluegrass seed. 85% Turf type tall fescue and 15% Kentucky Bluegrass.\n\nWe became known for having “weed-free” grass seeds and the new ones are no different. All the new grass seed mixes/blends are 0% weed seed and 0% other crop.\n\nHow long does grass seed stay good?\n\nAbout 2 years if kept dry\n\nWe look for three basic things when choosing the varieties that go in our grass seed mixes/blends. It must be readily available to us, it must have an excellent history in the NTEP trials (National Turfgrass Evaluation Program), and it must be affordable.\n\nAvenger 3 (PPG-TF 308) pushes the boundaries of Tall fescue versatility, adapting to both high heat and extreme cold climates. Avenger 3 excels with Brown Patch resistance and scored in the top percentage for Shade Tolerance. Avenger 3 continues the Avenger family line’s heritage of select performance for all turfgrass areas. Make Avenger 3 the choice for blends and mixtures everywhere!\n\nFirecracker G-LS (PPG-TF 308) is a breakthrough Tall fescue cultivar, combining Lateral SpreadTM (LS) toughness with the first NTEP- proven resistance to Gray Leaf Spot (G)! Firecracker G-LS sets a new standard for durability thanks to its aggressive recovery & density, which allows it to shine in summer’s heat and resist diseases that take out the competition. Choose Firecracker G-LS for an explosively good Tall fescue!\n\nTitanium G-LS (PPG-TF 255) has the top 2020 NTEP score on overall turf quality ratings, scoring in the top 25% more than 68% of the time. Titanium G-LS is known for its Gray Leaf Spot (G) resistance and best in class spring & fall density. This tall fescue excels across multiple regions, making Titanium G-LS versatile without sacrific- ing performance. Lateral SpreadTM (LS), low-mow ability and very dark green color make this variety a clear standout!\n\nMIDNIGHT (KBG) A unique Kentucky Bluegrass cultivar that produces a dense, fine leaf turf with dark green color and superior disease resistance. It also provides a dark green color, fine to medium leaf texture, and excellent density during the growing season. Midnight mixes well with other Kentucky Bluegrass, Perennial ryegrass, fine fescue, and tall fescue\n\nWhen should you plant Cool Blue TTTF/KBG?\n\nFall is a great time to seed Cool Blue TTTF/KBG. Plant Cool Blue TTTF/KBG seed when soil temperatures are between 50° and 65°F. Your air temperature should be around 60° to 75°at this time. The fescue in Cool Blue TTTF/KBG seed will germinate anywhere from 4 - 10 days to germinate. The KBG seed will need more time to germinate because it takes anywhere from 14-30 days to germinate. Mid August - Mid October is a great time frame depending on where you live in the country and what your soil and air temperatures are. Patience is required while waiting on KBG to sprout. Don’t get consumed by waiting on the KBG...it will come. I only recommend springtime seeding when absolutely necessary.\n\nHow much seed to use?\n\nOverseeding into an existing poor lawn: Six - eight (6-8) pounds per 1000 square feet.\n\nOverseeding into an existing nice lawn: Three - six (3-6) pounds per 1000 square feet.\n\nSeeding bare ground: Eight - ten (8 -10) pounds per 1000 square feet.\n\nGermination...\n\nThe trick to seed germination is to KEEP THE SEED MOIST! Water multiple times a day, light and frequently every day to ensure the ground and seed stay moist. Cool Blue TTTF/KBG seed can take anywhere from 4 to 10 days to germinate depending on environmental conditions. Be patient...it will come up with time. Once you have germination you can slowly revert back to watering 1” per week...deep and infrequent. During hot, dry weather established Cool Blue TTTF/KBG may need as much as 1.5” - 2” of water per week."
