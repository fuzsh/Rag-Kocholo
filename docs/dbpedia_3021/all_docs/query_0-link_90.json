        "text": "Hi, ’94s! Many of you were just on campus for our 30th reunion, and I hope you had an unforgettable time with family and friends. Maybe you were reminded of the great memories you made on campus decades ago, the strength of the bond that our shared experiences created, or the role Dartmouth played in shaping the future you are now living. If you are feeling the warm fuzzies for Dartmouth, we invite you to consider volunteering with our class officers. We have a few new hand-raisers out there, and we wanted to invite all of you to consider volunteering your ideas, talents, and time, no matter how small or large that may be. Please reach out to our class president, Justin Sadrian, at justin.sadrian@warburgpincus.com if you are interested in learning more.\n\nI heard from classmate Matt Price, who provides his first update in 30 years, showing us that it’s never too late to drop a note to friends and classmates. Matt shares, “After 15 years on the East Coast (four years in the Boston area and 11 years around New York City), I moved to my wife Lisa’s hometown of Traverse City, Michigan, in 2009. It’s a lovely place and, surprisingly enough, home to another ’94! I see Bryce Hundley, as well as his wife, Alicia Walker ’93, around town pretty regularly. Lisa and I have three boys—Jackson (17), Dashiell (13), and Xavier (10)—and we are thrilled that Jackson will be a member of the Dartmouth class of 2028! Honestly, it’s a bit surreal, but I’m definitely looking to spend more time in Hanover.”\n\nIn addition to Matt’s good news, I learned about author and classmate Andrew Smith’s newest book release, A Cloud of Unknowing (The Deserted Vineyard Book 2). Andrew shares, “A Cloud of Unknowing picks up shortly after the events of Our Lady of the Artilects. The characters, each dealing with the trauma of their experiences in different ways, are pulled back into the mystery of the strange energy flux known as the Lucifer particles. Against a backdrop of Vatican intrigue and geopolitical confusion, the Process conspiracy continues, threatening the foundations of both faith and science.” If you enjoy reading sci-fi or contemplating theories of consciousness, you should check out Andrew’s books, which he writes under the name Andrew Gillsmith.\n\nDrop me an email if you have an update to share. Please consider sending your reunion stories as well; they will make for fun news for future columns.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN, 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHey to the young alumni of the class of 1994! I’ve been wondering when a group shifts from a young-alumni cohort to the “seasoned” variety. Is there a middle step or do we just fall from a cliff from young to—something else? According to my quick Google search, young alumni definitions vary widely from institution to institution. Some schools are really stingy with their grace period; after five years, you’re no longer a young alum at Trinity College in Connecticut.\n\nOthers are more generous; University of Illinois says young alumni are under 40.\n\nSome are so specific that you almost wonder why this is a thing; Swarthmore College draws the line at 14 years.\n\nDartmouth seems to be a little more vague than other schools. The College website refers to young alumni at five, 10, and even 15 years out. In that case, we’ll take the squishy ambiguity and continue calling ourselves the young alumni of the class of 1994 until the first classmate says, “back in my day” at our 30th reunion.\n\nMark your calendar for our 30th reunion: June 13-16. You will not want to miss it! Jen Suhie Hagelston and Samantha Stoddard are heading the reunion planning committee. Jen promises “a rocking time with great food, drinks, nice swag, live entertainment from our very own ’94 bands, and surprise guests.”\n\nTo build the hype, your class officers have been connecting classmates throughout the year. After a fall packed with mini-reunions planned by Rebecca Wahl Scott, we’re using Evergreen Connections to collect fun facts about each other. Have you seen the new series of interviews featuring fellow classmates? Pete Moore interviews Tim Wetherill in a fabulous first installment. If you haven’t submitted your Evergreen Connection survey or seen the interview, now is the time to plug into the action. Submit your survey (or let me know if you need a new link) and follow “Dartmouth Class of 1994” on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nAre you still on the fence about reunion? Maybe you would enjoy taking in all the campus changes and updates since the last time you visited. Come see renovated Dartmouth Hall and get a peek at the new Hop under construction. Alternatively, cast a wider net and combine Hanover with a broader New England family vacation (Acadia National Park, anyone?). Boston is always a wonderful stop in summer. There are some pretty perfect college campuses to tour in the Northeast if you have high schoolers in tow.\n\nI truly hope to see you in June. I’ll have my D’94 L.L.Bean tote from a reunion ages ago slung over my shoulder. Remember to bring your vintage Dartmouth gear for the photo ops.\n\nDid you notice that there is no new news in this column? That’s because you haven’t sent me any. Please drop me a line with your update.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nAs I draft this column many of you are returning home from Dartmouth Homecoming Weekend or enjoying mini-reunions around the country. It’s fun to see the pictures and hear the stories that continue to unite us 30 years later. These October connections are only the opening act to the huge headliner coming in June, and you can have VIP, all-access passes. Our 30th reunion will be in Hanover from June 13-16, and you won’t want to miss it. Mark your calendars now and keep your eyes out for registration information.\n\nIn the run-up to our 30th reunion you can expect to hear more details from Jennifer Suhie Hagelston and Samantha Stoddard. Both Jen and Sam are professional reunion planners and have chaired a multitude of events through the years for our class. With such veterans at the top, they will build a strong team and plan a special campus experience. Please consider joining their reunion committee; reach out to Jen at jenniferhagelston@gmail.com.\n\nLast note about reunion, please make sure you share any updates in your contact information to alumni records at alumni.records@dartmouth.edu. We want to make sure we have your correct information so you don’t miss out on class news and registration deadlines.\n\nIn other class news, Andrea Fiorentino Liebross is the author of recently released She Thinks Big: The Entrepreneurial Woman’s Guide to Moving Past the Messy Middle and Into the Extraordinary. From her homebase in Indianapolis, Andrea is a certified business and life coach, mother of two children and two giant Leonberger dogs, and wife of Robert H. Liebross ’91. Andrea specializes in empowering female entrepreneurs, sidelining the drama in business, and inspiring breakout progress and tangible accomplishments. You can catch her advice on her engaging podcast, Time to Level Up.\n\nKen Davis was in Phoenix to play in the Sophie’s Day Golf Tournament, an annual tournament organized by Tony Lee to benefit the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Tony hosts the event to honor his daughter, Sophie, and her successful battle against myelodysplastic syndrome. Ken and Tony caught up with Alison LeBoeuf and Colleen Linehan Haskell during their time together. Ali is living in Palm Springs, California. Colleen’s daughter is in her second year at Dartmouth, playing lacrosse and having a wonderful experience. I’m looking forward to seeing all of you in just a few months at reunion and hearing which of you four is really the best golfer. I’ve heard some tall tales but holding off on final judgment for your verification and facts.\n\nPlease remember to send your news for the next column, consider volunteering for our reunion committee, and (if you haven’t already) complete the Evergreen Connections survey. I’m looking forward to hearing from you.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHello, classmates! The countdown continues toward our 30th reunion. Thanks to our many classmates who have joined the reunion planning committee! There is always room for more volunteers, and we invite you to jump into the fun of reconnecting. If you have a few hours to help between now and June 2024, send an email to 1994dartmouthreunion@gmail.com to sign up.\n\nAs we think about all the reasons we love Dartmouth and consider our favorite moments, I’ll continue to toss out a “This or That” to gauge informally some of the preferred places, tastes, and times of our collective college experience. In the last column I asked whether you preferred Hop fries or Hop half-baked cookie bars. In my admittedly unscientific research, the resounding preference for Hop fries is clear. Case closed!\n\nConsider now which iconic seasonal festival or time you loved most during your time at Dartmouth. Was it Homecoming, Winter Carnival, Green Key, or Sophomore Summer? It’s hard to pick just one, when every season is beautiful in Hanover, and every weekend saw connections and community strengthen. Alas, you may only pick one. Please reach out and let me know your vote.\n\nIn other news, Tim Wetherill shared an update on his career. After practicing medicine as a general and trauma surgeon for many years, Tim moved to Blue Cross Blue Shield, where he led utilization management transformation and responsible incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine. Most recently, Tim joined startup Machinify as the chief clinical officer. Machinify works to apply AI to healthcare to improve quality, safety, and cost for patients and consumers. I may be preaching to the choir, but Tim has demonstrated perfectly the importance of combining liberal arts education with STEM focus to be impactful in our changing world.\n\nI also bring the sad news of the death of Alfred W. Patetta on June 18. Al came to Dartmouth from New Jersey after growing up in Kenilworth. He was an active member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon and worked at the radio station WDCR/WFRD. Although Al majored in government, he had an ease with world language, fully engaged in the language departments and language study abroad opportunities at Dartmouth, and remained fluent in Italian throughout his life. He was also a wiz with investments. He spent the first several years of his career in Dallas as an equity trader for Coastal Securities. After an early retirement, he managed his own and others’ investments after moving back to his hometown of Kenilworth. Throughout his life he remained an active parishioner, devout Catholic, enthusiastic Dartmouth alumni interviewer, and long-time supporter of the National MS Society. He enjoyed exercise, loved his dogs, and devoted quality time to his family and friends. Al is survived by his daughter, Francesca, and sister Melissa Patetta.\n\nPlease remember to send your vote to my inbox and consider volunteering for our reunion committee. I’m looking forward to hearing from you.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHi, classmates! In anticipation of our 30th reunion in June 2024 I’m inviting you to share what you’re most excited to do and see on campus. I’ll collect your thoughts and share a David Letterman-style “Top 30 Things to Do During Our 30th” list through the course of the year in this column. In addition, I’ll ask you to weigh in on various Dartmouth-themed “this or that” options.\n\nFor the first question, I ask which did you prefer from the Hop: Hop fries or the Hop’s half-raw chocolate chip cookie bar? I live in a house divided. My husband, Ken Davis, has been underbaking chocolate chip cookies to this day because of his love for the Hop bar and his fearlessness of food-borne illness. To me, the Hop fries were a culinary highlight of our dining options on campus. Let me know what you think.\n\nIn terms of updates, class president Justin Sadrian shared that a group of 17 Dartmouth ’94s and their significant others celebrated their 50th birthdays last summer with a Caribbean vacation. Justin wrote, “Jeff Goldfaden did a fantastic job organizing the trip to Jamaica. Logan Johnson even arranged for Don Husky, an up-and-coming reggae artist, to put on a private show. Other classmates who were there included Derek Braddock, Todd Carlson, Brian Eller, John Faubert, Matt Feeley, Ethan Frechette, Adam Grossman, Scott Mansfield, Jason Pollard, Dave Rissmiller, Ari Rosenberg, Andy Ruckh, Ryan Spayde,and Mike Thurlow.”\n\nI learned that Andrew Smith has published another novel. His newest book, titled The Pilot: Planet Gallywood #2, is a sequel to The Final Season. In a Venn diagram, Andrew’s Planet Gallywood series sits somewhere between The Truman Show and Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. Stay tuned for a third book in the series in the coming months.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and including your update in the next column.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHi, ’94s! We’re in the early stages of reunion planning for our 30th celebration, and we need your ideas and help. All are welcome to participate to the extent your schedule allows. To learn more, please reach out to our class president Justin Sadrian at 1994dartmouthreunion@gmail.com.\n\nIldiko Shinkle Neilsen wrote to me about her beach weekend on Nantucket, Massachusetts, with Beth Donohoe Cook, Kiley Barnhorst MacDonald, Pamela Kunz, Karen Staib, Julie Lane,and Juliana Chittick Tiryaki. Ildi writes, “We had a great time biking, sitting on the beach, eating lobster, and hanging out at the fire pit. We laughed a lot about old memories, discussed current situations with work and family, and shared some hopes for the future. It was a beautiful weekend.”\n\nIldi continued to give a CliffsNotes-style update on her beach-bound buddies, and I will attempt to do the same. Beth teaches at the University of Massachusetts Amherst School of Public Health & Health Sciences. She and her husband, Todd Cook ’93, have two daughters and live in Wellesley, Massachusetts. Kiley is a trust and estates attorney in La Jolla, California, and has three children, including a daughter who is a Dartmouth ’25.\n\nWhile I’m hoping never to need Pam’s professional help, she serves Yale Medical School and Yale Cancer Center as the director of gastrointestinal oncology. She and her husband, Jeff Kwan, Med’01, have three sons and spend their free time on the baseball field. Karen is a litigation partner focused on franchise law at the Hartford, Connecticut, firm of Shipman & Goodwin. She and her husband, Ben, share two sons. Julie works as an elementary and middle school reading teacher in Watertown, Massachusetts. She and her husband, Matt, have three children and live in nearby Newton. Juliana and her husband, Can, have two sons, and operate their firm of Tiryaki Architectural Design in Cohasset, Massachusetts. Last, but certainly not least, Ildi is currently working as a career coach at Harvard Business School. Ildi and Kevin Neilsen live in Wellesley with their two children.\n\nThank you to Andrew Plumridge for sharing some fun stories of recent accidental and purposeful connections with classmates. Andrew shares, “I run into Art Zweil fairly regularly; we were both at Boston Private Bank until recently. In addition to our wives having been college roommates at Smith, our first-born daughters are both there as well, so Northampton, Massachusetts, is a regular destination.” Last year the Plumridges took the all-too-familiar “college decision road trip.” Lo and behold, at one Pennsylvania college, Andrew saw Steve Costalas and family (Steve’s son is now a first-year at University of Colorado - Boulder.) Then, in Ohio, he caught up with Jon Newton and family. Andrew attended his high school reunion at the Menlo School in Palo Alto, California, where he reconnected with classmates Greg Alden, Keri Gleason Elmquist, and Harley McAllister. Keri sang the national anthem at the homecoming game (and was superb). Andrew stayed at one of Greg’s hotels, The Stanford Park Hotel (which was wonderful). Harley has eight children with wife Abby. Andrew had dinner with Katy Horner Kobal, her husband, Rob, and son Drew. Katy is an assistant district attorney for Alameda County, California. Katy’s son Jeff is a Dartmouth ’26. Andrew also caught up with Paul Morf, who continues to practice trust law in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, while raising three daughters. Andrew and his family are still living in Sharon, Massachusetts, where they have been since 2007.\n\nI enjoyed reading so many snippets about classmates. Please share your brief note for the next magazine.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHi, class of ’94! Keep reading, because I’m getting right to the updates.\n\nDawn Matthews has lived in central Vermont since 2004. She moved to the area to work on Howard Dean's ill-fated presidential campaign, but stayed, and has practiced law for the last eighteen years as a public defender focused on prisoners' rights, post-conviction, and appellate work. She lives in East Montpelier with her husband, Peter Kopsco, sons Noah and Bram (15 and 13, respectively), and the family dog, Blue Ivy, a 75-pound sheepadoodle.\n\nSheila Bassiri Ahmed also shared news. Sheila lives in Walpole, Massachusetts, with her husband, Rizal Ahmed ’92, and their four children. Lindsay (21) is a senior at the University of Oregon in the architecture program, Tyler (19) is a sophomore at the Isenberg School at University of Massachusetts, and their younger two, Joey and Ryan, are high schoolers. Sheila writes, “I left my career in 2002 to raise my children but recently went back to work full time as the senior vice president of operations at the Service Council. I am an avid volunteer, serving as the longtime president of the board of directors for the Natick-Walpole VNA and as a district enrollment director for Dartmouth admissions for the past decade. I was also the first Dartmouth alumna to join and serve as president for the Dartmouth Women’s Club of Boston (an organization very dear to my heart), which was established in 1930 by wives of Dartmouth alumni and continues to grow its scholarship fund for current Dartmouth students. It is now a resource and community for mothers of first-year students from the Boston area. I recently went to Hanover to enjoy Riz’s 30th reunion and feel blessed to have kept in touch with so many close Dartmouth friends.”\n\nIn closing, I share the sad news of a classmate’s death. Schuyler Wheelock Henderson passed away unexpectedly on November 21, 2022, in New York City. Schuyler was born in New York City, raised in London, and returned to the United States to attend Dartmouth. Schuyler was the English major who was a regular at 4 p.m. Sanborn tea. While an undergraduate student he also engaged in a language study abroad program in Italy and spent his off term working in Romania at an orphanage for severely disabled children. He was awarded Dartmouth’s Lombard Public Service Fellowship to work with Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata, India.\n\nSchuyler moved to Chicago, where he worked with refugee populations and attended the University of Illinois College of Medicine. Drawn to those marginalized populations he had served through the years, Schuyler wanted to support these communities in a different capacity. He found his way to NYU Hospital for a residency in adult psychiatry.\n\nFor the next 20 years, he devoted his life to working with patients at Bellevue Hospital and within the public mental health system. His continued leadership and impact through fellowships are too numerous to name; he published extensively, predominantly in the area of child and adolescent psychiatry. He was a gifted instructor at the NYU medical school and a bright, motivational practitioner. He is known for championing vulnerable populations with empathy and respect. He also completed his master’s in public health from the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. Schuyler was certainly a student of life and for life, yet he never lost sight of what brought him fulfillment: sharing his love of literature with his older children, Neko and Sunhie; cooking for friends; and spending time with his wife, Kate, and young daughter, Hattie.\n\nDrop me a line, and I’ll share your news with our classmates in a future column.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHi, ’94s. I’m writing this column as 2022 comes to a close. Collectively, we had a pretty exciting year as we reconnected with classmates, developed our careers, and even turned 50 (or 51, for some). By the time you’re reading this, we’ll be just more than a year away from another shared experience—our 30th reunion! Mark your calendar and start making plans now to come in June 2024.\n\nThanks to Amy Nevin, who kindly rallied her friends to send me updates, so I have lots to share. Beginning with Amy, she is a practicing pediatrician in Pittsburgh. She spent the majority of her clinical career helping to start a new federally qualified health center branch, where she became a leading advocate for housing and lead exposure. Most recently, Amy has widened her expertise to include behavioral health therapy and psychopharmacology, while also overseeing peer-support programs for Type 1 diabetes at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. Apparently, instead of sleeping, she also serves as the national director of pediatrics at a dynamic public health startup, Wellness Equality Alliance. Amy writes, “We had great success vaccinating folks at the Mexico-Texas border against Covid-19 and are now expanding into other areas! I oversee a diverse and dynamic national task force of community health workers. Leadership of this organization includes a fun group of energetic, creative thinkers in medicine, pharmacy, and nursing.” Knowing Amy from our Tri-Delt days, I know she is the fun, energetic, creative hub of this important group!\n\nMartha Kiddoo Krieg has spent most of her time since leaving the Granite State in the Mountain West. After 12 years in Vail, Colorado, and another 11 years in Truckee, California, Martha now lives in Park City, Utah. She teaches elementary school “here and there between powder days” and enjoys spending time with her family on and off the slopes.\n\nLiz York lives in Tunbridge, Vermont, with her husband and two children on a small, diversified organic farm where they grow produce and raise livestock. She writes, “I take my lumps volunteering for the town government there. To quote Homer Simpson, ‘Did you know that so-called “volunteers” don’t even get paid?’ ” Oh, Liz, how well we can relate. We are grateful for civil servants such as you!\n\nSuzie Fromer has embarked on a couple of new professional ventures during the past several years. She writes, “I had a lot of fun growing my Etsy jewelry business and stretching as a jewelry maker during the pandemic. I had a lot of ‘high concept’ pieces that really took off (including a Lone Pine Dartmouth necklace that is being sported all over campus), but I’m thrilled to announce I’ve also taken on a new part-time job. After participating in my local Repair Cafe as a volunteer jewelry fixer, I couldn’t pass up an opportunity to get more involved with the larger movement in my area.\n\n“I recently joined Repair Cafe Hudson Valley, which is under the umbrella of the nonprofit organization Sustainable Hudson Valley, as its Repair Cafe coordinator. Repair Cafes are a wonderful resource that help people fix their beloved but broken items while also reconnecting with their neighbors or meeting new ones. So now in addition to traveling all over the Hudson Valley, New York, and beyond doing free jewelry repair and helping out in other ways at the many cafes in the area. I’m also doing PR and grant writing and am always looking for new ways to spread the Repair Cafe love.”\n\nPlease drop me a note with your update!\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHi, ’94s. I have lots of nuggets to share. Please keep reading!\n\nAlly Hyun Rich provided us with a nice update. Ally moved to Cleveland in 2018 BC (before Covid) with her spouse and children. She is counsel with Squire Patton Boggs, where she works with the white-collar and government investigations groups. Given the state of affairs, she is likely finding herself awfully busy.\n\nAlly writes, “At our 25th reunion Lauren Campisi Smit and I reconnected and we’ve hung out a few times, both pre- and post-March 2020. Lauren is a doctor with the Cleveland Clinic practicing family medicine. Last fall I was in Miami, where I got the chance to meet up with Matt Feeley, who is currently the deputy chief of the healthcare fraud unit for the U.S. attorney’s office based in Miami. It was so lovely to see Matt after so many years and we joked that both of us have lived away from our respective home states ever since we graduated yet we are still devoted to our hometown teams.”\n\nWhen traveling to San Francisco for a conference, Ally also connected with Brian Buenneke, who has been with Pantheon Partners now for more than 20 years.\n\nAlly shared another connection from the same trip: “At one of the conference events Neil Smith and I saw each other across a crowded bar and we both stopped dead in our tracks. Neil is a partner in the Boston office of K&L Gates, where he practices in the white-collar group, which he joined after a number of years working for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the enforcement division. It was fun to catch up with him and we even managed to impress and horrify some of his colleagues when we were able to warble out the first few lines of the alma mater (hat tip to tequila and cigars).”\n\nIt comes as no surprise that Ally is looking forward to our 30th reunion and will be ready to give a rouse with a will. I can’t wait to join her!\n\nI close with heartbreaking news of the death of classmate Thanalakshmi Subramaniam. “Shimi” made a mark wherever she went. After growing up in Singapore, Shimi moved to the United States to attend Dartmouth, where she was a leader in the arts and the community. Shimi majored in drama and women’s and gender studies, was a member of Casque & Gauntlet and Panarchy, and was a Tucker fellow.\n\nShortly after graduation she moved to San Antonio, Texas, where she dazzled the city with her fiery compassion and iridescent talent. She joined the Jump/Start Performance Co. and built an independent performance career featuring every kind of dance you could imagine, from hip hop and hoop to belly dancing and pole dancing. She loved merging her love of movement with her advocacy for people of all identities. After marrying her beloved Oscar Alvarado in 1997, they lived in a converted former bar that quickly became a popular venue for performing artists and shows such as It Came from the Lounge and the Miss Southtown Pageant, an all-gender beauty pageant with great local culture.\n\nFriends describe her as a fighter for social justice, art, women, people of color, and general righteousness. She was known as a beautiful and graceful dancer, a mentor to the youth she taught, an inspiration to those she fought for, and a bold co-conspirator to those she befriended. Shimi was hit by a car in San Antonio and died on December 2, 2020.\n\nThank you for sending me your news. From the emails I’ve received, it sounds as though you’re finding meaningful ways to celebrate and enjoy this milestone year. In the next several columns I will keep sharing updates.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHi, ’94s! Thank you for sharing your news with me during the past few months! I have several interesting stories and nuggets to pass along.\n\nAmy Nevin emailed me about a Seattle celebration for Deb Hafermann Brandt and shared a handful of fantastic photos. A slew of Dartmouth ’94s convened this past May to ring in Deb’s milestone birthday with a 1980s icon-themed 50th party, crazy costumes, live music, and loads of familiar faces. Amy writes, “The evening kicked off with live music featuring fellow Dartmouth bandmates Jim Lewin ’93 on drums and vocals, Jeff Olson ’95 on guitar, and Deb on keyboards. Deb’s local band, featuring Aly Ryder Burks ’02 on vocals, then took the stage to finish out the epic night.”\n\nAmy shared some pictures of the charismatic group sporting some impressive costumes. Solid Gold dancers included Sheila Bassiri Ahmed and husband Riz Ahmed ’92, Jane Eckels, Sarah Power Berglund, Liz York, Martha Kiddoo Krieg, and Darcey Forbes Bartel. Other party goers donned other garish 1980s trends, such as leg warmers, acid jeans, big hair, and neon colors.\n\nAmy enjoyed reconnecting with lots of classmates and Dartmouth alums from other classes. She shared that “also rocking out in attendance were Jeff Battema, Dawn Matthews, Stacy Smith Branca, Jen Suhie Hagelston, Randy Tennant, Liz Berger Friedman, Jordan Friedman, Marion Shonn Dorer, Jen Dirksen Archer, Katie Bain Eskridge ’93, Bill Bunker ’90, and John Murchinson ’91. All look forward to bringing their electrifying moves to the dance floor in Hanover at the next reunion.”\n\nI learned that classmate and renowned sports and entertainment attorney Tyrone Thomas has recently joined Holland & Knight as a partner in its Washington, D.C., office. Tyrone came to the firm from Mintz Levin, where he was a partner in the sports and entertainment practice. Tyrone’s name is nationally recognized in both collegiate and professional athletics, and he represents and advises executives on employment, consulting, and executive compensation agreements. He is a legal analyst for cross-industry news outlets such as The New York Times, ESPN, Forbes, Bloomberg, Sports Illustrated, The Chronicle of Higher Education, Sports Business Journal, and University Business.\n\nKeep me in the loop with your news, and I’ll continue to pass the information to our classmates.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHi, fellow ’94s! How’s 2022 feeling so far for you? It’s a big year for many of us. Those who were not already 50 are hitting that milestone birthday this year. For me, big birthdays are a fun excuse to see old friends. Before you read too much into that comment, I truly mean long-standing, enduring friends, not friends of an advanced age!\n\nMy husband, Ken Davis,and I recently met up with Gwin Pitman Teasdale and Elissa Slovik Gaies in Denver to celebrate Gwin’s 50th birthday. Looking youthful and stylish to be sure, we met at a trendy Denver hot spot recommended by local entrepreneur Kathryn Murray Dickinson, who was traveling with her husband and unable to join. Lorien Albala Saumier and Anne Jeffers Weber also joined for the weekend at Gwin’s home near Boulder. We had plenty of laughs reminiscing about Dartmouth and our various exploits. Looking back, it didn’t feel as though our Dartmouth years were as long ago as they really are. How are you celebrating and reconnecting with Dartmouth friends around 50th birthday celebrations?\n\nAndrew Smith released his debut science fiction novel, Our Lady of the Artilects, which hit several Amazon bestsellers lists. Writing as Andrew Gillsmith, he captured an interesting perspective of the sci-fi world that critics describe as part artificial intelligence, part spirituality, entirely thought-provoking, and impossible to put down. Andrew lives in St. Louis, Missouri, with his wife, Cheryl, and two sons.\n\nPlease drop me a note and let me know what is spinning in your world. I look forward to sharing your news in the next column.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHi, ’94s! As class secretary, I wanted to share the sad news that our classmate Gillian “Jill” Feldman Higman passed away on January 24 after an extended illness.\n\nAs many of you remember Jill, she greeted friends with a huge smile, her bouncy, curly hair, and signature enthusiasm. Jill came to Dartmouth from Lincoln, Rhode Island, and she immediately joined the equestrian team and served as a football manager. Katherine Maguire remembers Jill as her fellow football manager, confidante, partner in crime, and irreplaceable friend.\n\nJill’s intellectual curiosity took her first across Europe, armed with her love and skill for global languages, for two study-abroad experiences, and later to the Duke University Fuqua School of Business. While at Fuqua Matt Hergott, Ken Davis,and I spent lots of time with Jill, recounting Dartmouth memories and making new ones through classes, dinners, corporate recruiting, and a few bottles of Opus One.\n\nAfter earning her M.B.A., Jill returned to Deloitte in Chicago and dove into the challenging work of strategic consulting. Her career in healthcare strategy started at Deloitte before moving to the Aetna group, where her keen insights were invaluable throughout the turbulent changes in the healthcare sector. Jill married Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Daniel Higman in April 2004 in Bermuda, and the couple welcomed daughter April Rose in May 2005. By this time, the family was settled in the picturesque seaside community of Cape May, New Jersey. Throughout Jill’s life, she embraced her passions for people, Dartmouth, and horses with unbridled enthusiasm. She greeted old friends with a bounce, smile, and hug. She remained an active Dartmouth volunteer, serving as an alumni admission interviewer and the district enrollment director for her area. She continued to work with horses by supporting horseback riding for disabled children and working on equine rescue. Jill is survived by Daniel and April as well as her parents, Susan and Stephen Higman ’68. You may find a full obituary at dartmouthalumnimagazine.com.\n\nI also received an update from Monserrat Kim, spouse of George Kim, who died in May 2019 after his battle with cancer. She has been working on a project in his honor.\n\nMontserrat shares, “In dealing with our loss I looked for ways to help other families in a similar situation. One area that I found lacking was services and communication about cancer for children with sick parents. To address this, I created My Dad and the Dragon, a children’s picture book that honestly describes what it is like when your father is diagnosed with cancer through the allegory of a cancer dragon. Cameron, the main character, openly shows family life, fears, and joys to young readers.”\n\nOne hundred percent of profits from the sale of this book will be donated to social service organizations that help children with sick parents. You can check out this beautifully illustrated book at whenadragoncomes.org/love-george for a free digital copy.\n\nMy last update comes from a press release announcing the selection of Brad Baca as the 14th president of Western Colorado University. A Colorado native, Brad came to Dartmouth as a first-generation college student and majored in government. After returning to his home state, Brad earned a master’s in public policy from the University of Colorado-Boulder. He established strong relationships with Colorado lawmakers and colleagues in higher education to become an effectual and impactful leader. Prior to his presidential appointment Brad served as the executive vice president and chief operating officer for Western Colorado University. Congratulations, Brad!\n\nThat’s it for this column, and I welcome your update any time.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHi, ’94s. I have a few bits of news to share with a common thread—children who are graduating. Yes, many of us have children reaching educational milestones, from elementary moving-up ceremonies and high school graduations to (gulp) college graduations.\n\nAs you may recall, classmates Cameron Matheson and Aleise McCann Matheson were married shortly after college, and perhaps they were even the first in our class to tie the knot within weeks of our June graduation. As goes life, they are already happy parents of a college graduate! They watched their eldest daughter, Daria, graduate from Wake Forest University last summer—with the ceremony delayed 16 months due to Covid-19. It sounds as though this recognition may be coming two years late, but congratulations! To think, at the time, I was bitter when our Dartmouth graduation was moved inside due to threatening rains that never came. Only in recent years has that minor inconvenience seemed almost forgettable compared to the rigmarole of commencements today. In additional news from the Matheson-McCann family, Aleise sold her Irish dance studio several years ago, and she has been spending more time with their younger daughters—who, judging from Facebook, seem to be deeply involved in the performing arts. Cameron is an attorney and shareholder at McGonigle, PC.\n\nLai Heng Foong is a doctor and specialist who works at different hospitals throughout Sydney, Australia. She has recently been appointed as the chair of the New South Wales emergency department community of practice for Covid-19 response. She regularly speaks at health symposiums and is a contributor to the Australian Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health. Aside from work, she is also a proud mother, whose eldest son, Sebi, graduated from high school in December. (Fun fact: As it turns out, Australian schools operate on a calendar year and hold graduation in late fall, rather than in May or June.)\n\nLast, I must thank my favorite, reliable, anonymous source, whom I affectionately think of as my own ‘Deep Throat,’ for these and many other newsy nuggets. You know who you are, and I am going to be nominating you as our next class secretary!\n\nPlease share updates, your graduation memories, or news of your own graduates for a future Dartmouth Alumni Magazine column.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHi, ’94s! One of the upsides of serving as class secretary is receiving an unexpected email from a classmate. It’s easy to get into the daily delete-next rhythm when cruising through the unsolicited solicitations and general junk mail typically littering my inbox. When I find a personal note from a classmate tucked among the nonsense, it makes my day.\n\nSo, my thanks to Kelvin Leung for making my day back in early November and for sharing much of the news you’ll read in this column.\n\nJed Kaplan, professor of earth sciences at the University of Hong Kong, led a geological and geomorphological boat excursion to a national park in Hong Kong for the local Dartmouth club. He has led similar trips for the Royal Geographical Society of Hong Kong, and recently Jed used his expertise to entertain and teach his fellow alumni and family. Kelvin shared an insight about Hong Kong, noting that although it is known primarily as a metropolis, it has a few national parks. As one of the trip attendees eloquently described it on social media, “The granite of New Hampshire found its way into Hong Kong’s igneous rock formations this afternoon—super educational and enjoyable geological tour led by professor Jed Kaplan!”\n\nDavid Cohen is currently a law professor at Drexel University. He coauthored a book titled Obstacle Course: The Everyday Struggle to Get an Abortion in America, which has been selected for an honorable mention for the 2021 Adele E. Clarke Book Award. Congratulations, David!\n\nMaggi Leung has recently been appointed as professor of international development studies at the University of Amsterdam. She earned her Ph.D. from Bremen University in Germany and taught at various universities in Hong Kong and Germany before moving to Amsterdam with her German husband and two sons. I appreciate Kelvin’s commentary alongside the updates. He writes, “For the record, [Maggi and I] are not related—except that we both have New Hampshire granite in our muscles and our brains.”\n\nShoshana Leis has taken a path less traveled by, and it has definitely made all the difference to her communities. She is currently serving as a rabbi of two separate synagogues. “Rabbi Shosh,” as she is called by members of her congregations, has navigated the dual duties by leaning on her Judaic core values, which include a commitment to justice in leading her congregations through current issues from polarizing politics to the social and emotional health of young people to community diversity. She also habitually reaches out to other religious leaders for mutually applicable methodologies that she can utilize to support her congregants. Shoshana lives in upstate New York outside of New York City with her husband, Rabbi Ben Newman, her two sons, and two dogs.\n\nPlease send me your news to share with classmates in the next Dartmouth Alumni Magazine.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nI have two bits of news, hot off the presses (literally) to share with you.\n\nUnder “Don’t Judge a Book by Its Cover”: Wendy Tamis Robbins released her first book this past May. The Box: An Invitation to Freedom from Anxiety chronicles her journey to finding freedom from anxiety, obsessive compulsive, and panic disorders that started when she was just 6 years old. She included stories about her time at Dartmouth, when she struggled with depression and suicide ideation. The book became an Amazon No. 1 bestseller in August in four categories: mental illness, depression, stress management, and self-esteem self-help. While still practicing law as senior counsel at Holland + Knight, she has added coaching, corporate wellness speaker, and mental health advocate to her resume. She lives with her husband and his two teens in Marblehead, Massachusetts. You can find more about Wendy’s mental health journey and her articles, podcast appearances, and services at wendytamisrobbins.com. Since I’m pretty podcast crazy, I’m looking forward to the Pretty Panicked Podcast, which Wendy is launching in 2022.\n\nAuthor and business owner Thatcher Wine has written another book, The Twelve Monotasks: Do One Thing at a Time to Do Everything Better. Thatcher shared that this book “combines my personal experience with research into neuroscience, productivity, and mindfulness. As I navigated a number of challenges in recent years—cancer, divorce, parenting, and managing a small business—I thought a lot about where our attention goes and how to control it. The book provides a clear path for everyone to re-learn how to do one thing at a time (instead of all the tech-enabled multitasking we tend to do) in order to become more productive, less stressed, and happier.”\n\nI’ve been mining a few more updates that I can’t wait to share, but they are not quite ready for this column. How’s that for a cliff hanger? Please send me your verified, vetted updates and stay tuned for more class news in the next issue of the alumni magazine.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHi classmates! When my inbox is empty of news, I must use my investigative tool kit to troll for news to share; thank you, Facebook and LinkedIn. Luckily, I mined some good news and professional accomplishments to share about Matt Feeley. Matt earned his law degree from Boston College and master’s in international relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. After clerking with the U.S. Court of International Trade, he practiced law in Miami, specializing in international and anti-corruption law for many, many, many years. (It’s been a good many of those since we graduated.) He now serves as special assistant U.S. attorney at the U.S. Department of Justice. Matt also authored an article on anti-corruption that was recently published in The International Lawyer.\n\nJust when I thought our Class Notes would have to end here, I received an update from Kelvin Leung. Thank you, Kelvin! He is living in Hong Kong and involved with the Dartmouth Club of Hong Kong, through which he reconnected with Jed Kaplan.Since graduating from Dartmouth, Jed weaved his way across the world. He earned his Ph.D. in plant ecology from Lund University in Sweden and worked throughout Europe for almost two decades. (As I said, it has been many, many, many years.) Now Jed is serving as an earth science professor at the University of Hong Kong. While I am not able to include the photo that Kelvin shared with me here in this column, you can picture a snapshot of two handsome, spry, young men holding up a faded, creased, well-loved memento of years gone by: “The Freshman Book 1994.” Kelvin and Jed, please bring that decrepit relic to our next class reunion!\n\nKelvin also shared some exciting news about his friend and our classmate Pankaj Dugar. While Pankaj has had numerous impressive tech accomplishments, he is more recently known as the father to future Dartmouth class of 2025 superstar Akhand. Welcome to Dartmouth, Akhand! As Pankaj is used to handling big things, as evidenced in his prolific career in big data analytics, he will handle his son’s big move to the East Coast from their home in the San Francisco Bay Area with his usual aplomb.\n\nAs life ticks back to a new normal, many of us will be ushering in rather momentous birthdays during the coming year. Please keep me and your classmates posted on how you celebrate the big 5-0 and send your more ordinary news too. No news is too big or too small to share with your Dartmouth friends.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 03755; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHi, 94s! I have lots of news to report and not too many words to do it all justice. That’s enough preamble; let’s get straight to it!\n\nClassmate Erika Katz adds to her media presence with an Instagram Live show. She continues to offer practical and purposeful parenting advice through TV appearances, write her multi-dimensional blog, and spotlight important moments and people who make those moments happen. Just a few months ago Erika interviewed fellow ’94 and New Yorker Dan Garodnick as a featured guest on her show. Dan served for 12 years as a New York City councilmember and now acts as president and CEO of the Riverside Park Conservancy. Dan’s love for his hometown of New York has led him to a career in service to his beloved city. Recently, he recounted the struggle to defeat America’s biggest real estate transaction and preserve middle-class communities in his former district. His book, Saving Stuyvesant Town: How One Community Defeated the Worst Real Estate Deal in History, was released this past April to five-star reviews on Amazon.\n\nOzy media has named Sonya Dyhrman as a “breakthrough scientist you need to know.” As yet another New Yorker, Sonya has been educating some of the finest minds at Columbia University (we all know where the very finest minds can be found), where she serves as a professor of earth and environmental sciences. As a marine biologist and microbiologist, she is pioneering work to decode the tiniest interactions in microbes and understand their significant ramifications on the global food chain. She shares her passion for marine life and the entire oceanic food chain with younger students through her development of ocean science literacy initiatives for physical and virtual classrooms.\n\nAs a final news bit, I may have accidentally tricked a more modest classmate into providing an update. Brigid Pasulka spent years living and traveling in Europe before moving back to Illinois and settling into a career in writing, as both a teacher and a novelist. For the past 11 years Brigid has been running a writing center at a magnet high school in downtown Chicago. She helps hundreds of students draft and polish their personal essays for college applications. She has even offered to provide advice to any classmates or classmates’ children who might want some guidance in the college essay writing process, an offer that comes at the perfect time for those who have rising high school seniors. Brigid has used her experiences living throughout eastern Europe in her novels. As a sneak peak, her forthcoming novel is set in 1980s East Germany; her next project will be about the underground in a Soviet-controlled Ukraine.\n\nHappy summer to you! I’ll be waiting for your update!\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 03755; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nA little birdie told me about a bird enthusiast in our class. This nugget of news from an unnamed classmate led me on an online gawking tour of some of the most beautiful wildlife photography I’ve had the privilege to see. Classmate Paul Morf may not have started photographing birds and other animals as art; in fact, he simply snapped photos of birds and insects as a reference so he could identify them later. However, these newly discovered talents in photography, as well as his deliberate efforts to focus deeper onto his subjects, morphed (yep, I went there) into a passion for capturing everything from the extraordinary species in the Galapagos to ordinary migrations of birds. On his website he notes that nature photography is “transformative” because its expression is interactive and alters the artists as well as the viewer. While Paul still views himself as a “hobbyist,” you will appreciate his artistry. Although I didn’t hear about this news from Paul, I hope he will share any news from his home in Ely, Iowa. Check out his website at Morfsylvania.com.\n\nMark Giordono shared an update from life in 2020 as, like many of us, his professional and personal life blurred and mutated over the past year. Mark is featured in a recent business article, where he discusses how he used his various life experiences to adapt in the work-from-home science experiment as vice president of development and alumni relations at the nonprofit For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST).\n\nIf any of you have children involved in the FIRST Lego League or FIRST Robotics competitions, you’re familiar with the widespread, STEM opportunities that FIRST provides for extracurricular exploration for students. Throughout this past year, in improvised workspaces and remote learning, Mark was uniquely positioned as a male executive in a primarily female organization to view and approach the organization’s mission. Seeing his coworkers as caregivers as well as professionals gave him new insights.\n\nA self-described “bleeding-heart do-gooder,” Mark has a heart for service, as exemplified in his Peace Corps work in western Africa. Additionally, after graduating from MIT’s Sloan School of Management, Mark has worked in both the private and public sector. Mark lives in the beautiful college town of Corvallis, Oregon, with his wife and three children.\n\nThat’s all the news. Please send me an update for the next column.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 03755; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHi, fellow classmates. As we look ahead to a new year, I posed the following question on the “Dartmouth College Class of 1994” Facebook page: What do you plan to do in 2021 when Covid is no longer a limiting factor?\n\nMore than 25 classmates chimed in with variations of “We want to be around people!” As Aleise McCann Matheson writes,she wants to “have friends over. Lots. All the time.” We are looking forward to visiting family and traveling freely. We miss live music and movie theaters, and we especially miss enjoying these moments with each other. If you missed the Facebook postings, here’s a recap of your classmates’ plans for 2021.\n\nTony Lee keeps it simple and heartfelt with plans to visit family and Dartmouth friends. Katherine Zalios Maguire will take her children to Florida and Greece to reconnect with family. Debra Hofferman Brandt plans to reinstate weekly family dinners with her parents.\n\nShannon M. Sullivan mentions travel abroad—her family plans to “actually use our passports” to connect with extended family and friends in person. Lots of us want new stamps in our passports, too. Julia Caputo Stift wants to see her son living in Canada, Kathleen de Riesthal wants to connect with her husband’s family in Spain, and Nina Cook Silitch wants to “get back to the Alps—my old stomping grounds.” Colleen Linehan Haskell and Kelly Bell Lytle should book seats together, because they’ll go anywhere in Europe.\n\nJordan Frank looks forward to the good old days of going to a movie theater. Remember that? It seems like ages since we’ve shared popcorn, let alone air, with other cinephiles. Others miss live performing arts, from Broadway shows to their children’s school choral concerts. Aleise McCann Mathesoncan’t wait for her daughter’s show choir performances and competitions; she is even willing to chaperone the group on a chartered bus trip.\n\nKaty Hayes wants to go out to dinner with family and friends beyond the shadow of a pandemic. I concur because I don’t want to wash any more dishes. Kelly Lytle mentions lingering over good drinks and conversation at a cocktail bar, an activity that gets an “amen” from many corners of our class. While my husband, Ken Davis, never goes on Facebook, if he even has an account, I know he would choose to go to the Nashville Whiskey Festival, which is lively, crowded, and delicious.\n\nWe have some classmates who still love the sweaty dancefloors and miss the mosh pits. In 2021 Ian Cameron will be heading to an “awful bar in Williamsburg or Bushwick” for late-night dancing, along with other movers-and-shakers Alison LeBoeuf, Maggie Lockwood, and Shannon Sullivan.\n\nThe fitness aficionados are looking forward to big races and opportunities to be out in nature. Ruth Maria Marmaril wants to “surf warm, turquoise waters with people who don’t speak the same first language.” Kristin Grosser Tufo, Charis Connell Taylor,and Nina Cook Silitch are looking forward to running—anything from 5ks to qualifying for the Boston marathon. Mike McClure has his sight set on a half-iron man competition.\n\nOur class feedback wouldn’t be complete without a nod to the place common in all of our heart, and this time our classmates are looking forward to visiting Dartmouth as parents. Gates Bryant would like to go to a fall parents’ weekend in Hanover to visit his son and Kelly Lytle is up for a trip to visit her son, Richard. Sara Bone Dyett wants to see her son, Jack, “play Big Green football.”\n\nThe written and unwritten wishes and intentions for 2021 are numerous and ambitious, but I am ever hopeful that by 2022 we’ll have collectively checked these adventures off an inspired, metaphoric to-do list. Send me an update on your progress for the next column.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 03755; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHi, class of ’94. I hope this newsletter finds you well—well, as well as can be expected (sigh). Depending on where you live, you may be working from home or masked-up in a 50-percent-capacity office. You may have children learning virtually or going into school, also masked-up in a 50-percent capacity. Whatever is swirling in your world right now, it probably doesn’t feel normal. A year ago phrases such as “masked-up,” “50-percent capacity,” “hybrid-learning model,” “toilet paper shortage,” “quarantine vs. isolation vs. exposure,” and “Zoom-Zoom-Zoom” weren’t even in our vocabulary, much less our Class Notes!\n\nAs I wind down the final days of summer and pen this article, I am indeed masked-up, functioning at 50-percent capacity, in some vague hybrid shell of myself, feeling a need to hoard paper products from the grocery, and completely and thoroughly Zoom-fatigued. Absolutely, things are better—and hope they are with you as well—but I just miss seeing dear, dear friends from Dartmouth!\n\nWhile Zoom fatigue is real, it’s still the lifeline that keeps businesses, family, and friends connected. After imploring my husband, Ken Davis, to appeal to his fraternity brothers for news, blessedly, a couple took pity and shared their news from their corners of this bizarre, altered world.\n\nI heard from Tom Boldt, who lives in Santa Monica, California, with his wife, Alanna, and beautiful, 5-year-old daughter Caia, “the Etruscan goddess of women and the hearth.” Other than “sanitizing surfaces like we’re suffering from OCD,” he reports that he and Alanna are still practicing acupuncture and Asian medicine. Tom writes, “I hope you can include one of my favorite parts of quarantine, which has been reconnecting with the Alpha Chi Alpha ’94s—your hubby included. I’m sure he’s told you all about it, but it really has been special. Talking with these guys has reminded me of why we were friends 26 years ago.”\n\nHave you heard about Tony Lee’s and Alison LeBouef’sachievements on behalf of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (LLS)? These two impressive classmates and longtime friends have raised an amazing $272,416 in just 10 weeks for the LLS, setting a new Arizona state record. For the past nine years they’ve been volunteering for this great cause, largely in honor and memory of Greg Ferris. The importance of the LLS mission hit closer to home for Tony when his daughter, Sophie, was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome in 2015 and underwent treatment. Five years later, Sophie is well, Tony serves as the chair of the LLS board of trustees Arizona chapter, and he was named its Man of the Year 2020. This year 30 classmates contributed to Tony’s LLS campaign. If you’d like to learn more about LLS, reach out to Tony or Alison.\n\nThe Arthur L. Irving Institute for Energy and Society at Dartmouth recently announced the newest member of its advisory board as none other than classmate David Yeh. Since graduating from the College as a double major in biology and Asian studies, David has been making a lasting footprint in global finance, innovation, and the Obama White House. Today David is a managing director at 3x5 Partners, a top-quartile venture capital firm investing in health and environmental solutions. In Dartmouth’s press release regarding his recent appointment, David said, “My four years at the Big Green set me on my path to be an environmentalist, public servant, and investor. I am honored to return 26 years later to help fight the existential challenge of our time, the climate crisis, by advancing affordable and sustainable energy for all.” You’re making us proud, and we’re excited to hear about your next undertaking!\n\nPlease send me updates and news to share in the next column. Be well.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHi, class of ’94. I have two bits of exciting news to share with you. During the past few months good things have still been happening beneath the overriding arc of alarming headlines, and I’m happy to share them with you below.\n\nPam Kunz has recently moved into a new leadership role at Yale School of Medicine as the leader of gastrointestinal cancer programs. This new position brings Pam and her family to New Haven, Connecticut, from the Palo Alto area in California. Pam joins the Yale team from Stanford University School of Medicine, where she has served as the director of the Stanford neuroendocrine tumor program and leader of the endocrine research group. Prior to both completing her clinical and research fellowship in medical oncology and serving as chief resident in internal medicine at Stanford University, she graduated from Dartmouth Medical School in 2001. Pam’s professional accomplishments are impressive, but I will always remember Pam’s supportive ear and warm smile for her many friends and fellow Tri-Delts. Congratulations and welcome back to the East Coast, Pam!\n\nCongratulations also go out to Elizabeth Cook Donohue,who was inducted into Dartmouth’s Stephen F. Mandel ’52 Society in April. For those of you not familiar with this honor, the Stephen F. Mandel ’52 Society recognizes alumni volunteers who provide distinguished service and visionary leadership for the Dartmouth College Fund. As many of you know, Beth has been an active Dartmouth volunteer for years and an extraordinary class fundraising leader. As a class, we are fortunate to have Beth in this position! Year after year she is constantly willing to serve; she generously gives her time, heart, and energy to the College on behalf of her classmates; and she demonstrates her savvy abilities by meeting and exceeding lofty goals set by the Dartmouth College Fund. Beth deserves the College’s recent recognition and honor, as well as our class’ thanks! Cheers to Beth!\n\nPlease send me updates and news to share in the next column.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nGreetings, fellow classmates, from one shelter-in-place home to another. I hardly know what to write in a column such as this one, especially since I’m writing it in April, but you won’t see it until the end of June. Who knows what will happen during a two-month period, and I’m certainly not going to hazard a guess. For the past six weeks I’ve been hunkering down in the greater Nashville area, following the news, thinking about friends, and reevaluating the importance of community support.\n\nThe value we place on community is one thing that most Dartmouth alumni have in common. The strength and dynamism of our community remain top reasons students choose Dartmouth over other fine colleges and universities. Even in the midst of this crisis, we still find ways to connect to this strong community in ways we didn’t imagine when we were new arrivals in Hanover back in September 1990.\n\nLike many of you, Zoom has become a lifeline and necessity in work and fun. Just yesterday I connected with classmates Elissa Slovik Gaies, Marlyse Haward, Kelly Bell Lytle, Lorien Albala Somier, Gwin Pitman Teasdale,and Anne Jeffers Weber. My husband, Ken Davis, meets up for Wednesday Alpha Chi meetings, albeit virtually and 30 years later. There will be 10 to 20 brothers checking in with smiles and stories from all over the country, but I’ve yet to hear the promised singing from the boisterous crew. Ken confessed that, while he loves catching up with these guys, my friends’ conversations seem more intellectual and insightful. My response was, “Well, naturally.” (This is an invitation for a rebuttal!)\n\nSeriously though, it’s easy to make time for a quick virtual happy hour in lockdown, but I am increasingly thankful for the energizing and hopeful connections and the solidarity of my Dartmouth community. I’d love to hear stories about how you are connecting with Dartmouth friends and groups during these weeks and months. I know some of you have time to share a story or two with me.\n\nStay safe, stay well, and stay connected to your Dartmouth friends.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHi, class of ’94. Let’s jump right into three nuggets of news.\n\nThis past year, Harvard University Press published the newest book by classmate Sarah E. Wagner. The book, What Remains: Bringing America’s Missing Home from the Vietnam War, has been part of Sarah’s life for more than a decade, with her research beginning back in 2008. According to the publisher, Sarah worked “closely with veterans, members of the military, policy makers, and forensic scientists, as well as families and loved ones of the missing.” Through the portraits of several veterans and their families, as well as the work of forensic scientists seeking to identify remains, Wagner explores the ongoing toll of the Vietnam War.\n\nAt heart, Sarah is a social anthropologist who is nothing short of an expert in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United States, and the effects of war. Her interests and expertise have guided her throughout her career, which includes earning a Ph.D. at Harvard University, beginning in her current position as an associate professor of anthropology at George Washington University, and, of course, tackling her research and writing on important and weighty cultural issues.\n\nSuzie Fromer sends an update of her latest endeavors, many of which are rifts on interests from her Dartmouth days. She writes, “I’ve actually recently returned to jewelry making after a long hiatus; back at Dartmouth I worked for four years as a student teaching assistant in the Clafin jewelry studio in the basement of the Hop. Pretty sure I’m not allowed to have an acetylene torch in the house, so I’ve gotten into beading as a less risky jewelry endeavor, and I’ve recently even opened up my own Etsy shop, LittleHookCo, www.etsy.com/shop/LittleHookCo.”\n\nSuzie’s update includes so many projects and causes that I feel shamed by my own lazy life! She has crafted a line of awareness jewelry pieces for causes such as food allergies and autism pride; volunteers at a local repair café, where her free repairs keep things out of the landfills; chairs the board of the Irvington, New York, farmers market; and helps organize sustainability initiatives with action, such as compost collection and carting. What is she not doing? She is no longer writing this column bimonthly (which she did faithfully for 10 years)!\n\nI received an update from our class contact at Dartmouth Alumni Magazine with exciting news about Matthew Zavod. After serenading the throngs as a member of the Dartmouth Aires, Matt studied medicine at Thomas Jefferson University. Now Matt is not only a practicing otolaryngologist and plastic surgeon in Woodland, California, but also a children’s book author. Dr. Ridiculopickulopot and the Shot by our very own Doc Zavod was published in October 2019. The book helps ease the anxiety of the dreaded “shot visit” that parents and young patients know all too well. Matt uses the humorous story to relieve children’s trepidations by showing them that doctors and shots need not be feared. Congratulations on the adorable and helpful book, Matt.\n\nNow that a new year and decade are solidly underway, I invite you to share a brief overview of the past decade or even the anticipated events of the next decade. Either way, aim for a several-sentence snapshot of life, longer than a tweet but shorter than a soapbox Facebook tirade. Send them to me, and we’ll all enjoy reading the news in the next iteration of Class Notes.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHappy new year, class of ’94!\n\nI received one piece of alumni news from the College, about classmate Randall Akee. In a recent article on the College website, Randall is featured as a one-time liberal arts undergrad who has gone on to make his mark as an influential faculty member of color. Randall is an associate professor at the University of California, Los Angeles in the department of public policy and American Indian studies, and he is currently spending the year at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., as a fellow in economic studies.\n\nRandall has had a distinctive career, one that showcases the interdisciplinary nature of a liberal arts education, such as he received at Dartmouth. After graduating Randall worked on several American Indian reservations and with Canadian First Nations and Pacific Island nations and he worked in economic development for the state of Hawaii. He has conducted extensive research on the political and economic factors affecting race and ethnic mobility and education attainment. Additionally, he has taught students in the classroom, sharing his insights and encouraging deepened thinking.\n\nHe completed his Ph.D. at Harvard University in June 2006. Prior to his doctoral studies Randall earned a master’s in international and development economics at Yale University.\n\nIf you’d like to read more about Randall, you will find the article about him and other Dartmouth alumni who are now influential faculty of color at various universities around the country at https://sites.dartmouth.edu/alumnisymposium/alumni-bios.\n\nPlease send your updates to me. I need your news!\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nFall is in full swing, both in Hanover with students settled into the life and rhythms of the trimester and in our hometowns across the globe. This fall is my first back in the South in almost 20 years. While I am enjoying it tremendously, it doesn’t quite meet the quintessential autumn ideal of Hanover in October. You can’t beat Hanover’s colors, the brisk morning air on your way to “the 9” that was way too early (why did you sign up for that one again?), the games on Saturday at Memorial Field, the sounds of the band having a blast (no pun intended) and boosting Big Green spirit, the feel of oversized Dartmouth sweatshirts, the smells of a blazing bonfire, and the early darkness of shortening days. Fall is absolutely the best term in Hanover. If you have a different opinion, please share it with me. I’d love to include some of your memories and insights in seasonally appropriate submissions.\n\nClassmate Thatcher Wine continues his pursuit of his passion of reading, books, and libraries as the founder of Juniper Books (for more on him, see page 60). Thatcher writes, “The Dartmouth libraries feature very prominently in my path to becoming a bookseller and library designer.” And now Thatcher is adding “author” to his illustrative entrepreneurial career with his first book, For the Love of Books. Thatcher’s work during the past two decades has made his library designs and beautiful book binding the envy of any bibliophile and made covetable gift lists in many magazines, such as Oprah, Elle, and Vanity Fair. Perhaps a wish list item of your own for this year?\n\nI also received an update from Eden Abram, whose lifelong love of animals led her to St. Augustine, Florida. Anyone who knows Eden remembers her talent as an equestrian and lover of all animals. I remember visiting her Wisconsin home and seeing her ease with farm animals and her beloved dogs alike. After several years at Berkeley and about 15 years in New Hampshire, Eden and her husband, Jethro, moved to St. Augustine, where they run Another Chance Ranch along with Eden’s parents, Pam and Steve Abram ’66. Their farm sanctuary specializes in senior and disabled dogs and any abused, neglected, or exploited domestic animals. You can follow Eden’s worthwhile efforts on social media or through www.anotherchanceranch.org.\n\nI close with the sad news of George Kim’sdeath in May of this year. George was a member of Alpha Chi Alpha and was rarely seen without his cheese lid. I remember spending lots of time with George in his Mid-Mass dorm room during Sophomore Summer, when he was roommates with my now husband, Ken Davis. While at Dartmouth George enjoyed his foreign study program experience, double-majored in history and economics, earned the distinction of Presidential Scholar, and dabbled in the Robert Burns Society.\n\nGeorge is survived by his wife, Montserrat, and daughters Kerala and Nola. Montse is collecting stories about George—all kinds of stories, older or newer, meaningful or routine, funny or sad, wholesome or even the not-so-much—to share with her children as they grow older. Would you please take a few minutes to share these? I will gladly facilitate the connection.\n\nI continue to look in my inbox for your updates with a little trepidation, a lot of anticipation, and always elation. Please send them!\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nThis class column comes to you on the heels of our 25th class reunion in Hanover. By all accounts it was a blast, full of quality time with dear friends and big fun with the larger groups on the Green. Class president Deme Navab Taleghani sends this update after the weekend: “We had a record-breaking 300 classmates make it back to Hanover to celebrate our 25th reunion. People traveled from all over to be a part of this incredible weekend. Classmates reconnected with old friends and made some new connections, and we were reminded just how magnificent Dartmouth is and what a special place it holds in all our lives. Thanks to the dedication of the reunion planning committee, which was led by dynamic duo Jen Susie Hagelston and Samantha Stoddard and included Shelia Bassiri Ahmed, Jordan Stern, Kristin Siuda Rosenbaum, Christina Dowding Nicholas, and Catherine Adams Stanzler. Their contributions made this the best reunion yet. Thank you, Jen and Sam, for an incredible and action-packed weekend. We appreciate and value your determined work and service to the College.\n\n“We had two riveting ’94 panels: the writers’ panel, which included Christine Carter, Brigid Pasulka, Jonathan Good, and Lisa Kocian, and the entrepreneurs’ panel, which included Alison Andrew Reyes, Lisa Cloitre, Steven Norall, and Trevor Burgess. Our class dinner on Baker lawn was magical, only superseded by the culminating celebration with the Dartmouth Idol all-stars and spectacular fireworks. We capped off the evening dancing and rocking it out on the dance floor until the wee hours of the morning. Thank you all for making this weekend unforgettable. We missed all those who couldn’t make it back but look forward to seeing everyone at our 30th reunion in 2024.”\n\nIn other class news, the American Academy of Microbiology elected Sonya Dyhrman as a new fellow in the prestigious and oldest life science organization. After graduating from Dartmouth she earned her Ph.D. in marine biology from Scripps Institution of Oceanography. She now serves as a microbial oceanographer at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and as an associate professor at Columbia University.\n\nPlease send your stories from reunion and updates of summer fun. Also take a minute to check out our class Facebook page; there are some fantastic pictures from reunion you’ll want to see!\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nAs our reunion approaches, I write this update, knowing that by the time you hold the Dartmouth Alumni Magazine in your hands you will have been to campus, visited your favorite old stomping grounds, caught up with old friends, and shared new connections. Please tell me the highlights of your time in Hanover! What stories can you share from the long weekend? We want to relive the nostalgic and happy reunion through your anecdotes and news through the coming months.\n\nSadly, the only news I have received is not welcomed news, but nonetheless you should know of the death of fellow classmate Christine Susie Wu. Tina, to friends, embraced the granite and mountains of New Hampshire from her own Smoky Mountain hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee. After earning her undergraduate degree, she returned to her roots and eventually to her hometown to earn her Ph.D. in psychology in 2006 from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville. She became a beloved professor, described by students as “the best” and “an all-time favorite” on a school Facebook page. After a lengthy battle with cancer, she passed away in February. Surviving Tina are her beautiful son, Benjamin, husband Paul LeBel, sister, brother-in-law, and parents.\n\nI invite you to share memories of Tina with me so I can include them in the next column and on our class Facebook page.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nDo you remember walking across the Green on a beautiful late spring day and seeing alumni run into each other? They would stop right there, hug and back-slap, and make up for lost time. Their huge smiles, wise eyes, and expressive faces hinted at their rich, interesting, and much-lived experiences. Their smile lines, gray hair, and class-of-60-something nametags screamed that they had graduated a few decades earlier. They looked happy to be home, they looked full of stories, and they looked old. Well, friends, we are the new set of old folks about to descend upon campus with our own connections to make and stories to tell. I can’t wait to see all of you old hags in just a couple of weeks at our epic reunion.\n\nClass president Deme Navab Taleghani sends this update: “Please join us for our 25th reunion up in Hanover from Thursday, June 13, to Sunday, June 16. If you haven’t registered yet, no problem. You can still register online at http://alumni.dartmouth.edu/reunions/class-1994 or in person at our class tent when you arrive.\n\n“Reunion highlights will include a private group tour of the newly renovated Hood Museum just for ’94s, an architectural walking tour of campus, navigating college admissions workshop for families, and panels featuring ’94 artists, writers, and entrepreneurs. We will cap off an amazing weekend with a class dinner on Baker lawn for the 250th celebration of Dartmouth.”\n\nNot only is there time to register for reunion, but there is also time to contribute to our class gift. Every single gift, no matter the size, is a vote of confidence for the education we received and the experience we value. Our gift will support financial aid for Dartmouth students and support Dartmouth’s continued commitment to enroll brilliant students, talented athletes, visionary entrepreneurs, gifted artists and humanists, bridge-builders and change-makers, regardless of their ability to pay tuition. Reunion head agent Beth Donohoe Cook shared that classmates have already contributed enough money to support more than 50 Dartmouth College Fund scholars at $50,000 each. How many more students can we support together with our gift before the end of reunion? If you’d like to make your commitment today, you can give at dartgo.org/D94.\n\nIn other news, I heard from Mike McClure. Mike and his wife, Valerie, are living the dream, as is their son, Ryan. Ryan will join the class of 2023 at Dartmouth! Mike writes, “It will be fun for me to relive my college years through Ryan’s eyes. Being the big skier that he is, it seemed that a nonnegotiable requirement in a college was that it owned its own ski mountain.”\n\nMike has lived in the Minneapolis area since graduating and has been at Verint Systems for close to 15 years, in sales of customer engagement solutions. His part-time “dad” jobs include shuttle driver to various sports practices and youth baseball coach for 13 straight years. Though he claims his win-loss record isn’t stellar, he earns points for showing up.\n\nHe shared bits about classmates as well. He met up with Deb Connell Nagorka last year when he was in Tampa, Florida, on business. They enjoyed reliving the glory days of working at Thayer Dining Hall. He caught up with his freshman-year, South-Mass neighbor Chris Greene in December. Chris even showed up for lunch wearing his ’94 jersey. Chris, please wear your jersey to reunion! I’m impressed that you have it and that it still fits!\n\nAs always, I welcome your news and updates.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHi, ’94s! As you look forward to longer, warmer days ahead, remember to mark your calendars for our 25th reunion at Dartmouth from June 13 to 16. You will be invited to register for our 25th reunion online, so please be on the lookout for a link coming to you soon!\n\nIn the meantime, if you are still interested in contributing your time, talents, and resources to our class and the College, we welcome your input! Please contact our class president Deme Navab Taleghani or me if you would like to join the planning committee.\n\nI have only received one bit of class news, but it is good news to share. The Jewish Sports Heritage Association (JSHA) is honoring Jay Fiedler with its first annual Lifetime Achievement Award. In the JSHA press release, we are reminded that, after Jay’s record-setting career at Dartmouth, he went on to play 10 seasons in the NFL, many of those years with the Miami Dolphins. The JSHA notes that one of its goals is to ensure that “the deeds of the past shall inspire the achievements of the future.” With his academic achievement, personal character, and on-field accomplishments, Jay is an inspiration to all aspiring young student-athletes. Congratulations on the well-deserved honor!\n\nThe next update will come to you in two months from my new hometown. As I type, my family is moving from Pennsylvania to Tennessee. My husband, Ken Davis, and I would love to see you in Nashville, Tennessee, whether you’re there to give your music career one more shot or just enjoying the fun with family and friends. Y’all let me know if you’re in town, and don’t forget to send me your news to share with classmates!\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 520 Meadowlark Lane, Brentwood, TN 37027; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nIn just more than six months we will meet in Hanover to celebrate and reminisce about our years at Dartmouth College. If you haven’t marked your calendar, stop here! Pick up your device of choice and block out June 13-16 on your calendar. We want you to be part of our 25th reunion!\n\nNow that you have appropriately saved the date, there is still a lot that needs to happen during the next six months. A snow-covered campus needs to thaw and burst with shades of green; days need to lengthen so we can linger under our class tent; you need to contact your friends and make a plan to meet up in June; and you need to register for reunion! Registration will be online later this winter and early spring. You will be invited to link to the registration page electronically.\n\nReunion co-chairs Jen Susie Hagelston and Samantha Stoddard welcome your help and input in planning day or evening events. If you are interested in volunteering, contact me or class president Deme Navab Taleghani at demetra.taleghani@gmail.com. During our reunion we will also vote on a new slate of class officers. Anyone interested in a position and to find out about exciting ways to re-engage with fellow classmates, other Dartmouth grads, as well as the College, reach out to Deme for more information.\n\nDuring the next six months you can work on sharpening memory recall with a class-favorite challenge, Flashback Fridays. Deme will continue sending these fun, adorable, and somewhat regrettable pictures of classmates through email on Fridays. If you are not receiving these and would like to, please let me know so you can be added to the class list.\n\nAre you too excited to wait until June to reconnect? You’re in luck! We have several mini-reunions planned for 2019 in various cities, such as Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and Boston. As the exact locations and dates are finalized, we will share them with you through email and Facebook. If you would like to plan a mini-reunion in your city, please contact Catherine Adams Stanzler at catherine@stanzler.net. She will help you make that happen.\n\nIf you like the friendly competition of Flashback Fridays and don’t want to wait until June, then you are going to like this new challenge. Class leaders are running another competition for the person who attends the most mini-reunions leading up to our 25th reunion in Hanover in June. The rules are straightforward. You must send Deme or Catherine a photo from each of the mini-reunions you attend. The classmate who attends the most mini-reunions will win the grand prize of (drum roll) a free admission ticket to reunion and, perhaps more importantly, bragging rights.\n\nStay tuned for more updates and news in two months.\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 1664 Cambridge Court, Bethlehem, PA 18015; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nCongratulations to Kate Novack on her documentary film! Kate directed and produced The Gospel According to André, whichmade its debut at the Toronto International Film Festival last year and opened nationwide in May. Her film tells the emotional story of tastemaker André Leon Talley, a black man who grew up in a segregated Southern community where he would have been the last person expected to set fashion standards for women across the country and world. Yet Talley’s influence in style at Women’s Wear Daily, W,and Vogue magazines made him an unexpected trendsetter and a prominent voice and editor in magazine publishing. Kate captures Talley’s legendary persona and captivates her audience with impeccable storytelling pace. Can you tell I liked it? The film is available to stream through several services.\n\nI caught up with Christie Cameron Zawtocki after I heard she had been honored by the Charlotte Business Journal as a “women in business” award recipient. The business journal recognizes 25 women who have made a difference in their workplaces and are blazing trails for other women. Christie shares that she is currently a principal engineer and shareholder at Hart & Hickman, the largest environmental consulting firm in Charlotte, North Carolina. She writes, “I’ve been living in Charlotte for the past 12 years with my husband, Geoffrey Zawtocki, who works in the commercial real estate industry. We have two amazing kids, Stephanie (13) and Jason (12), who keep us busy with their many school activities and sports. Stephanie is a passionate soccer player (following in her father’s footsteps) and Jason is an avid golf player with dreams of playing on the PGA tour one day.” Perhaps Dartmouth will consider recruiting early, early, early decision students for the golf and soccer teams?\n\nI’ve also received more news from screenwriter Jana Friedman Brown on her film project, The Divide. The independent drama-Western has been enjoying a successful festival run. It earned distinctions, accolades, and honors at the Albuquerque Film & Music Experience, Illinois International Film Festival, and WorldFest-Houston for best feature film. Actors Luke Colombero and Perry King both won awards for acting in a crowded field of independent films. With all the recognition her film is receiving, Jana modestly writes, “I am most proud of the support the film is getting from the Alzheimer’s Association. The Divide is the story of an aging rancher suffering from the onset of Alzheimer’s and trying to reconcile with his past and with his estranged daughter.” The Divide will continue its festival run in the fall. Visit www.thedividemotionpicture.com to find news and information on future screenings in your area.\n\nThat’s all the news for this issue of Dartmouth Alumni Magazine. The next issue could feature you as we move toward our 25th reunion in less than a year. Just send me a note, and you’re in!\n\n—Laura Hardegree Davis, 1664 Cambridge Court, Bethlehem, PA, 18015; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nNo matter how many years pass since we graduated from college (almost 25, but who’s counting?), I still regard the year on a school calendar rather than the traditional calendar. Maybe it’s my constant craving for summer vacation, maybe it’s keeping the master calendar for my family with school-aged kids, but regardless, August feels likes an ending, and September feels like a fresh start.\n\nWhat “fresh start” lies ahead of you? Consider sending me your news, as you read through the updates of your classmates below.\n\nLen Mead is sporting a new job these days. He reports: “After seven years managing the content at Comcast SportsNet New England (home of the Celtics among other things), I had the opportunity to shift west and become general manager of NBC Sports Northwest (home of the Trail Blazers among other things). My wife, Amanda MacMillan ’95, and three kids are still in Littleton, Massachusetts, and I’m doing the world’s worst commute. I fly home to Massachusetts most weekends, then hop on an early Monday morning flight out to Portland, Oregon.”\n\nAs long as Len is making that commute, he is making the most of his time on the West Coast and is catching up with a few Dartmouth alums. He hosted Jeff Buehler at a Blazers’ game, and he spent a weekend in Seattle with long-time friend Mike Gardner and his wife, Jenn, and their two children. Calling other West Coasters? Reach out to Len!\n\nHonor Sachs shares her own westbound story. Honor writes, “Well, everything is signed, and the ink is just about dry, so I think it’s safe to share my news: After five wonderful years with an amazing faculty here at West Carolina University, I am moving on. In the fall I’ll be joining the history faculty at the University of Colorado, Boulder. It will not be easy to leave my WCU colleagues, who are among the hardest working people I’ve ever had the privilege of working with. But I am also excited to join a new group of incredible scholars at Boulder. I will be in North Carolina one more year as a fellow at the National Humanities Center before I head out west. Life came at me fast this year, and I am excited and grateful to have a year off to finally write this long-gestating Coleman family book and to embark on a new professional adventure. Thanks to all who helped along the way!” We are looking forward to reading about your next chapter—both literally in your next book and figuratively in a future update in our Class Notes.\n\nMatt Feeley sends news of his interesting and recent career change. After 16 years in private law practice, he has accepted the appointment to serve as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Florida. He writes, “I am assigned to investigate and prosecute healthcare fraud cases. As you might imagine, we have quite a bit of that in south Florida. I would be happy to connect with any classmates who might find themselves passing through Miami.”\n\nKeep the news coming!\n\n—Laura H. Davis, 1664 Cambridge Court, Bethlehem, PA 18015; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nWelcome, summer! At last, long days, warm evenings, and refreshing cocktails on the porch are here after the lingering, drab winter. As you read this picture yourself back at Dartmouth, on the Green, throwing a Frisbee, walking Rip Road, recounting memories with a roommate in front of Mass Row, and reconnecting with old friends under our class tent. One year from now we will be celebrating our 25th reunion doing these very things!\n\nIn a quick message from class president Deme Navab Taleghani, she says, “Start saving airline miles and bring the whole family. The 25th reunion is just us, like Sophomore Summer. Reunion co-chairs will be the dynamic duo of Jen Suhie Hagelston and Samantha Stoddard. In order to make this reunion special and spectacular, we need volunteers to help out on the reunion committee. The more the merrier. Also, since it’s a reunion year, we need to vote on a new slate of class officers. Anyone interested in a position and to find out about exciting ways to re-engage with fellow classmates, other Dartmouth grads, as well as the College, please contact Deme at demetra.taleghani@gmail.com.”\n\nI heard some news from the City of Brotherly Love that Dartmouth’s own Dana J. Ash has been named the head of the 70-attorney products liability and toxic torts practice division at Duane Morris LLP. In Dana’s road to big-time attorney in Philadelphia, he attained his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania. He has extensive experience in the medicolegal world and has represented clients in state and federal courts across the country. Congratulations, Dana!\n\nAcross the country another classmate is making a name for herself in the courtroom. Amy Candido attended the University of Chicago Law School after Dartmouth. Eventually, she “settled” (no pun intended) in San Francisco, where she practices patent and intellectual property law as a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP. Quite the superstar, she has litigated numerous high-profile technology lawsuits across the country, representing both plaintiff and defendant. Maybe you’ve heard about the complex case regarding Waymo, Uber, and self-driving cars? Amy is intimately involved. Legal magazines have named Amy one of the nation’s five top “Intellectual Property Rising Stars” and one of the top 100 women litigators in California.\n\nI received an update from Jana Friedman Brown, and I wanted to share her exciting, splashy news. Jana shares that after seven years of hard work, she is finally seeing her first screenplay come to life on the big screen. She provided this blurb: “The film I wrote, The Divide, has so far been made an official selection of Worldfest-Houston, the Arizona International Film Festival, and the Albuquerque Film & Music Experience. The Divide also earned honors for best Western and best first-time screenwriter from the Los Angeles Film Awards. I have worked with director/actor Perry King to make The Divide a reality. Set in northern California, the film tells the story of Sam Kincaid (“King”), an aging rancher with a failing memory, his estranged and independent-minded daughter, Sarah, and Luke, a migrant ranch hand who finds himself in the midst of a family in crisis. For more, visit www.thedividemotionpicture.com.”\n\nWhen I asked Jana what’s next for her, she added, “I have another screenplay in development and am working on editing my first novel.” Best of luck to you, Jana!\n\nKeep the news coming!\n\n—Laura H. Davis, 1664 Cambridge Court, Bethlehem, PA 18015; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nOur reunion committee is coming together! Class president Deme Navab Taleghani sends this message: “We have at the helm the amazing all-star, power team of Jen Suhie Hagelston as reunion president and Samantha Stoddard as reunion treasurer. Remember it’s just us at our 25th reunion from June 13-16, 2019. No other classes in our cluster. Solo mio. Sophomore Summer all over again. We need more people to join our committee to plan an amazing reunion.” After the last Class Notes, a few classmates have stepped forward to volunteer—thank you! Please consider being part of this pre-reunion reunion.\n\nI heard from Heather Wick, and she sends an update of the blissful life in Vermont. After graduating from Albany Medical College in 1999, she began an anesthesia residency and completed a year of internship. As Heather puts it, “Working 120 hours a week was not for me, so I quit.”\n\nAfter working for a contract research organization managing global clinical trials and then for a management consulting firm in the healthcare division, she moved back to Vermont to be near her family. Heather explains that finding a career niche and paying off medical school debt can take a while. Eventually, she became a recruiter in the healthcare industry, working on a nationwide basis. She writes, “I have been doing this for six years now and own my own company. I have two employees and couldn’t be happier. We focus on executive-level positions in the long-term-care industry. Life in Vermont is great. I work from home so I have no commute. Even if I did, traffic is minimal.” Personally, I couldn’t be more impressed that Dartmouth helped provide the well-rounded, liberal arts education that served as a foundation for an impressive career that spanned medicine, business and human resources! And, no commute or 120-hour weeks? Sign me up!\n\nA little birdie told me that Adam DeWitt was recently named president of GrubHub. Interestingly, GrubHub has announced its partnership with Taco Bell and KFC to provide delivery of these favorites, joining White Castle on the list. As with Heather Wick, Adam’s liberal arts education at Dartmouth and time in Hanover served as pivotal inspiration in his career. Apparently, EBAs’ midnight deliveries made a lasting impression. Every Alpha Chi Alpha brother is thanking you, Adam!\n\nAnother birdie passed on an update on Trevor Burgess. Since graduation his career has taken him from Monitor Co. to a lengthy stint executing initial public offerings at Morgan Stanley. After serving as the president and CEO of C1 Bank, he now acts as chairman of TRB Development, a diversified company that includes residential real estate development and consulting. In addition to his knowledge of financial markets, he is apparently quite a technological guru and holds four patents. He recently made financial headlines with a new venture into flood insurance through Neptune Flood. After spending about a year traveling much of the world with his husband and daughter, I bet Trevor has even more stories to share. Trevor, we hope to see you at reunion next year!\n\nAnd, on that note, we come full circle, back to our reunion. Let me know if you will join our reunion committee, and please send updates and news about yourself (or your friends) to be featured in the next issue. Otherwise, I’ll be consulting the birdies for news!\n\n—Laura H. Davis, 1664 Cambridge Court, Bethlehem, PA, 18015; lauradavis723@mac.com\n\nHello there, fellow classmates! As you move out of the winter doldrums with the first suggestions that sun and spring are imminent, please consider setting some time aside on April 4 to reconnect with Dartmouth and your favorite classmates. April 4 is the 94th day of the year and an opportune time to pause and reflect on Dartmouth and the people who have made its memory so special. And, in that vein, I invite you to consider joining our 25th reunion planning committee. It’s hard to believe that our reunion is coming up in just over a year. From personal experience, I can assure you that being part of the committee requires a modest time commitment, literally five to 10 hours during the course of the year. Here’s another baiting point: You can plan one aspect of the reunion—such as a dinner or afternoon family activity—with a fellow ’94 classmate, dividing the time commitment and using the planning as an excuse to connect with a good friend. For one of previous reunions, Kelly Bell Lytle and I planned an EBAs dinner and late-night snack. I spent more time talking with Kelly than actually required to make the arrangements with EBAs. Please consider this opportunity as a chance to reconnect and give back. If you are interested, reach out to me or Deme Navab Taleghani, our class president.\n\nI heard from Johnny Jones, who writes, “I just want to say hello and wish everyone well! I am working in Maryland at a regional tutoring company, PrepMatters, as director of quality assurance. In 2015 I married Rachel MacKnight, BU ’99. Later that year she gave birth to our son, Zachary. Rachel is also a tutor and has contributed to the production of many of our organization’s materials.” Thank you for checking in, Johnny!\n\nAdam Lipsius released a film in 2017 called Amy & Sophia, which was met with rave reviews at the Denver Film Festival this past year. This coming-of-age, fantasy drama tells the story of scarred teens, Amy and Sophia, who meet seemingly as opposites but help each other come to terms with their own abuse and loss. The film implements a new technique using watercolor animation, and this innovation creates a “visually stunning magical break-through” in Adam’s creation. For those of you who know Adam, it’s not surprising that he is pushing the envelope with his wit, heart and vision.\n\nAs you start making plans for this upcoming summer and possibly the holiday season, why not consider a trip back to New England to stay at the Von Trapp Family Lodge? CNN recently featured classmate Sam Von Trapp and his family’s Stowe, Vermont, resort. The resort just celebrated its 50th year of operation in January, and Sam has been instrumental in the resort’s modernization. If you visit the Von Trapp Family Lodge, you’ll not only be treated to the expected picturesque snow and skiing in winter, but also the unexpected summer mountain biking trails, glorious morning fog (that Maria herself enjoyed when she lived here) and the outstanding culinary options with a bierhall and farm-to-table, refined dining.\n\nPlease send updates and news about yourself (or your friends) to be featured in the next issue."
