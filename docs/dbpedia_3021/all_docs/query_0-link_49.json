        "text": "The Roller Hockey International League (RHI) was founded in California by Dennis Murphy while driving through the streets of Los Angeles after he noticed a school yard group of young kids heavily involved in a hockey game on in-line skates. Murphy himself was no stranger to creating new leagues as he is credited for the formation of the American Basketball Association (ABA), and the World Hockey Association (WHA). Murphy, along with his Attorney Larry King co-founded the RHI in the summer of 1991. Due to the explosive growth of in-line skating, and being the \"sport of the nineties\", the RHI would expand across the country to 12 teams with three divisions and a 14-game schedule, including Minnesota. In November of 1993 Minnesota migrated to a new habitat in hockey, going from the cold climate of professional ice hockey to the warm climate of professional roller hockey, and joined the RHI league, and was part of the Central Division in the Eastern Conference. The owners of Blast Entertainment named the team: Minnesota Arctic Blast with a fun-loving polar bear as the primary logo after the Minnesota Mosquitoes, Ice and Loons were rejected by Minnesota's new roller hockey franchise. \"We really liked the idea of a polar bear so we went with that concept, plus it also helped to have an animated character as a mascot\", said Richard Valentine of Valentine Design and Marketing in Edina, MN whom created the logo. \"The Arctic Blast had a NHL-NBA level of logo that had durability, and was rather irreverant\". In 1994 RHI expanded from 12 teams to 24 that included a Minnesota franchise - the Arctic Blast and was joined by 12 other teams. RHI had to add two conferences with divisions as follows:\n\nEASTERN CONFERENCE:\n\nATLANTIC DIVISION: Buffalo Stampede, Montreal Roadrunners, New Jersey Rockin Rollers, Philadelphia Bulldogs, Tampa Bay Tritans.\n\nCENTRAL DIVISION: Atlanta Fire Ants, Chicago Cheetas, Minnesota Arctic Blast, New England Stingers, Pittsburgh Phantoms, St.Louis Vipers.\n\nWESTERN CONFERENCE:\n\nNORTHWEST DIVISION: Calgary Radz, Edmonton Sled Dogs, Phoenix Cobras, Portland Rage, Sacramento River Rats, Vancouver Voodoo.\n\nPACIFIC DIVISION: Anaheim Bullfrogs, Las Vegas Flash, Los Angeles Blades, San Diego Barracudas, San Jose Rhinos.\n\nThe Minnesota Artic Blast made their Roller Hockey International debut on June 6th 1994 in the new expanded RHI league vs. the Atlanta Fire Ants (Atlanta Fire Ants were also part of the 1994 league expansion as well) at the Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota to a lopsided 23-3 win! After the 1994 season the franchise took a year of hibernation while planning to move into a new league. That never happened so the team rejoined the RHI in 1996. In 1995 the Arctic Blast were replaced by the Minnesota Blue Ox before the Arctic Blast returned to the RHI in 1996. The Blue Ox had a lot of the Arctic Blast players on their roster with some new faces. The Blue Ox played there 1995 season home games at Aldrich Arena in Maplewood, MN which consisted of 12 home games. Fans were able to enjoy free parking, in-line skating in the arena before each home game, with \"plenty of tailgating and entertainment opportunites\". After the 1996 season the Arctic Blast would not return to the RHI and then in 1998 the RHI took a leave of absence and returned in 1999 with the Minnesota Blue Ox returning, but RHI sadly folded after the 1999 season. Because the league folded it forced the Arctic Blast to cease operations. The RHI attempted to come back in 2000 as Major League Hockey (MLH), but they couldn't get things together to start the season. At this time, there isn't anything to indicate that RHI or any other nation wide pro league will play any time in the near future. Both the Arctic Blast and the Minnesota Blue Ox played at a time in Minnesota's hockey history following the departure of the Minnesota North Stars to Dallas, and the IHL's Minnesota Moose.
