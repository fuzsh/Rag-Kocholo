        "text": "Description\n\nDeveloped in conjunction with the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, Habiturf simulates native shortgrass prairies. Yet, Habiturf provides all the visual beauty of a uniform lawn stand with the drought-tolerance and low maintenance of native Texas grasses. Heartiness is achieved through the use of multiple species, but the uniformity of the leaves and color make for a lush, beautiful lawn.\n\nHabiturf has been observed to outperform Bermudagrass in terms of establishment rates, turf thickness, mowing rates, and weed resistance. Established stands should be mowed every 3 to 5 weeks (when growing) at a height of 3 to 4 inches. This mix requires less water than traditional lawn grasses, has reasonable resistance to foot traffic, and requires little to no herbicide application or fertilization. A portion of all sales will be donated to the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center.\n\nHabiturf is a blend of buffalograss, blue grama, and curly mesquite. Each of these grasses is a native, warm season perennial that forms a turf. Mature height in the blend is less than 1â€™ when not mowed. Habiturf is the premier native lawn blend for Texas. Best performance is in full sun on well-drained soils.\n\nPlant in early spring at a rate of 5 lbs. per 1000 sq. ft. Cultivate soil to at least 8 inches, then incorporate .5 inches of living compost with low nitrogen and low phosphorus into the top 3 inches. Sow seed, rake and press. Irrigate each day for the first 10 days, then twice weekly for the next 2 months, then twice monthly.\n\nComponents: Buffalograss (62%), Blue Grama (30%), Curly Mesquite (8%)\n\nRegion: Southwestern United States\n\nFor more information\n\nHabiturf: The Ecological Lawn by the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center"
