Kushinadas are the only people with the power to destroy the Arigami monsters. One day at school an Arigami attacked the school grounds in an attempt to kill her and her guardian, Kusanagi. Momiji tried to help Kusanagi but she was wounded by the Arigami. At the same time, she received a small blue seed that attached itself to her and gave her the ability to sense Arigami. Blue Seed 2 is a 3-episode OAV series that takes place after the Blue Seed television series. Show information, episode list, cast, and airdates."
