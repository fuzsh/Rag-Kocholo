        "text": "In Super Mario Wonder, Bulrush Coming Through! is one of the many courses you can complete when you reach the mini open-world area region of the Pipe-Rock Plateau. This course is also your introduction to a brand-new enemy type, the charging Bulrush.\n\nTo begin this course, jump over the first Bulrush, defeat the Snail, and continue right to find your first Flower Coin. Though you can see the Flower Coin on the lower platform, you can’t collect it because it’s behind hard blocks you cannot break.\n\nClimb the blocks to the right of the Flower Coin, then ground-pound the first tree two times to get the treetop to cover up the pit below. Next, jump atop the following tree and bait the Bulrush into charging through the hard blocks in front of the coin.\n\nAfter securing Flower Coin 1, advance to the right and activate the Blue Tulip beside the red-colored Warp Pipe to spawn three Gold Coins above the upcoming treetop. Ground-pound the treetop where the Gold Coins are found, and you’ll be lifted to a secret area in the sky.\n\nOnce in the secret sky area, leap from Cloud Block to Cloud Block while avoiding the passing Smogrins, or take out the Smogrins with your Fireballs. When you reach the right end of the sky area, jump to collect the Flower Coin, and you’ll return to the surface.\n\nTo find the Wonder Flower, pass through the Checkpoint Flag, then walk onto the following ramp to bait the Bulrush into breaking the ? Blocks. Progress to the right, and after hurdling over a red Warp Pipe, you’ll notice some shimmering hard blocks floating in the air. Defeat the long, mushroom-like enemies, then bait the upcoming Bulrush into breaking the shimmering hard blocks to reveal this course’s Wonder Flower.\n\nWhen you collect this Wonder Flower, a stampede of Bulrush will race through the course. If you choose to remain atop the Bulrush stampede, the first Goal Pole in this course will be destroyed, but you’ll be led to the first Wonder Seed.\n\nThis secret can be found by passing the hard blocks hiding the Wonder Flower and leaping over the Bulrush. Jump into the second ? Block ahead to reveal a bubble with a number on it. Hit the bubble three times without letting it hit the ground, and you’ll be rewarded with Flower Coins, Gold Coins, and a Fire Flower Power-Up.\n\nTo collect the final Flower Coin in this course, either ignore the Wonder Flower altogether or grab the Wonder Flower and sprint ahead of the stampede. If you elect to leave the Wonder Flower behind, pass over the spike-filled area guarded by purple mushroom-like enemies, and you’ll notice a Bulrush atop a tree.\n\nRun onto the hilltop to the right of the Bulrush and bait them off the tree. The Bulrush will charge down and hit a red Warp Pipe just past the Flower Coin. Once the Bulrush has recovered from headbutting the pipe, bait them again to destroy the hard blocks, then pick up the Flower Coin.\n\nIf you choose to pick up the Wonder Flower, sprint ahead of the stampede and leap over the spiked area guarded by two purple mushroom-like enemies. Just ahead, you’ll find the Flower Coin and a nearby Bulrush. Quickly bait the Bulrush into breaking the hard blocks, grab the Flower Coin, and hop back onto the Bulrush stampede before the Wonder Flower effect expires.\n\nTo obtain the first Wonder Seed, collect the Wonder Flower by baiting the Bulrush into destroying the shimmering hard blocks to the right of the Checkpoint Flag. When the Bulrush stampede crashes through the area, leap onto them and ride the Bulrush stampede past the fallen Goal Pole. When the stampede jumps over the steep hill, land on the Cloud Blocks holding the Wonder Seed. After picking up the Wonder Seed, sprint across the Cloud Blocks to leap onto the secret exit’s Goal Pole.\n\nThis Wonder Seed can be collected by completing this course through the original Goal Pole. Though this Wonder Seed technically comes before Wonder Seed 1, it’s labeled as the second Wonder Seed on your Courses Menu. To earn this Wonder Seed, avoid collecting the Wonder Flower and progress through the course until you reach Flower Coin 3. After obtaining the Flower Coin, leap over the red Warp Pipe, bait the nearby Bulrush into charging to the right, and hop on top of them. As the Bulrush charges forward, wait for the perfect timing, then jump onto the Goal Pole to earn this Wonder Seed.\n\nThe final Wonder Seed can be earned by riding the Bulrush stampede to the secret exit. To start, grab the Wonder Flower to trigger the stampede, then ride the Bulrush until you’re dropped off on the Cloud Blocks holding Wonder Seed 1. Sprint to the right and leap onto the secret Goal Pole to earn your third Wonder Seed."
