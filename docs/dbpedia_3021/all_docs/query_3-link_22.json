        "text": "An actress who always attracts audiences' attention, Jennifer Tilly is by turns funny, sexy, compassionate, compelling and often all at once. She has been playing unforgettable characters ever since she started her career as an actress.\n\nJennifer Tilly was born Jennifer Ellen Chan in Harbor City, Los Angeles, to Harry Chan, a used car salesman, who was of Chinese origin, and Patricia (née Tilly), a schoolteacher and stage actress. Her sister is actress Meg Tilly. They were raised on rural Texada Island, British Columbia, by her mother and stepfather, John Ward.\n\nJennifer successfully cultivated another fan base with the revitalization of the \"Child's Play\" horror comedy franchise. For Ronny Yu's Chucky und seine Braut (1998), the filmmakers turned to Jennifer to create the character who would spark the series in a new direction. She met the challenge and established a new horror icon in Tiffany. In Rogue Pictures' Seed of Chucky (2004), written and directed by series creator Don Mancini, Jennifer again took the popular series to the next level; starring as Tiffany and as herself, the deadly doll's favorite actress, who soon becomes an unwitting hostess in more ways than one.\n\nJennifer's pitch-perfect voiceover work as Tiffany is not the only instance of her being able to incarnate a character from the vocal chords out. Families know her distinctive cadences from the Disney hits Die Kühe sind los! (2004), directed by Will Finn and John Sanford; Die Geistervilla (2003) (in which Jennifer acted from the neck up only), directed by Rob Minkoff; and the Pixar blockbuster Die Monster AG (2001) (voicing Mike's love interest Celia), directed by Pete Docter, David Silverman and Lee Unkrich. She began her acting career as a teenager, putting herself through the theater program at Stephens College in Missouri by winning writing competitions. She then headed to Los Angeles, California. While she continued to act on the stage (earning a Dramalogue Award for her performance in \"Vanities\"), movies and television immediately came calling for the actress with the unique voice and visage.\n\nIn 2001, she starred in the Broadway revival of \"The Women\" with Cynthia Nixon and Kristen Johnson, which was later taped for, and broadcast on, PBS. In 2008, she appeared with Miranda Richardson in the critically acclaimed production of Wallace Shawn's play \"Grasses of a Thousand Colors\" at the Royal Court Theatre in London. Other plays include \"Tartuffe\" (LAAT) \"Boy's Life\" (LAAT) \"Baby with the Bathwater\" (LAPT) and others too numerous to mention. In 2005, Jennifer met her boyfriend, professional poker player Phil Laak (also known as the Unabomber). That summer at the World Series of Poker, she bested a field of 601 to take down the Ladies Event and win a coveted gold bracelet. She followed this up by winning the WPT Ladies Invitational, making her one of a small but elite group holding both a WSOP bracelet, and a WPT title. In summer 2010, she also won the Bellagio Cup 5k tournament.\n\nGaunt character actor Brad Dourif was born Bradford Claude Dourif on March 18, 1950 in Huntington, West Virginia. He is the son of Joan Mavis Felton (Bradford) and Jean Henri Dourif, a French-born art collector who owned and operated a dye factory. His father died when Dourif was three years old, after which his mother married Bill Campbell, a champion golfer, who helped raise Brad, his brother, and his four sisters. From 1963 to 1965, Dourif attended Aiken Preparatory School in Aiken, South Carolina, where he pursued his interests in art and acting. Although he briefly considered becoming a professional artist, he finally settled on acting as a profession, inspired by his mother's participation as an actress in community theater.\n\nBeginning in school productions, he progressed to community theater, joining up with the Huntington Community Players, while attending Marshall University of Huntington. At age 19, he quit his hometown college and headed to New York City, where he worked with the Circle Repertory Company. During the early 1970s, Dourif appeared in a number of plays, off-Broadway and at Woodstock, New York, including Milos Forman who cast him in Einer flog über das Kuckucksnest (1975). Although this film is frequently cited as his film debut, in fact, Dourif made his first big-screen appearance with a bit part in Ein Supertyp haut auf die Pauke (1975). Nevertheless, his portrayal of the vulnerable Billy Bibbit in Forman's film was undoubtedly his big break, earning him a Golden Globe Award for Best Acting Debut, a British Academy Film Award for Best Supporting Actor, and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nSkeptical of his instant stardom, Dourif returned to New York, where he continued in theater and taught acting and directing classes at Columbia University until 1988 when he moved to Hollywood. Despite his attempts to avoid typecasting, his intensity destined him to play eccentric or deranged characters, starting in Die Augen der Laura Mars (1978), John Huston's Der Ketzer (1979) (arguably his best performance to date), and Milos Forman's Ragtime (1981). Dourif then teamed up with director David Lynch for Der Wüstenplanet (1984) and Blue Velvet (1986). His high-strung style also served him well in a number of horror films, notably as the voice of the evil doll Chucky in Chucky - Die Mörderpuppe (1988) and its sequels.\n\nDourif broke from the horror genre with roles in Fatal Beauty (1987), Mississippi Burning - Die Wurzel des Hasses (1988), Geheimprotokoll (1990) and London schafft alle (1991). Recent film work includes the role of Grima Wormtongue in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Since his television debut in the PBS film The Mound Builders (1976), Dourif has made sporadic appearances on a number of television series, such as Akte X: Die unheimlichen Fälle des FBI (1993), Babylon 5 (1993), Star Trek: Raumschiff Voyager (1995), Millennium: Fürchte deinen Nächsten wie dich selbst (1996) and Ponderosa (2001). He also appeared in the music video \"Stranger in Town\" (1984) by the rock band TOTO.\n\nDavid Kirschner Productions maintains an eclectic slate of projects, focusing primarily on family and genre films. Currently in production is the film adaptation of the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning short story, Martian Child, written by sci-fi luminary, David Gerrold (Star Trek's \"The Troubles with Tribbles\"). John Cusack (High Fidelity, Identity) stars in the film, which will be directed by Menno Meyjes, writer/director of 2004's acclaimed Max for Lions Gate, and Oscar-nominated screenwriter of The Color Purple, as well as the Denzel Washington-starrer, The Siege. The comedy-drama follows the neurotic travails of a science-fiction writer (Cusack) who adopts a boy claiming to be a Martian. Seth Bass & Jon Tolins (Broadway's \"Twilight of the Golds\") wrote the script.\n\nLater this summer, Kirschner and producing partner, Corey Sienega, will team up with Mike Medavoy to produce the biography of famed children's author and illustrator Beatrix Potter (The Tale Peter Rabbit). Starring Oscar-winner Renee Zelwegger (Bridget Jones, Chicago), the magical romantic-drama was written by Tony Award-winner Richard Maltby (Miss Saigon, Ain't Misbehavin') and will be directed by Chris Noonan (Babe).\n\nLast year Kirschner produced Seed Of Chucky, the fifth installment of the successful horror-franchise, which opened in theaters in November. Additionally, Kirschner served as Executive Producer on last summer's 5-hour scifi-thriller miniseries, 5 Days Til Midnight. Starring Oscar-winner Timothy Hutton (Ordinary People, Falcon And The Snowman), this television event aired June 7-10 on the Sci-Fi Channel.\n\nIn Fall 2003, New Line released the successful family film, Secondhand Lions, into theaters. The film stars Oscar winners Michael Caine and Robert Duvall, and Oscar nominee, Haley Joel Osment, and was written and directed by Tim McCanlies (Iron Giant). The film is now in development as a Broadway musical. The upcoming Martian Child is Kirschner's second production with New Line.\n\nIn 2002, Kirschner produced Lions Gate's critically acclaimed thriller Frailty. Directed by Bill Paxton, who also starred alongside Matthew McConaughey, the film was lauded by the National Board of Review that year for Excellence in Filmmaking.\n\nA native of suburban Los Angeles, Kirschner began his career as an illustrator for Jim Henson's Muppet and Sesame Street characters. At 23, he wrote and illustrated a series of children's books entitled Rose Petal Place. This property spawned a total of 16 books, two television specials and over 1100 different products.\n\nIn 1986, Kirschner created and executive produced with Steven Spielberg the smash hit An American Tail, which became one of the most successful animated films in history. This film was followed by the sequel AN American Tail 2: Fievel Goes West, a Saturday morning animated series, and direct-to-video features American Tails 3, 4, and 5. Kirschner's second feature film was the horror hit Child's Play, whose leading character, \"Chucky\", an animatronic doll which Kirschner created, became a cult star and spawned a second successful franchise with Child's Play II, child's play III, and the 1998 box-office winner, Bride Of Chucky, starring Jennifer Tilly. Seed Of Chucky, the hit horror comedy and fifth installment in the popular Child's Play franchise, opened in theaters in November.\n\nKirschner's next production, Disney's hit comedy-thriller, Hocus Pocus, was based on his short story and starred Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy.\n\nKirschner also created and produced the NBC's Emmy-nominated The Dreamer Of Oz. Starring John Ritter, the television event was based on the life of The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz creator L. Frank Baum. Kirschner also produced the Emmy Award-winning The Halloween Tree, written and narrated by Ray Bradbury. Kirschner later served as Executive Producer of Gene Roddenberry's Earth: Final Conflict. A two-time Emmy nominee over its five-year run, Earth recently sold into 2nd run syndication and now can be seen on the Sci-Fi Channel.\n\nOn the theatrical side, Kirschner executive produced the box-office smash The Flintstones, again in partnership with Spielberg. He then co-wrote and produced the Twentieth Century Fox/Turner live-action and animated fantasy The Pagemaster. This film was based upon the book co-written by Kirschner which was named the American Library Association's \"Children's Book of the Year.\"\n\nKirschner also produced the critically acclaimed animated feature Cats Don't Dance, released by Warner Brothers in the spring of 1997. Cats won both the Golden Crown at Annecy and the prestigious Annie Award (the American Animation Awards) for Best Feature, beating out Disney's Hercules and Warner Brothers' Space Jam. In Summer 2000, Twentieth Century Fox released Titan A.E., a space adventure loosely based on the Robert Louis Stevenson classic, Treasure Island.\n\nCurrently in production at Universal is an animated adaptation of the classic Curious George books, for which Kirschner is teamed up with producers Ron Howard and Brian Grazer. Will Ferrell is starring.\n\nEli Raphael Roth was born in Newton, Massachusetts, to Cora (Bialis), a painter, and Sheldon H. Roth, a psychoanalyst, psychiatrist, and clinical professor. His family is Jewish (from Austria, Hungary, Russia, and Poland). He began shooting Super 8 films at the age of eight; after watching Ridley Scott's Alien: Das unheimliche Wesen aus einer fremden Welt (1979) and vomiting, and deciding he wanted to be a producer/director. With his brothers and friends, ketchup for blood, and his father's power tools, he made over 50 short films before attending film school at NYU, where he won a student Academy Award and graduated summa cum laude in 1994.\n\nEli worked in film and theater production in New York City for many years, doing every job from production assistant to assistant editor to assistant to the director. At the age of 20, Roth was development head for producer Fred Zollo, a position he soon left to write full time. To earn a living, Roth did budgets and schedules for the films Teurer als Rubine (1998) and Illuminata (1998), and often worked as a stand-in, where he could watch directors work with the actors. In 1995, Roth co-wrote the script that would eventually become Cabin Fever (2002) with friend Randy Pearlstein, and the two spent many years unsuccessfully trying to get the film financed. Roth left New York in 1999 to live in Los Angeles, and within four months got funding for his animation series Chowdaheads (1999). Roth and friend Noah Belson (Cabin Fever (2002)'s Guitar Man) wrote and voiced the episodes, which Roth produced, directed, and designed. The episodes were due to run on WCW's #1 rated series WCW Monday Nitro (1995) but the CEO was fired a day before they were scheduled to air, and the episodes never ran. Roth used the episodes to set up a stop motion series called The Rotten Fruit (2003) which he produced, directed, and animated, as well as co-wrote and voiced with friend Belson. Between the two animated series, Roth worked closely with director David Lynch, producing content for the website davidlynch.com.\n\nIn 2001, Roth filmed Cabin Fever (2002) on a shoestring budget of $1.5 million, with private equity he and his producers raised from friends and their family. The film was the subject of a bidding war at the 2002 Toronto Film Festival, eventually won by Lion's Gate, instantly doubling their investors' money. It went on to not only be the highest-grossing film for Lion's Gate in 2003, but the most profitable horror film released that year, garnering critical acclaim from The New York Times, Rolling Stone, Empire Magazine, and such filmmakers as Peter Jackson, Quentin Tarantino, and Tobe Hooper. Roth used the film's success to launch a slew of projects, including The Box - Du bist das Experiment (2009), a horror thriller he co-wrote with Richard Kelly. In May 2003, Roth joined forces with filmmakers Boaz Yakin, Scott Spiegel, and Greenestreet Films in New York to form Raw Nerve, LLC, a horror film production company.\n\nIn 2014, Eli married Chilean model and actress Lorenza Izzo.\n\nJames Wan (born 26 February 1977) is an Australian film producer, screenwriter and film director of Malaysian Chinese descent. He is widely known for directing the horror film Saw (2004) and creating Billy the puppet. Wan has also directed Dead Silence: Ein Wort. Und du bist tot. (2007), Death Sentence - Todesurteil (2007), Insidious (2010), Conjuring - Die Heimsuchung (2013) and Fast & Furious 7 (2015).\n\nBefore his success in the mainstream film industry, he made his first feature-length film, Stygian, with Shannon Young, which won \"Best Guerrilla Film\" at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival (MUFF) in 2000.\n\nPrior to 2003, Wan and Leigh Whannell had begun writing a script based for a horror film, citing inspiration from their dreams and fears. Upon completing the script, Leigh and James had wanted to select an excerpt from their script, later to be known as Saw (2004), and film it to pitch their film to studios. With the help of Charlie Clouser, who had composed the score for the film, and a few stand-in actors, Leigh and James shot the film with relatively no budget. Leigh had decided to star in the film as well.\n\nAfter the release of the full-length Saw (2004), the film was met with overwhelming success in the box office both domestically and internationally. The film ended up grossing 55 million dollars in America, and 48 million dollars in other countries, totaling over $103 million worldwide. This was over 100 million dollars profit, over 80 times the production budget. This green-lit the sequel Saw 2 (2005), and later the rest of the Saw franchise based on the yearly success of the previous installment. Since its inception, Saw (2004) has become the highest grossing horror franchise of all time worldwide in unadjusted dollars. In the United States only, Saw (2004) is the second highest grossing horror franchise, behind only the Freitag, der 13. (1980) films by a margin of $10 million.\n\nDylan Edrington was born in Munster, Indiana. Soon thereafter, Dylan and his family moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in where he attended Northgate High School. Dylan's love for acting did not hit him at a young age. In fact, he is quite a talented athlete and growing up Dylan heavily pursued sports, especially basketball. Aside from sports, he had a favorite hobby and that was hip-hop/pop dancing as well as choreographing. He was offered numerous athletic scholarships right out of high school for basketball but turned them all down due to his newly acquired love for performing. Dylan quickly landed modeling jobs with Abercrombie & Fitch, Levi Strauss, Georgio Armani, Tommy Hilfiger and many others as well as continuing to hip-hop/pop dance as a hobby. But it wasn't until watching a friend in a local production that made him fall in love with the art of acting.\n\nHis acting career took off quickly as he was cast as Taylor Williams in the film Raspberry & Lavender: The Lavender Girl (2004) about a rich boy who falls in love with a poor girl. Then, Dylan read for the role of Nelson Elliot in Tim Sullivan's horror comedy 2001 Maniacs (2005), landing the part after only his second audition ever. The film was released on DVD on March 28th, 2006 worldwide from Lions Gate Studios. He was then cast as \"Josh Lawson\" in the still \"Untitled Thriller Project\" directed by Aaron Feldman which is in the final stages of post-production and set to be released in 2006. In addition, he was offered the lead role of \"Luke Fisher\" in the supernatural/thriller entitled Derleth (2008) (V)i n which he just wrapped filming in Florida at the end of 2005. The film is planning on a 2006 release as well. He also booked a co-star role playing the character of \"Josh Cooper\" on the CBS television show Close to Home (2005).\n\nDylan highly supports the Make A Wish Foundation that helps terminally-ill youngsters."
