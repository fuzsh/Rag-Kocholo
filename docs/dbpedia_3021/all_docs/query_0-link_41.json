        "text": "April 30, 1789\n\nGeorge Washington was inaugurated as the first President of the United States on the balcony of the First Federal Hall in New York which served as the seat of the federal government until 1790, when the capital was moved to Philadelphia. It was in this building that President Washington signed the Fifth Act of Congress, creating the Customs Service.\n\nAfter the federal government moved to Philadelphia in 1790, Federal Hall became the Customhouse for the Customs Collection District of New York.\n\nFirst Federal Hall at Wall and Nassau Streets, Lower Manhattan, New York\n\n1791\n\nCongress authorizes the President to utilize the U.S. Revenue Marine for the defense of the nation. (The U.S. Navy was not established until 1798.)\n\nSPECIAL TREASURY AGENT position is created. From 1846-1860, agents submitted reports to the Treasury Department through the Collectors of Customs in the Customs district where they were employed. After 1860, the agents reported directly to the Department of the Treasury.\n\nJ. Rosse Browne 1821-1875\n\nAn artist/writer/lecturer Ross Browne also shares the distinction of being one of the earliest SPECIAL AGENTS of the TREASURY.\n\nRoss Browne's earliest federal appointment was in 1849, when Treasury Secretary R.J. Walker assigned him to investigate financial irregularities in the offices of the Customs Collectors at ports along the west coast. He was also tasked with investigating problems with the captain and crew of the revenue cutter of Conelius W. Lawrence in Astoria, Oregon. Being advised that he should avoid the delay and expense of crossing overland to the Pacific through Panama. It took Browne 6 1/2 months to sail from New York to San Francisco via Cape Horne, including Treasury business stops in Lima, Peru and Rio de Janerio.\n\nIn August 1853, Browne was appointed as Special Agent of the Treasury by Secretary James Guthrie. For the next two years, Ross Browne's assignments, to investigate the financial operations of the Collectors' offices, took him to ports of entry throughout the U.S.\n\nSelf Portrait - J. Ross Browne\n\nJefferson Davis Milton a.k.a Jeff Milton 1861-1947\n\nJeff Milton, youngest son of a Florida governor, spent most of his long life in a succession of law enforcement jobs. Arriving in Texas at 16, he starts out as a cowhand. Claiming to be 20, he qualifies to join the Texas Rangers in 1878, and serves for four years.\n\nMilton joins the U.S. Customs Service in 1887 and is appointed a CUSTOMS MOUNTED INSPECTOR headquartered in Tucson, in the Customs Collection District of El Paso. Milton spends two years with Customs, riding the line from Nogales westward to the Colorado River. As a political appointee, Milton finds himself out of a job in 1889, when a new political party takes over the reins of federal power.\n\nAfter spending fifteen years as a \"spotter\" with the Southern Pacific railroad, and being involved in a shootout with train robbers that left him with a permanently disabled arm. Milton joins the Bureau of Immigration in 1904 as a MOUNTED CHINESE INSPECTOR charged with enforcement of the Chinese Exclusion Act.\n\nAt 62, Jeff Milton becomes the first officer appointed to the U.S. Immigration Service Border Patrol in 1924, and for the next 8 years he pursues border patrol work with unbridled enthusiasm.\n\nThe Economy Act of 1932 forces the still active Milton into retirement at age 70. The Sector Chief at El Paso writes in praise of him: You have come to be regarded \"as an institution rather than an individual. No other immigration officer has your value in cultivating for the Service the good will and friendship we must have for effective enforcement of the law.\"\n\nCirca 1888: Col. Abner Tibbetts (center) poses with 5 of the 25 Customs Mounted Inspectors assigned to the Customs Collection District of El Paso. Seated on the right is CUSTOMS MOUNTED INSPECTOR Jeff Milton.\n\n1951\n\nA flag identification project authorized by President Truman determines the eagle displayed in the union of the Customs ensign is not proper.\n\nThe union of the Customs ensign is changed to display the Great Seal of the United States, having an American Bald Eagle holding an olive branch with 13 olives in his dexter talon, and 13 arrows in his sinister talon; his beak carries a scroll inscribed with \"E Pluribus Unum\"; on his breast is a shield of 13 red and white pales with a chief of blue, and above the eagle's head a glory breaking through a cloud and surrounding 13 stars forming a constellation.\n\nThe official flag of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\n\n1987\n\nAt midnight on October 1, 1987, TECS II (TREASURY ENFORCEMENT COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM II) becomes operational at the New Orleans Airport port of entry. This system links telecommunications terminals and PCs located at user sites around the world to a central computer system and data base. This system continues to serve CBP.\n\nFull implementation of CUSTOMS AUTOMATED COMMERCIAL SYSTEM (ACS), a comprehensive commercial system able to track and process electronically imports from manifest declaration through to liquidation, regardless of entry type, locations of activity or interface employed.\n\nDedication ceremony of the first helium-filled balloon, known as an AEROSTAT, at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. This is the first of six aerostats to be deployed along the Southern Border; all are part of U.S. Customs Project SOUTHWEST RADAR BALLOON PROJECT (SOWRBALL).\n\n2007\n\nOperation Against Smugglers Initiative for Safety and Security is expanded by both the United States and Mexico as a successful cross-border prosecution and deterrent to smugglers who jeopardize the lives of aliens.\n\nCBP launched the National Agriculture Release Program (NARP), an automated program that allows the inspection of high-volume, very-low risk commodities to be expedited. NARP will allow CBP to divert valuable resources to other high risk agricultural commodities which facilitates trade and enhances customer service.\n\nCBP deployed the AUTOMATED COMMERCIAL ENVIRONMENT (ACE) electronic truck manifest (e-Manifest) system to 98 of 99 land border ports and are processing nearly 30,000 trucks a day.\n\ne-Allegations, an online trade violation reporting system, provides concerned members of the public a means to confidentially report suspected trade violations.\n\n2008\n\nGLOBAL ENTRY, a customer service and security program designed to expedite the screening and processing of pre-approved, low-risk U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents traveling from abroad to the United States, was launched.\n\nThe ELECTRONIC SYSTEM FOR TRAVEL AUTHORIZATION (ESTA) is launched. ESTA is a new online system that is part of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). ESTA requires all nationals or citizens of visa waiver countries who plan to travel to the United States for temporary business or pleasure under the VWP to receive an electronic travel authorization prior to boarding a U.S.-bound airplane or cruise ship.\n\nJanuary 28, 2011\n\nNew regulations are published in the Federal Register. A final rule amendment allows additional U.S. airports to request approval from CBP to process authorized flights between the U.S. and Cuba. Properly authorized flights to and from Cuba are now able to arrive at or depart from any U.S. airport that CBP has approved. The initial authorized list of airports includes John F. Kennedy International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, and Miami International Airport. The ruling marks another step in drawing the two nations, which have not had formal diplomatic ties since 1961, closer to a more cordial relationship.\n\nDecember 2011\n\nCBP officers arrest LAPD Most Wanted Fugitive as he arrived from Korea at LAX. The suspect, accused of murdering two males during a gang affiliated altercation, has been wanted for the past 12 years. He is accused of attempted murder for shooting two males during a gang affiliated altercation. In fiscal year 2011 CBP officers arrested 8,195 people wanted for crimes, including murder, rape, assault, and robbery. CBP officers also denied entry to more than 215,600 people attempting to enter the U.S. through an air, land or sea port of entry who were found inadmissible for immigration, customs, health, criminal or national security reasons.\n\nJune 2014\n\nRevelation of an urgent humanitarian crisis resulting from a steep increase in unaccompanied children (UAC's) arriving at the Texas border. 90,000 women and children entered the U.S. in the first six months of 2014 - mainly from El Salvator, Honduras and Guatemala. DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson declared a level-four condition of readiness within the department, which claims the situation has exceeded the capacity of CBP and ICE, and additional resources are necessary from DHS and other departments and agencies. The message from the Administration is clear: Those crossing illegally into the U.S. will not be eligible to earn a path to citizenship. Illegal immigrants will also not be eligible for citizenship under the comprehensive immigration legislation under consideration, nor would they be eligible for deferred action for childhood arrivals.\n\nAugust 7, 2015\n\nCBP launches “Know the Facts,” a new ad campaign warning potential migrants from El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico against illegal immigration. The public information campaign placed Spanish-language radio spots in Mexico, along with strategically place posters, television, and radio spots in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The purpose of the campaign is to increase awareness of U.S. immigration policies, enhanced border enforcement, and the dangers of the journey to the United States. The campaign emphasizes that current immigration policies do not provide new relief to people who cross the border illegally and that they will be a priority for removal.\n\nUSMCA\n\nThe United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement went into effect, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement, to mutually benefit North American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses. This agreement leveled the playing field for American workers with improved rules of origin, better protection of intellectual property, and benefits for small-and medium-sized businesses. OT played a key role in the implementation of the USMCA by writing and developing legal and regulatory documents, including the regulations for the agreement, establishing the USMCA Center to provide resources to internal and external stakeholders and ensuring compliance with USMCA requirements. These efforts have led to the facilitation of $1.45 trillion USMCA imports since the implementation of the agreement through December 31, 2022."
