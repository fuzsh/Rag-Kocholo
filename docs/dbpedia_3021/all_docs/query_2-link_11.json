Since creating the Koginut, breeder Michael Mazourek has continued to innovate, selecting new breeding lines from the original hybrid. This little squash consistently stood out from the pack, delivering the same signature depth of flavor and velvety texture of its predecessor. In fact, Lodi packs in even more concentrated sweetness, making this single-serving squash a new favorite. Like the Koginut, Lodi has a built-in ripeness indicator. Squash on the vine turn from green to bronze when ripe, ensuring that each squash is picked at peak flavor and nutrition.\n\nThis squash takes its name from Lodi, NY, where Robin Ostfeld first worked with the Koginut. Michael acknowledges the contributions of many graduate students who supported the project, including Maryann Fink-Brodnicki, Sara Shapleigh and Emily Rodekohr."
