        "text": "Botanical Interests® Seed Collection\n\nRenee's Garden Seeds - Limited Selection Available!\n\nBotanical Interests® Seed Collection\n\nThe new 2024 selection of Botanical Interests® Seeds have hit our racks and we’ve brought in some exciting new varieties we think you might like to grow in your tasty garden...\n\nVegetable Seeds\n\nHerb Seeds\n\nFlower Seeds\n\nSeed Essentials\n\nVegetable Seeds\n\nClancy Potato\n\nA potato grown from seed! 'Clancy' grows in a diversity of colors and has great quality; it even won the 2019 All-America Selections award! Small, ¾\"-1½\" potatoes are both round and fingerling shaped with smooth skin in a mix of shades between rose gold and red. This \"creamer\" potato has a pale yellow to white interior and creamy texture when cooked.\n\nRainbow Carrots\n\n'Rainbow' is a pleasing mix of colors from coral to yellow to white--a quite unusual variation from just one seed cultivar! Unlike colored carrot blends which produce varied sizes of roots, 'Rainbow' carrots are uniform and mature all at once, making them a great choice for pickling and canning. The colors may be mellow, but the flavor is big and sweet with all the crunchiness you expect in a homegrown carrot.\n\nRed Cherry Sweet Peppers\n\nPeter Piper would love to pick a peck of these sweet, small peppers for his pickled peppers! Delicious fresh in salads, stuffed for an appetizer, and ideal for canning and pickling. The cherry-tomato-sized peppers can be eaten green or ripened to a brilliant red for full flavor. Grows well in containers.\n\nSweet Bell Blend Sweet Peppers\n\nAll three of these delectable sweet peppers start out green and then sweeten as they transform into their ripe color, although delicious at any stage. Heirloom 'Yolo Wonder' (red color seeds) turns bright red and is resistant to tobacco mosaic virus. 'Coral Belle' (natural color seeds) turns intense orange, and 'Canary Belle' (yellow color seeds) turns a brilliant yellow. These 3½\"–4\" hefty peppers grow well in containers too.\n\nRat's Tail Radishes (Heirloom)\n\nInstead of edible roots, this interesting radish of prehistoric origin is grown for the abundant, slender seed pods that grow above ground on the leafy, 2'–5' plants. The botanical name translates as, \"radish with a tail\", and it is also called aerial radish or spicy bean. The pods are crisp and tender with a more subtle spiciness than a typical root radish. Makes an interesting addition to vegetable trays, and is delicious pickled and in curries and stir-fry dishes. Plants continue to produce even in hot weather, making them a good summer replacement for cool-weather root radishes.\n\nDetroit Dark Red Beets (Organic/Heirloom)\n\nHome-grown beets are simply the best. Tender and delicious, these 2½\"–3\" beautiful, deep crimson beets do not get woody as do smaller varieties if allowed to grow large. Perfect for pickling, roasting, and even raw in salads! The greens rival chard and spinach for tenderness and flavor, and are very nutritious. Beet seed is actually a dried fruit with 1 to 5 seeds in each fruit, so make sure to thin!\n\nGrande Rio Verde Tomatillos (Organic)\n\nTomatillos are essential to a wide variety of Mexican foods. 'Grande Rio Verde' yields ripe fruit nearly all at once on compact plants (about 24\" tall), thus lending themselves to smaller spaces or containers. A shorter harvest window is ideal for canning or freezing your favorite tomatillo-based sauces, or you can simply freeze tomatillos for use later. Tomatillos thrive in growing conditions similar to tomatoes (because they are related) but will handle a lot more heat. Grow two or more plants to ensure good pollination.\n\nPurple Tomatillos (Organic)\n\nWow! A purple tomatillo! Not only delicious but attractive, too. The purple fruits are much sweeter than the green types and rich in beneficial antioxidants. Let the fruit remain on the plant as long as possible until the husk splits for the best flavor and color. Tomatillos grow best in conditions similar to tomatoes (because they are related) but will handle a lot more heat. Grow two or more plants to ensure good pollination.\n\nAnna Spinach\n\nHoney and Cream Sweet Corn\n\nSugar Daddy Snap Pea Seeds\n\nCabbage Copenhagen Market\n\nCarrot Tonda di Parigi\n\nCollards Georgia Southern\n\nCorn Popcorn Strawberry\n\nOkra Clemson Spineless 80\n\nCarrot Shin Kuroda\n\nMustard Red Giant\n\nEggplant Long Purple\n\nSorrel Common\n\nPepper Chile Thai Hot\n\nParsnip All American\n\nBrussels Sprouts Long Island Imp\n\nBroccoli Waltham 29\n\nRutabaga American Purple Top\n\nOkra Red Burgundy\n\nMustard Florida Broadleaf\n\nMustard Spinach Tendergreen\n\nCarrot Red Cored Chantenay\n\nPepper Sweet Banana (Organic)\n\nPumpkin Sugar Pie (Organic)\n\nBeet Gourmet Blend (Organic)\n\nCucumber Homemade Pickles (Organic)\n\nKale Dwarf Blue Curled (Organic)\n\nCorn Swt (multicolor) Painted Hill (Organic)\n\nSquash Winter Veg Spaghetti (Organic)\n\nLarge Packet Sizes\n\nFarmer's Market Blend Mesclun Lettuce\n\nWhy go to the grocery store for pricey mesclun when it's so easy to grow your own? This perfect blend of six leaf lettuce varieties has a beautiful range of leaf shapes, textures, and colors with mild flavor. Begin harvesting leaves in just 3 weeks! Cut back plants and they will re-grow. Easy to grow in containers.\n\nNero Toscana Kale (Organic/Heirloom)\n\nAlso known as dinosaur kale, black Tuscan kale, black cabbage, and black palm. Vigorous dark green to black leaves of this 18th century heirloom are traditionally used in soups and stews. This type is commonly considered to be the best tasting kale. You can harvest the first shoots as tender young salad greens or achieve full-sized plants in 2 months.\n\nButtergold Sweet Corn\n\nGourmet Blend Beets\n\nHerbs\n\nMarjoram (Organic/Heirloom)\n\nAlso called sweet marjoram, its flavor is considered milder but more complex than its relative, oregano. Some describe the flavor as having a hint of balsam. A very popular ingredient in German sausage and herb breads. Fun folklore: Legend has it that if you touch marjoram before bedtime, you will dream of your future spouse. Drought tolerant and deer resistant.\n\nCat Grass\n\nChervil\n\nSavory Summer\n\nParsley Moss Curled (Organic)\n\nSage Broadleaf (Organic)\n\nFlowers\n\nRubenza Cosmos\n\nDeeply colored 3\" blooms are beauteous in contrast when paired with white flowers and silver-foliage plants. A Fleuroselect Novelty award winner, this cosmos is a real standout in the garden or a vase, and butterflies love them, too. Blooms start out red-wine colored and turn to dusky rose as they age. Growing cosmos is an easy way to add color to your garden, as they require little attention and are drought tolerant.\n\nMy Navy Sweet Pea\n\nAdd a sea of wavy petaled, violet-blue blossoms to your garden (h)arbor! The intense color of 'My Navy' makes it a stand-out among sweet peas. Large, lightly fragrant blooms on long, sturdy stems make them fantastic for full bouquets of all dark blooms, or pairings with contrasting, lighter flowers. Pollinators love them too! Deer resistant.\n\nDrumstick Flower Craspedia (Heirloom)\n\n'A florist favorite, craspedia adds intrigue to the garden with clusters of sunny orbs and is dazzling in cut or dried arrangements. The blooms may look delicate, but the plants are tough, tolerating drought, heat, and heavy, poor soil. This pollinator-attracting flower is commonly known in its native countries of New Zealand and Australia as Billy buttons.\n\nSteel Blue Sea Holly (Heirloom)\n\nSea holly brings extraordinary architectural beauty to the garden by day, and wonderment at night as it reflects the silvery moonlight. It blooms profusely through the summer, attracting pollinators and providing garden interest in winter with long-standing blooms. Cut flowers are captivating in fresh or dry arrangements. This tough plant thrives in poor soil, heat, and drought. Deer and rabbit resistant.\n\nMarigold African Phyllis Yellow\n\nCosmos Xanthos\n\nPoppy Corn Amazing Grey\n\nAster China Tower Chamois\n\nMilkweed Narrowleaf\n\nMorning Glory Pinwheel Blend (Organic)\n\nZinnia Benary's Giant Blend (Organic)\n\nBachelor Button Tall Blend (Organic)\n\nBachelor Button Tall Blend (Organic)\n\nStatice Russian\n\nBachelor Button Blue Boy\n\nBlack-Eyed Susan\n\nCanterbury Bells Blend\n\nColumbine McKana Giants Blend\n\nCosmos Sensation Blend\n\nAfrican Daisy Cape Marigold\n\nShasta Daisy Alaska\n\nFlax Blue and Breezy\n\nFoxglove Gloxiniiflora Blend\n\nMorning Glory Heavenly Blue\n\nSnapdragon Tall Maximum Blend\n\nSunflower Dwf Teddy Bear\n\nViola Johnny-Jump-Up\n\nCosmos Bright Lights Blend\n\nMina Lobata Spanish Flag\n\nLove-in-a-Mist Jekyll Blend\n\nSnapdragon Magic Carpet Blend\n\nCosmos Sea Shells Blend\n\nBluebells California\n\nViola King Henry\n\nCosmos Candystripe\n\nPoppy Corn Shirley Single Blend\n\nBachelor Button Tall Blend\n\nMarigold Signet Gem Lemon/Tangerine\n\nLove-Lies-Bleeding\n\nZinnia Persian Carpet\n\nMarigold African Crackerjack\n\nPoppy Bread Peony Double Blend\n\nCup Saucer Vine Blue Cathedral Bells\n\nLinaria Fairy Bouquet\n\nMarigold French Naughty Marietta\n\nIceplant/Livingstone Daisy Sparkle\n\nScabiosa Black Knight\n\nCelosia Pampas Plume Blend\n\nGrass Frosted Explosion\n\nCoreopsis Plains Coreopsis\n\nStrawflower Swiss Giant Blend\n\nAmmi Green Mist\n\nPoppy California Orange (Organic)\n\nLarge Packet Sizes\n\nMission Bells California Poppy\n\n'Mission Bells' with its stunning, saucer-shaped, bright rose, red, orange, white, and yellow double and semi-double, ruffled flowers is the epitome of summer in a carpet of color.
