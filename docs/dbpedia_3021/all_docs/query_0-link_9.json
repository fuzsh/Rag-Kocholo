        "text": "Megumi Hayashibara (林原 めぐみ Hayashibara Megumi?) (born March 30, 1967) is a Japanese seiyū, singer, radio personality, and lyricist from Tokyo. She is currently affiliated with Aksent. Her nicknames include: Megu-san, Megu-nee, Bara-san, Kakka, and Daijin. She is best known for her roles in Ranma ½ (as Ranma Saotome (female voice)), Neon Genesis Evangelion (as Rei Ayanami), Cowboy Bebop (as Faye Valentine), Slayers (as Lina Inverse), Detective Conan (as Ai Haibara), Pokémon (as Musashi/Jessie of Team Rocket), and Shaman King (as Anna Kyoyama). She is also a fully qualified and registered nurse.[1]\n\nBiography[]\n\nUse of Template:Ambox is broken, because Module:Message box is broken.\n\nMegumi Hayashibara was born on March 30, 1967 in Tokyo, Japan.[2] She studied at a Catholic school, and at one point was bullied in fifth grade.[3] She was an active club member and participated in the Badminton, Biology, Broadcasting, Drama, and English clubs. She played the role of Alice in an English language production of Alice in Wonderland.[4] Despite qualifying as a nurse, she has never been employed in a nursing position.[5]\n\nOn March 30, 1998, she married.[6] On January 10, 2004, she announced on her radio show that she was pregnant with her first child.[7] On June 28 of the same year, she gave birth to a daughter.\n\nVoice acting[]\n\nUse of Template:Ambox is broken, because Module:Message box is broken.\n\nOn the same day as submitting the application for nursing school, she went to a book store and found an advert offering free anime voice acting auditions at Arts Vision. Several months after submitting a demo tape, she received a confirmation of passing the first stage of the audition, and eventually decided to continue training as a nurse while doing voice acting.[8][9] After a year of voice actor training, Hayashibara was chosen to voice small roles on Maison Ikkoku.[10] Initially, she had difficulty with her lines and had to redo many lines after the main recording sessions.[11] Hayashibara later auditioned for Ranma ½ expecting to be cast as Akane Tendo, but was cast as the female half of Ranma Saotome instead.[12] In 1993 and 1995, Hayashibara was a guest at Anime America.[13] At the 1995 event, she decided to give a speech in English after believing the translation at the 1993 event did not reflect what she had said.[14] In 1995, Hayashibara provided the voice of Rei Ayanami in Neon Genesis Evangelion, a role referred to as \"innovative casting\".[15]\n\nDJ[]\n\nUse of Template:Ambox is broken, because Module:Message box is broken.\n\nWhile at nursing school, she started a temporary job as a DJ at a local ice skating rink. After becoming better known as a voice actress, she was given her own Radio show, \"Heartfull Station\".[16] After 17 shows, the broadcasting station cancelled the show and other anime related programming to concentrate on traditional music. However, 6 months later, Hayashibara started a new radio show at another broadcaster.[17]\n\nMusic career[]\n\nUse of Template:Ambox is broken, because Module:Message box is broken.\n\nRelease Date[18] Album[18] Catalog Number[18] Chart Position Notes February 28, 1990 Pulse TYDY-5127 92 Single March 5, 1991 Niji-iro no Sneaker KIDA-15 43 Single March 21, 1991 Half and half KICS-100 45[19] Album March 5, 1992 Whatever KICS-176 18[20] Album June 24, 1992 Yume wo dakishimete KIDA-42 90 Single - Magical Princess Minky Momo Theme August 5, 1992 Haruneko fushigi tsukiyo -oshiete Happiness- KIDA-45 49 Single - All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku Ending August 5, 1992 Perfume KICS-215 13[21] Album March 24, 1993 Our Goody Day...Bokura no Good Day KIDA-54 54 Single August 23, 1993 SHAMROCK KICS-345 12[22] Album November 26, 1993 Yume Hurry Up KIDA-69 58 Single - All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku OVA Themes May 25, 1994 Until Strawberry Sherbet KIDA-81 42 Single - contains themes for Bakuretsu Hunter November 3, 1994 Touch and Go!!

The comics, known as \"Megumi Toons\", talked about her personal life and career. The individual chapters were collected into the book Ashita ga aru sa (明日があるさ?, \"There is always Tomorrow\"), which has been reprinted several times.[35] Hayashibara has also contributed two columns to Newtype magazine; Aitakute Aitakue, and Speaking in Character. Aitakute Aitakute is a series of interviews conducted by Hayashibara with people from all walks of life. Three compilations of the column have been published.
