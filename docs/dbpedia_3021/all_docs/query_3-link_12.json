        "text": "AMANDA-WINN LEE & JASON LEE\n\nStars Of Blue Seed\n\nAmanda Winn and Jason Lee were some of the premiere voice actors for ADV Films(originally called A.D. Vision). They eventually fell in love and got married. They have left ADV to do voice-overs for video games. Amanda played the lead role in DEVIL HUNTER YOHKO, and the widely popular Rei in EVANGELION. Jason was also in EVANGELION, as well as the UK dub of STEET FIGHTER II V. The two of them have played couples together in BURN UP W and the hit series BLUE SEED.\n\nAMANDA'S CREDITS\n\nEvangelion, Dragon Half, Wizards & Warriors, Devil Hunter Yohko, Blue Seed, Ellcia, Tail Concerto, Burn Up, Burn Up W, Thousand Arms, Gunsmith Cats, Master Of Mosquiton, Goldenboy, Super Atragon, Fire Emblem, Sukeban Deka, Gamera\n\nJASON'S CREDITS\n\nBlue Seed, Evangelion, Wizards & Warriors, Burn Up, Burn Up W, Suikoden, Ellcia, Super Atragon, Devil Hunter Yohko, Fire Emblem, Gunsmith Cats, Sukeban Deka, Bubblegum Crisis 2040, Street Fighter II V, Spriggan, Sorcerer Hunters, Heavy Gear 2, Wonders 3, Gamera\n\nBEING A COUPLE IN THE FIELD OF VOICE ACTING MUST BE INTERESTING. DO YOU EVER GET THE CHANCE TO WORK ON A SCENE TOGETHER?\n\n(Amanda:) Usually when we go into the studio it's one at a time, but we did do one scene in BLUE SEED once.\n\n(Jason:) We don't get cast as two people who are in love with each other in BLUE SEED as much. We've been doing things like a video game called WIZARDS & WARRIORS. We played Boogers.\n\n(Amanda:)Boogers!\n\n(Jason:)Yeah. She played a female troll and I played a male troll and we're called the Boogers. Often, we're put in the booths seperately so we don't really record at the same time. Although, there's this puppet movies we're doing we might be cast aside from each other.\n\n(Amanda:) Actually, the way we met was we were playing boyfriend and girlfriend in play. It's so cheesy that it would happen and we fought it every step of the way. But we gave in.\n\n(Jason:) The play we met was off-Broadway called 'Sincerity Forever'.\n\nHAVE THERE BEEN ANY DEFINATE PLANS TO HAVE YOU BOTH IN THE EVA MOVIES DUB?\n\n(Amanda:) Well, I've been talking to the people at Manga. We were supposed to be recording last May. But if all goes well, they'll be releasing the EVANGELION movie in 2001.\n\nDID YOUR PERFORMANCES IN BLUE SEED REFLECT ON YOUR REAL LIFE RELATIONSHIP?\n\n(Jason:)Well, when we did BLUE SEED we were already a couple. But before that, it was somewhat similar. We had that boy/girl thing were we teased each other.\n\n(Amanda:) He made me eat asbestos!\n\n(Jason:) Yeah. It was stereotypical the way we did the 'I don't like you, but I LIKE you' thing.\n\nWHAT VIDEO GAMES ARE YOU NOW BOTH DOING VOICE-OVERS FOR?\n\n(Jason:) Well, we just did WIZARDS & WARRIORS which is PC game from Activision. I maybe in a Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots remake. I play one of the old robots who are now retired like old sports figures and they do commentaries of robot battles.\n\n(Amanda:) Usually when we go and do a thing for Playstation while we're doing something else.\n\nARE EITHER OF YOU GOING TO BE IN BLUE SEED 2 OR BURN UP X?\n\n(Jason:)That's up to ADV.\n\n(Amanda:)We'd like to be!\n\nWHAT WOULD YOU SAY WAS ONE OF THE BEST EXPERIENCES YOU'VE EACH PERSONALLY HAD AS AN ANIME VOICE-ACTOR?\n\n(Amanda:)The best was when I took my bunny into the vets and this woman recognized be and said how much she like BLUE SEED. That's was cool getting recognized.\n\n(Jason:) I suppose do that cause they're fans of the shows and all. But we never thought there would be recognition for it.\n\n(Amanda:) The thing is, I love meeting other people in the industry, even from 'rival companies'. I'm so excited to see Lisa Ortiz here. I love hanging out with these people who do the same things. It's a blast!\n\nDO YOU FEEL ANY KIND OF CONNECTION TO ANY OF YOUR CHARACTERS IN PARTICULAR?\n\n(Amanda:) I'd say that all of them are aspects of myself. Momiji was me as a 7th grader. Rally Vincent makes me wanna fire guns. Rio is me having a blast running around acting silly. Rei is the said part of me. Even Yohko is my love for kicking butt. All of my characters are part of myself.\n\n(Jason:) I do the same thing. The character whose closest to me is Kusanagi cause he's a smart alec.\n\nIS THERE ANY ANIME THAT NEITHER OF YOU HAVE DONE THAT YOU'D LIKE TO BE INVOLVED IN?\n\n(Amanda:) Well, there's a few projects that I talked to Scott Frasier about that are just amazing that I'd love and we'll see what happens with that. I would love to do CRAYON SHIN CHAN. He's the most obnoxious little kid. I'd love to do him."
