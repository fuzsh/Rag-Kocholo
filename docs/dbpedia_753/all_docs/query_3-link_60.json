Students were often sent to schools by the Indian Agency that had jurisdiction over their tribe. Records about schools and the students who attended them may be found with the originating agency as well as in the materials created by the school. This listing contains information about schools operated by the BIA. Churches, local communities and even the tribes themselves also operated schools, which are not listed here. Please contact the corresponding National Archives facility for more information about the records related to your research."
