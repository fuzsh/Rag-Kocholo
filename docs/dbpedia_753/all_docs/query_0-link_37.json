Its roots arguably date to the origin of Chinese higher education. Hao Ping traces the intricate evolution of the university, beginning with the preceding institutions that contributed to its establishment, and stretching from the first Opium War of 1839 through the first of several eye-opening defeats for the then-isolated Middle Kingdom to the Xinhai Revolution and the early days of the Republic of China. Hao Ping chronicles the contentious debates between reform-minded leaders who championed Western models of learning and conservatives who favored the traditional schooling and examination system, providing readers with details about the workings of the imperial court as well as the individual officials and scholars involved in Chinese educational reform. This authoritative history of the founding of Peking University defends the university’s claim to be the first modern university in China and offers insight into the formation of higher education as it exists in China today.]\n\nHartnett, Richard.

Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2022.\n\n[Abstract: Today American institutions dominate nearly every major ranking of global universities. Yet in historical terms, America’s preeminence is relatively new, and there is no reason to assume that U.S. schools will continue to lead the world a century from now. Indeed, America’s supremacy in higher education is under great stress, particularly at its public universities. At the same time Chinese universities are on the ascent. Thirty years ago, Chinese institutions were reopening after the catastrophe of the Cultural Revolution; today they are some of the most innovative educational centers in the world. Will China threaten American primacy? Empires of Ideas looks to the past two hundred years for answers, chronicling two revolutions in higher education: the birth of the research university and its integration with the liberal education model. William C. Kirby examines the successes of leading universities—The University of Berlin and the Free University of Berlin in Germany; Harvard, Duke, and the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States—to determine how they rose to prominence and what threats they currently face. Kirby draws illuminating comparisons to the trajectories of three Chinese contenders: Tsinghua University, Nanjing University, and the University of Hong Kong, which aim to be world-class institutions that can compete with the best the United States and Europe have to offer. But Chinese institutions also face obstacles. Kirby analyzes the challenges that Chinese academic leaders must confront: reinvesting in undergraduate teaching, developing new models of funding, and navigating a political system that may undermine a true commitment to free inquiry and academic excellence.]\n\nLee, Wong Yin. “Women’s Education in Traditional and Modern China.” Women’s History Review 4, 3 (1995): 345-367.

Citing the practices of four selected Chinese societies, Yang opposes the existence of an impassable chasm between Chinese and Western ideas of a university and argues that it is possible to combine Chinese and Western ideas of a university. Also, this book is one of the first in English to theorize the Chinese idea of a university. It links the historical events to the present, in a context of an enormous impact of Western academic models and institutions, from the beginning of modern universities in Chinese societies to the contemporary period.]\n\nLate Qing/Republican\n\nAbe, Hiroshi. “Borrowing from Japan: China’s First Modern Educational System.” In Ruth Hayhoe and Marianne Bastid, eds., China’s Education and the Industrialized World.

Over subsequent decades, however, they came to argue fiercely over the contents of citizenship and how it should be taught. Moreover, many of their carefully crafted policies and programs came to be transformed by textbook authors, teachers, administrators, and students. Furthermore, the idea of citizenship, once introduced, raised many troubling questions. Who belonged to the national community in China, and how was the nation constituted? What were the best modes of political action? How should modern people take responsibility for “public matters”? What morality was proper for the modern public? This book reconstructs civic education and citizenship training in secondary schools in the lower Yangzi region during the Republican era. It also analyzes how students used the tools of civic education introduced in their schools to make themselves into young citizens and explores the complex social and political effects of educated youths’ civic action.]\n\n—–. “‘Teaching Baihua: Textbook Publishing and the Production of Vernacular Language and a New Literary Canon in Early Twentieth-Century China.” Twentieth-Century China 34, 1 (Nov. 2008).\n\nCurran, Thomas D.

Albany: SUNY Press, 2009.\n\n[Abstract: Looks at China’s Ginling College, the women’s missionary institution of higher learning that developed a discourse of family, recasting the Chinese Confucian family ideal as a female and Christian one. The institutional history of Ginling College is arguably a family history. Ginling, a Christian, women’s college in Nanjing founded by Western missionaries, saw itself as a family. The school’s leaders built on the Confucian ideal to envision a feminized, Christian family—one that would spread Christianity and uplift the family that was the Chinese nation. Exploring the various incarnations of the trope of the “Ginling family,” Jin Feng takes a microscopic view by emphasizing personal, subjective perspectives from the written and oral records of the Chinese and American women who created and sustained the school. Even when using more seemingly ordinary official documents, Feng seeks to shed light on the motives and dynamic interactions that created them and the impact they had on individual lives. Using this perspective, Feng questions the standard characterization of missionary higher education as simply Western cultural imperialism to show a process of influence and cultural exchange.]\n\nHao, Ping.

Lanza returns to the May Fourth period (1917-1923) and the rise of student activism in and around Beijing University. He revisits reform in pedagogical and learning routines, changes in daily campus life, the fluid relationship between the city and its residents, and the actions of allegedly cultural student organizations. Through a careful analysis of everyday life and urban space, Lanza radically reconceptualizes the emergence of political subjectivities (categories such as “worker,” “activist,” and “student”) and how they anchor and inform political action. His research underscores how, during a time of crisis, the lived realities of university and student became unsettled in Beijing, and how political militancy in China arose only when the boundaries of identification were challenged.]\n\nLewis, Ida Belle.

Due to the Americanization of China’s higher education before the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, the students were well-prepared for studying in the United States. But the unexpected founding of Communist China and the development of the Cold War prevented some from returning. When they did return, some suffered during the political campaigns in China, and a few became members of a CCP-controlled elite. “. . . a fine effort supported well by a wide variety of sources. . . . the United States and China have had for generations a deep and personal connection with each other. Countless thousands of students from each country have studied in the other and this continues through today. There is a record there that needs to be understood and Ting Ni’s work helps us to understand that record. . . . a particularly important contribution to the history of Sino-American activities and a contribution that will be sorely needed as we move into the coming decades when not only contemporary Sino-American relations but the history of Sino-American relations will become important tools for those attempting to guide our two nations toward a cooperative and successful future.” – Steven Leibo]\n\nParagon, Donald. “Ying Nian-chi (1866–1926) and the Rise of Fu Jen, the Catholic University of Peking.” Monumenta Serica 20 (1961): 166–225.\n\nPerry, Elizabeth J. “Red Literati: Communist Educators at Anyuan, 1921-25.” Twentieth-Century China 32, 2 (April 2007).\n\nRawski, Evelyn.

It looks at how the prolonged disruption has impacted the design of future hybrid arrangements for university teaching. Presented in four parts, the book unpacks Tsinghua’s thoughtful yet swift strides into the new era of ‘global hybrid higher education.’ The book examines influential technology, education, policy, and global forces. It studies transformative leadership which guided change and construction of extensive and enabling technological infrastructure. Insights from evaluations of student and faculty experiences, interactions, and activities are accompanied by projections about emerging designs of global hybrid higher education. The research describes future steps for Tsinghua and global universities. Articulating Tsinghua’s standing in China and the world, and its contribution to technology and education, this unique research will be of profound interest to students and academics in higher education and education policy and practice, as well as policy experts and higher education leaders around the world.]\n\nFraser, Stewart.

Scholars tend to attribute women’s outperformance to the one-child policy, which empowered urban singleton daughters. But around 40 percent of women undergraduate students are from rural areas, where multi-child families and son preference are common. Based on participant observation, ethnographic interviews, and longitudinal family case studies, this article addresses educated migrant women from a broad range of backgrounds in Fujian province. It argues that academically outperforming daughters combine self-development, filiality, and resistance to patriarchal norms to pursue the full subjecthood that is conventionally reserved for men—encompassing recognition for individual accomplishment, independence, and filial contribution. By navigating marriage pressures and economically contributing to their natal families, diligent daughters shift patricentric family dynamics toward more bilateral arrangements, eroding the patriarchal structures that undergird male-centered power even as many gendered norms remain intact.]\n\nHu, C.T.

Along with nearby Shaolin Temple, the academy has become a site for cultural heritage tourism in northwestern Henan. In addition to its attraction as a tourist destination, however, Songyang Academy has also been appropriated by neighboring Zhengzhou University as an auxiliary Confucian campus. Focusing on its relationship with Zhengzhou University, this article considers Songyang Academy’s restoration in the context of current debates in China about modern university education, Confucianism, and “national studies” (guoxue 国学). The Zhengzhou University–Songyang Academy partnership provides a concrete, if ambivalent, example of cultural governance in action, as provincial Communist Party officials and university administrators collaborate to produce a national studies curriculum rooted in their vision of Confucian pedagogy.]\n\nWang, Xiufang.

Their program of cultural education encountered both support and opposition in the communist containment agenda of American non-governmental organizations and in the educational policies of the British colonial government. By examining the cooperation and struggle between these three parties, this study sheds light on postwar Hong Kong, a divided China, British imperial ambitions in Asia, and the intersecting global dynamics of modernization, cultural identity, and the Cold War.]\n\nCunich, Peter. A History of The University of Hong Kong: Volume 1, 1911-1945. HK: Hong Kong University Press, 2013.\n\n[Abstract: The University of Hong Kong was one of only a handful of fully autonomous colonial universities in the British Empire in the first half of the twentieth century. From its founding in 1911, the institution was intended as a “British lighthouse in the Orient,” with a broad remit to educate a new generation of Chinese youth who would lead the to the modernization of China. This book evaluates the success of that mission while also demonstrating the importance of the university to the development of Hong Kong and Malaya, the two areas supplying the most students to the university. As the first university established in Hong Kong, the early decades of its history represent the foundations of China’s higher education system. This study provides fresh insight into the character of colonial education and the development of Hong Kong and tracks the fortunes of the colony from the peak of imperial British power to the catastrophic Japanese occupation of 1941 to 1945.\n\nFung, Pui Wing.

Regardless of their common history and cultural backgrounds, in recent decades, these localities have experienced divergent political, cultural, and educational structures. Through an analysis of the literature, official curriculum documents, approved music textbooks, and a survey questionnaire and in-depth interviews with music teachers, this book also examines the ways in which policies for national identity formation and globalization interact to complement and contradict each other in the context of music education in respect to national and cultural values in the three territories.]\n\nLee, Francis Wing-lin.

It looks at the growth, structure and current status of higher education in China and discusses how these world-class institutions are intimately intertwined with the rise of China in the global knowledge economy. It studies themes such as the impact of Chinese universities on industry, business enterprises and national development, relevance of higher education to policies related to industry development, reform measures to improve research intensity and quality of teaching, and internationalization and globalization of higher education. Based on sound empirical research, it also explores concepts like academic entrepreneurship, start-ups and entrepreneurial ecosystems.]\n\nYoung, Yi Rong. “Taiwan.” In Paul Morris and Anthony Sweeting, eds., Education and Development in East Asia.

Introduced by the Japanese colonial government at the turn of the century, baseball was expected to “civilize” and modernize Taiwan’s Han Chinese and Austronesian Aborigine populations. After World War II, the game was tolerated as a remnant of Japanese culture and then strategically employed by the ruling Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) Even as it was also enthroned by Taiwanese politicians, cultural producers, and citizens as their national game. In considering baseball’s cultural and historical implications, Morris deftly addresses a number of societal themes crucial to understanding modern Taiwan, the question of Chinese “reunification,” and East Asia as a whole.]\n\nN.a.
