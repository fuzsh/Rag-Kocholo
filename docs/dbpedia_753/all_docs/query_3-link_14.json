        "text": "UC Berkeley sits on the territory of xučyun (Huichin), the ancestral and unceded land of the Chochenyo speaking Ohlone people, the successors of the sovereign Verona Band of Alameda County. This land was and continues to be of great importance to the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe and other familial descendants of the Verona Band.\n\nWe recognize that every member of the Berkeley community has, and continues to benefit from, the use and occupation of this land, since the institution’s founding in 1868. Consistent with our values of community, inclusion and diversity, we have a responsibility to acknowledge and make visible the university’s relationship to Native peoples.\n\nAs members of the Berkeley community, it is vitally important that we not only recognize the history of the land on which we stand, but also, we recognize that the Muwekma Ohlone people are alive and flourishing members of the Berkeley and broader Bay Area communities today.\n\n1900: The Department of Education established as a unit of the Graduate Division.\n\n1903: UC students begin practice teaching in Berkeley public schools.\n\n1905: Masashi Yoshimi becomes the first Asian American to earn an advanced degree from UC Berkeley’s Department of Education, writing a master’s thesis on secondary school organization in Korea.\n\n1913: On recommendation of the Academic Senate, the Regents establish the School of Education.
