        "text": "School files very strongly reflect the growth or decline of towns and are an excellent source for your local history research.\n\nThe school files in the State Archives Collection cover both World War I and World War II but particularly reflect the many impacts of World War I. Teachers enlisted and on return took up teaching again; they applied for rent allowances and reimbursement of travelling expenses; and repaired school residences. Women resign or have their employment terminated when they marry as married women were barred from public sector employment. 20th century increases in population saw local members making representations for more buildings or new schools in the area. The files are an excellent source of information, not only for the history of a school but the history of a local community.\n\nDigitised school files\n\nThe series of school files in our Collection [NRS-3829] cover two runs: 1876 to 1939 and 1940 to 1979. They contain all sorts of correspondence that was sent to the Department of Education about a particular public school. For example, there might be applications to have a new school in a town (sometimes with details of possible pupils); teachers' leave and transfer requests; letters from parents about teachers; inspectors' reports; plans of buildings and more. The files below were digitised as part of the Archives in Your Town program.\n\nBroken Hill\n\nThe School files show the commencement and growth of the government school system from the first Broken Hill school in 1886 - Broken Hill Public School. Additional public schools opened in 1889 (Alma), 1890 (Broken Hill North) and 1895 (Burke Ward). Increases in population saw Broken Hill Public School and Broken Hill North Public School offer secondary schooling until Broken Hill High was established in 1920.\n\nPetitions for new schools were generally successful though two petitions were needed before Burke Ward was established and it started in a rented Wesleyan hall.\n\nCorrespondence shows that additional school buildings and repairs to existing buildings are needed regularly. The Broken Hill climate and its impact on schooling is also raised regularly.\n\nExtracts from the School files\n\nKiama\n\nBoth Kiama and Minnamurra schools started up before these files begin in 1876. Kiama Public School offered post-primary schooling between 1890 and 1916 and then secondary schooling from 1944 until Kiama High School was established in 1954. Repairs to school buildings and the teachers’ residences are constantly needed. The original site of Kiama Public School proved too small, particularly after land was resumed for railway purposes.\n\nSchools held school concerts; are used as polling booths and as substitute halls to welcome home World War 1 soldiers and farewell departing residents among other school and town activities. Teachers struggle to find accommodation where there is no residence; they repeatedly request repairs and additions to the school residence; take leave for family emergencies and to march in Sydney on Anzac Day in 1938; propose altered school times to accommodate children helping with the milking; request permission to hold swimming classes and manage the school without water during dry periods.\n\nParents and Citizens groups and local councils make representations in support of the schools in numerous matters – improved playground areas, for the school to be painted (and volunteered to do so), for permission to hold a Sports Fair to raise money and for improved access to secondary education.\n\nExtracts from the School files\n\nTamworth\n\nThe first school in 1855 later became Tamworth Public School. A second public school opened in 1883 in Tamworth West and both of these schools offered secondary schooling until Tamworth High School was established in 1919. Two more public schools started in the 20th century - Oxley Vale Public School in 1947 and Tamworth South Public School in 1952. The second high school – Oxley - opened in 1968.\n\nBuildings needed repairs from as early as 1880 when the average attendance was 108.9 primary children and 75.4 infants children. The water ran out in 1881 during a dry spell and letters to the Department and a newspaper article led to both temporary and longer term plans for an adequate water supply. Schools closed for a recruitment march and “sham battle” in 1918; participated in Arbor Day activities and held fund raising concerts in the Theatre Royal among other school and town activities.\n\n1919 saw troops from World War I returning and teachers applying for leave to meet relatives in Sydney (approved without pay). Teachers requested transfers to other towns to be close to their families; to run dancing schools; for the replacement of items in the teacher's residence such as the stove and bath; to close the school due to measles including among the teachers.\n\nExtracts from the School files\n\nTweed Heads\n\nThe School files start from the commencement of the first Tweed Heads school in 1876 – Point Danger which later became Tweed Heads Public School. Additional public schools opened including Duranbah in 1892, Fingal Head in 1895 and Tweed Heads South in 1958. Tweed Heads Public School offered secondary schooling until Tweed River High School was established in 1961.\n\nPoint Danger started as a provisional school to provide an education for the Pilot and other government employees families. Provisional schools were schools which were established in areas where at least 15 children but fewer than 25 could be expected to attend. Parents had to provide the building and furniture, whilst the Council or the Department of Education paid the teacher and supplied books and equipment.\n\nThe files show teachers struggle to find accommodation so sleep in tents and school rooms and write to the Premier in a bid to get a residence, discover part of the school grounds will have railway tracks and a railway station constructed on them, answer searching questions in applications for employment, teach 140 children in rooms designed for 80, teach on verandahs and in converted weather sheds and rented local halls, take leave for diphtheria, apply to have electric light in the school residence, and obtain permission to close the school for the local show, measles and the funeral of a local resident. Parents and Citizens groups make representations in support of the schools in numerous matters – more teachers, safer school sites, fencing school grounds and placing a memorial plaque for a headmaster that died.\n\nExtracts from the School files"
