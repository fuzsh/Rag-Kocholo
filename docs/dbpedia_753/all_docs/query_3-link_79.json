        "text": "Featured Questions\n\nquestion\n\nWhat does “Gig ‘em” mean?\n\nanswer\n\nToday, the phrase and thumbs-up gesture are a universal sign of approval for Aggies and Aggie fans. Gig ’em signals optimism, determination and loyalty.\n\nquestion\n\nIs Texas A&M a military school?\n\nanswer\n\nNot anymore. Texas A&M was established in 1876 as a military institution, but military service became voluntary in 1965.\n\nAbout Texas A&M\n\nOriginally, \"A&M\" stood for Agricultural and Mechanical, but today the letters no longer officially stand for anything. When Texas A&M opened on Oct. 4, 1876, as the state's first public institution of higher education, it was called the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, or \"A&M\" for short. When the institution gained university status in 1963, the \"A&M\" representation was incorporated into the official name in honor of the institution's history.\n\nReveille X, a full-blooded collie, is our mascot. As the highest-ranking member of the Corps of Cadets, Reveille is part of a rich tradition. \"Miss Rev,\" as cadets address her, is popular and can be seen around campus, in class or attending events.\n\nTexas A&M's official colors are maroon and white. The colors are such a prominent part of Texas A&M that they are referred to in \"The Spirit of Aggieland,\" our alma mater, written in 1925. For official color values, take a look at our brand guide.\n\nTexas A&M's flagship campus is located in College Station, Texas. Home to a community of about 212,000 residents, the twin cities of Bryan and College Station are centrally located — only a short drive from Austin, Dallas and Houston. Texas A&M also has two branch campuses in Galveston, Texas, and Doha, Qatar. We also have a law school in Fort Worth, Texas, the Higher Education Center at McAllen, Texas, and Texas A&M Health locations across the state.\n\nTexas A&M was established in 1876 as a military institution, and the Corps of Cadets has played an important part in our history and development. While membership is now voluntary, the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets form the largest uniformed body of students outside of U.S. military academies.\n\nOur Terminology\n\nAn Aggie is a student at Texas A&M. In the early 1900s, our students were called \"Farmers.\" The term Aggie — reflecting our agricultural roots — was first used in the 1920s, and in 1949, the yearbook changed its name from The Longhorn to Aggieland. At that point, Aggie became the official student body nickname.\n\nThe 12th Man is the entire student body — past and present. The term began in 1922. Aggie student E. King Gill was in the stands as our football team faced top-ranked Centre College. With nearly all players injured, Coach Dana X. Bible called Gill down to the sideline. Gill suited up and stood ready to play throughout the game, forever becoming “the 12th Man.” Inspired by Gill's selfless gesture, the tradition embodies our core values. Students still show the 12th Man spirit at each athletic event. And during football games, they stand for the entire event, ready to go into the game if needed.\n\nHow to Apply\n\nThe application process is determined by your application type, including freshman, transfer, graduate and international.
