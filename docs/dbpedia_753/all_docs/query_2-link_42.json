        "text": "Perched atop a gentle slope along Bukit Timah Road, Hwa Chong Institution (HCI) – as well as its previous incarnations, The Chinese High School and Hwa Chong Junior College – has been an active participant in 100 years of modern Singapore’s development.\n\nIt began as a modest school along Niven Road in 1919, with just 13 teachers and 93 students. Since then, HCI’s alumni has included influential figures such as former President Ong Teng Cheong, pioneer labour minister Jek Yeun Thong, Singapore Symphony Orchestra founder Choo Hoey, and renowned playwright/arts activist Kuo Pao Kun, as well as successful entrepreneurs such as Qian Hu’s Kenny Yap.\n\nAt times, it was also a key, albeit controversial, player amid the Republic’s historical milestones. In the 1950s, its deep roots in Chinese ethos clashed with the British colonial government, who were suspicious of the students’ alleged pro-communist leanings. Such tensions boiled over into the Chinese middle-school riots of 1956, in which The Chinese High School was the hub of student protests and sit-ins before the subsequent unrest.\n\nModern readings of that period have since recast the riots as a vital signpost of Singapore’s battle for independence. The Chinese High School – and subsequently HCI – has also shed much of its confrontational image and is now widely regarded as one of Singapore’s premier educational institutions.\n\nNever resting on its laurels\n\nHCI is currently celebrating its centennial with a year’s worth of events – from launching a heritage trail within its huge school compound, to organising a massive 10,000-guest dinner graced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. It is also hosting round-the-year conferences analysing the future of education, and opening an art gallery in December to showcase its sizeable archive of artworks.\n\nIts current principal Pang Choon How told Yahoo News Singapore in an extensive interview on 18 March that the school is deeply committed to the vision of its founder, philanthropist Tan Kah Kee – that the acquisition of knowledge is a powerful, transformative tool in the lives of individuals.\n\n“As a school, our guiding principle follows that of our school motto, 自强不息, which means a tenacity to improve, to strive to be best, to never rest on laurels,” said Pang, 43.\n\n“We are fully committed to nurturing students to be global citizens, to be future-ready, and to lead a life with a strong sense of purpose and passion. And so we have to constantly be on the forefront of education innovation.”\n\nDeep Chinese ethos vs British colonial government\n\nHCI has been inextricably linked with the Chinese community, both in Singapore and in China. The moral values it strives to inculcate among its students are thus rooted firmly in Chinese tradition, as evident by its school motto, its school philosophy (己立立人、己达达人 – to uplift communities and serve others) and its school values (饮水思源 – remembering one’s roots and honouring one’s benefactors).\n\nAt times, though, its deep Chinese ethos have seen it in conflict with authorities.\n\nThe Chinese High School, together with Chung Cheng High School, were the key locations during the 1956 Chinese middle-school riots, as students held sit-ins and protests over the dissolutions of what were deemed pro-communist organisations by the Legislative Assembly government, led by chief minister Lim Yew Hock.\n\nThe protests escalated into riots as police entered the schools’ compounds and used tear gas on the students, who took to the streets and resorted to violence that eventually led to 13 deaths, hundreds injured and more than 900 arrests.\n\nIn the decades since, the students have come to be seen less as pro-leftist dissidents, and more as pro-independence activists, noted Pang.\n\n“With the benefit of hindsight, we can view history in a different light. The riots were regrettably very disruptive, yet they played a very influential role in shaping the course of history,” he added.\n\n“Many of Singapore’s current policies in shaping a multi-cultural, multi-racial society were derived from lessons learnt from the anti-colonial struggles. The student movements were also part of a broader global narrative of pro-independence movements to overthrow the colonial masters then, and the riots continue to provide lessons and insights for current and future generations in understanding the geo-political circumstances of the nation.”\n\nBridging language divide to develop multiple perspectives\n\nPost independence, The Chinese High School sought to bridge the language divide. It was one of the first Chinese-medium schools to adopt English as the language of instruction for maths and science. It also offered conversational Malay as a subject and opening its integrated boarding programme to schools beyond HCI.\n\nDespite continual efforts to admit students of all races, HCI remains an institution made up largely of students with Chinese ethnicity. This has invited the inevitable stereotypes – that Hwa Chong students are bookish, inflexible, China-centric and unable to mingle with peers of other races.\n\nPang begs to differ, arguing that HCI’s bilingual education, coupled with the Chinese philosophy of embracing and assimilating the cultures of others, has shaped its students’ disposition to embrace diversity, to respect and appreciate cultures, and to develop multiple perspectives.\n\nNevertheless, during the 100th anniversary dinner on 21 March, PM Lee urged HCI students to connect with fellow Singaporeans of all races and religions, and understand the context of Singapore society.\n\nHe said in his speech, “Hwa Chong students must understand the context of our society, and their own responsibilities within it. You must know how the society works, identify with fellow Singaporeans of all races and religions, and feel a responsibility for your fellow citizens.\n\n“You need to feel a calling to participate in community and national affairs, to contribute to the society and system that has nurtured you, and to take on leadership roles to take Singapore forward. If you can continue to do this – uphold high academic achievements, promote Chinese cultural values, and prepare students for our multi-racial, multi-religious society – you will have fulfilled your mission.”\n\nMany ‘firsts’ amid Singapore’s development in education\n\nThe list of “firsts” by HCI is a long one. It was the first government-aided junior college in 1974 and the first secondary school to go single-session in 1978; it was among the first institutions to offer the humanities, Chinese language and art elective programmes; and it was among the pioneer batches of schools which provided the Special Assistance Plan scheme for bilingual education (in 1979), turned independent (in 1988) and offered the Integrated Programme (in 2005).\n\nStill, these constant efforts to be at the forefront of educational innovation would count for little had its students not learn lifelong values from school life.\n\nHo Teck Hua, senior deputy president and provost of National University of Singapore, contributed an article in HCI’s centennial commemorative book on the lessons he gleaned from studying at The Chinese High School and Hwa Chong Junior College from 1974 to 1979. He wrote about “the values that the school instilled in us as students – to be persistent in our efforts, respecting others, and showing compassion in our endeavours”.\n\n“I have found these values powerful in guiding me through daily conduct and dealings,” Ho added. “The value of persistence has helped me persevere during times of personal and professional challenges… Respecting others and recognising their worth is crucial because everyone has something to contribute… Showing compassion for others is important in a highly diverse society like Singapore.”\n\nHigh-quality education being the social ‘equaliser’\n\nIndeed, amid Singapore’s stratifying society, HCI has long viewed high-quality education as the great social “equaliser” in Singapore.\n\nPang encourages his students to be involved in meaningful community projects. For instance, some of its students go to Westwood Primary School every week to teach pupils from lower-income families, while others organise workshops to help train others in debating skills and language proficiency.\n\n“It’s important for students to reach out the different segments of the society, in order to understand how to contribute to larger good,” he said. “As a school, through our Direct School Admission outreach programme, we continue to look out for deserving students – especially those from less-advantaged families – with strength of character to fit into our school culture.\n\n“As Singapore is a gateway between the East and the West, we hope our students can continue to be culturally savvy, be plugged into the region, and be confident to navigate the current global landscape. Wherever they are, we hope they can live with passion, lead with compassion.”"
