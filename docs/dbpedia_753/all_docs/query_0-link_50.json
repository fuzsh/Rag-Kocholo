During the second decade of Chinese Illini enrollment, a great many more agriculturalists, business leaders, engineers, humanities majors, and scientists would choose Illinois to study. In fact, there were at least two local weddings and three locally produced theatrical performances too.\n\nRead on to learn more about early Chinese Illini!\n\nIllinois – China Connections\n\nDuring the earliest years of the Chinese Illini story, a few faculty members had developed connections with China too. From 1903 to 1905, Geology Professor Eliot Blackwelder was an assistant geologist on a Carnegie Institute Expedition to China. [1] Just five years later, in 1910, Professor Ambrose P. Winston (1893-1894) later took a position as an Economy Professor in the College of Finance in Beijing. [2] More connections would develop over time, including even more alumni working in China.\n\nAlumni in China\n\nThe early Illinois alumni directories (Record Series 26/4/801) list a few more Illini in China. Ms. Helen M. Wilson (A. B. Literature, Art, and Science, 1916) married fellow Illini Mr. Waldo L. Schlueter (A.B. Commerce, 1916) and they were living in Shanghai, while Mr. Schlueter was a representative for the Standard Oil Company. [3] That same year came Ms. Katherine Caroline Halsey, (A.M.

In fact, so too did Chinese student organizations and their generous services to the University community.\n\nChinese Students’ Club\n\nDuring the 1920s, the Chinese Students’ Club organized a variety of events on campus including Chinese Independence Day parties, cultural performances, and stage productions of plays in Chinese. At the beginning of the decade, the Club saw opportunity for growth, as they searched for a larger club house.\n\nIt was January 6, 1920, when the DI first announced the public performance dates for a Chinese Students’ Club production of “Rainbow”. The dramatic production was written by Mr. Shun Hung, a Chinese student studying at Harvard University, and adapted by Mr. T. E. Mao of Pittsburgh. [35] The story takes place in contemporary China, as The play’s synopsis can be read in DI staff writer Ms. Lois M. Wine’s review. The performance was well received, as documented in Mr. S. L. Liang’s editorial which thanked the University community for their support and interest.\n\nIn 1921, the Club organized the production “China: Past, Present, and Future”, which was written by Chinese Illini Mr. Chi Chuan Yu (B.A. Liberal Arts and Science, 1921). The two-act play contrasted historic Chinese schools with a modern school in Shanghai to describe over one century of changes in Chinese education, the DI reported.\n\nIn 1923, another locally written production, “The Philosopher’s Stone” by Chun On Ngan (B.S. Chemical Engineering, 1924; M.S. Chemical Engineering, 1925), was performed in early May. Upon the arrival of one of the first women Chinese Illini, Miss Pauline Chiang, a female character was added to the story. The story took place in eighteenth century China, featuring the reconciliation of a Chinese emperor and his brother. The performance was hosted off-campus, at the Wesley Foundation.\n\nWhile it might be that these three shows were some of the only Chinese Students’ Club programs of the early 1920s, the remainder of the decade saw many more events. In September 1918, the Midwest Chinese Students’ Alliance meeting was hosted. Annual independence day festivals were hosted at the Club House at 204 East John Street too. A new Club constitution was ratified in 1923, and an annual banquet series was initiated (1923, 1924, 1925).\n\nAre you a Chinese Illini? Do you know someone who is? We’d like to hear from you!
