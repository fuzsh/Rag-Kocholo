These credential comparisons represent common educational patterns within each country. They don’t take into account the recognition status of the institution through which a credential was obtained, the authenticity of the documentation, or the particular pattern of education followed by an individual.\n\nFormer USSR - education guide\n\nFormer USSR - credential templates\n\nCountry overview\n\nOfficial country name: Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (former USSR)\n\nLocation: Eastern Europe and northern Asia\n\nCapital: Moscow\n\nArea: 22.4 million square km\n\nPopulation: 286.7 million (1989 census\n\nEthnicity: According to the 1989 census, Russians represented 51% of the population. Other ethnic groups included: Ukrainian (15%), Uzbek (6%), Byelorussian (4%), Kazakh (3%), and Azerbaijani (2%), amongst others.\n\nReligion: 60% of the population reported being atheists in the 1989 census. Of those who reported practicing a religion, 20% identified themselves as being Russian Orthodox; 10% as Muslim; and 7% as following other Christian religions.\n\nLanguages: Russian was the official language and the language of instruction of the former USSR.\n\nFounding Date: Following several years of civil unrest, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was formed in 1922. In December 1991, the USSR splintered into Russia and 14 other independent nations.\n\nGovernment and Administration: The USSR was a single-party communist state, with one soviet federative socialist republic and fourteen soviet socialist republics.\n\nSchool education\n\nThe USSR followed a 10 or 11-year system of education, consisting of 3 or 4 years of primary school, 5 years of lower secondary school and 2 years of upper secondary school. One notable exception was the Baltic republics, where the overall length of school education varied between 11 and 12 years. Upon successful completion of upper secondary school, students received a school-issued Certificate of Secondary Education (Аттестат о среднем образовании / Attestat o srednem obrazovanii). This credential gave access to university study.\n\nHigher education overview\n\nThe Soviet system of higher education consisted of 2 distinct phases: a first 5-year phase, resulting in a Diploma of Specialist and a second phase of graduate studies.\n\nThe Diploma of Specialist (Диплом Специалиста / Diplom spetsialista), or First Diploma (Первый Диплом / Pervyi diplom) was the traditional first degree in the Soviet higher education system. The document itself was normally entitled Diploma of Completion of Higher Education (Диплом об окончании высшего учебного заведения / Diplom ob okonchanii vysshego uchebnogo zavedeniia) or just Diploma (Диплом / Diplom). Most specialists’ diploma programs required 5 years of full-time study, though medicine required 6 years, as did some fine arts, engineering and technology disciplines. A few disciplines, such as teaching, required 4-years of study.\n\nThe Candidate of Sciences degree (Кандидат наук / Kandidat nauk) was the first graduate degree offered in the USSR. It was a research-based program that required a minimum of 3 years of study involving coursework and a supervised thesis.\n\nThe Doctor of Sciences (Доктор наук / Doktor nauk) was a highly research-focused program for senior scholars that typically required 5 to fifteen years of full-time study following the Candidate of Sciences. A thesis and the publication of 10 to 20 scientific papers were required.\n\nTechnical education\n\nFormal Technical and Vocational Education programs in the Russian Federation are offered at both the secondary and post-secondary levels.\n\nThe Diploma of Lower Vocational Education (Диплом о начальном профессиональном образовании / Diplom o nachalnom professionalnom obrazovanii) is typically referred to as the Diploma of Skilled Worker. Admission requirements vary, and students may be admitted based on the Certificate of Incomplete Secondary Education or the Certificate of Completion of Secondary Education. The duration of studies varies between one and 4 years depending on the admission requirements and on whether the education incorporates complete secondary education. The Diploma of Lower Vocational Education gives access to employment; and if complete secondary education is incorporated into the studies, then the Diploma may also give access to higher education.\n\nThe Diploma of Higher Vocational Education (Диплом о среднем профессиональном образовании / Diplom o srednem professionalnom obrazovanii) and a professional title (i.e. Diploma of Technician, Diploma of Nurse and etc) are awarded to students who successfully complete the requisite coursework and state final examinations. Admission may be based on the Certificate of Incomplete Secondary Education or the Certificate of Completion of Secondary Education.\n\nThe duration of studies varies between 2 and 5 years depending on the entrance requirements and on the type of educational institution attended. Graduates of higher vocational programs are entitled to apply to institutions of higher education and may receive advanced standing in relevant bachelor’s or specialist diploma programs.\n\nInstitutions\n\nIn 1991, there were 904 higher education institutions. State education in the USSR was free and administered by the State Committee for Public Education. Institutions of higher education included universities, institutes, academies, and conservatories. The types of institutions were considered equal in terms of academic standards, admission requirements and awards offered.\n\nThe National Information Centre on Academic Recognition and Mobility provides a list of current accredited institutions in the Russian Federation. However, please keep in mind that the names of institutions may have changed over the years, and that this list does not include institutions located in the other 14 independent nations.\n\nMost lower vocational programs in the USSR were offered by either professional technical uchilischche or secondary professional technical uchilischche. Higher vocational education was offered by the following 3 types of specialized secondary institutions: tekhnikum, uchilischche, and colleges (since 1989).\n\nCredentials comparison\n\nFull credential templates\n\nThese templates give detailed information on educational credentials awarded for programs of study completed in the Former USSR.\n\nThe templates include:\n\nofficial name of credential\n\nalternative names\n\nstandardized English translation (if applicable)\n\ntime period the credential was offered\n\nissuing body, admission requirements into the program\n\ndescriptive program information\n\nrecommendations on how the credential compares to educational standards in Alberta\n\nFormer USSR - credential templates\n\nAdditional resources\n\nCIA 1990 World Factbook\n\nNational Information Centre on Academic Recognition and Mobility\n\nRelated"
