        "text": "In May 1853, five Christian Brothers moved their small Canal Street school to what was then known as Manhattanville, a section of New York City at 131st Street and Broadway. The Brothers were the bearers of an educational tradition that began in 17th century France with Saint John Baptist de La Salle, the Patron Saint of Teachers. The Lasallian tradition created a new type of school system and elevated the work of teaching school — treating it as a profession and a vocation. The Brothers were urged to go beyond rote memory to “touch the hearts” of the students. Practical subjects were taught that would lead to a useful role in society; religion was taught to impart a commitment to Christian ethics.\n\nBetween 1853 and 1863, the school grew significantly, adding college-level courses in 1859, and first using the name Manhattan College in 1861. It was chartered by the Board of Regents of the State of New York on April 2, 1863. Manhattan College was an unusual institution compared to its peer institutions at the time because it sought to combine broad learning in the traditional liberal arts with rigorous technical and pre-professional training. In the late 19th century, our nickname the Jaspers was established by Brother Jasper, the prefect of discipline and baseball coach. Learn more about Brother Jasper.\n\nToday, Manhattan College identifies itself as a Catholic college in the Lasallian tradition. That tradition has continued to characterize the unique educational experience offered by the College over its long history. Our constant focus has been the education of the disadvantaged, a commitment that is evident in Manhattan’s diverse student body, many of whom are the first in their families to attend college.\n\nOver the years, Manhattan College has seen many changes, and yet it maintains its deep commitment to its heritage and ideals. What was a predominantly Christian Brothers faculty has become predominantly lay, and includes a significant percentage of women, but the dedication of the faculty is unwavering.\n\nThe College continues to follow the founding spirit of John Baptist de La Salle by being responsive to the needs of its place and time. Innovation grounded in tradition has always been a hallmark of Lasallian education, and Manhattan College’s strategic plan commits the College to a course of continuous improvement of its programs and facilities in response to emerging needs."
