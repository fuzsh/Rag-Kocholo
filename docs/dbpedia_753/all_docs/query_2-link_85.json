        "text": "The annual Chung Ching Middle School sports meet on July 31, 2010 was the finish line for me in the hectic month of July. What an eventful and productive month it had been for me and for so many other people who reveled in the festivity of His Majesty our Sultan’s birthday celebration in all districts. I was particularly excited at the opportunity to capture the vibrant atmosphere that I’ve come to expect from the school event, not only because my children were involved in an activity one way or another but also the event was held at the new Anthony Abell College (AAC) sports field where runners from other schools were invited to participate.\n\nThe end of the line in the field opened up opportunities of epic proportions when pictures from the event were posted on Facebook. As soon as word got out, the beginning of a new race took over at an overwhelming rate. I lost count how many students added me followed by the countless number of friends tag approvals I’ve had to approve. Check out The Brunei Times coverage of the event by Chua Guan Cheong."
