        "text": "HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS\n\nHigh school students preparing for college make up one portion of the Foundation’s clients. Identifying strengths and weaknesses as a result of aptitude testing can make the process of making decisions about schools and majors much easier. Before investing time and money in education, it makes sense to give some thought to how that education relates to careers.\n\nCOLLEGE STUDENTS & GRADS\n\nCollege students may have already made some decisions about education and career, and they will benefit from learning about their aptitudes too. Gaining insight into which role is most appropriate for them within a given field, or learning about new ideas they hadn’t previously considered, are just two examples of the kinds of information college students would obtain from our testing.\n\nWORKING ADULTS\n\nAbout half our clients are employed adults who want help in planning their career path. Adults who decide to take advantage of the Foundation’s aptitude testing program include people unhappy or dissatisfied by their current jobs, those facing promotions or transfers, and those who are facing downsizing or other types of career transition.\n\nScheduling & Cost\n\nOur aptitude testing program consists of two in-person testing sessions, each about three-hours long, and the evaluation conference, which is conducted over Zoom and runs between 60 and 90 minutes. Most of our clients choose the one-day testing format (testing in the morning and afternoon with a lunch break in the middle of the day), but separate, half-day testing appointments are also available.\n\nOur current fee is $950. We request a $100 deposit to hold appointments."
