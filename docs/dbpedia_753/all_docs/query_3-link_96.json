        "text": "We started as the university farm\n\nWe first opened our doors in 1908 as the University Farm, the research and science-based instruction extension of UC Berkeley. As the century evolved, our mission expanded beyond agriculture to match a larger understanding of how we should be serving the public. By 1959, UC Davis had grown into a general campus with its own personality and strengths.\n\nOver the years, as our geographical footprint developed, each new UC Davis presence — in Tahoe, Sacramento, Bodega Bay, Tulare, San Diego and China, to name a few — has strengthened our ability to serve the public through research, academics and public service.\n\nMilestones\n\nUC Davis is known worldwide for our expertise in agriculture and veterinary medicine. But how did we become one of the top 10 public universities in the United States? Check out our milestones.\n\nIn the early days\n\n1908: The Farm School launches the first farmers’ short courses, similar to intensive extension classes of today.\n\n1909: After University Farm School opens in January with 18 students, in May, more than 2,200 people attend the first Picnic Day.\n\n1915: The Division of Agricultural Engineering is established (later named the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering).\n\n1916: Animals from the University Farm herd sweep championships at the Chicago International Livestock Show.\n\n1922: A four-year degree program is established, and the Davis campus is renamed the Northern Branch of the College of Agriculture.\n\n1938: The campus is renamed the College of Agriculture at Davis.
