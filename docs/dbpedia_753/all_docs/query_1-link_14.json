C F A üí¨ 18:54, 29 July 2024 (UTC)\n\nComment: An entire paragragh Fridays were declared a weekend holiday and the school syllabus was changed in 1974, in line with the national policy and syllabus wherein English and Malay were taught in primary school. After 1975, the medium of instruction in the school was officially changed to English with the exception of Mandarin Chinese, Bahasa Melayu (Malay), Sejarah (history), music, physical education, art, and moral or civic education. In the same year, government-assigned teachers were brought in to teach Bahasa Melayu (Malay) in the primary level, with their salaries shouldered by the government. In 1976, Year 11 or Form 5 students sat for the GCE Ordinary Level exams (O-Level) for the first time instead of internal exams set by the school. The same year, Year 6 or Primary 6 students were also selected based on Malay and English proficiency to sit for the Primary Certificate of Education (PCE) exams. The next year, students sitting for the PCE and the Brunei Junior Certificate of Education (BJCE) exams achieved record results. only to be backed up by one Blogspot link.

Example:Article: The school has always been working to develop creative methods to incorporate information and communication technology (ICT) into the curriculum and management in this era of rapid technological growth.Source: In this era of vigorous technological advancement, the school has always been gearing up to create innovative ways of integrating information and communication technology (ICT) into the curriculum and management. Ca talk to me! 10:27, 8 November 2023 (UTC)\n\nComment: Resubmitted. \"some rewriting needed\" is not a reason for decline. The article is extensively footnoted and the sections without footnotes appear to be easy enough to verify (or remove). asilvering (talk) 20:30, 1 November 2023 (UTC)\n\nComment: Generally good, but some rewriting needed. Some of the sentences are a bit flowery and promotional. Also needs more citations, especially for the more recent history. Plenty of statements there with no citations to support them.
