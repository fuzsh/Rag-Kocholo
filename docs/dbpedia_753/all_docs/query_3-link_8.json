        "text": "The early years\n\nWorld War II years\n\nWorld War II brought many changes to Alaska. Battles were fought on Alaska soil, the Alaska Highway was built and the activity spawned the first major migration of people into the state since the gold rush. As people moved to Alaska, so did money, ideas and energy.\n\nAs the war ended, the Territory of Alaska ran out of money. The university's accounts were frozen, even as returning soldiers boosted enrollment. In the 1947-1948 academic year, President Bunnell and Fairbanks business leaders kept the school open with pledges totaling $200,000. The Territorial Legislature established new taxes in 1949 that boosted funding for the university.\n\nA wartime national awareness of the need for scientific polar research in the interests of defense and communications led to the establishment in 1946 of the Geophysical Institute at the university. Since its inception, the GI has earned an international reputation for its studies of the earth and the physical environment at high latitudes. The university awarded its first Ph.D. degree to a geophysics student in 1955.\n\nAlaska itself had yet to become a state.\n\nStatehood and beyond\n\nBuilding a modern university\n\nTo meet the need for expanding services for all Alaskans, the university reorganized in 1975. Campuses in Fairbanks, Anchorage and Juneau were assigned their own chancellors. The University of Alaska statewide administration and president remained in Fairbanks.\n\nAnother reorganization in 1987, spurred by a drop in state revenues due to lower oil prices, moved administration of the community colleges from the statewide office to the three main campuses. The Cooperative Extension Service, which has helped fulfill the university's public service mandate since 1930, also moved to UAF.\n\nThe campus in Fairbanks has continued to thrive, along with satellite campuses in Bethel, Dillingham, Kotzebue, Nome and the Interior. Education centers in Fort Yukon, Delta Junction, King Salmon, New Stuyahok, Togiak, Tok and Unalaska also serve rural Alaskans.\n\nThe University of Alaska Museum of the North, one of the state's most popular visitor attractions, moved from Signers' Hall into the Otto Geist Building in 1980. The museum's unique collection offers the public a view of the rich and varied culture of the North. A $42 million expansion in 2006 added more than 40,000 square feet of space.\n\nIn 1981, UAF enrollment topped 5,000 students for the first time. The university also began to emphasize its shared scholarship and global education efforts in a series of agreements with schools in Japan, Denmark, Canada, the People's Republic of China and Russia.\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, UAFâ€™s scientific enterprises expanded. NASA named UAF a Space Grant institution for aerospace research in 1991, making it a Land, Sea and Space Grant institution. The Poker Flat Research Range received continual upgrades. The university established an Arctic biological research field station, earthquake and volcano monitoring centers, a satellite tracking facility and a center for Arctic research.\n\nScientific work continued to expand in the 2010s with creation of a center for unmanned aircraft research and the acquisition of a massive antenna array used to study the upper atmosphere. The research vessel Sikuliaq, a 261-foot ice-capable vessel operated by UAF, arrived in its home port of Seward in 2015.\n\nOn the sports field, UAF earned its 10th NCAA national rifle championship in 2008, and the hockey team went to the NCAA Division I national tournament for the first time in 2010.\n\nToday\n\nUAF's colleges and schools offer instruction in more than 100 disciplines, including vocational and technical programs. Graduate degrees are available in a wide range of academic fields. UAF is internationally known for its research in the Pacific Rim and the circumpolar North. It is consistently among the top 100 universities in the nation for funding from the National Science Foundation.\n\nThere's more\n\nVisit our 2017 centennial celebration website. It offers an interactive timeline, dozens of people profiles and multiple articles about UAF's history and accomplishments.\n\nFor even more historical photos and information about UAF and Alaska, visit the Rasmuson Library's online collections:\n\nAlaska's Digital Archive\n\nThe Butler Brothers' Gold Rush\n\nFilm Clips\n\nOral History (Project Jukebox)\n\nWenger Eskimo Database\n\nIf you're more interested in what's happening today at UAF, visit our online photo gallery or take a virtual tour of the Fairbanks campus."
