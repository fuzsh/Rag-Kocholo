        "text": "Sekolah Chung Hwa Kiudang or Chung Hwa School Kiudang or 九 汀 中 华 学 校 is the name for a local Chinese school in Brunei Darussalam. It was named after the village, Kampong Kiudang (Kiudang Village) where it is a rural village in Tutong District. There are eight Chinese schools in Brunei Darussalam including Chung Hwa School Kiudang. All of them are private schools.\n\nChung Hwa School Kiudang was found in 1951. It is a primary school with kindergarten. There are Kg. 1~3 and Primary 1~6, with a total of 9 classes. Since it is a private school (meaning a non-government school) school fees are paid for the courses.\n\nThe school is run by a board of committee, with acting chairman Mr. Sii Tai Chong. The headmistress is Ms. Loo Shee Yun.\n\nThe children studying in Primary Six sit for the government examinations called Penilaian Sekolah Rendah. Children take five subjects which are Bahasa Melayu, English Language, Mathematics, MIB and Science. Children learn languages such as Bahasa Melayu, Chinese and English.\n\nThe main incomes of the school are from donations, school fees and sponsorships. Since it is a non-profitable primary school, the incomes of school fees can not cover the expenditure of the school. Hence, the staff and the teachers go to the public for donations every Chinese New Year or at special events. As of Jan 2019, there are 118 pupils and 15 teachers.\n\n[edit]\n\nOfficial website"
