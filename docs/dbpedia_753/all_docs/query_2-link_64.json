        "text": "164 Microsoft Showcase Schools and 348 Innovative Educator Experts across the region recognized for outstanding use of education technology innovations\n\nASIA PACIFIC, SINGAPORE, 18 February 2016 – Microsoft Asia Pacific today announced its 2016 class of education innovators featuring 81 Microsoft Showcase Schools and 348 Microsoft Innovative Educator (MIE) Experts from 18 markets across the region. Validated by education leaders and governments as being exceptional thought leaders in creating and leading transformational learning environments through technology, this year’s APAC class of education innovators forms the second largest group from a single region. Hailing from markets including Australia, Bangladesh, Brunei, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, and Vietnam\n\nAlmost one in four Showcase Schools globally come from the Asia Pacific. Globally, the group is significantly larger than last year’s class – with nearly seven times the number of educators and more than four times the number of schools – reflecting Microsoft’s goal of increasing the worldwide pool of innovators and collaborators.\n\n“The 2016 Microsoft Showcase Schools and Innovative Educator Experts is the largest group of education innovators ever selected in APAC. We are seeing more schools and educator experts in the APAC region find new inspiring ways to create immersive and inclusive learning experiences that inspire lifelong learning using mobile-first, cloud-first technologies. This allows students to be empowered students and develop the skills they need in the workplace of tomorrow, “said Don Carlson, Education Lead, Microsoft Asia Pacific.\n\nMicrosoft Showcase Schools\n\nMicrosoft Showcase Schools are selected for demonstrating strong vision for educational change through the effective deployment of Microsoft technology school-wide and applying this vision to the transformation of their local schools. Showcase Schools have also established their capability in creating a conducive environment for both students and educators to thrive, by placing students at the center of their own learning and giving educators opportunities to embrace innovation in the classroom.\n\nShowcase Schools work closely with Microsoft to lead innovation in education and communicate a vision for education enabled by technology through the hosting and mentoring of other schools in the community on transformational educational practices.\n\nBesides being recognized on a global scale for their innovative approaches to educating tomorrow’s workforce, Showcase Schools also get connected to an international group of thought leaders, as part of the Microsoft in Education community for further collaboration; Microsoft IT Academy membership, access to professional development for educators and support to drive innovation among staff, peers, students. The Showcase Schools will also be invited to regional education forums and exclusive monthly community webinars as well as Yammer group discussions.\n\nThe full list of Microsoft Showcase Schools in the APAC region can be found below.
