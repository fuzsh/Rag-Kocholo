Guided by its philosophy of providing education to all without discrimination, the school admitted students from all strata of society. Students came from as far as Thailand and the Philippines. When the Japanese invaded Singapore, the school was forced to discontinue. After World War II, the school resumed in 1945 and subsequently took in female students.\n\nThe school achieved top honours in the first national examination in 1947. With rising enrolment, a 14-acre plot of land at Goodman Road was purchased for a new campus. Chung Cheng High School (Main) occupied the new campus, while the Kim Yan Road campus became home to Chung Cheng High School (Branch). In 1981, following Singaporeâs emphasis on bilingualism, the school began providing English-stream classes. In the late 1990s, there was an urgent need to upgrade the school facilities and move to a more spacious location.\n\nIn January 2003, in preparation for its move to Yishun, Chung Cheng High School (Branch) began operating at two campuses: the Guillemard site and a holding school at Sembawang Drive. In 2005, when the new building in Yishun was completed, Chung Cheng High School (Branch) was renamed Chung Cheng High School (Yishun).Â On 30 June 2006, the school held its official opening ceremony at its new premises.\n\nIn 2014, Chung Cheng High School (Yishun) was one of the 11 pioneer schools offering the Learning for Life Programme (LLP). The schoolâs LLP aims to building sound character in the students by exposing them to traditional Chinese culture and values behind various arts forms. In 2014, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in food science and technology, which seeks to develop the studentsâ analytical, research, communications and interpersonal skills, thereby inspiring them to pursue a career in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) industry.Â\n\nIn 2014, the school celebrated its 75th anniversary together with Chung Cheng High School (Main).Â\n\nInÂ 2019, the school celebrated itsÂ 80th anniversary together with Chung Cheng High School (Main).\n\nPrincipals\n\n- Dr Zhung Zhu Lin (1939â1957)\n\n- Mr Ko Pei Teck (1957â1960)\n\n- Mr Kok Chong Peng (1961â1970)\n\n- Mdm Chuan Wei Lang (1970â1978)\n\n- Mr Chua Hun Cheong (1979â1994)\n\n- Mr Ong Kian Choon (1994â1999)\n\n- Mr Yap Juye Long (1999â2006)\n\n- Mr Ong Kock Hua (2007â2012)\n\n- Mr Yap Thiam Chuan (2012â2018)\n\n- Mr Tan Yee Kan (2019âpresent)\n\nKey Milestones\n\nÂ Â 1939 Founded as a Chinese boysâ school on Kim Yan Road. 1947 Relocation of part of the school to a new school campus on Goodman Road, which is named Chung Cheng High School (Main), while the Kim Yan Road campus is renamed Chung Cheng High School (Branch) (CCHB). 1969 A mutual agreement is reached between the school management committees of Nan Chiau Girlsâ High School and CCHB to swap campuses, and thus CCHB is relocated to Guillemard Road. 1981 Starts English-stream classes and the Chinese-medium stream is gradually phased out. The school also starts offering secondary education in the Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) streams. 2002 Relocation plans to a new campus in the north are firmed up and CCHB makes preparations for the move. 2003 While the construction of the new campus is underway, CCHB operates out of two campuses at Guillemard Road and Sembawang. On 30 March, a groundbreaking ceremony is held at the Yishun campus. 2005 Renamed Chung Cheng High School (Yishun). A moving-in ceremony is held to mark the schoolâs historic move. 2006 Opening ceremony for the schoolâs new campus officiated by Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Minister for Education and Second Minister of Finance. 2014 Celebration of 75th anniversary together with Chung Cheng High School (Main).

The triangle symbolises the synergy of their cooperation in achieving excellence for the school. The use of the colour red represents the school motto, symbolising diligence and perseverance. It inspires students to develop self-discipline and strength of character to put country before self. The colour white represents purity, symbolising the imparting of knowledge and the development of moral character.\n\nSchool Song\n\nâ« Listen\n\næ°å¾ä¸­æ­£Â è³å¤§è³å\n\nçç«ææ´²Â å·å·ææ\n\nåå¤å£°æÂ å¹¿æ«çè\n\næ¬§å°ææÂ ä»å±±ä¹é¿\n\nå¥½å­¦åè¡Â ç¥è»æ¯å¡\n\næ¥æ°æå¼Â ä¸æ¯èªå¼º\n\næ­¢æ¼è³åÂ ä¸å½åå \n\nå¤§åä¸­æ­£Â æ ä¹ æ ç"
