The generosity of the equipment is sponsored and supported by the World Pair Go Association and Thailand Go Association.\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/groups/BruneiGo\n\nThe invited schools were:\n\nChung Hwa Middle School\n\nSt.Andrew’s School\n\nOmar Ali Saifuddien College\n\nSM Jamalul Alam\n\nSM Lambak Kiri\n\nPTE Katok\n\nPTE Meragang\n\nMaktab Duli\n\nMaktab Soas\n\n———————————————\n\n*Presentation*\n\n———————————————\n\nThe Committees were:\n\nPresenter – Sid\n\nOrganiser – Xinwen\n\nCo-Organiser – ChaiHui\n\nVolunteers – ChiaoHong, Javian, ZheFan, ChungSun, Huiyee, PengHui\n\nThe sessions began 09 30 with registration and brief introduction about the game of Weiqi then slowly giving the students more exercises before proceeding to Teaching Game. Some problems award the participants pens and paper fans (sponsored by Taiwan Weiqi Association).\n\n———————————————\n\n*Note of Reminder*\n\n———————————————\n\nThis year again, not all the schools managed to attend mainly because of the date of choice: is the last day of school and most schools have events. Usually it is harder to invite Pre-University College to participate, probably not going to try inviting them anymore next year.\n\nTo get as much participants to join as possible – the Association going to invite up to 14 schools next year to give it a shot of full attendants.\n\nRefreshments were not provided but promised to be given by the boss of Pusat Belia very disappointing.\n\n*Poster unveiled*\n\n[Poster designed by Xinwen]\n\n———————————————\n\nThe Association is very happy to announce that the 2nd District Go Workshop will be held as shown in the poster! 23rd November, 2013. An extension demonstration of Weiqi will be held on the following next day 24th November, 2013. The visitors could visit and learn the game of Weiqi, and of course to witness the tournaments competed by the local talents!\n\nPlease join http://www.facebook.com/groups/BruneiGo for more information.\n\nSeriously, the Association needs a lot of supports from all kind of fields!!"
