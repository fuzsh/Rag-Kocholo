Standard Grant Virginia Carter 11/15/2023 12/31/2024 $208,180.00 999 PEACHTREE ST NE ATLANTA GA 303.094.524 4.049.662.027 EDU 741200 1032, 8038, 9178, SMET 0,00 The ATE program supports biotechnology technician education programs that partner with industry to ensure the education of a skilled bioscience technical workforce. Yet, there remains a gap between educational preparation and industry’s recognition of potential workers who have completed two-year biotechnology programs. Over the next ten years, reports predict that life science companies will have an increased demand for skilled technical workers, and that filling these positions will be difficult. Thus, preparation of sufficient biotechnicians represents a significant need for the biological economy and related sectors. This project aims to bridge the gap between education and industry through an industry-recognized biotechnician credentialing system. Recently, the Bioscience Industry has identified the Biotechnician Assistant Credentialing Exam (BACE) as an effective tool to certify student capabilities. This exam is already used in six states and the District of Columbia, thus increasing its potential to become the industry-recognized credentialing system for entry-level biotechnicians. This project will pilot the BACE system in five additional states, build consortia of industry and education stakeholders, and disseminate BACE broadly through InnovATEBIO (an NSF ATE Center of Excellence) and the Consortium for Advanced Manufacturing of Cell-based Therapies (an Advanced Technical Education Coordination Network). A nationwide industry-recognized credentialing system will give students a portable credential that is recognized across the nation, thus helping to address the workforce gap in the life science industry. This credentialing model may also inform credentialing approaches for other areas of technician education.\n\nThe BACE credential was developed through engagement of educators with industry and industry representatives. This partnership continues to evaluate the credential to ensure that it meets changing industry needs. This project intends to expand the number of states using the BACE by adding Georgia, Washington, California, Texas, and Nebraska. To this end, it will set up state task forces comprised of industry professionals, educational leaders, and government representatives. Each task force will examine the use and sustainability of BACE in their state. Testing sites will be established in each state, and the sites will provide faculty and teachers with professional development to understand the BACE, so they can support students’ exam preparation. The project will leverage the extensive networks of InnovATEBIO and the Consortium for Advanced Manufacturing of Cell-based Therapies to disseminate the BACE credential, and also disseminate it through national and state industry associations, district-level industry advisory boards, boards of education, technical educators, and government officials. A nationally recognized credential has strong potential to improve the transition from two-year college technician education programs to employment in the biotechnology industry. This result would not only serve the industry, but also serve the emerging workforce by identifying skillsets in demand across the country. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation’s economy.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. 2400407 Curriculum Integration in Training EVs (CITE) DUE Advanced Tech Education Prog 04/15/2024 Carl Stutz cjstutz@waketech.edu NC Wake Technical Community College Standard Grant Olga Pierrakos 07/01/2024 06/30/2027 $636,128.00 John McNary 9101 FAYETTEVILLE RD RALEIGH NC 276.035.655 9.198.665.076 EDU 741200 1032, 9178, SMET 0,00 Wake Technical Community College (Wake Tech) in Raleigh, North Carolina will be investigating emerging electric vehicle (EV) and hybrid vehicle workforce challenges in the nation's race to increase energy security.

GST helps to solve problems by looking at data in a way that is readily displayed, can be spatially analyzed, and easily shared. It is a science that includes Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing and image analysis, mapping and cartography, spatial analysis, and data collection tools such as global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). Whether it is the map on a smart phone or the navigation system in a car, the base-map in a video game, or the maps that one sees on TV, “geospatial” is all around. The science of GST is being used in resource management, environmental studies, urban planning, criminology, homeland security, military analysis, archaeology, precision agriculture, health sciences, political science, public safety and emergency response, physical sciences, earth sciences, marketing, logistics, economics, business, history, and virtually any other field that has a spatial and/or temporal component. Due to the ubiquitous nature of GST and the need for spatial analysis across many disciplines, instructors from middle school through college are embedding GST into their curriculum (including web-based mapping tools) to promote spatial thinking, or are offering GST specific courses or programs at their respective institutions to prepare students to successfully enter the workforce. The GeoTech National ATE Center is proposing to transition from a national center to a national Resource Center. The GeoTech Resource Center will focus on researching evolving workforce geospatial competencies and career pathways, curriculum modification based on changes/revisions to workforce geospatial competencies, curriculum especially designed for historically underserved populations, and professional development opportunities for secondary and post-secondary educators.\n\nThe goals for the GeoTech Geospatial Resource Center are: 1) Research, create, and aggregate competencies that will support careers and programs. 2) Create and disseminate curriculum resources in an easily searchable resource repository, and 3) Provide professional development opportunities in face- to-face and virtual synchronous and asynchronous modalities to prepare educators to teach standards- based curriculum. These goals will provide the geospatial community of users (educators and industry professionals alike) curricular offerings in cutting edge GST, which is crucial in creating a well-prepared geospatial technician and technologist workforce. An evaluative process will be implemented to continually review workforce competencies, improve the educational materials produced, and enrich innovative professional development offerings. Learning modules will developed and will be contextual and relevant to historically underserved populations to excite them about GST careers and applications. Lessons will address a wide spectrum of social justice issues for people of color, women, tribal institutions, the LGBTQ community, and historical lessons such as redline maps. Environmental current events such as climate change and wildfires will also be addressed. The curriculum will be modularized and portable to different learning environments and therefore designed to reach a large cohort of users. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. 2000715 Improving Pathways into the Geospatial and Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technician Workforce DUE Advanced Tech Education Prog 08/10/2020 Chris Carter cxcarter@odu.edu VA Old Dominion University Research Foundation Standard Grant Keith Sverdrup 10/01/2020 09/30/2024 $561,977.00 David Webb, John McGee, Cheryl Aukland, Shawn Shields Lyons 4111 MONARCH WAY NORFOLK VA 235.082.561 7.576.834.293 EDU 741200 1032, 9178, SMET 0,00 Demand for skilled technicians in geospatial technologies and small unmanned aircraft systems continues to increase as new applications are developed for these emerging technologies.

This project aims address this gap by identifying the economic impact of technician education programs and workforce development at two-year institutions. The research will investigate the hypothesis that community college technician education programs and the NSF Advanced Technological Education (ATE) Program form an infrastructure that creates both a workforce of skilled technicians and an ecosystem of supports that help to increase workplace productivity and innovation, thus spurring regional economic development. The multi-faceted mixed-methods research study will include a national analysis of community college technician education and economic development, as well as in-depth regional case studies of technician education and industries in advanced manufacturing. The national analyses will examine data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Statistics and the U.S. Census County Business Patterns. Case study sites will be selected based on ATE program investments, level of rurality, manufacturing sector, economic context, and economic development region. The project will advance understanding of technician education’s contribution to economic development in two ways. First, the project will develop a more refined conception of the role that community college technician education plays in economic development. Second, the project will provide a deeper examination of workplace outcomes beyond simple employment and earnings models to generate insights on the nature of technician work and on innovation and productivity in the workplace.\n\nIn addition to a new data collection, two primary datasets will be combined in the analyses: the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Statistics data and the U.S. Census County Business Patterns data. Both use the North American Industry Classification System. The Integrated Post-Secondary Education System data and ATE program award data will be used to measure different cognate areas, such as the number of students in higher education. The National Center for Education Statistics crosswalk between Classification of Instruction Program codes with the Standard Occupation Classification codes will be used to link education programs to occupations. The project will examine trends in technician production from community colleges and trends in the technician labor market, which will be augmented with data from the NSF’s National Training, Education, and Workforce Survey. A quasi-experimental difference-in-differences approach will be used to establish causal linkages between technician education/ATE program and innovation/economic and workforce development. On-going work by the Aspen Institute and the State New Economy Index will inform case study measures and analyses. Comparative analysis of the linked case studies will contribute to: identifying the presence or absence of the phenomenon of interest; exploring how the phenomenon varies across conditions; investigating differences in the impact of the phenomenon; testing theoretical and emerging linkages among different phenomena; and examining conditions under which the phenomenon arises. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. 2400719 Building a Sustainable Transportation Service Technician Education Program DUE Advanced Tech Education Prog 04/11/2024 Patrick English patrickenglish@ferris.edu MI Ferris State University (Inc.)

Yet despite the high demand in the market, the skills gap is rising leaving drone service providers and related organizations scrambling to fill drone-related positions. This project will address the needs of an ever-expanding industry by providing both secondary and post-secondary educators and students with a variety of educational opportunities, such as: 1) Up-to-date and relevant work-based curriculum; 2) Articulation agreements between partnering secondary and post-secondary institutions; 3) Professional development workshops in UAS applications and operations; and 4) Summer high school academies specifically designed to inform and excite students (many of whom are from traditionally underserved and underrepresented communities) about UAS applications, educational opportunities, and career pathways. A unique element of the summer academies is the inclusion of students from the Pacific Islands, providing an opportunity for students from San Diego County and the Pacific Islands to become culturally connected, learn from one another, work together with different global perspectives to solve problems, and potentially make life-long connections with someone from a different part of the world. The project team includes college faculty, secondary school partners, educational consultants, and industry professionals. This project will provide relevant curriculum and educational opportunities for both secondary and post-secondary students, better preparing them to become skilled and thoughtful members of the UAS workforce.\n\nThe mission of this project is to strengthen the educational opportunities and career pathways in drone technology and applications for secondary and post-secondary students so that they can succeed as employees or entrepreneurs in the ever-expanding UAS field. To meet the mission, three goals will be implemented, each with a set of objectives, activities, and deliverables: 1) Curriculum: In consultation with industry and education partners, the project team will: a) Create industry-aligned work-based learning projects; b) Develop and offer an advanced course in drone photography and videography; c) Create a set of engineering learning modules (in manufacturing, maintenance, and customization) to be offered in existing introductory engineering courses which will then be added to the list of program electives. 2) Professional Development: UAS are being used across a variety of disciplines, therefore it is important that secondary and post-secondary educators in those disciplines have hands-on, professional development opportunities in UAS applications so that they can share this information with their students. As part of the 2-day workshops, participants will create curriculum that will be vetted and placed on the National Center for Autonomous Technologies (NCAT) resource repository. 3) Secondary Education: In order to link high school learning experiences to college and careers, the project will do the following activities: a) Partner high school UAS curriculum will be cross-walked and modified where needed in order to articulate it to the college curriculum. The articulated course will create an academic pipeline for students, as the course will go toward the completion of the Southwestern College Drone Technology and Applications Certificate. b) The project will host hybrid summer drone academies for students in San Diego County and the Pacific Islands. At the academies, students will receive real-time instruction on flight training, data collection/processing, autonomous flight coding, and collaborative problem solving. The project evaluation will include formative feedback throughout the 3-year project along with annual evaluation reports that will assess progress towards achieving the goals and objectives. A summative evaluation at the end of the project will examine the effectiveness of strategies and provide an overall assessment of how well the project has met its goals. To maximize impact, the best practices and resulting content of the project will be documented and disseminated in publications, at various conferences, and on NCAT. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. 2055708 Industry Aligned Rural Engineering Program DUE Advanced Tech Education Prog 06/30/2021 James Fisher jim.fisher@imperial.edu CA Imperial Valley College Standard Grant Christine Delahanty 07/01/2021 06/30/2024 $300,000.00 Oscar Vazquez-Mena 380 E ATEN RD IMPERIAL CA 922.519.653 7.603.556.241 EDU 741200 102Z, 1032, 9178, SMET 0,00 Diversifying the economic and industrial base of rural communities is challenging. For example, rural communities can struggle to produce a workforce aligned with local industry needs. This struggle is especially true for isolated communities in areas with challenging environmental conditions like those found in Imperial County, CA, where the temperature can exceed 110 degrees for an extended period of time in the summer. This area has the second highest poverty rate and the highest ratio of migrant agricultural workers in the state. Although the agricultural sector dominates the workforce, a small group of committed industrial partners has a keen interest in developing a home-grown, local pipeline of engineering students. These industrial leaders have failed to attract qualified candidates to the inhospitable region, leaving higher paying jobs unfilled. The industries represent the energy, water, and mining industries whose employees have overlapping skill sets. This award will enable Imperial Valley College, a rural Hispanic Serving Institution, to develop a one-year Engineering Technology Certificate that will produce the skilled technical workers needed by these industries. By preparing workers for high paying, stable jobs in the local economy, this project the potential to help mitigate the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on rural and Hispanic communities.\n\nThe certificate program will provide Imperial Valley College students with the classes needed to achieve their educational goals and meet the needs of the local industries. The project builds on three things: an existing partnership between Imperial Valley College and the University of California San Diego, a baseline survey of Imperial Valley College students that indicated a strong interest in an engineering program, and the commitment of local industry partners. To develop the new certificate program, Imperial Valley College will create a new makerspace, adopt curriculum from UCSD, and place students who complete the certificate into internships with local industries. The new makerspace will help educate students and their families about high wage technician job opportunities in industry. The evaluation of this project will inform industry and education stakeholders about how to effectively build and strengthen a relationship between a community college and a four-year institution. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. 1931215 Engaging Educators, Strengthening Practice: Creating & Sustaining Successful Industry-Education Partnerships DUE Advanced Tech Education Prog 07/01/2019 Mary Slowinski m.slowinski@bellevuecollege.edu WA Bellevue College Standard Grant Virginia Carter 12/01/2019 11/30/2024 $1,970,027.00 Rachael Bower, Edward Almasy 3000 LANDERHOLM CIR SE BELLEVUE WA 980.076.484 4.255.642.042 EDU 741200 1032, 9178, SMET 0,00 The Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program strives to meet the nation's demand for skilled technicians by developing and improving technology education in community and technical colleges. As technological workforce needs multiply and skilled workers become increasingly difficult to find, this effort becomes ever more critical to the health of our national economy. The employer needs for right-skilled graduates is well-documented. For example, in its most recent survey, the Manpower Group found that nearly half of employers are having difficulty filling US jobs. In addition, they report that, for the 6th consecutive year, skilled trades positions are the hardest positions to fill. When asked why they were unable to fill roles, almost half of employers point to a lack of applicants or a lack of applicants with the necessary hard or soft skills. Mitigating such disparities between workforce needs and worker skills are important goals of community and technical colleges. Strong industry partnerships are fundamental to this work. When done well, these relationships stimulate exchange and dialogue between institutions and employers that, in turn, ensure program currency, alignment with workforce needs, awareness of industry trends, and the production of graduates who are right-skilled and work-ready. Strengthening these beneficial collaborations is not only critical for the grantees of the National Science Foundation's ATE program, but for all colleges and programs that wish to advance technological education and expand opportunities and pathways for students and the communities in which they serve.\n\nThe Engaging Educators, Strengthening Practice project team has investigated education-industry partnerships across the ATE community and has found that 78% of PIs have received no training or support for forming or maintaining industry partnerships. In addition, none mentioned instruction or guided development of an industry partnership action plan or support for the execution of such a plan. This project will develop curricula that supports educators in establishing and sustaining industry partnerships. The curriculum will be delivered during in-person workshops and webinars. Workshop participants will construct an industry partnership action plan based on research and best practices, as well as aligned with their specific organizational goals. The project will: 1) Develop curricula that supports educators in establishing and sustaining industry partnerships; 2) Facilitate the use of a rubric for partnership assessment/evaluation; 3) Provide professional development workshops and webinars to guide the use of the materials and to build participant community; 4) Establish online learning exchanges for post-workshop participant knowledge transfer, support, and collaboration; 5) Adapt workshop materials for online reference and use by participants and others; and 6) Disseminate the tools, findings, and outcomes of these efforts via the project website, conference presentations, published reports, and webinars. The project website and resources will be designed to ensure that they are accessible by all users, including those with disabilities. All appropriate resources will be archived with ATE Central to ensure sustainability.

The need for a GST workforce that possesses current industry-defined skills and competencies is expanding at a rapid rate. Today, GST is becoming an essential tool in fields including (but not limited to) emergency response, sustainability, agro-science, energy, and a variety of STEM disciplines. These occupations require a skillset in the analysis of spatial data and geo-visualization. One impact of this project will be the national expansion and diversification of a GST workforce that possesses relevant and current industry-defined GST skills and competencies. GeoTech Center research has identified a lack of educational materials to meet the needs of the broad geospatial community of users. Curricula that are standardized and contextual, and that can be used in traditional college learning environments, as well as by individuals for self-improvement, is desperately needed. The GeoTech Center will design and develop industry-aligned educational materials that can be used in a modularized format and portable to different learning environments.\n\nThe GeoTech Center has four integrated Goals: 1) Research emerging trends and uses of GST; 2) Develop industry-aligned curriculum for new and incumbent users of GST; 3) Investigate best practices to increase (and retain) the number of underserved and underrepresented populations (including veterans, women, minority groups, and persons with disabilities) into GST and STEM fields; and 4) Develop and implement professional development opportunities and resources for secondary and post-secondary faculty. In order to successfully accomplish its Goals, the Center will build on strong, documented relationships with professional GST organizations and provide new and current workers access to educational resources to assist them in filling any gaps in their GST skillset (and for them to receive recognition of those skills through micro-credentials and professional certifications). The Center will expand its Community of Practice and address specific educational needs of targeted audiences, including underserved and underrepresented students, veterans, and faculty in STEM disciplines. The efforts of the Center to accomplish its Goals will provide the optimum framework and resources to increase the number and diversity of learners and workers who possess industry-defined GST skills and competencies. 2201631 CREATE Energy National Center DUE Advanced Tech Education Prog 09/12/2023 Kenneth Walz kwalz@madisoncollege.edu WI Madison Area Technical College Standard Grant Virginia Carter 07/01/2022 06/30/2027 $7,914,445.00 Kathleen Alfano, Jennifer Clemons, Kevin Cooper, Andrew McMahan 1701 WRIGHT ST MADISON WI 537.042.599 6.082.466.676 EDU 741200 1032, 9178, SMET 0,00 Most of the current energy infrastructure in the U.S. was built in the five decades from the 1920s to the late 1970s. The U.S. is now faced with the challenge of replacing this aging and soon to be obsolete infrastructure, while a tremendous opportunity exists globally to create new sustainable industries and economies through renewable energy, energy storage, energy efficiency and other advanced, smart, and clean energy technologies.

Out of the ~3,200 projected annual openings in biotechnology-related jobs, more than 2,000 require an associate degree or less. The most recent statewide data indicate a massive gap in availability of these trained biotechnicians, with an annual average production in Los Angeles county of only ~50 individuals. The largest demand is for quality control and manufacturing technicians. This project will help fill this demand by providing comprehensive training and internships in biomanufacturing, a process that uses cells (or parts of cells) to produce useful products such as proteins. The biotechnology industry is one of the sectors that has been most resilient and least impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, people from the communities served by the college, including students who are Hispanic, have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. By training biomanufacturing technicians, this project will help put people back to work in more secure, well-paying jobs, and contribute to mitigating the financial impacts of COVID-19 on these individuals.\n\nThis project aims to address major regional needs for biotechnology talent by establishing a protein biomanufacturing training program. By accomplishing this goal, the project will provide a pipeline for students from high school to two-year college, and then to employment or transfer to a four-year biomanufacturing program. To create the program, three new courses will be developed, implemented, and evaluated. Complementing the coursework, the project will establish a student-centered Contract Manufacturing Organization that will provide internship opportunities for students in protein biomanufacturing. The protein (Taq polymerase) will be produced by student interns working in college laboratories, and provided at low cost to local high school and community college bioscience classrooms, as well as to national course-based undergraduate research experiences programs, including the DNA Learning Center’s DNA Barcoding experience and the Amgen Biotech Experience. By providing affordable enzymes to bioscience classrooms in less-resourced institutions, the project can help mitigate COVID-19 impacts on the institutions and support greater learning opportunities for the students they serve.

They are also used for medical and other purposes. For example, nearly 300 employers across the United States develop antibody-based drugs or diagnostic tests, sell antibodies as bioreagents, or provide antibody-related laboratory services. Not surprisingly, antibodies are an important front-line tool for diagnosing and treating COVID-19 infections. Bioengineering antibodies is an active area of applied biotechnology research. Bioengineered antibodies have the potential to reduce the costs of antibody manufacturing and storage, as well as to improve antibody-based drug delivery. This project will enlist faculty, industry-representatives, and two-year college students from across the United States to participate in developing and implementing research projects in antibody bioengineering. The research projects and laboratory protocols that derive from this work will help two-year colleges incorporate high-impact and relevant technologies into new or existing courses, thus providing a mechanism to engage students while preparing them to work in fulfilling careers. In addition, the project will provide expert information about COVID-19 vaccine development and testing, thus benefitting students, instructors, and the public.\n\nThe specific aims of the project include 1) developing laboratory modules to support course-based undergraduate research experiences related to antibody bioengineering, and 2) investigating the feasibility of using hackathons as a novel strategy for engaging participants in collaborative curriculum development. The project will develop learning modules that each address computational skills (e.g., data science, structural biology, bioinformatics), technical skills (e.g., mutagenesis, protein purification, assays, staining), and employability skills (e.g., poster presentations, communication, leadership). The modules will list related skill standards and learning outcomes, making it easy for instructors to incorporate the modules in their courses and for employers to evaluate portfolios of students participating in the research. The project team has assembled a national advisory board comprised of individuals with expertise in antibody technologies from biotechnology companies, research institutions, and core laboratories. Board members have agreed to provide guidance concerning project ideas and industry needs, as well as to evaluate modules. An annual hackathon will be held where the participants will organize in teams around one of the industry-suggested projects or other new project ideas. During the hackathon, the teams will work to refine the ideas, and to identify the modules and materials needed for each project. Project pitches at the end of the hackathon will be used to determine which projects will be selected for development and implementation. The project team and faculty collaborators will continue to develop the selected modules, implement the projects with students, and share findings. The ubiquitous presence of antibodies in industry and research labs ensures that students who learn antibody-related workforce-skills will be employable in nearly any locale. The project can, thus, contribute to mitigation of COVID-19 impacts on individuals who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.
