        "text": "Apparently, they are recreating the famous Dylan Newport Folk Festival concert in Cape May... and you can be in it!\n\nNew York casting agency Grant Wilfley Casting has posted a casting call looking for \"Cape May locals\" to work as extras in a feature film shooting in Cape May from May 12-16. The agency said the scenes would \"take place in 1965 at a concert.\" According to the post, the extras must be OK with wearing period-appropriate haircuts and facial hair, working around smoke and have no allergies to wool.\n\nTimoth√©e Chalamet's Bob Dylan movie plans to film in Cape May next month\n\nA casting agency needs extras in South Jersey for 'A Complete Unknown' scene depicting the 1965 Newport Folk Festival.\n\nWell, I might have if it was actually 1965... but not now.\n\nBig fan of the early pre-1965 (acoustic) Dylan, but less so as the years passed. The way he treated Joan Baez was pretty awful, there's a good documentary about his tour to England back then. The filmmaker built his own custom super 8mm movie cameras to film in intimate settings like hotel rooms.\n\nAlso a good film about that Newport concert, must have been quite an experience to be there in person."
