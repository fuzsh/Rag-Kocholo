        "text": "The history of popular music can essentially be divided into two eras: before and after Dylan. The Minnesotan raconteur born Robert Zimmerman didnât just unleash rock ânâ rollâs latent social conscience and poetic potential, he ushered in the age of the artist as auteurâthe idea that true art in music, particularly in the practice of album-making, comes from the personal expression of the artist himself. During the societal upheaval of the early â60s, he emerged as an icon thanks to inspirational singalongs like âBlowinâ in the Windâ and âThe Times They Are A-Changinâ.â But since shocking his folky faithful by going electric in 1965âa transformation heralded by his seething signature track, âLike a Rolling Stoneââheâs constantly defied expectations by pursuing his every whim, laying out a road map to creative freedom that was immediately inherited by the likes of The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, and Neil Young. That non-conformist ethos has endured long past the â60s: Dig into âSubterranean Homesick Blues,â and youâll find the seeds of punkâs sneering attitude, rapâs motor-mouthed repartee, and indie rockâs ramshackle DIY aesthetic. And yet Dylan is perpetually at the center of the conversationâan artist who's encompassed the entire American musical experience over his career, from folk and country to blues and gospel to jazz and rockâand one step removed from it. From the bad-romance wreckage of 1975âs Blood on the Tracks to the sobering meditations on mortality that permeate 1997âs Time Out of Mind to his 21st-century restorations of the Great American Songbook, heâs retained his uncanny ability to tap into the human condition while continuing to cultivate his singularly enigmatic aura."
