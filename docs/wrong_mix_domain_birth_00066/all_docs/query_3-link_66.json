        "text": "Background\n\nBob Dylan, originally known as Robert Allen Zimmerman, was born on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota. Dylan’s musical skills were noticeable from a young age. By the age of 10, Dylan was able to play the piano, harmonica, and guitar. He was a member of various bands as a kid, and his passion for music developed over time, with a particular liking for American folk music and blues. He had also been inspired by artists from the early Beat Generation as well as contemporary poets. Dylan quit college at the age of 19 and relocated to New York to pursue a music career.\n\nDylan began performing in Greenwich Village clubs and cafés. He met music producer John Hammond and secured a deal with him for his debut album — “Bob Dylan.” In the years thereafter, he has released several albums that have had a huge effect on popular music. His prolific output continued into the next decades, yielding classics such as “Oh Mercy,” “Time Out of Mind,” and “Modern Times.” Dylan’s tours drew a great deal of attention. For a while, he was accompanied by filmmaker D. A. Pennebaker, who documented life on the stage in the film “Don’t Look Back.” Dylan has released a great number of albums about many issues, such as a man’s social circumstances, religion, politics, and romance. The lyrics were initially released in new forms under the title “WritingsandDrawings,” which was then renamed “Lyrics.” He is a remarkably diverse artist who has worked as a painter, actor, and scriptwriter.\n\nAside from his prolific record output, Dylan has produced innovative material, such as the nonfiction collection of poems, “Tarantula.” His memoir — “Chronicles” — depicts his early years in New York and provides insights into his life at the center of pop culture. Dylan has regularly toured, doing nearly 3,000 gigs in the previous two decades. Dylan is regarded as a cultural icon. His impact on modern society is enormous, and he is the subject of an onslaught of literary and musical criticism."
