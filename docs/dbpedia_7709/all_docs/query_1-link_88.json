        "text": "Forget super-sleek, seamless creative spaces. When longtime friends and collaborators Aron Warner and Andrew Adamson — the team behind Oscar winner Shrek and The Chronicles of Narnia — went looking for a creative clubhouse for their own production company, Strange Weather Films, they opted for a modern take on the cozy cabin. Think knotty pine meets quilted steel, and lots of rustic materials mixed in with super high-tech touches.\n\nPHOTOS: Strange Weather Films New Silverlake Offices\n\nArchitect Michael Ferguson of Space International (who counts L.A.’s fleet of Kitson stores among his many projects) helmed the high-contrast project, which involved a complete renovation of a boxy 1960s building in Silver Lake’s Sunset Junction. Ferguson included lots of comfortable/creative spaces like the library/lounge, where wrap-around knotty pine strikes stylish tension with jumbo flat screens and disappearing glass walls. Also included in the space is a 12-seat, 3D projection theater, as well as a central video conference room with a series of glass walls that can collapse into the interior surrounding walls.\n\nPHOTOS: UTA’s New Headquarters: The Art (and Architecture) of the Deal\n\nFrom the street, the look is similarly cozy and cutting-edge, with the upper half of the structure clad in horizontal logs and the lower half covered in the structure’s original diamond-shaped brick, painted a matte black. A “rebar hedge” works as the ultimate industrial landscape, and doubles as both a visual and security screen."
