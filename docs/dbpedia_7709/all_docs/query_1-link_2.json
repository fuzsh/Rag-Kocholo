        "text": "Aron Warner, a graduate of the University of California at Los Angeles Film School, took his first step toward his career as a film producer when he accepted a job as production coordinator at Empire Pictures, where he learned the ropes working on low-budget horror and science fiction films, like \"Ghoulies\" and \"Trancers.\" From there he snagged a job at Film Finances, a completion bond company, where he worked on numerous film productions, including the David Lynch drama \"Wild at Heart\" and the crime thriller \"Men of Respect.\" He worked his way up and by 1991 landed his first producer credit with the horror movie \"Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare.\" In 1998, Warner broke from his horror movie past when he produced the animated bug-based children's feature \"Antz,\" a DreamWorks production. Warner continued working with DreamWorks on a number of films centered on their most famous character: \"Shrek.\" His role as producer on \"Shrek,\" earned him acclaim and the Oscar for Best Animated Feature in 2002. He went on to serve as producer on the next two \"Shrek\" films, before stepping up to executive producer for the Christmas television special \"Shrek the Halls\" and the fourth film of the franchise, \"Shrek Forever After.\" Notably, Warner also voiced the role of the cross-dressing Wolf in all of the \"Shrek\" films."
