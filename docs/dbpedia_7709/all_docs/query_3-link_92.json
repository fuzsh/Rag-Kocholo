        "text": "Back in 1995, a major breakthrough in computer animation occurred with the release of Toy Story, the first feature length animated film made entirely with computer generated imagery. The film proved to be such a phenomenal hit with critics and audiences that it was only inevitable the studio behind the feature, Pixar Animation Studios, would be commissioned to do another feature film of the same quality. The result was A Bug’s Life, which came out during the holiday season of 1998 to glowing reviews and huge box office receipts. While the film itself isn’t often regarded in as high esteem as Pixar’s other features, it was still an important film to show that the then small computer graphics company were capable of making great films outside of their first film.\n\nMeanwhile, another company rose a few years prior to Pixar’s Bug movie called Dreamworks Pictures. Co found by former Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, the animation studio set up for the company was done in an attempt to compete against the mouse house in producing quality animated feature films. Although the company was planning their first film to be The Prince of Egypt, a sudden public controversy sprung when it had been announced that they were working on an insect movie of their own called Antz. On top of it sounding similar to the Pixar movie, it was enough to create hostile tension between Disney and Dreamworks. It became so hostile that Dreamworks ended up moving the release date of Antz before A Bug’s Life by just one whole month. It’s safe to say that this was a moment of betrayal for the Pixar crew, though it certainly wouldn’t be the last time Dreamworks would drastically compete with them.\n\nIn the end, while both movies were well received by critics, A Bug’s Life ended up beating Antz at the box office. To this day, both movies are often compared to each other based on whichever one the public prefers over the other. Now that both films have entered their respective 25 year anniversaries, it’s time to look back and see which one holds up more compared to the other. It’s easy to see how both films can be seen as fairly similar, especially since they simultaneously center on a young male ant who struggles to win a princess’s hand by saving their society. That being said, the Dreamworks film has a much edgier tone to itself than the Pixar venture, which is more family friendly and lighthearted. While both films speak about the dangers of systemic oppression and tyrannical rule, Antz is surprisingly darker than most PG films nowadays, down to incorporating themes of genocide and war riddled brainwashing.\n\nThis isn’t to say A Bug’s Life doesn’t offer anything remotely dramatic, since it delves into the issues of royal expectation and overcoming the monsters that rule your every move. However, the Pixar film is more of a battle between different species, ants and grasshoppers, unlike Antz which is a battle between social classes amongst an entire ant colony. At a time when Pixar was beginning to reintroduce the G rating back into the mainstream crowd through genuine storytelling and well thought out characters, Dreamworks was more interested in tackling an older audience with a strong amount of teeth and edge. You can definitely tell in some sequences where the intent was to execute its themes of individualism through plot elements that incorporate war genocide and brainwashed patriotism.\n\nThat being said, for all of the laughs and cuteness to be found in A Bug’s Life, it does have a pretty frightening underbelly as far as the making of it is concerned. The entire public feud between director John Lasseter and Pixar head Steve Jobs and the aforementioned Jeffrey Katzenberg has been talked about to death, but it still represents how ruthless these conflicting people were in handling this situation. It has often been debated if the now dethroned Lasseter has still remained bitter towards Katzenberg since that incident occurred, which wouldn’t be surprising as many of the former Pixar CCO’s skeletons have been revealed to present quite the egomaniac. His resentment remains understandable regardless of whose side anyone is on, but of course leave it to the media at the time to exaggerate what could have easily been dealt with privately and rationally.\n\nI once thought to myself that the biggest contender of both these movies being deemed similar past the point of coincidence was simply for the factor of them coming out around the same time. Had Katzenberg not been pig headed for once in his life, Antz would have been released in March 1999 as opposed to October 1998 (several weeks before A Bug’s Life came out during Thanksgiving of that year). It’s clear that this decision was driven beyond the mindset of it just being business, as so much petty ego filled intent was the real culprit behind this corporate decision. Even if one were to spend hours figuring out where the origins of either film came from conceptually, the timing of their releases was the nail that poked the camel in the butt. From then on, Dreamworks and Pixar would end up in a bitter rivalry in the animation industry that lasted for many years, or at least up until both Lasseter and Katzenberg’s tenures came to an end.\n\nSpeaking of which, say whatever one will about A Bug’s Life, but the origins behind it actually sound more honest and believable than Antz’ beginnings. At least according to Bug’s Life co-director Andrew Stanton, the project was spawned out of a lunch that John Lasseter and the other main Pixar artists had in 1994 to think up of new ideas for different movies. It was then decided that Pixar’s second project after Toy Story was going to be Bugs (later renamed of course). On the other hand, Katzenberg has remained adamant that Antz originated from various spec scripts he had been presented during his tenure as the chairman of Disney Animation. The project that would eventually spawn Antz was then entitled Army Ants. While that does sound like it could be possible, it also sounds more like the same old compulsive lying common in Hollywood sob stories. Whether or not Katzenberg had been aware of A Bug’s Life or not, his decision to rival the studio when their second film was close to the release date of The Prince of Egypt could not be understated enough.\n\nNow before anyone jumps to any conclusions, this is not to knock on either film in particular. If anything, this is more of an examination into the elements that made two seemingly similar films perfect ammunition for pathetic public controversy. Instead of trying to compare and contrast one movie against the other, perhaps we should acknowledge that they were both products of elaborate corporate manipulation. Besides, it’s hard to look at either side of the coin when both the aforementioned players at hand handled it about as well as any other paranoid movie executive. It’s actually more laughable when it’s been said that Jeffrey Katzenberg allegedly believed, “Disney had a conspiracy against him…causing the Pixar head honcho to realize the larger circumstances informing Katzenberg’s decisions over at DreamWorks Animation.” (source 2).\n\nAnd the saddest reality of this pathetic controversy is that it ultimately sealed both studio’s reputations for years to come. Pixar was seen as the artistic innovator striving for original storytelling whereas Dreamworks was more so seen as the second rate competitor that relied on ripping off titles from Disney. It didn’t help that Pixar’s established reputation remained consistent for many years whereas Dreamworks fumbled a lot between making phenomenal features and low grade schlock. Nowadays, neither studio are as strong in the market as they once were due to how overly saturated it became with numerous computer animation studios jumping into the swimming pool. Perhaps the biggest stab to the gut behind this once insane rivalry almost losing all credibility was when Lasseter & Katzenberg were relieved of duty from their respective companies. The more you look into the egos of both of these men, the scarier it truly becomes.\n\nSo in addition to both films featuring the vocal talents of two infamous predators, the feud between Antz & A Bug’s Life seems to reflect more of petty selfishness and greed rather than acknowledging that two features simple feel like the same thing. Besides, the creative team behind both projects were clearly more humbled by the fun times they had on each project rather than wasting time bickering over which one was the more legitimate ant movie or not. At a time when the medium of computer generated imagery was still in its infancy, it’s admirable to see both bug movies as cultural milestones that would soon pave the way for more groundbreaking films to come. In trying to just enjoy each movie on their own terms, let’s no longer bash them for their similarities so much as we should acknowledge the behind the scenes debacle as a cautionary tale. When you spite one another as opposed to supporting each other’s accomplishments, you end up giving the industry you’re apart of a much worse name than it already has.\n\nSo in the end, while it is easy to automatically look at Antz and A Bug’s Life as mere clones of one another, their history reveals a much darker subject within the corrupt mindsets of formerly power hungry giants. After years and years of public humiliation and egotistical enabling, it’s time to put this old mindset to rest and just check each film out for what they are. If you got Peacock, make sure to check out Antz whenever you can, and also make sure to check out A Bug’s Life on Disney+. We can say they’re not the best projects from either studio, but they still remain culturally significant landmarks in an art form that was on its way to dominate the moviemaking industry. Now that we live in a more respective era of mainstream animated films, it’s time to put the dark days of PR nightmares behind us and admire the works for what they are…unless they prove to be genuine ripoffs like from Vídeo Brinquedo and friends."
