        "text": "When the original \"Star Wars\" movie debuted in theaters May 25, 1977, it revolutionized filmmaking, attracted worldwide acclaim, and launched a franchise that remains wildly popular to this day.\n\nWhen \"Empire of the Ants\" was released about a month later — 45 years ago next Wednesday, to be precise — it did none of those things. It was a campy, low-budget science fiction flick that seemed a decade or two behind the times.\n\nStill, \"Empire\" had one thing going for it that \"Star Wars\" did not: Substantial portions of the movie were filmed along the Treasure Coast. And I believe that's something we should be celebrating.\n\nFor all its cheesiness, \"Empire\" touches on themes that are familiar to present-day Floridians.\n\nThe trouble begins with an environmental disaster — a boat wantonly polluting the ocean with barrels of radioactive waste. One of the barrels washes ashore, where a group of ants start eating the silvery contents that are oozing onto the beach.\n\nI don't think I'm giving away too much of a spoiler by revealing the ants don't die, but instead mutate into giant versions of themselves equipped with high intelligence and an apparent dislike for human beings.\n\nEnter acclaimed actress Joan Collins, playing the part of an unscrupulous real estate agent who is trying to convince a diverse group of characters to buy swampland of questionable value. She organizes a tour of the remote property that can only be accessed by boat, where her well-laid plans start to unravel.\n\nBinge watching: Cooped up by coronavirus? Stream these movies with connections to the Treasure Coast\n\nFun facts: 10 interesting things you may not know about St. Lucie's county seat\n\nLocal lore: Community theater has interesting history\n\nLet's hit the pause button for a second here: Environmental disaster? Shady development plans? Potentially dangerous wildlife lurking nearby?\n\nTo me, that checks all the boxes for a classic Florida story.\n\nOf course, it all goes down the anthill from there.\n\nThe characters are thinly drawn and mostly overacted. Few, if any, of them seem likeable, which is OK, since most of them are not long for this world.\n\nCollins was still a few years away from taking arguably her most famous role, as the ruthless queen of mean Alexis Carrington Colby in the 1980s super soap opera, \"Dynasty.\" Even so, it's not hard to see similarities between Alexis and Marilyn Fryser, her character in \"Empire.\"\n\nAfter a picnic on the beach that surprisingly does not attract the ants, Fryser and her group of would-be suckers start touring the property, which leaves them vulnerable to attack.\n\nA few manage to escape through the swamp to a town with a large sugar refinery, but their troubles don't end there. For reasons that become apparent later, the townspeople aren't overly concerned about the ants or eager to help Fryser and the other survivors return home.\n\nI've probably already written enough to either whet your appetite or permanently discourage you from watching this movie. I hope its the former, because \"Empire\" is, in the vein of similar movies spoofed on \"Mystery Science Theatre 3000,\" so bad it's good.\n\nIt's hard not to laugh at special effects that are not that special, or marvel at the characters' inability to escape from enemies moving more slowly than traffic around Clover Park following a New York Mets spring training game.\n\nThen there are the local tie-ins. The boat that takes the characters on the doomed voyage departs from the Pelican Yacht Club in Fort Pierce. The property Fryser is hawking in the movie is actually the present-day location of Sailfish Point, a nice (and presumably giant ant-free) community in Stuart.\n\nSome of the one-sided fight scenes between humans and ants take place along the Loxahatchee River or elsewhere in Jonathan Dickinson State Park.\n\nThe refinery scenes were shot in the Palm Beach County community of Belle Glade, where, in real life as in the movie, human welfare seems to occasionally take a backseat to sugar production needs.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about \"Empire,\" don't expect to find much at the Elliott Museum in Stuart, the Stuart Heritage Museum, or the St. Lucie County Regional History Center in Fort Pierce.\n\nThe movie lives on mainly through the vague recollections of longtime residents who were here when the filming work was being done. Mark Perry, executive director of the Florida Oceanographic Society, is one of them, although his memories about \"Empire\" are a lot more detailed than most.\n\nPerry's father was serving as construction manager for Sailfish Point when the filming began, so Mark, then 25, was able to wrangle work on set as a production assistant.\n\nPerry did a variety of odd jobs during the filming, including retrieving the floating barrels of \"radioactive waste\" and operating animatronic giant ants.\n\n\"I got to be one of the ants who attacked Joan Collins,\" Perry said, which to me would qualify as a resume headliner.\n\nPerry said the cast and crew worked hard on the movie, although \"at the same time, the wink and the nod was there. They all knew it was going to be a bomb.\"\n\nPerry said Collins, whose moviemaking career had begun a quarter century earlier, was \"a trooper\" as she dutifully sloshed through the muck and mud with her insect tormentors in pursuit.\n\nIn her 1996 autobiography, \"Second Act,\" Collins described her experiences on the \"Empire\" set in less-than-flattering terms. She wrote that she took the role during a low ebb in her career when her family was having financial problems.\n\nShe didn't particularly care for traipsing through the Everglades — and got knocked out by a car door blown shut by the wind on the way to one of the shoots.\n\n\"I gritted my teeth and made Ants,\" Collins wrote. \"It certainly wasn't art — but in how many other jobs can you make $35,000 for six weeks' work? It was good money, which we badly needed.\"\n\nNot everyone assesses the movie as harshly as Collins did. Joel \"Captain Joel\" Kilmer, owner of Big Dog Comics in Fort Pierce, said \"Empire\" tried to revive the nostalgia of monster movies popular in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n\"It was an attempt to re-create that time,\" Kilmer said. \"They were trying to recapture that feel.\"\n\nRather than dismiss \"Empire\" as a failed experiment, I think we should lean into it and embrace its filming as a quirky but fun part of local history. It would be cool if the Treasure Coast Park and Watch in Fort Pierce, the Drive-In Movie Night at the Martin County Fairgrounds, or one of the local food truck and movie nights screened \"Empire,\" for old times' sake.\n\nWho knows? Maybe it would develop a cult following, with a new generation of fans dressing up in ant costumes and tossing sugar cubes at the screen during appropriate times in the movie.\n\nSound far-fetched? Well, maybe. But no more so than grown folk dressing up in cloaks and wielding light sabers."
