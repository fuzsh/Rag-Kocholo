        "text": "Bedrock Studios, the family-oriented production company launched last March, has inked a multi-year agreement with \"Shrek\" producers Andrew Adamson and Aron Warner. Adamson and Warner will develop and co-produce movies and franchise oriented films through their newly launched Strange Weather Films.\n\nUnder their new banner, Adamson and Warner will develop projects for Adamson to direct or produce, with Warner and Bedrock serving as co-producers. Strange Weather will be based out of Bedrock’s Santa Monica studio offices.\n\nAdamson wrote and directed \"Shrek\" and \"Shrek 2,\" and executive produced \"Shrek the Third\" and the recently released fourth installment, \"Shrek Forever After.\" Warner produced the four-picture franchise.\n\nIn addition, Adamson produced, directed and wrote the screenplays for Disney’s \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" and \"Prince Caspian,\" where he worked with Bedrock’s head, the former Walden Media CEO Cary Granat.\n\nFirst out of the gate for Bedrock will be “Turkeys,” an animated feature directed by Ash Brannon (“Toy Story 2,” “Surf’s Up”) and featuring the voices of Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson. The studio has also announced that it will dip heavily into children’s books to fill out their production slate (an area that Adamson and Warner have had great success with from their work adapting the \"Narnia\" series and William Steig’s \"Shrek\").\n\nAmong the projects the nascent studio has in the works are Robert C. O’Brien’s “The Rats of NIMH,” Madeleine L’Engle’s “A Wrinkle in Time” and William Joyce’s “Dinosaur Bob.”"
