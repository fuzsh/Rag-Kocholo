        "text": "Publication Date: Friday, September 06, 2002\n\nAn animated woman An animated woman (September 06, 2002)\n\nPatti Burke named new head of PDI/DreamWorks\n\nby Katy Chase\n\nWhen Patti Burke accepted her position last month as the new head of computer-animation powerhouse PDI/DreamWorks, she knew dealing with wacky characters was part of the job description.\n\nTry Shrek, the lime-green Scottish ogre who stole our hearts in 2001's Academy Award-winning film of the same name. Or Z, the neurotic worker ant who triumphed in 1998's \"Antz,\" the world's second computer-animated feature film.\n\nAnd there are many more characters brewing at PDI (Pacific Data Images)/DreamWorks, the Palo Alto-based computer-animation affiliate of DreamWorks SKG. Burke joins the company in the midst of rapid growth, including a move next month to a new facility in Redwood City.\n\n\"I had really looked into all the companies up here (in Northern California),\" she said, including Pixar, the Emeryville-based studio that produced the first fully computer-animated feature film, 1995's \"Toy Story.\" \"At a time when many companies were downsizing, I felt PDI/DreamWorks was really cutting-edge and would continue to grow. It seemed like a great time to be a part of the company.\"\n\nBurke takes over for Aron Warner, who produced \"Shrek.\" He is now assuming the same role for its sequel, slated for release in summer 2004.\n\n\"Patti is the ideal leader to drive PDI/DreamWorks' future, and we are thrilled to have her on board. Her extensive production and management experience are key at a time when we are expanding the company at a very rapid pace,\" said Ann Daly, head of DreamWorks' feature animation.\n\nAlthough she never interacted with PDI/DreamWorks earlier in her career, Burke said her nine-year stint as head of production for Walt Disney Imagineering's theme park productions piqued her interest in budding technology and new film formats.\n\nAt WDI she oversaw the production of several animated attractions for Disney theme parks worldwide, including \"Honey, I Shrunk the Audience\" for Disneyland and \"Buzz Lightyear\" for Disney's Magic Kingdom.\n\n\"It was a place where science and engineering met art, and there's the same dynamic between PDI and DreamWorks,\" Burke said, adding that her most exciting project at WDI was the large-format film \"Soarin\" for Disney's California Adventure theme park.\n\n\"I loved the whole dynamic of combining an aerial ride with an incredible format,\" she said of the attraction, which took two years to complete. Start with breathtaking camera work, add some smells courtesy of \"scent-o-vision\" and spray some mist in the air, and \"you really feel like you're flying over these California landmarks.\"\n\nHer position at WDI gave her the experience of building enduring works (the theme park attractions under her supervision have been in place for about 10 years), and also nurtured her interest in the developing realm of computer-generated animation.\n\n\"The theme parks really called for state-of-the-art (projects), and CG (computer generation) was just coming of age,\" Burke said. \"I saw the future and saw the possibilities of computer-generated animation. That experience brought me here.\"\n\nA native of Southern California's Manhattan Beach, Burke graduated from the film program at the University of Southern California. Prior to joining WDI, she served for 10 years as a production executive for Touchstone/Hollywood Pictures, on such films as \"V.I. Warshawski\" and \"Innocent Man.\" She began her career in live-action features, including \"Man with Two Brains\" and \"Top Gun.\"\n\nEager for a change of scenery, Burke and her husband, Glenn, relocated to Northern California in 1996 because they wanted to raise their daughter, then entering kindergarten, in the Bay Area. Burke maintained a draining commute to Burbank (one week here, one week there) until last year. She now resides in Mill Valley with Glenn and their children, an 11-year-old daughter and a 9-year-old son.\n\nBurke arrives at PDI/DreamWorks - which also produces commercials and creates visual effects for live-action feature films - just as it is outgrowing its present location at 3101 Park Blvd. It will move to a new 120,000-square-foot Redwood City facility at the end of October. The company's employees, who number about 300, are excited about the building's state-of-the-art gym, Burke said.\n\n\"Moving in a northern direction opened the talent pool for us. We wanted to be closer to (San Francisco).\" The move should help the company in its goal to hire about 100 people in the next six to 12 months.\n\n\"We're looking to add people in animation technology, physical production - across the board,\" she said.\n\nBurke, 46, plans on devoting her energy to propelling the company's steady growth. \"We used to produce one picture over a two-year time span, but we're hoping to grow to twice that in the next two or three years.\" She definitely has her work cut out for her, with three major projects slated for release within as many years.\n\nA theme park attraction based on \"Shrek\" is set to hit Universal Studios in spring 2003. The attraction, tentatively called \"Shrek 4-D,\" will feature the colorful characters having an adventure on \"a screen with another dimension added,\" Burke said, likening the experience to \"Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.\"\n\nAnother project, the CG-animation feature \"Madagascar,\" is set for release in summer 2005. The Eric Darnell-directed film follows a lion, zebra, giraffe and a hippo who are liberated from the New York Zoo by an animal rights group. The menagerie (with voices including Ben Stiller, Chris Rock and Jason Alexander) ends up stranded on the island of Madagascar en route to the African continent.\n\nAnd the \"Shrek\" sequel, of course, will be filling theaters in summer 2004, although PDI/DreamWorks remains tight-lipped about the details. The projects, Burke said, will give PDI/DreamWorks the chance to prove its mettle in the constant one-upmanship of the computer-animation world.\n\n\"Our competition is probably the best thing for us,\" Burke said, naming rivals such as Sony, Disney, Pixar, and Industrial Light + Magic. \"The more animation films there are, the more it pushes you to go the next step. If you're the only one doing it, you could get lazy,\" she said. \"The competition will continue to push us to put out the most creative picture out there.\""
