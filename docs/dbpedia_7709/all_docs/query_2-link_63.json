        "text": "When a quiet and courteous DVD executive named Kevin Tsujihara ascended to the Warner Bros. throne last year, Hollywood did not know quite what to make of him.\n\nLacking the usual show-business personality traits — screaming, scheming, showboating — and entering from the musty world of home entertainment, Mr. Tsujihara seemed awfully corporate for a business built around creativity. He had almost no experience managing movie or television show production. And yet this low-profile son of egg distributors was given the job of steering the motion picture industry’s biggest and most storied studio.\n\n“In the beginning,” said Robert A. Daly, a former Warner chairman, “there were a lot of people who asked themselves, ‘Kevin who?’ ”\n\nNobody is asking that now. Since last March, when he won a bitter succession battle to become C.E.O., Mr. Tsujihara, 49, has surprised Hollywood with bold moves that belie his nice-guy demeanor. He persuaded J.K. Rowling to expand the Harry Potter movie universe, something most people thought was a nonstarter. By hiring the flashy Fox executive responsible for “American Idol” and paying $273 million for part of Eyeworks, a Dutch entertainment company, Mr. Tsujihara moved to fix one of Warner’s most glaring weaknesses: overseas reality-TV production.\n\nHe parted ways with one film financier and instantly teamed with another, securing $450 million to make 75 movies. Earlier this month, he risked a fight with theater owners by experimenting with the simultaneous release of “Veronica Mars” in theaters and through on-demand services. And he has already duked it out — twice — with no less a force than Harvey Weinstein, who started a naming-rights battle with Warner over “The Butler” and is suing the studio over its “Hobbit” series."
