        "text": "By Sean Colleir\n\nMarch 20, 2020\n\nNew at BOP:\n\nReview: Matrix Resurrections\n\nMovie Review: Moonfall\n\nMovie Reviews: Scream\n\nThe #1 Movie in America\n\nNovember Forecast\n\nThe Many Saints of Newark\n\nOctober Forecast\n\nNew Trivia Question\n\nAll site updates\n\nShare & Save\n\nTweet\n\nPrint this column\n\nThe tale of the great feud between “Antz,” from then-nascent Dreamworks Animation, and “A Bug’s Life,” from then-young Pixar, could fill a book. Suffice to say that it’s shocking we call duplicate releases a “Volcano”/“Dante’s Peak” situation, when that feud had nothing on the 1998 war of the insects.\n\nFrom a historic perspective, however, the legacy of “Antz” is its role as the inaugural animated release from Dreamworks. While many remember the massive success of “Shrek” as the studio’s inauguration, the Smash Mouth loving ogre was actually the studio’s fifth creation. Dreamworks released “Antz” and “Prince of Egypt” in 1998, then big-time flop “The Road to El Dorado” and Aardman co-production “Chicken Run” in 2000 — all of which predated the 2001 appearance of Shrek and Donkey.\n\n“Antz,” while not a towering success — it finished 21st overall for the year with a total of $90.7 million — was enough of a hit to give the fledgling studio some footing. As the second computer-animated feature overall (after “Toy Story”) to hit theaters, “Antz” turned a sufficient quantity of heads.\n\nThose heads witnessed a bizarre, tonally dissonant mess of a movie. Apparently we were willing to overlook such issues 22 years ago.\n\nThe team behind “Antz” sought to corner a slightly older market than the crowds that flocked to “Toy Story,” adding enough mild profanity, violence and grown-up references to draw in teens and adults. That’s the only conceivable explanation for casting a deadpan Woody Allen as Z, the protagonist, or for having various insects toss out a stray “damn” or “hell.”\n\nThere’s not explanation whatsoever for a number of bizarre and, frankly, nightmarish sequences. A passing wasp is squished flat by a fly swatter. There’s an implication of sexual violence. After a surprisingly graphic battle sequence, Z has a conversation with a dying comrade — or, rather, the decapitated head of a dying comrade, lying alone on the corpse-strewn battlefield.\n\nThis was a family movie. It received a PG rating.\n\nAdvertisement"
