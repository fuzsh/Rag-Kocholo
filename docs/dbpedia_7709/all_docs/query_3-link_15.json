        "text": "A combination of Toy Story and Honey I Shrunk the Kids, Antz storms theaters on Friday. The combined creative talent of Dreamworks Pictures and Pacific Data Images have rendered a full-screen animated drama that takes place, for the most part, six feet underground.\n\nDrawing on its history of creating graphics for commercials and TV broadcasts, the PDI team of animators showcases the latest in computer-generated technologies, bringing characters to life and creating scenes that a film crew would be hard-pressed to duplicate.\n\nUsing a bevy of Silicon Graphics O2 machines, 27 PDI animators became directors, actors, and set designers for the 18 months they were in production on Antz. Unencumbered by wardrobe, actors, sets, or prop challenges, the creators faced a limitless opportunity to innovate, add, and change the images.\n\n\"You become a decision-making machine,\" said co-director Tim Johnson. \"Every pixel in every scene has been placed there. The little things we ask for, like a little pile of rocks, could take weeks of someone's life.\" And, because the movie is being created in digital files and not shot on film, ideas can be implemented at any stage in production, which can be either a creative boon or a perfectionist's nightmare.\n\n\"It's really easy to get hypercritical, because you can change everything,\" said producer Brad Lewis, who orchestrated the efforts of animators, lighting experts, writers, and sound people into one cohesive whole.\n\nSophisticated software for simulating a crowd made it possible for the directors to include three times as many wide-angle shots of the ant-colony interior than were originally planned. PDI animators broke new ground with water-simulation techniques, depicting an underground flood, condensation on a bottle, and an ant's ride in a raindrop. All without blowing the budget.\n\nFollowing the adage that \"Films are never finished, they're only abandoned,\" the team at PDI managed to detach and end their work on Antz months ahead of schedule. The original release date was planned for spring 1999.\n\nThe coup de grâce was in the characters themselves. PDI drew on its experience in broadcast television -- ranging from the Entertainment Tonight lead-in to The Simpson's episode where Homer goes 3-D -- and gave the ants complex expressions and behaviors.\n\nIt was no picnic. After creating hundreds of sketches of each character, PDI artists modeled them in clay and shipped them to Utah-based Viewpoint Data Labs to be digitized or turned into 3-D figures that could be manipulated.\n\nHere is where any similarity between production on Antz and other feature-length 3-D computer animated movies, like Toy Story or James and the Giant Peach, ceases. PDI has developed tools that allow for precise control and positioning of each body part and facial movement, programming them into controls that help animators render complex behaviors without having to memorize facial musculature.\n\nPDI programmers created a library of hundreds of controls that define movements of the mouth and eyes, as well as each joint in the body or, in this case, thorax. Using these controls, animators can dial up a setting to get the desired action: raising an arm or smiling, and combine controls to get a wider range of emotional responses than most 2-D or 3-D animation has tried for so far.\n\n\"We can do as many expressions as you can see on your own face,\" said Rex Grignon, who oversaw animation for the Gene Hackman character, General Mandible. Animators worked end-to-end on sequences of the film, using their own faces and videos of the actors to pattern their characters' responses and holding group review sessions to make sure each person was endowing their characters with the same movements and expressions.\n\n\"We had to maintain a consistent look and feel,\" said Raman Hui, another supervising animator at PDI. \"Sometimes we'd look at how a character reacted to something in one sequence, and it wasn't the same as in another part of the film.\"\n\nCombining controls gave characters complex expressions like an embarrassed smile, a perplexed frown, or a sneering lip curl, Hui said. Close attention to body language meant that non-verbal communications, like Princess Bala's rebuffing of General Mandible, had punch.\n\nAntz is PDI's first movie. Started in 1980 with a few creative types and a VAX machine, the company has grown to a staff of over 260. It partnered with Dreamworks in early 1996, which allowed the company to more than double its staff for production of Antz. Executive Producer Carl Rosendahl said it won't stop there.\n\nPDI has developed its technology and expertise on this film for future ones. Already it can generate furry animals, and Rosendahl figures in another two years his animators will be able to simulate realistic humans.\n\nCurrently, producing a digital film costs roughly the same, or slightly less, than producing a two-dimensional, animated one. But having digital movies may eventually offer filmmakers a huge savings in the cost of distribution. Printing PDI's digital files onto film cost the company $7,000 to $10,000.\n\nFiguring a moderate run at 5,000 theaters, the cost of distributing a film-based movie is around $10 million. Distributing digital movies is something Rosendahl would like to look into, \"as soon as the projection technology is crisp and bright enough and the economics work,\" he said."
