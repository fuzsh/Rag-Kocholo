They start to talk, to gossip or complain, and soon that turns into stories; we have to do that much, or sit there in silence. The narratives that spring up want to be unique and personal, but they are leaves from one tree. There are only a few stories if we regard them as shapes made out of possibility, rites of fear and desire. This condition lasted mankind from the cave to the cabin, but then story itself took ﬂight. A few families broke into the business of enacting those stories for strangers—audiences who might be far away, but the new technology reached them. The stories existed as coiled celluloid, waiting to be freed by light. This one family, the Warners, helped create that business and left us believing that their stories were our fables and dreams, and not just their money and their made-up name. This book is called Warner Bros, but if anyone asks, you’re going to say you’re reading “Warner Brothers.” You don’t quite\n\n1\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nknow how to say “Warner Bros.” That logo seems awkward or compacted in the mouth. This is not a trivial distinction between sound and print, family and business identity. They didn’t call themselves Paramount or Universal or Columbia, names from out of the clouds. No, they said theirs was a family show, just the brothers, one for all and all for one. There really were four Warner brothers, and if Albert was a sleeping or sleepy partner, Harry, Sam, and Jack are genuine characters. Sam takes an early hit for the team, and that makes him a beloved hero, but Harry and Jack carry the load of lifelong rivalry, like Karamazov brothers, vectors to build a story arc on. They fall into unthinking opposition. Why do we have siblings? they wonder—So there’s someone close to us who is not us? Jack wins this fraternal struggle—you’ll guess that early on, so no suspense is spoiled. But so many of his victories feel like defeats, too, because of his suspect character. He’s known as a rascal now, while Harry seems upright and duty-bound. Harry could read and write in Hebrew, while Jack struggled with English. But it’s too late to take sides: Harry may have been more honest, but he was dull, too; and if Jack was shifty, that was why you shouldn’t take your eyes off him. The two of them seem always at odds, which leaves victorious Jack as maybe the biggest scumbag ever to get into a Jewish Lives series. I realize “scumbag” is startling: it doesn’t sound judicious; and it may be disconcerting to have a Jewish Life that isn’t admirable, or couched in integrity. Einstein, Freud, Proust, Primo Levi, Kafka, Emma Goldman . . . Jack Warner? But this subject is more important than respectability. I said “scumbag” for a couple of reasons—Jack is something other than a nobleman; but “scumbag” is a familiar term in the movie business, where it carries more affection than if it were being bandied about in insurance or undertaking. Hollywood, you see, is fond of its rascals, rather in the way we relish its vil2\n\nan intr oduc tion\n\nlains or tough guys on screen when they are people we would be scared to meet. And that hints at the complicated inﬂuence the Warner brothers had, and are still having, on us. Here’s a question to illustrate that: which means the most to the most people, or to you: the Special Theory of Relativity, Freud’s The Interpretation of Dreams, or Jimmy Cagney pushing a grapefruit in Mae Clarke’s face? I cannot tell you Jack was a hero, or that many who knew him made that claim on his behalf. But being less than Einstein, Proust, or even Barbra Streisand didn’t stop Jack and Warner Bros from having an impact on our culture and dreams, on us, that is alarming because it’s enormous. Warner Bros was one of the enterprises that helped us see there might be an American dream out there, a mix of patriotism and publicity, and it was open to Poles, Hispanics, the British and Chinese, whomever, as much as to the few Americans who had been here from the start. Even women might get it. That sense of a dream and immigrants—enormous, impersonal, climatic forces—is not easily worked out because we are still so attached to the hope that ﬁne and talented people shape our history. Or very bad people? Don’t rule this out as simple heresy, but America might have been happier without the pursuit of happiness. Once upon a time, nearly everyone lived in his or her small, ﬁxed place. You could not get away, so you hardly felt the need— you were contained in the power of heaven and hell, or some such script. Then transport shook us up. It began as railways, steamships, and automobiles, as well as money. It has gone on by way of the telephone and radio to our modern capacity or fantasy for being anywhere. But this transition has been a convulsion; it has driven people crazy and it means we lost godliness, as well as home. This was happening all over the world, but in the United States the throb of ﬁction or future becoming was a frenzy as, in the last decades of the nineteenth century, millions of strang3\n\nwar ner b ros\n\ners came to the country and complicated its old New England ideals. That immigrant anxiety, over feeling freed yet lost, has never gone away, but in America a mass medium was set up, for fun but as a version of moral guidance and comfort: the stories told people how to live, or what to believe in—stay a family, they sometimes urged. But the technology was dynamic and disruptive, too: it catered to loneliness, instability, and escape and said such things were as natural as home and allegiance. The messages strove to be wholesome, and conservative, but families like the Warners had escaped, so they loved the dangerous energy that needed. The contradictions were riotous—for example, crime does not pay, they said, but get ready to enjoy these hoodlums of ours! And in that process these men represented all immigrants. They were storytellers who dramatized the vitality of instability and transformation. They were the actors who played the role of strangers in the land. And, don’t forget, some “true” Americans still look upon immigrants with suspicion and fear. Another point of the title, Warner Bros, is to say that this genius is collective as well as individual, and that is a challenging theory in both ﬁlm history and the progress of artistic appreciation. You can take a ﬁlm like Casablanca and ask, who made it? If Casablanca ends up being taught at Cornell or a junior college for credit and tenure, then it helps to pin it on an author. But maybe so many people made the picture that no one deserves the credit—perhaps we did it. Criticism and tenure are alike in needing heroes. There are important (and self-important) individuals in this book— not just Jack Warner but Darryl Zanuck, James Cagney, Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, Howard Hawks . . . Bugs Bunny— and there will be times when their talent and their choices stand out from the body of the institution. But this is also a book in which general weather systems—like sound, a factory system\n\n4\n\nan intr oduc tion\n\nfor storytelling, business, rivalry, the sounds of song and gunﬁre, and the shufﬂing off of responsibility—take priority. The thing called “audience” may be the most profound and mysterious of those forces. “Audience” is a lovely and beguiling idea, and sometimes it is enough to scatter those darker versions of the same principle—the public, the crowd, the mass, the others. One of the essential areas of intrigue in going to the movies, of sitting in the dark with strangers, was feeling the show was just for you—yet guessing you didn’t matter. Because the bright life on the screen didn’t know or care if you existed. So long as you paid your nickel, or your $16. In coming to this task, it feels proper to raise a question, or an eyebrow, at the mention of Harry, Abe, Sam—and Jack? Even the shvontz—the prick? Are we sure of where we’re going with these Warner boys? What do we expect of a Jewish Life? Surely the publishing test isn’t based on the mere existence of anyone who happened to be Jewish? I doubt the editors of this series would proceed to print a full account of what might be plain or empty lives—say, Isaac of Prague (1171–1262), or Hirsch Wonsal (1781–1858), the one a tailor, the other a shoemaker, lacking not just English, but American, too, dots in that unstable eastern part of Europe, buffeted or chased by ﬁerce ethnic disputes in which they had no say and so little record that a “Life” is beyond telling. Those two names—Isaac and Hirsch are both invented— could be signiﬁers for lives that left hardly a trace of evidence and which we may assume to have been commonplace (dull?), subject to passing happiness and terror, but resigned to history having no reason to remember or identify their small “hill of beans.” These were not prophets, scholars, creative artists, or leaders—if they had genius, it went unnoticed (and that can happen—must everything hang on the test of success or fame?). It is the pattern of history and the tradition of our evolutionary\n\n5\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nculture that many lives are not much attended to—except by the Lord, or Yahweh. Unless those overseers are just ﬁgures in storytelling. But Warner Bros movies were for all of us. Yiddish theatre might be for the Jews, but the movies were for everyone. You didn’t have to be Orthodox or saved to buy your ticket. And these brothers longed to transcend Jewishness, and the traditions that they thought made them vulnerable in America. There was a movie made in 1947, Gentleman’s Agreement.1 It was not from Warners, and it is not well remembered now. Nevertheless, it won the Best Picture Oscar for 1947, and was once reckoned to be on a cutting edge because it exposed antisemitism. It is a story in which a sincere journalist (played by Gregory Peck) pretends to be Jewish to report on that cultural hostility. The ﬁlm has dated (a smaller ﬁlm, same year, similar theme, Crossﬁre, is superior). But in 1947 someone organized a gathering of Hollywood elders to impress upon Darryl Zanuck (the ﬁlm’s producer) that it was ill-advised and unduly provocative to stir up this issue. The instigator of that meeting was Jack Warner, who preferred to make Jewishness go away as a brand image. Zanuck was not Jewish, and he is essential to the Warners story. He was of Swiss, Protestant descent (he said), born in Wahoo, Nebraska. His father was a hotel clerk who claimed the principles of Episcopalianism, while being a drunk and a gambler who neglected his son. A stepfather came along later, an accountant and another drunk who carried a Bible for quoting from. But Darryl discarded these parents to spend his working life with people who were Jewish, and it was often said that he topped them all in behaving as if Jewish, or the way a movie mogul was expected to behave. In 1967, when Zanuck was once more in charge of Twentieth Century–Fox, John Gregory Dunne went to interview him\n\n6\n\nan intr oduc tion\n\nin his New York ofﬁce. He found what he wanted—a tough character, a onetime scenarist, talking splashy dialogue: “I’m so goddamn sick of being written about. What the hell am I going to say about myself that I haven’t said before?” groaned Zanuck.2 It’s a tyrant’s lament that would ﬁt most of our demon moguls, from Louis B. Mayer to . . . Donald Trump. As studio president in New York, Zanuck was in daily contact with his son Richard, the man he had appointed head of production in Los Angeles, and the kid Darryl had always beaten at checkers, croquet, or any other game anyone could think of: “I was put under terriﬁc criticism when I sent Dick out to head up the studio. What could I do? He was the only one I could trust. . . . Well, when I took over, I cleaned house. I knew things were bad, but not that bad. I paid off millions of dollars in contracts and threw out every goddamn script we had in preparation. They were all lousy. And then I sent Dick out there. I let him alone.”3 Trust the rhythm of the paranoia and its assertion more than what is claimed; listen to the act. For all his house-cleaning, Darryl Zanuck had kept the studio attached to Doctor Dolittle, Star!, and Tora! Tora! Tora!, and when those ﬁlms ﬂopped, three in a row, he had to ﬁre someone—so he ﬁred Dick. Beware of family. For a man of ﬁve feet six, Zanuck had always cast a big shadow. He revered his wife and his kids, but got into the early habit of sex with young actresses. He believed in himself, his instincts, his will, and his luck. His mouth clenched a cigar while ﬁring off indefatigable show business lines full of panache. These were wisecrack howlers like the infamous remarks of Sam Goldwyn. Zanuck was at a preview once, at Warners, in the early thirties, with the ﬁlm’s director, Michael Curtiz. Zanuck was in charge of production at Warners then. He felt there was something wrong with this picture they were watching. He\n\n7\n\nwar ner b ros\n\ntried to spell out what it was, and the anxious Curtiz leaped in with “Wonderful! Darryl! Yes! Yes!” Whereupon Zanuck glared at his unquenchable yes man, and said, “For Christ’s sake, don’t say yes until I ﬁnish talking!”4 Was that Jewish—or simply the kind of sizzling line that a boss might utter in a Hollywood picture (especially one directed by Michael Curtiz)? It’s a laugh line; it’s an assertion of authority, and it’s memorable—it illustrates a way of talking in life that owes a lot to sound pictures. The line rides along with “You ain’t heard nothin’ yet!” from The Jazz Singer (for which Zanuck won an honorary Oscar as its controlling mastermind). Everyone agreed with Darryl Zanuck that he was not Jewish—and people didn’t expect to win arguments with him. But how many people did you ever hear of who were called “Zanuck,” and might have come from Switzerland? Is Zanuck a Swiss name, or is it just the most punchy, catchy handle in the picture business? Darryl was blue-eyed and fair-haired; he was from out of Nebraska. According to Orson Welles, he was also “by all odds the best and brightest of the big studio bosses.”5 In passing, recollect that Orson Welles sometimes wondered whether both his parents were the advertised article—as in straight Americans; as an orphan, he was signiﬁcantly raised by a Jewish guardian; he did wonder whether his mother had known a dashing Jewish actor; and he was inclined to rave about the glories of Yiddish literature and theatre—“It was the only international theatre in history. Movies are the second.”6 This alchemy is crucial in the transactions by which strangers become Americans when the rest of the world regards the United States as a reckless, slightly disturbed, but beckoning mélange of so many races and nationalities that have not really had time or boredom to be American yet. The cultural importance of the movies was in presenting a persuasive model for style and authenticity, and no group had more to do with that than the Jews who established the picture business. Maybe liv8\n\nan intr oduc tion\n\ning creatures as diverse as Cary Grant and Rin Tin Tin found themselves as American role models. Grant, who had grown up as Archie Leach in Bristol, England, with a father named Elias, believed he might be “partly” Jewish. The great Rinty (America’s favorite canine) was actually a French German shepherd puppy, found by an American soldier in the village of Flirey in Lorraine in September 1918. That dog soon became a hero in Warner Brothers ﬁlms, some of them written by Darryl Zanuck. For much of his life, Charlie Chaplin ﬂirted with the thought that he could have been Jewish.7 The American movie is a lever in the reinvention of the self—and its eternal discontent with ﬁxed reality. This spreading confusion of identities is a measure of collapsing times. We’ll see, because the process continues. But in the Warner Brothers we face an attempt—organic but crazy, yearning yet hardly planned—by early-twentieth-century Jews to be American. That’s how Zanuck—ten years his junior—had such an inﬂuence on Jack Warner. And whereas Harry, Albert, and Sam were escaped from eastern Europe, their kid brother, Jack, was show business or North American. That’s not to attack Jack, or to excuse him, but it’s surely relevant that these Warner brothers lived at a moment when the world was suddenly aroused by the question of what it meant to be Jewish. In so many respects, the substance of spiritual belief was disappearing in the West. But at the same time a new urge to tell stories arose—stories that were parables on community and individualism, success and responsibility. The thing Orson Welles noted—the way in which Yiddish storytelling produced and was then supplanted by the movies—meant that in a culture abandoning religion, myths were made fresh and accessible to the ragbag of Americans. Those stories taught immigrants English—and a thought of being American. John Ford’s The Searchers (1956) is clearly a Western, with American archetypes who happen to be caught up in racial con9\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nfusion with Native American characters. Still, the brothers in the ﬁlm are named Aaron and Ethan, American names that do not always hear how Jewish they are (and these brothers loved the same woman, Martha—it is her daughter who is kidnapped, thus prompting the search).8 For generations, children were named after lives from the Bible, as if that gave a kid roots, moral identity, and a basis for behaving. Modern American lives do not know the Bible in the same way—I don’t think the average viewer of The Searchers in 2017 hears the biblical resonance. But such echoes linger because some model for family existence remains from biblical structures in which brothers might be so bound together in contest that sometimes one may have to murder the other. Harold Pinter’s The Homecoming (1965)—to pick another Jewish artist—is a piece of sinister, allegorical stagecraft, about a family’s struggle for power. It plays as an abstract noir fable of north London life, in which sibling rivalry never sleeps. A prized son, Teddy (learned but childlike), returns (from America), with his prized wife (Ruth), only to realize that his supposedly lesser family members are still wolves waiting for him to falter. They are his father Max; an uncle, Sam; and Teddy’s two brothers, Lenny and Joey. Ruth becomes the all-purpose anima for the family. The father and her brothers-in-law ﬁrst try to co-opt her as their whore, but that shows her the power she could have in a home where the men lack women. She will stay in London like a queen, a madam, and a mother, while the defeated Teddy goes back to America. The Searchers and The Homecoming may not seem to come from the same cultural source. But their secret kinship and their obsession with family rivalry speak to the inﬂuence of Jewish storytelling—and Pinter loved movies. So Teddy comes home to be eclipsed. But Ethan (even as personiﬁed by John Wayne) goes on an immense quest in which we fear he may kill his deﬁled niece if he ever ﬁnds her—a relationship all the more 10\n\nan intr oduc tion\n\nfraught if he might be her father (which surely he wanted to be). When Ethan accepts Debbie and brings her “home,” he turns away at the threshold and walks back into the desert, without existence. He has erased himself. It was a Warner Brothers movie. In 1988, Neal Gabler published a notable book, An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood, which described how a group of Jews had made what we call the American movie business. This reading was valid and useful, though it failed to explore how fully the American public had acclaimed and digested Hollywood, and whether or not the moguls understood that or were really in charge of the process. Neither the business nor the imaginative enterprise was simply “an empire of their own.” Instead, it was an uneasy kingdom in which Jewish moguls were often in fear of exposure and attack. And they did not have to be Jewish. The character of Hollywood and of Warners owed so much to Darryl Zanuck, and the list of vital non-Jews begins with D. W. Grifﬁth, Cecil B. DeMille, Mary Pickford and Lillian Gish, Walt Disney, John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock— and even Chaplin, or Jock Whitney. Jock (or John Hay) Whitney was maybe the most famous WASP in America in 1939, and one of the richest. But David Selznick could not have made Gone With the Wind without Jock. That worked because a part of Whitney wanted to shed his worthy heritage, wanted to adventure, meet movie stars (actresses especially), and play with being an outsider. Yes, there were many Jews in Hollywood (but the business was never all Jews) and they were powerful for a time, enough to feel a new version of being “chosen.” The lasting power rested in what the uncontrolled and un-understood technology was doing to American hope. Along the way to power and their sometimes lurid splendor, these moguls compromised many of 11\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nthe hallowed meanings of Jewish life beginning around, say, 1900. That’s how Harry Warner would be ashamed of his young brother Jack. The “empire” was less a dynasty than an escape struggling to regain or reinvent home. These immigrants were American now, but “home” was up for redesign. The country is still torn over the battle to decide whose story it will be.\n\n12\n\n2 The Greatest Moment?\n\nIt’s no secret: Casablanca is the most celebrated movie made by Warners, and one of the most cherished ever created in Hollywood. Not that the ordinary fans necessarily identiﬁed a picture with its studio. The ownership credit on a movie is usually one of the least noticed bits of information. As an audience, we like to think a picture belongs to us. In 1943, that spirit rejoiced, along with the gamblers who ran Warners, that Allied forces had occupied the real Casablanca (in Morocco) just weeks before the movie opened. That emphatic yet romantic title seemed vindicated by the news. Wouldn’t we always have “Casablanca”? There were maps of North Africa on newspaper front pages to settle widespread ignorance as to where the city was. In addition, as one screenwriter put it, in January 1942, the ﬁlm vouched for “the idea that when people lose faith in their ideals, they are beaten before they begin to ﬁght.”1 This was a respectable message, lofty\n\n13\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nbut vague, but one that made us feel good about ourselves in 1943, when feeling good came more easily than it does now. Here was a movie about success and togetherness, those essential Hollywood convictions. That appealed to the brothers named Warner, as it did to the immigrant generation that had founded the picture business and who assumed that their own social transformation was a principle that could be sold to millions (if not exactly shared with them). When Casablanca won its Best Picture Oscar, the man who felt he deserved to collect the statuette was the ﬁlm’s producer and chief manager, Hal B. (for Brent) Wallis. If anyone had run the whole show of that picture, and kept its untidiness under control, it was Wallis. Even if it had not always been under control, Wallis was the leader who smothered the doubts.2 He had been born in Chicago in 1898, the son of Ashkenazi Jews from Suwalki in Poland, who had named him Aaron Blum Wolowicz, before they changed the family name to Wallis. Hal had joined Warners in 1923, doing publicity in a lowly position, and had risen gradually to be head of production. That was how the business could work. By 1939, he had won the Irving G. Thalberg Award for production excellence, because he was— or seemed to be—in charge of one of the most impressive lists of movies ever created in Hollywood. In the 1930s and early forties, Warners had had nineteen ﬁlms nominated for Best Picture—and they had actually won that Oscar once, for The Life of Emile Zola, which was as much a gloss on the history of ideas as Casablanca was a slick version of war studies. But that Oscars night in 1943, Wallis was beaten to the Academy stage by his own boss, Jack Warner, a man famous for speed, opportunism, ego, and the rueful jokes told by those who worked under him and endured his constant appetite for attention and audience response. As Hal was going towards the stage, Jack leaped forward to take the statuette himself. “Jack L. Warner” was meant to sound like a reliable American name (he 14\n\nthe greatest moment?\n\nadopted it in his brief vaudeville career, when middle initials had a rhythmic kick like the ﬂourish on a snare drum). But he was born Jacob to Jews from Congress Poland (the Russian end of that unhappy country), his father either Wonsal or Wonskolasor at his own birth. Jacob had been born in London, Ontario, in 1892, as his family moved around seeking a home in the New World. Casablanca had been directed by Michael Curtiz, born in Budapest in 1886 as Mano Kaminer, who then became Mihaly Kertesz as he made his way in the European ﬁlm business. Under any name he was Jewish.3 He arrived in America in 1926, settled on an American name, and, thanks to a shared passion for polo, formed a friendship with Hal Wallis. It’s a pretty prospect to think of these two ex-Europeans, tanned and pristine, on polo ponies. Curtiz was something of a joke at Warners, infamous for his aloof manner, his arrogance, his skill at moving the camera, and his broken English. As he often admitted (and as his bosses complained), he was more concerned with cinematic style than with character, plot, or dialogue—yet Casablanca is not simply a fast, elegant romantic thriller made for a moment in history; it is full of characters and lines we remember. Along the way, Curtiz directed a bunch of admirable American movies, nearly all at Warners—20,000 Years in Sing Sing (Spencer Tracy and Bette Davis), Mystery of the Wax Museum (a horror ﬁlm), Captain Blood and The Adventures of Robin Hood (both with Errol Flynn), Angels with Dirty Faces (Cagney and Bogart), The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (Davis and Flynn), Casablanca, Yankee Doodle Dandy (where Cagney won his Oscar playing impresario George M. Cohan), Mildred Pierce (the noir romance in which Joan Crawford got her Oscar), Life with Father (a family movie and a great hit, starring William Powell). Even this selected list of pictures suggests that Curtiz’s greatest characteristic was versatility, or the ability to do what15\n\nwar ner b ros\n\never the studio required with the same brisk ﬂourish and an expertise in never being boring. Yet no one knew what a Curtiz picture was, and in the culture of critics who wish to celebrate the movie director, and call him an auteur, Curtiz is a problem. His record is prodigious, but impersonal, so it reﬂects strangely on directorial signature. Curtiz directed most of Casablanca—except for bits here and there, like the montage sequence that establishes the city as a place and mood, which was actually assembled by Don Siegel because he had the speed, the zip, and the skill to do all the studio montages.4 Warners favored those snappy montages as much as any studio (though you can see the same spirit at work in the obituary sequence in Citizen Kane), because they established a story in a few seconds and let the public feel that the news and history were under control. But the writing of a movie was another matter, even if screenwriting at Warners was intended to convey a similar sense of authority in which doubt had been chased away. A lot of the time on Casablanca the studio and its workers hardly knew where the picture was going, but they knew that uncertainty must never show. Four men played signiﬁcant parts in the writing, and maybe forty were asked to take a shot at certain scenes. In the crises of ﬁlmmaking, emergency writers may be called in to do scenes or doctor those already written. An individual writer may have no idea of the confusion or treachery in which he is working—it helps not to know. So Julius Epstein, who cowrote with his twin brother, Philip, asserted that Casey Robinson had never written a draft, and while Howard Koch did about thirty pages, Epstein said they were bad and never used. Yet Robinson claimed that he had recommended the play Everybody Comes to Rick’s (even though his account of the play is inaccurate). He also said he had clariﬁed, or “punched up,” the love story. And he was the creator of the ending (put off for so\n\n16\n\nthe greatest moment?\n\nlong), while admitting that Hal Wallis himself wrote that last line, as Rick and Renault stroll off into the fog, “Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.”5 It’s impossible to get the history straight, and that may be because the rivalrous authors themselves never knew exactly what had happened—and wouldn’t have remembered it if they had. Wallis employed a lot of writers, to get talent, and to keep it insecure. And here we are into the willful chaos of Warner Brothers—and all the other movie studios. Someone like Hal Wallis had to drag the broken pieces together and turn them into what Julius Epstein called “Slick shit.”6 Julius offered that verdict in an interview decades later on a picture for which he and his brother had shared the adapted screenplay Oscar with Howard Koch. No, he said, “Slick shit” didn’t mean he hated or despised Casablanca. But he had no illusions. There wasn’t a jot of reality in the whole picture, if reality was what had actually transpired in North Africa during the war. The movie was a fantasy cobbled together that happened to work. What else was a sane writer with self-respect to say about the process? Epstein was a sardonic wit, very good at a job he seldom thought respectable. So he talked about it as a hooker might discuss her johns—amused, forgetful, fatalistic, and with a touch of superior disdain. That jaunty toughness is very Warner Brothers, and it’s a voice we can follow over the years. Screenwriters trained themselves not to take their own pages or hopes too seriously because they could be trashed, abandoned, or lost. “Slick shit” was a wry defensive attitude, and it’s not so far from the way Rick oversees the customers and the losers at his café. I’m sure Casey Robinson had a useful hand in Casablanca, but he never got a credit—and who knows the arrangements that went into that denial? So the script was attributed to the Epstein brothers and Howard Koch. If only the ﬁlm had failed,\n\n17\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nthere might have been just a single credit. Writers dodge ﬂops and make a crowded elevator if the picture is going up in the world. But when interviewed by Patrick McGilligan, Julius Epstein was asked where his wry humor—heard especially in the cheerful cynicism of Captain Renault (Claude Rains)—had come from. He replied, with a laugh: “From being Jewish.” McGilligan asked him to elaborate and Epstein replied, “Who knows? I have no explanation for it.” He refers to two books by Steve Allen, Funny People and More Funny People, and he says, “His only explanation is that it must come in the genes, because the only way the Jews could last all the years is by laughing at it. . . . You know what Lenny Bruce said? Everybody on the two coasts, by which he meant New York and Los Angeles, is Jewish. Everyone in between is gentile. In other words, he meant if you’re in show business or if you think alike you’re Jewish.”7 No one forgets who acted in Casablanca. Those dead faces are still alive—was that always the deepest reason why people wanted to be in movies? There are folklore tales about all the actors considered for every part, but that was standard procedure on most projects in the studio system. If you had players under long-term contract, then you had to use them or play with the prospects of using them. Casting was a version of the other game in which a mogul might survey the pretty young women under contract before deciding which one to call to his ofﬁce at 4 p.m. So yes, there was a story in January 1942, just weeks after Warners had bought the rights to the play, that Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan would star in Casablanca. But in the ﬁrst reader’s report on the play, in mid-December 1941, days after Pearl Harbor, there had been this recommendation: “A boxofﬁce natural—for Bogart, or Cagney, or Raft in out-ofthe-usual roles, and perhaps Mary Astor.”8 18\n\nthe greatest moment?\n\nCasting a movie requires exhilarated indecision, always on the brink of panic—after all, it’s Friday and by Monday morning someone has to be there as Rick or Ilsa. Once that’s accomplished, the movie can appear as sublime providence. Who else could it have been? Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are the two people now. Yet it might have been George Raft and Michele Morgan, for one moment at least. Then everyone would know who Michele Morgan was—she died in December 2016. Hal Wallis always had Bogart in mind, but Ilsa was up in the air. She could have been French, English, or American. Come to that, Wallis had a passing urge to turn Sam, the piano player, into a woman, and he thought of Lena Horne in the part.9 To learn that is to waver over fate, and to feel indignant on behalf of Dooley Wilson—but Lena Horne had her grievances with Hollywood, too. (And that song, “As Time Goes By,” means something a little different if you have any hint that Rick might have been “seeing” a young singer who looked and sounded like Horne. Rick joins the noble cause in Casablanca, but could he have had sex with a woman of color? Just how liberal was Warner Brothers in 1943?) I share these stories (and the speculation that wraps them) just to stress a mystery in all movies: how a ﬂoating role can become iconic in half a day’s shooting. So actors had every reason to feel insecure: Bogart had as healthy and sarcastic a dislike of Jack Warner as anyone on the lot. But a big element in the charm of Casablanca is that underlying air of comradeship, and of an international cast coming together at a moment when everyone was appreciating how the war was turning strangers into allies. If you run through the cast of aliens for this very American ﬁlm, you realize that Bogart and Dooley Wilson were the only Americans with sizable roles. Ingrid Bergman was Swedish; Claude Rains and Sydney Greenstreet were English; Paul Henreid was Austrian, and nearly an aristocrat. It’s another part of the airy kindness in 19\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nCasablanca that Henreid’s Victor Laszlo is said to have been in a concentration camp for a year before the picture opens. To be sure, he has an elegant scar on his brow as “proof ” of that experience. But Henreid is handsome, groomed, dentally secure, and possessor of an unshakable conﬁdence, as beﬁts an actor on the rise in a good role in what felt like a hit. Laszlo says he was tortured in the camp when he looks like an actor on the edge of becoming a romantic lead. That’s part of a sweetness in the ﬁlm that belies every allegation that its world faced horriﬁc crisis. Better proof of that is Laszlo’s enemy, Major Strasser, as embodied by the German actor Conrad Veidt. I admit a secret fondness for Strasser, but I think you do, too. Yes, he’s a bad man, the Nazi incarnate, imperious but riding for a fall, and probably far worse than the movie has time to show. On the other hand, on our screen’s surface, he is polite, urbane, witty even, and well-spoken. And as handsome as Conrad Veidt. We are meant to be afraid of him, but that never quite works for me because this whole gathering of actors becomes a club, inspired by the slick shit they are putting together. They are like the “usual suspects” referred to in Renault’s famous line about police procedure. You can argue that in 1942 not too many people had an adequate idea of what a Nazi ofﬁcer might be like. But the bond in the cast is also a Hollywood attitude: that this is a war movie a child or a childish person could see without damage or undue fear. It happens that, despite an appearance that could easily seem sinister, Veidt was a good or decent man, liked by anyone he worked with. Born in Berlin in 1893, he had been a leading actor in German cinema: he is the somnambulist in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and the man whose face has been disﬁgured into an endless smile in The Man Who Laughs. He quit Germany when the Nazis came to power, because his third wife was Jewish. He had gone to England and starred in The Spy in Black and The Thief of Bagdad. So now, in the orthodoxy of proﬁling, this 20\n\nthe greatest moment?\n\ntall, handsome man was cast as the Nazi leader. Years earlier, a similar thing had happened to Erich von Stroheim. As a very humble Austrian, without a von to his name, Stroheim had arrived in Hollywood to be cast as Hun baddies, and to advise on the correct details of Prussian uniforms. Because he had to be on loan from MGM, Veidt earned $5,000 a week, nearly twice Bogart’s salary. Such ironies ran through the supporting cast. Peter Lorre, born Laszlo Lowenstein in Hungary, has the modest role of Ugarte. He had become a star playing the murderer in Fritz Lang’s M, so the movie business took it for granted that he must always be a villain or a madman. In America, Lorre had played the Japanese detective Mr. Moto in eight B pictures in the space of three years—an escape, but a prison, too. He had been Joel Cairo (with Bogart, Greenstreet, and Mary Astor) in The Maltese Falcon. He was friendly with Bogart, but that meant he had to realize that he would never be a star and was usually cast as a disturbed person with wicked or craven designs. There is a croupier at Rick’s Café Américain. It’s a small role, ﬁlled by Marcel Dalio, who had served Jean Renoir as one of the escaping prisoners in La Grande Illusion and then played the marquis in La Règle du Jeu. That is one of the great performances in French cinema, a superb creation of uneasy nobility, the master of the house but a kid with his elaborate toys, a guilty husband and avid womanizer. Marcel Dalio was an exceptional actor. But he was Jewish (born Israel Moshe Blauschild), and in 1940 he left France for America. He was welcomed by studios who may not have seen his Renoir ﬁlms and could not see how he was ﬁt to play lead roles. And so here he is a croupier who can magic his roulette wheel and turn up 22 when Rick gives him the nod. That nod is an insiders’ sentimental expression of understanding and loyalty between the two men, as beautiful but unspoken a friendship as that between Rick and Sam. In life, after Dalio had left France, the Germans posted close-up 21\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nposters of him on Parisian streets saying, “This is what a Jew looks like.” The good turn that Dalio’s croupier manages in the ﬁlm is so that a pretty young woman can purchase liberty for herself and her husband, instead of having to sell herself for a night or two to Captain Renault. That actress was Joy Page (born Paige), and it seems that she got the sentimental part on her own. But her stepfather was Jack Warner, who wanted to do nothing to encourage or mislead her, so he made sure she was paid less than any other speaking-part actor in the ﬁlm. And that Joy Page never made another ﬁlm for Warners. You may think that’s because she was the child of Jack’s second wife from an earlier marriage. Not at all; Jack also did whatever he could to discourage his own son, Jack Jr., the kid who shouldn’t really have had that name if he was meant to be a regular Jewish son. Elsewhere in Casablanca, you will ﬁnd S. Z. Sakall, Jewish and born in Hungary. Sakall had worked in German cinema until 1933, when he chose to return to Hungary. By 1940, he thought it wise to move on to America. Wallis picked him to play the headwaiter at Rick’s, and he did a ﬁne job. It led to another ﬁfteen years’ work as a supporting player in Hollywood. He was known as “Cuddles.” But most of his immediate family, including three sisters, had died in concentration camps. Do you remember the singer, Yvonne, who has had an affair with Rick? She was played by Madeleine Lebeau, who had ﬂed from France in 1940 with Marcel Dalio. They had married in 1939. They managed to get to Lisbon and with forged papers (or letters of transit), they sailed to Chile and made their way north to Hollywood and Casablanca. It sounds like a romantic story—it sounds like Casablanca itself, where Yvonne leads the singing of La Marseillaise with shiny tears in her eyes—but the couple divorced before the ﬁlm opened. Lebeau died only in May 2016, the last survivor from the picture. Then there’s the barman at the café. His role had been cast. 22\n\nthe greatest moment?\n\nLeo Mostovoy was playing the part, until he struck observers as too earnest or lacking in a natural comedic sense. Curtiz and Wallis sought a strain of sardonic humor whenever possible. So Mostovoy was replaced with Leonid Kinskey, born in St. Petersburg in 1903 and compelled to leave his country because he was no supporter of the Revolution. He found small parts as an actor, but he got the barman role because he was one of the entourage Bogart liked to drink with. So there was a ganglike air on the ﬁlm, and Warner Brothers in the 1930s had made some of the best gang ﬁlms ever done. No one involved on the picture could miss the unusual league of nations and refugees that had been enlisted. And whatever the uncertainty over the script, everyone could guess that Max Steiner (a Viennese Jew) would come in at the end with a score so adept at romance, suspense, and sheer swagger that the ﬁlm would soar. Steiner was at Warners for thirty years, and he wrote music for 140 ﬁlms. It was his stuff that played over the opening WB logo. He is vital to the atmosphere of the studio, whether we call the result slick shit or inspiring entertainment. There was no mistaking Casablanca as a Warners production, but to what extent was it a Jewish ﬁlm? That’s a question to bear in mind while understanding that Warners were anxious not to seem like a Jewish business. They wanted to be American, and hoped that role existed. So it was a ﬁlm that addressed the justice and necessity of the war, and was pledged to the idea of America as a proper part of the Allied effort. But the Jewish experience of the war was not emphasized. There is a ﬂashback to Rick and Ilsa in Paris that is fair enough, though not the best scene in the picture and not quite necessary. But there is no glimpse of Laszlo in a concentration camp. It’s more to the point, and closer to the theme of this book, that the ﬁlm was liberal in its sentiments, brilliant and appealing in its screen decisiveness, wry, fond of sentiment yet hardboiled, as if to say 23\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nwe’re Americans, we can take it and dish it out, we’re the best, tough and soft at the same time. So much of that crazed package of attractive attitudes came from the movies and passed into the nervous system of the country. I should add that I am not Jewish (or quite American). Some things ameliorate that and may serve as credentials (or letters of transit). When I was four, in London, my grannie showed me newspaper pictures of the relief of concentration camps, and tried to explain those images. I was ﬁlled with awe and terror, and I know that the Holocaust (which I could not grasp then) has been the most important cultural event in my life. It still is; it ensures that a child’s horror persists. Some of us know what Sylvia Plath meant in her poem “Daddy,” when she said, “I think I may well be a Jew.”10 But here’s a dilemma: Sylvia Plath was a rage for a while in the years after she died. That was ﬁfty-four years ago. It won’t be long before the last survivors of the concentration camps are gone, too. Then history takes its rest: the outrages of the Hundred Years’ War are merely notional now. What century was that? We have to accept that the hard facts of 1939–45 will go into soft focus. I know, that’s regrettable, or deplorable. Trickier by far is the way Casablanca endures and becomes a passive, fraudulent version of what happened in the war. Yet the loyalists of movies still tell ourselves that that second war was the climax and the vindication of the history of cinema.\n\n24\n\n3 What Are Brothers For?\n\nOne of the most disconcerting ﬁlms about brothers ever made in America came from Warner Brothers. There is something indecent in its fable, it is so nakedly revealing of an eternal sibling hostility that responds to no moral code. And I am not surprised it came from Warners. Sibling rivalry was their thing. The ﬁlm is East of Eden (1955), drawn from the John Steinbeck novel, and before that from the mythic contest of the ﬁrst two children on earth, Cain and Abel. In that Bible story, the two sons of Adam and Eve fall out, without any clear reason being offered. Is it that brothers are driven by nature to tend that way? The Lord looks upon Abel with respect, but he has no similar feeling for Cain, which prompted “wroth” in that brother, and then murder. Why is Cain regarded so unfairly? Just because he is not Abel?—or was God trying to be a scriptwriter? When the director Elia Kazan proposed East of Eden to Jack\n\n25\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nWarner as a ﬁlm project, he found that Warner “hadn’t read the book, didn’t propose to, didn’t even ask what it was about, and didn’t ask whom I was going to cast. What he did ask was: ‘What’ll it cost?’ ‘About one six,’ I said. ‘You’ve got it,’ he said. ‘Cast who you want. Come and have lunch with me.’ ”1 If the picture had an agenda, that had more to do with Kazan’s sense of himself as an ugly, resentful Anatolian life force determined to assert himself in America. If you read his great book, A Life, you can’t help being thrilled by the chutzpah of Kazan against the world, and his frightening urge to betray others before they betrayed him. In the Steinbeck novel, Charles and Adam Trask are deeply opposed half-brothers. They encounter a young woman, Cathy, who is as close to evil as Steinbeck or the American novel ever came. And Steinbeck was of German descent, Episcopalian. Cathy has killed her own parents and become a prostitute. The half-brothers rescue her, and Adam marries Cathy, without realizing that Charles has had her sexually. Cathy will give birth to twin sons, though the possibility is left hanging in the novel that the two sons come from the half-brothers. Once she has delivered her twins, Cathy shoots Adam and leaves him with the new sons. Adam makes a ranch in Salinas, and Cathy goes away to Monterey. Those two places are only twenty miles apart, but in the biblical mood of the novel they are distant, so that Adam and his sons do not know that Cathy is alive still. Twinning in the novel is elemental and philosophical, and suited to the rivalry of brothers torn between some old order and new ways ahead. East of Eden may be the best Bible story Hollywood ever made, so compelling that it shrugs off any conventional attempt to be moral. In the movie, Adam (Raymond Massey) has two sons who live with him on his farm in Salinas. They are named Aaron (Dick Davalos) and Cal ( James Dean). Aaron is upright, handsome and polite to others; he is a good boy. But Cal is more 26\n\nwh at are br other s for?\n\ncrouched; he may be alluring, but he is not what movies of the early ﬁfties called good-looking. He is shy, secretive, full of troubled thoughts; he feels wronged because there is a more trusting bond between his father and his brother than he can ever enjoy. In Dean’s performance, Cal is the epitome of every bruised outsider kid in Warners history. His envy ﬁxes on what seems like Adam’s disapproving and withheld affection, and on the way a young woman, Abra ( Julie Harris), is regarded as the natural ﬁancée for Aaron. The narrative of the ﬁlm (using a fraction of Steinbeck’s story) has Cal farming beans to pay his father back the money lost on a pioneering refrigeration project. The bean business thrives as America’s entry into the Great War comes closer. But when Aaron senses Cal’s plan, he trumps his darker brother by giving their father a greater gift—news of his engagement to Abra. Adam rejects Cal’s gift—of cash, $15,000, wrapped up as a birthday present—because Adam is agonized at being on the draft board, sending young men off to the war on which Cal is a proﬁteer. The ﬁlm is placed tenderly in the California of 1915–17, but it is myth and fairytale. In cruel revenge, Cal insists on taking Aaron to see their mother ( Jo Van Fleet). She was thought to be dead, long ago, but in fact she keeps a brothel in Monterey. Aaron is so devastated he rushes off to enlist in the army. So Cal is left at home, to look after his invalid father (he has been shocked into a stroke), with Abra as his mate and beloved. East of Eden is hideously unfair special pleading. Aaron is a prig, but no worse, and the action removes him from the arena, leaving the melancholy, self-centered Cal not just in charge but as the focus of attention. Dean’s performance helped crystallize the new psychic yearning of teenagers as much as Elvis Presley would a year later. This rapturous male weepie is driven by the neediness of its director, Elia Kazan, a self-conscious outsider who sought revenge for himself.2 Kazan was a magician 27\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nwith actors, and that shows in the stealthy, emerging feelings of James Dean. But I don’t know another ﬁlm anywhere that so directly understands the way one brother might need to vanquish the other. And the censors let it pass—but Warner Brothers had a good record at ﬁnessing censorship. You can say this is mere coincidence and too little as a basis for any theory that might be applied to Warner Brothers, the company that insisted on sibling status in its very name. Still, Cain and Abel is the ﬁrst murder story in the Bible, and this ﬁlm came at a crucial moment in the story of Harry and Jack Warner. East of Eden (which was very successful) could have come from other studios. But that is just a way of suggesting how so many movie stories have a persisting pattern of mythic emotional forces acting out family antagonisms. The Warner Brothers were like other studios in that instinct, but they did not want to escape a vein of fraternal opposition, the good and the bad working themselves out. The Searchers does not seem to be a Jewish ﬁlm, but it begins in a smothered rivalry between brothers. More to the point (just because the antagonism is so much less emphatic), The Jazz Singer (the historic turning point for Warner Brothers) is about the struggle in one character to be both Jewish and American, a cantor’s son and a sensational entertainer in vaudeville. Not that all show business brothers were dogs prepared to ﬁght. Joel and Ethan Coen have got on very well now for decades. George and Ira Gershwin are proverbial for the harmony of male siblings. The Epstein brothers, Philip and Julius, wrote together—they did a lot of Casablanca as a team, and that is a ﬁlm in which ostensible rivals, Rick and Laszlo, become brothers in the ﬁght for freedom, just as Rick and Louis Renault stroll off into the fog at “the start of a beautiful friendship.” On the other hand, Joseph L. Mankiewicz once told me that it was only possible to understand his life by grasping the 28\n\nwh at are br other s for?\n\nceaseless rivalry he had felt with his beloved brother Herman. David and Myron Selznick—producer and agent—were locked in a similar competition. Myron held on to a share of Gone With the Wind just to prove his brother had been a chump in selling out. Two sisters, Joan Fontaine and Olivia de Havilland, hardly liked to be reminded of each other. You may say that these anecdotes are just natural struggles for power, comparable with feuds or skirmishes in any walk of life. After all, we may resent, rival, and hate the people we are related to (where else are we going to go?)—it’s the same impulse that’s involved in love. But the movie business of its own great days was uncommonly affected by these competitions just because they told the stories. The family history of so many Jewish families who had come from eastern Europe to North America was confused, not always certain in the minds of the people themselves, and subject to the memory, the eloquence, or the scenario of elders. Jack didn’t know the world that had produced him, or want to be tied to it. So the power to cast the story was vital, and subject to argument. Late in life, Jack Warner said he had forgotten what the family name had been. In 1965, he wrote, “I have never been to Poland. And it looks now as though I’ll never go there.”3 Of course, it wasn’t even Poland. In the years that counted, this was Russia. But if you want to start the story, then you have to say that Benjamin Wonsal or Wonskolasor was living in Krasnoshilt or Krasnosielc in the middle of the nineteenth century. That was a village about ﬁfty miles north of Warsaw. We learned to call it Poland after the Great War, but it had been part of the Russian Empire, and far more inﬂuenced by tsarist oppression. It was an area with a large Jewish population, and soon after German occupation in 1939 it would be the site of massacres at the hands of the Nazis just as it had been subject to Russian pogroms for several hundred years. It was a place 29\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nwhere many people were in the clothing business. And where children got no ofﬁcial education and depended on family teaching.4 Little is certain, but Benjamin (born in 1857) lived with and was married to Pearl Leah Eichelbaum (born a year later), also from Krasnosielc. People married neighbors. He was apparently a shoemaker, though that does not mean he had no other occupations when need or opportunity arose. He and Pearl had children in Poland: a girl, Cecilia, the ﬁrst, and dead at four; Moses, or Hirsch, or Hirz, born in 1881; Aaron in 1884; and Szmul in 1887. There was another son who died aged four, and another who made it to twenty. There would be ﬁve daughters, and if you think sons had to struggle, just imagine the girls, who were so much more thoroughly overlooked. But twelve children in all. What happened next is subject to shipping lists and possible errors in the inventory of passengers. But it was common for the man to make such journeys ﬁrst, with a wife and children coming on later. So it is said—with the energy of story attempting to settle confusion (and we must imagine this as the version told to young children)—that Benjamin sailed from Hamburg to Liverpool on the Chester in January 1888. Almost immediately, he took another ship from Liverpool to Baltimore. More than a year later, in October 1889, Pearl sailed from Bremen to Baltimore on the Hermann, with several children, including Moses, Aaron, and Szmul. The family was reunited, and it was around this time that Benjamin adopted the name Warner for all of them, and Moses became Harry, Aaron became Albert, and Szmul became Sam. Their ages in 1889 ranged from eight to two, so they can be forgiven for settling on one story or script that everyone could stick with. How do you tell a child his name has changed without setting free a kind of actor?\n\n30\n\nwh at are br other s for?\n\nAs the new Warner family made its way in North America, it rested for a time in Canada. Several other children were born (and survived), all girls except for Itzhak or Jacob, born in Ontario in 1892, and set to be Jack. So Jack was the North American boy, the kid, eleven years younger than Harry, and sooner or later not just the most inventive, ambitious, charismatic, and treacherous, but trouble. The family had spoken Yiddish. They had observed even if they had not directly suffered from Cossack cruelty. They had been so oppressed that they had sought to escape to the New World. That is part of the classic scenario of tales told to kids, and it surely had substance. But many who were poor and beaten did not risk wild dreams of something better. The Wonsals had been able to buy passage on ships for great voyages. They were never indigent. The real poor remained in eastern Europe, and in time, one way or another, they passed into the ground. But these guys became the Warner Brothers. In Youngstown, Ohio—one of the most dangerous places in America at that time—and then in Los Angeles, they made a point of sticking together. Still, there would be those later who said Jack “killed” Harry. You don’t have to credit that in an originalist sense of murder, but try forgetting it. Or see how far the Warner Brothers left alive in 1942–43 might look upon the lively melodrama of Casablanca, with its separated families, letters of transit, and noir dreams, as if they might be real. When Steinbeck ﬁnished East of Eden, he wrote to a friend with the realization, “Always I had this book waiting to be written.” In rather the same way, though Jack Warner may never have read the novel, or intruded on the ﬁlming of East of Eden, it was as much his story as The Jazz Singer, The Public Enemy, White Heat, or so many of the family melodramas made under the Warner Bros colophon. Brothers cannot escape the need for battle. By 1955, the year of East of Eden, the thing called Warner\n\n31\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nBrothers was an immense success, and the kind of transformation that helped identify success in America. This was how showmakers out of Russia, without English, a name, or credentials, could become moguls in the land, as well as the arbiters who doled out fame to people named Cagney, Bogart, Davis, and Crawford. So long as you remembered the sardonic Hollywood principle: “It is not enough that I succeed—my best friend must fail.”5 There’s a boast in that candor—it’s like the Clive James poem “The Book of My Best Friend Has Been Remaindered.” But that at least admits an enemy. What emerges from decades of Warners pictures is the obsession with sibling rivalry and pals who become enemies. It’s there in many big pictures discussed in this book, but there are so many more: Four Daughters, where the girls vie for the same guys; The Hard Way, a struggle between sisters; Devotion, with Ida Lupino as Emily Brontë, Olivia de Havilland as Charlotte, and Nancy Coleman as Anne; the deadly brothers in Track of the Cat; buddies ﬁghting over a woman in Other Men’s Women; family vendetta in Pursued; brothers split by a woman in They Drive by Night; coworkers in opposition in Manpower, on which Edward G. Robinson and George Raft came to blows; the brothers at odds in The Master of Ballantrae; and Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins seething together in Old Acquaintance and The Old Maid, a natural extension of the actresses’ real loathing for each other. You have to see how far the storytellers at Warners—the writers, the producers, the directors, and the actors—had this smell of intimate violence in their heads. Harry and Jack Warner were always at odds, and that intensiﬁed as they became the decisive brothers. Harry was a selfconscious older brother, aware of the old country and of the codes the family needed to adhere to if they were to remain themselves during physical and social removal. Harry would like to think of himself as reasonable, good-natured, homely, 32\n\nwh at are br other s for?\n\nand happy with that. Leo Rosten would say, “He was not an impressive man to meet. He led a brilliant business but he had no intention of being an outstanding personality. He was kind, honest, devout and devoted to family matters. He always observed the Jewish faith.”6 He was in the spirit of those actors who graced Warner Brothers movies for years—the friend, the sidekick, the amiable listener, the loyalist. You can see that impulse over the years in supporting actors like Alan Hale, Frank McHugh, Pat O’Brien, Jack Carson, Regis Toomey, George Tobias, and Ronald Reagan. Jack may not have been a simple opposite to Harry, but he found himself in opposing him. He had no intention of being unimpressive. He worked hard to be better looking and to draw attention. People marveled at his bright teeth, and his habit of telephoning while sitting on the john. He adopted a thin mustache and snappy talk: if Warners led the way in bringing sound to the movies, why shouldn’t Jack live up to that? He was a fair singer and a chronic teller of jokes, some of them in poor taste (“Uneasy lies the head that wears a toilet seat!”). Jack Benny said once, “Jack Warner would rather make a bad joke than a good picture.”7 Harry deplored the jokes and said they came from growing up in that racy Youngstown, Ohio, instead of in the shtetl. Of course, in many ways Harry was himself Americanized and a happy resident of ﬁne American houses. But brothers thrive on their differences. Jack was eager to be a show business person: this makes him awful in some ways, despised by many of his own employees. But he is irresistible, too, the showman in the family, the one who’s likely to tell the world, “You ain’t heard nothing yet!” He liked exclamation marks, while Harry found them vulgar. In 1907, Harry had married Rea Levinson, a longtime girlfriend. They had three children. The family lived according to the Jewish faith and tradition, and no one ever saw a sign that Harry needed to go outside his marriage for diversion. They 33\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nwere a steadfast and devoted couple, a model for the contented families that run through Hollywood movies. But Jack Warner had seen another way. He was just twenty as the Warner Brothers moved into the picture business, and he quickly assessed the armies of pretty women dedicated to getting on screen by catching his eye. By 1915, Jack was in charge of the family movie exchange in San Francisco. That’s where he met Irma Solomons, from a wealthy Jewish family. He wooed her and married her, and was educated and embarrassed by Irma’s disdain for his own parents. As Neal Gabler puts it in An Empire of Their Own, Jack had “married up.”8 He and Irma had a single child, born in 1916, and Jack named the son Jack Jr., contrary to the Ashkenazi practice of not naming a child to honor a living relative. Harry deplored that decision, and he was shocked when Jack’s marriage became a mask for affairs with actresses and women eager to be attached to the movies. Harry had become a self-appointed guardian of family morals—it is the one sign of anything other than kindness in his life. His younger brother Sam had married the actress Lina Basquette in 1925. This was a shaming concession to the new world as Harry saw it. Lina was a Catholic, twenty years younger than Sam, with a reputation for fast living. Sam and Lina had a daughter, born in 1926, named Lita. But in 1927, when Sam died suddenly, Harry took steps to ensure that Lina would not have control of Lita, especially in the matter of religious upbringing. He went to law over it, and Lina yielded after Harry volunteered $300,000 as a trust fund for Lita. Thereafter, he and Rea were the child’s legal guardians, despite repeated, failed attempts by Lina to regain custody. Lina Basquette had a turbulent life. She returned to acting and worked in small parts until around 1940; she would be married eight times; she eventually retired to raise dogs in Penn-\n\n34\n\nwh at are br other s for?\n\nsylvania. Great Danes. She never saw her daughter properly until the 1970s, and she was barred from any Warners inheritance. She died in 1994, hoping that her life story might be made into a movie.9 There was more. A young man named José Paige, from Albuquerque, New Mexico, was trying to make a career as a Latin lover actor named Don Alvarado. He actually made a few ﬁlms for Warners, perhaps because of his young wife, Ann Boyar. She was sixteen when they married, a lustrous beauty, of Russian Jewish descent, and she caught Jack Warner’s eye. He persuaded her to divorce Alvarado in Mexico, probably in 1933. Then Jack left his wife, Irma, and started living with Ann. They had a daughter, Barbara, in 1934, and in 1936 they were married. Harry did not attend that ceremony. He wrote Jack saying that the only good thing about it was that their parents had not lived to see it.10 They had died in 1934 and 1935. Harry regarded the divorce between Irma and Jack and the illegitimate child as a scandal and a disaster. It hardened a gulf between the brothers, just as it was a metaphor for the disquiet that the movies had made a cult of glamour and attractiveness, promiscuity and divorce. Don Alvarado acted for a few years, but the ﬁeld for Latin lovers was too crowded. He gave that up and became an assistant—at Warner Brothers (he knew people). As Don Page, he would be an assistant director on East of Eden. Jack and Ann Warner, though frequently estranged, became a famous social couple in Hollywood, just as Harry shrank from any such attention. But the brothers were business partners nonetheless, and their business—with ups and downs—was an astonishing success. By the 1940s, Jack Warner had become Warner Brothers in the public eye, and he was more signiﬁcant in running the studio than Harry. But Harry was president,\n\n35\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nstill, strict, disapproving, and a mote and a beam in Jack’s eye. “What a boring guy Harry was,” said Darryl Zanuck once. “Jack was unreliable, but never boring.”11 In that passing remark lies a lesson of the picture business. Sooner or later, Harry had to go.\n\n36\n\n4 Family Dinner\n\nIf it was late 1903, or early 1904, Harry Warner was twentytwo; Abe was nineteen; Sam was sixteen; and Jack was eleven. It was dinner time at the Warner home in Youngstown, Ohio. You do not have to credit what follows in every detail, except that it is a story that was told by one of the family, years later, when that little girl had had the chance to hear versions of the evening told to her by many of the people who had been there.1 The family had tried Baltimore, Canada, Pittsburgh, and now Youngstown. Benjamin had kept working at shoe repairing, because in American cities looking for work and life the citizenry were soon wearing out their shoes. Harry had become an expert young cobbler. The family had had a ﬂurry of activity with bicycles as the developing society sought technologies that might spare shoe leather. Their thoughts of business were all transport and friction. They had tried running a bowling alley, and they had spent time in the meat business, but shoes\n\n37\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nwere the standby because only the hopelessly poor went without them. The Warners were managing better than many families, but they were as yet unknown to anyone except themselves. Dinner was served and cleared away, and it was then that Pearl brought out her best latkes, with apple sauce and sour cream. There were sisters in the group—Rose, Sadie, and Anna— and they were eager voices in the family, yet not much more important than two sisters who had died already in infancy. The light of the family and its hope were the brothers, and they had been taught by their parents and their own company to behave like a group. “One for all, and all for one,” their father told them, though the Warners had few of the advantages of Dumas’s musketeers. But this was a special night—or so it would be memorialized—and Sam was the agent of the occasion. Sam then was the extrovert and the doer; he was the brother Jack looked up to. Somehow or other, for hard-earned money (perhaps as much as $1,000!), he had purchased one of the new kinetoscopes, a primitive movie projector, made by Thomas Edison, the marvels people were talking about, and Sam was proposing a movie show for the family on a white sheet he had pinned up on the wall. It was Sam who had acquired the machine and heard about how it operated, because by consent he was the one in the family who had the best sense of how gadgets worked. So he had set up the projector and he had threaded it with the motion picture that came with it—for demonstration purposes—The Great Train Robbery, it was called. At ﬁrst, with whirring and clanking noises, a picture played on the sheet that seemed like life. But then the machine lost its sharp focus, and then it stopped. The miracle in those days had many mechanical impediments. So Sam was embarrassed, 38\n\nfamily dinner\n\nand he did what he could, with knives and forks from the dinner table, to get the machine to work. He knew that his father would be asking why it had cost so much if it wasn’t working properly. Then the kid, Jack, leaped into the void, and proposed that, pretending to be the great and famous singer Leon Zuardo, he would now sing “Sweet Adeline.” He gave out with that song and all the energy of a natural show-off reluctant to be subdued by the order and anxiety of his family. Brother Abe wondered aloud whether Sam had been conned by the neighbor who sold him the projector. Harry recalled that the neighbor had admitted it hardly ever worked without a problem. But Sam, the machine, the miracle, and destiny would not be denied—all over the world, people were struggling to get these machines to work so that transport could be achieved without friction. Then, for eleven minutes or so, the assembled Warners watched The Great Train Robbery. Of course, it could have been any strip of ﬁlm. But that’s no reason not to note what a strange piece of work The Great Train Robbery was. This was a Jewish family, from out of the shadow of Russia, lately installed in the United States. Most of them had not spoken English for their early years. They had had to learn and labor to ﬁnd a place for themselves. They understood from the outset that many Americans feared or hated them because they were Jewish and foreign. They had recognized that in determining on a business, and a living for themselves, they would have to combat that. In settling for shoes, they realized that they would oppose the stereotype by which many Jews made basic items of clothing for people. They were resolved, if not desperate or anxious, to be respectable, law-abiding, and part of the new country. Families of greater fortune or advantage tell themselves stories in which honesty, honor, hard work, and persistence are the most available of human assets. These are stories of virtue defended and rewarded by history. Not too far away, in Pitts39\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nburgh and then New York, a Lithuanian American, Lewis Selznick (Laiser Zeleznick, once), had read Dickens’s David Copperﬁeld to his son David, with that opening in which David wonders whether he will be the hero of his own story. Thirty years later, that David Selznick had produced a ﬁlm from David Copperﬁeld, and it is still one of the most beloved movie versions of Dickens’s work, with W. C. Fields as Mr. Micawber, striving to make ends meet. But The Great Train Robbery, directed by Edwin S. Porter and made for the Edison Company, was a story in which sensation crowded out honor and respectability. Indeed, it is notable that in the story of that dinner-table miracle, Ben or Pearl or Harry did not remark on what a disgrace and a peril the ﬁlm was. But in the play of light and emulsion, motion and emotion, something was slipping past all the safeguards of respectability. It is the story of a band of robbers who hold up a train. It is something we can now identify as a Western, shot in a mixture of staged awkwardness and movie excitement. We see a gang of robbers planning to waylay a locomotive. We see the local control ofﬁce of the train, where a telegraph operation keeps track of the action. We ﬁnd ourselves on the train, with window rectangles of back projection giving the crude feeling of terrain passing by. We see that operator beaten and tied up. This is mundane and stilted, but then we are on the moving locomotive itself as the masked robbers seize control of the train. They order it stopped. They separate the engine from the body of the train. They call the passengers to assemble on the track. When one of that group seeks to run away, a robber shoots him down, and the splendid death fall leaves no doubt about what has happened. The plan to rob the train works—it becomes a “great” robbery, and then there is a screen event so lovely it may have made people swoon in 1903. As the robbers escape and get away, so the camera pans with their movement, celebrating it—motion 40\n\nfamily dinner\n\nequals emotion (even Einstein could have guessed that, and in 1903 he was hot on the trail of relativity). To this point, The Great Train Robbery could be a primer in how to take advantage of an innocent locomotive. A moment’s reﬂection tells us that a motion picture business—which was only slowly emerging in 1903—could not leave the story at that. You could not make something that was so plainly “How to Rob a Train.” The onus of business in America, or in any culture desiring respectability, was that the energy of the robbers had to be corrected and punished. So it turns out. An inexplicable child revives and frees the operator. A telegraph message is sent. Very soon (this is only eleven minutes) a posse comes upon the robbers in the woods, dividing up their loot, and shoots them down. Fair’s fair, you can say: you may have had the thrill of outlawry, but correction is guaranteed. Ben, Pearl, and Harry Warner could take some comfort in the show, even if that rascal Jack was jumping up and down with glee, riding a horse on the arm of the sofa, and ﬁring off his ﬁngers as six-guns. Then something happens that is a prediction of the movies, Warner Brothers, and America. The story is done, but the movie continues with a head-on close-up of a Western character—a tough face with a cowboy hat and a drooping mustache, enough to make us think of photographs of the Wyatt Earp family (the Gunﬁght at the OK Corral in Tombstone was in 1881). This man then takes out his six-gun and ﬁres six times into the camera, with smoke and ﬂash at every shot, as if to say, “Take that, law and order!” (He actually keeps ﬁring after the gun is empty.) We are still living with this uncanny, unexplored release of energy, will, and passion. The traditional version of this Youngstown story comes from Cass Warner Sperling, a granddaughter of Harry Warner. And she wraps up the story in a way that indicates the inﬂuence of her grandfather and his sober sense of business. We are in no 41\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nposition now to decide whether the 1903 dinner scene happened exactly like this. But once the story was passed on, the facts ceased to matter too much: In the ﬂickering light, Harry turned his face from the screen and watched the excited family audience as they viewed the magic shadows dancing on the sheet. If this is what it does to my own brothers and sisters, and my parents, then think what it can do to others. He imagined himself selling tickets to long lines of people waiting to see this new wonder on the wall come to life.2\n\nThe impact of The Great Train Robbery lingers still. It helps illuminate the ambiguity of two remarkable pictures, both of which were made for Warner Brothers. The Letter was made in 1941, directed by William Wyler, from the Somerset Maugham play. The ﬁlm starts at night, beneath a tropic moon, on a Malay rubber plantation. The camera tracks across the nocturnal scene until a shot rings out, and we come to the verandah of a wealthy house. The body of a man falls, and then we see the ﬁgure of a woman who has shot him. We know nothing beyond the fact of execution and the way this woman has carried it out, ﬁring all six shots into the body of the man.3 It is something that she is Bette Davis, so clearly gripped by need and passion; and it is an addition that this woman has started off the picture by boldly shooting down a man as if given no other choice. Try to think of another woman in a picture (let alone a Warner Brothers movie) who had behaved with such fatal conviction. But it means a great deal to us, and our capacity for passion, that she has put all six shots into him, no matter that he is probably dead before number six. In 1969, in The Wild Bunch, directed by Sam Peckinpah, and made in a state of barely controlled fury at his paymaster, Warner Brothers, there is a notable and more extended train\n\n42\n\nfamily dinner\n\nrobbery in which the iconography reminds one of the EdisonPorter ﬁlm, just as it makes the wild bunch—outlaws, killers, destructive and self-destructive ﬁgures—the objects of our attention, our sympathy, and our wounded admiration. In fact, Peckinpah fought Warners over the gunﬁre. The studio sound department wanted to lay in standard library gun shots, but Peckinpah demanded that each ﬁring be as fresh as a pretty girl just noticed.4 The Wild Bunch is burning with the romance of fatalistic outlaws and unimpressed by law, order, or respectability. The railways are a toy trainset waiting to be plundered. And the gunﬁre is like glee and sex. No studio did more for gunplay and devil-may-care outlaws than Warners.\n\n43\n\n5 Mustache\n\nYou don’t have to swallow every detail of that dinner-table story any more than you can scoff the latkes. It is a stretch to think that this far-from-secure family gave the teenage Sam $1,000 to buy that projector, even if within days they were cashing in by putting on screenings of The Great Train Robbery that took in several hundred dollars a week.1 It’s just as likely that Sam was shaky keeping the machine in working order; it’s quite possible that a dozen other enterprises were horning in on the Great Train Robbery sensation; and it’s probable that in Ohio and Pennsylvania, running those shows was subject to intimidating interference from gangs ready to smash your projector or from the agencies of the Edison corporation demanding to know where you had got their rights. This was not a tidy, law-abiding business; it was a ﬁerce competition making up its rules as it went along and always dreaming of California just to get away from gangs and copyright issuers on the East Coast. 44\n\nmustac he\n\nThen consider that if the revelation at the dinner table occurred in 1903, it was twenty years before Warner Brothers were within sight of being established or secure. For many years, the family remained attached to shoes, bicycles, meat, and anything else that might put latkes on the table. It was only in 1923 that the name Warner Brothers appeared in legal documentation. If Harry really had that vision of how it was all going to turn out in 1903, we have to say that he was uncommonly patient or forgetful. It wasn’t until after the Great War that the four of them seemed to have had their picture taken. Moreover, it’s worth adding that in 1917, when the United States entered the Great War, Harry was thirty-ﬁve, Albert was thirty-two, Sam was twenty-nine, and that kid Jack was twenty-four, ages at which service might have been taken for granted, especially for the Jack who later greeted the Second World War as a magniﬁcent opportunity to be an honorary lieutenant colonel. (He had asked to be a general, but the authorities felt that was going too far.)2 So it’s not quite clear whether the Warner Brothers served in the Great War. Jack said that he and Sam went to an enlistment ofﬁce only to be told they were too valuable doing their thing. So they were assigned to the Army Signal Corps, and that’s how they did a ﬁlm warning about syphilis.3 As they worked on a movie intended for troops overseas, Sam observed that it might play very well at home, too. Their later employee, Darryl Zanuck, was more active. He lied his way into the Nebraska National Guard at the age of fourteen and did brief service in France before the war ended. Not that the Warners ignored the war: they purchased the ﬁlm rights to a successful and sensationalist book, My Four Years in Germany, and made it their ﬁrst signiﬁcant production. But there are pictures of the brothers, from the early 1920s, a quartet lined up behind a shining desk in an empty room. They are joined by Harry Rapf, an early associate who would 45\n\nwar ner b ros\n\ngo on to be an important ﬁgure at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. But Rapf is short, slight, and insecure, which are terms that do not ﬁt the brothers. They are the heroes or the founding fathers of this book, and it would be mean-spirited not to be impressed by the journey they made; still, one has to admit how far the four of them look like a tableau out of The Godfather. These are big men, with an air of physical authority that adds to their unsmiling unison. Albert had been a football player, very solid, but trim and with an expression of unsentimental intent on his face. Albert handled a lot of the family business, the story goes, and he seems like no one you would think to mess with. As for Sam, he could be auditioning as muscle, protection, or even an enforcer. His face is set, gloomy, not as polished or urbane as Albert’s. He looks like someone waiting for orders, and again he is no one to argue with. Harry is a little older, lighter, and more relaxed. But he keeps a straight, humorless gaze, as if he is resolved to give nothing away. At a glance you’d guess that Sam and Albert are waiting on Harry’s orders, which are likely to be quiet, but effective. Then there is Jack, the only one who is sitting less than upright, his head tilted over to one side. He is not smiling yet, but you feel he could, just as you wonder whether Sam and Albert have ever thought of smiling. Now, you may say this analysis of a still photograph is less than fair, or like looking at movies. But there are other pictures of the brothers on their own that bear out this pattern. Sam and Albert do not smile. They stand still with their arms hanging at their sides. They do not seem to possess any kind of performing ease, let alone humor or appealing personality. A lot of people said Sam could be lively and funny, especially with women and gadgets. No one ever accused Albert of that. There is kindness sometimes, or philosophy, in Harry’s face. But those three brothers keep their mouths closed. Gradually you begin\n\n46\n\nmustac he\n\nto wonder whether it’s because they never had their teeth ﬁxed. It’s then you realize that Jack grins a lot and ﬂashes his teeth, which seem to be standard American cosmetics. It’s there in the photographs, the promise that Jack was not just a clown, a singer, and a show-off, but a modern showman who was going to end up telling the family story and smiling at America. Jack abandoned his own education for more pressing things before the age of twelve. Nor did the other brothers seem to pick up much schooling, so there are stories about the difﬁculty they had with reading. It is the general estimate that not one of them graduated high school. But Jack was the one of the four who wrote a book about himself—he called it My First Hundred Years in Hollywood—and it is cheerfully, ﬂamboyantly unreliable, as well as co-written with Dean Jennings (who also wrote a book called We Only Kill Each Other, about Bugsy Siegel and his brotherhood). In My First Hundred Years, amid its ragbag of scenes and scenario ideas, Jack reports a breakfast with his father in Pittsburgh. What are you going to have? asked Ben of the kid, and Jack replied that, if it was all right with Dad, he was going for ham and eggs, an American breakfast but not a family habit. Ben may have blinked. Then he said he’d have the same, country style. This is how Jack described that moment: “Our eyes met and we smiled, fellow schemers sharing a secret sin. I would never again be as close to him.”4 Even if he’d had a slick ghost at hand, it is unbelievable that Harry would have written such a book, or recognized any need for it. But then you look at the pictures of Harry and you see, time and again, the upturned bow of his closed lips and their psychic reticence. Whereas the young Jack is itching to grin, to break out of the behavioral models Harry believed in. In the same way, he let his ﬁrst marriage go to hell and lived\n\n47\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nwith his mistress in ways that shocked his sisters, and the forbiddingly respectable Harry. That public affair took off in the early thirties, and it seemed to be in the line of Jack’s several previous romances with actresses. He had had an affair with the Broadway singer and dancer Marilyn Miller, once the mistress of Florenz Ziegfeld and the wife of Jack Pickford. Warner was so keen on her that he promoted a 1929 hit for Warners, the fourth all-talking picture, Sally, taken from her 1920 hit show written by Jerome Kern for Ziegfeld. More than his brothers ever dared, Jack had pursued his chances with pretty women in pictures as an obvious fruit of the profession. But with Ann Alvarado he moved on into a real show business display, where the affair became a daring, naughty asset, even a status symbol. As Jack and other Hollywood moguls saw it, taking advantage of the pretty women applying to the picture business was obvious, expected. This is the most direct conﬂict that existed between Harry and Jack, the old sense of family honor and the undeniable insight that movies were selling sex. Jack kept no record of his automatic conquests or the afternoon visitors to his ofﬁce. But the habit was known, and it’s built in to the theory of movies as an arena for sexual fantasy. Sometimes ﬁction captures the dynamic more clearly than rumor. In Norman Mailer’s novel The Deer Park, set in Hollywood, there is a studio head, Herman Teppis, who has girls come to his ofﬁce to service him. One woman arrives and repeats what an executive has told her, that “I should do what you wanted, Mr. Teppis.” What he wants is to be fellated, in what is a discreet description (though Mailer’s novel upset people in 1955, and changed publishers). What follows the deed is most interesting. The girl departs, and Teppis returns to business—he has a conference coming up on a picture called Song of the Heart. But then Mailer gives us a glimpse of the tyranny and even the vengeance that 48\n\nmustac he\n\nreside in power: “Teppis ground out his cigar. ‘There’s a monster in the human heart,’ he said aloud to the empty room. And to himself he whispered, like a bitter old woman, close to tears, ‘They deserve it, they deserve every last thing that they get.’ ”5 At the same time, Jack did something his brothers had never thought of. He grew a pencil mustache, a hard line that would need daily attention, and the italic overlining for his smile. You can say that was chance. But there’s a pattern. Darryl Zanuck joined Warners in the twenties and helped introduce a kind of emphatic storytelling that would become the character of the studio, but when he started out, the nervous Zanuck pitched a story for Rin Tin Tin on all fours, acting out the part of the dog. Jack responded: “Kid, go buy some glasses and grow a mustache. You’ll look older. Oh yeah, I like your story. We’ll ﬁlm it.”6 When Jack ﬁrst saw Clark Gable in It Happened One Night, he wrote to his new executive, Hal Wallis (the man who had replaced Zanuck), “I think we should deﬁnitely have Lyle Talbot grow a mustache just like his. It gives him a sort of a ﬂash and good looks.”7 This transformation never really worked for Talbot, but the thin black line and the hope for ﬂash was the marker for Jack Warner. A few years later, a crucial decision was made with Errol Flynn—he should grow a mustache, and then it should be made darker. Jack grinned, for now Flynn looked like him, the shvontz.8\n\n49\n\n6 For Liberty?\n\nIn hindsight, in his own book, Jack did muse over the slow development of Warner Bros. In many parts of the East and the Midwest, the brothers were doing worthwhile business, playing pictures in parlors, halls, and any enterprise with a big room. But there was “a lack of pictures.” Throughout the emerging business, geniuses were discovering that as well as a projector and a room you needed a movie. So make them yourself: that’s what motivated the new businesses that had become Paramount, MGM, Universal, and Fox before the name Warners was known. In New Castle, Pennsylvania, the boys found a funeral parlor available for screenings. It even had its own chairs and an undertaker who said he was ready to delay a funeral so long as a good picture was playing. By 1915, the brothers had several ﬁlm exchanges, clearinghouse facilities where local exhibitors could rent movies made\n\n50\n\nfor liberty?\n\nby other companies. It seems that that exchange business had its ups and downs, so that the brothers were unable to get properly established or to pursue stray thoughts of actually making ﬁlms. That’s why My Four Years in Germany is so essential in the Warners legend, even, as Neal Gabler observed, as important as The Birth of a Nation was to Louis B. Mayer: Mayer had the New England distribution rights to Grifﬁth’s movie, and he made so much money from it that he soon ventured into production.1 James W. Gerard (1867–1951) was a lawyer who had served on the New York Supreme Court from 1907 to 1911. In 1913, he was appointed by President Woodrow Wilson to be ambassador to Germany. In that position, Gerard became a spokesman in Berlin for several Allied causes, including the neutrality or not of Belgium, the “crime” of German submarine warfare, and the matter of German atrocities during the war. When diplomatic relations between the United States and Germany were broken off in February 1917, Gerard returned to America and wrote a memoir, My Four Years in Germany, which became a best-selling book. The fever of war had seized ﬁlmmaking, so it is not surprising that Lewis Selznick and William Fox, at least, were also inquiring about the ﬁlm rights to Gerard’s book, which was a close account of the ambassador’s dealings with Kaiser Wilhelm and other German ofﬁcials. Fox was reputed to have offered $75,000 for the movie rights. Yet the legend goes that Sam Warner, who was barely educated, came upon the book in a Los Angeles store. He started to read and was only halfway through when he telephoned Harry in New York and said this was the movie they needed to make. Harry liked the plan, but was low on funds. So they cabled Gerard and ﬁxed a meeting at which Harry hit the right high-minded note: “Mr. Ambassador, ﬁlm is the great founder of peace. When people understand each other, they need not 51\n\nwar ner b ros\n\nﬁght. I feel it is our patriotic duty to thousands of Americans who cannot read to make a motion picture of your book.”2 Apparently Gerard was impressed by Harry’s sincerity, even though he had already received a $75,000 check from Fox. Instead of cashing it, Gerard said he would wait to see Warners’ plan for a script—after all, the book was a study in diplomacy. Gerard actually doubted that all his detailed and frustrating meetings could make an exciting ﬁlm. Again, Harry had a sermon ready: “Ambassador, the movie I make can carry to the American people and the world, your stirring warning about the menace of the German military threat. The picture will help arouse the world at large as to why we must ﬁght for civilization.”3 As even Jack admitted, the sober Harry “could have sold swimsuits to a South Seas tribe.”4 Still, when Gerard said he was listening, and open to an offer, Harry had only $2,000 on hand. But he offered $50,000 plus twenty percent of the proﬁts. The uplifting story says that Gerard agreed, that Harry went out and did raise the full amount (it seems that Mark Dintenfass was a helper), that the picture was made and grossed between $800,000 and as much as $1.5 million in 1918 (the reports vary), leaving $130,000 in clear proﬁt for the Warners. Thus My Four Years in Germany is hailed as the decisive start of Warner Brothers as a moviemaking operation. But if that were so, you’d expect the Warner Brothers name to be all over the picture. Which is not the case. The ﬁlm announces itself as a production of My Four Years in Germany Inc., as directed by William Nigh. The insignia on the titles is not WB but WN. Nowhere does the proud name Warner appear. Yet the picture is more than one hundred minutes long and, within the bounds of naïve propaganda and halting narrative techniques, it is something to see. The script is credited to Charles Logue, and there are suggestions that he worked on it with Harry Warner. Like Wil52\n\nfor liberty?\n\nliam Nigh, Logue was at the start of a solid career on undistinguished pictures. The titles to the movie quote freely from Gerard’s book, and they are unashamed about the propaganda purpose of the enterprise. The ﬁlm depicts the kaiser and his supporters as creatures from wicked melodrama—not too far from the satirical depiction of the bosses in Eisenstein’s 1925 ﬁlm Strike—and the action reports shocking behavior from German troops, and events that the ambassador never witnessed. So the moral purpose of the ﬁlm is sacriﬁced to inﬂammatory (and unsubstantiated) scenes of war’s horror. The repeated claim that “facts” are being shown is a travesty of any careful historical approach. As early as possible in ﬁlm history, this is “a war movie” of a kind that Warners would return to with mixed motives in Sergeant York; Air Force; Objective, Burma!; and even The Green Berets, the John Wayne Vietnam picture from 1968 that Warners would release, for they liked to please Wayne as often as possible. So the Germans in My Four Years massacre prisoners, they round up Belgian women with clear prospects of rape, they abuse victims of typhus. They behave like “Huns,” or in the way Germans were demonized in so much ﬁction of the era. At the very end, as American troops arrive, they bayonet German soldiers with a zest that the audience has no way of resisting. A war movie is action, danger, and bloodshed, predicated on our winning. That approach was standard in ﬁctions of the Great War— it is not so different from the attitudes in Hearts of the World, Grifﬁth’s ﬁlm of 1918, though Grifﬁth was a more sophisticated storyteller. But My Four Years has real scale and production values. Somehow, this scatterbrained project has stumbled into a great wardrobe of military uniforms. There are exterior scenes of troop movements (some of them in snow). There are even scenes of some large ﬂeet, with shots taken from the deck of a battleship at sea—they go rather nicely with one spark of mock53\n\nwar ner b ros\n\ning humor, where Admiral von Tirpitz is seen playing with toy ships in a nursery pool of water. One can understand how, in 1918, an audience was impressed enough to produce something like the claimed gross income. The interiors (allegedly shot in a Biograph studio in the Bronx) have dark backgrounds that economize on sets and furniture, but the splendid uniforms are a diversion, and the acting is within the range that was tolerated at that time. Halbert Brown is impressively restrained as Gerard, and Louis Dean is suitably odious as the kaiser. There is little human subtlety on display, and no dramatic understanding of the role it might have in a crude silent movie. (Though, granted the years between, the view of Renault and Strasser in Casablanca is not really so advanced or deepened.) But the ﬁlm still plays as an historic curiosity, and it does not feel like beginners’ luck. The ﬁlm was certainly noticed, but it would be another ﬁve years before Warner Brothers had their name on a movie that might match this. There is a sequel noted in some of the ﬂimsy records (it does not seem to exist as anything to be seen), called Beware! (also known as Germany on Trial), in which Gerard warns of the abiding dangers of Germany. (Don’t forget, this man lived long enough to see Anschluss, Auschwitz, and The Big Sleep.) Logue and Nigh apparently worked on the follow-up, and that ﬁlm is said to be a Warners production. That was nearly a hundred years ago, and we don’t know enough about the actual work done. We never will—even if anything about the picture business had taught us to trust credits. My Four Years in Germany was an awful, ambitious picture, stupid and noisy as only silent pictures could be, high-minded and low-down, too long yet too short (it assesses the war in 108 minutes), but it was carried all the way to the precious screen. Certainly the Warners were involved on it, and the ﬁlm can be seen still. But it was actually distributed by First National, and not by a series of exchanges belonging to Warner Brothers. 54\n\nfor liberty?\n\nFirst National was an amalgamation of theatre chains, begun in 1917, that became a distribution company and then a production studio in its own right. In 1928, it would be taken over by Warners, a sign of how rapidly the brothers had started to develop by the late twenties. But that was not yet, and it was before the dog.\n\n55\n\n7 Rinty\n\nWhen it comes to a straightforward chronicle of Warner Brothers and its advance on fame and glory, you may well sigh at reaching 1920 and say, well, really you haven’t heard anything yet—or not nearly enough. So stay open to at least a dash of the unexpected. If I were to say that in the rough-and-tumble of the motion picture business before 1920, the Warner boys had let time pass them by, you could hardly argue. All too many short-lived ﬁlm enterprises had been launched in those years on a press handout and an uncertain piece of machinery—and perished. The Warners were all for one, and one for all (at least in Harry’s mind), but they hadn’t made a mark beyond dithering about in the business, thinking of buying theatres and ﬁlm exchanges, and getting used to calling themselves Warner. I don’t want to be unkind to them (there were so many others in the same business who could do that with more bite and accuracy),\n\n56\n\nr inty\n\nbut even their famous breakthrough, My Four Years in Germany, is not what the books say it is, and not something you really wish to spend the 108 minutes watching. You could have written them off, as many of their rivals must have done. More or less, they’d been knocking their heads against the wall for twenty years without even getting their name on their one hit ﬁlm. So perhaps they made a little money out of the ﬁlm, in an age when a little went a long way, especially if you had never given up on shoes, meat, soap, or bowling alleys. Nothing but a sense of wonder will carry us from the embarrassing pomp of My Four Years in Germany to the way, in just a few years, Warners made it to the big show, this lowdown, stumbling outﬁt that somehow blundered into"
