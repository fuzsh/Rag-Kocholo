Therapy does not supply a solution, but a beautiful princess certainly does. They are both accidentally ejected from the colony and encounter a myriad of obstacles in the outside world. When the princess is kidnapped, Z returns to the Colony just in time to save everyone from the evil plans of a corrupt general. Valor, courage and love ultimately win the day.\n\nANTZ is a superb piece of computer animation. The voices and matching caricatures of Woody Allen and the rest of the cast render a convincing, enticing invitation to an unexplored yet familiar domain. Although it has some violence, scary moments and mild foul language, good defeats evil in ANTZ. The movie’s moral, anti-Communist worldview takes a Christian stance in its solution to Z’s internal battle whether to serve the community or his own individual desires and needs. Z learns the individual has obligations toward the community, and the community has obligations toward the individual. This is a biblical viewpoint founded on the nature of the Holy Trinity, three persons in one God, the divine foundation for both the Many and the One\n\n(BB, ACAC, CC, L, VV, AA, M) Moral worldview of good versus evil & anti-Communist theme with strong, positive implications for Christian theology & philosophy; 7 mild obscenities, 2 mild exclamatory profanities such as “Oh, my God,” a couple mild vulgarities, & a reference to the rear end of an aphid; mild slapstick violence, a fight in an ant saloon, scary war scenes of ant army fighting big termites who spit acid with mild homage to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, ant leader tries to drown colony of ants, & humans use magnifying glass & flyswatter to kill bugs; no sex but one passing reference to “erotic fantasies” & brief discussions about ants having lots of children; no nudity but bugs wear no clothes; alcohol use & drunkenness; and, bureaucrat plots to commit mass murder & become dictator.\n\nIn the beautiful animated movie, ANTZ, lone ant Z is tired of the daily grind of conformity.
