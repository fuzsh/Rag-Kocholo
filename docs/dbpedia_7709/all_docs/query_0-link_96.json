Dua-Brown | Harrow, London | 05/08/2000\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"The Film: [Rating: 84%] Dreamworks challenger to the Disney ant favourite A Bug's Life arrives on a feature packed DVD complete with a truly sumptuous transfer. Ok, so it's a cartoon - but don't be put off since this one is loaded with far more wit and style than your average kiddie flick (isn't he in a A Bug's Life?) and features the vocal talents of Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Dan Aykroyd, Gene Hackman, Danny Glover, Jennifer Lopez, Sylvester Stallone, Christopher Walken, Anne Bancroft and a shed load more fine actors. Imagine this many actors in a live-action film, the fees, the makeup, the trailer size contests - I guess doing animation must be a welcome bit of fun, allowing dress-down days too!The story follows loner ant Z (pronounced zee, not zed!) who feels there should be more to life than his lot as a worker ant. Allen plays the lead, supported well be his best friend and soldier ant Weaver (Stallone). Z's path crosses that of the bored Princess Bala (Stone) whom he desperately wants to see again. Following a little persuasion, Z manages to trade places with Weaver for a place in the soldier's parade - held in front of the royalty! I don't want to give too much of the plot away since you're better off watching but Z's adventures to win the heart of the Princess, battle fierce termites Starship Troopers style, and his all round save-the-day antics are a treat for young and old alike. Kids will love this great cartoon but only adults will catch all of the humour and admire the truly stunning computer animation.It's a pity this was released only one month before Disney's ant based film and the subsequent press scrutiny they both received in the 'Ant Wars'. They are very different films, just both animated and about ants. Personally I rate Antz slightly higher but I also think that from a kid's point of view the adult nature of much of it's humour may put A Bug's Life out in front as a point decision winner. Take the easy route and give both pride of place in your DVD collection!The Picture: [Rating: 93%] Gob smacking! Awesome! Breath-taking! What more can be said about this 1.85:1 original aspect ratio transfer from an all digital source. Colours are to die for - see the Trash-topia sequence to see what I mean, black levels are spot on, detail is truly amazing, and there's not a single imperfection noticeable anywhere. There was some reported moans that the film was based underground too much, resulting in a too dark, earthy look - maybe an issue with a VHS copy but not here. This is what DVD and widescreen were made for! The Sound: [Rating: 82%] Again, absolutely awesome (do I have to add the word DUDE to truly convince?). Some have mentioned the drowning out of vocals during some of the terrifically loud action sequences but this didn't affect me, even on (or maybe because of) my 'pantz' audio set up. The Extras: [Rating: 70%] Directors Tim Johnson and Eric Darnel feature on an informative full-length audio commentary. There's a production featurette running under 5 minutes that is more interview soundbites than anything else. Much more revealing is the 11 minutes on The Basics of Computer Animation - focusing on the dance sequence and the water droplet, showing build up from storyboards to the finished, lighted & shaded animation. Brief but nice is the one minute on the Antz Facial System. Last of the documentaries is 10 minutes 26 seconds worth of wonderful hand-drawn art work showing the development of the Antz Character Design. There are four TV spots, along with the theatrical trailer, but the usual filmo's are blown away by a simple cast list. Finally there's also eight pages worth of production notes. Packaging the whole thing together is a fantastic menu system, fully animated with great transitions from one selection to another and all fully scored. Selecting the scene index from the front page (by moving the giant magnifying class!) will drop the 'camera' through the earth, taking you down to the Antz homeworld before displaying the four individually animated clips that represent four of the twenty six scenes available - top stuff! And Finally... [Overall Rating: 86%] Superb presentation - more meat on the extras would have been nice, but this is nit-picking since everything here is gold-plated!\"\n\nThe Best Bug Flick Around\n\nerugifog | Seattle, WA USA | 11/08/1999\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"Of the two big insect movies going (Antz and A Bug's Life), I have to say that Antz has the more entertaining story. A Bug's Life takes the trophy for best animation. It's vibrant colors and textures are stunning. Particularly impressive are the grasshopper characters whose exoskeletons look amazingly lifelike. But the story in Antz is much more appealing from an adult's point of view. It is more sophisticated, and the movie, quite frankly, is a lot funnier. Woody Allen brings his distinctively neurotic style of humor to the lead role of Z. Allen fans will love his performance here. Both movies are excellent in their own right and deserve a place in your movie collection.\"\n\nFirst thing-this is not a kid's movie!\n\nerugifog | 10/19/1999\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"I'm a college student who happened to see this movie at a friends a few days before classes started, and I was quite surprised with the movie. The story isn't exceptoionally ingenious, but I laughed out-loud a few times. Some of the complaints about this movie would be expected: the language, the violence, and even a few sexual refrences. Like I said before, this is not a kid's movie. Also, the complaint about all the brown tones is annoying, the brown is ment to be drab because it is only seen in the scenes with the worker ants. It's symbolic, but anyone who thought a movie with Woody Allen would be a kid's movie wouldn't understand that either.\"\n\nThe language was horrible they could of done without it!!!\n\nerugifog | 04/14/1999\n\n(1 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"This movie was not good. It should have been PG13 I don't want my Toddler watching the violence and bad language. We have the video, it was a gift I'm throwing it in the GARBAGE where it belongs!\"\n\nAn Ant for the more Mature\n\nerugifog | 03/26/1999\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"First let me say I loved A Bug's Life and I loved Antz, but let's not try to compare the two. Antz is NOT a kids movie. It is for a more Mature audience (hence the PG rating). And once you get the idea that Antz is a kids movie out of your head, you find that it is an excellent movie. The animation is wonderful. The vocal performances are excellent, especially those of Woody Allen, Gene Hackman, and Christopher Walken in a minor part. The 2 main characters (Zee and Bala) are funny and easy to relate to and, for the most part, you are genuinely interested in what happens to them. Seeing the real world from their perspective was very clever and entertaining. And one final note (pun intended here), the musical score to the movie is top notch.\""
