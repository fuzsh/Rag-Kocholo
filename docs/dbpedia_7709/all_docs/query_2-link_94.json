        "text": "I am obsessed with the comfy, cozy, iconic murder mystery television series Murder, She Wrote, starring Dame Angela Lansbury (may she rest in peace).\n\nI fell in love with it while watching with my mom growing up, and as an adult, I have seen the full series several times over. It's that perfect rainy day binge.\n\nAs you know, the character Jessica Fletcher (played by Lansbury) is a teacher-turned-mystery novelist and sleuth who solves some 60 murders in her home town of Cabot Cove, Maine. However murder follows her around the globe during her vacations and book tours during its 12 season run from 1984 to 1996.\n\nAlright, back to the fictional, quaint fishing village of Cabot Cove and the latest surrounding this charming Maine fishing village as the set of a new theatrical film version with big behind-the-scenes names attached.\n\nREAD MORE: The 10 Weirdest TV Shows Based on Beloved Movies\n\nAccording to Town and Country magazine, the classic show is in the works at Universal. The writers themselves known for Orange is the New Black and Dumb Money, Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo, confirmed they've even finished the script.\n\nSo when can we expect it?\n\nAccording to , Lauren and Rebecca excitedly signed on for the movie before that writers strike last year in 2023 so the project is now behind schedule by nearly a year.\n\nMeanwhile, who will play Jessica Fletcher, since Angela Lansbury passed away in October of 2022 at aged 96 or will there be a new character? Maybe a relative of Jessica's will solve a murder or two.\n\nAccording to the ScreenRant website, the producer is Academy Award-winning Amy Pascal of Pascal Pictures, known for the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Molly's Game, The Post, and Little Women.\n\nOther than that we haven't heard any new updates about this film adaption of our beloved detective series as we wait to learn more."
