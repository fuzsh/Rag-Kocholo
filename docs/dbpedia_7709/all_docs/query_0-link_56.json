        "text": "“Antz” is a fun movie for adults and for children, but occasionally lacks originality. The animation is definitely fine, but still nothing compared to what Disney can and has done.\n\nOctober 5, 2023\n\n[Antz is] a bizarre, tonally dissonant mess of a movie. Apparently we were willing to overlook such issues 22 years ago.\n\nMarch 27, 2020\n\nIn a world of cookie-cutter movies at least it tries a bunch of weird stuff.\n\nMarch 12, 2019\n\nAmid all the ingenuity and smartness, the work fails to move and contains little wonderment - ironically appropriating the zealous industry of its on-screen ants.\n\nDecember 2, 2018\n\nIt's the noble attempt by the doomed PDI to announce its worthiness to the world\n\nJuly 29, 2018\n\nKids may be puzzled by rebellious worker ants chanting Marxist slogans, but their parental guides may welcome the relief from the prevailing blandness of family films.\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nThe artwork is spectacular, vocal performances uniformly capable and the jokes appealing to both adults and children.\n\nJune 21, 2017"
