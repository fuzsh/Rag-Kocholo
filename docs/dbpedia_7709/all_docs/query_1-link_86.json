        "text": "Aron Warner won an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature as a producer of the blockbuster Shrek and has also worked on films such as Trolls and Book of Life. We join him in his Hollywood studio as he animates a film solely for a China audience.\n\nChinese markets have opened up to Hollywood but Aaron reveals that making a successful film in China is quite different to the normal Hollywood animation. For a start the lead has to be male, the story has be about a collective experience rather than from the point of view of the individual and Aron has to have in mind that instead of parents taking children to the cinema, the general trend in China is that young adults take their aging parents to the cinema.\n\nNot only do we get a fascinating insight into the production of an animation we also get a greater understanding of how the Chinese audience differs, contrasting the different cultures Hollywood is trying to animate for."
