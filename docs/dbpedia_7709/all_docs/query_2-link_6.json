        "text": "Aron J. Warner is an American producer. Along with producing the first three films, he performed the voice of the Big Bad Wolf in the Shrek series.\n\nBefore Shrek[]\n\nPrior to the production of Shrek, Aron Warner worked as a production coordinator, manager, and supervisor for various live-action films. His biggest roles during this time was producer for Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, and executive producer for Tank Girl. He was also the production executive for Titanic, which was the highest grossing film of all time for 12 years. After his tenure at Twentieth Century Fox, he joined PDI/DreamWorks to produce the computer-animated feature, Antz.\n\nShrek[]\n\nAfter the success of Antz, Warner would join the production of Shrek as one of the producers (sharing credit with Jeffery Katzenberg and John H. Williams). Despite the troublesome production cycle, the film would release as one of the highest grossing films of the year and earn critical acclaim. This would also make him the first recipient of the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Following the first film, he would serve as the producer for Shrek 2 and Shrek the Third. He would also help co-write the latter with director Chris Miller, and well-known screenwriting duo Jeffery Price & Peter S. Seaman. He would then act as an executive producer of Shrek Forever After and receive special thanks for Puss in Boots. In addition, he was the executive producer of Shrek the Halls and was given a \"Special Thanks\" credit in Scared Shrekless.\n\nAfter Shrek[]\n\nSince the release of Shrek Forever After, Aron Warner moved to Reel FX Animation Studios, where he would executive produce Free Birds and The Book of Life. His first major producing credit came in 2021 with the release of Sony Pictures Animation's Wish Dragon, which he co-produced with Jackie Chan.\n\nTrivia[]"
