        "text": "DreamWorks Animation has enjoyed a roller coaster ride since its inception in 1994.\n\nFounded by director Steven Spielberg, former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg and music mogul David Geffen., the studio had had its shares of hits and misses over the years. DWA won Hollywood’s first Oscar for Best Animated Feature with “Shrek” and has launched a total of five film franchises so far, and yet it has struggled in recent years, often finding itself in Pixar’s shadow.\n\nWith two of its founders focused on other pursuits, DreamWorks Animation has been forced to reconfigure itself under the leadership of Katzenberg, who has been actively shopping the studio in recent years.\n\nJoin TheWrap on a trip down memory lane and remember, the last chapter of this book has yet to be written, as a $3 billion deal with Comcast looms in the distance.\n\nTHE TIMELINE\n\nOct. 12, 1994 – DreamWorks Animation is founded by director Steven Spielberg, former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg and music mogul David Geffen.\n\nOct. 2, 1998 – DWA produces its first feature, “Antz,” featuring an all-star voice cast including Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Jennifer Lopez and Sylvester Stallone.

The studio’s first franchise is born.\n\nMay 19, 2004 – DWA releases its most expensive film yet, “Shrek 2.” It proves to be worth the gamble, as the sequel pulls in $919 million worldwide, proving the first film’s success was no fluke.\n\nOct. 27, 2004 – DWA is spun off into a publicly traded company with Katzenberg in charge, and Spielberg and Geffen reduced to investors and consultants.\n\nMay 27, 2005 – The company launches its second franchise with “Madagascar,” which pulls in $532 million worldwide.\n\nOct. 7, 2005 – After partnering with Aardman Animations on the 2000 release of “Chicken Run,” DWA reteams with the British studio on “Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,” which goes on to win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature the following year.
