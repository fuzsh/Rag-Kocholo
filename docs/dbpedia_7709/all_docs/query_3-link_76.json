        "text": "CMU’s Entertainment Technology Center is recruiting for a new Director. This is an amazing graduate program that encompasses all the things we love - innovation, teaching, leadership… and of course, entertainment and technology! Details below if you’re interested, and please pass it along if you know a great candidate. https://lnkd.in/g9SWwmXd\n\nI’m excited to announce that ETC is launching our Executive Education Program this summer 2021. I’ll be leading this endeavor working with ETC and CMU faculty as well as industry experts. This program is inspired by our research and work in Creative Chaos and it’s aimed at industry professionals who are already leaders. The goal is to expand our participants' creative leadership abilities so they can improve their organization’s ability to successfully innovate. The program will be June 2 -10, though we’ll get the weekend off, so seven pretty intense days. All online this time, but that also allows us to be available to a larger group of people, and bring in guests who might not be able to travel otherwise. More information at https://lnkd.in/eJWaeNf If you know people who could benefit, please pass the information along. DM me with questions."
