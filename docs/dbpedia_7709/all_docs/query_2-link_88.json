        "text": "This meme is a way to discuss the books that have made their way to film, or to talk about the books we wish would be made into a movie. You are open to talk about any book out there in any way that you want. For example: Who would you have play the leads in the movie? Who would direct? Animated or live action? Etc.\n\nThis week my meme will focus on SHATTER ME by Tahereh Mafi. In this post I not only cast the roles of my favorite characters (including the enigmatic Warner), but I also created a movie poster! This is one book series that I believe would look amazing on film! Action, romance, X-man-esque super powers! What’s not to love?\n\nLet me know what you think of my cast in the comments below!\n\nShatter Me by Tahereh Mafi\n\nPublished by HarperCollins, HarperTeen on November 15, 2011\n\nGenres: Dystopian, Love & Romance, Science Fiction, Young Adult\n\nBuy the Book Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Goodreads\n\nJuliette hasnÃ¢ÂÂt touched anyone in exactly 264 days.\n\nThe last time she did, it was an accident, but The Reestablishment locked her up for murder. No one knows why JulietteÃ¢ÂÂs touch is fatal. As long as she doesnÃ¢ÂÂt hurt anyone else, no one really cares. The world is too busy crumbling to pieces to pay attention to a 17-year-old girl. Diseases are destroying the population, food is hard to find, birds donÃ¢ÂÂt fly anymore, and the clouds are the wrong color.\n\nThe Reestablishment said their way was the only way to fix things, so they threw Juliette in a cell. Now so many people are dead that the survivors are whispering war Ã¢ÂÂ and The Reestablishment has changed its mind. Maybe Juliette is more than a tortured soul stuffed into a poisonous body. Maybe sheÃ¢ÂÂs exactly what they need right now.\n\nJuliette has to make a choice: Be a weapon. Or be a warrior.\n\nJULIETTE Ferrars – Odeya Rush\n\nJuliette FerrarsÃÂ is the main character and the narrator of the SHATTER ME trilogy. She has a lethal touch and was locked up in a Asylum.\n\nOdeya Rush has the look down pat. I also think that the exotic look she has going on would separate her from the rest of the cast. Just look at her eyes! Perfect!! Not to mention, Odeya Rush has landed some big roles, including the film adaptation of The Giver, Mary: Mother of Christ and Goosebumps alongside Jack Black.\n\nAaron Warner – Hunter Parrish\n\nAaron WarnerÃÂ is the son of Supreme Commander Anderson and Leila Warner, and the leader of the Sector 45.ÃÂ He has two tattoos: The word IGNITE on his back and the other is a Shakespeare’s quote: Hell is empty, and all the devils are here.\n\nHunter Parrish is “practically perfect in every way”, wouldn’t you agree? I picture him when I picture Warner – blonde hair, green eyes – and then I have to wipe the drool off my chin just thinking about Warner… Hunter has starred in films such as 17 Again (with Zac Efron and Matthew Perry), It’s Complicated and Still Alice.\n\nAdam Kent – Matt Lanter\n\nAdam isÃÂ Juliette’s love interest. He has known her since they were 8 years old; and on his own words, he has always felt attracted by her.\n\nMatt Lanter is such a little cutie, isn’t he? With dark blonde hair and blue eyes, he’s perfect for the brooding, yet romantic Adam. He’s also a bit more built than Hunter Parrish, which is how I imagine Adam as compared to Warner. Matt has starred as the voice of Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Clone Wars and as Edward Sullen in Vampires Suck.\n\nKenji Kishimoto – Booboo Stewart\n\nKenji is a very straight forward person and citizen of Omega Point. He tends to make everything a joke, but eventually becomes serious when necessary.ÃÂ Kenji has the ability to become invisible.\n\nBooboo Stewart. The little boy who has grown into quite the… stunning… young man. Part Japanese, part irish, this ex-werewolf from the Twilight Saga would make a humorous and aptly-aged Kenji. (Honestly, I have a hard time thinking of Asian-American actors who would fit the part. Can you think of anyone better?)\n\nCastle – Kevin Costner\n\nCastleÃÂ is the leader and founder of Omega Point andÃÂ has an extraordinary telekinetic ability. He is like a father to many of the Omega Point citizens.\n\nKevin Costner is (in my honest opinion) the perfect fit for the role of Castle. I was looking for someone who displays authority, but is also a bit soft around the edges. He would also do well to dispel the comparisons made between Castle and Professor X from X-Men. My favorite films starring Kevin Costner include Dances With Wolves, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, The Bodyguard and Man of Steel.\n\nAnderson – Jude Law\n\nSupreme Commander Anderson is one of the founders of The Reestablishment and commands the North America division. He is described as handsome yet deadly. He is also a ruthless, merciless, sadistic leader and father.\n\nJude Law has the look, he has the allure, he has just the right finesse to pull off the sick, sadistic enigma that is Anderson. I think he could even take the man above and beyond anything that the author could possibly dream up. Plus, doesn’t he look as though he could be Hunter Parrish’s daddy? Jude Law is best known for his roles in Cold Mountain, as Dr. Watson in Sherlock Homes and the voice of Pitch in The Rise of the Guardians.\n\nAbout Tahereh Mafi\n\nTahereh Mafi is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of the SHATTER ME series. She was born in a small city somewhere in Connecticut and currently resides in Santa Monica, California, where she drinks too much caffeine and finds the weather to be just a little too perfect for her taste.\n\nWhen unable to find a book, she can be found reading candy wrappers, coupons, and old receipts.\n\nSHATTER ME was her first series.\n\nThanks for reading my MAKE IT A MOVIE!\n\nIf you decide to make your ownÃÂ Make it a MovieÃÂ post this week, please add the URL in the Linky below.
