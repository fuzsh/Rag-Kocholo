        "text": "Finally—an animated movie that is truly made for adults. Not for little tots, but rather teens and adults, “Antz” is both amuzing and amazing.\n\n“Z” (voice of Woody Allen) is an ant who is unhappy with his life of conformity and struggling for the common good. Z wants to break out—be different—make some choices for himself, but he sees no real way of doing this. Meanwhile, Princess Bala (voice of Sharon Stone) is also dissatisfied with her lot in life and wants to experience life outside her usual confines. Bala decides to sneak into a dance for the workers and ends up dancing with Z who has no clue of her position in royalty until they part. Z is quite stricken with Bala but has no chance of ever seeing her again until his buddy, Weaver (voice of Sylvester Stallone in what I thought was his best role to date) agrees to switch places with Z on a day that he is to stand before the Queen. The switch turns bad, however, as Z ends up in battle. Eventually and through no fault of his own, Z ends up a hero to most of the other ants.\n\nThe computer animation was wonderful, though not worth the hype. The humor is excellent; on an adult level, but not unsuitable for children. There was quite a bit of humor that kids just will not understand. I viewed “Antz” with a group of middle school kids. The guys hated it (boring, slow and too much romance) but the girls liked it. I sat near several smaller children and heard very little laughter from them.\n\nOn a Christian level, this is at the top of Hollywood produced movies. The language was in line with a John Wayne western. There were just a few inappropriate words and it does contain 2 or 3 instances of taking the Lord’s name in vain. Other than a fleeting sexual reference, there were no sexual scenes. Just good, clean, intelligent humor.\n\nIf you do intend to take small children, there is a battle scene that is quite intense and involves many dismembered ants. Go see it, but leave the little ones with a friend."
