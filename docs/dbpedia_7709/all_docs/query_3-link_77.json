        "text": "One of the most painfully underrated Pixar movies of all time is A Bug’s Life. It was the second Pixar film that was made just 3 years after Toy Story made its debut. The studio, after converting from a computer business to a computer animation business, experimented with short films first to see how they could perfect their skill each time. Once they felt like they had a good handle on how to create an immersive, full-length feature film, John Lasseter created Toy Story in 1995. Things progressed every year after that with computer animation, and the animators found ways to create full-length films in a cheaper and faster way. A staff of about 200 people came together to create A Bug’s Life, with the goal of making it bigger and better than Toy Story.\n\nAccording to supervising technical director Eben Ostby, he said that working with Buzz and Woody was a challenge as both characters are quite complex, but facing the task of animating several more detailed lead characters in A Bug’s Life was even more challenging. One way to combat this obstacle was the technique of having the animators actually act out some scenes, much like Disney has always done with reference models. Once character designs were complete, background art was added, along with colour, texture, and lighting.\n\nThe World from an Ant’s Point of View\n\nIt didn’t take flying to a whole other country to do the research about the chosen location for the film, it took as little as stepping out into your backyard and getting low to the ground to see all of the details in the leaves, grass, and dirt. The team at Pixar spent a lot of time out in the nature, looking at the way leaves would naturally fall on the ground to create roofs and floors for ants, how the grass leans over to create a sheltered area, and how daring a trip across cracked mud would be for an ant. Many of the photos and videos that were taken for reference made it almost exactly as it was into the film. They also studied the bugs themselves, how the ants would carry things on their backs for that opening scene, how a beetles wings would fly for Dim, and how the ants and grasshoppers interacted.\n\nThe Characters of A Bug’s Life\n\nThe first thing an animation studio must do before even thinking about creating the whole movie is figuring out the character design and who will voice each character to make them come to life. Many of the characters started out looking slightly different than what we see on the big screen, mostly with their proportions. Hopper started out with a more triangular head and different shaped legs. Flik started out as a red ant, and his eyes and smile went through different changes. The characters that went through the most changes from their conception were Francis, Dim, and P.T Flea. The Queen, Rosie, and Princess Atta saw the least amount of changes. To have a better look at each character to finalize their designs, scale models of each one was made.\n\nSome of the challenges the animators ran into that they didn’t have to face during Toy Story was figuring out how insect legs would all move at different times to make it look more realistic, and how flapping wings would look on the screen without being blurry. These challenges were brought up during the creations of Rosie, Dim, and Gypsy. Every character went through a facial test to see how things like the wrinkles in their face, the corners of their mouths, and the closing of their eyelids all interacted with each other. This was a huge project in comparison to Toy Story, because once again, almost all of the A Bug’s Life characters were stars in this film.\n\nThe Voice Actors of A Bug’s Life\n\nOur hero of the film, Flik, is voiced by Dave Foley. Foley was a stand-up comedian from Toronto, Ontario. He was a part of a sketch comedy group called The Kids in the Hall, whom also had their own television series from 1988 to 1995. He had worked on a few other television shows through the 1990s, and was approached to play Flik, to which he took as a surprise.\n\nPrincess Atta was voiced by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who is best known for her work on Saturday Night Live and Elaine on Seinfeld. Julia was a huge fan of Toy Story, and wanted to be a part of what Pixar was working on next.\n\nPhyllis Diller took on the role as The Queen, whom she did a reading for and got the part almost immediately afterward. Diller is a very popular comedian and actress, who starred in TV and movies from the 1950s until the 2010s. She is best known for her own show, The Phyllis Diller Show in 1966, and her work on The Night Gallery, The Love Boat, and The Bold and the Beautiful.\n\nHayden Panettiere played the role of Dot at only 10 years old. It was her first voice acting role ever, and she went on to have a very fruitful and productive life as an actress and voice actress. She is best known as Claire Bennet in the TV series Heroes, and as Juliette Barnes in the series Nashville."
