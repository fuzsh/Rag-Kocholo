        "text": "Companies of all sizes use Agile Scrum methodology for its ability to provide high-end collaboration and efficiency for project-based work. Agile and Scrum are two different methods that can be used separately, However, their combined benefits make this methodology the most popular use of Agile. Here’s the complete guide to Agile Scrum methodology.\n\nDid You Know?Did you know\n\nAgile and Scrum can be used separately but their combined benefits make the methodology popular.\n\nHow does Agile Scrum work?\n\nAgile Scrum methodology combines the Agile philosophy and the Scrum framework. Agile means “incremental,” allowing teams to develop projects in small increments. Scrum is one of the many types of Agile methodology. It’s known for breaking down projects into sizable chunks called “sprints.” Agile Scrum methodology is good for businesses that must finish specific projects quickly.\n\nAgile Scrum methodology is a project management system that relies on incremental development. Each iteration consists of two- to four-week sprints, where the goal of each sprint is to build the most important features first and come out with a potentially deliverable product. More features are built into the product in subsequent sprints and are adjusted based on stakeholder and customer feedback between sprints.\n\nWhile other project management methods emphasize building an entire product from start to finish in one operation, Agile Scrum methodology focuses on delivering several product iterations to provide stakeholders with the highest business value in the least amount of time.\n\nAgile Scrum methodology encourages faster product development because each set of goals must be completed within each sprint’s time frame. It also requires frequent planning and goal setting, which helps the Scrum team focus on the current sprint’s objectives and increase productivity.\n\nWhat is Agile?\n\nAgile is a process that allows a team to manage a project more efficiently by breaking it down into several stages. Each stage allows for consistent stakeholder collaboration to promote steady improvements at every stage.\n\nKey TakeawayKey takeaway\n\nAgile lets a team manage a project more efficiently by breaking it down into several stages.\n\nWhat are the values of Agile?\n\nAgile was first described in the Agile Manifesto in 2000 by a group of developers seeking a new method of writing software. The manifesto cites four values:\n\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\n\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\n\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\n\nResponding to change over following a plan\n\nWhat are the 12 principles of Agile?\n\nThe Agile Manifesto also enacted 12 principles about software development and was later reconfigured to fit a broader perspective of users:\n\nCustomer satisfaction\n\nEarly and continuous delivery\n\nEmbrace change\n\nFrequent delivery\n\nCollaboration of businesses and developers\n\nMotivated individuals\n\nFace-to-face conversation\n\nFunctional products\n\nTechnical excellence\n\nSimplicity\n\nSelf-organized teams\n\nRegulation, reflection and adjustment\n\nWhat is Scrum?\n\nIn short, Scrum is a framework for effective workplace collaboration in teams working on complex products. Scrum is a type of Agile technology that consists of meetings, roles and tools to help teams working on complex projects collaborate and better structure and manage their workload. Although it is most often used by software development teams, Scrum can benefit any team working toward a common goal.\n\nWho can benefit from Scrum?\n\nWhile Scrum can be helpful in a wide variety of businesses and projects, these are the most likely beneficiaries:\n\nComplicated projects: Scrum methodology is ideal for projects that require teams to complete a backlog. Scrum breaks down each process into bite-sized chunks that can make a complex project easier.\n\nCompanies that value results: Scrum is also beneficial to companies that value results over a process’s documented progress. This is because Scrum is focused on efficiency and innovation to drive results instead of a detailed, rigid process.\n\nCompanies that cater to customers: Scrum can help companies develop products according to customer preferences and specifications. It is adaptable to change, making it vital when responding to customer requests.\n\nWhat are the benefits of Agile Scrum methodology?\n\nThe collective benefits of Agile Scrum methodology include the following:\n\nFlexibility and adaptability\n\nCreativity and innovation\n\nLower costs\n\nQuality improvement\n\nOrganizational synergy\n\nEmployee satisfaction\n\nCustomer satisfaction\n\nFlexibility is perhaps the most significant benefit of Agile Scrum methodology. In the sprint-based model, the Scrum team typically receives stakeholder feedback after each sprint. If problems are found or changes must be made, the Scrum team can adjust product goals easily and quickly during future sprints to provide more valuable iterations. This way, stakeholders are happier because they get exactly what they want after being involved every step of the way.\n\nCompare this with traditional project management systems where stakeholders do not provide frequent feedback and time is wasted making changes to the product halfway through development. Even worse, teams may need to start from scratch after the product has already been built.\n\nTipTip\n\nYou'll need an internal Scrum expert or an outside business consultant to implement Agile Scrum methodology. Agile Scrum methodology involves precise execution and serious problems could ensue if Scrum principles aren't applied correctly.\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of Agile Scrum methodology?\n\nWhile there are several benefits to this methodology, potential disadvantages include the following:\n\nUnpredictability in planning\n\nIncreased time demands\n\nHeightened stakeholder commitment\n\nDocumentation challenges\n\nRisk of project deviation\n\nThis methodology’s unpredictability during project planning is a significant drawback. Unlike traditional approaches, Agile Scrum’s emphasis on flexibility can make it challenging to accurately estimate and manage project resources and timelines.\n\nAdditionally, while this methodology promotes communication and teamwork, it can create additional time and energy demands on participants. Constant interaction and iteration — hallmarks of Agile development — can unexpectedly extend project timelines.\n\nBecause the Agile Scrum methodology requires stakeholder commitment and alignment at all levels, any discord or lack of involvement can disrupt a project’s progress and compromise its overall quality. These challenges underscore the importance of careful planning and proactive management strategies to ensure significant obstacles don’t arise.\n\nWhat are the different roles in Agile Scrum methodology?\n\nAgile Scrum methodology consists of two sets of roles: core roles, known as “pigs,” and ancillary roles, known as “chickens.”\n\nThere are three core roles: Scrum master, product owner and Scrum team. These people are committed to the Scrum project:\n\nScrum master: The Scrum master is the facilitator of the Scrum development process. In addition to holding daily meetings with the Scrum team, the Scrum master ensures Scrum rules are being enforced and applied as intended. The Scrum master’s responsibilities also include coaching and motivating the team, removing impediments to sprints and ensuring the team has the best possible conditions to meet its goals and produce deliverable products.\n\nProduct owner: The product owner represents stakeholders (typically customers). To ensure the Scrum team delivers value to stakeholders and the business, the product owner determines product expectations, records changes to the product and administers a Scrum backlog — a detailed and constantly updated to-do list for the Scrum project. The product owner is also responsible for prioritizing goals for each sprint based on their value to stakeholders to ensure the most critical and deliverable features are built in each iteration.\n\nScrum team: The Scrum team is a self-organized group of three to nine individuals with the business, design, analytical and development skills to carry out the actual work, solve problems and produce deliverable products. Scrum team members self-administer tasks and are jointly responsible for meeting each sprint’s goals.\n\nAncillary roles belong to other stakeholders who are involved in but not committed to the Scrum project. Typically, ancillary role players include customers, management and C-suite executives who consult, report progress and gather feedback to improve the project and help deliver the highest value possible.\n\nWhat is the training for Scrum and Agile?\n\nManagers and employees can enroll in project management training for both Agile and Scrum through various online and in-person courses. Many educational training courses result in certification in Agile or Scrum methodologies. Agile training provides trainees with the basic knowledge of Agile and how to implement it with the rest of their team. Scrum provides similar training, including the basic Agile overview. However, this training caters to the Scrum framework.\n\nTo become a certified Scrum master (CSM) or certified Scrum product owner (CSPO), you must first prepare and learn the basic details of Scrum through videos or a simple internet search. Next, find a suitable CSM or CSPO course, either through your workplace or another internet search. Once you’ve completed the course, you usually must pass an exam to become certified. After certification, you can lead your team through the Scrum process or provide Scrum product details.\n\nDid You Know?Did you know\n\nThe best corporate training and development certifications, including project management certs like the CSM and CSPO, can help you expand your information technology qualifications and stand out from the crowd as a job candidate.\n\nWhat are the differences between Scrum and Agile?\n\nAlthough Scrum and Agile are similar, they have some key differences, including the following:\n\nScrum values rigidity while Agile is more flexible.\n\nAgile leaders play a vital role while Scrum promotes a cross-functional team that is self-functioning.\n\nAgile involves face-to-face interactions between cross-functional team members while Scrum involves daily stand-up meetings.\n\nAgile is meant to be kept simple while Scrum can be innovative and experimental.\n\nScrum delivers shorter, separate projects while Agile delivers everything at the end of the process.\n\nWhat are alternatives to Agile Scrum methodology?\n\nSeveral other project management styles are used across industries to address organizations’ specific needs and process preferences. Below are some of the most prominent alternatives to the Agile Scrum methodology.\n\nWaterfall\n\nThe Waterfall methodology is a traditional sequential approach to project management. It gets its name from the cascading nature of project phases, where progress flows steadily downward, like a waterfall.\n\nIn this method, each project phase follows a linear progression, with distinct phases, such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing and maintenance. Unlike the Agile Scrum methodology, where iterations allow for flexibility and adaptation, Waterfall follows a structured, predetermined plan.\n\nLean\n\nThe Lean methodology, inspired by principles derived from manufacturing, emphasizes the elimination of waste and supports continuous improvement. While Agile Scrum focuses on iterative development, Lean streamlines processes to deliver value efficiently and effectively.\n\nThe Lean methodology encourages identifying and eliminating any activities that don’t add maximum value to the end product. However, similar to Agile Scrum, Lean may require significant organizational buy-in and workflow shifts to realize its benefits fully.\n\nRapid application development (RAD)\n\nRAD is an incremental software development approach that prioritizes quick prototyping and iteration. RAD emphasizes user feedback and involvement throughout the development process, allowing for timely iterations and adjustments based on stakeholder input.\n\nThis approach differs from other methods in that RAD aims to accelerate the time to market by eliminating lengthy development cycles and delivering functional prototypes early in the process."
