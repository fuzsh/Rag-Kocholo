        "text": "Agile and Waterfall are two well-known project management methodologies. Both of them are popular in software development but each is best suited for different types of projects. The main difference is that Waterfall is a linear system of working that requires the team to complete each project phase before moving on to the next one while Agile encourages the team to work simultaneously on different phases of the project.\n\nAgile vs. Waterfall: At a Glance\n\nAgile Methodology\n\nApproach: Frequent stakeholder interaction\n\nFlexibility: High\n\nRequires: Team initiative and short-term deadlines\n\nAgile methodology was developed as a response to Waterfall’s more rigid structure. As a result, it’s a much more fluid form of project management. A software development project can take years to complete, and technology can change significantly during that time. Agile was developed as a flexible method that welcomes incorporating changes of direction even late in the process, as well as accounting for stakeholders’ feedback throughout the process.\n\nIn Agile, the team will work on phases of the project concurrently, often with short-term deadlines. Additionally, the team, rather than a project manager, drives the project’s direction. This can empower the team to be motivated and more productive, but also requires a more self-directed team.\n\nWaterfall Methodology\n\nApproach: Hands-off; goals and outcome established from the beginning\n\nFlexibility: Low\n\nRequires: Completing deliverables to progress to the next phase\n\nWaterfall methodology is a linear form of project management ideal for projects where the end result is clearly established from the beginning of the project. The expectations for the project and the deliverables of each stage are clear and are required in order to progress to the next phase.\n\nAgile and Waterfall Comparison Chart\n\nWaterfall is a linear project progression, so it’s best suited for projects with a defined end goal. If a project owner has a clear and specific vision of an app, for example, and is confident it will not change throughout the project development, Waterfall methodologies could be a good system to follow.\n\nMeanwhile, Agile leaves a lot of room to adapt and change course as the project develops. It’s better suited for projects where the outcome may be dependent on more research or testing.\n\nThe budget for projects using Waterfall methodologies tends to be less flexible because the project is mapped out from the beginning. With Agile, there is more room to change direction as the project develops, so the budget is also subject to change. Similarly, the timeline with Waterfall is set from the start, while it’s more flexible with Agile and dependent on how the project develops.\n\nWaterfall vs. Agile: How To Choose the Right Methodology for Your Project\n\nThere are several factors to consider when you are choosing between Waterfall and Agile. Here are a few questions to consider:\n\nDoes your project require strict regulations or requirements? Waterfall is better suited for projects with regulations or requirements because each phase’s deliverables and strict procedures ensure that they are met. For instance, the Department of Defense and the aerospace industry are a couple of industries that would more likely use Waterfall over Agile, since the requirements are a safety factor. Dr. Chris Mattmann, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer (CTIO) at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told Forbes Advisor that “agile methodology is used more for IT companies, [companies] that fail fast and move fast, types of places where you can proceed in parallel in different phases.”\n\nWhen choosing between Agile and Waterfall, consider how involved the project owners or stakeholders will be in the project. Agile is better suited for projects where stakeholders are closely involved every step of the way. Waterfall is a more structured project management method and does not lend itself to the same type of flexibility.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTo summarize, Agile and Waterfall are two different management methodologies best suited for different types of projects. If you clearly understand the project outcomes from the beginning, Waterfall may be the best fit. Waterfall is a better method when a project must meet strict regulations as it requires deliverables for each phase before proceeding to the next one.\n\nAlternatively, Agile is better suited for teams that plan on moving fast, experimenting with direction and don’t know how the final project will look before they start. Agile is flexible and requires a collaborative and self-motivated team, plus frequent check-ins with business owners and stakeholders about the progress."
