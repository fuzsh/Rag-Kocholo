        "text": "Definition of Agile Software Management:\n\nAgile Software Development is a project management approach. It is characterized by developing increments of software in frequent iterations (sprints) based on evolving requirements.\n\nSynonyms for Agile Software Management:\n\nAgile Methods, Agile Software Development, Agile project management\n\nHistory of Agile Software Management:\n\nAgile or Agile Software Management is an umbrella term for a number of project methodologies, Scrum being the most widely used. The concept of Agile was born in 2001 when a team of independent software developers gathered at a ski lodge in Snowbird, Utah to discuss alternative approaches to the traditional, top-down management, waterfall method of completing software development. Originally referred to as lightweight software development methodologies, the developers adopted the term Agile to reflect its lithe, lean style of project management, characterized by frequent iterations. By the end of the weekend, the developers had produced the Agile Manifesto, which included 4 values and 12 principles for Agile software development.\n\nHow Agile is Used:\n\nSelf-organized, cross-functional development teams work in close collaboration with customers and stakeholders to add value to every step of the process, targeting a goal of continuous improvement.\n\nAgile project management has evolved into a number of project styles. Scrum ist probably the most popular agile method. Others include:\n\nKanban\n\nExtreme Programming (XP)\n\nCrystal\n\nDynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)\n\nLean\n\nFeature-Driven Development (FDD)\n\nIt is possible to assign a fixed cost to Agile projects due to Agileâ€™s focus on feature prioritization and timeboxed iterations. If nothing of the budget is left before all features are included, those features will be developed and implemented at a later time. Agile teams always work on the highest-priority items within the sprint timebox, so that the customer receives the right product to meet their requirements.\n\nBenefits of Agile Methods:"
