        "text": "Agile project management is a methodology that focuses on collaboration and constantly improving a product or service. It's often used in software development. Although this methodology was used as early as the 1950s, it wasnât until 2001 that a group of software developers published the Agile Manifesto, which established the 12 principles and four values of Agile.Â\n\nAgile isnât only for software developers, though; it applies to other fields such as marketing, HR, and finance. The Project Management Institute reports a median US salary of $80,000 for a project manager with less than three years of experience, $110,000 for one with 5 to 10 years of experience, and $150,000 for one with 20 or more years of experience [1].\n\nWhat is Agile project management?\n\nAgile is a project management approach that uses short cycles, often called sprints or iterations, to develop a product or service. In Agile, the team plays a large role. The projectâs tasks or conditions often change, and the project team produces more frequent deliverables. The Agile method moves more fluidly and quickly than other approaches to project management.Â\n\nLearn more about some of the benefits of Agile from a technical program manager at Google:\n\nAgile project management principles and values\n\nThe Agile Manifesto outlines 12 principles that emphasize customer satisfaction through early and frequent software delivery. It values adaptability and collaboration, welcoming changes, and working closely with customers and developers throughout the project.\n\nAgile teams prioritize working software, face-to-face communication, and sustainable development practices. They focus on technical excellence and simplicity while empowering self-organizing teams to deliver the best results.\n\nThese principles align with four core Agile values:\n\nIndividuals and interaction over processes and tools,\n\nW orking software over documentation,\n\nCustomer collaboration over contracts, and\n\nR esponding to change over following a plan.\n\nRead more: Project Management Terms: A to Z Glossary\n\nWho is part of an Agile project management team?\n\nThe team's roles depend on the methodology used, which includes Scrum, Kanban, Crystal, XP, Lean, and others. The project or program manager is a key figure on an Agile project management team. Scrum roles include Scrum Master, product owner (or product manager), and development team, for example.Â\n\nThe Agile method emphasizes face-to-face communication, so many teams work in one location, though some organizations have a remote workplace with team members in various locations. Agile teams should contain motivated individuals with the resources needed to fulfill their roles. The roles within the team depend on which Agile methodology an organization uses.\n\nRead more: What Is a Development Team?\n\nCommon Agile project management methodologies\n\nAgile teams benefit from using one workflow. Some Agile teams use Scrum, while others prefer Kanban, Lean, or other methods. Some teams combine Agile with the Waterfall approach, which means they may use a traditional workflow for stakeholders, but the team uses a Scrum approach for its work.Â\n\nScrum\n\nScrum is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex projects. Scrum, which got its name from rugby teams in training, emphasizes cross-functional teams that are self-organizing and open-minded. Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland developed Scrum in the 1990s and wrote the Scrum Guide to help others use this project management framework.Â\n\nThe theory behind Scrum is leanness and empiricism: the idea that true knowledge comes from actual, lived experience. The five values of Scrum are commitment to achieving goals, courage, focus, openness, and respect.\n\nScrum requires the roles of Scrum Master, product owner, and the development team. A Scrum Master is the person on the team who helps everyone understand and implement Scrum, and the person is responsible for the Scrum teamâs effectiveness. The Scrum Master:Â\n\nCoaches the team on self-management\n\nHelps the organization implement Scrum\n\nHelps team members remove impediments\n\nFacilitates communication with stakeholders\n\nMakes sure meetings are productive and positive\n\nSupports the product owner in efficiently maintaining the product backlog\n\nHelps teams focus on completing high-quality project outcomes\n\nThe product owner maintains the product backlog, a living document that contains a prioritized list of features for the product or service. It lists the value, order, description, and estimate of effort for each item. The product owner refines the backlog regularly so that the Scrum team can work effectively.\n\nKanban\n\nKanban is another framework used in Agile and DevOps software development. Kanban emphasizes transparent visual feedback, real-time communication, and maximized efficiency. Work tasks are shown on a Kanban board, which is created using project management software such as Jira. Each column on the Kanban board represents the phases or steps tasks must pass through from to-do to completion. Each task or item on a Kanban board is represented on its own card, which shows its critical information, including possible screenshots. Kanban templates allow users to customize their dashboards and have views such as a flow diagram, charts, and other reports.Â\n\nToyota began using the Kanban method in the 1930s in its car factories, and today it can be applied to any industry. Software teams use the same principles to match the work in progress (WIP) to the teamâs capacity.Â\n\nLean\n\nLean is a collection of tools that help teams improve their processes. In Lean, the goal is to cut out waste and inefficiency. According to the Project Management Institute, the difference between Lean and Agile is that Lean has more structure: âLeanâs focus on continuous process improvement, based on an analytical systems and process analysis of performance adds significant value to the generally more informal, single project focused intuitive approach of Agileâ [2].\n\nAdditional Agile methodologies include:\n\neXtreme Programming (XP)\n\nCrystal\n\nScaled Agile Framework (SAFe)\n\nFeature-driven development (FDD)\n\nDynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)\n\nAdaptive Project Framework (ADF)\n\n5 stages of the Agile project management lifecycle\n\nAgile project management typically involves five key phases, often referred to as the Agile lifecycle. These phases are designed to ensure continuous improvement, flexibility, and collaboration throughout the project. The type of Agile methodology used will dictate the details of each phase, but in general, the lifecycle involves [3]:\n\n1. Preplanning: Define project vision, objective, high-level requirements, stakeholders, and project feasibility.\n\n2. Planning: Plan the first iteration (sprint) in detail, as well as the release of subsequent iterations, creating a backlog, user stories, tasks, and iteration goals.\n\n3. Release planning: Once the first iteration is completed or the product backlog is created, review the results to gain insights for continuous improvement via subsequent iterations.\n\n4. Iteration planning: After each iteration completion, plan the next iteration by adding or removing features necessary for optimal product functionality.\n\n5. Product backlog management: Reassess the project timeline after each iteration based on the product backlog and customer feedback. The cycle can continue until a satisfactory product is produced.\n\nBenefits of Agile project management\n\nAgile is useful because it applies to nearly every industry. Agile helps organizations work more efficiently by streamlining processes. Using Agile project management methodologies has many benefits.\n\nPros and cons\n\nAgile project management allows for continuous improvement, and the process is flexible and adaptive. Incorporating feedback throughout the process means software customers, for example, wonât have to wait until the end of a project to see the resultsâreducing the likelihood they wonât like the features. Agile also helps reduce waste and inefficiencies and problems are often caught early.\n\nOne downside to Agile project management is that if team members such as the Scrum Master donât effectively perform their roles, the project could veer off track, causing delays or other risks. In all Agile project management methodologies, itâs crucial for teams to work together without conflicts. Mistakes like being too aggressive with the workload, resisting compromise, not connecting emotionally with team members, or making assumptions are also threats to the Agile team.\n\nHow to become an Agile project managerÂ\n\nYou can become an Agile project manager through various paths. These include obtaining a bachelorâs degree, gaining professional experience at a workplace, completing a masterâs degree, or pursuing certifications.\n\nEarn a bachelorâs degree.\n\nMany Agile project management jobs require a bachelorâs degree or higher. While some universities have specialized degrees in project management, many students choose to study business or fields such as construction management, software engineering, information technology, marketing, health care administration, and other specialized fields.\n\nGain professional experience.Â\n\nAnother way to get your foot in the door is to work as part of an Agile project management development team, whether through an internship or entry-level job. Exploring various work environments through internships lets you see which fields you want to enter in the future.\n\nConsider earning a masterâs degree.\n\nA Master of Science in Agile Project Management (MS/APM) helps position you for leadership roles in the future. It can also help you stand out in the job candidate field. Another option for a related degree is an MBA. An MBA program prepares you for the Project Management Professional (PMP) and Professional in Business Analysis (PMI-PBA) exams. Masterâs programs in the fields you want to work in are also beneficial, whether thatâs marketing, health care, or any other industry.\n\nGet Agile project management certifications.Â\n\nOrganizations like the Project Management Institute (PMI), APMG International, the International Consortium for Agile, and Scaled Agile Academy offer certifications and credentials for Agile project management.\n\nTo learn more about specific credentials you can earn to boost your Agile project management skills, read6 Popular Agile Certifications.\n\nAgile AI skills for product and project management\n\nThe AI product development life cycle can differ from the standard.
