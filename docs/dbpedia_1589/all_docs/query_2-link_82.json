        "text": "Agile project management is an iterative approach to delivering a project throughout its life cycle.\n\nIterative or agile life cycles are composed of several iterations or incremental steps towards the completion of a project. Iterative approaches are frequently used in software development projects to promote velocity and adaptability since the benefit of iteration is that you can adjust as you go along rather than following a linear path.\n\nOne of the aims of an agile or iterative approach is to release benefits throughout the process rather than only at the end. At the core, agile projects should exhibit central values and behaviours of trust, flexibility, empowerment and collaboration.\n\nWhy do we need agile project management?\n\nWe need agile project management because it helps us focus on what matters. Becoming more agile through organisations and team’s brings flexibility to change and allows us to deliver value often with continuous feedback.\n\nThe goal is not to ‘be agile’ the goal is to improve. With an incremental and iterative approach, we increase predictability and control risk.\n\nRead blog\n\nWhat are the principles of an agile way of working?\n\nThe agile management philosophy concentrates on empowered people and their interactions, and early and constant delivery of value into an enterprise.\n\nIterative or agile project management focuses on delivering maximum value against business priorities in the time and budget allowed, especially when the drive to deliver is greater than the risk. Some agile principles include:\n\nThe project breaks a requirement into smaller pieces, which are then prioritised by the team in terms of importance.\n\nThe agile project promotes collaborative working, especially with the customer.\n\nThe agile project reflects, learns and adjusts at regular intervals to ensure that the customer is always satisfied and is provided with outcomes that result in benefits.\n\nAgile methods integrate planning with execution, allowing an organisation to create a working mindset that helps a team respond effectively to changing requirements.\n\nBecoming agile\n\nThe move to becoming an agile organisation brings change. It impacts on the traditional culture and introduces new ways of working on projects – so not everyone will be convinced. What does it take to successfully introduce that change?\n\nThree common myths debunked\n\nWhen approaching agile project management for the first time, it becomes apparent that there are various trains of thought. Some people believe it’s the best thing since sliced bread. Others are less convinced, seeing it as an excuse to wreak havoc on tried-and-tested delivery processes. We clear up some of the main misconceptions and share a holistic view of what agile project management is (and crucially, what it is not).\n\nWhat are the benefits of agile working?\n\nAgile approaches empower those involved; build accountability; encourage diversity of ideas; allowing the early release of benefits; and promotion of continuous improvement.\n\nAgile helps build client and user engagement because changes are incremental and evolutionary rather than revolutionary: it can therefore be effective in supporting cultural change that is critical to the success of most transformation projects.\n\nAgile allows decision ‘gremlins’ to be tested and rejected early: the tight feedback loops provide benefits in agile that are not as evident in waterfall.\n\nWhat are agile techniques?\n\nThere are various iterative or agile techniques that can suit any project method, they’re not limited to agile. You also don’t have to use them all; choose the ones that work for you, your team and the project.\n\nThis infographic is brought to you by the interactive APM Learning module.\n\nAgile or agility? A valuable addition to the project toolkit\n\nEmma meets Adrian Dooley, who has 45 years’ experience in project management. He is the founder and lead author of the Praxis Framework.\n\nIn this podcast, he shares how, in his experience, many fads rise to prominence and then become integrated into good practice. He believes agile will follow that same path."
