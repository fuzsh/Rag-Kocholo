        "text": "Reading Time: 9 minutes\n\nSince the advent of software, the world has become much more sophisticated in the last two decades. In the world of information technology, businesses and individuals are continually innovating and developing software and programs.\n\nAny software solution’s success depends on its methodology and the quality of effort put into its development.\n\nThe software development process used to be ambiguous and inefficient, resulting in inconsistent and unpredictable results before software development models were introduced. Standards to reduce mismatches between product expectations and prototypes were achieved by using standard frameworks and models. SDLC Vs Agile has been the standard question; let’s dive deep into understanding these.\n\nWhat is SDLC?\n\nThe Software Development Life Cycle is referred to as SDLC. The SDLC helps us deliver software with the highest quality at the lowest cost.\n\nUsing SDLC, an organization can develop software in a well-structured way and maintain quality by testing and validating user specifications before releasing the software to a live environment. SDLC offers a well-structured flow of different phases.\n\nAn application development life cycle is also known as the Software Development Life Cycle or SDLC, and it can be used to develop both hardware and software components.\n\nIterative and incremental processes are incorporated into the SDLC model. Ensuring quick delivery of a working software solution, it focuses more on customer satisfaction and process adaptability.\n\nPhases of SDLC\n\nSDLC consists of various phases.\n\n1. Planning\n\nThe first step is to gather and analyze requirements. This process includes getting customer input, meeting senior managers, and learning about sales and marketing. The requirements should be properly documented. The document is referred to as the Software Requirements Specification (SRS). As part of the project life cycle, the product requirements are outlined.\n\n2. Design\n\nUsing the output of the initial phase, the SRS document (Software Requirement Specification), we generate a software architecture for implementing system development.\n\nIn addition to identifying and specifying the system and hardware requirements, this phase also helps define the overall programming language framework, database architecture, and system architecture.\n\nThe system design specifications are used as input in the next phase of the model.\n\nAlso Read: 4 SDLC Pain Points of Traditional Development and solving them with No-Code\n\n3. Implementation\n\nA suitable programming language is used in the implementation of the project. Compilers, interpreters, code editors, integrated development environments, and debuggers can all be used to write and test programs. Depending on the application, the programming language can be chosen. During this phase, the developed module is tested unit by unit.\n\n4. Testing\n\nTesting ensures that a software program works as expected. This way, we can determine whether the final project meets the requirements. Testing includes integration testing, system testing, etc. Two modules are tested together during integration testing, and a system test is a complete project test.\n\n5. Delivery/Deployment\n\nUltimately, the product is released in the market. A brand-new feature can be added to the product based on customer feedback. Existing customers receive maintenance and the required services. SDLC consists of these major phases.\n\n6. Maintenance\n\nPublishing the software does not end the process. You need to be checking, tracking and analyzing it on timely basis to ensure that you are extracting actual value out of it. The operation needs a lot of operational maintenance after launch.\n\nAlso Read: 4 SDLC Pain Points of Traditional Development and solving them with No-Code\n\nWhat is Agile Methodology?\n\nThe Agile workflow model believes every project needs to be handled differently and existing methods must be tailored to suit the requirements properly. A release is divided into time boxes to deliver specific features.\n\nAn iterative approach is taken, and the working code is delivered after each iteration. Each build is incremental in terms of features; the final build holds all the features required by the customer.\n\nAs a result of its flexibility and adaptability, the Agile thought process became popular with time in software development.\n\nRational Unified Process (1994), Scrum (1995), Crystal Clear, Extreme Programming (1996), Adaptive Software Development, feature-driven development, and Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) (1995) are some of the most popular Agile methodologies.\n\nThe Agile Manifesto has the following principles:\n\nCo-location and pair programming are key interactions in Agile development. Self-organization and motivation are also significant.\n\nInstead of just relying on documentation, demoing working software is considered one of the most effective ways to communicate with customers.\n\nGetting proper product requirements requires continuous customer interaction, as the requirements cannot be fully gathered at the beginning of the project due to various factors.\n\nAgile development emphasizes quick responses to change and continuous improvement.\n\nAlso Read: The Basics Of Agile Methodology And Agile Software Development\n\nPhases Of Agile Methodology\n\nPlanning and Requirements Gathering\n\nSimilar to SDLC, Agile starts with understanding what needs to be built. However, instead of gathering all requirements upfront, Agile focuses on gathering just enough information to start work. This involves creating a prioritized list of features called the backlog.\n\nSprint Planning\n\nAgile projects are divided into short iterations called sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks. Before each sprint, the team plans what tasks they will tackle from the backlog and how they will accomplish them.\n\nDevelopment\n\nDuring the sprint, the team works on implementing the features they planned for. Unlike traditional methods where all development is done upfront, Agile encourages continuous development and delivery.\n\nDaily Stand-ups\n\nEvery day, the team meets for a short stand-up meeting to discuss progress, any obstacles encountered, and plans for the day. This ensures everyone is on the same page and can quickly address any issues that arise.\n\nContinuous Integration and Testing\n\nAs code is written, it’s continuously integrated into the main codebase and tested. This helps catch any bugs early on and ensures the software remains stable throughout development.\n\nReview and Retrospective\n\nAt the end of each sprint, the team reviews the work done and demonstrates the completed features to stakeholders. They also hold a retrospective meeting to discuss what went well, what could be improved, and any changes needed for future sprints.\n\nIncremental Delivery\n\nThroughout the project, working software is delivered in increments at the end of each sprint. This allows for early feedback from stakeholders and the ability to adapt to changing requirements.\n\nContinuous Improvement\n\nAgile emphasizes continuous improvement, both in the product being developed and in the way the team works. Feedback from stakeholders and retrospectives is used to make adjustments and improvements in future sprints.\n\nCompletion and Deployment\n\nOnce all planned features are implemented and tested, the product is ready for deployment. This can happen at the end of a single sprint or after multiple sprints, depending on the project’s scope and timeline.\n\nOngoing Maintenance and Iteration\n\nAfter deployment, the team continues to maintain and iterate on the product based on user feedback and changing requirements. This ensures the product remains valuable and relevant over time.\n\nCore Difference between SDLC vs Agile methodologies\n\nBenefits of SDLC\n\nProcess-oriented\n\nSDLC defines a structured approach to software development, often using predetermined phases like planning, design, development, testing, and deployment.\n\nRigorous documentation\n\nEach phase typically involves detailed documentation, ensuring clear communication and traceability throughout the project lifecycle.\n\nPredictability\n\nSDLC aims for well-defined requirements upfront, leading to a more predictable development process and timeline.\n\nLess flexible\n\nDue to its structured nature, adapting to significant requirement changes mid-project can be challenging in SDLC methodologies.\n\nAlso Read: Building Software Faster and Better with Hyper Agile SDLC and Citizen Development\n\nLimitations of the SDLC Model\n\nThe following are the main points of the SDLC model–\n\nThis is not the ideal model for a large, complex, and ongoing project.\n\nIt is less effective if the requirement is unclear at the beginning.\n\nMaking changes in the previous phases is very difficult.\n\nOnce development is complete, testing begins. Therefore, it is likely to discover bugs later in development, which will be costly to fix.\n\nEven during the development phase, this model does not offer much scope for change.\n\nEven during the development phase, this model does not offer much scope for change.\n\nTesting is often delayed until completion, making large revisions more expensive.\n\nWe are at high risk of uncertainty and risk due to unnoticed issues until the project is in its final phase.\n\nBenefits of Agile\n\nThe following are the benefits of using Agile development method.\n\nIterative and incremental\n\nAgile breaks down development into short, iterative cycles called sprints. Each sprint focuses on delivering a specific set of features with continuous feedback and adaptation.\n\nFlexibility\n\nAgile prioritizes adaptability to changing requirements. New features or changes can be incorporated throughout the development process.\n\nFaster feedback\n\nAgile promotes frequent communication and collaboration between stakeholders, leading to faster feedback loops and course correction.\n\nReduced documentation\n\nWhile documentation is still important, Agile emphasizes working software over extensive documentation.\n\nAlso Read: Citizen Development Can Pave the Way For Agility. Here’s how\n\nLimitations of the Agile Model\n\nFollowing are the limitations of Agile model.\n\nThis method cannot handle complex dependencies.\n\nThere is a substantial risk of sustainability, maintainability, and extensibility.\n\nIt needs an overall plan, an agile leader, and an agile PM practice to succeed.\n\nA strict delivery management process determines the scope, functionality, and adjustments to be made to meet deadlines.\n\nThe team can be driven in the wrong direction when the customer is unclear.\n\nDue to the lack of documentation, there is a very high level of individual dependency.\n\nThe lack of documentation may make it difficult to transfer technology to new team members.\n\nAlso Read: 6 Signs that your Legacy System is an obstacle for your business’s Digital Transformation!\n\nChoosing the Right Software Development Approach: SDLC vs Agile\n\nProject Complexity and Size\n\nSDLC: Best for large, complex projects with clear requirements.\n\nAgile: Ideal for projects of varying sizes with evolving requirements.\n\nCustomer Involvement and Feedback\n\nSDLC: Suited for fixed customer requirements.\n\nAgile: Emphasizes continuous customer collaboration and flexibility.\n\nProject Flexibility\n\nSDLC: Rigid and sequential, less suitable for ongoing adjustments.\n\nAgile: Allows ongoing adjustments for flexibility.\n\nTeam Size and Expertise\n\nSDLC: Works well with large, specialized teams.\n\nAgile: Effective with smaller, cross-functional teams.\n\nProject Timeline\n\nSDLC: Tends to have longer timelines.\n\nAgile: Promotes quicker deliverables with shorter iterations.\n\nRisk Tolerance\n\nSDLC: Mitigates risks upfront, suited for low change tolerance.\n\nAgile: Embraces change, suited for higher risk tolerance.\n\nRegulatory Compliance\n\nSDLC: Emphasizes documentation for strict compliance.\n\nAgile: Can meet regulatory requirements with additional documentation.\n\nPrevious Experience\n\nConsider your team’s familiarity with both methodologies.\n\nHybrid Approaches\n\nConsider combining elements of both SDLC and Agile for specific project needs.\n\nUltimately, the choice between SDLC and Agile should align with your project’s unique circumstances and requirements. You may also consult with stakeholders, project managers, and team members to make an informed decision. In some cases, a pilot project using one approach can help you determine if it’s the right fit before committing to it for larger endeavors.\n\nQuixy: Your Agile Development Ally in the Race for Innovation\n\nThe dynamic nature of Agile development necessitates a flexible and collaborative approach.
