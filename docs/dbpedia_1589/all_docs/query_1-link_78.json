        "text": "What is the difference between agile and waterfall methodologies?\n\nThe waterfall methodology proposes a linear, set approach to project management where all the variables are decided during the planning phase and the rest is merely execution. Agile methodology in project management acknowledges the uncertainty that accompanies changing technologies in a fast-paced world and proposes iterative short-term planning to combat it. Work is split into small sizable chunks which are worked on consecutively. With each part comes changes in requirements or improvements in technology that make the subsequent parts more efficient and effective.\n\nThus the agile approach to project management advocates constant learning and adapting in order to produce quality end products that perfectly satisfy the customerâs requirements while keeping up with current technology trends.\n\nWaterfall Methodology\n\nLinear and sequential approach\n\nFocuses on project delivery\n\nProject is split into phases\n\nRequirements are taken only at the start of the process\n\nAvoids scope changes once development begins\n\nStrict project deadlines enforced by the project manager\n\nFocused on executing the plan\n\nAgile Methodology\n\nIncremental and iterative approach\n\nFocuses on customer satisfaction\n\nProject is split into sprints\n\nRequirements are expected to change and evolve\n\nIncorporates changes even late in the development\n\nTeams are encouraged to be self-organizing\n\nFocused on delivering working software\n\nHow is agile beneficial?\n\nHigher customer satisfaction\n\nHigh product quality\n\nAllows for change\n\nNo unpredictable delays\n\nTeam dynamic gets better\n\nWho can benefit from Agile Project Management\n\nWhen we are making breakthroughs in science and technology every day, embracing change has become second nature. It's almost Darwinian to say that if you don't keep improving, you're going to become obsolete. We make plans and drop relationships with a single text. In a sense, aren't we all agile?\n\nThe agile approach, which started out as an experiment for software-practitioners, has insinuated itself into every industry as a productivity mantra. Marketing, advertising, event planning, publications, and even food distributors have used agile knowledge to turn their luck around. We could almost call it a New Age Movement.\n\nWhat are the frameworks within the agile methodology?\n\nAgility is the umbrella term beneath which many frameworks have mushroomed over the years. It's a mindset, and a framework is a set of rules with which you can convert lofty principles into tangible practices that you can incorporate in your work.\n\nThere have been many frameworks over the years, the most popular being Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP), and Lean.\n\nWhat is Scrum?\n\nScrum is an iterative incremental approach to software development under agile project management and is the most popular framework under the agile methodology. In Scrum, you split your work into chunks on which you work for set periods of time. These time boxesâcalled sprintsâ are tracked on a Scrum board and should result in a working piece of software. Scrum prescribes an inspect-and-adapt approach. So with each sprint, they adapt by incorporating lessons from previous sprints.\n\nScrum has 3 roles - Product Owner, Scrum Master and the development team. They each have distinct roles to play. The Scrum process starts with the \"backlog\" âa list of requirementsâwhere each requirement is broken down into user stories and their corresponding tasks. These user stories are prioritized in order to plan the next sprint. There are several reports in Scrum that help a team measure the performance of a sprint - velocity, burnup, burndown, cumulative flow diagram. Scrum also emphasizes in face-to-face communication and small feedback loops within the team which is why meetings play an important role in the Scrum process.\n\nWhat is Kanban?\n\nKanban is a method to visualize your workflow that lets you identify bottlenecks and increase productivity by limiting the amount of work in progress. It's based on the Japanese philosophy Kaizen, the idea that small continuous changes result in a substantial movement over time.\n\nA basic Kanban board typically has three columns - \"To do\", \"In progress\", and \"Done.\" Each work item is written on a Kanban card which also holds details like the description of the work item and the assignee. The Kanban cards are placed in their respective columns on the board. Each column has a work-in-progress limit which prevents the team from becoming overburdened and lets them focus on delivering quality work.\n\nKanban is a flow-based agile project management method which advocates continual delivery. Performance is usually measured by how long a work item takes to go from \"To do\" to \"Done\" on the board. This method focuses solely on preventing capacity overload and enabling quality and continuous delivery.\n\nKanban vs Scrum: How to pick one?\n\nThe \"Kanban vs Scrum\" is quite a popular debate within agile project management circles. While there are some key differences between the two, both are fundamentally based on agile principles like adapting to change, transparency and constant, consistent improvement.\n\nScrum is more prescriptive of the two with strict time boxes, ceremonies and artifacts. Kanban is favored by teams who deliver continuously and are working on optimizing their workflow. If you don't like either, there's a third option Scrumban, which combines the structure of Scrum and the flexibility of Kanban.\n\nEach team operates differently. The framework you choose for your team depends on your work, your organizational culture and your team dynamic. That being said, the framework you choose will directly influence your team's productivity and job satisfaction. So choose wisely :)"
