However, despite Agile project management becoming the standard workflow for many European and American developers, its traits and benefits may still not be evident and understandable to many customers. This article aims to clarify the specifics of applying Agile to the software development life cycle process and demonstrate its advantages over traditional development approaches.\n\nWhat is Agile Model in Software Engineering\n\nApplication development methodologies have evolved in response to the ever-growing complexities of software projects. Initially, software development followed a predominantly sequential and rigid path known as the Waterfall. In the Waterfall model, each app-building phase — such as requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, and deployment — followed the other consecutively, with little room for change once a stage had begun.\n\nHowever, as software projects became more intricate and dynamic, it became apparent that the Waterfall model’s inflexibility could lead to problems such as missed requirements, late-stage changes, and lengthy development cycles. The Agile software development concept emerged in response to these challenges, focusing on flexibility, collaboration, and customer-centricity.\n\nKey principles of Agile methodology\n\nUnlike the Waterfall model’s linear progression, Agile embraces an iterative and incremental approach. It breaks the development process into smaller, manageable cycles called iterations or sprints, resulting in a potentially shippable product gain every time. This approach allows for early and regular releases, enabling rapid adaptation to changing requirements.\n\nThe Agile methodology is underpinned by a set of fundamental principles that guide its strategy for managing projects and delivering software.\n\nAgile champions the significance of people and their interactions within the development process over the rigid confines of procedures and tools. It acknowledges that harnessing team members’ collective expertise and collaboration leads to innovation and success.\n\nIn the Agile lexicon, functional software takes precedence over exhaustive documentation. Agile advocates for the swift delivery of tangible software that adds value to the end-users, recognizing that it is in the hands-on experience that proper validation occurs.\n\nAgile is marked by a commitment to customer collaboration, eschewing rigid contract negotiations. The iterative nature of Agile allows for continuous feedback from customers, ensuring the alignment of the product with their evolving needs.\n\nAgile thrives on its ability to respond to change, prioritizing adaptability over adherence to a predetermined plan. It acknowledges that change is an inherent aspect of app development and is poised to pivot when needed swiftly.\n\nThese four cardinal principles are succinctly encapsulated in the slogan: “We prioritize individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responsiveness to change.” Beyond these foundational tenets, Agile methodology espouses additional principles that are equally important:\n\nAgile development teams recognize the importance of maintaining a sustainable pace that safeguards the well-being of team members while ensuring the delivery of high-quality products.\n\nThe Agile ethos is deeply rooted in an unwavering commitment to continuous improvement. Teams perpetually seek avenues to enhance their processes and product quality.\n\nA dedication to transparency and openness underscores communication and partnership within Agile teams. That facilitates the exchange of ideas, challenges, and progress.\n\nAgile software developers believe that collaboration invariably trumps competition. They view joint efforts as more potent and conducive to innovation.\n\nWith its adaptable and flexible approach, Agile methodology in software development life cycle is a highly sought-after project management paradigm that finds application across diverse industries and contexts.\n\nAgile vs Waterfall development model\n\nBenefits of Agile software product development process\n\nThe Agile methodology is not only defined by its guiding principles but is also renowned for its manifold advantages to software development endeavors. The most indisputable benefits of Agile workflow template are the following:\n\nEnhanced customer satisfaction\n\nA steadfast devotion to customer satisfaction is at the heart of the Agile method. Agile teams are relentlessly dedicated to delivering functional software early and consistently. This practice serves as a litmus test for ensuring that the product aligns seamlessly with the evolving needs of the client. Through frequent customer engagement and feedback loops, Agile developers keep a finger on the pulse of expectations, thereby fostering an environment where customer fulfillment is principal.\n\nElevated product quality\n\nThe agile process is synonymous with a stubborn pursuit of excellence. By prioritizing working software as the primary measure of progress, Agile teams place a premium on the quality of the product. Continuous testing and feedback mechanisms become integral components of the development process, allowing teams to identify and rectify issues promptly. The result is a product of unparalleled quality, honed and refined iteratively.\n\nMitigated project risk\n\nThe agile approach breaks down complex projects into smaller, more digestible parts. This deliberate decomposition mitigates the inherent risks associated with large-scale projects. By doing so, developers substantially reduce the probability of project failure, ensuring a higher likelihood of success.\n\nElevated team morale\n\nAgile methodology stands apart by designating teams to be self-organizing and decision-making entities. This empowerment fosters a sense of ownership and autonomy among team members. Team morale soars with the latitude to make decisions that impact the project. This heightened confidence, in turn, kindles a surge in productivity, creating a virtuous cycle of engagement and achievement.\n\nThe agile procedure optimizes the software development process and heralds a cultural shift in how teams cooperate and innovate. It is more than just a methodology; it is a transformative force driving excellence in software engineering. That is how user-friendly, productive, and functional enterprise software applications are created, like those presented in the Academy Smart’s promo video.\n\nAgile frameworks and tools for software development\n\nDevelopment teams may operate various frameworks to implement Agile practices, manage projects efficiently, and deliver high-quality software quickly. There are several famous examples:\n\nScrum provides a structured approach to product development with defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team), events (Sprint, Daily Scrum), and artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog).\n\nKanban is an Agile framework that visualizes work on a Kanban board. It’s beneficial for managing work in progress and optimizing flow.\n\nScrumban is a hybrid framework that incorporates the predictability of Scrum while responding to changes and adjusting priorities in real time, as facilitated by Kanban’s visual boards and work-in-progress limits.\n\nLean principle is often applied in Agile development. It highlights delivering value to customers while minimizing waste. It includes concepts like value stream mapping and continuous improvement.\n\nDynamic Systems Development Method emphasizes disciplined delivering projects on time and within budget. DSDM provides a comprehensive framework with defined roles, phases, and principles, making it suitable for projects requiring rigorous governance and compliance.\n\nThe Agile Data Method is tailored explicitly for database and data-oriented development projects. It promotes iterative development of database components, continuous integration of database changes, and database refactorings to maintain data quality.\n\nExtreme Programming is an Agile methodology utilizing engineering practices like test-driven development, pair programming, and continuous integration.\n\nFeature-driven development focuses on feature-level planning and development, making it suitable for projects with many features.\n\nScaled Agile Framework is designed for large organizations and complex projects. It raises Agile principles to the enterprise level with roles, ceremonies, and artifacts tailored for wider teams.\n\nLarge-Scale Scrum (LeSS) extends the Scrum framework designed for big organizations and projects. This framework simplifies, streamlines, and reduces unnecessary complexity in large-scale Agile adoption. It promotes a single product backlog and encourages collaboration across multiple Scrum teams working on the same product.\n\nSpecialized tools for project management assist software development teams in implementing Agile principles, from managing work items and tracking progress to facilitating collaboration and communication among team members and stakeholders. Among the most popular auxiliary tools, you can find the following ones:\n\nJira\n\nAsana\n\nTrello\n\nMonday\n\nClickUp\n\nConfluence\n\nWrike\n\nPivotal Tracker\n\nVersionOne\n\nPlanview\n\nRally\n\nYou may learn more about their feature set and the pros and cons in our article “12 Best AI Project Management Software Tools” earlier in the blog. Of course, the choice of framework and tools depends on the team’s specific needs and the nature of the project.\n\nAgile Software Development Life Cycle: policy and procedures\n\nThe Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic approach used in software engineering to design, develop, test, and maintain program systems. It guides the entire software development process from inception to deployment. Typically it consists of the following stages:\n\nPlanning and requirements gathering\n\nAt the outset of the SDLC, the planning phase involves defining the project scope, objectives, and requirements. Stakeholders collaborate to establish a clear understanding of what the software should achieve. This phase forms the foundation of the project.\n\nDesign\n\nThe design phase focuses on transforming the conceptual requirements into a detailed blueprint. It includes defining the software architecture, data structures, user interfaces, and other technical specifications. The goal is to create a clear and comprehensive plan for building the software.\n\nCoding\n\nDuring the implementation phase, developers write the code according to the design specifications. That is where the software takes shape, and programming languages are used to create the functionality outlined in the design phase.\n\nTesting\n\nTesting is a critical phase of the SDLC, where the software is rigorously evaluated for defects, errors, and functionality issues. Various testing methods, such as unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing, ensure the software meets its requirements and functions as intended.\n\nDeployment and release\n\nOnce testing is complete and the software is deemed ready, it is deployed for use by end-users. This phase involves the installation, configuration, and rollout of the software. Continuous monitoring and support are also provided as necessary.\n\nMaintenance\n\nThe final phase of the SDLC involves ongoing maintenance, updates, and iterative improvements to the software. Feedback from users and stakeholders is valuable for identifying areas for enhancement or addressing issues that may arise post-release.\n\nThe SDLC is not a one-size-fits-all approach; it offers flexibility to adapt to different project types and methodologies. Various SDLC models, such as Waterfall or Agile cater to specific project needs and organizational preferences.\n\n5 phases of agile SDLC process\n\nConsidering the above, let’s note that the critical difference between the Waterfall vs Agile SDLC models is the opposite of a linear and sequential approach against iterative and flexible. In other words, the activation of SDLC phases in the Waterfall mainly occurs only once on the path directly from planning to release of the application. What is an agile model in SDLC, then? It reproduces the entire development life cycle in each but shorter iteration approved as part of the planning. This way enables the delivery of functional software at the end of each iteration, allowing for adaptation based on changing factors. Of course, specialized terminology and efficient workflow are used to manage the software development life cycle process flexibly. So, what are the 5 stages of SDLC in an Agile flowchart?\n\nConception\n\nThe product idea is generated at this stage, and the initial requirements are collected. The product owner and the development team work together to define the product vision and to identify the key features and functionality that the product should have.\n\nInception\n\nThe product vision and roadmap are created here, and the project team is assembled. The product owner and the development team work together to create a detailed plan for building and delivering the product. The roadmap should include the features and functionality that will be included in each iteration, as well as the timeline and budget for the project.\n\nIteration\n\nThe product is developed in a series of short cycles at this phase, called iterations. Each iteration typically lasts 1-2 weeks. The process begins with planning the scope of work that will be completed during the sprint. The team then develops application code, tests it, and delivers it to the customer at the end of the iteration. The customer then provides feedback to utilize it for improvements in the next iteration.\n\nRelease\n\nThe product is finalized here and released. Once the product is complete and has been approved by the customer, it is launched into production.\n\nProduction\n\nIt is the stage of product support and maintenance. The development team continues to monitor the app state and fix any bugs that are found. Developers may also add new features and functionality based on feedback from the customer.\n\nThe Agile SDLC is an adaptable process that can be used to develop various software products. It is particularly well-suited for developing complex enterprise-level products that require frequent changes.\n\nAgile SDLC components\n\nAgile roadmap creation methodology\n\nCreating a roadmap in Agile SDLC defines a clear and structured plan for the project, ensuring that team members, stakeholders, and customers have a shared understanding of priorities, objectives, and timelines. It helps align efforts, manage expectations, and adapt to changing requirements, ultimately enhancing communication, collaboration, and the successful delivery of valuable software increments.\n\nThe specificity of the Agile roadmap creation procedure lies in its adjustable and elastic approach to planning and visualizing the development journey of a software project.\n\nAgile roadmaps are not fixed documents but evolve iteratively. They focus on short- to mid-term planning, typically a few months to a year, allowing teams to adjust their course based on changing priorities and feedback. Agile roadmaps embrace change and uncertainty. They are designed to accommodate new requirements, shifting priorities, and unforeseen challenges, allowing teams to pivot as needed.\n\nAgile roadmaps focus on desired outcomes and impact rather than just output. They align with the project’s strategic goals and the broader vision of the product. They emphasize incremental and frequent releases of working software. That allows teams to gather real-world feedback and validate assumptions, leading to better-informed decisions. Moreover, agile SDLC roadmaps are subject to regular review and adjustment. Developers conduct frequent retrospectives to assess progress, identify areas for improvement, and refine the workflow accordingly.\n\nAgile roadmaps are often presented visually, using tools like Kanban boards or Gantt charts. This visual representation provides a clear overview of the project’s progress and upcoming milestones, encouraging collaboration between cross-functional teams, including developers, designers, testers, and product managers. As they prioritize delivering value to end-users, Agile roadmaps are transparent and accessible to all stakeholders. That fosters cooperation, alignment, and shared understanding among team members, product owners, and customers.\n\nTo create an Agile software development life cycle roadmap, developers usually have to:\n\nGather input from stakeholders\n\nTalk to the people who will be using the product, as well as those who will be responsible for developing and maintaining it. Get their input on the product vision, strategy, and roadmap.\n\nPrioritize the functionality\n\nNot all features and functionality are created equal. Some parts are more critical than others, and some features are more urgent. Prioritize the features and functionality based on their importance and urgency. Selecting and clearly defining SDLC KPIs and their targets will help track the effectiveness of the process at all its stages and iterations.\n\nEstimate the efforts\n\nOnce you have prioritized the features and functionality, you need to estimate the effort required to produce each component. It will help you to create a realistic timeline for delivery and allocate the necessary amount of resources.\n\nCreate a release plan\n\nThe release plan should outline the key features and functionality that will be included in each product release.\n\nReview and update the roadmap\n\nThe Agile roadmap is a living document, so it is important to recapitulate and modernize it regularly as the product evolves and new information becomes available.\n\nHere are some tips for creating a practical SDLC roadmap:\n\nBe realistic\n\nDon’t try to cram too much into each release. Focus on the most essential features and functionality, and be realistic about the time it will take to develop them.\n\nBe flexible\n\nThe Agile roadmap is a modifiable document, so be prepared to change it. That could be due to changes in the market, evolutions in the customer’s needs, or technical challenges. Get more relevant knowledge in our guide “Product Development Roadmap: how to Create in 6 Steps.”\n\nBe transparent\n\nCommunicate the roadmap to all stakeholders, including customers, developers, and testers. That will help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and understands the project’s goals.\n\nAgile SDLC project management challenges\n\nAgile SDLC methodologies have revolutionized software development, implementing flexibility, customer collaboration, and faster delivery. However, with these benefits come a unique set of challenges PMs must address to ensure successful project outcomes. Here are some of them:\n\nChanging requirements\n\nAgile welcomes evolving necessities, but managing frequent changes while maintaining project scope and timelines can be challenging.\n\nTeam empowerment\n\nAssigning self-organizing teams requires a balance between autonomy and alignment with project goals.\n\nPrioritization\n\nAgile development teams must constantly prioritize features and user stories to ensure that the most valuable items are delivered first.\n\nEstimation accuracy\n\nAgile relies on iterative planning and estimation, which can be complex, leading to overruns or underestimations.\n\nClient engagement\n\nEnsuring continuous client involvement and feedback can be demanding, especially in large or distributed teams.\n\nNavigating these challenges is vital to harnessing the full potential of the Agile SDLC process, allowing developers to build high-quality software apps within project timelines and budgets. Of course, that requires a lot of practical experience; our one is presented on the portfolio page.\n\nSoftware products we delivered\n\nWhy Choose Academy SMART as your Agile Software Development Team\n\nAcademy Smart, an offshore IT service provider from Eastern Europe, has practiced the most advanced and reliable Agile principles for enterprise software development for over 13 years.
