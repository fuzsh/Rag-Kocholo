        "text": "As an entrepreneur, you probably spend your day trying to hit many different moving targets. Your client wants one thing on Monday and something else on Wednesday. New emerging technologies or competitors force you to make adjustments. Hitting a moving target would be much easier if you could adjust your shot after you pull the trigger.\n\nEnter Agile project management. Agile project management is a popular methodology for tracking various roles, responsibilities, deadlines and other factors of a project. When used properly, Agile can save organizations a great deal of time, frustration and money. Here’s how it works.\n\nWhat Is Agile?\n\nAgile is an iterative, introspective and adaptive project management methodology. In an Agile practice, a project is broken up into sub-projects. These are typically referred to as sprints. At the end of each sprint, stakeholders and the team review their work, make adjustments for the next sprint, and repeat until complete. The point of Agile is the constant, incremental delivery of value throughout the project, instead of all at once at the end.\n\nAgile project management has its roots in software development. Development cycles are much shorter now than they used to be. Software developers could take years to bring a product to market. In some cases, the software was obsolete before it could get into consumers’ hands.\n\nTraditional project management structures were in part to blame. They are very rigid and linear. It is difficult to adapt to problems that arise and nothing is released until all the work is complete.\n\nThe framework addresses many business problems by embracing the chaos. It is designed to account for the fact that you will run into unexpected problems. It knows that, inevitably, you’re going to have to make a change to get to your desired outcome.\n\nAgile allows your team to take aim at a general direction, build something then reassess the situation. Many teams both in and out of the software industry find this approach helpful in accomplishing difficult, complex tasks.\n\nAgile Project Management: An Example\n\nLet’s say you’re building an app. A product owner takes input from stakeholders. These can be executives, customers or both. They’ll say something such as, “We want an app where users can create and sell widgets to each other.” From these interactions, the product owners create a backlog. The backlog is a list of all tasks that need to be completed to achieve the overarching goal.\n\nNext, the team holds a pre-sprint meeting. They review the backlog and determine how much work they can take on. Once they commit to the work and divvy it up, the sprint begins. A sprint typically takes a few weeks, but no longer than a month. At the beginning of each day, the team will meet for a stand-up meeting. These are brief, everyone stands up (to ensure the meeting is brief), and you review the previous day’s work and make adjustments if needed.\n\nAt the end of the sprint, the team and stakeholders review progress, commit their work, make adjustments for the next sprint and reiterate. This continues until the overarching goal is reached.\n\nIn basic terms, Agile is all about breaking up complex tasks into simple sprints. When used correctly, they can make a huge difference in your team’s productivity and morale.\n\nThe Agile Manifesto\n\nLike most great theories, Agile is presented in a manifesto. Here, the forgers of Manifesto for Agile Software Development (commonly known as the Agile Manifesto) define the four core values and 12 principles of Agile project management.\n\nAgile project management requires highly collaborative, flexible teams that can deliver constant value through each iteration. This makes sense, considering that Agile is inherently introspective, and focused on constant fine-tuning to optimize results.\n\nFour Core Values of Agile Project Management\n\nThe four core values to Agile include:\n\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\n\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\n\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\n\nResponding to change over following a plan\n\n12 Principles of Agile Project Management\n\nThe 12 principles of the methodology build upon these values, according to the Agile Manifesto:\n\nThe highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.\n\nWelcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.\n\nDeliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.\n\nBusiness people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.\n\nBuild projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.\n\nThe most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.\n\nWorking software is the primary measure of progress.\n\nAgile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.\n\nContinuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.\n\nSimplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.\n\nThe best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.\n\nAt regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.\n\nDifferent Kinds of Agile Project Management Methodologies\n\nThe Agile family tree of project management methodologies has many branches. All the Agile project management theories adhere to the main tenets of Agile, but they do so in subtly different ways. We won’t go over the entire family here. But we will discuss two of the most popular flavors of Agile.\n\nScrum\n\nThe founders of Scrum define it as “a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.” Scrum is built on the ideas that we learn by doing, waste should be minimized, and we should focus on what’s most important. Scrum should be leveraged against a team of multi-tool players who collectively create increments of value through each iteration.\n\nIn a Scrum practice, the Scrum team is made up of a product owner, a Scrum Master, and the development team. The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the end goal, while the Scrum Master is responsible for maintaining Scrum and getting the most out of the development team. The development team does the work.\n\nScrum is the most popular Agile method. In survey results presented in the 14th Annual State of Agile Report, 75% of respondents said they practice Scrum or a Scrum-hybrid.\n\nKanban\n\nKanban relies on visualizations and controls to track and manage the workload. A basic Kanban board is made up of three columns: “Request”, “In Progress” and “Done”. But many companies will create columns for each step in their workflow.\n\nEach project is visualized as cards on the Kanban board, and progresses through each column until the work is complete. A “work in progress” (WIP) limitation is created and applied to each column to prevent the team from stretching themselves too thin by committing too much work. From there, it’s a matter of maintaining a steady, sustainable pace, and adjusting as needed to optimize processes.\n\nAccording to the 14th State of Technology, 63% of respondents said that they used Kanban in their organizations.\n\nLeverage Agile in Your Environment\n\nAgile project management isn’t a one-size-fits-all methodology. The efficacy of Agile depends on the goals you are trying to achieve. If you’re shooting at a stationary target and cannot deviate from a predefined path, then Agile might not be your best bet. But if you are trying to hit a moving target and you need to get the most out of the time and resources at your disposal, then Agile might be the answer to your problems.\n\nThe people on your team are also something you should consider before implementing Agile. Culture and buy-in is a big deal, and the wrong culture and a lack of buy-in are leading causes for Agile to fail, according to the State of Agile Report. But more importantly, people are a central component of Agile. You need a team of multi-tool players that can work together, adapt to changes, and stay focused on the goal.\n\nIf you decide Agile isn’t right for your team, consider implementing one of the other project management methodologies.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions"
