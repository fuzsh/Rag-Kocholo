        "text": "Type of project management\n\nNot to be confused with Agile leadership.\n\nAgile management is the application of the principles of Agile software development and Lean Management to various management processes, particularly product development. Following the appearance of The Manifesto for Agile Software Development in 2001, Agile techniques started to spread into other areas of activity.[1] The term Agile originates from Agile manufacturing - which in the early 1990s had developed from flexible manufacturing systems and lean manufacturing/production.[2]\n\nIn 2004, one of the authors of the original manifesto, Jim Highsmith, published Agile Project Management: Creating Innovative Products.[3]\n\nThe term \"Agile Project Management\" has not been picked up by any of the international organizations developing Project Management Standards.\n\nThe ISO Standard ISO 21502:2020[4] refers to the term \"agile\" as a delivery approach of products (project scope).\n\nThe PMBoK Standard[5] published by the Project Management Institute refers to an \"adaptive\" type of development lifecycle also called \"agile\" or \"change-driven\" about the product development lifecycle of a project (an element of the project lifecycle).\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nScrum (software development)\n\nAgile learning"
