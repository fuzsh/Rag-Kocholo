        "text": "One of the most critical components of project management is understanding various methodologies, their strengths and weaknesses, and knowing when those teachings are best applied. Read on to learn more about the Agile and Waterfall methodologies, their similarities, and differences, and when to apply them in daily project management work.\n\nAgile vs. Waterfall Methodologies: What’s the Difference?\n\nWhile Agile and Waterfall are both methodologies that exist in project management, their use cases and core rules are extremely different. The main difference between Agile and Waterfall is that the Agile methodology is extremely flexible, whereas the Waterfall methodology is rigid.\n\nThe Agile methodology is team-driven and includes room for quick changes, edits, and room for stakeholder feedback throughout. On the other hand, the Waterfall approach is more traditional, with projects following a sequential approach that only involves feedback at the end of the project.\n\nRead more: Agile, Waterfall, and Hybrid: Managing the Multiple-Methodology Portfolio\n\nOverview: A Quick Comparison of Agile and Waterfall\n\nRead more: What is Agile Project Management?\n\nKey Differences between Agile and Waterfall\n\nAgile Methodology\n\nKey points: High degree of flexibility and continuous evolution\n\nRequirements: Shorter deadlines, frequent check-ins, and a highly adaptable team with team members that can play various roles as needed\n\nWaterfall Methodology\n\nKey points: Rigid structure and a sequential process\n\nRequirements: Highly structured team, a hands-on project manager, and a well-defined project plan\n\nRead more: 3 Best Tools for Waterfall Project Management\n\nHistory of Agile and Waterfall Methodology\n\nHistory of the Agile Methodology\n\nThe Agile methodology was created after the tech boom of the late 1990s when software developers realized they needed a more flexible approach to projects. Before the Agile methodology, software developers and technical teams were frustrated by the Waterfall approach’s limited capacity to embrace change throughout the project lifecycle. For example, if there was an error or major flaw in a software product, by the time the product was delivered to stakeholders, there was no room for improvement without kicking off a new project.\n\nIn February of 2001, a group of 17 software developers met in Snowbird, Utah, determined to create a better way of managing projects that could address some of their frustrations. At the conclusion of the trip, the group created the Agile Manifesto that outlines the key principles of modern Agile project management, effectively creating a better method of project management for teams that required a higher level of flexibility than previous methods provided.\n\nRead more: Agile Software Development Methodology & Principles\n\nHistory of the Waterfall Methodology\n\nThe Waterfall methodology is the oldest project management methodology, first documented in a paper titled “Managing the Development of Large Software Systems,” published by Winston W. Royce in 1970. Inspired by the rigid, repetitive process of Henry Ford’s assembly line, the Waterfall method became popular in the 70s and 80s but became less popular in the 90s as technology-focused teams realized the limitations of the method.\n\nRead more: Waterfall Software Development & Tools\n\nHow to Choose Between the Agile and Waterfall Methodology\n\nWhen to Use Agile Methodology\n\nThe Agile methodology embraces uncertainty, with ambiguous details and adaptability reigning as two core values. Projects with high levels of uncertainty surrounding timeline, budget, and resources are great candidates for the Agile method. In particular, technical teams, such as software engineers, IT support teams, video game developers, and tech startups tend to favor the Agile approach to project management because of the flexibility it grants them when developing new products.\n\nWhen to Use Waterfall Methodology\n\nThe Waterfall method relies on sequential events and high levels of predictability. A wide variety of projects are good candidates for the Waterfall model, including projects with well-defined requirements, small or highly focused projects, projects that do not have a rigid timeline and repeatable projects that follow similar steps each time. Specifically, industries such as construction and manufacturing benefit from using the Waterfall method.\n\nPairing Agile and Waterfall Methodologies with Project Management Tools\n\nWhen incorporating a new methodology into the team’s project strategy, utilizing the power of project management tools such as project management software can help create a unified documentation system for project documents while making essential tasks like assigning deadlines much easier.\n\nProject Management Software for Agile Teams: ClickUp\n\nClickUp is a great choice in project management software for Agile teams because it supports the essential features that Agile teams need most, from a variety of collaborative features to 15 project views, and reporting features that can help fill in the gaps where project documentation is concerned.\n\nExamples of collaborative features within ClickUp, such as instant chat.
