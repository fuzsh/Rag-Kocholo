        "text": "The Agile process background\n\nThe Agile framework is an iterative approach to software development. Instead of delivering a final working product at the end of the development lifecycle, teams work in small timeframes. These timeframes, called sprints, are usually one to three weeks.\n\nThroughout sprints, teams collaborate and provide feedback on the work in progress. With frequent communication, teams adapt to changing business and user needs. Communication also leads to the delivery of high-quality software products.\n\nThe 5 stages of the Agile software development lifecycle\n\nStage 1: Ideation\n\nAll successful Agile software development projects begin with an ideation stage.\n\nThe Agile product owner (PO) works closely with stakeholders, the business team, developers, and future app users. Guided by the greater team, the PO pieces together a project vision by:\n\nDefining the purpose and goal of the new software\n\nDetermining and documenting business and user requirements\n\nPrioritizing tasks and allocating resources\n\nStage 2: Development\n\nAfter ideation, teams can start building the first iteration of the software. The development phase includes all related production tasks in the SDLC, such as UX/UI design, architecting, and coding.\n\nDeveloping the first iteration of a software product is often the longest stage of the Agile application development lifecycle.\n\nStage 3: Testing\n\nDevelopment went smoothly, and the team is happy with the app’s first iteration. Before release, the app has to go through a quality assurance check. The Agile team tests the app to ensure full functionality by:\n\nChecking that the code is clean\n\nAddressing bugs and errors\n\nPerforming trial runs\n\nStage 4: Deployment\n\nOnce the app is ready for release, the Agile team deploys it to the cloud or an on-premise server.\n\nOnce deployed, the product is live and accessible to customers. Deployment tends to be the most celebratory moment in the SDLC: You did it! Pat yourself on the back now, but there’s one more stage to go.\n\nStage 5: Operations\n\nAfter pushing the magic button, the work continues. Ongoing maintenance helps squash bugs and maintain functionality. As users engage with the app, there will be opportunities to collect feedback and make improvements to release in future iterations.\n\n5 ways to improve software development agility\n\nThe Agile software development cycle is about bringing out the best in your team. At the foundation of Agile are five key areas that propel speed and agility: Methodology, Architecture, Automation, Infrastructure, and Technology.\n\nIt’s important to evaluate where your organization lies in each area honestly. Are you ready to accommodate changing business needs? If you are currently less mature in a specific area, you have more opportunities to improve.\n\nLet’s look at each of the five focus areas and some recommendations.\n\n1. Methodology\n\nImprove collaboration between business and IT and allow faster discovery of project requirements to ensure a quicker time to value. Allowing for rapid adoption to changing business needs improves speed and agility throughout all phases.\n\n2. Architecture\n\nDesign your solutions using the principles from a component-based or microservices architecture. This architecture enables teams to create autonomous and independent systems, reducing the impact of change and increasing flexibility.\n\n3. Automation\n\nManual work is time-consuming and prone to error. Start by measuring the time spent on all manual tasks and continuously automating the most time-consuming work.\n\n4. Infrastructure\n\nA flexible infrastructure keeps teams adaptable to continuous change. Many IaaS providers already allow for immediate provisioning of servers. The next step is containerization, which, in combination with automation, can lead to self-service and fully automated provisioning.\n\n5. Technology\n\nTechnology is what ultimately enables agility. To achieve the most value, choosing the right technology for the job is imperative. While identifying your focus areas, look at your underlying business goals. Select a tool that helps you achieve those goals with the least amount of effort.\n\nDo your due diligence and adopt a combination of technologies that can collaboratively support you in becoming Agile. Choose open technologies that will quickly increase your agility and grow with you.\n\nHow does DevOps fit in?\n\nAdopting DevOps tools and practices won’t automatically make an organization Agile. Each Agile software development phase has a different goal, and achieving those goals requires a tactical approach.\n\nAgile development helps DevOps teams thrive, and low-code development platforms provide the environment where the two can unite.\n\nThe Mendix low-code platform is designed with Agile in mind. You can fit Mendix into your existing processes in different ways:"
