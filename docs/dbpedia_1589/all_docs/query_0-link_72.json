        "text": "A project management team can boost the chances of success of any new project by implementing an agile approach. By using agile principles as opposed to those of traditional project management, organizations can encourage collaboration and increase client and user engagement. Other benefits of agile project management include:\n\nIncreased productivity and transparency\n\nBusiness process improvement\n\nHigher-quality deliverables\n\nContinuous improvement\n\nAgile project management is most often used for software development projects in healthcare and other sectors, but it is also used for non-IT projects.\n\nUnderstanding the Basics of Project Management\n\nThe Project Management Institute (PMI) defines project management as “the practice of using knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to complete a series of tasks to deliver value and achieve a desired outcome.” A project manager uses agile project management tools and expertise to ensure a project’s needs are met and the desired outcome happens. A few examples of projects include software development, building construction and geographical sales expansion.\n\nProject Management Methodologies\n\nThere are many ways to manage a project. Some project management methodologies include:\n\nWaterfall\n\nAgile\n\nExtreme Programming (XP)\n\nPRINCE2\n\nSix Sigma\n\nCritical Path Method (CPM)\n\nCritical Chain Project Management (CCPM)\n\nOrganizations choose a specific project management methodology based on their budget, team size, timeline and risk level. Because of the continuous value it delivers, the Agile methodology is one of the most popular project management approaches in use today.\n\nWhat Is Agile Project Management and How Does It Work?\n\nAgile project management is an iterative approach to project management that is flexible, incremental and non-linear. It relies on customer feedback and ensures benefits are delivered throughout the lifecycle of a project. Other approaches deliver benefits primarily at the end of a project.\n\nAgile project management works by allowing teams to effectively break large projects down into reasonably sized tasks. As a result, the smaller tasks are carried out in brief iterations throughout the project’s lifecycle. This saves time and streamline a team’s workflow. Using Agile methodologies also helps Agile project managers and teams adjust to the ever-changing requirements of a given project.\n\nObjectives and Principles of Agile\n\nThere are 12 core principles of the Agile project management methodology, per the Agile Manifesto. As stated by the Agile Alliance, they are:\n\nSatisfy the customer through the early and continuous delivery of valuable software.\n\nWelcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.\n\nDeliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.\n\nBusiness people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.\n\nBuild projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.\n\nThe most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.\n\nWorking software is the primary measure of progress.\n\nAgile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.\n\nContinuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.\n\nSimplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential.\n\nThe best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.\n\nAt regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.\n\nAgile project management has several objectives. They include defining the vision of a project and starting in a broad direction. Learning and adapting as well as evolving towards the target are also important objectives of this approach.\n\nPopular Agile Project Management Frameworks\n\nThere is more than one type of Agile project management approach. For example, Scrum and Kanban are two popular Agile approaches. Each has a specific framework and a unique process.\n\nThe Scrum framework outlines a set of practices, values and principles that help a Scrum team deliver a service or product. A Scrum team includes a product owner, responsible for maintaining the product backlog, Scrum Master and developers. The team produces three artifacts and participates in five events. The Scrum framework is explained fully in the Scrum Guide.\n\nThe Kanban framework is often used to implement DevOps and Agile software development. Complete transparency of work and real-time communication of capacity are requirements of the framework. The development team applies the framework using a Kanban board to post work items that can be observed visually at all times.\n\nThe Scrum framework is best for small Agile teams responsible for projects with changing deliverables and unknown solutions. The Kanban framework is most appropriate for teams dealing with many incoming requests of different sizes.\n\nAgile vs. Other Methods\n\nThere are several key differences between Agile project management and traditional forms of project management, such as Waterfall. Compared to other methods, Agile project management prioritizes:\n\nCollaboration with customers over contract negotiation\n\nPrototyping effective solution over documentation\n\nAdapting to changes over following a plan\n\nPeople over tools and processes\n\nBecause it allows teams to easily adapt to changing requirements and consistently delivers value throughout the process of completing a project, Agile project management is often the best choice for software development projects.\n\nWhen to Use Agile Project Management\n\nThe best time to use an Agile project management approach is when time-to-market is vital and/or a project is very complex. Also, “Agile project management is most effective when a project’s requirements are not fully discernible from the outset or are likely to evolve over the project’s duration,” according to an article by CIO.\n\nAgile project management is also helpful for projects requiring ongoing feedback.\n\nWhy Is Agile Important?\n\nIn the age of digital transformation, Agile project management is becoming increasingly important. This is because it enables organizations to seamlessly migrate to a digital workplace and better manage projects. It can even help improve operations across the entire organization.\n\nAgile is also important because it helps development teams stay within a given budget and complete projects on time. Further, Agile makes it easier for the development team and the product owner to communicate, and it boosts customer satisfaction.\n\nImplementing Agile Project Management in Your Business\n\nAgile implementation starts with choosing an Agile method (Scrum, Kanban or another framework). Once you’ve chosen an Agile framework, it’s time to:\n\nSet an end goal. With Agile, you have to start with the end in mind. Consider creating a broad user story for the entire project with a defined end goal.\n\nSchedule a planning meeting with all project teams. This will help you get everyone who needs to be involved in the migration to Agile project management on the same page.\n\nCreate a release plan set at regular intervals. Continuous feedback is an important aspect of Agile. By creating a release plan set at regular intervals, you can help ensure feedback is consistently given and considered.\n\nCreate a sprint plan. Your first sprint plan can be crafted by considering which feature or product will be released at the end of the sprint. Also, keep in mind what work is needed to get there.\n\nOnce an Agile project management approach has been implemented, meet with the project manager often. This will ensure all project teams are on target to complete their projects on time.\n\nPros and Cons of Agile Project Management and Debunking Myths\n\nWe’ve covered many of the pros of using Agile. For example, implementing Agile techniques can:\n\nShift the focus to the needs of customers and stakeholders\n\nMinimize resources to reduce waste\n\nIncrease productivity\n\nBoost collaboration\n\nHelp teams quickly deploy solutions\n\nShorten turnaround times for projects\n\nThere are also cons to using Agile methodologies, including limited documentation, insufficient resource planning and fragmented output. Lack of metrics and an inability to maintain good team dynamics with cross-functional teams are other disadvantages.\n\nBelieving myths about using Agile practices can keep organizations from choosing the best approach for specific projects. Some of the most common myths regarding the Agile approach to project management are mentioned below.\n\nMyth #1: Agile is the right approach for any project\n\nAgile is a beneficial project management approach, but only for the appropriate projects. It’s not helpful to use Agile for every project.\n\n“I believe agile project management isn’t a silver bullet, but one of many bullets in your armory of change, but with the target to create a value and business outcome-driven delivery approach,” said David Aldridge, PM practice technical coach, Allianz in an article by the Association for Project Management.\n\nFor example, tight-budget projects with no time limit, full and fixed business requirements and a requirement to follow a fixed process may be better suited to Waterfall than Agile.\n\nMyth #2: With Agile, you can skip governance\n\nAnother major myth about the Agile approach to project management is that it is not stable and doesn’t need the solid governance traditional methods require. Although Agile project management isn’t as structured as other approaches, it still requires strong governance.\n\nExamples of strong governance include stakeholder alignment, setting clear objectives, establishing purpose and providing documentation.\n\nMyth #3: Agile is solely for software development\n\nAgile is often used for software development projects, but that’s not all it’s good for. The Agile approach to project management can be used for any project that would benefit from consistent delivery, early value realization and a strong focus on customers. However, Agile software development approaches (such as SAFe and Scrum) should be used only on IT projects.\n\nAgile Project Management Best Practices and Techniques\n\nAgile project management best practices can help ensure a successful outcome for projects. They include but are not limited to:\n\nMaintaining charts to monitor progress\n\nEncouraging self-organizing teams\n\nUsing planning meetings to create sprint backlogs\n\nPresenting work during sprint reviews\n\nCreating release plans\n\nSetting realistic project timelines and pacing\n\nEstimating the projected velocity\n\nReducing risks by creating spike solutions\n\nIt’s also beneficial to give team members regular opportunities to communicate in person and to cross-train team members to make them more adaptable and effective.\n\nCareers and Job Outlook\n\nProject managers and other project management professionals are in high demand. According to What is Project Management?, 25,000,000 project managers will be needed by 2030 to meet global demands.\n\nProject management job outlook and job growth is significant and predicted at 6% through 2032, reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Project manager jobs tend to be high-paying. According to the BLS, the average project manager salary, or project management specialist average salary, is $95,370 per year.\n\nAccording to Coursera, 68% of project managers hold a bachelor’s degree and 14% hold a master’s degree. Common degree focuses include information technology or computer science, information systems or business administration. Most project managers possess project management certifications and have completed project management courses to increase their knowledge and skill sets.\n\nSkills and Responsibilities of Agile Project Managers\n\nAn Agile project manager has an important role in scaling Agile. They must guide and coach project teams to succeed. They must help define project scope, keep track of project progress, manage project risks and monitor the development process.\n\nAgile project managers also establish relationships with stakeholders and use Agile tools, such as Initiatives, to manage the progress of projects. Other key responsibilities include:\n\nTeaching team members Agile methodologies\n\nPromoting compliance\n\nUpdating stakeholders on project progress\n\nAddressing hindrances to team performance\n\nLeading team meetings\n\nProducing and analyzing project metrics\n\nFacilitating delivery of projects while staying within budget, timeline and scope\n\nThere are many project management skills an Agile project manager should have, such as risk management, Agile expertise and collaboration. Other key skills are:\n\nOrganization\n\nProblem-solving\n\nCreativity\n\nNegotiation and accountability\n\nLeadership\n\nAgile planning\n\nConflict resolution\n\nCybersecurity\n\nTeam-building\n\nGoal setting\n\nBudgeting\n\nIT management\n\nDecision-making\n\nReliability\n\nTime management\n\nThe most successful Agile project managers also possess strong adaptability skills.\n\nHow CompTIA Project+ Can Help\n\nInterested in becoming a project manager, Agile project manager or project management professional?
