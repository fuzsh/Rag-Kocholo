        "text": "What is Agile methodology?\n\nAgile methodology in project management is a structured approach that segments projects into manageable phases, focusing on continuous improvement. It is an iterative process that involves planning, execution, and evaluation.\n\nIn this article, we share everything you need to know about Agile methodologies, Agile project management, Agile methodology frameworks, and how to implement them in your team. We’ll also share our Agile teamwork template to get started with Agile even faster.\n\nWhat is Agile project management?\n\nAgile project management is a process for managing a project that involves constant collaboration and working in iterations. It works off the basis that a project can be continuously improved upon throughout its lifecycle and adapt to changes quickly.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using Agile methodology?\n\nAgile is one of the most popular approaches to project management because it is flexible, it is adaptable to changes, and it encourages customer feedback.\n\nMany teams embrace this approach to achieve the following benefits of Agile:\n\nRapid progress: By effectively reducing the time it takes to complete various stages of a project, teams can elicit feedback in real time and produce working prototypes or demos throughout the process\n\nCustomer and stakeholder alignment: Through focusing on customer concerns and stakeholder feedback, the Agile team is well positioned to produce results that satisfy the right people\n\nContinuous improvement: As an iterative approach, the Agile project management methodology allows teams to chip away at tasks until they reach the best end result\n\nYou can read more about the six stages of the Agile lifecycle in our Agile guide.\n\nSee below an example from Wrike’s Agile project management dashboard from our Agile teamwork template.\n\n[Continue reading after the image]\n\nTypes of Agile methodologies\n\nAgile project management is not a singular framework but an umbrella term that includes a wide range of methodologies, including Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP), and the Adaptive Project Framework (APF).\n\nScrum\n\nIt is ideal for projects with rapidly changing requirements, using short sprints.\n\nKanban\n\nIt visualizes project progress and is great for tasks requiring steady output.\n\nLean\n\nIt streamlines processes, eliminating waste for customer value.\n\nExtreme Programming (XP)\n\nIt enhances software quality and responsiveness to customer satisfaction.\n\nAdaptive Project Framework (APF)\n\nIt works well for projects with unclear details, as it adapts to constantly evolving client needs.\n\nYou can learn more about the different types of Agile methodologies in our guide.\n\nAgile methodologies vs. traditional approaches\n\nSo, how do these Agile methodologies compare to traditional approaches to project management? Let’s highlight the Waterfall approach as an example.\n\nWhen working with this traditional methodology, teams would follow a strictly linear sequence: requirements gathering, design, build, test, deliver. They are required to complete one phase before moving on to the next one. Changes are difficult to incorporate once a stage is completed and customer interactions are limited. As a result, Waterfall suits projects with fixed guidelines and minimal changes.\n\nBy comparison, Agile methodologies are far more fluid in nature. Every Agile framework emphasizes a degree of adaptability, breaking projects into phases and embracing changing requirements. Through iterations and incremental efforts, they incorporate collaboration and customer feedback, leading to continuous improvement.\n\nAgile in software development\n\nAgile enables software development teams to stay adaptable.\n\nWith an iterative and adaptive approach, the aim is to produce the highest-quality software product that puts the customer at the heart of the process. By prioritizing flexibility, Agile teams can quickly react to changes, deliver products faster, and thrive in a collaborative environment.\n\nBy building Agile teams with the right qualities — such as self-organization and effective collaboration — you can accelerate the software development process while leaving space for vital customer feedback.\n\nOne of the most compelling reasons to adopt the Agile approach in software development is the dynamic workflows and work systems that contribute to a better end product. By listening to customer feedback and carrying out several iterations and rounds of software testing, you can iron out any kinks along the way and build the best possible software.\n\nThe Agile software development lifecycle helps you break down each project you take on into six simple stages:\n\nConcept: Define the project scope and priorities\n\nInception: Build the Agile team according to project requirements\n\nIteration: Create code factoring in customer feedback\n\nRelease: Test the code and troubleshoot any issues\n\nMaintenance: Provide ongoing tech support to ensure the product remains serviceable\n\nRetirement: The end of the product lifespan, which often coincides with the beginning of a new one\n\nRead more about the Agile software development lifecycle in our Agile guide.\n\nAgile methodology in non-software projects\n\nWhile many think of the Agile methodology as a solution mostly for the software industry, its applications extend far beyond.\n\nHere are some examples of Agile practices in action in various project types:\n\nMarketing campaigns\n\nBy bringing together designers, marketers, writers, and colleagues from other departments, you can build a cross-functional team ready to tackle marketing campaigns. Using sprints and a task backlog, you can identify the highest-priority tasks and streamline the execution.\n\nTo explore this approach, download this eBook: 7 Steps to Developing an Agile Marketing Team.\n\nEvent planning\n\nAgile methodologies lend themselves well to event planning, as each part of the event can be broken down into a sprint, and daily standups or Kanban boards can help you maintain a clear strategic direction at all times.\n\nProduct development\n\nAs you might imagine, since Agile methodology works for virtual products, it can work just as well for physical products. This time, though, instead of troubleshooting code, you’ll be diagnosing and fixing prototypes.\n\nGenerally, to get the best out of any of the Agile methodologies for non-software projects, you should always aim to keep the customer in mind. Just as Agile development must factor in the end user, non-software use cases benefit from a customer-focused approach.\n\nBy integrating the customer and their feedback in everything you do, you can better organize your priorities and plan your phases. It’s also a good idea to evaluate whether you need a systematic approach to tackling major projects or an easy-to-follow visual workflow for a series of smaller projects, as this can influence which framework is best for your team.\n\nWith Wrike’s Agile template, you can kick-start your product development in no time.\n\nHow to implement Agile methodology into projects\n\nIf you’re wondering how to apply these theoretical frameworks to your team’s workflows, here’s a step-by-step guide for Agile methodology process implementation:\n\n1. Choose the right Agile framework\n\nYour first priority is to select the right Agile framework for your team.\n\nHere’s a reminder of some of the most popular options:\n\nScrum: Principle-based project management\n\nKanban: Visual workflows and processes\n\nScrumban: Hybrid of Scrum and Kanban\n\nXP: Customer-focused product development\n\nAPF: Versatile teamwork\n\nDynamic systems development method (DSDM): Focused on the software development lifecycle\n\nWhen selecting an Agile framework, consider the size of your team, the specific project requirements, and the level of experience your team has with the various methodologies.\n\nThe more you know about your team and the projects you handle on a regular basis, the easier it will be for you to pick the right framework every time.\n\n2. Assemble your Agile team\n\nAn Agile team isn’t like any ordinary team.\n\nIf you want to find success with any of the Agile methodologies, you need to build a team with clear roles and responsibilities and a culture of collaboration.\n\nWhat are some of the responsibilities of an Agile team?\n\nSelf-organization: One of the cornerstones of an Agile team is the ability to self-organize. In Agile project management, the onus is on individual team members and teams to take initiative and organize themselves in a way that will lead to the highest output.\n\nCross-functional collaboration: Going hand in hand with the need for self-organization is the Agile demand for cross-functional collaboration. Agile teams have to relay information across departments and be able to work closely with a range of colleagues.\n\nIteration planning: Specific to Agile project management, iteration planning requires team members to outline the scope of individual sprints according to the product backlog.\n\n3. Plan the project\n\nNow that you’ve selected one of the Agile methods and assembled your A-team, it’s time to plan out your project.\n\nMeticulous planning is one of the secret ingredients of successful Agile project management.\n\nFrom the outset, you need to spend time clearly defining your project goals and scope. This will prevent unexpected setbacks and allow you to break down each portion of the project into manageable sprints (if you’re using Scrum).\n\nYou might also draw up a product backlog during the planning phase, which is most common in software development projects. The product backlog allows you to assign a priority level to your tasks so everyone on the team knows what they should focus on.\n\n[Continue reading after the animation]\n\n4. Manage stakeholder expectations\n\nBefore you get your project underway, it’s important to check in with any key stakeholders to make sure you factor in their feedback.\n\nDepending on the level of their involvement, your project stakeholders may then want to be kept in the loop throughout the process or at least receive regular updates. Creating feedback loops eases any uncertainty on the stakeholder end and allows you to stay open to change should it be necessary at any stage of the process.\n\n5. Measure success\n\nMeasuring project success is key to making meaningful progress with your Agile methodology of choice.\n\nBy paying attention to what worked and what didn’t during the project management process, you can extract key lessons to apply to future Agile projects.\n\nThere are various ways to effectively track progress and measure success with Agile projects:\n\nDaily standups: Brief meetings to discuss obstacles and find solutions\n\nSprint reviews: Informal sit-down meetings to present work and solicit team feedback\n\nRetrospectives: Reflections on past work to inspire and influence future progress\n\nYou should also introduce key performance indicators (KPIs) before embarking on any new major project, as getting specific will help you establish milestones and measure progress.\n\nImplement Agile processes with Wrike\n\nNow, you’re probably ready to start using Agile in project management following the steps we’ve shared.
