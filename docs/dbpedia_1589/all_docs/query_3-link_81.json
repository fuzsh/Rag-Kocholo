        "text": "Agile software development\n\nis an iterative and incremental method of software development that aims to respond flexibly to changing requirements. In contrast to traditional, sequential development methods (such as the waterfall model), the agile methodology emphasizes collaboration, customer involvement and the delivery of functional software in short development cycles known as iterations or sprints.\n\nHere are some principles and characteristics of agile software development:\n\nIterative development: work is done in short iterations of one to four weeks. At the end of each iteration, functional software is delivered.\n\nCustomer centricity: Cooperation with the customer is of central importance. The customer is actively involved in the development process and their feedback is regularly taken into account to ensure that the software meets the requirements.\n\nIncremental development: The software is developed incrementally, with new features and improvements being added step by step. This enables early and continuous delivery of valuable products.\n\nFlexibility and adaptability: Agile methods encourage a focus on changes in requirements. This means that the development team should be able to adapt quickly to new requirements and change priorities.\n\nSelf-organizing teams: Agile teams are self-organized and self-responsible. Team members take on different roles and the team structure encourages collaboration and the exchange of ideas.\n\nContinuous feedback: Agile processes integrate regular feedback into the development cycle. This includes feedback from customers, stakeholders and within the development team.\n\nAgile methods were developed in the 1990s as a response to traditional development methods that were perceived as inflexible. One of the most important manifestations of agile principles is the Agile Manifesto, which was published in 2001 by a group of software developers. The signatories included well-known personalities such as Kent Beck, Martin Fowler and Jeff Sutherland.\n\nThe Agile Manifesto emphasizes values such as individual and interactive collaboration, working software as the primary measure of progress, collaboration with the customer and the ability to respond to change. Agile methods have spread successfully since their introduction in software development and are now used in various industries and for different types of projects.\n\nAdaptive software development\n\nAdaptive software development refers to an agile development method that focuses particularly on adaptability to change and uncertainty. Unlike other agile methods that are based on fixed plans, adaptive software development emphasizes continuous adaptation to changing requirements and circumstances throughout the development process.\n\nHere are some key characteristics of adaptive software development:\n\nFlexibility: adaptive software development emphasizes responding flexibly to change. This means that adjustments to requirements can be easily implemented during the development process.\n\nContinuous adaptation: In the adaptive approach, the development process is viewed as a constantly evolving and adapting process. Adjustments can be made based on customer feedback, new requirements or other factors.\n\nEarly delivery: Similar to other agile methods, adaptive software development emphasizes delivering functional software early and regularly. This enables a faster response to feedback and changes.\n\nCustomer involvement: Cooperation with the customer is an important part of adaptive software development. The constant exchange with the customer makes it possible to better understand the requirements and adapt the software accordingly.\n\nSelf-organizing teams: Adaptive software development promotes self-organizing teams that are able to make decisions on the spot and react flexibly to changes.\n\nIt is important to note that adaptive software development is considered a “special form” of agile methods. The term is sometimes also used as a synonym for adaptive software development methods such as ASD (Adaptive Software Development), which was developed by Jim Highsmith.\n\nOverall, adaptive software development aims to create a dynamic and responsive approach to software development to ensure that the end product meets current needs and requirements.\n\nDifferentiation between agile and adaptive methods\n\nAdaptive software development is a specific variant or subcategory within the broader framework of agile software development. Although both are based on common values such as flexibility, collaboration and customer focus, there are still differences in specific practices and areas of focus.\n\nHere are some differences and specific characteristics that might distinguish Adaptive Software Development from other agile approaches:\n\nStronger emphasis on adaptability: the name “Adaptive Software Development” already indicates that the method places a special emphasis on the ability to adapt flexibly and quickly to changes. This could mean that adaptations are made on a higher scale and faster than in other agile methods.\n\nContinuous adaptation as a key principle: Adaptive software development may emphasize more than other methods that continuous adaptation to changing circumstances and requirements is a fundamental principle of the development process.\n\nHigher tolerance for uncertainty: Since adaptive software development aims to adapt to uncertainty, it might have a higher tolerance for uncertainty and changing requirements. This could be particularly important if requirements change significantly during the development process.\n\nThe terms and their meanings may vary depending on the context. In practice, there may be overlaps and different interpretations. So when we talk about a “special characteristic”, this means that adaptive software development has certain focal points, principles or practices that distinguish it from other agile methods."
