        "text": "In software development, Agile and SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) are two distinct methodologies. Agile emphasizes iterative development, rapid feedback, and flexibility to adapt to changing requirements, ideal for small-scale projects. SDLC, follows a systematic approach with sequential stages like planning, design, development, testing, and deployment, suitable for projects of any size. While Agile promotes continuous cycles and customer involvement throughout, SDLC ensures clear roles, documentation, and structured delivery, making it easier to manage complex projects with defined milestones and processes.\n\nWhat is Agile?\n\nAgile is a well-known development methodology and the best approach for many development teams, especially those looking to create a continuous delivery environment. It focuses on iterative development, short cycles, getting feedback and adapting to the new requirements. Solutions develop through interactions between self-organizing cross-functional teams. Agile is a mindset from the Agile Manifesto which came out in 2001 containing 12 principles and 4 values written by 17 software developers. Mainly it is an approach towards the software development life cycle process.\n\nBenefits of Agile\n\nIncreased product quality\n\nIncreased development speed\n\nBetter customer satisfaction\n\nContinuous improvement\n\nReduced risks\n\nWhat is SDLC?\n\nSDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a type of process which is followed by many software organizations. It can be used to develop both software or hardware components. This process ensures that the out products are efficient and high-quality. SDLC comprises planning, defining the requirements, designing the product architecture, building the product, testing, deployment and maintenance. product, testing, deployment and maintenance. SDLC is additionally referred to as Application Development Life Cycle. SDLC has several models with their separate steps. The most popular ones are –\n\nWaterfall Model\n\nIterative Model\n\nSpiral Model\n\nV-Model\n\nBig Bang Model\n\nBenefits of SDLC :\n\nGives clarity to the project development\n\nDocuments big pictures as well as details\n\nKeeps development systematic\n\nProvides clear roles and responsibilities to different members\n\nDecreased project risk\n\nSimilarities between Agile and SDLC\n\nBoth involve planning: Both Agile and SDLC involve planning at the beginning of the software development process.\n\nBoth involve testing: Both Agile and SDLC involve testing at various stages of the software development process to ensure that the software meets the desired requirements and specifications.\n\nBoth involve development: Both Agile and SDLC involve the actual development of software, with a focus on delivering high-quality code.\n\nBoth involve delivery: Both Agile and SDLC methodologies are focused on delivering a working software product at the end of the development process.\n\nBoth involve feedback: Both Agile and SDLC methodologies involve feedback from stakeholders throughout the development process to ensure that the software product meets their needs and expectations.\n\nBoth involve documentation: Both Agile and SDLC methodologies involve documentation of the development process, including requirements, design, and testing.\n\nDifference between Agile and SDLC\n\nAspect\n\nAGILE\n\nSDLC\n\nDefinition Agile is a methodology following an iterative approach used for project management purposes. SDLC is a process of design and development of a product or service. Ease of Use It is easier to use and implement. Software Development Life Cycle is easy to understand and needs little systematic approach for implementation. Origin and History It came out in 2001 and it was made by a joint collaboration of 17 software developers. Software Development Life Cycle was found in 1960. Structure Agile constitutes of different phases. SDLC constitutes of different stages Approach Speed Agile has a faster approach comparatively. SDLC has a systematic approach. Project Suitability Agile is more suited for small scale projects. SDLC can be used for any sized projects Flexibility Agile allows dynamic changes in requirements. SDLC doesn’t allow changes after initial stage. Process Flow It follows a continuous cycle. It follows a sequential stages. Stakeholder Involvement It requires close customer involvement. It requires close project manager involvement.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions on Agile vs SDLC – FAQs\n\n1. What are the phases of SDLC?\n\nSDLC consist of six phase:\n\nPlanning\n\nDefining\n\nDesigning\n\nDevelopment\n\nDeployment\n\n2. What is an Agile process model?\n\nAn Agile process model is a software development approach that focuses on iterative cycles of planning, executing, and delivering software in short, frequent increments, enabling flexibility and continuous improvement based on customer feedback.\n\n3. What are Agile phases?\n\nFollowing are the phases of Agile:\n\nConcept\n\nInception\n\nIteration\n\nRelease\n\nMaintenance"
