        "text": "Agile project management is an approach to product development based on iteration, or on taking incremental steps, to create and improve a design. In agile methods of project management, teams divide a project into sprints. These are roughly two-week periods at the end of which, ideally, the team delivers some functional product.\n\nThe development team releases a deliverable to a stakeholder at the end of the sprint, be it internal functions or external customers. Team members then receive feedback from stakeholders, and then they incorporate this feedback into future iterations of the product or solution.\n\nRather than managing to a fixed specification, agile methodologies of project management leave the final version of the product open. Agile teams are focused on customers and their feedback rather than on some preconceived notion of a product, created internally.\n\nWhat is Scrum/Agile project management?\n\nScrum is an agile framework often used in software development projects. It is one way of implementing the agile approach in project teams. Whereas the Agile Manifesto issued a set of principles for software development, the Scrum Guide (2010, edited 2020) provides steps, explains the process, and defines roles for implementing agile principles.\n\nThese Agile roles include:\n\nDevelopers: Team members involved in the agile software development process during each Sprint.\n\nProduct Owner: Manager responsible for prioritizing the product backlog; accountable for representing the product, the end-user, and all stakeholders throughout the product lifecycle. The product owner also oversees the product roadmap.\n\nScrum Master: Responsible for aligning the team according to the framework in the Scrum Guide, and keeping it on track per Scrum principles.\n\nScrum teams also use standup meetings to improve collaboration and keep the team on the same page. These are 15-minute meetings where the team, the product owners, and scrum masters use agile planning to strategize how to meet the goals of the sprint and of the development cycle.\n\nWhat is the difference between an Agile Project Manager and a Scrum Master?\n\nThe Scrum Master’s role…\n\nFocused set of responsibilities to ensure that the Agile ceremonies and deliverables are following Agile best practices.\n\nThe Agile Project Manager’s role…\n\nBridges Agile and standard milestone project management\n\nFocus on budgets, schedules, and managing other resources outside the team\n\nManages dependencies\n\nLinks projects to the Project Management Office (PMO)\n\nThey can co-exist or you can have one or the other exclusively\n\nWhy agile project management?\n\nAgile project management allows teams to adapt and change. In contrast to traditional project management, such as the waterfall method, agile project management does not depend on a static product plan that is created using a fixed data set, established at the beginning of a project.\n\nFor example, depending on the length of the development project, the customer research a team conducted may no longer be the best data by the time the product comes to market. The information derived from that data has changed, while the team is in the midst of its workflow, but the team did not change with it.\n\nThus agile project management is a problem solving methodology. It sees the product development process as a long series of customer problems to be solved. The final product emerges from the activity of the team, as it responds dynamically to stakeholder feedback.\n\nIn this approach, project planning is not a one time activity. Agile planning is an adaptive response to shifting conditions, always keeping quality and customer value as the compass that indicates the team’s direction.\n\nWhen do you use agile project management?\n\nAgile project management is most useful in any industry or product category where changes occur at a high rate of speed. Since agile project management is oriented toward creating customer value, it is useful within any industry. However, large scale enterprises may need to adapt the simpler models, such as the Kanban Board or sprints, to apply to their more complex product development environments.\n\nCompanies can and do select practices from the agile project management domain, be they burndown charts, user stories, story points, Kanban Boards, standup meetings, or other tools that they adapt and apply to their organizations.\n\nThere are thus, no fixed conditions in which it is predictable that agile project management tools will work or not work. However, agile consulting can help bring experience and knowledge to the table.\n\nWhat is agile methodology for project management?\n\nThere are a number of methodologies used to make agile principles actionable. Scrum, described above, is one of these frameworks. Kanban and SAFe are other frameworks.\n\nKanban is a lean production methodology, which means that it centers around 1) creating customer value, and 2) eliminating non-value-added activities. The Kanban board is the main tool of this methodology.\n\nThe Kanban board visualizes the tasks that need to be done divided into three categories: 1) To-Do, 2) Work in Progress, and 3) Done. At a glance, all stakeholders can see the status of all relevant tasks. Kanban may use metrics such as team velocity and cycle time, defined as the average time to complete a given task.\n\nScaled Agile Framework (known as SAFe) is another agile project management methodology. It is mostly used in larger organizations, where breaking down complex initiatives into tasks, and then into sprints or Scrums, is difficult. SAFe essentially involves a “Scrum of Scrums” or a “team of teams” working in a separate but collaborative way to yield a new product.\n\nThere are other frameworks such as Lean Product Development that are closely allied with agile and have many of the same characteristics and goals. The beauty of agile is that, contrary to popular belief, it is not a dogmatic process model but a flexible set of principles. Companies can and do select certain practices from agile and its related frameworks that work best for their industry or products: from developing apps to developing large, tangible products.\n\nWhat do you do at the end of each iteration?\n\nAt the end of an iteration teams often conduct a sprint retrospective also known as a sprint review. They identify what went right and what went wrong, and the strengths and weaknesses of the team. Retrospectives are a powerful way for self-organizing teams to move toward continuous improvement.\n\nTeams may also perform sprint planning, incorporating user feedback, while looking toward the goals of the next sprint. This iterative approach, ending and then beginning again, is an essential element of agile processes.\n\nWhat are the five agile project management model phases?\n\nThe five phases of agile project management were published in 2004 by Jim Highsmith. They were a variation, tailored to agile management, of the Project Management Institute’s (PMI) Project Management Book of Knowledge.\n\nThe five phases of agile project management include:\n\n1. Envision: A team conceives of a product; identifies the principal stakeholders; discusses the project’s goals; and begins to research customer requirements.\n\n2. Speculate: The team creates a list of features and breaks down the project into its critical tasks.\n\n3. Explore & Execute: The development team then discusses the means of delivering a high quality product; they focus on a project delivery that meets user needs. They then get to work, often creating a series of prototypes that are put in front of customers.\n\n4. Adapt: In agile project management, the ability to adapt is crucial. Teams are not managing to a fixed plan, but respond, throughout the development cycle to how they can deliver on user stories. They incorporate feedback in an iterative fashion.\n\n5. Close: In this phase, the teams create a deliverable that meets their current understanding of customer needs and requirements. They might conduct a review to improve their process or execution in the future.\n\nWhat software enables agile project management?\n\nThere are numerous software tools that aim to help teams with agile project management.\n\nSome that you definitely have to take a look at are as following:\n\nClickUp\n\nThis package offers many tools such as sprint workflow automation.
