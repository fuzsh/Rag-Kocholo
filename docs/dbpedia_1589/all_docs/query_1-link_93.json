        "text": "Agile planning is a collaborative, iterative process that helps teams consistently align on objectives and progress. Unlike traditional project management methods such as Waterfall, Agile planning happens at every phase instead of only before any work can begin. In this way, Agile teams can get started sooner, adapt to changes faster, and make sure the objective and strategy still hold true as progress is made.\n\nAnother difference between Agile and traditional project planning is that you donât spend all your time planning upfront for more extended time frames. With Agile methodology, for example, you wouldnât take the first two months to plan out the rest of the year.\n\nThe idea is that Agile planning leads to better outcomes and fewer roadblocks that derail projects.\n\nAgile planning balances a flexible approach with well-defined milestones and releases.\n\nDevelop and adjust your plan as needed, but also ensure your team knows the priorities and how they align with the main objective. The Agile planning process includes the following steps.\n\n1. Document project vision (Strategy and portfolio)\n\nWhen using Agile methodology, start with a user story. Most commonly used in software development, a user story is the who, what, and why of your project. A development team will describe their user, what they need, and why it will help them.\n\nIn the simplest terms, youâll write something like this:\n\nAs a [describe your user], I want to [describe product or software] so that I can [benefit statement, or the why of your project].\n\nWith a solid user story, the next steps become a lot easier.\n\nDefine the objective and strategy that will help you fulfill that story.\n\nSet project KPIs so your team knows how success will be measured.\n\nThen, outline the biggest, most important solutions. This could be one product or many. If your user story requires multiple solutions, youâll create your portfolio and prioritize what to work on first.\n\nBy the end of this phase, youâll have:\n\nA user story\n\nStrategy and objectives\n\nPortfolio of products or one product defined\n\n2. Create a product roadmap\n\nHere, youâll outline the specific requirements for completing the project. Youâll take each product from your portfolio and create your product roadmap.\n\nThis is the high-level strategic overview of your product. Your roadmap needs to outline the features necessary to meet the project requirements.\n\nYour roadmap might look like a grid with the following line items for each release:\n\nObjective\n\nMain features\n\nMetrics or milestone\n\n3. Define and plan releases\n\nEven though Agile planning is, of course, Agile, you still need some major releases planned so that you know youâre staying on track.\n\nOnce you have the strategy locked in, you know the steps to get there, and your project must-haves, youâll plan releases and have your project team agree to them.\n\nThis might look like having a minimum viable product (MVP) ready by a certain date, noting all the requirements it must meet.\n\nThis step and the roadmap might be developed in tandem, but youâll clarify details regarding releases here.\n\nWhen youâre in this phase, youâll define releases by scope and requirements more than by strict deadlines. Teams often use quarters to set releases so that it can happen sometime within those three months.\n\n4. Plan the iteration\n\nIn this step, youâll create tasks, assign team members, and plan deliverables for each release.\n\nIf you use the Scrum framework for your Agile projects, this step will be considered Sprint Planning.\n\nSprints are typically 1-3 week durations where team members decide on priorities and only focus on those tasks. Sprints consist of current, future, and backlog lists.\n\nItems should not get added or removed from the current Sprint once itâs started. If necessary, the entire team should agree and adjust plans.\n\nIf youâre not using Sprints, youâll still plan out what happens during a specific period so that your whole team focuses on the right priorities.\n\n5. Plan Daily stand-ups\n\nAgain, if youâre using Scrum, this will be your daily Stand-up or daily Scrum meeting.\n\nLed by the Scrum Master, youâll meet for 15 minutes to discuss whatâs happening that day and any roadblocks you have.\n\nIf youâre using an Agile project management tool to automate your daily Stand-ups, your team will answer three questions and submit their Stand-up:\n\nWhat did you work on today?\n\nWhat will you work on tomorrow?\n\nAny roadblocks standing in your way?\n\nThe nice thing about Agile project management is that you can do all your planning using the Google Suite, such as Docs and Sheets.\n\nHowever, there are Agile project management tools that make this whole process more streamlined and get your team involved with the process.Â\n\nIf youâre ready to ditch traditional project management approaches, Hubstaff with the Tasks add-on is one example that provides Agile features in a simple, visual format. You can use Sprints, Stand-ups, Epics, and Kanban-style project boards in one app. We use Tasks for our own Agile software development and project execution, and we can vouch that it will greatly improve your project management.\n\nYou can comment on tasks and assign a team member, add release dates to each task, plan backlog and future Sprints, and much more. Whether youâre handling software development projects, marketing initiatives, or project managing a logistics team, Tasks can help you take your projects to the next level."
