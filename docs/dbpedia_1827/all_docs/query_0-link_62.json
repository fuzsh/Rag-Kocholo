        "text": "Edmund of Woodstock was only twenty-nine when Roger Mortimer engineered his execution in March 1330 for allegedly plotting to restore his half-brother, Edward II, to the throne. His judicial murder shocked and horrified the nobility, and spurred Edward III into seizing control of the throne from his mother, Queen Isabella, and her lover, Mortimer, in the bold coup of October 1330. Edmund's short career has attracted little attention from historians, although he has the distinction of being the only member of Edward II's family to die for him. He was six years old when Edward II came to the throne, grew to adulthood under his half-brother's protection, and rose to prominence at his side, being granted an earldom and given successive military and diplomatic appointments. Edmund was involved in the Despenser war of 1321–22, the French war of 1324–25, the removal of Edward II from the throne in 1326–27, and the Lancastrian revolt of 1328–29. His attitude towards the crown in these crises is a reminder of the importance of solidarity within the royal family, and that personal factors often determined political allegiance. Edmund's natural loyalty was to the crown; kinship, duty and affection bound him to Edward II, and he was executed for attempting to rescue him, but when the king most needed his support, in 1326, Edmund joined his enemies. This reappraisal of Edmund's career examines the background and pressures which affected his loyalty to the crown, exploring the complexity of his relationship with Edward II, and the personal loyalty which led him to his death.\n\nWhen Edmund was born at Woodstock Palace on 5 August 1301, Edward I was delighted with the arrival of his younger son by his second queen, Margaret of France, and rewarded the messenger John Pyade handsomely for bringing news of the birth. Edmund was the last of several sons born to Edward I, of whom only three survived to adulthood; Edward of Carnarvon (born 1284), Thomas of Brotherton (born 1300) and Edmund. As was customary, Edmund did not stay with his parents and shared a household with Thomas, later joined by their sister Eleanor, all three financed by the royal exchequer."
