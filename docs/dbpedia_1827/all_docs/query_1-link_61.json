Face full of character and eyes splendidly rendered.\n\nAs for the heraldry in 54mm scale this is superb. I hope I can paint like this one day.\n\nCheers\n\nNicolas\n\nVery nice painting Luca. I have this one myself and have repainted it several times over the years and this is the latest incarnation. Nowhere near as good as yours, just for comparison.\n\nAttached Files:\n\n022.JPG\n\nFile size:\n\n1.3 MB\n\nViews:\n\n231\n\nYes I know, but they look so good together and I would never put them in a competition."
