        "text": "GLOUCESTER\n\nEngland has never had such a king before him. He was virtuous and good, a born leader. His sword shined, its light could blind men around him. His arms were wider than a dragon's wings. His bright eyes were so full of angry fire that his glare blinded and drove away his enemies. The fire in his eyes was brighter than the sun shining in his enemies' faces at noon. What else can I say? Words don't do his actions justice. He succeeded every time he set out to do something.\n\nEXETER\n\nWe mourn dressed in black, but shouldn't we mourn by shedding blood? Henry is dead and will never live again. We are here around a wooden coffin, honoring the dishonest victory of death over our king. We are attached to the coffin like slaves bound to a chariot processing through the streets in triumph. What!? Should we curse the planets that bring bad luck, because they planned to ruin our triumph? Or should we think that it was the crafty and clever French magicians and wizards that cast magic spells on him to end his life, because they were so afraid of him?\n\nBEDFORD\n\nStop, stop these arguments, you two and relax a little. Let's get on with the funeral, messengers are waiting for us. We will offer our weapons to the altar instead of gold, since there is no use for weapons now that Henry is dead. Future generations, years of misery await you, when babies will only be fed by their mothers' tears. Our island will feed on salty tears, and only women will be left to mourn the dead. I call on your ghost, Henry the Fifth. Make this country rich and keep it free of conflict. Fight with the planets in the sky that try to prevent this! After all, your soul will transform into a more famous star than Julius Caesar or shining—\n\nMESSENGER\n\nNo treason—there weren't enough men and we needed more money. The soldiers were saying that you have opposing groups here, and instead of sending out men to fight, you are arguing about your generals. One general wants to delay the war and save money. Another wants to act quickly and fly, but has no wings to do so. A third one thinks that peace can be brought about with deceitful words and with no money spent at all. You have to wake up, English aristocrats! Don't let your laziness cloud your vision of these new horrors. The flower-de-luces are cut out of your coat of arms, so half of England's coat of arms is already gone.\n\nMESSENGER\n\nO, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown: The circumstance I'll tell you more at large. The tenth of August last this dreadful lord, Retiring from the siege of Orleans, Having full scarce six thousand in his troop. By three and twenty thousand of the French Was round encompassed and set upon. No leisure had he to enrank his men; He wanted pikes to set before his archers; Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges They pitched in the ground confusedly, To keep the horsemen off from breaking in. More than three hours the fight continued; Where valiant Talbot above human thought Enacted wonders with his sword and lance: Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him; Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew: The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms; All the whole army stood agazed on him: His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit A Talbot! A Talbot! Cried out amain And rush'd into the bowels of the battle. Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up, If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward: He, being in the vaward, placed behind With purpose to relieve and follow them, Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke. Hence grew the general wreck and massacre; Enclosed were they with their enemies: A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace, Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back, Whom all France with their chief assembled strength Durst not presume to look once in the face.\n\nMESSENGER\n\nOh no, I will tell you more about how Talbot was defeated. On the 10th of August, this frightening man left the blockade at Orleans. He had barely 6000 soldiers. They were completely surrounded by 23,000 French soldiers. He couldn't put his men back into battle formation. He wanted to put pikes in the ground in front of his archers to protect them from the enemy, but sharp spears attacked them from the hedges. So, they sank to the ground, confused, to try and keep the men on horses from breaking in. The fight continued for more than three hours, when brave Talbot, seemingly superhuman, carried out wonders with his sword and spear. He sent hundreds of men to hell and none dared to stand against him. He was flying around angrily, all over the place. \"The devil is here!\" cried the French. The whole army was looking at him, amazed. His soldiers were carefully watching his unbreakable spirit. \"Talbot! Talbot!\" they cried out with all their strength and hurried to the center of the battle. This is where the battle would have ended, if John Fastolfe had not been such a coward. He should have followed and helped them, since he was at the front of the troops. But instead he ran away like a coward and didn't even use his sword once. This is when the real ruin and massacre started—once they were surrounded by their enemies. A lowly Walloon wanted to win the Dauphin's favor and so he thrust his spear into Talbot's back. Now all of France does not want to look Talbot in the face, not even after they have gathered all their strength."
