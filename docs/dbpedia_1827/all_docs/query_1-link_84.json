        "text": "By Joe Coughlan, Local Democracy Reporter\n\nGreenwich council has announced the death of Conservative councillor John Hills, with colleagues sharing tributes to celebrate his life.\n\nCllr Hills, who represented the Mottingham, Coldharbour and New Eltham ward, was said to have passed away on April 24 following a period of illness at the age of 86.\n\nCllr Hills was first elected to the council at a by-election for the former New Eltham ward in 2000, before being re-elected in six consecutive elections.\n\nOver his 24 years with the council, Cllr Hills served as the opposition group whip and opposition spokesman for health and adult social care, as well as being the president of the Greenwich Conservative Federation for 15 years.\n\nCouncillor Matt Hartley, leader of Greenwich Conservatives and fellow ward councillor, described Cllr Hills as a ‘giant’ of Greenwich politics and was universally respected for his generous support to others. He said the thoughts of the Greenwich Conservative Group were with Cllr Hills’ family.\n\nCllr Hartley said: “John was one of the most modest and unassuming people you could ever meet, and yet his contribution to public life in our borough was immense. He worked tirelessly for the area that he represented for an incredible 24 continuous years.”\n\nHe added: “John will be missed by so many residents across Mottingham, New Eltham and the Coldharbour Estate who he helped over that time – and by all of us who were lucky enough to call him a friend.”\n\nLabour councillor Cathy Dowse, also representing the Mottingham, Coldharbour and New Eltham ward, said on X that she was very sad to hear of the passing of Cllr Hills and that he was everything she could have asked for in a ward colleague. She said he was ‘endlessly encouraging’.\n\nLabour councillor Anthony Okereke, leader of Greenwich council, said his thoughts and condolences were with Cllr Hills’ friends and family. He said they should be rightly proud of the lasting impact the councillor had on the area.\n\nCllr Okereke said: “John’s loss will be felt not only in his ward, but across Royal Greenwich. He was a gentleman who was rightly proud of both his links, as well as that of the borough, to our Armed Forces.\n\n“His dedication to being a public servant meant he transcended the political divide. We are very lucky to have had such a selfless and dedicated councillor sit in our chamber.”\n\nPictured top: Conservative Councillor John Hills (Picture: David Madden Photography/Greenwich council)"
